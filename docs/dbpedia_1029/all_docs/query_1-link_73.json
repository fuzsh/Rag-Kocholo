        "text": "Jesus of Montreal+++\n\nDirector: Denys Arcand\n\nScreenplay: Denys Arcand\n\nCast: Lothaire Bluteau, Catherine Wilkening, Johanne-Marie Tremblay, Remy Girard, Robert Lepage, Gilles Pelletier\n\nRating: R; violence, nudity, profanity\n\nRunning time: 119 minutes\n\nExcellent +++++; Very good ++++\n\nGood +++; Mediocre ++; Poor +\n\nJesus of Montreal is considerably darker and deeper than Decline of the American Empire, the 1986 social comedy that brought writer-director Denys Arcand international acclaim.\n\nArcand hasn't abandoned easy marks _ he trades post-liberation sexual politics for a radical rethinking of the Passion play _ yet he's stalking bigger prey. In Jesus of Montreal he takes aim at our consumer-oriented society.\n\nAlthough Arcand's latest film might initially seem blasphemous, its true targets are religious hypocrites and cultural pharisee.\n\nOne hypocrite is the priest who commissions this new work to replace his stilted 35-year-old Passion play. Father Leclerc (Gilles Pelletier) is having an affair with a part-time actress (Johanne-Marie Tremblay) who works in the church's soup kitchen. She is cast in the new play by Daniel Coulombe (Lothaire Bluteau), the actor, director and playwright chosen to revamp the drama and play Jesus.\n\nCoulombe bases his text on some recent archaeological discoveries that suggest Jesus might be an illegitimate son of a Roman soldier. This hardly pleases the priest or his superiors in the Catholic church. They ban the play, in effect, turning its cast into the persecuted disciples of Coulombe's 20th-century Christ figure.\n\nCoulombe's players represent repentant sinners. Martin (Remy Girard) previously dubbed dialogue in pornographic movies; he's depicted playing two characters at once. The arresting, dark-featured Mireille (Catherine Wilkening) makes television commercials; she's told she sits on her most prized asset. Rene (Robert Lepage) narrates second-rate educational films on subjects like the birth of the sun.\n\nEach is cleansed by the rehearsal process, though Arcand doesn't depict the transformation. He simply skips from the casting to the premiere, then to the critical raves and Coulombe's courtship by an entertainment lawyer, meant to represent the devil.\n\nCoulombe becomes so obsessed with his role as Jesus that he casts out the money changers, advertisers who order Mireille to strip when she auditions for a beer commercial. Coulombe smashes their video camera, sound equipment and television, then chases them from the building.\n\nHe, in turn, is arrested as he hangs naked and limp on the cross at the next evening's performance. The arresting officer reads Coulombe his rights, then compliments his play, saying, \"It sure makes you think.\"\n\nArcand goes even further establishing the gaunt, lightly bearded Coulombe as a Christ figure. He devises a metaphorical crucifixion and resurrection that have astonishing impact.\n\nDespite receiving 12 Genies (Canadian Oscars), a nomination for an Academy Award and prizes at the Cannes and Montreal film fests, Jesus of Montreal is not a brilliant film. Its targets _ Coca Cola Classic, Newman's Own Salad Dressing and good-news commentators _ are too easily skewered. Its actors are too saintly. The glowing city of Montreal is too evil. (Cityscapes are accompanied by grating electronic guitar riffs.)\n\nWhile Jesus of Montreal's second half moves fitfully, it is engrossing, challenging and, ultimately, satisfying. Funny, tragic and consistently contradictory, it revitalizes the spirit of the Passion play through the actors energized by performing it."
