        "text": "The Presbyterian College announces the launch of a new Podcast: Jesus in Montreal.\n\nThis title is, evidently, a play on the title of the film Jesus of Montreal, by Denys Arcand. With this podcast we want to explore the fact that the risen Jesus is alive and at work in our city. In ways unique to our context, Jesus is bringing renewal and transformation and new life to the people and neighourhoods and organizations of Montreal. Through conversations with people of faith in the city, we will explore what Jesus is doing.\n\nThe first episode of this podcast has just been launched and can be found wherever you listen to podcasts: Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts, Stitcher, or Spotify. It can also be listened to here:"
