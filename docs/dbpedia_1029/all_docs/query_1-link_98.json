        "text": "There is a new temporary exhibit at the Museum of Saint Joseph’s Oratory until September 5, 2016! Inspired by the Gospel of Matthew, it encompasses works of art highlighting the figure of Jesus from the Manger to the Cross.\n\nPortrait of Jesus presents episodes from the life of Christ especially as detailed in the gospel according to Saint Matthew: his birth and childhood, his ministry as represented by teaching and miracles, as well as his passion followed by his death and his resurrection. Quotes from the gospel will be juxtaposed with images and artifacts of all types, epochs, and origins.\n\nWhy choose the gospel according to Saint Matthew for this task? The choice was inspired by the film made by Pier Paolo Pasolini (1922 to 1975) entitled The Gospel According to Matthew (1964) which portrays the biblical text without artifice, without interpretation. Such is the intent of this exhibit: to illustrate the life of Jesus without commentary, without exegesis; simply to give way to images, to Scripture, and to personal reflection. Enjoy your visit!\n\nFrom May 1 to June 26, the museum is open everyday from 10 a.m. to 4:30 p.m\n\nDownload the poster\n\nMore information on the Museum"
