        "text": "Movies\n\nJanuary\n\nThe movie “Boondock Saints” portrayed two Irish Catholic twins who decide to go on a killing spree after hearing a sermon at Mass. The sermon is about the results of good men doing nothing to stop evil. The film contains extensive use of Catholic imagery including oversized crucifixes worn by the main characters during their killings.\n\nJanuary 24\n\nIndependent filmmaker Tim Disney (the son of Roy and grandnephew of Walt) premiered the movie “Blessed Art Thou” at the Sundance Film Festival. The film is about a monk who is thought to be homosexual because he is visited by the angel Gabriel. Locked up by his superiors, he turns into a pregnant woman. Movie critic Jonathan Foreman reviewed the film saying, “It’s hard to imagine Walt Disney making a movie so likely to enrage Catholics.” He also wrote that the movie was an attack on the Catholic Church, portraying it at odds with true spirituality.\n\nFebruary\n\nThe 20th Century Fox movie, “The Closer You Get,” opened and featured a negative portrayal of a priest and the Catholic Church. The Los Angeles Times wrote, “…[the movie] implies unmistakably that Roman Catholicism’s puritanical tradition, which tends to set the flesh and the spirit at war, plays a pivotal part in keeping the villagers emotionally crippled as well as sexually frustrated.”\n\nMarch 31\n\nFine Features releases a film called “Buddy Boy.” The movie is about a repressed Catholic who lives with his alcoholic mother; she uses the Catholic religion to make her son feel bad about himself. The New Times Los Angeles writes, the movie “opens with grainy footage of crucifixes and elaborate church altars, then transits to an image of our protagonist Francis…masturbating to a centerfold of two giant breasts.” Fine Features also produced the anti-Catholic movie “Julien Donkey-Boy.”\n\nApril 21\n\nThe movie “The Virgin Suicides” opened in select theatres in New York, San Francisco and Los Angeles. The story involves five Catholic girls who all eventually commit suicide. Catholic imagery is apparent throughout the film. The New York Times said the movie involves boys who “seek to free the girls from the prison of their strict Catholic household.” The San Jose Mercury News said we learn of a “guilt-racked Catholic [mother] ready to lock girls away like so many story-book Rapunzels.”\n\nNovember\n\nFox Searchlight, a division of 20th Century Fox, released “Quills,” a fictional account of the Marquis de Sade. A major character in the movie is a priest, Abbe Coulmier, played by Joaquin Phoenix. In history, Abbe Coulmier was a four-foot tall hunchback, and a celibate. In the movie, he is portrayed as a “liberal-minded, good-looking young priest” who has a relationship with Sade and sex with a dead laundress.\n\nMusic\n\nMay 13\n\nNew York, NY — A singing group called “The Nuns” performed at a New York City nightclub called Click & Drag @ Mother. The group was described in the press as consisting of “lesbian vampire beauties.”\n\nNovember 8\n\nA new CD released by Cher called “Not Commercial” included the song “Sisters of Mercy” that describes the Catholic order of nuns as “daughters of hell,” “mothers of shame,” “twisters of truth,” and “daughters of war.” Among many offensive lines in the song which E! Online called a “diatribe against nuns,” the Sisters are said to “hide behind pious faces like the guilty always do.” The Catholic League called the song “defamatory” and that “taking a cheap shot at nuns costs nothing in Hollywood and may even be cause for celebration.”\n\nNovember\n\nA new CD by Marilyn Manson titled “Holy Wood” was released and was replete with anti-Catholic lyrics and songs, including “Godeatgod” and “Cruci-fixion in Space.” Manson appears dressed as a bishop with a cross behind him in his video “Disposable Teens,” and wears a papal miter while performing. When the Catholic League charged that Manson’s music is anti-Catholic, Manson posted on his Internet site the response that, “I can’t possibly be at war with Christ, because your religion killed him and what he stood for. But if you want to be at war with me…bring it on.” In a review of a Manson concert in New York City, Ann Powers of the New York Times noted without disapproval Manson’s anti-Catholic taunts.\n\nNovember 18\n\nWestbury, NY — Performer Englebert Humperdinck told a joke in the middle of his stage show at the Westbury Music Fair. The joke, involving a priest, nun and a camel, offended audience members to the point where they contacted the Catholic League to complain.\n\nNovember 27\n\nNew York, NY — Rock singer Marilyn Manson, promoting his new CD “Holy Wood,” played the Hammerstein Ballroom. The New York Daily News said, “By the time he finished, 75 minutes later, he had assumed the guise of a fascist leader, a menacing bishop, a towering Christmas tree and an insect-like cripple atop 10-foot crutches.”\n\nNewspapers\n\nJanuary 19\n\nLos Angeles, CA — Columnist M.H. Berg wrote a piece for the Los Angeles Timesabout her problem explaining religion to her daughter. A lapsed Catholic, she described Catholicism as a “magic show with smoky scents and costumes.” She wrote how she resented the exclusion of women from the priesthood as well as the Church’s position on birth control.\n\nJanuary 25\n\nLong Island, NY — Newsday ran the Eternal Gospel Church ad called “Earth’s Final Warning.” The ad, paid for by a splinter group of the Seventh Day Adventist Church, called the Catholic Church the Mother of Harlots in the Book of Revelation and insinuates the pope is seeking to wield undue influence over the U.S. government.\n\nJanuary 26\n\nDaytona Beach, FL — Matt Gowen, staff writer for the Flagler/Palm Coast News-Tribune wrote a column about his trip to a Methodist Church. In describing his experience, he characterized Catholic Mass as “boring” and entailing “munching on a wafer” while being “told to sit still and listen.”\n\nJanuary 30\n\nKansas City, MO — Beginning in its January 30th edition, the Kansas City Star ran a series of articles claiming an AIDS epidemic in the priesthood caused by the Church’s teaching on homosexuality, the practice of celibacy and the failure of the Church to teach “safe sex” in seminaries.\n\nThe series also claimed that the Church was attempting to hide the epidemic and, as a result, priests with the disease died alone and without support. The series was based, in part, on a survey conducted of Catholic priests by the Star and investigation of death certificates of priests which claimed to show that the death rate among priests was four times the general population rate.\n\nAn examination of the Star’s survey of priests by Center for Media and Public Affairs, found it fundamentally flawed, based on only a 27 percent response rate. There was also no geographic or demographic balance sought in the responses. Even with this, the Star’s conclusions did not fit the results of the survey. The Catholic League pointed out that the survey data showed exactly one-half of one percent of the respondents have HIV or AIDS.\n\nOnly 3.6 percent of the priests responding were critical of how the Church has responded to the problem. Seventy percent of the respondents did not call for a change in Church teaching on homosexuality, while 66 percent did not believe that removing celibacy would be an effective response.\n\nAdditionally, the Star’s claim of a higher rate was in error as it compared the death rate to the general population, rather than to adult males. Adjusted accordingly, there was no discernable difference. In addition, the investigation into death rates was flawed as it made national claims based on regional investigation.\n\nThe Catholic League charged that the survey and series smacked on an agenda, rather than a serious investigation.\n\nFebruary 2\n\nBoston, MA — Columnist Alex Beam wrote a piece in the Boston Globe about Indulgences titled, “Time has Come to Once Again Indulge Yourself.” The issue was in the news as the Church had announced special indulgences for the Jubilee Year 2000. In the article he wrote, “Catholicism formally abandoned the sale of get-out-of-Purgatory cards in 1567” and “I’m a big fan of the present pope, and generally an admirer of the One True Church. But let’s make one thing clear. Jesus Christ never sold or granted indulgences. Quite the opposite. They were an invention of the 14th century Church bureaucracy, which often used the proceeds to build cathedrals, hospitals—or just line their pockets.”\n\nFebruary 8\n\nFramingham, MA — Columnist Brian Carovillano wrote in the MetroWest Daily Newsabout the overpopulation problem and the Church. In the column titled “The Overpopulation Pope,” Carovillano wrote, “From now on, the blame for resulting deaths from starvation and wars fought over natural resources should be squarely pointed at the Vatican, which continues to dwell in Medieval times.”\n\nFebruary 23\n\nBurlington, VT — Peter Freyne’s column in the newspaper Seven Days started out as commentary on recent protests by Catholic priests against same sex marriages in Vermont. It quickly turned into a tirade against the Church, which he says “…stand[s] against civil rights for gay and lesbian Catholics, Protestants, Jews and Vermonters.” He continued his rant, “Yeah right, like where in the laws of God does it say to run bingo games? Where does it tell the pope to cozy up to Adolph Hitler?”\n\nMarch\n\nA horrific incident that took place in Montreal, Canada went completely unreported in the United States. Fifteen masked vandals entered Mary Queen of the World Cathedral in Montreal, overturning flowerpots, sticking sanitary napkins—some soiled—to paintings and walls. They denounced the Church’s teachings on abortion, homosexuality and sex education. Not one U.S. newspaper reported on the incident although in the same time period, the New York Times ran a story about the controversy in Montreal and all of Quebec over whether Pokemon cards should be issued in French.\n\nMarch 14\n\nVancouver, WA — The Columbian, southern Washington’s largest daily newspaper, ran an ad paid for by the Eternal Gospel Church of Seventh Day Adventists, a splinter group not associated with SDA. The ad identified the Catholic Church as the “WHORE” and the “BEAST,” and charged the Holy Father with breaking down the barriers between church and state. After being contacted by the Catholic League, the paper admitted running it was inappropriate and that it would not run it again.\n\nMarch 14\n\nFresno, CA — The newspaper advertisement from the Eternal Gospel Church was run again, this time in the Fresno Bee. After a complaint from the Catholic League and Bishop John T. Steinbock of the Diocese of Fresno, the newspaper responded in a manner unlike any other newspaper that ran the ad and later apologized. Publisher Keith Moyer wrote, “free expression—even when offensive to many or few—is essential to maintaining a free society. It is not the first time the Catholic Church…has been attacked, nor will it be the last. Fortunately, the church has survived and flourished despite its critics—as has the Bee.”\n\nMarch 20\n\nLos Angeles, CA — Columnist Shawn Hubler of the Los Angeles Times, wrote a piece about the Catholic Church’s opposition to gay marriage. Hubler implied the Archdiocese of Los Angeles was guilty of bigotry for supporting California’s Proposition 22, an anti-gay marriage referendum.\n\nMarch 30\n\nHouston, TX — Richard Connolly wrote in the Houston Press about a new baseball park in Houston. His column took the form of a joke in which some “memos” he found read: “There is a Catholic Church right across the street from the new stadium. I am reliably told that not only do they offer bread and wine at their services, but apparently there is some kind of floor show involved, a magician who transforms those things into the ‘body and blood of Christ,’ Christ being some kind of prophet dude.” He continues, “At any rate, while I am told the wafers don’t really offer much in the way of taste, could it be any worse than the chips and salsa at some of the so-called Mexican places around town?”\n\nApril 4\n\nNorth Port, FL — A newspaper advertisement strikingly similar to the one frequently paid for by the Eternal Gospel Church of Seventh Day Adventists appeared in North Port Sun-Herald. The sponsor this time was the Sweetwater Seventh Day Adventist Church. It too called the Catholic Church the “WHORE” and the “BEAST,” and charged the Holy Father with breaking down the barriers between church and state.\n\nApril 9\n\nHackensack, NJ — The advertisement from the Sweetwater Seventh Day Adventist Church appeared in The Record newspaper.\n\nApril 19\n\nNew York, NY — Mike Farragher’s article in the Irish Voice titled, “Irish, Jewish…and Proud Of It!” was about his interfaith marriage. In the article he described how he tried not to have a crucifix at his wedding so as not to offend the Jewish guests. When the chapel had an image of Jesus, he quickly explained that the chaplain “was a huge Bee Gees fan who thought a picture of Barry Gibb…would look good on the altar.” He also suggested “drive-thru” windows so Catholics with children could receive “McSacraments.”\n\nApril 23\n\nPortland, OR — The Oregonian newspaper ran an ad Easter Sunday morning paid for by the Sweetwater Seventh-day Adventist Church. The ad was the often seen “Earth’s Final Warning.” The ad claimed, among other things, that the Catholic Church was the “Whore of Babylon” and that the pope was conspiring with the U.S. government.\n\nWhen contacted about the ad, the president of the Oregonian Publishing Company, Patrick Stickel, said, “…we think long and hard about censoring anyone.” And “We don’t find this [the ad] graphically displeasing, and we find it easier for readers who don’t like it to turn the page.” Catholic League president William Donohue wrote to Stickel asking if the paper accepts every ad it receives, prints every op-ed piece submitted or would run an ad from an anti-gay group.\n\nApril 20-26\n\nMilwaukee, WI — The weekly The Onion featured a section that declared, “Hey kids! The Easter Bunny will be hop-hop-hopping along before you know it! In the meantime, here are some super-fun Easter cards for you to cut out.” The pictures included: a duck wearing a crown of thorns and carrying a cross, Jesus wearing rabbit ears with an Easter basket on his arm, and a crucified Easter bunny with the inscription INRI above his head.\n\nMay\n\nHuntsville, AL — The Huntsville Times ran the anti-Catholic ad “EARTH’S FINAL WARNING” put out by the Eternal Gospel Church, a splinter group of the Seventh-Day Adventists. After a protest by the Catholic League, editor Joe Distelheim wrote an editorial explaining why it was a mistake to run the ad in the first place.\n\nMay 7\n\nBoston, MA — Boston Herald columnist Margery Eagan, in a piece about her son’s First Communion, decided to include a diatribe against the institutional Church writing, “Clearly the Catholic Church needs better public relations. It needs someone to tell those who got beaten up by nuns, those who have had abortions, those who are continually embarrassed by a hierarchy’s anti-gay rhetoric, or are just plain uninformed that it’s not all about a hierarchy anymore. That in the pews, despite what you read, it’s not endless harangues against sex, women; sex gays; sex birth control; sex, sex and more sex.”\n\nMay 24\n\nSan Francisco, CA — Scott Ostler’s column in the San Francisco Chronicle featured a section called “Today’s Theological Stumper.” It said, “To all those who believe that letting Jesus into your heart can cure homosexuality, one question: Why doesn’t it work on priests?”\n\nJune 2\n\nMunster, IN — The newspaper The Times contained an article by Pat Colander called “Fat Irma’s three great predictions and how they all turned out.” The piece was about an apparition of a woman to truck drivers regarding road construction, road congestion and transportation. It said the Teamsters Union recently unveiled the third secret of “Fat Irma,” a reference to the Church and the apparitions at Fatima.\n\nJune 4\n\nSan Francisco, CA — The San Francisco Examiner carried an article by Stephanie Salter called “Judging Sister Jeannine: What would Jesus Say?” about the Church disciplining Sister Jeannine Gramick for insubordination as it pertained to her work with gays and lesbians. The article probed into the internal Church matter in the form of a letter to Jesus.\n\nJune 4\n\nNew York, NY — Michael Lewis wrote a piece for the New York Times Magazine about Lindy Boggs. In describing her work at the American Embassy at the Vatican, Lewis took a cheap shot saying how “…she had clearly learned that a woman in her mid-80s surrounded by men in dresses sworn to vows of celibacy can say whatever she pleases.” No comments about the clothing of other religious people were included in the article.\n\nJune 7\n\nPittsburgh, PA — Mary Jo Kramer wrote a column in the INPGH Weekly about her trip to Lourdes, France. To prepare for the pilgrimage, it was necessary to “smoke a bowl, dress Catholic and ready to meet the Virgin.” She described “nuns with cell phones…Virgin Mary snow domes, lighters, clocks [and] pencil kits.”\n\nJune 8\n\nSeattle, WA — The alternative publication Seattle Weekly ran a column by Judy McGuire called “Dategirl” that featured an attack on Catholicism. In the article McGuire wrote in part, “Four years at St. Thomas the Apostle grade school combined with 16 years attending Mass on at least a weekly basis have earned me the right to Catholic-bash. It’s a repressive, hypocritical religion run by mean-spirited men….” It continued, “Nothing makes a girl feel more badass than stumbling home past primly dressed parishioners early Sunday morning, still wearing last night’s sequined skirt (now on backwards)…all the while emitting the delicate (and enticing) aroma of semen, cigarettes, and stale beer.”\n\nJune 9\n\nPhiladelphia, PA — Thom Nickels wrote an article in the Philadelphia Inquirer called “Spiritual don’t ask/don’t tell.” In the article he writes, “Why did God create a homosexual orientation and then decide acting on such impulses would be wrong?” and “To be sure, there are many progressive priests and nuns working on the behalf of gays and lesbians…despite Vatican pronouncements.” Catholic League president William Donohue wrote a letter to the editor pointing out many other human impulses have to be repressed and that the Vatican supports ministering to gays and lesbians.\n\nJune 29\n\nWashington, DC — The Washington Post ran a feature on Oprah Winfrey in its “Life & Arts” section. It was titled, “Our Lady of Perpetual Help.” The article was accompanied by illustrations of Winfrey similar to the iconography of the Blessed Mother.\n\nJuly 2\n\nDetroit, MI — Columnist Susan Ager, writing in the Detroit Free Press, questioned the propriety and meaning behind Pope John Paul II having lunch with 200 homeless people. She asked, “Does an expansive lunch…do more for the poor or the conscience of the Catholic Church?” She pointed out that 9 homeless people died in Rome last year “while millions of dollars were spent to spruce up buildings for the holy year 2000 visitors.” She did not point out the city of Rome and country of Italy paid for the improvements which were not requested by the Church.\n\nJuly 12\n\nAkron, OH — The Akron Beacon Journal ran an ad by the Eternal Gospel Church called “Earth’s Final Warning.” It describes the pope as the anti-Christ and the Church as being “the whore of Babylon” and being in conspiracy with the U.S. government.\n\nAugust 19\n\nPhoenix, AZ — When the “Earth’s Final Warning” ad appeared in the Arizona Republic.Bishop Thomas J. O’Brien of Phoenix demanded an apology and the Catholic League supported him in this effort. In the August 26th edition, advertising vice president David Alley wrote a sincere apology to readers for running the ad. The Catholic League wrote to Mr. Alley to congratulate him for his “journalistic integrity.”\n\nAugust 22\n\nNew York, NY — The Village Voice featured a book review written by David Bowman. It was a review of The Toy Collector by James Gunn. The review read, in part, “the James Gunn in the novel is a lapsed Catholic. I stopped going to church for a long time, but started again after I met a great priest out of St. Louis who told me I could make up what Catholicism was and believe what I wanted to believe….I gave a reading of The Toy Collector [and] read a passage about heterosexual anal sex. St. Louis is 75 percent Catholic. There has to be one Catholic who says, ‘Listen, I’m a fan of anal sex.'”\n\nAugust 26\n\nAtlanta, GA — Roger Kintzel of the Atlanta Journal-Constitution apologized to readers for running the anti-Catholic “Earth’s Final Warning” advertisement from the Eternal Gospel Church in the August 26th edition\n\nSeptember\n\nFt. Lauderdale, FL — The New Times Broward-Palm Beach ran a “Jesus of the Week 2000” contest asking readers to send in images of what they think Jesus would look like in the year 2000. The reviews included: “Look, up in the sky! It’s a bird! It’s plane! No, It’s Christ on a kite!” and “Well, you might not want to take that lying down with the lamb thing too far, bub. It’s good to bless the beasts and all that, and maybe a rock-climbing savior who’s into extreme sports would make a good fit for the new millennium.” Another description was, “This week’s contestant, the lovely Heather Cornwell, has us thinking about this Messiah makeover project in a whole new light. To quote Ms. Cornwell, ‘The Jesus of the new millennium is a woman, because what’s more loving and comforting than breasts? I offer you myself as Jesus.'”\n\nSeptember 7\n\nBoston, MA — In a letter to the Boston Globe, Mr. Paul Kelley of Reading, MA tried to justify contemporary anti-Catholicism by writing, “Pius IX’s reliance on reactionary forces to preserve the Papal States, his opposition to unification and republican institutions in Italy, and the illiberal views enunciated in his Syllabus of Errors make understandable anti-Catholic attitudes in America.”\n\nSeptember 8\n\nFrederick, MD — Frederick Post columnist Roy Meachum wrote an article about recent events in the Catholic Church titled, “Unholy Week.” In it, Meachum called the Congregation of the Doctrine of the Faith “…the old Holy Office of the Inquisition given a more politically correct name.” He accused Catholic officials of saying, “Heaven and its choicest corners were strictly reserved for Roman Catholics. No others need apply, no matter how holy their lives.”\n\nSeptember 17\n\nSpringfield, IL — Episcopal minister Tom Ehrich, writing in the State-Journal of Springfield, IL, said of the Vatican document on salvation, “…this puffery by a Vatican inner circle—small-minded institutionalists who find derivative life in milling about a throne—embarrasses millions of hard-working Catholics ….” And, “Second, and sadder, in this glimpse into a dark side of Christianity: the tendency to live for show, the desire for worldly wealth and power, the tendency to value noise over substance, right opinion over servanthood, the past over the present….”\n\nSeptember 18\n\nToledo, OH — Toledo Blade columnist Patrick O’Gara wrote a piece about recent events in the Catholic Church. O’Gara referred to the pope as “The Man in the Vatican Beanie.” O’Gara also wrote, “Catholics believe Mahatma Gandhi, surely one of the undisputed holy men of recorded history, didn’t make it to heaven because he was a Hindu. Too bad. He could have spent eternity chatting with the corrupt and murderous Borgia popes, who presumably dwell there today.”\n\nSeptember 26\n\nDetroit, MI — The September 26th edition of the Detroit Free Press ran an editorial cartoon by Mike Thompson opposed to school vouchers. While all six cells of the cartoon ridiculed vouchers, in the last cell reference was made to a “Vouch-O-Matic” machine that destroys the Constitution, sucks millions out of public education and blinds the voters. Readers were told, “To Order, Rush Your Tax Dollars To: The Roman Catholic Church.” The Catholic League responded asking why a public policy issue such as school vouchers cannot be discussed without the use of anti-Catholic rhetoric.\n\nOctober 4\n\nAthens, OH — The Athens Messenger ran the “Earth’s Final Warning” anti-Catholic advertisement from the Eternal Gospel Church. On being contacted by William Donohue, the publisher of the newspaper assured the Catholic League that the advertisement would not run again and ran a statement of regret to newspaper readers.\n\nOctober 8-9\n\nBaltimore, MD — The Baltimore Sun apologized to readers for running anti-Catholic “Earth’s Final Warning” advertisements in the October 8th and 9th editions from the Eternal Gospel Church.\n\nOctober 8, November 26\n\nRockville, MD — The Montgomery Journal ran the “Earth’s Final Warning” hate ads. When first contacted by the Catholic League, the publisher responded that his newspaper was “very liberal.” He conceded, however, that he would not run an advertisement from the KKK and that he would review the matter again and was “leaning toward not accepting such an ad if it was placed again.” The Catholic League also protested placement of the ad in The Journal of Martinsburg, West Virginia, the Austin American-Statesman, and the Des Moines Register.\n\nOctober 15\n\nSan Bernardino, CA — After the Catholic League complained about The Sun publishing the “Earth’s Final Warning” advertisement, the publisher notified the Catholic League that those who were involved in accepting the advertisement had served notice of resignation. He responded that the decision to accept the advertisement was “extremely poor” and that the newspaper “will be careful not to accept such advertising in the future.”\n\nNovember 2\n\nBoston, MA — Boston Herald columnist Margery Eagan wrote a column about the disciplining of a Catholic nun for carrying out duties reserved for priests. Eagan said the nun was “banished to the gulag.” She suggested, “Perhaps crucifixion is the next logical step.”\n\nNovember 5\n\nKansas City, MO — In a follow-up to its series from January 2000, the Kansas City Starclaimed to have uncovered 300 cases where priests had died from AIDS between 1987 and 1998. The Star quoted Richard Selik of the Center for Disease Control as saying there was a “significant” difference between the AIDS death rates of priests and the AIDS death rates of adult males. This was to buttress claims of the original series, that there is an AIDS epidemic among priests caused by mandatory celibacy and Church teaching on homosexuality. When contacted by the Catholic League, Selik stated that by “significant” he only meant that the difference was unlikely to be the result of chance. He pointed out two limitations of the Star survey: the data were culled from just 14 states and may not be representative of the country; and that the study was not age-adjusted between priests and the adult male population.\n\nNovember 8\n\nSpokane, WA — The Spokesman-Review of Spokane, WA ran a short item in its November 8th issue announcing a talk and book signing by Father Robert Spitzer, the president of Gonzaga University. The headline for the short notice read, “Nazi priest promotes his book.”\n\nWhen William Donohue called to complain, the response was that it was an “error” and there would be an apology in the next issue. Donohue responded that it was not an error but a deliberate defamation as Father Spitzer had banned a Planned Parenthood representative from speaking on the university campus that past spring. He stated the person responsible should be fired.\n\nThe Catholic League contacted newspapers throughout the country and blanketed radio and television stations in Spokane. Within 24 hours Robin Moody, who wrote the defamatory headline, was asked to resign by the newspaper’s editors. Moody had been the president of the women’s studies club at Gonzaga who had invited the Planned Parenthood representative to Gonzaga.\n\nNovember 11\n\nNew York, NY — The New York Law Journal published a photo essay called “Eyewitness.” It was called “Arrest records from an exhibition of police memorabilia, White Plains City Court.” The essay featured mug shots of a nun and a priest. The photographer, Rick Kopstein, refused to return calls seeking the meaning behind the nun and priest being in the essay.\n\nDecember 7\n\nMilwaukee, WI — The parody newspaper The Onion ran a lead story titled, “Vatican Warns Against Increasingly Healthy Attitudes Towards Sex.” The story read, in part, “Alarmed by rising rates of pleasurable, mutually fulfilling acts of physical love among Catholics, the Vatican issued a statement Monday warning against healthy attitudes towards sex.”\n\nDecember 8\n\nNew York, NY — The Wall Street Journal ran a front-page story on how few women in Mexico and Italy use tampons. The authors of the story acknowledged that the Church has no position on tampons, yet claimed that Catholicism was the reason tampons were not utilized. The authors said that “some priests have spoken out against the product, associating it with birth control and sexual activities that are forbidden by the Church.” When contacted by the Catholic League, one of the authors, Emily Nelson, could not produce the name of any priest who had made such a statement.\n\nPeriodicals\n\nJanuary\n\nOhio — The “Devil’s Advocate” column written by Randy Allen and appearing in theOhio Farmer and The Farmer magazines addressed the recent accord between Lutherans and Catholics. Allen implied the Church has changed its teaching on justification. It also compared Church membership and hierarchy to the USDA. Allen did not similarly ridicule the Lutheran faith.\n\nFebruary\n\nFodor’s Exploring Italy travel guide contained comments about the Vatican and Catholicism. Included was a joke comparing the typical Italian mother and son to Mary and Jesus.

The actual text of the article was not legible in the artwork.\n\nMarch 12\n\nSlate magazine’s Jack Shafer wrote a piece in response to a column in the New York Times Magazine about anti-Catholicism. Shafer wrote, “If anti-Catholic bigotry exists in America, it might have something to do with the Catholic Church’s past conduct. Just this weekend, His Holiness John Paul II conceded as much when he finally got around to apologizing to the world for 2000 years of Catholic wickedness.” Shafer also compared the pope to Louis Farrakhan: “But tap-dancing away from accountability more beautifully than Farrakhan, the pope absolved the Catholic Church of blame because it is ‘holy and immaculate.'”\n\nApril 3\n\nThe magazine The Nation ran a piece by Katha Pollitt after the papal apology. In the article titled, “Regrets Only,” Pollitt wrote, “That the Pope decided to acknowledge the historical wrongs of the church shows how weak it has become….The Pope can rail against contemporary Catholics for secularism and religious indifference all he wants, and blame the people in the pews for the actions of the hierarchy, but modernity is stronger than he is: look who is apologizing.”\n\nMay\n\nPhiladelphia, PA — The Philadelphia Trumpet, a magazine published by the Philadelphia Church of God, had a cover story called “The Next Pope.” The article says the Church is in a period of “unprecedented danger” as reformers try to take power from conservatives.

The piece said the car “features a sliding hardtop that descends into the trunk so that the Pope can stumble into the back seat without bending over…It is not known yet whether the pope, after every ride, kisses the ground or prays he’ll be reincarnated as Bernie Ecclestone.”\n\nOctober\n\nThe October issue of Premiere magazine mentioned a movie called “Tomcats” and ran a photo from one scene.

Father Rasi is not listed in the Official Catholic Directory and Dignity is not recognized by the Church. On the show, Father Rasi proceeded to misrepresent Catholic teaching on the subject.\n\nThe Catholic League contacted the show to protest the selection of Father Rasi as a guest. Bobby Grossman of “Larry King Live” admitted in June that he was being inundated with complaints after their contact information was published in the Catholic League’s Catalyst.

When The Catholic League contacted the producers for some evidence of such an exchange, Bonnie Erbe replied, “We have nothing to add at this time.”\n\nJune\n\nNBC “Today” show weatherman Al Roker was making the television talk show rounds to promote his new book about fatherhood. In doing so he repeatedly told a story about an expensive fertility drug his wife used. He claimed the drug company was a subsidiary of the Vatican and the drug was made from the urine of “menopausal nuns.” He then told a joke about how it would be less expensive to adopt a nun and have her “pee in a cup.” In discussing the Catholic League’s objection to the story and joke on other TV appearances, Roker never re-told the joke to which we objected.\n\nJuly 8\n\nThe Bravo network featured a theme night of movies, showing “The Last Temptation of Christ” at 8 pm and then “Agnes of God” at 10:30 pm.

If you don’t go to hell for that, what the hell do you go to hell for?”\n\n· The nun calls the Vatican to see if the priest is right. The pope appears senile.\n\n· Transubstantiation is described as “just plain silly” and the kids wonder whether “Jesus was made of crackers”; they also ask whether “all we have to do is confess our sins and eat crackers” to avoid hell.\n\n· The father of the Jewish boy tells his son “Christians use hell to scare people into believing what they want them to\n\nbelieve.”\n\nAugust 8\n\nAn edition of “Politically Incorrect” on ABC featured another session of attacks on the Catholic Church and the priesthood.

What can be more pagan than that?”\n\nOctober 30\n\nOn UPN’s “Moesha,” the young Moesha dressed like a nun for Halloween and jumped into a man’s arms with her legs wrapped around his waist.

No holy water for them.” She wrote that priests are hearing confessions “from all youngsters who want absolution from sins they have hardly time to commit.” Noting that Church officials relaxed the dress code at St. Peter’s for the young people she reported: “If God, Jesus, the Virgin Mary, the Holy Ghost are getting to see more than the usual of the flesh which He created in places where the Roman Catholic clergy want it covered up, then it does not seem to be causing much divine offense.”\n\nWilliam Donohue protested to ABCNEWS.com.
