        "meta_description": "At the cathedral above Montreal, Easter Passion is played every year about the death of Jesus Christ. The production needs to be refreshed a bit – over the years, the acting of the main characters has become pathetic and far-fetched. The priest assigns this task to a young, unconventional theatre actor Daniel, who writes a new script and sets up a group of actors – Martin, whose acting career has been reduced to dubbing porn films, Mireille, whom show business has reduced only to her body, Constance beaten by life, and René, who has been dreaming of the character of Hamlet in vain all his life. Although the church representatives will not greet new production with enthusiasm, the passion story grows from production to life and has an extraordinary impact on the audience and the actors themselves. Arcand's story is a search for the meaning and place of spirituality in the modern, urbanised, scientific world, but also a satirical view of the world of art, and theatre in particular.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nRunning time: 2 hrs 50 mins with one interval\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPremière February 3, 2024\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nDo you also wish to be among the first to know what is going on at the SND?\r\n\r\nLeave your contact details with us, and you won’t miss out on any news.",
