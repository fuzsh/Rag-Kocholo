        "text": "Photo: C. Turmel rom 1852, on land donated by Pierre Beaubien, the Sulpicians (priests of Notre-Dame) opened a chapel dedicated to the Infant Jesus to serve the citizens of the hillside village of Saint Louis located near the Montreal quarries.\n\nSix years later, on Christmas day, the bishop of Montreal, Monsignor Bourget, inaugurated a new stone church. In 1867, with the division of the Notre-Dame Parish, he decreed the official founding of the Saint-Enfant-Jésus-du-Coteau Saint-Louis Parish. When the village was annexed to Montreal, the Parish was renamed Saint-Enfant-Jésus-de-Montréal.\n\nFaçade\n\nPhoto: C. Turmel n 1901 the parish hired architect Joseph Venne to design a new façade and draw plans for the enlargement of the church which had become too small to serve the parish members.\n\nOver the granite and limestone portico with seven bays, inspired by the Italian Renaissance, rises one of the most exuberant façades of sculpted stone in Quebec. It constitutes the stonecutters' vibrant homage to the Infant Jesus. In the pyramidal composition that recalls a Latin American Baroque style, is a clever equilibrium of arches, niches, pilasters, small columns, medallions, and stonework reaching up to the Baroque pinnacle which dominates the neighbourhood.\n\nThe composition is completed with the three statues signed by Olindo Gratton, one in bronze representing the Infant Jesus, the others of wood covered in copper representing the angels of the crèche and the Resurrection."
