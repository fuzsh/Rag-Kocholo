        "text": "When, at the beginning of the 20th century, the influential German theologian Albert Schweitzer published a historiographical account of the \"historical Jesus\", a number of silent films devoted to the life and death of Christ had already appeared in Europe and the United States. This article analyses the rise of early silent films about Christ against the backdrop of the debate intensified by growing interest in the \"historical Jesus\", presenting some of the similarities and divergences that representations of the life of Jesus produced in different media as mass culture became increasingly relevant.\n\nFilms depicting the life and times of Jesus of Nazareth have been produced since the inauguration of motion pictures at the end of the nineteenth century. Today, Christian ministers are increasingly recognizing the power of this medium to influence popular Christologies both inside and outside the church and thus are seeking to harness Jesus films for discussions about the life and nature of Jesus. This article summarizes the major periods in the production of Jesus films and provides some guidance for using such films in discussions about Jesus.\n\nMartin Scorsese’s film adaptation of Nikos Kazantzakis’ The Last Temptation of Christ presents an unorthodox, nonhierarchical dualism. This dualism has often been negatively interpreted by critics, leading them to condemn the film for misogyny, among other sins. Following Scorsese’s intentions for the film, this essay offers an alternative interpretation of Last Temptation’s conflict as one between competing virtues. In addition, it also positively evaluates the creators’ attempt to lift the story of Jesus out of traditional Christianity in order to offer it to a wider audience.\n\nPier Paolo Pasolini's art, as a reflection of his opinions, was subject to scandal and denunciations, including an accusation of an ”attack upon religion,” for his film La ricotta (1963). Pasolini’s following film, The Gospel According to Saint Matthew (1964) was an apparently more orthodox film, winning awards from cultural institutions. One such award was the ”International Catholic Film Office (O.C.I.C)” prize for the best religious film of the year, which shows that the film was embraced by both critics and the Church. What changed then after La ricotta, leading Pier Paolo Pasolini, an avowed Marxist and non-believer, to shoot The Gospel According to Saint Mat- thew? In addressing this question, the aim of this article is to evaluate the unexpected connection between La ricotta – a movie that appears to satirize religion – and The Gospel According to Saint Matthew, – which the International Catholic Film Office (O.C.I.C.) defined far superior to earlier, commercial films on the life of Christ. This article will show how these seemingly opposite films actually complement each other."
