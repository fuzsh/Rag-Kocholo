        "text": "OP\n\nMember\n\nJoined:\n\nPosts: 2,960\n\nThis from the BRAVO website. The film is currently being shown twice tonight (Saturday, Mar-6-2004):\n\n* * * * * * *\n\nThe Last Temptation of Christ\n\nMarch 6, 2004\n\nFaith, morality, sin and redemption have been subjects of intense interest for director Martin Scorsese, dating back at least as far as Harvey Keitel holding his hand over votive candles and imaging the tormenting flames of hell in Mean Streets. So it should come as no surprise that this Roman Catholic artist would be drawn to Nikos Kazantzakis' controversial, Gnostic-influenced novel reinterpreting the story of the Passion. Willem Dafoe portrays Jesus, dealing with his own doubts, fears and, yes, temptations in a way never before depicted in film. With Harvey Keitel, Barbara Hershey, Harry Dean Stanton and David Bowie.\n\n* * * * * * *\n\nIt is interesting how the Gnostic version of the Passion is being shown after Mel Gibson's Passion movie debuted. Yet, BRAVO stated earlier that it will not show it again. According to the non-church affiliated CATHOLIC LEAGUE for Religious and Civil Right's website:\n\n\"The cable television channel Bravo aired the film \"The Last Temptation of Christ.\" Fourteen months prior, Bravo pulled a showing of the film and issued a statement to the press saying they \"have decided not to renew the licensing agreement to air the movie, therefore this feature will no longer be aired.\"\n\nHmmmmmmmm. And that was only ~five years ago ...\n\nI wonder if liberal biblical scholar, Paula Frederickson, and others will protest the highly anti-orthodox, anti-canonical portrayal of the Passion of the Christ? Oh! I almost forgot. Paula Frederickson doesn't believe in the primacy (and/or accuracy) of the canonical Gospels. I am sure Elain Pagels will enjoy knowing a Gnostic-version of anything got primetime.\n\nThis next one from the Detroit Free Press:\n\n* * * * * * *\n\n\"The Last Temptation of Christ\" (8 p.m., Bravo). With all the theological and box-office hubbub sparked by Mel Gibson's \"The Passion of the Christ,\" Bravo gets into the spiritual movie zone. Director Martin Scorsese's provocative, absorbing 1988 film features Willem Dafoe as Jesus of Nazareth. The only jarring note? Harvey Keitel's street tough accent as a character I would describe as Judas of Brooklyn. Yo, J.C.!\n\n* * * * * * *\n\nBTW, when the movie first debuted in the theatres, Scorsese's friend, Roger Ebert (remember him?) gave it a thumbs up.\n\nBut airing this controversial film during Lent is just another attempt to ride the Passion of the Christ bandwagon. A few years back, one network in Russia, NTV, tried airing it on during Holy Week, but it got cancelled. Just like the Jesus Seminar folks, you only hear from them around Christmas (in order to deny it or at least deny the canonical Gospel version of it) or Easter (in order to deny it or at least deny the canonical Gospel version of it). Go figure!\n\nJoe\n\nOP\n\nMember\n\nJoined:\n\nPosts: 2,960\n\ndjs, or whoever you are:\n\nOnce again you take me to task and I don't even know who my respondent is ...\n\nThere were many lines in the film (I only watched 15-20 minutes) that grossly contradict the teaching of the Christ as found in the canonical Gospels.\n\nI am sure the author didn't imply that it was a faithful 'word-for-word' version of anything but his own. He got excommunicated by the Greek Orthodox anyway.\n\nBut because you can't see what I was trying to get at, but would rather take me to task, I ask you once again to consider what I wrote. You consider the artistic license that any author has. This is OK. I even appreciated \"Jesus of Montreal.\"\n\nMel gets charged for being anti-Semitic for first including something that WAS in the Gospel (cf. Matthew), but we simply write off The Last Temptation of Christ Denied as mere artistic license. There were a number of old polemics and new trends in that movie. I would simply consider it a mere artistic creation in itself (just another Jesus story), but there are many who actually believe that this IS the real story about Jesus to the extent that the canonical version is an absolute fabrication. The Jesus Seminars, Paula Fredericksons, and Elaine Pagels of the world would probably stand on the side of The Last Temptation as Gospel truth than the canonical Gospels themselves.\n\nAnd that they teach at Catholic universities and take such idea seriously is another story. I know from personal experience.\n\nAny producer always includes his/her own artistic touches. But Mel didn't try to surround his ideas with the Passion story. Like any iconographer, he can also write a theology - even though that may not have been his intention. Our Pentecost icon sometimes show Mary, the Theotokos, with the Apostles, but that is because we Byzantines believe that Mary is the 'heart' of the Church, hence her inclusion in that icon at times.\n\nI personally don't believe that Mel is a theologian nor pretends to be one. He is an actor and director.\n\nMy comments about the cultural wars is not personally directed at you, so you don't have to defend them all the time. I was only providing a commentary.\n\nBRAVO was supposed to have stated that they wouldn't show it. They did. Money and ratings talk. I am sure we will see more Jesus documentaries, movies, plays, and hear more from the Jesus Seminar folks over the Great Fast. We might even be entertained with another viewing of The Life of Brian ...\n\nCan you imagine any producer making a documentary about Mohammed with the same artistic license as found in the Last Temptation? Will you volunteer to visit mosques to tell the Muslims that the movie was OK because the producer didn't intend to base his story on the Qu'ran and/or traditions about his life? That he was actually a closet-Christian?\n\nBlessed are the cheesemakers.\n\nJoe\n\nMember\n\nJoined:\n\nPosts: 2,941\n\nQuote\n\nMy comments about the cultural wars is not personally directed at you, so you don't have to defend them all the time. I was only providing a commentary.\n\nI don't take them at all personally, and wish that you would not take it personally, when I disagree with aspects of your commentary.\n\nQuote\n\nMel gets charged for being anti-Semitic for first including something that WAS in the Gospel (cf.

I would simply consider it a mere artistic creation in itself (just another Jesus story), but there are many who actually believe that this IS the real story about Jesus to the extent that the canonical version is an absolute fabrication.\n\nI don't write it off. I noted that Iannone said that disclaimers notwithstanding there is still so much of a resonance with the Book - that it is not clear enough that this is work of fiction rather than being the real story. I had suggested before that the closer one is to the real story the greater the scrutiny precisely because of the possible confusion of the work with the real story. Accordingly, Gibson's highly authentic movie could be expected to raise concerns and to receive criticism.\n\nBy now it should be clear that many people of faith criticised the movie, not because they are on the wrong side of the culture war but because of sincere issues thay had with it. Conversely lack of criticism of the Last Tempation, among people of faith, probably has more to do with the limited audience and clearer departure of the movie from the real story, rather than latent anti-Christian sympathies, IMO. And perhaps too the that fact that it may have a resonating message for us: that the gravest barrier to shouldering our crosss is the not a preference for abject evil, but the simple desire for a simple, pleasant earthly life.\n\nI do think that raising the issue of possible Anti-Semitism was unavoidable and seems to have had good results. In light of history, special diligence is required on this issue.\n\nQuote\n\nThe Jesus Seminars, Paula Fredericksons, and Elaine Pagels of the world would probably stand on the side of The Last Temptation as Gospel truth than the canonical Gospels themselves. And that they teach at Catholic universities and take such idea seriously is another story. I know from personal experience.\n\nI think that the complaint that if Mel wanted authenticity he might have hired some experts as consultants is a valid one. I assume that Mel could have found some that share his vision. I think that you see the folks you mention, who clearly do not share his vision, as some sort of threat to the Church. The quotes from some of them at the Catholic league give a hint that they take themselves far too seriously, and haven't fully grasped the limitations of their scholarship. (Oh well, maybe they're still too young for that.) Personally, I do find their work interesting in a variety of senses, but not in the sense of revelation or faith-experience. And I don't see them as especially significant. Perhaps I am too lax about them, but I think it is true that you are the only one who pays them any notice here.\n\nOP\n\nMember\n\nJoined:\n\nPosts: 2,960\n\nQuote\n\nOriginally posted by djs:\n\nPersonally, I do find their work interesting in a variety of senses, but not in the sense of revelation or faith-experience. And I don't see them as especially significant.\n\nYes. Their work is very interesting. They raise many good, if not excellent questions. But one of the problems in current OT and NT biblical studies is that we don't know how they were written. We have what we have and then we have a large pile of theories ... Many in the Church of Academia DO think they are on to something. Unfortunately, their work has not converted many to the faith. Those who do keep one foot in such scholarly work and another in the Church with faith and love are considered 'biased' and their work tainted with that faith element.\n\nQuote\n\nPerhaps I am too lax about them, but I think it is true that you are the only one who pays them any notice here.\n\nI pay them notice because I was in biblical studies. In fact, I still am, but in a different way than attaining \"supplementary\" education in deacon studies, which I am no longer involved with nor care to be. I pay them notice because I know what they are up to.\n\nIn my earlier thread:\n\nhttps://www.byzcath.org/cgibin/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic;f=5;t=000017\n\nI brought up the use of typology in the Scriptures as well as parallels. Those who make a big deal with Matthew 27:25 (\"His blood be on us and on our children\") really don't know the theology behind it. Idiots will make something anti-Semitic about it, but the phrase, djs, harkens back to Jeremiah, the Prophet. Why haven't we heard about this guy in all the fuss over anti-Semitism?\n\nAny ordinary Joe can read the account of the Passion, especially Matthew's, and chapter 26 in Jeremiah and find a good use of parallels. Let's investigate the parallels between Jeremiah and Jesus:\n\nJeremiah 26 // the Passion narratives\n\n\"all the people\" // the crowds\n\n\"You must die!\" // \"He deserves death!\"\n\nofficials // Pilate and the guards\n\nplace at the New Gate // the judgment seat\n\nhouse of the LORD // Praetorium\n\nbring disaster // destroy the Temple\n\nin your hands // Pilate washes his hands\n\nguilt of innocent blood // \"His blood be on us ...\"\n\nfor in truth .. to speak // \"What is truth?\"\n\nthis man // Ecce homo! (Behold, the man!)\n\nshould not die // he is innocent\n\n* was NOT handed over // * was handed over to be crucified\n\nJeremiah prophesied against the city and the Temple // Jesus prophesied against the city and the Temple\n\nthe First Temple was destroyed by Babylonians for their unfaithfulness // the last Temple was destroyed by the Romans\n\nOf course, the Suffering Servant and Psalm 21 and 53 are used ...\n\nBut if there was any punishment for bringing on innocent blood, it was the eventual destruction of the Temple and the City of Jerusalem, which occured in both cases.\n\nThe Gospel message does not imply a condemnation of a race of people in a genetic sort of way. That is twisting Scripture; an abuse.\n\nBut in all the hub-bub about Mel Gibson's movie, there was a failure to address what I just mentioned. Mel was right in stating on his Primetime interview with Diane Sawyer that a few seconds of Matthew 27:25 would not do justice to the theology behind it. It was still there, but in Aramaic; no subtitles.\n\nAll this might sound trivial to some, but I find it important. We can become experts in canon law and liturgical rubrics, including headgear and robe-gear, but fail in opportunities to expound on the message of the Gospel. BTW, there were several scenes in the Passion movie where the priests looked like a bunch of Orthodox bishops! Hmmmmmmmmm.\n\nAs for my biblical studies, I find many believers really interested in it. I have an uncle who is currently contemplating leaving the Catholic Church because he was convinced that our church misled him by covering up all this Mary Magdalena material. He, like many other confused believers, are trying to make sense on how to address the issues. Matthew 27:25 and all the distractions (and anti-Semitic arguments floating around out there in pinheads) keep us from realizing the tradition kept since the Hebrew Scriptures.\n\nMel is NOT the answer in biblical studies, but his movie comes closer than The Last Temptation in giving equal time to a more orthodox-canonical interpretation of those events. I like being a bystander watching how biblical scholars behave when these things happen. They show their true colors and make stupid statements that only reveal the true intent of their scholarly research and publications. We just have to be alerted to that at times.\n\nJoe\n\nMember\n\nJoined:\n\nPosts: 712\n\nQuote\n\nOriginally posted by J Thur:\n\n(1) I even appreciated \"Jesus of Montreal.\"\n\n(2) Mel gets charged for being anti-Semitic for first including something that WAS in the Gospel (cf.

That he was actually a closet-Christian?\n\n(the number editing is mine)\n\n(1) I always figured if Jesus was to return in my lifetime, it would be in my hometown.\n\n(2) The biblical quote condeming the Jews and their progeny for generations was not used (at least I did not hear it). During the crucifixtion of Jesus and the whole time he suffered on the cross there were Jews who were mocking him. The last Temptation makes a clear point of showing that Christ was suffering for all men and the Jews were mocking him.\n\n(3) It's too bad that they believe this to be the real story. I have not heard anyone say that they believe that this is 'the truth'.\n\n(4) Clearly, the whole controversial 'temptation' takes place 'silently' in Christ's thoughts while he is suffering on the cross. Only Jesus and God (maybe satan too) could have been witness to the fictitious 'last temptation'.\n\nI can't understand how the Universities can be teaching this as a 'truth', since there is no prophecy concerning the 'final temptation', and Jesus and God have never made known these fictitious events to man at a later time.\n\n(5) I'm glad Bravo showed it. I would watch it again, and again, and again. I'm sure I would would learn more about the suffering of Christ each time.\n\n(6) Good. If they can help people better understand the teachings of Christ, and perhaps bring some people back to the church I think that the more the better. Eventually they will make their way to the 'Apostolic' version of the life of Jesus, and hopefully they will become Christians.\n\n(7) No - but let's face it, I can't expect most of these people to ever come out of the middle ages either. I have been numerous Muslim countries and say this from conviction. Christianity has come a long way. Christianity attracts people to the faith. Islam puts a knife to their backs and says \"join or else !\"."
