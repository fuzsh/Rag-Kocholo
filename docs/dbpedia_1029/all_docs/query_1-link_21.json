The film \"Jesus of Montreal\" explores the challenges of interpreting Jesus through a theatrical production. A parish priest recruits an actor, Daniel, to create a play about Jesus' life. Daniel and the cast face difficulties in researching Jesus and developing a script that is both artistically compelling and theologically orthodox. Their production uses sources like biblical texts, artworks, and a controversial account of Jesus as the son of a Roman soldier. Through his role, Daniel takes on Christ-like attributes as he brings the cast together and eventually gives life to others through organ donation after his death. The film title reflects how Daniel embodied Jesus through his work and sacrifice.",
