Its intent is to launch an investigative inquiry into how African Americans are represented on screen in various time periods, how we as spectators are manipulated by these cinematic constructions of race, and how race is marked or coded other than through visual representation. Students will view films that deal with “passing” from the various historical periods and will utilize theoretical concepts introduced in class to read these visual representations. Films selected for viewing include the pre-World War II Era, the Civil Rights Era, and the “Post-Racial” era. Students will be required to write three papers that reflect their ability to apply theoretical concepts to reading racialized representations on screen in these three historical periods to demonstrate their understanding of how racial masquerades have evolved over time and continue to persist in contemporary culture.\n\nASIA 57 – 001 First-Year Seminar: Dis-Orienting the Orient\n\nMoWeFr 2:30PM – 3:20PM\n\nDwayne Dixon\n\nExamines how the East is constructed as the Orient in different historical periods: 19th-century European colonialism, 1950s to 1960s Hollywood films, contemporary Japanese animation, and the current global war on terrorism.\n\nASIA 60 – 001 First-Year Seminar: Israeli Culture and Society: Collective Memories and Fragmented Identities\n\nTuTh 11:00AM – 12:15PM\n\nYaron Shemer\n\nThis seminar is oriented toward students who are interested in learning about the culture and society of modern Israel. Specifically, we will examine the transformative power of the early Zionist discourse in the formation of the new State of Israel and the challenges to this discourse in years that followed. Consequently, the emphasis in this class will be on the cultural and social manifestation of the tensions between the creeds of “one nation” and “the melting pot” on the one hand, and the reiteration of ethnic, gender, and religious identities on the other. The first five sessions will provide contextual and background accounts for later discussions. Then, until the middle of the semester, the seminar will focus on various arenas of Israeli culture, past and present. The second part of the semester will be devoted to selected themes and case studies pertinent to culture and society in modern Israel.\n\nStudents may also register for this course under JWST 60-001.\n\nENGL 53 – 001 First-Year Seminar: Slavery and Freedom in African American Literature and Film\n\nMoWeFr 2:30PM – 3:20PM\n\nDanielle Christmas\n\nThe seminar’s purpose is to explore the African American slave narrative tradition from its 19th-century origins in autobiography to its present manifestations in prize-winning fiction and film.\n\nENGL 59 – 001 First-Year Seminar: Black Masculinity and Femininity\n\nMoWeFr 2:30PM – 3:20PM\n\nTyree Daye\n\nThis first year seminar will use literature, film, and popular culture to explore different expressions of masculinity and femininity in the African American and Black diasporic context. Students will evaluate how artists use gender and sexuality for social critique and artistic innovation.\n\nRELI 70 – 001 First-Year Seminar: Jesus in Scholarship and Film\n\nTuTh 11:00AM – 12:15PM\n\nBart Ehrman\n\nThis seminar will examine how historians have reconstructed the life, teachings and death of the historical Jesus. We will look at the Gospels of the New Testament, as well as references to Jesus in other writings (Roman and Jewish sources, as well as Gospels that did not make it into the New Testament). In addition, we will explore how Jesus has been portrayed in modern film, including such Biblical ¿epics¿ as The Greatest Story Ever Told, such ¿period pieces¿ as Jesus Christ Superstar, such brilliant retellings as Jesus of Montreal and such controversial films as The Last Temptation of Christ and The Passion of the Christ. The ultimate goals of the seminar are to see what we can say about the historical man Jesus himself and how Jesus came to be portrayed in both ancient sources and modern imagination.\n\nGENERAL COURSE LIST\n\nAAAD 202 – 001 African Film and Performance\n\nMoWe 3:30PM – 4:45PM\n\nSamba Camara\n\nThis course examines the misrepresentation of Africa and Africans in western colonial films and how African filmmaking and performing have responded to the colonialist narrative.\n\nAAAD 250 – 001 The African American in Motion Pictures: 1900 to the Present\n\nTu 3:30PM – 6:20PM\n\nCharlene Regester\n\nThis course will analyze the role of the African American in motion pictures, explore the development of stereotypical portrayals, and investigate the efforts of African American actors and actresses to overcome these portrayals.\n\nARAB 337 – 001 Borders and Walls in the Arab World\n\nTu 5:00PM – 8:00PM\n\nNadia Yaqub\n\nCan art, film, and literature undo cultural, social, and political divisions created by borders and walls in the Arab world?\n\nARTH 159 – 001 The Film Experience: Introduction to the Visual Study of Film\n\nMoWe 3:35PM – 4:25PM\n\nJJ Bauer\n\nA critical and historical introduction to film from a visual arts perspective. The course surveys the history of film from its inception to the present, drawing upon both foreign and American traditions.\n\nARTS 209 – 001 2D Animation\n\nMoWe 8:00AM – 10:45AM\n\nSabine Gruffat\n\nPrerequisite, ARTS 104. This class explores several techniques of 2D character animation, including storyboarding and conceptualizing, pencil testing and timing animation, animating simple sequences with Photoshop, experimenting with coloring and materials under a film camera, and compositing in After Effects.\n\nARTS 657 – 001 Movie Making Machines: Learning About Cinema in the Maker Space\n\nMoWe 9:05AM – 10:45AM\n\nStaff\n\nPrerequisite, ARTS 105, 106, 209, or COMM 130; permission of the instructor for students lacking the prerequisite. This projects-based seminar will introduce students to the fundamental optical and technological principles of motion pictures. By using the Maker Space to design and fabricate pinhole cameras, zoetropes, and 16mm film strips, students will gain a deep understanding of the material and technological foundations of the cinema, and the operating principles that are behind not only the classic films of Hollywood’s past, but the high-definition digital imaging technologies of the present.\n\nASIA 231 – 001 Bollywood Cinema\n\nTuTh 5:00PM – 6:15PM\n\nAfroz Taj\n\nThis course explores the development of the Indian cinema, with particular emphasis on the Hindi-Urdu films produced in Mumbai (Bollywood).\n\nASIA 235 – 001 Israeli Cinema: Gender, Nation, and Ethnicity\n\nTuTh 2:00PM – 3:15PM\n\nYaron Shemer\n\nThe course explores major periods and trends in Israeli cinema. Focus is given to issues pertaining to gender, ethnicity, and the construction of national identity.\n\nASIA 427 – 001 Cold War Culture in East Asia: Transnational and Intermedial Connections\n\nTuTh 3:30PM – 4:45PM\n\nI Jonathan Kief\n\nThis course introduces students to the specific contours that the Cold War accrued in East Asia. Focusing on literature and film, it explores what the fall of the Japanese Empire and the emergence of the post-1945 world meant across the region.\n\nCMPL 143 – 001 History of Global Cinema\n\nMoWe 9:05AM – 9:55AM\n\nMartin Johnson\n\nEver since Auguste and Louis Lumière sent their cinematograph on a world tour in 1896, the cinema has been global. At each stop, from St. Petersburg to Mexico City, from Melbourne to New York, the Lumière company shot as well as exhibited films, producing a catalogue of views from 31 countries. In this course, we will consider the original Lumière vision of a truly global cinema, one that accommodates a diversity of cultures in a medium that has enduring worldwide appeal. While we will conduct a broad historical overview of the cinema, our approach will focus on paradigmatic shifts in the medium. In this course, you will be exposed to\n\na wide range of moving images, crossing nations, genres, modes of production, people, and cultures. At the same time, we will cover the fundamental components of the history of the medium as it has been observed, critiqued, experienced, proselytized, studied, and debated. Assignments include four short papers, a midterm exam, and a final exam. This course satisfies both the Visual & Performing Arts (VP) and the Global Issues (GL) general education requirements. It is also a core component of the Film Studies major within English and Comparative Literature, as well as the Global Cinema Minor.\n\nNOTE: All course lectures will be recorded in advance, and available via the course Sakai site. The Monday class meeting time will be optional, reserved for questions and informal discussion. On most Tuesday evenings, we will have a live “shared screening” of a feature-length film, or a program of short films, using a GroupMe chat group to discuss the films while we watch. While you are expected to watch these assigned films, participation in the screening is optional.\n\nDuring the Wednesday class meeting time, we will have a live, participatory lecture, focusing on clips from the films discussed in the week’s prerecorded lectures and readings. You can elect to participate asynchronously in both the lecture and discussion sections.\n\nCMPL 232 – 001 Imagining the City in Modern Korea: Text, Image, Space\n\nTuTh 11:00AM – 12:15PM\n\nI Jonathan Kief\n\nThis course introduces students to modern Korea through the lens of the city. It explores the changing shape of urban space on the Korean peninsula as well as the central role that visions of the city and of city life have played in the development of modern Korean literature, television, and film.\n\nCMPL 240 – 001 Introduction to Film Theory\n\nTuTh 12:30PM – 1:45PM\n\nInga Pollmann\n\nThis course introduces students to debates in classical and post-classical film theory. Likely topics include medium specificity; the ideological functions of narrative cinema; film theory’s investments in psychoanalysis, linguistics, semiotics, and phenomenology; the advent of digital media; feminism; national and transnational cinema; spectatorship; authorship; genre theory; and film and philosophy.\n\nCMPL 254 – 001 Horror and the Global Gothic: Film, Literature, Theory\n\nMoWeFr 2:30PM – 3:20PM\n\nGuillermo Rodriguez\n\nThis course traces the development of horror in film and writing from the 18th-century European novel to contemporary Asian film. Theoretical readings will embrace a range of disciplines, from literary and film theory to anthropology, feminism and gender studies, and psychoanalysis.\n\nCMPL 463 – 001 Cinema and Surrealism\n\nTuTh 2:00PM – 3:15PM\n\nRick Warner\n\nWhile focusing on cinema, this course will examine the emergence of surrealism as an inter-art movement in the years between the two World Wars of the 20th century. Our discussions will begin by considering the avant-garde origins of surrealism in France. From there, we will trace the aesthetic, political, and philosophical legacy of surrealism in contemporary international film and television. To some extent, we will compare surrealist cinema to surrealist developments in painting, literature, and photography, observing how surrealism’s historical evolution has been an intermedial project. We will cover a variety of genres and production modes along the way, including experimental shorts, animated films, documentaries, art films, and even Hollywood feature films. We will see how surrealism has continually reinvented itself, making its way into thrillers, comedies, horror, science fiction, and other popular genres (the relationship between surrealism and horror will be a key thread). Several theorists will guide our conversations, from leading surrealist intellectuals themselves (such as André Breton and Georges Bataille) to later critics devoted to reconsidering the importance of surrealism (such as Walter Benjamin). We will continually try to describe not only the mental and conceptual conundrums of surrealism but also the emotional, visceral, and multisensorial effects of surrealism. To that end, we’ll consult texts from Sigmund Freud’s “The Uncanny,” to Mark Fisher’s The Weird and the Eerie, through to phenomenological film theories that emphasize the affective, tactile, and atmospheric dimensions of spectatorship. Our study of surrealism will also take us into ecological matters, theories of the posthuman, and queer theory. We will also examine the rise of Afro-Surrealism and its challenge to established canons of surrealism that marginalize Black experience. Our purpose will be to work toward an understanding of surrealist cinema that is flexible enough to accommodate its many mutations over time, but firm enough to retain for it a special significance not to be confused with the merely bizarre. Our conversations will become increasingly philosophical as both films and critical texts force us to question many of the basic assumptions at the heart of our habitual ways of thinking and perceiving: the binary distinctions between self and other, mind and body, subject and object, human and animal, animate and inanimate, rational and irrational, dream and reality, and so forth.\n\nNote: graduate students in the class will have different requirements. In short, while doing the basic work of the course, you will undertake a more independent project in line with your own research interests. You will have 3-5 additional class meetings during the semester with the other graduate students in the class and the instructor. You will write just one paper of 20-25 pages in length, the goal being to come away from the class with a piece of writing that will serve you in some other capacity, either as a potential publication or dissertation chapter. You will also have the opportunity to give a guest lecture that concerns your research topic.\n\nNote: some of the films shown in this course contain disturbing and provocative scenes. This content is essential to the films and to the course as a whole. Please enroll only if you plan to engage with such representations in a serious, critical manner.\n\nCMPL 490 – 001 Word and Image\n\nWe 4:40PM – 7:10PM\n\nGregory Flaxman\n\nThis course concerns the relation between writing and visuality. Of course, writing is already an image, and we’ll broadly consider the relation of image and text, but the class will also use this intersection to reflect on how to write about images. In this regard, we’ll read a number of art historians, film and media scholars, and philosophers who’ve sought to invent not only new ways to conceptualize images but, even more integrally, new styles to express images. In turn, these occasions will provide the impetus for students to think about their own writing. Readings for the class will likely includes works by Susan Sontag, Svetlana Alpers, André Bazin, James Baldwin, Michael Fried, Stanley Cavell, Paulin Kael, E.H. Gombrich, Robert Hughes, Anne Carson, Nelson Goodman, Wassily Kandinsky, Leo Steinberg, and Susan Stewart.

While closely examining films from Japan, China, and South Korea, the course will consider both the advantages and complex problems that present themselves when trying to define and interpret films with regard to the category of nation. We will read several arguments that question and even dismantle the very concept of nation in a globalized world where cultural, economic, political, and aesthetic factors increasingly demand a transnational framework. Our investigation begins with post-World War II Japanese cinema, then moves to focus on three somewhat distinct yet interrelated national cinemas in China: Mainland, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. Our final units in the course will be devoted to contemporary South Korean cinema in the wake of its “new wave” at the turn of the century. Along the way, we will consider multiple genres (horror, melodrama, mystery, martial arts, crime films, animation) and shift between popular and arthouse films. One of the recurring threads in the course will be a consideration of the vastly different speeds and rhythms that make up the stylistic traditions of East Asian cinema, from slow-paced, contemplative arthouse films to hyperkinetic action films.\n\nNote: some of the films shown in this course contain disturbing and provocative scenes.
