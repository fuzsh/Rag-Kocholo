May we have the grace to be able to appropriate them, and to expound them in our lives!\n\nOh, the dignity which Christ has put upon the meanest believer! What a high office, and, consequently, what a solemn responsibility is ours!\n\nYe are a chosen generation - Hear this, ye believers, drink in this precious truth. See God’s election, making you to be a people born of the Holy Ghost: “a chosen generation,”-\n\nThere is the contrast between the disobedient and all true believer. “Ye” have the chosen Savior to be the chief corner-stone, upon whom “ye” who are living stones are to be built up into “a spiritual house,” which is to be the abiding place of the Most High God. (1 Peter 2 Commentary)\n\nChosen (1588) (eklektos) is a word which ultimately speaks of the grace of God. It should be emphasized that the proper conclusion (interpretation of the meaning) of \"chosen\" (eklektos) in each NT use depends on the context.\n\nEklektos means those selected or picked out and in the Scripture usually defines one who is the object of choice or of divine favor. Although it is difficult to understand with finite minds, it is important to note that the fact that some are chosen does not imply the rejection of those not chosen. God does not predestine some to eternal death.\n\nIn the Old Testament God did not choose Israel because they were a great people, but because He loved them. Moses instructed Israel to separate from and even destroy the pagan influences around them when they entered the promised land, the reason being that…\n\nyou are a holy people to the LORD your God; the LORD your God has chosen you to be a people for His own possession (\"a peculiar people\" - Lxx uses periousios, same word used in Titus 2:14 click for that discussion) out of all the peoples who are on the face of the earth. The LORD did not set His love on you nor choose you because you were more in number than any of the peoples, for you were the fewest of all peoples, but because the LORD loved you and kept the oath which He swore to your forefathers, the LORD brought you out by a mighty hand, and redeemed you from the house of slavery, from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt. (Deuteronomy 7:6-8)\n\nThe concept of God's choosing a \"race\" is seen again when Moses addressing Israel explaining that…\n\non your fathers did the LORD set His affection to love them, and He chose their descendants after them, even you above all peoples, as it is this day. (Deuteronomy 10:15)\n\nThe Psalmist writes\n\nBlessed is the nation whose God is the LORD, the people whom He has chosen for His own (whose?) inheritance. (Psalm 33:12). Spurgeon's Comment on Psalm 33:12\n\nIsrael was happy in the worship of the only true God. It was the blessedness of the chosen nation to have received a revelation from Jehovah. While others grovelled before their idols, the chosen people were elevated by a spiritual religion which introduced them to the invisible God, and led them to trust in Him. All who confide in the Lord are blessed in the largest and deepest sense, and none can reverse the blessing.\n\nAnd the people whom He hath chosen for His own inheritance. Election is at the bottom of it all. The divine choice rules the day; none take Jehovah to be their God till He takes them to be His people. What an ennobling choice this is! We are selected to no mean estate, and for no ignoble purpose: we are made the peculiar domain and delight of the Lord our God. Being so blessed, let us rejoice in our portion, and show the world by our lives that we serve a glorious Master.\n\nJesus declared\n\nYou did not choose Me, but I chose you, and appointed you (our privilege), that you should go and bear fruit (our purpose, our responsibility), and that your fruit should remain, that whatever you ask of the Father in My name, He may give to you. (Jn 15:16).\n\nChristians are not \"better\" people than any other man or woman but they are \"blessed\" people. As such they are a distinct \"kind\" of human being, almost like a separate \"genetic variety\". They have been specially \"chosen\" by God for His own very specific purposes. Their privilege as the chosen also brings responsibility. A child of the King of kings should bear a family likeness, so that others will come to know Him as the King of kings.\n\nRace (1085) (genos from gínomai = become) refers to offspring, posterity, \"kin\", family or lineage, stock. The NT frequently uses genos (as in the present verse) to refer to a race or division of mankind possessing traits that are transmissible by descent (Who's line do you belong to - Adam's or Christ's?) and sufficient to characterize it as a distinct human type. Believers should be recognizable as \"a distinct human type\". Race defines a class or kind of people unified by community of interests, habits, or characteristics.\n\nMatthew Henry writes that…\n\nAll true Christians are a chosen generation; they all make one family, a sort and species of people distinct from the common world, of another spirit, principle, and practice, which they could never be if they were not chosen in Christ to be such, and sanctified by His Spirit.\n\nA ROYAL PRIESTHOOD: basileion hierateuma:\n\nEx 19:5,6; Isa 66:21\n\n1 Peter 2 Resources - Multiple Sermons and Commentaries\n\nAPPOINTED TO A\n\nPRIVILEGED POSITION\n\nPeter's concept of a royal priesthood originates from Exodus 19 Jehovah declared to Moses His message for Israel…\n\nNow then, if you will indeed obey My voice and keep My covenant, then you shall be My own possession (peculiar treasure - KJV) among all the peoples, for all the earth is Mine; and you shall be to Me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation.' These are the words that you shall speak to the sons of Israel.\" (Ex 19:5,6)\n\nRoyal Priesthood - Guzik writes that \"The offices of royalty and priesthood were jealously separated in Israel, but Jesus, who is our King and Priest, has brought them together for His people.\"\n\nSpurgeon - “Ye” are to be like Melchisedec, in whom the two offices of priest and king were combined in one person. More then that, “ye” are to be like your Lord, in respect to his royal priesthood. That he should have “loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood, and made us kings and priests unto God and his Father,” seems to be an honor which is far too high for us. It appears to bring us almost too near our Lord, yet it is not So, for Peter wrote, under divine inspiration, “Ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood,” (1 Peter 2 Commentary)\n\nRoyal (934) (basileios) is used only here and refers to that which belongs to, is appointed to or is suitable for a king. The idea is \"fit for a king\". It describes one of of kingly ancestry or that which is relating to, or befitting a king, queen, or other monarch. This verse is the only NT use of basileios, which is found in the Septuagint (LXX) translation of Exodus 19:6 (quoted in part by Peter) and Exodus 23:22.\n\nMacArthur writes that basileios \"generally describes a royal residence or palace (cf. Luke 7:25), but it can also refer to a sovereignty or monarchy\n\nMoulton and Milligan have found it used in the phrase \"the palace of the satrap Saitaphernes.\n\nWhat an incredible privilege NT believers possess in Christ. In the OT, even the kings of Israel did not serve as a priest, and the one who tried was judged by God (read about it in 2 Chronicles 26:16-21). No so for NT believers who are of royal lineage in Christ the King of kings.\n\nPriesthood (2406) (hierateuma from hierateúo = to officiate as a priest; used only here and in 1Peter 2:5) describes the priesthood as a fraternity or as a body of priests. The spiritual house he mentioned in 1 Peter 2:5+ turns out to be a royal house, the dominion of a royal family.\n\nPeter says all Christians are priests to God \"a holy priesthood (who can now) offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ. (see notes 1 Peter 2:4-6)\n\nOur holy priesthood is made possible by our “great High Priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God” (Hebrews 4:14+), therefore we have complete and full access to the Father. \"Let us therefore come boldly to the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need. (Heb 4:16+).\n\nLater in his epistle the writer of Hebrews adds this exhortation - Since therefore, brethren, we have confidence to enter the holy place by the blood of Jesus, by a new and living way which He inaugurated for us through the veil, that is, His flesh, and since we have a great priest over the house of God, let us draw near with a sincere heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled clean from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water. (Heb 10:19-22- notes Heb 10:19; 20; 21; 22) (Comment: NT believers are not to go to God through any other human, but only through the one Mediator, Jesus Christ [see 1 Ti 2:1-8+] Who is forever seated at the right hand of God in glory, interceding for us.)\n\nYou may be saying \"It's wonderful to be a royal priest.\" but this truth has little impact on your life. Although believers look like everyone else, our speech and actions should cause others to ask, \"What's different about her, about him?\"\n\nAlthough speaking to the remnant of Israel who would be saved by faith in Messiah, Gentile believers are now included in Jehovah's promise that…\n\nyou will be called the priests of the LORD. You will be spoken of as ministers of our God. You will eat the wealth of nations, and in their riches you will boast. (Isaiah 61:6)\n\nIn the NT John writes that Christ…\n\nhas made us to be a kingdom, priests to His God and Father; to Him be the glory and the dominion forever and ever. Amen. (Rev 1:6+)\n\nThou hast made them (men from every tribe and tongue and people and nation) to be a kingdom and priests to our God; and they will reign upon the earth (THAT IS, ON THE EARTH IN THE MILLENNIUM KINGDOM OF CHRIST). (Revelation 5:10+)\n\nAnd not only are we priests today with access to the King, but one day soon in the coming kingdom of Christ we will reign with Him for 1000 years (see Millennium) John exclaiming…\n\nBlessed and holy is the one who has a part in the first resurrection; over these the second death has no power, but they will be priests of God and of Christ and will reign with Him for a thousand years. (Rev 20:6+)\n\nIn God's eyes we are royalty!\n\nHave you pondered the privilege you have\n\nto be counted as a member of God's royal family?\n\nThis is a far greater privilege than even belonging to the British royal line, although we often lose this eternal perspective. Indeed, what a privilege but also what a responsibility! Every day we represent \"the King of kings\" Who is the \"ruler over the kings of the earth\" (Rev 1:6+). Let us determine that our conduct demonstrates our \"royal bloodline\" and gives a proper opinion to the \"commoners\" of our King Who desires to also be their king!\n\nA child of the King of kings\n\nshould bear a family likeness.\n\nTHE CHOICE OF GRACE - James Smith\n\n\"According as He hath chosen us in Him\" (Eph. 1:4).\n\n1. Who? \"He hath,\" 2 Thess. 2:13.\n\n2. What? \"Chosen us.\"\n\n3. How? \"In Him.\"\n\n4. When? \"Before the foundation of the world.\"\n\n5. What for? \"That we should be holy\" (1 Peter 2:9; Phil. 2:15).\n\nEVIDENCES OF SALVATION. - James Smith\n\n\"That ye may know that ye have\" (1 John 5:13).\n\nThose who are in the enjoyment of salvation show it—\n\n1. By praising God for it, 1 Peter 2:9.\n\n2. By abhorring themselves, Job 42:5, 6.\n\n3. By delighting in prayer, Acts 9:11.\n\n4. By thirsting for the Word of God, Psa. 19:10.\n\n5. By seeking to please the Lord, Col. 1:10.\n\n6. By bringing others to Him, John 1:40-42.\n\nLiving Like Royalty - In the fall of 1997, I had my first closeup look at royalty. Zeeland, Michigan, the small Dutch town where I was born, was celebrating its 150th anniversary, and Princess Margriet and her husband honored the city with an official visit from the Netherlands.\n\nHer Highness looked regal in her crisp red suit as she walked behind the wooden-shoed Klompen dancers and smiled and waved to the crowd. She moved with a quiet gracefulness and dignity. But without her entourage and a police escort, she could have passed for just another Zeelander blending into the crowd.\n\nBelievers in Jesus Christ are also royalty. We have been spiritually reborn into the family of the King of the universe. Peter called us a “royal priesthood” (1 Pet. 2:9). John declared that through Christ’s sacrifice on the cross we are “kings and priests to His God and Father” (Rev. 1:6).\n\nWe may look like everyone else, but as Christians our speech and our actions should cause others to ask, “What’s different about her, about him?” We’re royalty, of course! What a privilege to be members of God’s royal family. What a responsibility! Every day we represent One who is the “ruler over the kings of the earth” (Rev. 1:5). Let’s make sure our conduct shows it. - Dennis J. De Haan (Reprinted by permission from Our Daily Bread Ministries. Please do not repost the full devotional without their permission.)\n\nFor Further Study\n\nIf we are to live like God's royal priesthood,\n\nwhat behavior should we put aside? (1Pet. 2:1,11).\n\nWhat things should we do? (1Pe 2:2,12).\n\nA child of the King of kings should bear a family likeness.\n\nA HOLY NATION: ethnos hagion:\n\nPs 106:5; Isa 26:2; Jn 17:19; 1Cor 3:17; 2Ti 1:9\n\nTorrey's Topic Titles and names of saints\n\n1 Peter 2 Resources - Multiple Sermons and Commentaries\n\nSET APART\n\nFOR GOD\n\nPeter is quoting from Exodus 19:6 where God says to Israel \" you shall be to Me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation.’ These are the words that you shall speak to the sons of Israel.” God had commanded Israel to \"to make a distinction between the holy and the profane, and between the unclean and the clean\" (Lev 10:10) but they refused to be different and thus disobeyed God. Israel forgot that she was holy unto the LORD, and that her holy privilege conveyed responsibility to be holy as God was holy. She began to make profane choices that broke down the walls of separation that made her special and distinct. By using this phrase HOLY NATION Peter is reminding the believers that they are to be separate from the world. While he does not continue the analogy with the nation of Israel, we know that because Israel did not maintain her separateness from the profane, godless world, it cost her dearly with national defeats by foreign nations (722 BC Assyrians and 586 BC Babylonians). Israel proceeded to become like all the corrupt idolatrous pagan nations around them and this profaning ultimately led to their loss of usefulness to God and to their destruction (but not to their annihilation). So Peter's emphasis is for the church to be holy. As someone has well said \"The body of Christ, the church, is of most value to God when it is least like the world in which it exists to be an ambassador of reconciliation.\"\n\n\"More holiness give me,\n\nMore strivings within;\n\nMore patience in suff'ring,\n\nMore sorrow for sin;\n\nMore faith in my Saviour,\n\nMore sense of His care;\n\nMore joy in His service,\n\nMore purpose in prayer.\"\n\n—P. P. Bliss.\n\nJohn MacArthur on HOLY NATION - \"Peter continued to refer to the Old Testament in support of the privileges God has granted believers. Here he alludes to Exodus 19:6 (“you shall be to Me … a holy nation”) when he declares that believers are separated to Christ as a holy nation. The word nation translates ethnos, which means “people,” as an ethnic group (Luke 7:5; 23:2; John 11:48, 50–52; Acts 2:5; 10:22; Rev. 5:9). Holy (hagios) means “separate” or “set apart.” It was common in the Old Testament to call God’s covenant people a holy nation (cf. Lev. 19:2; 20:26; Deut. 7:6; Isa. 62:12). However, because of sin and unbelief Israel forfeited (Deut. 4:27; 28:64; Ezek. 16:59; Hos. 9:17; Zech. 7:14; Rom. 11:17, 20) her great privilege (Gen. 12:2–3; Deut. 33:29; Rom. 3:1–2; 9:4–5) of being God’s unique people. But what was a tragedy for Israel became a blessing for believing Gentiles (cf. Rom. 9–11). Israel will not enjoy again the privilege of being God’s holy people until the nation finally turns in faith to the Messiah (cf. Ezek. 36:25–31; Rom. 11:24, 26). God sets apart believers primarily to have a relationship with Him, and service to Him flows out of that relationship. (1 Peter Commentary) (See also MacArthur's sermon - 1 Peter 2:9 The Believer's Privileges = Separation, etc Pt 6 - Sermon)\n\nHiebert - Peter’s third designation, “a holy nation” (ethnos hagion), is also drawn directly from Exodus 19:6. “Nation” (ethnos, cf. the English “ethnic”) means a community of people held together by the same laws, customs, and mutual interests. The term, as Morgan notes, involves “two ideas, those of government and mutual interrelationship.” It is a common biblical term, especially in the plural, “for the Gentiles as distinct from the Jews or Christians.” At times the term was also used of Israel as the people of God united by their covenantal relation to Him, making them distinctly His nation. It is in that latter sense that Peter applied the term to the church, which forms a unique international nation having a common spiritual life from God and committed to His rule. “Holy” indicates its separation from the nations of the world and consecration to God and His service. Its position of separation demands that the members must not, like Israel of old, stoop to the sinful practices of the world (1 Peter 1:15–17). (1 Peter Commentary)\n\nJ Vernon McGee on HOLY NATION - We are “an holy nation.” The nation Israel was never holy in conduct, and the same can be said of the church. Israel’s failure is glaring; the church’s failure is appalling. Yet we are holy in our relationship with Him because Christ is our righteousness. If you have any standing before God, it is not in yourself; it is in Christ. I can’t think of anything more wonderful than that today I stand complete in Him. What a joy it is to be a member of a holy nation, which is a new nation in the world today. (Thru the Bible)\n\nJack Arnold - “A HOLY NATION” - This is a quote from Exodus 19:6. “Nation” refers to a multitude of people of the same nature. “Holy” means “to set apart” or “to consecrate.” Christians form a spiritual nation of people set apart to God. “Therefore I say to you, the kingdom of God will be taken away from you (Israel) and be given to a nation (Church) producing the fruit of it” (Matt 21:43). Christians are in every physical nation on earth and spiritually they now form a distinct, holy, superior nation. The universal Church is a supernatural people because it was brought into existence by supernatural acts of God. Because Christians are a supernatural people belonging to God, they are pilgrims and strangers among the earthly nations. The universal Church of Christ is also supra-national. It transcends all political, economic, military and cultural differences. The Church has a King to rule over them, Jesus Christ. It has laws to govern them, the Bible. It has a national purpose—to glorify God. It also has a national anthem, “Saved, saved by the blood of the Lamb.” (1 Peter 2:9-12 Duties of Aliens and Strangers)\n\nSpurgeon - An holy nation, a peculiar people - You have national privileges. God reckons you not as a mob or a herd of men, but as a nation, and a nation with this peculiar hall-mark upon you, that you are “a holy nation.” This is the true token of your nationality that you are “holiness unto the Lord,” “a peculiar people” belonging to God alone, marked off from the rest of mankind as peculiarly his. You are not, and you are not to be as other men are, you are “a peculiar people.” Your road is not the broad one where the many go, it is the narrow one which the few find, your happiness is not worldly pleasure, but pleasures at the right hand of God which are for evermore, You are “a peculiar people” (1 Peter 2 Commentary)\n\nRegarding the words nation (ethnos) and people (laos) Vincent remarks that \"The distinction between these three words cannot be closely pressed. Race emphasizes the idea of descent; nation, of community. Laos, people, occurring very often in the Septuagint, is used there mostly of the Israelites, the chosen people. The same use is also frequent in the New Testament; but it is employed in a more general sense, as by Luke 2:10. (Vincent, M. R. Word Studies in the New Testament)\n\nPeter H Davids on HOLY NATION - Furthermore, they are a “holy nation.” The idea is not their moral holiness (although it is a call to that; cf. 1 Peter 1:15–16), but their separation to God. God has set Christians apart to be his people just as Israel was in the OT. This is underlined in the final phrase, “God’s own people” or “the people of his possession,” which indicates that they belong particularly to him (indeed, he has bought them, 1 Peter 1:18; cf. Acts 20:28+, which uses the same Greek verb). (NICNT-1 Peter)\n\nDavid Walls - A holy nation emphasizes that God has set apart the church for his use and that individual believers have a valuable contribution to make to his church.\n\nNorman Hillyer - As members of a holy nation, all believers are set apart for God (the sense of holy), but without geographic boundaries or without being limited to particular cultures, ages, or ethnic groups.\n\nThomas Schreiner - Peter also replicated the exact words of Exod 19:6 in identifying the church as a “holy nation” (ethnos hagion; cf. Exod 23:22, LXX). The church of Jesus is a people now set apart for the Lord, enjoying his special presence and favor. (NAC - 1 Peter)\n\nHoly (40) (hagios = set apart ones, separated ones, sanctified ones, holy ones) is literally a holy one and depending on the context refers to whoever or whatever is set apart (sanctified) for a special purpose.\n\nNew Testament believers are holy ones both in character and conduct having been set apart by God to be exclusively His, to be dedicated to Him and to manifest holiness of heart and conduct in contrast to the impurity of pagan unbelievers.\n\nJesus declared…\n\nAnd for their sakes I sanctify (set Myself apart unto God) Myself, that they themselves also may be sanctified (may be set apart for holy service to God) in truth. (Jn 17:19) (NLT renders it \"And I give myself entirely to you so they also might be entirely yours.\")\n\nPaul writes…\n\nTo the church of God that is in Corinth, to those sanctified (set apart) in Christ Jesus, called (with a purpose) to be saints (hagios - holy ones) together with all those who in every place call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, both their Lord and ours: (1Cor 1:2)\n\nHebrews explains that…\n\nBy this will (the Father's will) we have been sanctified (set apart, made holy) through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all. (see note Hebrews 10:10)\n\nComment: Sanctified is in the perfect tense which speaks of a past completed action -- the moment of our salvation -- with permanent or lasting effect --we are forever set apart). As an aside, the permanence of this tense undergirds the NT teaching that the believer once saved is eternally secure. Believers will never need to be justified again. Their position in Christ is forever righteous, forever secure and forever holy.\n\nIn the Old Testament many things and people were divinely set apart by God for His own purposes. The Tabernacle and Temple and all their furnishings-supremely the Ark of the Covenant and the holy of holies-were set apart to Him. The tribe of Levi was set apart for His priesthood, and the entire nation of Israel was set apart as His people. The tithes and offerings of the people of Israel consisted of money and other gifts specifically set apart for God. Under the New Covenant, however, such holy things as the Temple, priesthood, Ark, and tithes no longer exist. God’s only truly holy things on earth today are His people, those whom He has sovereignly and graciously set apart for Himself through Jesus Christ. The new temple of God and the new priesthood of God are His church, which Peter here refers to figuratively as a holy nation.\n\nHagios is used throughout the New Testament to speak of anyone or anything that represents God’s holiness: Christ as the Holy One of God, the Holy Spirit, the Holy Father, holy Scriptures, holy angels, holy brethren, and so on. The secular and pagan use pictured a person separated and dedicated to the idolatrous \"gods\" and carried no idea of moral or spiritual purity. The manmade gods were as sinful and degraded as the men who made them and there simply was no need for a word that represented righteousness! The worshipper of the pagan god acquired the character of that pagan god and the religious ceremonies connected with its worship. The Greek temple at Corinth housed a large number of harlots who were connected with the \"worship\" of the Greek god. Thus, the set-apartness or holiness of the Greek worshipper was in character licentious, totally depraved, and sinful.\n\nThe Bible writers could not coin new terms since they would not be understood, and were therefore forced to use those already in use. However, while the technical and root meanings of this pagan religious term was taken over by the writers, yet by the use in the NT, the moral and spiritual character was changed and elevated by the gospel.\n\nKenneth Wuest writes that \"The believer in the Lord Jesus is set apart for God by the Holy Spirit, out of the First Adam with the latter’s sin and condemnation, into the Last Adam (Christ) with the latter’s righteousness and life. Thus, the worshipper of the God of the Bible partakes of the character of the God for Whom he is set apart. This is positional sanctification, an act of God performed at the moment a sinner puts his faith in the Lord Jesus (1Co 1:2+). The work of the Holy Spirit in the yielded saint, in which He sets the believer apart for God in his experience, by eliminating sin from his life and producing His fruit, a process which goes on constantly throughout the believer’s life, is called progressive sanctification (see 1Thessalonians 5:23-note). When our Lord sanctifies Himself, He sets Himself apart for God as the Sacrifice for sin (Jn 17:19 see He 10:7-note).\" (Wuest Word Studies - Eerdman Publishing Company Volume 1, Volume 2, Volume 3 - used by permission)\n\nThe idea inherent in hagios is the taking something filthy, washing it and setting it apart as something brand new, useful for a different purpose, which is a picture of salvation for we who were filthy with sin were washed in the blood of Christ, the Lamb of God, and set apart to now be God's own possession.\n\nBelievers are now a holy nation who have been set apart from the world…\n\ndelivered (rescued)… from the domain of darkness (Colossians 1:11, 12, 13+)…\n\nby the sanctifying work of the Spirit (1 Peter 1:2+)…\n\nunto God Who \"transferred us to the kingdom of His beloved Son\" (Colossians 1:13-see note Col 1:13)\n\nThe fundamental ideas of a saint include…\n\nOne who is separated from sin (Romans 6:11; 12; 13; 14-see notes Ro 6:11; 12; 13; 14)\n\nOne who then has the responsibility to choose to consecrate themselves daily to God as \"living sacrifices\" (Romans 12:1-see note Romans 12:1)\n\nOne who is devoted to His service\n\nOne who is a partaker of the divine nature (2Pe 1:4+)\n\nOne who continually chooses to abstain from worldly defilement (1Th 4:3+, 1Th 5:22+, 2Ti 2:19+, 1Pe 2:11+)\n\nAlthough the saint lives in the world, he or she must always in one sense be different from the world and continually choose to separate himself or herself from the world. His standards are not the world's standards. (click note on Romans 12:2 regarding not being squeezed into world's mold) He is \"in the world\" but not \"of the world\".\n\nA saint is like a boat -- the boat's purpose is fulfilled when it is in the water, but it's function and usefulness deteriorates when water gets in the boat. So too for saints when too much of the world gets into them. Saints must keep their \"vessels\" in the water of this word but not let the water of the world get into their \"vessel\"! Paul has a parallel thought writing to young Timothy to take of the truth that\n\nif a man cleanses himself from these (things, people that have an unholy influence), he will be a vessel for honor, sanctified (hagiazo - verb form of saint), useful to the Master, prepared for every good work. (see note 2 Timothy 2:21)\n\nThe term saints does it refer to a condition after death, for these \"saints\" were very much alive at Philippi. Although you may have been taught that saints are a special, higher order of Christians who accomplished extraordinary good deeds and lived an exemplary life, the Bible teaches that sainthood is not an attainment but a state into which God by grace through faith calls men and women of all stations of life, whether under the Old or New Covenant. So now next time you meet a believer, address then as \"Saint so-and-so\" and watch the reaction! It goes without saying however that we often do not think or act like saints, in the popular sense. But hagios speaks of our identity (or our position) in Christ. We are holy ones in our Lord, even when we are unfaithful and act unsaintly. Being a saint has nothing at all to do with one’s degree of spiritual maturity or rank. It refers to any person who is saved, who is set apart by God for Himself in His Son Jesus Christ. Because God sees us as He sees His Son, as \"those who have been sanctified (consecrated, purified, made holy) in Christ Jesus, saints by calling.\" (1Co 1:2) Like all other believers, the Christians at Corinth were not saints because of their spiritual maturity (cf. 1Co 3:1–3), but because they were “saints by calling,” a reference to their call to salvation.\n\nWuest adds that \"The word \"saint\" is the translation of a Greek word meaning \"to set apart,\" in its verb, and \"set apart ones,\" in its noun form. The pagan Greeks set apart buildings as temples, consecrating them for non-secular, and therefore, religious purposes. These became the objects of veneration and reverence. Thus, saints are believing sinners set apart from sin to holiness, set apart from Satan to God, thus being consecrated for Gods’ sacred fellowship and service. The word \"saint\" as a designation of a Christian, brings at once to our attention the duty of every believer, that of living a separated life. The words, \"saint, sanctify, holy,\" are all translations of this same Greek root. They all speak of the absolute separation from evil and dedication to God, that must always be true of the Christian believer.\" (Wuest Word Studies - Eerdman Publishing Company Volume 1, Volume 2, Volume 3 - used by permission)\n\nNation (1484)(ethnos gives us our word \"ethnic\") in general refers to a multitude (especially persons) associated with one another, living together, united in kinship, culture or traditions and summed up by the words nation, Gentiles (especially when ethnos is plural), people (much like \"people groups\" in our modern missionary vernacular). In somewhat of a negative sense ethnos conveys the meaning of godless (generally idol worshipping) pagans (heathens, cp Eph 4:17, Mt 6:32), foreign nations not worshipping the true God (Mt 4:15). Often ethnos stands in clear contradistinction to Jew (Ioudaios) (Gal 2:14). Ethnos sometimes refers to Gentile Christians (Ro 11:13, Ro 15:27, 16:4, Gal 2:12). Ethnos is used in the singular of the Jewish Nation (Lk 7:5; 23:2; Jn 11:48, 50-53; Jn 18:35; Acts 10:22; 24:2, 10; Acts 26:4; 28:19). Plato used ethnos of a special class of men, a caste, tribe. In the Septuagint ethnos was used for nation, people Ge 10:5; non-Jews, Gentiles Ps 2:1.\n\nUBS Handbook on HOLY NATION - Holy nation is also from Exodus 19:6. As in 1:15 and 2:4, holy characterizes the church’s unique relationship to God: it is holy because it is consecrated to God and set apart for his service. (Compare NEB “a dedicated nation”; JB “a consecrated nation”; also Mft, Knox.) In Exodus 19:6, the TEV translates the same expression as “a people dedicated to me alone.” Holy nation may be rendered as “the nation dedicated to God” or “the nation dedicated to serve God.”\n\nWhat the Bible Teaches on Holy Nation - This expression is also from Exod 19:6 and other Scriptures such as Lev 19:2; 20:26; Deut 7:6; Isa 62:12. Aaron and his sons were separated from the people for the ministry of priesthood. As a mark of that separation they were given special garments to wear. Before they could function in the holy office they must be separated to God for it. The NT believer-priest does not wear special garments nor bear special titles as a mark of office. Instead, he is to be marked by his separation to God, an \"holy\" nation. The nations of earth are separated by boundaries, and borders. Language and culture and often physical distinctions divide them. This holy nation however knows no such barriers; it overflows all borders; it overlooks mere physical differences; it overcomes culture and language. This glorious unifying victory of grace will be the theme of the new song of praise to the Lamb in glory, \"Thou art worthy to take the book, and to open the seals thereof: for thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation; and hast made us unto our God kings and priests: and we shall reign on the earth\" (Rev 5:9-10). No doubt, such Scriptures will bear a special significance and provide a singular authority to the remnant of Israel brought out of the great tribulation into millennial blessing and service among the nations of the earth (Isa 60; Zech 14:16-19). (What the Bible Teaches – 1 Peter through Jude)\n\nSome like amillennialist A T Robertson comment that HOLY NATION is \"from Ex. 19:6, but here applied, not to the national Israel, but to the spiritual Israel of believers.\" This type of comment leads one to the say that God is finished with the nation of Israel, which is absolutely not true (see replacement theology). The nation of Israel is in 2019 the nation of Israel and it will continue to be a nation until the Second Coming of Christ. The Church has not replaced Israel, which is a teaching that has gained momentum in the church in recent years.\n\nJohn Piper on HOLY NATION - You have been chosen and pitied and possessed by God; and therefore you are not merely part of the world anymore. You are set apart for God. You exist for God. And since God is holy, you are holy. You share His character, because He chose you, pitied you, possessed you. You are holy. If you do not act in a holy way, you act out of character. You contradict your essence as a Christian. For your identity is holiness to the Lord: you are holy. (1 Peter 2:9-10 Christian Identity and Christian Destiny)\n\nThomas Constable comments that \"All the figures of the church that Peter chose here (1 Peter 2:9) originally referred to Israel. However with Israel's rejection of Jesus Christ (1 Peter 2:7) God created a new body of people through whom He now seeks to accomplish the same purposes He sought to achieve through Israel but by different means. This verse that at first might seem to equate the church and Israel on careful examination shows as many differences between these groups as similarities.\" (Constable's Notes on the Bible\"\n\nBlum comments that Peter's description in 1 Peter 2:9 \"does not mean that the church is Israel or even that the church replaces Israel in the plan of God. Romans 11 should help us guard against that misinterpretation. . . . The functions that Israel was called into existence to perform in its day of grace the church now performs in a similar way. In the future, according to Paul, God will once again use Israel to bless the world (cf. Ro 11:13-16, 23-24).\"\n\nRelated Resources:\n\nThe Jewish People, Jesus Christ and World History - S Lewis Johnson\n\nAre Israel and the church the same thing?

(The United Bible Societies' New Testament Handbook Series)\n\nPossession (4047) (peripoiesis from peripoieomai = literally means to make around oneself and then to acquire or purchase) means that which is acquired by purchase with the corresponding idea of preservation of that which is purchased.\n\nIn Hebrews 10:39+ the meaning of peripoiesis is that of experiencing of security, keeping safe or preserving.\n\nIn 1 Thes 5:9+ and 2 Thes 2:14+ the thrust of peripoiesis is to describe a gaining or obtaining of something, respectively salvation and glory.\n\nThe root verb peripoieomai is used by Paul in his charge to the Ephesian elders exhorting them to…\n\nBe on guard (command to continually be holding one's mind towards something, giving heed, paying close attention, watching out - present imperative) for yourselves and for all the flock, among which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers, to shepherd the church of God which He purchased [peripoieomai - acquired, gained, paid the price for, gained possession of] with His own blood. (Acts 20:28+)\n\nVincent explains that the phrase eis peripoiesin literally means\n\na people for acquisition. Revised Version = a people for God’s own possession. Wycliffe = a people of purchasing. Cranmer = a people which are won. See Isaiah 43:21 (Septuagint - LXX), where the kindred verb (peripoieomai) occurs: “This people have I formed for myself (English of the LXX = My people whom I have preserved [peripoieomai] to tell forth My praises.)\n\nPeripoiesis is used 5 times in the NT…\n\nEphesians 1:14 (note) who is given as a pledge of our inheritance, with a view to the redemption of God's own possession, to the praise of His glory.\n\n1Thessalonians 5:9 (note) For God has not destined us for wrath, but for obtaining salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ,\n\n2 Thessalonians 2:14+ And it was for this He called you through our gospel, that you may gain the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.\n\nHebrews 10:39 (note) But we are not of those who shrink back to destruction, but of those who have faith to the preserving of the soul.\n\n1 Peter 2:9 (note) But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for God's own possession, that you may proclaim the excellencies of Him who has called you out of darkness into His marvelous light;\n\nPeripoiesis is used 3 times in the Septuagint (LXX) (Greek translation of the Hebrew OT), Malachi's use paralleling the use by Peter. Jehovah speaking through His prophet Malachi describes the Jews who will be His own possession declaring…\n\nAnd they shall be Mine, says the Lord of hosts, in that day (What day? In context most likely at the beginning of the 1000 year reign when the remnant of Jews who had believed in their Messiah are finally ushered into His earthly, millennial kingdom for which they were looking even in the first century AD - cf Acts 1:6+) when I publicly recognize and openly declare them to be My jewels (My special possession, My peculiar treasure) (LXX = peripoiesis). And I will spare them, as a man spares his own son who serves him. (Amplified Version Malachi 3:17+)\n\nComment: Here peripoiesis translates the Hebrew word segullah/cegullah and means a treasured possession, (so translated in Dt 26:18+) a valued personal property, that which is owned by someone or that for which the owner has special affection or holds to be of special value. Here in Malachi 3:17 segullah/cegullah is a technical expression describing the people of Jehovah as His treasure or property, those who are rightly His by virtue of redemption.\n\nThe immediate context (the preceding verse) explains that God's treasured possession are \"those (Malachi is speaking primarily to the Jewish remnant who believe in Messiah) who feared the LORD (and who) spoke to one another, and the LORD gave attention and heard it, and a book of remembrance was written before Him for those who fear the LORD and who esteem His name.\" (NASB, Malachi 3:16+)\n\nChristians are a special people because God has preserved them for Himself. we are His possession now:\n\nMarvin Vincent writes that \"peculiar\" (KJV) is literally \"a people for acquisition. Wycliffe = a people of purchasing. Cranmer = a people which are won. The word occurs 1Th 5:9, rendered obtaining (Rev.); Eph 1:14, God's own possession (Rev.). See Isaiah 43:21 (Sept.), where the kindred verb occurs: “This people have I formed for myself (Vincent's Word Studies)\n\nVance Havner on \"a peculiar people\"…\n\nGod's people are \"a peculiar people\" (I Peter 2:9) which means \"a purchased people.\" The Greek word here carries the idea of making a ring around something to mark it as one's own. Christ has made a ring around us and claimed us for Himself. We hear these days about \"cheap grace\" and how it doesn't mean much to be a Christian. But salvation is the costliest item on earth. It cost our Lord everything to provide it and it costs us everything to possess it.\n\nWe are a generation of cheap Christians going to heaven as inexpensively as possible; religious hobos and spiritual deadbeats living on milk instead of meat, crusts of bread instead of manna, as though we were on a cut‑rate excursion.\n\nIn a day when tragedy has become comedy, we play fast and loose with eternal issues. The pearl of great price is not cheap! I have read that years ago in that part of Africa where diamonds in the rough were plentiful, a traveler chanced on boys playing. Closer investigation revealed that they were playing marbles with diamonds! God forgive us today that we handle His treasures as though they were trifles and the coinage of the eternal as though it were play money. It is no time to play marbles with diamonds!\n\nAFRAID OF THE DARK\n\nAt the turn of the century there was a city worker whose youth had been spent in evil ways. But one night during a revival meeting he was spiritually born anew. Soon after, he ran into one of his old drinking pals. Knowing his friend needed Jesus, he attempted to witness to him about his newly found peace. His friend rebuffed him rudely and made fun of him for “turning pious.”\n\n“I’ll tell you what,” said the new Christian. “You know that I am the city lamplighter. When I go ’round turning out the lights, I look back, and all the road over which I’ve been walking is blackness. That’s what my past is like.”\n\nHe went on, “I look on in front, and there’s a long row of twinkling lights to guide me, and that’s what the future is like since I found Jesus.”\n\n“Yes,” said the friend, “but by-and-by you get to the last lamp and turn it out, and where are you then?”\n\n“Then,” said the Christian, “why, when the last lamp goes out it’s dawn, and there ain’t no need for lamps when the morning comes.”\n\nMany children carry their fear of the dark into adulthood in the form of other kinds of fears—fear of failure, rejection, loss, pain, loneliness, or disappointment. Each of these fears seems to grow in darkness. Darkness is a metaphor for many things: death, night, uncertainty, evil—but in all of them, Jesus is the Light that brings illumination and comfort.\n\nWhen light shines, not only is darkness eliminated, but fears are relieved. Indeed, not only does Jesus give you as much light as you need to proceed in faith, but because of His sacrifice at Calvary, you can be assured of His eternal dawn when the last lamp goes out! Like the lamplighter said, “There ain’t no need for lamps when the morning comes.”\n\nChosen And Cherished - Frank Ray\n\n1 Peter 2:9 But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should show forth the praises of him who has called you out of darkness into his marvelous light.\n\nWho are the people of the Bible? The people of the book are the chosen people. Many people think that the Bible runs references on every person on planet earth. Not so. I hear this question over and over again, “When Cain left Adam and Eve and went down to the land of Nod and knew his wife, where did she come from?” Don’t be confused. God is keeping a record of the chosen race; that’s what this book is about. It is not about every person. People living from the time of Abraham to the time of Christ are part of the chosen generation. From Christ on is the church. As believers, we are part of that royal priesthood. We are a peculiar people. You did not choose him; he chose you.\n\nEphesians 1:4 According as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before him in love: as he has chosen us. The word chosen is in aorist tense indicating that God acted by himself. He didn’t go before a board of directors to make his selection; He chose us. To tell you the truth I wasn’t worthy to be chosen. I should have been one left on the outside, because I was alone and idle. I was a sinner, too. But I heard the voice of Jesus saying there is work to do. He came looking for me. I didn’t know the shape I was in until I met him. Do you know that you’ve been chosen by God? You don’t have to walk anywhere with a hung down head thinking you are nothing and that nobody loves you There is one that loves you so much that he chose you. Your voice, your strength, your home, your job, and your knowledge are all gifts from Him. What you have, God gave you. What you know God taught you. Where you are God brought you. Thank God, I am chosen by Him.\n\n‘A peculiar people’ William Wilberforce\n\n‘But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light.’ 1 Peter 2:9\n\nIn his memoir, Recollections of William Wilberforce (1864), John Harford recalled: ‘Touching on the purity and elevation of heart which should mark the Christian character, Mr Wilberforce said: “The thing we are all of us—you and I and all—too much disposed to forget is, that Christians are to be a peculiar people. We are too much inclined to appear to be what other persons are. One thing I often accuse myself of is the not seeking more diligently occasions of attempting to promote the spiritual improvement of others. It is a difficult point, but we should make it the subject of prayer.” ’\n\nFOR MEDITATION: When the apostle Peter writes of the need for us as Christians to be a peculiar people, he is not suggesting that we act strangely. Rather in concert with the words of Jesus in the Gospel of Matthew, he is saying that we ought to let our light—that is character of our lives and Christian testimony—‘so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.’\n\nJesus used a wonderful metaphor to convey the picture of how we ought to let our light shine. When men light a candle, he said, they do not put it under a bushel, but rather on a candlestick. When this is done, he concluded, the candle ‘giveth light unto all that are in the house.’ All of us, wherever we are in the world, are part of a community. Our relationships with our neighbours, as well as with our fellow Christians, ought to be marked by the elements of Christian character—good works born of faith and also the fruits of the spirit (see Galatians 5:22–23) ‘love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, and temperance.’ When this is done we are, as has been often said, salt and light in our communities and our culture.\n\nREFERENCE: Recollections of William Wilberforce (1864)\n\n‘We are to be created anew’ William Wilberforce\n\n‘But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light.’ 1 Peter 2:9\n\nIn the language of Scripture, Christianity is not a geographical, but a moral term. It is not the being a native of a Christian country: it is a condition, a state; the possession of a peculiar nature, with the qualities and properties which belong to it.\n\nFarther than this; it is a state into which we are not born, but into which we must be translated; a nature which we do not inherit, but into which we are to be created anew. To the undeserved grace of God, which is promised on our use of the appointed means, we must be indebted for the attainment of this nature; and, to acquire and make sure of it, is that great ‘work of our salvation’ which we are commanded to ‘work out with fear and trembling.’ We are everywhere reminded, that this is a matter of labour and difficulty, requiring continual watchfulness, and unceasing effort, and unwearied patience. Even to the very last, towards the close of a long life consumed in active service, or in cheerful suffering, we find Paul himself declaring that he conceived bodily self-denial and mental discipline to be indispensably necessary to his very safety. Christians, who are really worthy of the name, are represented as being ‘made meet for the inheritance of the saints in light’; as ‘waiting for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ,’ as ‘looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of God.’ It is stated as being enough to make them happy, that ‘Christ should receive them to himself’; and the songs of the blessed spirits in Heaven are described to be the same as those in which the servants of God on earth pour forth their gratitude and adoration.\n\nFOR MEDITATION: The seventeenth-century divine Thomas Fuller described the traits that ought to distinguish a Christian: ‘Christians are called saints, for their holiness; believers, for their faith; brethren, for their love; disciples, for their knowledge.’ It is by the pursuit of such that we become, to use Wilberforce’s phrase, ‘Christians who are really worthy of the name.’\n\nREFERENCE: A Practical View of Christianity (1797)\n\nHow to Describe God’s People - Russell Spray\n\n“But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvelous light” (1 Peter 2:9).\n\nI.

By the right of the Atonement. Are we prepared to leave ourselves resolutely alone and to launch out into the priestly work of prayer? The continual grubbing on the inside to see whether we are what we ought to be, generates a self-centred, morbid type of Christianity, not the robust, simple life of the child of God. Until we get into a right relationship to God, it is a case of hanging on by the skin of our teeth, and we say—‘What a wonderful victory I have got!’ There is nothing indicative of the miracle of Redemption in that. Launch out in reckless belief that the Redemption is complete, and then bother no more about yourself, but begin to do as Jesus Christ said—pray for the friend who comes to you at midnight, pray for the saints, pray for all men. Pray on the realization that you are only perfect in Christ Jesus, not on this plea—‘O Lord, I have done my best, please hear me.’\n\nHow long is it going to take God to free us from the morbid habit of thinking about ourselves? We must get sick unto death of ourselves, until there is no longer any surprise at anything God can tell us about ourselves. We cannot touch the depths of meanness in ourselves. There is only one place where we are right, and that is in Christ Jesus. When we are there, we have to pour out for all we are worth in the ministry of the interior.\n\nExodus 19:1–8 A PECULIAR TREASURE - John Bennett\n\nNo servant of the Lord worked harder than Paul, but he confessed to the believers at Corinth, ‘by the grace of God I am what I am … I laboured more abundantly than they all: yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me’, 1 Cor. 15:10. All that he was and all that he did could be traced to God’s grace. It is good to remember the distance that grace has brought us. JOHN NEWTON expressed his appreciation in one of his hymns,\n\n‘Tis grace that brought me safe thus far,\n\nAnd grace will lead me home’.\n\nThe distance the grace of God had brought His people is encapsulated in His words, ‘Say to the house of Jacob, and tell the children of Israel’, v. 3. Their links with Jacob had led them into Egypt, but by grace Jacob became Israel, ‘prince with God’; therefore they bore the name, ‘the children of Israel’.\n\nThe display of the grace of God was seen in what He had done to the Egyptians, but it was also captured in the graphic description of what He did for them, ‘I bare you on eagles’ wings, and brought you unto myself’, v. 4. They had experienced the speed, strength and tenderness of His deliverance. All that had happened to them since that time had displayed His grace. They had been in the wilderness only for a short time, but had they been left to their own devices they would have perished. They had murmured, complained and lacked faith, whereas the Lord had guided, delivered and provided for them. It was grace that had brought them ‘safe thus far’. His great desire was to make them ‘a peculiar treasure (special jewel) unto me … a kingdom of priests, and an holy nation’, vv. 5–6.\n\nTheir disregard for the grace of God proved to be a life-changing moment in Israel’s history. Against the backdrop of Sinai the Lord tested them by promising the blessings, ‘If ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant’, v. 5. Foolishly, instead of casting themselves upon His grace, they boasted, All that the Lord hath spoken we will do’, v. 8. At that point the law was brought in; that could not save them.\n\nIt is divine grace that has made us ‘a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people’, 1 Pet. 2:9.\n\nVance Havner - The Only Christian Nation\n\nBut ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, AN HOLY NATION, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light (1 Peter 2:9).\n\nONE OF THE institutions fast disappearing from American life is the old-fashioned Fourth of July celebration, with its speeches about our national heritage extolling the heroes of bur illustrious past. The greatest Fourth of July celebration is now held in Denmark, three thousand five hundred miles away. For years our national heroes have been debunked and their reputations riddled by muckrakers, until our children regard them, not with admiration, but with cynicism. Subtle international influences have encouraged reducing these giants to insignificance. They had their faults, of course, but any generation that has failed as miserably as we have today, has no business ridiculing its forefathers. We need a good dose of old-fashioned Americanism.\n\nRecently I visited the home of Theodore Roosevelt. It took me back to a period now strangely remote. If there is such a thing as turning over in one's grave, the Colonel must be in a constant whirl! I remembered his words: \"The professed internationalist usually sneers at nationalism, patriotism, what we call Americanism. He bids us forswear our love of country in the name of the world at large. We nationalists answer, he has begun at the wrong end. As the world now is, it is only the man who ardently loves his country first who in actual practice can help any country at all.\" Certainly, a man is a better member of the human family if his first loyalty is to his own, and a better member of the family of nations, if he is true first to his native land.\n\nI heard General Douglas MacArthur say on his seventy-fifth birthday: \"Seductive murmurs are arising that we are provincial and immature, or reactionary and stupid, when we idealize our own country; that there is a higher destiny for us under another more general flag. Repudiate them in the marketplace, from the platform, and the pulpit.\" We need to recover American nationalism. I do not mean isolationism. We should always be ready to cooperate with fellow nations for the common good, but not amalgamate at the cost of the characteristics that made us great.\n\nOur text sets forth another kind of nationalism. America is not a Christian nation. There is only one Christian nation—God's people, the church of Jesus Christ. There are Christians in all nations, but only one Christian nation: the fellowship of believers, a nation within the nations. The world is not being converted, and never will be. God is taking out a people for His name. Christians are colonials for our citizenship is in heaven; we are a colony of heaven on earth (Philippians 3:20). We are also nationals for we belong to the \"holy nation\" of our text. We are also \"a peculiar people,\" which does not mean that we are queer (although some are!) but that we are God's purchased people, bought with the blood of our Lord. We should not be queer, but we ought to be different. And yet Phillips puts it this way: \"Indeed your former companions may think it very queer that you will no longer join with them in their riotous excesses, and accordingly say all sorts of unpleasant things about you\" (1 Peter 4:4).\n\nToday, we face the same dangers in the church that we confront as a nation. Just as America is in danger of losing her national identity in a world state, so Christians may lose their spiritual identity in a world church. There are those who would down grade America, and whittle away the Constitution. Some of us are still satisfied with this country. It is the only one people are trying to get into! They are trying to get out of Cuba, East Germany, Hungary, China, and many another land. I would be glad to embark all beatniks who like some other system better, and wave them goodbye out of New York (or any other port) as far as I could see them. By the same token, there are those who down grade Christianity and deny the Scriptures. Some even affirm that God is dead and the church defunct, and that we ought to close the churches and get out into the world speaking a new language—the lingo of the times.\n\nThis is not the America I knew as a boy, nor is this merely old-age nostalgia, for younger Americans like Paul Harvey lament, \"I never left the old country, the old country left me.\" Nor is the church today, the church I used to know. Nations run their courses and so do churches. America still has within her the possibility of renewal, and the church, by the grace of God, still holds the possibility of revival. What the country needs is a new breed of Americans, and what the church needs is a new breed of Christians to counteract phony Americans and counterfeit Christians, who are a disgrace to both nation and church.\n\nI am an American by birth and by choice. I was born an American, but some who were born here seem to prefer some other heritage. I choose America: the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution of the United States in their original forms, before we started tampering with them. I choose America: her rocks and rills, her woods and templed hills. My heart still skips a beat when the flag goes by. If that is provincial, I am glad to be a \"back number.\" I am a Christian by birth and by choice: by birth, because I was born a second time, into the kingdom of God; by choice, because I choose Jesus. I know that God chose me before I chose Him, but still He says, \"... choose you this day whom ye will serve\" (Joshua 24:15). Patrick Henry said: \"As for me, give me liberty or give me death.\" Joshua said, \"As for me and my house, we will serve the Lord.\" I choose to stand with that red headed Virginian as an American, and with that gallant old soldier as a servant of God. I choose the Bible, the Constitution of the holy nation, in its original form, before the demythologizers started tampering with it. What they call myth, I call miracle; what they call fable, I call fact. I can still endure sound doctrine. I do not have itching ears, and need no false teacher to tickle them!\n\nBut why are Christians \"an holy nation\"? Certainly not to sit in self-righteous isolation. That was the curse of Pharisaism. Our text tells us: \"That ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light.\" Communism shows forth the praises of Karl Marx. Communism does not say that some other way is just as good. Christians are ambassadors for Christ. Every citizen of this holy nation is an ambassador. An American ambassador is not out to make Americans of everybody, but a Christian ought to be out to make Christians of everybody. It has been said that Communism is out to win the world, but that Americans are out to enjoy it. Communism is not out to win more territory, but to capture the souls of men. The greatest soul-winners today are Communists winning men for the devil. Dr. Malik said: \"The Russians are utterly devoted to their cause. That is not true of most Americans I know. Why do you in America not pay the price? Why do you not press the battle to victory with the weapon God has given you, the heritage of the Christian faith?\" Whitaker Chambers said: \"Communism is no stronger than the failure of other faiths.\"\n\nWe need to be what we are as Christians—an holy nation, Christian colonials, heavenly nationals, a Master's minority in a pagan world, a spearhead of expendables willing to spend and be spent—showing forth the excellencies of our Lord. This is the only Christian nation. We belong to it only by being born into it through faith in Jesus Christ. We cannot take out naturalization papers! And every citizen of this nation is an ambassador. If we are not ambassadors we are traitors. Which are you?\n\nRoyal Priests—1 Peter 2:9 - Henry Blackaby\n\nIf you are a Christian, you are a priest, chosen by God. As a member of the royal priesthood you have constant access to the King. If there is ever a need in your life, you don't have to find an intermediary or enlist another priest in order to gain a hearing from the King. Your position as a royal priest allows you direct access. This privilege describes your position as a priest.\n\nHowever, priests also have a function. It is the responsibility of a priest to work within a priesthood. Scripture does not promote the practice of individual priests, each with a separate ministry. Rather, priests function together (Lev. 9:1). An unbiblical sense of individualism can isolate you from functioning within God's royal priesthood as He intended.\n\nThe priest represents God to the people, but he also takes the people's concerns to God. Is there someone around you who desperately needs the intercession of one of God's priests? Perhaps someone will only come to know God by seeing Him in your life. Our world hungers for an expression of Christ as He really is, living out His life through His people. It is dangerous to put our job above our calling by God. We are called to be priests first, and to hold a job second. When we get these out of order, everyone around us is denied access to the Father through us. God may have called you into a secular job as a vocation, but more importantly He has appointed you to be one of His royal priests.\n\nJ C Philpot - A peculiar people\n\n\"But you are . . .\n\na chosen generation,\n\na royal priesthood,\n\na holy nation,\n\na peculiar people.\" 1 Peter 2:9\n\nMay we never forget that the suffering Son of God gave Himself to purify unto Himself a peculiar people—a people whose thoughts are peculiar, for their thoughts are the thoughts of God, as having the mind of Christ—a people whose affections are peculiar, for they are fixed on things above—a people whose prayers are peculiar, for they are wrought in their heart by the Spirit of grace and supplication—a people whose sorrows are peculiar, because they spring from a spiritual source—a people whose joys are peculiar, for they are joys which the stranger cannot understand—a people whose hopes are peculiar, as anchoring within the veil—a people whose expectations are peculiar, as not expecting to reap a crop of happiness in this marred world—but are looking for happiness in the kingdom of rest and peace in the bosom of God. They make it manifest that they are a peculiar people by walking in the footsteps of the Lord the Lamb—taking up the cross—denying themselves—and living to the honor, praise, and glory of God.\n\nA W Tozer - SAVED TO WORSHIP\n\nBut ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light. 1 Peter 2:9\n\nI believe a local church exists to do corporately what each Christian believer should be doing individually—and that is to worship God. It is to show forth the excellencies of Him who has “called [us] out of darkness into his marvellous light” (1 Peter 2:9). It is to reflect the glories of Christ ever shining upon us through the ministries of the Holy Spirit.\n\nI am going to say something to you which will sound strange. It even sounds strange to me as I say it, because we are not used to hearing it within our Christian fellowships. We are saved to worship God. All that Christ has done for us in the past and all that He is doing now leads to this one end….\n\nIf we are willing to confess that we have been called out of darkness to show forth the glory of Him who called us, we should also be willing to take whatever steps are necessary to fulfill our high design and calling as the New Testament Church. WHT093-094, 097\n\nLord, I acknowledge today that my highest calling and my purpose for existence is to worship You. May I and my church glorify You through our worship. Amen.\n\nCharles Stanley - The Cure for a Heavy Heart\n\nKEY VERSE: 1 PETER 2:9 You are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, His own special people, that you may proclaim the praises of Him who called you out of darkness into His marvelous light.\n\nPraise seems to be a natural part of what we want to do when things are going our way. But on the days when the dishwasher breaks or the children are sick or the mechanic gives you bad news about the car, it is much more difficult to be effusive with thanksgiving.\n\nGod understands how your emotions are built; He made them. He also knows the cure for a heart weighed down by concerns and irritations—praise.\n\nPraise focuses your attention upon God. When you take a long and deliberate look at the character and ways of the Lord who loved you enough to die for you, your eyes are naturally shifted away from the difficulty and onto His ability to care for you.\n\nPraise increases your faith. Telling God what you love about Him always involves reciting His past actions of might and power on your behalf. You can look back at the times He sent special provision at just the right moment and thank Him for them. This process results in a heart that expands with joy and security in Him.\n\nPraise gives you a sense of identity. When you praise God, you act as one who belongs to Him. According to 1 Peter 2:9, you are a member of “A PEOPLE FOR God’s OWN POSSESSION, so that you may proclaim the excellencies of Him who has called you out of darkness into His marvelous light” (NASB). That is reason enough to praise Him forever.\n\nLord, on difficult days—when I don’t feel like it—I still want to praise You. Thank You for delivering me from darkness into light. That is reason enough to praise You forever.\n\nChosen for a Reason - Chris Tiegreen\n\n1 Peter 2:9 - You are a chosen people . . . that you may declare the praises of him who called you.\n\nIN WORD This is a remarkably encouraging passage of Scripture. It tells us of our chosenness, our royal role in this world, and our inheritance as children of the most high God. We read verses like this and are amazed at the high and holy nature of our calling. We realize that mercy has been lavished upon us and we’re in a privileged place. We are the ultimate rags-to-riches story.\n\nBut the amazing story doesn’t end there. God hasn’t just saved us and then written “the end.” There’s more to the plot than that. We are chosen so that we might declare His praises. As verse 9 continues, we have been transferred from a kingdom of darkness to a kingdom of light. We were blind, but now we see. We were hidden and then revealed. We were lost in a dark, murky wilderness, then plucked out of it and placed on streets of gold glimmering under the perpetual radiance of the Son. And according to this verse, there’s a more ultimate purpose to our salvation than ourselves. We are bestowed with the honor of chosenness with the specific purpose of declaring His praises.\n\nIf you’ve never seen your worship as the ultimate purpose of your salvation, you’re missing the best part of salvation. The place of glad worship is the place of greatest blessing, of richest fellowship, and of true fulfillment. Salvation isn’t complete until we praise Him for His mercy—daily, passionately, honestly. We were bought with a price for a reason.\n\nIN DEED Many believers get caught up in getting the most out of their salvation. Few move on to giving the most out of their salvation. But those who do will realize one of the many paradoxes of the Kingdom: Giving it all results in getting it all. A heart poured out in praise results in a heart filled with purpose. The way of sacrifice leads to great gain. Losing your life in worship ends with fulfilling your life in God. And that’s exactly the reason for which you were redeemed.\n\nWe are saved to worship God. All that Christ has done for us in the past and all that He is doing now leads to this one end. —A. W. TOZER\n\nPROCLAIMING THE EXCELLENCIES OF GOD - John MacArthur in Drawing Near (1 Peter 2:9).\n\nYou are an ambassador of the living God.\n\nThe privilege of proclaiming the excellencies of God takes us back to 1 Peter 2:9, but we consider it here because it summarizes the purpose of all our Christian privileges.\n\nThe Greek word translated “proclaim” is an unusual word used only here in the New Testament. It means “to advertise” or “to publish” and refers to making something known that would otherwise be unknown. “Excellencies” speak of powerful and heroic deeds. You are an ambassador of Christ, having the great privilege of proclaiming what God has done for His people.\n\nThat was an intrinsic part of Hebrew worship. For example, Psalm 103 says, “Bless the Lord, O my soul, and forget none of His benefits; who pardons all your iniquities; who heals all your diseases; who redeems your life from the pit; who crowns you with lovingkindness and compassion; who satisfies your years with good things, so that your youth is renewed like the eagle. The Lord performs righteous deeds, and judgments for all who are oppressed. He made known His ways to Moses, His acts to the sons of Israel. The Lord is compassionate and gracious, slow to anger and abounding in lovingkindness” (vv. 2–8).\n\nIt would be an honor to be an ambassador of the United States, representing this country’s power and capabilities to other countries. But you have an even greater honor—to represent the power and capabilities of the living God. When you have an opportunity to speak for Him, you can rightly say, “I have the privilege of announcing the mighty and heroic deeds of the living God, who has called me into His service.”\n\nBecause you are in Christ, you have glorious privileges that include union with God, access to the Father, spiritual sacrifices, security, affection, dominion, possession, holiness, illumination, and compassion. What greater honor can there be than to proclaim the excellencies of the One who has granted you such marvelous privileges?\n\nSuggestions for Prayer:\n\nThank God for calling you to be His ambassador.\n\nAsk Him for the courage and integrity to represent Him well always.\n\nFor Further Study: Read Psalm 147, noting all the mighty deeds of God proclaimed there.\n\nSET APART FOR GOD - John MacArthur in Drawing Near (1 Peter 2:9).\n\n“You are … a holy nation” (1 Peter 2:9).\n\nHoliness involves the decreasing frequency of sin and the increasing frequency of righteousness.\n\nChristians are a holy nation—a people set apart from sin and Hell to an intimate relationship with God. Originally Israel was God’s holy nation, but by unbelief she forfeited that privilege. Now the church, which consists of both Jews and Gentiles, is His unique people and will remain so until the nation of Israel repents and receives her Messiah at His return (Zech. 12:10).\n\nBiblical holiness (sanctification) is often misunderstood, but it needn’t be. When the Holy Spirit delivered you from the domain of darkness and transferred you into the Kingdom of Christ, you became His special possession. That doesn’t mean you’re sinlessly perfect, but it does mean you’re no longer a slave to sin, the Devil, and death. That’s positional sanctification. Practical sanctification is the decreasing frequency of sin and the increasing frequency of righteousness as you progress in your Christian walk.\n\nSanctification should not be confused with false standards of holiness, adopted by those who, like the Pharisees, attempt to be holy through external means, or who, like the Stoics, have a passionless devotion to duty, or who, like monks, isolate themselves from the world, or who, like quasi-Christian psychologists, replace sanctification with introspection, self-analysis, and improvement of one’s self-image.\n\nTrue holiness begins with a love for Christ Himself. That’s what compels you toward greater sanctification.\n\nPeter said that you were “chosen according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, by the sanctifying work of the Spirit, that you may obey Jesus Christ” (1 Peter 1:1–2). Christ Himself became to you “wisdom from God, and righteousness and sanctification, and redemption” (1 Cor. 1:30). In Him you were saved, which is the beginning of sanctification, and in Him you have every resource necessary for progressing in holiness.\n\nSuggestions for Prayer:\n\nThank God for your positional holiness in Christ, for by it you are perfect in His sight.\n\nThank Him for the Spirit’s power in your life, which enables you to live in a manner pleasing to Him.\n\nFor Further Study:\n\nWhat do the following passages say about sanctification? Acts 15:7–9; 1 Thessalonians 4:3; Hebrews 10:14; 1 Peter 1:15–16.\n\nPOSSESSED BY GOD - John MacArthur in Drawing Near (1 Peter 2:9).\n\n“You are … a people for God’s own possession” (1 Peter 2:9).\n\nSince God paid the price to redeem you, you belong to Him.\n\nWhen Jesus said, “I am the good shepherd; and I know My own, and My own know Me” (John 10:14), He stated a truth that has been especially dear to me since the early years of my theological education. One of the pleasant memories from my seminary days is sitting in chapel and singing the hymn by the nineteenth-century lyricist Wade Robinson—“I Am His and He Is Mine.” I may never fully comprehend the depths of what it means to belong to Christ, but I will forever glory in it.\n\nThe Greek word translated “possession” in 1 Peter 2:9 means “to purchase” or “to acquire for a price.” Paul used it in Ephesians 1:14 to speak of “the redemption of God’s own possession.” Everyone is His by creation, but we as Christians are uniquely His because He paid the price to redeem us from the bondage of sin and death.\n\nGod’s ownership of believers is emphasized throughout Scripture. Paul admonished elders to “shepherd the church of God which He purchased with His own blood” (Acts 20:28). He said to the Corinthians, “Do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit who is in you, whom you have from God, and that you are not your own? For you have been bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body” (1 Cor. 6:19–20). Titus 2:14 says that Christ “gave Himself for us, that He might redeem [or purchase] us from every lawless deed and purify for Himself a people for His own possession.”\n\nIsaiah 43:21 says, “The people whom I formed for Myself, will declare My praise.” That was to be Israel’s purpose, and it is yours as well. God chose you as His own possession and gave His Son to purchase your salvation. You are His eternally; so live accordingly, and rejoice in such a glorious privilege!\n\nSuggestions for Prayer:\n\nMake it your practice to praise God abundantly for the privilege of belonging to Him.\n\nFor Further Study: Read John 10:1–33.\n\nWhat characterizes the Good Shepherd?\n\nWhat did Jesus claim about His relationship with God the Father?\n\nHow did the Jewish leaders react to His teaching?\n\nSHARING CHRIST’S DOMINION\n\n“You are … a royal priesthood” (1 Peter 2:9).\n\nChristians serve the King and will someday reign with Him in His Kingdom.\n\nIn Exodus 19:5–6 God says to Israel, “If you will indeed obey My voice and keep My covenant, then you shall be My own possession among all the peoples … and you shall be to Me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation.” They were to be both priests and royalty, but they violated the covenant and forfeited those privileges. Now, according to Peter, Christians are the royal priesthood of God.\n\nThe Greek word translated “royal” in 1 Peter 2:9 was used of a royal palace, sovereignty, crown, or monarchy. In this context it refers to royalty in general. We speak of the royal house of England or France, meaning not a building but a sphere of dominion. So it is with God’s “spiritual house” (v. 5). Believers serve the King and will also reign with Him in His sphere of dominion.\n\nThat is affirmed elsewhere in Scripture. In the book of Revelation we read, “Thou hast made them to be a kingdom and priests to our God; and they will reign upon the earth” (Rev. 5:10); and, “Blessed and holy is the one who has a part in the first resurrection; over these the second death has no power, but they will be priests of God and of Christ and will reign with Him” (Rev. 20:6).\n\nYour royal position has some practical implications for the way you live each day. For example, when dealing with the problem of litigation among Christians, Paul said: “Does any one of you, when he has a case against his neighbor, dare to go to law before the unrighteous, and not before the saints? Or do you not know that the saints will judge the world? And if the world is judged by you, are you not competent to constitute the smallest law courts? Do you not know that we shall judge angels? How much more, matters of this life?” (1 Cor. 6:1–3).\n\nNever forget who you are in Christ, and don’t let sin or the world distract you from your priestly role.\n\nSuggestions for Prayer:\n\nMemorize 1 Timothy 4:12. Ask God to make you a better example of one who represents His royal priesthood.\n\nFor Further Study:\n\nRead Genesis 14:18–20 and Hebrews 7:1–17. Who was Melchizedek, and what was unique about his priesthood?\n\nILLUMINATED BY THE SPIRIT - John MacArthur in Drawing Near (1 Peter 2:9).\n\n“… that you may proclaim the excellencies of Him who has called you out of darkness into His marvelous light” (1 Peter 2:9).\n\nGod has granted you the ability to understand the truth and live accordingly.\n\nIn the natural realm, darkness can be a debilitating and frightening thing. The story is told of a missionary who was on board ship one dark night when suddenly he was awakened by the frantic cry of “Man overboard!” Immediately he arose from his bunk, grabbed the portable lamp from its bracket, and held it at the window of his cabin.\n\nHe couldn’t see anything, but the next morning he was told that the flash of his lamp through the porthole emitted just enough light to enable those on deck to see the missing man clinging to a rope. They rescued him seconds before his strength would have given out. The light had shone just in time to save the man’s life.\n\nIn the spiritual realm, darkness is even more devastating because it represents sin with all its disastrous consequences. First John 1:5–6 says, “God is light, and in Him there is no darkness at all. If we say that we have fellowship with Him and yet walk in the darkness, we lie and do not practice the truth.”\n\nUnbelievers are characterized as children of darkness. They are enslaved to Satan, the prince of darkness, who blinds their minds so they don’t see the light of Christ’s glorious gospel (2 Cor. 4:4). They love darkness and reject light because they don’t want their evil deeds to be exposed (John 3:19–20).\n\nChristians, however, have been called “out of darkness into [God’s] marvelous light” (1 Peter 2:9). That refers to God’s taking the initiative to save us. As an unredeemed sinner, you could never have turned from darkness on your own because you had neither the ability nor the desire to do so. God had to grant you saving grace and the illumination of His Spirit so you could recognize truth and respond accordingly.\n\nThat blessed privilege is known only to Christians. What a joy it is to not only recognize God’s truth but also to walk in it daily!\n\nSuggestions for Prayer:\n\nThank God for illuminating your mind and enabling you to see spiritual truth.\n\nPray diligently for others to be so illuminated.\n\nFor Further Study: Read 1 John 1:5–2:11. Contrast the children of darkness with the children of light.\n\nA Blinding, Wonderful Light - Joni Eareckson Tada\n\nYou are a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people belonging to God, that you may declare the praises of him who called you out of darkness into his wonderful light. —1 Peter 2:9\n\nThe other day I was telling my friend Doug Vinez how, on Saturday mornings when I was a kid, my neighborhood friends and I would hop on the streetcar and head to the Ambassador Theatre. We would load up on Peanut Chews and stake out seats midway up the aisle.\n\nDoug told me about an old theater he used to visit. This one had no lobby. You walked through the glass doors, and within a few feet you would pass through a curtain and bump up against the back row. When the movie was over, there was no vestibule to ease you out of darkness and back into daylight. He described how kids would walk outside, rub their eyes, and almost bump into lampposts—the light was a jolt to their senses.\n\nDoug added, “I almost forgot about that theater until I read 1 Peter 2:9.” When I asked him to explain the connection, he said, “As a Christian, I forget what a blinding jolt it was to be taken out of darkness and placed in light.”\n\nHe’s right. We Christians can hardly recall the blinding reality of being translated from the kingdom of darkness to the kingdom of God’s dear Son. One minute we were heading to hell; the next, heaven. One minute we were dead in our sins; the next, alive unto God. If we really thought about it, we would be overwhelmed, rubbing our eyes and exclaiming, “What a jolt this is!”\n\nMay your heart never become so familiar with darkness that you forget the night-become-day reality of life in the Lord. The Lord Jesus has saved you, and it’s a change about which you must never become complacent.\n\nLord of light, thank you for giving sight to me when I was blind to my own sin, and for removing me from the darkness of my lost state.\n\n1 Peter 2:1-10 TODAY IN THE WORD\n\nYou are a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people belonging to God. - 1 Peter 2:9\n\nDr. Joseph Stowell remembers seeing railroad crossing signs from his childhood that said, “Look, Listen, and Yield.” Dr. Stowell says this combination of alertness and submission is not only a good formula at railroad crossings, but also an excellent pattern for Christians to follow in their relationship with God.\n\nThe apostle Peter would say amen to this formula. The apostle was writing to Christians living as aliens in the world, to encourage them in the face of suffering and to urge them to respond as Jesus Christ would. To do this successfully, these believers needed to be alert (see 1 Peter 5: and to yield to God’s will for them. God calls us to follow the same example.\n\nWe learned that God’s will for us is our holiness (1 Peter 1:15-16). Holiness is a big concept, so Peter clarified its meaning. Holiness means living with a reverence for God that takes into account the high price He paid to save us. It also involves loving other Christians with a pure love that avoids hypocrisy.\n\nLiving in this way is possible because we have been given new life through the gospel (1:12) that Peter and the other apostles preached to the church. Part of Peter’s Spirit-inspired preaching urged believers to grow spiritually the way a baby grows naturally--by taking in solid nourishment.\n\nPeter changed metaphors in verse 4 and used a word picture that we might expect from someone whose name means “stone.” As a student of the Old Testament, Peter knew that the prophets had likened the coming Redeemer to a stone. The apostle had seen the Stone, Jesus Christ, with his own eyes and had heard Jesus refer to Himself as such (compare v. 7 with Matt. 21:42).\n\nTODAY ALONG THE WAY\n\nToday we don’t have to bring an animal sacrifice to a priest, so that he might offer the animal’s blood as a temporary covering for sin.\n\nA Special People…\n\nAs newsman Clarence W. Hall followed American troops through Okinawa in 1945, he and his jeep driver came upon a small town that stood out as a beautiful example of a Christian community. He wrote, \"We had seen other Okinawan villages, … down at the heels and despairing; by contrast, this one shone like a diamond in a dung heap. Everywhere we were greeted by smiles and dignified bows. Proudly the old men showed us their spotless homes, their terraced fields, … their storehouses and granaries, their prized sugar mill.\"\n\nHall saw no jails and no drunkenness, and divorce was unknown. He learned an American missionary had come there thirty years ear­lier. While he was in the village, he had led two elderly townspeople to Christ and left them with a Japanese Bible. These new believers stud­ied the Scriptures and started leading their fellow villagers to Jesus. Hall's jeep driver said he was amazed at the difference between this village and the others around it. He remarked, \"So this is what comes out of only a Bible and a couple of old guys who wanted to live like Jesus.\"\n\nThe great power of God's Word leads to salvation through faith in Christ, creating a \"special people,\" a community of believers who love one another, exhort one another, and serve God together. We need to pray that our churches will be an example of God's power to a watch­ing world. —H. V. Lugt (Our Daily Bread, Copyright RBC Ministries, Grand Rapids, MI. Reprinted by permission.

His pastor, Charles Seidenspinner, was testifying on his behalf. \"Why should this man be released?\" asked the Crown Attorney. \"Because God has come into his life, and changed him, and will hold him steady,\" replied the pastor. \"What do you mean 'God has come into his life?'\" asked the judge. He listened thoughtfully as the pastor shared in detail how Christ transforms a life. The judge then asked a loaded question: \"Suppose this man is released. Would you want him for a neighbor?\" \"Your Honor,\" said the pastor, \"that would be wonderful! Some of my neighbors need to hear the same message that changed his life.\" Roddy was released, and today he's living for the Lord and is active in his church.\n\nAs forgiven sinners, all Christians are \"ex-cons\" who praise the One who has called us out of darkness (1 Pet. 2:9). When our lives are characterized by honorable conduct and good works, they are strong evidence for truth to those who speak against us (v.12).\n\nLord, may my words and actions convince people in my neighborhood of their need for Jesus. --DJD (Our Daily Bread, Copyright RBC Ministries, Grand Rapids, MI.

These two documents clearly reveal that the nation’s freedom depends largely on a strong constitution.\n\nThe Bible is a more far-reaching \"bill of rights \"than either of these documents. It originated with God, who backs it with His justice, His concern for all people, and His sovereignty. And it is the only charter that guarantees freedom from sin’s penalty and power.\n\nA man went to a clergyman to get some advice about religious virtue and the freedom it brings. \"What must I do to attain holiness? \"he asked. The pastor replied, \"Follow your heart. \"Then he added, \"To follow your heart you are going to need a strong constitution. \"Which constitution? \"asked the man. \"The Bible!\" said the pastor.\n\nPeter said that Christians, as \"a holy nation, \"are to“ proclaim the praises of Him who called [us] out of darkness into His marvelous light”(1 Peter 2:9).

Even that is not all: “into his marvellous light.” The light of the gospel is full of wonders. As common light is made up of many colors, so the light of God’s grace is made up of many marvellous colors, — the colors of all the attributes of God.\n\nGod’s grace has been bestowed upon you in order that you may show forth his praises, or, as the marginal reading puts it, his “virtues.” Note what the Lord has done for you he has called you “out of darkness” into light, into his light, “into this marvelous light.” There are three thoughts there that are beautifully blended into one. What marvelous light that is into which God calls us! Try to measure it by the darkness in which you were; try to measure it by the deeper darkness into which you were going; try to measure it by the eternal darkness which would have fallen upon you if you had died in the dark. God has graciously brought you into his marvelous light.\n\nYou are to be advertisers of the praises or virtues of Christ, not only to know them, and to be glad to know them, but to make them known to others. Beloved, how far are you doing this? I put the question personally to each one of you, for you were chosen by God on purpose that you “should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvelous light”. (1 Peter 2 Commentary)\n\nProclaim (1804) (exaggello from ek = out + aggéllo = messenger… who speaks and acts in place of one who has sent him) describes a complete proclamation, for as Vines says those verbs (like exaggello) which are compounded with ek often suggest what is to be done fully. Exaggello therefore means to tell forth, to tell something not otherwise known, to make widely know, to report widely, to proclaim throughout and to tell everywhere.\n\nExaggello can even mean \"to advertise\". Therefore because the world is “in darkness” people do not know the “excellencies” of God; but since we have \"Christ in us the hope of glory\", they should see Him in and through our attitudes, actions and conversation. Each citizen of heaven is a living “advertisement” for the excellencies or virtues of God and the promises and blessings He bestows on believers now and throughout eternity. Our lives should radiate His “marvelous light” which now even indwells us as the Spirit of Christ.\n\nThe only NT use of exaggello is here in 1 Peter 2:9 but exaggello is used 10 times in the OT in the LXX (the Septuagint = Greek translation of the Hebrew OT) (Ps 9:14; 56:8; 71:15; 73:28; 79:13; 107:22; 119:13, 26; Prov 12:16). The following examples parallel and amplify Peter's charge to all saints of all ages… (click links to read context of these great verses describing the proclamation of God's excellencies)\n\nPs 9:14 That I may tell (exaggello) of all Thy praises, that in the gates of the daughter of Zion I may rejoice in Thy salvation.

(See comments by Spurgeon)\n\nPs 119:26 I have told of my ways, and Thou hast answered me; Teach me Thy statutes. (See comments by Spurgeon)\n\nIn this verse Peter clearly leans heavily on OT truths to emphasize the position and privilege of NT believers.\n\nGet on your knees and talk to God about men and then go out on your feet and talk to men about the excellencies of God.\n\nExcellencies (plural) (70"
