        "text": "Denys Arcand's intelligent, audacious ''Jesus of Montreal'' attempts to shake up stale religious assumptions, undermine religiosity with wit, and question the Gospels with a new reverence that springs from our modern, commercial world. Creating a band of actors hired to modernize a Passion play within the film, Mr. Arcand needs to balance satire and seriousness with the greatest daring and delicacy. And for the first hour, before it gives in to leaden, self-conscious Christ imagery, ''Jesus of Montreal'' succeeds.\n\nThe actor who is hired to play the lead and revise the Passion play at a Montreal shrine is a 30-year-old named Daniel (Lothaire Bluteau). From the start, he looks too traditional a Jesus, with a perpetual mournful expression in his wide brown eyes. The film works best when he still seems human, before Mr. Arcand merges Daniel with Christ.\n\nDaniel finds four other actors in unlikely places. One actor is dubbing his voice on a pornographic film. An actress is having an affair with the priest who hired Daniel. And another actress named Mireille, who will become the Mary Magdalene figure, is filming a perfume commercial, draped in a couple of skimpy scarves. ''The unutterable lightness of being,'' says a voiceover on this commercial, a twist the advertisers want to be ''very Kundera.''\n\nHere is the wit so evident in Mr. Arcand's ''Decline of the American Empire,'' the talky, lively work for which the Canadian writer and director is best known in this country. And he effectively sets up the disjunction between the insane modern world and a faith that needs to be revitalized. It doesn't even matter that the actors have transparently become a little band of disciples, following Daniel around while he seems always to be off in the shadows gazing at them with some terrible foreknowledge of tragedy. ''Jesus of Montreal'' has not yet gone haywire.\n\nBut as the film weaves in and out of the characters' lives and their new version of the Passion, Mr. Arcand loses the wily, contemporary grip that makes his material effective. ''Jesus of Montreal'' starts out as a mix of Martin Scorsese's historically set ''Last Temptation of Christ'' and ''The Ruling Class,'' a satire in which Peter O'Toole is an English aristocrat who believes he is Jesus. But midway through, it turns into ''The Greatest Story Ever Told'' set in urban Montreal.\n\nThe new Passion play, in which the actors roam around the grounds of the shrine, is not lively enough to draw much of a crowd. It suggests new historical possibilities - that Jesus was the illegitimate son of a Roman soldier - but it is essentially quite traditional. Daniel, his body covered with bloody makeup so it looks as if he has been scourged, hangs naked on a cross on top of a hill overlooking the glittering lights of Montreal.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
