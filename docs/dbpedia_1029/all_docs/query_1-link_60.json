        "text": "Summary:Representing the historical Jesus and the Christ-event is a challenge cinema has taken on from its beginnings, developing both direct and metaphorical images of Jesus. Denys Arcand’s Jesus of Montreal (1989) holds a unique place in this canon because it proposes a direct portrait of Jesus and a metaphorical representation. This paper, updating and taking an earlier study of the film in new directions, is structured in four sections. First, it analyses the film as a metatextual, two-level narrative approach to the Jesus story; secondly, it considers some of the more significant parallels between Arcand’s film and the Gospel; thirdly, the paper uses Arcand’s film to open up new meaning in the Gospel text; and fourthly, it examines how the film offers an original and provocative way of representing the resurrection. Where indicated or helpful for the analysis of Arcand’s film, other films in the Jesus tradition are commented upon."
