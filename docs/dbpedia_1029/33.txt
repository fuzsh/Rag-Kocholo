Jesus of Montreal is a Canadian film released in 1989, directed by Denys Arcand. It tells the story of a young actor named Daniel, who is hired to play the role of Jesus in a Passion play at a Montreal church. However, as Daniel delves deeper into the role, he begins to question the traditional portrayal of Jesus and the Church's teachings. He becomes inspired to rewrite the script and put on a performance that challenges the Church's beliefs and traditions, causing conflict with the church authorities.

One of the main themes of Jesus of Montreal is the question of faith and religion. The film explores the idea that religion can be a force for good, but also that it can be used to manipulate and control people. This is exemplified through the character of the priest, who uses his position of power to manipulate the church and its followers, and the character of Daniel, who becomes disillusioned with the Church and its teachings as he learns more about the true nature of Jesus and his message.

Another theme of the film is the role of art and creativity in society. Daniel's performance of the Passion play is meant to be a traditional retelling of the story of Jesus, but he takes it upon himself to rewrite the script and add his own interpretation. This act of creativity and self-expression is met with resistance from the Church, who see it as a threat to their authority. However, the film ultimately suggests that art and creativity can be a powerful force for change and can inspire people to think differently about their beliefs and the world around them.

Overall, Jesus of Montreal is a thought-provoking and poignant film that tackles complex themes of faith, religion, and art. It encourages viewers to think critically about the role of religion in society and the power of creativity and self-expression.
