        "text": "What’s driving the day in Brussels.\n\nBy JAKOB HANKE VELA\n\nwith ZOYA SHEFTALOVICH\n\nSend tips here | Tweet @HankeVela | Listen to Playbook and view in your browser\n\nTOP JOBS RACE KICKS OFF\n\nMEET THE FRONTRUNNERS FOR THE NEXT COMMISSION: The EU election is now only two weeks away, and that means the European Commission’s top jobs will soon be up for grabs again. Maneuvering is underway in the 27 capitals, which each get one commissioner in the College. POLITICO today brings you the names in the mix, the likely contenders and long shots, and the portfolios they’re gunning for. Read the full story here. Playbook’s highlights …\n\nTop names to watch: Poland’s Radek Sikorski is the frontrunner for a defense or foreign affairs portfolio. Latvia’s Valdis Dombrovskis could get another big economic role. Spain’s Ecological Transition Minister Teresa Ribera is hoping for a major Green Deal, climate and energy job.\n\nThe other portfolios to look out for: Competition and trade — the two exclusive EU competencies where the Commission has the most direct power.\n\nThe eyebrow-raiser: Italy’s Agriculture Minister Francesco Lollobrigida, who also happens to be the brother-in-law of PM Giorgia Meloni, is among those in the frame to take the country’s spot at the top table, currently held by Economy Commissioner Paolo Gentiloni.\n\nMEANWHILE, IN WEIMAR: The foreign ministers from France, Poland and Germany gathered Wednesday in Weimar, Germany, to discuss the next mandate of the Commission. My colleague Clea Caulcutt, who was traveling with France’s Stephane Séjourné in the Republic’s Falcon 900, reports talks were dominated by Ukraine, EU defense … and, of course, the next commissioners.\n\nThe main takeaway: The three want to coordinate to strengthen the role of the next EU foreign affairs chief, according to a joint statement. They also want to make EU sanctions more effective by creating an integrated Commission/EEAS sanctions team.\n\nTriangulation: According to Séjourné, the Weimar format is “key to the post-election phase because it includes all the pro-European families,” gathering politicians from Renew, the Greens and the EPP (parties that backed Ursula von der Leyen for the Commission presidency). They want to get their ducks in a row.\n\nIf it ain’t bust why break it? France (and others) don’t want to tie themselves to von der Leyen for a second term. Publicly France has signaled some distance, and privately several French officials say Macron would prefer his old friend Mario Draghi at the helm (loooong shot). That said, the mood in Paris is also that French ideas have flourished under von der Leyen.\n\nThe message matters: But in French minds, it’s not just about getting the right people. “How the casting and the architecture of the new Commission will be read [by observers] matters in the negotiations, because it will set the perception of its political orientations,” said Séjourné. Translation: Everyone wants to back a winner.\n\nRome’s role: Italy’s Meloni has been playing a deft game, building bridges with von der Leyen, and seeking to position herself as the deal-maker. And not everyone is happy with that. “Everybody’s saying that Italy’s the kingmaker but Meloni’s strategy won’t matter in the end,” said an EU diplomat.\n\nEUROBAROMETER SNEAK PEEK\n\nEXCLUSIVE — EUROPEANS WANT MORE DEFENSE COOPERATION: Eighty percent of respondents to the latest Eurobarometer survey said they want cooperation in defense matters to be increased at the EU level, according to results shared in advance with Playbook.\n\nFeeling more European: The latest Eurobarometer, which will be published this afternoon, polled 26,399 people across the 27 EU countries. Seventy-four percent said they think of themselves as EU citizens — the highest level recorded, and 2 percentage points higher than when they were asked in winter 2023. Maybe the troubled international climate is making Europeans feel more connected? It certainly wasn’t Eurovision …\n\nTop of voters’ minds: The cost of living remains the dominant concern for Europeans at a personal level, with 51 percent highlighting it — although that was down 6 percentage points on the survey in winter 2023.\n\nWorries about Ukraine are increasing: Thirty-five percent of respondents said the conflict in Ukraine is their top concern at the EU level, up 7 percentage points on the winter 2023 survey. The number of respondents saying they support current measures to aid the war-stricken country, such as the supply of military equipment, was unchanged at 60 percent.\n\nGAZA\n\nBIDEN OFFICIALS SEEK EU HELP TO REOPEN RAFAH CROSSING: The Biden administration wants to bring in the EU to take control of the Rafah border crossing between Egypt and Gaza, my Stateside colleagues report.\n\nThe plan: U.S. officials for weeks worked behind the scenes, brokering talks between Israel and Egypt, to strike a deal that would put the EU Border Assistance Mission to Rafah in charge of the Rafah crossing and significantly improve the flow of aid into the enclave, a senior Biden administration official and another person familiar with the matter told Erin Banco.\n\nHumanitarian crisis: The crossing has been closed since Israel moved into Rafah, the southernmost city in Gaza, putting more pressure on the remaining crossing points and making it harder for food and other aid to enter the occupied Palestinian enclave.\n\nEgypt and Israel disagree over who should oversee the crucial entry point: Egypt has said it wants Gazans who used to run the crossing to return. Israel has argued that another group should take over, given the old one included members of Hamas.\n\nA compromise? The EU mission could be an alternative that is acceptable to both Israel and Egypt. But it would also put enormous pressure on the EU, making it responsible for one of the world’s most sensitive borders during an invasion, through which hundreds of thousands of people could attempt to flee and weapons could be smuggled.\n\nBackground: The mission, created by the EU Council, previously worked at the border in Gaza but suspended its operations in 2007 after Hamas took over the territory. Since then, it has been in “stand-by mode.”\n\nAnd speaking of Egypt — ICYMI: Egyptian intelligence secretly changed the terms of a cease-fire proposal that Israel had already signed off on earlier this month, killing the deal, CNN reported Wednesday. Egypt denies the report.\n\nPALESTINIAN STATEHOOD — HOW EUROPEAN ALLIES TRIED TO MOLLIFY THE WHITE HOUSE: The Biden administration wasn’t happy when Spain, Norway and Ireland announced they were recognizing a Palestinian state on Wednesday … but it wasn’t blindsided.\n\nAccording to my colleagues Matt Berg, Shawn Pogatchnik and Nahal Toosi, European officials discussed the move with their American counterparts in the days leading up to the announcement. The White House strongly disagreed with their stance but “accepted it as an inevitable development,” in the words of one Irish official, and so there was no real pushback.\n\nMeanwhile, France defends decision not to recognize Palestine: At the foreign ministers’ meeting in Weimar, French Foreign Minister Séjourné said recognizing a Palestinian state is not “taboo,” but the timing isn’t right. Germany’s Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock, whose country is not in favor of recognition, said the focus should be “on political solutions” and “concrete talks.”\n\nROAD TO EU ELECTION\n\nCALL TO PROTECT MEDIA FREEDOM IN ITALY: A coalition of journalism and media organizations wrote to Commission Vice President Věra Jourová on Monday urging Brussels to launch an investigation into whether the Meloni government is restricting journalists’ freedom to report independently on the political process.\n\nThe claims: The letter, obtained by Playbook, accused the administration of “egregious attempts to silence dissent and seize control of public media” that are counter to EU and democratic values. “We call upon you to ensure a level playing field during the campaigns for the European Parliament elections to allow for the fair and equal participation of all the different political forces in the media,” said the groups, which included the European Federation of Journalists, the International Federation of Journalists and the European Movement.\n\nPublic media, not propaganda: Their appeal comes after journalists at Italy’s state broadcaster RAI went on strike this month claiming Meloni was “attempting to turn RAI into a mouthpiece for the government.” Meloni’s administration has denied the accusations.\n\nBrussels’ hands are tied: Commission officials contacted by Playbook said they take complaints about press freedom seriously. However, because the Media Freedom Act only applies from August next year, the Commission can’t yet launch an investigation. They pointed to the annual rule of law report, in which the Commission urged Italy to protect the editorial and financial independence of public service media.\n\nAFD’S KRAH WITHDRAWS FROM CAMPAIGN AFTER SS REMARKS: Maximilian Krah, the controversial lead candidate for the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, said Wednesday he will stop campaigning in the EU election and step down from the party’s leadership board.\n\nICYMI: Krah faced a backlash after he told the Italian daily La Repubblica he would “never say that anyone who wore an SS uniform was automatically a criminal,” a reference to German novelist Günter Grass, who admitted late in his life to having joined the Waffen-SS as a teenager. Krah’s remarks prompted France’s National Rally, the party of Marine Le Pen, to declare it wouldn’t sit alongside the AfD in the next European Parliament. My colleague Eddy Wax explains what the far-right schism means.\n\nDUTCH GOVERNMENT\n\nWHO WILL BE THE NEXT DUTCH PM? The four parties forming the new right-wing government in the Netherlands will today discuss who will become the country’s next prime minister.\n\nDifficult dynamics: Normally, the leader of the biggest party gets the top job, but Geert Wilders’ harsh views on migration, Islam and Europe make the far-right Freedom Party leader unacceptable to his coalition partners from the outgoing Prime Minister Mark Rutte’s People’s Party for Freedom and Democracy, the centrist New Social Contract and the populist Farmer Citizen Movement.\n\nAlso out of the running: As Playbook mentioned on Tuesday, rumors swirled that Ronald Plasterk, a former Labor Cabinet minister who brokered an early round of talks between the coalition partners, would be the next PM … but he ruled himself out after questions were raised about historic business dealings (he denied wrongdoing).\n\nPlace your bets: Names now circulating for the top job are Mona Keijzer, the No. 2 in BBB, and Kim Putters, a former member of the Dutch senate who facilitated the second round of coalition talks. A recent poll of Netherlands Radio 1 listeners showed there was also popular support for Rotterdam’s long-time Mayor Ahmed Aboutaleb. But both Putters and Aboutaleb are Labor members.\n\n**How will the election results shuffle the deck for the EU's top jobs?
