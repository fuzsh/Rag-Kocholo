In all 499 themes were studied, of which 115 were essentially or entirely completed, and 34 led to contributLons to industry. Eighty-six monographs were published. In addition to technical and industrial projects, important work was done in botany, zoology, physiology, and the s-.)cial sciences. The economic effect realized from introduction of Academy developments into industry amounted tc more than 5.3 million rubles, or 30 percent more than for 1973. Notable contributors during 1974 were as follows: Institute of Mathematics and Mechanics: theory of gravitational resilient instability and the formation of dome folding in the earth's crust; successful development of special problems in the stability of underground installations; a cycle of works on rock mechanics (awarded the 1.974 Kazakh State Prize).

Conclusion: The Kazakh Academy of Sciences contributed significantly to republic and national research during 1974, laying stress on technological progress, cultural construction, education of scientific workers, planning and coordination of research, and the reinforcement of the scientific material-technical base. One significant weakness is the serious lag in the output of scientific publications.

The Armenian SSR, with its developed network of scientific institutions, is a good example of this trend. There has been a significant regrouping of forces in the Armenian medical service, This has included a reduction in the number of subdivisions by 16 percent in the past three years alone. This result was achieved by enlarging laboratories and divisions, by altering the specialties followed by some services, and by liquidating small, scientifically weak institutions. In this way, by using the institute of Labor Hygiene and Occupational Diseases as a base and combining it with a number of divisions from the Institute of Epidemiology, Virology and Medical 1 /3 DEMIRCHYAN, V., MEDITSINSKAYA GAZETA 29 Jan 75 p 3 Parasitology and with some problem laboratories for radiation hygiene and hygienic normalization, a large new scientific center was created--the Institute of General Hygiene and Occupational Diseases. Outstanding Armenian scientists and specialists have been asked to evaluate the work of all scientific research institutions what- ever; this has led to the delivery of the corresponding reports at sessions of the College of the Armenia-. Ainistry of Health. Continuous improvement in the working conditions of research workers has been noted. Thus the Institutes of Cardiology, Health Resort Sciences and Physicotherapy, and a?so the Central Scientific Research Laboratory of the Yerevan Medio:al Institute have all received new buildings in the past few years. Cne min objective is to achieve competent planning and coordination of all scientific research work: this means strict scrutiny of research subjects and careful rejection of unpromising ones. In this connection, the first steps have already been taken by improving the links between main institutes and republic institutes. Research projects undertaken by local scientific institutions as a rule must be examined and confirmed by problem commissions appointed by the main institutes; the latter also hear reports on finished research projects and extend methodological help where needed. 2/3 Approved For Release 1999/09/26 : CIA-RDP86T00608R000200110034-2 Approved For Release 1999/09/26 : CIA-RDP86T00608R000200110034-2 DEMIRCHYAN, V., MEDITSINSKAYA GAZETA 29 Jan 75 p 3 Weaknesses must be rioted. Although the \"main-and-republic\" dual system of institutes has already demonstrated its viability, an important link is missing-- namely, the appropriate service of the Armenian Ministry of Health--for the main institute, able enough to evaluate research as such, is in no position to direct the republic institute in the organizational sense. Some negative criticism also must be directed to the introduction of medical innovations into daily practice. The long-term plan for such introduction is a sort of guideline which cannot be translated into reality by the branch divisions and boards of the Ministry, which have no specific authority for this. Definite authorities should be set up to exercise the functions of control and coordination in science. 5. USSR SOYUNOVA, M., Deputy Minister of Health Turkmen SSR MEDICAL WORKERS' DAY Ashkhabad TURKMENSKA\"A ISKRA in Russian 15 Jun 75 p 3 IAbstractl The protection of motherhood and medical care for expecting mothers and infants, is one of the main tasks of the Soviet medical services. The Soviet state pays much attention to improving working conditions for women, caring for their health and wellbeing, and protecting their motherhood. More than 1.5 billion rubles were paid in 1973 for maternity leave, delivery, and infant care, and unwed mothers. Since November 1974 many thousands of families in the Soviet Union have received state financial help for children if the family income is less than 50 rubles per famil,, member. There are about 11 million children in the Soviet Union attending preschool organizations, such as nurseries and kindergartens. This enables working mothers to combine work with motherhood and to participate in the upbringing of children. In Turkmen SSA there are 65,000 such organizations. In addition there are seasonal nurseries and kindergartens. To provide proper care for expectant mothers and to help women with gynecological problems, the Turkmenian SSR has expanded the network of maternity wards and matertiiLy consultation centers. More than 100 million rubles were spent 1 /2 Approved For Release 1999/09/26 : CIA-RDP86T00608R000200110034-2 Approved For Release 1999/09/26 : CIA-RDP86T00608R000200110034-2 25 Aug 75 7 SOYUNOVA, M., TUEKMENSKAYA ISKRA 15 Jun 75 p ) in 1974 for construction of the maternity ward at the city hospital in Krasnovodsk, for organization of the maternity consultation centers in Takhta settlement, and for starting the construction of the 120-bed city hospital in Bakharden. In addition to the Central Hospital imeni N. I. Pirogov in Ashkhabad and three oblast and two city maternity hospitals, there are 34 other rayon hospitals in Turkmen SSR which provide consultations and care for rixpecting mothers, as well as for women requiring gyneco.ogical help. Furthermore, there are five separate maternity sections of large rayon hospitals, 37 rural hospitals, 86 consultation centers, 162 kolkhoz maternity wards, and 1035 medical station' staffed with doctor's assistants and midwives. The Ministry of Health Turkmen SSR also pays much attention to training midwives- gynecologists, setting up special wards for expectant mothers with complicated pregnancies, organizing departments caring for the gynecology of infants, and early detection of hereditary diseases. The most recent form of medical services in Turkmen SSR is mobile consultation units for women.

The important Uzbek Scientific Research Institute of Livestock Breeding (UzNIIZh) has been busy for over three decades developing new breeds of animals and fowl. working out methods for feeding and care, and doing research in various other areas, such as artificial insemination and the biochemical bases of increased productivity. The Institute now employs 59 doctors and candidates of science and has laboratories equipped for intensive research in this field.

USSR MISHINA, N., Special Pravda Correspondent, Dnepropetrovsk RAINMAKERS Moscow PRAVDA in 'Russian 13 Jun 75 p 6 (Text' The seas)n of summer work with an actively influencing clouds has begun at the Experimental Meteorological Training Field of the Ukrainian Scientific Research Hydrometeorological Institute, At the headquarters of the Institute, situated alongside the new building of Dnepropetrovsk airport, the Institute's workers planned a program of investigation for today. \"It is known that we cannot produce rain unless there is a suitable cloud,\" remarked Ye. Ye. Korniyenko, in charge of affairs concerned with the physics of clouds and active influence on them. His remark reminds one of a dialogue from a comedy by Aristophanes when one of the heroes asks: \"But, have you even once seen when Zeus produced rain without the help of clouds?\" Approved For Release 1999/09/26 : CIA-RDP86T00608R000200110034-2 Approved For Release 1999/09/26 : CIA-RDP86T00608R000200110034-2 25 Aug 7'; 10 MISHiNA, N. , P IVDA 13 Jun 75 p 6 \"But I reel that today we will have some action.\" Yevgeniy Yevgt'n'yevich in, scrutinizing the sky in which a red hot sun is burning, \"There is a formation which is sufficiently promising.\" The 11-14, a laboratory plane, is travelling in accordance with regulations for visual flights: low altitude from which the to rthrs landscape and distant clouds are simultaneously seen. Over many years of experiments in which clouds were treated with high frequency electric charges, solid carbon dioxide. and later with silver iodide, special.'.sts already have learned how to make rain. By the way, artificial. precipitation is of considerable assistance in extinguishing forest fires. The problem here is consider- ably broader. It is in the fact that active influence on atmospheric processes should be applied to more rationally utilize natural resources and develsp of a scientific foundation to conserve nature and improve the environment. These are the investigations, which are being conducted at the special meteorological training field. \"We are now flying in its zone,\" Korniyenko explains. \"It is as If it were n huge laboratory table with an area of 10,000 square kilometers over which a acnse 2 /55 MISIITNA, N. PRAVDA 13 Jun 75 p 6 network of observation stations, posts, and several hundred precipitation measuring gauges are scattered. A steppe zone of the Ukraine in which there is frequently a sh-,vta`r. of moisture has been specially selected for the training field. Thus, ou experiments are useful to the field of science as well as to the kolkhoz fields. \"In the course of many years of experiments was there any success in making discoveries'\" \"I would not care to name to loudly some of the laws which have been discovered,\" he sari. \"In the past, for instance, attempts to extract rain from small clouds were made, figuring that heavy clouds would themselves release considerable amounts of rain. A conclusion has now been reached that it is more expedient to work with large cumulus rain clouds. We are now approaching such a cloud.\" A command was heard: \"Prepare the generator for seeding.\" It was necessary to determine how to approach the huge cloud. Originally small clouds were d,isted with the reagent from above; this, however, created a condition which was even dangerous for the plane. A rather clever decision was ado',ted. We are now flying in a circle under the cloud. Warm air currents rising from earth 3/5 Approved For Release 1999/09/26 : CIA-RDP86T00608R000200110034-2 Approved For Release 1999/09/26 : CIA-RDP86T00608R000200110034-2 MISHINA, N., PRAVDA 13 Jun 75 p 6 intercept the silver iodide jet spray and the elou:;, acting like a dust pump, soaks up the reag-ant's small crystals. These are structurally similar to ice, with the result that wai.er vapors being misled settle on the bait, the additional icy nuclei. Within 2U minutes the whirling top of the cloud withered, became fibrous, and slowly began to settle. Its lower border, clean and even at the beginning, seemed to disirtegrate, and la:^ge drops of rain began to drum the wings and fusilage. Korniyenko is trying to overshout the noise of the motors and rain. Streams are flowing down the glasses of the illuminators. Several grams of silver iodide are sufficient to release thousands of tons of water from a medium size cloud. The talk is about the beneficial effect on the national economy from such, ^...tive interference. Undoubtedly there is an effect. As yet, however, it is not possible to cite exact data. The investigations have not as yet been completed, and to establish the extent of human influence on a bac:'ground of natural modifications is a highly complex task. MISHINA, N., PRAVDA 13 Jun 75 p 6 If one is to resort to theatrical analogues it means that the specialists are trying to clarify the role played by natural forces in this rain and the role of experimenting stage managers. Let us say that it is possible to find two absolutely identical clouds, and that for comparison purposes one will. be seeded and the other one, the control, left undisturbed. True, it is possible to create theoretical models using the language of formulas describe the elements, and with the help of an apparatus of mathematical, statistics establish their laws. Experiments are being conducted at laboratories on special installations: cloud chambers, thermal barometric chamber, and aerometric tubes. Radar, laser probing, and sputnik meteorology are :it the disposal of the scientists. it is the end of the fifth hour of the flight. The scientists tirelessly observeii each cloud within their field of vision and used instruments to determine time, alti- tude, temperature, and velocity. To learn how to control the elementr, is not a simple matter, Twice as much water than is carried by all of the rivers of cur country is annually carried throuSh the air over the USSR. In addition, the investigators when planning the strategy for an attack on a cloud remember the dictum: \"Sow a wind and reap a storm.\" This dictum serves as a warning against incautious intrusion into the natural environment.

G. Yanovakiy has its clinics located in Batyyeva Dora, Tho are 14 clinics, all working on major problems of modern medicine. Among these pxvoiems are improved methods of cardiac and pulmonary surgery, and treatment of lung diseases. Immunology plays an important role in the solution of these problems. One of the physicians working at the heart surgery clinic is Nina Ivanovna Kondrashova, who recently dc fended her candidate dissertation on new methods of detecting anti- bodies in a patient's blood and acquired heart defects. Kondrashovxa methods have been used to determine the suitability of a patient for surgery at a particular time and stage of disease. If the indications are positive, the surgery is delayed. The Institute's Immunology Section is headed by Doctor of Medical Sciences Yekaterina F. Chernushenko. Repeated studies at the Institute have found allergic reactions to some antibiotics due to the formation of antibodies in the patient's body. This is particularly true of streptomycin. For this reason, treatment often starts with very small doses, with a gradual increase to permit acclimation of the body to them. 1 /2 !\"any institutes in the Ukraine are studying various chemicals for their allergenic effects? Transplantation of organs is another important part of immunology. Immuno- depressants must be developed further to facilitate the body's acceptance of alien organs and tissues. There are 30 transplant antigens, and with their varied combina- tions this adds up to some 27,000 different forms. Immunology has become a major science which serves the elevated goal of preserving human life. It is necessary for specialists of the most diverse medical profiles.

THE ONENESS OF NATURE AND A SINGLE SCIENCE Review of: C, P. von WEIZSACKER. DIE EINHEIT DER NATUR. STUDIEN. Munchen, 1972, 491 S. Moscow VOPROSY FILOSOFII in 'Russian No 11, 1974 pp 158-161 (Text) C. P. Weizsacker is an outstanding figure among physicists. In admitting philosophical basis of the development of the theoretical natural science, he constantly turns his attention to philosophical problems of science. Weizsacker not only sees the conflict of ideas in this field, but he also consciously takes part in it. He openly speaks of the unsatisfactoriness of neo-positivism as a \"methodology of the modern science,\" and he comes out against its adherents. In the first place he criticizes the \"antiphilosophical position of neo-positivism, objectively and chiefly directed against dialectical materialistic method of analysis of the scientific theoretical cognition. But he does not understand the essence of this opposition and builds his criticism of the neo-positivism essentially on a passive defense of the idealistic philosophico-gnosiological traditions (in particular 1/14 NIKOLAYEV, I. I., VOPROSY FILOSOFII No 11, 1974 pp 158-161 of the philosophy of Plato), considering it the surest way to overcome the neo- positivist \"swoops\" on philosophy. This oppositio:, to neo-positivism, correct from the viewpoint of the subjectively set up purpose, but objectively unstable, being devoid of a constructive Weltanschauung foundation, often leads to the incorrect, superficial appraisals of the individual positions of Marxist philosophy, which shows the ignorance of Marxism and in particular, of the latest Marxist elaborations of methodological problems of the scientific cognition. At the same time the critical stand taken by ore of the well known modern physicists in respect to neo- ^~sitivism is rather noteworthy. Weizsacker, not limiting himself to the analysis of individual positions of modern physics, raises general problems, and builds a peculiar scientific-philosophical conception, whose links turn out to have both Weltanschauung, and methodological, and specifically scientific aspects. The book forms an integral whole, despite the fact that it unites individual articles and lectures written and delivered at various times (beginning from 1936) on various occasions and for d.fferent audiences. Notwithstanding any special subject to which each of 22 articles was devoted (to the analysis of the language of physics, idea of linguistic relativity, interpretation of quantum mechanics, cybernetical models of good and evil, interpretation of Platonic dialogues, quantum theory of natural science, etc.), it touches, from various sides and at various levels, to this or that 2/14 Approved For Release 1999/09/26 : CIA-RDP86T00608R000200110034-2 Approved For Release 1999/09/26 : CIA-RDP86T00608R000200110034-2 NIKOLAYEV, I. I. VOPROSY FILOSOFII No 11, 1974 pp 158-161 extent, upon three fundamental problems of the author's conception: interlation between philosophy and science, possibility of building a single science, and its conjecturable limits. The Weizsacker's approach to the first problem is characterized by its emphasis not so much on the modern as on the classical philosophy. Even though the book reflects the author's definite attitude toward philosophy of science, positivism, \"neo-Marxism\", existentialism, but all this, as a rule, are incidental remarks. On the other hand, to classical philosophy, and in the first place to Plato, Aristotle, and Kant, are devoted special sections of articles and the concluding, fourth part of the book. This is a deliberate orientation, brought about, on the one hand, by dissatisfaction of the author with fhe \"scholastic\" and neo-positivist philosophy, which, in his opinion, proved to be incapable to understand the philosophical and genuinely methodological foundations of the modern science, and on the other hand, by his conviction that the specific character of philosophical investigation (in particular in the field of philosophical problems of the development of theoretical natural science, which, in the opinion of Weizsacker, should imitate philosophy) calls for a systematic and unavoidable \"return to the sources.\" True, the ideas of Weizsacker about the tasks of philosophy are Platonic and often simply naive: he N IKOLAYEV, I. 1. VOPROSY FILOSOFII No 11, 1974 pp 158-161 takes one--nondeterminative side of philosophical investigation--the statement of the question of the essence of the phenomena, ignoring the Weltanschauung and social-class content of philosophy. Philosophy, in the opinion of Weizsacker, is similar to a series of \"childish questions,\" making us each time to reveal its entire content. For example, such as: \"What is it this child is playing with?-- It is a ball. --What is a ball? -- According to senses it is a given sphere. --What is a sphere? --A mathematical idea. --What; is an idea? --Real, true, only one. --What is only one?--Read Parmenides! (p 145). Science by itself does not realize its most fundamental concepts. Thus it is \"characteristic of the modern physics tha': it does not actually ask what is the matter, and of biology that it does not raise the question what life is, and for psychology, that it does not ask what is soul, but these terms as needed are used to vaguely describe the domain in which investigation are to be carried out\" (p 287). Therefore, with regard to the \"normal\" course of science we can rightly apply the famous thesis of Heidegger: \"Science does not think\". However, the essential, radical shifts in science are obligatorily related to a new comprehension and criticism of fundamental conceptions. On this stretch of road a rather young science is in need of philosophy having a thousand-year \"experience of going against 4/14 Approved For Release 1999/09/26 : CIA-RDP86T00608R000200110034-2 Approved For Release 1999/09/26 : CIA-RDP86T00608R000200110034-2 NIKOLAYEV, I. I., VOPROSY FILOSOFII No 11, 1974 pp 158-161 the stream of the naive chinking, the experience of putting a question: \"And what is it I am actually doing?\" (p 37). In this case one has to come down the chain of notions hack to the first \"inventors\" of the most f%mdamental of them and which have been \"borrowed\" by science. As a result, it turns out that one cannot properly comprehend, for example, the quantum mechanics, without having first understood Plato (see p 378). The notions about \"bac:twardness\", \"being out of date\", and \"obsolescence\" of the ideas of the great philosophers of the past are being rapidly cleared away upon sufficiently deep inquiry into today's problems of science. Connected with new times, the progress in natural sciences and the growth of historical consciousness, etc., \"is paid for by a definite narrowing of the formulation of questions, to be more precise, by a progressive forgetfulness of the existence.\" But whoever, today, for example, in physics, \"asks about foundations, he rediscovers the same structures, which had been already discovered by Greek philosophy even though from a different viewpoint\" (p 440). At the same time we should not be unduly surprised by a \"slow\" progress of philosophy. \"Taking into account many hundred thousand years of the existence of man and the exceptional complexity and sublety of problems brought to light by philosophy--a single Plato for a millenium--this is already a great thing\" (p 282). 5/14 NIKOLAYEV, I. I., VOPROSY FILOSOFII No 11, 1974 pp 156-161 It goes without saying that the selection of \"philosophical teachers\" of sc-cnce by Seizsacker is rather subjective. We do not see among them either Hegel, or Leibniz, or Spinoza. The revolutionary upheaval enacted in philosophy by K. Marx and F. Engels remained outside the author's field of vision. Nevertheless the very attempt at a scrupulous study of the heritage of philosophy (even of its restricted volume) for the purpose of the substantiation of science of our times, by Weizsacker, turns out very fruitful. of special interest is a most minute analysis of the Plato's \"Parmenides\" and the compariLon of ideas contained in this dialogue with the ideas of ethology and quantum mechanics (see articles: \"The Parmenides and Graylag Goose\" and \"The Parmenides and Quantum Mechanics\"). Of the moment (especially against the background of positivist methodologism) is also his giving emphasis to the critical function of philosophy. Weizsacker repeatedly defines philosophy as the \"unremitting will to formulate the problem\", as \"realization of our ignorance\", a \"step toward surprise\", a \"criticism of the fundamentals\", etc. As the most important task of philosophy Weizsacker considers the substantiation of the methods of science and their rightness. In this connection he subjects to a 6/14 Approved For Release 1999/09/26 : CIA-RDP86T00608R000200110034-2 Approved For Release 1999/09/26 : CIA-RDP86T00608R000200110034-2 25 Aug 75 19 FPD:SOVIT:T SCIENCE NIKOLAYEV, I, I,, VOPROSY FILOSOFII No 11, 1974 pp 158-161 convincing criticism the empiricist platform of positivism. The \"Empiric Galileo\" is a historical myth, since the general lawn of science, in the strict sense of the word, cannot be derived from the available particular experience, The principal error of \"fundamental empirism\" (in contrast to quite rightful \"empirism as a description\" of the science) Weizsacker sees in the futila sc rch for the absolute truth, \"It is nc t that the experience, , , proves the truth, ;at, only for an individual case\". It is rather otherwise: \"the experience proves the general, but not with certainty. In each separate case we.... simultaneously admit the truth of the general\" (p 125). The most common perception rendered by the words (\"the table is round\") is already conceptually expressed. The particular manifests itself here through the general. It is a common human ability to perceive the general ( form --the starting material of scientific cognition. Science only develops this capacity in some specific respect, says Weizsacker. In the same manner as it is not possible to confine science within the limits of what is \"directly given,\" the philosophical analysis of sciance cannot be restricted to a simple description of its methods. In this Weizsacker sees the shortcoming of the modern philosophy of science, whose representatives \"are looking,, for the unity only in the method.\" Meanwhile the fundamental principle in science is not the NIKOLAYEV, 1. I, , VOPROSY FILOSOFII No 11, 1974 pp 158-161 method but the object - \"substance\", which is the purpose of its study. Important breakthroughs are always achieved, wherever, someone, fascinated by a reality, which he sees before him, and which he cannot disregard any more, develops a method that was never used by any one before,\" (p 301). Nature is the object of the study by natural science. Nature is older than man, and man is older than natural science. While approaching the idea of the oneness of man and nature from the viewpoint c,^ their historicity, we must consider the natural science with all its conceptions as a work of man, and man, with all his cognitive possibilities, as a \"child\" of nature. We obtain a peculiar gnosiological cj.rc].e, to penetrate which is possible only by first going round its both halves. From the viewpoint of methods, subjects and social character, the key role in the structure of science is played by physics, because of its ability for reliable theoretical predictions of the results of experience and technological transformation of the world. For this reason the idea of the oneness of nature induces us to look for the expression of this unity in the first place in physics. In this connection, Weizsacker raises a question which aroused lively discussions in oir literature: Approved For Release 1999/09/26 : CIA-RDP86T00608R000200110034-2 Approved For Release 1999/09/26 : CIA-RDP86T00608R000200110034-2 NIKOLAYEV, I. I., VOPROSY FILOSOFI'I No 11, 1974 pp 158-161 Is it possible to achieve a complete unity in physics by means of the construction of a single, all-embracing theory? If so, then under what conditions its creation is possible? Inasmuch as such a theory will encompass the entire physics, this will confront us with the famous Kant's question: how at all physics is possible as a science? The question of physics acquires a specifically philosophical content. To solve it, Weizsacker takes the traditional path of methodological douot, Con- sidering the logical establishment of absolutely certain and unquestionable Judge- ments, he thinks that as starting basis we should accept that which we always accept by the very fact of our existence. This is the recognition of the objectifiahle experience, i.e. that thanks to which one can \"learn from the past for the future.\" Whereupon, are considered not the individual experiences, but \"the structure of that what is happening, which is necessary to that individual experiences would be at all possible\" (p 217). In considering that upon objectification of judgements is based both physics and conceptual thinking in general, Weizsacker puts forward the following hypothesis: \"Whoever will be able with sufficient power of apprehension to investi- gate under what conditions the experience is at all possible, he should be able to show that from these conditions already follow all general laws of physics. Physics derived in precisely this way would be the supposed single physics\" (p 217). To these conditions belongs, according to Weizsacker, the entity of time, with all its basic modi: variable and in principle known past, present, and indefinite and partly 9/14 NIKOLAYEV, I. I., VOPROSY FILOSOFII No 11, 1974 pp 158-161 dependent on our will future. The single physics should be thus based in contrast to Kant's conception, not on the unity of a transcendental apperception but upon the unity of time. Not limiting himself to a general discussion, Weizsacker outlines a concrete prorrrm of the completion of physics, and considers th'At its final realization is the matter of the near future (of the order of a few decades). For this purpose it is necessary in his opinion, to unify in the first place five fundamental theories of the modern physics: quantum theory, relativity theory, theory of elementary particles, statistical thermodynamics, and cosmology. The quantum theory, in the opinion of Weizsacke, is closest to the conditions of possible experience, and therefore, it is precisely from it (and not from relativity theory, as was considered by ':instein) should be derived the remaining theories. This will be possible after a corresponding modification of quantum mechanics and its transformation into an abstract theory of the change of any object, based on the logic of temporal statements. One of the principal conceptions which are considered by Weizsacker as a means of unification of the abstract quantum theory, \"cybernetlcal biology\", \"cybernetics of truth\", etc? is the conception of information. Information is, on the one hand, 10/14 Approved For Release 1999/09/26 : CIA-RDP86T00608R000200110034-2 Approved For Release 1999/09/26 : CIA-RDP86T00608R000200110034-2 25 Aug 75 21 FPD:SOVIET SCIENCE USSR NIKOLAYEV, I . I , , VOPROSY FILOSOFII No 11, 1974 pp 158-161 objective, and on the other hand, in the same way as probability, relates to the subject, and quantifies knowledge. At the same time Weizsacker approximates the conception of information to the conception of form, and the latter to the Plato's \"ideas\". His further discussions about the conception of information leads him to rather mystical than constructive conclusions. Questionable is, for example, his argument that the limits of physics should be the limits of conceptual thinking in general. He himself asks the question whether such limits exist? If not, then will not the creation of the one and only, \"limiting\" science mean the end to any cognition? Examining these problems, Weizsacker notes that the \"whole reality\" never keeps completely within scientific interpretations. Conceptual thinking depends each time upon conceptually inexpressed (in the given case) premises. Each attempt at making more precise the language of science is associated with the necessary use of the ambiguous, \"inaccurate\" natural language. In contrast to general grounds of experience, the number of particular and individual experiences is innumerable, etc. But all this is not an answer to the question raised by himself. Of interest are the warnings of Weizsacker against scientific \"fetishism\". He writes, in particular: \"If men must defend something of importance, and if they wish 11/14 NIKOLAYEV, I. I., VOPROSY FILOSOFII No 11, 1974 pp 158-161 to be listened to in this world in which the social status of science is almost unshakable, then it is important that they be scientists. But often, having become them, they invent science even there where it does not exist, for it is impossible to turn into science the beautiful, those deep insights, those real spiritual riches, which are in our possession. On the other hand, you must be scientists, otherwise you will not be heard and gill not be recognized. After all, we can quite well play this game, it is rather beautiful game, and I have nothing in particular against it. All I would like to say is that they are committing a great error, not noticing that they play for the play itself, not seeing in the science the curtain behind which there begins the reality\" (p 300). The reality is thus richer than scientific constructions having hypothetical character. Even though from the proposed single abstract physics one can derive all particular laws, it dues not spell the completion of the \"concrete\" physics, since a direct derivation from single principles of any specific theses will prove very cumbersome and inexpedient. There are also no safeguards against changes in the conditions of the possibility of experience. Finally, one cannot exclude the possibility of a completely different type of experience--the nonobjectified one.

Hence Weizsacker shows interest in the phenomenon of religion, primarily in the oriental one (Buddhism, Zen, and Yoga), which enunciated mystical experience in the comprehension of the Only one, In the opinion of the author the recognition of the possibility of meditative experience does not constitute a departure from the rational thinking. But this is a sheer mysticism, groundlessly declaimed in the hook of Weiztacker. His conception contains many questionable theses and is not supported by any arguments. We certainly cannot agree with assertion that he is \"above\" materialism and idealism. Actually it amounts to an eclectic combination of the elemen1a of various philosophical systems, where frequently an objective idealistic tendency predominates, Improper are his attempts to overcome the \"limitations\" of the theory of reflection by a \"theory of concordance, to reconcile science with religion, etc. Nevertheless, based on an extensive historico-philosophical and special scientific material his book has made an interesting attempt at analyzing the problem of the oneness of Nature in all the diversity of its aspects and to work out an original program for the construction of a single science.

Since the 1950s his name has been intimately associated with development of the theory of automated control. Uls profound research on problems of aircraft landings has been of great significance. The results which he obtained in this area have become a part of normal flight practice; they appear in all textbooks and manuals on the theory of automated flight control. G. S. Pospelov's second significant period of scientific research has been associated with developing the theory and solving a number of important practical problems relati!,g to lr rge technical and organizational systems. Pospelov was one of the first in our ccuntry to realize the promise of the research of such systems. Thanks to his efforts, the USSR has created scientific collectives which are now working fruitfully toward the realization of complex automated control systems for various purposes, Prof. Pospelov is by right considered one of the founders of Systems-programming methods used in national economic planning. USSR G. S. POSPELOV, IZVESTIYA AKADEMIYA NAUK SSSR, No 4, 1974 His broad scientific outlook and engineering expertise have always enabled him to arrive at bold and correct solutions to complox scientific-technical problems.

A LOOK UNDER THE ROOF ON THE WORLD Kiev PRAVDA UKRAINY in Russian 3 Jul 75 p 4 FText] An international conference of geophysicists of the Soviet Union, India, and Italy, organised by the Interdepartmental Geophysical Committee of the Academy of Sciences USSR and the Kiev Institute of Geophysics of the Academy of Sciences Ukrainian SSR, was held in the capital of Ukraine. The cbject of the conference was to develop concrete plans for further joint geophysical explorations of the Pamir- Himalayan mountain chain belt the interior regions of which as yet remain an unsolved riddle to geologists. The work will be carried out in accordance with the UNESCO international geodynamic project, and is to be a continuation of the so-called unique Himalayan seismic experiment conducted last year on the Pamirs by Soviet geophysicists. The sounding of the interior regions of the highest mountain system on the globe will be accomplished by the deep seismic probing method developed by Soviet scien- tists. The method is based on utilizing the energy generated by powerful artificial FEDOROVICH, B., PRAVDA UKRAINY 3 Jul 75 p 4 earthquake explosions induced, as a rule, by several tons of explosive materials. The exploratory seismic waves are considerably more effective than the traditional seismic prospecting waves. Not only are they capable of exploring the upper part of the Earth's crust, but capable also of penetrating the interior regions of the planet by many tens of kilometers. The waves when refracted by the most solid Dyers of mountain rocks, revert and are registered by highly sensitive seismographs, thereby providing information regarding deep geological structures. The initial attempts of the participants in the Soviet-Indian geophysical expedi- tion to peek under the roof of the world produced interesting results. The echo of the peaceful Pamir explosions was heard at a record distance of 500 kilometers in the area o1' the Indian city of Srinagar (Kashmir), the Central Asiatic republics of our country, and Afghanistan and Pakistan. Scientists succeeded in establishing that the borderline between the Earth's crust and the upper mantle of the Earth in the terri- tory that was under investigation is situated at a depth which fluctuates in the unusually wide range of 30 to 70 kilometers. However, is such detailed decoding of the characteristics of the geological and tectonic structure of the earth's interior regions, the Pamir-Himalayan mountain belt in this case, of any scientific and practical importance? Undoubtedly yes.

Secondly, it will make it possible to scan geological history and draw closer to the final cognition of the general laws wt, L.ch\"govern not only the formation of separate analogous regions, but also the present outer configuration of the Earth as a whole. The initial step in the joint efforts of the scientists will involve the shooting of the Trans-Himalayan seismically-explored profile about 1,000 kilometers in length, and which will successively traverse the Pamir-Himalayan mountain system from North to South within the territorial limits of the Soviet Union, AfEhanistan, Pakistan, and Tndia. Further, this profile, in accordance with the agreement between the Academies of Sciences of India :nd USSR and the Indian Council for Industrial and Scientific Research, will be extended to the southern terminus of the Hindustan Peninsula. Deep seismic probing of the entire coastal part of India, in the shallow water zone of the Continental shelf to the Arabian Sea and Bengal Bay will also be conducted. The time is not far off when the treasures which are now hidden under the diffi- culty accessible roof of the world will serve to develop the economies of many countries. 3. 3 L3. USSR KIEV SYMPOSIUM ON X-RAY PHOTOELECTRON SPECTROSCOPY Kiev PRAVDA UKRAINY in Russian 10 Jun 75 0 3 rTextl The Intcrnati,)nal Symposium on X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy was held in Kiev for six days. Physicists from England, East Germany, the USSR, Finland, West Germany, Sweden, and other countries, participated. V. D. Nemoshkalenko, chairman of the organization committee and Corresponding h:ember of the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences, reported to the RATAU (Ukrainian News Agency) correspondent that it is possible, with the use of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, to study the spatial disposition of atoms and the electron links in very thin layers of matter--something before impossible with any other method. This is par;icularly important in verifying theoretical models of new materials, in solving certain problems in chemistry (for example, catalysis), and also in the physics of the surface of a solid body. The Ukrainian Academy of Sciences organized an excursion for the benefit of the participants to the Institute of Metal Physics where theoretical and experimental studies are being made and equipment devised for use in X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. 1/1 Approved For Release 1999/09/26 : CIA-RDP86T00608R000200110034-2 Approved For Release 1999/09/26 : CIA-RDP86T00608R000200110034-2 25 Aug 75 146 FPD:SOVIET SCIENCE 44. UJJH PETROVA, A. SOCIETY of HEMATOLOGISTS AND TRANSFUSION SPECIALISTS Moscow MEDITSINSKAYA GAZ TA in Russian 25 Apr 75 P 3 JAbstractj The new All-Union Scientific Society of Hematologists and Tia nsfusion Specialists held its first session, which a!~tended by various bpecialists, the medical community of Moscow, and 180 representatives from various Union republics; the session was opened by Deputy Minister of Health USSR A. 0. Safonov. The session heard a report by Soviet Minister of Health B. V. Petrovskiy, who discussed the present status and future of hematology and transfusiology, and the prime medical objective of the conquest of cardiovascular, oncological, viral and other diseases. The 1975 Soviet medical budget, he pointed out, amounts to 11 billion rubles. Since 1926 Soviet institutes of hematology and transfusion have risen in number from 1 to 278. At this moment particular stress is being laid on the creation of transfusion departments at large hospitals, and there are now more than 2,000 of these. During the past decade the volume of available donor blood increased by 150 percent, though specialized branches of medicine are still not fully satisfied. The aim is i.o reach 40 unpaid donors per 1,000 population and to increase blood dose to 400 ml. Freezing and prolonged storage of erythrocytes and other blood cells in liquid oxygen is one very promising development; this has led to the creation of special cryogenic apparatus and the establishment of special frozen-blood clinics in a number of cities. One important task is to find new blood pren.irations with marked therapeutic properties, and also immune preparations with specific action. Corresponding Member of the Academy of Medical Sciences USSR 0. K. Gavrilov discusses; Soviet progress in molecular biology, especially molecular hematology stressed five years ago by I. A. Kassirskiy, the aim of which is to influence the molecular structure of the blood and to eliminate the causes of hematological ill- nesses Professc,rs G. Ya. Rozenberg and P. S. Vasil'yev dealt with blood substitutes and preparation.. Professors L. G. Bogomolova, D. M. Grozdov and I. S. Kolesnikov discussed the imposing role of the blood service during World War II.
