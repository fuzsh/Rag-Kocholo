Induced acceleration analysis was performed based on a subject-specific three-dimensional linkage model configured by stance phase gait data and driven by one unit of muscle force. Eight healthy adult subjects were examined in gait analysis. The subtalar inversion/eversion was modeled by offsetting up to 20Â° from the normal subtalar angle while other configurations remained unaltered. This study showed that the gastrocnemius, soleus and tibialis anterior generally functioned as their anatomical definition in normal gait, but counterintuitive function was occasionally found in the bi-articular gastrocnemius. The plantarflexors play important roles in the body support and forward progression. Excessive subtalar eversion was found to enlarge the plantarflexors and tibialis anterior's function. Induced acceleration analysis demonstrated its ability to isolate the contributions of individual muscle to a given factor, and as a means of studying effect of pathological gait on the dynamic muscle functions.

This prospective, controlled study included 28 children diagnosed with spastic diplegic cerebral palsy. Participants were treated either with neuromuscular electrical stimulation application and conventional physiotherapy (group A) or with conventional physiotherapy alone (group B). Outcome was evaluated by clinical (gross motor function, selective motor control, range of motion, spasticity) and ultrasonographic (cross-sectional area, pennation angle, fascicle length of tibialis anterior and gastrocnemius muscles) measurements before and after treatment in both groups. Cross-sectional area values of tibialis anterior (238.7 Â± 61.5 vs. 282.0 Â± 67.1 mm) and gastrocnemius (207.9 Â± 48.0 vs. 229.5 Â± 52.4 mm) (P < 0.001 and P = 0.008, respectively) muscles were increased after treatment in group A. Cross-sectional area values of tibialis anterior muscle were decreased (257.3 Â± 64.7 vs. 239.7 Â± 60.0 mm) after treatment in group B (P < 0.001), and the rest of the measurements were found not to have changed significantly in either group. These results have shown that cross-sectional area of both the agonist and antagonist muscles increased after 20 sessions of neuromuscular electrical stimulation treatment. Future studies with larger samples and longer follow-up are definitely awaited for better evaluation of neuromuscular electrical stimulation application on muscle architecture and its possible correlates in clinical/functional outcome.\n\nChanges in recruitment of Rhesus soleus and gastrocnemius muscles following a 14 day spaceflight\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nHodgson, J. A.; Bodine-Fowler, S. C.; Roy, R. R.; De Leon, R. D.; De Guzman, C. P.; Koslovskaia, I.; Sirota, M.; Edgerton, V. R.\n\n1991-01-01\n\nThe effect of microgravity on the recruitment patterns of the soleus, gastrocnemius, and tibialis-anterior muscles was investigated by comparing electromyograms (EMGs) of these muscles of Rhesus monkeys implanted with EMG electrodes, taken before and after a 14-day flight on board Cosmos 2044. It was found that the EMG amplitude values in the soleus muscle decreased after the spaceflight but returned to normal values over the 2-wk recovery period. The medial amplitudes of gastrocnemius and tibialis anterior were not changed by flight. Joint probability density distributions displayed changes after flight in both the soleus and gastrocnemius muscles, but not in tibialis anterior.\n\nIs tibialis anterior tendon transfer effective for recurrent clubfoot?\n\nPubMed\n\nGray, Kelly; Burns, Joshua; Little, David; Bellemore, Michael; Gibbons, Paul\n\n2014-02-01\n\nTibialis anterior tendon transfer surgery forms a part of Ponseti management for children with congenital talipes equinovarus who, after initial correction, present with residual dynamic supination. Although retrospective studies support good outcomes, prospective longitudinal studies in this population are lacking. We assessed strength, plantar loading, ROM, foot alignment, function, satisfaction, and quality of life in patients with clubfoot that recurred after Ponseti casting who met indications for tibialis anterior tendon transfer surgery, and compared them with a group of patients with clubfoot treated with casting but whose deformity did not recur (therefore who were not indicated for tibialis anterior tendon transfer surgery). Twenty children with idiopathic congenital talipes equinovarus indicated for tibialis anterior tendon transfer surgery were recruited. Assessment at baseline (before surgery), and 3, 6, and 12 months (after surgery) included strength (hand-held dynamometry), plantar loading (capacitance transducer matrix platform), ROM (Dimeglio scale), foot alignment (Foot Posture Index(Â©)), function and satisfaction (disease-specific instrument for clubfoot), and quality of life (Infant Toddler Quality of Life Questionnaireâ¢). Outcomes were compared with those of 12 age-matched children with congenital talipes equinovarus not indicated for tibialis anterior tendon transfer surgery. Followup was 100% in the control group and 95% (19 of 20) in the tibialis anterior transfer group. At baseline, the tibialis anterior tendon transfer group had a significantly worse eversion-to-inversion strength ratio, plantar loading, ROM, foot alignment, and function and satisfaction. At 3 months after surgery, eversion-to-inversion strength, plantar loading, and function and satisfaction were no longer different between groups. Improvements were maintained at 12 months after surgery (eversion-to-inversion strength mean difference, 8% body weight; 95% CI, -26% to 11\n\nIntravital multiphoton imaging of mouse tibialis anterior muscle\n\nPubMed Central\n\nLau, Jasmine; Goh, Chi Ching; Devi, Sapna; Keeble, Jo; See, Peter; Ginhoux, Florent; Ng, Lai Guan\n\n2016-01-01\n\nABSTRACT Intravital imaging by multiphoton microscopy is a powerful tool to gain invaluable insight into tissue biology and function. Here, we provide a step-by-step tissue preparation protocol for imaging the mouse tibialis anterior skeletal muscle. Additionally, we include steps for jugular vein catheterization that allow for well-controlled intravenous reagent delivery. Preparation of the tibialis anterior muscle is minimally invasive, reducing the chances of inducing damage and inflammation prior to imaging. The tibialis anterior muscle is useful for imaging leukocyte interaction with vascular endothelium, and to understand muscle contraction biology. Importantly, this model can be easily adapted to study neuromuscular diseases and myopathies.

The specific nerve branches evaluated as possible donor nerves included the nerves to the medial gastrocnemius, the lateral gastrocnemius, and the soleus muscles. All nerve transfers were accomplished using a direct interosseous route and a direct repair (one medial gastrocnemius transfer did require interpositional grafting). The distance from the repair site to the TA muscle was shortest for the transfer using the nerve branch to the soleus. Histologically, the nerve branch to the soleus was most similar to the branch to the TA for both axonal count and cross-sectional area. A two-incision surgical approach using a fibular window (mobilizing a fibular segment after double osteotomy) and interosseous routing of the transfer is proposed.\n\nModulation of plantar pressure and gastrocnemius activity during gait using electrical stimulation of the tibialis anterior in healthy adults\n\nPubMed Central\n\nUeno, Mizuki; Yoshikawa, Yoshiyuki; Terashi, Hiroto; Fujino, Hidemi\n\n2018-01-01\n\nHigh plantar flexor moment during the stance phase is known to cause high plantar pressure under the forefoot; however, the effects on plantar pressure due to a change of gastrocnemius medialis (GM) activity during gait, have not been investigated to date. Reciprocal inhibition is one of the effects of electrical stimulation (ES), and is the automatic antagonist alpha motor neuron inhibition which is evoked by excitation of the agonist muscle. The aim of this study was to investigate the influences of ES of the tibialis anterior (TA) on plantar pressure and the GM activity during gait in healthy adults. ES was applied to the TAs of twenty healthy male adults for 30 minutes at the level of intensity that causes a full range of dorsiflexion in the ankle (frequency; 50 Hz, on-time; 10 sec, off-time; 10 sec). Subjects walked 10 meters before and after ES, and we measured the peak plantar pressure (PP), pressure time integral (PTI), and gait parameters by using an F-scan system. The percentage of integrated electromyogram (%IEMG), active time, onset time, peak time, and cessation time of TA and GM were calculated. PP and PTI under the forefoot, rear foot, and total plantar surface significantly decreased after the application of ES. Meanwhile, changes of gait parameters were not observed. %IEMG and the active time of both muscles did not change; however, onset time and peak time of GM became significantly delayed. ES application to the TA delayed the timing of onset and peak in the GM, and caused the decrease of plantar pressure during gait. The present results suggest that ES to the TA could become a new method for the control of plantar pressure via modulation of GM activity during gait.

Motor unit remodeling leads to declined muscle strength and force steadiness during submaximal contractions which are factors for risk of falls in the elderly. This study investigated the remodeling phenomena in the Tibialis Anterior using sample entropy and higher order statistics. Eighteen young (26.1 Â± 2.9 years) and twelve elderly (68.7 Â± 9.0 years) participants performed isometric dorsiflexion of the ankle at 20% maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) and their Tibialis Anterior (TA) EMG was recorded. Sample entropy, Gaussianity and Linearity Test statistics were calculated from the recorded EMG for each MVC. Shapiro-Wilk test was used to determine normality, and either a two-tail student t-test or Wilcoxon rank sum test was performed to determine significant difference in the EMG features between the young and old cohorts. Results show age-related motor unit remodeling to be depicted by decreased sample entropy (p <; 0.1), increased non-Gaussianity (p <; 0.05) and lesser degree of linearity in the elderly. This is due to the increased sparsity of the MUAPs as a result of the denervation-reinnervation process, and the decrease in total number of motor units.\n\nTibialis anterior volumes and areas in ACL-injured limbs compared with unimpaired.\n\nPubMed\n\nBinder-Macleod, Benjamin I; Buchanan, Thomas S\n\n2006-09-01\n\nPast research has shown that subjects with ACL injuries show activation differences and atrophy in the muscles that cross the knee, including the gastrocnemii, which predominately act at the ankle. However, it is not known how the other ankle muscles that do not cross the knee are affected. We focused on the two muscles that control the ankle, the soleus and tibialis anterior muscles, to see how they were affected by an ACL injury. We hypothesized that the ankle muscles of subjects with ACL injuries that did not require surgery (copers) would be more like normals and that the muscles of subjects with ACL injuries who required surgery to return to normal activity (noncopers) would atrophy. Twenty-seven subjects were divided into three even categories: unimpaired subjects, copers, and noncopers. Axial spin-echo T1-weighted MRI images were used to digitally reconstruct the tibialis anterior and the soleus. We used the digitally reconstructed muscles to determine the peak cross-sectional area and volume of each muscle. The copers' tibialis anterior muscles were similar to the unimpaired subjects, but, surprisingly, the noncoper's tibialis anterior muscles of the injured leg were larger than those of their uninjured legs (P < 0.05). In the soleus, the results showed a trend of not being affected. The increase in size of the tibialis anterior in noncopers may have been caused by altered gait patterns in noncopers. We believe this is due to either an ankle-stiffening strategy during heel strike or from the inversion of the foot causing external rotation of the tibia as a stabilizing technique for the knee.\n\nA Comparative Outcome Study of Hamstring Versus Tibialis Anterior and Synthetic Grafts for Deltoid to Triceps Transfers.\n\nPubMed\n\nDunn, Jennifer A; Mohammed, Khalid D; Beadel, Gordon P; Rothwell, Alastair G; Simcock, Jeremy W\n\n2017-10-01\n\nTo assess elbow extension strength and complications after deltoid-triceps transfers using hamstring tendon graft compared with tibialis anterior and synthetic tendon grafts. A retrospective review of deltoid-triceps transfers in patients with tetraplegia performed between 1983 andÂ 2014. Seventy-five people (136 arms) had surgery performed, with the majority undergoing simultaneous bilateral surgery (nÂ = 61; 81%). Tibialis anterior tendon grafts were used in 68 arms, synthetic grafts in 23 arms, and hamstring tendon grafts in 45 arms. The average age at surgery was 31 years. Sixty-three arms (46%) were assessed between 12 and 24 months after surgery. Seventy percent of the group (nÂ = 54) were able to extend their elbow against gravity (grade 3 of 5 or greater) following surgery. Seventy-nine percent of those with hamstring grafts achieved grade 3 of 5 or more compared with 77% with tibialis anterior and 33% with synthetic grafts. There was a statistically significant difference in postsurgery elbow extension between the tibialis anterior group and the synthetic graft group and the hamstring and the synthetic graft group but not between the tibialis anterior and the hamstring group. Complications occurred in 19 arms (14%), the majority occurring immediately after surgery and associated with the wounds. The remaining complications were with the synthetic graft group in which dehiscence of the proximal attachment occurred in 30% of the arms. Autologous tendon grafting is associated with achievement of antigravity elbow extension in a greater proportion of individuals than with prosthetic grafting. Therapeutic IV.

Methods Wistar rats were divided into four groups, with seven animals each: Control Group, Vanillin Group, Injury Group, and Injury + Vanillin Group. The Injury Group and the Injury + Vanillin Group animals were submitted to nerve injury by compression of the sciatic nerve; the Vanillin Group and Injury + Vanillin Group, were treated daily with oral doses of vanillin (150mg/kg) from the 3rd to the 21st day after induction of nerve injury. At the end of the experiment, the tibialis anterior and soleus muscles were dissected and processed for light microscopy and submitted to morphological analysis. Results The nerve compression promoted morphological changes, typical of denervation, and the treatment with vanillin was responsible for different responses in the studied muscles. For the tibialis anterior, there was an increase in the number of satellite cells, central nuclei and fiber atrophy, as well as fascicular disorganization. In the soleus, only increased vascularization was observed, with no exacerbation of the morphological alterations in the fibers. Conclusion The treatment with vanillin promoted increase in intramuscular vascularization for the muscles studied, with pro-inflammatory potential for tibialis anterior, but not for soleus muscle.

The present study investigates the mutual transmission of reciprocal inhibitory afferent inputs between the tibialis anterior (TA) and triceps surae (soleus and medial gastrocnemius) motor units. We assessed this mutual mechanism in large populations of motor units for building a statistical distribution of the inhibition amplitudes during standardized input to the motor neuron pools to minimize the effect of modulatory pathways. Single motor unit activities were identified using high-density surface electromyography (HDsEMG) recorded from the TA, soleus (Sol), and medial gastrocnemius (GM) muscles during isometric dorsi- and plantarflexion. Reciprocal inhibition on the antagonist muscle was elicited by electrical stimulation of the tibial (TN) or common peroneal nerves (CPN). The probability density distributions of reflex strength for each muscle were estimated to examine the strength of mutual transmission of reciprocal inhibitory input. The results showed that the strength of reciprocal inhibition in the TA motor units was fourfold greater than for the GM and the Sol motor units. This suggests an asymmetric transmission of reciprocal inhibition between ankle extensor and flexor muscles. This asymmetry cannot be explained by differences in motor unit type composition between the investigated muscles since we sampled low-threshold motor units in all cases. Therefore, the differences observed for the strength of inhibition are presumably due to a differential reciprocal spindle afferent input and the relative contribution of nonreciprocal inhibitory pathways. NEW & NOTEWORTHY We investigated the mutual transmission of reciprocal inhibition in large samples of motor units using a standardized input (electrical stimulation) to the motor neurons. The results demonstrated that the disynaptic reciprocal inhibition exerted\n\nRelative changes with contraction in the central excitability state of the tibialis anterior and calf muscles.\n\nPubMed Central\n\nFisher, M A\n\n1980-01-01\n\nF responses were recorded from the surface of the tibialis muscle and medial aspect of the soleus muscle in 14 normal subjects. The persistence (that is the fraction of measurable F responses found with a series of supramaximal stimuli) and average F amplitudes (measured peak-to-peak and based on at least five F responses) were determined both at rest and with isometric contraction with the ankle maintained at 90 degrees. Although the persistence at rest was significantly less in the tibialis anterior soleus than the (p less than 0.001), no significant difference was found with the muscles contracted. This was associated with a significant increase in both average F amplitudes and average F amplitude/direct motor response ratios in the tibialis anterior in comparison to the soleus. In four of the subjects, studies were also performed when the H reflex in the soleus muscle was eliminated by thigh compression. Comparable changes in both F response persistence and average F amplitude were found with and without an H reflex. These data indicate that, in contrast to the situation at rest, with isometric contraction the \"central excitatory state\" of the tibialis anterior is at least as great as in its antagonist antigravity muscles and that this is not due simply to increased large fiber reflex input associated with agonist contraction. PMID:7373321\n\nUltrasound Imaging of Muscle Contraction of the Tibialis Anterior in Patients with Facioscapulohumeral Dystrophy.\n\nPubMed\n\nGijsbertse, Kaj; Goselink, Rianne; Lassche, Saskia; Nillesen, Maartje; Sprengers, AndrÃ©; Verdonschot, Nico; van Alfen, Nens; de Korte, Chris\n\n2017-11-01\n\nA need exists for biomarkers to diagnose, quantify and longitudinally follow facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) and many other neuromuscular disorders. Furthermore, the pathophysiological mechanisms leading to muscle weakness in most neuromuscular disorders are not completely understood. Dynamic ultrasound imaging (B-mode image sequences) in combination with speckle tracking is an easy, applicable and patient-friendly imaging tool to visualize and quantify muscle deformation. This dynamic information provides insight in the pathophysiological mechanisms and may help to distinguish the various stages of diseased muscle in FSHD. In this proof-of-principle study, we applied a speckle tracking technique to 2-D ultrasound image sequences to quantify the deformation of the tibialis anterior muscle in patients with FSHD and in healthy controls. The resulting deformation patterns were compared with muscle ultrasound echo intensity analysis (a measure of fat infiltration and dystrophy) and clinical outcome measures. Of the four FSHD patients, two patients had severe peroneal weakness and two patients had mild peroneal weakness on clinical examination. We found a markedly varied muscle deformation pattern between these groups: patients with severe peroneal weakness showed a different motion pattern of the tibialis anterior, with overall less displacement of the central tendon region, while healthy patients showed a non-uniform displacement pattern, with the central aponeurosis showing the largest displacement. Hence, dynamic muscle ultrasound of the tibialis anterior muscle in patients with FSHD revealed a distinctively different tissue deformation pattern among persons with and without tibialis anterior weakness. These findings could clarify the understanding of the pathophysiology of muscle weakness in FSHD patients. In addition, the change in muscle deformation shows good correlation with clinical measures and quantitative muscle ultrasound measurements. In\n\nChanges in tibialis anterior corticospinal properties after acute prolonged muscle vibration.\n\nPubMed\n\nFarabet, Adrien; Souron, Robin; Millet, Guillaume Y; Lapole, Thomas\n\n2016-06-01\n\nProlonged local vibration is known to impair muscle performance. While involved mechanisms were previously evidenced at the spinal level, changes at the cortical level were also hypothesized. The aims of the present study were to investigate the effects of 30Â min of 100-Hz tibialis anterior muscle vibration on force production capacities and to further identify the respective changes in spinal loop properties, descending voluntary drive and corticospinal properties. Thirteen subjects were tested before and after a vibration condition, and before and after a resting control condition. Maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) in dorsiflexion was measured. Transcranial magnetic stimulation was superimposed during MVCs to assess cortical voluntary activation (VATMS), motor-evoked potential amplitude (MEP) and cortical silent period length (CSP). MEP and CSP were also measured during 50 and 75Â % MVC contractions. Spinal excitability was investigated by mean of H-reflex. There were no vibration effects on MVC (pÂ =Â 0.805), maximal EMG activity (pÂ =Â 0.653), VATMS (pÂ =Â 1), and CSP (pÂ =Â 0.877). Vibration tended to decrease MEP amplitude (pÂ =Â 0.117). H-reflex amplitude was depressed following vibration (pÂ =Â 0.008). Dorsiflexion maximal force production capacities were unaffected by 30Â min of tibialis anterior muscle vibration, despite spinal loop and corticospinal excitabilities being reduced. These findings suggest that acute prolonged vibration has the potential to modulate corticospinal excitability of lower limb muscles without a concomitant functional consequence.\n\nCytoplasm-to-myonucleus ratios following microgravity.\n\nPubMed\n\nKasper, C E; Xun, L\n\n1996-10-01\n\nThe cytoplasmic volume-to-myonucleus ratio in the tibialis anterior and gastrocnemius muscles of juvenile rats after 5.4 days of microgravity was studied. Three groups of rats (n = 8 each) were used. The experimental group (space rats) was flown aboard the space shuttle Discovery (NASA, STS-48), while two ground-based groups, one hindlimb suspended (suspended rats), one non-suspended (control), served as controls. Single fibre analysis revealed a significant decrease in cross-sectional area (microns2) in the gastrocnemius for both the space and the suspended rats; in the tibialis anterior only the suspended rats showed a significant decrease. Myonuclei counts (myonuclei per mm) in both the tibialis anterior and gastrocnemius were significantly increased in the space rats but not in the suspended rats. The mean myonuclear volume (individual nuclei: microns3) in tibialis anterior fibres from the space rats, and in gastrocnemius fibres from both the space and the suspended rats, was significantly lower than that in the respective control group. Estimation of the total myonuclear volume (microns3 per.mm), however, revealed no significant differences between the three groups in either the tibialis anterior or gastrocnemius. The described changes in the cross-sectional area and myonuclei numbers resulted in significant decreases in the cytoplasmic volume-to-myonucleus ratio (microns3 x 10(3)) in both muscles and for both space and suspended rats (tibialis anterior; 15.6 +/- 0.6 (space), 17.2 +/- 1.0 (suspended), 20.8 +/- 0.9 (control): gastrocnemius; 13.4 +/- 0.4 (space) and 14.9 +/- 1.1 (suspended) versus 18.1 +/- 1.1 (control)). These results indicate that even short periods of unweighting due to microgravity or limb suspension result in changes in skeletal muscle fibres which lead to significant decreases in the cytoplasmic volume-to-myonucleus ratio.\n\nMinimally invasive repair of the tibialis anterior tendon using a semitendinosus autograft.\n\nPubMed\n\nMichels, Frederick; Van Der Bauwhede, Jan; Oosterlinck, Dirk; Thomas, Sam; Guillo, StÃ©phane\n\n2014-03-01\n\nRuptures of the tibialis anterior tendon are rare but can cause substantial functional deficiencies. The literature regarding the treatment of such injuries is very limited. Atraumatic ruptures often occur in the presence of an abnormal tendon structure, and retraction often makes end-to-end repair impossible. With traumatic lesions, the risk of developing both adhesions and scar tissue is high. This study assesses the results of a surgical reconstruction using the interposition of a semitendinosus tendon autograft in 12 patients. Three patients had a traumatic rupture, and 9 patients had an atraumatic rupture. In 8 patients, the procedure was carried out using a minimally invasive technique. The average postoperative American Orthopaedic Foot & Ankle Society (AOFAS) Ankle-Hindfoot score was 95.7 in the atraumatic group and 94.7 in the traumatic group. Active dorsiflexion was possible after 2 to 3 weeks. We believe that the interposition of a strong, healthy tendon facilitated healing and allowed early weight bearing. All patients had good recovery of dorsiflexion and gait. Repairing a ruptured tibialis anterior tendon using a semitendinosus autograft was a reliable technique and offered a good result. With the minimally invasive approach, there was no need to divide the extensor retinaculum, which we believe allowed faster recovery and reduced the risk of adhesions and wound healing problems.

The tibialis anterior muscle flap can be useful in reconstruction of the middle third of the leg with exposed tibia. The aim of this work was to evaluate the efficacy of tibialis anterior pivoted muscle flap for reconstruction of the middle third of the leg with functional preservation. This study, performed in the Plastic, Reconstructive and Burn Unit, Menoufiya University Hospital, Egypt, included 16 patients (13 males and 3 females) during the period February 2007/May 2010: seven post-burn and nine post-traumatic patients with post-burn middle-third leg defects with exposed tibia. Their ages ranged from 14 to 67 years. A function-sparing lateral split tibialis anterior pivoted muscle flap was used in all the patients. Follow-up ranged from six months to two years. Partial flap loss occurred in one patient (6.25%), there was no post-operative haematoma or infection, and only one case of wound dehiscence (6.25%), managed by secondary suture. No donor site morbidity or any significant functional impairment was observed, and the subjective aesthetic results were satisfactory. Lateral split tibialis anterior pivoted muscle flap is a useful, simple technique, allowing rapid, durable and reliable coverage of middle-third leg defects without significant impairment of function and without sacrificing major nerves or vessels in the foot, and without any donor site morbidity.

At the end of the experiment, the tibialis anterior and soleus muscles were dissected and processed for light microscopy and submitted to morphological analysis.

In the soleus, only increased vascularization was observed, with no exacerbation of the morphological alterations in the fibers. The treatment with vanillin promoted increase in intramuscular vascularization for the muscles studied, with pro-inflammatory potential for tibialis anterior, but not for soleus muscle.

Forty-one formalin-fixed human cadaveric specimens were dissected. After preparation of the TAT footprint, standardized photographs were made and the following parameters were evaluated: the footprint length, width, area of insertion, dorsoplantar location, shape, and additional tendon slips. Twenty feet (48.8%) showed an equal insertion at the MC and MT1, another 20 feet (48.8%) had a wide insertion at the MC and a narrow insertion at the MT1, and 1 foot (2.4%) demonstrated a narrow insertion at the MC and a wide insertion at the MT1. Additional tendon slips inserting at the metatarsal shaft were found in two feet (4.8%). Regarding the dorsoplantar orientation, the footprints were located medial in 29 feet (70.7%) and medioplantar in 12 feet (29.3%). The most common shape at the MT1 base was the crescent type (75.6%) and the oval type at the MC (58.5%). The present study provided more detailed data on the dimensions and morphologic types of the tibialis anterior tendon footprint. The established anatomical data may allow for a safer surgical preparation and a more anatomical reconstruction.\n\nDecreased gastrocnemius temporal muscle activation during gait in elderly women with history of recurrent falls.\n\nPubMed\n\nKirkwood, Renata Noce; Trede, Renato Guilherme; Moreira, Bruno de Souza; Kirkwood, Scott Alexander; Pereira, Leani Souza MÃ¡ximo\n\n2011-05-01\n\nGait dysfunction is a strong issue in elderly women with a history of falls. The purpose of this study was to compare the temporal activity of the ankle muscles during gait in elderly women with and without a history of recurrent falls. Eighty-nine (89) elderly women - one group with a history of falls (45) and another group without (44) - participated in the study. The mean range of temporal activation of the gastrocnemius, tibialis anterior and soleus muscles during gait was obtained using electromyography. The muscles were considered active when the signal magnitude surpassed two standard deviations of the minimal magnitude of the average signal per individual. The results showed that the mean range of gastrocnemius muscle activation of the group of recurrent fallers was significantly shorter, 2.9% (16.9Â±5.7%) compared to the group without recurrent falls (19.8Â±6.6%) (p=0.004). The shorter duration in the gastrocnemius muscle activation during stance could possibly affect stability in the support phase, since the gastrocnemius is the main decelerator of the trunk. Clinically, this finding shows the importance of rehabilitation programs for elderly women that focus on strengthening the plantar flexor musculature aiming to reestablish the function and stability of gait and possibly avoiding falls.

[Subjects and Methods] Fifteen children diagnosed with spastic diplegic cerebral palsy were divided randomly into the balance training group and control group. The experimental group only received a multisensory dynamic balance training, while the control group performed general physiotherapy focused balance and muscle strengthening exercise based Neurodevelopmental treatment. Both groups had a therapy session for 30 minutes per day, three times a week for six weeks. The ultrasonographic muscle thickness were obtained in order to compare and analyze muscle thickness before and after in each group. [Result] The experimental group had significant increases in muscle thickness in the rectus femoris, tibialis anterior, medial gastrocnemius and lateral gastrocnemius muscles. The control group had significant increases in muscle thickness in the tibialis anterior. The test results of the rectus femoris, medial gastrocnemius and lateral gastrocnemius muscle thickness values between the groups showed significant differences. [Conclusion] In conclusion, a multisensory dynamic balance training can be recommended as a treatment method for patients with spastic diplegic cerebral palsy.\n\nAge-related differences in muscle activity patterns during walking in healthy individuals.\n\nPubMed\n\nVan Criekinge, Tamaya; Saeys, Wim; Hallemans, Ann; Van de Walle, Patricia; Vereeck, Luc; De Hertogh, Willem; Truijen, Steven\n\n2018-05-26\n\nTo examine how muscle activity over the entire gait cycle changes with increasing age. Electromyography data of the erector spinae, rectus femoris, vastus lateralis, biceps femoris, tibialis anterior and gastrocnemius muscles were collected by an instrumented gait analysis during over ground walking in healthy adults aged between 20 and 89â¯years. Participants were categorized per decade (nâ¯=â¯105, 15 per decade, decades 3-9). Normalized integrated linear envelopes of the electromyographic signal were calculated for one stride. A one way ANOVA using spm1d statistics explored the differences between age groups, followed by a post hoc analysis. While initiation of decline commenced at the age of 60 for erector spinae and tibialis anterior, age-related changes are most pronounced after the age of 80. Concerning timing of muscle activity, subjects in decade 7-9 had prolonged activity and/or early activity of the erector spinae, vastus lateralis, biceps femoris, tibialis anterior and gastrocnemius compared to other decades. Regarding amplitude of muscle activity, decreased peak amplitudes of the erector spinae, rectus femoris, vastus lateralis and gastrocnemius were observed in decades 7-9 compared to other decades. Both timing and amplitude of muscle activation patterns need to be considered to understand the aging process. Regarding the erector spinae, tibialis anterior and vastus lateralis, a decrease in muscle activation coincides with prolonged activity, compared to the gastrocnemius where decreased muscle activation is associated with early activation.

This article is the first large systematic review of the literature on treatment techniques for subcutaneous rupture of TA tendons. Studies for review were identified through a PubMed search. Eligible studies involved cases of closed tendon rupture. Of the 87 cases in the study, 72 were treated with surgery, 15 with conservative measures. Mean age was 63.9 years (surgery group) and 72.4 years (conservative treatment group). Primary repair was used most often for newer injuries, autograft most often for older injuries. Operative repair of subcutaneous TA tendon rupture leads to successful outcomes in many patients. A surgeon who is deciding which operative technique to use for a patient should consider the age of the injury and the findings of intraoperative assessment for tendon necrosis.\n\nRelationship between metabolic cost and muscular coactivation across running speeds.\n\nPubMed\n\nMoore, Isabel S; Jones, Andrew M; Dixon, Sharon J\n\n2014-11-01\n\nMuscular coactivation can help stabilise a joint, but contrasting results in previous gait studies highlight that it is not clear whether this is metabolically beneficial. The aim was to assess the relationship between the metabolic cost of running and muscular coactivation across different running speeds, in addition to assessing the reliability and precision of lower limb muscular coactivation. Eleven female recreational runners visited the laboratory on two separate occasions. On both occasions subjects ran at three speeds (9.1, 11 and 12 km h(-1)) for six minutes each. Oxygen consumption and electromyographic data were simultaneously recorded during the final two minutes of each speed. Temporal coactivations of lower limb muscles during the stance phase were calculated. Five muscles were assessed: rectus femoris, vastus lateralis, biceps femoris, tibialis anterior and gastrocnemius lateralis. Nonparametric correlations revealed at least one significant, positive association between lower limb muscular coactivation and the metabolic cost of running for each speed. The length of tibialis anterior activation and muscular coactivation of the biceps femoris-tibialis anterior and gastrocnemius lateralis-tibialis anterior decreased with speed. These results show that longer coactivations of the proximal (rectus femoris-biceps femoris and vastus lateralis-biceps femoris) and leg extensor (rectus femoris-gastrocnemius lateralis) muscles were related to a greater metabolic cost of running, which could be detrimental to performance. The decrease in coactivation in the flexor and distal muscles at faster speeds occurs due to the shorter duration of tibialis anterior activation as speed increases, yet stability may be maintained.

We matched two groups (remnant-preserving tibialis tendon allograft group and hamstring tendon autograft group) in terms of demographic characteristics, associated injury, and knee characteristics. Each group consisted of 25 patients. Operation time was longer in the remnant-preserving tibialis tendon allograft group, but there was no significant intergroup difference in stability, clinical outcome, and second-look arthroscopic findings. When an autograft is not feasible in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, the remnant-preserving technique can produce comparable results in terms of restoration of function, stability of the knee, and degree of synovium coverage at second-look arthroscopy compared to remnant-sacrificing hamstring autograft.\n\nIntramuscular Electrical Stimulation for Muscle Activation of the Tibialis Anterior After Surgical Repair: A Case Report.\n\nPubMed\n\nHollis, Sharon; McClure, Philip\n\n2017-12-01\n\nBackground Loss of voluntary activation of musculature can result in muscle weakness. External neuromuscular stimulation can be utilized to improve voluntary activation but is often poorly tolerated because of pain associated with required stimulus level. Intramuscular electrical stimulation requires much lower voltage and may be better tolerated, and therefore more effective at restoring voluntary muscle activation. Case Description A 71-year-old man sustained a rupture of the distal attachment of the tibialis anterior tendon. Thirty-two weeks after surgical repair, there was no palpable or visible tension development in the muscle belly or tendon. Dorsiflexion was dependent on toe extensors. Electrical stimulation applied via a dry needling placement in the muscle belly was utilized to induce an isometric contraction. Outcomes Five sessions of intramuscular electrical stimulation were delivered. By day 4 (second visit), the patient was able to dorsiflex without prominent use of the extensor hallucis longus. By day 6 (third visit), active-range-of-motion dorsiflexion with toes flexed increased 20Â° (-10Â° to 10Â°). Eighteen days after the initial treatment, the patient walked without his previous high-step gait pattern, and the tibialis anterior muscle test improved to withstanding moderate resistance (manual muscle test score, 4/5). Discussion The rapid change in muscle function observed suggests that intramuscular electrical stimulation may facilitate voluntary muscle activation. Level of Evidence Therapy, level 5.

After self-reinnervation, mean frequencies of slow (9%) and fast (91%) fibers were similar to those in control (12% and 88%, respectively) muscles. However, a lower proportion of fast-1 (26%) and a higher proportion of fast-2 (65%) fibers were observed in self-reinnervated than control (32% and 56%) muscles. Quantitation of adjacencies between fibers of similar myosin heavy chain (MHC) phenotype, a measure of type grouping, revealed that the frequencies of two slow or two fast-1 fibers being adjacent in self-reinnervated muscles were similar to control. In contrast, the frequency of fast-2/fast-2 fiber adjacencies found in self-reinnervated muscles (45%) was significantly higher than in control muscles (37%). In both groups, the frequency of adjacencies between slow, fast-1, or fast-2 fibers was largely attributable to the number of each fiber type present. These data show that the incidence of grouping within each fiber type present was not altered after 6 months of self-reinnervation. Minimal changes in the spatial distribution of fiber types following self-reinnervation in adults suggests a limited degree of conversion of muscle fibers to a MHC phenotype matching the motoneuron characteristics.\n\nStretch-sensitive paresis and effort perception in hemiparesis.\n\nPubMed\n\nVinti, Maria; Bayle, Nicolas; Hutin, Emilie; Burke, David; Gracies, Jean-Michel\n\n2015-08-01\n\nIn spastic paresis, stretch applied to the antagonist increases its inappropriate recruitment during agonist command (spastic co-contraction). It is unknown whether antagonist stretch: (1) also affects agonist recruitment; (2) alters effort perception. We quantified voluntary activation of ankle dorsiflexors, effort perception, and plantar flexor co-contraction during graded dorsiflexion efforts at two gastrocnemius lengths. Eighteen healthy (age 41 Â± 13) and 18 hemiparetic (age 54 Â± 12) subjects performed light, medium and maximal isometric dorsiflexion efforts with the knee flexed or extended. We determined dorsiflexor torque, Root Mean Square EMG and Agonist Recruitment/Co-contraction Indices (ARI/CCI) from the 500 ms peak voluntary agonist recruitment in a 5-s maximal isometric effort in tibialis anterior, soleus and medial gastrocnemius. Subjects retrospectively reported effort perception on a 10-point visual analog scale. During gastrocnemius stretch in hemiparetic subjects, we observed: (1) a 25 Â± 7 % reduction of tibialis anterior voluntary activation (maximum reduction 98 %; knee extended vs knee flexed; p = 0.007, ANOVA); (2) an increase in dorsiflexion effort perception (p = 0.03, ANCOVA). Such changes did not occur in healthy subjects. Effort perception depended on tibialis anterior recruitment only (Î²ARI(TA) = 0.61, p < 0.01) in healthy subjects (not on gastrocnemius medialis co-contraction) while it depended on both tibialis anterior agonist recruitment (Î²ARI(TA) = 0.41, p < 0.001) and gastrocnemius medialis co-contraction (Î²CCI(MG) = 0.43, p < 0.001) in hemiparetic subjects. In hemiparesis, voluntary ability to recruit agonist motoneurones is impaired--sometimes abolished--by antagonist stretch, a phenomenon defined here as stretch-sensitive paresis. In addition, spastic co-contraction increases effort perception, an additional incentive to evaluate and treat this phenomenon.\n\nEffects of tibialis anterior vibration on postural control when exposed to support surface translations.\n\nPubMed\n\nTemple, David R; Lee, Beom-Chan; Layne, Charles S\n\n2016-03-01\n\nThe sensory re-weighting theory suggests unreliable inputs may be down-weighted to favor more reliable sensory information and thus maintain proper postural control. This study investigated the effects of tibialis anterior (TA) vibration on center of pressure (COP) motion in healthy individuals exposed to support surface translations to further explore the concept of sensory re-weighting. Twenty healthy young adults stood with eyes closed and arms across their chest while exposed to randomized blocks of five trials. Each trial lasted 8âs, with TA vibration either on or off. After 2âs, a sudden backward or forward translation occurred. Anterior-posterior (A/P) COP data were evaluated during the preparatory (first 2âs), perturbation (next 3âs), and recovery (last 3âs) phases to assess the effect of vibration on perturbation response features. The knowledge of an impending perturbation resulted in reduced anterior COP motion with TA vibration in the preparatory phase relative to the magnitude of anterior motion typically observed during TA vibration. During the perturbation phase, vibration did not influence COP motion. However, during the recovery phase vibration induced greater anterior COP motion than during trials without vibration. The fact that TA vibration produced differing effects on COP motion depending upon the phase of the perturbation response may suggest that the immediate context during which postural control is being regulated affects A/P COP responses to TA vibration. This indicates that proprioceptive information is likely continuously re-weighted according to the context in order to maintain effective postural control.\n\nComputational model to investigate the relative contributions of different neuromuscular properties of tibialis anterior on force generated during ankle dorsiflexion.\n\nPubMed\n\nSiddiqi, Ariba; Poosapadi Arjunan, Sridhar; Kumar, Dinesh Kant\n\n2018-01-16\n\nThis study describes a new model of the force generated by tibialis anterior muscle with three new features: single-fiber action potential, twitch force, and pennation angle. This model was used to investigate the relative effects and interaction of ten age-associated neuromuscular parameters. Regression analysis (significance level of 0.05) between the neuromuscular properties and corresponding simulated force produced at the footplate was performed. Standardized slope coefficients were computed to rank the effect of the parameters. The results show that reduction in the average firing rate is the reason for the sharp decline in the force and other factors, such as number of muscle fibers, specific force, pennation angle, and innervation ratio. The fast fiber ratio affects the simulated force through two significant interactions. This study has ranked the individual contributions of the neuromuscular factors to muscle strength decline of the TA and identified firing rate decline as the biggest cause followed by decrease in muscle fiber number and specific force. The strategy for strength preservation for the elderly should focus on improving firing rate.

Identifying neuromuscular characteristics associated with knee-valgus motion, such as hip and lower leg muscle activation, may improve our ability to prevent lower extremity injuries. Objective We hypothesized that hip and lower leg muscle-activation amplitude would differ among individuals displaying knee valgus (medial knee displacement) during a double-legged squat compared with those who did not display knee valgus. We further suggested that the use of a heel lift would alter lower leg muscle activation and frontal-plane knee motion in those demonstrating medial knee displacement. Design Descriptive laboratory study. Setting Research laboratory. Patients or Other Participants A total of 37 healthy participants were assigned to the control (n = 19) or medial-knee-displacement (n = 18) group based on their double-legged squat performance. Main Outcome Measure(s) Muscle-activation amplitude for the gluteus maximus, gluteus medius, adductor magnus, medial and lateral gastrocnemius, and tibialis anterior was measured during 2 double-legged squat tasks. The first task consisted of performing a double-legged squat without a heel lift; the second consisted of performing a double-legged squat task with a 2-in (5.08-cm) lift under the heels. Results Muscle-activation amplitude for the hip adductor, gastrocnemius, and tibialis anterior was greater in those who displayed knee valgus than in those who did not (P < .05). Also, use of heel lifts resulted in decreased activation of the gluteus maximus, hip adductor, gastrocnemius, and tibialis anterior muscles (P < .05). Use of heel lifts also eliminated medially directed frontal-plane knee motion in those displaying medial knee displacement. Conclusions Medial knee displacement during squatting tasks appears to be associated with increased hip-adductor activation and\n\nA model for generating Surface EMG signal of m. Tibialis Anterior.\n\nPubMed\n\nSiddiqi, Ariba; Kumar, Dinesh; Arjunan, Sridhar P\n\n2014-01-01\n\nA model that simulates surface electromyogram (sEMG) signal of m. Tibialis Anterior has been developed and tested. This has a firing rate equation that is based on experimental findings. It also has a recruitment threshold that is based on observed statistical distribution. Importantly, it has considered both, slow and fast type which has been distinguished based on their conduction velocity. This model has assumed that the deeper unipennate half of the muscle does not contribute significantly to the potential induced on the surface of the muscle and has approximated the muscle to have parallel structure. The model was validated by comparing the simulated and the experimental sEMG signal recordings. Experiments were conducted on eight subjects who performed isometric dorsiflexion at 10, 20, 30, 50, 75, and 100% maximal voluntary contraction. Normalized root mean square and median frequency of the experimental and simulated EMG signal were computed and the slopes of the linearity with the force were statistically analyzed. The gradients were found to be similar (p>0.05) for both experimental and simulated sEMG signal, validating the proposed model.\n\nChanges in Muscle Cell Metabolism and Mechanotransduction Are Associated with Myopathic Phenotype in a Mouse Model of Collagen VI Deficiency\n\nPubMed Central\n\nDe Palma, Sara; Leone, Roberta; Grumati, Paolo; Vasso, Michele; Polishchuk, Roman; Capitanio, Daniele; Braghetta, Paola; Bernardi, Paolo; Bonaldo, Paolo; Gelfi, Cecilia\n\n2013-01-01\n\nThis study identifies metabolic and protein phenotypic alterations in gastrocnemius, tibialis anterior and diaphragm muscles of Col6a1â/â mice, a model of human collagen VI myopathies. All three muscles of Col6a1â/â mice show some common changes in proteins involved in metabolism, resulting in decreased glycolysis and in changes of the TCA cycle fluxes. These changes lead to a different fate of Î±-ketoglutarate, with production of anabolic substrates in gastrocnemius and tibialis anterior, and with lipotoxicity in diaphragm.

[Subjects and Methods] 28 adults with functional ankle instability, divided randomly into an experimental group, which performed balance training by applying knee joint movements for 20 minutes and ankle joint exercises for 10 minutes, and a control group, which performed ankle joint exercise for 30 minutes. Exercises were completed three times a week for 8 weeks. Electromyographic values of the tibialis anterior, peroneus longus, peroneus brevis, and the lateral gastrocnemius muscles were obtained to compare and analyze muscle activity before and after the experiments in each group. [Results] The experimental group had significant increases in muscle activity in the tibialis anterior, peroneus longus, and lateral gastrocnemius muscles, while muscle activity in the peroneus brevis increased without significance. The control group had significant increases in muscle activity in the tibialis anterior and peroneus longus, while muscle activity in the peroneus brevis and lateral gastrocnemius muscles increased without significance. [Conclusion] In conclusion, balance training by applying knee joint movements can be recommended as a treatment method for patients with functional ankle instability.\n\nIntramuscular pressure varies with depth. The tibialis anterior muscle studied in 12 volunteers\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nNakhostine, M.; Styf, J. R.; van Leuven, S.; Hargens, A. R.; Gershuni, D. H.\n\n1993-01-01\n\nPressures in the tibialis anterior muscle were recorded at rest and during exercise with transducer-tipped catheters in 12 volunteers while they were supine or standing. The recordings were repeated with venous stasis created by an inflated tourniquet cuff on the thigh. Catheters were placed at 3 different sites in the muscle: catheter I adjacent to the deep surface of the fascia over the anterior compartment; catheter II between the fascia and the central tendon; and catheter III deep in the muscle close to the interosseous membrane. In both the supine and standing positions the intramuscular pressure at rest and the muscle relaxation pressure during exercise, obtained by catheter II, were greater than the corresponding pressures measured by the superficially located catheter I in the normal as well as in the volume loaded limb. The same conditions for pressure measurement consistently revealed lower pressures recorded by catheter III compared to II, but the difference was not significant. Our results indicate that intramuscular pressure increases centripetally, as the centrally lying tendon is approached. We conclude that pressure measurements for diagnosis of acute and chronic compartment syndromes and in ergonomic studies should be based on recordings from a standard location of the catheter within the muscle and a standard posture of the subject.\n\nFunctional Outcomes Following Anterior Transfer of the Tibialis Posterior Tendon for Foot Drop Secondary to Peroneal Nerve Palsy.\n\nPubMed\n\nCho, Byung-Ki; Park, Kyoung-Jin; Choi, Seung-Myung; Im, Se-Hyuk; SooHoo, Nelson F\n\n2017-06-01\n\nThis retrospective comparative study reports the practical function in daily and sports activities after tibialis posterior tendon transfer for foot drop secondary to peroneal nerve palsy. Seventeen patients were followed for a minimum of 3 years after tibialis posterior tendon transfer for foot drop secondary to peroneal nerve palsy. Matched controls were used to evaluate the level of functional restoration. Functional evaluations included American Orthopaedic Foot & Ankle Society (AOFAS) scores, Foot and Ankle Outcome Score (FAOS), Foot and Ankle Ability Measure (FAAM) scores, and isokinetic muscle strength test. Radiographic evaluation for the changes of postoperative foot alignment included Meary angle, calcaneal pitch angle, hindfoot alignment angle, and navicular height. Mean AOFAS, FAOS, and FAAM scores significantly improved from 65.1 to 86.2, 55.6 to 87.8, and 45.7 to 84.4 points at final follow-up, respectively. However, all functional evaluation scores were significantly lower as compared to the control group ( P < .001). Mean peak torque (60 degrees/sec) of ankle dorsiflexors, plantarflexors, invertors, and evertors at final follow-up were 7.1 (deficit ratio of 65.4%), 39.2, 9.8, and 7.3 Nm, respectively. These muscle strengths were significantly lower compared to the control group ( P < .001). No significant differences in radiographic measurements were found, and no patients presented with a postoperative flat foot deformity. One patient (5.9%) needed an ankle-foot orthosis for occupational activity. Anterior transfer of the tibialis posterior tendon appears to be an effective surgical option for paralytic foot drop secondary to peroneal nerve palsy. Although restoration of dorsiflexion strength postoperatively was about 33% of the normal ankle, function in daily activities and gait ability were satisfactorily improved. In addition, tibialis posterior tendon transfer demonstrated no definitive radiographic or clinical progression to postoperative flat\n\nAge related neuromuscular changes in sEMG of m. Tibialis Anterior using higher order statistics (Gaussianity & linearity test).\n\nPubMed\n\nSiddiqi, Ariba; Arjunan, Sridhar P; Kumar, Dinesh K\n\n2016-08-01\n\nAge-associated changes in the surface electromyogram (sEMG) of Tibialis Anterior (TA) muscle can be attributable to neuromuscular alterations that precede strength loss. We have used our sEMG model of the Tibialis Anterior to interpret the age-related changes and compared with the experimental sEMG. Eighteen young (20-30 years) and 18 older (60-85 years) performed isometric dorsiflexion at 6 different percentage levels of maximum voluntary contractions (MVC), and their sEMG from the TA muscle was recorded. Six different age-related changes in the neuromuscular system were simulated using the sEMG model at the same MVCs as the experiment. The maximal power of the spectrum, Gaussianity and Linearity Test Statistics were computed from the simulated and experimental sEMG. A correlation analysis at Î±=0.05 was performed between the simulated and experimental age-related change in the sEMG features. The results show the loss in motor units was distinguished by the Gaussianity and Linearity test statistics; while the maximal power of the PSD distinguished between the muscular factors. The simulated condition of 40% loss of motor units with halved the number of fast fibers best correlated with the age-related change observed in the experimental sEMG higher order statistical features. The simulated aging condition found by this study corresponds with the moderate motor unit remodelling and negligible strength loss reported in literature for the cohorts aged 60-70 years.\n\nComparison of calf muscle architecture between Asian children with spastic cerebral palsy and typically developing peers\n\nPubMed Central\n\nLi, Jinling; Guan, Buyun; Tang, Hongmei\n\n2018-01-01\n\nObjective To compare the muscle thickness, fascicle length, and pennation angle of the gastrocnemius, soleus, and tibialis anterior between Asian children with spastic cerebral palsy (CP) and typically developing (TD) peers. Methods This cross-sectional study involved a total of 72 children with hemiplegic CP (n = 24), and diplegic CP (n = 24) and their TD peers (n = 24). Muscle architecture was measured at rest using ultrasound. Clinical measures included gross motor function and a modified Ashworth scale. Results The thicknesses of the tibialis anterior and medial gastrocnemius muscles were smaller in the affected calf of children with CP (p<0.05) than in those of their TD peers. Additionally, the lengths of the lateral gastrocnemius and soleus fascicle were shorter (p<0.05) in children with diplegic CP than in their TD peers. The fascicle length was shorter in the affected calf of children with CP (p<0.05) than in the calves of their TD peers or the unaffected calf of children with hemiplegic CP. However, the length of the lateral gastrocnemius fascicle was similar between the two legs of children with hemiplegic CP. The pennation angles of the medial gastrocnemius and soleus muscles were larger (p<0.05) in the affected calf in children with hemiplegic CP than in the calves of their TD peers. The fascicle length of the lateral gastrocnemius and the thickness of the soleus muscle were positively correlated with gross motor function scores in children with CP (p<0.05). Conclusions Muscle thickness and fascicle length were lower in the affected tibialis anterior, gastrocnemius, and soleus in children with spastic CP. These changes may limit the ability to stand and walk, and indicate a need to strengthen the affected muscle.

Activity of lower limb muscles during squat with and without abdominal drawing-in and Pilates breathing. J Strength Cond Res 31(11): 3018-3023, 2017-The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of abdominal drawing-in and Pilates breathing on the activity of lower limb muscles during squats. Adults (n = 13, 22 Â± 3 years old) with some Pilates experience performed three 60Â° squats under each of the following conditions in a random order: (I) normal breathing, (II) drawing-in maneuver with normal breathing, and (III) drawing-in maneuver with Pilates breathing. Peak-normalized surface electromyography of the rectus femoris, biceps femoris, gastrocnemius medialis, and tibialis anterior during the knee flexion and extension phases of squat exercises was analyzed. There were significant differences among the conditions during the knee flexion phase for the rectus femoris (p = 0.001), biceps femoris (p = 0.038), and tibialis anterior (p = 0.001), with increasing activation from conditions I to III. For the gastrocnemius medialis, there were significant differences among the conditions during the knee extension phase (p = 0.023), with increased activity under condition I. The rectus and biceps femoris activity was higher during the extension vs. flexion phase under conditions I and II. The tibialis anterior activity was higher during the flexion compared with the extension phase under all conditions, and the medial gastrocnemius activity was higher during the extension phase under condition I. Doing squats with abdominal drawing-in and Pilates breathing resulted in increased rectus, biceps femoris, and tibialis anterior activity during the flexion phase, increasing movement stability during squat exercises.\n\nMotor evoked potentials and compound muscle action potentials as prognostic tools for neonates with spina bifida.\n\nPubMed\n\nCuppen, Inge; Geerdink, Niels; Rotteveel, Jan J; Mullaart, Reinier; Roeleveld, Nel; Pasman, Jaco W\n\n2013-03-01\n\nMEPs and CMAPs as prognostic tools for spina bifida. The aim of this prospective study was to determine the prognostic value of neurophysiological investigations compared to clinical neurological examination in infants with spina bifida. Thirty-six neonates born with spina bifida between 2002 and 2007 were evaluated and followed for 2 years. Lumbar motor evoked potentials (MEPs) and compound muscle action potentials (CMAPs) were obtained at the median age of 2 days old before surgical closure of the spinal anomaly. MEPs were recorded from the quadriceps femoris, tibialis anterior, and gastrocnemius muscles and CMAPs from the latter two muscles. Areas under the curve and latencies of the MEPs and CMAPs were measured. Clinical neurological outcome at the age of 2 years was described using Muscle Function Classes (MFCs) and ambulation status. The areas under the curve of MEPs and CMAPs in the legs were associated with lower neonatal levels of motor and sensory impairment. Better muscle function class of the lower limbs at 2 years of age was associated with larger MEP and CMAP areas of the gastrocnemius and tibialis anterior muscles at neonatal age. MEPs and CMAPs of the gastrocnemius and tibialis anterior muscles are of prognostic value for clinical neurological outcome in neonates born with spina bifida.

Under resting conditions, already, the tissue oxygen partial pressure in the m. tibialis anterior (pO2im) is reduced to about 50% compared to healthy subjects. In the framework of this study the pO2im of patients with PAOD stage II according to Fontaine (n=16) in the m. tibialis anterior was measured under resting conditions and during walking on a treadmill in comparison to healthy subjects (n=10). Under resting conditions the pO2im only marginally differed between PAOD patients and healthy subjects. But during exercise the pO2im dropped significantly more severely in PAOD patients and a return to baseline values could only be reached when the treadmill was stopped and the patients stood still. The pO2im minima correlated clearly with the clinical symptom of calf pain. The data revealed that the pO2im values were lower in PAOD patients and dropped significantly faster during walking compared to the pO2im values in healthy subjects. The pO2im decrease correlated with the calf pain occurring when the pO2im values approached or fell below 10 mmHg.\n\nElectromyographic analysis of standing posture and demi-pliÃ© in ballet and modern dancers.\n\nPubMed\n\nTrepman, E; Gellman, R E; Solomon, R; Murthy, K R; Micheli, L J; De Luca, C J\n\n1994-06-01\n\nSurface electromyography was used to analyze lower extremity muscle activity during standing posture and demi-pliÃ© in first position with lower extremities turned out, in five ballet and seven modern female professional dancers. In standing posture, increased electromyographic (EMG) activity above baseline was detected most frequently at the medial gastrocnemius (54% standing repetitions) and tibialis anterior (29%) electrodes (all dancers); in ballet dancers, increased EMG activity during standing was significantly less frequent at the medial gastrocnemius, but more frequent at the tibialis anterior, than in modern dancers. In demi-pliÃ©, the tibialis anterior had a discrete peak of EMG activity at midcycle in all dancers (97% demi-pliÃ©s). All dancers also had midcycle EMG activity in both vastus lateralis and medialis (100% demi-pliÃ©s). At the end of rising phase of demi-pliÃ©, ballet dancers had greater EMG activity than at midcycle in vastus lateralis (100% demi-pliÃ©s) and medialis (92%); in modern dancers, end-rising phase voltage was lower than at midcycle for vastus lateralis (71% demi-pliÃ©s) and medialis (83%). Genu recurvatum > or = 10 degrees was observed at the beginning and end of demi-pliÃ© in all ballet dancers, but not in modern dancers. There was marked variation of EMG activity during demi-pliÃ© in the lateral gastrocnemius, medial gastrocnemius, gluteus maximus, hamstrings, and adductors. The results support the hypothesis that ballet and modern dancers have different patterns of muscle use in standing posture and demi-pliÃ©, which in part may be a result of differences in genu recurvatum and turnout between the two groups.\n\n[Rupture of the tendon of the tibialis anterior muscle : Etiology, clinical symptoms and treatment].\n\nPubMed\n\nWaizy, H; Bouillon, B; Stukenborg-Colsman, C; Yao, D; Ettinger, S; Claassen, L; Plaass, C; Danniilidis, K; Arbab, D\n\n2017-12-01\n\nRuptures of the tendon of the tibialis anterior muscle tend to occur in the context of degenerative impairments. This mainly affects the distal avascular portion of the tendon. Owing to the good compensation through the extensor hallucis longus and extensor digitorum muscles, diagnosis is often delayed. In addition to the clinical examination, magnetic resonance inaging (MRI) diagnostics are of particular importance, although damage or rupture of the tendon can also be demonstrated sonographically. Therapeutic measures include conservative or operative measures, depending on the clinical symptoms. Conservative stabilization of the ankle can be achieved by avoiding plantar flexion using a peroneal orthosis or an ankle-foot orthosis. Subsequent problems, such as metatarsalgia or overloading of the medial foot edge can be addressed by insoles or a corresponding shoe adjustment. An operative procedure is indicated when there is corresponding suffering due to pressure and functional impairment. The direct end-to-end reconstruction of the tendon is only rarely possible in cases of delayed diagnosis due to the degenerative situation and the retraction of the tendon stumps. Depending on the defect size and the tendon quality, various operative techniques, such as rotationplasty, free transplants or tendon transfer can be used.\n\nAge-Associated Changes in the Spectral and Statistical Parameters of Surface Electromyogram of Tibialis Anterior.\n\nPubMed\n\nSiddiqi, Ariba; Arjunan, Sridhar Poosapadi; Kumar, Dinesh Kant\n\n2016-01-01\n\nAge-related neuromuscular change of Tibialis Anterior (TA) is a leading cause of muscle strength decline among the elderly. This study has established the baseline for age-associated changes in sEMG of TA at different levels of voluntary contraction. We have investigated the use of Gaussianity and maximal power of the power spectral density (PSD) as suitable features to identify age-associated changes in the surface electromyogram (sEMG). Eighteen younger (20-30 years) and 18 older (60-85 years) cohorts completed two trials of isometric dorsiflexion at four different force levels between 10% and 50% of the maximal voluntary contraction. Gaussianity and maximal power of the PSD of sEMG were determined. Results show a significant increase in sEMG's maximal power of the PSD and Gaussianity with increase in force for both cohorts. It was also observed that older cohorts had higher maximal power of the PSD and lower Gaussianity. These age-related differences observed in the PSD and Gaussianity could be due to motor unit remodelling. This can be useful for noninvasive tracking of age-associated neuromuscular changes.\n\nThree-Dimensional Muscle Architecture and Comprehensive Dynamic Properties of Rabbit Gastrocnemius, Plantaris and Soleus: Input for Simulation Studies\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSiebert, Tobias; Leichsenring, Kay; Rode, Christian; Wick, Carolin; Stutzig, Norman; Schubert, Harald; Blickhan, Reinhard; BÃ¶l, Markus\n\n2015-01-01\n\nThe vastly increasing number of neuro-muscular simulation studies (with increasing numbers of muscles used per simulation) is in sharp contrast to a narrow database of necessary muscle parameters. Simulation results depend heavily on rough parameter estimates often obtained by scaling of one muscle parameter set. However, in vivo muscles differ in their individual properties and architecture. Here we provide a comprehensive dataset of dynamic (n = 6 per muscle) and geometric (three-dimensional architecture, n = 3 per muscle) muscle properties of the rabbit calf muscles gastrocnemius, plantaris, and soleus. For completeness we provide the dynamic muscle properties for further important shank muscles (flexor digitorum longus, extensor digitorum longus, and tibialis anterior; n = 1 per muscle). Maximum shortening velocity (normalized to optimal fiber length) of the gastrocnemius is about twice that of soleus, while plantaris showed an intermediate value. The force-velocity relation is similar for gastrocnemius and plantaris but is much more bent for the soleus. Although the muscles vary greatly in their three-dimensional architecture their mean pennation angle and normalized force-length relationships are almost similar. Forces of the muscles were enhanced in the isometric phase following stretching and were depressed following shortening compared to the corresponding isometric forces. While the enhancement was independent of the ramp velocity, the depression was inversely related to the ramp velocity. The lowest effect strength for soleus supports the idea that these effects adapt to muscle function. The careful acquisition of typical dynamical parameters (e.g. force-length and force-velocity relations, force elongation relations of passive components), enhancement and depression effects, and 3D muscle architecture of calf muscles provides valuable comprehensive datasets for e.g. simulations with neuro-muscular models, development of more realistic muscle models, or\n\nSupraspinal control of automatic postural responses in people with multiple sclerosis.\n\nPubMed\n\nPeterson, D S; Gera, G; Horak, F B; Fling, B W\n\n2016-06-01\n\nThe neural underpinnings of delayed automatic postural responses in people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS) are unclear. We assessed whether white matter pathways of two supraspinal regions (the cortical proprioceptive Broadman's Area-3; and the balance/locomotor-related pedunculopontine nucleus) were related to delayed postural muscle response latencies in response to external perturbations. 19 PwMS (48.8Â±11.4years; EDSS=3.5 (range: 2-4)) and 12 healthy adults (51.7Â±12.2years) underwent 20 discrete, backward translations of a support surface. Onset latency of agonist (medial-gastrocnemius) and antagonist (tibialis anterior) muscles were assessed. Diffusion tensor imaging assessed white-matter integrity (i.e. radial diffusivity) of cortical proprioceptive and balance/locomotor-related tracts. Latency of the tibialis anterior, but not medial gastrocnemius was larger in PwMS than control subjects (p=0.012 and 0.071, respectively). Radial diffusivity of balance/locomotor tracts was higher (worse) in PwMS than control subjects (p=0.004), and was significantly correlated with tibialis (p=0.002), but not gastrocnemius (p=0.06) onset latency. Diffusivity of cortical proprioceptive tracts was not correlated with muscle onset. Lesions in supraspinal structures including the pedunculopontine nucleus balance/locomotor network may contribute to delayed onset of postural muscle activity in PwMS, contributing to balance deficits in PwMS.

We disturbed the postural stability of standing human subjects with sudden toe-up ankle rotations. To influence the subjects' cognitive set, we varied the rotation amplitude either predictably (serial 4 degrees versus serial 10 degrees) or unpredictably (random mixture of 4 degrees and 10 degrees). The subjects' responses to these ankle rotations were assessed from the EMG activity of the tibialis anterior, the medial gastrocnemius, and the vastus lateralis muscles of the left leg. The results indicate that, when the rotation amplitude is predictable, only the amplitude of the long latency (LL) response in tibialis anterior and vastus lateralis varied directly with perturbation size. Furthermore, when the rotation amplitude is unpredictable, the central nervous system selects a default amplitude for the LL response in the tibialis anterior. When normal subjects are exposed to 2 perturbation amplitudes which include the potential risk of falling, the default LL response in tibialis anterior appropriately anticipates the larger amplitude perturbation rather than the smaller or an intermediate one.\n\nNeurotized lateral gastrocnemius muscle transfer for persistent traumatic peroneal nerve palsy: Surgical technique.\n\nPubMed\n\nLeclÃ¨re, F M; Badur, N; Mathys, L; VÃ¶gelin, E\n\n2015-08-01\n\nPersistent traumatic peroneal nerve palsy, following nerve surgery failure, is usually treated by tendon transfer or more recently by tibial nerve transfer. However, when there is destruction of the tibial anterior muscle, an isolated nerve transfer is not possible. In this article, we present the key steps and surgical tips for the Ninkovic procedure including transposition of the neurotized lateral gastrocnemius muscle with the aim of restoring active voluntary dorsiflexion. The transposition of the lateral head of the gastrocnemius muscle to the tendons of the anterior tibial muscle group, with simultaneous transposition of the intact proximal end of the deep peroneal nerve to the tibial nerve of the gastrocnemius muscle by microsurgical neurorrhaphy is performed in one stage. It includes 10 key steps which are described in this article. Since 1994, three clinical series have highlighted the advantages of this technique. Functional and subjective results are discussed. We review the indications and limitations of the technique. Early clinical results after neurotized lateral gastrocnemius muscle transfer appear excellent; however, they still need to be compared with conventional tendon transfer procedures. Clinical studies are likely to be conducted in this area largely due to the frequency of persistant peroneal nerve palsy and the limitations of functional options in cases of longstanding peripheral nerve palsy, anterior tibial muscle atrophy or destruction.

The present study investigated differences in muscle activation during acute bouts of barefoot and shod running, in minimalist shoe users. 8 male participants ran on a motorized treadmill for 10âmin under both conditions, at 70% maximal aerobic speed. Electromyographic data were sampled from the biceps femoris, gluteus maximus, gastrocnemius medialis, tibialis anterior, and vastus lateralis during both swing and stance. Root-mean-square analysis of electromyographic data was conducted to compare muscle activation between conditions. During stance, barefoot running resulted in greater muscle activity in gastrocnemius medialis and gluteus maximus, and lower muscle activity in tibialis anterior. During swing, barefoot running resulted in increased muscle activity in vastus lateralis and gastrocnemius medialus. These results indicate that, for minimalist shoe users, an acute bout of barefoot running results in significantly different lower-limb muscle activity. Increased activation in the above muscles presents a possible mechanism for injury, which should be considered during exercise prescription.

I.; Manchester, Jill K.; Lowry, Oliver H.\n\n1992-01-01\n\nSelected enzymes of energy metabolism were measured in random individual fibers of soleus and tibialis anterior (TA) muscles from rats exposed for 2 wk to spaceflight (F) aboard Cosmos 2044 or tail suspension (T) and from synchronous controls. Average size of soleus fibers (dry weight per unit length) was reduced 37 percent in F and T fibers; there was little change in Ta fibers. Enzyme changes were more pronounced in soleus than in TA fibers. Three enzymes characteristic of fast-twitch muscles, pyruvate kinase, glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and 1-phosphofructokinase, were elevated in F and T soleus fibers, but changes in phosphofructokinase were not statistically significant. In TA fibers analyzed for hexokinase, malate dehydrogenase, phosphohexoisomerase, and pyruvate kinase, only hexokinase and malate dehydrogenase showed significant changes. Hexokinase incresed 83 percent in one of two T muscles. Enzyme data for TA fibers typed by myosin adenosinetriphosphatase were more informative: phosphofructokinase, phosphorylase, and glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were increased in type IIn fibers of either F or T muscles or both. Malate dehydrogenase was not changed in fibers of any type in either F or T muscle.\n\nAge-Associated Changes in the Spectral and Statistical Parameters of Surface Electromyogram of Tibialis Anterior\n\nPubMed Central\n\n2016-01-01\n\nAge-related neuromuscular change of Tibialis Anterior (TA) is a leading cause of muscle strength decline among the elderly. This study has established the baseline for age-associated changes in sEMG of TA at different levels of voluntary contraction. We have investigated the use of Gaussianity and maximal power of the power spectral density (PSD) as suitable features to identify age-associated changes in the surface electromyogram (sEMG). Eighteen younger (20â30 years) and 18 older (60â85 years) cohorts completed two trials of isometric dorsiflexion at four different force levels between 10% and 50% of the maximal voluntary contraction. Gaussianity and maximal power of the PSD of sEMG were determined. Results show a significant increase in sEMG's maximal power of the PSD and Gaussianity with increase in force for both cohorts. It was also observed that older cohorts had higher maximal power of the PSD and lower Gaussianity. These age-related differences observed in the PSD and Gaussianity could be due to motor unit remodelling. This can be useful for noninvasive tracking of age-associated neuromuscular changes.

Its location can be determined by using arranged surface linear electrode arrays. Typically, voluntary muscle contractions (VC) are used in this method. However, it also may be necessary to locate the IZ under clinical conditions such as spasticity, in which this type of contraction is difficult to perform. Therefore, contractions imposed by electrostimulation (ES) can be an alternative. There is little background comparing the locations of IZ obtained by two different types of contractions. Evaluate the concordance between using voluntary and imposed contractions from electrostimulation in order to determine the location of the innervation zone of the tibialis anterior muscle in healthy volunteers. The tibialis anterior (TA) muscle of sixteen volunteers (men: 8; women: 8; age: 22.1Â±1.4years, weight: 61.6Â±7.5kg, height: 167.1Â±7.5cm) were evaluated using a linear electrode array. The IZ of the TA muscle was located using two types of muscle contractions, voluntary (10% MVC) and imposed contractions by ES. The concordance between both conditions was evaluated using the Bland-Altman method and the concordance correlation coefficient (CCC). The analyses were applied to the absolute and relative positions to the length of an anatomical landmark frame. CCC for absolute position was 0.98 (p<0.0001, 95% CI [0.98-1.00], and CCC for relative positions also was 0.98 (p<0.0001, 95% CI [0.97-1.00]). The Bland-Altman analysis for absolute data showed an average difference of -0.63mm (SD: 4.1). Whereas, for adjusted data, the average difference was -0.20% (SD: 1.2). The power of the results, based on absolute data, was 98%, whereas for relative data, 82%. In healthy volunteers, there was a substantially concordance between the location of the IZ of the TA muscle derived from using contractions imposed by ES and the location derived from using VC.

Electromyography (EMG) was recorded from the surface and from fine wires in superficial and deep regions of TA. Separate M-wave recruitment curves were constructed for muscle belly and nerve trunk stimulation. During muscle belly stimulation, significantly more current was required to generate M-waves that were 5% of the maximal M-wave (M max; M5%max), 50% M max (M 50%max) and 95% M max (M 95%max) at the deep versus the superficial recording site. In contrast, during nerve trunk stimulation, there were no differences in the current required to reach M5%max, M 50%max or M 95%max between deep and superficial recording sites. Surface EMG reflected activity in both superficial and deep muscle regions. Stimulation over the muscle belly recruited motor units from superficial to deep with increasing stimulation amplitude. Stimulation over the nerve trunk recruited superficial and deep motor units equally, regardless of stimulation amplitude. These results support the idea that where electrical stimulation is applied markedly affects how contractions are produced and have implications for the interpretation of surface EMG data.

Fourteen golfers performed eight swings each using, in random order, a pitching wedge, 7-iron and 4-iron. Surface electromyography (EMG) was recorded bilaterally from lower limb muscles: tibialis anterior, peroneus longus, gastrocnemius medialis, gastrocnemius lateralis, biceps femoris, semitendinosus, gluteus maximus, vastus medialis, rectus femoris and vastus lateralis. Three-dimensional high-speed video analysis was used to determine the golf swing phases. Results showed that, in average handicap golfers, the highest muscle activation levels occurred during the Forward Swing Phase, with the right semitendinosus and the right biceps femoris muscles producing the highest mean activation levels relative to maximal electromyography (70-76% and 68-73% EMG(MAX), respectively). Significant differences between the pitching wedge and the 4-iron club were found in the activation level of the left semitendinosus, right tibialis anterior, right peroneus longus, right vastus medialis, right rectus femuris and right gastrocnemius muscles. The lower limb muscles showed, in most cases and phases, higher mean values of activation on electromyography when golfers performed shots with a 4-iron club.\n\nEffect of diabetic neuropathy severity classified by a fuzzy model in muscle dynamics during gait\n\nPubMed Central\n\n2014-01-01\n\nBackground Electromyography (EMG) alterations during gait, supposedly caused by diabetic sensorimotor polyneuropathy, are subtle and still inconsistent, due to difficulties in defining homogeneous experimental groups with a clear definition of disease stages. Since evaluating these patients involve many uncertainties, the use of a fuzzy model could enable a better discrimination among different stages of diabetic polyneuropathy and lead to a clarification of when changes in muscle activation start occurring. The aim of this study was to investigate EMG patterns during gait in diabetic individuals with different stages of DSP severity, classified by a fuzzy system. Methods 147 subjects were divided into a control group (n = 30) and four diabetic groups: absent (n = 43), mild (n = 30), moderate (n = 16), and severe (n = 28) neuropathy, classified by a fuzzy model. The EMG activity of the vastus lateralis, tibialis anterior, and gastrocnemius medialis were measured during gait. Temporal and relative magnitude variables were compared among groups using ANOVA tests. Results Muscle activity changes are present even before an established neural involvement, with delay in vastus lateralis peak and lower tibialis anterior relative magnitude. These alterations suggest an impaired ankle shock absorption mechanism, with compensation at the knee. This condition seems to be more pronounced in higher degrees of neuropathy, as there is an increased vastus lateralis activity in the mild and severe neuropathy groups. Tibialis anterior onset at terminal stance was anticipated in all diabetic groups; at higher degrees of neuropathy, the gastrocnemius medialis exhibited activity reduction and peak delay. Conclusion EMG alterations in the vastus lateralis and tibialis anterior occur even in the absence of diabetic neuropathy and in mild neuropathic subjects, seemingly causing changes in the shock absorption mechanisms at the heel strike. These changes increase with the onset of neural\n\nEffect of Forefoot Strike on Lower Extrem"
