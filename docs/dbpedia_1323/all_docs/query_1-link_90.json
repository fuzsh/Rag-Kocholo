(Phthalimidoalkyl)acetylenes reacted with decaborane to give the corresponding carboranes; removal of the phthalimido group under mild conditions using sodium borohydride in 2-propanol furnished the (aminoalkyl)carboranes which were isolated as their hydrochloride salts. An alternative approach involved the conversion of an (iodoalkyl)- or a ((tosyloxy)alkyl)carborane to the azido derivative which gave the amine on hydrogenation. An effective way of attaching a carborane moiety to thiouracil, which is selectively taken up in melanoma cells, is illustrated by the acylation of two of these amines with thiouracil-5-carboxylic acid\n\nSynthesis of 1-primary alkylamino-o-carboranes by reduction of 1-primary alkylnitro-o-carboranes\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nZakharkin, L.I.; Ol'shevskaya, V.A.; Vinogradova, L.E.\n\n1999-01-01\n\nBy action of 1-sodium-o-carboranes in liquid ammonia on Î±,Î²-unsaturated nitro compounds an easy addition of 1-sodium-o-carboranes to 1-4 positions of Î±,Î²-unsaturated nitro compounds is observed resulting in o-carborane nitro derivatives. Primary alkylamino-o-carboranes isolated as a hydrochlorides have been prepared by reducing some o-carborane nitro derivatives with LiAlH 4 in ether solutions [ru\n\nSythesis and investigation of m-carborane-containing polybenzimidazoles\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nKorshak, V.V.; Vagin, V.V.; Izyneev, A.A.; Bekasova, N.I.\n\n1975-01-01\n\nNew m-carborane-containing polybenzimidazoles (PBI) have been obtained by chemical cyclization of m-carborane-containing polyaminoamides (PAA) with the N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone-sulphuric anhydride complex or polyphosphoric acid esters being used as the cyclodehydrating reagents.

Reaction of o-carboranoylchloride with 1,4-diaminobutane in pyridine produced nido-carboranoyl(4-amidobutyl)amine, which was linked to the b- and d-monocarboxylic acids and the b,d-dicarboxylic acid of cyanocobalamin. Mass spectrometry analysis as well as 11 B nuclear magnetic resonance demonstrated that during the reaction of o-carboranonylchloride with diaminobutane one of the boron atoms was eliminated. In vitro biological activity of the cyanocobalamin-nido-carborane conjugates was assessed by the unsaturated vitamin B 12 binding capacity assay. When compared with 57 Co cyanocobalamin, the biological activity of cyanocobalamin-b-nido-carborane, cyanocobalamin-d-nido-carborane, and cyanocobalamin-b-d-bis-nido-carborane conjugates were 92.93%, 35.75%, and 37.02%, respectively. These findings suggest that the 10 B cobalamin conjugates might be useful agents in treating malignant tumors via neutron capture therapy\n\nProtonation of 1-alkyl-2-allyllithium-0-carboranes and 1-methyl-2-allylmaonesium chloride-0-carborane\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nIvanova, N.N.; Kazantsev, A.V.; Zakharkin, L.I.\n\n1975-01-01\n\nThe ratio of 1-alkyl-2-allyl and 1-alkyl-2-propenyl-0-carboranes generated in protonation of 1-alkyl-2-lithium allyl-0-carboranes with various protolytic agents in ether, THF and liquid ammonia depends on the nature of protolytic agent and solvent. The rat:o of these allyl and propenyl isomers is also affected by steric effects of the protolytic agent and 0-carborane nucleus\n\nNido-Carborane building-block reagents. 3. Cyclic and open-chain oligomers incorporating -CB4H6C - units. Crown carboranes\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nBoyter, H.A. Jr.; Grimes, R.N.\n\n1988-01-01\n\nThe open-chain dialkynes EtCâ¡C(CH 2 ) n Câ¡CEt (n = 4, 6), the trialkyne HCâ¡C(CH 2 ) 5 Câ¡CH, and the cyclic dialkynes CH 2 (CH 2 ) 4 Câ¡C(CH 2 ) n Câ¡C (n = 4-6) were treated with B 5 H 9 and (C 2 H 5 ) 3 to give the corresponding nido-carborane oligomers, in which the original -Câ¡C- units are converted to -CB 4 H 6 C- nido-carborane cages. In each case, all available -Câ¡C- groups were transformed to carborane moieties. No partially converted products (having both carborane and -Câ¡C- groups in the chain) were found; when the B 5 H 9 /-Câ¡C- ratio employed was 2+ and oxidative fusion, forming products incorporating C 4 B 8 cages. The cyclic bis(carborane) CH 2 (CH 2 ) 4 CB 4 H 6 C(CH 2 ) 5 CB 4 H 6 C is an air-stable oil that can be deprotonated but does not under metal-promoted oxidative fusion. All products were characterized by 11 B and 1 H NMR, infrared, visible-uv, and mass spectroscopy, and the 13 C NMR spectra of linear bis(carboranes) are reported. 9 references, 7 figures, 4 tables\n\nSynthesis, radioiodination, and biodistribution of some nido- and closo-monocarbon carborane derivatives\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nWilbur, D. Scott; Hamlin, Donald K.; Srivastava, Rajiv R.; Chyan, Ming-Kuan\n\n2004-01-01\n\nIodination and radioiodination reactions of several anionic nido- and closo-monocarbon carboranes were conducted. Iodinations occurred more rapidly with nido-carboranes than with closo-carboranes. The most rapid iodination and radioiodination reactions occurred with unsubstituted carboranes. C-amino and C-ammonium derivatives did not iodinate under the conditions studied. Both nido- and closo-carboranes with C-NH-acetyl and C-NH-succinyl substituents iodinated, but the nido-carboranes iodinated under milder reaction conditions. Biodistributions of nido-1-succinylamido-[ 131 I]carborane and closo-1-succinylamido-[ 125 I]carborane were similar in mice, but blood clearance of the nido- compound was slower\n\nN,O-Type Carborane-Based Materials\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nJosÃ© Giner Planas\n\n2016-05-01\n\nFull Text Available This review summarizes the synthesis and coordination chemistry of a series of carboranyl ligands containing N,O donors. Such carborane-based ligands are scarcely reported in the literature when compared to other heteroatom-containing donors. The synthetic routes for metal complexes of these N,O-type carborane ligands are summarized and the properties of such complexes are described in detail. Particular attention is paid to the effect that the incorporation of carboranes has into the coordination chemistry of the otherwise carbon-based ligands and the properties of such materials. The reported complexes show a variety of properties such as those used in magnetic, chiroptical, nonlinear optical, catalytic and biomedical applications.\n\nForging Unsupported Metal-Boryl Bonds with Icosahedral Carboranes.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nSaleh, Liban M A; Dziedzic, Rafal M; Khan, Saeed I; Spokoyny, Alexander M\n\n2016-06-13\n\nIn contrast to the plethora of metal-catalyzed cross-coupling methods available for the installation of functional groups on aromatic hydrocarbons, a comparable variety of methods are currently not available for icosahedral carboranes, which are boron-rich three-dimensional aromatic analogues of aryl groups. Part of this is due to the limited understanding of the elementary steps for cross-coupling involving carboranes. Here, we report our efforts in isolating metal-boryl complexes to further our understanding of one of these elementary steps, oxidative addition. Structurally characterized examples of group 10 M-B bonds featuring icosahedral carboranes are completely unknown. Use of mercurocarboranes as a reagent to deliver M-B bonds saw divergent reactivity for platinum and palladium, with a Pt-B bond being isolated for the former, and a rare Pd-Hg bond being formed for the latter.

Some general regularities of chemical reactions involving carborones are revealed. Variations in the physicochemical properties are also considered. Possible mechanisms of reactions with the participation of carboranes are set forth\n\nSynthesis, Amphiphilic Property and Thermal Stability of Novel Main-chain Poly(o-carborane-benzoxazines)\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nYang, Xiaoxue; Han, Guo; Yang, Zhen; Zhang, Xiaoa; Jiang, Shengling; Lyu, Yafei\n\n2017-10-01\n\nFive poly(o-carborane-benzoxazines) were synthesized via Mannich reaction of o-carborane bisphenol, paraformaldehyde, and diamine, and their structures were well characterized. Light transmission and 1H NMR in D2O confirmed that poly(o-carborane-benzoxazines) with PEG segments showed excellent water solubility and amphiphilic property. TGA analyses were conducted under nitrogen and air, and the results showed that the polymers own high initial decomposition temperatures owing to the shielding effect of carborane moiety on its adjacent aromatic structures. Besides, poly(o-carborane-benzoxazines) own high char yield at elevated temperatures, for the boron atom could combine with oxygen from the polymer structure or/and the air and be oxidized to form boron oxide, and thus the polymer weight is retained to a large extent. PEG segments had an adverse effect on the initial decomposition and char yield, and thus their concentration should be adjusted to control the polymerâs thermal stability.\n\nCarborane-stilbene dyads: the influence of substituents and cluster isomers on photoluminescence properties.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nFerrer-Ugalde, A; Cabrera-GonzÃ¡lez, J; JuÃ¡rez-PÃ©rez, E J; Teixidor, F; PÃ©rez-Inestrosa, E; Montenegro, J M; SillanpÃ¤Ã¤, R; Haukka, M; NÃºÃ±ez, R\n\n2017-02-14\n\nTwo novel styrene-containing meta-carborane derivatives substituted at the second carbon cluster atom (C c ) with either a methyl (Me) or a phenyl (Ph) group are introduced herein along with a new set of stilbene-containing ortho- (o-) and meta- (m-) carborane dyads. The latter set of compounds have been prepared from styrene-containing carborane derivatives via a Heck coupling reaction. High regioselectivity has been achieved for these compounds by using a combination of palladium complexes [Pd 2 (dba) 3 ]/[Pd(t-Bu 3 P) 2 ] as a catalytic system, yielding exclusively E isomers. All compounds have been fully characterised and the crystal structures of seven of them were analysed by X-ray diffraction. The absorption spectra of these compounds are similar to those of their respective fluorophore groups (styrene or stilbene), showing a very small influence of the substituent (Me or Ph) linked to the second C c atom or the cluster isomer (o- or m-). On the other hand, fluorescence spectroscopy revealed high emission intensities for Me-o-carborane derivatives, whereas their Ph-o-carborane analogues evidenced an almost total lack of fluorescence, confirming the significant role of the substituent bound to the adjacent C c in o-carboranes. In contrast, all the m-carborane derivatives display similar photoluminescence (PL) behavior regardless of the substituent attached to the second C c , demonstrating its small influence on emission properties. Additionally, m-carborane derivatives are significantly more fluorescent than their o-counterparts, reaching quantum yield values as high as 30.2%. Regarding solid state emission, only stilbene-containing Ph-o-carborane derivatives, which showed very low fluorescence in solution, exhibited notable PL emission in films attributed to aggregation-induced emission. DFT calculations were performed to successfully complement the photoluminescence studies, supporting the experimentally observed photophysical behavior of the styrene and\n\nDesign of Carborane Molecular Architectures via Electronic Structure Computations\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nOliva, J.M.; Serrano-Andres, L.; Klein, D.J.; Schleyer, P.V.R.; Mich, J.\n\n2009-01-01\n\nQuantum-mechanical electronic structure computations were employed to explore initial steps towards a comprehensive design of poly carborane architectures through assembly of molecular units. Aspects considered were (i) the striking modification of geometrical parameters through substitution, (ii) endohedral carboranes and proposed ejection mechanisms for energy/ion/atom/energy storage/transport, (iii) the excited state character in single and dimeric molecular units, and (iv) higher architectural constructs. A goal of this work is to find optimal architectures where atom/ion/energy/spin transport within carborane superclusters is feasible in order to modernize and improve future photo energy processes.\n\nEnhancement of Aggregation-Induced Emission by Introducing Multiple o-Carborane Substitutions into Triphenylamine\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nKenta Nishino\n\n2017-11-01\n\nFull Text Available The enhancement of aggregation-induced emission (AIE is presented on the basis of the strategy for improving solid-state luminescence by employing multiple o-carborane substituents. We synthesized the modified triphenylamines with various numbers of o-carborane units and compared their optical properties. From the optical measurements, the emission bands from the twisted intramolecular charge transfer (TICT state were obtained from the modified triphenylamines. It was notable that emission efficiencies of the multi-substituted triphenylamines including two or three o-carborane units were enhanced 6- to 8-fold compared to those of the mono-substituted triphenylamine. According to mechanistic studies, it was proposed that the single o-carborane substitution can load the AIE property via the TICT mechanism. It was revealed that the additional o-carborane units contribute to improving solid-state emission by suppressing aggregation-caused quenching (ACQ. Subsequently, intense AIEs were obtained. This paper presents a new role of the o-carborane substituent in the enhancement of AIEs.\n\nResearch advancements and applications of carboranes in nuclear medicinal chemistry\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nChen Wen; Wei Hongyuan; Luo Shunzhong\n\n2011-01-01\n\nBecause of their uniquely high thermal and chemical stabilities, carboranes have become a subject of study with high interest in the chemistry of supra molecules, catalysts and radiopharmaceuticals. In recent years, the role of carboranes in nuclear medicinal chemistry has been diversified, from the traditional use in boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT), to the clinical applications in molecular radio imaging and therapy. This paper provides an overview of the synthesis and characterization of carboranes and their applications in nuclear medicinal chemistry, with highlights of recent key advancements in the re- search areas of BNCT and radio imaging.

Thiophene donor units and m-carborane acceptor unit were combined under the same umbrella via donorâacceptorâdonor approach to obtain di(2-thiophenyl)carborane (1). Contrary to the literature, extreme conditions like highly dried solvent or inert atmosphere were not used for polymerization and characterization. Polymer P1 has an ambipolar character since it exhibited a reversible oxidation peak at a half wave potential (E 1/2 ) of 1.08 V and a quasi reversible reduction peak at E 1/2 = â1.82 V vs. Ag/AgCl. The polymer film has an optical band gap of 1.95 eV with a maximum absorption band centered at 488 nm. Also, it exhibited multicolor electrochromic behavior between its reduced and oxidized states changing from dark orange to light blue. Furthermore, the electrochromic device prepared based on P1 film was stable and robust. - Highlights: â¢ Electrochromic properties of a carborane based conjugated polymer were reported. â¢ The polymer exhibited an ambipolar character and multicolor behaviors. â¢ It is the first electrochromic device based on a carborane unit\n\nInvestigation of gamma-ray induced polymer formation of the carboranes.

Enthalpies and melting points of crystals, as well as temperatures of liquid compounds decomposition start are determined by the method of differential scanning calorimetry. Comparison of evaporation enthalpies determined in the study confirms the conclusions on non-additive character of intermolecular interaction in carboranes and their derivatives, which have been made previously [ru\n\nIon Transport across Biological Membranes by Carborane-Capped Gold Nanoparticles.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nGrzelczak, Marcin P; Danks, Stephen P; Klipp, Robert C; Belic, Domagoj; Zaulet, Adnana; Kunstmann-Olsen, Casper; Bradley, Dan F; Tsukuda, Tatsuya; ViÃ±as, Clara; Teixidor, Francesc; Abramson, Jonathan J; Brust, Mathias\n\n2017-12-26\n\nCarborane-capped gold nanoparticles (Au/carborane NPs, 2-3 nm) can act as artificial ion transporters across biological membranes. The particles themselves are large hydrophobic anions that have the ability to disperse in aqueous media and to partition over both sides of a phospholipid bilayer membrane. Their presence therefore causes a membrane potential that is determined by the relative concentrations of particles on each side of the membrane according to the Nernst equation. The particles tend to adsorb to both sides of the membrane and can flip across if changes in membrane potential require their repartitioning. Such changes can be made either with a potentiostat in an electrochemical cell or by competition with another partitioning ion, for example, potassium in the presence of its specific transporter valinomycin. Carborane-capped gold nanoparticles have a ligand shell full of voids, which stem from the packing of near spherical ligands on a near spherical metal core. These voids are normally filled with sodium or potassium ions, and the charge is overcompensated by excess electrons in the metal core. The anionic particles are therefore able to take up and release a certain payload of cations and to adjust their net charge accordingly. It is demonstrated by potential-dependent fluorescence spectroscopy that polarized phospholipid membranes of vesicles can be depolarized by ion transport mediated by the particles. It is also shown that the particles act as alkali-ion-specific transporters across free-standing membranes under potentiostatic control. Magnesium ions are not transported.\n\nBA321, a novel carborane analog that binds to androgen and estrogen receptors, acts as a new selective androgen receptor modulator of bone in male mice\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nWatanabe, Kenta; Hirata, Michiko; Tominari, Tsukasa; Matsumoto, Chiho; Endo, Yasuyuki; Murphy, Gillian; Nagase, Hideaki\n\n2016-01-01\n\nCarboranes are a class of carbon-containing polyhedral boron cluster compounds with globular geometry and hydrophobic surface that interact with hormone receptors such as estrogen receptor (ER) and androgen receptor (AR).

Taking into account the scope of application of organoboron compounds in various branches of human economic activity, we present for publication the quantitative data of a toxicological study of the higher isomer of carboranes of isopropyl meta-carborane at the level of a single injection into the laboratory animals through the mouth and lungs. Background. Supplementing data on toxicity and the hazard of organoboron compounds requires the study of the response of the organism to the action of isopropyl meta-carborane. The purpose of the study: identification of possible features and specificity of the toxic effect of carboranes on the example of isopropyl meta-carborane. Methods. The object of the study is nonlinear laboratory animals: rats, mice and rabbits contained in standard vivarium conditions, with observance of the rules of humane treatment of animals. Traditional methods of research (physiological, hematological, morphological have been used. Statistical processing of data was carried out using the programs Â«Microsoft Office Excel 2007Â» and Â«BiostatÂ».

Acute toxicity parameters were obtained, which allowed the substance to be classified as moderately hazardous (3rd hazard class according to GOST 12.1.007, which does not have selective irritant, pneumotoxic and fibrogenic effects. Conclusion. Thus, the predominant influence of the substance is established objectively with a single exposure to the blood system as its toxicological feature, and its effect on spermatozoa is a specificity of the action, which stimulates the study of this carborane under conditions of chronic administration to the animals.\n\nPhotoluminescence in Carborane-Stilbene Triads: A Structural, Spectroscopic, and Computational Study.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nCabrera-GonzÃ¡lez, Justo; ViÃ±as, Clara; Haukka, Matti; Bhattacharyya, Santanu; Gierschner, Johannes; NÃºÃ±ez, Rosario\n\n2016-09-12\n\nA set of triads in which o- and m-carborane clusters are bonded to two stilbene units through Ccluster -CH2 bonds was synthesized, and their structures were confirmed by X-ray diffraction. A study on the influence of the o- and m- isomers on the absorption and photoluminescence properties of the stilbene units in solution revealed no charge-transfer contributions in the lowest excited state, as confirmed by (TD)DFT calculations. The presence of one or two B-I groups in m-carborane derivatives does not affect the emission properties of the stilbenes in solution, probably due to the rather large distance between the iodo substituents and the fluorophore. Nevertheless, a significant redshift of the photoluminescence (PL) emission maximum in the solid state (thin films and powder samples) compared to solution was observed; this can be traced back to PL sensitization, most probably due to more densely packed stilbene moieties. Remarkably, the PL absolute quantum yields of powder samples are significantly higher than those in solution, and this was attributed to the restricted environment and the aforementioned sensitization. Thus, the bonding of the carborane clusters to two stilbene units preserves their PL behavior in solution, but produces significant changes in the solid state. Furthermore, iodinated species can be considered to be promising precursors for theranostic agents in which both imaging and therapeutic functions could possibly be combined.

In two structures, the calculated main bond lengths and bond angels of structural framework are consistent with X-ray experiment, and the two BODIPYs complexes are thermodynamically and kinetically stable. The strongest DOS band is mainly dominated by the Bsbnd B and Bsbnd H Ï-bonds of carborane fragment, whereas the Ï-type MOs on the pyrromethene fragment contribute to the high-energy DOS bands. Analysis of the AdNDP chemical bonding indicates that the carborane cage can be stabilized by eleven delocalized 3csbnd 2e and two delocalized 4csbnd 2e Ï-bonds, while the pyrromethene fragment corresponds to five delocalized 3csbnd 2e Ï-bonds. In addition, the main characteristic peaks of the two simulated IR spectra for the BODIPYs complexes are properly assigned. Hopefully, all these results will be helpful for understanding the electronic structures, and further stimulate the study on the biological and medical applications.\n\nAlkynyl substituted carboranes as precursors to boron carbide thin films, fibers and composites\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nJohnson, S.E.; Yang, X.; Hawthorne, M.F.; Mackenzie, J.D.; Thorne, K.J.; Zheng, H.\n\n1992-01-01\n\nIn this paper the use of alkynyl substituted derivatives of o-carborane as precursors to boron containing ceramics is described.

The evaluation of the Gd-carborane complex 2 as a MR imaging and boron carrier agent was carried out in vivo by means of MRI, ICP-AES, and Î±-autoradiography. The MR imaging revealed that the carborane Gd-DTPA 2 was metabolized slower in the body in comparison with Gd-DTPA 1. The results of ICP-AES method indicated that compound 2 was incorporated into normal tissues and metabolized quickly, whereas it was not accumulated into tumor and brain tissue.

It was observed that the CC structure completely determines luminescence type displayed by the three-component complex. Adding adamantane to the solution leads to the disappearance of the spontaneous excimer fluorescence observed usually along with a monomer fluorescence of naphthalene and the appearance of the long lived phosphorescence at room temperature. At the same time, introducing o-carborane in solution of {beta}-CD inclusion complexes with naphthalene results in the dramatic growth of intensity of the excimer band at the expense of lowering intensity of monomer fluorescence. These phenomena were explained using results of the quantum-chemical calculation of the structure and complexation energies at the semi-empirical PM3 and DFT levels of theory. - Highlights: > Structure of carcass compounds determines luminescence types for naphthalene - betaCD complex. > Adding o-carborane leads to the growth of excimer fluorescence at low naphthalene concentrations. > Adding adamantane leads to the room temperature phosphorescence without deoxygenation.\n\nHigh resolution tomography using analog coding\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nBrownell, G.L.; Burnham, C.A.; Chesler, D.A.\n\n1985-01-01\n\nAs part of a 30-year program in the development of positron instrumentation, the authors have developed a high resolution bismuth germanate (BGO) ring tomography (PCR) employing 360 detectors and 90 photomultiplier tubes for one plane. The detectors are shaped as trapezoid and are 4 mm wide at the front end. When assembled, they form an essentially continuous cylindrical detector. Light from a scintillation in the detector is viewed through a cylindrical light pipe by the photomultiplier tubes. By use of an analog coding scheme, the detector emitting light is identified from the phototube signals. In effect, each phototube can identify four crystals. PCR is designed as a static device and does not use interpolative motion. This results in considerable advantage when performing dynamic studies.

The goal of the current study was to determine whether AZT monotherapy in HIV-1 infected patients also selects the A371V, Q509L or other mutations in the C-terminal domains of HIV-1 RT.Full-length RT sequences in plasma obtained pre- and post-therapy were compared in 23 participants who received AZT monotherapy from the AIDS Clinical Trials Group study 175. Five of the 23 participants reached a primary study endpoint. Mutations significantly associated with AZT monotherapy included K70R (pâ=â0.003 and T215Y (pâ=â0.013 in the polymerase domain of HIV-1 RT, and A360V (pâ=â0.041 in the connection domain of HIV-1 RT. HIV-1 drug susceptibility assays demonstrated that A360V, either alone or in combination with thymidine analog mutations, decreased AZT susceptibility in recombinant viruses containing participant-derived full-length RT sequences or site-directed mutant RT. Biochemical studies revealed that A360V enhances the AZT-monophosphate excision activity of purified RT by significantly decreasing the frequency of secondary RNase H cleavage events that reduce the RNA/DNA duplex length and promote template/primer dissociation.The A360V mutation in the connection domain of RT was selected in HIV-infected individuals that received AZT monotherapy and contributed to AZT resistance.\n\nHospital 360Â°.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nGiraldo Valencia, Juan Carlos; Delgado, Liliana Claudia\n\n2015-01-01\n\nThere are forces that are greater than the individual performance of each hospital institution and of the health system structural of each country.

Video sharing sites such as YouTube now allow this unique content to be shared via virtual reality (VR) goggles, hand-held smartphones/tablets, and computers. Creating 360Â° videos from astrophysical simulations is not only a new way to view these simulations as you are immersed in them, but is also a way to create engaging content for outreach to the public. We present what we believe is the first 360Â° video of an astrophysical simulation: a hydrodynamics calculation of the central parsec of the Galactic centre. We also describe how to create such movies, and briefly comment on what new science can be extracted from astrophysical simulations using 360Â° videos.\n\n37 CFR 360.10 - General.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\n2010-07-01\n\n....10 Patents, Trademarks, and Copyrights COPYRIGHT ROYALTY BOARD, LIBRARY OF CONGRESS SUBMISSION OF ROYALTY CLAIMS FILING OF CLAIMS TO ROYALTY FEES COLLECTED UNDER COMPULSORY LICENSE Satellite Claims Â§ 360... to be entitled to compulsory license royalty fees for secondary transmissions by satellite carriers...\n\n20 CFR 405.360 - Official record.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\n2010-04-01\n\n... in making the decision under review and any additional evidence or written statements that the... 20 Employees' Benefits 2 2010-04-01 2010-04-01 false Official record. 405.360 Section 405.360 Employees' Benefits SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION ADMINISTRATIVE REVIEW PROCESS FOR ADJUDICATING INITIAL...\n\n37 CFR 360.4 - Compliance with statutory dates.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\n2010-07-01\n\n... dates. 360.4 Section 360.4 Patents, Trademarks, and Copyrights COPYRIGHT ROYALTY BOARD, LIBRARY OF CONGRESS SUBMISSION OF ROYALTY CLAIMS FILING OF CLAIMS TO ROYALTY FEES COLLECTED UNDER COMPULSORY LICENSE Cable Claims Â§ 360.4 Compliance with statutory dates.

It focuses on the fundamental principles of creating 360Âº films, not only in 3D modelling software, but also presents how to record 360Âº video using panoramic cameras inside the heritage site. These issues are explored in a case study of Charles Church in Plymouth, UK that was bombed in 1941 and has never been rebuilt. The generation of a 3D model of the bombed church started from the creation of five spherical panoramas and through the use of Autodesk ImageModeler software. The processed files were imported and merged together in Autodesk 3ds Max where a visualisation of the ruin was produced. A number of historical images were found and this collection enabled the process of a virtual reconstruction of the site. The aspect of merging two still or two video panoramas (one from 3D modelling software, the other one recorded on the site from the same locations or with the same trajectories is also discussed. The prototype of 360Âº non-linear film tells a narrative of a wartime wedding that occurred in this church. The film was presented on two 360Âº screens where members of the audience could make decisions on whether to continue the ceremony or whether to run away when the bombing of the church starts. 3D modelling software made this possible to render a number of different alternati ves (360Âº images and 360Âº video.

Bulky-substituent (alkyl)2C2B4H6 derivatives and (C6H5)2C2B4H6: synthesis and properties\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nBoyter, H.A. Jr.; Grimes, R.N.\n\n1988-01-01\n\nThe preparation and chemistry of nido-2,3-R 2 C 2 C 2 B 4 H 6 carboranes in which R is n-butyl, isopentyl, n-hexyl, and phenyl was investigated in order to further assess the steric and electronic influence of the R groups on the properties of the nido-C 2 B 4 cage, especially with respect to metal complexation at the C 2 B 3 face and metal-promoted oxidative fusion. The three dialkyl derivatives were prepared from the corresponding dialkylacetylenes via reaction with B 5 H 9 and triethylamine, but the diphenyl compound could not be prepared in this manner and was obtained instead in a thermal reaction of B 5 H 9 with diphenylacetylene in the absence of amine. All four carboranes are readily bridge-deprotonated by NaH in THF, and the anions of the dialkyl species, on treatment with FeCl 2 and air oxidation, generate the respective R 4 C 4 B 8 H 8 carborane fusion products were R = n-C 4 H 9 , i-C 5 H 11 or n-C 6 H 13 . The diphenylcarborane anion Ph 2 C 2 B 4 H 5 - did not form detectable metal complexes with Fe 2+ , Co 2+ , or Ni 2+ , and no evidence of a Ph 4 C 4 B 8 H 8 fusion product has been found. Treatment of Ph 2 C 2 B 4 H 6 with Cr(CO) 6 did not lead to metal coordination of the phenyl rings, unlike (PhCH 2 ) 2 C 2 B 4 H 6 , which had previously been shown to form mono- and bis(tricarbonylchromium) complexes. However, the reaction of Ph 2 C 2 B 4 H 5 - , CoCl 2 , and (PhPCH 2 ) 2 did give 1,1-(Ph 2 PCH 2 ) 2 -1-Cl-1,2,3-Co(Ph 2 C 2 B 4 H 4 ), the only case in which metal complexation of the diphenylcarborane was observed. 14 references, 3 figures, 3 tables\n\n21 CFR 1.360 - What are the record retention requirements?\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\n2010-04-01\n\n... food, including foods preserved by freezing, dehydrating, or being placed in a hermetically sealed... 21 Food and Drugs 1 2010-04-01 2010-04-01 false What are the record retention requirements? 1.360 Section 1.360 Food and Drugs FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION, DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES GENERAL...\n\n31 CFR 360.23 - Evidence.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\n2010-07-01\n\n... than six months prior to the presentation of the bond.

By using virtual cameras within a game engine and texture mapping of these camera feeds to an arbitrary shape, we were able to offer users a 360-degree interface composed of four 90-degree views, two 180-degree views, or one 360-degree view of the same interactive environment. An example experiment is described using these interfaces. This technique for creating alternative displays of wide-angle video facilitates the exploration of how compressed or fish-eye distortions affect spatial perception of the environment and can benefit the creation of interfaces for surveillance and remote system teleoperation.\n\n31 CFR 360.48 - Restrictions on reissue; denominational exchange.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\n2010-07-01\n\n...; denominational exchange. 360.48 Section 360.48 Money and Finance: Treasury Regulations Relating to Money and...

This neutral mixed-valence Fe(II) /Fe(III) complex overcomes the proximal electronic bias imposed by external counterions, a practical limitation in the use of molecular switches. A combination of UV/Vis-NIR spectroscopic and TD-DFT computational studies indicate that electron transfer within Fc(+) FcC2 B9 (-) is achieved through a bridge-mediated mechanism. This electronic framework therefore provides the possibility of an all-neutral null state, a key requirement for the implementation of quantum-dot cellular automata (QCA) molecular computing. The adhesion, ordering, and characterization of Fc(+) FcC2 B9 (-) on Au(111) has been observed by scanning tunneling microscopy. Â© 2015 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

It provides the viewer a new sense of presence and immersion. Compared to conventional rectilinear video (2D or 3D), 360Â° video poses a new and difficult set of engineering challenges on video processing and delivery. Enabling comfortable and immersive user experience requires very high video quality and very low latency, while the large video file size poses a challenge to delivering 360Â° video in a quality manner at scale. Conventionally, 360Â° video represented in equirectangular or other projection formats can be encoded as a single standards-compliant bitstream using existing video codecs such as H.264/AVC or H.265/HEVC. Such method usually needs very high bandwidth to provide an immersive user experience. While at the client side, much of such high bandwidth and the computational power used to decode the video are wasted because the user only watches a small portion (i.e., viewport) of the entire picture. Viewport dependent 360Â°video processing and delivery approaches spend more bandwidth on the viewport than on non-viewports and are therefore able to reduce the overall transmission bandwidth. This paper proposes a dual buffer segment scheduling algorithm for viewport adaptive streaming methods to reduce latency when switching between high quality viewports in 360Â° video streaming. The approach decouples the scheduling of viewport segments and non-viewport segments to ensure the viewport segment requested matches the latest user head orientation. A base layer buffer stores all lower quality segments, and a viewport buffer stores high quality viewport segments corresponding to the most recent viewer's head orientation. The scheduling scheme determines viewport requesting time based on the buffer status and the head orientation. This paper also discusses how to deploy the proposed scheduling design for various viewport adaptive video\n\nAnalogical scaffolding: Making meaning in physics through representation and analogy\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nPodolefsky, Noah Solomon\n\nThis work reviews the literature on analogy, introduces a new model of analogy, and presents a series of experiments that test and confirm the utility of this model to describe and predict student learning in physics with analogy. Pilot studies demonstrate that representations (e.g., diagrams) can play a key role in students' use of analogy. A new model of analogy, Analogical Scaffolding, is developed to explain these initial empirical results. This model will be described in detail, and then applied to describe and predict the outcomes of further experiments. Two large-scale (N>100) studies will demonstrate that: (1) students taught with analogies, according to the Analogical Scaffolding model, outperform students taught without analogies on pre-post assessments focused on electromagnetic waves; (2) the representational forms used to teach with analogy can play a significant role in student learning, with students in one treatment group outperforming students in other treatment groups by factors of two or three. It will be demonstrated that Analogical Scaffolding can be used to predict these results, as well as finer-grained results such as the types of distracters students choose in different treatment groups, and to describe and analyze student reasoning in interviews. Abstraction in physics is reconsidered using Analogical Scaffolding. An operational definition of abstraction is developed within the Analogical Scaffolding framework and employed to explain (a) why physicists consider some ideas more abstract than others in physics, and (b) how students conceptions of these ideas can be modeled. This new approach to abstraction suggests novel approaches to curriculum design in physics using Analogical Scaffolding.\n\nImproving School Improvement: Development and Validation of the CSIS-360, a 360-Degree Feedback Assessment for School Improvement Specialists\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nMcDougall, Christie M.\n\n2013-01-01\n\nThe purpose of the mixed methods study was to develop and validate the CSIS-360, a 360-degree feedback assessment to measure competencies of school improvement specialists from multiple perspectives. The study consisted of eight practicing school improvement specialists from a variety of settings. The specialists nominated 23 constituents toâ¦\n\nC,C'-bis(benzodiazaborolyl)dicarba-closo-dodecaboranes: synthesis, structures, photophysics and electrochemistry.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nWeber, Lothar; Kahlert, Jan; Brockhinke, Regina; BÃ¶hling, Lena; Halama, Johannes; Brockhinke, Andreas; Stammler, Hans-Georg; Neumann, Beate; Nervi, Carlo; Harder, Rachel A; Fox, Mark A\n\n2013-08-14\n\nSix new C,C'-bis(benzodiazaborolyl)dicarba-closo-dodecaboranes, 1,A-R2-1,A-C2B10H10, where R represents the group 2-(1,3-Et2-1,3,2-N2BC6H4) or 2-(1,3-Ph2-1,3,2-N2BC6H4) and A is 2, 7 or 12, were synthesized from o-, m-, and p-dicarbadodecaboranes (carboranes) by lithiation and subsequent treatment with the respective 2-bromo-1,3,2-benzodiazaboroles. UV-visible and fluorescence spectra of all carboranes display low energy charge transfer emissions. While such emissions with Stokes shifts between 17,330 and 21,290 cm(-1) are typical for C,C'-bis(aryl)-ortho-carboranes, the observed low-energy emissions with Stokes shifts between 8320 and 15,170 cm(-1) for the meta- and para-isomers are unusual as high-energy emissions are typical for meta- and para-dicarbadodecaboranes. Fluorescence quantum yields (ÏF) for the novel 1,7- and 1,12-bis(benzodiazaborolyl)-carboranes depend on the substituents at the nitrogen atoms of the heterocycle. Thus, the para-carborane with N-ethyl substituents 1,12-(1',3'-Et2-1',3',2'-N2BC6H4)2-1,12-C2B10H10 has a ÏF value of 41% in cyclohexane solution and only of 9% in the solid state, whereas the analogous 1,12-(1',3'-Ph2-1',3',2'-N2BC6H4)2-1,12-C2B10H10 shows quantum yields of 3% in cyclohexane solution and 72% in the solid state. X-ray crystallographic, computational and cyclic voltammetry studies for these carboranes are also presented.\n\nCan we Use Low-Cost 360 Degree Cameras to Create Accurate 3d Models?\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nBarazzetti, L.; Previtali, M.; Roncoroni, F.\n\n2018-05-01\n\n360 degree cameras capture the whole scene around a photographer in a single shot. Cheap 360 cameras are a new paradigm in photogrammetry. The camera can be pointed to any direction, and the large field of view reduces the number of photographs. This paper aims to show that accurate metric reconstructions can be achieved with affordable sensors (less than 300 euro). The camera used in this work is the Xiaomi Mijia Mi Sphere 360, which has a cost of about 300 USD (January 2018). Experiments demonstrate that millimeter-level accuracy can be obtained during the image orientation and surface reconstruction steps, in which the solution from 360Â° images was compared to check points measured with a total station and laser scanning point clouds. The paper will summarize some practical rules for image acquisition as well as the importance of ground control points to remove possible deformations of the network during bundle adjustment, especially for long sequences with unfavorable geometry. The generation of orthophotos from images having a 360Â° field of view (that captures the entire scene around the camera) is discussed. Finally, the paper illustrates some case studies where the use of a 360Â° camera could be a better choice than a project based on central perspective cameras. Basically, 360Â° cameras become very useful in the survey of long and narrow spaces, as well as interior areas like small rooms.\n\n37 CFR 360.23 - Content of notices regarding independent administrators.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\n2010-07-01\n\n... independent administrators. 360.23 Section 360.23 Patents, Trademarks, and Copyrights COPYRIGHT ROYALTY BOARD, LIBRARY OF CONGRESS SUBMISSION OF ROYALTY CLAIMS FILING OF CLAIMS TO ROYALTY FEES COLLECTED UNDER COMPULSORY LICENSE Digital Audio Recording Devices and Media Royalty Claims Â§ 360.23 Content of notices...\n\n20 CFR 416.360 - Cancellation of a request to withdraw.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\n2010-04-01\n\n....360 Section 416.360 Employees' Benefits SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION SUPPLEMENTAL SECURITY INCOME FOR THE AGED, BLIND, AND DISABLED Filing of Applications Withdrawal of Application Â§ 416.360... received after we have approved the withdrawal, the cancellation request is filed no later than 60 days...\n\nDetecting analogical resemblance without retrieving the source analogy.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nKostic, Bogdan; Cleary, Anne M; Severin, Kaye; Miller, Samuel W\n\n2010-06-01\n\nWe examined whether people can detect analogical resemblance to an earlier experimental episode without being able to recall the experimental source of the analogical resemblance. We used four-word analogies (e.g., robin-nest/beaver-dam), in a variation of the recognition-without-cued-recall method (Cleary, 2004). Participants studied word pairs (e.g., robin-nest) and were shown new word pairs at test, half of which analogically related to studied word pairs (e.g., beaver-dam) and half of which did not. For each test pair, participants first attempted to recall an analogically similar pair from the study list. Then, regardless of whether successful recall occurred, participants were prompted to rate the familiarity of the test pair, which was said to indicate the likelihood that a pair that was analogically similar to the test pair had been studied. Across three experiments, participants demonstrated an ability to detect analogical resemblance without recalling the source analogy. Findings are discussed in terms of their potential relevance to the study of analogical reasoning and insight, as well as to the study of familiarity and recognition memory.\n\n42 CFR 495.360 - Software and ownership rights.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\n2010-10-01\n\n... 42 Public Health 5 2010-10-01 2010-10-01 false Software and ownership rights. 495.360 Section 495.360 Public Health CENTERS FOR MEDICARE & MEDICAID SERVICES, DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES (CONTINUED) STANDARDS AND CERTIFICATION STANDARDS FOR THE ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD TECHNOLOGY INCENTIVE...\n\n12 CFR Appendix C to Part 360 - Deposit File Structure\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\n2010-01-01\n\n.... â¢ STATE = State government. â¢ COMM = Commercial. â¢ CORP = Corporate. â¢ BANK = Bank Owned. â¢ DUE TO = Other... 12 Banks and Banking 4 2010-01-01 2010-01-01 false Deposit File Structure C Appendix C to Part 360...

The Physicians Universal Leadership-Teamwork Skills Education (PULSE) 360 is one such survey tool that is used to assess work colleagues' and coworkers' perceptions of a physician's leadership, teamwork, and clinical practice style. The Clinician & Group-Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and System (CG-CAHPS), developed by the US Department of Health and Human Services to serve as the benchmark for quality health care, is a survey tool for patients to provide feedback that is based on their recent experiences with staff and clinicians and soon will be tied to Medicare-based compensation of participating physicians. Prior research has indicated that patients and coworkers often agree in their assessment of physicians' behavioral patterns. The goal of the current study was to determine whether 360-degree, also called multisource, feedback provided by coworkers could predict patient satisfaction/experience ratings. A significant relationship between these two forms of feedback could enable physicians to take a more proactive approach to reinforce their strengths and identify any improvement opportunities in their patient interactions by reviewing feedback from team members. An automated 360-degree software process may be a faster, simpler, and less resource-intensive approach than telephoning and interviewing patients for survey responses, and it potentially could facilitate a more rapid credentialing or quality improvement process leading to greater fiscal and professional development gains for physicians. Our primary research question was to determine if PULSE 360 coworkers' ratings correlate with CG-CAHPS patients' ratings of overall satisfaction, recommendation of the physician, surgeon respect, and clarity of the surgeon's explanation. Our secondary research questions were to determine whether CG-CAHPS scores\n\nD Modelling with the Samsung Gear 360\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nBarazzetti, L.; Previtali, M.; Roncoroni, F.\n\n2017-02-01\n\nThe Samsung Gear 360 is a consumer grade spherical camera able to capture photos and videos. The aim of this work is to test the metric accuracy and the level of detail achievable with the Samsung Gear 360 coupled with digital modelling techniques based on photogrammetry/computer vision algorithms. Results demonstrate that the direct use of the projection generated inside the mobile phone or with Gear 360 Action Direction (the desktop software for post-processing) have a relatively low metric accuracy. As results were in contrast with the accuracy achieved by using the original fisheye images (front and rear facing images) in photogrammetric reconstructions, an alternative solution to generate the equirectangular projections was developed. A calibration aimed at understanding the intrinsic parameters of the two lenses camera, as well as their relative orientation, allowed one to generate new equirectangular projections from which a significant improvement of geometric accuracy has been achieved.\n\nHacking 360 Link: A hybrid approach\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nJohn Durno\n\n2012-10-01\n\nFull Text Available When the University of Victoria Libraries switched from a locally-hosted link resolver (SFX to a vendor-hosted link resolver (360Link, new strategies were required to effectively integrate the vendor-hosted link resolver with the Libraries' other systems and services. Custom javascript is used to add links to the 360Link page; these links then point at local PHP code running on UVic servers, which can then redirect to appropriate local service or display a form directly. An open source PHP OpenURL parser class is announced. Consideration is given to the importance of maintaining open protocols and standards in the transition to vendor-hosted services.\n\nCOPD360social Online Community: A Social Media Review.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nStellefson, Michael; Paige, Samantha R; Alber, Julia M; Stewart, Margaret\n\n2018-06-01\n\nPeople living with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) commonly report feelings of loneliness and social isolation due to lack of support from family, friends, and health care providers.
