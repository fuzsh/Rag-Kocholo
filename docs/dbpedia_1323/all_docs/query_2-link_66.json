        "text": "NEW YORK (AP) - Ken Martin felt calm before Sunday's New\n\nYork City Marathon, and that was good. Kim Jones was too\n\nnervous to sleep, that was good, too.\n\nThe two Americans were each impressive second-place finishers\n\nSunday. Martin, a two-time winner of the Pittsburgh Marathon,\n\ntrailed Juna Ikangaa of Tanzania, while Jones placed runner-up\n\nto Norway's Ingrid Kristiansen just four weeks after winning\n\nthe Twin Cities Marathon.\n\n\"When your anxiety's high, your economy is terrible,\"\n\nexplained Martin, a former steeplechaser at Oregon whose\n\ntime of 2 hours, 9 minutes and 38 seconds was 1:37 behind\n\nIkangaa.\n\n\"You got to be real loose, then you're at your premium.\n\nI thought, `Alright, I'm just going to hang out, laugh and\n\nnot worry about it.\"'\n\nWhile Martin went out Saturday night and enjoyed dinner\n\nwith friends, Jones stayed in with her husband, nibbled\n\non noodles and bread and avoided discussing the race.\n\n\"I tried to sleep last night but I couldn't, which was\n\na good sign for me,\" said Jones, a resident of Spokane,\n\nWash., whose time of 2:27:54 was the seventh-fastest performance\n\never by an American woman and the best by a U.S. runner\n\nsince Joan Benoit Samuelson's American record of 2:21:21\n\nin 1985.\n\n\"It means I'm restless and anxious to get started. I just\n\nate lightly and tried to stay away from people who would\n\nsay, `Are you crazy to run four weeks after the last marathon?\"'\n\nOn the course, however, their styles reversed. Martin seemed\n\nto burn off energy quicker, tiring towards the end, breathing\n\nheavily and looking up and down. He said that he had wanted\n\nto run with defending champion Steve Jones of Britain, who\n\nfinished a disappointing eighth.\n\n\"I had hoped that Steve and I were going to work together\n\nand catch Ikangaa,\" Martin said. \"I was a little surprised\n\nwhen Steve dropped out. I don't like to run alone so those\n\nlast 10 miles were kind of tough.\"\n\nKim Jones never threatened to catch Kristiansen, but maintained\n\na smooth pace throughout as she glided ahead of the other\n\nrunners.\n\n\"I went out very easily,\" she explained. \"My first mile\n\nwas six minutes. I kind of conserved my energy, just ran\n\nvery steady. I just passed people every other mile or so\n\nand I felt very strong at the finish.\"\n\nThe two Americans were reluctant to compare themselves to\n\nother U.S. runners. Jones said winning, period, was more\n\nimportant than being the best in her country.\n\n\"My goal is to be a factor in the race, not just to be\n\nthe first American finisher. As long as we put that in our\n\nminds and compete on that level, we are going to have faster\n\ntimes.\n\n\"If we continue to try to be the top Americans, our progess\n\nwill be slower.\"\n\nOnly one incident threatened to unsettle the easygoing Martin.\n\nHe said he was offended at being offered so little money\n\nto make a couple of personal appearances during the week\n\nand had to put that out of his mind as he prepared for the\n\nrace.\n\n\"There's no use getting all uptight about it,\" Martin\n\nsaid. \"You just get out and do it.\n\n\"I think I timed this race right down to the day. The last\n\ntwo weeks I've had a little tendinitis of the knee. Each\n\nday I felt a little bit better and finally this morning,\n\nwhen I warmed up, my first step it didn't hurt at all.\"\n\nOverall\n\n1, Juma Ikangaa, Tanzania, 2 hours, 8 minutes, 1 second.2,\n\nKen Martin, Santa Fe, N.M., 2:09:38.3, Gelindo Bordin, Italy,\n\n2:09:40.4, Salvatore Bettiol, Italy, 2:10:08.5, Jesus Herrara,\n\nMexico, 2:11:15.6, Nivaldo Filho, Brazil, 2:12:23.7, Osmiro\n\nSilva, Brazil, 2:12:50.8, Steve Jones, Britain, 2:12:58.\n\n9, Belayneh Densimo, Ethiopia, 2:13:42.\n\n10, Pat Petersen, Bay Shore, N.Y., 2:14:02.11, Gianni Truchi,\n\nItaly, 2:14:16.12, Rustom Shagiev, Soviet Union, 2:14:39.13,\n\nArt Boileau, Canada, 2:14:48.14, Gianni Poli, Italy, 2:15:47.15,\n\nJohn Campbell, New Zealand, 2:16:15.16, Ernest Tjeia, Lesotho,\n\n2:16:19.17, Eugeny Okorokov, Soviet Union, 2:16:25.18, Kenichi\n\nTsurusaki, Japan, 2:16:35.19, Karel David, Czechoslovakia,\n\n2:17:00.\n\n20, Michel Constant, France, 2:17:03.21, Ryszard Marczak,\n\nPoland, 2:18:18.\n\n22, Bill Foster, Britain, 2:19:06.23, Ricardo Cuellar, Mexico,\n\n2:20:12.24, Lars Ericsson, Sweden, 2:20:27.25, Ulf Olsson,\n\nSweden, 2:20:38.\n\nWomen\n\n1, Ingrid Kristiansen, Norway, 2:25:30.2, Kim Jones, Spokane,\n\nWash., 2:27:54.3, Laura Fogli, Italy, 2:28:43.4, Kumi Araki,\n\nJapan, 2:30:00.5, Dorothe Rasmussen, Denmark, 2:32:18.6,\n\nZoya Ivanova, Soviet Union, 2:32:21.7, Emma Scaunich, Italy,\n\n2:32:25.8, Gordon Bloch, New York, 2:33:01.9, Ritva Lemettinen,\n\nFinland, 2:34:00.\n\n10, Alena Peterkova, Czechoslovakia, 2:34:22.11, Ayumi Ishikura,\n\nJapan, 2:35:29.12, Priscilla Welch, Britain, 2:36:15.13,\n\nMargaret Groos, Nashville, Tenn., 2:37:33.14, Lisa Vaill,\n\nPine Plains, N.Y., 2:38:27.15, Ellen Rochefort, Canada,\n\n2:39:29.16, Gillian P Horovitz, Britain, 2:39:34.17, Raisa\n\nSmekhnova, Soviet Union, 2:39:39.18, Alessandra Olivari,\n\nItaly, 2:41:57.19, Agnes Sipka, Hungary, 2:42:04.\n\n20, Czeslawa Mentlewicz, Poland, 2:42:19.21, Angella Hearn,\n\nNew York, 2:43:48.22, Maarta Visnyei, Hungary, 2:45:39.23,\n\nBea Huste, Brooklyn, N.Y., 2:45:57.24, Tuija Toivonen, Finland,\n\n2:46:40.25, Emperatriz Wilson-Traba, Cuba, 2:47:32.\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\n* I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy."
