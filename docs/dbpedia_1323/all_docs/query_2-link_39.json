        "text": "BOSTON (AP) - A controversy over the validity of\n\nthe Boston Marathon course for record purposes appears to\n\nhave overshadowed the outstanding men's and women's fields\n\nfor Monday's race.\n\nTechnically, there are no world records for marathons, merely\n\nworld bests, because courses throughout the world are not\n\nstandardized.\n\nBut if any runner Monday goes under the men's world best\n\nof 2 hours, 6 minutes, 50 seconds set by Belayneh Densimo\n\nof Ethiopia at Rotterdam in 1988, or under the women's world\n\nbest of 2:21:06 by Ingrid Kristiansen of Norway at London\n\nin 1985, it will not be recognized by the governing body\n\nof the sport in the United States.\n\nThe reason? The Athletics Congress has passed legislation\n\nthat eliminated point-to-point records for road-race courses.\n\nUnder the legislation, courses that go downhill more than\n\none meter per kilometer (about 42 meters for a marathon)\n\nor those in which the start and finish are farther apart\n\nthan 30 percent of the race distance (about eight miles)\n\ndo not count for record-keeping purposes. The Boston course\n\nfalls into both those categories.\n\nThe 26-mile, 385-yard point-to-point Boston course, from\n\nsuburban Hopkinton, Mass., to downtown Boston, drops approximately\n\n150 meters.\n\nGuy Morse, race director of the Boston Marathon, called\n\nthe new rule \"overly stringent\" and said it \"should be\n\nrepealed.\"\n\nTAC officials cite the need for conformity in records, and\n\nemphasize they do not want to eliminate Boston marks from\n\nthe record books nor in any way discredit the 94-year-old\n\nBoston Marathon.\n\nThe issue will come up for review in November at the TAC\n\nconvention in Seattle.\n\nThere are several runners in Monday's field who appear capable\n\nof running under the world bests of Densimo and Kristiansen.\n\nThe men's lineup includes Tanzania's Juma Ikangaa, the world's\n\ntop-ranked marathoner in 1989, the runner-up in each of\n\nthe past two Boston marathons and last year's New York City\n\nMarathon winner; Kenya's Ibrahim Hussein, the 1987 New York\n\nCity winner and 1988 Boston champion; Australia's Rob de\n\nCastella, the 1986 Boston winner in a course-record 2:07:51;\n\nWales' Steve Jones, former holder of the world best and\n\nthe 1988 New York City champion, and Italy's Gelindo Bordin,\n\nthe 1988 Olympic gold medalist.\n\nAlso, Ethiopia's Zeleke Metafaria, the 1989 World Cup champion;\n\nTanzania's Simon Robert Naali, the 1989 Honolulu Marathon\n\nchampion; Mexico's Alejandro Cruz, the 1988 Chicago Marathon\n\nwinner, and former Boston winners Geoff Smith of Britain\n\n(1984-85) and Greg Meyer of Grand Rapids, Mich. (1983).\n\nLeading the women's field are Portugal's Rosa Mota, the\n\n1988 Olympic gold medalist and 1987 and 1988 Boston winner;\n\nBritain's Veronique Marot, the world's No. 2-ranked marathoner\n\nand winner of the 1989 London Marathon; Spokane, Wash.,\n\nresident Kim Jones, ranked third in the world and winner\n\nof last year's Twin Cities Marathon; the Soviet Union's\n\nZoya Ivanova, the 1989 Los Angeles Marathon champion, and\n\nItaly's Laura Fogli, two-time runner-up in the New York\n\nCity Marathon.\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\n* I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy."
