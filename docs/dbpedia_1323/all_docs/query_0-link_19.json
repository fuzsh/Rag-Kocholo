Most likely, some changes will be difficult to recognize and people will feel that this has always been the case. Changes occur for other reasons, and it will be difficult to establish causal relationships between phenomena. But this is the inevitable goal of science – to analyze conditions, identify trends, justify decisions. At the site of the first section, a discussion of the characteristics of the atypical situation that has arisen, the associated risks and possible future scenarios will be organized.\n\nTrack 1: “Society and the New Normal”\n\n12.15 -13.30\n\nModerators:\n\nViktor Timchenko, PhD in Pedagogy, Associate Professor of the Department of Education Management and Personnel Management of the Institute of Economics and Management of the Herzen State Pedagogical University of Russia\n\nZharova Marina Vladislavovna, PhD in Physical and Mathematical Sciences, Associate Professor of the Department of Education Management and Personnel Management of the Institute of Economics and Management of the Herzen State Pedagogical University of Russia\n\nNo. Speaker details Title of the report 1 Viktor Timchenko, PhD, Associate Professor of the Department of Education Management and Personnel Management of the Institute of Economics and Management of the Herzen State Pedagogical University of Russia (St. Petersburg) Education risks in the new normal 2 Kuznetsova Natalia Petrovna, Doctor of Economics, Professor of the Department of Risk Management and Insurance, St. Petersburg State University (St. Petersburg)\n\nPisarenko Zhanna Viktorovna, Doctor of Economic Sciences, Associate Professor, Department of Risk Management and Insurance, St. Petersburg State University (St. Petersburg)\n\nNguyen toan Canh, Dr. of Economics, professor Vietnamese Academy of Social Science\n\nNguyen Can Toan, Doctor of Economics, Professor,\n\nVietnam Academy of Social Sciences (Vietnam, Hanoi)\n\nSustainable Development Values ​​and Modifying the Meanings of the Welfare State 3 James M.

The opinion that new information technologies will inevitably lead to global changes in social relations has become almost consensus. At the moment, we are beginning to realize the onset of the next stage of digital transformation. This stage is characterized by a decline in euphoria regarding bonuses and benefits brought by new technologies, and an increase in fears regarding potential threats. Threats associated with the segmentation of society in terms of access to information resources are clearly visible. At the moment, the scenarios of the impact of new information capabilities on the functioning of traditional political institutions are very vague. In particular, on the mechanisms of public choice.\n\nWhat models and methods can we be guided by when trying to predict trajectories and scenarios of development? How to assess the realism or, on the contrary, the unrealism of these scenarios?\n\nWe invite everyone who is concerned about the development of information technologies, instrumental models and methods in the context of the “new normality” to take part in this section.\n\nModerator:\n\nKonyukhovsky Pavel Vladimirovich, Doctor of Economics, Professor of the Department of Sectoral Economics and Finance of the Institute of Economics and Management of the Herzen State Pedagogical University of Russia\n\nTrack 1: 12.30 – 14.00 No. Speaker details Title of the report 1 Konyukhovsky Pavel Vladimirovich, Doctor of Economics, Professor of the Department of Sectoral Economics and Finance, Institute of Economics and Management, Herzen State Pedagogical University of Russia,\n\nAlipov Alexey Sergeevich, PhD in Economics, Associate Professor of the Department of Economic Cybernetics, Faculty of Economics, St. Petersburg State University (St. Petersburg)\n\nProblems of development and improvement of assessment systems in the context of digital transformation of the educational sphere 2 Polyanskaya Svetlana Vladimirovna, PhD in Technical Sciences, Associate Professor of the Department of Business Informatics, North-West Institute of Management, RANEPA,\n\nUlzetueva Darima Damdinovna, PhD in Technical Sciences, Associate Professor, Department of Business Informatics, North-West Institute of Management, RANEPA, (St. Petersburg)\n\nSimulation of situations at automobile checkpoints based on real data 3 Sharac M.
