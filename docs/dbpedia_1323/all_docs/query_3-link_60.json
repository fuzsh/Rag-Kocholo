In all of these diseases the CAG repeats are thought to be translated into polyglutamine tracts. There is accumulating evidence arguing for CAG trinucleotide expansions as one of the causative disease mutations in schizophrenia and bipolar affective disorder. We and others believe that the TATA-binding protein (TBP) is an important candidate to investigate in these diseases as it contains a highly polymorphic stretch of glutamine codons, which are close tomoreÂ Â» the threshold length where the polyglutamine tracts start to be associated with disease. Thus, we examined the lengths of this polyglutamine repeat in normal unrelated East Anglians, South African Blacks, sub-Saharan Africans mainly from Nigeria, and Asian Indians. We also examined 43 bipolar affective disorder patients and 65 schizophrenic patients. The range of polyglutamine tract-lengths that we found in humans was from 26-42 codons. No patients with bipolar affective disorder and schizophrenia had abnormal expansions at this locus. 22 refs., 1 tab.Â«Â less\n\nNovel polyglutamine model uncouples proteotoxicity from aging.\n\nPubMed\n\nChristie, Nakeirah T M; Lee, Amy L; Fay, Hannah G; Gray, Amelia A; Kikis, Elise A\n\n2014-01-01\n\nPolyglutamine expansions in certain proteins are the genetic determinants for nine distinct progressive neurodegenerative disorders and resultant age-related dementia. In these cases, neurodegeneration is due to the aggregation propensity and resultant toxic properties of the polyglutamine-containing proteins. We are interested in elucidating the underlying mechanisms of toxicity of the protein ataxin-3, in which a polyglutamine expansion is the genetic determinant for Machado-Joseph Disease (MJD), also referred to as spinocerebellar ataxia 3 (SCA3). To this end, we have developed a novel model for ataxin-3 protein aggregation, by expressing a disease-related polyglutamine-containing fragment of ataxin-3 in the genetically tractable body wall muscle cells of the model system C. elegans. Here, we demonstrate that this ataxin-3 fragment aggregates in a polyQ length-dependent manner in C. elegans muscle cells and that this aggregation is associated with cellular dysfunction. However, surprisingly, this aggregation and resultant toxicity was not influenced by aging. This is in contrast to polyglutamine peptides alone whose aggregation/toxicity is highly dependent on age. Thus, the data presented here not only describe a new polyglutamine model, but also suggest that protein context likely influences the cellular interactions of the polyglutamine-containing protein and thereby modulates its toxic properties.\n\nGlial response to polyglutamine-mediated stress\n\nPubMed Central\n\nVig, Parminder J.S.; Shao, Qingmei; Lopez, Maripar E\n\n2009-01-01\n\nNeurodegenerative trinucleotide (CAG) repeat disorders are caused by the expansion of polyglutamine tracts within the disease proteins. Some of these proteins have an unknown function. How does expanded polyglutamine cause target neurons to degenerate, is not clear. Recent evidence suggests that intercellular miscommunication may contribute to polyglutamine pathogenesis in CAG repeat disorders. Polyglutamine induced degeneration of the target neuron can be mediated via glia-neuron interactions. Here we hypothesize during neurodegenerative process the failure of cell: cell interactions have more severe consequences than alterations in intracellular neuron biology. We further believe that bidirectional communication between neurons and glia are prerequisite for the normal development and function of either cell-type. Understanding intercellular signaling mechanisms such as glial trophic factors and their receptors, cell adhesion or other well-defined signaling molecules provide opportunities for developing potential therapies.

This common molecular feature of polyglutamine diseases suggests shared mechanisms in disease pathology and neurodegeneration of disease specific brain regions. In this review, we discuss the main pathogenic pathways including proteolytic processing, nuclear shuttling and aggregation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and clearance of misfolded polyglutamine proteins and point out possible targets for treatment.

Previous studies suggest that expanded polyglutamine tracts alter transcription by sequestering glutamine rich transcriptional regulatory proteins, thereby perturbing their function. We tested this hypothesis in Caenorhabditis elegans neurons expressing a human huntingtin fragment with an expanded polyglutamine tract (Htn-Q150). Loss of function alleles and RNA interference (RNAi) were used to examine contributions of C. elegans cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), CREB binding protein (CBP), and histone deacetylases (HDACs) to polyglutamine-induced neurodegeneration. Deletion of CREB (crh-1) or loss of one copy of CBP (cbp-1) enhanced polyglutamine toxicity in C. elegans neurons. Loss of function alleles and RNAi were then used to systematically reduce function of each C. elegans HDAC. Generally, knockdown of individual C. elegans HDACs enhanced Htn-Q150 toxicity, but knockdown of C. elegans hda-3 suppressed toxicity. Neuronal expression of hda-3 restored Htn-Q150 toxicity and suggested that C. elegans HDAC3 (HDA-3) acts within neurons to promote degeneration in response to Htn-Q150. Genetic epistasis experiments suggested that HDA-3 and CRH-1 (C. elegans CREB homolog) directly oppose each other in regulating transcription of genes involved in polyglutamine toxicity. hda-3 loss of function failed to suppress increased neurodegeneration in hda-1/+;Htn-Q150 animals, indicating that HDA-1 and HDA-3 have different targets with opposing effects on polyglutamine toxicity. Our results suggest that polyglutamine expansions perturb transcription of CREB/CBP targets and that specific targeting of HDACs will be useful in reducing associated neurodegeneration.\n\nProteins containing expanded polyglutamine tracts and neurodegenerative disease\n\nPubMed Central\n\nAdegbuyiro, Adewale; Sedighi, Faezeh; Pilkington, Albert W.; Groover, Sharon; Legleiter, Justin\n\n2017-01-01\n\nSeveral hereditary neurological and neuromuscular diseases are caused by an abnormal expansion of trinucleotide repeats. To date, there have been ten of these trinucleotide repeat disorders associated with an expansion of the codon CAG encoding glutamine (Q). For these polyglutamine (polyQ) diseases, there is a critical threshold length of the CAG repeat required for disease, and further expansion beyond this threshold is correlated with age of onset and symptom severity. PolyQ expansion in the translated proteins promotes their self-assembly into a variety of oligomeric and fibrillar aggregate species that accumulate into the hallmark proteinaceous inclusion bodies associated with each disease. Here, we review aggregation mechanisms of proteins with expanded polyQ-tracts, structural consequences of expanded polyQ ranging from monomers to fibrillar aggregates, the impact of protein context and post translational modifications on aggregation, and a potential role for lipids membranes in aggregation. As the pathogenic mechanisms that underlie these disorders are often classified as either a gain of toxic function or loss of normal protein function, some toxic mechanisms associated with mutant polyQ tracts will also be discussed.

A.; Garcia, Susana M.; van Haaften, Gijs; Kim, Soojin; Chavez, Alejandro; Morimoto, Richard I.; Plasterk, Ronald H. A.\n\n2004-01-01\n\nProtein misfolding and the formation of aggregates are increasingly recognized components of the pathology of human genetic disease and hallmarks of many neurodegenerative disorders. As exemplified by polyglutamine diseases, the propensity for protein misfolding is associated with the length of polyglutamine expansions and age-dependent changes in protein-folding homeostasis, suggesting a critical role for a protein homeostatic buffer. To identify the complement of protein factors that protects cells against the formation of protein aggregates, we tested transgenic Caenorhabditis elegans strains expressing polyglutamine expansion yellow fluorescent protein fusion proteins at the threshold length associated with the age-dependent appearance of protein aggregation. We used genome-wide RNA interference to identify genes that, when suppressed, resulted in the premature appearance of protein aggregates. Our screen identified 186 genes corresponding to five principal classes of polyglutamine regulators: genes involved in RNA metabolism, protein synthesis, protein folding, and protein degradation; and those involved in protein trafficking. We propose that each of these classes represents a molecular machine collectively comprising the protein homeostatic buffer that responds to the expression of damaged proteins to prevent their misfolding and aggregation.

Huntington's disease (HD), dentatorubral pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA), spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA), and spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) types 1, 2, 3, 7 and 17 are each caused by a CAG repeat expansion that encodes polyglutamine. Convergent lines of evidence demonstrate that neurodegeneration in these diseases is a consequence of the neurotoxic effects of abnormally long stretches of glutamines. How polyglutamine induces neurodegeneration, and why neurodegeneration occurs in only select neuronal populations, remains a matter of intense investigation. SCA6 is caused by a CAG repeat expansion in CACNA1A, a gene that encodes a subunit of the P/Q-type calcium channel. The threshold length at which the repeat causes disease is much shorter than in the other polyglutamine diseases, and neurodegeneration may arise from expansion-induced change of function in the calcium channel. Huntington's disease-like 2 (HDL2) and SCAs 8, 10 and 12 are rare disorders in which the repeats (CAG, CTG or ATTCT) are not in protein-coding regions. Investigation into these diseases is still at an early stage, but it is now reasonable to hypothesise that the net effect of each expansion is to alter gene expression. The different pathogenic mechanisms in these three groups of diseases have important implications for the development of rational therapeutics.\n\nSpontaneous formation of polyglutamine nanotubes with molecular dynamics simulations\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLaghaei, Rozita; Mousseau, Normand\n\n2010-04-01\n\nExpansion of polyglutamine (polyQ) beyond the pathogenic threshold (35-40 Gln) is associated with several neurodegenerative diseases including Huntington's disease, several forms of spinocerebellar ataxias and spinobulbar muscular atrophy. To determine the structure of polyglutamine aggregates we perform replica-exchange molecular dynamics simulations coupled with the optimized potential for effective peptide forcefield. Using a range of temperatures from 250 to 700 K, we study the aggregation kinetics of the polyglutamine monomer and dimer with chain lengths from 30 to 50 residues. All monomers show a similar structural change at the same temperature from Î±-helical structure to random coil, without indication of any significant Î²-strand. For dimers, by contrast, starting from random structures, we observe spontaneous formation of antiparallel Î²-sheets and triangular and circular Î²-helical structures for polyglutamine with 40 residues in a 400 ns 50 temperature replica-exchange molecular dynamics simulation (total integrated time 20 Î¼s). This Ë32 Ã diameter structure reorganizes further into a tight antiparallel double-stranded Ë22 Ã nanotube with 22 residues per turn close to Perutz' model for amyloid fibers as water-filled nanotubes. This diversity of structures suggests the existence of polymorphism for polyglutamine with possibly different pathways leading to the formation of toxic oligomers and to fibrils.\n\nEvidence for sequestration of polyglutamine inclusions by Drosophila myeloid leukemia factor.\n\nPubMed\n\nKim, Woo-Yang; Fayazi, Zahra; Bao, Xiankun; Higgins, Dennis; Kazemi-Esfarjani, Parsa\n\n2005-08-01\n\nIntracellular inclusions of abnormally long polyglutamine tracts and neurotoxicity are the hallmarks of several hereditary neurodegenerative disorders, including Huntington's disease (HD). In Drosophila melanogaster, dMLF, an ortholog of human myeloid leukemia factors, hMLF1 and hMLF2, suppressed polyglutamine toxicity and colocalized with the inclusions. In transfected primary rat neuronal cultures, dMLF and its orthologs reduced the morphological phenotypes and inclusions. Furthermore, dMLF reduced the recruitment of CBP and Hsp70 into the inclusions, both of which are among many essential proteins apparently trapped in the inclusions. These data suggest that a possible mechanism of suppression by dMLF is via the sequestration of polyglutamine oligomers or inclusions.\n\nFrom The Cover: Genome-wide RNA interference screen identifies previously undescribed regulators of polyglutamine aggregation\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nNollen, Ellen A.

The length of the poly-Q regions plays an important role in the progression of the diseases. The number of glutamines (Q) is inversely related to the onset age of these polyglutamine diseases, and the expansion of poly-Q repeats has been associated with protein misfolding. However, very little is known about the structural changes induced by the expansion of the repeats. Computational methods can provide an alternative to determine the structure of these poly-Q proteins, but it is important to evaluate their performance before large scale prediction work is done. Results In this paper, two popular protein structure prediction programs, I-TASSER and Rosetta, have been used to predict the structure of the N-terminal fragment of a protein associated with Huntington's disease with 17 glutamines. Results show that both programs have the ability to find the native structures, but I-TASSER performs better for the overall task. Conclusions Both I-TASSER and Rosetta can be used for structure prediction of proteins with poly-Q repeats. Knowledge of poly-Q structure may significantly contribute to development of therapeutic strategies for poly-Q diseases.

Y-27632, a therapeutic lead, reduces Htt and AR aggregation in cultured cells, and Htt-induced neurodegeneration in Drosophila. Y-27632 inhibits both Rho-associated kinases ROCK and PRK-2, making its precise intracellular target uncertain. Over-expression of either kinase increases Htt and AR aggregation. Three ROCK inhibitors (Y-27632, H-1077, HA-1152), and a specific ROCK inhibitory peptide reduce polyglutamine protein aggregation, as does knockdown of ROCK or PRK-2 by RNAi. RNAi also indicates that each kinase is required for the inhibitory effects of Y-27632 to manifest fully. These two actin regulatory kinases are thus involved in polyglutamine aggregation, and their simultaneous inhibition may be an important therapeutic goal.

In all polyglutamine diseases, the age of onset is inversely correlated with the length of the polyglutamine domain beyond some pathological threshold. Diseased cells are characterized by intranuclear inclusions rich in aggregated polyglutamine. Experimental evidence suggests that oligomeric aggregate species, not mature amyloid fibrils, are the species most toxic to the cell. Little is known about the structures and aggregation dynamics of polyglutamine oligomers due to their short lifetimes. A better understanding of the pathway through which polyglutamine peptides form oligomeric aggregates will aid the design of therapies to inhibit their toxic activity. In this work, we report structural characterization of polyglutamine monomers and dimers from atomistic molecular dynamics simulations in explicit water. Umbrella sampling simulations reveal that the stability of the dimer species with respect to the disassociated monomers is an increasing function of the chain length.\n\nA linear lattice model for polyglutamine in CAG-expansion diseases.\n\nPubMed\n\nBennett, Melanie J; Huey-Tubman, Kathryn E; Herr, Andrew B; West, Anthony P; Ross, Scott A; Bjorkman, Pamela J\n\n2002-09-03\n\nHuntington's disease and several other neurological diseases are caused by expanded polyglutamine [poly(Gln)] tracts in different proteins. Mechanisms for expanded (>36 Gln residues) poly(Gln) toxicity include the formation of aggregates that recruit and sequester essential cellular proteins [Preisinger, E., Jordan, B. M., Kazantsev, A. & Housman, D. (1999) Phil. Trans. R. Soc. London B 354, 1029-1034; Chen, S., Berthelier, V., Yang, W. & Wetzel, R. (2001) J. Mol. Biol. 311, 173-182] and functional alterations, such as improper interactions with other proteins [Cummings, C. J. & Zoghbi, H. Y. (2000) Hum. Mol. Genet. 9, 909-916]. Expansion above the \"pathologic threshold\" ( approximately 36 Gln) has been proposed to induce a conformational transition in poly(Gln) tracts, which has been suggested as a target for therapeutic intervention. Here we show that structural analyses of soluble huntingtin exon 1 fusion proteins with 16 to 46 glutamine residues reveal extended structures with random coil characteristics and no evidence for a global conformational change above 36 glutamines. An antibody (MW1) Fab fragment, which recognizes full-length huntingtin in mouse brain sections, binds specifically to exon 1 constructs containing normal and expanded poly(Gln) tracts, with affinity and stoichiometry that increase with poly(Gln) length. These data support a \"linear lattice\" model for poly(Gln), in which expanded poly(Gln) tracts have an increased number of ligand-binding sites as compared with normal poly(Gln). The linear lattice model provides a rationale for pathogenicity of expanded poly(Gln) tracts and a structural framework for drug design.\n\nQuantification Assays for Total and Polyglutamine-Expanded Huntingtin Proteins\n\nPubMed Central\n\nBoogaard, Ivette; Smith, Melanie; Pulli, Kristiina; Szynol, Agnieszka; Albertus, Faywell; Lamers, Marieke B. A. C.; Dijkstra, Sipke; Kordt, Daniel; Reindl, Wolfgang; Herrmann, Frank; McAllister, George; Fischer, David F.; Munoz-Sanjuan, Ignacio\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThe expansion of a CAG trinucleotide repeat in the huntingtin gene, which produces huntingtin protein with an expanded polyglutamine tract, is the cause of Huntington's disease (HD). Recent studies have reported that RNAi suppression of polyglutamine-expanded huntingtin (mutant HTT) in HD animal models can ameliorate disease phenotypes. A key requirement for such preclinical studies, as well as eventual clinical trials, aimed to reduce mutant HTT exposure is a robust method to measure HTT protein levels in select tissues. We have developed several sensitive and selective assays that measure either total human HTT or polyglutamine-expanded human HTT proteins on the electrochemiluminescence Meso Scale Discovery detection platform with an increased dynamic range over other methods. In addition, we have developed an assay to detect endogenous mouse and rat HTT proteins in pre-clinical models of HD to monitor effects on the wild type protein of both allele selective and non-selective interventions. We demonstrate the application of these assays to measure HTT protein in several HD in vitro cellular and in vivo animal model systems as well as in HD patient biosamples. Furthermore, we used purified recombinant HTT proteins as standards to quantitate the absolute amount of HTT protein in such biosamples.

While their detailed structure remains unclear, polyQ peptides assume beta-sheet structures when they aggregate. To investigate the conformational ensemble of short, monomeric polyQ peptides, which consist of 15 glutamine residues (Q(15)), we performed replica exchange molecular dynamics (REMD) simulations. We found that Q(15) can assume multiple configurations due to all of the residues affecting the formation of side-chain hydrogen bonds. Analysis of the free energy landscape reveals that Q(15) has a basin for random-coil structures and another for alpha-helix or beta-turn structures. To investigate properties of aggregated polyQ peptides, we performed multiple molecular dynamics (MMD) simulations for monomeric and oligomeric Q(15). MMD revealed that the formation of oligomers stabilizes the beta-turn structure by increasing the number of hydrogen bonds between the main chains.\n\nModifiers and mechanisms of multi-system polyglutamine neurodegenerative disorders: lessons from fly models.\n\nPubMed\n\nMallik, Moushami; Lakhotia, Subhash C\n\n2010-12-01\n\nPolyglutamine (polyQ) diseases, resulting from a dynamic expansion of glutamine repeats in a polypeptide, are a class of genetically inherited late onset neurodegenerative disorders which, despite expression of the mutated gene widely in brain and other tissues, affect defined subpopulations of neurons in a disease-specific manner. We briefly review the different polyQ-expansion-induced neurodegenerative disorders and the advantages of modelling them in Drosophila. Studies using the fly models have successfully identified a variety of genetic modifiers and have helped in understanding some of the molecular events that follow expression of the abnormal polyQ proteins. Expression of the mutant polyQ proteins causes, as a consequence of intra-cellular and inter-cellular networking, mis-regulation at multiple steps like transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulations, cell signalling, protein quality control systems (protein folding and degradation networks), axonal transport machinery etc., in the sensitive neurons, resulting ultimately in their death. The diversity of genetic modifiers of polyQ toxicity identified through extensive genetic screens in fly and other models clearly reflects a complex network effect of the presence of the mutated protein. Such network effects pose a major challenge for therapeutic applications.\n\nInteraction with Polyglutamine-expanded Huntingtin Alters Cellular Distribution and RNA Processing of Huntingtin Yeast Two-hybrid Protein A (HYPA)*\n\nPubMed Central\n\nJiang, Ya-Jun; Che, Mei-Xia; Yuan, Jin-Qiao; Xie, Yuan-Yuan; Yan, Xian-Zhong; Hu, Hong-Yu\n\n2011-01-01\n\nHuntington disease (HD) is an autosomal inherited disorder that causes the deterioration of brain cells. The polyglutamine (polyQ) expansion of huntingtin (Htt) is implicated in the pathogenesis of HD via interaction with an RNA splicing factor, Htt yeast two-hybrid protein A/forming-binding protein 11 (HYPA/FBP11). Besides the pathogenic polyQ expansion, Htt also contains a proline-rich region (PRR) located exactly in the C terminus to the polyQ tract. However, how the polyQ expansion influences the PRR-mediated protein interaction and how this abnormal interaction leads to the biological consequence remain elusive. Our NMR structural analysis indicates that the PRR motif of Htt cooperatively interacts with the tandem WW domains of HYPA through domain chaperoning effect of WW1 on WW2. The polyQ-expanded Htt sequesters HYPA to the cytosolic location and then significantly reduces the efficiency of pre-mRNA splicing. We propose that the toxic gain-of-function of the polyQ-expanded Htt that causes dysfunction of cellular RNA processing contributes to the pathogenesis of HD.

Here, we used RNA-Seq to identify pathways that are disrupted in diseased muscle using AR113Q knock-in mice. This analysis unexpectedly identified significantly diminished expression of numerous ubiquitin-proteasome pathway genes in AR113Q muscle, encoding approximately 30% of proteasome subunits and 20% of E2 ubiquitin conjugases. These changes were age-, hormone- and glutamine length-dependent and arose due to a toxic gain-of-function conferred by the mutation. Moreover, altered gene expression was associated with decreased level of the proteasome transcription factor NRF1 and its activator DDI2 and resulted in diminished proteasome activity. Ubiquitinated ADRM1 was detected in AR113Q muscle, indicating the occurrence of stalled proteasomes in mutant mice. Finally, diminished expression of Drosophila orthologues of NRF1 or ADRM1 promoted the accumulation of polyQ AR protein and increased toxicity. Collectively, these data indicate that AR113Q muscle develops progressive proteasome dysfunction that leads to the impairment of quality control and the accumulation of polyQ AR protein, key features that contribute to the age-dependent onset and progression of this disorder.\n\nFolding of polyglutamine chains\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nChopra, Manan; Reddy, Allam S.; Abbott, N. L.; de Pablo, J. J.\n\n2008-10-01\n\nLong polyglutamine chains have been associated with a number of neurodegenerative diseases. These include Huntington's disease, where expanded polyglutamine (PolyQ) sequences longer than 36 residues are correlated with the onset of symptoms. In this paper we study the folding pathway of a 54-residue PolyQ chain into a Î²-helical structure. Transition path sampling Monte Carlo simulations are used to generate unbiased reactive pathways between unfolded configurations and the folded Î²-helical structure of the polyglutamine chain. The folding process is examined in both explicit water and an implicit solvent. Both models reveal that the formation of a few critical contacts is necessary and sufficient for the molecule to fold. Once the primary contacts are formed, the fate of the protein is sealed and it is largely committed to fold. We find that, consistent with emerging hypotheses about PolyQ aggregation, a stable Î²-helical structure could serve as the nucleus for subsequent polymerization of amyloid fibrils. Our results indicate that PolyQ sequences shorter than 36 residues cannot form that nucleus, and it is also shown that specific mutations inferred from an analysis of the simulated folding pathway exacerbate its stability.\n\nImpaired ERAD and ER stress are early and specific events in polyglutamine toxicity\n\nPubMed Central\n\nDuennwald, Martin L.; Lindquist, Susan\n\n2008-01-01\n\nProtein misfolding, whether caused by aging, environmental factors, or genetic mutations, is a common basis for neurodegenerative diseases. The misfolding of proteins with abnormally long polyglutamine (polyQ) expansions causes several neurodegenerative disorders, such as Huntingtonâs disease (HD). Although many cellular pathways have been documented to be impaired in HD, the primary triggers of polyQ toxicity remain elusive. We report that yeast cells and neuron-like PC12 cells expressing polyQ-expanded huntingtin (htt) fragments display a surprisingly specific, immediate, and drastic defect in endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated degradation (ERAD). We further decipher the mechanistic basis for this defect in ERAD: the entrapment of the essential ERAD proteins Npl4, Ufd1, and p97 by polyQ-expanded htt fragments. In both yeast and mammalian neuron-like cells, overexpression of Npl4 and Ufd1 ameliorates polyQ toxicity. Our results establish that impaired ER protein homeostasis is a broad and highly conserved contributor to polyQ toxicity in yeast, in PC12 cells, and, importantly, in striatal cells expressing full-length polyQ-expanded huntingtin.

In addition to its role in the molecular pathology of the polyglutamine expansion diseases, mutations of the protein are associated with X-linked mental retardation. PQBP-1 binds specifically to glutamine repeat sequences and proline-rich regions, and interacts with RNA polymerase II and the spliceosomal protein U5-15kD. In this work, we obtained a biophysical characterization of this protein by employing complementary structural methods. PQBP-1 is shown to be a moderately compact but largely disordered molecule with an elongated shape, having a Stokes radius of 3.7Â nm and a maximum molecular dimension of 13Â nm. The protein is monomeric in solution, has residual Î²-structure, and is in a premolten globule state that is unaffected by natural osmolytes. Using small-angle x-ray scattering data, we were able to generate a low-resolution, three-dimensional model of PQBP-1.

To elucidate the functional role of C9orf72 in disease pathogenesis, we identified certain molecular interactors of this factor. We determined that C9orf72 exists in a complex with SMCR8 and WDR41 and that this complex acts as a GDP/GTP exchange factor for RAB8 and RAB39, 2 RAB GTPases involved in macroautophagy/autophagy. Consequently, C9orf72 depletion in neuronal cultures leads to accumulation of unresolved aggregates of SQSTM1/p62 and phosphorylated TARDBP/TDP-43. However, C9orf72 reduction does not lead to major neuronal toxicity, suggesting that a second stress may be required to induce neuronal cell death. An intermediate size of polyglutamine repeats within ATXN2 is an important genetic modifier of ALS-FTD. We found that coexpression of intermediate polyglutamine repeats (30Q) of ATXN2 combined with C9orf72 depletion increases the aggregation of ATXN2 and neuronal toxicity. These results were confirmed in zebrafish embryos where partial C9orf72 knockdown along with intermediate (but not normal) repeat expansions in ATXN2 causes locomotion deficits and abnormal axonal projections from spinal motor neurons. These results demonstrate that C9orf72 plays an important role in the autophagy pathway while genetically interacting with another major genetic risk factor, ATXN2, to contribute to ALS-FTD pathogenesis.

Protein aggregation, which is a key feature of most of these diseases, is thought to be triggered by these expanded polyQ sequences in disease-related proteins. However, polyQ tracts are a normal feature of many human proteins, suggesting that they have an important cellular function. To clarify the potential function of polyQ repeats in biological systems, we systematically analyzed available information stored in sequence and protein interaction databases. By integrating genomic, phylogenetic, protein interaction network and functional information, we obtained evidence that polyQ tracts in proteins stabilize protein interactions. This happens most likely through structural changes whereby the polyQ sequence extends a neighboring coiled-coil region to facilitate its interaction with a coiled-coil region in another protein. Alteration of this important biological function due to polyQ expansion results in gain of abnormal interactions, leading to pathological effects like protein aggregation. Our analyses suggest that research on polyQ proteins should shift focus from expanded polyQ proteins into the characterization of the influence of the wild-type polyQ on protein interactions.

ER stress, including membrane distortion, is associated with many diseases such as Huntington's disease. In particular, nuclear envelope distortion is related to neuronal cell death associated with polyglutamine. However, the mechanism by which polyglutamine causes ER membrane distortion remains unclear. We used electron microscopy, fluorescence protease protection assay, and alkaline treatment to analyze the localization of polyglutamine in cells. We characterized polyglutamine embedded in the ER membrane and noted an effect on morphology, including the dilation of ERmoreÂ Â» luminal space and elongation of ER-mitochondria contact sites, in addition to the distortion of the nuclear envelope. The polyglutamine embedded in the ER membrane was observed at the same time as Bax insertion. These results demonstrated that the ER membrane may be a target of polyglutamine, which triggers cell death through Bax. -- Highlights: â¢We characterized polyglutamine embedded in the ER membrane. â¢The polyglutamine embedded in the ER membrane was observed at the same time as Bax insertion. â¢The ER membrane may be a target of polyglutamine, which triggers cell death.Â«Â less\n\nPolyglutamine length-dependent toxicity from Î±1ACT in Drosophila models of spinocerebellar ataxia type 6\n\nPubMed Central\n\nTsou, Wei-Ling; Qiblawi, Sultan H.; Hosking, Ryan R.; Gomez, Christopher M.\n\n2016-01-01\n\nABSTRACT Spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 (SCA6) is a neurodegenerative disease that results from abnormal expansion of a polyglutamine (polyQ) repeat. SCA6 is caused by CAG triplet repeat expansion in the gene CACNA1A, resulting in a polyQ tract of 19-33 in patients. CACNA1A, a bicistronic gene, encodes the Î±1A calcium channel subunit and the transcription factor, Î±1ACT. PolyQ expansion in Î±1ACT causes degeneration in mice. We recently described the first Drosophila models of SCA6 that express Î±1ACT with a normal (11Q) or hyper-expanded (70Q) polyQ. Here, we report additional Î±1ACT transgenic flies, which express full-length Î±1ACT with a 33Q repeat. We show that Î±1ACT33Q is toxic in Drosophila, but less so than the 70Q version. When expressed everywhere, Î±1ACT33Q-expressing adults die earlier than flies expressing the normal allele. Î±1ACT33Q causes retinal degeneration and leads to aggregated species in an age-dependent manner, but at a slower pace than the 70Q counterpart. According to western blots, Î±1ACT33Q localizes less readily in the nucleus than Î±1ACT70Q, providing clues into the importance of polyQ tract length on Î±1ACT localization and its site of toxicity. We expect that these new lines will be highly valuable for future work on SCA6. PMID:27979829\n\nChaperones in Polyglutamine Aggregation: Beyond the Q-Stretch\n\nPubMed Central\n\nKuiper, E. F. E.; de Mattos, Eduardo P.; Jardim, Laura B.; Kampinga, Harm H.; Bergink, Steven\n\n2017-01-01\n\nExpanded polyglutamine (polyQ) stretches in at least nine unrelated proteins lead to inherited neuronal dysfunction and degeneration. The expansion size in all diseases correlates with age at onset (AO) of disease and with polyQ protein aggregation, indicating that the expanded polyQ stretch is the main driving force for the disease onset. Interestingly, there is marked interpatient variability in expansion thresholds for a given disease. Between different polyQ diseases the repeat length vs. AO also indicates the existence of modulatory effects on aggregation of the upstream and downstream amino acid sequences flanking the Q expansion. This can be either due to intrinsic modulation of aggregation by the flanking regions, or due to differential interaction with other proteins, such as the components of the cellular protein quality control network. Indeed, several lines of evidence suggest that molecular chaperones have impact on the handling of different polyQ proteins. Here, we review factors differentially influencing polyQ aggregation: the Q-stretch itself, modulatory flanking sequences, interaction partners, cleavage of polyQ-containing proteins, and post-translational modifications, with a special focus on the role of molecular chaperones. By discussing typical examples of how these factors influence aggregation, we provide more insight on the variability of AO between different diseases as well as within the same polyQ disorder, on the molecular level.

The reason why such a minimal length exists at all has remained one of the main open issues in research on the molecular origins of such classes of diseases. Following the seminal proposals of Perutz, most research has focused on the hunt for a special structure, attainable only above the minimal length, able to trigger aggregation. Such a structure has remained elusive and there is growing evidence that it might not exist at all. Here we review some basic polymer and statistical physics facts and show that the existence of a threshold is compatible with the modulation that the repeat length imposes on the association and dissociation rates of polyglutamine polypeptides to and from oligomers. In particular, their dramatically different functional dependence on the length rationalizes the very presence of a threshold and hints at the cellular processes that might be at play, in vivo, to prevent aggregation and the consequent onset of the disease.\n\nThe Role of the Immune System in Triplet Repeat Expansion Diseases\n\nPubMed Central\n\nUrbanek, Martyna O.; Krzyzosiak, Wlodzimierz J.\n\n2015-01-01\n\nTrinucleotide repeat expansion disorders (TREDs) are a group of dominantly inherited neurological diseases caused by the expansion of unstable repeats in specific regions of the associated genes. Expansion of CAG repeat tracts in translated regions of the respective genes results in polyglutamine- (polyQ-) rich proteins that form intracellular aggregates that affect numerous cellular activities. Recent evidence suggests the involvement of an RNA toxicity component in polyQ expansion disorders, thus increasing the complexity of the pathogenic processes. Neurodegeneration, accompanied by reactive gliosis and astrocytosis is the common feature of most TREDs, which may suggest involvement of inflammation in pathogenesis. Indeed, a number of immune response markers have been observed in the blood and CNS of patients and mouse models, and the activation of these markers was even observed in the premanifest stage of the disease. Although inflammation is not an initiating factor of TREDs, growing evidence indicates that inflammatory responses involving astrocytes, microglia, and the peripheral immune system may contribute to disease progression. Herein, we review the involvement of the immune system in the pathogenesis of triplet repeat expansion diseases, with particular emphasis on polyglutamine disorders. We also present various therapeutic approaches targeting the dysregulated inflammation pathways in these diseases.

By a genetic screen in Drosophila, devised to uncover genes that suppress poly(Q) toxicity, we discovered a Drosophila homolog of human myeloid leukemia factor 1 (MLF1). Expression of the Drosophila homolog (dMLF) ameliorates the toxicity of poly(Q) expressed in the eye and central nervous system. In the retina, whether endogenously or ectopically expressed, dMLF co-localized with aggregates, suggesting that dMLF alone, or through an intermediary molecular partner, may suppress toxicity by sequestering poly(Q) and/or its aggregates.\n\nMR Imaging in Spinocerebellar Ataxias: A Systematic Review.\n\nPubMed\n\nKlaes, A; Reckziegel, E; Franca, M C; Rezende, T J R; Vedolin, L M; Jardim, L B; Saute, J A\n\n2016-08-01\n\nPolyglutamine expansion spinocerebellar ataxias are autosomal dominant slowly progressive neurodegenerative diseases with no current treatment. MR imaging is the best-studied surrogate biomarker candidate for polyglutamine expansion spinocerebellar ataxias, though with conflicting results. We aimed to review quantitative central nervous system MR imaging technique findings in patients with polyglutamine expansion spinocerebellar ataxias and correlations with well-established clinical and molecular disease markers. We searched MEDLINE, LILACS, and Cochrane data bases of clinical trials between January 1995 and January 2016, for quantitative MR imaging volumetric approaches, MR spectroscopy, diffusion tensor imaging, or other quantitative techniques, comparing patients with polyglutamine expansion spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) with controls. Pertinent details for each study regarding participants, imaging methods, and results were extracted. After reviewing the 706 results, 18 studies were suitable for inclusion: 2 studies in SCA1, 1 in SCA2, 15 in SCA3, 1 in SCA7, 1 in SCA1 and SCA6 presymptomatic carriers, and none in SCA17 and dentatorubropallidoluysian atrophy. Cerebellar hemispheres and vermis, whole brain stem, midbrain, pons, medulla oblongata, cervical spine, striatum, and thalamus presented significant atrophy in SCA3. The caudate, putamen and whole brain stem presented similar sensitivity to change compared with ataxia scales after 2 years of follow-up in a single prospective study in SCA3. MR spectroscopy and DTI showed abnormalities only in cross-sectional studies in SCA3. Results from single studies in other polyglutamine expansion spinocerebellar ataxias should be replicated in different cohorts. Additional cross-sectional and prospective volumetric analysis, MR spectroscopy, and DTI studies are necessary in polyglutamine expansion spinocerebellar ataxias.

In this work, we use a novel application of the host-guest method, combining folding theory with experiments, to model the structure of natively disordered polyglutamine peptides. Initially, a minimalist molecular model (C(alpha)C(beta)) of CI2 is developed with a structurally based potential and captures many of the folding properties of CI2 determined from experiments. Next, polyglutamine \"guest\" inserts of increasing length are introduced into the CI2 \"host\" model and the polyglutamine is modeled to match the resultant change in CI2 thermodynamic stability between simulations and experiments. The polyglutamine model that best mimics the experimental changes in CI2 thermodynamic stability has 1), a beta-strand dihedral preference and 2), an attractive energy between polyglutamine atoms 0.75-times the attractive energy between the CI2 host Go-contacts. When free-energy differences in the CI2 host-guest system are correctly modeled at varying lengths of polyglutamine guest inserts, the kinetic folding rates and structural perturbation of these CI2 insert mutants are also correctly captured in simulations without any additional parameter adjustment. In agreement with experiments, the residues showing structural perturbation are located in the immediate vicinity of the loop insert. The simulated polyglutamine loop insert predominantly adopts extended random coil conformations, a structural model consistent with low resolution experimental methods. The agreement between simulation and experimental CI2 folding rates, CI2 structural perturbation, and polyglutamine insert structure show that this host-guest method can select a physically realistic model for inserted polyglutamine. If other amyloid peptides can be inserted into stable protein hosts and the stabilities of these host-guest mutants determined, this novel host-guest method\n\nIn Vitro Expansion of CAG, CAA, and Mixed CAG/CAA Repeats.\n\nPubMed\n\nFigura, Grzegorz; Koscianska, Edyta; Krzyzosiak, Wlodzimierz J\n\n2015-08-11\n\nPolyglutamine diseases, including Huntington's disease and a number of spinocerebellar ataxias, are caused by expanded CAG repeats that are located in translated sequences of individual, functionally-unrelated genes. Only mutant proteins containing polyglutamine expansions have long been thought to be pathogenic, but recent evidence has implicated mutant transcripts containing long CAG repeats in pathogenic processes. The presence of two pathogenic factors prompted us to attempt to distinguish the effects triggered by mutant protein from those caused by mutant RNA in cellular models of polyglutamine diseases. We used the SLIP (Synthesis of Long Iterative Polynucleotide) method to generate plasmids expressing long CAG repeats (forming a hairpin structure), CAA-interrupted CAG repeats (forming multiple unstable hairpins) or pure CAA repeats (not forming any secondary structure). We successfully modified the original SLIP protocol to generate repeats of desired length starting from constructs containing short repeat tracts. We demonstrated that the SLIP method is a time- and cost-effective approach to manipulate the lengths of expanded repeat sequences.\n\nToxicity and aggregation of the polyglutamine disease protein, ataxin-3 is regulated by its binding to VCP/p97 in Drosophila melanogaster.\n\nPubMed\n\nRistic, Gorica; Sutton, Joanna R; Libohova, Kozeta; Todi, Sokol V\n\n2018-04-26\n\nAmong the nine dominantly inherited, age-dependent neurodegenerative diseases caused by abnormal expansion in the polyglutamine (polyQ) repeat of otherwise unrelated proteins is Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 3 (SCA3). SCA3 is caused by polyQ expansion in the deubiquitinase (DUB), ataxin-3. Molecular sequelae related to SCA3 remain unclear. Here, we sought to understand the role of protein context in SCA3 by focusing on the interaction between this DUB and Valosin-Containing Protein (VCP). VCP is bound directly by ataxin-3 through an arginine-rich area preceding the polyQ repeat. We examined the importance of this interaction in ataxin-3-dependent degeneration in Drosophila melanogaster. Our assays with new isogenic fly lines expressing pathogenic ataxin-3 with an intact or mutated VCP-binding site show that disrupting the ataxin-3-VCP interaction delays the aggregation of the toxic protein in vivo. Importantly, early on flies that express pathogenic ataxin-3 with a mutated VCP-binding site are indistinguishable from flies that do not express any SCA3 protein. Also, reducing levels of VCP through RNA-interference has a similar, protective effect to mutating the VCP-binding site of pathogenic ataxin-3. Based on in vivo pulse-chases, aggregated species of ataxin-3 are highly stable, in a manner independent of VCP-binding. Collectively, our results highlight an important role for the ataxin-3-VCP interaction in SCA3, based on a model that posits a seeding effect from VCP on pathogenic ataxin-3 aggregation and subsequent toxicity.

An anti-polyQ antigen-binding fragment, MW1 Fab, was crystallized both on Earth and on the International Space Station, a microgravity environment where convection is limited. Once the crystals returned to Earth, the number, size and morphology of all crystals were recorded, and X-ray data were collected from representative crystals.

Methods: We invited researchers from the Genetic Epidemiology of Parkinson's Disease Consortium to participate in the study. There were 12,346 cases and 8,164 controls genotyped, for a total of 4 repeats within the SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, and SCA17 genes. Fixed- and random-effects models were used to estimate the summary risk estimates for the genes. We investigated between-study heterogeneity and heterogeneity between different ethnic populations. Results: We did not observe any definite pathogenic repeat expansions for SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, and SCA17 genes in patients with idiopathic PD from Caucasian and Asian populations. Furthermore, overall analysis did not reveal any significant association between intermediate repeats and PD. The effect estimates (odds ratio) ranged from 0.93 to 1.01 in the overall cohort for the SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, and SCA17 loci. Conclusions: Our study did not support a major role for definite pathogenic repeat expansions in SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, and SCA17 genes for idiopathic PD. Thus, results of this large study do not support diagnostic screening of SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, and SCA17 gene repeats in the common idiopathic form of PD. Likewise, this largest multicentered study performed to date excludes the role of intermediate repeats of these genes as a risk factor for PD.

M.; Kinjo, Masataka; Ariga, Hiroyoshi\n\n2013-01-01\n\nHuntington disease is caused by cell death after the expansion of polyglutamine (polyQ) tracts longer than â¼40 repeats encoded by exon 1 of the huntingtin (HTT) gene. Prefoldin is a molecular chaperone composed of six subunits, PFD1â6, and prevents misfolding of newly synthesized nascent polypeptides. In this study, we found that knockdown of PFD2 and PFD5 disrupted prefoldin formation in HTT-expressing cells, resulting in accumulation of aggregates of a pathogenic form of HTT and in induction of cell death. Dead cells, however, did not contain inclusions of HTT, and analysis by a fluorescence correlation spectroscopy indicated that knockdown of PFD2 and PFD5 also increased the size of soluble oligomers of pathogenic HTT in cells. In vitro single molecule observation demonstrated that prefoldin suppressed HTT aggregation at the small oligomer (dimer to tetramer) stage. These results indicate that prefoldin inhibits elongation of large oligomers of pathogenic Htt, thereby inhibiting subsequent inclusion formation, and suggest that soluble oligomers of polyQ-expanded HTT are more toxic than are inclusion to cells.

In patients, the number of glutamine residues in polyQ tracts are over 35, and it is correlated with age of onset, severity, and disease progression. Expansion of polyQ increases the propensity for HTT protein aggregation, process known to be implicated in neurodegeneration. These pathological aggregates can be transmitted from neuron to another neuron, and this process may explain the pathological spreading of polyQ aggregates. Here, we developed an in vivo model for studying transmission of polyQ aggregates in a highly quantitative manner in real time. HTT exon 1 with expanded polyQ was fused with either N-terminal or C-terminal fragments of Venus fluorescence protein and expressed in pharyngeal muscles and associated neurons, respectively, of C. elegans. Transmission of polyQ proteins was detected using bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC). Mutant polyQ (Q97) was transmitted much more efficiently than wild type polyQ (Q25) and forms numerous inclusion bodies as well. The transmission of Q97 was gradually increased with aging of animal. The animals with polyQ transmission exhibited degenerative phenotypes, such as nerve degeneration, impaired pharyngeal pumping behavior, and reduced life span. The C. elegans model presented here would be a useful in vivo model system for the study of polyQ aggregate propagation and might be applied to the screening of genetic and chemical modifiers of the propagation.

For this, we used state-of-the-art molecular dynamics simulations combined with a novel statistical analysis to characterize the various properties of the backbone dihedral angles and secondary structural motifs of the glutamine residues. For (i.e., just above the pathological length for Huntington's disease), the equilibrium conformations of the monomer consist primarily of disordered, compact structures with non-negligible -helical and turn content. We also observed a relatively small population of extended structures suitable for forming aggregates including - and -strands, and - and -hairpins. Most importantly, for we find that there exists a long-range correlation (ranging for at least residues) among the backbone dihedral angles of the Q residues. For polyglutamine peptides below the pathological length, the population of the extended strands and hairpins is considerably smaller, and the correlations are short-range (at most residues apart). Adding a C-terminal hexaproline to suppresses both the population of these rare motifs and the long-range correlation of the dihedral angles. We argue that the long-range correlation of the polyglutamine homopeptide, along with the presence of these rare motifs, could be responsible for its aggregation phenomena.

We apply fluorescence lifetime imaging for the characterization of the fluorescence dynamics of the enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) in fusion with the polyQ-expanded polyglutamine stretch. At the expansion of polyQ above 39 residues, it has an inherent propensity to form amyloid-like fibrils and aggregates, and is responsible for Huntington's disease. The results of the experiments show that expression of the eGFP in fusion with the 97Q protein leads to the decrease of the eGFP fluorescence lifetime by ~300 ps. This phenomenon does not appear in Hsp104-deficient cells, where the aggregation in polyQ is prevented. We demonstrate that the lifetime decrease observed is related to the aggregation per se and discuss the possible role of refractive index and homo-FRET in these dynamics.\n\nSynergistic Toxicity of Polyglutamine-Expanded TATA-Binding Protein in Glia and Neuronal Cells: Therapeutic Implications for Spinocerebellar Ataxia 17\n\nPubMed Central\n\nYang, Yang; Cui, Yiting; Tang, Beisha\n\n2017-01-01\n\nSpinocerebellar ataxia 17 (SCA17) is caused by polyglutamine (polyQ) repeat expansion in the TATA-binding protein (TBP) and is among a family of neurodegenerative diseases in which polyQ expansion leads to preferential neuronal loss in the brain. Although previous studies have demonstrated that expression of polyQ-expanded proteins in glial cells can cause neuronal injury via noncell-autonomous mechanisms, these studies investigated animal models that overexpress transgenic mutant proteins. Since glial cells are particularly reactive to overexpressed mutant proteins, it is important to investigate the in vivo role of glial dysfunction in neurodegeneration when mutant polyQ proteins are endogenously expressed. In the current study, we generated two conditional TBP-105Q knock-in mouse models that specifically express mutant TBP at the endogenous level in neurons or in astrocytes. We found that mutant TBP expression in neuronal cells or astrocytes alone only caused mild neurodegeneration, whereas severe neuronal toxicity requires the expression of mutant TBP in both neuronal and glial cells. Coculture of neurons and astrocytes further validated that mutant TBP in astrocytes promoted neuronal injury. We identified activated inflammatory signaling pathways in mutant TBP-expressing astrocytes, and blocking nuclear factor ÎºB (NF-ÎºB) signaling in astrocytes ameliorated neurodegeneration. Our results indicate that the synergistic toxicity of mutant TBP in neuronal and glial cells plays a critical role in SCA17 pathogenesis and that targeting glial inflammation could be a potential therapeutic approach for SCA17 treatment. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Mutant TBP with polyglutamine expansion preferentially affects neuronal viability in SCA17 patients. Whether glia, the cells that support and protect neurons, contribute to neurodegeneration in SCA17 remains mostly unexplored. In this study, we provide both in vivo and in vitro evidence arguing that endogenous expression of mutant\n\nAggregation of polyglutamine-expanded ataxin-3 sequesters its specific interacting partners into inclusions: Implication in a loss-of-function pathology\n\nPubMed Central\n\nYang, Hui; Li, Jing-Jing; Liu, Shuai; Zhao, Jian; Jiang, Ya-Jun; Song, Ai-Xin; Hu, Hong-Yu\n\n2014-01-01\n\nExpansion of polyglutamine (polyQ) tract may cause protein misfolding and aggregation that lead to cytotoxicity and neurodegeneration, but the underlying mechanism remains to be elucidated. We applied ataxin-3 (Atx3), a polyQ tract-containing protein, as a model to study sequestration of normal cellular proteins. We found that the aggregates formed by polyQ-expanded Atx3 sequester its interacting partners, such as P97/VCP and ubiquitin conjugates, into the protein inclusions through specific interactions both in vitro and in cells. Moreover, this specific sequestration impairs the normal cellular function of P97 in down-regulating neddylation. However, expansion of polyQ tract in Atx3 does not alter the conformation of its surrounding regions and the interaction affinities with the interacting partners, although it indeed facilitates misfolding and aggregation of the Atx3 protein. Thus, we propose a loss-of-function pathology for polyQ diseases that sequestration of the cellular essential proteins via specific interactions into inclusions by the polyQ aggregates causes dysfunction of the corresponding proteins, and consequently leads to neurodegeneration.

Poly-X reduces the large number of degrees of freedom required to specify a protein motif in complete atomic detail. The result is a small number of parameters that are easily understood by, and under the direct control of, a domain expert. The system was applied to the polyglutamine (poly-Q) repeat in the first exon of huntingtin, the gene implicated in Huntington's disease. We present four poly-Q structural motifs: two poly-Q beta-sheet motifs (parallel and antiparallel) that constitute plausible alternatives to a similar previously published poly-Q beta-sheet motif, and two novel poly-Q helix motifs (alpha-helix and pi-helix). To our knowledge, helical forms of polyglutamine have not been proposed before. The motifs suggest that there may be several plausible aggregation structures for the intranuclear inclusion bodies which have been found in diseased neurons, and may help in the effort to understand the structural basis for Huntington's disease.\n\nExpression of human PQBP-1 in Drosophila impairs long-term memory and induces abnormal courtship.\n\nPubMed\n\nYoshimura, Natsue; Horiuchi, Daisuke; Shibata, Masao; Saitoe, Minoru; Qi, Mei-Ling; Okazawa, Hitoshi\n\n2006-04-17\n\nFrame shift mutations of the polyglutamine binding protein-1 (PQBP1) gene lead to total or partial truncation of the C-terminal domain (CTD) and cause mental retardation in human patients. Interestingly, normal Drosophila homologue of PQBP-1 lacks CTD. As a model to analyze the molecular network of PQBP-1 affecting intelligence, we generated transgenic flies expressing human PQBP-1 with CTD. Pavlovian olfactory conditioning revealed that the transgenic flies showed disturbance of long-term memory. In addition, they showed abnormal courtship that male flies follow male flies. Abnormal functions of PQBP-1 or its binding partner might be linked to these symptoms.\n\nThe role of polyglutamine expansion and protein context in disease-related huntingtin/lipid interactions\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBurke, Kathleen Anne\n\nHuntington's Disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that is defined by the accumulation of nanoscale aggregates comprised of the huntingtin (htt) protein. Aggregation is directly caused by an expanded polyglutamine (polyQ) domain in htt, leading to a diverse population of aggregate species, such as oligomers, fibrils, and annular aggregates. Furthermore, the length of this polyQ domain is directly related to onset and severity of disease. The first 17 amino acids on the N-terminus (N17) and the polyproline domain on the C-terminal side of the polyQ domain have been shown to further modulate the aggregation process. Additionally, N17 appears to have lipid binding properties as htt interacts with a variety of membrane-containing structures present in cells, such as organelles, and interactions with these membrane surfaces may further modulate htt aggregation. To investigate the interaction between htt exon1 and lipid bilayers, in situ atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to directly monitor the aggregation of htt exon1 constructs with varying Q-length (35Q, 46Q, 51Q, and myc- 53Q) or synthetic peptides with different polyQ domain flanking sequences (KK-Q35-KK, KK-Q 35-P10-KK, N17-Q35-KK, and N 17-Q35-P10-KK) on supported lipid membranes comprised of total brain lipid extract. The exon1 fragments accumulated on the lipid membranes, causing disruption of the membrane, in a polyQ dependent manner. By adding N-terminal tags to the htt exon1 fragments, the interaction with the lipid bilayer was impeded. The KK-Q35-KK and KK-Q 35-P10-KK peptides had no appreciable interaction with lipid bilayers. Interestingly, polyQ peptides with the N17 flanking sequence interacted with the bilayer. N17-Q35-KK formed discrete aggregates on the bilayer, but there was minimal membrane disruption. The N17-Q35-P10-KK peptide interacted more aggressively with the lipid bilayer in a manner reminiscent of the htt exon1 proteins.\n\nEffect of cobalt doping on the structural, magnetic and abnormal thermal expansion properties of NaZn13-type La(Fe1-xCox)11.4Al1.6 compounds.\n\nPubMed\n\nZhao, Yuqiang; Huang, Rongjin; Li, Shaopeng; Wang, Wei; Jiang, Xingxing; Lin, Zheshuai; Li, Jiangtao; Li, Laifeng\n\n2016-07-27\n\nCubic NaZn13-type La(Fe1-xCox)11.4Al1.6 compounds were synthesized and extensively explored through crystal structure and magnetization analyses. By optimizing the chemical composition, the isotropic abnormal properties of excellent zero and giant negative thermal expansion in a pure form were both found at different temperature ranges through room temperature. Moreover, the temperature regions with the remarkable abnormal thermal expansion (ATE) properties have been broadened which are controlled by the dM/dT. The present study demonstrates that the ATE behavior mainly depends on special structural and magnetic properties. These diverse properties suggest the high potential of La(Fe1-xCox)11.4Al1.6 for the development of abnormal expansion materials.\n\nPolyalanine expansions drive a shift into Î±-helical clusters without amyloid-fibril formation.\n\nPubMed\n\nPolling, Saskia; Ormsby, Angelique R; Wood, Rebecca J; Lee, Kristie; Shoubridge, Cheryl; Hughes, James N; Thomas, Paul Q; Griffin, Michael D W; Hill, Andrew F; Bowden, Quill; BÃ¶cking, Till; Hatters, Danny M\n\n2015-12-01\n\nPolyglutamine (polyGln) expansions in nine human proteins result in neurological diseases and induce the proteins' tendency to form Î²-rich amyloid fibrils and intracellular deposits. Less well known are at least nine other human diseases caused by polyalanine (polyAla)-expansion mutations in different proteins. The mechanisms of how polyAla aggregates under physiological conditions remain unclear and controversial. We show here that aggregation of polyAla is mechanistically dissimilar to that of polyGln and hence does not exhibit amyloid kinetics. PolyAla assembled spontaneously into Î±-helical clusters with diverse oligomeric states. Such clustering was pervasive in cells irrespective of visible aggregate formation, and it disrupted the normal physiological oligomeric state of two human proteins natively containing polyAla: ARX and SOX3. This self-assembly pattern indicates that polyAla expansions chronically disrupt protein behavior by imposing a deranged oligomeric status.\n\nNeuronal intranuclear inclusions are ultrastructurally and immunologically distinct from cytoplasmic inclusions of neuronal intermediate filament inclusion disease\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMosaheb, Sabrina; Thorpe, Julian R.; Hashemzadeh-Bonehi, Lida; Bigio, Eileen H.; Gearing, Marla; Cairns, Nigel J.\n\n2006-01-01\n\nAbnormal neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions (NCIs) containing aggregates of Î±-internexin and the neurofilament (NF) subunits, NF-H, NF-M, and NF-L, are the signature lesions of neuronal intermediate filament (IF) inclusion disease (NIFID). The disease has a clinically heterogeneous phenotype, including fronto-temporal dementia, pyramidal and extrapyramidal signs presenting at a young age. NCIs are variably ubiquitinated and about half of cases also have neuronal intranuclear inclusions (NIIs), which are also ubiquitinated. NIIs have been described in polyglutamine-repeat expansion diseases, where they are strongly ubiquitin immunoreactive. The fine structure of NIIs of NIFID has not previously been described. Therefore, to determine the ultrastructure of NIIs, immunoelectron microscopy was undertaken on NIFID cases and normal aged control brains. Our results indicate that the NIIs of NIFID are strongly ubiquitin immunoreactive. However, unlike NCIs which contain ubiquitin, Î±-internexin and NF epitopes, NIIs contain neither epitopes of Î±-internexin nor NF subunits. Neither NIIs nor NCIs were recognised by antibodies to expanded polyglutamine repeats. The NII of NIFID lacks a limiting membrane and contains straight filaments of 20 nm mean width (range 11â35 nm), while NCIs contain filaments with a mean width of 10 nm (range 5â18 nm; t-test, P<0.001). Biochemistry revealed no differences in neuronal IF protein mobilities between NIFID and normal brain tissue. Therefore, NIIs of NIFID contain filaments morphologically and immunologically distinct from those of NCIs, and both types of inclusion lack expanded polyglutamine tracts of the triplet-repeat expansion diseases. These observations indicate that abnormal protein aggregation follows separate pathways in different neuronal compartments of NIFID.

This misfolded ATXN1 causes severe Purkinje cell (PC) loss and cerebellar ataxia in both humans and mice with the SCA1 disease. The molecular chaperone heat-shock proteins (HSPs) are known to modulate polyglutamine protein aggregation and are neuroprotective. Since HSPs are induced under stress, we explored the effects of focused laser light induced hyperthermia (HT) on HSP-mediated protection against ATXN1 toxicity. We first tested the effects of HT in a cell culture model and found that HT induced Hsp70 and increased its localization to nuclear inclusions in HeLa cells expressing GFP-ATXN1[82Q]. HT treatment decreased ATXN1 aggregation by making GFP-ATXN1[82Q] inclusions smaller and more numerous compared to non-treated cells. Further, we tested our HT approach in vivo using a transgenic (Tg) mouse model of SCA1. We found that our laser method increased cerebellar temperature from 38 to 40Â Â°C without causing any neuronal damage or inflammatory response. Interestingly, mild cerebellar HT stimulated the production of Hsp70 to a significant level. Furthermore, multiple exposure of focused cerebellar laser light induced HT to heterozygous SCA1 transgenic (Tg) mice significantly suppressed the SCA1 phenotype as compared to sham-treated control animals. Moreover, in treated SCA1 Tg mice, the levels of PC calcium signaling/buffering protein calbindin-D28k markedly increased followed by a reduction in PC neurodegenerative morphology. Taken together, our data suggest that laser light induced HT is a novel non-invasive approach to treat SCA1 and maybe other polyglutamine disorders.\n\nNeurodegenerative Models in Drosophila: Polyglutamine Disorders, Parkinson Disease, and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis\n\nPubMed Central\n\nAmbegaokar, Surendra S.; Roy, Bidisha; Jackson, George R.\n\n2010-01-01\n\nNeurodegenerative diseases encompass a large group of neurological disorders. Clinical symptoms can include memory loss, cognitive impairment, loss of movement or loss of control of movement, and loss of sensation. Symptoms are typically adult onset (although severe cases can occur in adolescents) and are reflective of neuronal and glial cell loss in the central nervous system. Neurodegenerative diseases also are considered progressive, with increased severity of symptoms over time, also reflective of increased neuronal cell death. However, various neurodegenerative diseases differentially affect certain brain regions or neuronal or glial cell types. As an example, Alzheimer disease (AD) primarily affects the temporal lobe, whereas neuronal loss in Parkinson disease (PD) is largely (although not exclusively) confined to the nigrostriatal system. Neuronal loss is almost invariably accompanied by abnormal insoluble aggregates, either intra- or extracellular. Thus, neurodegenerative diseases are categorized by (a) the composite of clinical symptoms, (b) the brain regions or types of brain cells primarily affected, and (c) the types of protein aggregates found in the brain. Here we review the methods by which Drosophila melanogaster has been used to model aspects of polyglutamine diseases, Parkinson disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and key insights into that have been gained from these models; Alzheimer disease and the tauopathies are covered elsewhere in this special issue.

M.\n\n2018-01-01\n\nIn this paper, we study the early stages of aggregation of a model of polyglutamine (polyQ) for different repeat lengths (number of glutamine amino acid groups in the chain). In particular, we use the Large-scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator to study a generic coarse-grained model proposed by Bereau and Deserno. We focus on the primary nucleation mechanism involved and find that our results for the initial self-assembly process are consistent with the two-dimensional classical nucleation theory of Kashchiev and Auer. More specifically, we find that with decreasing supersaturation, the oligomer fibril (protofibril) transforms from a one-dimensional Î² sheet to two-, three-, and higher layer Î² sheets as the critical nucleus size increases. We also show that the results are consistent with several predictions of their theory, including the dependence of the critical nucleus size on the supersaturation. Our results for the time dependence of the mass aggregation are in reasonable agreement with an approximate analytical solution of the filament theory by Knowles and collaborators that corresponds to an additional secondary nucleation arising from filament fragmentation. Finally, we study the dependence of the critical nucleus size on the repeat length of polyQ. We find that for the larger length polyglutamine chain that we study, the critical nucleus is a monomer, in agreement with experiment and in contrast to the case for the smaller chain, for which the smallest critical nucleus size is four.\n\nDysregulation of synaptic proteins, dendritic spine abnormalities and pathological plasticity of synapses as experience-dependent mediators of cognitive and psychiatric symptoms in Huntington's disease.\n\nPubMed\n\nNithianantharajah, J; Hannan, A J\n\n2013-10-22\n\nHuntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant tandem repeat expansion disorder involving cognitive, psychiatric and motor symptoms. The expanded trinucleotide (CAG) repeat leads to an extended polyglutamine tract in the huntingtin protein and a subsequent cascade of molecular and cellular pathogenesis. One of the key features of neuropathology, which has been shown to precede the eventual loss of neurons in the cerebral cortex, striatum and other areas, are changes to synapses, including the dendritic protrusions known as spines. In this review we will focus on synapse and spine pathology in HD, including molecular and experience-dependent aspects of pathogenesis. Dendritic spine pathology has been found in both the human HD brain at post mortem as well as various transgenic and knock-in animal models. These changes may help explain the symptoms in HD, and synaptopathy within the cerebral cortex may be particularly important in mediating the psychiatric and cognitive manifestations of this disease. The earliest stages of synaptic dysfunction in HD, as assayed in various mouse models, appears to involve changes in synaptic proteins and associated physiological abnormalities such as synaptic plasticity deficits. In mouse models, synaptic and cortical plasticity deficits have been directly correlated with the onset of cognitive deficits, implying a causal link. Furthermore, following the discovery that environmental enrichment can delay onset of affective, cognitive and motor deficits in HD transgenic mice, specific synaptic molecules shown to be dysregulated by the polyglutamine-induced toxicity were also found to be beneficially modulated by environmental stimulation. This identifies potential molecular targets for future therapeutic developments to treat this devastating disease. Copyright Â© 2012 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Paul\n\n2015-01-01\n\nRepeat expansion mutations cause at least 22 inherited neurological diseases. The complexity of repeat disease genetics and pathobiology has revealed unexpected shared themes and mechanistic pathways among the diseases, for example, RNA toxicity. Also, investigation of the polyglutamine diseases has identified post-translational modification as a key step in the pathogenic cascade, and has shown that the autophagy pathway plays an important role in the degradation of misfolded proteins â two themes likely to be relevant to the entire neurodegeneration field. Insights from repeat disease research are catalyzing new lines of study that should not only elucidate molecular mechanisms of disease, but also highlight opportunities for therapeutic intervention for these currently untreatable disorders.

Lawrence; Michels Thompson, Leslie\n\n2003-05-01\n\nThe formation of polyglutamine-containing aggregates and inclusions are hallmarks of pathogenesis in Huntington's disease that can be recapitulated in model systems. Although the contribution of inclusions to pathogenesis is unclear, cell-based assays can be used to screen for chemical compounds that affect aggregation and may provide therapeutic benefit. We have developed inducible PC12 cell-culture models to screen for loss of visible aggregates. To test the validity of this approach, compounds that inhibit aggregation in the PC12 cell-based screen were tested in a Drosophila model of polyglutamine-repeat disease. The disruption of aggregation in PC12 cells strongly correlates with suppression of neuronal degeneration in Drosophila. Thus, the engineered PC12 cells coupled with the Drosophila model provide a rapid and effective method to screen and validate compounds.\n\nArchitecture of polyglutamine-containing fibrils from time-resolved fluorescence decay.\n\nPubMed\n\nRÃ¶thlein, Christoph; Miettinen, Markus S; Bor"
