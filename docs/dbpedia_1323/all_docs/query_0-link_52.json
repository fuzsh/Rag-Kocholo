Osman, Amany Abo El- Nasr and Nashwa H. Abdullah\n\nBotany and Microbiology Department, Faculty of Science, Helwan University, Cairo, Egypt\n\namanyabonasr@yahoo.com\n\nAbstract: Lipases of Trichoderma viride were precipitated from the cultural medium with different methods. Acetone precipitation at 60% saturation point was the best one. The enzyme was partially purified by gel filtration chromatography using sephadex G-75. The enzyme was found to be of 25.2 KDa. The maximal activity has been obtained at high temperature (60⁰C) but the enzyme tolerates temperature up to 45⁰C. Also, it is characterized by its high stability and activity at the acidic pH values. The maximum activity has been maintained at pH 3 (49.1 unit/ml), with 80% residual activity. Also, it was stable with enhanced activity in the presence of bile salts (124% residual activity was maintained even after 45 min. incubation with 6 mM sodium cholate). Also, lipase enzyme showed nearly 100% residual activity in presence of trypsine enzyme. The enzyme has been tested for its ability in the management of pancreatic exocrine insufficiency using L-arginine induced acute pancreatitis mice models. The enzyme has the ability to decrease the weight loss and enhance fat digestion in this case. The total lipid level in serum after fat diet was enhanced from 837.99 mg/dl, in case of acute pancreatitis group without enzyme supplying, to 949.7 mg/dl, in case of acute pancreatitis group supplied with the enzyme, and a total weight gain of +0.21 gm body weight has been reported after the enzyme supplying for only 4 days.\n\n[Amani S.

Botany Department, Faculty of Science, Tanta University, 31527 Tanta, Egypt\n\nhanahmed29@hotmail.com\n\nAbstract: Seeds of five cowpea varieties, Kaha 1, Dokki 331, Azmerly, Cream 7 and Giza 6, were exposed to different doses of gamma radiation at50, 100, 200 and 300Gy. Some growth parameters and yield components were measured in 22 M2 genotypes. Variation in seed protein electrophoretic pattern, RAPD and ISSR fingerprinting was scored to assess genetic variation among the M2 genotypes. T he gamma dose of 50 Gy resulted in an increase of growth parameters and enhanced yield components in the three varieties Dokki 331, Azmerly and Cream 7; while the dose of 100 Gy resulted in higher growth rate and yield in var. Kaha 1 and var. Giza 6. Analysis of seed protein profile indicated specific bands for each variety; two bands appeared only in control plants and two other bands appeared inM2 plants of exposed seeds. Seven RAPD primers produced 30 polymorphic and 30 monomorphic bands. Meanwhile, 54 markers including 45 polymorphic bands were produced by the nine ISSR primers. Gamma radiation induced more genetic variation in the genotypes of var. Kaha 1 and var. Dokki 331 compared to other varieties, as estimated by the cluster analysis of seed protein, RAPD and ISSR markers.\n\n[Abdelfattah Badr, Hanan I.

Subjects and Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted, taking a representative random sample of patients who attended the emergency department of King Fahd Hospital in 2012. A checklist was completed using the file data in ED archive. This list contains socio-demographics, medical status, complaints, emergency level and outcome. The Canadian emergency department triage and acuity guidelines (CTAS) were used to assess the emergency level. Results: We analyzed 388 patients’ files, of which (82.7%) were adults, (71.9%) were Saudis and (69.1%) were male. Only (7.9%) of the patients arrived in ED by ambulance. Trauma and RTA were the main causes of attending ED (24.5%), followed by fever (12.4%) and GIT complaints (11.9%). Based on the CTAS classifications, (42.3%) of the patients were class V, (22.7%) class IV (less and non urgent), and only (3.1%) in class I (Resuscitation). Our study revealed that (22.7%) of the patients needed admission to hospital. Conclusion: Inappropriate utilization of the ED is a common practice in the Saudi community. Most of the patients come with minor self-limiting complaints. Concept of “fast track” units should be introduced in ED to ensure the expeditious management of low acuity patients.\n\n[Marwan A.

Its administration in a high dose causes hepatic toxicities and results in liver cell deaths by activating multiple stress pathways. Objectives: This study was conducted to investigate the effects of thymoquinone (TQ) on indomethacin-induced hepatotoxicity in rats. Study design: Male adult albino rats were divided into 4 groups: Group I: control non-treated group; the rats were treated orally with normal saline, Group II: TQ-treated (TQ) group; the rats were treated with TQ in the dose of 10 mg/kg/day orally, Group III: single high dose IND- treated (SHDI) group; the rats were treated with IND in the dose of 25 mg/kg once orally at the end of the duration of normal saline treatment, and Group IV: concomitant TQ- and IND- treated (CT/I) group; the rats were treated orally with TQ in the dose of 10 mg/kg/day, and then with IND in the dose of 25 mg/kg once at the end of TQ treatment. The treatment was for 4 weeks for all groups. At the end of the experiment, serum alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), albumin, total antioxidative capacity (TAC) were measured in all rats. Agarose gel electrophoresis for DNA (DNA analysis) for rat’s liver tissue was investigated also after sacrificing the rats. These parameters were expressed as the means of the effects ± SEM. Results: There were significant (P < 0.001) decrease in serum ALT and AST. and significant (P < 0.001) increase in serum TAC and DNA analysis between CT/I group and SHDI group. Albumin was not significantly changed (P > 0.05) between CT/I group and SHDI and control groups. Conclusion: These findings suggested that TQ is strong protective agent against IND-induced hepatotoxicity in rats. The collective data demonstrated that TQ has the potential to scavenge oxidants and decrease apoptotic changes and revealed a possible protective target mechanism for the damaging effects of IND on liver in rats.\n\n[Mohamed Abdelmohsen Abdallah and Mohamed Elsayed Kelany.

These effects could be explored by measuring body weight gain, feed efficiency ratio and relative weight of the liver. Serum levels of liver enzymes; aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP); albumin, total protein, total bilirubin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) enzyme and antioxidant enzymes; glutathione reductase (GR) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were determined. Methods: Thirty six male Wistar rats were allocated into six groups as follows: - Group1: negative (normal rats) control; Group 2: positive (hepatotoxic) control given dose of 75 mg/kg b.wt., of 2, 4- D for 4 weeks; Group 3: Positive (hepatotoxic) control given dose of 150 mg/kg b.wt., of 2, 4-D for 4 weeks; Groups 4: given orally Chamomile capitula extract in a dose of 500 mg/kg b.wt., alone. Groups 5 and 6: given combination of Chamomile capitula extract with either the accumulative doses of the 75 mg/kg b.wt, or the 150 mg/kg b.wt., of 2, 4-D for 4 weeks. Results: The results showed that oral administration of Chamomile capitula extract to hepatotoxic rats for 28 days significantly decreased the elevated serum levels of liver enzymes (AST, ALT and ALP), total bilirubin and lactate dehydrogenase enzyme and positive groups. Levels of antioxidant enzymes glutathione reductase and superoxide dismutase were significantly increased as compared to the control positive groups. Conclusion: The results suggest that Chamomile capitula aqueous extract induces potent hepatoprotective and antioxidant effects in 2, 4 D - hepatotoxic rats. This study recommends that intake of Chamomile capitula extract as a herbal tea may be beneficial for patients who suffer from liver diseases and oxidative stress antioxidant enzymes.\n\n[Dalal A.A.

A. Al-Taisan\n\nDepartment of Biology, College of Science, University of Dammam, P.O. Box 838, Dammam 31113, Saudi Arabia.\n\nWaltaisan@ud.edu.sa\n\nAbstract: In the present study an attempt has been made to investigate the potential allelopathic effects at different concentrations (0, 10, 25, 50 and 75%) of water extract of roots and leaves of Heliotropium bacciferum Forssk. on seed germination, seedling growth and biochemical constituents changes Oryza sativa L and medical plants Teucrium polium L. The results showed that the roots and leaves extracts of H. bacciferum caused a general phytotoxic effect on seed germination and seedling growth of O. sativa and T. polium at all concentrations. It was noticed that the germination in both tested plants was delayed for one and two days at the highest levels of extract (50 and 75%). The degree of seed germination inhibition was higher in leaf extract more than root extract of heliotrope plants. Also, O. sativa seeds were more affected at different extract concentration than T. polium. With respect to the internal metabolites, a gradual increase in the proline content, decrease in the chlorophyll content and consequently the soluble sugar content is proportional to the increase the concentrations of water extract of roots and leaves of heliotrope. Aqueous extract of heliotrope leaves induced more inhibitory effects than aqueous extract of heliotrope roots. A greater inhibitory effect was observed on T. polium as compared with O. sativa. Consequently, the aqueous extracts from H. bacciferum have allelopathic potential and should be evaluated as an allelopathic species, presenting arisk to seed germination and seedling growth of crops or weeds.\n\n[Wafa'a A Al-Taisan.

In recent years natriuretic peptides have become promising candidates in the early detection of cardiovascular disease (CVD) such as heart failure. In end stage renal disease (ESRD) patients, the clinical benefit of N-terminal probrain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) measurements has not been well established. Aim of the study: Is to evaluate the role of serum NT-proBNP levels in diagnoses and to detect the progression of left ventricular dysfunction and left ventricular mass in a sizable cohort of stable patients on chronic HD without clinical signs of progressive heart failure. Patients and methods: This study was conducted on 100 persons, 55 were known as ESRD patients on regular conventional hemodialysis (HD) [Dialysis group] and 25 patients with chronic kidney disease(CKD) not on HD [CKD group] in addition to 20 healthy volunteers [control group]. All participants were thoroughly interrogated and examined clinically and were subjected to plasma NT-proBNP level and transthoracic echocardiography at baseline and after six months. Results: Mean NT-proBNP showed significantly higher mean in dialysis group (252.88 ±125.193 fmol/ml) compared to the CKD group(168.266 ±134.881 fmol/ml[P=0.007], and the control group(9.075±6.707fmol/ml)[P<0.001].There was a significant strong inverse correlation between NT-proBNP and ejection fraction(EF) (P<0.001). There was also a strong positive correlation between NT-proBNP and change of EF over six months (∆ EF) (P<0.001). Also there was a significant strong positive correlation between NT-proBNP and left ventricular mass (LVM) & LVM index(LVMI) and change of LVM & LVMI over six months (∆ LVM) (P<0.001). Conclusion: The study recommended that plasma NT-proBNP assessment is an easy non invasive test and should be monitored in HD patients owing to its close relation to LVM, systolic dysfunction and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in this population. Rising NT-proBNP levels may reflect worsening ventricular stress and may help earlier diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.\n\n[Emam Waked, Emad Abdallah, Ashraf Abd El-Khalik, Malak Nabil and Faten El-Shanawani.

It also enables hospitals to record and store the data for people who want to communicate with them, and it also provides a centralized blood bank database. The system is developed by using HTML, PHP, and MySQL as a database system to manage and store the data. The Waterfall Methodology, which is the traditional version and the classic approach of a system development life cycle, is used to develop and build the web-based blood bank. The system targets three types of user: the public who wants to donate blood, the recipients who need the donated blood, and the hospitals who that work as an intermediary to manage the communication between the donors and recipients. The main objectives for developing the website is to educate the community on the benefits of blood donation, develop a Web-Based Blood Bank System to manage the records of donors and recipients, and encourage voluntary blood donation, easily accessing any information about blood type and the distribution of the blood in various hospitals in Jeddah, based on the hospital needs.\n\n[Hisham S, Al-Madani A, Al-Amri A, Al-Ghamdi A, Bashamakh B, Aljojo N.

Histological alterations were recorded and evaluated semi-quantitatively based on the liver lesion categories and their severities. According to the results, five of a total of forty samples displayed normal (healthy) liver architecture, but the others displayed various histopathological alterations, including hepatocyte vacuolization, fatty degeneration, increase in melanomacrophage centers, necrosis, infiltration, congestion, fibrosis, single cell necrosis, bile duct alterations, glycogen depletion and nuclear pleomorphism. Liver index values were calculated and found to be changed between 2 and 50 (≤4 for fish with normal livers (FwNL) and ≥8-50 for fish with histopathological livers (FwHL). We also investigated oxidative stress biomarkers, lipid peroxidation (LPO) and antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT)) in FwHL as compared with FwNL. LPO and CAT were found to be significantly higher in FwHL, indicating increased oxidative stress. The results revealed that the observed histological and biochemical alterations in the livers of C. tarichi reflect the effects of environmental stressors present in the lake water causing pollution.\n\n[Kaptaner B, Kankaya E, Doğan A, Çelik İ.

Medicinal plants have recently received the greatest attention to find naturally occurring substances with therapeutic value. Coriandrum sativum, Crocus sativus and Nerium oleander were collected, dried and extracted with methanol, ethanol, n-butanol, chloroform, ethyl acetate or water. The obtained extracts were assessed for antibacterial activity against Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The methanolic extracts were the most active, thus they were screened for their antimicrobial activity against some different genera of bacteria using agar well diffusion method. The tested bacteria included resistant bacteria to one or more antibiotics. The obtained extracts exhibited considerable inhibitory effects against all the tested bacteria and the less inhibited bacterium was Salmonella. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of the methanol extracts ranged from 50-100 µg/ml. No toxicity for C. sativum, C. sativus was found using Artimia salina as test organism whereas acute toxicity was recorded for N. oleander. The extract of C. sativus showed excellent antitumor activity against Ehrlich ascites carcinoma.\n\n[Samyah D. Jastaniah.

Genotypes Using RAPD Markers\n\nM. S. Mia1, A. K. Patwary1, L. Hassan1, M. M. Hasan2, Md. Amirul Alam2, M. A. Latif2, M. Monjurul Alam Mondal2 and Adam B. Puteh2*\n\n* Corresponding author: adam@upm.edu.my\n\nAbstract: Ginger (Zingiber officinale Roscoe.) is an important spice crop in Bangladesh as well as in all over the world for its economical and medicinal values. A measure of the existing genetic diversity is essential for planning a meaningful breeding strategy. Moreover, assessment and characterization of genetic diversity of the available germplasm is important to know the source of gene for particular trait of interest. The present investigation was undertaken to assess the genetic diversity among eight ginger genotypes using RAPD markers. A total of 16 distinct DNA fragments ranging from 100–1000 bp were amplified by using three selected primers of which 10 (62.50%) were polymorphic. BARI ada-1 was more homogenous than others and Syedpuri was found less homogenous showing the low intra-variety similarity value (75.56). the genotype ‘Syedpuri’ was found as more diversified from the viewpoint of lowest intra-variety similarity index value, highest gene diversity, proportion of polymorphic loci and highest level of genetic variation. The cluster analysis indicated that the eight genotypes were grouped into two major clusters. ‘Indian’ alone formed the first major cluster while the second major cluster had seven genotypes and was divided into two minor clusters. China and Sherpuri genotype pair was very close to each other with the lowest genetic distance (0.03). On the other hand, Indian and Syedpuri pair was more distant to each other with the highest genetic distance (0.55). RAPD analysis revealed a considerable level of polymorphism among the studied genotypes. The genetic variation thus detected has significance for ginger improvement programs.\n\n[Mia MS, Patwary AK, Hassan L, Hasan MM, Alam, MA, Latif MA, Alam MM, Puteh AB.

It is affected by numerous factors, including age, dietary factors, lack of exercise, menopause, underweight, excessive alcohol consumption and cigarette smoking. The aim of the present study is to investigate the influence of cigarette smoking on Bone mineral Density (BMD) and examine the relation between cigarette smoking and vitamin D among men. A total of ninety-six males, aged between 32–50 years, were recruited and divided into 4 groups according to their smoking status: non smoker (n=26), light smoker (n=18), moderate smoker (n=26) and heavy smoker (n=26). Participants visited the Center of Excellence for Osteoporosis Research (CEOR) at King Abdul Aziz University and completed a questionnaire about medical history, lifestyle and smoking habits. Written informed consent was obtained from all participating men. Bone density was measured using dual-energy X ray absorptiometry (DXA) at three sites, the lumbar spine (L1-L4), femur neck and total hip. Serum Ca, PO4, Mg, iPTH, 25-OHD3, OC and CTx were measured. We found that bone mineral density at femur neck was significantly lower in light and heavy smoker groups compared to non smoker group (P< 0.05). BMD were positively correlated with body mass index (P<0.01) and waist to hip ratio (P<0.01) in heavy smoker group and negatively correlate with number of years smoked (P< 0.05). Nearly 69% of our study population had low serum 25-OHD levels (<25nmol/L). In the heavy smoker group, 80% had vitamin D deficiency (<25 nmol/L) compared with 46% in the non-smoker group. There were a significant negative correlation between serum 25-OHD and number of cigarettes smoked daily (P< 0.05) and PTH level (p<0.01) in heavy smoker group. Smoking was associated with reduced BMD in the heavy smoker group and the smoking duration (years) had a stronger effect on BMD than the number of cigarettes smoked daily.\n\n[S.

BR 21) and field water quality. The experiment was laid out in a Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD) with three replications. The treatments were T1: Control (no fertilizer), T2: (165 kg N ha-1 from prilled urea), T3: (119 kg N ha-1 from USG), T4: (82 kg N ha-1 from prilled urea + 3 t ha-1 poultry manure) and T5: (56 kg N ha-1 from USG + 3 t ha-1 poultry manure). The highest grain (3.19 tha-1) and straw yields (4.51tha-1) were obtained from treatment T5 (56 kg N ha-1 USG + 3.0 t ha-1 poultry manure) while the lowest grain (1.99 tha-1) and straw yield (3.38 tha-1) were recorded for T1 (control). Treatment T3 (119 kg N ha-1 from USG) performed better than T2 and T4 indicating the superior effect of USG over prilled urea. The N, P, K and S contents in the grain and straw and their total uptake were influenced profoundly due to application of PU, USG alone or in combination with poultry manure. In case of rice field water quality, the USG generated available NH4-N slowly but spontaneously over the entire growth period compared to prilled urea indicating a beneficial role of USG. The other properties of field water like pH, EC were also influenced by the application of prilled urea, USG and poultry manure. The overall results indicate that application of USG in combination with poultry manure was more effective in producing higher rice yield and at the same time reduce water pollution.\n\n[Nusrat Jahan, Md.

The experiment was carried out with four aromatic fine rice varieties (V1= BRRI dhan34, V2= Ukunimadhu, V3= Basmati and V4= Kataribhog) and four different number of seedling hill-1 (N1= one number of seedling hill-1, N2= two number of seedling hill-1, N3= three number of seedling hill-1 and N4= four number of seedling hill-1). The experiment was laid out in split-plot design with three replications assigning variety in the main plot and the four different number of seedling hill-1in the sub plot. Experimental result showed that aromatic fine rice varieties and number of seedling hill-1 individually had significant effect on the agronomic parameters except number of non-effective tiller hill-1, number of unfilled spikelets panicle-1, 1000-grain wt (g). The highest grain yield (2.32 t ha-1) was obtained in Kataribhog, which, was similar to Basmati (2.31 t ha-1) followed by Ukunimadhu. The highest grain yield was (2.31 t ha-1) with two number of seedling hill-1 which was statistically similar to three number of seedling hill-1 (1.96 t ha-1) but different from single number of seedling hill-1 and four number of seedling hill-1.The lowest grain yield were with one and four number of seedling hill-1 but straw yield (5.00 t ha-1) was significeantly higher with four number of seedling hill-1. Combined effect showed that two number of seedling hill-1 produced highest grain yield by all the variety. In later of number of four seedling hill-1 production of grain yield was decreased. BRRI dhan34, Ukunimadhu, Basmati and Kataribhog with two number of seedling hill-1 can be suggested in rainfed condition of Bangladesh.\n\n[M. S. Islam, M.A. R. Sarkar, M. J. Alam, M. A. Kashem, M.Y.

Methods: By means of observing the treatment of 72 patients with secondary epilepsy, we analyzed the significance of intraoperative ECoG monitoring in the treatment of secondary epilepsy. Among the 72 cases, 15 patients were meningiomas, 28 were gliomas, 15 were cavernous hemangiomas, 5 were arachnoid cysts, 5 were post-traumatic changes, 2 were cholesteatomas and 2 were arteriovenous malformations. Results: There was no epileptic wave in all the studied patients revealed by the regular postoperative EEG. No death or new neurological dysfunctions were recorded following the surgeries. A follow-up investigation lasting from 1to 5 years revealed that there was no epilepsy recurrence in all the patients except for partial seizures in two patients. Conclusion: The monitoring of electrocorticography (ECoG) would significantly improve the efficiency of surgical management for the patients with secondary epilepsy.\n\n[Jun Xiang, Yugang Jiang.

K-means clustering algorithms have some shortfalls and defects, and one defect is reviewed in this study. One of the disadvantages of k-means clustering algorithms is that they can produce clusters that do not always include all the correct components. It is due to the presence of the error rate during the clustering process. The purpose of this research was to decrease error rates in the k-means clustering algorithm and to reduce iteration of running this algorithm. A novel method is proposed to calculate the distance between cluster members and cluster center. Toevaluatethe algorithm proposed in this study, seven well-knowndata sets consisting of Balance, Blood, Breast, Glass, Iris, Pima and Wine data sets were used. This investigation revealed that the performance of K-means algorithms was increased and resulted in valid clusters and that it reduced error rates, run time and iteration.\n\n[Yousef Farhang, Siti Mariyam Hj.

This novel method is well known for its ability to preserves the orientation and magnitude of EEG sensors and signals. However, this preservation renders Flat EEG to contain unwanted signals captured during recording from the surroundings. Consequently, its accuracy in depicting actual electrical activity inside the brain is affected. Present of artifacts would pose a serious problem if it is large. Thusly, this study will investigate the persistence of Flat EEG to surrounding “noises” from dynamic viewpoint by means of structural stability. Basically, it will be showed that Flat EEG in the presence of “noises” may still reflects the actual electrical activity inside the brain, if the contaminated Flat EEG falls within a class of dynamical systems.\n\n[Tahir A. and Tan LK.

Anidolic Daylighting System (ADS) is a type of daylighting system that provides daylight in areas far from windows. This device concentrates daylight in a collector and transfers it to duct situated between collector and distributor, which then spreads this daylight to the inside of the building. The aim of this research is to determine optimum Anidolic duct shape and width which increases daylight illuminance into the interior of office buildings. The simulation model was designed in Integrated Environmental Solution IES<VE> software to perform daylight simulation experiments. Therefore, three configurations of designed duct shape with two duct lengths (12 and 20 meters) were simulated as duct shape variables. Three different duct width sizes were also evaluated. Results indicated that a rectangular shaped Anidolic with three meter duct width offers higher illuminance than the other simulated cases. For future study, other parameters can be carried out such as depth of duct, size of anidolic, collector and distributor of device.\n\n[Roshan M, Kandar MZ, Najafpour H, Ossen DR, Ghasemi M, Gharakhani A, Torabi M.

The special attention is paid to the role of the information, communication and innovation factors in these processes. To solve the objective of a quantitative estimation of the RSES sustainability the methodology of the calculation of the general integral index in the context of the following blocks was selected: 1) economic relations; 2) the social situation; 3) the institutional environment; 4) the innovative potential. The formation of the index was made on the basis of the methodology of the calculation of the HDI UNDP. The data of the statistical collections “Regions of Russia. Socio-Economic Indicators” for the period from 2003 till 2012 were used as the information source of the calculations. The selection includes 80 subjects of the Russian Federation. The data processing was performed with the help of the Microsoft Excel programme analysis package. The international practice and the frame of the multivariative correlation and regression analysis were used at the selection of the indicators for the calculation of the subscripts included in the general integral index of sustainability. The integral indexes of the sustainability for 80 subjects of the Russian Federation for the period from 2003 till 2012 were calculated according to the suggested methodology. The estimation of the received results has allowed drawing a conclusion that the sustainable development of the majority of the Russian regions has increased during the analyzed period. Also it is established, that the greatest contribution to process of the development was made by the economic (the average partial coefficient was 0.445) and institutional components (0.402); the low level of a social subsystem development (0.260) and the innovative activity (0.032) were noted.\n\n[Anna Chub.

With the use of words \"absorption\", \"violent capture\" and \"colonization\", the modern estimation has another point. A period of the emotional beginning in learning concrete historical events, which is typical for alteration years, when most of the people were deeply interested only by their own past, history, is departed. Today has come the time of sound scientific searches. Especially in the direction of objective and independent study of difficult pages of national history and delivering from vices of the former general allied history. \"We must achieve, by learning justify,\" -considered the academician M.K.Kozibaev,-lessons to domestic history, to dethrone present myths, attain truth.

The post-Soviet cultural practices of preservation of ethnic identity of the small-numbered peoples of Siberia—the Kumandins and the Dolgans —are studied. The conclusion is made that there is not any state language policy aimed at preserving of the Kumandin language and Dolgan language. The Kumandins and the Dolgans have active processes of ethnic identification, but the post-Soviet cultural practices do not relate to these processes. Processes of ethnic and linguistic assimilation are accompanied by post-Soviet practices, where state policy does not increase and does not weaken the ethnic identity of the indigenous peoples of Central Siberia. In present time are developed and strengthened social stratum “national elites”, which are characterized by symbolic ethnicity. For modern ethnicity processes of Indigenous Peoples of Central Siberia are characterized by dual ethnic identity.\n\n[Koptseva NP, Kirko VI.

Firstly, this method extracts a background image from the video frames using the mode statistical method, wherein the background will be subtracted from subsequent frames to distinguish the foreground objects by using the background subtraction method. Secondly, the morphological binary dilation and erosion operations are used to refine the boundaries and the regions of the detected moving vehicles (foregrounds), and unwanted small objects will be removed from the background respectively. Finally, we adopt the concept of a switch electric circuit design SPST (Single-Pole Single-Throw) as a new method to detect and count the moving vehicles. Performance evaluation of the experimental results is encouraging in that it shows that the proposed detection method has an average precision of more than 0.92, an average recall of more than 0.97, an average f-measure of more than 0.94 and average accuracy of more than 0.99.\n\n[Hadi R A, Sulong G, George L E.An Innovative Vehicle Detection Approach Based on Background Subtraction and Morphological Binary Methods.Life Sci J2014;11(8):230-238].

Ginger extract has been used as an antioxidant and preventive agent against a number of diseases. Aim of the Work: This work aimed to study the possible histological and ultrastructural changes of liver induced by diclofenac treatment and to evaluate the possible protective effect of ginger extract. Materials and Methods: Forty adult male albino rats were divided into 4 main groups. Group I: served as control. Group II: received ginger extract orally in a dose of 250 mg/kg /day. Group III: animals received diclofenac intramuscularly at a dose 150 mg/kg /day. Groups IV: animals received ginger extract then diclofenac after two hours in the previous doses. The treatments were given for rats for 7 days, then, rats were sacrificed by ether anesthesia and specimens from liver were taken for light and electron microscopic examination. Results: Light microscopic examination of the liver treated with diclofenac revealed disorganized hepatic architecture. The affected lobules appeared with dilated congested central veins and blood sinusoids, vacuolated hepatocytes with dark nuclei, cellular infilteration and fibrosis. Ultrastructurally, hepatocytes showed disintegration of cellular organelles, destructed mitochondria and pyknotic nuclei. Coadministration of diclofenac with ginger extract showed a slight improvement in some hepatocytes that looked normal in both LM and EM examination but still others were markedly affected and showing signs of degeneration. Conclusion: Results obtained in this study demonstrated that high doses of diclofenac induced histological and ultrastructural changes in the liver due to oxidative stress and the use of ginger extract had partially improved the toxic effect of diclofenac.\n\n[Eman A.

Berberis pseudumbellata subsp. gilgitica is endemic to the area and has become critically endangered. For the first time research documented unique epigenetic behaviour of different mountain wildlife and zoopharmacological practices of traditional communities from CKNP. When wildlife gets physical hurts, it rushes towards Berberis plants and eat berries, chew leaves or bark, which is found significant (p<0.001). Such behaviour is untaught, not learned, and automatic but seems pre-programmed instinctively triggered reflexed. This is observed in avifauna (House Sparrow, Chakor, Ram Chakor) and angulates (Flare horned Markhor, Himalayan Ibex) only. 79.03%, 36.51% hunters (SD±30.02), 83.24%, 58.23% shepherds (SD±17.68) and 41.92%, 17.11% local population (SD±17.54) believe and have personal observations respectively for Berberis-wildpharma interaction. Traditionally it is used zoopharmacologically for bone healing of limbs (93.67%), other bone fracture and injury (90.91%), other internal injuries (85.53%), external injuries (73.33%), delivery of sheep (38.12%), goat (17.36%) and cow (19.87%).

This is due to their ability to produce proteinacous antimicrobial agents, lactic acid and diacetyle. The prime objective of this work was to select a probiotic bacterium which could be used as protective culture. Characterization of bacteriocin by physicochemical techniques and inhibition of food-borne pathogens were carried out. Molecular methods were used for identification of bacterial strains used. Out of 100 lactic acid bacterial strains, the most inhibitory strain (Z55 strain) isolated from Arabian yoghurt (Zabady) inhibited other lactic and bacteria and some food-borne pathogens. This Z55 strain was identified as Lactobacillus delbreukii subspecies bulgaricus and designated Lb. bulgaricus Z55. The inhibitory activity of cell free supernatant (CFS) of Lb. bulgaricus Z55 was lost by proteolytic enzymes, heat resistant. Consequently it was characterized as a bacteriocin. This bacteriocin was shown to consists of protein but has no lipidic or glucidic moieties in its active molecule. Its activity was stable in the pH range 2.0 to 7.0. Maximum bacteriocin production was obtained in MRS broth adjusted initially at pH 6.5 and incubated for 18 h at 350C when the producer organism was in the late logarithmic and early stationary phase of growth. A bacteriocin producer strain (Lb. bulgaricus Z55) inhibited many food-borne pathogens. The antimicrobial agent was showed to be protein and characterized as a bacteriocin\n\n[Seham Abdel-Shafi, Abdul-Raouf Al-Mohammadi, Sally Negm and Gamal Enan.

At pH 6.0 and 60% ammonium sulphate saturation, the precipitated pellets contained maximal plantaricin UG1 activity of about 22880 AU/ml. Some dissociating agents dissociated plantaricin UG1 activity, thereby releasing more active subunits. The bacteriocin plantaricin UG1 existed in ammonium sulphate pellets was dialysed against potassium phosphate buffer pH 6.5 and was easily purified using chromatographic separation. Purified plantaricin UG1 activity showed 54.69 fold -increase than that obtained in cell free supernatant (CFS). The purity of plantaricin UG1 was judged by SDS-PAGE which resolved a 3.7 KDa and 1.8 KDa protein bands; indicating that plantaricin UG1 is two polypeptides. Consequently it is another bacteriocin within class 11 b bacteriocins. Amino acid composition of plantaricin UG1 showed 29 to 31 amino acids. Amino acid sequence of plantaricin UG1 showed a double glycine leader and proved that it is a novel variant of plantaricins.\n\n[Sahar M. Ouda, Johan Debevere and Gamal Enan.

It is still obscure whether the stress from movement inabilities after stroke influences the intestinal barrier functions. We therefore assessed the intestinal mucosal changes in a post-stroke rat model under the restraint stress, which simulated movement restriction in post-stroke patients. Methods Male SD rats in stroke group (M) and post-stroke restraint group (MS) received permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) operation to establish a stroke rat model, rats in post-stroke restraint group (MS) were restrained in fixator 24 hours later after MCAO operation. The rats in sham-operated restraint group (JS) received restraint only after sham operation. Serum corticotrophin releasing factor(CRF), D-lactate (D-Lac), endotoxin (LPS) and diamine oxidase (DAO) level were evaluated by ELISA assay; Terminal ileum tissue tight junction proteins ZO-1, occludin, claudin-1, claudin-2, claudin-3 and claudin-4 level were analyzed by western blotting; Terminal ileum tissue CRF, CRF-r1, CRF-r2 and brain tissue TNF-α, CRP, CRF expression level were investigated by immunohistochemistry. Results As compared with sham group (J), peripheral blood serum D - Lac, DAO, LPS, CRF levels increased (all P<0.05), TNF-α, CRP, CRF expression levels in the central nervous system were also significantly increased (P<0.01), while the claudin, ZO-1, claudin-1, claudin-2 levels in the intestinal mucosa decreased significantly (all P<0.01) in post-stroke restraint group (MS), stroke group(M) and sham-operated restraint group (JS). Peripheral blood serum DAO, LPS, CRF levels in post-stroke restraint group (MS) were increased compared with stroke group (M) (all P＜0.05). The ZO-1, claudin-1, claudin-2 levels in intestinal mucosa were decreased compared with stroke group (M) (all P＜0.01), while claudin-3 claudin-4 levels were increased compared with stroke group (M) (all P＜0.01). Terminal ileum tissue CRF-r1 expression levels in post-stroke restraint group (MS) was increased compared with stroke group (M) (P<0.05), while CRF-r2 expression level was no significant difference in this two groups (P>0.05).

Flaxseed oil (FXO) is marketed as a nutritional supplement. It contains linolenic acid poly unsaturated fatty acid (omega-3- PUFA), that have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory effects and many beneficial health effects. Coenzyme Q10 (Co Q10) has gained considerable attention as a dietary supplement capable of influencing cellular bioenergetics, antioxidants and as a supplementary treatment for some chronic diseases. The present study is an effort aimed to investigate the possible protective influence of FXO and Co Q10 on renal genomic instability induced by aspartame. Adult male rats were divided into 4 groups (n=6), animals of group 1 (control) had free access to water and food materials. Group 2 (ASP) was daily administered orally Ad libitum drinking water containing 0.25 g/L aspartame. Group 3 (ASP+ FXO) was daily administered diet contains 15% FXO in combination with aspartame. Group 4 (ASP+ CoQ10) was daily administered diet contains 500 mg CQ10/kg diet in combination with aspartame till the end of the experiment after 60 days. Our results revealed that, oral administration of aspartame significantly increased serum urea, BUN, Creatinine, potassium levels and decreased sodium level. Also Our results showed that renal GSH level, GSH-Px, GSH-R, G6PDH, SOD activities and DNA, RNA, zinc content were significantly decreased. While the levels of H2O2, NO, TNF- α and percentage of DNA fragmentation were significantly increased comparing with normal control group. Oral administration of FXO and CoQ 10 along with aspartame ameliorated serum and renal alterations. Our data suggesting that the FXO and CoQ10 have the potential to protect against renal genomic instability and renal dysfunction induced by aspartame with the primary role for CoQ 10 that can restore all alterations to normal values.\n\n[Hoda I.

The city center of Kuala Lumpur (KLCC) was chosen as a case study because this area faces these challenges. In this study, the relationship between geometry and legibility was reviewed using two models that were created base on the literature. The two models were an existing vicinity of KLCC and a hypothetical model that analyzed by Space Syntax. The results were further analyzed using a T-test and the correlations were examined using SPSS. Enhanced integration as a result accessibility was observed. There was also a strong correlation between integration and connectivity in the hypothetical model. According to this simulation study, regular geometry can increase integration, accessibility, intelligibility and legibility in urban spaces.\n\n[Sharifah Salwa Syed Mahdzar, Hossein Safari.

Chromosomal and genetic abnormalities in the child and high levels of homocysteine in the blood are some of the risk factors related to CHD. Several studies in various populations have been done to determine the candidate genes in the predisposition to CHD with contradictory results, but there have been no studies that had been found in Malaysian CHD patients on homocysteine gene polymorphisms. Hence, this study was conducted to determine the allelic and genotypic analysis of the polymorphisms in candidate genes of the homocysteine enzymes; Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (MTHFR), Cystathionine-b-synthase(CBS), Methionine Synthase(MTR) and Methionine Synthase Reductase (MTRR) genes. Based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria, buccal or blood samples were collected from 150 Malaysian non-syndromic CHD patients and 150 samples from healthy subjects as controls with no matching of age, genders and race between cases and controls. Genomic DNA was extracted from the samples using commercially available kits and the genotyping analysis for C677T MTHFR, A1298C MTHFR, A66G MTRR, A2756G MTR and 844ins68 CBS gene polymorphisms were analyzed using PCR-RFLP analysis. There was a significant difference observed in MTHFR A1298C gene polymorphism between cases and controls (P=0.008). However, there was no significant difference was observed for MTHFR C677T, MTRR A66G, MTR A2756G and CBS 844ins68 gene polymorphism. The association of MTHFR A1298C with the development of CHD in this study emphasis the role of MTHFR gene in the pathogenesis of non-syndromic CHD in Malaysian subjects.\n\n[Nur Afiqah Mohamad, RamachandranVasudevan, Patimah Ismail, Nur Ilyana Jafar, Ahmad Fazli Abdul Aziz, Nora Fawzi Kadhim Al-Shawee, Mazeni Alwi.

Water, methanol, ethyl acetate and diluted acetone extracts of natural and colored J. regia barks were screened for in vitro activity against vaginal Candida strains. These plants were selected due to their traditional use for the treatment of fungal infections. Plant preparations were screened for antifungal activity using a standard agar disc diffusion assay. Following study of the antifungal activity of plant extracts, their minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimal fungicidal concentration (MFC) values were determined using broth microdilution assay. Several antioxydant properties of this plant were tested such as total phenolic content and determination of reducing power. Among the four J. regia L. extracts (for natural and colored bark), methanolic extract of natural bark had the best antifungal activity against all vaginal Candida strains. The most important MICs and MFCs values of the methanol extract were obtained for the majority of the vaginal Candida isolates (MIC = 0.012 mg/ ml and MFC = 0.024 mg/ml) as compared to amphotericin B (MIC = 0.097 mg / ml and MFC: 0.78 mg/ml). This study reveals that the antioxidant activity of “Swak” extract was more important for natural bark than the treated bark. This plant can contain compounds with therapeutic potential against vaginal Candida strains and, hence, their possible use as therapeutic agents.\n\n[Emira Noumi, Mejdi Snoussi, Inès Noumi, Eulogio Valentin, Mahjoub Aouni and Abdulbasit Al-sieni.

Most authors agree that although anyone may experience stress, the highest incidence is found among caregivers or professionals responsible for the development of other people, such as physicians, nurses, teachers, social workers and psychologist. The nursing staff suffers the total, concentrated and immediate impact of stress deriving from patient’s care. Nurse job satisfaction is a multidimensional phenomenon that is influenced by many variables, stress has been identified as the strongest predictor of nurse job satisfaction, which in turn reflects positively or negatively on nurse retention. This study aimed to investigate the presence of work related stress and its impact on nurses’ job satisfaction. One hundred female nurses were recruited, 60 working in ICU of both adult and pediatrics at King Saud Medical Complex, and 40 working in labor room at Al-Yamamah maternity hospital. Tools for data collection include: Interview questionnaire, Nursing Stress Scale (NSS Gray –Toft & Anderson, 1981) which was 34 items scale used to measure any situations perceived by the participants as threatening because of mismatch between the situation demands and the individuals coping abilities. The Job Satisfaction Survey (JSS).JSS, was 36 items, nine facet scales to assess employee attitudes about the job and aspects of the job. Each facet is assessed with four items, and a total score is computed from all items. Results of this study revealed that near half of the subjects (49%) perceived frequently stress, while only 7% perceived extremely stress. Also results revealed that, 47% of the subjects were ambivalent in their response to job satisfaction and 35% were satisfied. A significant positive relation between level of perceived stress and level of job satisfaction were found in this study (p=0,009).This study recommended another informative study to include another departments in a multi dimensional settings of health care and also recommended that the organizations that employ nurses should implement programs to monitor and manage stress especially regarding staff issues and job demands.\n\n[Essmat Mansour; Nabila Taha; Maha El-Araby and Hanan Younes.
