        "text": "With near perfect weather conditions for the first time in years, the New York City Marathon produced a series of startling developments yesterday, starting with an unexpected winner who ran alone and unchallenged the last 13 miles and the highest finishes by Americans in seven years.\n\nThe 26-mile-385-yard race through the five boroughs of the city was not entirely without predictable moments: Ingrid Kristiansen of Norway easily finished first among women. But few figured on Juma Ikangaa of Tanzania claiming the $26,385 first prize and a $35,000 Mercedes Benz; fewer still figured on a time of 2 hours 8 minutes 1 second to lower Alberto Salazar's eight-year-old course record by 12 seconds.\n\nA world-class runner since the early 1980's, Ikangaa has had difficulty in recent years winning big races. In three of his last four marathons, he was the runner-up, once by just one second. But this was his big marathon breakthrough - his first victory since 1986, his first victory in the United States, and confirmation that his decision to train for the race at altitude in Alamosa, Colo., was well-reasoned. His time was also the fastest in the world this year, the 10th-fastest on record and his sixth effort under 2:08.\n\nIf all that sounds a little ambitious, have a look at Ken Martin's day. With American marathoning efforts flagging in recent years, he finished second in 2:09:38, the fastest performance by an American in nearly six years, the 10th-fastest by an American ever and the best finish by an American in New York since Salazar won in 1982.\n\nKim Jones of Spokane, Wash., matched Martin on that score. Her second place finish in 2:27:54 behind Kristiansen's time of 2:25:30 was the best by an American woman since Julie Brown was runner-up to Grete Waitz, also in 1982.\n\nThe performances by Ikangaa and Martin seemed all the more impressive by the fact they beat one of the deepest men's fields ever assembled in New York. Among more than 24,996 starters who ran an under cloudy skies with temperatures in the 50's were Gelindo Bordin of Italy, the 1988 Olympic champion who was third in 2:09:40; Steve Jones of England, the defending champion who was eighth, in 2:12:58; and Belayneh Densimo, the Ethiopian with the fastest time on record. He was ninth.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
