        "text": "Gelindo Bordin of Italy, trying to become the first Olympic men's champion to win the Boston Marathon, passed Juma Ikangaa and took the lead with about six miles left in today's race.\n\nIkangaa of Tanzania, runner-up the last two years, had broken away from Ibrahim Hussein and Kipkemboi Kimeli, both of Kenya, and opened up a large lead at about the 17-mile mark of the 26.2-mile race.At 20 miles, Ikangaa's time of 1:36:53 left him about 100 yards ahead of Bordin, the 1988 marathon winner at the Olympics. But soon after, Bordin overtook Ikangaa, the world's top-ranked marathoner last year when he won the New York Marathon.\n\nBordin took the lead 1:41:19 into the race and stretched it out into a sizable advantage.\n\nIn 1988, Hussein overtook Ikangaa in the stretch for a one-second victory, the closest in the race's history. Abebe Mekonnen of Ethiopia beat Ikangaa by 1:03 last year.\n\nAfter 15 miles under cloudless skies with temperatures in the low 60s, Ikangaa had a slim lead over Hussein and Kimeli in a time of 1:11:15.\n\nWhen Rob de Castella of Australia set the course record of 2 hours, 7 minutes, 51 seconds in 1986, he ran the first 15 miles in 1:12:43.\n\nIkangaa also led at 10 miles.\n\nRosa Mota of Portugal, winner in Boston in 1987 and 1988, had a comfortable lead in the women's competition.\n\nMustapha Badid of France won the wheelchair competition in a record time of 1:29:53. The old mark was 1:36:04, set by Philippe Couprie of France in winning at Boston last year. He was third today in 1:32:15. Franz Nietlispach of Switzerland was second in 1:31:31.\n\nA record official field of 9,362 left the starting line at noon in the town of Hopkinton, west of Boston.\n\nThe warmth wasn't ideal for beating the current world marathoning best of 2 hours, 6 minutes, 50 seconds. Belayneh Densimo of Ethiopia ran that at Rotterdam in 1988.\n\nAny world best will not be considered an official marathoning record by the governing body of the sport in the United States. The Athletics Congress has passed legislation that eliminated for record consideration races run on point-to-point courses, such as Boston's.\n\nThe 26.2-mile course into Boston, doesn't meet two TAC criteria for records on point-to-point layouts - its start and finish lines are farther apart than 30 percent of the race distance and the course drops in altitude more than the maximum 42 meters.\n\nThe Boston Athletic Association has asked for the rule to be repealed. The controversy didn't keep the world's top marathoners away.\n\nThey included de Castella, and Steve Jones of Wales, the 1988 New York champion. Jones dropped out about halfway through the race.\n\nThe women's field included Veronique Marot of Britain, ranked second in the world last year; Kim Jones of Spokane, Wash., ranked third in 1989; Zoya Ivanova of the Soviet Union, winner of the 1989 Los Angeles Marathon, and Laura Fogli of Italy, who finished second at the New York Marathon twice.\n\nDefending champions Mekonnen and Ingrid Kristiansen of Norway did not compete. Mekonnen plans to run in the Rotterdam Marathon next weekend. Kristiansen is pregnant."
