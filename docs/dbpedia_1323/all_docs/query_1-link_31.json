Experimental activities comprise investigation into material activation and decay, neutron and photon transport in matter and R&D work on radiation detectors for harsh environments. The intense DT neutron generator is capable to produce a maximum of 1012 n/s. The neutron source is a solid-type water-cooled tritium target based on a titanium matrix on a copper carrier. The neutron yield at a typical deuteron beam current of 1 mA is of the order of 1011 n/s in 4Î . A pneumatic sample transport system is available for short-time irradiations and connected to wo high-purity germanium detector spectrometers for the measurement of induced activities. The overall design of the experimental hall with the neutron generator allows a flexible setup of experiments including the possibility of investigating larger structures and cooled samples or samples at high temperatures.\n\nStatus of steam generator tubing integrity at Jaslovske Bohunice NPP\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nCepcek, S.\n\n1997-02-01\n\nSteam generator represents one of the most important component of nuclear power plants. Especially, loss of tubing integrity of steam generators can lead to the primary coolant leak to secondary circuit and in worse cases to the unit shut down or to the PTS events occurrence. Therefore, to ensure the steam generator tubing integrity and the current knowledge about tube degradation propagation and development is of the highest importance. In this paper the present status of steam generator tubing integrity in operated NPP in Slovak Republic is presented.\n\nNUCLEOPORINS NPP-1, NPP-3, NPP-4, NPP-11 and NPP-13 ARE REQUIRED FOR PROPER SPINDLE ORIENTATION IN C. ELEGANS\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSchetter, Aaron; Askjaer, Peter; Piano, Fabio; Mattaj, Iain; Kemphues, Kenneth\n\n2006-01-01\n\nNucleoporins are components of the nuclear pore, which is required for nucleo-cytoplasmic transport. We report a role for a subclass of nucleoporins in orienting the mitotic spindle in C. elegans embryos. RNAi-mediated depletion of any of five putative nucleoporins npp-1, npp-3, npp-4, npp-11, and npp-13 leads to indistinguishable spindle orientation defects. Transgenic worms expressing NPP-1::GFP or NPP-11::GFP show GFP localization at the nuclear envelope, consistent with their predicted function. NPP-1 interacts with the other nucleoporins in yeast two-hybrid assays suggesting that the proteins affect spindle orientation by a common process. The failed orientation phenotype of npp-1(RNAi) is at least partially epistatic to the ectopic spindle rotation in the AB blastomere of par-3 mutant embryos. This suggests that NPP-1 contributes to the mechanics of spindle orientation. However, NPP-1 is also required for PAR-6 asymmetry at the two-cell stage, indicating that nucleoporins may be required to define cortical domains in the germ line blasotmere P1. Nuclear envelope structure is abnormal in npp-1(RNAi) embryos but the envelope maintains its integrity and most nuclear proteins we assayed accumulate normally. These findings raise the possibility that these nucleoporins may have direct roles in orienting the mitotic spindle and the maintenance of cell polarity.

V.; Shipkov, A. A.; Lovchev, V. N.; Gutsev, D. F.\n\n2016-10-01\n\nProblems of metal flow-accelerated corrosion (FAC) in the pipelines and equipment of the condensate- feeding and wet-steam paths of NPP power-generating units (PGU) are examined. Goals, objectives, and main principles of the methodology for the implementation of an integrated program of AO Concern Rosenergoatom for the prevention of unacceptable FAC thinning and for increasing operational flow-accelerated corrosion resistance of NPP EaP are worded (further the Program). A role is determined and potentialities are shown for the use of Russian software packages in the evaluation and prediction of FAC rate upon solving practical problems for the timely detection of unacceptable FAC thinning in the elements of pipelines and equipment (EaP) of the secondary circuit of NPP PGU. Information is given concerning the structure, properties, and functions of the software systems for plant personnel support in the monitoring and planning of the inservice inspection of FAC thinning elements of pipelines and equipment of the secondary circuit of NPP PGUs, which are created and implemented at some Russian NPPs equipped with VVER-1000, VVER-440, and BN-600 reactors. It is noted that one of the most important practical results of software packages for supporting NPP personnel concerning the issue of flow-accelerated corrosion consists in revealing elements under a hazard of intense local FAC thinning. Examples are given for successful practice at some Russian NPP concerning the use of software systems for supporting the personnel in early detection of secondary-circuit pipeline elements with FAC thinning close to an unacceptable level. Intermediate results of working on the Program are presented and new tasks set in 2012 as a part of the updated program are denoted. The prospects of the developed methods and tools in the scope of the Program measures at the stages of design and construction of NPP PGU are discussed.

Acute rupture of the Achilles tendon may be treated in a variety of manners, including conservative treatment, open suture and percutaneous suture. Surgical treatment of active patients is recommended, as the risk of re-rupture is greater after non-surgical treatment. The aim of surgery is adequate treatment of Achilles tendon rupture with a low rate of complications, high comfort for patients and fast social and occupational rehabilitation. The indication for surgical treatment of Achilles tendon rupture predominantly includes ruptures in active patients, with the goal of optimal functional rehabilitation. Furthermore, the percutaneous technique protects soft tissue, with a lower rate of wound healing disorders and infection than with open surgical treatment. In our clinic we perform the percutaneous suturing technique with the Dresden instruments. The surgical technique and functional aftercare are shown in a video clip. Between 2007 and 2013, we treated 212 patients with acute Achilles tendon rupture by surgery with the Dresden instruments. There were 7 re-ruptures (3.3â%) and one case of infection within one year of surgery. Percutaneous Achilles tendon suture technique with the Dresden instruments is a safe operation that protects soft tissue. Patient satisfaction is high and the rate of complications is low. This allows rapid social and occupational rehabilitation.

The EBIS-A is the precursor to the Dresden EBIS-SC in which the permanent magnets have been replaced by superconducting solenoids for the use of the source in high-ion-current applications such as heavy-ion cancer therapy. Beam emittance and brightness values were calculated from data sets acquired for a variety of source parameters, in leaky as well as pulsed ion extraction mode. With box shaped pulses of C(4+) ions at an energy of 39 keV root mean square emittances of 1-4 mm mrad and a brightness of 10 nA mm(-2) mrad(-2) were achieved. The results meet the expectations for high quality ion beams generated by an electron beam ion source.\n\nTraining for the 1st international nano-car race: the Dresden molecule-vehicle\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nEisenhut, Frank; Durand, Corentin; Moresco, Francesca; Launay, Jean-Pierre; Joachim, Christian\n\n2016-10-01\n\nThe first international nano-car race will be held in Toulouse, France in spring 2017, with the participation of six international teams. The training session of the Dresden Team is reported using the Toulouse LT-UHV 4-STM reconfigured with four independent controllers in preparation for the race. During the training, the total Au(1 1 1) surface was prepared over the full gold substrate and a 90 nm long race track with two turns was defined according to the new nano-car race rules. The Dresden windmill molecule-vehicle was deposited in ultrahigh vacuum conditions, imaged, and manipulated by any one of the four tips on race tracks to reach a 5 nm per hour driving speed including the STM image time after a given driving bias voltage pulse. During the manipulation with one of the tips, it was possible to image with another tip in parallel. Strategies for a safe and fast driving was established by the Dresden team along the fcc rafter of the Au(1 1 1) surface together with the possibility to repair on the spot the destroyed molecule for example during the negotiation of a turn. Other teams will beneficiate from this experience to also improve their driving strategy.\n\nOptimization of steam generators of NPP with WWER in operation with variable load\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nParchevskii, V. M.; Shchederkina, T. E.; Gur'yanova, V. V.\n\n2017-11-01\n\nThe report addresses the issue of the optimal water level in the horizontal steam generators of NPP with WWER. On the one hand, the level needs to be kept at the lower limit of the allowable range, as gravity separation, steam will have the least humidity and the turbine will operate with higher efficiency. On the other hand, the higher the level, the greater the supply of water in the steam generator, and therefore the higher the security level of the unit, because when accidents involving loss of cooling of the reactor core, the water in the steam generators, can be used for cooling. To quantitatively compare the damage from higher level to the benefit of improving the safety was assessed of the cost of one cubic meter of water in the steam generators, the formulated objective function of optimal levels control. This was used two-dimensional separation characteristics of steam generators. It is demonstrated that the security significantly shifts the optimal values of the levels toward the higher values, and this bias is greater the lower the load unit.\n\nThe urban impact on the regional climate of Dresden\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSÃ¤ndig, B.; Renner, E.\n\n2010-09-01\n\nThe principal objective of this research is to clarify the impact of urban elements such as buildings and streets on the regional climate and air quality in the framework of the BMBF-project \"Regionales Klimaanpassungsprogramm fÂ¨ur die Modellregion Dresden\" (REGKLAM). Drawing on the example of Dresden this work explores how the presence of cities influences the atmospheric flow and the characteristics of the boundary layer. Persuing this target, an urban surface exchange parameterisation module (Martilli et al., 2002) was implemented in a high resolution version of the COSMO model, the forecast model of the German Weather Service (DWD). Using a mesoscale model for this regional climate study implies the advantage of embedding the focused area in a realistic large scale situation via downscaling by means of one way nesting and allows to simulate the urban impact for different IPCC-szenarios. The urban module is based on the assumption that a city could be represented by a bunch of \"urban classes\". Each urban class is characterised by specific properties such as typical street directions or probability of finding a building in a special height. Based on urban structure data of Dresden (vector shape-files containing the outlines of all buildings and the respective heights) an automated method of extracting the relevant geometrical input parameters for the urban module was developed. By means of this model setup we performed case studies, in which we investigate the interactions between the city structure and the meteorological variables with regard to special synoptical situations such as the Bohemian wind, a typical flow pattern of cold air, sourced from the Bohemian Basin, in the Elbe Valley, which acts then like a wind channel. Another focal point is formed by the investigation of different types of artificial cities ranging from densely builtup areas to suburban areas in order to illuminating the impact of the city type on the dynamical and thermal properties of\n\n75 FR 75706 - Dresden Nuclear Power Station, Units 2 and 3 and Quad Cities Nuclear Power Station, Unit Nos. 1...\n\nFederal Register 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014\n\n2010-12-06\n\n...- 2010-0373] Dresden Nuclear Power Station, Units 2 and 3 and Quad Cities Nuclear Power Station, Unit Nos... and DPR-25 for Dresden Nuclear Power Station, Units 2 and 3, respectively, located in Grundy County, Illinois, and to Renewed Facility Operating License Nos.

NPP1 releases nucleoside 5â²-monophosphates from various nucleotides, whereas NPP2 mainly functions as a lysophospholipase D. We have used a domain-swapping approach to map substrate-specifying determinants of NPP1 and NPP2. The catalytic domain of NPP1 fused to the N- and C-terminal domains of NPP2 was hyperactive as a nucleotide phosphodiesterase, but did not show any lysophospholipase D activity. In contrast, chimaeras of the catalytic domain of NPP2 and the N- and/or C-terminal domains of NPP1 were completely inactive. These data indicate that the catalytic domain as well as both extremities of NPP2 contain lysophospholipid-specifying sequences. Within the catalytic domain of NPP1 and NPP2, we have mapped residues close to the catalytic site that determine the activities towards nucleotides and lysophospholipids. We also show that the conserved Gly/Phe-Xaa-Gly-Xaa-Xaa-Gly (G/FXGXXG) motif near the catalytic site is required for metal binding, but is not involved in substrate-specification. Our data suggest that the distinct activities of NPP1 and NPP2 stem from multiple differences throughout the polypeptide chain.

The main characteristics of CANDU type waste are its high concentrations of tritium and radiocarbon. Also, the existing management strategy for radioactive waste at Cernavoda NPP provides no treatment or conditioning for radioactive waste disposal. These characteristics embodied a challenging effort, in order to select a proper strategy for radioactive waste management at present, when Romania is an EU member and a signatory country of the JointmoreÂ Â» Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management. The helping of advanced countries in radioactive waste management, directly or into the frame of the international organizations, like IAEA, become solve the aforementioned challenges at adequate level.

Furthermore the notifications of the affections with tapeworm which had come into the district hygiene inspection of Dresden were evaluated. An affection with Ascaris lumbricoides of 1.2%, with Trichuris trichiura of 1.6%, with Enterobius vermicularis of 14.5% and with Taeniarhynchus saginatus of about 1% were proved. In the case of Enterobius vermicularis the for the most part affected age groups were the 14- to 20-year-old test persons and concerning Taeniarhynchus saginatus the 21- to 70-year-old test persons. Accumulations of the extensity of the affection with helminths bound to a species of hosts were not detected. Concerning the taeniarhynchosis since 1966 a permanent increase of the extensity of affection is to be registered. The duty of notification concerning taeniarhynchosis is often neglected. Only about 1/6 of the affection with tapeworm is notified in the district hygiene inspection.\n\nThe new 6 MV AMS-facility DREAMS at Dresden\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAkhmadaliev, Shavkat; Heller, RenÃ©; Hanf, Daniel; Rugel, Georg; Merchel, Silke\n\n2013-01-01\n\nA new 6 MV electrostatic tandem accelerator has been put into operation at Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf (HZDR). The system is equipped for accelerator mass spectrometry and opens a new research field at HZDR and the Helmholtz Association. It will be also used for ion beam analysis as well as for material modification via high-energy ion implantation. The research activity at the DREsden Accelerator Mass Spectrometry facility (DREAMS) based on a 6 MV Tandetron is primarily dedicated to the long-lived radioisotopes of 10Be, 26Al, 36Cl, 41Ca, and 129I. DREAMS background levels have been found to be at 4.5 Ã 10-16 for 10Be/9Be, 8 Ã 10-16 for 26Al/27Al, 3 Ã 10-15 for 36Cl/35Cl and 8 Ã 10-15 for 41Ca/40Ca, respectively. The observed background of 2 Ã 10-13 for 129I/127I originates from intrinsic 129I from AgI produced from commercial KI. The introduction of quality assurance approaches for AMS, such as the use of traceable calibration materials and taking part in interlaboratory comparisons, guarantees high accuracy data for future DREAMS users. During first experiments an energy calibration of the accelerator has been carried out using the nuclear reaction 1H(15N,Î³Î±)12C yielding an energy correction factor of 1.019.\n\nTechnology for NPP decantate treatment realized at Kola NPP\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nStakhiv, Michael; Avezniyazov, Slava; Savkin, Alexander\n\n2007-07-01\n\nAt Moscow SIA 'Radon' jointly with JSC 'Alliance Gamma', the technology for NPP Decantate Treatment was developed, tested and realized at Kola NPP. This technology consists of dissolving the salt residue and subsequent treatment by ozonization, separation of the deposits formed from ozonization and selective cleaning by ferro-cyanide sorbents. The nonactive salt solution goes to an industrial waste disposal site or a repository specially developed at NPP sites for 'exempt waste' products by IAEA classification. This technology was realized at Kola NPP in December 2006 year. At this time more than 1000 m{sup 3} of decantates log time stored aremoreÂ Â» treated. It allows solving very old problem to empty decantates' tanks at NPPs in environmentally safe manner and with high volume reduction factor.

Yet local total estimates on the prevalence of PD with dementia/depression are still lacking. These are socioeconomically important, especially for the eastern federal states in Germany due to the demographic structures. We conducted a two-staged total estimation in the area of Dresden. First, all local office-based neurologists, hospitals and retirement homes were asked to list their patients/residents with PD on a single study day. Then a random sample of patients/home residents was neuropsycholoigcally examined, including the Mini-mental-state exam and the Montgomery-Asberg Depression rating scale. Dementia was diagnosed according to DSM-IV criteria. Overall, 886 PD cases (95 % CI: 809 - 926) were estimated, of which 252 (95 % CI: 226 - 279) suffered from dementia and 216 (95 % CI: 191 - 242) from depression. Dementia rates increased by age with 13.8 % (â¤ 65 years) to 40.2 % (â¥ 76 years). Depression rates ranged from 23.3 % to 28.0 %. Overall, 20.6 % of all ambulatory treated PD patients and 85.7 % of all home residents with PD had dementia. The prevalence of PD in Dresden dovetails with previous reported estimates. Dementia and depression are frequent complications in outpatients as well as home residents with PD.

This was followed by the development of agriculture which began to gradually restrict availability of NPP for wild animals. Finally, humans entered the industrial era using non-plant based energies to power societies. Here I ask the following questions about these three energy transitions: 1. How much NPP energy may have become available following the megafauna extinctions? 2. When did humans, through agriculture and domestic animals, consume more NPP than wild mammals in each country? 3. When did humans and wild mammals use more energy than was available in total NPP in each country? To answer this last question I calculate NPP consumed by wild animals, crops, livestock, and energy use (all converted to units of MJ) and compare this with the total potential NPP (also in MJ) for each country. We develop the term \"ecological bankruptcy\" to refer to the level of consumption where not all energy needs can be met by the country's NPP. Currently, 82 countries and a net population of 5.4 billion are in the state of ecologically bankruptcy, crossing this threshold at various times over the past 40 years. By contrast, only 52 countries with a net population of 1.2 billion remain ecologically solvent. Overall, the Holocene has seen remarkable changes in consumption patterns of NPP, passing through three distinct phases. Humans began in a world where there was 1.6-4.1% unclaimed NPP to consume. From 1700-1850, humans began to consume more than wild animals (globally averaged). At present, >82% of people live in countries where not even all available plant matter could satisfy our energy demands.\n\nNPP Satellite Launch\n\nNASA Image and Video Library\n\n2011-10-28\n\nThe Satellite Operations Facility of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is seen here minutes before the launch of the National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System Preparatory Project (NPP) on Friday, Oct. 28, 2011 in Suitland, Md.

However, at that time there was a lack of knowledge about how to administer and monitor lithium therapy safely and properly. The lithium clinics in Dresden and Berlin were remarkably similar in their beginnings in the late 1960s regarding patient numbers and scientific expertise without being aware of one another due to the Iron Curtain separating Germany into a western and eastern part until 1990. In what were initially lithium-care programs run independently from one another, the lithium clinics embedded in academic settings in Dresden and Berlin represent a milestone in the history of psychopharmacological treatment of affective disorders in Germany and trailblazers for today's lithium therapy. Nowadays, lithium's clinical applications are unquestioned, such as its use in strategies to prevent mood episodes and suicide, and to treat depression. The extensively documented knowledge of lithium treatment is the fruit of more than 50 years of observing disease courses and of studying side effects and influencing factors of lithium prophylaxis. Its safe and proper administration-in determining the correct indication, baseline and follow-up examinations, recommended dosages, monitoring, or the management of side effects-is well established. Subsequently, both national and international guidelines continue recommending lithium as the gold standard in treating patients with unipolar and bipolar disorders.

M.; Friedl, M. A.; Schaaf, C.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nLand surface phenology (LSP) datasets have been produced from a variety of coarse spatial resolution satellite observations at both regional and global scales and spanning different time periods since 1982. However, the LSP product generated from NASA's MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data at a spatial resolution of 500m, which is termed Land Cover Dynamics (MCD12Q2), is the only global product operationally produced and freely accessible at annual time steps from 2001. Because MODIS instrument is aging and will be replaced by the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS), this research focuses on the generation and evaluation of a global LSP product from Suomi-NPP VIIRS time series observations that provide continuity with the MCD12Q2 product. Specifically, we generate 500m VIIRS global LSP data using daily VIIRS Nadir BRDF (bidirectional reflectance distribution function)-Adjusted reflectances (NBAR) in combination with land surface temperature, snow cover, and land cover type as inputs. The product provides twelve phenological metrics (seven phenological dates and five phenological greenness magnitudes), along with six quality metrics characterizing the confidence and quality associated with phenology retrievals at each pixel. In this paper, we describe the input data and algorithms used to produce this new product, and investigate the impact of VIIRS data time series quality on phenology detections across various climate regimes and ecosystems.

We also explore the impact of high frequency cloud cover on the VIIRS LSP product by comparing with phenology detected from the Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) onboard Himawari-8.

P.; Ullmann, F.; Fritzsche, S.; Surzhykov, A.\n\n2002-02-01\n\nThe production of highly charged argon, manganese, iron and nickel ions in a room-temperature electron beam ion trap (EBIT), the Dresden EBIT, has been investigated by means of energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy of the direct excitation (DE) and radiative recombination (RR) processes. To derive the charge state distributions of the ions in the trap, direct excitation and radiative recombination cross-sections were calculated at electron energies of 8 and 14.4 keV. Based on these theoretical cross-sections and the measured X-ray spectra, the ion densities and the absolute number of ions, which are trapped in the electron beam, are determined for argon, manganese, iron and nickel. Emphasis has been paid to the highly charged ions, including the helium-like and hydrogen-like ions and bare nuclei. In the case of iron we also determined the contributions from lower ionization stages from DE transition lines. It is shown, that in the Dresden EBIT elements at least up to nickel can be fully ionized. Beside energy dispersive spectroscopy it is shown for iron by wavelength dispersive X-ray spectroscopy that with a comparably high gas pressure in the order of 10 -8 mbar carbon-, boron-, beryllium-, lithium- and helium-like iron ions can be produced.\n\nGrassland Npp Monitoring Based on Multi-Source Remote Sensing Data Fusion\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCai, Y.

It plays an important role in the energy and material exchange of the ground-atmosphere system and is a key part of the global carbon cycle process.Climate change has an important influence on the carbon cycle of terrestrial ecosystems. Net Primary Productivity (Net Primary Productivity)is an important parameter for evaluating global terrestrial ecosystems. For the Xinjiang region, the study of grassland NPP has gradually become a hot issue in the ecological environment.Increasing the estimation accuracy of NPP is of great significance to the development of the ecosystem in Xinjiang. Based on the third-generation GIMMS AVHRR NDVI global vegetation dataset and the MODIS NDVI (MOD13A3) collected each month by the United States Atmospheric and Oceanic Administration (NOAA),combining the advantages of different remotely sensed datasets, this paper obtained the maximum synthesis fusion for New normalized vegetation index (NDVI) time series in 2006-2015.Analysis of Net Primary Productivity of Grassland Vegetation in Xinjiang Using Improved CASA Model The method described in this article proves the feasibility of applying data processing, and the accuracy of the NPP calculation using the fusion processed NDVI has been greatly improved. The results show that: (1) The NPP calculated from the new normalized vegetation index (NDVI) obtained from the fusion of GIMMS AVHRR NDVI and MODIS NDVI is significantly higher than the NPP calculated from these two raw data; (2) The grassland NPP in Xinjiang Interannual changes show an overall increase trend; interannual changes in NPP have a certain relationship with precipitation.\n\nNPP/NPOESS Status\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nStockton, D.\n\n2009-12-01\n\nIn this presentation, the NPOESS Integrated Program Office will provide a status update on the NPOESS Preparatory Project (NPP) and the NPOESS program.

This issue of Superconductor Science and Technology contains plenary, invited and a selection of contributed oral papers of the four main EUCAS areas: materials, wires and tapes, large scale applications and electronics. The remaining contributed papers that were selected for the conference proceedings will be published in the Journal of Physics: Conference Series. The Dresden EUCAS conference, with 712 participants from 43 countries, continued the tradition of preceding EUCAS conferences of combining basic superconductivity research contributions with the discussion of recent material advances and new developments in large scale and electronic applications. In Dresden, contributions on the recently discovered Fe-based superconductors were presented for the first time during a EUCAS conference and their potential for applications was intensively discussed. Among all the high level papers of this issue we particularly want to highlight the plenary contribution of Praveen Chaudhari on grain boundaries in cuprate superconductors. In his paper Praveen discusses the Jc limitation in HTSC tapes and tunnelling spectroscopy in LSCO thin film bicrystals. Just a few weeks ago we received the sad news that Praveen had passed away on 13 January 2010. Already fighting with his serious illness, Praveen spent all his efforts last fall finishing his plenary talk and paper. This paper will remind us always of his contributions to basic and applied aspects of superconductivity in general and especially his important work on HTSC grain boundaries. Finally we want to acknowledge the help of the International Advisory and National Committees in setting up the scientific program and we would especially like to express our gratitude to all the members of the Local Organization\n\nDoes climate directly influence NPP globally?\n\nPubMed\n\nChu, Chengjin; Bartlett, Megan; Wang, Youshi; He, Fangliang; Weiner, Jacob; Chave, JÃ©rÃ´me; Sack, Lawren\n\n2016-01-01\n\nThe need for rigorous analyses of climate impacts has never been more crucial. Current textbooks state that climate directly influences ecosystem annual net primary productivity (NPP), emphasizing the urgent need to monitor the impacts of climate change. A recent paper challenged this consensus, arguing, based on an analysis of NPP for 1247 woody plant communities across global climate gradients, that temperature and precipitation have negligible direct effects on NPP and only perhaps have indirect effects by constraining total stand biomass (Mtot ) and stand age (a). The authors of that study concluded that the length of the growing season (lgs ) might have a minor influence on NPP, an effect they considered not to be directly related to climate. In this article, we describe flaws that affected that study's conclusions and present novel analyses to disentangle the effects of stand variables and climate in determining NPP. We re-analyzed the same database to partition the direct and indirect effects of climate on NPP, using three approaches: maximum-likelihood model selection, independent-effects analysis, and structural equation modeling. These new analyses showed that about half of the global variation in NPP could be explained by Mtot combined with climate variables and supported strong and direct influences of climate independently of Mtot , both for NPP and for net biomass change averaged across the known lifetime of the stands (ABCÂ =Â average biomass change). We show that lgs is an important climate variable, intrinsically correlated with, and contributing to mean annual temperature and precipitation (Tann and Pann ), all important climatic drivers of NPP. Our analyses provide guidance for statistical and mechanistic analyses of climate drivers of ecosystem processes for predictive modeling and provide novel evidence supporting the strong, direct role of climate in determining vegetation productivity at the global scale.

After several years of operation with the N-16 monitors, Almaraz NPP experience may be summarized as follows: N-16 monitors are very useful to follow the steam generator leak rate trend and to detect an incipient tube rupture; but they do not provide an exact absolute leak rate value, mainly when there are small leaks. The evolution of the measured N-16 leakmoreÂ Â» rates varies along the fuel cycle, with the same trend for the 3 steam generators. This behaviour is associated with the primary water chemistry evolution along the cycle.Â«Â less\n\nSimulation of Hydrogen Distribution in Ignalina NPP ALS Compartments During BDBA\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nBabilas, Egidijus; Urbonavicius, Egidijus; Rimkevicius, Sigitas\n\n2006-07-01\n\nAccident Localisation System (ALS) of Ignalina NPP is a 'pressure suppression' type confinement, which protects the population, employees and environment from the radiation hazards. According to the Safety Analysis Report for Ignalina NPP {approx}110 m{sup 3} of hydrogen is released to ALS compartments during the Maximum Design Basis Accident. However in case of beyond design basis accident, when the oxidation of zirconium starts, the amount of generated hydrogen could be significantly higher. If the volume concentration of hydrogen in the compartment reaches 4%, there is a possibility for a combustible mixture to appear. To prevent the possible hydrogen accumulation inmoreÂ Â» the ALS of the Ignalina NPP during an accident the H{sub 2} control system is installed. The results of the performed analysis derived the places of the possible H{sub 2} accumulation in the ALS compartments during the transient processes and assessed the mixture combustibility in these places for a beyond design basis accident scenario. Such analysis of H{sub 2} distribution in the ALS of Ignalina NPP in case of BDBA was not performed before.

The secondary aim was to identify the secure limit of mobilization, the type of failure, and the type of apposition. The lower limbs of eight males (mean age: 60.3Â Â±Â 6.3Â years) were repaired with the Dresden technique following complete, percutaneous mid-substance Achilles tendon rupture. A basal tension of 10Â N at 30Â° of plantarflexion was placed on each specimen. The angle of the ankle during clinical failure (tendon ends separation >5Â mm) was then tested via cyclical exercises (i.e. 100 cycles between 30Â° and 15Â° of plantarflexion; 100 cycles between 15Â° of plantarflexion and 0Â°; 100 cycles between 0Â° and 15Â° of dorsiflexion; and 100 cycles between 15Â° of dorsiflexion and full dorsiflexion). Clinical failure was determined using the Laplacian edge detection filter, and the angle of clinical failure was obtained using a rotatory potentiometer aligned in relation to the intermalleolar axis of each foot specimen. The type of failure (knot, tendon, or suture) and apposition (termino-terminal or non-termino-terminal) were determined. Descriptive statistics were used to obtain the mean; standard deviation; 95Â % confidence interval; 1st, 25th, 50th, 75th, and 100th percentiles; and the standard error of the mean for angle data. Proportions were used to describe the type of failure and apposition. The main results were a mean angle of clinical failure equal to 12.5Â° of plantarflexion, a limit of mobilization equal to 14.0Â° of plantarflexion, tendon failure type, and non-termino-terminal apposition in all specimens. While the mean angle of clinical failure in human cadaveric models was 12.5Â° of plantarflexion, after 14.0Â° of plantarflexion, the percutaneous Dresden technique was found insecure for cyclical mobilization\n\nCold weather effects on Dresden Unit 1\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nAnagnostopoulos, H.\n\n1995-03-01\n\nDresden Unit 1 is in the final stages of a decommissioning effort directed at preparing the unit to enter a SAFSTOR status. Following an extended sub-zero cold wave, about 55,000 gallons of water were discovered in the lowest elevation of the spherical reactor enclosure. Cold weather had caused the freezing and breaking of several service water lines that had not been completely isolated. Two days later, at a regularly scheduled decommissioning meeting, the event was communicated to the decommissioning team, who quickly recognized the potential for freezing of a 42 inches diameter Fuel Transfer Tube that connects the sphere tomoreÂ Â» the Spent Fuel Pool. The team directed that the pool gates between the adjacent Spent Fuel Pool and the Fuel Transfer Pool be installed, and a portable source of heat was installed on the Fuel Transfer Tube. It was later determined that, with the fuel pool gates removed, and with a worst case freeze break at the 502 elevation on the Fuel Transfer Tube (in the Sphere), the fuel in the Spent Fuel Pool could be uncovered to a level 3 below the top of active fuel.Â«Â less\n\nAdaptation Strategies to Climate Change and the Role of Planning Instruments - The Example of the Dresden Region (Saxony/Germany)\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAlbrecht, J.; Juta, K.; Nobis, A.\n\n2009-04-01\n\nof Dresden (project REGKLAM). The REGKLAM-project is based on regionalised scenarios of climate change and includes measures of climate change adaptation to change for instance, urban form, infrastructure assets (e.g., reservoirs) and land use. Various institutions from politics, administration, economy, and research as well as civil society are involved in the project (the city of Dresden, several ministries and authorities of Saxony, the Dresden Chamber of Industry and Commerce and the University of Dresden). The IRCAP is planned to be an informal, cross-sectoral instrument of adaptation to climate change. As a regional programme, the IRCAP is addressed to decision-makers of the region of Dresden (defined, for instance, as planning region). Its function is to complement and coordinate existing instruments and measures. These instruments also include instruments of environmental and spatial planning on the regional level. Spatial and environmental planning can rely on a wide range of formal and informal instruments on different spatial, administrative, and sectoral levels, e.g. land use and landscape plans. Our contribution to the EGU conference aims to clear the role and relevance of the existing formal and informal planning instruments in the region of Dresden for the process of developing the IRCAP. Firstly, a survey is conducted for the purpose of identifying all relevant planning instruments. The identification process is based on specific criteria, for example: reference to the region, contents relating to the topic of climate change respectively climate adaptation. Secondly, the presentation argues for a selection of those planning instruments which seem to be most relevant for the process of developing an IRCAP. This selection process is based on specific criteria which include, for instance, complexity of expected effects, reference to regional and sectoral vulnerability, opportunity for future change of the existing planning instruments (e.g., current\n\nEstimating cropland NPP using national crop inventory and MODIS derived crop specific parameters\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBandaru, V.; West, T. O.; Ricciuto, D. M.\n\n2011-12-01\n\nEstimates of cropland net primary production (NPP) are needed as input for estimates of carbon flux and carbon stock changes. Cropland NPP is currently estimated using terrestrial ecosystem models, satellite remote sensing, or inventory data. All three of these methods have benefits and problems. Terrestrial ecosystem models are often better suited for prognostic estimates rather than diagnostic estimates. Satellite-based NPP estimates often underestimate productivity on intensely managed croplands and are also limited to a few broad crop categories. Inventory-based estimates are consistent with nationally collected data on crop yields, but they lack sub-county spatial resolution. Integrating these methods will allow for spatial resolution consistent with current land cover and land use, while also maintaining total biomass quantities recorded in national inventory data. The main objective of this study was to improve cropland NPP estimates by using a modification of the CASA NPP model with individual crop biophysical parameters partly derived from inventory data and MODIS 8day 250m EVI product. The study was conducted for corn and soybean crops in Iowa and Illinois for years 2006 and 2007. We used EVI as a linear function for fPAR, and used crop land cover data (56m spatial resolution) to extract individual crop EVI pixels. First, we separated mixed pixels of both corn and soybean that occur when MODIS 250m pixel contains more than one crop. Second, we substituted mixed EVI pixels with nearest pure pixel values of the same crop within 1km radius. To get more accurate photosynthetic active radiation (PAR), we applied the Mountain Climate Simulator (MTCLIM) algorithm with the use of temperature and precipitation data from the North American Land Data Assimilation System (NLDAS-2) to generate shortwave radiation data. Finally, county specific light use efficiency (LUE) values of each crop for years 2006 to 2007 were determined by application of mean county inventory\n\nIs the Dresden technique a mechanical design of choice suitable for the repair of middle third Achilles tendon ruptures? A biomechanical study.\n\nPubMed\n\nde la Fuente, C; CarreÃ±o-Zillmann, G; Marambio, H; HenrÃ­quez, H\n\n2016-01-01\n\nTo compare the mechanical failure of the Dresden technique for Achilles tendon repair with the double modified Kessler technique controlled repair technique. The maximum resistance of the two repair techniques are also compared. A total of 30 Achilles tendon ruptures in bovine specimens were repaired with an Ethibond(Â®) suture to 4.5cm from the calcaneal insertion. Each rupture was randomly distributed into one of two surgical groups. After repair, each specimen was subjected to a maximum traction test. The mechanical failure (tendon, suture, or knot) rates (proportions) were compared using the exact Fisher test (Î±=.05), and the maximum resistances using the Student t test (Î±=.05). There was a difference in the proportions of mechanical failures, with the most frequent being a tendon tear in the Dresden technique, and a rupture of the suture in the Kessler technique. The repair using the Dresden technique performed in the open mode, compared to the Kessler technique, has a more suitable mechanical design for the repair of middle third Achilles tendon ruptures on developing a higher tensile resistance in 58.7%. However, its most common mechanical failure was a tendon tear, which due to inappropriate loads could lead to lengthening of the Achilles tendon. Copyright Â© 2016 SECOT.

It provide qualitative and quantitative estimates of the events occurring in the biosphere. Carbon assimilated by plants is used by them to increase their biomass and is a main process of food chains on Earth. NPP is highly variable in time and space. It may depend on physical factors such as temperature, humidity and concentration of nutrients in the soil, etc. And also depends on the types of vegetation (woody, herbaceous, coniferous, and deciduous, etc.). In this regard, it is very important to understand what kind of climate factor is a limiting factor of NPP in the given time and place. For this aim a statistical analysis of the feedback between NPP (MODIS NPP) and the temperature of the forest zone Yenisey River has been performed. We used the time series of NPP for studied territory between 2000 and 2012. The time series of temperature were calculated using the data from the satellite measurements (MODISTERRA) and the global network of weather stations. The considered territory is situated in the Yenisey River basin with diverse natural landscapes - from forest-tundra in the North to alpine meadows in the West Sayan Mountains in the South. This territory extends along the Yenisey River from north to south for about 2000 km. Plains and mountainous areas have been investigated separately. Mountain forests are located in the West Sayan and altitudinal zonation varies from 500 to 2000 m a.s.l. In order to investigate the causal relationships between temperature and NPP we applied the method of Convergent Cross-Mapping (CCM) (Sugihara et al., Science. 2012. V. 338. P. 496-500). This method in some case allows to determine what is a reason and what is consequence, that cannot be definded by simple correlation. It has been shown that the best results are obtained for the 8 -day composite satellite data during the growing season (MOD17A2, MOD11A2).

In September 1915, while the sailors of SMS Dresden were forcibly detained on Isla Quiriquina, BÃ­o BÃ­o Region, Chile, 60 individuals became ill. The cause of the outbreak was the consumption of sausages made from pork infected with the parasite Trichinella spiralis. There was a fatal case. The review of the epidemiological aspects that facilitated the presentation and spread of human trichinosis at that time allows to conclude that, pork breeded in poor hygienic conditions, meat and its by-products clandestinely sold without sanitary inspection and the language barrier were determinant in the occurrence of the epidemic outbreak.\n\nKinetic behaviour of calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase with pNPP.\n\nPubMed\n\nChaudhuri, Gouri; Chatterjee, Saswata; Venu-Babu, P; Ramasamy, K; Thilagaraj, W Richard\n\n2013-02-01\n\nThe hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP) by calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (CIAP) was investigated with respect to kinetic parameters such as V(max), K(m) and K(cat) under varying pH, buffers, substrate concentration, temperature and period of incubation. Highest activity was obtained with Tris-HCl at pH 11, while in the case of glycine-NaOH buffer the peak activity was recorded at pH 9.5. The enzyme showed the following kinetic characteristics with pNPP in 50 mM Tris-HCl at pH 11 and 100 mM glycine-NaOH at pH 9.5 at an incubation temperature of 37 degrees C: V(max), 3.12 and 1.6 micromoles min(-1) unit(-1); K(m), 7.6 x 10(-4) M and 4 x 10(-4) M; and K(cat), 82.98 s(-1) and 42.55 s(-1), respectively. CIAP displayed a high temperature optimum of 45 degrees C at pH 11. The kinetic behaviour of the enzyme under different parameters suggested that the enzyme might undergo subtle conformational changes in response to the buffers displaying unique characteristics. Bioprecipitation of Cu2+ from 50 ppm of CuCl2 solution was studied where 64.3% of precipitation was obtained. P(i) generated from CIAP-mediated hydrolysis of pNPP was found to bind with copper and precipitated as copper-phosphate. Thus, CIAP could be used as a test candidate in bioremediation of heavy metals from industrial wastes through generation of metal-phosphate complexes.\n\nThe Dresden Burnout Study: Protocol of a prospective cohort study for the bio-psychological investigation of burnout.\n\nPubMed\n\nPenz, Marlene; Wekenborg, Magdalena K; Pieper, Lars; Beesdo-Baum, Katja; Walther, Andreas; Miller, Robert; Stalder, Tobias; Kirschbaum, Clemens\n\n2018-06-01\n\nThe Dresden Burnout Study (DBS) is a 12-year longitudinal cohort study that aims to provide a description of the burnout syndrome on the basis of time and symptom criteria with a special focus on the search for biomarkers. Biological and psychosocial approaches are applied to examine the long-term course and consequences of burnout within a population-based German-speaking sample aged 18 to 68Â years. Demographics and psychosocial data are generated by online assessments, including demographics and questionnaires on burnout, burnout-related constructs, work-environment, and health-related factors. The lab-based biomarker assessment includes endocrine, physiological, immunological, and epigenetic markers obtained from blood and hair samples. In addition, heart rate variability is also measured repeatedly. Within the first 2Â years, the DBS collected psychosocial data from over 7,600 participants with biological data obtained from more than 800 individuals. During the following 10Â years, detailed assessments of biomarkers and psychosocial factors will be collected in annual study waves. Results will be generated during the following decade. The findings of the DBS are expected to pave the road for an in-depth biopsychosocial characterization of burnout and to give insight into the long-term course and potential mental and physical health consequences of the burnout syndrome.

NPOESS replaces the current NOAA Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellites (POES) and DoD Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP). NPOESS satellites carry sensors to collect meteorological, oceanographic, climatological, and solar-geophysical data of the earth, atmosphere, and space. The ground data processing segment is the Interface Data Processing Segment (IDPS), developed by Raytheon Intelligence & Information Systems (IIS). The IDPS processes NPOESS Preparatory Project (NPP)/NPOESS satellite data to provide environmental data products/records (EDRs) to NOAA and DoD processing centers operated by the US government. The IDPS will process EDRs beginning with NPP and continuing through the lifetime of the NPOESS system. The command & telemetry segment is the Command, Control & Communications Segment (C3S), also developed by Raytheon IIS. C3S is responsible for managing the overall NPP/NPOESS missions from control & status of the space and ground assets to ensuring delivery of timely, high quality data from the Space Segment to IDPS for processing. In addition, the C3S provides the globally-distributed ground assets needed to collect and transport mission, telemetry, and command data between the satellites and processing locations. The C3S provides all functions required for day-to-day satellite commanding & state-of-health monitoring, and delivery of Stored Mission Data to each Central IDP for data products development and transfer to system subscribers. The C3S also monitors and reports system-wide health & status and data communications with external systems and between the segments.

K.; Neukaeter, Erwin; Bitterli, Beat\n\n2016-02-01\n\nIn this paper, an overview of the Swiss Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) activation methodology is presented and the work towards its validation by in-situ NPP foil irradiation campaigns is outlined. Nuclear Research and consultancy Group (NRG) in The Netherlands has been given the task of performing the corresponding neutron metrology. For this purpose, small Aluminium boxes containing a set of circular-shaped neutron activation foils have been prepared. After being irradiated for one complete reactor cycle, the sets have been successfully retrieved, followed by gamma-spectrometric measurements of the individual foils at NRG. Along with the individual activities of the foils, the reaction rates and thermal, intermediate and fast neutron fluence rates at the foil locations have been determined. These determinations include appropriate corrections for gamma self-absorption and neutron self-shielding as well as corresponding measurement uncertainties. The comparison of the NPP Monte Carlo calculations with the results of the foil measurements is done by using an individual generic MCNP model functioning as an interface and allowing the simulation of individual foil activation by predetermined neutron spectra. To summarize, the comparison between calculation and measurement serve as a sound validation of the Swiss NPP activation methodology by demonstrating a satisfying agreement between measurement and calculation. Finally, the validation offers a chance for further improvements of the existing NPP models by ensuing calibration and/or modelling optimizations for key components and structures.\n\nKos, Dresden, Utopia... A journey through idealism past and present in public health.\n\nPubMed\n\nMackenbach, Johan\n\n2005-01-01\n\nThis essay reviews some of the sources of idealism in public health, on the basis of an intellectual journey to Kos (home to Hippocrates and his altruistic legacy), Dresden (where the Deutsches Hygiene Museum illustrates the historical connections between fascism and public health), and Utopia (exemplified by Etienne Cabet's Icarie, a fantasy of an ideal city which has nevertheless been partly realized). It is suggested that the large-scale altruism of public health has to be balanced with the value of individual autonomy, and that some degree of dreaming of a better and healthier world is indispensable for further progress in public health. The main conclusion is that the ethical foundations of public health are not always self-evident, and that critical reflection on these foundations was, is, and will always be necessary.\n\nThe Dresden Predictor Study of anxiety and depression: objectives, design, and methods.\n\nPubMed\n\nTrumpf, Julia; Vriends, Noortje; Meyer, Andrea H; Becker, Eni S; Neumer, Simon-Peter; Margraf, JÃ¼rgen\n\n2010-09-01\n\nThe present report describes the objectives, design, and methods of the Dresden Predictor Study (DPS) of anxiety and depression, a prospective epidemiological study investigating anxiety disorders and depression in 3,065 young German women (18-25 years of age).

At both time points, respondents were diagnosed according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition (DSM-IV) using an extended German version of the Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule (ADIS-IV-L). In addition to diagnostic assessment, respondents completed a battery of self-report questionnaires that provided detailed information about potential predictors of disorders and a comprehensive dimensional assessment of psychopathology. Results on both response bias in the baseline investigation and effects of dropout at follow-up are presented, and strengths and limitations of the study design are discussed.\n\nGoal-oriented networks and capacity building for natural hazards - examples in the Dresden region\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHutter, G.\n\n2013-04-01\n\nNetworks and networking are important to build social capacities for natural hazards. However, up to now, it is an open question which types of networks contribute to capacity building under certain circumstances. The paper focuses on the type of a goal-oriented network. The distinction between goal orientation and goal directedness is used to show the following: goal directedness of networks to build capacities for natural hazards involves intensive and continuous processes of sensemaking (Weick, 1995) to specify the network goal. This process of specifying an initial goal statement is important in small and large networks. The governance form of a lead organization network facilitates goal specification. The paper illustrates these findings through evidence from two case studies conducted in the Dresden region in Germany.\n\nNPP Runs the Gauntlet of Environmental Testing\n\nNASA Image and Video Library\n\n2017-12-08\n\nNPP is lowered into the thermal vacuum chamber.

We show here that the C-terminal domain of NPP1-3 is structurally related to a family of DNA/RNA non-specific endonucleases. However, none of the residues that are essential for catalysis by the endonucleases are conserved in NPP1-NPP3, suggesting that the nuclease-like domain of NPP1-3 does not represent a second catalytic domain. Truncation analysis revealed that the nuclease-like domain of NPP1 is required for protein stability, for the targeting of NPP1 to the plasma membrane and for the expression of catalytic activity. We also demonstrate that 16 conserved cysteines in the somatomedin-B-like domains of NPP1, in concert with two flanking cysteines, mediate the dimerization of NPP1. The K173Q polymorphism of NPP1, which maps to the second somatomedin-B-like domain and has been associated with the aetiology of insulin resistance, did not affect the dimerization or catalytic activity of NPP1, and did not endow NPP1 with an affinity for the insulin receptor. Our data suggest that the non-catalytic ectodomains contribute to the subunit structure, stability and function of NPP1-3.

In 1999, a reform process of medical education was started together with Harvard Medical International. The traditional teacher and discipline-centred curriculum was replaced by a student-centred, interdisciplinary and integrative curriculum which has been named DIPOL (Dresden Integrative Patient/Problem- Oriented Learning). The reform process was accompanied and supported by a parallel-ongoing Faculty Development Program. In 2004, a Quality Management Program in medical education was implemented, and in 2005 medical education received DIN EN ISO 9001:2000 certification. Quality Management Program and DIN EN ISO 9001:2000 certification were/are unique for the 34 medical schools in Germany. The students played a very important strategic role in all processes. They were/are members in all committees like the Faculty Board, the Board of Study Affairs (with equal representation) and the ongoing audits in the Quality Management Program. Students are the only ones who experience all years of the curriculum and are capable of detecting, for example gaps, overlaps, inconsistencies of the curriculum and assessments. Therefore, the in-depth knowledge of students about the medical school's curriculum is a very helpful and essential tool in curriculum reform processes and Quality Management Programs of medical education. The reform in medical education, the establishment of the Quality Management program and the certification resulted in an improvement of quality and output of medical education and medical research.\n\nNPP After Launch: Characterizing ATMS Performance\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nLambrigtsen, Bjorn\n\n2011-01-01\n\nThe NPOESS Preparatory Project (NPP) mission is scheduled to launch in the fall of 2011.

J.; Bosscher, Ruud J.; Wiersma, Durk; Schoevers, Robert A.; van Busschbach, Jooske T.\n\n2017-01-01\n\nBackground Body image has implications for psychosocial functioning and quality of life and its disturbance is reported in a broad range of psychiatric disorders. In view of the lack of instruments in Dutch measuring body image as a broad concept, we set out to make an instrument available that reflects the multidimensional character of this construct by including more dimensions than physical appearance. The Dresden KÃ¶rperbildfragebogen (DBIQ, Dresden Body Image Questionnaire) particularly served this purpose. The DBIQ consists of 35 items and five subscales: body acceptance, sexual fulfillment, physical contact, vitality, and self-aggrandizement. The main objective of the present study was to evaluate the psychometric properties of the Dutch translation of the Dresden Body Image Questionnaire (DBIQ-NL) in a non-clinical sample. Methods The psychometric properties of the DBIQ-NL were examined in a non-clinical sample of 988 respondents aged between 18 and 65. We investigated the subscales' internal consistency and test-retest reliability. In order to establish construct validity we evaluated the association with a related construct, body cathexis, and with indices of self-esteem and psychological wellbeing. The factor structure of the DBIQ-NL was examined via confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). The equivalence of the measurement model across sex and age was evaluated by multiplegroup confirmatory factor analyses. Results Confirmatory factor analyses showed a structure in accordance with the original scale, where model fit was improved significantly by moving one item to another subscale. Multiple group confirmatory factor analysis across sex and age demonstrated partial strong invariance. Internal consistency was good with little overlap between the subscales. Temporal reliability and construct validity were satisfactory. Conclusion Results indicate that the DBIQ-NL is a reliable and valid instrument for non-clinical subjects. This provides a sound basis for\n\nSubstrate-Dependence of Competitive Nucleotide Pyrophosphatase/Phosphodiesterase1 (NPP1) Inhibitors\n\nPubMed Central\n\nLee, Sang-Yong; Sarkar, Soumya; Bhattarai, Sanjay; Namasivayam, Vigneshwaran; De Jonghe, Steven; Stephan, Holger; Herdewijn, Piet; El-Tayeb, Ali; MÃ¼ller, Christa E.\n\n2017-01-01\n\nNucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase type 1 (NPP1) is a membrane glycoprotein involved in the hydrolysis of extracellular nucleotides. Its major substrate is ATP which is converted to AMP and diphosphate. NPP1 was proposed as a new therapeutic target in brain cancer and immuno-oncology. Several NPP1 inhibitors have been reported to date, most of which were evaluated vs. the artificial substrate p-nitrophenyl 5â²-thymidine monophosphate (p-Nph-5â²-TMP). Recently, we observed large discrepancies in inhibitory potencies for a class of competitive NPP1 inhibitors when tested vs. the artificial substrate p-Nph-5â²-TMP as compared to the natural substrate ATP. Therefore, the goal of the present study was to investigate whether inhibitors of human NPP1 generally display substrate-dependent inhibitory potency. Systematic evaluation of nucleotidic as well as non-nucleotidic NPP1 inhibitors revealed significant differences in determined Ki values for competitive, but not for non- and un-competitive inhibitors when tested vs. the frequently used artificial substrate p-Nph-5â²-TMP as compared to ATP. Allosteric modulation of NPP1 by p-Nph-5â²-TMP may explain these discrepancies. Results obtained using the AMP derivative p-nitrophenyl 5â²-adenosine monophosphate (p-Nph-5â²-AMP) as an alternative artificial substrate correlated much better with those employing the natural substrate ATP.

VIIRS was designed to provide moderate and imaging resolution of most of the globe twice daily. It is a wide-swath (3,040 km) cross-track scanning radiometer with spatial resolutions of 370.and 740 m at nadir for imaging and moderate bands, respectively. It has 22 spectral bands covering the spectrum between 0.412 11m and 12.01 11m, including 14 reflective solar bands (RSB), 7 thermal emissive bands (TEB), and 1 day-night band (ON B). VIIRS observations are used to generate 22 environmental data products (EORs). This paper will briefly describe NPP VIIRS calibration strategies performed by the independent government team, for the initial on-orbit Intensive Calibration and Validation (ICV) activities. In addition, this paper will provide an early assessment of the sensor on-orbit radiometric performance, such as the sensor signal to noise ratios (SNRs), dual gain transition verification, dynamic range and linearity, reflective bands calibration based on the solar diffuser (SO) and solar diffuser stability monitor (SOSM), and emissive bands calibration based on the on-board blackbody calibration (OBC). A comprehensive set of performance metrics generated during the pre-launch testing program will be compared to VIIRS on-orbit early performance, and a plan for future cal/val activities and performance enhancements will be presented.\n\nNPP4 is a procoagulant enzyme on the surface of vascular endothelium\n\nPubMed Central\n\nAlbright, Ronald A.; Chang, William C.; Robert, Donna; Ornstein, Deborah L.; Cao, Wenxiang; Liu, Lynn; Redick, Meredith E.; Young, J. Isaac; De La Cruz, Enrique M.\n\n2012-01-01\n\nAp3A is a platelet-dense granule component released into the extracellular space during the second wave of platelet aggregation on activation. Here, we identify an uncharacterized enzyme, nucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase-4 (NPP4), as a potent hydrolase of Ap3A capable of stimulating platelet aggregation and secretion. We demonstrate that NPP4 is present on the surface of vascular endothelium, where it hydrolyzes Ap3A into AMP and ADP, and Ap4A into AMP and ATP. Platelet aggregation assays with citrated platelet-rich plasma reveal that the primary and secondary waves of aggregation and dense granule release are strongly induced by nanomolar NPP4 in a concentration-dependent manner in the presence of Ap3A, while Ap3A alone initiates a primary wave of aggregation followed by rapid disaggregation. NPP2 and an active site NPP4 mutant, neither of which appreciably hydrolyzes Ap3A, have no effect on platelet aggregation and secretion. Finally, by using ADP receptor blockade we confirm that NPP4 mediates platelet aggregation via release of ADP from Ap3A and activation of ADP receptors. Collectively, these studies define the biologic and enzymatic basis for NPP4 and Ap3A activity in platelet aggregation in vitro and suggest that NPP4 promotes hemostasis in vivo by augmenting ADP-mediated platelet aggregation at the site of vascular injury.

INPP is the only nuclear plant in Lithuania. It comprises two RBMK-1500 reactors. After Lithuania has restored its independence, responsibility for Ignalina NPP was transferred to the Republic of Lithuania. To ensure the control of the Nuclear Safety in Lithuania, The State Nuclear Power Safety Inspectorate (VATESI) was created on 18 October 1991, by a resolution of the Lithuanian Government. Significant workmoreÂ Â» has been performed over the last decade, aiming at upgrading the safety level of the Ignalina NPP with reference to the International standards. On 5 October 1999 the Seimas (Parliament) adopted the National Energy Strategy: It has been decided that unit 1 of Ignalina NPP will be closed down before 2005, The conditions and precise final date of the decommissioning of Unit 2 will be stated in the updated National Energy strategy in 2004. On 20-21 June 2000, the International Donors' Conference for the Decommissioning of Ignalina NPP took place in Vilnius. More than 200 Millions Euro were pledged of which 165 M funded directly from the European Union's budget, as financial support to the Decommissioning projects. The Decommissioning Program encompasses legal, organizational, financial and technical means including the social and economical impacts in the region of Ignalina. The Program is financed from International Support Fund, State budget, National Decommissioning Fund of Ignalina NPP and other funds. Decommissioning of Ignalina NPP is subject to VATESI license according to the Law on Nuclear Energy. The Government established the licensing procedure in the so-called 'Procedure for licensing of Nuclear Activities'; and the document 'General Requirements for Decommissioning of the Ignalina NPP' has been issued by\n\nAssessment of NPP VIIRS Ocean Color Data Products: Hope and Risk\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nTurpie, Kevin R.; Meister, Gerhard; Eplee, Gene; Barnes, Robert A.; Franz, Bryan; Patt, Frederick S.; Robinson, Wayne d.; McClain, Charles R.\n\n2010-01-01\n\nFor several years, the NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) NPP VIIRS Ocean Science Team (VOST) provided substantial scientific input to the NPP project regarding the use of Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) to create science quality ocean color data products. This work has culminated into an assessment of the NPP project and the VIIRS instrument's capability to produce science quality Ocean Color data products. The VOST concluded that many characteristics were similar to earlier instruments, including SeaWiFS or MODIS Aqua. Though instrument performance and calibration risks do exist, it was concluded that programmatic and algorithm issues dominate concerns. Keywords: NPP, VIIRS, Ocean Color, satellite remote sensing, climate data record.\n\nCharacterization and Performance of the Suomi-NPP VIIRS Solar Diffuser Stability Monitor\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nFulbright, Jon P.; Ning, Lei; Kwofu, Chiang; Xiaoxiong, Xiong\n\n2012-01-01\n\nWe describe the on-orbit characterization and performance of the Solar Diffuser Stability Monitor (SDSM) on-board Suomi-NPP/VIIRS. This description includes the observing procedure of each SDSM event, the algorithms used to generate the Solar Diffuser degradation corrective factors, and the results for the mission to date. We will also compare the performance of the VIIRS SDSM and SD to the similar components operating on the MODIS instrument on the EOS Terra and Aqua satellites\n\nMODIS GPP/NPP for complex land use area: a case study of comparison between MODIS GPP/NPP and ground-based measurements over Korea\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nShim, C.\n\n2013-12-01\n\nThe Moderate Resolution Imaging Radiometer (MODIS) Gross Primary Productivity (GPP)/Net Primary Productivity (NPP) has been widely used for the study on global terrestrial ecosystem and carbon cycle. The current MODIS product with ~ 1 km spatial resolution, however, has limitation on the information on local scale environment (< 1km), particularly on the regions with complex land-use types. Here we try to test the performance of MODIS annual GPP/NPP for a case of Korea, where the vegetation types are mostly heterogeneous within a size of MODIS products (~1km). We selected the sites where the ground/tower flux measurements and MODIS retrievals were simultaneously available and the land classification of sites agreed the forest type map (~71m) (1 site over Gwangneung flux tower (GDK) for 2006-2008 and 2 sites of ground measurements over Cheongju (CJ1 and CJ2) for 2011). The MODIS GPP are comparable to that of GDK (largely deciduous forest) within -6.3 ~ +2.3% of bias (-104.5 - 37.9 gCm-2yr-1). While the MODIS NPP of CJ1 at Cheongju (largely Larix leptolepis) underestimated NPP by 34% (-224.5 gCm-2yr-1), the MODIS NPP of CJ2 (largely Pinus densiflora) agreed well with -0.2% of bias (1.6 gCm-2yr-1). The fairly comparable values of the MODIS here however, cannot assure the quality of the MOD17 over the complex vegetation area of Korea since the ground measurements except the eddy covariance tower flux measurements are highly inconsistent. Therefore, the comprehensive experiments to represents GPP/NPP over diverse vegetation types for a comparable scale of MODIS with a consistent measurement technique are necessary in order to evaluate the MODIS vegetation productivity data over Korea, which contains a large portion of highly heterogeneous vegetation area.\n\nA Model-based Approach to Scaling GPP and NPP in Support of MODIS Land Product Validation\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nTurner, D. P.; Cohen, W. B.; Gower, S. T.; Ritts, W. D.\n\n2003-12-01\n\nGlobal products from the Earth-orbiting MODIS sensor include land cover, leaf area index (LAI), FPAR, 8-day gross primary production (GPP), and annual net primary production (NPP) at the 1 km spatial resolution. The BigFoot Project was designed specifically to validate MODIS land products, and has initiated ground measurements at 9 sites representing a wide array of vegetation types. An ecosystem process model (Biome-BGC) is used to generate estimates of GPP and NPP for each 5 km x 5 km BigFoot site. Model inputs include land cover and LAI (from Landsat ETM+), daily meteorological data (from a centrally located eddy covariance flux tower), and soil characteristics. Model derived outputs are validated against field-measured NPP and flux tower-derived GPP. The resulting GPP and NPP estimates are then aggregated to the 1 km resolution for direct spatial comparison with corresponding MODIS products. At the high latitude sites (tundra and boreal forest), the MODIS GPP phenology closely tracks the BigFoot GPP, but there is a high bias in the MODIS GPP. In the temperate zone sites, problems with the timing and magnitude of the MODIS FPAR introduce differences in MODIS GPP compared to the validation data at some sites. However, the MODIS LAI/FPAR data are currently being reprocessed (=Collection 4) and new comparisons will be made for 2002. The BigFoot scaling approach permits precise overlap in spatial and temporal resolution between the MODIS products and BigFoot products, and thus permits the evaluation of specific components of the MODIS NPP algorithm. These components include meteorological inputs from the NASA Data Assimilation Office, LAI and FPAR from other MODIS algorithms, and biome-specific parameters for base respiration rate and light use efficiency.\n\nNPP estimation and seasonal change research of Gansu province in northwest China\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHan, Tao; Wang, Dawei; Hao, Xiaocui; Jiang, Youyan\n\n2018-03-01\n\nBased on GIS and remote sensing technology, this paper estimates the NPP of the 2015 year-round and every season of Gansu province in northwest China by using the CASA(Carnegie Ames Stanford Approach) light energy utilization model. The result shows that the total annual NPP of Gansu province gradually decline from southeast to northwest in the space, which is in accordance with the water and heat condition in Gansu province. The results show that the summer NPP in Gansu Province is the maximum in each season. The maximum value of summer NPP in Gansu Province reached 695 (gCm-2â¢season-1), and the maximum value was 473 in spring, and 288 in the autumn, and the NPP in the winter in Gansu province were under 60. The fluctuation range of NPP value is large, this is due to the diversity of ecosystem types in Gansu province, including desert, grassland, farmland and forest, among them, the grassland area is the largest, and the grassland type is very diverse, the grassland coverage is obviously different, especially the low coverage grassland growth is affected by precipitation and temperature and other meteorological factors obviously.\n\nApplication of MÃ¶ssbauer spectroscopy on corrosion products of NPP\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDekan, J.; Lipka, J.; SlugeÅ, V.\n\n2013-04-01\n\nSteam generator (SG) is generally one of the most important components at all nuclear power plants (NPP) with close impact to safe and long-term operation. Material degradation and corrosion/erosion processes are serious risks for long-term reliable operation. Steam generators of four VVER-440 units at nuclear power plants V-1 and V-2 in Jaslovske Bohunice (Slovakia) were gradually changed by new original \"Bohunice\" design in period 1994-1998, in order to improve corrosion resistance of SGs. Corrosion processes before and after these design and material changes in Bohunice secondary circuit were studied using MÃ¶ssbauer spectroscopy during last 25 years. Innovations in the feed water pipeline design as well as material composition improvements were evaluated positively. MÃ¶ssbauer spectroscopy studies of phase composition of corrosion products were performed on real specimens scrapped from water pipelines or in form of filters deposits. Newest results in our long-term corrosion study confirm good operational experiences and suitable chemical regimes (reduction environment) which results mostly in creation of magnetite (on the level 70 % or higher) and small portions of hematite, goethite or hydrooxides. Regular observation of corrosion/erosion processes is essential for keeping NPP operation on high safety level. The output from performed material analyses influences the optimisation of operating chemical regimes and it can be used in optimisation of regimes at decontamination and passivation of pipelines or secondary circuit components. It can be concluded that a longer passivation time leads more to magnetite fraction in the corrosion products composition.\n\nTegumental Phosphodiesterase SmNPP-5 Is a Virulence Factor for Schistosomes â¿\n\nPubMed Central\n\nBhardwaj, Rita; Krautz-Peterson, Greice; Da'dara, Akram; Tzipori, Saul; Skelly, Patrick J.\n\n2011-01-01\n\nThe intravascular trematode Schistosoma mansoni is a causative agent of schistosomiasis, a disease that constitutes a major health problem globally. In this study we cloned and characterized the schistosome tegumental phosphodiesterase SmNPP-5 and evaluated its role in parasite virulence. SmNPP-5 is a 52.5-kDa protein whose gene is rapidly turned on in the intravascular parasitic life stages, following invasion of the definitive host. Highest expression is found in mated adult males. As revealed by immunofluorescence analysis, SmNPP-5 protein is found prominently in the dorsal surface of the tegument of males. Localization by immuno-electron microscopy illustrates a unique pattern of immunogold-labeled SmNPP-5 within the tegument; some immunogold particles are scattered throughout the tissue, but many are clustered in tight arrays. To determine the importance of the protein for the parasites, RNA interference (RNAi) was employed to knock down expression of the SmNPP-5-encoding gene in schistosomula and adult worms. Both quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and Western blotting confirmed successful and robust gene suppression. In addition, the suppression and the ectolocalization of this enzyme in live parasites were evident because of a significantly impaired ability of the suppressed parasites to hydrolyze exogenously added phosphodiesterase substrate p-nitrophenyl 5â²-dTMP (p-Nph-5â²-TMP). The effects of suppressing expression of the SmNPP-5 gene in vivo were tested by injecting parasites into mice. It was found that, unlike controls, parasites whose SmNPP-5 gene was demonstrably suppressed at the time of host infection were greatly impaired in their ability to establish infection. These results demonstrate that SmNPP-5 is a virulence factor for schistosomes.

Some features of aerosol behavior in severe NPP accidents are briefly described.Â«Â less\n\nSatellite Supported Estimates of Human Rate of NPP Carbon Use on Land: Challenges Ahead\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nImhoff, M. L.; Bounoua, L.; Zhang, P.; Wolfe, R. E.\n\n2010-12-01\n\nThe human demand for products of photosynthesis is a powerful measure of the aggregate impact of human action on the biosphere and indicator of societal vulnerability to climate change. We show results from several studies that use satellite and statistical data to estimate the amount of Earthâs net primary production (NPP) on land required to support regional and global use of food, fiber and NPP-based fuel pro"
