That is the start of our\n\nnine-day gun season for deer. No estimates are offered as to how\n\nmany quail hunters will be out the same day, since this coming\n\nSaturday also is the start of that season west of Interstate High-\n\nway 35. It would be a very good idea for bird hunters to wear\n\nblaze orange this Saturday.\n\nLooking at deer season first, harvest figures for gun season\n\nare expected to be good this year. The Oklahoma Department of\n\nWildlife Conservation reports archery and muzzleloader\n\nhunters took more deer on their respective opening weekends\n\nthan they did last year. This is felt to be an indicator of good deer\n\npopulations, and similar increases in opening weekend kills by\n\ngun hunters are expected.\n\nThe time is right for bucks to be in rut, as the decreasing\n\ndaylight and a touch of winter in the morning air cause them to\n\nseek female companionship. Bucks will stake out territories and\n\ndefend them from other males. Savvy hunters will be looking for\n\nsuch deer sign as large areas scraped bare by bucks advertising\n\ntheir presence to any interested doe.\n\nOf course, the rutting season gives the hunter his best\n\nchance to put some meat in the freezer, since the bucks loose a\n\nbit of their wariness while seeking mates. In fact, they some-\n\ntimes act a bit like human teenagers. In persuing the interests of\n\ndefending territory and finding a doe, an otherwise sensible,\n\nwary buck can bristle at the least provocation or come running\n\nto anything which says \"female\" to him. That’s why hunters\n\nlike to rattle antlers or wear deer musk scents at this time of\n\nyear.\n\nRead the hunting regulations and buy your deer tag before\n\ngoing into the woods this Saturday. And most of all, be alert for\n\nearly morning quail hunters who might be ignorant enough to\n\nwear brown clothing afield.\n\nIndications from the Wildlife Department are that bird\n\nhunters can expect a good crop of quail this year. For the past 15\n\nyears. Sooner quail hunters have averaged more than 20 birds\n\nper season and most of these are taken during the first few days\n\nof season. With this year’s improved bird population, nimrods\n\nhunting the west of 1-35 opener may have little trouble keeping\n\nthis record alive.\n\nHeavy spring rains reportedly devastated first hatches this\n\nyear, but the birds responded with large late batches to end up\n\nwith a larger population than last year. A few areas are not\n\nexpected to fare as well, but superior hunting is expected state-\n\nwide.\n\nEarly checks on quail in this vicinity showed good\n\npopulations in most areas. When bowhunting season rolled\n\naround, rechecking some areas resulted in seeing fewer coveys.\n\nHowever, the numbers of birds still were high, as the individual\n\ncoveys were larger and often reached 18 or 20 birds each.\n\nThose coveys jumped during archery deer season were\n\nsocked into the most gosh-awful cover a creek bottom could\n\noffer. The lone exception to that rule was the covey I found in the\n\ngrass just 10 yards from heavy cover. When flushed, these birds\n\nwent straight down the creek and hooked into the thick stuff. If\n\never there was a year for needing a dog with a good nose, this is\n\nit. Of course, bobwhites could be sitting in the wide open spaces\n\nby this coming Saturday, but I wouldn’t count on it.\n\nRemember that hunting on the east side of I-35 does not open\n\nuntil Thursday, November 25. Stay to the west of that roadway\n\nto stay legal. Complete regulations are available at most\n\nsporting goods and license dealers.\n\nIMAA,\n\nDel\n\n! wel\n\nLEAVING SATURDAY for the midwest division area basket-\n\nball throw playoffs at Dallas will be three from Noble County\n\nFamily YMCA.
