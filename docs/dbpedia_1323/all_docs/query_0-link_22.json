        "text": "HOWDY. It’s Sarah Wheaton with you again today. Eddy Wax will be in the driving seat for the rest of the week. We’ve written an entire edition of Brussels Playbook for you this Wednesday, but honestly, everything can be pretty much summed up in a few numbers:\n\n350 — The number of MEPs committed to voting for a second term for Commission President Ursula von der Leyen from the centrist coalition of the European People’s Party, Renew and the Socialists & Democrats, according to former ALDE boss Jacob Moroza-Rasmussen. Von der Leyen needs 361.\n\n43,252,003,274,489,856,000 — The number of permutations of a Rubik’s Cube, according to a New York Times piece marking the 50th birthday of the puzzle Hungary has chosen as a symbol of its Council presidency. We figure it’s also roughly half the number of ways Prime Minister Viktor Orbán could antagonize the Ixelles intelligentsia.\n\n45 percent to 47 percent: How U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris would fare against Donald Trump in a presidential election, according to a new CNN poll — compared to 43-49 for the incumbent, Joe Biden.\n\n**A message from Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance supported by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation: Between 2000 and 2020, Gavi protected one billion children from vaccine-preventable diseases. With the EU’s support, we can make our world safer by protecting more children against more diseases, faster than ever before.**\n\nDRIVING THE DAY: POLITICAL SACRIFICES\n\nTACTICAL RETREATS: Politicians in France and the U.S. are facing calls to sacrifice their ambitions and/or egos to reduce the chances of right-wing populists taking power. In France on Tuesday, hundreds of left-wing and centrist candidates dropped out of the second round of the high-stakes legislative election in a coordinated attempt to stop Marine Le Pen’s National Rally winning an outright majority (more on that below). In Washington, the calculation is much more complicated …\n\nIS THE BIDEN DAM BREAKING? The White House’s damage-control efforts appear to be failing, with more and more Democrats publicly pushing Biden to step aside after his disastrous debate performance, our Stateside colleague Jared Mitovich reports. More than two dozen Democratic governors are seeking a meeting with Biden as soon as today, Elena Schneider writes.\n\nNo taboo in Europe: While Dems in the U.S. have long been hesitant to break ranks, liberal and left-leaning allies on the Continent haven’t felt so restrained. “Changing horses is a duty for everyone,” tweeted ex-Italian PM Matteo Renzi a day after the debate, and Polish Foreign Minister Radek Sikorski said it’s “important to manage one’s ride into the sunset.”\n\nDisillusioned activists abroad: “There’s a high level of concern,” said Trip DuBard, chair of Democrats Abroad Belgium. Members’ feelings run the gamut, DuBard told Playbook. Some blame Biden’s staff and the debate moderators or brush it all off as a bad day. Some think it’d be downright dangerous to swap candidates this late in the game. Others say it’s time for the president to step aside so someone else can run.\n\n“Up until this weekend”: Speaking solely for himself, DuBard said Tuesday that he’s fallen into the latter camp: “I was totally behind him, all up until this weekend. The debate — it took me a while to sort of digest it and think about it, and look at his reactions to some of the questions. And yeah, I don’t think he’s our guy.”\n\nView from a distance: A South Carolina native who moved to Belgium in 2016, DuBard said the stakes feel different from this side of the Atlantic Ocean. “We’re a lot closer to Ukraine and Russia” than Stateside voters, he said. The rise of the far right in the U.S. doesn’t seem like “such a far-fetched idea” after watching what’s happened in Hungary, France and the Netherlands.\n\nFrustration boiling over: “I’m sort of disappointed in our party’s leadership. I think we need to change,” DuBard said. Again, he was speaking as an individual — not as the chair of Democrats Abroad Belgium — and he stressed that he’ll keep working to elect Biden and defeat Trump. But if this is how the activists responsible for driving turnout are feeling, it’s safe to predict that Biden has more bad nights ahead in his future, including November 5.\n\nWHAT WASHINGTON’S TALKING ABOUT TODAY: The New York Times published a big piece overnight on Biden’s condition which claims that the confusion and lethargy he displayed in last week’s TV debate was evident on his recent trips to Europe for the D-Day commemorations and G7. Although Biden was at times sharp, the report says, there were also moments when he seemed disoriented. An unnamed senior official at the G7 said there had been a “noticeable decline” in Biden’s physical state since previous meetings, which “shocked” the Europeans.\n\nANTI-NATIONALISTS RALLY IN FRANCE: Meanwhile in France, at least 200 candidates from both the left-wing alliance and the centrist coalition of President Emmanuel Macron pulled out of local races ahead of last night’s crucial deadline to rally behind their best-placed rivals and block the National Rally in runoffs, according to estimates from AFP and Le Monde. Their decisions could determine the outcome of the second-round vote on Sunday — and whether France will have a far-right government for the first time in the modern republic’s history, Giorgio Leali reports.\n\nPitching out the spoilers: After the wave of tactical withdrawals, less than 100 districts will see three candidates in the second round. A party needs 289 seats for an absolute majority.\n\nURSULA 2024\n\nVON DER LEYEN’S 4-LETTER WORD: “Good” was the only word Ursula von der Leyen had to describe her closed-door meeting with the European Parliament’s political groups as she left the meeting and was doorstepped by Playbook’s Eddy Wax on Tuesday. She then swiftly got into a lift — which had been blocked so that it would stay open and waiting for her — with her chief aide and bodyguards. A two-week countdown for von der Leyen to get the numbers she needs is now starting before a vote in Parliament tentatively scheduled for mid-July.\n\nSocial-lists: Von der Leyen set out her broad policy priorities to the heads of the political groups at that one-hour meeting. Speaking to a huddle of journalists after leaving the room, a beaming S&D President Iratxe García said: “The music sounds OK but now we have to go into the details.” The Spaniard said she insisted on social and gender equality policies in her speech, and a “clear commitment” about the Green agenda.\n\nA Green fourth pillar? Greens Co-President Bas Eickhout popped out from behind a pillar to speak to the same huddle of journalists: “If you just do the counting, if S&D and Renew are saying don’t do it with ECR, then there’s only one possibility to get to a stable majority, and that’s with the Greens. That’s no rocket science.”\n\nMath lesson: He warned von der Leyen off from the ECR, where Giorgia Meloni’s MEPs sit. “She is playing a dangerous game the moment she starts to shop a bit around in ECR because you might win 25 from, for example, the Italian delegation and you lose 20 from the S&D delegation, potentially,” the Dutchman said. “If she is building on a broader majority with more political groups, then I think she has a good chance,” he added.\n\nPRIORITIES: Von der Leyen will not attend the NATO summit in Washington next week, Commission spokesperson Eric Mamer said, “instead focusing on her work to build a majority for a strong Europe in the European Parliament.”\n\nUKRAINE\n\nSPLITTING THE $50B LOAN: You know that friend who heads to the toilet just as the waiter brings the bill? That’s how Uncle Sam is behaving with the G7’s $50 billion loan to Ukraine, outspoken EU diplomats would say. There’s no agreement on how much the U.S. should contribute, and the topic is set to dominate talks today among treasury chiefs from G7 countries, Gregorio Sorgi reports.\n\nWho pays what? G7 leaders agreed in June that they would each channel their own loan to Ukraine — to be repaid by the annual profits generated by Russia’s immobilized assets by the end of the year. But Washington still has to make up its mind over how much it can contribute, said an EU official who was granted anonymity to discuss sensitive talks.\n\nThe tricky part: The U.S. needs Congress’ approval for an operation that carries a risk to its taxpayers. But there’s little appetite to involve lawmakers because opposition among Republicans might drag the process out beyond the end-of-year deadline.\n\nBottom line: The EU floated several options to limit Washington’s exposure to risk. Yet there’s only so much technocrats can do — their political masters have the final say over how much each country can give to Ukraine.\n\nPOLL — EUROPEANS MORE PESSIMISTIC: This type of wrangling over Ukraine aid is clearly affecting Europeans’ expectations about how the war will end. Results of a survey of 14 EU countries published today — conducted in May after Washington finally passed a crucial Ukraine funding bill — found a dour outlook about Kyiv’s chances.\n\nExpecting a settlement: Europeans tend to believe that Ukraine won’t defeat Russia on the battlefield, with roughly a third to half of those surveyed believing the war will end in a negotiated settlement, and up to 31 percent in some countries (Greece) seeing a Russian victory as most likely.\n\nCompare that to Ukraine, where 58 percent remain confident their troops can win, and that they can continue to count on the support of their international allies. Elena Giordano has more on the European Council on Foreign Relations poll.\n\nNO POLL NEEDED: Viktor Orbán’s visit to Kyiv on Tuesday might have been a surprise, but his stance wasn’t. The Hungarian PM reiterated his proposal for an immediate cease-fire, an idea that was immediately rejected by his host, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Csongor Körömi reports for POLITICO.\n\nANTI-NATO SUMMIT IN ASTANA: Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Beijing bestie Xi Jinping are in Astana, Kazakhstan today for the annual meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, aka the anti-NATO summit. The Guardian has a curtain-raiser.\n\n**As the U.K. gears up for a general election on July 4, stay on top of the latest news, polls and key players to watch. Read all about it here.**\n\nGOING DUTCH\n\nGRAB YOUR STROOPWAFEL AND GET COMFY: Two marathon debate days await new Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof today and Thursday in the parliament, Koen Verhelst writes in to report. Schoof (pronounced like “oaf” not “aloof”) is the first new Dutch prime minister in 14 years.\n\nWait, remind me: Schoof is an independent PM leading a four-way coalition in the hardest right government the Netherlands have ever seen. Geert Wilders’ radical-right Freedom Party, center-right liberal VVD, centrist NSC and farmers’-right party BBB make up the new kabinet Schoof.\n\nCarpaccio and goals: The new governing group of 16 ministers and 13 deputy ministers were all sworn in Tuesday. They met the Dutch and international press in The Hague, enjoying carpaccio with truffle mayo, salmon steak and white chocolate cream desserts. As the ministers trickled into a tent set up in the garden of the Catshuis — potentially Schoof’s residence — the gathered crowd watched the Dutch soccer team score three goals against Romania at the European Championships in Germany.\n\nIn the morning, reality hits: It’s now up to them to turn the short political agreement reached by the four party leaders into actual policy that works in the Netherlands and in Brussels. Eva Hartog and Koen explain how we got here.\n\nFAILED DIPLOMACY DEPT.\n\nFROM BAD … Germany’s Olaf Scholz fails to announce compensation plan for Polish survivors of Nazi crimes\n\n… TO WORSE: Poland’s Donald Tusk rails at fractured defense planning in jibe at Germany’s Scholz\n\nAROUND EUROPE\n\nNO SEAT FOR YOU: Catalan separatist politician Toni Comín was reelected to the European Parliament in last month’s election, but he won’t be seated anytime soon. On Tuesday the European Parliament said it would not allow the MEP to take his seat until his election was confirmed by Spain’s Central Electoral Board. That body is refusing to do so until Comín travels to Madrid to swear to uphold the country’s constitution. Yet the Junts politician has been on the run from authorities since 2017, following the Catalan independence referendum, so Comín’s not goin’ to Madrid.\n\nAlso unseated: Socialist MEP-elect Alicia Homs — who replaces Spanish deputy prime minister and presumed commissioner candidate Teresa Ribera on the list — also did not travel to Madrid to take the vow because she is pregnant and lives in the Balearic Islands. She was, however, allowed to carry out the procedure at the provincial electoral board’s office; her name will be sent on to the Parliament shortly.\n\nUK ELECTION EXPLAINED: Britain braces for a pivotal election clash between the Conservatives and Labour. Matt Honeycombe-Foster created an American’s guide to the upcoming U.K. election.\n\nFAREWELL TO RISHI SUNAK: His tenure was marked by turmoil and missteps. How will the fifth Tory prime minister in eight years be remembered? Tanya Gold looks back at Sunak’s rise and leadership style.\n\nAGENDA\n\n— ECR, ID and the Left hold their constitutive meetings in Parliament.\n\n— S&D MEPs meet to adopt their “key demands” for the next five years.\n\n— EU ambassadors meet in Coreper II at 9:30 a.m. … EU deputy ambassadors meet at Coreper I at 11 a.m.\n\n— Weekly European Commission College meeting.\n\n— European Commission Executive Vice President Maroš Šefčovič delivers a keynote speech at the European Initiative for Energy Security; receives CEOs of companies in the Renewable Hydrogen Coalition.\n\n— Innovation Commissioner Iliana Ivanova is in Montréal, Canada; attends a working lunch hosted by Canada’s Innovation Minister François-Philippe Champagne; will sign Canada’s association agreement to Horizon Europe.\n\n— Home Affairs Commissioner Ylva Johansson is in Lisbon, Portugal, and gives an address at the launch of the European Union Drugs Agency.\n\n— Commissioner Kadri Simson is in Buenos Aires, Argentina; delivers a speech at the Energy Transition and Green Hydrogen Dialogue meeting; meets Argentina’s Economy Minister Luis Caputo.\n\n— European Parliament President Roberta Metsola is in Lisbon, Portugal, where she will meet Prime Minister Luís Montenegro.\n\n**As France decides, trust POLITICO’s Paris-based newsroom to keep you ahead.

It has also been updated to remove erroneous information about MEP-elect Alicia Homs’ ability to claim her seat in the European Parliament without traveling to Madrid to swear to uphold the Spanish constitution. She can carry out the procedure at a provincial office of the relevant authority near her home in the Balearic Islands.\n\n**A message from Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance supported by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation: Between 2000 and 2020, Gavi protected one billion children from vaccine-preventable diseases, saving 17 million lives and generating US$220 billion in economic benefits in lower-income countries. With continued support from the EU Institutions and Team Europe, we can reach the next billion in half the time. Protecting more children against more diseases, faster than ever before, means keeping our world safe from infectious diseases. It means helping countries become self-sufficient and less dependent on aid. It means giving hope and opportunity to millions. Immunisation is one of the best buys in development, and as a donor to Gavi since 2003, the EU has been critical in this success. Continued support from the European Commission and Member States means we can immunise a further 500 million children, saving over eight million lives.
