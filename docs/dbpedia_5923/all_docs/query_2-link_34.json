        "text": "There are a couple of things to respond to. The first is that, as the Member knows, the investment for the Alex has been prioritised. It's a partnership looking not just with the health board, but with others too, and different sources of funding. We need to see the revised business case to come back to us for us to approve it.\n\nIt's also the case, and let's just make this point clear, that the reason why we could not spend all the money we had during the pandemic was because the Conservative Chief Secretary to the Treasury, at a time of extraordinary crisis with dealing with the pandemic, chose to take money back in a way that was quite extraordinary. And it was because of what UK Government departments were not able to do at the time. Because we had been prudent with the way we had managed our money, it meant that we could not roll over money in a way that was entirely normal for UK Government departments. If he's angry about this, he should take it out on Steve Barclay for the choices he made as Chief Secretary to the Treasury. It's another example where fairness in the way money works across the UK will mean a much better deal for us here in Wales.\n\nAnd the final point, just to go back to the conversation we're having about social care, social care is a profession of choice for a number of people. We need more people who want to work in that sector of and for itself. There is a relationship with the health service, and part of the reason why Ysbyty Glan Clwyd has such a challenge in its front door performance for emergency admissions is not just the really good work that's taking—. The average triage time in Glan Clwyd is actually 20 minutes, so you're seen and triaged really quite quickly. The challenge is, for people who aren't urgent, they need to wait a long time; the biggest reason for that is there are far too many people in an NHS bed when it's no longer the right place for their care. That is a risk for the person who is in an NHS bed to get deconditioned. There's also the potential for healthcare-acquired infections, and, actually, they need to be in a different part of our health and care system for their almost always ongoing care, treatment and support. If we can unlock that with partners across social care, it'll make a big difference for people in the wrong place for their care, in a hospital bed when they shouldn't be, as well as those people at the front door of a hospital and, much more importantly, people in the community who we can't get to because we don't have enough flow going through our hospitals. It's part of what we need, it's part of what investment and reform for the future mean. That's why I'm very proud we're standing on a manifesto to not just put more money into the health service, but to continue on the never-ending journey of reform and improvement right across our health and care system.\n\nFormal consultation between Tata Steel UK and the UK steel committee, which, as Members know, is made up of the three steel unions, Community, Unite and GMB, concluded in April. Discussions have since been ongoing between the company and the UK steel committee over voluntary redundancy packages, which Tata state are the best severance terms that they have offered to employees.\n\nThe company confirmed in April its timeline to decommission blast furnace 5 at the end of June, followed by decommissioning of blast furnace 4 by the end of September. Tata reiterated publicly in June that it intends to continue with the announced closure of the heavy-end assets and restructuring programme at Port Talbot in the coming months. They've also said that the current heavy-end assets are nearing their end of life, are operationally unstable and are resulting in what they describe as unsustainable financial losses. The coke ovens, a critical facility for primary steel making, were closed in March, as operations became infeasible and unsafe. Our understanding is that Tata will continue with its plans to decommission blast furnace 5 this week, by 7 July. We believe the prospect of the election of a new UK Government later this week changes completely the context for steel production in the UK, with specific funding for steel and broader commitments to invest in infrastructure.\n\nTata has already said that, as part of the £1.25 billion plan, to be able to meet its customer needs during the three-year transition to electric arc furnace steel making, and continue production at their downstream sites, it will be reliant on imports from overseas. The transition's full impact on volumes across all Tata sites in Wales, not only at Port Talbot, but the downstream plants based at Llanwern, Trostre, Shotton and Caerphilly, are still unclear, and clarity must be given as soon as possible. Going forward, we need to see a clear vision from the company that will involve significant investment in all sites, and one that continues to harness the innovation within our universities. Tata has previously announced that up to 2,800 jobs are expected to be lost as part of its transition plan, with the first redundancies expected in September. We will continue our work with the Tata transition board to swiftly put in place the mechanisms that will allow Tata employees and businesses within its supply chain, families and communities to access all available support. I am committing to doing all I can to ensure that the work of the transition board is as flexible as possible and fit for purpose to support the needs of workers, the supply chain and the wider community at this time.\n\nThe transition board has agreed five priority areas for support. These cover job matching, skills and employability, the establishment of a supply chain transition fund, as well as a business growth and start-up fund, and, crucially, support for mental health and well-being, and for regeneration projects. The Welsh Government is already making available support through its employability and upskilling programmes, ReAct+ and Communities for Work+, which can provide support for training and mentoring to Tata and its supply chain for employees who wish to remain in the labour market. Business Wales and the Development Bank of Wales can provide support for individuals facing redundancy should they wish to consider self-employment or to start their own business, and can provide information, advice and guidance on starting a business, as well as accessing business finance. Drop-in sessions take place in Port Talbot twice a week, with advisers from the Department for Work and Pensions, Careers Wales, Business Wales, Citizens Advice, Neath Port Talbot Council and NPTC Group of Colleges on hand to answer concerns and questions. Job fairs are under way, with the latest held on 12 June, and workshops are planned for Tata workers throughout July. In addition, a webpage is now available on the Neath Port Talbot Council website, which provides a one-stop shop, single point of contact for everyone seeking help and advice. The webpage signposts links for both individuals and businesses to all available support. It is important that those who need to access the support can do so swiftly, and I will work in earnest with any new, incoming UK Government and all local stakeholders to ensure that support is accessible to those who need it.\n\nWe want to see a viable future for a green steel industry in south Wales, and the tensions over the last few days have highlighted the high stakes that are at play. I am grateful that all involved have chosen to de-escalate matters to avert an immediate crisis. Our aim as a Welsh Government is now to continue to work together with the unions, with Tata and with a new UK Government to fight for and achieve the very best for our steel communities.\n\nWe certainly welcome the de-escalation and the goodwill shown by both Tata Steel and the steelworkers' unions over the last few days, and we are thankful that Tata have decided not to close the second blast furnace early, following the news that Unite have called off their strike action. An early closure would clearly have been bad news for Welsh steel production, for the workers and for the communities. We also, naturally, welcome any discussions that bring both the steelworkers and Tata to the table to safeguard how jobs can be supported in the short and medium terms, as early closure of the blast furnaces would bring additional distress to families already dealing with increased anxiety. The impact that this turbulence in Port Talbot will have had on individuals, families and the wider communities cannot be underestimated. Our position remains clear: we wish to see Tata continue to operate a blast furnace as they justly transition to an electric arc furnace, allowing for skills to be retained in the area and for jobs to be kept. So, while blast furnace 5 will be producing its last steel by the end of this week, we can hope that these most recent talks can lead to strengthened transitionary arrangements.\n\nWith one furnace closing, we need to focus now on what's next for Welsh steelworkers. Cabinet Secretary, you've confirmed to me via a written question that the total value of the Tata Steel skills support programme 2016-19 was £11.7 million—very welcome. But can you offer any clarity on whether the skills acquired via training paid for via this fund are skills that have wider accreditation, or are these skills that are nontransferable and can only be used at Tata's facilities? We can have some hope that the transition to an electric arc furnace, alongside the developments of the Celtic free port, can provide much-needed employment for those who may lose their jobs at Tata, whether it be in construction, in operations or in maintenance. You mentioned in your statement the voluntary redundancy offers given to workers, but I'd ask you, Cabinet Secretary, if you have any idea on the numbers of people that will, or potentially, accept this offer?\n\nA common theme brought forward during the discussion around the future of steel making in Port Talbot is, 'Let's wait for a UK Labour Government. Let's rely on a, potentially, incoming UK Labour Government to help save the day.' You say in your statement that you believe the prospect of the election and a new UK Government later this week changes the context for steel production in the UK, with specific funding for steel and broader commitments to invest in infrastructure. We already know that UK Labour are already counting the UK Conservatives' £500 million investment in Tata in their £3 billion green steel plan. So, from the remaining £2.5 billion, can you confirm how much more is going to go to Port Talbot, should Labour win on Thursday? Otherwise, aren't you just giving false hope to these workers, their families and these communities?\n\nAnd, talking of the transition board, as you did in your statement. You mentioned that you are willing to work with it to give all necessary support to workers, and this is great news. And while the transition board is operated at a UK level, and with the potential of having a new Secretary of State for Wales by the end of this week, can I ask you, Cabinet Secretary, what guarantees you have had for the continued smooth running of the transition board after the general election? The continuation of the board is clearly a vitally important cog in the offer of necessary support to Tata workers and the wider supply chain going forward. I'll reiterate our warm welcome for the pausing of the strikes, the de-escalation of tensions and the recommencement of discussions, but question marks do remain over what actually is going to change here, given Tata's previous indication of its preferred direction of travel. Diolch, Llywydd.\n\nI thank Sam Kurtz for the welcome that he has given to the developments in the last few days. I just would say I don't think it's helpful to talk at this point in terms of false hope. It's a very difficult situation for many thousands of people. I know this will not have been his intention, but I just think we need to have that very much in the centre of our thoughts as we all grapple with what is a very complex and difficult situation, not least from the human perspective.\n\nOn the specific questions that he put to me, in relation to skills support, over the years when we have been approached to support skills development at Tata we've been able to work with Tata to make available the sorts of figures that he has talked about, and indeed other sums in addition to that. They have been a mix of skills support in a more general sense, but also ones that have led to specific accredited qualifications. One of the really important tasks under way at the moment—and I alluded to the five priority areas the transition board has designated as categories for support—is that process of ensuring that those who have developed often very high-level skills within the workplace but don't have a specific accreditation that makes them portable in other contexts are in fact accredited. There is work already under way with further education colleges across south Wales to do that work. So, that process is already in hand, and I think it's a very important part of that process.\n\nIn relation to the voluntary redundancy, I don't have that information. That is information that is being worked through, obviously, with the company. Obviously there have been discussions in relation to the terms of voluntary redundancy, but those discussions haven't been concluded. It's part of the discussions that Tata have said they will continue to have with the unions as a consequence of the announcements in the last few days.\n\nHe makes the point about the funds available. I do think it is important to say that of that £500 million, of course none of that has actually been spent yet, and so it is important to bear that in mind. The nature of the overall commitment that the Labour Party has made, which, taking that sum into account, is a £3 billion commitment, is a matter for negotiation with steel companies. It's not a matter for the Government to dictate how that is spent. We're in a very changed landscape, with the election of a new Labour Government—if that's what we see at the end of the week—with new levels of commitment to infrastructure investment, and so that will need to be a matter for discussion between an incoming Government and Tata and others. The Member shakes his head. I don't think I'm in a position to be lectured about the terms and conditions attached to funding from a Government. I think we are seeing very clearly that more could have been done by the outgoing—I hope—Government in relation the the funding that it has been talking about so loudly for a number of months.\n\nJust to say, finally, Llywydd, if I may, in relation to the transition board, I'm not so sure that any of us who have been participating would regard it particularly as smooth running, but I take the point that the Member makes. I do think there is an opportunity at this point to look at how we can improve the way it is working, so that the sums of money that people have pledged are able to be deployed in the most effective way, in the most responsive way. I think there is an opportunity to look again together—I hope rapidly—at how that can be configured differently to do that work in a way that brings all the partners together, but with that focus on making sure that the support is available as quickly and as usefully as possible.\n\nI welcome the news that Tata is stepping back from its threat to close those blast furnaces early. Had the decision gone ahead, it would have been disastrous. I also would refer to something that the Cabinet Secretary for the economy said in the economy committee last week about making the reinstatement of the transition board and its work a priority once this new UK Labour Government get into place. I have to say I am quite concerned about the progress of the work of the transition board. We've lost time. It's important now that we get back onto that as soon as possible. I do think it's important to remember that the negotiations offered by Tata now going forward are not renegotiations of the proposals on the table. It’s a negotiation on future investment, so the fight to retain those blast furnaces is still ongoing.\n\nLooking at what the Government has said in response, there’s a very valid question here, I think, and that is whether the Government has given up on keeping blast furnace capability at Port Talbot. This statement seems to indicate that that is the case, because there remains this line from Government about the need for negotiation, the need to wait for the UK Labour Government with specific funding for steel. I think Sam Kurtz was right to raise the lack of detail around that £3 billion. I wouldn’t have gone down the route of saying that it’s providing false hope, but what I would say is that giving some security and some indication of what portion of the £3 billion would be allocated to Tata in Port Talbot would provide more hope and provide more security, so some detail on that would be very welcome.\n\nBut Tata have made it clear they won’t renegotiate. The Government talk about the need for good-faith negotiations; well, you can’t have good-faith negotiations if one of the partners isn’t acting in good faith and doesn't meet you in the middle to negotiate, evident by Tata’s statement and how they have treated workers throughout this industrial dispute. Is that why the Cabinet Secretary was unable to answer my question in the economy committee about what the backstop is if negotiations didn’t succeed? Is it because the Government had already given up on renegotiating the proposals on the table for the blast furnaces at Port Talbot?\n\nAnd let’s remember how Tata treated their workers during this dispute. First, they threatened to pull redundancy packages for those who went on strike. They threatened to accelerate closures because workers have stood up for themselves. Unite have told us that the company had called workers into a room for a briefing, only then to attempt to stop them from leaving the room unless they indicated if they were going on strike. That’s not a good-faith actor, and neither it is the actions of a responsible company. I would go as far as to ask the question is that the sort of company we want operating in Wales. Where does Tata fit into the Welsh Government’s fair work and social partnership agenda? Because I’m struggling to see how Tata fits into the Government’s vision on this.\n\nIt’ll be of no surprise to anyone that we remain of the view that if we genuinely want to resolve this crisis—because that’s what this is, it’s a crisis—then nationalisation has to be on the table. And let’s be clear about what we mean. This isn’t about ideology, this is about securing a strategic resource and safeguarding it for the future. It’s about nationalisation as a tool to buy time so that we can make the investment on our own terms, meet the strategic aims of this Government, and not be dictated to by a multinational corporation that doesn’t care about the communities it affects. Once we make that investment, we then have a pathway for a range of possible futures that would otherwise be closed off to us.\n\nWe’ve been clear that a co-operative ownership of the kind that has been very successful in the Basque Country is our preferred option. We’re not talking about Government ownership in perpetuity, but we are clear the Government has a key role in safeguarding and maintaining a stake in this industry. And I have to say, I do find it incredible that as we suggest this as a possible route, the Government does nothing to explore the idea. In fact, it does nothing to explore any idea, and sticks rigidly to the orders that come down from head office in London. Where is the curiosity of the self-styled Welsh Labour Party; where is the ambition? What is the reluctance to explore these ideas? We talk about this Welsh way of doing things, that we think and do things differently in Wales; well, on this issue, I have yet to see that happen.\n\nSo, I return to my original question, asking for honesty from the Government here: have they given up on changing Tata’s proposals? Are they now focused on potential future investment only? Because if the answer is ‘yes’, then it is both Labour and Tory Governments that have presided over the biggest industrial policy failure since the closure of the mines in the 1980s, and further evidence that this country is for sale to the highest bidder.\n\nThank you, Cabinet Secretary, for your statement. Before I start, can I reassure the spokesperson for Plaid Cymru I have not given up on primary steel making in Port Talbot?\n\nThe news last Thursday, let's be honest about it, was devastating to families, steelworkers and communities in Port Talbot and around the wider area. They were left shattered by that news. They didn't know whether they'd have a wage coming in next week and what would be their incomes for the years ahead, even the weeks ahead and the days ahead. What would their lifestyles be? That was fearful for them. I think, to be honest, whilst I recognise the safety arguments, it was reprehensible behaviour by Tata in doing that on the eve of a weekend when when people didn't have an opportunity to actually go about, 'How do we get to talk to the unions or talk to people?' It was disgraceful behaviour, to be honest. As I say, we can only imagine the stress those people went through. We know the difficulties those families face, and the impact it might have had on these people's mental health, at a time when they're already facing uncertainty, to be told that, in fact, it's not October, it's next week. That's frightening for them.\n\nI want to thank you and the First Minister for the efforts I know you put in over the weekend to try and resolve this. I'm very pleased that all parties are now coming back to the table to actually have those discussions. It's critical. I'm conscious that I haven't got as much time to talk about some of the issues as others. So, two quick questions. The transition board, you mentioned it. In my view, it's been eight months and not a penny has been spent. This week actually highlighted how that money needs to be spent to get people in place and supported. So, will you ensure that the transition board not only meets urgently, but we actually get some action out of it and get some money out of it so we can get things going? People can't wait until next year, another six months, for things to happen; they need them happening now. Secondly, I welcome the possible investment of a steel income from the UK Government coming in, and I do hope it's a Labour Government coming in, because they have a commitment to steel. But will you and the First Minister please ensure you have an urgent meeting in the first few days with the next Government to talk about steel's future, and make sure that Port Talbot and steel in Wales are at the top of that agenda in steel's future?\n\nI am determined that every child benefits from the vast opportunities offered by this curriculum. Across the remainder of the Senedd term, this Government, in collaboration with partners and the sector, will put in place a national package of support for the Curriculum for Wales. We will ensure a common foundation of expectations and support, allowing every school to seize the opportunities of the curriculum for their learners.\n\nFirst, we will provide clear detail and approaches for curriculum design, progression and assessment, where leaders have most consistently voiced the need for further clarity. We will work with partners to develop intensive, nationally-available collaborative support for curriculum design, progression and assessment. This programme will build on the lessons from the curriculum design pilot programme, the huge strides made by teachers, and existing effective support in the system. This will start this autumn, and expand over the academic year and into 2025-26.\n\nWe will publish specific tools and templates to give schools a clear process for developing and enhancing their curriculum, regardless of their starting point. This includes further detail on approaches to progression and assessment, including evaluating and communicating the progress learners are making. We will publish the first of these next spring and build on these into the following academic year. We will also help schools see examples of curriculum design, progression and assessment, by promoting and sharing effective practice developed through school-to-school collaboration.\n\nI have spoken before about my commitment to literacy and numeracy. These are fundamental gateways to learning, alongside digital competence, and are mandatory cross-curricular skills. A school’s curriculum is at its best when it allows learners to use, develop and hone these skills, transferring and using them in new, meaningful contexts. This is key to raising standards, so, secondly, we will focus on developing these skills. We will work with partners to develop intensive, nationally-available collaborative support to help embed literacy and numeracy across all areas of the Curriculum for Wales. Again, this will be developed with leaders and teachers, building on what is working well. This will be trialled next academic year and expanded in the following year. We will strengthen our national expectations for these skills by updating the literacy, numeracy and digital competence frameworks and publishing them as statutory guidance. That statutory guidance status will help to support more consistent approaches across Wales.\n\nWe will consult on a revised and strengthened literacy and numeracy framework next year, to be finalised in early 2026, followed later that year by the digital competence framework. We will provide clear national principles about teaching and learning in literacy, numeracy and digital competence, being clear about the building blocks for stronger learning and the high-quality resources that support this. This must follow the evidence. On literacy, for example, that means a clear recognition of the critical importance of phonics, as well as the other essential building blocks of reading.\n\nFinally, we will support practitioners to plan learning within and across the areas of learning and experience. This area-specific support will help professionals plan progression in each area. It will support them to select stretching content and plan the development of relevant knowledge and skills. We will begin to trial this in the next academic year. This support will not materialise overnight, and that’s for good reason. It is critical that we get this additional detail and support right. We know from the experience of other nations that simply providing more and more guidance just overloads teachers without improving standards. It has to be the right type of detail. And it has to be clear and simple. That is why we will work with practitioners, leaders, delivery partners and stakeholders to co-construct the detail of this support.\n\nI want to be clear—none of this takes anything away from those schools who are already realising the curriculum for their children. This is about putting a solid foundation in place for those that need it, not putting a ceiling on the innovation we are already seeing across the country. The Curriculum for Wales is a curriculum of opportunities for all, and I will make sure schools have the tools and confidence they need to make the most of them. Diolch.\n\nThank you, Cabinet Secretary for your statement today. There have been many worrying reports recently about teachers in Wales experiencing high levels of violence and verbal abuse in schools from their pupils and subsequent feelings of abandonment from local authorities when this is raised. The NASUWT's 'Behaviour in Schools' survey has revealed that in the last 12 months nearly 40 per cent of teachers in Wales reported experiencing violence or physical abuse in the classroom; 95 per cent have experienced verbal abuse in the classroom; and 91 per cent claimed that they've been sworn at by pupils. Teachers have also made allegations that they have been shoved or barged, hit or punched, kicked, spat at and headbutted, and some have reported having chairs thrown at them. Firstly, Cabinet Secretary, why do you think this is happening? What, in your mind, has changed so significantly that pupils are acting in this way?\n\nCurriculum reform is all very well, but it's pointless if teachers are experiencing violence from students that is not being dealt with. Anecdotal evidence I have received from several constituents, who work in schools across my region, suggests that one of the major problems secondary schools are facing is the high number of children vaping, and that some children are consuming a whole disposable device a day, which, as you will be aware, can contain up to 20 mg of nicotine, roughly the same amount of nicotine as seen in a packet of strong cigarettes. These constituents have told me how they've observed children becoming very aggressive if the vapes are confiscated, most probably from withdrawal symptoms of nicotine. But, with this in mind, what is being done to investigate this as a problem? The Welsh Government has said that there is a duty on local authorities and schools to ensure schools are a safe environment for all. But, clearly, they are failing. I understand that this problem is not going to go away overnight, but what are your plans for dealing with this?\n\nYou are tinkering with the curriculum, when there are other massive issues that seem to be ignored. You will be aware, Cabinet Secretary, that, in the year ending 2022, 1,175 teachers left the profession in Wales, where only 125 of these were of retirement age. The highest numbers leaving were in science and English, two areas that Wales is really struggling in. Sadly, the number of teachers in Wales has declined by around 2,000 since 2014, the equivalent of around 5 per cent, and we're seeing a decline in the number of teachers teaching subjects that they're actually trained in. For instance, in 2023, only 35 per cent of science teachers were trained in science. And this means, Cabinet Secretary, however you look at it, and despite the best efforts by teachers, that there are many who will lack the fundamental understanding of the subjects that they teach. However, how are you going to account for this in your curriculum reform, when schools are clearly already struggling to teach core subjects now?\n\nYou say about your commitment to literacy and numeracy; well, frankly, this is not being translated into reality. It will also, of course, come as no surprise to you that Programme for International Student Assessment scores declined more in Wales than in any other country— than in most other countries—in 2022, with scores declining by around 20 points, bringing scores in Wales to the lowest ever level, significantly below the average across Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries, and significantly below those seen across the rest of the United Kingdom. Lower scores in Wales, as you will, no doubt, fully appreciate, Cabinet Secretary, cannot be explained by higher levels of poverty. Disadvantaged children in England score around 30 points higher on average than disadvantaged children in Wales. Even more remarkably, the performance of disadvantaged children in England is either above or similar to the average for all children in Wales. The differences in educational performance between England and Wales are unlikely to be explained by differences in resources and spending, because spending per pupil is similar in both nations in terms of current levels and recent trends over time.\n\nWales also has a higher share of young people not in education, employment or training than the rest of the UK: 11 per cent, compared with the 5 per cent to 9 per cent of other nations. And Wales has the lowest levels of participation in higher education, especially among boys. I'm not going to labour this point any further. I think we all understand what I'm saying here, and, Cabinet Secretary, it's not my intention to score any political points from highlighting this. I take no pleasure in pointing out these findings, and it's saddening to stand here and point out how bad the situation is. I believe this Government owes the people of Wales a proper explanation as to why these PISA scores in Wales are declining at this rate. We know that teachers are working harder than ever. We know that it is not the levels of deprivation or the impact of immigration causing these results. The impact of COVID has affected all UK nations but yet, after 25 years of Welsh Labour, we have seen the worst performances of students in reading, science and mathematics in Wales's history. Without any political waffle, Cabinet Secretary, this is nobody else's fault but yours. Can you explain to me why pupils in Wales are struggling so much, compared to every other UK nation? Evidence suggests that it's the general skills based curriculum the Welsh Government is pushing that might be the cause of declining educational performance in Wales. Therefore, the new made-for-Wales GCSEs that are due to be taught in Wales are not actually going to help pupils develop those skills they need to compete against others educated in the UK. You've said in your statement that you want children to reach their full potential, but this is nonsense; you are removing—\n\nThank you very much, Joel, for those comments. I'll do my best to answer what was quite a wide range of remarks. If I can start by saying that, obviously, we want all our schools to be safe, welcoming places for all children and young people and our staff. Local authorities and schools have a responsibility to ensure that schools are safe places for people to work. I'm aware of the NASUWT research that you've referred to, and indeed I discussed school behaviour with them recently, and have also discussed it with other trade unions. It is an area of concern, in terms of—. You're asking me why this is happening. I think that's a really complex question. What is clear to me as Cabinet Secretary is a whole range of societal problems are now playing out in our schools, and that has become worse since the pandemic. I certainly don't think that the curriculum is any cause of that, and indeed I believe that a purpose-driven, engaging curriculum is something that will actually help engage children and young people and improve behaviour in schools.\n\nYou referred specifically to vaping. Obviously, that's a problem that's very much on Welsh Government's radar and we were, prior to the election, working with the UK Government on UK-wide legislation on tobacco and vaping. Unfortunately, that legislation was lost due to the election, although we are committed to banning single-use vapes in Wales. If I can also add that part of our curriculum includes a mandatory area of learning on health and well-being, and we would expect that to cover areas like vaping. We've developed, through Public Health Wales, a vaping toolkit for schools, which has been used in our schools, which I hope is helping with that. I definitely don't think that you can put things like that at the door of tinkering with the curriculum, because what we are doing is certainly not tinkering; it's a very radical reform that develops a purposeful curriculum that helps young people to understand why what they're learning is important and gives them the transferrable skills to apply in other settings and for the rest of their lives.\n\nIn terms of the retention of teachers issue that you raised, clearly, that's a challenge across the UK. That's why we're working so hard on teacher recruitment and retention, why we've got such a strong focus on mental health support for our education workforce, why we have a series of incentives in shortage subjects to attract people to the profession. But I also believe that our new Curriculum for Wales is making teaching in Wales a much more attractive profession for educators. It is next-level teaching and learning. It was teachers who were keen to have that agency in developing the new curriculum that their learners needed, and we are delivering that for them in Wales, along with the support required to do that.\n\nYou referred at some length to the PISA results. If I can remind you that the children and young people who sat the PISA tests were not taught under the new curriculum; they were taught under the current curriculum. Ahead of the pandemic, Wales was the only country in the UK improving standards in literacy, numeracy and science in PISA tests. And it's important to note that most schools and learners opted not to take part in 2022 and that none of the countries in the UK reached the required participation threshold. So, there does need to be some caution when looking at the PISA scores, but, notwithstanding that, I have said that the scores were disappointing, and that is why both I and the First Minister have said that raising attainment is a top priority for this Government.\n\nJust to assure you that we are working hard already on support for literacy and numeracy. Last year, we published our oracy and reading toolkit, co-developed with practitioners, providing a package of support for schools to develop and embed a whole-school approach to achieving high standards of oracy and reading in English and in Welsh. Through annual grant funding, we provide high-quality resources to all children from as young as six months, and their families, aimed at encouraging positive language and literacy interactions through books, stories and games. We've got a number of projects that are designed to promote a love of reading, because all the evidence suggests that enjoying reading is incredibly important for children and young people to learn. And, in terms of numeracy, we've got our maths and numeracy plan, which is already under way in Wales. And that support is being developed in co-construction with practitioners. We've also got the mathematics support programme, delivered through Swansea University, which we are funding and which we are expanding. So, we have a really strong focus on numeracy and literacy already, but we are looking to strengthen that further.\n\nIf I can just conclude by saying that it is a myth to say that our curriculum is just a skills-based curriculum. It is also a knowledge-based curriculum. It is very clear, if you look at the curriculum framework, that the knowledge expected from our learners is very clearly set out through the areas of learning, through the 'what matters' statements, through the descriptions of learning and through the progression framework. Thank you.\n\nThank you very much, Cefin, and thank you in particular for your welcome and your support for the new curriculum, and for your statement of Plaid Cymru's support. There's nothing more important than working together to advance children and young people in Wales, so I do really appreciate that.\n\nI've set out some of the things that we're planning to do in terms of additional support. I've talked about the nationally available collaborative support, building on existing programmes and the commitments made in the maths and numeracy plan last year. Literacy and numeracy are top priorities for me, and I want to ensure that those are consistent across the country. We're also looking at support and tools to help teachers, and I should be clear about this, that some schools are absolutely flying with the curriculum, and this isn't about clipping the wings of those schools. We want those schools to get on with the wonderful work that they're doing. This is about providing additional support to those schools who feel that they need it.\n\nSo, some of the things we're looking at are: schools have said they'd like more examples of what the curriculum can and should look like in practice, so this support will provide clear, simple examples and approaches to guide schools through the curriculum design process. I already mentioned putting the literacy and numeracy framework on a statutory footing. We also know that some schools would welcome more detail to help their understanding of progression in different areas of the curriculum, so we'll be looking to help with that too, but of course it is important that we do this work in partnership with practitioners.\n\nYou referred to the unions, and obviously I meet the unions regularly. We also have a schools partnership council. I do recognise the concerns that trade unions have raised about workload in schools. That's why I took the difficult decision to postpone the actual implementation of reform of the school year into the next Senedd, because I wanted to listen to those concerns and recognise that not only are they grappling with curriculum reform, ALN, but they're also still recovering from the pandemic. And we are working really hard to minimise workload strain on the workforce. We've got a strategic workload group that some of the unions are involved in chairing and we're developing a digital workload tool for heads, so that is very much a high priority for us in the Government.\n\nYou referred to the IFS report, and I've been clear several times in the Chamber that I am concerned about some of the messages in the IFS report, particularly around the attainment gap between England and Wales. I do think it is important, though, to emphasise again that the children who did the PISA tests were not subject to the new curriculum, and also to repeat what I said to Joel. I think it is a misunderstanding to say that this is just a skills-based curriculum, because it is also a curriculum that is rich in knowledge. But what we want to do is make sure that young people can take that knowledge and apply it to different settings.\n\nIn terms of your queries about the Scottish Curriculum for Excellence, just to assure you that we're looking at examples of curricula anywhere that we can, really, and we're also really keen to learn from their experience in Scotland. One of the things that they probably did wrong in Scotland was that they responded to the concerns about their curriculum by putting too much detail into what they were asking schools to do, and that doesn't seem to have helped the problem. I met with Graham Donaldson last week to check in on how we were going. I know that he attended a large network event with practitioners, and he feels that we are very much on the right track. Obviously, there's more work to do, and I would never suggest otherwise.\n\nJust finally on the teaching of Welsh history or histories, just to assure you, obviously, that was a commitment as part of the co-operation agreement with Plaid Cymru. I came in at the tail end of that piece of work, but that work is continuing. We are committed to that piece of work and making sure that all our children and young people can understand all the histories that have grown up around them in Wales.\n\nBVD seriously impacts animal health, welfare standards, and food production. It weakens our national herd, reduces milk yields, and it slows down growth. While not a public health or a food safety risk, BVD is a costly disease for farmers at a time when many farmers and farming communities are feeling under pressure. Losses are estimated in the millions of pounds each year because of decreased productivity, higher veterinary costs, and the loss of livestock. Eradicating BVD means a financial boost for the entire industry and a win for the environment. It's not just about happy, healthy cows; stamping it out also strengthens our reputation as a leader in sustainable agriculture, it opens doors to exciting new markets, and it means more opportunities, more growth, and a more prosperous future for our rural communities.\n\nThe good news is that BVD is entirely preventable. Working together, we can eradicate it from Wales. In addition to the gains for farmers, eradicating BVD will help Wales as a whole achieve our net-zero targets sooner. The average Welsh herd is made up of 40 cattle. BVD increases the carbon footprint of that herd by around 70 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent every year. When you multiply this by 11,000 herds in Wales, eradicating BVD is a welcome contribution to achieving net zero. Recognising the range of benefits, our current animal health and welfare framework implementation plan outlines our intention to introduce a compulsory programme of BVD screening, underpinned by legislation.\n\nFrom 2017 to 2022, with support through our rural development programme, industry and Government together made great strides with the voluntary screening programme. Over 80 per cent of cattle herds in Wales took part, of which 28 per cent tested positive for BVD. Within those herds, 940 persistently infected—PI—animals were identified. This is why the new compulsory programme is so important. BVD spreads mainly through persistently infected, or PI, cattle. These cattle are born with the disease, having come into contact with the BVD virus in the womb. They shed the BVD virus and they spread it to native cattle within the herd, leading to illness, reproduction losses, or the birth of more persistently infected animals. So, identifying and then removing PI cattle from the national herd eliminates the source of the disease. This is critical to the success of any BVD eradication programme.\n\nEradicating BVD in Wales is a long-standing commitment, and I fully support industry and Government working together in close partnership to achieve this. Eighty-nine per cent of respondents during the consultation phase demonstrated the industry's strong support for introducing BVD legislation in Wales. This encouraged the Welsh Government to co-design and to facilitate a compulsory BVD eradication programme alongside cattle sector representatives. I'm very pleased to announce the Welsh Government made the Bovine Viral Diarrhoea (Wales) Order 2024 on 1 July. This pioneering piece of legislation addresses the challenge of eradicating BVD holistically. Its development was driven by dedicated representatives in the cattle, veterinary, and knowledge transfer domains of the industry, and it represents a natural evolution from the voluntary scheme, Gwaredu BVD.\n\nEmbarking on this next phase of the BVD eradication programme in Wales is a proud and important step for Wales. I would like to take just a moment and acknowledge our cattle industry’s efforts in paving the way on this. We can achieve BVD eradication through the ongoing efforts of all cattle farmers, working closely with their vets, to screen and protect their herds. So, starting from 1 July 2024, all animals identified as persistently infected are to be restricted on farm for the remainder of their lives and kept separate from the rest of the herd. Under this new legislation, herds in Wales, regardless of their size, type, or location, must undergo annual screening tests for BVD. Cattle keepers will have until 1 July 2025 to complete their first test, which is estimated at £100 per year for the required annual herd testing.\n\nDepending on farm type, eradicating BVD can boost farm profits by £20 to £70 per cow per year. This translates to an additional £2,000 to £14,000 each year per herd. This is a sensible investment in improving the health and productivity of their herd. Farms should invest in protecting the health of their animals, helping to make their businesses more sustainable and more resilient. If herds are not tested by this date, they will be placed under movement restrictions until they receive a BVD-negative antibody test and there is evidence that there are no BVD-infected animals in the herd.\n\nDirprwy Lywydd, through partnership, the Welsh Government has also developed a BVD database system that will seamlessly integrate with the multispecies Wales livestock tracing system. The database will record the annual test results and will assign BVD statuses for herds and for individual cattle. This will enable farmers to safely source incoming animals and allow industry and the Welsh Government to monitor the progress of BVD eradication across Wales. We are also working in collaboration with cattle industry, veterinary, and knowledge-transfer representatives to establish a BVD governance body. This body will provide advice and support to farmers and vets as well as providing feedback to the Welsh Government to help co-develop any legislative changes needed during the delivery of the programme. The governance body will also be empowered to make decisions to solve operational issues and to design and implement policies within the existing legislation. I'm confident that this innovative partnership approach, with industry leading the charge on BVD eradication, will ensure a successful outcome.\n\nBy working together, with the new legislation as our road map, we will stop the spread of BVD, safeguard animal welfare, and maintain a healthy, sustainable cattle industry in Wales. This action will help make our rural communities more prosperous and help Wales as a whole to cut our emissions and tackle the climate emergency. As proud stewards of our land and livestock, we all have a moral responsibility to protect the well-being of our animals and our environment by working together. Farmers, veterinarians, educators and the Welsh Government are making huge strides to make Wales BVD-free.\n\nI'd like to thank you, Cabinet Secretary, for your statement this afternoon outlining the Welsh Government's plan to eradicate bovine viral diarrhoea, BVD, from Wales. While I acknowledge the aspiration that the Government has, there are some significant concerns that need to be addressed before I can wholly support the programme that this Government is pursuing.\n\nI think, Cabinet Secretary, this statement does gloss over the substantial costs that farmers will face. The National Beef Association estimated that BVD presence in a herd incurs annual losses of up to £15,000 for some dairy farmers. You talked there about the £100 annual testing cost. That might seem small, but that's not the only cost, is it, Cabinet Secretary? Because there are additional costs for biosecurity measures and veterinary costs. If you're going to have to segregate cattle, you may have to put additional sheds up, and you may have to adapt your land to do that. And those costs could cripple our small farms. So, Cabinet Secretary, can you outline if there are any concrete financial support plans beyond some of the things that you've mentioned today, and will the Welsh Government be offering substantial grants and cost-sharing initiatives to ease that immediate financial burden on our farmers, particularly those in our smaller holdings, because we need clear commitments from the Government about funding on this? It's very good bringing these schemes forward, but if there is no funding to match them, it's going to be very difficult for the agricultural industry.\n\nThe programme that you've set seems to adopt quite a uniform approach, and I think that neglects the vast differences between our large and our smaller family-run operations, especially those organic farms that we have in Wales. So, can you elaborate on how the programme will cater for the needs of these diverse farm types, and are there alternative testing protocols and biosecurity measures for organic farmers, so that they can adhere to their certification standards, because a blanket policy across Wales risks alienating and disproportionately affecting those in the sector who do actually struggle to conform to some of these standards that you're setting out?\n\nEradication is an ambitious goal, and it's one I share—I like to be ambitious and I think we need to be—but I think the programme lacks long-term detail on sustainability. While you mention monitoring, there's no concrete plan that's been outlined. Studies exist, for instance from the Royal Veterinary College, showcasing eradication programmes in other countries that have led to dramatic reductions in BVD and PI calves, but how will the Welsh Government adopt these learnings? What specific long-term programmes are you going to be putting in place to prevent BVD re-emergence, and have you had conversations with vets on how we can actually put those long-term strategies in place to stop this disease in its tracks?\n\nAnd on vets, Cabinet Secretary, we do have a shortage of vets right across Wales, and you keep asking them to do more and more, whether that's the increased bureaucracy that comes with TB, the increased vet visits that are part of the sustainable farming scheme, and now this on top again. And that's on top of people's herd plans and sheep health plans that vets come around to talk about. This is a lot of vet time here that is going to be on farms, so I'd be interested to know what conversation you've had with vets around whether they actually have got the resource to do that.\n\nAnd one thing that I think is very key in delivering this programme—. It does rely heavily on upskilling our farmers right across Wales, and I think there's a little bit of detail lacking in the statement around that. So, I want to know how will the programme educate and upskill our farmers about BVD, the best practices for prevention and control, and the available support systems. Are there any plans to develop an educational resource or training programme specifically tailored to Welsh farmers around—I can't get my words out—BVD? And will the Welsh Government collaborate with industry bodies like the NFU, the FUW and, obviously, the young farmers movement as well, because our young farmers are the future of our farming in Wales, and I'd be interested to know whether you've been talking to them?\n\nI think that's enough questions I've asked you, Cabinet Secretary. I can see your pen moving very quickly across the paper, trying to keep up with what I've asked you. But from my point of view, eradicating BVD in Wales is a positive step. I think it can add significant benefits to the industry, with increasing productivity and actually on-farm profit as well, but I think we need some more answers on the questions that I've asked you, Cabinet Secretary, so we can get into the detail of this, because it's only by getting that full detail will I be able to support you wholly in this scheme. Diolch.\n\nThank you, James, very much, for those several questions. I can see that we haven't convinced you entirely, but I would simply say to you that this has been, actually, co-produced and led by those in the farming community—those in the cattle sector that have been very keen to see these steps forward, specifically to deal with the eradication of BVD, which has such a significant impact on the productivity of our herds, and actually on the viability of those herds as well. So, in response to your questions about the costs, I noted in my opening remarks—I said on average about £100; actually, for smaller cattle holders, including possibly some of those organics, there is a range. Roughly speaking, it's £6 per animal tested, so on a smaller herd you could be looking at something like £50. On others, it could be £150. Roughly speaking, it's £100 a year. You balance that against the productivity savings, which could be up to £2,000 for a smaller herd, or even £14,000 for a larger herd. I think there's the balance, and that's why those who've co-produced this with us are so supportive of it. So, I hope you can overcome some of your reservations on the cost, because what this does is not only help us with the animal welfare aspects of the herd, help us eradicate BVD, it also deals with carbon emissions, because if you have a healthy herd, all the evidence we’re now seeing—and I know his background within the farming community—shows that better productivity within herds also helps us with the carbon reductions, but it also increases the viability because the cost to those farmers of less productive animals is quite significant. So, it more than outweighs the investment and the, roughly speaking, £6 per animal for the sample testing.\n\nJust to reassure on the longevity of this, when we move to, as I laid out in my initial statement, a system where you have that integration of databases, the information being shared with farmers and accessible to their vets on-farm and so on, these will be tools that are at the disposal of those individual farmers, then, to make decisions, both in terms of cattle movements and bringing new cattle onto the farm, but also in terms of making those on-farm decisions, then, where they have PI animals. It will be for them, then, to make that business decision whether to isolate them and so on.\n\nSo, there will be a task over the next year of engaging with the farmers, not only in terms of doing the sample testing before summer 2025, but also working with unions—NFU, FUW—and others who are involved, representative organisations in the farming community, to engage with farmers alongside on-farm veterinarians to explain how this will work, how they can do it in a very straightforward way. There will, for example, be an app brought forward as part of this as well with the database, so that literally the tools are at the disposal of the individual farmer who wants to make use of that; not every farmer will, I appreciate that, but some will want to do it as well.\n\nThe shortage of vets that you touched on is a really interesting point. We know how stretched vets are. I simply want to say: any UK Government elected in a few days, of whichever colour, needs to deal with the issue of veterinary agreements on a UK-EU basis. We do need to get back to that situation where there is a well-managed but also a good flow of expertise back and forth. And I mean, this is interesting, because part of the issues of shortages we’re seeing, and I attended—I think you might have as well—the British Veterinary Association annual meeting and the dinner last week—. I met with them during the course of the day. This was one of the things we were discussing: how we got this point where we seem to have strangled the availability.\n\nWe also need as well, by the way, to continue the development of our own expertise through our veterinary schools and so on, and I think there’s something here that we need to look at with farmers themselves who might decide, or youngsters on farms who might decide that that’s a route for them to go on. So, the upskilling of farmers is an issue we’ll be working on with the vets, with the farming unions, with young farmers and others over the course of the next year to make sure that all farmers are aware of how to do this process, and why it’s good for them to do this process, and for them to take ownership in the same way that this initiative has actually been co-designed. Those farmers are going to be part of the solution of eradicating BVD, which we can do.\n\nMay I thank the Cabinet Secretary for his statement? I've been a keen supporter of the BVD eradication scheme from the days before it even existed. And, of course, I was very pleased to see that the scheme had come into being, and I want to take this opportunity to pay tribute to people such as Dr Neil Paton who pushed very hard to see this happening, and who's done so much to prove the value of that broader approach for the industry, for the Government and for others, and that it's a scheme that can make a difference, as you said, in terms of animal well-being, productivity, profit, emissions, and so on and so forth.\n\nBut I've also shared the frustration of many on the delay between the end of the funding of BVD eradication and the 18 months to get us to this point where this will become something more permanent, and the fact that there's been a significant decline in the number of those who were coming forward to test for BVD. Perhaps you could explain why the delay. Do you share that frustration? But, of course, the important thing now is that we have reached this point.\n\nNow, what happens now is that the cost and bureaucracy falls more heavily on the shoulders of the sector, and as we have heard, there are questions about the practical impact that that will have. You are clearly saying that there won't be any resources from Government to support that shift within the sector. If so, what will you do to promote the benefits to the sector, because you have highlighted that there will be increased profits from doing this? But how can you sell that to the sector, so that the broader sector—because representatives of different organisations might be buying into this, but on the ground, there needs to be that understanding that this is an investment, and they shouldn't necessarily look at it as a cost burden? But there is an expectation then, if places have been infected, that animals will need to be separated, isolated, kept indoors. There is an infrastructure cost that may be attached to that, and where will you refer people who need that kind of support?\n\nThere is a recommendation, of course, that animals should be culled as soon as practically possible. Can you expand on that in terms of 'as soon as practically possible'? I'm sure there will be guidance, but how clear will that guidance be? We don't want a situation such as the one we've seen with TB, where great anxiety is caused unnecessarily. We need clarity, and we need to be able to move very quickly on that front, should the case arise.\n\nWhat resources are provided to the authorities responsible for enforcing this new regime, because we often say when new regulations are introduced they are only as effective as their enforcement, so that is perhaps something that we need an assurance on?\n\nYou say that we are moving to an industry-led phase, that the industry itself will lead on this, but what role do you therefore see for the Government in the longer term in terms of governance and costs related to eradicating BVD? There's reference to BVD governance; can you tell us who you think will play a part in that?\n\nJust to close from me, your predecessor made a statement in January of last year saying that the two main threats in this context for the sector are sheep scab and BVD. Where are we on sheep scab? What is your ambition in relation to scab? If you get to this point with BVD, is that the direction of travel in the other context too? Thank you.\n\nLlyr, thank you very much for those questions, and thank you as well for, broadly speaking, the welcome for this on the basis that it has been brought forward by people who've been advocating for this for a long, long time, including Dr Neil Paton, but also being brought forward with full co-production. We often overuse that phrase, but this is genuine within this area, with the support of Welsh Government officials, with the support of the office of the chief veterinary officer, and the veterinary sector within the agency as well. But it's genuinely led by those who are dealing with this day by day. It was at their demand. They said, 'We need to deal with this and drive this out of the cattle sector', for all the reasons we've said already. So, thank you for your broad support for it.\n\nBut you raised some interesting points there. One aspect there was to do with the support from Government going forward. Well, there is support, it's been support from Government to get to this point, working with industry to get here. There will be support in terms of bringing forward a governance body, which you've touched on. We do need some form of governance, but it needs, as well, to have significant direction within that, again, from the cattle sector itself so that they can adjust, advise on where else we might need to go so that we do eradicate BVD. So, it will have our support in doing that. We'll be bringing forward the databases and the integration of those databases so that we have, at the fingertips of farmers and their on-farm vet, how they can respond to incidents of PI animals, either that are within the herd, or that are brought into the herd.\n\nWe will, just to reassure you, as I said to Jane, work with the sector, going forward now in all the clever ways in which we can link to them to explain not just why this is important and why it is so well supported, but how this will work. There is a job of work to be done on this, because not every farmer is connected to a union, not every farmer has regular dynamic engagement with a vet on their farm to the extent that others do. So, we're going to have to use all of those networks of people that we have at our disposal. In the same way that we've co-produced this, we're actually going to have to take forward together the work to explain this. We've got a year to work with all farmers to say, 'You've got till next summer to get your screening, testing, done of your herd.' And it will vary from farm to farm in the nature of those discussions and it will definitely vary in the cost of this as well. But we've worked hard, in co-producing this, to make sure that we keep those costs to a minimum.\n\nThe resourcing around enforcement of this—I think that is an important point and I think the group that have brought this together would want to see the right approach to enforcement, because this is all about for the good of the Welsh herd in its entirely and driving out BVD from the whole herd. Now, I have to say, I can give you the assurance there that, even though our on-farm veterinarian services are very stretched, as we've said—and there are ways to resolve that as we go forward—my own, I have to say, very expert and very dedicated team under the chief veterinary officer are also constantly working hard to be right across the piste with this. I have no difficulties in giving the assurance that the enforcement of this in the right way, in the proportionate way in order to eradicate BVD, will be done, and it'll build on the work that's come out of the group's co-produced work as well. There is oversight of this, of course, from Welsh Government. Even when putting the governance body in place, which we will support, there will be oversight from Welsh Government, and, of course, from our office of the chief veterinary officer as well.\n\nYou mentioned whether this then points the way forward on other things. I'm very keen to point out that, whilst I really welcome the fact that this is a co-produced piece of work that's been led by the sector, been championed by the sector for some time, and we've now got to this very important point today, it doesn't, of itself, say, 'This is a precedent', but we do need to actually get on with scab as well. Now, I think what this has shown us is that there is a way of working with the industry to actually say what's the best solution. This model, I think, is absolutely right for this, but let's see now. I'm looking forward to bringing forward some outcomes of the work that we've been doing on scab, and sharing it with the committee as well, so that they can see it, and I think that's our next one that we move onto. But this shows a way that we can do it together. Thank you.\n\nThank you, Deputy Presiding Officer. The Legislation, Justice and Constitution Committee considered these draft regulations on 24 June. Our report contains 11 technical and two merits reporting points. We had some concerns with the response to our report, and I thank the Cabinet Secretary for her swift reply to the letter that we sent to seek clarity. Unfortunately, the Cabinet Secretary’s response did not alleviate our concerns and we took the unusual step of writing again yesterday afternoon. Our report and the correspondence are available on today’s agenda.\n\nThese regulations provide additional detail and requirements that are necessary to ensure the functioning of the Procurement Act 2023. Members will know that the Senedd approved a legislative consent motion for relevant provisions to be included in the now Act. Senedd Committees were told, when they were considering the consent memorandum for the Bill, that Welsh and UK Government officials were working closely on the development of secondary legislation. The Welsh Government subsequently taking responsibility for making regulations for Wales using powers in primary legislation considered by a different Parliament at least gives the Senedd some active control over the law that will apply in Wales.\n\nI want to highlight our reporting points 10 and 11. In Schedule 2 to the regulations, reference is made to the ‘National Assembly for Wales Commission’ and not, as it currently is, the ‘Senedd Commission’. The Welsh Government has said that the UK Government advised that names could not be changed. The response we received also added that, if the UK Government decides to amend the list in its own regulations, the Welsh Government will look to do the same. We asked the Welsh Government to share with us the advice provided by the UK Government, particularly in relation to the name of the Senedd Commission. In any event, we were surprised that the Welsh Government is apparently taking instructions from the UK Government in how to draft its legislation.\n\nThe Cabinet Secretary also told us in her letter that, historically, the Welsh Government had no power to amend the names of central Government bodies as a result of international trade obligations. We are genuinely unclear as to how using the correct and current name of the Senedd Commission could possibly pose a risk to the UK's compliance with international trade obligations. We ask that as much detail as possible is offered to the Senedd to provide clarity as to why the Welsh Government has adopted an approach that to us seems, at best, irregular. And, unfortunately, the Cabinet Secretary did not provide us with the UK Government advice she told us the Welsh Government has received and was following.\n\nThe Cabinet Secretary will understand that the committee's key role is to assist the Senedd in making good legislation. We are a critical friend. And so I will use my final comments to highlight that there are known defects in these regulations. The Cabinet Secretary has committed to bring forward a further statutory instrument in the autumn to correct four issues my committee has identified. We believe it is important for that to be on the record this afternoon.\n\nThank you. Can I just say again how very grateful I am to the committee for the diligent scrutiny that they've undertaken of these regulations? In response to the committee's concerns regarding the list of central Government bodies listed in Schedule 2 to the regulations, the issue that they have raised is both technically and historically complex, and it's linked to our international obligations. Whilst the Welsh Government has the powers to pass laws relating to the observation and implementation of international obligations, it's the UK Government that is responsible for agreeing trade deals for the whole of the United Kingdom, and, historically, this has meant that we've been unable to amend names such as those listed in Schedule 2, as we've lacked the powers to do so. But I do think it's also important to point out that our decision to lay these regulations was driven in part by our commitment to the Welsh stakeholders that we would provide them with sufficient time to prepare effectively before the new regime comes into force. It is critically important that stakeholders have sight of these regulations prior to the go-live date, to inform their own preparations. And although the committee has highlighted certain areas that require correction, failure to correct these matters at this stage doesn't prevent stakeholders from continuing their preparations for the new procurement regime.\n\nAs I've noticed in my—noted, I should say—written response to the committee, we're actively exploring options for using powers within the Procurement Act to update the names set out at Schedule 2, as the regulations will not be coming into force until 28 October. And I'm happy to provide assurance that, should this be legally possible, then we will look to amend the names, via future regulations, at the earliest opportunity.\n\nI'd also like to acknowledge the committee's concerns regarding the sharing of information, and I do appreciate the importance of providing as much information as possible to the committee so that it can discharge successfully its obligations to provide effective scrutiny of the proposed regulations. I'd just like to reassure the Chair that my officials and I remain committed to supporting the committee as much as possible with that.\n\nThese regulations and the Procurement Act, alongside the Social Partnership and Public Procurement (Wales) Act 2023 and the Health Service Procurement (Wales) Act 2024, will provide an effective framework for procurement in Wales, and they'll also initiate a new way forward that will enable the Welsh public sector to leverage the power of procurement and to support the more equal, sustainable and prosperous Wales that we all want to see.\n\nI just do want to say that this has been a really good example of co-productive working between the Welsh Government and UK Government, and we continue to work closely on the development of our respective procurement regimes. We have been able, for example, to change the UK Government's approach to a number of things. For example, in the drafting of the Procurement Act, we secured an increase in the maximum contract term for when contracts are reserved to public service mutuals from three years to five years, for example, and we were also able to influence the drafting of the UK Government's procurement regulations in a number of areas. For example, when a contract is awarded to an excluded supplier, we suggested that the name of the supplier should be included in the contract award notice, so that, in all instances, the public are aware of the intention to award to an excluded supplier before the contract has been entered into. So, there are a whole range of examples that we can cite in terms of the influence that we've had on the UK Government's approach and the good working that's been done jointly.\n\nAnd then just to point out two things that I think will be of particular interest to colleagues in terms of the approach that we're taking forward today. In the legislation there is a specific duty on contracting authorities to consider how to reduce and remove the barriers to small and medium-sized enterprises when they are trying to access those public procurement opportunities. We know that these barriers can include over-complicated tender processes and the requirement to submit multiple documents multiple times, and SMEs can find themselves at a disadvantage when competing against larger firms with dedicated bid-writing resources, for example. So, I think that's a really exciting move forward in the approach that we're taking. And also, crucially, the Act will require procurers to assess tenders on the basis of the most advantageous tender. Previously it's been the most economically advantageous tender, so it does mean that in removing the reference to economic criteria we will have a positive impact on social value, allowing for greater consideration of the wider benefits for the community in which the contract will be delivered. I know that will speak to a lot of concerns that colleagues have raised about procurement in recent years. Thank you.\n\nAs we are discussing a Bill that essentially has the aim of strengthening the foundations of parliamentary democracy and representative democracy, it's appropriate that the first group of amendments relates to the health of our democracy. Democracy in this state, and across the globe, is in a period of crisis, and closer to home, too, things are a long way from being healthy. Public confidence in our institutions is at its lowest level ever, whilst the shadow of disinformation continues to darken the political discourse. In the meantime, the demagogues and the fraudsters go from strength to strength, undermining the foundations of democratic principles everywhere. We are seeing in France, aren't we, at the moment, the possibility that there will be an extreme right-wing Prime Minister for the first time since the days of Vichy. We are seeing what is happening in the United States, and the appalling decision overnight by the Supreme Court, giving Trump full freedom to operate without any consequences to his behaviour at all. But it is important that we also recognise that we are not free of these dangers and risks within the UK and in Wales too. It is a critical period, and we must respond robustly and creatively to the challenges that we are facing in terms of our democracy.\n\nIt's also fair to note that the Westminster Government, under the party that has a few days left in power, has introduced some policies over recent years that have taken us in that wrong direction, including the Public Order Act 2023—a draconian Act to introduce the use of ID in polling stations, which will certainly, in this election, place more disadvantaged individuals and ethnic minorities at a disadvantage that is disproportionate. This threat of slippage in democracy also exists in Wales. There is a lack of awareness among our citizens in terms of devolution, in terms of the constitutional settlement, which emerges, partly, I have to say, from deficiencies in our national media. It's good to see that that has been an issue that we as a Senedd have sought to address in recent times. But there is major, important work still to be done to ensure that our democracy operates on a basis where citizens are aware of how democracy operates.\n\nAs a result of this, apathy more generally regarding democracy has increased at all levels in recent decades, which is reflected, for example, in the low voter turnout at all levels of Government, I have to say. We do have a particular problem that we must recognise in terms of the percentages that turn out for Senedd elections. But participation levels at all levels of our elections are unacceptably low, and we must recognise that as one of the things that needs to be resolved in terms of ensuring that our democratic health is improved. We also suffer from a lack of equal status for the Welsh language in this context and practical use of it in the administration of elections, and we'll come to that in due time.\n\nAmendment 26 corrects a problem with the Bill by confirming that the functions of the Democracy and Boundary Commission Wales, as they are expanded in this Bill, include advising Welsh Ministers on issues related to the democratic health of Wales. That is the term that's used in paragraph 1.2 of the explanatory memorandum to this Bill. Therefore, it is clear that it is the Government's intention for the commission to have that function, but it is not included on the face of the Bill at present. This legislation, therefore, in our view, needs to be true to the policy intentions set out, and as a matter of transparency, citizens should be able to understand the functions that are exercised by this body if they look at the legislation.\n\nDuring Stage 2, the Counsel General argued that the Government could add to the functions of the body to be exercised by the electoral management board specifically through subordinate legislation in future. However, if the intention is for the body to have this function from the outset in terms of advising on democratic health, as we understand the explanatory memorandum to say, then we do need to be clear on that in the legislation, and therefore I ask Members to support amendment 26.\n\nTurning now to amendment 27, in response to the first recommendation of the Independent Commission on the Constitutional Future of Wales, the Government listed some of the different organisations that play a part in nurturing the democratic health of our nation: the Welsh Government itself, the Senedd Commission, and the power that the Commission has under the Government of Wales Act in this regard, the Electoral Commission, the advisory body on broadcasting and communication, the media, the third sector, local government, and, of course, the democracy commission itself. The education system and schools are also crucial bodies in terms of the role of the curriculum in nurturing and understanding and participation in democracy, and I do think that we still have more work to be done in that regard. Sioned Williams has been promoting this cause recently.\n\nThe problem is that not one single body seems to be leading on this co-ordination role, nor are they reporting holistically the success or otherwise of efforts made in terms of democratic health. The Reform Bill Committee recommended in relation to raising awareness of the electoral system for the new Senedd that there needed to be specific clarity on who will drive this work. The Government gave an initial response pledging to respond with substance in due time. I've asked two written questions to the Counsel General, and I'm still no clearer, I have to say, in terms of the Government's intentions in this regard.\n\nThe Counsel General said that Royal Assent to the first Senedd Cymru Bill would be an important milestone to enable the work to happen. That has now happened, of course, and it was said that there would be a further update for Members following the summer recess. But I do ask once again: who is responsible for leading and co-ordinating the work? Amendment 27 seeks to answer that question, and we want that clarity. I see that I—. Is there a time restriction on contributions?\n\nI do have more to say on democratic health.\n\nThe intention of amendment 27 is to ensure that the democracy commission encourages democratic innovation and it puts a framework in place as to how the commission should exercise its functions for the democratic health of the nation by establishing a unit within the commission that would have responsibility for co-ordinating a programme of work. It suggests some areas that could be reported on, including turnout of elections, and so on and so forth. These amendments all build practically on the conclusions of the Independent Commission on the Constitutional Future of Wales, in addition to the excellent work on this subject by other organisations, such as the Wales Centre for Public Policy, commissioned by Government.\n\nA key part of democratic health is also about ensuring that the democratic arena is secure for all candidates and representatives. My final amendment in this group, amendment 36, places a duty on the commission to monitor harassment of elected members and candidates; to establish a particular unit to do that monitoring work; and to report on the findings of that monitoring, which could feed in to a comprehensive annual report on democratic health.\n\nThere is no doubt, unfortunately, that another element of the crisis that we are facing is the appalling levels of threats, violence and intimidation and harassment that are targeted at politicians, particularly female politicians, and other members of oppressed groups—ethnic minority groups, for example, and LGBT people. The murders of Jo Cox and David Amess do outline the most appalling outcomes of this. But, despite the ongoing efforts to tackle this issue, the truth of the matter is that very many politicians today have to ask for police protection from day to day, and also we know that this leads to people leaving politics, particularly women, particularly those from ethnic minorities and other oppressed groups, and that is not acceptable.\n\nWhat we're asking for through this amendment is that we do have information that provides us with that data, as a baseline, to assess the success of any interventions that we and the Government put in place in order to tackle the issue. Unless we have a monitoring unit—. And such monitoring units have now been created by other Parliaments around the globe. The Dáil recently, in Ireland, have discussed this. So why can't we do that at the Welsh level in order to ensure that we do have a unit that not only monitors, but also provides advice, support, practical support, which advises people on what they can do if they do face that kind of harassment? So, there are things in the pipeline, and Counsel General will mention those. But why not bring them all together in one place in order to ensure that we do tackle a problem that has such a negative impact on our democracy? And with those few words, I will conclude for now.\n\nI'd like to thank Peter Fox for his amendments in this group. As a party, we're very supportive of the measures in this Bill to introduce electoral registration without application, and we believe that this is an initial step that can increase electoral participation in Wales. For those reasons, we don't support amendment 7, because we agree with the Government's rationale that the 45-day notice period is adequate. However, we still recognise the importance of reviewing policies on an ongoing basis, so we're happy to support amendment 8.\n\nTurning to my amendments in this group, the purpose of amendment 28 is to ensure that applications for automatic registration are as flexible and easy as possible, specifically through deleting the need for any elector in Wales who wishes to register anonymously to provide the evidence, and to remove the need to renew their registration for anonymous registration.\n\nThe purpose of amendment 29 is to establish clear rules on the rights of constituents or electors who are registered in more than one abode, something that has been important in Wales for a number of years, as well as where the issue of second homes is a challenge. It's worth noting that around 36,000 people live in second homes in Wales for periods during the year, a significant number who could have a major impact on Welsh elections in the future, despite the fact that they do not live permanently in that accommodation.\n\nA number of efforts have been made over a number of years in Westminster, for example, to deal with the situation that currently exists, where someone, because they have a second home, can vote or can choose to vote between more than one constituency. We are of the view that that is fundamentally undemocratic. The fact that you have access to more property doesn't in our view give you rights to have greater freedom to decide in elections where you will cast your vote, and that should be reflected in the electoral system, particularly for national elections.\n\nWe believe that action is needed to deal with the lack of clarity on this issue, and it's worth noting that local registration officers do have the right to challenge people who have second homes under the 1B process, as it is known. They can question anyone who is on the register to determine whether they do have adequate local connection. But in reality, of course, that isn't implemented—consistently, at least—and I believe we need that statutory assurance to say that having a second house somewhere doesn't give you the right to vote in that area. You should be voting where your main home is located. We do set out some reasonable exceptions in this regard—people who have to be away from their main residence for an extended period for reasons related to employment, service, education and so on. But if you are not registered because you have a second home somewhere, that shouldn't be reflected in our democracy, in my view.\n\nThe reason why this is even more important is because of automatic voter registration. Many of the people in the second homes wouldn't register, necessarily but now there is an automatic voter registration process, those 36,000 people all of a sudden will be on the register, in a number of cases for the very first time. That 36,000 is concentrated in very few constituencies. So, as a percentage of electors in those constituencies, they will be a significant proportion, and we believe there is a fundamental unfairness here that needs to be resolved.\n\nDuring Stage 2, the Counsel General recognised that this was an important issue and that there was value in assessing ways of tightening up the rules around people's electoral rights when they are second home owners, but the conclusion, at that time, was that including something in this Bill would place an unnecessary burden on the electoral registration process. We are suspicious of this rationale, and we believe that, unless there is a change to the end to which this amendment is seeking, we are going to find ourselves in a position of an undemocratic unfairness, in our view, that I've warned against.\n\nDiolch, Llywydd. Can I thank Peter Fox and Adam Price for their contributions? I'll speak first to amendment 7. Amendment 7, as has been mentioned, changes the 45-day notice period of intention to register by the registration officer to 60 days. I am able to support this amendment. We will be piloting registration without application and the waiting period will be evaluated as part of this, so I feel that, although I still remain of the view in terms of 45 days being appropriate, bearing in mind that there will be the pilot, this is a concession that can reasonably be made, and then we will evaluate.\n\nAmendment 28 would remove the requirement for an applicant of anonymous registration to provide evidence in support of their application for the local government register in Wales. It would also allow someone to remain anonymously registered until they requested to be removed from the anonymous register for the local government register in Wales. So, this amendment would create a different anonymous registration system for the local government register in Wales to that for the UK parliamentary register. This amendment, therefore, wouldn't reduce the administrative burden on the electors, as they would still have to complete a yearly evidence-based application in order to remain on the parliamentary register.\n\nI do not support this amendment. Registering to vote anonymously is also something that is specifically reserved for electors who can demonstrate that the publication of their details on the electoral register would put the safety of the applicant or a member of their household at risk. Inclusion of an elector as an anonymous elector on the register means that their details are only available to a very restricted list of organisations and would prevent them from certain activities, for example receiving electoral mailshots. So, that's why we continue to believe that anonymous registration should only be used for those who really need it for that specific purpose. Anonymous registration is reserved for the most grave circumstances, and it needs to be evaluated on a yearly basis to provide the chance for any changes in the elector's circumstances to be reflected. Keeping Welsh provision around anonymous registration in line with all other parts of the UK is also essential for the elector and to reduce confusion. Keeping people and their data as safe as possible is of the utmost importance and these amendments I think present serious risk to that.\n\nSupporting voters' positive engagement with electoral registration processes is very important to us, which is why additional safeguards have been built into our automatic registration provisions where, if an elector does not want to be automatically registered, they're able to opt out of the system once they have received their notice of registration. They will then be able to follow the usual individual electoral registration process.\n\nIf I might turn, now, to amendment 8, this amendment would require the Welsh Ministers, no later than at the end of a period of 12 months beginning immediately after the end of the local government elections in Wales held in 2027, to carry out a review and lay a report before the Senedd relating to the operation of electoral registration without application. The Electoral Commission are required to produce an independent report evaluating the registration without application pilots. It would be an unnecessary complication to require the Welsh Ministers to do the same, given that the Electoral Commission's report on the pilots will be published and shared with all Members. So, I therefore, again, don't support this amendment.\n\nFinally, if I can speak to amendment 29: this amendment, as the Member has outlined, places a residency requirement for local government registration, and would require a person to be ordinarily resident in the area for at least 182 days of the year. I have sympathy with the amendment, but I don't support the amendment, because I think it would create an unnecessary burden on the electoral registration officers, as monitoring compliance would be extremely difficult, particularly as we move to registration without application. It would also overlap and conflict with other existing provisions with respect to determining residency and local connection and could have unintended consequences with respect to people's existing right to vote. Diolch, Llywydd.\n\nMay I thank Peter Fox for introducing amendment 15, which aims to deliver a similar aim to our own amendment in this group, namely to ensure that disability is not a barrier to the fundamental right to vote? We are very content to support this amendment.\n\nThe purpose of our amendment is to extend this crucial principle to include specific provisions to assist partially sighted and blind voters. Following discussions with the RNIB following Stage 2, we have added wording to our original amendment to make it clear that these electors do have the right to cast a vote without the need for them to be further assisted by another individual, and that's been raised during the Westminster election period recently. Because the reality is that, more than 150 years since the Voting Act, which guaranteed the right to vote independently and in secret for some, at least, blind and partially sighted people continue to be deprived of their most fundamental democratic right.\n\nVoting is a visual practice of reading the ballot paper to find the correct box that is relevant to your own choice of candidate, and to place a mark in that box. This means that the vast majority of blind people are forced to share their voting intentions either with a member of the family, a friend or the staff at a polling station. Blind voters say that they feel that they are being belittled and disappointed by the system, and in some case they aren't even sure who they actually voted for, which is entirely unacceptable.\n\nAs the recent report by the RNIB on this issue emphasises, fewer than one in five—19 per cent—of blind voters were able to cast their vote independently and secretly in the elections held in 2021, for example. It's about time that we tackle this democratic deficit, and the technology is available, including tactile and audio solutions.\n\nI would also like to praise Cardiff and the Vale of Glamorgan councils who have taken it upon themselves to establish a service that reads ballot papers over the phone to support blind and partially sighted voters. The RNIB is working with both authorities to promote and evaluate this phone service. This shows that solutions are possible and that this issue could be resolved quite simply without incurring additional costs, if the political will to do that existed.\n\nI have to say that I wasn't content with the Counsel General's response on this issue at Stage 2. There is inconsistency in the Government's view, insisting on the one hand that these provisions can be introduced by subordinate legislation, whilst also claiming that introducing these standards will create inconsistency between Welsh elections and Westminster elections. We are clear that we have an opportunity to lead the way in Wales, and that it is primary legislation that is the best vehicle to deliver this. We will therefore be moving this amendment.\n\nDiolch, Llywydd, and thank you for all the points that have been made, and they've been well made. My preferred approach, as I did say at Stage 2, is to place duties on returning officers via subordinate legislation. The Welsh Government and, certainly, I want to make Welsh elections as accessible as possible for all voters. I am very keen to learn from other elections, including the general election later on this week, to make sure that we get this right for Wales. So, whilst I agree with the principles of the amendments, I'm not supporting these amendments due to the election rules framework in place in Wales.\n\nAs I set out at Stage 2, and it's already been mentioned, our preferred approach is to place duties on returning officers via the rules contained in secondary legislation to provide such equipment as is reasonable to help disabled people vote independently according to Electoral Commission guidance.\n\nAmendment 30 would require returning officers to consider guidance from the Welsh Government, rather than the independent and impartial Electoral Commission. I don't think this is preferable. It would also lead to different duties and different guidance for returning officers for reserved and devolved elections in relation to accessibility. This could cause complexity for electoral administrators and confusion for voters. But I am very keen to learn from existing research and feedback from recent elections and, as I've said, from the forthcoming general election, to ensure that we do get this right for Wales.\n\nBut I do think that it should be via secondary legislation and Electoral Commission guidance and other measures, rather than a duty on the face of this Bill. Feedback from recent elections has shown that voter awareness could be improved, and we are looking at that through the elections information platform as well.These issues should be addressed in secondary legislation, where similar provisions are already located. These are set out in the National Assembly for Wales (Representation of the People) Order 2007, known as the conduct Order, and the local elections rules 2021.\n\nThe Bill itself will provide a level of accountability by placing a duty on the Electoral Commission to report on the steps taken by returning officers to assist persons with disabilities to vote at the election. This approach will mirror that taken by the Elections Act 2022, and it means that there can be local flexibility to provide appropriate equipment and support to remove barriers to voting independently and in secret, whilst also giving voters a consistent experience between Welsh and reserved elections. We still have the option to consider further provisions, as we develop secondary legislation.\n\nFor Senedd elections, we have made a commitment to consolidate and restate the law as part of an accessible, bilingual framework, for the first time, ahead of the 2026 election. We intend to consult on a bilingual consolidated draft Order, so that stakeholders will have an opportunity to consider proposed changes in detail. We look forward to and very much value continued engagement with all stakeholders in the development of this secondary legislation.\n\nI do agree with the sentiment of the amendments, to ensure that voters are able to vote without the need for further assistance from any other person. I would like to place on record my commitment to ensuring that voters are able to vote independently and in secret, and to protecting that fundamental democratic right in Wales, through legislative, but also, importantly, through non-legislative measures. Diolch, Llywydd.\n\nWe do oppose amendments 17 and 18 because we strongly believe that creating this platform is an excellent opportunity to raise levels of democratic engagement and public awareness of how democracy works. In light of this, we have also "
