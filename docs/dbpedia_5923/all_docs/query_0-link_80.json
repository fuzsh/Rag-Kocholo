        "text": "The Scottish National Party (SNP) ( Scottish Gaelic: Pàrtaidh Nàiseanta na h-Alba; Scots: Scottis Naitional Pairtie) is the largest political party campaigning for the independence of Scotland. Its stated aim is \"to create a just, caring and enterprising society by releasing Scotland's full potential as an independent nation in the mainstream of modern Europe.\" The party's social democratic platform is largely considered centre-left in the Scottish/UK political spectrum. The SNP's left-wing nationalism, based on equality, popular sovereignty and national self-determination, is a characteristic shared with other Celtic Nationalist parties such as Plaid Cymru, Mebyon Kernow, Social Democratic and Labour Party and Sinn Féin.\n\nThe SNP was founded in 1934, and has had continuous parliamentary representation since Winnie Ewing's groundbreaking victory at the 1967 Hamilton by-election. With sporadic gains since, the SNP has tended to fare poorly in United Kingdom general elections and currently holds 6 of 59 Scottish seats in the UK Parliament.\n\nIn the last few decades, the party has usually polled the second highest number of votes for a political party in Scotland. This changed in 2007 when the SNP ended 50 years of Labour dominance in the country by winning 47 of the 129 seats in the third Scottish Parliamentary election. As a result of becoming the largest party in the Scottish Parliament the SNP sought to form a coalition government, but after talks broke down with the other parties they formed a minority administration. The first SNP administration has been noted for its relative stability compared to previous coalition administrations, due to only having two reshuffles within three years (the second of which was minor). The previous administrations had very frequent reshuffles, with very few members staying throughout the eight year rule of the Liberal-Labour Coalition of 1999-2007.\n\nAt the 2007 Local Elections, the SNP won 363 council seats of 1,224 (doubling its 2003 total of 181 councillors), making them the largest group in Scottish local government and helping form in coalition 12 out of 32 local administrations. The next council elections will be in 2012, due to legislative action taken by the SNP in the Scottish Parliament to divide the dates of the Holyrood and Local Elections into 2011 and 2012 respectively - on the advice of the Gould Report.\n\nAt the 2009 European Parliament election the party topped the poll for the first time in a European Parliament election since 1979, with almost 100,000 more votes than the Scottish Labour Party. The party holds 2 of 6 Scottish seats in the European Parliament, narrowly failing to win a Third seat by less than 1%.\n\nHistory\n\nThe SNP was formed in 1934 from the merger of the National Party of Scotland and the Scottish Party. Professor Douglas Young, who was the leader of the Scottish National Party from 1942 to 1945 fought for the Scottish people to refuse conscription and his activities were popularly vilified as undermining the British war effort against the Nazis. Young was imprisoned for refusing to be conscripted. The SNP first won a parliamentary seat at the Motherwell by-election in 1945, but Dr Robert McIntyre MP lost the seat at the general election three months later. They next won a seat in 1967, when Winnie Ewing was the surprise winner of a by-election in the previously safe Labour seat of Hamilton. This brought the SNP to national prominence, leading to the establishment of the Kilbrandon Commission. The high point in UK General Elections thus far was when the SNP polled almost a third of all votes in Scotland at the October 1974 general election and returned 11 MPs to Westminster, to date the most MPs it has had. The SNP's nationalism is left-wing nationalism, not right wing, a trait which it shares with other Celtic Nationalist parties such as Plaid Cymru and Sinn Féin.\n\nParty leaders\n\nAlexander MacEwan (1934–1936)\n\nAndrew Dewar Gibb (1936–1940)\n\nWilliam Power (1940–1942)\n\nDouglas Young (1942–1945)\n\nBruce Watson (1945–1947)\n\nRobert McIntyre (1947–1956)\n\nJames Halliday (1956–1960)\n\nArthur Donaldson (1960–1969)\n\nWilliam Wolfe (1969–1979)\n\nGordon Wilson (1979–1990)\n\nAlex Salmond (1990–2000)\n\nJohn Swinney (2000–2004)\n\nAlex Salmond (2004–present)\n\nParliamentary leaders\n\nAlex Salmond (1999–2000)\n\nJohn Swinney (2000–2004)\n\nNicola Sturgeon (2004–2007)\n\nAlex Salmond (2007–present)\n\nParty organisation\n\nThe SNP consists of local branches of party members. Those branches then form an association in the constituency they represent (unless there is only one branch in the constituency, in which case it forms a constituency branch rather than a constituency association). There are also eight regional associations, to which the branches and constituency associations can send delegates.\n\nThe SNP's policy structure is developed at its annual national conference and its regular national council meetings. There are also regular meetings of its national assembly, at which detailed discussion (but not finalising) of party policy takes place.\n\nThe party has an active youth wing as well as a student wing. There is also an SNP Trade Union Group. There is an independently-owned monthly newspaper, The Scots Independent, which is highly supportive of the party.\n\nThe SNP's leadership is vested in its National Executive Committee (NEC) which is made up of the party's elected office bearers and six elected members (voted for at conference). The SNP parliamentarians (Scottish, Westminster and European) and councillors have representation on the NEC, as do the Trade Union Group, the youth wing and the student wing.\n\nAccording to accounts filed with the Electoral Commission for the year ending 2008, the party had a membership of 15,097 in 2008, up from 9,450 in 2003. In 2004 the party had income of approximately £1,300,000 (including bequests of just under £300,000) and expenditure of about £1,000,000.\n\nPolicy platform\n\nThe SNP's policy base is, by and large, in the mainstream European social democratic mould. For example, among its policies are a commitment to unilateral nuclear disarmament, progressive personal taxation and the eradication of poverty, free state education including support grants for higher education students and a pay increase for nurses. It is also committed to an independent Scotland being a full member state of the European Union, to the country joining the single European currency at the appropriate exchange rate and is against membership of NATO (however this remains controversial).\n\nContrary to the expectations of many outside the party, the SNP is not expressly republican, and its general view is that this is an issue secondary to that of Scottish independence. Many SNP members are republicans, however, and both the party student and youth wings are expressly so.\n\nThe SNP is committed to an independent Scotland within the Commonwealth of Nations.\n\nIn August 2009 as part of its third legislative term in the Scottish Parliament, the Government proposes to debate the Scottish referendum bill 2010, which would set out a planned referendum for 30th November 2010 on the issue of Scottish independence. It was not however expected to pass, due to opposition from all the major opposition parties in the Parliament.\n\nParty ideology\n\nAlthough it is has a representative majority of the moderate left-of-centre politicians, this has not always been the case. Almost from the party's foundation there have been internal ideological tensions. This was largely a product of the way in which the left-of-centre National Party of Scotland amalgamated with the right-of-centre Scottish Party. Nowadays, ideological tensions within the SNP have been partially resolved.\n\nHowever, by the 1960s, the party was starting to become defined ideologically. It had by then established a National Assembly which allowed for discussion of policy and was producing papers on a host of policy issues that could be described as social democratic. Also, the emergence of William Wolfe (universally known as Billy) as a leading figure played a huge role in the SNP defining itself as a left-of-centre social-democratic party. He recognised the need to do this to challenge the dominant political position of the Scottish Labour Party.\n\nHe achieved this in a number of ways: establishing the SNP Trade Union Group; promoting left-of-centre policies; and identifying the SNP with labour campaigns (such as the Upper-Clyde Shipbuilders Work-in and the attempt of the workers at the Scottish Daily Express to run as a cooperative). It was during Wolfe's period as SNP leader in the 1970s that the SNP became clearly identified as a social-democratic political party.\n\nThere were some ideological tensions in the 1970s SNP. The party leadership under Wolfe was determined to stay on the left of the Scottish political spectrum and be in a position to challenge Labour. However, the party's MPs, mostly representing seats won from the Conservatives, were less keen to have the SNP viewed as a left-of-centre alternative to Labour, for fear of losing their seats back to the Conservatives.\n\nThere were further ideological and internal struggles after 1979 with the 79 Group attempting to move the SNP further to the left, away from being what could be described a 'social-democratic' party, to an expressly 'socialist' party. 79 Group members including current leader, Alex Salmond, were expelled from the party. This produced a response in the shape of the Campaign for Nationalism in Scotland from those who wanted the SNP to remain a 'broad church', apart from arguments of left vs. right.\n\nThe 1980s saw the SNP further define itself as a party of the left, for example running campaigns against the poll tax. It developed this platform to the stage it is at now: a clear, moderate, centre-left political party. This has itself not gone without internal criticism from the left of the party who believe that in modern years the party has become too moderate.\n\nThe ideological tensions inside the SNP are further complicated by the arguments between gradualists and fundamentalists. In essence, gradualists seek to advance Scotland to independence through further devolution, in a 'step-by-step' strategy. They tend to be in the moderate -left grouping, although much of the 79 Group was gradualist in approach. However, this 79 Group gradualism was as much a reaction against the fundamentalists of the day, many of whom believed the SNP should not take a clear left or right position.\n\nThe position of fundamentalists within the SNP is further complicated by the fact that modern fundamentalists are unlike the old-style. They tend to be on the left of the party, critical of both the gradualist approach to independence and what they perceive as a moderation of the party's socio-economic policy portfolio.\n\nThis grouping of \"neo-fundamentalists\" have their roots within the camp of the former high-profile Labour Party MP Jim Sillars who left Labour to form the short-lived Scottish Labour Party in the 1970s (it had no connection with the UK Labour Party or the current Scottish Labour group in the Scottish Parliament). Sillars eventually joined the SNP, winning the Govan, Glasgow, by-election in 1988 to become an SNP MP. He lost the Westminster seat at the 1992 general election and expressed his disappointment by calling the Scottish people 'Ninety minute patriots'.\n\nEuropean Free Alliance\n\nThe SNP retains close links with Plaid Cymru and MPs of both parties co-operate closely with each other. They work as a single group within the House of Commons, and were involved in joint campaigning during the 2005 General Election campaign. Both are in the European Free Alliance (EFA), which works with the European Green Party to form a grouping in the European Parliament: the Greens - European Free Alliance. Although there is no coalition in the Scottish Parliament (the SNP having run a minority government since May 2007) the Scottish Greens supported the appointment of the government under an agreement which also specified areas of common policy and gave the Greens input to the budget process and convenorship of the parliamentary committee on transport, infrastructure and climate change.\n\nMinisters and spokespeople\n\nSee also: Government of the 3rd Scottish Parliament, Scottish Government, Members of the 3rd Scottish Parliament\n\nPortfolio SNP Spokesperson Leader of the Scottish National Party\n\nFirst Minister of Scotland Rt Hon Alex Salmond MSP Depute Leader of the Scottish National Party\n\nDeputy First Minister of Scotland, Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing Nicola Sturgeon MSP Minister for Parliamentary Business Bruce Crawford MSP Minister for Culture and External Affairs Fiona Hyslop MSP Cabinet Secretary for Finance and Sustainable Growth John Swinney MSP Minister for Enterprise, Energy and Tourism Jim Mather MSP Minister for Transport, Infrastructure and Climate Change Stewart Stevenson MSP Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning Michael Russell MSP Minister for Schools and Skills Keith Brown MSP Minister for Children and Early Years Adam Ingram MSP Minister for Public Health and Sport Shona Robison MSP Minister for Communities Alex Neil MSP Cabinet Secretary for Justice Kenny MacAskill MSP Minister for Community Safety Fergus Ewing MSP Cabinet Secretary for Rural Affairs and the Environment Richard Lochhead MSP Minister for Environment Roseanna Cunningham MSP President of the Party Ian Hudghton MEP SNP Westminster Group Leader, Spokesperson for Foreign Affairs and for Defence Angus Robertson MP SNP Westminster Deputy Group Leader and Chief Whip, Economy and Treasury spokesperson Stewart Hosie MP SNP Westminster Trade and Industry and Energy spokesman Michael Weir MP SNP Westminster Work and Pensions Spokesperson John Mason MP\n\nElected representatives (current)\n\nMembers of the Scottish Parliament\n\nMSP Constituency or Region Brian Adam Aberdeen North Alasdair Allan Western Isles Keith Brown Ochil Aileen Campbell South of Scotland Willie Coffey Kilmarnock and Loudoun Angela Constance Livingston Bruce Crawford Stirling Roseanna Cunningham Perth Nigel Don North East Scotland Bob Doris Glasgow Fergus Ewing Inverness East, Nairn and Lochaber Linda Fabiani Central Scotland Joe FitzPatrick Dundee West Kenneth Gibson Cunninghame North Rob Gibson Highlands and Islands Christine Grahame South of Scotland Chris Harvie Mid Scotland and Fife Jamie Hepburn Central Scotland Fiona Hyslop Lothians Adam Ingram South of Scotland Bill Kidd Glasgow Richard Lochhead Moray Kenny MacAskill Edinburgh East and Musselburgh Tricia Marwick Central Fife Jim Mather Argyll and Bute Michael Matheson Falkirk West Stewart Maxwell West of Scotland Ian McKee Lothians Christina McKelvie Central Scotland Anne McLaughlin Glasgow Stuart McMillan West of Scotland Alasdair Morgan South of Scotland Alex Neil Central Scotland Gil Paterson Central Scotland Shona Robison Dundee East Michael Russell South of Scotland Alex Salmond Gordon Shirley-Anne Somerville Lothians Stewart Stevenson Banff and Buchan Nicola Sturgeon Glasgow Govan John Swinney North Tayside Dave Thompson Highlands and Islands Maureen Watt North East Scotland Andrew Welsh Angus Sandra White Glasgow Bill Wilson West of Scotland John Wilson Central Scotland\n\nMembers of Parliament\n\nMember of Parliament Surname, Firstname Constituency First elected Notes Stewart Hosie Hosie, Stewart Dundee East 2005 Angus MacNeil MacNeil, Angus Na h-Eileanan an Iar (Western Isles) 2005 Angus Robertson Robertson, Angus Moray 2001 Mike Weir Weir, Mike Angus 2001 Eilidh Whiteford Whiteford, Eilidh Banff and Buchan 2010 Pete Wishart Wishart, Pete Perth and North Perthshire 2001\n\nMembers of the European Parliament\n\nConstituency MEP First elected Scotland Ian Hudghton 1998 Alyn Smith 2004\n\nCouncillors\n\nThe SNP has more than 360 councillors in Local Government elected from the Scottish local elections, 2007.\n\nThe SNP has set itself a target of 20 Westminster seats for the next 2010 United Kingdom general election.

In 2000, the Labour party said that two SNP members of the Scottish Parliament were anti-English after they \"registered their support for Germany's (2006 Football World Cup) bid on its official website\". The SNP responded that they \"have no position on where the World Cup is held\" and that it was \"silly to describe the website entry as anti-English\".\n\nIn 1999, Scottish comedian Billy Connolly, a staunch Labour Party supporter, was quoted as saying, \"the Scottish Parliament is a joke\"; he also claimed that \"this new racism in Scotland, this anti-Englishness\" was \"entirely their [the SNP's] fault\". The SNP responded that Scots \"are enthusiastic about the parliament and will dismiss his absurd remarks about the SNP for the nonsense they are.\"\n\nProminent figures in Scottish politics such as Labour's George Foulkes, Baron Foulkes of Cumnock and the Liberal Democrats' Jamie Stone (and subsequently Danny Alexander) have publicly apologised for calling the SNP \"xenophobic\". SNP MSP Ian McKee has by contrast pointed out his own status in the Scottish Parliament chamber as an Englishman as evidence of there being no such anti-English feeling. Indeed, McKee is one of six SNP MSPs born in England, along with other prominent figures such as Christine Grahame and Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning Mike Russell.\n\nAccusations of 'cash for policies'\n\nThe party has been criticised over a £500,000 donation from the transport businessman Brian Souter. One month later, in April 2007, the SNP's commitment (made at the party's 2006 conference) to re-regulate the bus network was not included in their 2007 manifesto, although the SNP denies any direct link. Opposition politicians suggested that the donation and policy shift were linked and that it was a case of \"cash for policies\", although no official accusations have been made."
