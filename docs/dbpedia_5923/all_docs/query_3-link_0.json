        "text": "These are the key policies in Plaid Cymru’s manifesto:\n\nA £20bn Welsh green jobs revolution\n\nCreate tens of thousands of jobs by kick-starting an investment programme with a goal of making Wales free from carbon and single-use plastic by 2030.\n\nThe creation of a trans-Wales railway and a cross-rail for the south Wales valleys. The electrification of all mainline rail lines by 2030.\n\nThe construction of tidal lagoons in Swansea Bay and Cardiff in the south and Colwyn Bay in the north.\n\nAn offshore windfarm off Ynys Môn (Anglesey) and a barrage on the River Usk in south Wales.\n\nThe rollout of a £5bn home-energy efficiency programme and the building of 20,000 green social houses.\n\nCaring for everyone\n\nFree social care for the elderly and vulnerable. An additional 1,000 doctors, 5,000 nurses and 100 NHS dentists.\n\nUniversal free childcare for 40 hours a week and a £35 a week payment for every child in low-income families, lifting 50,000 children in Wales out of poverty. Also an extra £300m for schools and colleges.\n\nCrime and justice\n\nCreate a Welsh justice system, devolved policing and recruit a further 1,600 police officers, at least two for every community in Wales.\n\nBrexit\n\nA “final-say” referendum in which Plaid will campaign for remain. The manifesto claims a no-deal Brexit would leave farmers facing crippling tariffs on products and harm manufacturing and citizens’ rights.\n\nPlaid would create a Welsh migration advisory service to plug skills gaps.\n\nConstitution\n\nPlaid believes Wales should become an independent member of the EU by 2030 or before if possible.\n\nIt would press for further devolution of financial powers to the Welsh assembly and devolution of broadcasting.\n\nFinance\n\nThe manifesto says the present Barnett formula for distributing funding to the devolved countries has been largely unchanged for 40 years and is not fit for purpose. It should be replaced by an office for fair funding.\n\nPlaid calls for Westminster to allocate an additional 1% of GDP to invest in green infrastructure over the next decade.\n\nIt would scrap Trident.\n\nWelsh language\n\nA new “high-status” organisation to bolster the Welsh language would be set up.\n\nMPs should have the right to speak Welsh in the House of Commons.\n\nWestminster changes\n\nAbolish first past the post system, replace with the single transferable vote.\n\nOverhaul the House of Lords, replacing it with a directly elected upper chamber."
