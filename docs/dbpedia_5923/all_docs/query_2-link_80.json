        "text": "Introduction\n\nSpring 2022 marks the centenary of WCIA’s predecessor, the Welsh League of Nations Union, becoming the formally constituted body that by the late 1920s would grow into one of Wales’ largest and most successful social movements of the interwar era – with over 1,000 branches active in most Welsh communities, and over 60,000 paid up members actively campaigning on internationalist issues of the day. Previous features on the WLNU have explored some of its key figures – such as Lord David Davies, Rev Gwilym Davies, Annie Hughes Griffiths, and Winifred Coombe-Tennant; and uncovered some of the inspiring campaigns originated by the WLNU, such as Wales’ Youth Message of Peace & Goodwill, the Welsh Women’s Peace Petition to America, Aberystwyth’s World Peace Congress, the 1935 Peace Ballot, and the story of Wales Temple of Peace & Health from conception to opening by war-bereaved mothers of Wales and the World.\n\nMany of these remarkable accounts prompt present-day readers to marvel: “how did they do it?“ From a modern era in which social media and mass communication is the norm, and global campaigns can be signed up to (or indeed, dismissed) with a click of a button, it can seem incomprehensible that 100 hundred years ago an entirely voluntary, civil society movement could have marshalled such public opinion across Wales as to influence not just policy-makers on the world stage (such as in the League of Nations’ headquarters in Geneva) but whole populations (such as the ‘hearth to hearth’ messaging of the Women’s Peace appeal).\n\nThis feature takes a step back from the figureheads and the headline-catching campaigns of the Welsh League of Nations Union, to look beneath the bonnet at the mechanics of the WLNU’s operations: how it came into being, its organisational structure, the WLNU’s place within wider movements of the time, how League activities were organised, the people behind the scenes, bread-and-butter branch activism between the big campaigns, and a sense of the ‘timeline’ that joins together the League’s many achievements over the interwar era. So often, these can be viewed as the ‘boring bits’ less relevant to study questions or feature articles. But for any movement to ‘move’, like any vehicle it needs an engine, and fuel.\n\nThere can be little doubt that social justiceafter World War 1 fuelled the motivations of a generation of Welsh people to build a better world; and the Welsh League of Nations Union constructed an engine finely calibrated to the social context of the time to harness this energy and power a movement – the interwar generation’s very own ‘Justice League’\n\nFounding of the WLNU\n\nA ‘Welsh League of Nations Union’ was first proposed by David Davies of Llandinam from the stage of the National Eisteddfod in Neath in August 1918– 3 months before the WW1 Armistice, and 2 months before the formation of the British LNU. Given broad unease at the terms of the Paris Peace Process / Treaty of Versailles, which imposed crippling reparations on the people of Germany, many Welsh men and women were supportive of an International League of Nations in principle; and 3,000 members signed up by the end of 1918. However, for its first couple of years, the Welsh movement was a regional subsidiary of the British movement – which encouraged community branches throughout Britain.\n\nThe British League of Nations Union (LNU) was formed in October 1918, with the amalgamation of the League of Nations Society (LNS) and the League of Free Nations Association (LFNA), both established during WW1 to promote international cooperation.\n\nThe League of Nations international body itself came into being on January 10 1920. An International Federation, the IFLNS – International Federation of League of Nations Societies – was set up in parallel to coordinate LNU Societies developing in 40 countries, with a HQ in Brussels (latterly Geneva from 1934), and was granted a Royal Charter in 1925 by King George V.\n\nWales was designated a ‘regional committee’ within the British LNU, chaired by David Davies; although it adopted the title of ‘Welsh National Council’ in anticipation of more ambitious plans. A regional office was set up in Museum Place, Cardiff with an administrative staff of 3. The first national gathering in support of a Welsh League was convened for Whitsuntide 1920 (May 25th) in Llandrindod Wells’ Albert Hall, with a public meeting in the evening with the attraction of a ‘vocal recital’, as well as 5 high profile speakers. The 1920 Llandrindod Meeting approved formation of a provisional Executive Committee to develop plans for a distinct Welsh membership body.\n\nRecords of internal correspondence over 1921-22 suggest progress with the British LNU was slow, the Cardiff regional office considered ineffectual administratively and as a campaigning support ‘engine’. By January 1922, David Davies and the Executive Committee decided to ‘take control’ of Wales’ own affairs. On 10 January 1922, David Davies invited Gwilym Davies and a small group of respected organisers to a ‘Llandinam summit’ at his home of Plas Dinam, Powys, to set about founding and properly funding a semi-autonomous national body that would ‘mobilise the people of Gwalia’ – independent, though complementary, to the British Union.\n\nGwilym Davies, well known as a dynamic organiser and preacher, drafted proposals for a ‘plan of campaign’ that would enable every community in Wales to play an active role in organising for world peace – involving local branches, women, children, churches, schools, parliamentarians, civic leaders and international allies.\n\nOn 31 Jan 1922, at the WLNU’s Executive Committee in Shrewsbury, David Davies pledged an endowment to fund the annual running costs of the WLNU, to be supplemented through membership income to resource its campaigning work. Gwilym Davies was formally invited to take on the role of Honorary Director, and tasked with undertaking a review of the existing office and staffing with a view to restructuring and equipping Cardiff to support a national campaigning infrastructure: a virtual ‘Reformation’ of the WLNU, over Spring 1922, reporting his findings and recommendations to the board on 22 April.\n\nDavid Davies meanwhile canvassed the ‘great and the good’ of Wales for potential membership of the WLNU’s Welsh National Council; and undertook a fact-finding trip to America over March 1922, to meet potential allies for the British LNU and in the American Welsh diaspora, from which he produced a report outlining his perceived strengths and weaknesses of the various bodies at that point failing to successfully make the public case for the United States to join and lead the League.\n\nBy Easter 1922, the WLNU staged their inaugural Annual conference in Llandrindod Wells, attended by representatives of LNU branches Wales-wide. Gwilym Davies’ proposed annual campaign programme was approved, and 20 leading figures elected to the WNC, following which, the WLNU’s first ‘public meeting’ was held that evening.\n\nFollowing Easter’s proceedings, Gwilym Davies wrote to the British LNU with proposed changes to the LNU constitution enabling the WLNU to function with a degree of national autonomy. In accepting these amendments, British LNU Chair Gilbert Murray recorded that he was ‘delighted’ at the drive of Wales’ campaign for world peace alongside the strength of its ongoing commitment to the wider British movement.\n\nThe WLNU within wider Peace & Social movements\n\nThe concept of Civil Society, and of Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) as many charities, community and volunteering groups are known today – the ‘Third Sector’ (after State and Business sectors) – is a relatively recent construct, and not immediately apparent in archival materials and accounts of the pre-WW1 or interwar eras. Today’s WCVA (Wales Council for Voluntary Action), itself founded in 1934 as the S Wales Council for Social Service, acts as an umbrella for 25 broad ‘sectors’ of activity across 22 CVCs (County Voluntary Councils) Wales-wide – many of whom have their roots in the Great Depression of the 1930s and post-WW2 reconstruction, and the social pressures / coordination needs these crises created.\n\nThis lower visibility of CSO coordination however in no way reflects the scale of community organisation, causes and social movements in which people of Wales were active pre-1930s; one only has to look at the breadth of participation in the Women’s Suffrage and Trade Union movements. Philanthropy and charity engaged the upper and middle classes, whilst downright necessity for the working classes, disenfranchised and excluded, drove widespread involvement in issues that brought people together across societal divides. The aftermath of WW1, for a nation riven by grief, galvanised a generation determined to pursue peace measures that would bring substance to the Armistice pledge of ‘Never Again’. Into this space, a whole ‘peace movement’ of grassroots community and interest groups, political advocacy and coordination bodies rapidly absorbed and orchestrated this mass public participation in what pre-WW1 had been a ‘niche’ sector of peace and internationalism – with varying degrees of inclusion, exclusion and success.\n\nIt is estimated that over 50 UK national peace organisations existed in the early 1920s, (Richard Davis, 2017) [1] spanning the whole political and ideological spectrum – from faith-driven bodies such as the Fellowship of Reconciliation (Cymdeithas y Cymod in Wales) to the more overtly political ‘No More War Movement’ and Labour & Socialist International. It is important to note that as today, issue-based movements also sprung up in response to specific international events, such as the International Brigades and Refugee Committees responding to the Spanish Civil War – although they too would have an impact that would cast a profound ideological legacy.\n\nThe nature of pacifism advocated by many groups through this era is open to differing interpretations and historical debate. Martin Ceadal, 2000[2]and 2014[3]explores in detail the internal politics, factions and fractures across the British peace movement, through a period of immediate post-WW1 unpopularity when patriotic jingoism of ‘winning the war’ and the ‘glory of empire’ eclipsed most calls for cooperation. However, the pendulum of public opinion soon swung from one extreme to another, with perhaps one of the most visible ‘voltes face’ being the election to parliament by 1923 of Conscientious Objectors formerly reviled and imprisoned during WW1, such as Merthyr’s Morgan Jones. As the public became jaded by realities of post-war reconstruction, and realised the risk of future conflicts from potentially ineffective Peace Treaties and institutions,\n\nPeace Movements quickly witnessed by a rapid revival, expansion and ascension.\n\nThe British LNU’s position as the ‘respectable, cross-party face’ of the peace movement placed it on the (small ‘c’) conservative side of many more radical voices. The LNU went to great lengths to maintain a ‘broad church’ of beliefs and ideologies, a deliberate strategy to maximise public appeal, promote debate and dialogue, and avoid the fragmentation visible principally among more left-leaning movements. Whilst the LNU’s natural ‘centre of gravity’ was among Liberal politicians of the day[4], it consequently attracted establishment figures across the political spectrum – from Labour’s Ramsey MacDonald and many early Trade Unionists, to Stanley Baldwin and Winston Churchill as leading Conservatives.\n\nThe Welsh League of Nations Union was a semi-autonomous region within the British LNU, directly administering all affairs within Wales. In practice, Welsh local branches paid their membership fees to the Welsh WLNU Office, of which a proportion (approximately 1/3) was transferred annually to the British LNU, the remaining 2/3 contributing to the running costs of campaigns and membership support activities in Wales.\n\nWales’ National Council took policy stances that could often appear more progressive or ‘radical’ than the LNU centrally, though regularly paving the way for the British League to follow – for example, in supporting David Davies’ idea of an International Police Force in the early 1930s (the origins of the UN Security Council and UN Peacekeeping), initially endorsed by the WLNU and latterly by the British body. Many Welsh campaigns capitalised on national character and identity – ‘Wales doing its own thing’ (eg Women’s Peace Appeal of 1923). Where supporting UK-wide LNU initiatives (eg the 1935 Peace Ballot), the WLNU explicitly encouraged a competitive motivation, challenging Welsh activists to ‘be the best’ region in the UK (eg ‘Wales tops the polls’).\n\nIn the runup to World War 2, the Welsh League took an earlier and more affirmative anti-appeasement stance than the LNU centrally, WLNU’s 1935 conference in Rhyl having backed use of force and shared League intervention against Germany, Italy and Japan as aggressor states. However, this stance divided Wales’ peace movement at the time, an ideological rift articulated by Ceadal as Pacifism vs Pacificism[5], which not only defined identified within the peace movement, but also the credibility with which proposals were received by policy makers:\n\n“Anti-war sentiments expressed by movements such as the League of Nations Union and Peace Pledge Union were in fact widely shared from within official circles. The more clear-cut pacifists however – who refused to support a policy of either rearmament or of collective security in the name of the League of Nations – had little input into policy making and their ideas and leaders were, for the most part, dismissed out of hand.” Martin Ceadal\n\nAt a local level, WLNU and other peace activists (in particular across the faith and women’s movements) were encouraged to work together, though the degree to which this was effective depended how closely aligned the beliefs of local groups were. As Richard Davies [6] has observed, the contrasts between ‘Pacifists and Pacificists’ could drive divisions in some campaigns, and build bridges for others.\n\nThese fundamental differences in world views between pacifism and pacificism remain as relevant to internationalist movements today, not only in Wales, but across the world: indeed, we see them being played out in current media debates over the conduct of Russia’s war in Ukraine, with questions over whether the UK and others should provide arms and / or military assistance to the invaded state, and the nature of action to take against an aggressor state that ignores international norms. The WCIA today facilitates discussion around the very same debates that the Welsh League of Nations movement grappled with one hundred years ago.\n\n[1] Davis, Richard 2017 ‘The British Peace Movement in the Interwar Years’; Revue Francaise de Civilisation Britannique / French Journal of British Studies (online), XXII-3, online since 5 July 2017.\n\n[2] Ceadel, Martin, 2000 “Semi-detached Idealists: the British Peace Movement and International Relations, 1854-1945\n\n[3] Ceadel, Martin, 2014 The Peace Movement: overview of a British Brand Leader’\n\n[4] (the Liberal Party having swept to office from 1906 (particularly across Wales, with David Lloyd George), but supplanted by Labour over the 1920s as the ‘second party’ of British politics)\n\n[5] Pacificism advocates prevention of war including use (or threat) of armed force as a last resort – for example to kerb aggressors who break agreements of collective security.\n\n[6] Davis, Richard 2017 ‘The British Peace Movement in the Interwar Years’; Revue Francaise de Civilisation Britannique / French Journal of British Studies (online), XXII-3, online since 5 July 2017\n\nWLNU Structure\n\nThe WLNU was a membership-based voluntary / civil society organisation (CSO) with a national reach, adopting a classic ‘democratic structure’ of a Welsh National Council, with District Committees for each county of Wales supporting local adult and junior branches, to which individual members were registered. A conference structure facilitated participation in decision-making, both at a district level between neighbouring branches, and at a national level where WLNU policy was debated and formulated. ‘Youth Festivals’, ‘Peace Pageants’, Eisteddfodau, competitions and other such more informal participatory events were organised by branches , with support from the WLNU’s national council members, and Regional Organiser staff of 2.\n\nThe Welsh National Council (WNC)\n\nThe WNC of the LNU (from 1920, which formally became the Welsh League of Nations Union from 1922) involved a wide swathe of ‘the great and the good’ of interwar Wales:\n\nThe WNC over the course of its existence established a number of subsidiary bodies:\n\nAlmost from the outset, a North Wales Committee was constituted involving those Executive Committee members based in NW and NE Wales.\n\nAlso within the first months of the WLNU’s creation, the Welsh Education Advisory Committee (WEAC) was established as a body bringing together teachers of Wales, practitioners and leading educationalists, quickly establishing an international reputation for the quality of their work on curriculum development and resources which were replicated thrugh the League in Geneva. The WEAC were later commissioned by the WW2 Allied Governments to draft proposals for a post-war International Education Organisation, out of which emerged UNESCO.\n\nThe Women’s Advisory Committee had its origins in early 1923 with organisation of the Welsh Women’s Peace petition to America, organising a conference in Aberystwyth and then national, regional and local coordination fora to coordinate the gathering of the 390,296 signatures ultimately sent to the women of the USA. Whist women continued to organise through the WLNU, it was not until May 1933 that a dedicated Women’s Advisory Committee (WAC) was formally constituted.\n\nKey Figureheads in the WLNU\n\nThe WLNU attracted support of many of the ‘great and the good’ of Wales, seen as a ‘respectable face’ among a 1920s peace movement with divergent factions, voices and political persuasions. However, many individuals played roles far in excess of association, or sitting on committees. Some WLNU key movers and shakers – mostly people of substantial privilege – were in themselves ‘peace champions’ of the interwar era, active across multiple peace bodies and networks.\n\nWLNU Staffing and Organisation\n\nOffices and Administration\n\nWhen initially set up as a regional branch of the British LNU in 1920, a small office was set up at 6 Cathedral Road, Cardiff with a secretarial staff of 3: a Chief Clerk and Assistant, under an Acting Secretary, the Rev D C Davies. It seems there was dissatisfaction at the capacity and capability of the Cardiff office to support the movement in Wales; following the Llandinam Conference of Jan 1920, Rev Gwilym Davies’ was asked to lead an ‘operational review’ to create an effective campaigning and support structure (insinuating that existing arrangements were not up to scratch). Gwilym Davies’ Hon Directors Report of March 1922 pulled no punches: “I took charge of the office in February 1920, and found that it was ill equipped, with no proper systems of keeping accounts, or of records, or of filing. The staff consisted of two clerks… Miss Thomas has been with the Council from the beginning, and shows real keenness in the work. The other… terminated his engagement on March 16.” Correspondence from Capt Harri Williams references “the Chief Clerk… owing to his incompetency, has to go.”\n\nBackground correspondence sheds further light on ‘office politics’ behind the scenes, between David Davies’ apparent desire to shape the Welsh Union in his image, and Gwilym Davies’ assessment that “the whole of the organisation of the Union in Wales has to be restarted ‘do novo’”. Captain Williams – who had been asked by David Davies to ‘step in’ as General Secretary – cautioned the founder’s desire to install his own people, saying: “there is danger of the League in Wales being looked on as your personal movement, and if I accepted the post, it might give colour to that view.” It is suggested the Rev D C Davies had expected to be appointed as General Secretary, having delivered well-received speeches to meetings (though with no managerial expertise). He was instead asked to become the WLNU’s Speaker, regarded as a ‘relegation’. However, Rev DC Davies went on to perform the role as speaker and meetings organiser highly successfully for many years. In his place, a Mr Frederic Thomas appears to have been installed to oversee Management and Accounts; and by 1924, David Samways had been appointed as permanent General Secretary, remaining with the WLNU to his retirement and passing in 1944.\n\nBy 1925, the WLNU movement having doubled, “new premises were absolutely essential for health of the staff and efficiency of administration” (1925 Annual Report). It was decided to purchase a building with a £2,000 Bank Loan, to be repaid over several years. In the event, the acquisition of 10 Richmond Terrace on Park Place in Cathays (right) was effected in 1926 by a loan from the Davies Sisters of Gregynog, Gwendoline and Margaret. In 1932, they converted their loan into a gift to the WLNU, in recognition both of the financial challenge of the Great Depression, and of their quiet, behind the scenes support for the League’s work. It is notable that whilst David Davies famously and publicly gifted the WLNU’s future headquarters, it was his sisters who paid for the WLNU’s headquarters for 75% of the organisation’s existence – for which Gwendoline and Margaret Davies have historically not been fully credited, their contribution to the arts perhaps fitting gender portrayals more traditionally.\n\nRegional Organisers\n\nThe Women’s Peace Appeal of 1923, along with the challenge of supporting many hundreds of community and schools groups, and setting up new ones, led to the creation of District Committees from 1923 (see P16), and from 1926 the appointment of two Regional Organiser staff roles for North and South Wales. These were filled by Sara Pugh Jones for North Wales – based from Llangollen – and Mr D Hughes Lewis for South Wales, based from Maesteg. There remain considerable administrative records and materials from their community works and travels supporting WLNU groups around Wales, in the National Library of Wales WLNU Archives.\n\nThe WLNU’s expanded staff and volunteers worked from 10 Museum Place from 1926 to 1939, at which point that building was sold – the proceeds offsetting the WLNU’s debts – as staff transferred to Wales’ new Temple of Peace & Health, opened on 23 November 1938. However, just 9 months later with the outbreak of WW2, the Temple was ‘mothballed’, and the WLNU’s work pared back to a skeleton staff so that most could be made available to enlist for war service. In practice, WLNU staff were seconded to some hugely significant roles in building the architecture for post-WW2 institutions of peace and cooperation: Rev Gwilym Davies and the while WEAC committee of educationalists were commissioned to consult upon and draft a constitution for a new International Education Organisation, leading to the creation of UNESCO from 1946. And several Secretarial staff were seconded to organise the first UN General Assembly of the United Nations in London, in 1945.\n\nDistrict Committees\n\nTo bridge the gulf between the many hundreds of local WLNU branches, and the very small staff / organiser support from headquarters, from 1923 Hon Director Gwilym Davies proposed establishing ‘District Committees’: bringing together representatives of multiple local branches to coordinate campaigning activities, share organisational workload, and represent the WLNU to counties and constituencies. The 1927 Annual Report excerpt overleaf illustrates well the proportions between district committees, community and junior branches, and memberships.\n\nCase Study – Cardiganshire District WLNU\n\nIn 1926 Cardiganshire’s 7 District Committees supported 28 adult and 2 junior branches:\n\nAberystwyth DC –Aberystwyth Town, Alfred Place, English Wesleyan Church, Salem Chapel, Shiloh Chapel, St Paul’s, Tabernacl, University College, Capel Bangor, Dyffryn & Goginan, Llanafan & Crosswood, Penllwyn, Ponterwyd, Junior: Ponterwyd School, Aberystwyth County School.\n\nAberaeron DC – Newquay\n\nCardigan DC – Cardigan Town, Bancyfelin & Llangranog,\n\nLampeter DC – Lampeter Town, Esgairlas, Silian (Bethel Chapel)\n\nLlandyssul DC – Cross Inn & Llandyssul\n\nTregaron DC – Blaenafon & Blaenpennal, Llanddewi Brefi, Llangeitho, Pontrhydfendigaid, Tregaron Town, Soar-y-Mynydd Chapel, Swyddfynnon & Ystrad Meurig, Ysbytty Ystwyth\n\nHenllan DC – 0\n\nIt is notable that 3 of these district committees – Aberaeron, Llandyssul and Henllan – have 1 (or less) local branches in their immediate area. It is possible these districts had been set up either to establish new local groups, or to accommodate ‘branch-less’ members in those communities. Many branches at this point appear attached to institutions such as chapels, schools and colleges, an approach which may have disadvantaged rural communities lacking ‘bricks and mortar’ premises – or possibly with pastors less willing to lend rural chapels to a political cause. Casting forward to the report for 1929-1930, Cardiganshire appears to have grown at least 16 additional local branches of the WLNU, having organised successful Daffodil Days in…\n\nAberporth, Borth, Bronant, Llanilar, Bow Street, Derry Ormond, Devil’s Bridge, Felinfach, Glynarthen, Llanon, Llanrhystyd, Llechryd, Mydroilyn, Pontshaen, Rhydlewis, and Talgarreg. …as well as well-established districts. WLNU Reports of the 1930s highlight ‘Specimen Activities’ for particularly active branches and districts, which for Cardiganshire were Aberystwyth, Tregaron and Llangeitho – incidentally, the birthplace of WLNU President Annie Hughes-Griffiths.\n\nBranches Wales-wide\n\nThe WLNU was one of Wales’ largest membership organisations not just in the interwar era, but to the present day – peaking at 61,262, across over 1,000 communities – adult groups peaking at 794, and junior groups at 302. There has been some ambiguity as to whether junior groups were connected to ‘Aelwyd’s’ (local groups) of the Urdd movement, which Gwilym Davies was also involved with founding in the early 1920s; however, analysis of WLNU reports throughout the era suggests almost all ‘junior groups’ were within primary and secondary schools.\n\nTo illustrate the geographic distribution of WLNU’s membership and its campaigning reach, the adjoining map superimposes membership figures from the 1925-1926 Annual Report, plotted over the historic counties of Wales.\n\nMembership Levels over Time\n\nThe figures in the following table illustrate how these WLNU’s membership figures (and types) fluctuated through the interwar era. Whilst impressive participation from any angle, they reflect some changes, as well as the changing world environment in which WLNU was operating:\n\nIn 1930, the ‘apparent dip’ in membership was actually a change in presentation; due to falling income, the WNC decided to measure paid memberships rather than signups. Note that the highest number of active local branches is also 1929-1930 – suggesting activity remained high.\n\nAs the Great Depression of 1930-31 took effect, a decrease in paid memberships reflected the unemployment and austerity situation, as well as concerns about the League of Nations following the Manchuria Crisis.\n\nFurther reorganisation in 1934, and presentational variations, create gaps in figures.\n\nThe highest paid members was marked in 1937, as Wales’ Temple of Peace was under construction – and as concerns escalated towards WW2.\n\nWith the outbreak of WW2, the Welsh League partially suspended work. Although some figures are given, may not represent similar measures of activity.\n\nMembership Activities\n\nAnnual ‘Plan of Campaign’ for Branches\n\nGwilym Davies’ ‘plan of campaign’ first prepared in 1922, following his appointment as Honorary Director, included a proposed scheme of activity for local branches designed to suggest a self-sustaining programme of activities: connecting them to the wider world, and encouraging critical thinking on big issues of the era, and keeping abreast of current affairs issues and challenges facing internationalism.\n\nCommunity Events\n\nFrom the early 1920s, the WLNU started encouraging branches (and producing central support materials that enabled local members) to organise branch meetings, socials, public meetings, study circles / speakers training, fundraising concerts, church collections, Sunday schools, Armistice Week events, and Youth Rallies / Festivals.\n\nA particular activity prominent in archive references from the 1930s is ‘lantern lectures’, slide shows on current affairs / League topics or campaigning issues, that were passed between local branches accompanied by prepared scripts for local presenters to read. These were organised both for ‘propaganda purposes’ and as entertainment / learning / public events.\n\nFundraising – Daffodil Days\n\nBy 1924, the sale of daffodils throughout the summer to raise money for the work of the WLNU had become a thriving tradition. Daffodil Days would frequently continue to occur until late September (despite the efforts of the executive committee to set a uniform national date in mid-May – tying in to the ‘Peace Day’ for the newly established Welsh Youth Message of Peace & Goodwill), and the event quickly cemented itself as an integral part of interwar Welsh culture.\n\nIn 1924 twenty six Welsh towns held a Daffodil Day in aid of the Welsh League of Nations Union, yet this number had multiplied almost tenfold by 1927, with 249 Daffodil Days. In just a few years, Daffodil Days had not only ‘blossomed’ into a recognised cultural event, but quickly become vital to financing the Welsh League of Nations Union, contributing over half the Council’s income for most of the interwar period. In 1927 alone, £1,877 16s 11d worth of daffodils were bought by the people of Wales in aid of the Union around 450,000 cardboard daffodils. Particularly impressive given that the population of Wales was recorded to be 2,656,000 in the 1921 Census.\n\nCampaigns\n\nAnnual campaigns on specific issues were additional to the general activity of local branches, and often directed by campaign committees often at a district level, who liaised both with local WLNU branches, but also with other partners, influencers and organisations relevant to their area. Typically, these appear to have adopted a pyramidal structure whereby the WLNU Office and Regional Organisers, liaised with Districts, who coordinated branches, who conducted the door to door campaigning activity. The Welsh Women’s Peace Petition of 1923, for example, listed 17 county committees consisting of several hundred district organisers.\n\nThe 1935 Peace Ballot (below) took a similar approach, with ballot returns by county – and hefty encouragement of competition between counties to have the highest returns.\n\nCurrent Affairs and Policy Debates\n\nLocal WLNU branches and district committees, as well as organising regular community events on global issues of most current interest, were also very pro-active in shaping the policy stance of the WLNU itself – on a hugely diverse array of issues. The 1936 Annual Report (below) for example outlines policy developments on Arms Trafficking, China, ILO membership for USA and Russia, Treaty of Versailles, Italian invasion of Abyssinia (Ethiopia), primacy of the league of settlement of disputes between states, colonial raw materials.\n\nAlthough the WLNU was largely bankrolled by David Davies, members did not necessarily follow his bidding. It took from 1922 until 1935 for him to persuade peace activists to support the adoption of international policing (now more familiar as UN peacekeeping forces); and this stance permanently rifted the movement between pacifism and pacificism.\n\nThe Cardiganshire Peace Pageant of 1935, in the grounds of Aberystwyth Castle, attracted many thousands to watch children from every school across Cardiganshire perform in national costumes of most nations of the world.\n\nYouth Festivals and Educational Activities\n\nDuring the early 1920s, much of the WLNU’s youth activity centred around encouraging participation in the ‘World Wireless Message’ of Peace and Goodwill. As the work of the WEAC (Welsh Education Advisory Committee) also progressed and bore fruit in Welsh schools developing active curricula on global learning, the WLNU increasingly encouraged schools and junior branches of the WLNU to organise creative activities such as plays and pageants, and ‘Youth Festivals’. Many 1930s WLNU Annual Conferences were followed by a Youth Festival, where young people showcased their global knowledge, skills and ideas to inspire the WLNU’s amassed campaigners and organisers.\n\nInternational Advocacy\n\nWhilst the Welsh League’s activities and those of its members were primarily focused on shaping public opinion in Wales on world issues, the WLNU were also very pro-active in influencing on global issues through UK parliamentarians, the League of Nations itself, and through Welsh diaspora in America and elsewhere.\n\nThe League was a heavily Euro-centric organisation, in comparison to the post-war United Nations, with headquarters and key operational offices in Geneva, Brussels and other European capitals.\n\nWinifred Coombe Tennant was the UK’s first female delegate to any international body, as British representative to the League of Nations Congress of September 1922.\n\nAnnie Hughes Griffiths and others involved with the Welsh Women’s Peace Appeal and Women’s Advisory Committee were particularly pro-active in relationships with women’s organisations in America, most especially the ‘Conference on the Cause and Cure of War’ formed out of Wales’ 1924 ‘peace tour’ – which brought together 9 US women’s networks with millions of members.\n\nDavid Davies was elected ‘Controller’ of the International Federation of League of Nations Societies (IFNLS) which coordinated advocacy and campaigning between League-supporting bodies across the globe. Davies also regularly travelled to and liaised with America Peace societies, and had a home in Edmonton, Canada where he also made connections with Canadian civil society and parliamentarians. He was impulsive in mixing and influencing among European society contacts, and famously flew to Germany on the eve of WW2 in a last-ditch effort to avert war through appealing to some of Hitlers allies – who turned out to have already been ‘removed’.\n\nGwilym Davies through the 1930s acted as the WLNU’s Honorary International Secretary as an observer and advisor at the Palais des Nations in Geneva. Along with other members of the WEAC Education Advisory Committee, he was seconded by the Allied Governments during WW2 to draft a constitution for a new International Education Organisation, which laid the foundations for UNESCO’s launch in 1946.\n\nFrom 1928, the WLNU launched the ‘Geneva Scholarship Scheme’ which funded young scholars and leading Welsh peace activists to spend a summer at the League’s HQ in Switzerland, witnessing operations, feeding in to decision making, and sharing experiences on return. Most schools in Wales would take part in the coveted ‘Geneva Essay Competition’ on current issues, to win these coveted places which opened lifechanging opportunities.\n\nThe diagram below illustrates the extent of the League’s bodies / spheres of operation in 1930s.\n\nConferences and Public Events\n\nDemocracy and participation within the Welsh League of Nations Union were held together by a regular annual programme of conferences and events, including high profile public presence with pavilions at each year’s National Eisteddfod, Agricultural Show (now the Royal Welsh), and other key events.\n\nReferences: List of National Eisteddfod venues 1861-2024; (Royal) Welsh Agricultural Shows 1904-1962\n\nWLNU Campaigns Timeline\n\nLegacy of ‘the League’ in Wales\n\nThe peace campaigns of the Welsh League of Nations Union were ahead of their time by a generation. Often discounted – then and since – as idealistic and politically impractical, many of the measures the WLNU and its members called for during the interwar era – ironically, to avoid outbreak of a second world war – ended up being integrated into the post-WW2 global architecture with creation of the United Nations and its many bodies, with a less Eurocentric, more universalist world view – and with America playing a lead role.\n\nExpansion of the post-war state absorbed many functions previously the domain of Civil Society organisations and peace campaigners, into diplomatic services and functions such as the Foreign / Commonwealth Offices. Many Welsh interwar figures went on work in UN agencies, shaping the development of UNESCO, UN Peacekeeping, the UN Development Programme, World Food Programme, and many more. Campaigns such as the Youth Message of Peace & Goodwill have continued to this day, celebrating through the Urdd its centenary in 2022 – although with its WLNU origins largely forgotten today. Others, such as the Women’s Peace Appeal to America, have been relatively recently ‘re-discovered’ to inspire a new generation of women peacemakers.\n\nThe WLNU, its branches and members, and the debates they coordinated over 20-25 years were woven into the interwar fabric of practically every community across Wales, into the very psyche of Welsh society. Although the WLNU might not be an organisation that trips off the tongue – or indeed that most people have heard of – there can be little doubting the collective impact their organisational dedication had on shaping the identity of Wales and Welsh people to be a progressive, globally responsible, outward looking nation. This legacy is perhaps best reflected today in the pro-active approach of Welsh Civil Society and the National Assembly for Wales, towards a positive Welsh Internationalism: working ‘in league’ towards ‘social justice’."
