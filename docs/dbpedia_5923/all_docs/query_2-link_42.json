        "text": "Thank you for noting that the Prime Minister, just a few days into office, has come physically to Wales. That is a really positive statement. I didn't have the opportunity to meet the previous Prime Minister in Wales. I did see him briefly in Normandy. When people have been asked, of course, what they wanted at that election, I'm delighted the people of Wales chose to implement a blanket ban on Welsh Tory MPs, and we then have an opportunity to deliver on the manifesto on which 27 out of 32 Welsh MPs were elected. And Tata is a significant part of that. We are dealing, though, with a legacy of the previous deal offered by the Conservative Government, that Kemi Badenoch celebrated as being good news—that's essentially the plan that Tata are working too—with eye-watering job losses within it, and we are very much at the very end of the line on this.\n\nAnd I do have to reflect yet again that, several years ago, when I was first appointed as the economy Minister at the time, Kwasi Kwarteng, as the business Secretary, attended a steel council in Cardiff, and there was a deal to be done that would have delivered significant co-investment and a different and a better future for steel at the time. It was the occupants of 10 and 11 Downing Street at the time who wouldn't sign up to that, and it's no surprise that Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak have left us in no better a position now. We are, though, engaged in good-faith negotiations with the company. That is engagement from the Welsh Government, me and the economy Secretary, engaging directly with Jonathan Reynolds, as the new Secretary of State for Business and Trade, and conversations with the UK and the Mumbai leadership. Those negotiations are on the back of a manifesto that can now be delivered. The £0.5 billion that has not been spent, the £2.5 billion that is available to transform steel across the UK and those negotiations have a limited window over a period of weeks to succeed. We can't undertake those negotiations in public, and I don't think steelworkers or steel communities would expect that. What they do expect is that both Governments, here in Wales and across the UK, will fight for a better deal for steel and for steelworkers, and that is exactly what we are doing.\n\nI'm afraid that the second question just feeds into a real level of cynicism that people feel around politics. The phrase that the Member used, 'oven ready', was used by the Conservatives in 2019 about the Brexit deal, and we saw what happened there. I have never said that, Jeremy Miles has never said that, the Prime Minister has never said that, Jonny Reynolds never said that. What we have said is what we have consistently said: there is a different level of investment available from the now, current, UK Labour Government. There is a different level of ambition for the future of steel that is available with this UK Labour Government, with a significant mandate and an economic plan that will require more steel in our future, not less. Trying to claim that we had used a phrase that has never been used is—you could almost say that it's act of deliberate deception.\n\nI think, when we get to the serious businesses of negotiations with the company, which is what I set out in my first answer, that is exactly what is taking place. We won't be bounced into the sort of language and the lack of fidelity to the facts that the Member seeks to urge on us. And, on this issue, the Conservatives need to recognise that they are completely without credibility. To now say that the clock is ticking and we're nearly at the end, when actually there have been years when a deal could and should have been done—a better deal was available to be done several years ago. That is the reality of this. You really do remind me of an arsonist with his matches angrily shouting at the fire brigade. We are now in the position of trying to rescue the damage and the dereliction from your 14 years across the UK. I will not take a single breath of lecturing from you or any other Conservative on our ambition and our commitment to the future of steel.\n\nWell, I congratulate every new Member of Parliament who has been elected to represent Wales in Westminster. I'm sure they will all do their best for the communities that have chosen to elect them. I won't name all 27 of our Welsh Labour MPs or the 11 new names that are representing constituencies in Wales, but I believe they will be fantastic champions for every part of the country that they represent, and I wish them all well. Because part of our challenge, honestly, is how we remake the case for politics as a positive endeavour to serve the country. There are people across this Chamber who are decent people who simply disagree; far too much of political discourse in the last few years has been to demonise and deny that to people we don't agree with. And I hope that we can do better than that, and that comes from the top, both here and indeed across the UK Government.\n\nWhen it comes to the position of the new UK Labour Government, I had a very warm and positive meeting with the Prime Minister. I don't buy into the campaign of grievance and disappointment within the first week that the leader of Plaid Cymru is so keen to force upon us. That isn't the view of the people of Wales, either, in the way that they voted. I am keen that we deliver on the manifesto we put before the people of Wales—that will take devolution forward, and it will see real progress across our economy and support for public services on a whole range of areas where a mission for the UK can only be delivered if Wales plays its full part. So, I look forward to not just fairness in funding, but, actually, a much better future for all of us here in Wales, and I believe the election of a UK Labour Government really will deliver the change that Wales and Britain need. I look forward to working with the Prime Minister and a new team of Labour Ministers across the UK to do just that.\n\nI think there are three broad points to mention. The first is that the Welsh Labour manifesto does pursue Welsh interests, and it's a manifesto upon which 27 of our nation's 32 UK MPs have been returned. It's a manifesto that will see a greater say for Wales on the future of Wales. It's a manifesto that, I believe, can lead to much greater investment in our infrastructure, including across transport. If you just think about north Wales, where the claim that there was a £1 billion investment was simply not true—it was made by a party at the end of its time in Government—we are looking for a plan to deliver real investment in our transport infrastructure. The appointment of Lord Hendy as the rail Minister is a good example of someone we can work with who does understand the need for further investment here in Wales. I'm confident that our team of Ministers here, and the 27 Welsh Labour champions who have gone to Westminster, will make the case and deliver real investment in our rail infrastructure and much more.\n\nIt's also worth pointing out that the national wealth fund is another example of where I expect Wales to benefit, and to benefit disproportionately. If you consider again the ports investment that took place under the last Government, with £160 million for the whole of the UK, Pembroke Dock and Milford Haven were excluded from that. We are now going to see a quadrupling of that in the national wealth fund, together with the ability to lever in more private investment. All of those things matter in dealing with our climate and nature emergencies, but, more than that, the race for clean power can only be achieved if we deliver a significant chunk of that here from Wales and the jobs that should come from Wales as well. That's why I look for immediate action around the Crown Estate—it's to make sure that we can have a much better offer when it comes to the supply chain. The real value being delivered is that supply chain, with a longer term list of jobs in communities that will see power generated. I want to see opportunities so that people can, then, plan a genuinely ambitious future here in Wales. That is what we are working towards, that is this Government standing up for the interests of Wales, and having a willing and positive partner to do so, and that is what I believe people voted for last week.\n\nWell, again, the leader of Plaid Cymru is seeking to put words into my mouth that I've never used, and to try to reach a judgment that is certainly not the judgment of this Government. I do agree, though, that our staff are under tremendous pressure, and, without the extraordinary commitment and expertise of our staff in primary care and in hospital-based care, we would not be able to deliver our service. It's a fact that most people have a good outcome and have timely care in their own experience. Our challenge is far too many people do wait too long, and far too many people don't have the experience that we would want them to. We know there's been a huge backlog created after the pandemic with the extraordinary measures that we had to take. Recovery in our healthcare seems to be taking even longer than we thought it would do. We're still not yet at the same level of efficiency on a range of procedures in the service—that has an impact. We've diverted £1 billion into addressing the backlog, with long-term waits coming down, but we know there's more to do. That has meant we haven't been able to invest in, if you like, the front door, the primary and the community care part of our system, which we know will deliver, longer term, better outcomes, and reduce need within our system. We also have huge public health challenges that are society wide. The health service deals with the sharper end of that, but there's actually a whole range of measures that we need to take successfully to try to get on top of those.\n\nI have never and will never be complacent about the challenges and the extraordinary pressure that our healthcare system is under. To get on top of that, to see the improvement that we know that we need to, that we want to, will not just take slogans in this place, it will take real hard work. It will take reform and resources. It will take modernisation. We've been modernising our service in a range of areas. And, actually, Wes Streeting is looking at delivering a range of the improvements in delivery of healthcare that we have delivered here in Wales. We have a much better offer on pharmacy in Wales than in England. He's looking to do more of that. We've changed the way that dentistry contracts—with more new patient episodes. I'm very proud of the work we've done in optometry. Interestingly, when I was seeing people in Ireland, they were very interested in what we had done in moving more services with greater access to front-line optometry. So, we have a number of things we should be proud of, as well as recognising the significant number of challenges we do have.\n\nAnd on Tata, I refer him to the answer I've given to the leader of the opposition: we are in a negotiation—a negotiation with a limited window. You'll have heard the leader of Community—the largest steel union at Port Talbot, the largest steel union in the UK—indicating in his view a window of four to six weeks, to understand if a better deal can be done, if we can persuade Tata to change course, to invest in the future and give us a different period of transition. That is only possible because there are now two Governments on the pitch, fighting for steel and steelworkers, because there is a different level of co-investment, and a different level of ambition for the future of steel. And I believe that steelworkers and their communities understand that, and know that we are doing everything we could and should do for them, and, indeed, what it means for our economic future as well.\n\nWell, I think people who went to the polls understood that their votes really did matter. They made a decisive shift, both away from the Conservatives and in understanding that it's the Labour Party in every nation of the UK that represented that change. That's why we now have a majority of Members of Parliament in England, Scotland and Wales for the first time in more than 20 years, and I wouldn't describe having more than 400 Labour MPs in the UK Parliament as a poor result. I think it's a really positive result with a mandate that gives us the room to act across the UK, and Wales will benefit from that, but also the responsibility to do so as well, to deliver on the manifesto we have. And, actually, sticking to the pledges we have made in office will make a difference, understanding that the deliberate division of the culture wars that have been started in the last few years is something we have to put behind us. If we think that our main parties will benefit from going towards extremes of view or demanding that everyone accepts that their opponents are somehow extremists when they are plainly not, I think that will actually drive more and more people away from politics. The anti-politics vote for people who voted for an alternative party, the anti-politics apathy that exists with the fall in voter turnout, I think they speak to how our debates are conducted and the cynicism that I believe exists in far too many communities.\n\nI look forward to having a genuine partnership with the UK Government. I look forward to meeting the honest challenge on many doorsteps about the length of time it will take to put right the last 14 years, showing that who you vote for matters, and that we are basically decent people who disagree with each other about how to improve the country. I acknowledge that there are decent people in the Conservative Party; I disagree with you about the future for the country. I think that honest engagement will be good for all of us, and I look forward to delivering on our mandate here in Wales and, indeed, that wider mandate right across the United Kingdom.\n\nI think the Member makes an important point about the real crisis we see across prisons. It's frightening to have seen what the inspectorate has recently said about the conditions in prisons: the overcrowding, the crumbling conditions as well—a wholly inappropriate environment—and also how full our prisons are getting as well. We're at the point where the UK Government may be forced to build new prisons, not because it wants to put more people in jail, but because it simply can't deal with the people that it's got, and the estate is in such a poor state that we're going to need to close prisons as well. Now, that's another part of the legacy that the UK Government inherits.\n\nI agree with you, the appointment of James Timpson is a proper signal of wanting to understand how you bring people in with expertise who can deliver practical progress. There's, if you like, an ideological perspective that many of us will take about what the right sort of answer should be, but it's intensely practical as well. If you look at what the Timpson business has done, and others, they provide a route for people to leave prison and to have a stable life in wider society. Now, that is in all of our interests. It's in all of our interests as taxpayers, as people who may be connected to people within the prison estate now, but also for communities where people return as well. So, this isn't just about the punishment element of putting people in prison; it is about prevention and rehabilitation and needing to get that right, so people aren't simply on a merry-go-round of going in and out of the criminal justice system.\n\nAnd it underpins the conversation we need to have about the future of probation services. Not everyone will have read the UK Labour manifesto, but it talks about what is already taking place in greater Manchester, where they're able to link devolved services, including housing and others, and they've managed to link that into probation, and it delivers better outcomes. This isn't simply a case of redesigning a map of where we want powers to lie; it's actually where and how you can deliver better services with better outcomes for the people engaged and involved, as well as the taxpayer. And I believe that is not just a discussion that we will have, with Lesley Griffiths being our lead Minister in this Government, but I believe it's a destination point for the UK and Wales, to have a different form of organisation to deliver much better outcomes that each of us can be proud of.\n\nI've already chosen to govern in service of the people of Wales, and I'm very proud to do so. And I'll carry on undertaking that role with partners in the UK Government. And, actually, in the conversation with Keir Starmer, of course I discussed the future of fairness around Barnett, of course I discussed the investment opportunities in rail infrastructure and the need to deliver something that will actually meet the needs of our country. I'm looking for a plan that can actually deliver, and I go back to the example of north Wales, as the £1 billion pledge that was claimed was never a plan; there were never real opportunities to do that. What I want is a proper plan that will actually see not just agreement on priorities—some of that work has already been done—and to understand how we have a plan that will see investment that will make a real difference. I think that's the space where the public want us to be as well, and rather than—.\n\nI understand the narrative that the leader of Plaid Cymru wants to have, but if you listened to what the Prime Minister said in his first press conference, he made very clear that there is too much power in Westminster, and it needs to go to people who have skin in the game: local decision makers in regions of England; national decision makers here in Wales and, indeed, in Scotland. The Prime Minister didn't simply do a tour to visit Labour colleagues; he showed the respect that the UK deserves and that has been lacking for the last decade and more, by physically coming to meet the leaders of the nations of the UK and making clear that there really will be a change in the way that the UK is governed and in the choices that we will make, and that will lead to the delivery of the manifesto that 27 out of 32 Welsh MPs have been elected on. Of course, I respect the right of those who have different manifesto pledges to make their case.\n\nI’m delighted to see the return of services to Llandegla, which the Member has highlighted, but also to confirm again that the pre-election pledge by the Conservatives on north Wales electrification was never a real plan. It was not an honest statement to make to the public. Network Rail, as the Member knows, have confirmed that, despite the promise, no formal development work was undertaken. They were not given a remit and no formal work has been undertaken with them since 2013.\n\nWhen it comes to what we could do in the future, delivering our manifesto pledge to restore decision making over former EU funds is one of the big opportunities that we have. To go through that, we will need to work with partners to understand what those priorities will be and work with what we’ve been able to do already. I’m very pleased the Member has highlighted the bus grant that has kept services in play that could otherwise have fallen away. We’ll probably talk more about buses in the statement later on this afternoon. But that does mean we have opportunities to look again at the regional investment framework that was co-produced with a range of partners before the last election, to update that and to make sure that we have a clear understanding of what we can do with that, in addition to other areas of future devolution.\n\nI’m very excited on the skills front about what we can do in restoring money into apprenticeships and in the devolution of employment support funding. There are big opportunities to make a real difference in every community. What we’ll have to do, though, is decide what are our strategic priorities and how we choose to use those. That is quite properly in the remit of this Government, to be held accountable by the Senedd, and to do that work with our partners is what I intend for us to do.\n\nI may not have been in a position to respond to them all, but they meant a lot and they made a difference. This is not a statement that is easy for me to make, nor one that I take lightly. Indeed, there have been times in the not too recent past when I was not sure I would or could stand and speak in this Siambr again. I do so today because I know my removal from Government has been a focus of discussion in this place while I have not been here. I also feel a sense of responsibility to those closest to me and to my many constituents who have demonstrated great patience, understanding and confidence in me.\n\nLlywydd, I will start by just briefly addressing the circumstances around my leaving Government. I know that I can look all my colleagues who sit on these benches in the eye and say that I have never leaked or briefed the media about any of you. In fact, I can say that to everyone in the Siambr. Whilst I will not share the detail, I will share that I have formally raised concerns about the process by which I was removed from Government, including not being shown any alleged evidence before being sacked, not being made aware that I was ever under investigation and that at no point was I advised or was it evidenced that I may have broken the ministerial code. I absolutely recognise and respect that it is within the gift of any First Minister to appoint and remove members of their Government. I understand the nature of politics and completely accept that. I raise concerns not out of self-interest, but because I fundamentally believe in devolution and public service. I have also very real concerns that lessons have not been learned from the past. Proper process not only needs to be in place and followed for the dignity and respect of individuals involved, but also to uphold the integrity of the civil service and the office of the First Minister.\n\nI want to take a moment to reflect on something that is very personal and somewhat difficult for me, but I feel it's important to say for the sake of how we do politics. I know that there's been speculation about my circumstances and about whether I have been well enough to work. This has ranged from what was tantamount to misinformation and what could be put down to misunderstanding. It should not be surprising that what happened has been hugely detrimental to me on a personal level, and led to acute anxiety and stress. I have never been signed off work before when I have struggled with this in itself, but there was a point when the thought of just putting my camera on to vote and seeing you all literally took my breath away. I share this now not in search of sympathy—I don't want people's sympathy—but because my recent experience has brought home to me that whilst we all talk the talk on mental health, there is still more to do to improve our understanding and the impact that it has on individuals and their ability to do things we would ordinarily take for granted. Sadly, I think, sometimes, we get so caught up in the politics that we don't always think about the person.\n\nI recently listened to a podcast called Broken Politicians, Broken Politics. I am not broken, but I know now more than I did before that I am breakable, as, actually, we all are, and I don't believe politics is broken, but it certainly could be better. We've talked often in this place of a kinder politics, but we can't have a kinder politics without kinder people, and we won't get better politics without being better people. Our own conduct and character is key to the public having trust in those who serve them and believing that politics can be a force for good.\n\nLlywydd, it has been a privilege to serve in my country's Government, particularly under the leadership of Mark Drakeford. The trade union movement not only shaped my values, it helped give me my voice, and I am proud to have taken through the most progressive trade union legislation in the devolution era. And a younger me, who struggled with her sexuality, would never, ever have believed that, one day, I would spearhead the plan to make Wales the most LGBTQ+ friendly nation in Europe.\n\nI am truly grateful for that opportunity and it will always, always be an absolute privilege to serve the community that shaped me as a Member of the Senedd. I'm only who I am and where I am because of where I come from. And in spite of the challenges and the difficulties—perhaps because of them—I do feel a renewed sense of commitment to the politics of public service and a real determination to continue to contribute to our devolved democracy, my community and our country. Diolch. [Applause.]\n\nDiolch, Llywydd. It is a pleasure to be able to set out today the legislative priorities for my Government. I have been clear that we must focus our resources on what matters most in people's daily lives. Both our record of delivery and our plans for the future reflect our commitment to radical, progressive and transformative change for every corner of Wales.\n\nOur legislative achievements over the last 12 months reflect this commitment as we have passed laws crucial for the long-term future of Wales. The Environment (Air Quality and Soundscapes) (Wales) Act, which received Royal Assent earlier this year, shows our commitment to improve the air that we breathe and to promote healthy soundscapes. As we move towards net-zero emissions by 2050, we need to transform our economy to power green prosperity. The Infrastructure (Wales) Act, passed in April, will play a key role in delivering our renewable energy targets and will simplify the consenting process for major infrastructure projects.\n\nWe are committed to ensuring effective, high-quality and sustainable health and social care to deliver better outcomes. In May, we introduced the Health and Social Care (Wales) Bill, which will eliminate private profit from the care of looked-after children as part of our programme to transform children’s services. The Health Service Procurement (Wales) Act, which received Royal Assent this year, will enhance efficiency and patient-centred healthcare. Together with regulations later this year, this will deliver a new regime for the procurement of NHS services to meet the needs of the sector and the people it serves. These are an example of the significant subordinate legislation that underpins our legislative programme, including regulations to implement Acts of the Senedd, such as the Environmental Protection (Single-use Plastic Products) (Wales) Act 2023.\n\nLlywydd, the Bills we brought forward in the third year of the legislative programme will also make positive changes for democracy in Wales. The Senedd Cymru (Members and Elections) (Wales) Act, which received Royal Assent last month, will create a modern Senedd, better able to represent and serve the people of Wales. Further measures to reform the Senedd will be considered when we debate the general principles of the Senedd Cymru (Electoral Candidate Lists) Bill next week. We share an ambition across the Senedd to introduce a recall mechanism for Senedd Members and my Government stands ready to support that work. We have also committed to enable legislation for the Senedd to consider on the issue of deception by Members of the Senedd and candidates standing for election to the Senedd. We look forward to the recommendations of the Standards of Conduct Committee on both of these issues as part of its work on the accountability of individual Members.\n\nLater this afternoon, we will consider Stage 4 of the Elections and Elected Bodies (Wales) Bill, which will develop an electoral system fit for the twenty-first century. Members will also consider amendments to the Local Government Finance (Wales) Bill at Stage 3 later today. The Bill forms part of our work to reform non-domestic rates and council tax. The final Bill of our year three programme, the Welsh language and education Bill, will be introduced next week. Our aim is to help pupils in Wales to become independent and confident Welsh speakers.\n\nLlywydd, I now turn to those Bills that my Government will introduce in the rest of this Senedd term. We have a packed legislative agenda ahead as we continue to make laws that will deliver positive and progressive change. My Government is committed to improving transport networks, helping to tackle the climate emergency and restoring a sense of belonging, connection and community. We will radically reshape the public transport system, bringing forward a bus Bill to enable all levels of government in Wales to work together. We can then design bus networks that allow people to access reliable, sustainable services and to provide real options other than car journeys.\n\nLlywydd, alongside this, we are committed to modernising taxi and private hire vehicle licensing to create a safer and fairer sector. So, we will consult on a draft taxi and private hire vehicles Bill this Senedd term, and we will continue to work with passengers, the trade and licensing authorities to take forward reforms through non-legislative means. Members may wish to note a declaration of interest concerning the company Veezu, in addition to my membership of the Unite and GMB trade unions.\n\nWe will continue to demonstrate our commitment to tackling the increasing threat to the environment by bringing forward an environmental principles and biodiversity Bill. This will establish a statutory environmental governance body for Wales, embed environmental principles into Welsh law and introduce a legal duty with targets to protect and restore biodiversity. The Bill signals our clear commitment that action and leadership to tackle the climate and nature emergency will remain as a top priority for this Welsh Government.\n\nCoal tips are a legacy of Wales’s mining past. The disused tips (mines and quarries) Bill will give greater security to the people living in their shadow. It will protect critical infrastructure and safeguard the environment by enshrining in law a sustainable, fit-for-purpose regulatory regime for disused tip safety.\n\nLlywydd, I have been clear that we must focus our efforts on the issues that matter most to the people of Wales. Everyone should have somewhere to call home, and the safety of our residents is paramount. Our homelessness Bill will help people remain in their homes and focus on prevention and early intervention to significantly improve the homelessness and housing system. A suite of secondary legislation that brought in tighter building controls came into force in April. Our building safety Bill will extend this by establishing a new building safety regime. This will fundamentally reform the occupation and ongoing management of multi-occupied residential buildings and address fire safety issues.\n\nWe will introduce a Bill that will give local authorities powers to introduce a visitor levy. The money raised will support tourism, helping our communities and preserving the beauty of Wales for future generations. The visitor accommodation (regulation) Bill will enhance the visitor experience by ensuring visitor accommodation meets required standards. The Bill will establish a register of visitor accommodation and enable providers to demonstrate compliance with safety requirements.\n\nImproving the accessibility of our law is another important facet of our legislative programme. Our next legislation Bill will remove obsolete and spent provisions from the statute book and formalise the system of making and publishing Welsh statutory instruments. I know that Members are keen to see the consolidation of planning law, which has become increasingly inaccessible and overly complex for operators and users of the planning system. We will bring forward a Bill towards the end of this Senedd that will simplify and modernise the law in this area.\n\nThe Welsh Government will seek to work in partnership with the UK Government in respect of UK legislation, and we will update the Senedd following the King’s Speech later this month. There will also be a programme of subordinate legislation to implement UK Acts made in the previous parliamentary session. This includes the Leasehold and Freehold Reform Act 2024, which provided powers for Welsh Ministers to deliver reform in this area.\n\nLlywydd, I would like to thank Senedd Members and committees, as well as our social partners and stakeholders, for the role that they play in developing and scrutinising legislation. Our legislative programme will make a real difference to people's lives, it will help to improve transport links across the country, protect people and our communities, and help us to tackle the climate emergency. I commend this programme to Members. I look forward to continuing to work together on these priorities to build an ambitious future for a fairer, stronger and greener Wales.\n\nThank you, First Minister, for your statement this afternoon on the legislative programme. I say this on an annual basis: it always amazes me when we stand here to think back to the legislative competence Order days, where Members, if they wanted, or even if the Government wanted, to bring legislation through, would have to hurry up to Westminster and, obviously, present that as an initial case, and then, if they got approval for that, they could bring their Measure, as it was called in those days, before the legislative process began, and how that inhibited us here in the Welsh Parliament from bringing legislation that, I agree with the First Minister, should always seek to improve lives of the people of Wales and improve services. And it's with that thought in mind that I do point to the limited nature of the legislative programme that the Government have brought through to date. When you look, since 2021 in Scotland, for example, 43 Bills have been brought forward in Scotland; if you look at the UK Government's legislative programme in Westminster, which I appreciate is a far bigger legislature, about 165 Bills, and here, since 2021, we're talking 13 pieces of legislation—13 pieces of legislation. So, there is a lack of ambition, I would suggest, from the Welsh Government. I appreciate the health Minister is constantly wanting to barrack today. If she put so much effort into solving the waiting lists here in Wales, then there might be improvement there. What I would say to the First Minister is trying to understand exactly how this legislative statement will make those improvements to the people of Wales.\n\nYou talked about the health and social care Bill in the early part of your statement, which was introduced in May. Given the changing landscape, because of the change in Government in Westminster that is being brought forward in England, where many services are sought by authorities here in Wales, in particular when it comes to looked-after children, and Wes Streeting's commitment on making sure there is greater use of the independent sector in providing those services, how compatible will the legislation here in Wales be with the policy initiative of making sure that it is actually the best outcome for the individual, rather than the legislative constraint, that actually delivers for that person? Because there is now a wide gap opening up with the policy intentions of your colleague Wes Streeting and what he wants to use the independent sector for in health and social care, and, obviously, what you as a Government are promoting in this legislation. And if you live in mid Wales, for example, a huge amount of the provision that you would access would be across Offa's Dyke, rather than, obviously, within the area of Powys, for example. So, if the First Minister could explain that, I'd be grateful.\n\nOn the building safety law that he touched on, could he confirm today whether that building safety law will use, as one of the bases of its legislative compacity, sections 116 and 124, because many campaigners that have pointed to that particular piece of legislation in England have highlighted how important that is in enabling them to seek restoration and empowerment when it comes to challenging developers over deficiencies within their buildings in England, but, sadly, the Government to date here in Wales hasn't brought forward similar provisions in any legislation? So, I see what he says in the statement about it helping on fire safety prevention. Could he confirm today whether the Welsh Government have looked at that and will include it in the legislation?\n\nOn the planning law in particular and the infrastructure Act—again, another big policy area and changing landscape in England, as we saw from the Chancellor yesterday—. I get devolved politics; obviously, the Government here has the right to have its own policy and its own legislation, but, when investors are looking to put money into projects, they clearly are looking for the quickest route to market and the most enabling framework that is available for them to make that choice. And so Wales can remain competitive, is he confident that the infrastructure Act that was passed last year, I believe, and the planning Act that he's talking about being implemented before the next Senedd election, will be the most competitive environment that can be possible whilst protecting communities against overdevelopment and, ultimately, safeguarding what we care passionately about, which is the great landscape and countryside of Wales, which is very often endangered by developments that aren’t suitable for those particular areas.\n\nCould the First Minister touch on where he sees the benefits of the disused tips Act that he's talking about—this piece of legislation? As someone whose own area, South Wales Central, covers a lot of these areas, it talks in the statement today of, obviously, covering infrastructure and protecting infrastructure and communities. Could the First Minister indicate how this piece of legislation will actually do that and what it will deliver for communities, especially in the old coalfield areas? Because, obviously, there is a severe danger in some of those communities unless those tips are, not just protected by legislation, but also enabling legislation for communities and local authorities to draw down assets to protect those communities.\n\nThe environmental principles and biodiversity Bill—\n\nThank you for the series of questions. I don't accept his criticism about the lack of ambition in the legislative programme. To date we've had a busy programme, as people who serve on scrutiny committees will recognise, and the Ministers piloting legislation through. We will of course, in the future, have a Senedd with an increased capacity to scrutinise legislation. What we also need to reflect on is how we deliver a fit-for-purpose piece of legislation that can really make a difference.\n\nI think there's often a desire in scrutiny to add more things into the Bills that are presented. It takes place in every Parliament, to be fair, regardless of its political make-up, but having a giant blockbuster Bill often makes the process less certain and less targeted at delivering the real improvements we need to make. So, I'm interested in laws that can and will make a difference to outcomes for people as well.\n\nI'd have to say that I think, in his comments about Wes Streeting, he’s searching for division where it simply does not exist. We are interested in how we improve outcomes across health and social care. And the Bill that we have introduced to eliminate profit in children's residential care services is not just something where I was proud to re-sign the declaration on behalf of the Welsh Government with care-experienced children and young people, it is about how we deliver better outcomes. At the moment, we have a system that is going to get more and more expensive without intervention, and actually we want to deliver a system with better outcomes within it. Better outcomes for the taxpayer, but, crucially, better outcomes for the children and young people who experience care during their lifetimes. And I hope that will also lead to a change in the tenor of debate around the measures that we seek to take to improve outcomes with and for care-experienced young people. I want to make clear that I remain very proud of what this Government continues to do in supporting care-experienced young people with a basic income pilot, and I hope that some of the disgraceful and untrue statements made about that pilot will cease now that there is a different series of leadership and management at a UK level, and I hope that will be taken on board on all sides of this Chamber and outside it.\n\nOn building safety, we have considered what is in the UK Building Safety Act 2022, in sections 116 to 125. What we already have in Wales is a new route to address fire safety in all residential buildings of 11m and over. It's not limited to buildings with cladding, and it applies to both internal and external fire safety issues. We are the only UK country to have made that commitment, so our approach is different to that of England. I know that Julie James has rehearsed this many times in the Chamber as well. We have also been clear that leaseholders should not be made to pay for work to rectify fire safety issues that are not of their making. That's why we're going to have a scheme for responsible persons, so they can invite all leaseholders that find themselves in that building to be properly supported, and we also have support provided for leaseholders who may need to take action.\n\nOn the infrastructure Act, I do believe the infrastructure Act takes us forward. It was the deliberate reason why we passed it, to update our planning structure so that people who want to invest in major infrastructure and development here can have a fit-for-purpose framework for doing so. And there is a balance, as the Member has pointed out, between our wider ambitions to deliver economic benefit and infrastructure investment, and some of the challenges where that development takes place, and where infrastructure around it takes place as well. That's why we've tried to balance that already to give investors certainty, but to understand how people can influence the planning system and the considerations to be properly taken into account when doing so.\n\nFor example, I would not think it would be a sensible thing, given the energy and effort we've spent on peatland restoration across Wales, to then plough up large areas of that peatland with all of the additional significant benefit it provides for biodiversity here in Wales as well. So, I do think the legislation that we have will help with that investor certainty, because I want to see investment take place here in Wales. I want to see it take place where we get the jobs that come with it, not simply the opportunity to generate one part of that economic chain.\n\nThe planning Bill is actually a consolidation Bill, and that's still important to ensure that in one place you have all of the planning legislation that applies. The danger otherwise is that you have planning considerations in different parts of our legislative framework, and you actually need lots and lots of legal ability and searching to make sure you gather all of that in one place. Now, if you're a well-resourced planning authority or planning consultant working in the private sector, you have the ability to do that. Actually, there's still an element of uncertainty that we can help to get through if we pass the planning Bill in the form that is going to be presented. I think, again, that will be good for businesses, good for local authorities, and good for individual residents and communities to have a single place to go to for planning considerations.\n\nOn the environmental governance and biodiversity Bill, this will, as I said in the statement, set out our commitments for restoration and improvement. So, the environmental principles and biodiversity Bill will be uniquely Welsh in considering what we need to do here in Wales, but we will, of course, have taken the opportunity to learn from what other parts of the UK have done, and that is what we should do. We should not be afraid to learn and look where there are other good ideas that we could apply here, and, equally, we should be clear-sighted in our determination to have legislation that is genuinely fit for purpose. And I'm sure that Members across the Chamber will engage in scrutiny of that legislation to ensure that they're content with the scheme that we've set out, but also the targets we'll have for restoring and improving biodiversity and nature across the country.\n\nWe are now in a regrettable position where there's more to be said about what's been dropped from the Government's legislative programme than what is in it: post-Brexit environmental governance arrangements that have long been in place in other nations of the UK are still being held up; pioneering measures to create a fully gender-balanced Senedd being repeatedly delayed, possibly now until 2030; the implementation of a transformational package of council tax reforms, developed as part of our co-operation agreement, being pushed back until after the next Senedd election. You're guaranteeing that the most deprived households will continue to be disproportionately penalised by an unfair, regressive and outdated system for at least another four years.\n\nNow, amidst those disappointments and, you know, major disappointments, there are some glimmers of hope that we certainly would still urge the Government not to lose sight of in the remaining year and a half of this Senedd term. We do believe that bus franchise reform to better connect our inherently disconnected communities is an urgent necessity. I welcome what we have in the statement today about legislation to promote Welsh language opportunities for all through education, and building a more resilient tourism sector in Wales. We also welcome the fact that the Government has pledged to introduce legislation to prohibit lying in politics, in response to the good work of my colleague Adam Price.\n\nBut, on the whole, I think the people of Wales need and want more than we have in this programme. It's a yearning for more fairness and ambition for Wales that drives our new, enlarged group of Plaid Cymru MPs at Westminster. They will certainly make the case at Westminster for fair funding for Wales's fair share from HS2, and also for measures to combat child poverty and to secure further devolution, including of the Crown Estate. But as I say, what's conspicuous in this legislative agenda that we've heard being outlined today is what's missing.\n\nFor instance, it's approaching six months now since the Independent Commission on the Constitutional Future of Wales published its final report. There's nothing outlined here that would give effect to any of its recommendations, recommendations that this Senedd wanted to see being accepted in full and with urgency. There's nothing outlined in paving the way to further devolution, including of crime and justice, something which Labour in Wales have long insisted is a priority, but which the new Secretary of State has consistently and explicitly ruled out. If this legislative agenda represents the scope of Labour's ambition for Wales, well, many people will be left cold. I want a Government that pushes the boundaries in terms of what the current devolution settlement can deliver, and that's not what we have in front of us today.\n\nWell, some of the comments made by the leader of Plaid Cymru did refer to the legislative programme, but much of it was nothing to do with our legislative programme and the simple disagreements between our parties about the direction of the future of Wales. I'm proud to say that I believe in the future of the union delivering for Wales and Britain, that I want to see reform for that to take place. We have our opportunity to take devolution forwards, now we do have a pro-devolution UK Labour Government. Much of that could and should be delivered without there being a need to see additional legislation for that to happen.\n\nI'm looking forward to powers being restored. I'm looking forward to new areas of devolution coming to this Senedd and to the Welsh Government, and I don't think we need a vision that attempts to recast reality on what we have already done, whether it be through the co-operation agreement or commitments we have, or the reality of how you actually deliver a legislative programme. It takes time to develop and go through the policy engagement stages, the White Paper, then engaging in Bills to be put before the Senedd. The idea that we could magic up a list of seven or eight different Bills the Member suggested might have happened, that's not very realistic and it's not an honest prospectus to the people of Wales.\n\nWe are, though, continuing to work through a number of areas that follow on in good faith from the co-operation agreement. We've been honest about where we've reached on council tax reforms, and there were genuinely respectful and constructive conversations about that. I don't see that as a failure; I see that as honesty in where we are, and in the reality that we didn't have the money to deliver the sort of scheme we'd have needed to. Living through a cost-of-living crisis that we still are not through, to have delivered a scheme that would have taken money to deliver to the wealthiest households I do not think is something that we could have done at this point. We’d have needed to have something to transition to the scheme. That’s an honest conversation that has taken place. And when it takes place about where we get to with Stage 1 on the candidate lists Bill, I think, again, there’s honesty about the position that took place at the end of my predecessor’s time in office, about needing to understand that Stage 1 report and to consider that, and understand how we take matters forward.\n\nWe have acted in good faith, and we will continue to do so. That’s why you continue to see commitments around the visitor levy and visitor accommodation Bills in this statement, because we’ve made commitments that we are sticking to. It’s why we’ll carry on delivering against the buses Bill, because we understand that will make a huge difference to communities across Wales, to have a much more rational way of investing public money in our bus network. We already invest a huge amount in the bus network. The majority of the money going into buses in Wales is public funds. If we pass the Bill, we’ll have a much better way to regulate that, to understand how the franchises work, and to make sure that money actually serves an economic and social purpose as well. We should get a better bus network as a result.\n\nI’m proud of the programme that we are putting before the Senedd. Passing these Bills, I believe, will make a practical difference in the lives of people right across Wales. It will enable us to look people directly in the eye and say that what we have done here in passing laws will have made a positive difference in their day-to-day lives—and more than that: all of the other powers and responsibilities we have here that don’t require legislation but are very much part of our agenda to make a difference for people here in Wales. There is absolutely no dimming of the ambition, or the requirement for that ambition, for the future of Wales. I believe we do now have a real opportunity in having two Governments that can be genuine partners in the success of Wales. I look forward to leading this Government to do just that.\n\nThank you for the comments and questions. I will address your comments as the standards Chair first, and then on what I think is more of a constituency interest in the buses Bill.\n\nOn standards, we all understand why we have come to having a conversation about recall, following a significant sanction against a Member and our understanding of what our system should look like. That’s partly because of changes made in the UK Parliament, and partly because we all, across parties, consider that it probably should not be the way that matters are dealt with in the future. And it’s the same point around deception: it's about the point around the standards that we expect of Members, and, in that case, for candidates to the Senedd as well.\n\nMy interest is in how we have a coherent scheme for this Senedd to consider that properly takes account of the standards we expect of each other, what the public expect of us, how those choices are made, and then the consequences of those choices as well. I think there are issues to think about in terms of improvements that have been made in the UK Parliament—I think the recall process is an improvement—but also to think about areas where I would not be so keen to follow the Westminster model.\n\nI think it has been a mistake to have a separate process for individual staff harassment that comes outside conduct of Members. The decoupling of those, I think, makes the system less coherent. I’m interested in how, working with the standards committee cross-party, we have a genuinely coherent scheme that looks at all forms of behaviour that we could and should expect of Members, that decision-making process, and then the expertise to undertake that as well.\n\nIt is no criticism of any individual who might be the standards commissioner, but you would not expect one individual to have all the understanding necessary to investigate every single potential complaint that comes in. So, it’s how we have a system that supports whoever the commissioner is to undertake their investigation. I’ve had the fortunate opportunity to be both a trade union rep and an employment lawyer, so I understand large parts of how the world of work works, including, because I was a specialist discrimination lawyer—. And actually, that can be challenging and different. There are other employment lawyers who won’t be specialists who don’t have the same understanding and expertise.\n\nSo, there’s something about how do we support whoever the commissioner is to have the right access to the right support to undertake their investigation work, and then to make sure we have a coherent scheme that meets the genuine cross-party desire to improve on our process. The Government is seriously committed to enabling the Senedd to consider that coherent scheme and for Members to be able to vote upon it before the end of this term, so it is in place for the next Senedd term in 2026.\n\nOn the bus Bill, I think this is one of the more exciting pieces of legislation that will make the difference that we often talk about. Not every member of the public is excited when they’re told that politicians are going to create a new law, but I do think this is one that will make a real practical difference across communities. Within the Member’s community that she represents, having a more coherent approach to bus services will make a real difference—and in my consistency too. Everyone in this Chamber, I think, can point to where a better system of bus regulation and support would make a bigger and better difference.\n\nWe’re proposing a new system, to move away from what is a deeply unstrategic and inefficient way of investing public money to one where we can have greater coherence and genuine work with local authorities to understand the routes that they require in a proper commissioning and franchising process, rather than, as we have now, local authorities often being left trying to rescue a route that is socially essential but isn’t necessarily always privately profitable. It will move away from simply competing for the most profitable routes and ignoring the ones of huge social value. At the moment, local authorities and the Government have all the pressure of being, if you like, the investor of last resort. We can do better, and the bus Bill, I think, will show us a way to do that in genuine partnership with colleagues across local government and beyond.\n\nCan I welcome the conciliatory and positive remarks that the Member made at the start? I do regularly reflect outside this Chamber that the Member has had a history of having to work with Labour local authority leaders and being able to do so in a pragmatic way to get things done. I wanted to do that with the previous Government. There were times we were able to do that, but I hope we'll have more opportunity to benefit the country now. And I respect the fact that the Member will scrutinise and challenge us throughout that process.\n\nWhen it comes to food and food security, I welcome the future generations commissioner's initiative. It's actually about looking at how we provide food in a secure and sustainable way for ourselves, and also what it means for food exports. Actually, the significant growth in the Welsh food and drink industry has been a real success story that we don't talk about enough, and that's a genuine success story in lots of parts of Wales. And it's adding value to that as well, so we're not just selling the raw product. I know Alun Davies isn't in the Chamber today, but when he claimed we were going to be increasing the food and drink output of the country and its economic value, lots of people thought that we would not achieve the difference he talked about. Actually, we outachieved that. And there's also the point about getting further upstream for economic value and food manufacturing. Those are still things we need to do and we can do in a genuinely sustainable way.\n\nI think this is actually a good example of where you don't need to change the law to improve outcomes. Actually, it's the way in which we balance our environmental responsibilities for high-quality food and drink production. That will help us in food security and understanding where our food comes from—the food that we export and import—in a way where we have a genuine eye to what sustainability looks like in a whole food system. That will also deal with some of the challenges that I think we'll get when it comes to some of the comments that Jenny Rathbone makes on a regular basis about needing to understand the public health impact of food that is not healthy and how we deal with ultra-processed food as well. I think this is a rounded debate that we can have that doesn't necessarily require a large-scale change in the law but does require a difference in approach and in the levers around resource and policy.\n\nOn the last question first, we do expect to be able to meet the call of a range of actors in the wider nature advocacy field on seeing significant improvement by 2030 and further improvement beyond. So, I think people can be positive about not just a statement, but when the detail of the Bill comes out as well. I think that, and your reference to the disused tips (mines and quarries) Bill, is part of the significant disagreement I have with the leader of Plaid Cymru that this is somehow an unambitious programme. These two pieces of legislation on their own will make a major difference across the country—a major positive change in helping us to have a better way to manage the environment and to understand how we can make disused quarries and tips safe. Because there are too many people who live in the shadow of them. We have a disproportionate number of those in Wales, because of our industrial past. That's in north, south and west Wales. So, it's not just an issue concentrated in one part of the country.\n\nI'm genuinely pleased that we are going to bring forward that Bill. It should be introduced before the end of the calendar year. That's our plan. I think that you'll be positive about the Bill when you see it, albeit there is a choice about not including opencast within it. That would significantly expand the legislative reach, and I think we need a different piece of legislation to consider the future management and restoration of opencast. This is about addressing disused quarries and mines, which is a significant undertaking in itself, and that's what we are committed to doing. On your point around future support for how to go about this work, I've already had conversations with both the Secretary of State for Wales and the Prime Minister around the fact that this is a priority for this Government. I expect us to make further bids into future funding.\n\nOne of the more disappointing parts of the recent past is that the now former Secretary of State for Wales at one point agreed to support a bid for funding to come to Wales—and it was actually, in UK spending terms, not a huge amount of money. He then reneged on that commitment and refused to make and support a bid for that resource to come. I think we can be confident that there will be a real and significant change with the new partnership that we have. Far from being disappointed with the partners we now have, I think there is real room for optimism and positivity. So, I look forward to being able to deliver on that.\n\nLook, it's an interesting suggestion. I want to start by welcoming what she had to say about our Bill to eliminate private profit. I believe it is not just a value statement, though, as important as that is, it's a practical step forward to make sure that the money that exists and has to be spent within the system is used for a better purpose and, actually, in a more efficient way. There's a real efficiency case for doing this that goes beyond whether people do or don't like the private sector operating in this space. But it does matter to children and young people who have been through the care system. And I was really struck by how strongly held that view was, that they'd felt—with exactly the same words you used—exploited by the fact that money was being made out of them, and in a way when, actually, their experience hadn't been a good one.\n\nI do think back to a number of the conversations that I had when I was the Deputy Minister for health, but actually one of the things that really struck in my mind was a conversation with Mark Drakeford, where he said, 'We spend lots of money in this system, and we don't buy good outcomes for our children and young people. On the whole, we buy poorer outcomes than should be delivered. So, standing back and simply putting more money into the system isn't the right thing to do.' And that still is the case now, for all of the improvements we have made. So, I'm generally very proud to support the Bill that my Government is bringing forward on eliminating private profit, and I think it will be seen as something that is a much better use of money on all fronts.\n\nAs for whether unpaid carers should be a protected characteristic, I'm open-minded but not persuaded. I'd be interested in seeing what practical difference that would make, how that could happen. It's not within this legislative programme. There will be people in this room who are unpaid carers, with caring responsibilities not just for children but for older adults as well. I'm not persuaded that this in itself is a way to improve outcomes for unpaid carers. There are other things we are doing, but I'm more than happy to continue to engage in the conversation, as indeed I'm sure other Ministers in the Government will be, around how we can make the biggest difference. Because that is the point here: how do we make a difference with and for those unpaid carers to recognise what they do, not just for their loved ones, but what it means for all of us.\n\nWell, I think there are important points around how we facilitate the building of new homes. Planning is a part of that, but it’s not often the main part of it. Actually, the main part is often land supply and certainty and decision making; that’s capacity within the planning system rather than the rules as they actually apply. The consolidation Bill will make this a great deal simpler, to understand how we’ve already had planning reform. I think in both previous terms of the Senedd, we had planning reform legislation go through. What we need to do is to make it much more accessible so that the rules are clear for everyone, and we then need to do a piece of work that I’m delighted that I’ve agreed with Julie James that Jack Sargeant will lead a working group on to look at what we can do in terms of bringing forward supply, and how we actually have a clearer understanding of not just the amount of housing we need, but the quality of the housing as well. It's of real economic benefit. It will help us meet some of our climate targets as well if we are able to deliver not just more homes, but much better homes as well, and that will often lead to significant local employment outcomes.\n\nThe visitor accommodation and regulation Bill is due to be introduced in 2025, in plenty of time to be passed in this term, and it will look at registration and licensing, so you can expect that to happen. The economy Secretary is the lead Minister on that, given its direct links to our economic prospects and futures. We needed to choose who the lead Minister was. There was interest from many more people, but I'm confident that we will see a piece of legislation that delivers against our manifesto and, indeed, as I said earlier, the good-faith commitments we have made in the co-operation agreement.\n\nThat also applies to building safety and for our homelessness legislation. I think the homelessness Bill will again be another piece of legislation that people will recognise as being genuinely progressive—earlier intervention and prevention of homelessness, what that means for families and children, what it means for how we use the public estate we currently have, as well as, to finish on the point that you ended on, the impetus for building homes that are genuinely fit for purpose. Everyone deserves a place to call home, a safe and decent place to call home. That is what we are committed to doing.\n\nOn buses, I welcome the Member's support for the bus Bill. It's a significant issue within the Cardiff Central constituency, and in the current Cardiff Central in the Senedd, of course, the new bus station is finally open, and a proper interchange, together with rail, and indeed with taxi services as well.\n\nOn buses and taxis, we previously had a proposal to do both things in one piece of legislation, and the Bill ended up being unmanageable and too big, and we also needed to make sure that we had the expertise focused on delivering against the piece of legislation that mattered, rather than having to shoehorn them both in. We do, though, have a policy issue and a practical issue around cross-bordering. I hear it loud and clear. We also, though, need to work through with different stakeholders, including representatives of taxi drivers themselves, to understand what a solution could look like. That is work that Ken Skates is engaged in with his officials, with local authorities, with operators and, as I said, representatives of taxi drivers themselves, because I'm keen that we see progress. I also know that there are commitments to look at this issue in England as well, because in large parts of Wales, cross-bordering isn't simply about local authorities in Wales, it is about people moving from one local authority across the whole border as well, so you see a number of people travelling from Bristol to work in Wales. You see that movement, which is entirely necessary and reasonable for lots of journeys in north-east Wales, where we have a number of areas where the border runs through settlements.\n\nOn coal tips, as I said in response to earlier questions, I do believe we will have a much more positive response from the new Government on respecting and reflecting on the industrial legacy of coal tips and disused quarries. It is an industrial past that predates devolution, and yet very real challenges exist now. I would not want a major slip to take place on my watch. I want us to have a shared programme where we understand how both Governments are prepared to invest in putting these things right. Some work to understand what that looks like has already been done. What we now need is willingness from the UK Government to invest alongside us to do just that.\n\nI think there are three relatively brief points. The first is that the building safety Bill, as I have indicated, is a priority for this Government. It'll be introduced in the next year. We do already provide, without having passed previous legislation—. As I responded to Andrew R.T. Davies, we provide practical support for leaseholders who wish to consider taking legal action against the developer of their property around fire safety issues, and we're also running a route to help improve fire safety issues, including those buildings that don't have cladding. We're the only UK nation to do that.\n\nOn your point around tribunals, I appreciate that lawyers in recovery will be interested in this. It is important that we’re having a coherent system around Welsh justice. That is a Bill that we may come to at the end of this term if we can deliver all other parts of the programme. So, it’s a possible introduction right at the end of the term, but it does depend on the length of time it takes us to legislate. I can tell you, I have been a Member in this place since 2011, and I have regularly seen how, at the end of a term, legislation is either rushed or is lost in a way that is not helpful for any of us. I do not want the major Bills that we have set out here to be at risk of being lost in the last week or two of term. If we’re able to make good progress on all of the radical and significant legislation that we have set out, then there may be opportunities to introduce a final Bill at the end, but these are the key priorities and this Government has taken a view on de-prioritising—difficult choices, but that allows a firmer platform to deliver this radical and progressive legislative reform programme, and I’m proud to do so; I will not get lost in simply comparing numbers of Bills as opposed to the practical impact of the legislation that we pass. That is the test that I want us to set: how can we use our powers to make a difference with fit-for-purpose legislation, not just simply count the numbers and not be concerned about the difference they have made.\n\nIt is a Bill that will begin to modernise our Welsh electoral system, to create a system that has our democratic health at its heart, fit for the twenty-first century. With this Bill, we are seeking to improve our democracy by improving how elections are run and how people can engage with them. Allowing automatic registration; ensuring that clear information is available to explain elections and the choice before the voter; putting in place services to encourage people from the most under-represented groups to participate in decision making that impacts on all our lives through the privilege of serving our communities and elected bodies; establishing the electoral management board, putting the excellent voluntary work of the electoral community on a sounder footing. While the Bill will result in the abolition of the Independent Remuneration Panel for Wales, the principles and evidence-based approach that the panel has taken will be built upon and strengthened as the remuneration function becomes part of the Democracy and Boundary Commission Cymru.\n\nThese reforms complement reforms to the Senedd made through the Senedd Cymru (Members and Elections) Act 2024 and will also open the door to additional legislation, which I committed to at Stage 3 last week, to introduce a further Bill for 2026 to introduce a system of recall or removal of Senedd Members where serious malfeasance has occurred, and to legislate for candidates and Members to be held to account for statements of deliberate deception. I am pleased to note the cross-party support for this objective. I look forward to receiving the recommendations from the standards committee in due course.\n\nWe have a new Government in Westminster, and I am pleased that they have also committed to legislating for automatic registration and extending the electoral franchise to 16 for UK elections. In Wales, we have led the way by extending the electoral franchise to 16-year-olds already. Via automatic registration, we will be responding to the challenge posed by the Electoral Commission to tackle non-registration. Having a comprehensive electoral register is fundamental to our democracy. Automatic registration will have the potential to add the missing 400,000 Welsh electors to the register. For UK elections, it has the potential to add around 7 million to the register. If citizens are not on the register, they cannot vote. If they are on the register, they can.\n\nThe stability of our democracy and our democratic health is dependent on the participation of voters and their mandate. We can see around the world, and indeed at home, the increasing challenges to democracy, freedom and the rule of law. I recall the political wisdom displayed on the Tower colliery National Union of Mineworkers' banner, 'The price of freedom is eternal vigilance', and we must indeed be vigilant in opposing those who would undermine the foundations of our freedom and democracy and civil rights, fought for so hard and with so many sacrifices by our predecessors.\n\nWe can be proud that, through this Senedd, Wales has taken the lead across the UK in beginning the process of building a twenty-first century electoral system, upholding the highest principles of electoral accountability, accessibility, inclusion and diversity. So, this is not the end of the road, and there is more to do.\n\nThis Bill has broad consensus. We have seen this within the Senedd, and with the wider community of interested organisations that welcomed the Bill’s contents, both in our October 2022 White Paper consultation, and indeed during scrutiny. And I’d like to express my thanks to all Members and committees for their consideration and scrutiny of this Bill. I am particularly grateful to Joel James for working with us on his amendment, which will help to ensure proper relationships between town and community councils and their clerks. I would like to thank Adam Price for his considerable engagement with this Bill. We agreed some of his amendments in committee and supported the principle of many others, but disagreed, sometimes, on the means. Your contributions have ensured that this Bill is in the best position it can be, and I'm very grateful to you. I'm grateful to all the stakeholders and experts who have contributed their views and expertise during the Bill’s legislative scrutiny. Also to officials of the Welsh Government and Senedd Commission for their support to myself and Members throughout this Bill’s journey. I hope the Senedd will support the well-thought-out and well-thought-through provisions contained in this Bill.\n\nFirst of all, I would like to, again, thank the whole Bill team for all of their work—they've put in a huge amount of it. Also, could I thank both Adam Price and the Counsel General for your generous engagement through the process? Whilst we didn't always agree with things, it was a healthy opportunity to come together.\n\nWhile we are saddened, or I'm saddened, that not more of our amendments were accepted, such as our accessibility amendment, which would have made voting in person more accessible to all, we are grateful that our amendments that include an increase in the notice period from 45 days to 60 days after which a person will be registered to vote without application were accepted. As I have mentioned in all stages of the Bill, we need to be careful with people's information, and people are often wishing to remain anonymous for a good reason, so we are glad that this notice period has been extended. Also, our amendment that requires Welsh Ministers to undertake consultation before making any pilot regulations in relation to electoral registration without application was also accepted by the Senedd, which I'm grateful for.\n\nI would also like to thank Joel James for all of the work that he has done on amendments 23 and 24, which ensure that clerks are not able to become community, county and county borough councillors, which will ensure that their roles as officers—proper officers—are independent and not politically motivated. We are grateful for these amendments also being accepted.\n\nLlywydd, whilst I recognise the amount of work put into the Bill from all sides of this Chamber, I'm afraid we can't fully support it, even amended, due in the main to our opposition to the registration to vote without application.\n\nOne consequential, though, out of the Bill, which was driven through the process to date, was, obviously, the new offence of deception that Adam Price brought forward. Now, I know that that has fallen away, but your commitment in the Chamber last week was very welcome, and identified in the legislative programme earlier today. That gives me confidence that we can take that forward and start rebuilding the trust that we really do need to.\n\nI'd like to thank, again, everybody for their work on this Bill, but for the reason that I shared just now, the Conservative group will be voting against at Stage 4.\n\nWe in Plaid Cymru will be supporting this important Bill because of the progress it represents in reforming our democracy in Wales, and the main focus of the Bill, of course, in terms of automatic voter registration, as the Counsel General outlined, which will ensure that our democracy can represent the views of our citizens more effectively. We also welcome some other aspects of the Bill that the Counsel General referred to, namely the attempt to ensure greater diversity within our democratic system, at a Welsh Parliament and local government level, and that, once again, so as to ensure that our democracy can reflect the whole of society, and also to create and tailor individual schemes or plans to address lack of representation in terms of some important sections of society. So, I welcome those positive elements.\n\nWe are disappointed, as was mentioned by Peter Fox, that there were some amendments that weren't accepted by the Government, for example, those related to accessibility, particularly the ability of blind people, for example, to participate in the democratic process in an equal manner. We are also very disappointed with the Government's rejection of putting the electoral system on an equal footing in terms of language, and making the electoral system subject to the Welsh language standards, and we still hope that the Government will change its view on that.\n\nThere were a number of other issues that were brought forward during the scrutiny process, for example, an effort to use the powers that we have to regulate the possible negative impacts of artificial intelligence, deepfake videos, and so on. Lee Waters has put forward some comments on this based on the seminar that he participated in in Singapore recently. I do very much hope that this will be an issue that we can return to in due course, and if there isn't action on a UK-wide level, we should certainly use the powers that we have to regulate our own democracy here in Wales.\n\nI welcome the amendments that the Government had accepted. I would have liked to have seen greater engagement and a greater willingness to collaborate, to reflect the fact that the Government doesn't have a majority in this place. We will be supporting this Stage 4 motion, but without the support of some opposition parties at this point, this Bill would fall. So, I do think that we need to improve the way that we do collaborate on a cross-party basis across the Senedd, to reflect the arithmetic of our democracy, and that no single party, including the party of Government, has monopoly on truth or good ideas.\n\nI should make reference, as the Counsel General and Peter Fox did, to one of the great topics of discussion during the course of this Bill, this issue of deception, which is a crucially important issue, not only for our democracy here in Wales, but on a global level too. We look forward now to co-operating on a cross-party basis as we take this idea and implement it by means of the Bill that was mentioned in the legislative programme earlier this afternoon.\n\nIt is important that we do address the lack of trust in our politics, because we are facing a challenge and a crisis in democracy, indeed. We saw the lowest percentage that's participated in a general election in Wales—only 56 per cent—so we do face challenges in terms of strengthening our democracy. I would say that it's only through the cross-party co-operative spirit, everyone bringing their own ideas forward, and everyone trying to work together in order to reach the aim that I'm sure we all share, having the most lively democracy possible in Wales—. In that spirit, we will be supporting the Bill at Stage 4. We welcome the progress it represents, but look forward to continuing on to the next chapter with the other Bill that I mentioned.\n\nDiolch yn fawr, Llywydd. I welcome all the comments that have been made. Referring to Jane Dodds's comments last of all, the health of our democracy, I think, is an issue of such importance. The points you raised we are all aware of and have been commented on. We recognise how important it is to our stability, but also to our fundamental freedoms. Of course, the ability to make these changes today—and these are very radical changes—comes from the Wales Act 2017. It was one of the key parts of why I was so supportive of that Act, because if you don't have control over your electoral system, you are effectively disempowered, and our ability today to make radical change electorally and to modernise our system is really important.\n\nIf I could refer to Peter Fox's comments, I am very disappointed that the Conservative opposition is not supporting this Bill. I have to say right at the beginning I always thought that as a group you wouldn't, because the Conservative Party has supported all sorts of methods of voter suppression over the past years. It is so disappointing that you are actually opposing the introduction of automatic registration and the possibility of there being another 400,000 Welsh electors on the electoral register. I'm so disappointed because I suspect that is the main reason why you are actually opposing this Bill—because it opens out democracy in a way that I think would be far more inclusive and involve far more people. I think you have struggled to find reasons to oppose this Bill. I hope you will reconsider, but I doubt that that will actually happen.\n\nAdam, in terms of the point you raised, I very much take note of the points you make on diversity. Diversity and inclusivity is a very important part of this particular Bill. In fact, this Bill takes us further in those particular areas than, I think, in any other previous legislation. The issues relating to the potential digitisation of the electoral register really open the door to very radical, very dramatic and very fundamental change. I think this legislation is a very significant step forward.\n\nThank you for the support. I urge all Members now to support Stage 4 so that this radical—groundbreaking for the UK—legislation can go forward for Royal Assent. Diolch.\n\nWhilst I do appreciate the principle underpinning all of these amendments, it's important to be clear about the very real unintended consequences they would risk. Statutory consultation in all circumstances could disadvantage local tax payers in Wales by delaying or even preventing the provision of new support. These amendments would make it practically unworkable to provide new support to ratepayers in certain circumstances, including when the Welsh Government's approach is affected by a UK Government autumn statement. This is not a theoretical issue—it arises annually as a core consideration in the setting of the Welsh Government's draft budget.\n\nDuring earlier stages of scrutiny, I gave examples of recent circumstances where we couldn't have acted to provide support in the required timescales if such a requirement had applied to our existing powers. Whilst the effect of these amendments would not apply to those existing powers, the examples do help demonstrate the barrier to positive intervention that these amendments would present.\n\nI'll now comment on the individual amendments in this group, with reference to the most relevant examples that I previously provided. Amendments 3 to 5 relate to power to confer and withdraw NDR reliefs by regulations. We could not have brough forward regulations in time to provide transitional relief for the 2023 revaluation if we had been compelled to consult on the proposals first. This is an intervention that achieved cross-party support in the Senedd and was welcomed by ratepayers. Providing the relief a year later would have been too late and thousands of ratepayers would have been disadvantaged. I don't believe that this is an outcome that the Senedd would have wanted or should risk in relation to interventions it will wish to support in future that rely on the powers provided in the Bill.\n\nAmendment 8 relates to powers to confer and withdraw NDR exemptions by regulations. Similarly to reliefs, this amendment could disadvantage ratepayers in Wales by delaying the provision of a new exemption in circumstances where this is considered to be the most appropriate way to reduce NDR liability to zero.\n\nAmendment 10 relates to the power to set differential multipliers by regulations. During earlier stages of scrutiny, I provided a detailed explanation of potential unintended consequences of such a duty, and I committed to consult before introducing any differential multiplier. However, an ongoing duty to consult in relation to the annual maintenance of differential multipliers could disadvantage ratepayers. This is because any such annual maintenance couldn't be implemented until after the UK Government's autumn statement, which informs the Welsh Government's approach to the annual setting of the multiplier. If consultation were required in relation to the annual maintenance of differential multipliers, there would simply be insufficient time to prepare regulations and to bring them into force before local authorities undertake their annual billing.\n\nIn recent years, we have made regulations to support ratepayers by freezing or limiting inflationary growth in the multiplier, generally with cross-party support in the Senedd. This amendment would not afford us the equivalent annual flexibility in relation the relative level of any differential multiplier that might exist in future. It could, therefore, prevent us from considering potential options that the Senedd may support, such as freezing or capping a differential multiplier. This is an approach that the Welsh Conservatives themselves have argued for, when we set the multiplier for the current year. It's not currently possible to consider such an approach, and that situation would persist if amendment 10 is adopted.\n\nAmendments 13, 16 and 17 relate to powers to make regulations about council tax discounts. These amendments could disadvantage council tax payers in Wales by delaying or even preventing the provision of new support, especially in emergency situations. During earlier stages of scrutiny, I gave examples of when we were able to respond quickly to ensure host households offering accommodation to people Ukraine seeking safety from war did not lose out entitlements to discounts and incur additional council tax costs. This support would not have been provided expediently if such procedures had applied. So, in conclusion, I would ask Members to resist amendments 3, 4, 5, 8, 10, 13, 16 and 17.\n\nThank you. Turning first to the amendment tabled by Peter Fox, amendment 9 would, in effect, require the powers provided by section 10 to be used to set a small business multiplier, and as I set out during the earlier stages of scrutiny, there's no current policy intention to create a small business multiplier in Wales. This is just one example of an approach that would be possible to adopt under the powers in section 10 of the Bill. There are other ways in which the Welsh Government might wish to target the use of any differential multipliers in relation to our priorities and the needs of Wales, and section 10 is intended to enable analysis of a wider range of policy options when considering whether to introduce a differential multiplier for Wales. Importantly, there has been no consultation on introducing a small business multiplier. Amending the Bill in this way would actually be counter to the principle behind amendment 10 in relation to consultation and my commitment to consult before introducing a differential multiplier.\n\nTurning to the other amendment in this group, tabled by Peredur Owen Griffiths, amendment 1 would require the Welsh Ministers to publish a statement of their policy on the use of the powers to calculate NDR multipliers. This would apply not only to the power to proscribe differential multipliers in section 10, but also to the existing power to set the single multiplier that currently exists. As I explained during stage 2 proceedings, this amendment is not necessary as the existing framework already allows for the intended clarity and opportunity for scrutiny. The long-established default calculation of the multiplier, as set out in primary legislation, maintains NDR revenue in real terms. Each time we use our powers to depart from that calculation, we will continue to set out the Welsh Government's policy as part of the debate required to seek the Senedd's approval of the associated regulations under the affirmative procedure. I've committed to consulting before introducing any differential multiplier, which will naturally involve setting out our policy. Once any differential multiplier is implemented, the established annual considerations and processes will apply. So, in conclusion, I would ask Members to resist amendments 1 and 9.\n\nAs we've heard, most of the amendments in this group would subject regulations made under most of the powers in the Bill to a superaffirmative procedure in the form of a minimum laying period of 60 days. A superaffirmative procedure is only used in exceptional instances where the affirmative procedure is not considered to be sufficient. And, as I set out during previous stages of scrutiny, I don't believe that that is the case in relation to the provisions in this Bill.\n\nAmendment 11 relates to the powers in relation to NDR to define artificial avoidance arrangements, confer and withdraw reliefs and exemptions, and set differential multipliers by regulations. Amendments 12, 15 and 18 relate to powers to make regulations about council tax discounts. None of the range of existing powers for Welsh Ministers to make regulations in relation to NDR and council tax is subject to superaffirmative procedures. Whilst I do appreciate the principle underpinning this amendment, it is important to be clear about the real unintended consequences that it would risk. Superaffirmative procedures could disadvantage local tax payers in Wales by delaying or even preventing the provision of new support. This would be a particular problem where the budget available to inform the Welsh Government's approach is affected by the UK Government's autumn statement, or where we decide to provide new support in emergency circumstances. The examples that I set out in relation to the proposed statutory consultation duties are equally relevant to this matter. These examples, which I will not repeat, demonstrate how this amendment could prevent interventions to support local tax payers, which this Senedd would support. A superaffirmative procedure would also lead to a delay in addressing identified NDR-avoidance arrangements, resulting in the prolonged avoidance of liability.\n\nAmendment 27 would apply the affirmative procedure to the commencement of the new duties for ratepayers to provide information to the VOA. It is not standard practice to subject commencement Orders to a scrutiny procedure. As I explained during earlier stages, the provisions are set out in full and available for scrutiny during the passage of the Bill. I have provided clear assurances that the provisions will not be commenced until the Welsh Government is satisfied that ratepayers can be reasonably expected to comply.\n\nThe VOA's evidence to the Local Government and Housing Committee during Stage 1 provided further assurance about the work that they are doing to ensure the arrangements are straightforward for ratepayers to engage with. I'm not, therefore, persuaded that further Senedd approval is necessary when we are ready to commence the provisions. So, in conclusion, I would ask Members to resist amendments 11, 12, 15, 18 and 27.\n\nThank you. So, amendment 19 seeks to remove section 20 of the Bill, which replaces the current outdated requirement for local authorities to publish council tax notices in a local newspaper with a requirement to publish the information electronically. And I think this has been the surprise star of the show in relation to what's a very complex and wide-ranging piece of legislation reforming local government finance.\n\nI am grateful to all colleagues for the points that have been raised in this debate, and I'm very grateful indeed to the Senedd committees for their intense scrutiny of this particular provision. In fact, the Local Government and Housing Committee held an additional evidence session on this topic, which heard differing evidence and views from a range of stakeholders. I've written to Members setting out my rationale for including these measures in the Bill, which are intended to modernise working practices relating to council tax, and I also took the opportunity in that correspondence to correct some of the misunderstandings that have been expressed as well.\n\nThe statutory requirement for local authorities to publish council tax notices was put in place in 1992, when communicating with citizens was commonly carried out through notices in newspapers, but now, 30 years on, this is widely considered to be an inflexible approach to providing council tax information, left behind by technological advances and other changes in the tax system.\n\nI absolutely acknowledge the invaluable work that our local and national newspapers do to inform and engage with communities across Wales, and I fully appreciate the difficult economic climate that print newspapers are currently operating in. Last week, I met with and listened to representatives of the News Media Association. I was able to provide them with reassurance that the intention is not to remove statutory requirements for other types of notices—indeed, that would fall out of the agreed scope of this Bill.\n\nThere is a clear reason why council tax notices are different from other types of public notices. Public notices about planning applications, for example, provide important information for residents to have the opportunity to object to or voice their support for plans that impact directly on their neighbourhood, which they might otherwise be unaware of. However, the council tax notice provides information that all council tax payers will receive directly as part of their annual Bill, whether they choose to receive that electronically or in hard copy, and for this reason, the arguments, I think, about digital exclusion don't really hold water. The Bill does, nonetheless, provide a duty on local authorities to ensure the information is accessible to people who can't access a website, and I did accept a Stage 1 recommendation to work with local government to monitor the implementation of that provision.\n\nI'm afraid I also don't think it's reasonable to argue that the loss of revenue generated from one advert per financial year, which might bring in as little as £600, would make a newspaper unsustainable. But I do agree with colleagues this afternoon who have talked about the importance of having that wider discussion about what's really a much more complex issue in terms of how we support local media and also how we communicate most effectively with residents. An annual advert published on an unspecified day in March that reaches less than an estimated 1.5 per cent of residents doesn't appear to achieve the outcome of effective communication.\n\nBut, Deputy Llywydd, having said all of that, I do absolutely recognise the strength of feeling amongst colleagues on this particular issue, and I'm always keen to find areas of compromise where we can, and to work with other parties. I'm very grateful to Peter Fox and also to Peredur Owen Griffiths for the collegiate and creative discussions that we've had on this particular issue.\n\nI have had to ask colleagues to resist other amendments today, because of the potential unintended consequences that might negatively impact on taxpayers, but I don't think that this amendment is in that space. So, in the spirit of listening to colleagues and also listening to stakeholders and respecting those conversations, we'll be abstaining in the vote on this particular amendment today.\n\nYear after year, council tax imposes a disproportionate burden on lower income households, thus exacerbating entrenched social inequalities. A case for replacing this regressive system of taxation with a fairer, more progressive model is incontrovertible, long overdue and widely acknowledged. Reforming this broken and outdated system of taxation has been a cornerstone of Plaid Cymru policy for many years, and we were proud to work jointly with the Government to deliver this within the current Senedd term. We firmly believe that we had a credible framework that could have been in place by the start of the next financial year, as promised, but sadly the Government thought otherwise, and not for the first time, we’re faced with a key part of their legislative agenda being deprioritised due to internal Labour Party problems.\n\nWe’re under no illusions that this reform will be a complex undertaking, and I’m sure that the Cabinet Secretary will try to justify the delay on that basis in her response. But such is the nature of the radical and necessary solution we need to create a fairer society, I would ask Labour Members here particularly to reflect on the real-world implications of kicking this reform into the long grass, especially for lower income families who are continuing to struggle to make ends meet during the cost-of-living crisis. As you said earlier, Cabinet Secretary, a delay would disadvantage the most vulnerable, but by not acting on council tax reform until 2028 at the very earliest, this Government is condemning those with the least means to another three years of disproportionately high council tax bills, whilst those with the broadest shoulders are not made to pay their fair share for public services.\n\nEven though we have heard time and time again in the recent election campaign that this was an election for change, at the first opportunity for change in Wales we get the status quo for the next three years. So, change means more of the same. But it’s not too late for course correction. It’s in this spirit that we have brought forward this amendment, which will place an obligation on the Welsh Government to implement council tax reform by April 2025, as was originally intended. For the sake of easing the pressure on the household budgets of the most disadvantaged in our society, I would urge Members to grasp the nettle and commit to this vitally important reform as soon as possible. Diolch.\n\nAmendment 2 would add a requirement for the Welsh Ministers to implement council tax reform by 1 April 2025. However, there’s no definition offered in the amendment of what is meant by council tax refor"
