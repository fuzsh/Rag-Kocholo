        "text": "This article explores how the land and the agricultural community were made out to be central to the assertion of Welsh national identity between the world wars. Political Nationalism came out of a disillusion with Liberal national sentiment. Liberal nationalists had recognised the significance of the land in Wales and made secure a devolved administrative regime for agriculture, the Welsh Council of Agriculture, originally established before 1914. For the political Nationalists, however, this was far too little. They perceived a cultural and economic crisis which might be overcome only through complete self-government. That crisis originated historically in the annexation of Wales to England which had intruded an alien land system and destroyed a natural, patriarchal rural order; which had foisted an alien commercial, industrial system and had led to the Anglicisation of Welsh society. In its depressed state, inter-war Wales was subjected to a new and reactive form of politics, often influenced by European right wing ideas, which was anti-urban, anti-capitalist, anti-English and anti-modern, all of which had wider repercussions for the future of Welsh identity.\n\n2.

Edwards, Yn y Wlad: troeon crwydr yma ac acw yng Nghymru (1921 ed.), p.11. [To the Welshman[sic], it is difficult for him to make his home in the town; he's the child of the mountain and the sea and the clean open air. A longing awakens in his heart for the cwm (combe) and the lake and the fields, and the enchantment of this dream brings him out of the settlements of men to his own country. Her air is rarely darkened by the heavy smoke of cities. There are miles between village and village and there all the secrets of nature are opened to those who would wish to see them.]\n\n8. Owen M. Edwards, ‘Nodiadau’, in Owen M. Edwards, Cartrefi Cymru ac Ysgrifau Eraill (1962 ed.), p. 102. [Patriotism has always been a powerful force, and always for good. It includes self-sacrifice, the self is lost in the country; there is a sanctification to it, – it sweeps away selfishness like dried chaff and extinguishes family rivalries which are the bitterness of barbaric life, and brings a man closer to God. In the power of his patriotism lies the strength of the best features of man's character; opposed to patriotism are the worst things in his character, – the desire for wealth, hatred of his fellow man, prejudice.]\n\n9. Owen M. Edwards, ‘Llanwrtyd’, in Owen M. Edwards, Cartrefi Cymru ac Ysgrifau Eraill, p. 147. [If the last prince fell by your banks [River Irfon], the folk being raised in Muallt will be better princes to you. Asleep and awake, your murmuring voice comes to my ears, and your scenery arises in a beauteous dream before my eyes. And like the sound of your music in my memories, the sweet sound of your preachers will remain in the life of my country. And as long as there will be music in your waves, Welsh will be spoken on your banks.]\n\n13. Iorwerth C. Peate, ‘Y crefftwr yng Nghymru’[The craftsman in Wales], Y Ddraig Goch, Mehefin 1929, 4. [We all know now that this age is a crossroads in our nation's history. Ahead of us lies the industrial age with advanced industry and the latest techniques all contributing to cheap production. Behind us, in Wales lies a civilisation that's five thousand years old – beginning with the period when migrations came from the east with means of agriculture and taming animals to form the basis of our country's culture. And when this way of life fails an age will end which is so long and so old that we cannot properly grasp its antiquity.\n\nAnd indeed, perhaps some of you are asking whether this present age is a crossroads at all. I say without hesitation yes, and it is necessary to decide today what will befall Wales's culture. The old way of looking at things – God bless those who developed it – is taking a turn in our age. Truly if we do not bestir ourselves, it will cease to be.]\n\n28. Bebb, ‘Achub Cymru’, 195–6. [All the farmers and all the servants in a county should join together to secure agriculture's interests – in order to sell well, in order to buy cheaply, and thus farmers win and servants win. Within this union servants will have their own union to achieve the highest wage in payment for their higher productivity. The same with the farmers. Similarly the two sides in all the counties, until the formation of a union of farmers and servants which will represent the whole of Wales. And that will be a happy day for agriculture, and, as a result, for Wales!] The non-sequiturs did not occur to Bebb, apparently.\n\n29. Saunders Lewis, ‘Cenedlaetholdeb a chyfalaf’ [Nationalism and capitalism], Y Ddraig Goch, Mehefin 1926, 3. [A nation in which the majority of its members are petit capitalists, as owners of land or each holding his share in a works or factory or quarry, that's a nation which will nurture proud men and women, fearless, possessing neither deference nor hypocrisy nor silent anger nor treachery. A nation hard to conquer nor to shame nor to subdue so as to forsake her privileges and birthright.] Cf.

(Woodbridge, 2006), pp. 36–52Google Scholar, esp. 47 n. Welsh Nationalists shared the concern of English rural advocates about supplying an appropriate education for rural dwellers, emphasising, however, that it should be culturally distinctive from that organised by Whitehall. Hence, they were prominent in campaigning for a separate Welsh Council for Education.

In 1929, John had argued that Wales suffered from being tied to England. Since English policies were unsuitable for Wales this was reflected not only in the higher incidence of TB but also in female mortality rates, especially, again, in rural Wales. It was the effects of the contrasting occupational patterns which were not being addressed. As many as 42% of Welsh workers were in extractive industries compared with 13% in England, and 30% of Welsh workers were in agriculture compared with 7% in England.\n\n74. Saunders Lewis, Paham y Llosgasom yr Ysgol Fomio [Why We Burned the Bombing School] (1937?).\n\n[Can you try to understand our feelings when we saw scholars and authors in England referring to the ‘sanctity’ of ducks and swans, and on that score succeeding in getting the Minister for the Air Force to move the bombing school, and we in Wales, and exactly at the same time having to organise a great national campaign to defend really sacred things in God's creation, namely nation, her language, her literature, her age old traditions and Christian rural life, and we not even having from the government as much as a hearing for a deputation to discuss the matter?]\n\n75. ‘Baldwin . . . Ddoe a Heddiw’[Baldwin . . . Yesterday and Today], Y Ddraig Goch, Ebrill 1937, 12, in which the praises he had heaped upon the unspoiled Welsh landscape at a St David's Day banquet in 1927 were thrown back at him. He had suggested the nationalisation of land of outstanding natural beauty. Interestingly, Lloyd George, in his presidential address to the National Eisteddfod at Neath in 1935 had emphasised preserving the rural from the philistines (The Times, 9th August 1935, p. 8). For Baldwin and his essay ‘On England’ (1937), see K. Robins, Great Britain: Identities, Institutions and the Idea of Britishness (1988), pp. 202–3.\n\n78. And also more military installations. Contemporaneously with Penyberth was the move to establish an air base in the Vale of Glamorgan, against which the Nationalists (and notably Iorwerth Peate) raised a voice, but not so stridently; perhaps because industrial and commercial interests in nearby Cardiff were so strongly in favour. More resistance was nurtured to the intention to establish a mines depot at Trecŵn, Pembrokeshire. See ‘Llywodraeth Loegr yn Meddiannu Trecwn’, Y Ddraig Goch, Hydref 1936, 2. Most crucially came the appropriation of large tracts of Mynydd Epynt, Breconshire in 1940. See Gruffudd, Pyrs, ‘Welsh Language and the Geographical Imagination’, 122–8; Herbert Hughes, An Uprooted Community: A History of Epynt (Llandysul, 1998)Google Scholar. In the immediate post-war period, the continued military appropriation of land in Wales led to an effective oppositional alliance between Welsh scholars and some local communities such as Trecŵn and was a fillip to the Nationalist movement. On the impact of the war on Welsh agricultural practice more generally, see Moore-Colyer, R.J., ‘The County War Agricultural Executive Committees: The Welsh Experience, 1939–1945’, Welsh History Review, 22:3 (2005), 558–87Google Scholar.\n\n79. Mudiad Cymru Fydd was largely composed of Nationalists and Liberals and during the ensuing few decades acted as a pressure group, drawing Welsh MPs’ attention to cultural, economic and social (especially rural) issues which affected the Welsh nation and petitioning the respective governments about securing greater Welsh institutional recognition. Its principal spokesman and secretary was T.I. Ellis, son of the prominent late Victorian Liberal Nationalist MP, Thomas Edward Ellis. See Jones, R. Gerallt, A Bid for Unity. The Story of Undeb Cymru Fydd 1941–1966, with a postscript to 1970 (Denbigh, 1971)Google Scholar. It had emerged from more local and ad hoc ‘defensive’ groups during 1938–40.\n\n80. Plaid Genedlaethol after 1945 was recast as Plaid Cymru under the leadership of Gwynfor Evans into a more coherent electoral machine purporting to better defend the rural areas of Wales than the predominant Labour party. In actuality, the rural electorate was less impressed by nationalism prior to 1966 but the failure of Whitehall adequately to address rural recovery in Wales presented Plaid with a fruitful agenda. The post-war Labour government's one significant constitutional concession to Wales in the form of the advisory Council for Wales and Monmouthshire (1949) had included as one of its major remits the regeneration of rural Wales."
