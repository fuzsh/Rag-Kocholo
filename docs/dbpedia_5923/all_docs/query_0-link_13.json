        "text": "Usually when a political party applies a label to themselves (national socialist) which clearly does not apply, and suddenly the whole population seems to believe it even though there is no real evidence for it, it is usually due to a heavy, heavy dose of propaganda and media control. Most likely the media in your country is mainly all owned by a very small number of organizations or individuals, and through some kind of collaboration between those owners, the exact same ideas get fed to everyone through the same sources, until there are too many people repeating it (and sure they know what they are talking about it) for any of these geniuses to ever be convinced otherwise.\n\nI live in the USA and know nothing about your political parties, but it is a similar situation here. Only here people we have a socialist dictatorship disguised as a democracy, because our freedom of the press is undermined by a high cost of media delivery and the fact that ALL of the media is owned by 5 different companies."
