        "text": "This article is designated a work in progress. Please ask the wiki team before adding content.\n\nThe information in this article is part of an upcoming rework, and may not be reflected in other articles.\n\nThe current British political system is a dominant-party system, having emerge in the mid-1930s following earlier periods of shifting democratic fortunes. Traditionally, Britain had functioned as a two-party system, the two dominant parties having been the Conservative Party and the Liberal Party though the Labour Party had unseated the Liberals as the second largest party in Parliament in 1923 and would continue to hold this position into the 1924 election despite a drop in its vote share. Following the British Revolution and the implementation of proportional voting, the political scene experienced one of the most far-reaching upheavals in British history. The Conservative Party had vanished from British politics and in its place, a dominant but heavily factionalised Labour Party had become the centre of politics. This period has been informally referred to as the 1Â¾ party system owing to the dominant Labour Party and the affiliate Independent Labour Party dominating politics with a rump Liberal Party providing token opposition at the national stage alongside independents and some regionalists.\n\nBy 1930, politics had shifted to a point in which Labour was not necessarily the dominant party and multiple other parties were emerging. Feuding in the Independent Labour Party had isolated it from Labour before it eventually split off altogether; the Liberals were making political comeback and a new centrist party had emerged in Harold Macmillan's New Democratic Party. Likewise, special interest parties were emerging across the country in form the of agrarian Rural Party and small regionalist parties in Scotland and Wales. This brief period has been referred to as the multi-party system owing Labour de facto losing its monopoly on power and the emergence of a broad spectrum of ideological development and the parties to represent it. This period came to an end in 1933 following the 1932 Parliamentary Crisis and the banning of the ILP, the NDP and the Liberals. Much of the dissident ILP was absorbed into Labour proper though out of its death, a rightist splinter emerged to form the Social Democratic Party, led by Hugh Dalton. At a national level, politics was stratified around the Labour Party with it becoming the dominant party in the Federal Congress, the SDP providing a token opposition. However, at a sub-federal level politics would be atomised with members of the dissident opposition organising into various splinter parties giving Labour an artificial, if tenuous, hold on local politics. This situation has led to the incumbent period being referred to as the dominant-party system or the factional system in reference to Labour's overarching control of politics amid widespread factionalism.\n\nPolitical Parties[]\n\nLabour Party[]\n\nMain article: Labour Party (Union of Britain)\n\nThe Labour Party is a political party in the Union of Britain and the dominant party of state, having continuously held power in Britain since the end of the British Revolution. The exact ideology of the Labour Party is difficult to quantify due to its broad nature but it has been described as, and refers to itself as, a \"broad popular front of all leftist groups within Great Britain committed to upholding the ideals of the British Revolution and securing the liberty livelihood of the British workers and their comrades abroad.\" To this end, the Labour Party has been described as an alliance orthodox syndicalists, democratic socialists, social democrats, trade unionists and revolutionary socialists. Since 1923, Labour has made up the government within Great Britain barring the period of 1924-1925 encompassing the period of the National Government and civil war. Likewise, Labour controls all Regional Assemblies in the Union of Britain and holds a supermajority in both houses.\n\nHistory[]\n\nThe party was founded in 1900 by Kier Hardie, having grown out of the trade union movement and socialist parties of the 19th century, principally the Independent Labour Party. Labour experienced a slow rise to influence in the United Kingdom, having experienced an electoral breakthrough in the post-war 1919 elections which saw it enter a close third place, behind the Liberal Party. At the next election in 1923, it overtook the Liberal Party to become the second largest party in parliament, behind the Conservatives. Working with the Liberals to sink the Conservative agenda, Labour were permitted to form a minority government under Ramsay MacDonald though this collapsed less than a year later amid the fallout of the Cachin Letter scandal. MacDonald was assassinated less than a month after and leadership fell to the more radical and republican, George Lansbury, who permitted the Syndicalist Party of Great Britain (SPGB) to formally affiliate to Labour. Tensions would rapidly rise throughout 1924, culminating in the British Revolution and with it, the de jure banning of the Labour Party though it continued to function unimpeded in rebel territories and formed the political core of the revolutionary movement and later government.\n\nFollowing the conclusion of the British Revolution, Labour now formed the centre of the new political scene and was by and far, the dominant party. The former membership of the SPGB had been absorbed into Labour during the civil war, following the former's banning, with this new \"syndicalist\" faction exerting an outsized degree of influence on the trade union movement, and consequently the Labour Party. An issue of affiliation emerged where-in the Independent Labour Party - formally the de facto parliamentary wing of the Labour Party sought to contest elections as a semi-independent force in its own right owing to this shift in the main party. This was permitted, on the basis they ran in a semi-electoral pact, and the ILP began the process of detaching itself though it would not formally disaffiliate until the 1930s. Labour consequently won a majority in the 1926 general elections to the newly reorganised TUC and formed a coalition government with the ILP under the leadership of Arthur Cook.\n\nThe party continued to absorb smaller left-wing groups throughout the 1920s though its political dominance was challenged in the early 30s following the death's of Cook and Wheatley, leading to the disaffiliation of the ILP. Tom Mann became the party leader following Cook's death and steered it through the tumultuous years that followed, culminating in the 1932 Parliamentary Crisis that officially transformed Britain into a dominant-party state under Labour rule. The party would absorb much of the defunct ILP, some radical liberals and Oswald Mosley's Popular Revolution Party across by 1933. As of 1935 it remains the largest party in the Federal Congress and in all Regional Assemblies and is set to dominate the upcoming 1936 elections.\n\nStructure[]\n\nDespite the appearance of being a \"party\" Labour has largely kept true to its roots of operating as a broad federation of left-wing bodies. While individual membership is available, broadly speaking members are drawn upon from affiliate groups. These traditionally take the form of one of three types organisations: political parties organising under Labour, socialist societies that form more intellectual strands and special interest groups and trade unions that largely form the rank-and-file membership along with the congressional membership. Other types of affiliates exist, for example the Young Syndicalist League or the Council of Regions, but these are rare and usually fill some sort of special niche. At the most basic level, members are organised into geographically divided Branch Labour Parties that are organised along Provincial Lines. These then coalesce into a devolved Regional Labour Party that oversees and organises all activity in its Region and focuses on Regional administrations. Above this, sits the Congressional Labour Party - comprised of those members who sit in the Federal Congress - which is overseen by the National Executive Committee, the overarching party executive, selected by the lower levels of the party.\n\nDue to the broad and federal nature of the Labour Party, factionalism is rife an has existed since its foundational beginnings. Factions are usually tied to individual personalities and the loyalties they instil but can at times be also linked to geography and sometimes even ideology. Broadly speaking, as of 1935, the Labour Party can be divided into five over-arching factions:\n\nThe Federationists - The largest of the five, and nominally the most powerful, the Federationists broadly refer to the party's 'centrists' and left-wing elements that support a maintenance of the federal and syndicalist system. Internally they are heavily atomised into multiple sub-factions and other cliques based on ideology or personal loyalty, though this latter allows the Federationists to command much of the rank-and-file trade union vote and their old guard leadership.\n\nThe Autonomists - An often shifting faction sitting in the centre of the party, the Autonomists trace their lineage back to the left-wing defectors from the ILP - the \"32'ers\" - and have since evolved to encompass the more devoted Christian Socialists within Labour and much of its more hard-line pacifist elements. An eclectic faction forged around Centrist Marxism and Guild Socialism alongside Christian Socialism and Co-Operatism, it has likewise come to welcome regionalist movements and left-wing rural activism into its ranks, creating a generally progressive and Christian-inspired political force focused on political liberalisation and decentralisation.\n\nThe Parliamentarians - The last redoubt of \"Old Labour\", the Parliamentarians uphold Labour's social democratic tradition, from within the mainstream party and notably advocate for the restoration of a \"parliamentary house\", replacing federalism with political centralism and the further introduction of Keynesian thinking into the economy. Despite being seen as the \"right\" of Labour, the Parliamentarians themselves are split internally between rightward, leftward and centrist flanks. Likewise, their name is not a reference to their support for Parliamentarianism in itself but rather from the term \"Parliamentary Labour\", a phrase adopted by more moderate Labour Party congress members in the Provincial Parliament, after the ILP had formally split from Labour proper, though the term was adopted by TUC members as well.\n\nThe Maximists - The informal name given to the ideological followers of Oswald Mosley, regardless of whether they belong to the New Labour Association, the Maximists advocate for political centralisation, authoritarianism, state control of the economy and \"maximum devotion to the revolution\" by both the people of Britain and the state itself. Relatively small in contrast to the other cliques and far more tight knit, being centred around a single organisation, the Maximists project outsized power owing to their influence in the cabinet and Mosley's own personal charisma though despite its outward appearance, internal dissent does abound.\n\nThe Vanguardists - The smallest and nominally weakest faction, though like the Maximists they cast a long shadow, the Vanguardists are a mixture of the old guard Leninist-inspired Marxists of the British Socialist Party and a younger generation that desires a more hard-line revolutionary course in syndicalist fashion. Initially powerful in the pre-Revolution SPGB, their influence has long waned and they largely survive of the patronage of orthodox Federationists, both united in their opposition to the \"dilution\" of revolutionary militancy, instead favouring a more narrowly ideological Labour Party acting as the revolutionary vanguard, hence their name.\n\nSocial Democratic Party[]\n\nA relative latecomer, to the British political stage, the Social Democratic Party is a moderate left-wing party that can trace its mixed heritage to a variety of sources across the Labour Party and its affiliates. Splintering off from both mainstream Labour and the Independent Labour Party in 1932, its emergence was overshadowed by the 1932 Provincial Crisis, which was also a factor in its creation. As the most 'rightward' party in the TUC and the only national party to hold seats in the Federal Congress outside of the Labour Party, it serves as the official opposition to the government.\n\nBackground[]\n\nThe primary origins of the Social Democratic Party can be found within the Independent Labour Party, the forerunner to the Labour Party and its affiliate turned rival. While traditionally on the left of (mainstream) Labour, the ILP had gradually found itself drifting more towards the right of the main party following the Revolution, which had grown increasingly radical after absorbing (and being overtaken by) elements of the Syndicalist Party of Great Britain. The ILP itself had a powerful left-wing, the Wheatleyites, and had enjoyed considerable influence owing to Wheatley's position in government. In opposition, were the right-wing Snowdenites, that had more in common with the Liberal Party, and though weak at first, they decisively took control of the party following Wheatley's death in 1930. The precursor to the SDP within the ILP was centred around the XYZ Club, a socialist intellectual group founded by H.V. Berry and Nicholas Davenport in 1930, initially to provide \"financial intelligence\" to the ILP and attract socialist intellectuals. The group was quickly overtaken by Hugh Dalton, a member of the Moderate faction of the Labour Party, and Hugh Gaitskell was made its secretary. Initially an informal club, the group had ambitions for lobbying the ILP (and Labour) leadership on pursuing its financial proposals. Within the ILP, it received a mixed reception as the left of the party while interested, had, according to their new leader James Maxton, \"no interest in getting tied up in the arithmetic of it all.\" On the right of the party, there was indeed more interest and support but Philip Snowden, the now uncontested leader of the party, was bitterly opposed as he regarded the club's devotion to Keynes and state interventionism as a repudiation of his own Gladstonian views on economics. Despite this hostility, the Club did attract some members and served as one of the final remaining branches between the ILP and Labour membership in the waning days of the early 30s.\n\nFormation & Policy[]\n\nWIP\n\nWIP\n\nWIP\n\nWIP\n\nRural Party[]\n\nA minor and oft-forgotten party in the British political scene, the Rural Party is a minor political party in the Union of Britain. In its current form, the party was formed in 1928 though this was a revival of its previous iteration from 1908. The Party holds no seats in either the TUC or the Federal Assembly, though it does hold some seats at the Regional and Municipal level. Nominally positioned to the centre of politics, the party's decentralised nature has led to many local branches diverging from the official party line.\n\nOrigins[]\n\nThe Rural Party's origins lie in its de facto pre-Great War predecessor, the proposed Independent Agriculture Parliamentary Party. The idea of a political party dedicated to rural affairs first emerged in the May of 1907 when, on the urging of the Staffordshire Chamber of Agriculture, the Central Chamber of Agriculture consulted other constituent Chambers on the creation of an agricultural party. Many of these Chambers adopted the proposal and in November, the resolution was further debated with considerable support for the creation of a separate party. Liberal MP and land reformer, Jesse Collins, supported the motion and it was broadly agreed that farmers required \"independent representation\" in parliament. Despite the interest, internal opposition in the Central Chamber led to plans to form an Agricultural Party being blocked and the proposals were eventually stalled. The NFU endorsed various Agriculturalist candidates at the 1919 elections but these were not strictly affiliated to the previous proposals and members were usually also endorsed by their local Conservative and Unionist association.\n\nA revival of interest emerged in 1923 at the behest of Christopher Turnor, a prominent agriculturalist, architect and social reformer with interests in affairs pertaining to the land. At a meeting of the Grantham Farmers' Union in South Lincolnshire, Turnor declared that a \"new party to represent the interests of agriculture\" was needed in light of the ongoing economic recession. Amid considerable interest within Lincolnshire, Turnor began to contact other leading agriculturalists about his intentions and news of the plan spread. But this ultimately killed it before it could begin, as the National Farmers' Union was explicitly opposed to any \"rural party\" that might undercut its influence. At a meeting in Exeter, the NFU's vice-president, Rowland Richard Robbins, outlined his opposition on the basis that \"maximum production and maximum employment were mutually exclusive with good farming.\" Likewise, he rejected the suggestion that landowners, labourers and farmers should unite under a single banner and felt any party that attempted to organise as such was \"doomed to failure.\" The NFU refused any support for the venture and even threatened to expel members who participated with it, leaving Turnor's ambitions to go dormant for the next five years.\n\nFoundation & Emergence (1927 - 1928)[]\n\nFollowing the Revolution and the societal upheaval that encompassed it, a new political scene rapidly emerged and this led to renewed interest for an agrarian party. The traditional political vehicle for rural interests, the Conservative Party, was now defunct and the Liberal Party, while experimenting with a pivot towards rural issues, remained a minor party after its pre-revolution decline had rapidly accelerated. Politics now centered principally around the Labour Party, which was more concerned with the plight of industrial workers and reconstruction of Britain's urban industrialised economy following the civil war. while the National Union of Agricultural Workers was the most leftward flank of rural interests, its primary representation was concerned with labourers as opposed to farmers, only slowly making the efforts to integrate smallholders throughout the 1920s. The political vacuum in rural politics combined with genuine worries that rural and agricultural issues would be ignored turned speculative interest into genuine activism. There was no agriculturalist presence in the 1926 General Elections though 17 independent 'Agriculturalists' ran for the Provincial Parliament and 3 successfully contested seats. Numerous Agriculturalist candidates successfully ran for the 1927 Regional Elections, often sponsored by local farmer clubs and agricultural chambers or other similar organisations that had emerged in the countryside.\n\nIn early 1926, Montague Fordham, a barrister by profession and agriculturalist by interest, established the Rural Reconstruction Association as a pressure group and agricultural reform movement that advocated for increased focus on rural areas. Fordham and his followers believed that the Ministry of Reconstruction, under Frank Wolstencroft, was unfairly focusing on more urbanised towns and cities as opposed to the countryside. Heavily inspired by Guild Socialism, and to a lesser extent social credit, Fordham and the RRA sought the creation of a \"National Agricultural Guild\" with land ownership held by democratically elected \"land councils\" who would operate as local sections of the National Guild. Via this, Fordham hoped to revive agriculture, countryside-living, balance industrial and agricultural output and ultimately to decentralise the population of Britain. By the end of the yearr, the RRA had developed a sizeable following, particularly made up of discontented farmers that were struggling in the post-Revolution slump. It began to publish its own magazine, Rural Economy, of which Jorian Jenks was an early contributor and later editor, and sponsored 24 of the \"Agriculturalist\" candidates for the 1927 Regional Elections in England, primarily focused around the Midlands. By the end of 1927, the RRA had swelled into a national movement that had since moved on beyond simply advocating rural reconstruction but towards an overhaul of the monetary system, large-scale land reform and agricultural autarky for all nations as a means of avoiding soil erosion. Under Jenks' influence, the RRA began to embrace organic farming and was, for a time, at the forefront of the organic movement in Britain though it never fully diverted from its Guild Socialist agrarianism.\n\nFollowing an early success in the 1927 Regional elections, it was agreed that a new \"agricultural party\" was necessary to represent smallholders, labourers and collectivised tenant farmers. While the Rural Reconstruction Association had served as an early avenue for organising rural interests, it was not ideal in the long-term as Fordham and his followers desired large-scale, fundamental changes to British society and the economic system at large. In contrast, the new rural class were more focused on securing their immediate interests in the new agricultural economy and securing immediate solutions to the ongoing countryside slump. The need and desire for an independent agrarian party that could lobby on \"practical\" issues regarding rural affairs, and for the countryside in general, culminated in the Louth Conference in the summer of 1928. Approximately 270 delegates from various farmer clubs, agricultural societies and co-operatives met in the Lincolnshire market town of Louth, with the NUAW sending members as observers, to discuss the formation of a new \"agriculturalist party\" and what direction it should take. The motion to found such a party was endorsed by a majority vote and a second conference was scheduled for August. The party was officially founded in Coningsby, Lincolnshire, by Herbert Matthews and John Hammond, who were named party Secretary and President respectively. Hammond was a Cambridge academic with the School of Agriculture and Matthews was a leading agriculturalist who had served as secretary for the long-defunct National Agricultural Union and later the for the Central Chamber of Agriculture. Mr George Cooper, a Warwickshire farmer and agricultural writer, was declared the party treasurer.\n\nRichard Winfrey, a Liberal Member of Parliament and the former Treasurer of the National Union of Agricultural Workers, donated Â£100 to the Party to cover its early expenses and the party rapidly expanded. The Central Chamber's of Agriculture had been devastated by the revolution and had only barely survived by forming into local farmer clubs rather than a nationwide lobbying group, though following the formation of the Rural Party, practically all CCA's transitioned into becoming Rural Party branches. Interest was immediate and under Matthews' urging, an affiliate trade union - the National Association of Smallholders, Retailers & Allied Workers - was founded as a means of organizing its members for national elections. Cooper resigned as party treasurer to become the General Secretary for the NASRAW and the Treasury posting was given to W. E. Thompson. Relations with the NUAW were cordial - with Hammond helping organise a meeting between the Rural Party leadership and the NUAW Executive Council in the Autumn. An unofficial electoral pact was agreed upon in which NASRAW and NUAW candidates would not contest each other and the NUAW would, when expedient, give its endorsement to Rural Party candidates. A particular point of contention was the province of Norfolk, a NUAW a stronghold and one dominated by left-wing agricultural workers, though Matthews agreed that Ruralist candidates would \"not interfere with your natural tending grounds.\" In exchange, the NUAW agreed not to stand candidates in Shropshire, the de facto base of the Rural Party. Matthews was enthusiastic about such cooperation and was hopeful that it would herald the eventual merger of the NASRAW and NUAW into a single organisation placing \"the interests of land on equal par with industry.\" Offices were soon established in Westminster Palace Gardens for its \"National Headquarters\" though the Shrewsbury District Branch office de facto functioned as the most important branch.\n\nFollowing its formation, the party did not take an official stance on the ongoing Free Trade debate, nor publish any statements on the Five-Year Plan beyond calling for more funding for rural areas. At an early function, Hammond declared the Party was opposed to the Gold Standard as it was hurting British exports but would otherwise remain outside of the debate. In the November of 1928, Matthews set out the legislative programme for the party:\n\nThe maximum economic production from the maximum employment on the land.\n\nA guaranteed living wage and better conditions of life for the rural worker.\n\nThe unfettered organisation of agriculture, its workers and its allied industries.\n\nState protection for the livelihood of the rural worker.\n\nThe equal treatment between collective tenants and independent rural workers\n\nA flourishing agriculture, which means prosperity to every rural dweller.\n\nWhile the party referred to itself as \"centrist\" and above partisan politics, its leadership under Matthews certainly leaned more leftwards. At a national level, the party leadership keenly advocated for more leftward causes encompassing a general improvement of the rural standard of living and otherwise advocating for more focus on rural affairs in economic planning. However, owing to the party's decentralised nature, at a branch level local members had a fair degree of autonomy in pursuing their own agendas which at times led to disjoint between the national and district leadership. This was intended to allow branches to tailor programmes to their local communities but led to concerns it was being abused by disenfranchised Conservatives to organise with a veil of legitimacy. Matthews publicly dismissed the allegations his party was a \"Tory half-breed\" but did acknowledge that he could not vet everyone who joined. J.A. Hobson complained the party was \"honeycombed with all strange sorts and blue-rosetted cranks,\" and, in a private letter to Matthews, Hammond complained that the party's Northumberland branch was \"very strange and obsessed with honey.\" As a means of cleaning it's image, Cooper invited the incumbent Minister for Agriculture, Noel Buxton, to a Rural Party sponsored event, in October, at the Harper Adams college. Buxton attended and spoke positively of the Party but could make no promises of the government sparing additional funds for depressed rural provinces.\n\nConsolidation & Controversy (1929 - 1932)[]\n\nWIP WIP\n\nBritish Communist Party[]\n\nWIP WIP\n\nThe Affiliation Debate[]\n\nWIP WIP\n\nPankhurst's Party (1924 - 1928)[]\n\nWIP WIP\n\nDominance of the Marxian League (1929 - 1934)[]\n\nWIP WIP\n\nRidley's Rump (1934 - Present)[]\n\nWIP WIP\n\nRegional Political Parties[]\n\nMain article: Regional Parties (Union of Britain)\n\nWIP\n\nWIP\n\nWIP\n\nWIP\n\nWIP\n\nWIP\n\nRegional Political Parties[]\n\nScottish Workers Republican Party[]\n\nA small and largely moribund outfit operating in Scotland, the Scottish Workers Republican Party was the second political venture of John Maclean, though like his turncoat Scottish Syndicalist Party, it made little waves on the British political scene. After a stunted start, the party saw interest during the civil war and in the 1928 Independence Referendum but went into a period of decline thereafter and currently contests few seats in Scotland. It mostly serves as an intellectual society but does have a small political footprint in the few regional council and TUC seats it controls and holds ties to Labour's Vanguardists.\n\nMaclean formed the party in 1923 with John Ball and Edward Rennie, two Scottish socialists who would both go on to serve as leaders of the party. Little is known of its origins or founding congress due to a lack of records left behind though it is known it attempted to contest some seats in the 1924 General Election. Scottish syndicalist and future Scottish Chairman, Harry McShane commented that it 'had some queer people that I didnât like â they had never been to Johnâs economics classes, they knew nothing about socialism or revolutionary work.' Indeed many of Maclean's colleagues who had left him for the SPGB were suspicious of the SWRP and its membership. The party largely faded into the background following its establishment, living in the shadow if the far more successful SPGB but it did build a small core of dedicated membership. James Maxton, another Scottish socialist, claimed that the SWRP struggled as 'syndicalist activists that wished to see a socialist and independent Scotland as John did either joined the SPGB or worked with the Home Rule organisations. The Scottish Republicans didn't offer much the others couldn't and be better at.'\n\nMaclean had drifted from syndicalism following his abandoning of the SSP and instead realigned himself with revolutionary Marxism and Leninism. The experiments with council communism in France became of particular attraction to him and he used it as an example of how an independent Scottish state could organise, comparing it to the Clan system. The party grew slowly and with fortunes that waxed and waned until the explosion of the civil war generated a slew of new interest. Maxton commented that even though new members flooded the party, Maclean and the Central Committee maintained an 'iron-fisted domination' of party affairs, directing it in all matters on policy but it did help the nationalist cause in mobilising worker militias and providing the intellectual basis for an independent Scottish state. Maclean brought the party to prominence thanks to his presence in the Scottish Provisional Congress and his constant activism though his sudden death decapitated the party's efforts, especially as nationalist leadership fell to the future party leader and more anti-partisan R.B. Cunninghame Graham. In the aftermath of Maclean's death, the Central Committee elected the Glasgow labourer and less effective, John Ball, to head up the party. Ball proved to be a fervent ideologue and defender of Maclean's legacy, causing the party's interest to decline as it attempted to take on a more narrow view and the nationalist political scene dispersed.\n\nHowever, the party's fortunes did revive in 1928 when the nationalist political scene saw a common rise in interest. Left-wing nationalists sought to align around a common organisation and the SWRP appeared to adequately fill that role, even more-so when Graham successfully challenged Ball's leadership and opted to open the party up to increased membership. In protest, Ball led a small breakaway of the original members to found the short-lived and fiercely ideological Scottish Workers Party. While the small SWP floundered and quickly faded into obscurity, the SWRP under Graham's leadership became the main party of left-wing Scottish nationalism and was one of the two founding constituent parties for the future NPS, which Graham also led. Under the NPS, the SWRP peaked in membership and influence, becoming a major nationalist party in Scotland but it never-the-less remained opaque with Graham constantly clashing with the rump Central Committee that remained loyal to Ball and Macleanist ideology. Additionally, following the failure of a Nationalist victory to materialise, the party saw its membership decline again and was only able to briefly sustain itself due to an influx of members from the defunct SNL though many of these would leave later on as part of a general exodus.\n\nWith Graham undergoing repeat imprisonment, his grasp on the battle gradually loosened and by the spring of 1929, the party had absorbed the SWP. Ball and other original founders formed the basis of the party's 'Macleanist' faction which sought to oust Graham and return the party to its ideological routes. Ball had never forgiven Graham for expelling him and along with Peter McIntyre, Thomas McGregor and Edward Rennie, he schemed to have Graham removed In a vote of no confidence triggered by McGregor on the Central Committee, Graham lost 4-3 and was ejected from the party, and replaced with Edward Rennie. Graham condemned the move but formally left politics and the SWRP began an internal purge of removing Graham loyalists and 'syndicalist agitators'. The party entered another period of decline where it gradually faded into obscurity.\n\nIt is a common held belief that the party largely collapsed and disappeared following Graham's ousting but this would deny evidence to the contrary. While the party has made little real impact, it the SWRP has actually fought several elections since Graham's ousting and been heavily involved in Scottish anti-syndicalist agitation from a Leninist perspective. The 'Claymore Communists' as they have been dubbed by the local press, largely stagnated away from elections into forming more of an intellectual society for pro-Leninist and communist discussion. Today the party largely functions at a local level in Glasgow and professes a Marxist and Leninist approach to politics, while condemning syndicalism. It is alleged to maintain ties to the fringe Vanguardist faction of Labour.\n\nScottish Progressive Party[]\n\nWIP\n\nScottish National Party[]\n\nWIP\n\nPlaid Cymru[]\n\nPlaid Cymru, officially Plaid Genedlaethol Cymru (The National Party of Wales) and sometimes erroneously referred to as the NPW, is a fringe regionalist party in Wales. While both the Labour and Liberal parties of pre-Revolution Britain had accommodated demands for Welsh home rule, no political party existed for the purpose of establishing a Welsh government. Talks to form such a group begin as early as late 1923 but were put on hold due to the British Civil War which itself gave rise to a latent Welsh regionalist tendency. Finally, on 5 August 1926 the party was founded by Moses Gruffydd, H. R. Jones and Lewis Valentine, members of Byddin Ymreolwyr Cymru (\"The Home Rule Army of Wales\"); and Fred Jones, Saunders Lewis and David John Williams of Y Mudiad Cymreig (\"The Welsh Movement\"). The party did not participate in the Constitutional Convention, though sent Valentine and Williams as observers. Initially, home rule and independence was not an explicit aim of the new movement; keeping Wales Welsh-speaking took primacy, with the aim of making Welsh the only official language of Wales. It was believed that once this was achieved, then home rule would be an inevitability. While the party remained small in its early years, it won three seats to the Welsh Regional Parliament in its first elections, taking some council seats thereafter.\n\nThe events of 1928 horrified the party and its president, Saunders Lewis, opted to re-establish the WHRA as a secretive paramilitary wing. Its purpose was double in that it would defend Wales' autonomy but also raise awareness of its regionalism. Despite it being a Welsh-centric project, the group's low-level bombings and arsons began to attract disenchanted loyalists. The party only narrowly avoided being banned in 1932 due to its low profile nature though Lewis was briefly arrested before being released without charge. Lewis' growing support for authoritarian and conservative regimes compromised the party and ultimately led to suspicion, though a sort of 'diarchy' emerging with him as president, and the more moderate Lewis Valentine as premier, saw it manage to escape the worst excesses of political repression. Currently the party has a limited but growing influence in Wales, predominately in the North and in town and regional councils.\n\nPlaid Ryddfrol Newydd[]\n\nPlaid Ryddfrol Newydd, also referred to as the New Liberal Party, is one of the Union's more recent political parties, having only been founded in 1930. The party's origins lie in the already autonomous Welsh Liberal Party which for the most part carried on into the Union but was somewhat side-lined in the new political scene. The left wing Clement Davies became the main figure in this movement following the disgrace of David Lloyd George, and his stance allowed the party to keep its head above water. In 1930, following the crackdown on the opposition and Liberals in particular, Clement Davies began to propose breaking up the Liberals into constituent parties that would be grouped under a single national executive so as to organise better on the local level. Party leader Herbert Samuel took interest in this proposal though many of the Constitutionalists in exile and still at home opposed this measure. Ultimately the Welsh Liberals 'seceded' from the main party though some on the right of the party split, forming the Welsh Liberals. Liberal Davies' PRN was perhaps the most successful Liberal party in Britain, managing to claw back some seats in 1931 and was spared the purges of 1932. The PRN continues as a small and obscure outfit in Wales but a respectable liberal alternative in local politics.\n\nBanned Political Parties[]\n\nLiberal Party[]\n\nThe Liberal Party of the Union of Britain established itself when its predecessor, the British Liberal Party, splintered over the issue of the Civil War. Dissident Liberals in the National Government (and some opposed to it) began to call for an end to the fighting and immediate negotiations which forced them under increasing suspicion. The Liberals had been operating under the leadership of Robert Crewe-Milnes, who allowed the party to gradually drift leftwards and embrace a more economically progressive outlook amid the Great Slump. While the Liberals had joined the National Government, many of them found their loyalties in question amid growing repression and worsening fighting. As the civil war began, a dissident faction of Liberal MPs headed by William Wedgwood Benn with the backing of William Lygon and William Beveridge petitioned the King to dissolve parliament to little avail. By the end of the year, this faction now encompassed much of the mainstream party and Crewe-Milnes led the faction in crossing the floor to oppose the coalition, arguing the government conduct was tyrannical. A splinter wing still loyal to the National Government formed under John Simon, called the National Liberals. The rump Liberal Party found some of its members sympathizing with the rebels. By 1925, the Party splintered for a final time when those tacitly still supporting the government joined the Nationals and a small minority of 'Independent Liberals' sided with the Rebels outright, led by Benn and Beveridge. Following the end of the civil war, the large faction of Liberal MPs that remained in Britain, still under Crewe-Milnes leadership rejoined with the Independent Liberals and the 'new' party was born.\n\nThe party underwent a major reorganisation in 1926 as the party took stock of its remaining assets and which local branches had opted to remain loyal. Rebuilding the party was assigned to its new 'National Organiser' Percy Harris, who began to rebuild it behind the scenes as Crewe-Milnes began preparing for the Constitutional Convention. While there was some suspicion surrounding the Liberals from more hard line Labour members, the incumbent government was thankful for their support of the revolution, and in recognition of such they were granted representation in the Constitutional Convention. This early period for the Liberals represented a resurgence in their fortunes as they were de facto the most 'rightist' party in the legislature leading to the attraction of many disenfranchised conservatives and middle-class voters eager to rejoin the political process. While an initial boon, Harris warned against allowing 'too much rightward influence' into the party and a centre-right wing under the leadership of the previously Tory-aligned Abraham England, gradually formed.\n\nThe early years of the Republic were also a time of ideological consternation for the Liberals, as they sought to set down a new political platform fitting for the new order. The Liberals that had sided with the rebels were broadly pro-republican (pragmatically speaking) and supportive of the new order Labour had built, there was still much debate as to what place the Liberals would have in it. Under Deputy Leader, Herbert Samuel's urging the party began to pivot itself away from the moderate ILP into distinguishing itself as a 'Third Way' Party, that is to say supporting the reestablishment of limited (and 'controlled') capitalism with nationalization of key industries and services. This was primarily seen as a way of reaching out to the old middle (and upper) classes that had not gone into exile but so as to avoid alienating potential working class voters (and the authorities) the Liberals made clear this would take place within the framework of a 'worker focused regime' of capital controls to strike a balance between the two paradigms. Early experiments with market socialism and a focus on 'social justice' featured in these budding proposals. Indeed, the Liberals saw much support in the South of England and parts of Wales, emerging as a capable but cooperative third party.\n\nBelieving that he was unsuited to the new order, some Liberals conspired to have Crewe-Milnes step down as leader (instead serving as the Party Chairman) due to his prior peerage. Crewe-Milnes acquiesced and Samuel was elected leader in 1927, taking a seat in the Provincial Parliament. Samuel became the face of the new Liberals, and was noted for being the first practicing Jew to lead a British political party. A savvy political operator, Samuel further expanded the Liberals program to enshrine federalism and local democracy, placing much emphasis on 'empowering the common man'. Likewise, under his direction the Liberals began to adopt electioneering tactics of Labour and established their own weekly newspaper, Modern Statesman, to complement various nationwide 'Liberal Clubs' acting as informal party societies. Samuel also pushed the party into becoming an expressive supporter of progressive causes and minority rights, particularly Britain's Jews in the face of antisemitic currents that at times ran through society and the press. The party ultimately came to appeal to the new middle class: particularly intellectual and white-collar urbanites and small independent farmers in the countryside. Elsewhere, the party began to develop a program appealing to pacifist sentiment in Britain, calling for reduced military spending on 'international adventurism' and pulling out of international commitments. Samuel's platform argued that Britain should remain neutral and aloof from international conflicts, instead simply focusing on defending her own borders.\n\nThe Liberals parliamentary fortunes waxed and waned until 1932 when it was unceremoniously banned by the Central Intelligence Committee under suspicion of being a politically dangerous and reactionary organisation. The Liberals had been involved in the growing Parliamentary Crisis owing to the so-called Lib-Lab Pact and their rising obstructionism against the militant Mann regime. Samuel had been a vocal opponent of the planned local government reforms, having already opposed the stripping of the Provincial Parliament's ability to propose laws independent of the TUC. Following the ban, Samuel protested the ban and was arrested for sedition. Despite being banned, the Liberal party arguably still functions with its various splinter successors continuing its policies and spirit.\n\nNew Democratic Party[]\n\nWIP\n\nConservative and Unionist Party[]\n\nThe 'Tory' Party and arch-enemy of the socialists. Most of its leadership and higher membership of the pre-revolution Conservative party, fled to Canada and other nations. Despite this, the party was to be the first of the 'Counter-Revolutionary' organisations to be banned, with membership of the Conservatives, or speaking in a manner favourable to it, made a criminal offense. The Conservative Party now only lives on in Canada and among other exile populations in an official capacity, though various underground 'Tory Societies' run by local chairmen, exist in the remote and rural areas of Britain itself despite attempts to stamp these out. Due to the underground nature of the Conservatives there is currently no known central leadership operating in Britain.\n\nWIP\n\nCommittee for the Restoration of Great Britain[]\n\nA relatively recent organisation, the Committee for the Restoration of Great Britain was formed in 1931 on the initiative of the Viscountess Nancy Astor with aid from her husband, Viscount Waldorf Astor. In keeping with its name, its mission is to campaign against the incumbent Union of Britain and a 'restoration' of Great Britain, traditionally acknowledged to be the United Kingdom under the Windsor monarchy though the group has at times diverged on this matter.\n\nThe Anglo-German Fellowship[]\n\nThe CRGB's origins are based in the British Exile community of Continental Europe which had slowly been growing apart from their Imperial counterparts. Disconnected from the wider Exile community and operating in comparatively more authoritarian and radicalised political spheres, the European Exile community began to trend towards more Germanophilic and increasingly conservative tendencies. Amid a melting pot of German business interests, familial relations and political sympathies regarding Germany as the 'last bulwark against socialism' it was in this environment that Lord Mount Temple and Ernest Tennant would found the Anglo-German Fellowship in 1928. Initially established as a pressure group to forge improved Anglo-German relations and preferential treatment for Exiles, it would gradually swell to become the primary Exile organisation for much of Europe, going beyond even Germany and received funding from various German parties.\n\nNational Republican League[]\n\nWIP\n\nDefunct Political Parties[]\n\nDespite its short existence, there have been numerous political parties founded in the course of the Union's history or in some cases related to it that have since been disbanded or wound up by their members. Much of these on the left were ultimately wound up and absorbed into the larger Labour Party, in some cases serving as the revolutionary predecessor such as with the Syndicalist Party of Great Britain. In other cases, particularly in the far-right, these parties were suppressed by Union authorities or have represented periods of disorganised and muddled groupings that served as forerunners to their contemporary successors.\n\nLeft-Wing Parties[]\n\nIndependent Labour Party (1893 - 1932)[]\n\nThe Independent Labour Party, was a British political party of the left, established in 1893 at a conference in Bradford, after local and national dissatisfaction with the Liberals' apparent reluctance to endorse working-class candidates, representing the interests of the majority. A sitting independent MP and prominent union organiser, Keir Hardie, became its first chairman. The original party was banned in 1924 though this was declared illegal and null by the restored British courts, with the party resuming operations in 1926 under the joint leadership of Philip Snowden and John Wheatley.\n\nPre-Revolution (1893 - 1924)[]\n\nThe original ILP was an outgrowth of the mainstream labour movement that had been operating through the use of 'Lib-Lab' candidates, Liberal party candidates that were financially maintained by the trade unions but still supportive of the Liberal Party as a whole. This was opposed by some Marxist ideologues who rejected the idea of workers making common cause with the Capitalist class and so sought to found their own institutions in the SDF. There will still some on the moderate end of the labour movement that were growing frustrated with the reluctance of the Liberals to endorse working-class candidates. A new generation of activists lead by Keir Hardie saw the need for independent labour politics and, with the help of Henry Hyde Champion and Tom Mann, founded the Scottish Labour Party as the first such organisation. This would form the basis of the future party and after the 1892 election in which three 'Independent Labour' MPs were elected, the following year the TUC helped establish the Independent Labour Party proper. Heavy autonomy was given to local branches, and in theory these delegates were the supreme authority, with general leadership granted by the National Administrative Council. This NAC was in turn to be made up of regionally appointed delegates who were in theory confined to act according to the instructions given them by branch conferences. From its beginning, the ILP was never a homogeneous unit, but rather attempted to act as a 'big tent' party of the working class, advocating a rather vague and amorphous socialist agenda, a policy arguably adopted by its syndicalist successor. Nevertheless the electoral defeat of 1895 hastened the establishment of centralising and anti-democratic practices which likewise influenced future politics.\n\nAs the party matured and overcame initial issues such as leadership, relations with trade unions and major defeats it became heavily involved in the establishment of the Labour Representation Committee and when the LRC became the Labour Party, the ILP immediately affiliated. The emergence and growth of the Labour Party, a federation of trade unions with the socialist intellectuals of the ILP, helped its constituent parts develop and grow. In contrast to the Orthodox Marxism of the SDF and its even more orthodox offshoots like the Socialist Labour Party, the ILP had a loose and inspirational flavour that made it relatively more easy to attract newcomers and became a sort of 'secular religion' with a revivalist and Christian Socialist tone. This early ILP also became a means of organisation for non-militant suffragists such as Mary H. J. Henderson and Ethel Snowden. Still, the relationship between the ILP and the Labour Party was characterised by conflict and many ILP branches opted to amalgamate into the BSP in opposition to Labour's moderation.\n\nUntil 1918, individuals could only join the Labour Party through an affiliated body, the most significant of which were the Fabian Society and the ILP. As a result, particularly from 1914, many individuals â particularly ones formerly active in the Liberal Party â joined the ILP, in order to become active in the Labour Party. While affiliated body membership was not required after 1918, the presence of MacDonald and other leading Labour Party figures in the ILP's leadership meant many converts to the Labour Party continued to join through the ILP, a process which continued until about 1926. Around this period, the party was a major opponent to the Great War, owing to its pacifist membership and leadership. Some MPs split from the party but MacDonald remained true and resigned Labour leadership. This pacifism hurt its standing in the public and in 1918, a mob of discharged soldiers broke up an ILP meeting. Indeed, the ILP was the only member of the Second Internationale to oppose the war in a belligerent nation and it ultimately split. While it was not prepared to endorse the Third International, which led to a small breakaway of the 'Left ILP' to support the SPGB, the ILP did join the short-lived 2Â½ International.\n\nAt the 1919 general election several ILP members became MPs and the party grew in stature. The ILP provided many of the new Labour MPs, including James Maxton, John Wheatley, Emanuel Shinwell, Tom Johnston and David Kirkwood. However, the first Labour government, returned to office in 1923, proved to be hugely disappointing to the ILP. This came despite 30% of the cabinet holding ILP membership including the Prime Ministership under Ramsay MacDonald. When the government collapsed by 1924, the ILP sought to develop its own program dubbed the 'Socialism in Our Time' platform, largely formulated by H. N. Brailsford, John A. Hobson and Frank Wise. The programme consisted of eight policies:\n\nThe Living Wage, incompletely applied\n\nA substantial increase of the Unemployment Allowance\n\nThe nationalisation of banking, incompletely applied\n\nThe bulk purchase of raw materials\n\nThe bulk purchase of foodstuffs\n\nThe nationalisation of power\n\nThe nationalisation of transport\n\nThe nationalisation of land\n\nOf these eight policies, the living wage, the unemployment allowance, nationalisation of banking and the bulk purchase of raw materials and foodstuffs were the chief concern of the ILP. These policies caused a major tumult in the Labour Party and arguably led to the split with moderates joining the National Government. R. C. Wallhead resigned as the Party Chair following the electoral defeat and the seat now fell to James Maxton, who appointed his close friends John Wheatley and John Beckett as Deputy Chair and advisor respectively. Despite Beckett's growing affinity for violent militancy, friendship with Oswald Mosley and his influencing by the French theorist, Georges Sorel, he remained an influential figure in this 'triumvirate'. The three men intended to reshape the party's politics to a truly radical course and harness the growing political discontent among the working class though their dreams were ultimately cut short. In 1924, as political tensions began to rise, Maxton and the ILP broadly spoke out in favour of the radicalised TUC and strikers, as well as in support for the general strike. When fighting broke out in earnest, Maxton attempted to call a vote on the abolition of the monarchy and spoke in support of the strikers leading to his arrest on the floor of the house as well as for all other ILP members present, for sedition. The National Government promptly banned the ILP along with multiple other organisations and those Labour members not affiliated with the ILP were viewed with suspicion. For the war, the organisation largely steeped into a dormant underground as its members organised through Labour proper and the renegade TUC.\n\nPost-Revolution (1926 - 1930)[]\n\nIn the post-revolution period, the party was re-legalised with its banning declared null. Likewise, Wheatley (who had been the Provisional Government's Deputy Chair but operating through Labour) had never recognised the banning and so the ILP returned into existence. Nevertheless it did suffer a stunt in membership as rank-and-file members among other high profile figures left for other left-wing bodies. This new atmosphere saw a shift in the political paradigm as the ILP was now theoretically to the right of mainstream Labour as a whole and in turn, a growing membership of more moderate Fabian-influenced figures and rightist Labourites took up places in the party as well as radical Liberals. Indeed, the ILP had all but absorbed much of the straggling right-wing of Labour that did not wish to associate with the mainstream party's moderates. Leadership had fallen to John Wheatley during the civil war owing to Maxton's imprisonment, with Maxton returning to a position on the NAC following his rescue and the party's reorganisation by Wheatley..\n\nTwo distinct wings emerged, with Wheatley and Maxton leading the 'left' of the party in the form of the revolutionary loyalist 'Clydeside Clique' and Philip Snowden heading up the 'right' of the party which seeked to reorient the party back to its revivalist and more moderate roots. Snowden emphasised this through his concept of the 'Post-Revolution Evolution', in which the Union would become a 'social republic' as opposed the 'syndicalist workers' state' that was being advanced by Arthur McManus and the Six Revolutionary Periods Theory. Likewise, in opposition to McManus, Snowden rejected the idea that the 'revolutionary Popular Front' of the Third Period would amalgamate into a single body of one mind but that instead the Labour Party should to disband itself into smaller, ideologically narrow parties in the framework of a cooperative and pluralistic democracy. The Clydesiders endorsed neither and instead sought to take a Centrist position in advicatubg tge maintenance of the Labour federation to consolidate the revolutionary holdings, permit dialogue between the 'sections of labour' and promote socialism while still permitting for a democratic system.\n\nThis period for the ILP was much akin to its early organising history where in the NAC was largely defanged and the party sought to ensure heavy autonomy for its newly organised regional branches. The branches were so autonomous that it can be argued that it ultimately became two moderately distinct parties. In the North and particularly in Scotland, the Clydeside Clique of Wheatley and Maxton had come to sympathise with the syndicalist cause and served as the 'intellectual arm' of the unions in Labour, rooted in more Centrist Marxism as opposed to the growing dominance of sole syndicalist rule and it remained split over the issue of regionalism and Scottish nationalism. In the South, Snowden's ILP took on a distinctive moderate tone, emphasising Christian Socialism and 'independent labour politics' for those workers and voters still not trusting of orthodox socialism. Snowden's branch came to dominate the regional assemblies in the East Anglia and the South West and gave the party much support from the previously disenfranchised Southern England. The ILP once again became a major power in politics with Wheatley becoming the Head of Government and Maxton the President of the Board of Education.\n\nHowever, this period of immense political clout came to an abrupt end following Wheatley's death in 1930 and the party began a slow period of decline afterwards. Tom Mann's government sought to embrace the orthodox syndicalist 'Mannist' ideology and subscribed to the Revolutionary Periods theory which saw many ILPers lose their places in the cabinet. Maxton failed to secure the Chairmanship of the NAC as much of the more radical Clydesiders had been siphoned to either mainstream syndicalist bodies in Labour or the nascent Scottish nationalist movement. Additionally, the growing Christian Socialist movement in the ILP saw the emergence of Fenner Brockway, a potential Wheatley successor, as a potent third candidate who split the radical vote. Ultimately, Philip Snowden took control of the party.\n\nSnowden's Labour (1930 - 1932)[]\n\nPhilip Snowden had secured victory in the leadership race though his tenure as leader marked the decisive decline of the party and its alienation to revolutionary loyalists who largely left to pursue other ventures or sought to use their ILP membership to climb within Labour proper. Notables such as Maxton, Kirkwood and Ellen Wilkinson sought to organise within Labour proper and gradually disassociated from the ILP whereas Beckett, who had been focusing on his nascent political venture in the PRP, opted to formally leave the party, taking some members with him. The remaining rump ILP largely conferred itself to Snowden's idea of Evolutionary Socialism and shifted more towards social democracy as an ideological tenet. Likewise, the party began to associate more with the Liberals, who Snowden still held sympathies for and felt would be key towards the cementing of his ideas of a pluralist democracy.\n\nWith the growing rift with mainstream Labour, Snowden feared the ILP would be relegated to a 'marginal fringe group' as had happened to the rump Fabian Society that had opted to remain with Labour proper as opposed to be absorbed by the ILP. To maintain an ILP presence in politics and crucially ensure the presence of a social democratic party, he sought another attempt at engineering Labour's dismantlement by appealing to the moderate right flank of the party and to Mann himself. Snowden and Mann personally liked each other and enjoyed their shared company, though their politics had rapidly grown apart overtime, particularly as Snowden called on Mann to dismantle Labour and head up a smaller and wholly syndicalist party. Mann, who subscribed to the Revolutionary Periods theory rejected the proposal and questioned the ILP's commitment to the revolution. Consequently, at the start of 1931 Snowden disaffiliated the ILP from Labour and sought to contest the upcoming elections as an independent organisation, sparking a wave of members abandoning the party for good, most notably Fenner Brockway. Many of these figures went on to form the Christian Worker's Association. By this time, the party was wholly under Snowden's control and began to pursue a line of Gladstonian economic thinking, rejecting Labour's Keynesian-influenced syndicalism.\n\nFor the 1931 election, the ILP saw it's membership of the TUC plummet as it struggled to penetrate into the pre-established and already politically aligned unions. However, it remained a potent force in the Provincial Parliament and on a regional level, falling just behind Labour's plurality. At it's 1931 conference, Snowden argued that the party should seek to focus on establishing a grassroots movement on the shop floor to re-enter the TUC while also establishing its holdings elsewhere. Nevertheless, the ILP remained a force to be reckoned with owing to its ability to potentially scupper legislation that still had to pass a majority in the upper chamber. Indeed, it was for this reasoning that Snowden accused the 1931 (Provincial) Parliamentary Reform Act a 'blatant attack on pluralism' as it would prevent the upper chamber from promulgating its own legislation. In the TUC, Mann (an opponent of parliamentarianism) contended that this power granted the upper chamber to theoretically create and then rubber-stamp legislation without TUC oversight and that producing legislation should be the duty of labour representatives. Snowden contended this was tyranny and was but an attempt to defang the other parties. Indeed, Snowden would actively seek out cooperation with the other parties from this moment onwards and officially established the 'Lib-Lab Bloc' in the Federal Congress, with the smaller NDP as their reluctant collaborators.\n\nThe emergence of the Lib-Lab Pact in the Provincial Parliament sparked worry in the mainstream Labour Party but excitement in the ILP, as Snowden now felt they had a legitimate chance of returning to power. The party generated some new interest and some opportunistic Liberals defected to the party in the hopes that they could further advance their careers inside of it. Though by this time, the ILP was largely on the outskirts of politics and only returned to major relevancy during the 1932 Parliamentary Crisis. After 1931, the Lib-Lab Pact had become increasingly obstructionist, using the ability of the upper chamber to return bills to the TUC repeatedly, as it maintained a small majority when all members voted accordingly, only further bolstered by reluctant NDP votes. This grew to be an increasing issue for Labour and Mann who was finding himself beholden to the ILP and the Liberals lest they stop. Fears this obstructionism could eventually become a blanket practice, allowing the ILP to hold the legislative process hostage, came to a head when the Pact blocked the much contested 1932 Local Government (Reform) Act. Rarely employed beforehand, the Lib-Lab-Ind Bloc voted to reject the bill entirely, giving the TUC, Mann and the new Deputy Chair, Oswald Mosley, the impetus to vote to suspend the upper chamber. Snowden physically protested the vote on the TUC floor (of which he was a member) but was promptly arrested and a supplementary bill, the 1932 Proscribed Organisations Act, banned the ILP.\n\nIn the aftermath, those ILP members that attempted to protest the bill were likewise charged for membership of a proscribed organisation and sedition, causing much of the membership to abandon the party. Many of its TUC members (and parliamentarians) opted to join Labour and become known as the '32ers, whereas the right flank of the party gravitated towards Liberal successor organisations or Hugh Dalton's soon-to-be established Social Democratic Party. Unlike both the Liberals and the NDP, the ILP's party apparatus largely faded away and any attempts to reform at the sub-federal level, as those parties experienced, ended in failure. By 1933, any traces of the ILP had disappeared.\n\nSyndicalist Party of Great Britain (1921 - 1924)[]\n\nFirst formed as a merger of smaller socialist parties in 1921, the Syndicalist Party of Great Britain (SPGB) was the shortlived predecessor to the modern Labour Party. While it was not the first syndicalist party in Britain, ideologically or named as such, it was the first that successfully operated on the national scale. Negotiations had already started in 1920 and by 1921 it had absorbed the British Socialist Party, the Socialist Labour Party and the South Wales Socialist Society. The party also gained the support of the Guild Communists faction of the National Guilds League, assorted shop stewards' and workers' committees, socialist clubs and individuals and many former members of the Hands Off Russia campaign. Several branches and many individual members of the Independent Labour Party also affiliated to the growing party. As a member of the British Socialist Party, the Member of Parliament Cecil L'Estrange Malone joined the SPGB at its opening conference. A few days after the founding conference the new party published the first issue of its weekly newspaper, which was called British Syndicalist and edited by Raymond Postgate. The party continued to grow later in the year, soon absorbing Sylvia Pankhurst's group, the Communist Party (British Section of the Third International), and the Scottish Syndicalist Party.\n\nThe initial party formed under the leadership of Albert Inkpin, the prior leader of the British Socialist Party and its opening conferences saw much struggle in the party. One of the major issues for the SPGB was whether to adopt 'parliamentarisnist' tactics and potential affiliation to the Labour Party. At this stage the Labour Party remained less its own political party and more an association of various left-wing organisations even though individual membership had been permitted. However, despite the support of James Maxton, the ILP leader, the Labour Party decided against the affiliation of the Syndicalist Party. Following the refusal of their affiliation, the SPGB opted instead to promote entryist tactics and encouraged its members to join the Labour Party individually to seek Labour Party endorsement or help for any candidatures. This was regarded as an ideal alternative as Labour still permitted multi-party membership and placed no prohibition against Syndicalists. Several Syndicalists thus became Labour Party candidates, and in the 1923 general election, Shapurji Saklatvala and Walton Newbold were both elected. As late as 1923 the National Executive Committee of the Labour Party endorsed Syndicalist parliamentary candidates, and 38 SPGB members attended the 1923 Labour Party Conference as observers.\n\nWith the collapse of the Labour government in late 1923, radicalised socialists swelled the SPGB's growing membership amid an internal struggle in the party. A large coalition of members affiliated with the trade union movement headed by figures such as Arthur Cook and Harry Pollitt believed that the SPGB's strategy should be one of 'boring from within' and seek to utilise the power of pre-existing and well-organised trade unions, with this faction being termed 'Unionists'. Instrumental to this goal were organisations such as Tom Mann's National Minority Movement which sought to convert workers to socialism and as such, these members favoured a more broad approach, wishing to see the SPGB transform into a mass party and mobilising the working classes. The opposing faction, the 'Vanguardists', were primarily comprised of intellectual figures, the BSP old guard and disparagingly 'white-collar communists' as called by Cook; this faction opposing the notion of the mass party and instead wishing for the SPGB to embrace a doctrine that the party should consist of professional revolutionary cadres and not be open to all applicants. This faction was led by figures such as SPGB leader, Albert Inkpin, and other intellectual members such as Rajani Palme Dutt. While initially able to hold some sway over the party doctrine, Inkpin's gradually declining leadership and inability to overcome being outvoted by more mass-inclined party members rendered this strategy ineffective.\n\nFollowing the formation of the National Government, Labour had split and its new leader, the radical George Lansbury, began his leadership by allowing Labour affiliation for the SPGB. Inkpin and the Vanguardists opposed this measure, arguing that the SPGB should seek to work outside the establishment parties. Inkpin attempted to stop a members vote, declaring that the Central Committee had made a binding decision by fiat and this had to be accepted by the rest of the party. Tom Mann and Ben Tillet opposed the measure, with Mann threatening to call a vote of no confidence if a members' vote was not held and respected. Saklatvala, one of the SPGB MPs pressured Inkpin to accept the motion or be forced to resign. Inkpin permitted the motion but resigned the General-Secretary position anyway. Inkpin remained on the Central Committee and sought to head the Central Control Commission, the party's discipliniary wing. Mann was suspicious of this still wanted to force Inkpin out of the Central Committee entirely but was talked out of his plans for an ousting by Tillet who feared that it could split the party. Pollitt made the case to keep Inkpin on the Committee due to his extensive knowledge of the party's secrets and Inkpin was made the National Organiser. Arthur McManus, the incumbent Chairman, was elected as the new General-Secretary and Tillet was elected Chairman.\n\nUnder their direction, McManus and Tillet began to shift the party decisively toward Industrial Unionism and officiated the process of becoming an affiliate. Party members were encouraged to participate in mainstream unions and also lobby within the party, as mainstream Labour experienced a large groundswell of syndicalist support. McManus dubbed this the 'Third Period', alluding that the earlier periods were the First in the form of emerging leftist unity (pre-SPGB) and the Second in the establishment of a united syndicalist party. McManus argued that the 'Fourth Period' in which a united leftist front of Labour and trade unions (the Third Period) would overthrow capital and establish a Communard-esque workers state, which the SPGB would help establish, was now imminent. Unfortunately for McManus, the SPGB was banned as an organisation shortly after the beginning of the civil war and much of its apparatus and membership was absorbed into the Labour Party proper. Some attempts were made to reestablish the party in 1926 as its banning was declared null but this gained little traction as the Labour Party had largely succumbed to syndicalist politics.\n\nPopular Revolution Party (1927 - 1931)[]\n\nThe Popular Revolution Party was a political party briefly active in the Union of Britain in the late 1920s before being dissolved in 1931 and absorbed into Labour. It was formed by Oswald Mosley, then a TUC member, with his friend and ally, John Beckett. Mosley formed the party on his return to Great Britain in 1927, after having briefly left politics due to Labour rejecting his political advances. In soft exile, Mosley had become determined to found his own political movement that he could tightly control with the PRP being the manifestation of this desire. For its existence, the party was affiliated to Labour and until 1930 arguably functioned more as a pressure group within the ILP. It served as the political predecessor to the New Labour Asociation (NULA) and the creation of the Maximist ideology..\n\nMosley had been working on his 'Memorandum' since the 1920s, taking much interest in John Maynard Keynes' economic theories, but only published an expanded version in 1926. With Britain commencing plans for reconstruction and reorganizing the new state along socialist lines, Mosley sought to capitalise on the political vacuum and sought both a position in the Constitutional Convention and to advance his 'Mosley Memorandum'. Still within the ILP, Mosley considered himself an independent actor but was tied to the radicals and revolutionary loyalists of the Clydesiders via ideology and his friend, John Beckett. Likewise, Mosley clashed with fellow party member, Philip Snowden, who in his brief term as the Minister of Finance sought to use interventionist measures only sparingly for reconstruction at the behest of his deputy, Robert Smilie, but otherwise maintain a Gladstonian approach of limited intervention where possible along with financial discipline. Mosley was a harsh critic of this policy and believed the budding state should be the prime actor in rebuilding the economy and beyond. When seeking a candidacy, Mosley published his Memorandum which was split into two parts: the first on rebuilding the economy and the second on reorganising it, though the latter was short and vague in plans. For reconstruction it called for extensive interventionism, deficit spending, full employment via public works and mass nationalisation of industries. The memorandum garnered immense interest with even Arthur Cook agreeing to some of the proposals, and the memorandum to some degree inspired future economic planning. Nevertheless the Chairman went no further than some mild endorsement and the plan was attacked by the powerful syndicalist faction of Labour. Mosley was regarded as too aristocratic and lacking in 'experience' for his plans to carry him through to a candidacy. After being rejected, he left the country to travel the world.\n\nReturning in 1927, Mosley had now been immersed in the budding developmentalist ideologies of other syndicalist off-shoot movements, European economies and plannist economic theories such as those of Henri de Man. Having followed Keynes work closely from abroad, and with renewed vigour, Mosely rekindled his political career and with his friends John Beckett and John Strachey (who he maintained correspondence with from abroad) sought to establish a new political faction within Labour that he felt would strike as a third path between 'Old Labour' and its timid moderation and the radical but economically decentralised orthodoxy of syndicalism. To this end, Mosley sought to establish a new political party to uphold these ideas and promote them within Labour, initially wanting to call it the New Party. Beckett felt this name was 'uninspired' and instead proposed the Popular Revolution Party to both emphasise revolutionary loyalty but also its progressive thinking. Mosley agreed and the party was registered later in the year while seeking Labour affiliate status.\n\nTo end of the year, Mosley published a new edition of the Mosley Memorandum that largely expanded on the ideas of the original, and adapted them to a peace-time economy. Politically the TUC would largely be stripped of its control of the economy and given more general powers while the executive would adopt a presidential system of powers and decrees via Orders-in-Council. Far more emphasis on developmentalism and interventionism with renewed calls for the Ministries of Finance and Labour to be abolished, instead all economic decisions would be handled by a separate Five-Man committee of ministers without portfolio, ran much like the 1916 War Cabinet, that would report directly to the Chairman. The Committee would additionally be advised by a cadre of industry experts, technocrats and a permanent secretary to oversee an entirely separate civil service department responsible to the council. This expanded memorandum was signed by 30 sitting Federal Congress members and Labour notables including Mosley, his wife and fellow Labour MP Lady Cynthia and among others: Oliver Baldwin, Joseph Batey, Aneurin Bevan, W. J. Brown, Robert Forgan, James Lovat-Fraser, John McGovern, John James McShane, Frank Markham, H. T. Muggeridge, Morgan Philips Price, Charles Simmons, James Maxton, Harold Nicolson, Wilfred Risdon, John Beckett and John Strachey.\n\nThe next year, Mosley had been re-ingratiating himself to his old Birmingham home and re-entered the Labour movement. Triggering a recall election for the aviation union, Mosley used his renewed political clout and the Memorandum to sponsor his immediate rise to a seat in the TUC. The PRP saw an immediate burst of interest as the Memorandum was brought back to public light and some TUC members even opted to join. Early party propaganda depicted the party as youthful and forward-thinking amid a stuffy, 'old man's' environment presently in Labour. Using modernist and futurist art, the campaign worked in attracting modern celebrities such as the racing motorist Malcolm Campbell; conductor Reginald Goodall; explorer St. John Philby; aviation pioneer Alliott Verdon Roe; boxer Ted 'the Kid' Lewis and female rally car driver Fay Taylour. Across the nation, the press heaped praise on Mosley as the 'new face of socialism' and Mosley stoked this by forming the militaristic youth-wing: the Popular League of Youth. Older teenagers fraternised with young men and women in their 20s, forming the core of highly motivated and youthful volunteers who would campaign on Mosley's behalf. A small faction of the PLY was taken to one side by England's Rugby Captain, Peter Howard, and turned into the 'Biff Boys' an informal party militia to provide protection at meetings.\n\nThe PRP grew slowly on the left, often attracting members of Labour's right-wing who were attracted to Mosley's syncretic and pragmatic interventionism. Likewise, many feminists, anti-vivisectionists and young people were attracted to the party owing to its progressive credentials which placed it on the left of much of Labour and its socially conservative bent. Ex-suffragettes took on important roles and one-such woman, the Canadian Mary Richardson, headed up the PRP's women's division and was placed in charge of its policy on women's issues. Though despite its immense popularity and the heaps of press coverage it received, the party had a relatively small legislative footprint, only being able to count some 30 TUC members and 10 Provincial MPs to its name with Mosley, his wife Cynthia, John Strachey, Wilfed Risdon, Robert Forgan, Mary Richardson and later John Beckett as forming the main clique of members within the Federal Congress.\n\nIn the Summer of 1929 the party underwent a major reorganisation as Mosley sought to professionalise it in the hopes of turning of turning the PRP into a genuine political party as opposed to simply a pressure group. The informal Biff Boys were reformed into the modern 'Popular Revolutionary Guards', better known as the Blackshirts for their distinctive dress, under the leadership of an ex-constable, Eric Piercy and by 1930, his Deputy, Neil Francis Hawkins. Their uniform was heavily modelled after Mosley's personal fencing uniform and they were to be instructed in basic combat and self-defence while Richardson organised their little-known female wing, the Blackskirts. The PRP's newspaper, New Times was also reorganised and under Harold Nicolson's editorship, it moved away from being a more information-based periodical for party members, to a genuine newsletter that reported on current affairs and provided discussions on political policy. Many prominent figures in the Union were invited to author pieces for the paper. Likewise, Beckett helped establish the Popular Syndicates League, a small and short-lived trade union branch of the movement though it was disbanded by the next year. While the party failed to gain coveted influence in the legislature, its national visibility and influence among the bureaucracy rose considerably, especially in no small part to Mosley's presence in the cabinet, even if in a junior role.\n\nIn 1930, the party experienced another groundswell of support owing to the political tumult in the ILP. Many PRP members had joined Labour through the ILP and remained members as did Mosley and Beckett. Though in Mosley's case (and much of the party) he had largely ignored the ILP's presence for some time and sat as a PRP member. For Beckett, a friend of the ILP titan, John Wheatley, he had remained attached to the ILP and maintained his seat under the ILP while working in a more background capacity. Indeed, Beckett had hoped that the PRP and ILP would eventually merge but with Snowden's takeover of the party, Beckett abandoned the ILP for good. With him, many ILP members followed and the PRP experienced another boost in support even if it remained, at best, a third party influence in the TUC.\n\nNevertheless, the PRP was not to survive for much longer as Mosley became concerned of his political prospects and the future of the PRP as a \"small affiliate on the fringes.\" Recalling his inspirational discussion with Beatrice Webb in the 1920s, at a party conference Mosley proposed that the PRP was inherently hampering itself by remaining on \"the outside of Labour\" and felt that organising as a fringe affiliate party in the same vein as the Co-Operative Party meant that the PRP would forever be locked outside the halls of power. Taking inspiration from the long-running Fabian Society, who's members had long been able to court impressive influence, Mosley began to secretly discuss the possibility of transitioning the PRP to a \"Political Society\" in the vein of Labour's affiliate Socialist Societies. In contrast to his old party in the ILP that had disaffiliated by this point, by 1931 Mosley opted to take the opposite approach and instead wished to integrate further into Labour. The Popular Revolutionary Party as an independent entity was wound up in November of that year and instead Mosley had the new PRP apparatus revolve around the newly established 'Mosleyite' New Labour Association within Labour. After the events of 1932, Mosley had decisively drifted towards more open authoritarianism and planist influences, transforming putting the NULA onto a path of embracing political authoritarianism and totalism as part of a top-down political approach.\n\nRegionalist Parties[]\n\nNational Party of Scotland (1928 - 1931)[]\n\nOrigns[]\n\nScottish nationalism had always existed as a latent tendency in Scottish politics, but truly began to become a force in its own right following the loss of Great Britain in the Weltkrieg. A flurry of Scottish nationalist organisations were founded as once loyal Scotsmen sought to ensure their sons and brothers were never sent into the imperial war machine again. This nationalist tendency was largely ignored despite a wave of Scottish nationalist agitation in the leadup to the civil war during which an outburst of nationalist fury culminated in the shortlived Glaswegian Commune and a powerful nationalist bloc in the provisional congress. Following Scotland's entry in the union in 1925 a referendum on independence had been promised, and by 1926 various nationalist and regionalist organisations began discussing the possibility of establishing a national Scottish party to represent the nation's interests and lobby for independence.\n\nFormation & Graham's NPS[]\n\nThe National Party of Scotland was formed out of these groupings in February of 1928. A month prior, Robert Bontine Cunninghame Graham and John MacCormick merged their respecting organisations: the Scottish Worker's Republican Party and the Glasgow University Scottish Nationalist Association and signed the 'Scottish National Covenant', pledging themselves to the nationalist cause. By February, William Gillies' Scots National League, Lewis Spence's Scots National Movement and the Scottish Home Rule Association were involved in talks and agreed to merge their respective organisations into the National Party of Scotland. Graham was elected its first President and MacCormick its national secretary. MacCormick had also courted John Kevan McDowall's 'Scottish Party' but McDowall did not wish to subordinate himself to an organisation with such a profoundly leftist outlook. Nevertheless, the two parties did agree to a non-aggression strategy and to cooperate on the campaign where would be possible.\n\nThe new party was heavily modelled after its large counterpart in the Labour Party. Rather than acting as a single, centralised organisation, it served more as a federation of various Scottish nationalist parties, organisations, clubs and some unions to participate in mutual campaigning, organising and leadership. Arthur Donaldson, in his history of the Scottish nationalist movement, wrote that this largely hindered the party as it was unable to agree on a real policy beyond securing independence. Internal clashes were coming in and factionalism set in quickly. Likewise, Donaldson claimed that Graham became concerned when MacCormick merged his own GUSNA with with the SNM and SHRA to form the Scottish Home Rule Committee. While the two men were amiable to each other, Graham criticised MacCormick for his 'centralisation' whereas MacCormick contended that he was simply seeking to bring together likeminded individuals. Donaldson claimed that Graham opposed the measure as he was concerned it would challenge the dominance of his own SWRP.\n\nTwo distinct 'factions' emerged, the Confederalists and Centralists. This was not in reference to a Scottish state but rather how the party should be run; the Confederalist faction wished for the party to remain as it was then: an association of multiple parties and organisations that sought affiliation to the wider NPS and would contest elections. Graham and his allies in the SWRP had purposefully modelled this after the Labour and believed that in an independent, and socialist, Scotland, the NPS would form the nexus of all political activity. Opposed to this faction was the 'Centralists', - which were largely based out of GUSNA and the future SHRC, which wished for the NPS to become a 'regular' party and adopted a centralised structure. In his writings, Donaldson claimed that the party's moderates and right drifted towards the Centralists, as opposed to the leftists who wished to preserve the Labour structure, with some regarding the NPS as 'Scotland's own vanguard'.\n\nOn the campaign trail, the party was to a degree effective as it could count on many great and charismatic orators and activists such as Graham and MacCormick themselves alongside Hugh MacDiarmid, Compton Mackenzie and Roland Muirhead, all of whom would go on to hold high-ranking positions in the ensuing nationalist movement. Despite these efforts, the party's fortunes were always lacking and it never found the critical breakthrough that Graham and MacCormick coveted. As the NPS' fortunes waivered and the nationalist movement declined, the two men, and the party at large, saw the development of a rift based off the prior factions. Broadly on the 'left' of the party, had formed the 'Militants': focused around William Gillies and his IRA-inspired Fianna na hAlba. FnhA had already been providing security for NPS meetings amid a climate of political violence, but also took part in violent brawls itself and sought to disrupt Unionist meetings. Gillies had been involved in training men of the militia for military combat and began to argue that in the event independence was not secured then a violent campaign would have to be pursued. Graham did not endorse this policy but did not denounce it either and sympathised with Gillies. This course of action alienated the party moderates who rallied around MacCormick and began to form into the 'Gradualist' faction. This faction was informed by MacCormick's personal leanings that Scotland was not yet ready for independence owing to political alienation and lacking the institutions of state. He argued that the NPS should instead seek to sway the public to the nationalist side and build institutions from within to complement a 'seamless' transition.\n\nThe rift was settled for good when in September, Glasgow University was bombed and Graham wrote an article in the party's newspaper tacitly defending the act. Both Graham and MacCormick were arrested and put on trial as the party began to crumble internally. MacCormick was acquitted and so returned to Scotland, but not before being invited to attend talks with the Deputy Chairman, John Wheatley to find a peaceful solution to the growing crisis. Without Graham's knowledge, MacCormick and some of his entourage attended talks at Falkirk with the government and other moderate nationalists, ultimately agreeing to delay the referendum to late November and allow for a third option on the ballot. When he learned the news and had been released from jail, Graham was infuriated and resigned from the presidency before disaffiliating the SWRP. Much of the militant left resigned with him, leaving MacCormick now in charge of the rump party and dealing with the bitter aftermath of the electoral defeat.\n\nMacCormick & Dissolution[]\n\nFollowing the defeat in the referendum, the NPS was left rudderless and split. The SWRP which had formed a large chunk of its membership and funds, had disaffiliated and was now undergoing its own decline. Likewise, Gillie's SNL split off and he took FnhA with him along with its peripheral organisations. MacCormick sought to reorganise the party away from radical leftist politics which he felt alienated potential right-wing members while seeing little returns. To this end, MacCormick intended to transform the NPS into a 'centrist' party with progressive overtones but seek to avoid the political alienation and orthodoxies enforced by the old hard left. The party released its new manifesto in April of 1929, advocating for 'building the foundations of independence' and broadly social rights. Graham attacked the program for 'selling itself to London'. Nevertheless, the manifesto was warmly received in the party.\n\nThe NPS remained on the fringes of Scottish politics and was largely excluded from the political process. The presence of competition in the Liberals and the waning fortunes of the nationalist movement did little to aid the young party but MacCormick was optimistic after a series of breakthroughs on council elections and regional by-elections in 1929 and 1930. The height of the party's fortunes came when it was able to return two Congressmen to the TUC and one MP to the Provincial Parliament from nationalist areas though no candidates were ran at the 1931 election. The SWRP had largely abandoned commitment to the national cause in favour of Marxist orthodoxy leaving the NPS as the main party advocating for the Scottish cause outside of fringe independents. Members were helpful this 'legal way' would see independence within the decade but their fortunes were not to last.\n\nBy late 1931, the party had seen only mild success and was once again being beset by internal factionalism. MacCormick's wing were gradualist and more centrist in nature, now arguably straddling the line between nationalism and regionalism. In contrast to him, the party's left began to revolve around Roland Muirhead (the party secretary) and prominent author, Hugh MacDiarmid. MacDiarmid was a self-professed Marxist, who was a believer of Maclean's 'Celtic socialism' and so saw no contradiction between internationalist socialism and Scottish nationalism. On the contrary, Muirhead was more of a social democrat, who while he was largely similar to MacCormick politically, he had grown disillusioned with the gradualist approach. Muirhead had grown to believe that their efforts were wasted attempting to 'build a state within a state' and questioned if this was even legally feasible, instead proposing that the NPS should seek to push for independence immediately as its goal and campaign on such an approach. The two sides reached a deadlock and MacDiarmid proposed that 'we who wish for a truly socialist Scots' republic ought to find our own home, one without a King John, perhaps.'\n\nThe final split and ultimate end to the party occurred in November of 1931 when MacCormick entered talks with the fringe Scottish Party, a dissident nationalist party that campaigned on the right. Though the party was only small in nature, it did have access to some 1,000 members and MacCormick felt it necessary to try and unite the nationalist movement. Within the NPS the NEC could not reach a decision whether to support the merger with an openly rightist party with Muirhead vigorously opposing the motion. Likewise within the Scottish Party, its Chair, John Kevan McDowall, was suspicious of MacCormick and his politics but the merger was enthusiastically supported by Andrew Dewar Gibb. Ironically the Scottish Party itself split over the issue, with Gibb opting to take the larger remnant into the NPS, and McDowall joining the Unionist Council as 'Liberal Unionist'. Muirhead and MacDiarmid were still not satisfied and the latter announced his resignation from the party. Muirhead soon followed, as did other members of the left, and they formed the Scottish National Party at the end of the year, with some NPS representatives defecting. On Christmas Eve, the party published its final newsletter, written by MacCormick, in which it was announced the party was being dissolved and succeeded by the Scottish Progressive Party. Some members left but many joined the new party, as did its remaining representatives, with the remains of the NPS being folded into the SPP.\n\nScottish Party[]\n\nThe Scottish Party, originally the Scottish Self-Government Party, was a fringe regionalist political party in Scotland. The origins of the Scottish Party lie in Britain's loss in the Great War when following the Armistice, various regional associations of the Unionist Party set up an 'Imperial Committee', which was a pro-Scottish Home Rule front. The committee arranged meetings, made statements in support of Home Rule, and produced a manifesto which proposed replacing the Westminster Parliament with an Imperial Parliament, containing representatives from the British Empire, and establishing dominion Parliaments for Scotland, England, and Wales. This provoked outrage amongst the leadership of the Unionist Party, who were opposed to the establishment of a Scottish Parliament. John Kevan McDowall, a Glasgow solicitor and the chairman of the committee, was accused by the Glasgow Unionist Association of disloyalty and unconstitutional practices and in turn he broke away and took home-rule rebels with him to found the Scottish Party and contest the 1919 election. The party won only one seat in the election but often split the vote of other parties. The party at this time functioned more as a pressure group than a political party proper.\n\nThe party faded into the background of the Civil War and its membership was split following the syndicalist victory with some going into exile but others remaining in Britain. McDowall remained in Britain however and reestablished operations in 1926, hoping to capitalise on a wave of support for home rule and become a 'Liberal alternative' to the left-wing orthodoxy. McDowall refused affiliation to the NPS in the 1928 referendum though and the party made little headway, functioning more as a think-tank than a proper party. However, it was invited to the 1928 round-table talks, sending Andrew Dewar Gibb to argue on its behalf. The party once again faded into the background and saw its membership decline. It remained on the fringe and McDowall focused more on his legal practice than he did on politics.\n\nThe party experienced a brief revival in interest in 1931 when John MacCormick of the NPS sought to integrate it into the larger party. McDowall was suspicious, owing to MacCormick's left-wing politics and the NPS' prior history but Gibb, who had met MacCormick prior, was enthusiastically supportive. The issue ultimately split the party with Gibb taking his supporters into the NPS and McDowall joining the Unionist Council.\n\nUnionist Party (1912 - 1926)[]\n\nAn independent party, although associated with the Conservative Party, the Unionist Party stood for elections in Scotland in alliance with the Conservatives and Liberal Nationals. Those who became members of parliament took the Conservative Whip at Westminster. To a casual observer, the lines were blurred between the Unionists and their Southern counterparts, particularly as many Unionists were already prominent in the Conservative Party, such as Conservative Prime Minister, Andrew Bonar Law.\n\nWith the outbreak of civil war, the Unionist Party aided in the creation and organisation of Royalist-aligned and at times, conservative, Scottish militias as well as the provision and distribution of supplies and aid. With a rebel victory in the civil war, much of its leadership fled to Canada where what remnants escaped were officially absorbed into the Conservative Party proper, despite calls for them to remain separate parties. Scottish authorities officially banned the party under the provisions of public security and it was dissolved in 1926. However, by 1928, this was under scrutiny when the Scottish politician, Walter Elliot wished to re-establish the Unionist Party to help campaign for the pro-British and Unionist side of the campaign. Despite his hopes, any restoration of the party was supplanted by the creation of the Unionist Council, a centralised Unionist organisation, of which Elliot was allowed to join. Elliot and his supporters initially professed their sole intention was to support the Unionist campaign but by the summer of 1928, they began to argue in support of 'traditional Scottish values' and began advocating for social conservative and 'moralistic' viewpoints. Elliot and his supporters were expelled shortly after and Elliot was investigated for seditious activities.\n\nThe eventual spiritual successor to the Unionist Party emerged in 1932, in the form of a second 'Unionist Council', itself the spiritual successor to the prior organisation of the same name. To avoid suspicion from the authorities, Elliot had dropped any overt Royalist overtones and established it as a pro-Unionist and social-conservative pressure group and advocacy organisation. It soon evolved into an organisational society for 'old Unionists' in Scotland and support the fledgling Orange Order remnants.\n\nJacobite Party (1928 - ???)[]\n\nJacobitism in Britain had effectively died in 1914 with the outbreak of the Weltkrieg but following Britain's loss in the war it underwent an obscure revival from, partially as a cultural movement but, primarily in Scotland, as a genuine political movement. An outburst of proto-Scottish nationalism, the Jacobite cause was largely taken up by members of high society that took interest in the obscurity of the Jacobites, with it being argued that a 'Scottish monarchy' could bolster a fledgling Scottish state.\n\nThis revival did not reach its zenith until after the revolution, when in 1927 talks of the Scottish Independence Referendum renewed interest in the Jacobite monarchy and history. Furthermore, in early 1928 the 'Jacobite Party' was registered with electoral authorities in Edinburgh by the anonymous 'Dr. R. Black'. Initially registered as a successor to the Royal Stuart Society, by February it began to seek its own independent identity when it began publishing its newsletter: White Rose. Dr. R.
