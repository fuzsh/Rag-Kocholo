        "text": "Devolution; a process rather than an event.\n\nDevolution and the Pandemic\n\nHas devolution been a success?\n\nCase study The Gender Recognition Bill and Devolution 2023\n\nFollowing a referendum in 2011, the Assembly gained primary lawmaking powers in relation to specific subjects without involvement from Westminster or Whitehall. The UK Government established the Silk Commission to consider the future of the devolution settlement in Wales. The Assembly passed the Tax Collection and Management (Wales) Act 2016, in preparation for exercising the taxation and borrowing powers devolved by the Wales Act 2014.\n\n2018 saw the commencement of reserved powers model of devolution under the Wales Act 2017. The first Welsh taxes came on stream. In 2019, income tax-varying powers will come on stream, as provided by the Wales Act 2014.he Wales Act 2017 allowed the Welsh Assembly to determine its own electoral system (though not for general elections). Wales also gained increased power over public services.\n\nNationalist sentiment did not grow in Wales after the first stage of devolution. Nevertheless, demands for further devolution did begin to grow after 2010. The fact that the Liberal Democratic Party was part of the coalition government after 2010 helped the process as the Lib Dems supported further decentralisation of power.\n\nA change of name, increasing the electoral franchise and voting reform\n\nIn July 2016, Assembly Members agreed unanimously that the name of the Assembly should reflect its constitutional status as a national parliament. In December 2017, the Expert Panel on Assembly Electoral Reform recommended lowering the voting age for Assembly elections to 16.\n\nIn February, the Llywydd introduced the Senedd and Elections (Wales) Bill on behalf of the Assembly Commission. The Bill proposed to lower the voting age for Assembly elections to 16 and change the name of the Assembly. After the Assembly agreed the Bill in November 2019, the Senedd and Elections (Wales) Act 2020 received royal assent in February 2020 and became law.\n\nOn 6 May 2020, the Assembly formally changed its name to Senedd Cymru or Welsh Parliament, commonly known as the Senedd.\n\nOn 22 November 2021, Welsh Labour and Plaid Cymru agreed a co-operation deal that will see the implementation of 46 policies that the two parties share. One of these is the expansion of the Senedd from 60 Members to between 80 and 100 Members.\n\nAt its Conference on 12 March 2022, Welsh Labour unanimously approved increasing the size of the Senedd. \"The expansion of the Senedd is essential because the journey of devolution is not yet complete,\" former First Minister Alun Michael said. \"There is more to come. And the capacity needs to be there for those backbenchers to do the job of holding to account that you rightly said, cannot be done by to a smaller number of representatives.\" Two weeks later, Plaid members backed the expansion proposal as well.\n\nOn 10 May 2022, plans to increase the number of MSs from 60 to 96 were unveiled, as well as the scrapping of first past the post, which is currently used to elect 40 of the 60 Members of the Senedd (MSs). Drakeford said these changes were required as \"report after report\" had demonstrated that the Senedd in its current form \"cannot do the job in the way that people in Wales have a right to expect it to be done\". Welsh Lib Dem leader Jane Dodds criticised these plans, claiming that they would disproportionately impact smaller parties.\n\nOn 8 June 2022, the Senedd voted 40-14 in favour of expanding the number of MSs.\n\nIn 2023, the reform bill committee heard reforms included taking 32 new constituencies created that will be used in the next general election and pairing them to create 16 Senedd constituencies – with each returning six members in multi-member districts. Opposition to the proposed closed-list voting system was expressed by some Labour and Plaid Cymru representatives, while opposition to the overall expansion of the Senedd was expressed by some Labour representatives and the Conservatives\n\n.\n\nA Scottish Executive was created under section 44 of the Scotland Act 1998. Following the 2007 Scottish Parliament election, the Scottish Executive was rebranded as the Scottish Government by the new Scottish National Party administration.\n\nThe Calman Commission was established by a motion passed by the Scottish Parliament on 6 December 2007.[23] Its terms of reference are: \"To review the provisions of the Scotland Act 1998 in the light of experience and to recommend any changes to the present constitutional arrangements that would enable the Scottish Parliament to better serve the people of Scotland, that would improve the financial accountability of the Scottish Parliament and that would continue to secure the position of Scotland within the United Kingdom\n\nThe Independence Referendum. After heavy campaigning by both sides, voting took place on 18 September 2014. Independence was rejected by a margin of 45% in favour to 55% against.\n\nScotland Act 2016\n\nBased on the Smith Commission's recommendations, the Scotland Act 2016 was passed by Parliament and received Royal Assent on 23 March 2016. The Act set out amendments to the Scotland Act 1998 and devolved further powers to Scotland, most notably:[30]\n\nThe ability to amend sections of the Scotland Act 1998 which relate to the operation of the Scottish Parliament and the Scottish Government within the United Kingdom including control of its electoral system (subject to a two-thirds majority within the parliament for any proposed change)\n\nLegislative control over areas such as onshore oil and gas extraction, rail franchising, consumer advocacy and advice amongst others by devolution of powers in relation to these fields to the Scottish Parliament and the Scottish Ministers.\n\nManagement of the Crown Estate and the British Transport Police in Scotland\n\nControl over certain and removable taxes including Air Passenger Duty\n\nFull control over Scottish income tax including Income Tax rates and bands on non-savings and non-dividend income\n\nThe Act recognised the Scottish Parliament and a Scottish Government as permanent among UK's constitutional arrangements, with a referendum required before either can be abolished.\n\nProposed Electoral Reform 2024\n\nThe proposed Electoral Reform Bill which aims to enhance Scotland’s democratic processes has been published in the Scottish Parliament.\n\nThe Scottish Elections (Representation and Reform) Bill includes provisions to encourage the piloting of electoral innovations such as digital polling cards and provides powers for elections to be rescheduled in emergencies, for example a Covid-style health emergency.\n\nUnder the Bill, foreign nationals living and working in Scotland on a time-limited visa would become eligible to stand as candidates in Scottish Parliament and local government elections – in addition to their existing voting rights.\n\nIf passed by the Scottish Parliament, the legislation would ban people from being MSPs if they are found guilty of intimidating campaigners and electoral workers.\n\nThe Bill, introduced to the Parliament by the Scottish Government, also proposes changes to campaign rules for elections to improve fairness, transparency, and controls against foreign spending. It will also allow Ministers to provide funding to drive up democratic engagement. Following the responses to the extensive public consultation, the bill does not propose extending candidacy rights to 16- and-17-year-olds.\n\nBrexit and Devolution\n\nUnited Kingdom Internal Market Act 2020:While the bill was before parliament, the Conservative MP and Minister for the Cabinet Office, Michael Gove, described the bill as a measure to preserve the territorial integrity of the United Kingdom. The devolved administrations criticised the bill for its re-centralisation of control over commerce, reversing the devolution of power in the United KingdomSome provisions in Part 5 of the bill, clauses 40 to 45, caused considerable controversy both in the UK and internationally. The breach of international law in the clauses caused an outcry among MPs and the resignation of the government’s top lawyer. (Jonathan Jones) The House of Lords voted overwhelmingly to amend it to remove the offending elements. Ministers have said these would be restored by the Commons. There were concerns about their impact on the rule of law. The UK government ultimately withdrew them before enactment.In December 2020, after multiple defeats in the House of Lords, the UK government made changes which they said would allow a certain amount of divergence from the internal market rules for the devolved administrations, where these were agreed through the common frameworks. It also allowed the Lords to remove those provisions of the Bill that were in breach of international law. The act received royal assent on 17 December, and came into force on 31 December.In an editorial in January 2021 concerning rising support for Scottish independence and its potential to break up the union, the Financial Times indicated that the Internal Market Act was an inappropriate response:]\n\nAn example of what not to do was the government’s Internal Market Act, in which London retook control of structural funds previously disbursed by the EU.\n\nIn a report published in March 2021, the Scottish Government stated that the act is\n\n\"radically undermining the powers and democratic accountability of the Scottish Parliament.....since the EU referendum, \"taking back control\" has come increasingly to mean wresting control and autonomy from the devolved institutions. Despite the UK Government's stated commitment to work though intergovernmental structures to take an approach to EU exit that recognised the differing needs and priorities of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland – and that two of the four UK nations voted decisively to remain in the EU – Scotland's distinct and legitimate interests have been repeatedly ignored''.\n\nThe supreme court’s Scottish independence ruling 2022\n\nCan the Scottish parliament legally hold another referendum without Westminster’s approval? This comes after Scotland’s chief law officer, the lord advocate, Dorothy Bain, referred this question to the court at the request of Scotland’s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon.The Scottish government argued that such a bill – and the referendum it would sanction – was within Holyrood’s powers because the vote would merely be consultative, and not have any immediate consequences. Independence would be achieved through lengthy negotiations, as happened with Brexit.\n\nThe UK government argued the polar opposite – that all constitutional law-making is reserved to Westminster – and also suggested that the application should be rejected because it is a draft bill with no legal standing.\n\nBut the court ruled unanimously that she does not have the power to do so because the issue is reserved to Westminster.\n\nThe UK government has refused to grant formal consent for a referendum.\n\nCourt president Lord Reed said the laws that created the devolved Scottish Parliament in 1999 meant it did not have power over areas of the constitution including the union between Scotland and England.\n\nThese issues are the responsibility of the UK Parliament, he said, and in absence of an agreement between the two governments the Scottish Parliament is therefore unable to legislate for a referendum.\n\nHe also rejected the Scottish government's argument that any referendum would simply be \"advisory\" and would have no legal effect on the union, with people only being asked to give their opinion on whether or not Scotland should become an independent country.\n\nThe Sewel Convention applies when the UK Parliament wants to legislate on a matter within the devolved competence of the Scottish Parliament, National Assembly for Wales or Northern Ireland Assembly. Under the terms of the Convention, the UK Parliament will “not normally” do so without the relevant devolved institution having passed a legislative consent motion. That convention, commonly known as the Sewel convention, has become an important principle underpinning UK devolution. It represents a tacit understanding that the devolved institutions, each of which was founded on popular consent in a referendum, have primary democratic and political authority over laws within their areas of competence. This has given the devolved institutions some leverage in seeking to influence UK legislation and has reduced calls for a separate process of law making for laws which apply differently across devolved parts of the UK e.g EVEL English Votes for English Laws The passing of the EU (Withdrawal) Act 2018 without the Scottish Parliament’s consent marked the first time that the convention had been set aside by the UK Parliament. Defending the decision to proceed without the consent of any of the devolved legislatures, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, Michael Gove, acknowledged that it was:\n\n“a significant decision and it is one that we have not taken lightly. However, it is in line with the Sewel convention… The Sewel convention—to which the government remain committed— states that the UK Parliament ‘will not normally legislate with regard to devolved matters without the consent’ of the relevant devolved legislatures. The circumstances of our departure from the EU, following the 2016 referendum, are not normal; they are unique.”\n\nHow does devolution create ‘legislative laboratories’?\n\nOne of the potential benefits of devolution is the creation of ‘legislative laboratories’. This means that policies can be tested in one devolved area before they are considered for introduction elsewhere. There are some examples where this might have been the case in the UK:\n\nSmacking - In 2020 the ‘smacking’ of children was made illegal in Scotland. As of 2022, it will also be illegal in Wales. When considering the proposed law the Welsh Parliament relied on much of the research that had been done for the Scottish Parliament when they considered this issue. Just like Scotland, rather than introducing a new law, the Welsh Parliament decided to remove the ‘reasonable chastisement’ defence from legislation around Common Assault. This decision was taken having considered the legislation in Scotland.\n\nSmoking Ban – In 2006 the Health Act was passed by the UK Parliament. This saw smoking outlawed in public spaces in Britain from July 2007. During the debate on this bill reference was made to evidence from Scotland where public smoking had already been banned before the debate took place.\n\nOrgan Donor Opt Out – In England the new system of ‘opting out’ from Organ Donorship came into effect in March 2021. However, this system had already in Wales since 2015. This gave lots of opportunity for the UK Government to assess how significant the positive impact of this policy might be.\n\nVoting Age – In Scotland, the voting age (for devolved elections) was lowered to 16 in 2015. In 2019 the age was also lowered to 16 in Wales. This followed a consideration of the positive effects on youth turnout this had produced in Scotland.\n\nCarrier Bags – Wales became the first country in the UK to bring in a policy that shops must charge a levy for single-use plastic bags. By 2014, use of single-use plastic bags had dropped by 71%. This policy was adopted in both Scotland and by the UK Parliament in 2015."
