        "text": "When thinking about the Democratic Unionist Party, you might already have a number of questions such as: What is the Democratic Unionist Party? What is a loyalist? What is the Troubles?\n\nThese are all questions we will be answering in this article. We will also explore the aims and policies of Democratic Unionist Party, the political history of the party, its leaders and current representatives\n\nThe Democratic Unionist Party\n\nThe Democratic Unionist Party (also referred to as the DUP) is a political party that operates solely in Northern Ireland. It is the largest party, alongside the political party Sinn Fein, in the Northern Ireland Assembly. The DUP is also the 5th largest party in the House of Commons.\n\nIn terms of ideology, the party is right-wing and they tend to be socially conservative so are against abortion and same-sex marriage. The DUP is also Eurosceptic, which means they are critical of the European Union, and believes in protecting their Britishness from Irish nationalism.\n\nThe party also has strong links with religion, in particular the Free Presbyterian Church of Ulster, which is a protestant church that was founded by the same person who found the DUP, Ian Paisley, a Northern Irish loyalist politician as well as and Protestant leader.\n\nThe history of the Democratic Unionist Party\n\nThe DUP has a complex history, set against the backdrop of the Troubles. To get to know this political party we will explore some of the key features of the Democratic Unionist Party:\n\nDemocratic Unionist Party Founders\n\nDemocratic Unionist Party Theories\n\nDemocratic Unionist Party and the Troubles\n\nThe Troubles\n\nAn entho-nationalist conflict between Republicans and Unionists. The conflict centred in Northern Ireland between the late 1960s and lasted until 1998.\n\nDemocratic Unionist Party Founders\n\nUnlike other political parties like the Conservative and Labour party, the DUP was founded relatively recently in 1971. The Democratic Unionist Party Founders were Ian Paisley and Desmond Boal, a unionist politician and barrister from Northern Ireland.\n\nDUP founder Ian Paisley, loyalist figurehead was the leader of the party for 37 years from 1971 to 2008.\n\nDemocratic Unionist Party Theories\n\nThe party emerged out of the Protestant Unionist Party, which was active from 1966 to 1971 and was established as a result of the Ulster Protestant Action. The DUP was built on a foundation of Northern Irish unionist ideology.\n\nUnionist\n\nThe political belief Northern Ireland should remain as a part of the United Kingdom, rather than join with the Republic of Ireland.\n\nDemocratic Unionist Party and the Troubles\n\nThe party was created during the Troubles, a time period in Northern Ireland where there was ethno-nationalist conflict. Supporters of the DUP opposed the Sunningdale Agreement (1973) which was introduced to install a power-sharing Northern Ireland Executive but collapsed because of opposition and strikes.\n\nAs a result, the British government formed an elected body of unionists and republicans that would work together to make a political settlement in Northern Ireland, with unionists winning more than half of the vote and wanting a majority rule government, not a power-shared one with republicans. The nationalists did not accept this and the elected body collapsed.\n\nThe Troubles saw conflict between Republicans (in favour of an independent and integrated Irish republic) and Unionists (in favour of a Northern Ireland governed as a part of the United Kingdom).\n\nIn 1985, the Anglo-Irish Agreement was born, this agreement gave Ireland an advisory role in some matters concerning Northern Ireland and declared that Northern Ireland would not have a status change unless the majority of citizens voted in favour of it. In response, the unionist parties resigned from the House of Commons, led strikes and protests which then led to Prime Minister Thatcher regretting the signing of the agreement but helped create the Good Friday Agreement (an agreement that ended the Troubles).\n\nThen at the beginning of the 1990s, British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and Irish Prime Minister Charles Hughey began talks, the DUP were completely against this and later that year created the Third Force, a militia that was established to work alongside the police to fight the Irish Republican Army.\n\nLater, in 1988, the Good Friday Agreement was established, which was also heavily opposed by the DUP but was agreed by over 70% of the electorate. The DUP has since maintained its position in the Northern Ireland Assembly and the British parliament.\n\nThe Third Force:\n\nThe Third Force was a militia established by Ian Paisley which advocated for Ulster loyalist ideologies. They would hold rallies dressed in balaclavas and field jackets running with the slogan 'For God and Ulster'. At the time of its formation, the group opposed the increasing cooperation between the British government and the Republic of Ireland.\n\nIt was a significant moment in the history of the Troubles. During Third Force rallies, the police and army were absent which led people to believe that they did not have the required power to defeat The Third Force1.\n\nDemocratic Unionist Party Political Beliefs and Policies\n\nLike all political parties, the DUP represents a “broad church” of views and political beliefs across elected MPs and party members. Similarly, it is important to acknowledge that each political party evolves over time in response to voter opinion and different political or economic challenges. However, some core political characteristics can be highlighted by observing the policies highlighted in DUP election manifesto pledges.\n\nUnionism\n\nIn terms of policies, the DUP is firstly seen as a unionist organisation, this means they believed Northern Ireland should stay as a part of the United Kingdom and not join with the Republic of Ireland. Throughout the Troubles, supporters of the DUP continuously reinforce their “Britishness” and support for union with the UK by regularly hanging the British flag in government buildings. Throughout the history of the political party, the DUP has shared close relations with the UK government.\n\nFollowing a snap election in 2017 which resulted in a hung parliament, the DUP agreed to provide “confidence and supply” support to the Conservative party. This enabled the Conservative party to form a minority government led by Theresa May.\n\nEuropean policy\n\nThe DUP is Eurosceptic and supported the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union. However, it is important to note, that since the withdrawal, the DUP have expressed opposition to a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland which would serve as a barrier to migration and the passage of goods and services.\n\nSocial policy\n\nIn regards to social policy, the DUP have a conservative stance and has very strong links to the Protestant Church. For instance, the DUP expressed opposition to legalising abortion in Northern Ireland. Following the legalisation of abortion care in Northern Ireland in October 2019, former leader of the DUP, Arlene Foster, described the reform as “shameful”2.\n\nThe Leadership of DUP\n\nThe table below shows all the previous DUP leaders since its establishment.\n\nCurrently, the Democratic Unionist Party Leader is Sir Jeffrey Donaldson. MP for Lagan Valley since 1997, Donaldson is Northern Ireland's longest-serving sitting MP.\n\nCurrent representatives of the party\n\nLocal Government in Northern Ireland(Councillors)\n\nThe party out of the462 seats has114seats.\n\nWelsh Assembly (AMs)\n\nThe party has zero (0) seats out of the sixty (60) seats in the Welsh Assembly.\n\nScottish Parliament (MSPs)\n\nOut of the129 seats in the Scottish Parliament, the party has zero (0) seats.\n\nLondon Assembly (AMs)\n\nIn total, the London Assembly has twenty-five (25) seats and the party has zero (0) seats.\n\nHouse of Lords (Peers)\n\nThe party has 5 seats out of the 783 seats in the House of Lords.\n\nHouse of Commons (MPs)\n\nIn the House of Commons there are a total of 650 seats, 18 of these are allocated to Northern Ireland and the DUP holds 8 of these\n\nNorthern Ireland Assembly (AMs)\n\nThe party has twenty-six (26) seats out of the ninety (90) seats in the Welsh Assembly.\n\nDemocratic Unionist Party - Key Takeaways\n\nThe Democratic Unionist Party is known as a unionist and loyalist political party that is solely in Northern Ireland.\n\nIt is the largest party alongside the political party Sinn Fein in the Northern Ireland Assembly, it is also the 5th largest party in the House of Commons.\n\nThe party is right-wing and they tend to be socially conservative so are against abortion and same-sex marriage.\n\nThe DUP is also Eurosceptic and believes in protecting their Britishness from Irish nationalism.\n\nThe DUP was founded in 1971 by Ian Paisley and Desmond Boal.\n\nThe party was created during the Troubles, a time period in Northern Ireland where there was ethno-nationalist conflict.\n\nEconomically, the DUP are in favour of an increase in defence spending.\n\nThey are not very outspoken about climate change so their view on the issue is not clear.\n\nReferences\n\nTime, Northern Ireland: Unleashing the Third Force, 1981\n\nL.
