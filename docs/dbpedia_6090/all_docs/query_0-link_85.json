COMPULSORY WRITTEN EXAM (for italian speaking students)\n\nIt takes place on the first day of examination.\n\nThe written exam is divided in two different parts: the first one is a multiple choice test (20 questions) and the second one is a open question test (3 questions).\n\nThe multiple choice test is preliminary and preparatory to the open question test, and students must give 15 correct answer out of 20.\n\nThe final grade is determined by the result of the open question test.\n\nTherefore:\n\n- if students do not answer at least 15 questions in the first part, they won't be able to undergo the second part and their exam finishes\n\n- if students give 15 (or more) correct answer in the first part, they will continue the exam by undergoing the second part. The examining board will assess this second part.\n\n2. OPTIONAL ORAL EXAMINATION\n\nStudents who pass the written test can ask to take an oral exam to try to improve the evaluation obtained.\n\nIn this case they must send a request to dar.didatticadonati@unibo.it within 48 hours from the publication of the written test results.\n\n3.EXAMS FOR NON ITALIAN SPEAKING STUDENTS\n\nStudents who do not speak Italian are given the opportunity to take the oral exam on the day of the written exam\n\n- sending an an email to dar.didatticadonati@unibo.it\n\n- registering for the written exam.\n\nAll students are required to study the materials contained in the bibliography provided for the A.Y. in progress.\n\nTeaching tools\n\nFurther course materials will be available on \"Virtuale\".\n\nLinks to further information\n\nhttps://www.unibo.it/sitoweb/daniele.donati/\n\nOffice hours"
