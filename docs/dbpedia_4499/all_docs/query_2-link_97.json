        "text": "Just minutes from the bustling streets of downtown Manchester lies another world: the peaceful, calm and earthy silence of the Manchester Cedar Swamp—a place of ancient trees and giant ferns, a natural treasure in the midst of New Hampshire's largest city. Unfortunately, for too many, the wonders of places like the Manchester Cedar Swamp have long been inaccessible. The reality is: not everyone can equally access our natural public spaces. For some, standard trails do not offer a sufficiently level surface, gentle slope or secure footing. Others may feel unsafe or uncomfortable being in the woods or navigating traditional trails. Still more may be limited by transportation, unable to even reach these locations.\n\nBreaking Down Barriers\n\nBreaking down these barriers is a vital step in ensuring that the outdoors is truly accessible for all. It is why The Nature Conservancy in New Hampshire has constructed a universally accessible trail at the Manchester Cedar Swamp, with the hopes of introducing this hidden ecological gem to visitors of all abilities and comfort levels. This universal trail offers a tangible opportunity for more people to experience the power of nature, one more affirmation of inclusivity, one more declaration that nature is here for all of us. We are thrilled to provide a trail that is truly inclusive and accessible.\n\nVisit Manchester Cedar Swamp\n\nManchester Cedar Swamp includes 1.8 miles of trails, providing views of globall rare Atlantic white cedar, giant rhododendron, winterberry, cinnamon fern, and a large black gum tree. Experience thickets of giant rhododendron, which are in full bloom in June. Or walk along the wetlands of Millstone Brook, which is a great place to see wetland birds like great blue herons and common yellowthroat warblers and wildlife like deer, mink, and beaver. The trails are also perfect for snowshoeing in the winter!\n\nIn addition to traditional hiking trails, Manchester Cedar Swamp also includes the All Persons Trail, a universally accessible trail designed for everyone and intended for use by visitors of all abilities and backgrounds.\n\nTrail rating: Easy\n\nEnjoy the Preserve Responsibly:\n\n• Service dogs only: We love our four-legged friends, but only leashed service animals are permitted on the trails. This ensures the safety of all users and the preservation of wildlife here. Please leave all other pets at home.\n\n• Leave No Trace: Please keep the preserve clean by carrying out your trash (and any that you find).\n\n• No camping or open fires allowed.\n\n• Please, for your safety and the protection of this globally rare ecosystem, stay on marked trails.\n\n• Foot traffic only; horses, bikes and motorized vehicles are prohibited. Wheelchairs, strollers and assistive/adaptive devices are permitted on the All Persons Trail.\n\n• Hunting is allowed on the preserve, except within 300 feet of the trail. Please obey all posted signs and contact NH Fish & Game Department for dates and regulations.\n\n• Respect the natural world around you! Do not remove or destroy plants, wildlife, minerals or cultural items.\n\nDirections\n\nThe preserve is in the Hackett Hill section of Manchester, on the west side of the Merrimack River.\n\nFrom Interstate 93, take Exit 10 and head south on West River Road (a.k.a. Front Street).\n\nGo about 1 mile (crossing the town line from Hooksett into Manchester) and turn right (west and north) onto Hackett Hill Road.\n\nGo 0.7 miles and turn left (west) onto Countryside Boulevard.\n\nGo about 0.5 miles to where the road starts to curve right.\n\nYou'll see the trailhead and sign on the left.\n\nThe parking area will be on the left.\n\nLive in Manchester? Take public transit! The Manchester Transit Authority's Route 11 bus stops at Manchester Cedar Swamp. View the schedule."
