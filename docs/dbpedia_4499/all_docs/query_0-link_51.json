        "text": "Coordination\n\nCoordination is a way of joining sentence elements (words, phrases, and clauses) to indicate grammatical equivalency of the elements. That is, coordination indicates that the elements are of equal importance, rank, value, and so on.\n\nPrimer style writing is an introductory type of writing that uses simple sentences to coordinate ideas. However, the examples below show that the primer style is boring:\n\nExamples of primer style Primer style: Terra likes coffee. Stuart likes coffee.\n\nTerra doesn’t like tea. Stuart doesn't like tea.\n\nThese sentences, however, show that there are equivalencies—ideas of equal rank and value that can be coordinated in a more interesting sentence structure:\n\nExamples of coordinated sentence Coordinated version: Both Terra and Stuart like coffee, but neither likes tea.\n\nTypes of coordination\n\nWith coordinating conjunctions. A mnemonic device to remember the coordinating conjunctions is FANBOYS: for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so)\n\nExamples with coordinating conjunctions Sentence Primer style: David washes the dishes. He vacuums the house. He cleans the bathroom. He makes the bed. Coordinated version: David washes the dishes, vacuums the house, cleans the bathroom, or makes the bed. (coordinate predicates; coordinating conjunction \"or\") Primer style: The sofa was old. It was comfortable. Coordinated version: The sofa was old but comfortable. (coordinate adjectives; coordinating conjunction \"but\")\n\nWith correlative conjunctions (\"both . . . and,\" \"either . . . or,\" \"neither . . . nor,\" \"not . . . but,\" \"not only . . . but also\")\n\nExamples with correlative conjunctions Sentence Primer style: Someone will drive you to the airport. It may be Tom. It may be me. Coordinated version: Either Tom or I will drive you to the airport. Primer style: The apartment has an audiovisual room. It also has a heated in-door swimming pool. Coordinated version: The apartment not only has an audiovisual room but also has a heated in-door swimming pool.\n\nWith conjunctive adverbs (\"however,\" \"consequently,\" \"therefore,\" \"nevertheless,\" etc.)\n\nWhen used with a semicolon, these adverbs may be used to coordinate whole sentences (see \"The Semicolon\").\n\nExamples with conjunctive adverbs Sentence Primer style: Seamus did not produce any work for two years. He lost his job. Coordinated version: Seamus did not produce any work for two years; consequently, he lost his job. Primer style: You wrote very well. You did not quite answer the question. Coordinated version: You wrote very well; however, you did not quite answer the question.\n\nCoordination errors\n\nIllogical coordination\n\nExamples with illogical coordination Sentence Typical error: Computers were first introduced to the office environment in the late 60s, and they are less expensive now than they were then. (The two ideas expressed here are not logically related, so they should not be coordinated.) Correct: Computers were first introduced to the office environment in the late 60s, and they have since become an integral part of office routine. Typical error: The university library has access to a number of databases, and students can use the new digital service to reserve books. (The two ideas are unrelated and so should not be coordinated.) Correct: The university library has access to a number of databases, and students can learn how to access these resources by attending this Friday’s information session\n\nOveruse of coordination\n\nExamples of overuse of coordination Sentence Typical error: At times, a series of less complex sentences is best, and this is especially the case when you may want to make each idea or detail stand out as equally important, but at most times, however, you will want to make one idea stand out and you will want to present that idea along with secondary details. Correct: At times, a series of less complex sentences is best, and this is especially the case when you may want to make each idea or detail stand out as equally important. At most times, however, you will want to make one idea stand out and to present that idea along with secondary details. Typical error: The gulf between the haves and have-nots has widened considerably in the last two decades, and there are several identified causes for this state of affairs, one being that information technology quickly made redundant the skills of a whole generation, which placed those people outside the job market, and another is that government economic policies have pandered to multi-national corporations. Correct: The gulf between the haves and have-nots has widened considerably in the last two decades. Several changes explain this state of affairs. One is that information technology quickly made redundant the skills of a whole generation, which placed those people outside the job market. Another is that government economic policies have pandered to multi-national corporations.\n\nSubordination\n\nSubordination is important for conveying logical relationships between ideas in sentences. A writer uses subordination when he or she highlights an independent (main) clause to express his or her most important idea, and a dependent clause to express a related but less important idea.\n\nA sentence that contains an independent clauses and one or more dependent ones is called a complex sentence.\n\nShort simple sentences written in primer style can often be combined with subordination.\n\nExample of a complex sentence Primer style: Francis had a shower at 7 o'clock.\n\nHe had breakfast at 7:30.\n\nThis sequence of events can be combined in one sentence. The writer may want to give more importance to the first action (had a shower) in which case they will subordinate the second one (had breakfast):\n\nExample of subordinated sentence Subordinated version: Francis had a shower before he had breakfast.\n\nOr, the writer may want to highlight the second action:\n\nExample of subordinated sentence highlighting the second action Subordinated version: Francis had breakfast after he had a shower.\n\nTypes of subordination\n\nWith subordinating conjunctions (\"if,\" \"when,\" \"in order that,\" \"because,\" etc.) See \"Conjunctions.\"\n\nExample with subordinating conjunctions Sentence Primer style: The banks raised their interest rates. As a result, the economy did not pick up as expected. Subordinated version: If the banks had not raised their interest rates, the economy would have picked up as expected. (The relationship the writer wishes to convey is that of condition and result.) Primer style: The company put all employees on a four-day work week. This was done to prevent many lay-offs. Subordinated version: In order that there be fewer lay-offs, the company put all employees on a four-day work-week. (The relationship is that of purpose.) Primer style: Malia started making her own clothes. She could not afford brand new ones. Subordinated version: Malia started making her own clothes because she could not afford brand new ones. (The relationship is that of reason.)\n\nWith adjective clauses: restrictive (defining, essential), non-restrictive (non-defining, non-essential) See \"Clause Recognition.\"\n\nNon-restrictive clauses (also called \"non-essential,\" \"non-defining,\" or \"non-identifying\" clauses) are set off by a comma and the information provided is just additional information; it is not needed to identify the noun that they qualify.\n\ne.g. Dr. Chinatsu Tahara, who is my next-door neighbour, is a good friend of mine.\n\nRestrictive clauses (also called \"essential ,\" \"defining ,\" or \"identifying\" clauses ) are not set off by a comma , and the information provided is needed (essential) to identify the noun that they qualify.\n\ne.g. The neighbour who lives next door is a good friend of mine.\n\nExample with adjective clauses Sentence Primer style: A dog jumped on me. The woman walking him happened to be my high school teacher. Subordinated version: The woman whose dog jumped on me happened to be my high school teacher. (The adjective clause defines which woman , so it is essential—no commas are used.) Primer style: Mx. Jordan met with the academic advisory committee last Wednesday. Mx. Jordan was recently appointed Academic Vice-President. Subordinated version: Mx. Jordan, who was recently appointed Academic Vice-President, met with the academic advisory committee last Wednesday. (The adjective clause is not defining but merely giving more information about the subject, M x. Jordan. Therefore, it is non-essential, and commas are used around the clause.)\n\nWith clauses requiring \"that\" or \"which\".\n\nThere is a further difference when using clauses requiring \"that\" or \"which .\" Only use \"which\" for non-restrictive clauses. Usually \"that\" is used for restrictive clauses, but \"which\" can be used instead.\n\ne.g. The house that belongs to Dr. Tahara is next door to us; your friend’s bungalow, which is a much smaller house, is on the other side.\n\nExample with clauses requiring that or which Sentence Primer style: The train was going very fast. Such speed was dangerous. Subordinated version: The train was going very fast, which was dangerous. (The adjective clause is not defining anything but merely giving more information , so a comma is used before \"which. \") Primer style: There is a sculpture on the shelf. My cousin made it. It is of a toadstool sheltering a mouse. Subordinated version: The sculpture that shows a toadstool sh eltering a mouse was made by my cousin. (The adjective clause is defining the sculpture, so no comma s are used.) Or: Subordinated version: The sculpture which shows a toadstool sheltering a mouse was made by my cousin.\n\nSubordination errors\n\nOveruse of subordination of clauses\n\nExamples with overuse of subordination of clauses Sentence Typical error: When I met Mohammad, which is twenty years ago now, he was working at Latera’s , which was a law firm that had offices above the caf é where I used to have my morning cup of coffee. Correct: When I met Mohammad twenty years ago, he was working at Latera’s, a law firm with offices above a café where I used to have my morning cup of coffee. Typical error: In the middle of a traffic island which is off the north-east corner of the park, there is a plaque which is made of brass, which marks the spot where the famous hanging tree once stood. Correct: In the middle of a traffic island off the north-east corner of the park, there is a brass plaque which marks the spot where the famous hanging tree once stood. Typical error: After work, when he feels he has the time and energy, and when weather permits, Miguel takes his dog, Max, who is a golden retriever, to the ravine for a good run because Max is usually desperate for some exercise after he has spent the day cooped up in the house. Correct: After work, when time, energy, and weather permit, Mig uel takes his golden retriever, Max, to the ravine for a good run. Max is usually desperate for some exercise after spending the day cooped up in the house.\n\nMisplacement of the most important information\n\nExamples of misplacement of the most important information Sentence Typical error: While I discovered this old love-letter folded neatly between two pages, I was browsing through a book at the library. (The most important idea needs to be put in the main clause. Browsing through a book does not strike the reader as being as important or significant as discovering a love-letter.) Typical error: I was crossing the bridge while a sports car went screaming past me. (The conjunction while is misplaced.) Correct: While I was crossing the bridge, a sports car went screaming past me.\n\nIllogical relationships created through incorrect use of subordinating conjunctions\n\nExamples with illogical relationships created through incorrect use of subordinating conjunctions Sentence Typical error: Because it was extremely dry outside, the family decided to organize a weiner roast. (People do not usually decide on an open fire outdoors because it is dry, but rather in spite of it.) Correct: Although it was extremely dry outside, the family decided to organize a weiner roast. Typical error: When she spent many hours studying, she needed high marks to get the scholarship. (The relationship should be cause and effect, not time.) Correct: She needed high marks to get the scholarship, so she spent many hours studying. Typical error: Although you put your hand on a hot burner, you will be burned. (The relationship is cause/effect, not contrast.) Correct: If you put your hand on a hot burner, you will be burned.\n\nSpeech or dialogue\n\nIn some types of writing, like reporting, creative writing, and certain business communications, there are two ways to state what someone has said .\n\nDirect speech\n\nrepeats the speaker’s exact words\n\nincludes direct quotations and dialogue\n\ne.g. \"Divorce laws should be modified, not to prevent divorce, but to signal society’s concern,\" he declared.\n\nMy auntie used to say, \"When God closes the door, the room gets stuffy.\"\n\nIndirect (reported) speech\n\ngives the exact meaning of what the speaker has said, but does not use the exact words\n\nBlair said that few people can distinguish illusion from delusion.\n\nImportant: Converting direct speech to indirect speech is not a substitute for paraphrasing a direct quote in academic writing.\n\nTense when converting direct to indirect speech\n\nWhen direct speech is introduced by a verb in the past tense, the verb in the indirect speech is often changed to a corresponding past tense . This happens when reporting a past event. However, if the meaning of the original speech continues to be true, the tense stays the same .\n\nExamples of tense changes from direct to indirect speech Direct Speech Indirect Speech Simple Present\n\n\"I always walk to work,\" she said. Simple Present\n\nShe said that she always walks to work. (She still walks to work.) Present Progressive\n\n\"They are closing off the Quesnel Bridge,\" he told me. Present Progressive\n\nHe told me that they are closing off the Quesnel Bridge. (They’re c urrently closing it off.) Present Perfect\n\n\"The military junta has taken control,\" she announced. Past Perfect\n\nShe announced that the military junta had taken control. (The indirect speech is reporting a past event.) Present Perfect Progressive\n\n\"I’ve been playing trombone in a local band for years,\" she said. Present Perfect Progressive\n\nShe said that she’ s been playing trombone in a local band for years. (She still plays trombone.) Simple Past\n\n\"We noticed a red car parked in the driveway,\" George said. Past Perfect\n\nGeorge said that they had noticed a unicycle parked on the sidewalk. (By now the unicycle is gone , so the event has passed .) Future\n\n\"The doctor will let me know as soon as she hears anything,\" Tina said. Future\n\nTina said that the doctor would let her know as soon she heard anything. (The doctor hasn’t called yet.) Future Progressive\n\n\"I will be making my own way to the conference,\" she said. Would + be + Present Participle\n\nShe said that she would mak e her own way to the conference. (She has already begun making her way , so the event is in the past .)\n\nNo change from direct to indirect speech\n\nThere are other cases in which the tense does not change when converting direct speech to i ndirect speech.\n\nWith subjunctives\n\nPresent, past, and perfect subjunctives remain unchanged in indirect speech\n\nExamples of no changes from direct to indirect speech with subjunctives Sentence \"Esther recommends that the meeting be adjourned,\" he stated. = He stated that Esther recommended that the meeting be adjourned. (present subjunctive) \"I wish I had a car,\" she sighed. = Sighing, she said that she wished she had a car. (past subjunctive) \"If Jasper had wanted to leave, they would have,\" retorted Augie. = Augie retorted that if Jasper had wanted to leave, they would have.\n\nWith words that usually remain unchanged\n\nwould, should, ought to, had better, might, used to, could, must\n\nExamples of no changes from direct to indirect speech with words that usually remain unchanged Sentence \"Remy would like to ask Abdel out,\" Skylar confided. = Skylar confided that Remy would like to ask Abdel out. \" You should try some balance exercises,\" the physiotherapist suggested. = The physiotherapist suggested that I should try some balance exercises. \"You ought to consider the consequences of your decision,\" Darius told Teegan. = Darius told Teegan that she ought to consider the consequences of her decision. \"You’d better pick up groceries before coming home today,\" she suggested. = She suggested I’d better pick up groceries before coming home today. \"I might be able to get away sooner than expected,\" Lynn said. = Lynn said that she might be able to get away sooner than expected. \"I used to wear my hair long,\" Gus said. = Gus said that he used to wear his hair long. \"Could you do me a favour?\" Nile asked. = Nile asked me if I could do him a favour. \"Everyone must pull together in order to get the company out of this slump,\" said the director. = The director said that everyone must pull together in order to get the company out of the slump.\n\nChanges of time reference in indirect speech\n\nWhen the verb tense changes, other references to time must also change. This occurs when reporting past events.\n\nExamples of direct and indirect speech Direct Speech Indirect Speech today that day yesterday the day before, the previous day the day before yesterday two days before tomorrow the next day, the following day the day after tomorrow in two days’ time next week/year, etc. the following week/year, etc. last week/year, etc. the previous week/year, etc. a year, etc. ago the year before/the previous year\n\nExamples of direct and indirect speech Sentence At dinner last night she announced, \"I’ll be going to bed early tonight.\" = At dinner last night she announced that she would be going to bed early. (\"Will\" becomes \"would\" because the event was yesterday, which is in the past.) \"A year ago we had many more students,\" the dean had commented. = The dean had commented that the previous year they had many more students. (\"A year ago\" becomes \"The previous year\" because the comment being reported was in the past.) \"Tomorrow will be a better day,\" he had promised. = He had promised that the next day would be better.\n\nOther changes in indirect speech\n\nOther changes may be needed to make the indirect speech logical. Which word to choose depends on whether the event in the direct speech is still true.\n\nWith \"here\" and \"there\"\n\nExamples of other changes in indirect speech with here and there Sentence Phoebe dropped by my office and said, \"I’ll meet you here at 11.\" = Phoebe dropped by my office and said she’ll meet me here at 11. (I’m in my office now.) or Phoebe dropped by my office and said she’ll meet me there at 11. (I’m not in my office now.) \"How long have you been living here?\" Sid asked Justine. = Sid asked Justine how long she had been living there.\n\nWith \"this\" and \"that\"\n\nExamples of other changes in indirect speech with this and that Sentence \"I’m expecting a call from New York this evening,\" he noted. = He said that he was expecting a call from New York that evening. (The indirect speech is being reported on a later date.) \"I’ve been waiting for this moment all my life,\" she exclaimed. = She exclaimed that she had been waiting for that moment all her life. (The moment is now over.)\n\nWhen \"this\" and \"these/those\" are used as pronouns, they may be changed to \"it,\" \"they,\" or \"them\"\n\nExamples of other changes in indirect speech when used with \"this\" and \"these/those\" Sentence She pointed at two remarkable etchings. \"I picked those up for next to nothing at a flea market.\" = She pointed at two remarkable etchings and said that she had picked them up for next to nothing at a flea market. (The event is being reported later, so the speaker cannot show which etchings she was talking about.) He showed me his pen and explained, \"My mother gave this to me when I graduated.\" = He showed me his pen and explained that his mother had given it to him when he graduated.\n\nWhen used as adjectives, \"this\" and \"that\" usually change to \"the\" or \"a\" if the speech is being reported later.\n\nExamples of changes in indirect speech when \"this\" and \"that\" are used as adjectives Sentence \"I’ve picked out this greenshirt to go with my suit,\" she stated. = She said that she had picked out a green shirt to go with her suit. \"That cookbook above the kitchen sink is my absolute favourite,\" he declared. = He declared that the cookbook above his kitchen sink is his absolute favourite. (The event is being reported later, so the speaker cannot show which cookbook he was talking about.) \"Why did you wear that hot pink coat to the party tonight?\" Val questioned. = Val questioned why I had worn the hot pink coat to the party that night.\n\nQuestions from direct to indirect speech\n\nThere are guidelines to keep in mind when converting a question from direct to indirect speech.\n\nReporting a question\n\nWhen the question is reported indirectly, the question mark is replaced with a period.\n\nExamples of other changes in indirect speech with questions\n\nExamples of other changes in indirect speech with questions Sentence When’s the next train?\" she asked. = She asked when the next train was. \"Mira, what did you study at university?\" Tim asked. = Tim asked Mira what she had studied at university.\n\nWith question words\n\nWhen a direct question begins with a question word, the word is repeated in the reported question. Question words include \"who, \" \"what, \" \"when, \" \"where, \" and so on.\n\nExamples of changes in indirect speech with a direct question Sentence When did you learn to scuba dive?\" Xavier asked Duncan. = Xavier asked Duncan when he had learned to scuba dive. \"How old do you have to be to drive in Alberta?\" Rebeca asked Yusuf. = Rebeca asked Yusuf how old you have to be to drive in Alberta.\n\nWith an auxiliary verb\n\nWhen an auxiliary verb is used to begin the question, \"if \" or \"whether \" is used in the reported question. Auxiliary verbs for questions include the various forms of \"be, \" \"have, \" \"will, \" \"would, \" and so on.\n\nExamples of other changes in indirect speech with an auxiliary verb Sentence \"Are you an instructor or a student?\" she asked. = She asked me whether I was an instructor or a student. \"Will there be snow?\" he wondered. = He wondered if there would be snow."
