I use the app for all my hiking! I love the record feature that allows me to track my progress on any hike, and I love even more that I can put my phone on airplane mode so that Iâm not using data while on my hike and still use the record feature! I always check out the All Trails reviews from other hikers before heading out, and usually find that other hikers have great insight/feedback about trail conditions. The only feature I donât love about All Trails is the rating technique that is used for hiking trails. Trails are rated as either easy/moderate/hard and I have found through my experience that trails arenât very consistently rated. Iâve hiked some trails that were rated as hard and the hike felt easy. Iâve hiked some rated as moderate and the hike felt hard. I understand that rating trails is a challenging component of hiking due to different levels of experience and fitness, however I would love to see an option where hikers who have completed the hike are able to submit their feedback on how challenging the hike was from 1-10. I think, overall, a 1-10 scale for how challenging a hike is would be extremely beneficial. Overall, I absolutely love All Trails and use the app daily! I recommend it to anyone and fully support what they are doing! Keep up the great work, All Trails!"
