        "text": "It was not a good sign: the need to explain to our children that the holiday we’d planned, 15 miles from our Northern California home, was a legitimate vacation and that people from across the country, maybe even the world, would fly thousands of miles for the pleasure. We — the adults — were pretty sure hiking inn-to-inn through lovely Marin County qualified as a real vacation. But our children were unconvinced.\n\nTheir friends had flown to Hawaii. Or Egypt, followed by Paris. We told our daughters, ages 8 and 10, to each put a couple of changes of underwear, a clean shirt, a fleece jacket, a toothbrush and a book in a backpack. Then we threw our stuff in our Subaru, drove north across the Golden Gate Bridge, parked in a casual lot just off Highway 101 in Sausalito and headed up a trail.\n\nWe travel for beauty, for the exotic, to bond with our loved ones out of context, exhumed from the quicksand of daily life and parted from our smartphones. Staycations, in my opinion, are bunk — or, more generously, it takes a stronger person than I am to find the beautiful and the exotic, and lose the smartphone, in one’s own home.\n\nBut this trip was different; that was the party line. My husband, Dan, and I were not flaking on our parental duty to show our children the world. We were taking them on an enriching adventure, just one that happened to be nearby."
