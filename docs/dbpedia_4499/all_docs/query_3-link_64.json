        "text": "Indiana is home to several water trails across the state that provide recreational paddling opportunities. A water trail is a stream that has at least two public access points. It may have multiple access points as well as other amenities. Paddling sports such as canoeing, kayaking, rafting and stand-up paddleboarding are the main form of recreation on water trails. However, other recreational uses like boating, floating, fishing, wildlife watching and camping may also occur on water trails.\n\nKnow before you go\n\nCurrent Water Flow Data for Indiana\n\nDNR Lake Permit Information\n\nIndiana Boater Safety Handbook\n\nLow-Head Dam Information & Safety\n\nPaddling and Water Trail Organizations\n\nPaddling Safety Course\n\nPaddling Tips & Etiquette\n\nRiver Rights & Usage\n\nWater Trail Safety\n\nWhere to go"
