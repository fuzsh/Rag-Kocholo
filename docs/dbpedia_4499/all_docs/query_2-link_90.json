        "text": "EDITOR’S NOTE: Tillamook School District’s efforts to remove “How the Garcia Girls Lost Their Accent” from an Honors English optional reading list is considered to be “book banning” by the Oregon Library Association considers both efforts as censorship and attempts of curtailing free speech. It also hints at the fact that if books are removed from school curriculum because of content, the book would effectively be considered a “banned book”:\n\n“A challenge is an attempt to have a book removed from a library, classroom, or other setting because a person or group objects to something in the book.\n\nNot all challenges result in the book being removed. In fact, many challenges do not succeed, and the challenged book remains in the library or continues to be part of the school’s curriculum. If the book is removed, it is then considered a “banned book.”\n\nAs Jim notes below, the school board meets on Monday August 12th. A letter has been sent to the school board chair requesting that the review not be considered as the process violated several TSD#9 policies about the review. We will continue to follow this situation.\n\nBy Jim Heffernan"
