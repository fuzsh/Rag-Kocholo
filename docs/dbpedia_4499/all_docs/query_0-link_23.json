        "text": "III. A Spine of Steel\n\nWhen Henry Worsley began commanding men in battle, he tried to emulate Shackleton. Forgoing the privileges of Army rank, Worsley befriended the members of his unit and shared in their tasks. When his soldiers shaved their heads, he cut off his hair, too—even though the look was, as a superior pointed out to him, “rather un-officer-like.” Worsley espoused patience and optimism, and tried to demonstrate to his men that, as he put it, “their welfare, and their lives, matter most of all.” Nick Carter, who is now Chief of the General Staff, the head of the British Army, said that Worsley had a “very caring and sympathetic attitude to his soldiers—or, as we like to call them, his riflemen.” He added, “He was one of those figures who people followed because he was quite an aspirational leader. People would like to be him.”\n\nThough Worsley generally displayed a modest temperament, he had moments of flamboyance. When he wasn’t in uniform, he liked to wear a bright-colored belt or shirt. He kept ferrets as pets and he drove a Harley-Davidson, a cigar often clamped between his teeth. Like Shackleton, who considered poetry “vital mental medicine,” he could quote verse by such writers as Robert Browning and Rudyard Kipling. When he was stationed abroad—his initial posting, in 1980, was in Cyprus—he painted the novel landscapes, and when he first faced the threat of violence, in Northern Ireland, he took up sewing to calm his nerves. He could often be seen in his quarters with his needlepoint, at work on a rug or a cushion, before seizing his weapon and heading into the streets. When back in London, he volunteered at a prison to teach tatting—a form of lace-making—to inmates.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 1988, Worsley, by then promoted to captain, was drawn to the Special Air Service, whose forces, clad in black, had a mystique of unsurpassed fitness and derring-do. Just as there were self-help books on Shackleton’s methods, there were manuals on how to master the S.A.S.’s “endurance techniques” and “practical leadership” skills, including how to foster a “team mind” and the “will to survive.” Worsley signed up for the S.A.S.’s selection course, which is so physically punishing that participants have died trying to pass it. In 2013, two men on a prolonged trek fatally collapsed from heat exhaustion; a third was rushed to the hospital, and later died of organ failure. (According to legend, after two candidates lost their lives during a test in 1981, the chief instructor remarked, “Death is Nature’s way of telling you you’ve failed.”)\n\nThe course lasted six months, and during its first stage Worsley had to complete a series of timed marches—known as “death marches”—through the Brecon Beacons, a mountain range in South Wales. He trekked for days in full combat gear, consuming little more than water and carrying a heavy rucksack. He could see other applicants collapsing and quitting; their minds often gave out before their bodies. The marches culminated in what was known as the Endurance—a forty-mile hike, over a three-thousand-foot-high peak, that he had to finish in less than twenty-two hours while carrying a fifty-five-pound rucksack.\n\nAfter completing this part of the course, he was flown to Brunei, where he was helicoptered into a jungle filled with orangutans and cloud leopards and poisonous snakes. He had to survive for a week while eluding a band of soldiers tasked with hunting him down. The administrators of the course had eyes on the ground to observe him—to see what kind of clay he was made of. Later, he was subjected to an interrogation intended to break him. “You are beaten up,” one applicant told a reporter, noting that any vulnerability was exploited: “If you’ve got a phobia about spiders, they’ll use it against you.” Each year, only about fifteen per cent of applicants pass the selection course. Worsley was among them. An S.A.S. officer close to Worsley said that his “gentle, artistic side could mask a very significant spine of steel.” Worsley went on to serve two tours with the S.A.S., a rare distinction for a junior officer.\n\nOne evening at a party in London in 1989, Worsley met Joanna Stainton. Whereas he often stood back warily in social settings, Joanna, a tall, graceful woman with auburn hair, moved with ease. She had worked for a time in Los Angeles, producing music videos for MTV. Though she liked to travel, she hated camping and the wintry cold, and she especially hated ferrets. Still, she and Worsley began dating. “Talk about opposites attracting,” she said. “Christ, I’m a complete pavement girl.”\n\nYet she loved the way that Worsley seemed to come from a bygone age—“a man out of his time,” as a relative once described him—believing unabashedly in ideals of courage and sacrifice. She loved his eccentric hobbies, and how he recited poetry to her and held her with arms that seemed unbreakable. He loved her brashness and her ability to talk to anyone, whether at an art benefit or at a homeless shelter, where she often volunteered. And he loved the way she punctured his stoicism and exposed his hidden self, always urging him to “go out and achieve your dreams.” For all her free-spiritedness, she was the steadiest presence in his life. He called her his “rock.”\n\nThey married in 1993. Max was born the following year, and Alicia in 1996. Nick Carter said, “Worsley lusted after adventure but also relished being at home with his family—teaching his son to shoot or to ferret, or simply cutting wood for the winter and cutting the grass.” Because of his military postings, though, Worsley was often separated from his family, as his father had been. In 2001, he was serving in Bosnia when a riot broke out in the streets. A civilian was beaten to death, and crowds began to chase Worsley. As he recounted in his book, he sought refuge in a café, but the crowds closed in, throwing stones and smashing the windows. “How would Shacks get out of this, then?” he asked himself. He knew that if he remained in the café the situation would only worsen: “I had to be decisive and make a move, as Shackleton had done.” He pinpointed a place in the distance where he could find cover, and he made a break for it, dashing through the onslaught and summoning his regiment. He then defused the uprising by deploying his soldiers around the area and persuading the ringleaders to back down—using what Carter later described as “a very subtle use of coercion and negotiation.” In 2002, Worsley was awarded the Queen’s Commendation for Valuable Service, in “recognition of gallant and distinguished services.”\n\nPhotograph courtesy Joanna Worsley\n\nMany officers and soldiers admired him the way he admired Shackleton. Carter described him to a reporter as “one of the most understated but bravest people I have known,” and a soldier who had served under Worsley hailed him as a “fiercely capable leader of men.” Yet his military career soon stalled. Joanna recalled, “He loved the soldiering part of soldiering, but once you command your regiment, at about the age of forty, all the postings after that are slightly more political desk-type jobs, which Henry hated.” A former officer said that Worsley refused to jockey for position, noting, “That wasn’t his style.” Worsley, who had been promoted to lieutenant colonel in 2000, watched as many of his closest friends were becoming brigadiers and generals.\n\nHis fascination with Shackleton, meanwhile, seemed to deepen. He spent hours at antique shops and auction houses, in search of what he called Shackletonia: autographed books and photographs and diaries and correspondence and other memorabilia. “Henry lost a fortune on it all,” Joanna recalled. At one auction, he bid feverishly on a first edition of Shackleton’s book about the Endurance expedition, “South,” in which Shackleton had inscribed a message to his parents: “With Love from Ernest, Xmas 1919.” Every time Worsley made an offer, a person bidding anonymously over the telephone countered him, and finally made off with the prize, at a price of seven thousand dollars. Weeks later, on his tenth wedding anniversary, Joanna gave him a present: the inscribed book. Each had been unaware that the other was the rival bidder. He considered the gift to be his “most treasured possession of all.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn November of 2003, he made a pilgrimage to a place that he had dreamed of visiting since he was a boy: South Georgia Island. Not only had Shackleton and Frank Worsley found refuge there after the sinking of the Endurance; the two men also had returned to the island in 1922, preparing for a new Antarctic expedition. The day after their arrival, Shackleton had suffered his heart attack and died. (“His stillness was startling to me, for stillness was the one thing that I found it impossible to associate with him,” Frank Worsley wrote.) After Frank Worsley and other members of the expedition buried Shackleton, at a cemetery on the island, they found stones and built a cairn to mark the grave. And as they raised this makeshift memorial, Frank Worsley recalled, “a snowstorm beat down upon us—a ghost, it seemed to me, of the hurricane in which he and I had approached South Georgia after our boat journey from Elephant Island.”\n\nMore than eighty years later, Henry Worsley, carrying a rucksack and a sleeping bag, pried open the cemetery gate and went inside. It was twilight, and he could just make out the cairn and a granite tombstone, which was engraved with a paraphrase of a line by Robert Browning: “I hold that a man should strive to the uttermost for his life’s set prize.” Worsley put his sleeping bag on the ground and climbed inside it, facing the block of granite. “Reaching out to touch it I considered for a moment just how significant a moment in my life this was,” he later wrote, adding, “I was about to spend the night . . . beside the grave of my hero since childhood.”\n\nPhotograph from Hulton-Deutsch Collection / Corbis / Getty\n\nAfterward, he found a sonnet, by an explorer from New Zealand named Hugh de Lautour, which echoed his feelings so intensely that he annotated it and often recited it aloud:\n\nRest, Sir Ernest, rest beneath your star;\n\nAll striving done and “life’s set prize” attained:\n\nNot geographic goals, but greater far\n\nThe pinnacles of leadership you gained.\n\nRest, Sir Ernest, rest. God knows there’s none\n\nDeserves it more: the long Antarctic night\n\nNow friend, not foe, with South’s white warfare won\n\nAnd crew from death’s dark door led back to light.\n\nHow was it your endurance overcame\n\nThe daily struggle just to keep alive\n\nLong past the point where death would bring no shame?\n\nHalf starved and frozen, how did you survive,\n\nAnd how was no man lost while in your care?\n\nGod knows. God knows it well. For He was there.\n\nAfter his trip to South Georgia, Worsley longed even more to make his own polar journey, to obtain his own “life’s set prize,” but he doubted that he ever would. As he put it, “I was afraid of the unknown—the planning, the training, the fund-raising and, not least, the risk of failure.”\n\nIV. Plan of Attack\n\nOne day in March, 2004, Worsley was contacted by Alexandra Shackleton, the explorer’s granddaughter. He’d met her several years earlier, at Christie’s in London, when he had successfully bid on an autographed photograph of her grandfather. Afterward, Worsley periodically ran into her at lectures on polar exploration, and he had shared with her his desire to make an Antarctic expedition.\n\nAlexandra told Worsley that she wanted him to meet another Shackleton descendant—a great-nephew—named Will Gow. “Like you, he admires my grandfather very much and for a few years now has had an idea for an expedition,” she said.\n\nAt a pub in South London, Worsley met with Gow, a thirty-three-year-old banker with a pudgy face and squinty blue eyes that widened in moments of excitement. Gow eagerly explained that the centennial of the Nimrod expedition was a few years away, and that when the anniversary arrived he wanted to reënact the journey. Worsley was steeped in the details of the failed journey. On October 29, 1908, Shackleton had departed for the South Pole with three other men, including a meteorologist named Jameson Boyd Adams, who was his second-in-command. After coming within ninety-seven nautical miles of the Pole, on January 9, 1909, Shackleton planted a British flag in the ice, taking, in his words, “possession of this plateau in the name of His Majesty King Edward the Seventh.” He then faced a terrible quandary: he knew that he could reach the Pole in several days, capturing the grail, but if he kept going he would deplete the food the party needed for the return journey and jeopardize the lives of his men, who were already fading. Ultimately, Shackleton made what Worsley considered “the most selfless and astonishing decision ever in the history of polar exploration”—he turned back.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGow envisaged that the new expedition would be composed of descendants of men who had explored alongside Shackleton. They would try to reach Shackleton’s farthest point on January 9, 2009—exactly a hundred years after he did—and then press on to the South Pole, completing, in Gow’s words, “unfinished family business.”\n\nWorsley listened in amazement. Here was the chance of a lifetime. He was confident that the Army would grant him a leave for the expedition. And so, like two conspirators, Worsley and Gow began plotting their journey. They needed to find another recruit and to raise four hundred thousand dollars to cover the costs of equipment and travel. And they needed to train: though they had polar exploration in their genes, they had no actual experience.\n\nThey began a ruthless exercise regimen. Each tied tractor tires to a harness around his waist, and then dragged them back and forth across an open field. In 2005, they signed up for the Montane Yukon Arctic Ultra, a race through the icy wilderness of northwest Canada, which is billed as the toughest endurance competition in the world. Temperatures can fall to minus fifty degrees, and participants have had toes and fingers amputated because of frostbite. Newsweek once observed that the event—which scientists have used to study the impact of extreme conditions on the human body—sounded like the “premise for a Jack London novel.”\n\nPhotograph courtesy Will Gow\n\nThere were different categories for the race, and Worsley and Gow entered one that required them to trek on foot for three hundred miles—a third of the distance of their planned South Pole journey—while hauling all their supplies on sleds. They had eight days to complete the race. “Beyond coping with the physical demands, I wanted to see if I had the mental strength,” Worsley wrote, adding, “Any sign of quitting on this short event would spell disaster for the future challenge and, if I did give up . . . I would have to seriously consider my place in the expedition team.”\n\nArmed with flares and swaddled in layers of clothing, they dragged their sleds through dense pine forests and over mountains and across frozen rivers, where Gow’s foot once broke through the ice and into the water. They had been told that if they got wet they had only about five minutes to prevent hypothermia, and Gow quickly lit a fire, dried his foot, and changed his clothing. Onward the men went. Above them, the northern lights cast a haunting green glow.\n\nAfter several days of trekking, Worsley and Gow suffered from sleeplessness and sensory deprivation, and they grew dizzy from hunger. Soon, they began to hallucinate. To keep going, Worsley resorted to “drastic measures,” imagining that he was pulling his sick daughter on the sled and had to get her to the doctor if she were to live. He and Gow slumped across the finish line, beating the time limit by several hours. “That was really the first test,” Gow recalled.\n\nIn 2006, two years before the planned expedition, Worsley was dispatched to Helmand Province, in Afghanistan, to provide “eyes and ears,” as he put it, before British forces were deployed to the region. He took with him his dog-eared copy of “The Heart of the Antarctic,” Shackleton’s account of the Nimrod expedition; paints and brushes and a sewing kit; and a bag of cricket bats and balls, to play with the locals. For months, he travelled across Helmand, conferring with tribal elders and mullahs. Worsley later wrote in an article, “Surviving in Afghanistan was as much about an empathy with the people and their culture as it was about troop numbers and firepower.”\n\nAfter gathering intelligence, he warned his superiors that the arrival of British forces risked “stirring up a hornets’ nest” by agitating the population and provoking violent reprisals from the Taliban. His words were prophetic. “Henry, rightly, foresaw the trouble that was to come,” Tom Tugendhat, a member of the British Parliament, later told a reporter. But, at the time, Worsley’s alarms rankled many military and political leaders who were downplaying the dangers to the public, and, if Worsley had any remaining hope of military advancement, his candor ended it. Yet he was no longer disappointed. In a commonplace book, he jotted down the advice Shackleton had given after the sinking of the Endurance: “A man must shape himself to a new mark directly the old one goes to ground.” And it occurred to Worsley that had he been promoted he would not have had the time to prepare for the upcoming expedition and become the explorer that he had always wanted to be. “He suddenly realized that he could fulfill some dreams,” Joanna recalled.\n\nBy the time Worsley returned from Afghanistan, Gow had found a third recruit: Henry Adams, a thirty-two-year-old shipping lawyer. Adams seemed a bit pale and spindly for an explorer, but he had a genial personality, and he was deeply committed. What’s more, he was the great-grandson of Jameson Boyd Adams, the second-in-command on the Nimrod expedition.\n\nThat April, Worsley and his two companions headed to Baffin Island, a Canadian territory nine hundred miles west of Greenland. For several weeks, they trained with Matty McNair, a fifty-four-year-old American explorer, who, in 1997, had led the first all-female expedition to the North Pole. This was the men’s longest exposure yet to polar conditions, and they made embarrassing blunders. They forgot to turn off a portable stove, and nearly engulfed their tent in flames. They skied too slowly and never seemed to navigate along a straight line. One day, after Worsley declined to wear tinted goggles, he suffered from snow blindness. But he and the others learned from their mistakes, and emerged with a better understanding, as Adams put it, of how “to live on the ice.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe trip, however, had brought to a head a simmering problem: the team’s lack of clear leadership. Gow was ostensibly in charge, but the expedition was plagued by disorganization, causing tension among the men; moreover, only a fraction of the necessary funds had been raised. In their tent on Baffin Island, Worsley broached the matter with Gow, threatening to drop out of the expedition if things didn’t change. “Henry didn’t dodge bullets,” Adams recalled. After some consideration, Gow asked Worsley to take charge. “With his military background, it made very good sense,” Gow recalled. “Adams and myself were young whippersnappers. We were quite happy to have some wise old owl leading us away.”\n\nIn the two years before their departure, Worsley was consumed with the mission. Late at night, after completing his Army duties, he wrote letters seeking meetings with potential donors. “If he got his foot in the door, he would usually come out with money,” his son, Max, recalled. “His passion and his fire—you could see it within him. It gripped people.”\n\nLike a general developing a plan of attack, Worsley spent hours poring over maps, laying out a precise route for the expedition. The more he studied Antarctica, the more forbidding it seemed. The continent is nearly five and a half million square miles—larger than Europe—and it doubles in size in winter, when its coastal waters freeze over. Approximately ninety-eight per cent of Antarctica is covered in an ice sheet, which rises and drops and bends over the varied topography. The sheet—which, in places, is fifteen thousand feet thick—contains about seventy per cent of the freshwater, and ninety per cent of the ice, on Earth.\n\nYet Antarctica is classified as a desert, because there is so little precipitation. It is the driest and highest continent, with an average elevation of seventy-five hundred feet. It is also the windiest, with gusts reaching up to two hundred miles per hour, and the coldest, with temperatures in the interior falling below minus seventy-five degrees. (Scientists have used the Antarctic to test spacesuits for Mars, where the average surface temperature is minus sixty-seven.)\n\nWorsley, Gow, and Adams planned to begin their journey south of New Zealand, on Ross Island. The island is bound by the Ross Ice Shelf, which extends over the Ross Sea and is the largest body of floating ice in the world—more than a hundred and eighty thousand square miles and, on average, more than a thousand feet thick. Because the Ross Ice Shelf is easier to reach by sea during the summer than other parts of the continent, and because it is relatively smooth and stretches nearly six hundred miles toward the heart of Antarctica, it was the starting point for expeditions to the South Pole during the golden age of Antarctic exploration. Shackleton and Scott and Amundsen all began their expeditions on the shelf.\n\nLike these explorers, Worsley and his team would head south across the ice shelf, a journey of nearly four hundred nautical miles, until they reached the Transantarctic Mountains, which divide the continent and extend to the Weddell Sea. To get to the Polar Plateau—an elevated, almost featureless part of the continental ice shelf, where the South Pole is situated—the party would have to cross these mountains, which rise nearly fifteen thousand feet. On the Nimrod expedition, Shackleton discovered one of the few passable routes: a glacier-covered valley, twenty-five miles wide and a hundred and twenty-five miles long, that runs between the mountains like a frozen causeway. “There burst upon our vision an open road to the South,” Shackleton wrote.\n\nStill, the glacier—which Shackleton named Beardmore, after William Beardmore, a Scottish industrialist and a patron of his expedition—is treacherous. Its elevation is eight thousand feet, and its surface is riddled with crevasses. The last of Shackleton’s Manchurian ponies had disappeared into one. When Scott crossed the glacier during his later expedition, one of his men suffered a fatal head injury after falling into a crevasse. Only a dozen people—the same number that have walked on the moon—had trekked the length of the glacier. Worsley referred to it as his “nemesis.”\n\nIf he and his companions survived the crossing, they would emerge on the Polar Plateau, where they would ascend the ten-thousand-foot-high Titan Dome to reach Shackleton’s farthest point: 88° 23' S, 162° E. Finally, Worsley’s party would trek the remaining ninety-seven nautical miles to the Pole, whose elevation is ninety-three hundred feet.\n\n“Every spare hour was devoted to the project and ‘bloody Shackleton’ became a phrase frequently used by the children,” Worsley wrote. By October of 2008, he and his colleagues were ready to embark on what had been officially named the Matrix Shackleton Centenary Expedition. Before leaving, Worsley and his family gathered for an early Christmas celebration. Even though Henry had been telling Joanna for years about the glories of Antarctica, it still seemed to her like the most dreadful place in the world. Yet she believed that, to borrow Thomas Pynchon’s words, “Everyone has an Antarctic”—someplace people seek to find answers about themselves. In the case of her husband, it was the Antarctic itself. And so she gave her blessing to the adventure, even though it threatened to take from her the man she loved.\n\nWorsley’s decision was harder for his children to understand. Alicia, who was twelve, saw his sled primarily as an object to play on. When the family exchanged Christmas gifts, Max, who was fourteen, seemed agitated. This was different from when his father was deployed by the military—he had not had a choice then about leaving them behind. This was a response to some mysterious inner calling. Max had written a poem about Antarctica, a place that now loomed in his own imagination, and he composed a short essay about his father’s upcoming journey. “I have heard many stories about Shackleton since I was very young and as I grew older, I started to understand and admire Shackleton more,” he wrote. “I am very happy for my Dad that he is doing what he has always wanted to do, but I am also worried for him. Even in the most barren place in the world there is a risk of falling down a glacier or crevasse.”\n\nJoanna drove her husband to the airport, where she began to cry. He told her not to worry, and quoted Shackleton: “Better a live donkey than a dead lion.”\n\nV. Get Wet and You Die\n\nOn October 30, 2008, Worsley, Gow, and Adams arrived in Punta Arenas, on the southern tip of Chile. They went to a warehouse owned by a company named Antarctic Logistics & Expeditions. During the summer, between thirty thousand and forty-five thousand tourists visit the continent, nearly all of them travelling on small cruise ships. Worsley’s party had hired A.L.E. to provide logistical support, which included transporting them by airplane to their starting point on Ross Island.\n\nAt the warehouse, Worsley and his companions collected freeze-dried meals for the expedition. They faced the same predicament that had bedevilled polar explorers for generations: they could haul only so many supplies on their sleds, a situation that left them vulnerable to starvation. Shackleton, during the Nimrod expedition, wrote ruefully, “How one wishes for time and unlimited provisions. Then indeed we could penetrate the secrets of this great lonely continent.”\n\nWorsley estimated that the journey would take nine weeks. Each of the men would be limited to about three hundred and ten pounds of provisions, including a sled, and so they whittled down their kit to the essentials. Worsley packed his portion of the food, which was sealed in ten bags—one for each week of the journey, plus an extra in case of emergency. His clothing included two pairs of pants, a fleece shirt, a down jacket with a hood, gloves, a neck gaiter, a face mask, two pairs of long johns, and three pairs of socks. He brought cross-country skis and poles; for climbing, he carried crampons and ropes. As the only member of the team with first-aid training, he transported the medical bag, which contained antibiotics, syringes, splints, and morphine. He made room for his diary and a copy of “The Heart of the Antarctic.” And he carefully stored what he considered the most vital piece of equipment: a satellite phone with solar-powered batteries, which would allow the men not only to record short audio dispatches but also to check in every day with an A.L.E. operator and report their coördinates and medical condition. If the team failed to communicate for two consecutive days, A.L.E. would dispatch a search-and-rescue plane—what Worsley called “the most expensive taxi ride in the world.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe men permitted themselves the luxury of iPods, as well as a deck of cards and a few mementos. Worsley carried an envelope filled with notes from family and friends, which Joanna had given him to open when he needed encouragement. In his front pocket, he had tucked away one more precious object: the brass compass that Shackleton used on his expedition. Alexandra Shackleton had asked Worsley to bring it with him, hoping that, this time, it would reach the South Pole.\n\nFor Worsley, getting closer to Shackleton was a way of getting closer to himself. During an interview with an exploration Web site, he outlined the qualities that he most admired in Shackleton, including his “optimism and patience,” his “courage,” and his ability, when his men’s lives were at stake, to instill in them the “confidence that he would get them out of the desperate situation.”\n\nCommanding the expedition was far trickier than commanding soldiers in the military. In Antarctica, his authority was not official but merely granted, and he had no more experience as a polar explorer than his peers did. Yet he felt the immeasurable weight of being responsible for their lives. He now formed a pact with Gow and Adams: “There would be no egos, no pride and if someone was feeling unwell or traveling slowly, then he should have no difficulty in accepting the offer from one of the others to carry some of his weight.”\n\nOn November 10th, the A.L.E. plane was ready for departure. After decades of dreaming, Worsley’s Antarctic journey was beginning.\n\nThe plane—an enormous Soviet-designed freighter, which was so loud that Worsley and the others could barely hear their own voices—took them to an A.L.E. camp on the side of Antarctica that is south of Cape Horn, a flight of four and a half hours. On arrival, they skidded onto a runway of ice. After waiting for the weather to clear, they boarded a smaller, twin-propeller aircraft with landing skis. As they flew across the continent, they peered out the window at deep gashes in the ice sheet below. “Everywhere we looked, there were crevasse fields the size of a small parish,” Worsley wrote. “What we were about to undertake was brought sharply into focus in those few moments. None of us said a word.” Finally, after flying eleven hours and more than twelve hundred miles to the southwest, the plane touched down on the sea ice by Ross Island. “My God, we’ve made it,” Worsley exclaimed.\n\nFor years, he had been constructing Antarctica in his mind, and after climbing down from the plane he joyously stamped his boots on three-foot-thick ice. The temperature was about minus fourteen degrees, and his nostrils burned. It was late in the afternoon, but because it was summer the sun remained bright, and he could see two of the volcanoes on Ross Island that had been beacons for polar explorers: Mt. Terror, which is more than ten thousand feet high, and dormant, and Mt. Erebus, an active volcano, which is more than twelve thousand feet high. Black smoke drifted from its icy cone.\n\nNot far from the men, penguins slid on their bellies across the ice—the world not yet deadened. And on the southern tip of the island, about twenty-two miles away, was McMurdo Station, which was opened by the U.S. government in 1955 and has served since then as a hub for scientific research. In the summer, around a thousand people live at the base, the largest population in Antarctica. With its power station and its dormitories carved into the ice, the base has the look of a grimy truck stop.\n\nThe men headed onto the island. As they climbed a ridge overlooking a bowl-shaped valley, Worsley came to an abrupt halt. Down below, amid volcanic rock and ice, was a solitary wooden hut with shuttered windows and an iron chimney. Worsley didn’t need to say what it was. They all knew. It was the hut that Shackleton and his party had built in February, 1908, and stayed in that winter, before setting out for the South Pole. Shackleton had called the shelter “the Mecca of all our hopes and dreams.” In 2004, a team of conservationists had begun restoring the hut, and to Worsley it looked just as it had in the grainy photograph in “The Heart of the Antarctic.”\n\nGow raced over and opened the door, and Worsley and Adams followed him inside. In the dimness, Worsley could discern the scattered debris of the Nimrod expedition, as if the party had momentarily stepped away. There were canned goods, leather boots with frayed laces, and blue bottles of medicine marked “diarrhea.” Two sleds were suspended in the rafters, and hanging on a wall was a framed photograph of Queen Alexandra. Shackleton, in his diary, had described a shaft of light passing over the image before they set out on their trek, which he had deemed “an omen of good luck.”\n\nGow gasped at the ghostly scene. Adams found the bunk where his great-grandfather had slept, while Worsley examined the dark recesses of the room as if he were rummaging through a tomb. “I could hardly get closer to my mentor,” he later wrote. “The only thing left to do was to walk in his footsteps to the Pole.”\n\nPhotograph courtesy Shackleton Foundation\n\nThat night, the men camped inside the hut, lying on the frozen ground in their sleeping bags. The silence among them betrayed their nerves. The next morning, November 14th, Worsley was the first to get up. “It had been impossible to sleep,” he noted. “The enormity of the task seemed overwhelming.” He put on his boots, slipped outside the tent, and called the A.L.E. operator. “The Matrix Shackleton Expedition calling in with our first report,” he said. “We are setting off in a couple hours. All is well. No medical problems.”\n\n“O.K.,” the operator replied. “Have a great journey.”\n\nWorsley’s companions had awakened, and the three men began mummifying themselves in layers of clothing and loading their provisions onto their sleds. Worsley made sure to distribute the weight evenly on his sled, and he covered his cargo with a tarp. The sled—which was emblazoned with the words “Always a little further” and “By Endurance We Conquer”—resembled a torpedo. After attaching the sled to a harness around his waist, Worsley clipped his boots into his skis, seeing the messages that his family had painted on them: “Don’t give up,” “Push it, fat ass.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt 10 a.m.—the hour that Shackleton had set out—Worsley and his men leaned into their harnesses and began their trek. This was the moment that he’d been waiting for nearly all his life, Worsley thought. Yet, as he strained with his arms and his legs to propel himself forward and drag the heavy sled, he was gnawed by doubts: “I was nervous about lots of things; of failing the team; of getting injured; of letting down all those people who had supported us; of plainly not being physically up for it—put simply, I feared failure.”\n\nThe surface was generally flat and smooth, and as he and the other men headed south, toward the Ross Ice Shelf, they began to gather some momentum. Worsley made sure that they followed the advice of Matty McNair, who had instructed them on Baffin Island: “Stay together, never separate.” She had drummed into them one other rule: “If you get wet, you die.”\n\nAfter several miles, they came upon another desolate wooden hut. Robert Falcon Scott and his men had built it in 1911, on their fateful South Pole expedition. Ice crept over the timbered walls and glazed the windowpanes like jungle vines. Inside the hut, Worsley and his companions found the chart table where Scott had studied his maps, and the bunk belonging to Captain Lawrence Oates, who had left the party’s tent on the return journey from the Pole, saying, “I am just going outside and may be some time.” He was never seen again.\n\nAs Worsley inspected the objects, he felt uneasy: “I couldn’t shake the sense of pathetic sadness from my mind.” The men quickly resumed tracing the path of their forebears, which had long since been obliterated by the windswept ice. The fresh tracks made by Worsley and his companions gradually vanished as well; tiny granules of ice swirled in the wind like ash. The men used a compass to maintain a southward trajectory. Their breath smoked and their bodies sweated in the arid cold. After slogging for seven hours, Worsley gave the order to stop for the day. They had covered nearly eight nautical miles. In order to reach the ninety-seven-mile mark on January 9th, the men would need to average between ten and twelve nautical miles per day. But it was a promising start.\n\nThey began the cumbersome process of making camp: pitching their tent, which was roughly fourteen feet long and seven feet wide; gathering provisions from the sled; squeezing inside the shelter and removing their ski boots and sweaty socks, which they hung on a clothesline above their heads, along with any other damp items; checking their bodies for frostbite and putting on dry socks and tent “booties”; and firing up a gas cooker, melting snow in a kettle, and pouring hot water into packets of freeze-dried meals.\n\nAs the men ate, they talked about the relatively warm weather—the temperature had reached fourteen degrees. Adams delivered the evening broadcast, reporting that they had been blessed with “beautiful sunshine, exactly as Shackleton had a hundred years ago on his first day.” Privately, though, Adams confessed to Worsley and Gow that he felt like an amateur hauling his sled, and had a deep sense of unease. “He was right and honest,” Worsley wrote. “None of us knew what the next two months were going to be like.”\n\nAs Worsley and his companions continued toward the Pole, they were no longer following in Shackleton’s steps. To their relief, they began descending in altitude, their sleds, lightened from the consumption of food, scooting easily behind them. After eight days, they had covered ninety-two nautical miles, a reminder of just how close Shackleton had been to realizing his dream. That night, Worsley went for his stroll, wobbling on bone-thin legs. He was not a religious man, but the landscape stirred him. As Adams put it, “Henry felt the spirituality of the Antarctic.”\n\nThe next morning, the men broke camp, and embarked on the remaining five nautical miles. In the distance, they could finally see a signpost: the smudged outline of the Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station, a U.S. scientific-research base. After a few hours, Worsley noticed that his skis were moving in tracks that had been etched by snowmobiles. Then he saw, dumped in a pile on the ice, a broken washing machine, a mattress, and crushed boxes. The scentless air became infused with the sharp odors of fried food and petroleum; occasionally, a military plane roared overhead. “We had been thrust back into the world we had left behind,” Worsley wrote.\n\nIn front of the research station, protruding from the ice, was a gleaming metal rod, about waist-high, topped with a brass globe. Scientists at the base used it as a marker of the South Pole—the place where all the lines of longitude converge, and where the Earth doesn’t rotate. Because the rod was planted on a shifting ice sheet, it had to be moved several feet each year, to return to the Pole’s precise location.\n\nOn January 18th, at 4:32 p.m., after sixty-six days, Worsley and his companions—emaciated, with icicles dripping from their beards—reached out and grasped the rod. As the journey had approached its end, Worsley had felt tears freezing under his eyes: he had not experienced such joy and relief since he was a little boy. But now Worsley, whom Adams called an “absolute bang-on natural leader,” laughed and hollered and embraced the others. Only a few years earlier, they had been strangers, yet they had learned to trust one another with their lives. What’s more, Worsley believed, they had mastered the seemingly impossible by adhering to the lessons of Shackleton; they had conquered through endurance. In a broadcast, Worsley announced, “I’m calling you from ninety degrees south, the South Pole!” Then he took out Shackleton’s compass, lifted the lid, and let the needle spin to a stop.\n\nVI. The Infinite Beyond\n\nWorsley didn’t think that he would ever go back to Antarctica again. He happily returned to the Army and relished being with his family. But he gradually began to feel again the “lure of little voices.” In his commonplace book, he wrote down a quote, from the Norwegian polar explorer Fridtjof Nansen, that seemed to address his own compulsion to subject himself to more suffering: “Why? On account of the great geographical discoveries, the important scientific results? Oh no; that will come later, for the few specialists. This is something all can understand. A victory of human mind and human strength over the dominion and powers of Nature; a deed that lifts us above the great monotony of daily life; a view over shining plains, with lofty mountains against the cold blue sky, and lands covered by ice-sheets of inconceivable extent . . . the triumph of the living over the stiffened realm of death.”\n\nListen to Henry Worsley’s dispatch, Day 66\n\nPhotograph courtesy Joanna Worsley\n\nIn 2012, Worsley launched a new expedition, to mark the centennial of the race between Amundsen and Scott to the South Pole. Gow and Adams, who had married and settled down with families, declined to go, and so Worsley drew recruits from the military. He and a partner, Lou Rudd, followed the trail of Amundsen and raced against another party, which took the route of Scott. Once more, Worsley proved an extraordinary commander—Rudd called him a “true inspiration”—and they won the nine-hundred-mile contest, which raised nearly three hundred thousand dollars for a Royal British Legion fund that assists wounded soldiers.\n\nWorsley had become the first person to trace the two classic routes to the South Pole. Outside hailed him as “one of the great polar explorers of our time,” and a reporter described him as a “pioneer of the possible.” Worsley, who had recently published “In Shackleton’s Footsteps,” gave lectures on exploration and leadership, becoming that rare apostle whose life seems to affirm his master’s teachings.\n\nIn 2013, he was stationed in Washington, D.C., as the British liaison to U.S. Special Operations Forces. It was his final military posting: in October of 2015, after more than three and a half decades of service, he would be fifty-five, at that time the mandatory retirement age. Joanna had accompanied him to the States, and she sensed his mind drifting. “Are you doing another expedition?” she asked.\n\nHe said that the centenary of Shackleton’s Endurance expedition would coincide with his retirement, and that he was considering an attempt of the trans-Antarctica crossing that Shackleton had planned before the sinking of his ship. What’s more, Worsley hoped to make the nine-hundred-nautical-mile journey by himself, and without assistance, something that had never been done. Paul Rose, a former base commander for the British Antarctic Survey, which conducts scientific research in the region, called such a trek “unheard of,” and another explorer deemed it an “almost inhuman challenge.” For Worsley, the expedition represented the culmination of all his energies. Not only would it be his longest, hardest, and most punishing quest; he would have to survive entirely on his own wits.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHenry, though, told Joanna that he would return to Antarctica only if she approved. He was sensitive to the toll that his expeditions had taken on their family. He often struggled to express his emotions—the tumult that he had kept masked, even as it drove him—and in his book he had included a passage that seemed intended for his family, a way to convey what he could not say directly. “Looking back now, I realize that I lost track of where my real priorities should lie,” he wrote. “I can see now that I was not dividing up the time sensibly and making my family feel important and special.” He went on, “Passion for something can so easily tip into obsession, which is a dangerous thing, especially when those affected are the very people who so loyally ‘stand and wait.’ ”\n\nJoanna, who often joked that the Antarctic was her husband’s “mistress,” had expected that, upon his retirement, they would no longer be apart. But she had never tried to limit his aspirations—“He went with my blessings everywhere,” she once told a reporter—and she understood how much the proposed trip meant to him. And Henry wasn’t just doing it for himself—he hoped to raise a hundred thousand dollars for the Endeavour Fund, the other charity for injured soldiers. As he later put it, “I want to leave a financial legacy to assist my wounded mates.” And so she gave Worsley her backing. The children were equally supportive. Max, who would be twenty-one by the time of the expedition, and who was helping to build ships in the South of France, had come to terms with his father’s adventurist spirit, and even lionized him for it. They talked about eventually doing a polar journey together. “Everyone dreams, but Dad’s the guy who goes out and achieves them,” Max said.\n\nIn the fall of 2015, before Henry departed on the expedition, he and Joanna travelled to Greece. While visiting ancient sites and drinking wine at tavernas, they plotted out the things they would do when he returned. They would go to India and teach underprivileged children, and travel to Venice, where he could study art and she could do charity work. Max recalled, “Mom was waiting twenty-five years for the moment when he left the Army and they could do these things together.”\n\nWorsley no longer journeyed in obscurity, and his plan received admiring news coverage. “intrepid ex-army officer is set for antarctic trek,” the Glasgow Herald announced. A Washington Post headline declared that Worsley would be “all alone on the coldest continent.” Worsley was interviewed by National Geographic and by the BBC, whose announcer said, “You must be mad to do it.” Prince William invited Worsley to Kensington Palace and signed a Union Jack for him to carry with him on his trip, which was similar to the one that King George V had given to Shackleton before he departed.\n\nOn October 20th, Joanna drove him to Heathrow Airport. She was more worried about this expedition than any other, given his age and the lack of help. In a video that Worsley posted on his Web site, he had spoken of the risks of journeying solo. The biggest threat, he said, was falling into a crevasse: no one could pull him out or call for rescue. The other major threats, he said, were a “severe medical injury” and “severe weather.” But he believed that his meticulous preparations would mitigate the risks. While travelling alone, he noted, “there is no one there to compare thoughts with and seek their opinions on, but I want to do this on my own.” He later put the matter even more starkly: “Success or failure of this journey is completely up to me.”\n\nAt the terminal, Joanna broke down, and he repeated what he always told her: “Better a live donkey than a dead lion.” Then he kissed her and said, “Onwards!”\n\nThis time, Worsley’s route was to begin on Berkner Island, an icebound chunk of rock off the Atlantic coast of Antarctica, south of Chile. From there, he would trek five hundred and seventy nautical miles to the South Pole. Then, heading in the reverse direction from the one he had followed with Gow and Adams, he would ascend the Titan Dome and make his way down to the rim of the Ross Ice Shelf, on the Pacific side. This second section would cover three hundred and thirty nautical miles, and he estimated that the expedition would take him nearly eighty days. He was determined to finish before February, when winter set in and the conditions became too perilous for a rescue plane to land; even A.L.E. shut down in winter. At that point, there would be no exit.\n\nWorsley had hoped to fly to Antarctica shortly after arriving in Punta Arenas, on October 21st. But foul weather—“our lord and master at the moment,” as he called it—forced A.L.E. to delay his flight for a week, and then another. “Greetings from Patience Camp,” he reported on his broadcast. “Unfortunately, this is Patience Camp in Chile.”\n\nBy the time he reached Berkner Island, on November 13th, he was significantly behind schedule. He would need to arrive at the South Pole by January 1, 2016—a gruelling pace. Within moments of exiting the plane, he was packing his sled, which, because of the length of the journey, weighed three hundred and twenty-five pounds—even more than on his expedition with Gow and Adams. “Really worried about weight,” he had written earlier, in his diary. Noting that “anxiety builds,” he reminded himself that he needed to “banish negative thoughts.”\n\nHe pushed off, and heard a familiar symphony: the poles crunching on the ice, the sled creaking over ridges, the skis swishing back and forth. When he paused, he was greeted by that silence which seemed unlike any other. His doubts soon dissipated, and after a brief baptismal trek he made camp. The sun was shining and the temperature was a balmy nineteen degrees. “So, so happy to be back,” he wrote in his diary. “Many days of struggle ahead but a glorious start. My spirits lifted as soon as I got going. I thought, ‘I can do this.’ ” In his broadcast, he described Antarctica as the “best place on Earth right now.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe next morning, he began what he called his “first full day in the saddle.” He trekked for eight hours, listening to tracks by David Bowie, Johnny Cash, and Meat Loaf and pondering what he might say, upon his return, in a lecture about the trip. He covered a good ten nautical miles, but it was a shock to his system. “First few days really are hell—never forget that,” he wrote. If he focussed on the length of his journey, he would never make it, and so he concentrated on immediate tasks. “It’s just chipping away at it, bit by bit, and dealing with the moment,” he later said on a broadcast. On the third day, after crossing the eighty-first degree of latitude, he convened a one-man meeting of the Malt Whiskey Appreciation Society, downing a shot of liquor, which he had cooled with snow. He knew that more and more people were following his broadcasts, including schoolchildren—“young explorers,” he called them—and, despite his exhaustion, he took time each evening to relay updates and respond to inquiries that had been sent to him. He answered questions about whether he had seen any animal life (“sadly not”), about his favorite freeze-dried meal (spaghetti Bolognese), about his least favorite time of day (preparing to set off in the morning) and his favorite (climbing into his tent after a long march). He was asked which actor should portray him in a movie about his adventures. Admitting that his answer offered a “strong exposé of my vanity,” he suggested Matt Damon for his younger self and Anthony Hopkins for his older self. He even replied to a question about how he went to the loo. “If you need to pee, throw your back to the wind, unzip, and have a pee,” he explained. “Really not a big deal about that. On the other hand, if you need to go No. 2, you need to be a little more organized, particularly if there’s a strong wind, which, generally, there is. This time, you face into the wind. You make sure that you’ve grabbed your outer trousers, your long johns, your pants, and you drop them as quickly as possible.” One evening, after answering several queries, he playfully signed off from “somewhere” in “a complete whiteout.”\n\nPhotograph courtesy Joanna Worsley\n\nBy the end of the first week, he had travelled nearly seventy nautical miles. His body, he reported to listeners, was in remarkably good shape. He’d just enjoyed a hot meal of chicken cacciatore, with rice pudding for dessert. “I am now off to my sleeping bag,” he said.\n\nThen, as on Shackleton’s Endurance expedition, everything began to go wrong. On November 22nd, a little more than a week into his journey, he was engulfed in a whiteout and was pinned down in his tent. “Proper Antarctic storm!” he wrote in his diary, noting that there was no chance of moving forward that day. The next morning, the gusts felt strong enough to hurl a small dog; one of the tent poles broke, and he had to repair it. “A salutary reminder just who is in control around here,” he said of the conditions. “Trespassers will be punished.”\n\nHe emerged on November 24th, and found himself plowing through a dust bowl of ice in which all he could see, hour after hour, was his compass strapped to his chest and his skis with their metronomic rhythm—an experience that he described as “miserable, mind-numbing, monochromatic monotony.” He was ascending a section of the Transantarctic Mountains, and on November 25th he came upon a steep slope of ice that rose hundreds of feet. He tried to climb with his crampons but the sled wouldn’t move. Again, he tried. Again, it wouldn’t budge.\n\nIf he didn’t keep moving, he would freeze. He decided to lighten his sled, and unloaded most of his bags of food and stored them on a flat part of the ice. Then he began to climb. When he reached the top of the ridge, gasping for air behind his face mask, he deposited what he’d dragged up. After a short rest, he scaled back down to retrieve the rest. He made trip after trip.\n\nOnce, in the poor visibility, he failed to notice the scar of a crevasse and his foot broke through the surface. He felt himself slipping into the hole, which was widening around him. He grabbed the edge and clung to it, dangling over an abyss, before he hauled himself up. When he peered into the chasm, he wrote in his diary, he “suddenly felt very alone, vulnerable and scared.”\n\nHis body was weakening more rapidly than on his previous expeditions. Not only was the sled heavier; he constantly had to break track, and he had to carry out alone the tiresome tasks of making camp each night and packing up in the morning.\n\nOn November 30th, after trekking for nearly three weeks and traversing a hundred and sixty-five nautical miles, he reported that he had “aching shoulders, lower-back pain, very snotty nose . . . and coughing due to breathing in cold air.” He developed a rash on his groin. His feet were covered in bruises and blisters, and he took a knife to his boots, hoping to smooth the lining and alleviate the pain. One day, he suffered from a mysterious stomach ache, which was aggravated by the sled harness yanking at his waist.\n\nThough he usually maintained a buoyant tone in his broadcast, he was more despairing in his diary. “It was a real physical battle with fatigue,” he wrote, adding, “I was stopping literally every minute or so to catch my breath or just get ready for the next exertion required.” Two nights later, after another whiteout, he lamented that he hadn’t had enough strength “to pull the sledge through” the storm. His diary entries became a litany of suffering: “hard day”; “a very difficult day”; “a brutal day”; “awful day—floundering around in a complete whiteout”; “another awful day—worse than yesterday”; “swimming against a strong tide”; “still swimming against the tide”; “totally spent and demoralized.” Each morning, he unzipped the flap of his tent and peeked out, hoping for clear skies, only to behold what he called “more of the white darkness.” At times, he could not even discern the tips of his skis through the murk, which, he wrote, was as “thick as clotted cream.”\n\nOn December 1st, he marched into what he described as “the mother of all storms.” Trudging uphill, with his head bowed against a fusillade of ice pellets, he moved at less than a mile per hour. After many hours, he abruptly paused. “I sat huddled on my sledge, down jacket on, wondering whether to go or to stop,” he later recalled. It was so windy that he did not know if he could set up his tent, and so he resumed trekking. “My hands took a battering, and often I had to stop to give them some warmth,” he said. “And the light was so flat that on two occasions, immediately after stopping, I fell straight over, such is the disorienting effect it has on your senses.”\n\nThe next day, he blindly skied over a ridge, and the sled overtook him and pulled him down. His head and back and legs slammed against the ice. The sled flipped over twice, dragging him for twenty yards. He lay splattered on the ice, cursing. When he got to his feet, he nervously checked his fuel cannisters. One crack and he would be doomed, but there were none, and, conscious of time slipping away, he untangled his harness and set off again.\n\nAnd incredibly, despite every obstacle and every calamity, he was on track to reach the South Pole around New Year’s Day. Nothing seemed to stop him. One morning, he forged on even when the conditions were so awful that he conceded that it was “crazy” to set off. Another time, he wrote in his diary, “I just can’t go further—I don’t have it in me.” And yet he rose the next day and marched onward. On December 18th, the thirty-sixth day, he walked more than seventeen nautical miles, a remarkable trek that took him fifteen hours. After another punishing day—which he described as a “combination of eating, bending, driving, tying, pushing, bracing, draining, swearing, pausing and despairing”—he told himself, “I just have to accept it and keep moving.”\n\nHis existence had been reduced to a single purpose: making his mileage. When approaching sastrugi, he commanded himself to “attack, attack, attack.” After one such battle, he wrote proudly in his diary that he had stormed “the ramparts of every piece that was unfortunate enough to get in my way.” He added, “The sledge, now a battering ram and not a burden, smashed through all in its path.” When he was asked by his radio listeners how he persevered, he said that it was less about physical prowess than about how “strong your mind and will are—hours at the gym cannot prepare you.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRobert Swan, a British adventurer who had trekked to both poles, was monitoring Worsley’s journey, and expressed awe at his daily progress. In an audio message posted on Worsley’s Web site, on December 5th, Swan said, “His average is fantastic,” adding, “He’s facing some quite odd conditions, but, being Henry, he’s slugging it out.” In a second message, posted later that month, Swan described Worsley proceeding as if a traffic light were glowing in front of him: “Very, very rarely in your mind do you ever see the color green, for the simple reason if you’re in green you’re probably not pushing hard enough. . . . You’re thinking about your feet, your legs, your calves, your hips, your arms, your neck, your shoulders, and you’re constantly doing these checks to see whether everything’s O.K. . . . As Henry has said, as he moves towards those last few hours every day, you can feel that he’s pushing into the red zone. And the red zone is not a place to stay in, because in the red zone your body is starting to eat itself. You’re much more likely to get frostbite. So you live on the edge of the orange, occasionally push into the red, and then, very sensibly, he comes back off the red, back into the orange. And hopefully, when he’s into his sleeping bag and speaking to us, you know he’s back into the green.”\n\nBy Christmas Day, Worsley was nearly within a hundred nautical miles of the Pole. Prince William broadcast a message, saying, “We’re thinking of you at the Christmas period as you’re lugging all your kit up and down the slopes and the hills of the southern Atlantic in the Antarctic.” Worsley opened a package that Joanna and the children had given him. Inside were miniature versions of traditional Christmas sweets: a mincemeat pie and a fruitcake. Alicia had written him a note that quoted lyrics from “The Jungle Book”: “Look for the bare necessities / The simple bare necessities / Forget about your worries and your strife.” And Joanna had included a sample of Amouage Journey Man cologne. “I figured his tent would be so smelly by then,” she recalled.\n\nOn his broadcast, Worsley said, “Packages from home, especially at times like this, no matter where you are in the world, carry special meaning. And none more so for me this morning.”\n\nUsing his satellite phone, he called Joanna and Alicia, in London, and then Max, in France. Throughout the journey, Worsley had made a record in his diary of virtually every communication that he had had with them. Once, after speaking to Joanna, he wrote, “I do love her so much.” Another time, after he received a text from Alicia saying “I am thinking of you constantly, and love you more than ever,” he jotted down, “Sweet text from Shrimp”—his nickname for her. And he noted that a conversation one morning with Max had “lifted my spirits.” On Christmas Day, he wrote in his diary, “Lovely to hear their voices.”\n\nDespite the holiday, Worsley marched twelve nautical miles. As he lay in his tent that night, he lit a cigar, the sweet smoke filling the air, and ate his Christmas treats. It was, he said, like a “little heaven.”\n\nSoon, he was almost at nine thousand feet, the elevation of the South Pole. He was so tired that once, while sitting on his sled during a snack break, he nodded off, even though the wind-chill temperature was minus twenty-two. “I may be drained of all power and energy,” he reported on a broadcast. “But I still seem to have the will that says, to my heart and nerves and sinews, Hold on.” He kept telling himself, “Keep your eyes on the prize.”\n\nOn January 2nd, only a day behind schedule, he reached the Pole. He was greeted by a group of well-wishers from the scientific-research station. They were the first people he had seen in fifty-one days. But this was not the climax of his journey—it was only the end of the first phase—and, because he was making his trek unaided, he couldn’t go inside the base to receive a hot meal or even to take a bath. “It was weird arriving here and not stopping,” he wrote in his diary, adding, “Very tempting to stay at Pole—eat and sleep.” But he set up his camp as usual, maintaining his self-imposed exile.\n\nDuring his broadcast, he told his listeners, “I owe so much to all of you for your support in getting me this far. I cannot emphasize too strongly just how much it has urged me on over the darker days, of which there have been many. But those I have to thank most are Joanna, Max, and Alicia.” His voice cracked. “They have been with me every step of the way, each with a warm hand in the small of my back, lifting me when I am down, strengthening me when I am weak, and filling me when I’m empty. I owe them everything.” He concluded, “At the southerly point where the world spins on—good night.”\n\nIn London, Joanna listened to his broadcasts each evening before falling asleep. Shortly before Christmas, she was interviewed by a reporter from the Daily Express, and she said, “Henry was away abroad a lot in his army days so we’ve been used to separations . . . but I miss him much more now. I do worry about him because I know how frail he is getting—he does lose a huge amount of weight and he has had a really rough time with the weather.” She went on, “He is so determined. In my head I know there’s no way he won’t succeed, even if he has to walk all day and night. He has enormous mental strength.” She was overcome: “He’s an amazing man—isn’t it wonderful to be married to someone like that?”\n\nWorsley estimated that it would take him about three weeks to complete the rest of his journey, and he hoped that the hardest part was behind him. In his diary, he had written, “Just pray going North is that much easier.” Yet, as he climbed the Titan Dome, he found the ascent to be “a killer.” He had lost more than forty pounds, and his unwashed clothing hung on him heavily. “Still very weak—legs are stick thin and arms puny,” he noted in his diary. His eyes had sunk into shaded hollows. His fingers were becoming numb. His Achilles tendons were swollen. His hips were battered and scraped from the constantly jerking harness. He had broken his front tooth biting into a frozen protein bar, and told A.L.E. that he looked like a pirate. He was dizzy from the altitude, and he had bleeding hemorrhoids.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn January 7th, he woke in the middle of the night with another stomach ache. “I felt pretty awful,” he admitted on his broadcast. “The weakest I felt in the entire expedition.” The earbuds on his iPod had broken, leaving him in silence. “I feel alone,” he confessed on a broadcast, adding, “Occasionally, it would be nice to have somebody to talk to about the day.”\n\nHe kept thinking that he would soon reach the top of the Titan Dome. “I’ll be okay if the promised ‘downhill’ materializes,” he wrote in his diary. But the peak eluded him—he was trapped in an infinite beyond. On January 11th, he told his listeners, “I’m desperate to go down and into air thick enough to breathe.”\n\nListening to the broadcasts, Joanna was increasingly concerned. “I felt in his voice this exhaustion and sadness,” she recalled. He had no companion to tell him that he had remained too long in the red zone; nor was he held back by the worry that his actions might jeopardize the lives of others. And he was confident that he could do what he always had done: prevail through unbending will. In his commonplace book, he had once written down a quote, from the cyclist Lance Armstrong, that said, “Losing and dying: it’s the same thing.”\n\nAnd so Worsley pressed on, muttering to himself a line from Tennyson’s poem “Ulysses”: “To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield.” Once, he looked up in the sky and saw, through his frozen goggles, a dazzling sun halo. On the edge of the circle, there were intense bursts of light, as if the sun were being splintered into three fiery balls. He knew that the phenomenon was caused by sunlight being refracted through a scrim of ice particles. Yet, as he stumbled onward through the void, he wondered if the light was actually some guiding spirit, like the “fourth man” that Shackleton had spoken of. Perhaps Worsley, too, had pierced the “veneer of outside things”—or perhaps his mind was simply unravelling. His diary entries had become sparer and darker: “So breathless . . . I am fading . . . hands/fingers are forever shutting down . . . wonder how long they will last.”\n\nOn January 17th, he staggered through a whiteout, pulling his sled for sixteen hours. When he stopped, it was late evening, and he struggled to build his camp again—to plant the tent poles in the ice, to unload his food, to light the cooker, to melt snow for water. “It’s now one o’clock in the morning,” he said in his broadcast. “In sum, it’s been a punishing day.” He continued, “What little energy I have left . . .” His voice faded in and out.\n\nJoanna panicked upon hearing the broadcast. She called many of Worsley’s close friends, asking if someone should ask A.L.E. to dispatch a rescue plane. They thought that Worsley would be O.K., given his experience and abilities, and that he should be the one to make such a call. Robert Swan, in one of his earlier broadcasts, had noted that Worsley had on his belt “a wonderful, unbelievable” Iridium satellite telephone, adding, “If he does have a problem, he can hit the button and get some support and rescue very, very quickly.”"
