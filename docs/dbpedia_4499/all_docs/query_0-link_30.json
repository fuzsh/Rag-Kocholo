        "text": "Article content\n\nFor most Vancouverites, despite our ocean setting, Jaws is about as close as we’ve ever been to a shark — and it was mechanical.\n\nWe’ve spotted seals near the docks at Granville Island, and whales and dolphins while sailing on B.C. Ferries, but sharks — big ones, anyway — are something you only see while diving in the tropics, right?\n\nWrong.\n\nThe Department of Fisheries and Oceans Canada has documented 14 species of sharks — from the tiny two-foot brown cat shark to the mammoth, but harmless, 33-foot plankton-eating basking shark — lurking in the coastal waters of British Columbia.\n\nAdvertisement 2\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nTHIS CONTENT IS RESERVED FOR SUBSCRIBERS ONLY\n\nSubscribe now to read the latest news in your city and across Canada.\n\nUnlimited online access to articles from across Canada with one account.\n\nGet exclusive access to the Vancouver Sun ePaper, an electronic replica of the print edition that you can share, download and comment on.\n\nEnjoy insights and behind-the-scenes analysis from our award-winning journalists.\n\nSupport local journalists and the next generation of journalists.\n\nDaily puzzles including the New York Times Crossword.\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO UNLOCK MORE ARTICLES\n\nSubscribe now to read the latest news in your city and across Canada.\n\nUnlimited online access to articles from across Canada with one account.\n\nGet exclusive access to the Vancouver Sun ePaper, an electronic replica of the print edition that you can share, download and comment on.\n\nEnjoy insights and behind-the-scenes analysis from our award-winning journalists.\n\nSupport local journalists and the next generation of journalists.\n\nDaily puzzles including the New York Times Crossword.\n\nREGISTER / SIGN IN TO UNLOCK MORE ARTICLES\n\nCreate an account or sign in to continue with your reading experience.\n\nAccess articles from across Canada with one account.\n\nShare your thoughts and join the conversation in the comments.\n\nEnjoy additional articles per month.\n\nGet email updates from your favourite authors.\n\nSign In or Create an Account\n\nEmail Address\n\nor\n\nArticle content\n\nAlso included in the list of 14 B.C. sharks is — gasp — the great white shark. The 19-foot monster with its triangle-shaped serrated teeth does indeed venture into B.C. waters, but the DFO admits it’s a rare occurrence when the big fish makes its way up here from the warmer California waters. The National Marine Fisheries Service estimates there is a growing population of about 3,000 white sharks in the eastern North Pacific.\n\nWilliam Cheung, associate professor at the Institute for the Oceans and Fisheries at UBC, says with oceans warming due to climate change we can expect more tropical sharks like the great white to visit northern waters in the coming few decades.\n\n“Based on my team’s computer simulation modelling, we found that climate change will cause an expansion of the range of great white shark to northern temperature areas, including the offshore waters of the northeast Pacific, which includes B.C.,” Cheung said. “If you look at the coast of California, it is expected that the types of species we see there could be in B.C. waters if we maintain at the status quo and do not mitigate carbon emissions. Species in California include the oceanic whitetip shark, and the great white shark. In the Atlantic, we would expect to see great whites along the coast of Newfoundland. Currently, they have been recorded, but sightings are rare.”\n\nArticle content\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nThat’s not to say we don’t have any big predator sharks who are permanent residents. Salmon sharks, stout 10-footers with sharp “awl-like” teeth, are very common around these parts.\n\nWhile they feed on salmon and other bony fish, there has been at least one reported — but widely discounted — attack on a human.\n\nIn 2012, Campbell River’s Kaitlin Dakers was surfing off Tofino when she suffered severe cuts to two of her fingers. She said a doctor at the Tofino hospital and the surgeon in Campbell River who patched her up both said the cuts were from a very sharp, very quick bite.\n\nA salmon shark was blamed. However, Nick Dulvy, a professor at SFU who specializes in studying sharks and is the current Canada Research Chair in Marine Biodiversity and Conservation, doubted it.\n\n“The reality is that this shark has never been implicated in an attack on a human being, and there’s never, ever been a shark attack in Canada,” Dulvy told the Vancouver Sun at the time. “There are way more (people) killed by strikes of lightning in North America each year, and there are way more people killed by falling television sets each year than they are killed by shark attacks.”\n\nAdvertisement 4\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nDulvy said it was more likely that Dakers was bitten by a seal, while veteran surfers claimed the injury could have been caused by her finger getting caught in her board’s leash.\n\nOther common sharks in B.C. waters include the brown cat shark, blue shark (10 feet), Pacific sleeper shark (14 feet), sixgill shark (16 feet), spiny dogfish (five feet), and tope (soupfin) shark (6.5 feet).\n\nSharks listed as rare, or infrequent to B.C. waters, include the great white, sevengill shark (10 feet), bigeye thresher (14 feet), shortfin mako shark (13 feet), greeneye shark (1.5 feet) and the extremely rare basking shark.\n\nThe endangered basking shark, the biggest and rarest fish on Canada’s west coast and second largest fish in the world behind the whale shark, was photographed in 2013 by marine researcher Wendy Szaniszlo on the Canadian Coast Guard’s 58-metre research ship W.E. Ricker off Brooks Peninsula on the west coast of Vancouver Island.\n\nThe gentle giant was nearly wiped out in an act of shark genocide by the federal government.\n\n“Half a century ago Ottawa fitted sharp blades to the bows of its vessels to deliberately kill as many basking sharks as possible for interfering with commercial fishing nets on the B.C. coast,” Vancouver Sun reporter Larry Pynn wrote in 2013.\n\nAdvertisement 5\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nOnce there were as many 3,000 to 5,000 basking sharks in B.C., but thanks to a liver oil fishery (1941-1947) and the federal eradication program (1945-1970), the number has dropped to “only a few,” according to the DFO.\n\n“There were a total of eight reported sightings of basking sharks on the B.C. coast from April to September this year, mostly off the west coast of Vancouver Island but also as far north as Haida Gwaii. In addition to the one confirmed, two sightings were considered reliable,” Pynn wrote.\n\nA 25-foot basking shark was spotted in Puget Sound near Seattle in 2014.\n\nSharks found in B.C. waters (from Department of Fisheries and Oceans Canada):\n\nSALMON SHARK\n\nLamna ditropis\n\n• Pelagic (surface to 375 m)\n\n• Length to 3 m (10 feet)\n\n• Short, heavy body; short snout\n\n• Black or dark grey on the top; abrupt change to white blotches below\n\n• Two horizontal keels just prior to tail fin\n\n• Awl-like teeth with small sharp denticles on each shoulder of the main point.\n\nBROWN CAT SHARK\n\nApristurus brunneus\n\n• Pelagic and demersal (33-950 m)\n\n• Length to 68 cm (2.2 feet)\n\n• Light or medium brown\n\n• Dark margins on fins\n\n• First dorsal fin has posterior position over pelvic fin\n\n• Two dorsal fins of equal size\n\nAdvertisement 6\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nBLUE SHARK\n\nPrionace glauca\n\n• Surface waters\n\n• Length to 3 m (10 feet)\n\n• Dark indigo blue on back shading through clear bright blue on sides to white below\n\n• Notable for the long sabre-like pectoral fin\n\n• Well developed snout; slender body form\n\nSPINY DOGFISH\n\nSqualus acanthias\n\n• Pelagic and demersal (surface to 1460 m)\n\n• Length to 1.6 m (5 feet)\n\n• Slate grey to brown on top, white to light grey below\n\n• Two dorsal fins with spine in front of each\n\n• No anal fin\n\nPACIFIC SLEEPER SHARK\n\nSomniosus pacificus\n\n• Midwater and demersal (surface to 245 m)\n\n• Length to 4.3 m (14 feet)\n\n• Blackish brown all over or slate green with darker streak-like mottling\n\n• Short caudal peduncle (narrow part of a fish’s body to which the caudal or tail fin is attached)\n\nTOPE (SOUPFIN) SHARK\n\nGaleorhinus galeus\n\n• Pelagic and demersal (surface to 471 m)\n\n• Length to 2 m (6.5 feet)\n\n• Dusky grey on top, paler to white on sides\n\n• Second dorsal fin directly above anal fin\n\n• Black markings on juvenile fins\n\n• Slender body, long-snout\n\n• No keel on caudal peduncle\n\nSHORTFIN MAKO SHARK\n\nIsurus oxyrinchus\n\n• Pelagic (surface to 740 m)\n\n• Length to 4 m (13 feet)\n\n• Large black eyes, a sharp snout, large, narrow, hooked teeth with smooth edges\n\n• Dark blue on top, white below; underside of snout and jaw is white\n\n• Tiny second dorsal and anal fins\n\nAdvertisement 7\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nSEVENGILL SHARK\n\nNotorynchus cepedianus\n\n• Demersal (135 m to 570 m)\n\n• Length to 3 m (10 feet)\n\n• Sandy grey to reddish brown, with scattered round black spots\n\n• Seven gill slits on each side\n\n• In upper jaw most teeth have one dominating cusp curved inward.
