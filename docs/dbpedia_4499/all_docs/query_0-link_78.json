        "text": "When I was a child, growing up summers in Wellfleet, people said that there couldn’t be sharks in the water, because the water was too cold. They had apparently not read Thoreau. In “Cape Cod,” published in 1865, he writes that he saw “the relics of a human body, mangled by sharks.” A wrecker—someone who scavenged shipwrecks—told him that he had caught a “man-eating shark fourteen feet long” where Thoreau had just swum. “Man-eater” is a bygone name for a great white shark; scientists simply call them white sharks. They were also called “white death.” Their undersides are white, and their tops are gray, and a modern name for them is “the men in gray suits.” They are solitary animals, and in the Atlantic they are sufficiently uncommon that no one knows how many there are, although it is assumed that there are not many. Now and then, gillnetters catch them unintentionally, but a fisherman in New England might spend his life on the water and not see one. I saw only one shark as a child, at Newcomb Hollow, in, I think, 1960, washed ashore after a big storm. I don’t know what kind it was, but I recall it as being about ten feet long. The beach was still wet from the rain, and the shark lay at the end of a track its body had made in the sand. Someone my older brothers knew had wrapped a rope around its tail and tried to drag it into Gull Pond, to scare the tourists.\n\nThe appeal of white sharks to the imagination is so obvious that it hardly needs stating, but, even so, like all big, fierce creatures, they exemplify the mysterious and ungovernable parts of our lives. White sharks roam the ocean the way unspecified urges and figures roam the psyche—liable to appear abruptly, often destructively, and whenever they decide to, on their terms, not ours. When I think of white sharks, I think of the maps from antiquity that have whirlpools and sea monsters and blank areas where the unknown begins.\n\nOnce you enter the ocean deeper than your knees, you become part of the food chain. In July of 2012, a white shark in Truro, the town north of Wellfleet, grabbed a man named Chris Myers by one of his legs. Myers kicked the shark in the face seven or eight times with his other foot. He felt he was kicking something indifferent and immovable, like a refrigerator, he told me. Eventually, the shark let go. Then it rose to the surface, as if, Myers said, to display its bulk. White sharks engage in a reconnaissance tactic called spyhopping, in which they rise from the water for a few seconds, and the shark may simply have been trying to determine what it had mistaken for prey. When white sharks get big, they like to eat big things, meaning seals, which have a lot of fat. Shark scientists regard a bite such as Myers received as exploratory. White sharks have very sensitive noses and mouths, and they like to feel things with them, the way we use our fingers. It is reasonable to assume that the shark bit Myers, felt bones and not fat, and retreated. Myers had damage to his tendons and needed forty-seven stitches. The attack was the first in Massachusetts since 1936, when a white shark bit a sixteen-year-old boy in Mattapoisett, near New Bedford, who died while being operated on. For the rest of last summer, Truro put signs on the beaches warning about sharks, but college kids kept stealing them for their dorm rooms.\n\nWhen I spoke to Myers, he called the shark “he,” but I wonder if it might have been a large female white shark named Julia. Julia was named after being tagged by Greg Skomal, who works for the Massachusetts Division of Marine Fisheries and is the most knowledgeable authority on Atlantic white sharks. For at least fifty years, sea creatures around the world have had tags implanted in them or attached to them in order to learn where they go. In 2011, with the help of a tuna harpooner, Skomal embedded a tag in Julia. Since 2009, Skomal and the harpooner, Bill Chaprales, have embedded tags in thirty-one white sharks, mostly off Chatham, the town at the elbow of Cape Cod. A spotter pilot finds a shark and directs them to it. Essentially, they sneak up on it. From a narrow walkway, called a pulpit, extending twenty feet from the bow of his boat, Chaprales, looming over the shark, launches his harpoon. The embedded tag separates from the harpoon, which Chaprales collects. One shark jumped out of the water after being stuck and charged the boat. Some simply turn and look behind them. Most bolt about a hundred feet, then stop. “That’s the baddest fish in the ocean,” Chaprales says. “Nobody messes with them. They just can’t figure out what’s going on.”\n\nSkomal uses two kinds of tags. One is called a PSAT tag, for pop-up satellite archival tag. A PSAT tag records an animal’s itinerary (they are also used on sea turtles and tuna) and the depth and temperature of the water it swims through. The tag is attached by a wire designed to disintegrate after several months; arriving at the surface, the tag transmits to a satellite. Practically nothing is known of white-shark habits in the Atlantic, and where and how far the sharks range. White sharks have been classified by the World Wildlife Fund as Vulnerable, the category below Endangered. If Skomal can discover that they all spend time in one place or another, he may be able to determine where they breed and give birth, so that such areas can be protected.\n\nJulia got an acoustic tag, which broadcasts to receivers in the water with a range of a thousand feet. There are receivers off Chatham and three off Truro which are part of a striped-bass tagging project. A fish that lingers near a receiver might record sixty transmissions in an hour. Or it might be picked up a single time while passing through. In 2012, Julia was detected more than seven hundred and fifty times off Truro, two hundred and fifty times close to shore. This year, she arrived in Chatham on May 28th and has been detected consistently since July 7th.\n\nEarlier in July of 2012, in Orleans, twenty miles south of Truro, a white shark followed a kayaker named Walter Szulc. Szulc had never been in a kayak before. He saw a paddleboarder pointing at something behind him, and he turned around and saw the fin about ten feet away. From photographs of the fin, which had a small, crescent-shaped notch, Skomal and his assistant, John Chisholm, determined that the shark was a female that they had tagged and named Large Marge. Large Marge and Julia appear to avoid each other. Julia prefers Truro and the south end of Chatham, and Large Marge keeps mostly to the north end of Chatham and to Orleans. Large Marge hasn’t appeared in Chatham this year.\n\nFish scientists describe white sharks as traumatogenic to humans, meaning capable of causing an injury. The largest grow to nearly twenty feet and weigh five thousand pounds, about the same as a Lincoln Navigator. They are among the most modern looking of animals—eight fins on a tapered cylinder, a Bauhaus fish—yet their form is prehistoric. One woman told me that when she saw a white shark for the first time she felt as if she were seeing a dinosaur rising from the depths. They are found around the world, except close to the poles. They were traditionally thought to live about twenty years, but Skomal, by applying carbon-dating to cartilage samples, has discovered that seventy years is a more likely old age and that some sharks may live even longer. No one among the grownups I knew thought there were white sharks off Cape Cod because it wasn’t discovered until the late nineteen-seventies that they can raise their blood temperature as much as fifteen degrees above the water temperature, meaning that they can tolerate much colder water than anyone believed they could.\n\nIn 1990, a white shark was seen off Cape Cod. Five years passed before another was sighted. Lobster divers in Provincetown said that they sometimes came face to face with them in the murky water off Race Point. In 1999, two were seen; one was seen in 2001, and four in 2004. Twenty-one were seen in 2012. No one knows how many white sharks there are off Cape Cod, especially over the course of a season, or how many white sharks the area can sustain. Nothing suggests a resident population that overwinters, but there may be white sharks that spend more time there than others, and there may be white sharks that visit more than once on their way somewhere else. The Cape may be a destination for some sharks, or “an exit off the highway for others,” Skomal says. It may be as far north as some white sharks swim. One reason a white shark might be transient is that it arrives and finds bigger ones already established. Most white sharks arrive around Cape Cod in July and August, and the last seem to depart by December.\n\nI am by nature prone to obsessions, and one that I have entertained lately has been tracking the whereabouts of two white sharks, Genie and Mary Lee, that were tagged off Cape Cod, in September of 2012, by an ocean explorer named Chris Fischer. Fischer may well be the world’s most prominent white-shark conservationist. Since 2007, he has led fifteen shark-tagging expeditions, mostly off Mexico, California, and South Africa, on which he has tagged sixty-seven white sharks, far more than anyone else. He is forty-four and, when he’s not fishing, lives in Park City, Utah. He was raised in a prosperous family in Louisville, Kentucky, and has one older sister and three older brothers, one of whom is the mayor of Louisville. As a child, he fished for smallmouth and largemouth bass and read the novels of the writer and adventurer Zane Grey. He is about six feet tall, with light-brown hair and a round, handsome face. When he’s tired, his expression has a preoccupied and melancholy cast. He feels a restless need to perfect himself, the result of what his father told me were frank “table-talk discussions” in which he asked his children whether there weren’t things about themselves that needed improvement. Before Fischer pursued sharks, he had a reputation as an accomplished blue-water fisherman, especially adept at catching marlin and sailfish—“anything with a stick for a nose,” a professional fisherman told me. Taking his three children out on the water, Fischer says, made him decide “to pour the ocean into other people’s homes.”\n\nThe stage for his work is his ship, the Ocearch, a retired Bering Sea crabber, which was built in 1992 and is a hundred and twenty-six feet long. On its deck is a platform called a cradle, which by means of a hydraulic lift can be lowered to the water and submerged. Once a shark is hooked, it is led to the cradle, then the cradle is raised just above the water so that skin and blood and samples of parasites can be taken. Out of the water, the shark is restrained by its bulk. Before the Ocearch, scientists could only examine sharks in slings in the water beside their boats or while they were still on the line. A shark in a sling has leverage and bangs itself against the side of the boat in trying to swim away. Until Fischer made the cradle available, there was no simple means of drawing blood from a big, live shark.\n\nKeeping the Ocearch on the water costs a few million dollars a year, which Fischer initially paid for by making television shows, something he says he never much liked doing. In 2012, he struck a sponsorship deal with the heavy-equipment manufacturer Caterpillar and several other sponsors, and now, he says, “I’m a totally funded explorer, which allows me to be on mission a hundred per cent of the time.” He invites renowned fish scientists aboard the Ocearch “to do the science of their dreams,” and estimates that forty papers are under way from studies performed on sharks he has collected and tagged. Data from the tags, they hope, will describe the sharks’ range and the boundaries of their wanderings, and so may the skin parasites, since different parasites live in different parts of the ocean. Scientists are also interested to know how many types of parasites live on white sharks, whether any specialize in the species, and what densities of them the sharks can tolerate. Drawn blood is examined for pollutants, nutrients, and reproductive hormones, and for signs of stress in captured sharks. Skomal is collecting DNA in order to determine the lineage of specific sharks and their relation to populations in the North Atlantic. Fischer’s part has been to provide large live sharks to researchers in numbers they couldn’t possibly manage otherwise. “In two or three years, when these papers start to appear, you’ll see the extent of his contribution,” Skomal says.\n\nLast September, Fischer brought the Ocearch to Cape Cod, where he caught Genie, named by Skomal for the shark scientist Eugenie Clark, and Mary Lee, named by Fischer for his mother. Fischer fitted them with tags called SPOT tags, for spot positioning or temperature transmitting, which are mounted with nylon bolts to the top of the dorsal fin. No one knows what this feels like for the shark, but the fin has very few nerves. The tag has a wet/dry switch, so that when the fin breaks the surface the tag pings a satellite. On the Ocearch Web site, I could look on a digital map for Genie and Mary Lee. The placement is accurate to a thousand feet. Sometimes the transmission had been made at two or three in the morning, and I would picture a shark fin moving languidly at sea in the pitch-black darkness. Mary Lee is a finner, meaning her fin breaks the surface frequently. Genie almost never surfaces; she is the Greta Garbo of white sharks. Last week, on August 28th, she turned up off Nantucket, having not been heard from for seven months; she was last detected off Savannah, Georgia.\n\nBefore Mary Lee was tagged last year, white-shark scientists assumed that Atlantic white sharks went south in the winter and north in the summer, like birds. Within a few days of being captured, on September 17th, Mary Lee began swimming south. By the beginning of October, she had reached North Carolina, and from October to January she moved between there and Florida, often within a few miles of shore. Toward the end of January, though, she began “to light up the East Coast,” Fischer says. By the end of January, she was in the newspapers for having been spotted off Long Island.\n\n“Then she goes up to the northeast peak of Georges Bank, off Massachusetts, past the edge of the continental shelf,” Skomal told me. A few hundred miles east of the border of Massachusetts and New Hampshire, “she bolts for Bermuda. Her track is so straight it looks like a flight path, which tells us she has great navigational techniques, although we don’t know what they are. She wraps herself around Bermuda for a day, then she goes down into the Sargasso Sea, hundreds of miles offshore, which by many accounts is barren and brutal, and what kind of big, charismatic shark goes to a place like that? Whales move through there, and there’s tuna seasonally, and eels breed there, but something has to be happening there—it’s a destination, but a strange one.” After several weeks, Mary Lee moved toward the coast and turned north once again. By the third week of April, she was east of Delaware, at which point she turned south.\n\nI was hoping that over the summer Genie and Mary Lee would return to Cape Cod, and that I might, by following their tracks, get near them, either on the beach or with a friend who has a lobster boat. If they returned to Chatham, where the water is shallow, I might even see them.\n\nWhen Fischer came to Cape Cod in 2012, he had permits to tag only in federal waters. Brett McBride, the Ocearch’s co-captain, told me that this “was like being on another planet” from the sharks, who were close to shore. Spotter pilots saw plenty of sharks. Skomal and Chaprales, working near the beach, tagged fifteen. Three miles offshore, Fischer and McBride and their crew chummed for nine days before Genie wandered by.\n\nThis year, Massachusetts gave Fischer permits to tag Monday to Friday in August. The weekends, it was thought, would have too much traffic on the water for white-shark fishing. Fischer invited Skomal along to oversee the science projects, and Skomal invited scientists from nine institutions, including the Mote Marine Laboratory, in Florida, the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, and the University of North Florida. Fischer said that he hoped to catch ten white sharks, but that he was bringing tags for twenty.\n\nMy first day on the Ocearch, Monday, August 5th, was their fourth day fishing. With a small crew, Fischer and McBride had been leaving the ship on a twenty-eight-foot tender shortly after first light. They anchored about half a mile from the Ocearch, in about twenty feet of water, off Monomoy Island, which is uninhabited, and about six miles south of Chatham harbor. They called this area Shark Cove, because Skomal’s acoustic receivers had detected more white sharks there than anywhere else. From the stern of the tender they trailed a decoy, made from a piece of carpet cut to the outline of a seal, and they mashed pieces of herring and tuna in a cylinder mounted on the side of the boat and dispensed the mixture into the water. The slick they created looked like a trail they had travelled to arrive where they were.\n\nOn the stern of the Ocearch, the boat’s co-captain, an older man from New Jersey named Bob Yates, cut up dolphin and barracuda and tuna and herring and flung them into the water. About fifty yards off the stern was a white float like a child’s hop ball with a bluefish hanging from it. There were also two seal decoys. Depending from another rope were the heads of several big tuna. Sometimes one of the crew would lift the tuna heads and douse them, the way you steep a tea bag. The chum slick Yates made was perhaps twenty-five feet across. If you drove through it, you could smell it. A shark intersecting a slick cuts back and forth across it until it locates the slick’s path, then it follows the path to the boat. If one came to the Ocearch, Fischer would hotfoot it over from Shark Cove.\n\nIn the first three days, seven white sharks approached either the tender or the ship. None broke the surface. They were dark shapes beneath the water, sneaking up the slick, John Chisholm, Skomal’s assistant, told me. “They’re not at all like tuna, which go flying by,” he said. “These guys are slow and deliberate, like it’s their world, and they know it.” No sharks appeared that day, though, and in the afternoon Fischer broke off fishing and came aboard the Ocearch to conduct some business. “Now’s our window,” he said, preparing to return to the tender. “I feel very good about the next hour and a half.”\n\nThe only shark seen that day was off a beach in Wellfleet. Over the winter, the towns on the Cape had decided that if a shark was sighted everyone would have to get out of the water and stay out for an hour. If a shark was seen during the shutdown, the clock would start again. Most likely, Skomal said, the beach-closer in Wellfleet was a plankton feeder called a basking shark.\n\nWednesday morning, the glare made the water look like paint. People kept saying something was about to happen. Fischer says that fishing for white sharks is “not like regular fishing at all.” In regular fishing, you determine where the bait is and fish among it. “With white sharks, you can see where the bait is. It’s sitting right there on the beach.” On the shore of Monomoy, about a mile away, was a long black line, like thread. Maybe five hundred seals, Chisholm said. They might only have wanted to lie in the sun, but they might also have been on the beach because there were sharks in the water.\n\nAround the world, the most reliable place to find a white shark is someplace where there are seals. The places where sharks aggregate are called hot spots. The sharks attract cage divers, who throw fish in the water to draw the sharks to the cages. The white sharks grow accustomed to being fed. The sound of a shark cage going in the water, Fischer says, is like a white-shark dinner bell ringing. There is no cage diving for white sharks in New England, because until recently there was no white-shark hot spot in the northwestern Atlantic. Seals are another thing I didn’t see growing up on the Cape, and now you see them all the time. The seals on Cape Cod in the summer are gray seals, which grow to nearly eleven feet and weigh as much as six hundred and fifty pounds. They have long noses, and on Nantucket they are called horsehead seals.\n\nFishermen loathe seals. For parts of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, Massachusetts and Maine paid a bounty for a seal nose. In 1972, the Marine Mammal Protection Act made it illegal to kill them, and now, according to Lisa Sette, a biologist at the Provincetown Center for Coastal Studies, the seals “are in the midst of a recolonization process.” A survey in 1999 estimated that there were fifty-six hundred seals in southern New England. In 2011, there were nearly sixteen thousand in Massachusetts. Skomal describes the seal aggregations as a café, and he says that now that the café is open “the men in gray suits are showing up.”\n\nI asked Skomal if he still swims in the ocean. “I’ve developed some hesitation to my personal water use,” he said. “I used to be fearless, but when you see these sharks constantly. . . .” He added, though, that, as far as he could tell, white sharks don’t appear to like being in waves close to shore. The shark attacks that take place in shallow water are typically the work of other, smaller species. The shallowest water in which Skomal has seen a white shark was six feet.\n\nLate in the afternoon, Fischer returned to the ship, looking tired. “We just exited a super-favorable window,” he said. I asked how he had started fishing for white sharks, and he said off Baja California, in collaboration with a scientist who wanted to employ SPOT tags. “No one had ever tried to capture a large live white shark before,” he said. “I remember the fear. What is it going to do? The big ones are the most dominant, and they come in first, and when you’re learning you’d rather not have that. All these things were conjured up in my brain from the movie—is he going to charge the boat? One shark broke our two-thousand-pound cable like it was string. Once we caught one, though, I realized it was just another fish trying to get away.”\n\nThe movie reference, of course, was to “Jaws,” in which the shark is a psychotic white shark. In the minds of many shark researchers, the movie was a setback to white-shark science. Fischer likes to call the white shark the lion of the ocean, and he thinks that his work has done something to change how people think of sharks. “Before, if you saw footage of a shark, you’d hear the music from ‘Jaws’ in the background and get scared,” he said. “Now I think there’s a tone of curiosity and respect.”\n\nThursday morning on the deck, Fischer said, “Every shark we have caught on the East Coast has been difficult.” He was greeting some guests. “Compared to other places, this is a very wild fish. Super-nervous, super-shy. Very hard to tempt,” he said. “We’re dealing with a virgin body of fish. After seeing them in South Africa, where there’s cage diving, and they come up and play with the bait like dogs, it’s interesting to see how timid these fish are.”\n\nThroughout the morning, chunks of fish drifted from the stern in little bursts, like bits of code. At ten-thirty, a white helicopter appeared over Monomoy and came in low and made a tight circle around the Ocearch. Aboard was Dawson Farber, the Orleans harbormaster, who texted Skomal that he had seen a shark near the tender. “We had him relatively close to the boat, but he didn’t stick around very long,” Farber said later. “It was about twelve to fourteen feet, swimming southeast, away from the boat. We lost it in deeper water, then found it again heading offshore before we lost it for good.” Fischer said that they never saw the shark from the tender.\n\nFriday the wind came up and by noon it was too rough to fish. Sunday morning, I went flying with a spotter pilot named George Breen. Outside Chatham harbor, a seal like a little grain of black rice was nosing along the beach, among waves that broke in the shape of white fans. The water close to shore was light green, and you could see the bottom, and where it was deeper the rippled surface looked like a piece of gnarled hide. Our shadow followed us on the water. We came across a group of seals in the water and when they looked up at us the light turned their faces from dark brown to the color of copper.\n\nMonday morning, I encountered Fischer drinking coffee on the deck of the Ocearch. He was about to return to the tender. “I’m trying to figure out when it’s fishy,” he said. He thought the water might have become too warm. He thrust his chin toward the south end of Monomoy. “Somewhere down there, they’re stacked up where the warm and cold water meet. I’m just guessing, right? You have a lot of time to think.”\n\nThe sky was overcast. “Forty years since ‘Jaws,’ ” Fischer said. “Every shark since has been shot, hooked, or whacked, so now what we have is a very cautious fish. Why wouldn’t they be afraid of boats? That’s my theory. I can just throw that out. I’m not a brainiac. I’m a fisherman.” That afternoon, they saw two sharks, one of which struck the decoy. The same shark, or the other, swam off with the bait, but the hook came out of its mouth.\n\nAround seven-thirty, Fischer came back to the Ocearch. “They grip the bait, and they swim away with it,” he said, clenching his teeth to demonstrate the fish with the hook. “If they feel any tension—thwoo!—they spit it out. They don’t have any tension like that in the wild.” He looked out at the water. “The dexterity, the fineness, it’s hard to believe,” he went on. “You think of these huge animals, and you think they’re going to come in and hit the bait, and they swim up and extend their teeth and delicately touch it. We’re dealing with the most nervous of the most nervous of the species that survived two hundred years of whaling and long-lining, and now we have their offspring. They’re very wary. That fish today never got pronged or poked, though. All it got was a couple of treats, so I think it will be back.”\n\nTuesday morning, when I asked Fischer how he was feeling, he said, “Super fishy. It’s going to happen today or tomorrow.” It didn’t. “Today’s the day,” I heard. Or, “It’s white-shark weather.” Or the tide was right, or the slick looked fine. As the morning wore on, no one seemed hopeful anymore. “We’re kidding ourselves,” Skomal said. “There’s no fish out there.”\n\nMcBride was on deck, which was unusual; he spent nearly all his time on the tender. He told me that white sharks have blue eyes. “People think they’re black, but every one of them has got a pretty blue color to it,” McBride said. “I wanted to name one of them Sinatra.” He had noticed the eyes while in the Ocearch’s cradle, observing the shark closely for his own protection. “They look at you,” he said. “They can’t lunge at you, but I know from mako sharks that they’ll wait for the opportunity. The comfort zone comes from the knowledge of what the animal’s likely to do, what he’s capable of doing. You don’t want to be matching your reflexes against his. You plan for one second from now, the way fighters do. Just don’t be there.”\n\nOn the eighth day, Fischer’s mother and father, his wife and children, his sister, and two of his brothers came aboard, and he spent most of the day with them. For a time he sat, incongruously, on a deck chair, as if on a cruise. Late in the afternoon, I stood beside him on the stern, watching the slick. “I just don’t think there’s any fish in here now,” he said. “I don’t think we drove in here on any fish.” A big gull dove on a chunk of tuna. “You have to be hopeful, right? Last year, Skomal tagged fifteen. They will be here.” As if to himself, he said, “It just doesn’t feel like they’re here right now.”\n\nThe two hours before the tide and the two hours after, when the current slackens, are the best time to fish. From the slow passage of the fish chunks in the water, we could see that the current had turned listless. “It’s bite time,” Fischer said. “It’s bite-thirty.”\n\nOn the ninth day, I was sitting in the galley of the Ocearch, watching two crew members play cards, when the cradle was raised from the deck. I assumed that it was a repeat of a drill I had seen before. A scientist named Nick Whitney was on deck, though, working on tags, and usually he was in the cabin. “They saw one twenty minutes ago, about ten feet away,” he said. Heather Marshall, another scientist, was standing nearby. She got a text, and when she read it she said, “It’s come twice.”\n\n“It’s not around anymore?” Whitney asked.\n\n“Apparently not, but it’s early,” she said. “They thought it was headed this way. It chewed up one of the decoys.”\n\nAbout an hour later, another white shark crossed the slick behind the tender, then a fisherman saw one at the southern end of Monomoy, less than a mile away. I was standing on the second deck, watching the slick, when I heard a voice on a radio say, “Hooked up! Hooked up! Hooked up!,” and everyone began running to the deck. The crew unrolled hoses, which they would insert in the shark’s mouth so that water would run over its gills and it could breathe. The scientists gathered near the bow to rehearse their procedures. It was three-twenty. Skomal stood in the center saying things such as “I’m going in and doing surgery and stepping back. You’re doing blood. Heather is parasites. Who’s doing notes?”\n\nWhen a fish is hooked, it bolts. The first run with a white shark is blistering, McBride says. He has had great whites rise out of the water and tail-walk like marlins, but most of them dive or head for the horizon. If you fight it, McBride says, “eventually you’re going to break tackle or wear him down and hurt him.” Any fish, pulled too hard or in the wrong way, fights harder, he says. Once the sprint concludes, McBride starts putting pressure on the shark. “You find the speed where you’re not pulling them, you’re coaxing them about which direction to go,” he says. In deep water, the sharks can dive, but Shark Cove is shallow. Fischer maneuvers the tender in front of the shark. A shark has no brakes, so it has to turn and struggle, which is fatiguing. Each time it turns, Fischer puts the boat in front of it. “We’re not going to fight him, we’re going to do this little dance that we do,” McBride says. He calls this “coming to an understanding. If you’re not in a hurry and you take it inch by inch, and you find exactly the right speed, so you’re not pulling them, they grow comfortable and don’t feel in any danger. It becomes like walking them to the ship on a leash.” They arrive at the boat neither “too worn out or too green.”\n\nFifteen minutes later, the tender was off the starboard bow, trailing the dorsal fin and the tail fin of a white shark. The fins moved slowly side to side as the shark swam. A silver cable connected the shark to the tender, which ran alongside the middle of the Ocearch, about thirty yards off, then turned slowly to swing past the cradle. The shark was a female, and as she came close to the cradle she turned nearly onto her back and I briefly saw her white underside, then she veered away.\n\nIt took five minutes for the tender to circle and approach the cradle again. This time, as the shark came alongside the ship, she swam straight away from it, avoiding the cradle again. On the third pass, McBride, barefoot and in his jeans and a T-shirt, jumped into the water and climbed onto the submerged platform. Pulling hard on the cable, he steered the shark to the cradle. As she arrived, he leaped over a railing like a rodeo clown. When she passed him, he jumped back in and grabbed her tail and turned her slowly on her side so that her glistening white belly appeared again. It was a milky white, the color of the moon, with the water rippling off it. McBride yelled for the cradle to be raised. When it was out of the water, someone threw him a towel, and he placed it over the shark’s eyes. She grew still. Others jumped on the cradle with the hoses. Someone lifted her snout, and McBride removed the hook, which was lodged in her jaw, while the hoses were put in her mouth. Water began pouring from her gills. Twice, her tail flipped up ponderously in an arc, and McBride stepped back."
