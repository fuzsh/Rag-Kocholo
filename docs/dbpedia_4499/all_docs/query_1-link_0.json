Kay Larkin, whose father is a suspect to a crime. Larkin's partner, along with another Mountie, are found murdered: word came down from the remote region of the Pacific Northwest from Dr. Howe, who resides there. But after finding old man Larkin, and arresting him in the name of the Crown, Renfrew hears his story and suspect's Kay's father is innocent of the charges. Pierre, an employee of a trading post up north, is suspect until Dr. Howe's guilt is revealed. Howe committed the murders and attempted to frame Larkin.

Herman would go on to direct a number of Tex Ritter westerns.[1]\n\nSoundtrack\n\n[edit]\n\nJames Newill - \"Mounted Men\" (Written by Betty Laidlaw and Robert Lively)\n\nJames Newill - \"You're Beautiful\" (Written by Lew Porter)\n\nJames Newill - \"Je T'aime\" (Written by Lew Porter and Bob Taylor)\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nRenfrew of the Royal Mounted (1937)\n\nSky Bandits (1940)\n\nDanger Ahead (1940)\n\nYukon Flight (1940)\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
