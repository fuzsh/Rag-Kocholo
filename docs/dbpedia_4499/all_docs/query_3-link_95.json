        "text": "Glacial History\n\nThe landscape of Stokes State Forest has been shaped by various glacial periods for over one million years. Most recently, the Wisconsin Glacier covered Stokes with a half mile of ice, less than 20,000 years ago! Its weight and friction scraped and scoured the area, creating the geologic landforms you see today. Take a walk on the Geology Trail to learn more.\n\nNative Americans\n\nThis land was occupied by various tribes of Americans for thousands of years before the first Europeans arrived. For some time, New Jersey was largely the territory of the Lenni-Lenape, a peaceful people who moved with the seasons to make the most of the natural resources.\n\nEarly Settlers\n\nThe first colonists to carve out a life for themselves in Sussex County were farmers and miners. By the 1800s much of what is now Stokes was clear-cut to make way for crops and pasture. Industry and innovation happened here too, and its echoes still lie in the forest in the forms of covered mine shafts, dilapidated mills and other interesting structures.\n\nGovernor Edward C. Stokes\n\nStokes State Forest was named after Edward C. Stokes, governor from 1905 to 1908, who personally donated the first 500 acres to the state to establish the park. A nice down payment to get the ball rolling; today Stokes covers 16,025 acres.\n\nStokes and the CCC\n\nIn the 1930s, the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) was formed. It brought young American men into rustic camps to do environmental conservation work in every corner of the nation, including Stokes State Forest.\n\nFrom 1933 to 1942, the CCC men of Stokes built Sunrise Mountain Road, erected the pavilions, lean-tos, and cabins, dammed streams to create Lake Ocquittunk and Skellinger Lake, and planted hundreds of trees throughout the forest.\n\nTrail Map\n\nPARK ADVISORY:Blue Mountain Trail Detour: Please note that there is a temporary detour of a small section of the Blue Mountain Loop Trail near Crigger Road.
