        "text": "All aboard for an unforgettable journey on \"The Scenic Railway of the World\" to the magnificent White Pass Summit. Experience the most popular attraction in Skagway with convenient dockside service. Your fully narrated, 40-mile round-trip adventure on the historic, narrow gauge railroad is an unforgettable way to see the beauty of the area and learn its colorful history. Carved through some of the North's most rugged terrain in 1898, this engineering marvel climbs nearly 3,000 feet, offering breathtaking views. Built during the Klondike Gold Rush, the railway was completed in 26 months by blasting through the mountains with 450 tons of explosives. Fully restored cars, pulled by diesel locomotives, travel over steep grades and around cliff-hanging turns. Retrace the original route to the White Pass Summit, take in the majestic panorama of mountains, glaciers, gorges, waterfalls, tunnels, trestles and historic sites from large, picture windows, then return to port."
