        "text": "About the Park\n\nFranconia Notch State Park is located in the heart of the White Mountain National Forest. Franconia Notch is a spectacular mountain pass traversed by a unique parkway which extends from the Flume Gorge at the south to Echo Lake at the north. For eight miles, I-93 winds between the high peaks of the Kinsman and Franconia mountain ranges.\n\nFranconia Notch was the home of the famous Old Man of the Mountain, the same \"Great Stone Face\" immortalized by Nathaniel Hawthorne and Daniel Webster. While you are here, stop at the Flume Gorge Visitor Center and walk through the renowned Flume Gorge, ride the exciting aerial tramway at Cannon Mountain, and visit the New England Ski Museum. Take your time, stop for a swim at Echo Lake, net a trout while fly fishing at Profile Lake, ride your bike on the Recreational Trail, watch for rock climbers, hawks, and falcons on Cannon Cliffs, or hike on the Appalachian Trail. Bring the family, stay awhile, and enjoy Franconia Notch State Park.\n\nSee Designated Franconia Notch State Park Parking- HERE.\n\nFranconia Notch Map and Attractions Brochure\n\nRead a Blog about Recreational Activities in the Notch from our SCA Ranger\n\nEcho Lake Beach at Franconia Notch State Park\n\nBeach Advisories\n\nBeautiful Echo Lake, at an elevation of 1,931 feet, offers views of Mt.
