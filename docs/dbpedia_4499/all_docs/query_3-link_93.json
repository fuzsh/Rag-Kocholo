        "text": "The Rota Vicentina is a network of hiking trails in the Alentejo and Algarve provinces in Southern Portugal. The network includes two long-distance routes the Fisherman’s Trail and the Historical Way, and several short circular routes some of which can be incorporated into one of the long-distance trails. We’ve walked both multi-day routes of the Rota Vicentina as well as some of the day hikes. In this post, we describe different route options, costs, transportation, and accommodation on the Rota Vicentina.\n\nWhat is the Rota Vicentina in Portugal?\n\nRota Vicentina is a network of walking routes in the Alentejo and Algarve provinces in Southern Portugal. The Rota includes two long-distance trails the Fishermen’s Trail and the Historical Way and many circular day hikes. The coastal trails (Fishermen’s Trail and some day hikes) ranked as some of the most scenic routes in Europe. Living on the South Coast of Portugal for a couple of years we have spent a lot of time exploring the Best Hiking Trails in the Algarve.\n\nHow long does it take to hike the Rota Vicentina?\n\nThe time and distance of the Rota Vicentina depend on the chosen route. If you do the Fishermen’s Trail it’ll take 12-13 days to complete the route. If you hike the Historical Way you’ll need 6 days to complete it. You can do any section of the Rota Vicentina as an independent hike. If you don’t have enough time to finish the entire trail you can choose a part of it.\n\nWhere does the Rota Vicentina start?\n\nThe Fishermen’s Trail of the Rota Vicentina starts at S.Torpes Beach 10 km north of Porto Covo, Alentejo, and finishes in Lagos, Algarve.\n\nThe Historical Way of the Rota Vicentina starts in Santiago do Cacém, Alentejo, and finishes in Odeceixe, Algarve. From Odeceixe, you can continue walking south following the Fishermen’s Trail.\n\nBoth trails can be walked in either direction: north to south or south to north.\n\nDay hikes start in different locations throughout the region.\n\nWhat is the best part of the Rota Vicentina?\n\nIn my opinion, the part of the Fishermen’s Trail from Sagres to Lagos and the walk from Carrapateirs to Vila do Bispo are some of the most beautiful parts of the Rota Vicentina. Overall the entire route is spectacular; pristine beaches, rugged cliffs, charming towns, and untouched nature.\n\nTravel insurance for the Rota Vicentina\n\nConsidering travel insurance for your trip? World Nomads offers coverage for more than 150 adventure activities as well as emergency medical, lost luggage, trip cancellation and more.\n\nWho are World Nomads?\n\nWorld Nomads’ mission is to support and encourage travelers to explore their boundaries.\n\nThey offer simple and flexible travel insurance and safety advice to help you travel confidently, destination guides and tips to help you plan your trip, and responsible travel insights to help you travel better\n\nWorld Nomads provides travel insurance for travelers in over 100 countries. As an affiliate, we receive a fee when you get a quote from World Nomads using this link. We do not represent World Nomads. This is information only and not a recommendation to buy travel insurance.\n\nRota Vicentina guidebooks\n\nThe official guidebook is the best one to use for the Rota Vicentina. You can buy it online on the official website or at one of the information offices along the route. You can get one at Papelaria O Correiro, Vasco da Gama Street 7b in Porto Covo the start of the Fishermen’s Trail and at the tourist information office in Santiago do Cacém (the start of the Historical Way).\n\nThere is a Cicerone guidebook on the Rota Vicentina that has a lot of information on the trail that you can buy on Amazon.\n\nRota Vicentina’s routes\n\nAs I already mentioned there are two long-distance trails and many circuit routes/day hikes most of the short routes can be incorporated into one of the multi-day trails.\n\nDifferent routes of the Rota Vicentina\n\nThe Historical Way\n\nTotal distance – 120 km/74 mi\n\nNumber of days – 6 days\n\nStarting point – Santiago do Cacém\n\nFinishing point – Odeceixe\n\nRoute marking – red & white markers\n\nThe Historical Way has significantly fewer hikers than the coastal trail. We saw between 2 and 5 hikers a day on this route. Overall the area is not touristy compared to the coast which is just 20 km away. As a result, accommodation options are pretty limited. There are no hostels or campsites on the Historical Way. The only campsite and hostel on the route are in Odeceixe. Accommodation works out more expensive here than on the Fishermen’s Trail. Most places don’t have a kitchen so you can’t really cook if you want a proper meal, not just a sandwich you have to eat in a restaurant or bar.\n\nEating out in this part of the Rota Vicentina is cheaper than along the coast restaurants cater to locals, not to tourists. You can get a set menu for 7-8 Euros, a dish for 6-7 Euros, a cup of coffee for 0,60 Euro, etc.\n\nThe scenery on the Historical Way is nice and peaceful with a lot of walking through the fields (if you walk it in April-May it will be covered in flowers), a bit of forest, and quite a lot of hills. It’s the route with the most ascents and descents though nothing is very steep or long. Overall the Historical Way is a nice route to walk if you want to see off-the-beaten-path areas in southern Portugal. In our opinion, the scenery is not as impressive as on the coastal route.\n\nIf you’re planning to walk the Historical Way you can download our free PDF file with walking stages and places to stay on the route.\n\nThe Fishermen’s Trail\n\nTotal distance – 230 km/143 mi\n\nNumber of days – 11-13 days\n\nStarting point – S.Torpes Beach, Porto Covo\n\nFinishing point – Lagos\n\nRoute marking – blue & green markers\n\nThe Fishermen’s Trail (the Coastal route) of the Rota Vicentina is a popular route with many day walkers and weekend groups. The trail goes through the touristy parts of the Alentejo and Algarve regions. Besides hikers in the season, there are many holidaymakers. If you walk this route during the summer months you’ll see many people. It’s highly recommended to book accommodation on the route beforehand.\n\nThe Fishermen’s Trail has more accommodation options and campsites because it is a popular summer holiday destination. It’s possible to find budget places to stay. Eating out on this trail is more expensive compared to the Historical Way. For a set meal in a restaurant (Menu do Dia), you pay 25-30 Euro for two people vs 15-20 Euro on the Historical Way. You can reduce your food expenses if you stay in places with a kitchen and cook yourself. Every town on the trail has a supermarket or at least a grocery store.\n\nThe part of the Fishermen’s Trail from Odeceixe to Lagos is not as busy as the part from Corto Covo to Odeceixe. Most people finish walking in Odeceixe probably because it used to be the end of the route before it was extended first to Cabo de S. Vicente (Sagres) and later to Lagos.\n\nThe scenery on this route is truly spectacular; rugged cliffs, sandy beaches, turquoise water, picturesque bays, hidden caves, breathtaking lookout points, and charming towns. If you ask me I’d definitely choose the Fishermen‘s Trail over the Historical Way.\n\nIf you’re planning to walk the Fishermen’s Trail you can download our free PDF file that includes walking stages and places to stay along the route.\n\nDay hikes on the Rota Vicentina\n\nThere are 24 circular day hiking trails on the Rota Vicentina with a total distance of 265 km/164 mi. Distances of the day hikes vary from short 4-5-kilometer trails to 12-12-16-kilometer routes. All hikes are circular routes. You don’t have to worry about getting back to your car or your hotel after finishing a hike. Many circular routes are partly included in one of the long trails. We haven’t walked any of the 24 trails yet but now living in Lagos we’re planning to start hiking them in order to prepare for walking the Portuguese Camino de Santiago with our 2-year-old daughter. The day hiking trails are indicated with red and yellow markers.\n\nThe circular routes offer a combination of coastal and forest/field scenery. You can easily incorporate a couple of day hikes into a road trip or a beach holiday in southern Portugal.\n\nHow to combine the trails?\n\nYou can walk the entire Fishermen’s Trail or the Historical Route separately, you can walk only parts of the routes, or combine them. The two routes merge in Odeceixe.\n\nOption 1. Porto Covo – Odeceixe – Santiago do Cacém. You walk on the Fishermen’s Trail from Porto Covo to Odeceixe. From Odeceixe instead of continuing along the coast, follow the Historical Way and walk to Santiago do Cacém. This way you combine both country and seaside scenery and get to see different parts of the Alentejo region. The total distance of this route option is 196 km/121 mi. To complete it you need 10 days. The route can be walked either way starting in Porto Covo or in Santiago do Cacém.\n\nOption 2. Santiago do Cacém – Odeceixe – Lagos. You walk the Historical Way from Santiago do Cacém to Odeceixe and from there continue on the Fishermen’s Trail through Cabo de S. Vicente to Lagos. The total distance of this route is 274 km/170 mi. You need 13-14 days to complete it. It can be walked either way. You can cut it shorter if you don’t have enough time to complete the route.\n\nYou can walk any stage of the two routes separately as a day hike or you can choose a couple of stages and do a 2 or 3-day hike.\n\nThere is a great option for those who want to combine two outdoor activities (hiking and surfing) and enjoy the sea as much as possible. You can start walking in Porto Covo and finish in Arrifana. Where you can stay in a surf hostel rent a board or take a couple of lessons. Days needed – 6, total distance – 118 km.\n\nThe cost of walking the Rota Vicentina\n\nThe Algarve and Alentejo provinces are very popular summer holiday destinations which means in the peak season, between June and September the coast gets very busy and accommodation prices increase significantly. How much money you’ll spend walking Rota Vicentina depends on when you go. If you walk during the off-season, between November and March it will be the cheapest, the bordering season, October, April, and May are more expensive. The summer months from June to September are the most expensive period. We walked the Rota Vicentina in May and did find accommodation prices quite high in some popular touristy places.\n\nOn average you’ll spend 35-40 Euro per person per day on the Rota Vicentina. It includes accommodation (a room for two people or a dorm bed in a hostel), food, and transport. If you’re going to use a luggage transfer service you have to add 15 Euro per day extra.\n\nAccommodation\n\nAccommodation is the main expense of the Rota Vicentina. Depending on the type of place you’ll pay between 10 Euro (camping) and 30 Euro (a room in a hotel) per person.\n\nCamping is the cheapest option though not every town on the route has a campsite. Even if you like camping you’ll have to stay sometimes indoors. Prices for camping are between 10 and 12 Euro per person per day depending on the season. A drawback of camping is that you have to carry your camping gear (tent, sleeping bag, pad, cooking stuff, etc.) which adds significant weight to your backpack.\n\nHostels are the cheapest indoor accommodation option on the Rota Vicentina. Just like with camping, not every town on the trail has one. On the Fishermen’s Trail, there are hostels but not on the Historical Way. A bed in a dormitory costs between 15 and 20 Euros per person depending on the season. In July, August, and September the prices are at their highest. The lowest prices are during the offseason; from November to March.\n\nHotels/guesthouses are the most popular accommodation type on the trail. Prices vary between 40 and 60 Euros for a double room. We had one or two places where we paid around 30 Euro per two people. During the off-season, you’ll find more places offering rooms in this price range.\n\nFood\n\nEating out\n\nEating out at the restaurants on the Rota Vicentina was quite expensive compared to some other areas in Portugal where we traveled. Even in the same area, there was a significant price difference between places located inland and beach towns. Prepare to pay 10 Euros for a dish, plus 2-4 Euros extra if you order drinks, bread, coffee, etc. Our average bill was about 30 Euros for two people when we went out for dinner. If you order a sandwich (Tosta Mista) and a coffee or a cool drink it’ll cost around 3 Euros.\n\nPortugal has one of the cheapest coffee in Europe; Espresso costs 0,70 Euro, and coffee with milk (Galao) – 1,2-1,5 Euros. If you order Americano you’ll pay about 1 Euro.\n\nShopping\n\nThe cheapest food option is to buy stuff in a shop and make your own food. To be able to cook you have to stay in places with a kitchen otherwise, you’ll be limited to eating sandwiches. Food shopping for 3 meals will cost you around 10 Euros per person. Bigger supermarkets (Lidl, InterMarche, Pingo Doce) have cafes or canteens where you can buy a well-priced meal, a sandwich, or a pastry.\n\nTransport\n\nAlmost every town on the Rota Vicentina can be reached by public transport. A bus from Lisbon to one of the starting points (Porto Covo or Santiago do Cacém) costs between 15 and 20 Euros one way. Getting from Lagos or Odeceixe to Lisbon will cost you 20 Euros. On the RedeExpressos website, you can often find bus tickets to Lisbon for 7 or 10 euros. We often travel between Lagos and Lisbon by bus and usually pay between 7 and 10 euros per ticket. Buses between the towns on the route cost between 3 and 7 Euros depending on the distance.\n\nBased on all these I’d suggest an estimated budget of 25 Euros per person per day if you’re planning to camp (when possible) and make your own food; 35-45 Euros per person if staying indoors (hostels and budget rooms) and cooking for yourself most of the time. And 50+ Euros to stay in hotels and eat out at least once a day.\n\nWhen is the best time for walking the Rota Vicentina?\n\nSummer in general (July and August in particular) is the busiest season in Southern Portugal with the most people and the highest prices. It gets very hot in the south of Portugal day temperatures go over 30°C. If you decide to walk the route in the summer months it’s recommended to start walking early in the morning in order to be finished before it gets too hot. Booking accommodation on the Rota Vicentina in advance is a must-do in the summer.\n\nBorder season (April-May and October) is a perfect time for walking the Rota Vicentina; there are significantly fewer people than in the summer. It’s warm but not too hot, accommodation is cheaper, and you don’t have to book it months in advance. We really like hiking in Portugal in the spring the scenery is very beautiful this time of the year.\n\nOff-season (November-March) is great if you want to have a solitary and quiet walk with very few tourists. Weather-wise it doesn’t get really cold on the Vicentina Coast and in the Algarve. The average temperatures in winter are between 13°C and 16°C but it might rain quite a bit in November and December. The wind can be a problem as well. As for accommodation prices, they are at their lowest (excluding Christmas and New Year) so you can get a really nice place for not expensive.\n\nLuggage transfer service (Vicentina Transfers)\n\nIt’s possible to arrange a backpack delivery on the Rota Vicentina. If you don’t want to walk carrying a big backpack with all your stuff it can be transferred every day between your accommodation places. You can walk with a small day pack carrying only valuables, water, and snacks.\n\nVicentina Transfers is the company that provides luggage delivery service on the trails. The price is 15€ per luggage item per stage, and ech additional piece of luggage costs 5 euros. The weight limit is 20 kg per luggage. It’s a door-to-door service your backpack is picked up in the morning (around 9 am) at the reception and delivered to the next place.\n\nWhat is the accommodation like on the route?\n\nEvery town on the Rota Vicentina has hotels and guesthouses, some more popular touristy places have hostels. Most of the places can be booked online through booking sites. Some areas have more accommodation options some less. On the Historical Way, there are not many places to stay. The route goes through not touristy areas of the Alentejo region. On the Fishermen’s Trail, there are more accommodation options including hostels and campsites, especially in some towns such as Sagres, Vilanova de Milsfontes, or Lagos. During the peak summer season, it’s highly recommended to book your accommodation on the Rota Vicentina a couple of months in advance.\n\nIf you want to make your own food it’s better to stay in hostels or rent apartments to have access to the kitchen. If you stay in hotels/guest houses you’ll have to buy ready-made food or eat at restaurants.\n\nOn the Fishermen’s Trail campsites can be found in Porto Covo, Zambujeira do Mar, Vila Nova de Milfontes, Odeceixe, Aljezur, Sagres, Salema, and Lagos. All campsites are not far from the route. On the Historical Way, there is only one campsite in Odeceixe. On the stretch between Santiago do Cacém and S.Teotónio there are no places to camp only indoor accommodation options.\n\nHow to get to the Rota Vicentina?\n\nMost towns on the Rota Vicentina have direct buses to Lisbon. It’s very easy to get from the capital to the trail and back.\n\nGetting from Lisbon to Santiago do Cacém, the Historical Way\n\nThere are 9 daily buses from Lisbon Sete Rios Bus Station to Santiago do Cacém, the journey takes 2 hours, and the price is 14 Euros. If you’re planning to start walking on the same day it’s better to take the earliest bus. You can buy tickets and confirm the departure time on the Rede Expressos website.\n\nGetting from Lisbon to Porto Covo, the Fishermen’s Trail\n\nAs of April 2023, there are 6 daily buses from Lisbon to Porto Covo. 5 buses leave from Sete Rios Bus Station and 1 from Oriente Station. The journey takes between 2 and 3 hours. The price is 16,5 Euros.\n\nGetting back to Lisbon from Odeceixe and Lagos\n\nThere are buses from Odeceixe (the end of the Historical Way) and Lagos (the end of the Fishermen’s Trail) to Lisbon. There are 4 buses from Odeceixe to Lisbon (3 to Sete Rios and 1 to Oriente), the journey takes 3h30min., the price is 19 Euros.\n\nFrom Lagos, there are many buses to both bus stations in Lisbon: Sete Rios and Oriente. The standard price is 20 Euro. Sometimes you can get a ticket with a discount of 7 or 10 euros. We often go to Lisbon from Lagos by bus and most of the time pay 10 euros per ticket. The journey takes 4 hours. You can check the itinerary and buy tickets online.\n\nThere are trains from Lagos to Lisbon with one connection in Tunte. The connection is usually 5-10 minutes. You can check departure times and prices on the official website.\n\nWalking the Rota Vicentina vs the Camino de Santiago\n\nWe met many people on the Camino de Santiago that want to do the Rota Vicentina. I decided to compare both walks based on our experience. We’ve walked 9 different routes of the Camino de Santiago; French Camino, Portuguese Camino, Camino Primitivo, Camino del Norte, Vía de la Plata, Camino Finisterre, Camino Inglés, Camino del Salvador, and Camino Gran Canaria and two routes of the Rota Vicentina; the Fishermen’s Trail and the Historical Way. Below I’m comparing the scenery, the cost, and the facilities on the Camino de Santiago and on the Rota Vicentina.\n\nScenery\n\nIt’s a tough choice but we are both hands for the Fishermen’s Trail we both love the sea it’s not often when the entire route follows the coastline; dramatic cliffs, pristine beaches, hidden bays – all these sound like a perfect holiday trail. You do get sea scenery on the Coastal Route of the Portuguese Camino and on the Northern Camino as well.\n\nIf you want to hike a spectacular coastal route in the Algarve region and don’t have time to complete a long-distance trail then the Seven Hanging Valleys Trail is a perfect option for you. It’s a one-day hike that offers one of the best sceneries in the region.\n\nCost\n\nThe Rota Vicentina is definitely more expensive than the Camino de Santiago. The main reason is accommodation there are no albergues for pilgrims on the route only hostels and hotels (some towns have campsites). You pay for accommodation between 20 and 40 Euros pp. depending on the season and type of accommodation you choose. Camping will cost you between 10 and 12 Euro pp. The season is an important factor and you’ll have to carry camping gear with you.\n\nLike any other popular holiday destination, the area is quite expensive compared to the rest of Portugal. On the Camino, you can get Menu del Dia for 7-10 Euro on the Fishermen’s Trail you pay the same for one dish. On the Historical Way eating out is cheaper you can get a menu for 7-8 Euros or a sandwich for 2 Euros.\n\nFacilities\n\nBoth the Rota Vicentina and the Camino are well-marked you don’t really need GPS or a map to follow the route. As I already mentioned there are no albergues on the Rota Vicentina but there is accommodation in every town on the route as well as ATMs, restaurants, and shops.\n\nWalking surface\n\nUnlike on some Camino routes on the Rota Vicentina you hardly walk on the tar road, most of the time it’s a footpath or a gravel road which is much better for walking as it’s not as hard on your feet as asphalt. Some stages of the Fishermen’s Trail are on the beach or dunes which makes walking more difficult and slower.\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nI would say the Rota Vicentina, especially the Fishermen’s Trail is more of a holiday trek. It has nothing to do with the pilgrimage. If you want to hike for a couple of days or a week and combine the walk with a beach holiday the Rota Vicentina is the perfect option. If you’re seeking a spiritual or cultural experience (architecture, historical towns, etc.) rather walk one of the Camino de Santiago routes.\n\nRota Vicentina planning resources\n\nCombine the Historical Way with the Coastal Route | The Fishermen’s Trail walking itinerary |\n\nWant to know more about the Camino de Santiago in Portugal? | The Portuguese Camino de Santiago detailed guide |\n\nTry another coastal walk in Portugal! | The Coastal Route of the Portuguese Camino de Santiago |\n\nLearn more about the Rota Vicentina | Rota Vicentina the official website |\n\nRent a car and visit more places in the Algarve | Find the best car rental deals|\n\nQuestions or Comments?\n\nGot any questions or comments?
