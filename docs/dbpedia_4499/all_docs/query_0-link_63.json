        "text": "Correction Appended\n\nPeter Benchley, whose 1974 novel \"Jaws\" turned shark attacks into a national obsession and who later used what he called his \"fish story\" to help promote oceanic conservation, died yesterday morning at his home in Princeton, N.J. He was 65.\n\nThe cause was pulmonary fibrosis, a progressive scarring of the lungs, said his wife, Wendy.\n\nEven before it was published, \"Jaws,\" Mr. Benchley's first novel, was becoming a sensation as word trickled out of the publishing business that a blockbuster story was on the way. Movie rights were bought up, magazine articles commissioned, and the great white shark was thrust into the spotlight in a way that foreshadowed the current national obsession with \"The Da Vinci Code.\"\n\nFor several years in the mid-1970's, the great white shark was the subject of essays and comedy skits, swimmers teased one another with the foreboding \"baa-dum\" theme music from the Steven Spielberg film, and lifeguards and town elders tried to assure vacationers that it was safe to go into the water.\n\nMr. Benchley, who even found himself enduring the wrath of Jacques Cousteau, said repeatedly in later years that he regretted making the great white shark into a villain. But he was always fascinated with the sea, having spent summers as a youth on Nantucket, and he returned there again and again for topics for his books, including \"The Deep\" in 1976, \"The Island\" in 1979 and \"Beast,\" a 1991 thriller about a giant squid that is driven to attack humans because its natural food sources have been depleted.\n\nHe came from a home with deep literary roots, the son of the novelist Nathaniel Benchley and the grandson of Robert Benchley, the humorist and drama editor of The New Yorker and Life magazines. And his first book, a travel memoir titled \"Time and a Ticket,\" published by Houghton Mifflin in 1964, reflected some of his upbringing as a graduate of Phillips Exeter Academy and of Harvard, where he graduated cum laude with a degree in English in 1961.\n\nThe memoir recounted a post-graduation trip around the world where the illusions of an idealistic young man are colored by the realization that what most people are searching for in an island paradise is \"a place that is spoiled, a place that looks unchanged but that has -- hidden among the trees -- aqualungs, water skis, sailboats, movie theaters, saloons, night clubs and dance bands.\"\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
