        "text": "From Canterbury/London on the A2. We have brown signs from the A258 Duke of York’s roundabout; 3rd exit towards Dover town centre, after 1 mile turn left into Upper Road. Our entrance is on the right after 1 mile, at the sharp bend in the road.\n\nFrom Ashford/London on the A20. We’re not far from Dover Castle, so coming into Dover keep going until you see a left turn into Woolcomber Street at the traffic lights (look for the Travelodge on the corner), there’s a handy filter lane and it’s signed for Dover Castle. At the next set of lights go straight over passing the retail park. At the bottom of Castle Hill at the next set of traffic lights, take a right uphill, you'll see our brown sign. Keep going past the castle entrance. When you get to the top of the hill there is another brown sign for the right turn opposite the entrance into Upper Road. Our car park entrance is 1 mile further down Upper Road, at the sharp bend in the road.\n\nParking: Car parking is charged as follows: £6.00 per car, motorhomes £9.00 and coaches £25.00. National Trust Members and Blue Badge Holders can park for free. Please have your card ready to be scanned at the entrance gatehouse. If you arrive when the car parking booth is closed, you can pay for your parking using the Pay by Phone app our location code is 803459 for cars (£6) and 803461 for mobile homes (£9). Please note: we have speed bumps on our roads which may require care with low-bodied cars\n\nSat Nav: Our postcode may take you to the eastern docks ferry terminal, use CT15 5NA following our brown signs and turn into the car park before you reach your destination at the sharp bend."
