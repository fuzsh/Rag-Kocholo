        "text": "CONFIDENT\n\nMake strong statements, not questions. People come looking for answers so having a strong point of view is crucial. Be direct and get to the point quickly. Don’t use the subjunctive. The words “if, maybe, but, may, could” don’t live in our vocabulary. The fewer adjectives, the shorter the sentences, and the less fluff the better. If you’re about to add a comma, think if a punchy full stop wouldn’t be better.\n\nHELPFUL\n\nWe are here to serve — to make things easier and simpler for our citizens. Anything we say or any information we give, should be useful, easy to understand, and relevant to that individual.\n\nOPTIMISTIC\n\nAnything is possible in our world. If there’s a problem, we can fix it with a little ingenuity. All copy and content should reflect this optimistic tone. Where there’s a will, there’s a way. And if there’s ever a problem being communicated, it’s accompanied by a plan of action to fix it. We may be dreamers, but — more importantly — we’re doers.\n\nHUMBLE\n\nWe may be confident, but we are never arrogant. Be conscious of what adjectives you may be using. Never be too verbose, or exaggerate. While your grammar should always be superb, your words should be simple. If your words have multiple syllables, rethink those words. Be careful how you describe your actions and plans. Keep in mind the people they’re meant to help.\n\nPERSONAL\n\nVisiting a website is a personal affair often done alone. Use personal pronouns like “we” and “you.\" Be honest. Be real. Be approachable. Be accessible and inclusive. Boston is made up of thousands of individuals, and you are there for every single one of them. However, never be too personal — slang or conversational language sounds strange coming from an institute of authority.\n\nYou can learn more about how to write in our brand voice here.\n\nFont installation guidance\n\nMac OS X\n\nIf you just need one font, double-click it and hit \"Install Font.\" If there are multiple fonts, you can do the same thing for each. Another option is to open \"Font Book\" and select and drag all of the fonts to Font Book's center column.\n\nTo find Font Book on your Mac, open a Finder window, pick \"Applications,\" and scroll down to Font Book.\n\nWindows 7 / Windows 8\n\nIf you just need one font, double-click it and hit \"Install.\" To choose more than one font, hit the \"Start\" button, then \"Control Panel > Appearance and Personalization.\" From here, choose \"Fonts.\" You can drag and drop the new fonts here.\n\nWindows Vista\n\nIf you just need one font, right-click on the font file and then hit \"Install.\" To choose more than one font, follow the directions above for Windows 7 / Windows 8.\n\nWindows XP\n\nYou can drag and drop the font files you'd like to install into the \"Fonts\" folder on your computer. Hit the \"Start\" button and search for \"C:\\Windows\\Fonts.\" One you have the folder open, drag and drop the fonts into it."
