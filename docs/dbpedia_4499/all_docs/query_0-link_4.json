        "text": "L'Albatros\n\nSouvent, pour s'amuser, les hommes d'équipage\n\nPrennent des albatros, vastes oiseaux des mers,\n\nQui suivent, indolents compagnons de voyage,\n\nLe navire glissant sur les gouffres amers.\n\nÀ peine les ont-ils déposés sur les planches,\n\nQue ces rois de l'azur, maladroits et honteux,\n\nLaissent piteusement leurs grandes ailes blanches\n\nComme des avirons traîner à côté d'eux.\n\nCe voyageur ailé, comme il est gauche et veule!\n\nLui, naguère si beau, qu'il est comique et laid!\n\nL'un agace son bec avec un brûle-gueule,\n\nL'autre mime, en boitant, l'infirme qui volait!\n\nLe Poète est semblable au prince des nuées\n\nQui hante la tempête et se rit de l'archer;\n\nExilé sur le sol au milieu des huées,\n\nSes ailes de géant l'empêchent de marcher.\n\n— Charles Baudelaire\n\nThe Albatross\n\nOften, to amuse themselves, the men of a crew\n\nCatch albatrosses, those vast sea birds\n\nThat indolently follow a ship\n\nAs it glides over the deep, briny sea.\n\nScarcely have they placed them on the deck\n\nThan these kings of the sky, clumsy, ashamed,\n\nPathetically let their great white wings\n\nDrag beside them like oars.\n\nThat winged voyager, how weak and gauche he is,\n\nSo beautiful before, now comic and ugly!\n\nOne man worries his beak with a stubby clay pipe;\n\nAnother limps, mimics the cripple who once flew!\n\nThe poet resembles this prince of cloud and sky\n\nWho frequents the tempest and laughs at the bowman;\n\nWhen exiled on the earth, the butt of hoots and jeers,\n\nHis giant wings prevent him from walking.\n\n— William Aggeler, The Flowers of Evil (Fresno, CA: Academy Library Guild, 1954)\n\nThe Albatross\n\nSometimes for sport the men of loafing crews\n\nSnare the great albatrosses of the deep,\n\nThe indolent companions of their cruise\n\nAs through the bitter vastitudes they sweep.\n\nScarce have they fished aboard these airy kings\n\nWhen helpless on such unaccustomed floors,\n\nThey piteously droop their huge white wings\n\nAnd trail them at their sides like drifting oars.\n\nHow comical, how ugly, and how meek\n\nAppears this soarer of celestial snows!\n\nOne, with his pipe, teases the golden beak,\n\nOne, limping, mocks the cripple as he goes.\n\nThe Poet, like this monarch of the clouds,\n\nDespising archers, rides the storm elate.\n\nBut, stranded on the earth to jeering crowds,\n\nThe great wings of the giant baulk his gait.\n\n— Roy Campbell, Poems of Baudelaire (New York: Pantheon Books, 1952)\n\nThe Albatross\n\nSometimes, to entertain themselves, the men of the crew\n\nLure upon deck an unlucky albatross, one of those vast\n\nBirds of the sea that follow unwearied the voyage through,\n\nFlying in slow and elegant circles above the mast.\n\nNo sooner have they disentangled him from their nets\n\nThan this aerial colossus, shorn of his pride,\n\nGoes hobbling pitiably across the planks and lets\n\nHis great wings hang like heavy, useless oars at his side.\n\nHow droll is the poor floundering creature, how limp and weak —\n\nHe, but a moment past so lordly, flying in state!\n\nThey tease him: One of them tries to stick a pipe in his beak;\n\nAnother mimics with laughter his odd lurching gait.\n\nThe Poet is like that wild inheritor of the cloud,\n\nA rider of storms, above the range of arrows and slings;\n\nExiled on earth, at bay amid the jeering crowd,\n\nHe cannot walk for his unmanageable wings.\n\n— George Dillon, Flowers of Evil (NY: Harper and Brothers, 1936)\n\nThe Albatross\n\nOften, as an amusement, crewmen\n\nCatch albatrosses, huge birds of the sea,\n\nWho follow, indolent companions of the voyage,\n\nThe ship gliding over the salty deeps.\n\nAs soon as they have placed them on the deck,\n\nThese kings of the sky, awkward and ashamed,\n\nPitiably let their large white wings\n\nDrag at their sides like oars.\n\nThis winged voyager, how gauche and weak he is!\n\nOnce so handsome, how comic and ugly he is!\n\nOne sailor irritates his beak with a pipestem,\n\nAnother mimes, as he limps, the invalid who once flew!\n\nThe Poet is like the prince of the clouds,\n\nWho haunts the tempest and mocks the archer;\n\nExiled on the earth in the midst of derision,\n\nHis giant wings keep him from walking.\n\n— Wallace Fowlie, Flowers of Evil (New York: Dover Publications, 1964)\n\nAlbatrosses\n\nOften our sailors, for an hour of fun,\n\nCatch albatrosses on the after breeze\n\nThrough which these trail the ship from sun to sun\n\nAs it skims down the deep and briny seas.\n\nScarce have these birds been set upon the poop,\n\nThan, awkward now, they, the sky's emperors,\n\nPiteous and shamed, let their great white wings droop\n\nBeside them like a pair of idle oars.\n\nThese wingèd voyagers, how gauche their gait!\n\nOnce noble, now how ludicrous to view!\n\nOne sailor bums them with his pipe, his mate\n\nLimps, mimicking these cripples who once flew.\n\nPoets are like these lords of sky and cloud,\n\nWho ride the storm and mock the bow's taut strings,\n\nExiled on earth amid a jeering crowd,\n\nPrisoned and palsied by their giant wings.\n\n— Jacques LeClercq, Flowers of Evil (Mt Vernon, NY: Peter Pauper Press, 1958)\n\nThe Albatross\n\nOften, to amuse themselves, the men of the crew\n\nCatch those great birds of the seas, the albatrosses,\n\nlazy companions of the voyage, who follow\n\nThe ship that slips through bitter gulfs.\n\nHardly have they put them on the deck,\n\nThan these kings of the skies, awkward and ashamed,\n\nPiteously let their great white wings\n\nDraggle like oars beside them.\n\nThis winged traveler, how weak he becomes and slack!\n\nHe who of late was so beautiful, how comical and ugly!\n\nSomeone teases his beak with a branding iron,\n\nAnother mimics, limping, the crippled flyer!\n\nThe Poet is like the prince of the clouds,\n\nHaunting the tempest and laughing at the archer;\n\nExiled on earth amongst the shouting people,\n\nHis giant's wings hinder him from walking."
