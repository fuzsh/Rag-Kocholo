        "text": "About this book\n\nBuy Richard Peirce's three UK shark books at a reduced price!\n\nSharks in British Seas is the first book in 17 years to deal with sharks off the coasts of the British Isles. Shark sightings have been on the increase in recent years, especially in the South-West. The second edition of this book contains revisions, updates, many new photographs, three new chapters, and additions to existing chapters. Sharks in British Seas seeks to appeal across the board to the shark buff or enthusiast, as well as shark 'lay' people with only a passing interest. The author clearly believes that sharks are there to be enjoyed and celebrated rather than feared, and are only dangerous when man is either unlucky or stupid, and he examines the realities of the dangers sharks pose to man. He also looks at the far more real threat posed by man to sharks.\n\nShark Attack Britain describes over twenty shark/human interaction incidents. George Burgess of the International Shark Attack File (ISAF) defines a shark attack as any directed action by a shark that either results in contact with a human, or would have done if the human didn't take evasive action. Some of the cases described in this book fit the ISAF definition, others involve shark bites in a toilet, a pub, a van and a restaurant! Human deaths caused by sharks are described as is an incident when a basking shark suicide bomber blew up the Royal Navy. Where Peirce's earlier book Sharks in British Seas introduced many to animals they hadn't realised existed in Britain's waters, this book shines the light of reality into the greyness of an area always beset by confusion.\n\nThe U.K. Great White Shark Enigma highlights how, in the ‘low news’ dull times of summer when the tabloids need to drum up stories to sell papers, possible Great White sightings always result in screaming headlines. What is the truth? Do Great Whites visit our shores? Are Great Whites a threat in British waters? Richard Peirce, past chairman of both the Shark Trust and the Shark Conservation Society has kept records of claimed Great White shark sightings for 20 years. This book summarises his findings, answers the questions, and is a must-read for all those interested in this fascinating enigma.\n\nCustomer Reviews"
