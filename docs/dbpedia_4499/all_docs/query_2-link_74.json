        "text": "Horizon: An American Saga is the first in Kevin Costner’s 4-movie Western epic, a quartet I hope the filmmaker and star completes. I genuinely enjoyed the sprawling, three-hour film, though it has some issues that I wish Costner had avoided in his opening salvo, which needed to win big with audiences and critics and has failed on both counts.\n\nThe movie is currently at a pretty dispiriting 40% on Rotten Tomatoes (69% with audiences) and is looking like a box office flop. The movie probably would have been better—or at least more accessible and appealing—with a shorter runtime and at least one fewer plotlines.\n\nAs it stands, the three-hour film is a loosely tied-together batch of what almost feels like three separate movies, with very little connective tissue weaving them into a cohesive whole. One of these only pops up about two thirds of the way through the picture—a wagon trail storyline centered on Luke Wilson’s character, Matthew Van Weyden. I wish Costner had saved it for Chapter 2—not because it’s bad, but because it feels like a distraction from the other two main stories.\n\nThe first of these takes place at the fledgling settlement of Horizon, built on the banks of a river in Apache country. The indigenous people resent the white settlers, who take their land and drive away the game. A large portion of the early part of the movie involves a brutal Apache raid on the settlers.\n\nThen this story splits in two, with some of our main character heading to a nearby military outpost and others setting off with bounty hunters, out for revenge—and Indian scalps. Frances Kittredge (Sienna Miller) and her daughter Elizabeth (Georgia MacPhail) are taken to safety by Sgt. Thomas Riordan (Michael Rooker) and Lieutenant Trent Gephart (Sam Worthington). Young Russell Ganz (Etienne Kellici) heads off with the bounty hunters.\n\nA good portion of this storyline also revolves around the Apache themselves, with the young, warlike Pionsenay (Owen Crow Shoe) determined to kill the settlers and drive them away against the wishes of his father. While the Native Americans in the film are handled with nuance and respect, they still play a relatively minor role compared to the white settlers.\n\nA second main storyline follows a woman who calls herself Ellen (Jena Malone) who escapes her abusive husband and takes her child south from Montana Territory into Wyoming Territory. This is where Kevin Costner’s character, a horse trader named Hayes Ellison, comes into the picture as well as Marigold (Abbey Lee) a prostitute who gets caught up in the violence that follows, as Ellen’s pursuers catch up with her and her young son.\n\nThese are the Sykes brothers, Caleb (Jamie Campbell Bower, who you may know as Vecna from Stranger Things) and his older, larger sibling, Junior (Jon Beavers).\n\nI won’t go into more detail on either of these main plotlines, but there was enough material between the two of them to fill an entire movie without the addition of a wagon train and a third cast of characters to keep track of on their journey west. With none of the three stories converging, and all ending without any real conclusion, the film feels less like a complete movie and more like an introduction—or the first three episodes of a mini-series.\n\nThe most bizarre part about it, however, is the ending. Instead of ending like a normal movie it simply goes directly into an extended montage—basically a trailer—of what’s coming in Chapter 2. There’s nothing to denote this. There’s no ‘The End’ let us know this film is done. Even knowing this was the first of four movies, I found myself a little confused. Were these shots a montage showing us what happens between this film and the next? Was this a trailer? I’m sure if I went to this blind instead of pretty well-informed I’d be completely baffled. An odd choice to be sure.\n\nStill, I really loved most of this movie. It’s gorgeous, for one thing. I wish I’d been able to see it on a bigger screen. I’d love to see it on an IMAX screen, though I don’t think it was released on IMAX. Cinematographer J. Michael Muro—who worked with Costner on his previous Western, Open Range—does incredible work capturing the beauty and grandeur of the American southwest. This is all shot in my backyard (I live in Northern Arizona and the filming primarily took place in Southern Utah) and I loved seeing the canyonlands and mesas, the mountainsides golden with aspen groves. The score, composed by John Debney, does a great job harkening back to classic Westerns, and while it’s not the most memorable it captures that same sweeping sense of Americana.\n\nIt’s not a perfect film, and the pacing and editing at times can feel a bit jarring, with time-jumps that leave too much out, rushing certain stories because even with three hours there is simply too much going on, too many characters and too many different stories to possibly keep track of everything, let alone develop every thread into something like what you’d expect in a Western, or really any film. I think Costner made a pretty big error not tightening it up and releasing something shorter and more structured, because I think the length and pacing will turn a lot of people off (I was never personally bored, but I bet a lot of people will be).\n\nI found it tense, exciting, romantic, even poetic at times, and with a surprising amount of humor. It’s just messy and I can’t help but think it would be better suited as a 12-episode premium TV series. I’m glad it’s not, simply because I’m happy I get to see it in theaters.\n\nThe movie has a great sense of place—with its sweeping vistas and distinct locations—but it has a terrible sense of time, and that plus the fact that nothing is resolved and none of these characters ever cross paths, make it feel very incomplete. And that’s fine, it is incomplete, but as an opening salvo I think Costner and his collaborators needed to hit a bullseye.\n\nCostner spent $38 million of his own money on this project (so far). I genuinely hope he can raise enough money to finish all four films. Chapter 2 releases this August, and this reviewer will be there on opening night.\n\nWatch my video review below:"
