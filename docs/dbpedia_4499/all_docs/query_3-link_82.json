Click to download the free sample version Download sample\n\nHyperbole is a figure of speech you use when you want to exaggerate what you mean or emphasize a point. It comes from the Greek word to mean “excess” and is often used to make something sound much bigger, better, funnier, or more dramatic than it actually is. Hyperbole is a useful tool in language.\n\nIn American and British English, hyperbole is pronounced ‘HI-PUR-BOW-LEE’.\n\nHere are some examples of hyperbole\n\nThere’s enough food on the table to feed an entire army!\n\nI’m so hungry, I could eat an elephant.\n\nIt took forever to climb the hill.\n\nMy legs felt like jelly after riding the rollercoaster.\n\nThese shoes are killing me!\n\nLet’s look specifically at the first example. Here, the speaker doesn’t literally mean that there’s enough food on the table to feed the hundreds of people in an army. Instead, the speaker is using hyperbole to exaggerate the amount of food that they have and that it is more than enough to feed the number of people present.\n\nHyperbole can also be used to make something sound much worse than it actually is. For example: “My shoes are killing me!” – the speaker doesn’t literally mean that the shoes are attacking the wearer and will kill them, but it is using hyperbole to be dramatic and emphasize their opinion that their shoes are causing them a lot of discomfort or pain.\n\nExamples of Hyperbole in Everyday Speech\n\nTake a look at the following list of hyperbolic phrases. How many of them have you heard or used before?\n\nHe’s running faster than the wind.\n\nThe teacher asked us to be quiet a million times.\n\nIt was so cold, even the polar bears were shivering.\n\nThis bag weighs a ton.\n\nThere were a million questions in the math test today.\n\nThat man is as tall as a house.\n\nThat trend is as old as the dinosaurs.\n\nThis is the worst day of my life.\n\nI’d never do that. Not in a million years!\n\nMy dad will kill me when he comes home.\n\nThat guy has tons of money.\n\nYour skin is softer than silk.\n\nShe’s as skinny as a toothpick.\n\nShe was so happy; her smile was a mile wide.\n\nThe footballer is the best player of all time.\n\nI’m so hungry I could eat a horse.\n\nIt’s impossible to complete this puzzle.\n\nNext Friday is never going to arrive.\n\nI’ve read this book a hundred times.\n\nMy hand hurts so much it’s going to drop off.\n\nMy fingers are so cold, they’re going to shatter!\n\nMy brother is stronger than iron.\n\nShe’s my guardian angel.\n\nYour brain is the size of a pea.\n\nI’m so sad that I’m drowning in tears.\n\nThe leaves are dancing in the breeze.\n\nHow to use Hyperbole (so it’s not a total disaster)\n\nThere are a few things to keep in mind when using hyperbole. Firstly, you want to figure out whether you’re wanting to exaggerate a feeling or the volume and quantity of something. For example, I was so excited I was going to explode! demonstrates that the person was extremely excited for something. Whereas, I had a mountain of homework to do describes the large volume of assignments that the person needed to complete.\n\nThe next step is to ensure that your choice of hyperbole makes sense and sounds natural. It would be awkward to say our homework was the size of the Eiffel Tower. Yes, the Eiffel Tower is tall, but it’s better suited to describing length and height rather than volume.\n\nExamples of Hyperbole in Poetry and Literature\n\nHyperbole is often used in poems and books because it helps to emphasize part of the story and evoke a response from the reader. Hyperbole can help the writer to get their point across so that you understand the emotion, seriousness or humor of the situation.\n\nFor example, in Shakespeare’s “Macbeth” he writes:\n\n“Will all great Neptune’s ocean wash this blood\n\nClean from my hand? No.”\n\nIn this example, Macbeth is using hyperbole to say that not even an entire ocean could wash his hands clean. Macbeth is using hyperbole to exaggerate the situation.\n\nIn her book ‘To Kill a Mockingbird’, the author Harper Lee writes:\n\n“A day was twenty-four hours long but seemed longer. There was no hurry, for there was nowhere to go, nothing to buy and no money to buy it with, nothing to see outside the boundaries of Maycomb County.”\n\nIn this example, the author is using hyperbole to emphasize how slow and boring the town is. The hyperbolic phrases in this sentence help the reader to understand the situation as, without them, the sentence doesn’t appear as emotive. Have a go at re-writing Harper Lee’s sentence above without the hyperbole and see how it sounds!\n\nThe following poem by Shel Silverstein, titled “Rain”, shows some great examples of hyperbole. Can you identify them?\n\nI opened my eyes\n\nAnd looked up at the rain,\n\nAnd it dripped in my head\n\nAnd flowed into my brain,\n\nAnd all that I hear as I lie in my bed\n\nIs the slishity-slosh of the rain in my head.\n\nI step very softly,\n\nI walk very slow,\n\nI can’t do a handstand–\n\nI might overflow,\n\nSo pardon the wild crazy thing I just said–\n\nI’m just not the same since there’s rain in my head.\n\nHyperbole Worksheets\n\nThis bundle contains 5 ready-to-use hyperbole worksheets that are perfect to test student knowledge and understanding of what hyperbole is and how it can be used.

For example, in complaining about a chilly climate or temperature, one may say, “The cold is freezing me to death!” One of the most popular hyperbole examples is “I’m so hungry I could eat a horse.”\n\nIn what poems or other pieces of literature can the use of hyperbole be found?\n\nShakespeare’s Macbeth, Harper Lee’s To Kill a Mockingbird, and Shel Silverstein’s Rain are just some of the famous works of literature in which the use of hyperbole can be observed.\n\nLink/cite this page\n\nIf you reference any of the content on this page on your own website, please use the code below to cite this page as the original source.\n\nLink will appear as Hyperbole Examples and Worksheets: https://kidskonnect.com - KidsKonnect, February 15, 2022\n\nUse With Any Curriculum\n\nThese worksheets have been specifically designed for use with any international curriculum.
