        "text": "OHRVing in NH\n\nOHRVing in New Hampshire is one of the state’s most popular forms of summer recreation. With 1,000 miles of OHRV trails throughout the state, it’s easy to see why.\n\nWhile there are a number of trails on state owned or managed land that are maintained by the New Hampshire Bureau of Trails, the majority of trails are on private land. 70% of New Hampshire land is privately owned. Private land trails are maintained by the local snowmobile clubs. The clubs are responsible for obtaining landowner permission and maintaining the trails based on their wishes. It is essential that snowmobilers respect landowners’ wishes and their land. NO RESPECT = NO TRAILS\n\nNew Hampshire State law provides certain protections for landowners who open their land to those using it for outdoor recreation.\n\nOHRVers can only ride on trails designated and signed as a OHRV trail. Riders should familiarize themselves with signage and state laws.\n\nThere is no digital OHRV map produced by the state at this time, but plans are in the works to generate one in the future. For now, clubs sell paper maps through their individual websites for their club systems. NH Off Highway Vehicle Association (NHOHVA) has a NH state map to show where the trail systems are in general throughout the state.\n\nOHRV Trail Signage\n\nNew Hampshire’s OHRV trail signs have been created based on international standards for the safety of riders, as well as the rest of the public.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause who wants to be out on the trail lost? It’s not a good feeling when your gas is getting low and you don’t know where you are or how far away the pumps are. Or what if a rider experiences a medical emergency and needs to let help know their location? And riders should always be able to tell if they are still on an authorized trail system, or have taken an incorrect turn.\n\nIt is the rider’s responsibility to familiarize themselves with trail signs and follow direction of them while using New Hampshire’s trail system.\n\nOHRV clubs should keep in mind that trail users may not be familiar with their trail system and sign appropriately and adequately. The Bureau of Trails (BOT) has created Trail Signing Guidelines to assist clubs in knowing where and how to post trail signs. The BOT urges all clubs to follow these guidelines and to use the signs supplied by the Bureau so that trails are uniformly marked throughout the State.\n\nRemember to respect landowners and stay on designated trails! Without landowners' permission, there would be no trail system!\n\nNorth Country Region\n\nGreat North Woods Riders ATV Club (Pittsburg)\n\nwww.greatnorthwoodsridersatv.org\n\nClub's Facebook Page\n\nCurrent Trail Status: OPEN but with some closures.
