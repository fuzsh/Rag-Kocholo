        "text": "May 17, 2023\n\n4.5 rounded up\n\nThis is a love story but unlike one I have ever read before. Lewis and Wren meet and fall in love. They are utterly different, so opposite but somehow they balance each other out. He is arty, a school theatre teacher and outgoing, she is quiet, likes structure but their relationship works. When Lewis develops some odd symptoms a visit to a doctor eventually leads to a diagnosis that he will transform in the next nine months into a great white shark. What, I hear you cry?? Yes, that’s my reaction too! He will retain his human consciousness but his physical body will be that of one of the oceans most dangerous predators. The novel focuses on their story but also that of Wren’s mother Angela, her childhood and growing up.\n\nI think it’s absolutely fair to say that this is one of the oddest, strangest and weirdest books I have ever read but it totally captivates me. At its heart it is a moving story of people who face the impossible, it’s about hanging on to love, but also coming to terms with grief, loss or with regret. At times it’s funny (usually Lewis, he’s quite a character) at others it’s sad, heartbreaking and occasionally disturbing. It’s fascinating viewing how Lewis and Wren react to the diagnosis and how they adapt or otherwise.\n\nThere are some magical realism elements and I particularly like these sections which are also a metaphor for how we change and adapt throughout our lives, such as via our bodies or through relationships. Life is also transient and one of those messages is to grab life by the scruff of the neck and relish those moments as none of us know what’s around the corner.\n\nIt’s written in a very different way too. At times it’s poetic, it’s vivid, at others it’s set out as a play or a movie and somehow the author cleverly makes it work. The ending is good, thought maybe a little neat. This is a very different and thought provoking book and one I’ll certainly remember. This is a fiction debut and all I can say is wow, what will follow this?\n\nWith thanks to NetGalley and especially to Quercus Books for the much appreciated arc in return for an honest review.\n\nAugust 8, 2023\n\n“Yes, Lewis. Yes. I will marry you.”\n\n(This is what I would say to Lewis if I was Wren and I lived inside the pages of Emily Habeck’s debut novel, Shark Heart.)\n\nThe book opens with one of the most gorgeous marriage proposals I’ve ever read in literature – Lewis to Wren, asking her to spend the rest of her life with him.\n\nAnd after I read it, I was instantly smitten with the writing, the characters, and the unique nature of this love story.\n\nHow unique is it? It’s this kind of unique: Lewis and Wren are newlyweds when Lewis is diagnosed with a shark mutation, meaning his body will transform into that of a great white shark.\n\nThis devastates their marriage and destroys their dreams. Together, they’re mourning the crumbling of their union; as individuals, Lewis is losing his teaching career and his dreams of being an actor, while Wren is left to rebuild her life and find new joy. What will her life look like without Lewis in it? Can they still somehow be together, a human and a shark?\n\nHabeck’s way of telling the story is fablelike in feel and emotional without being overwrought. And she experiments with style, sometimes slipping into poetry and other times laying out the scenes like a play. The way it all comes together is beautiful.\n\nThe novel does stumble, though. Halfway through, the story switches from Lewis and Wren to Wren’s mother, telling the mother’s story of neglectful parents and an abusive relationship. It goes on for way too long, takes too much focus off Lewis and Wren, and feels unnecessary. I see the point of it, but the point could’ve been made in a more concise way.\n\nBut really, Shark Heart is such an impressive and original debut that I can’t even fathom what Habeck will write next. Whatever it is, I’ll be waiting for it.\n\nMy sincerest appreciation to Emily Habeck, S&S/ Marysue Rucci Books, and NetGalley for the digital review copy. All opinions included herein are my own.\n\nAugust 1, 2023\n\nI’m just a girl, raving about a shark book, asking you to trust me.\n\nIf you told me I would become wholeheartedly invested in the story of a man who turns into a shark I wouldn’t believe you. SHARK HEART was the bizarrely beautiful book I never knew I needed.\n\nTold in alternating timelines, the story follows Wren and her husband Lucas as he receives the devastating diagnosis that he will slowly transform into a Great White shark.\n\nThis layered story explored the nuances of change and was so much more than I expected. The plot was entirely implausible and I have no idea *how* it worked, but I could not tear myself away from these pages. The writing was stunning, the structure was unique, and the themes of love and loss in various forms simply shined.\n\nEmily Habeck took a bold chance on an imaginative premise and I’m so grateful she did.\n\nRATING: 5/5\n\nPUB DATE: August 8, 2023\n\nAugust 27, 2023\n\nthe author looked at \"would you still love me if i was a worm\" and went \"what if instead of silly, this was actually a sad question\"\n\nread as part of 202-Queer 🌈✨ (bi MC)\n\nAugust 28, 2023\n\nOkay buckle up\n\nA real let down for me.\n\nPaper thin characters that are full of contradictions. Does Wren not have enough money to take care of her husband? Or has she been saving tons of money from her high paying job for years? Because both things are said. Why is it that Wren is the most meek, subdued, person who only cares for other people and never herself, but somehow is also supposed to be extremely independent and pragmatic? Why did she randomly date a woman for like 3 pages? Literally, the author makes a point to say that wren didn’t understand art until her husband began showing it to her?? Wtf? She doesn’t want children, but a page later always wanted to be a mom? She was an outcast, but also very popular, beautiful, but didn’t care about looks- truly, just a manic pixie dream girl and a husk of a character.\n\nLewis, the husband, has zero substance. He treats Wren like the idea of a person, rather than an actual human. He’s the prefect professor who does everything right for his classes and everyone loves him for it, but everyone knows this except him because he’s just so good at being a teacher that he doesn’t think of things like that. He makes a point to tell his classes all these encouraging things, but later in the book is like, “I wish I’d told them all the encouraging things.” So did he, or didn’t he? Without his wife, his life would have no order and he brings nothing to the table. Later as a shark, he’s guided and saved by a female shark (more on that later) who hunts with him and keeps him safe, all the while he’s still brining nothing to the table. He’s like a child the entire story who “loves” his wife with no depth beyond how she makes him feel about himself.\n\nThen there’s a character referred to only as Tiny Pregnant Woman, for what feels like no purpose at all. Other than to die in childbirth off screen. Idk\n\nPart two-\n\nStarts with the grooming and impregnating of a 15 year old, so there’s that. Just wow no bad\n\nThen we find out Wren’s mother also turned into an animal. A Komodo dragon, I wish I was kidding. Somehow this never came up when Wren was watching the same disease take her husband. I guess she was too busy only existing to move his plot line forward.\n\nPart three-\n\nAfter wren decided not to unalive herself, which comes out of nowhere and is over in a moment, it turns out she was pregnant. So now she’s got a daughter and that’s kinda the end of the book really\n\nOther things-\n\nVery weak metaphors that feel more like instagram captions.\n\nIt’s normal for authors to repeat words as a narrative device: “he was falling, falling, falling.” But the author uses these repetitive words and phrases so consistently, and with such length that the whole thing is just meandering and a little ridiculous.\n\nSTOP writing books and publishing books where an entire chapter takes up less than half a page. Much of this book, and almost the entire last third, is pages half filled with word, or less. The rest is just wasted space. Several of these “chapters” are single sentences. It seems like an irresponsible use of paper and resources.\n\nAlso this book has weird jumps to the style of a written play, but honestly I was so distracted by the other issues going on, that I barely registered them.\n\n-what’s working here:\n\nMargaret C. Finnegan is perfect and must be protected at all costs. She’s a very side character, another human who turned into a shark when she was in her teens, that finds Lewis in the ocean after his transformation. She’s blunt and sweet and has no patience for his shitty ego. I loved her. But she’s basically just a model of Dory from finding Nemo, so what’s not to love?\n\nIn conclusion-\n\nThe concept could be great: Someone you love slowly becoming something foreign and the struggle of trying to love each other through that, but this completely falls short. I couldn’t tell if it was trying to be serious, humorous, satirical, heartfelt, or campy and I don’t think it knew either, which only served to make it a failure in all categories. (Just read our wives under the sea instead)\n\nFor anyone interested, the turning into animals thing, in universe, is basically like a cancer. Fairly common, there’s infrastructure and treatments around it, but it’s not curable. If you don’t release your loved one into their new natural environment when they change, they’re euthanized. That’s insane and would have been a great driving tension in the book, but is only mentioned once and never talked about again. Also, the transformation on the husband starts with “his nose became cartilage, no longer the triangle of bone it once was.” —— human noses ARE cartilage. Seems like no research was done on biology except for what you could find in an early 2000’s ZooBook.\n\nSo just, I’m glad people aren’t afraid to write weird books with unconventional ideas, but maybe this one should have been given another draft or seven before it was sent to the print.\n\nThis entire review has been hidden because of spoilers.\n\nMay 3, 2023\n\nI am unwell.\n\nThere was a publisher’s note at the beginning of this, stating that it made them bawl and to trust it even though the premise of “man turns into great white shark” is unusual.\n\nNow, I personally don’t need persuading to read a book about a man who turns into a shark but I wondered how exactly it would make one cry and then it promptly broke my heart into a million pieces.\n\nThis was so well written, witty and funny in the way that makes you snort and then burst into tears. I had to put my kindle down repeatedly because my soul was being ripped apart by Lewis. Or Wren. Or her mom. Or the woman pregnant with birds.\n\nI adore magical realism but I’ve never been taken through the full range of human emotion by it like Shark Heart has done. The hopefulness permeating this story was intoxicating. The play sections gave it a sort of lightness that I really enjoyed. Watching everything come together to deliver this, at the same time heart wrenching and heartening story was so fun and sad and tragic and hopeful and wonderful.\n\nI can’t do this book justice in my review. Just know it’s a beautiful exploration of what it means to be human and that I can’t recommend it enough.\n\nThank you to Quercus and NetGalley for providing this ARC in exchange for my honest opinion.\n\nMay 1, 2023\n\nThis novel arose from a great and daring inspiration, one of the best ‘what if’s’ I’ve come across, but as I read I couldn’t help but feel the story itself stayed in a safe and predictable zone of happenings, rather than taking full advantage of the setup.\n\nAugust 29, 2023\n\nI don't know what I expected from a novel whose elevator pitch is \"a man who is gradually turning into a Great White Shark,\" but it certainly wasn't an emotional gut punch.\n\nThe plot summary is indeed a little weird. At the outset, newlyweds Lewis and Wren receive the diagnosis that means he will gradually turn into a shark. In the world of the book, this isn't altogether unheard of. Some people mutate into other types of animals much like they develop other diseases in our world; there are policies in place to handle this and facilities that provide treatment. You're going to have to engage in a healthy suspension of disbelief in order to appreciate this book.\n\nBut it isn't some gritty sci-fi or horror novel. The subtitle is A Love Story, and that's absolutely what Shark Heart is. It's a tender, emotional exploration of the effect the diagnosis has on Lewis and Wren, as a couple and as individuals. The writing is kind of unusual, as some chapters are written as though they were scripts (Lewis once dreamed of becoming a playwright) and some are written in free verse poetry. Very few chapters are more than three pages, many clocking in at just one paragraph. It's nonlinear, as Emily Habeck takes her reader through the early days of Wren and Lewis' romance, but also Wren's childhood - and then, what happens when she has to let go of Lewis as the transformation becomes complete. This can make things feel a little disjointed at times, but trust me: it all comes together eventually.\n\nAnd, I don't know. It was just lovely. It's often very sad, as Wren desperately wants to find a way to stay with Lewis even after he becomes a shark, but it never felt manipulative to me. I think that's because the characters felt very authentic, even as they were going through some very strange experiences. I went into this with a healthy dose of skepticism but I'm so glad I went in, because this may end up being my favorite book of the year.\n\nJanuary 25, 2024\n\n4 stars\n\n“They say the first year of marriage is the hardest,”\n\nHow hard you might ask?\n\nLewis and Wren are newlyweds when Lewis was diagnosed with some kind of mutation which means he will be turning into a big white shark very soon.\n\nThis book was so sad yet so beautiful! I loved everything about it, from how stunning the writing was, to the unique concept and the author’s unique storytelling ability. This was more than a magical realism book about a man turning into a shark. It was all about the struggle and grief of losing someone you love to something without being able to do anything about it. Seeing those two so in love and so in sync then struggling with losing it all? It was just so sad. I loved that it wasn’t really about a man turning into a shark, but how she used to make it like that!\n\nShe knew Wren was a perfectionist not because she wanted to be but because she felt she had to be to survive in an unfair world.\n\nWhat I was totally obsessed with, is how freakin relatable Wren was!! It was scary getting introduced to her character and how much I could see myself in her. I’ve highlighted many lines about her that i could totally see myself in them, it was scary.\n\nknowing the only thing more terrifying than seeing his future through his own eyes would be seeing it through hers.\n\nThe main reason this is not a five stars is because it kinda dragged in the middle and the ending was a little bit neat and predictable, I guess it was intended tho. overall it was a quick sad beautiful unique bizarre book that I’ll be thinking about for a while. What an experience!\n\n“You make everything better than when you found it,\n\nespecially me.”\n\nSeptember 10, 2023\n\nas taylor swift would say... weird, but fucking beautiful\n\nAugust 4, 2023\n\nYou’ll either love this book or hate it. It’s such an abstract obscure bizarre concept. I didn’t mind the first part and the story of Wren and Lewis but there were so many loose ends that never really wrapped up. Part\n\nTwo took is back to Wren’s mom and how Wren came about. That felt out of place. And then part three brought us back to Wren present day. I tried to deal with the magical realism with this world having humans turning into animals by comparing it to our world with humans getting sick with various illnesses or cancer. Was the writing ok? Yes. But honestly, this book was so beyond and bizarre. The narration was quick (thank goodness).\n\nMay 27, 2024\n\nBig news guys… I have officially read 1000 books!!! 🎉🥳🎉🙌🏻🍾🥂 Okay… back to the review…\n\nAs strange as the idea of slowly morphing into an animal sounds, their struggles were surprisingly relatable. It was easy to draw parallels to other chronic and fatal illnesses as well as to illnesses like dementia that take the person from their loved ones in mind if not in body. I was very intrigued by the premise but I think in the end it was a little too tragic for my taste. It was already very sad and then the author shared Angela’s story and that took things a bit too far for me. Poor Wren. That is more than anyone should ever have to suffer through, but I suppose life is not always fair.\n\nI was also a little bothered by the way Lewis’s dialogue was written. It almost felt like he had shark brain the entire book. His lines were all very stilted and lacked the appropriate emotional affectations. It read like the character was autistic which would be perfectly acceptable if I believed it was intentional rather than just poor writing. The ending felt abrupt and I didn’t feel like any of our characters found true resolution. I think this could have been great but in the end it was just okay. 3 stars is generous.\n\nMarch 25, 2024\n\nI devoured Shark Heart in less than two days. It’s compulsively readable, wholly original, and filled with every form of love. I promise it will keep you guessing as it did me. Shark Heart brings all the emotion.\n\nI know this one sounds far fetched in premise, but sometimes it pays to go outside the lines; and in this case, it absolutely did.\n\nI received a gifted copy and also purchased a copy.\n\nMany of my reviews can also be found on my blog: www.jennifertarheelreader.com and instagram: www.instagram.com/tarheelreader\n\nOctober 11, 2023\n\nWhile other authors with the name of Habeck have been struggling lately (and that's a joke for our Germans out there, see Dr. Robert Habeck! ;-)), Emily Habeck's debut novel is a bona fide banger: The plotline about a husband turning into a shark remains rather predictable once you know the premise, but the way the story deals with terminal illness, care work, and grief is innovative, daring and very moving. Our protagonist Wren is the daughter of a teenage mother who was affected by an illness that slowly turned her into a reptile, which Wren had to witness as a child growing up. Now, as a young wife, her husband transforms into a great white shark, with Wren once again doing her most to support the person she loves, but ultimately helpless in the face of a terminal condition that forces her to let go of a beloved human: Lewis is released into the ocean, where he tries to adapt to his new way of existing.\n\nThere is so much in here about the helplessness, anger and grief of caretakers witnessing their loved ones changing and suffering, about loss, grief, and acceptance, and all of that is discussed in the realm of magical realism, which, for once, puts this narrative device to good use (as opposed to the many gimmicky and cutesy books that employ the method). As the daughter of a parent with severe chronic illness who died over the span of several years, I was deeply moved by Wren's struggles, as she tries to gain control over life, to protect herself against random destiny, but in the end, she has to fail - which also sets her free to enjoy random beauty and serendipity.\n\nSure, there are sentences that try to do too much and fail, the experimental structure sometimes lacks discipline, and, worst of all, there is an element of kitsch here and there, but you know what? I don't care, this novel is wise, compassionate, and goes all in in order to try something new while discussing a topic that hardly features in literature at all. I applaud Emily Habeck for her will to innovate and her apparent knowledge of the realities of care work, which she has transformed into art.\n\nApril 18, 2023\n\n“We finally have everything back from the lab. The diagnosis is very clear,” Dr. Ramirez said briskly to mask the gravity of what came next. “You’re in the early stages of a Carcharodon carcharias mutation.”\n\n“Carcharo — What?”\n\n. . .\n\n“Carcharodon carcharias. Great white shark.”\n\nAs a debut novelist, all I can discover about Emily Habeck is that she has a BFA in Theatre from SMU’s Meadows School of the Arts and Masters Degrees from Vanderbilt Divinity School and Vanderbilt’s Peabody College; and that background is perfectly represented in Shark Heart. Nominally a story about relationships and letting go, this novel asks big questions about finding meaning in life, and especially through art and service to others. Written in a variety of styles — some sections read like a dramatic script, some are in iambic pentameter; some are lyrical and touching, some funny and a few sentences long — and set in a world where it’s just accepted that a person could suddenly start to mutate into an animal (which serves as a metaphor for really any illness or strain in a relationship), there’s a real feeling of Habeck throwing every idea she has at this novel. And that’s a double-edged sword: I found this novel to be charming and moving in its unrestrained scattershotting, but I also felt like it could have benefitted from some restraint; I would have liked this even more if it had been longer and more focussed (for example, either give us more on secondary characters like Rachel and George or leave them out of it), but that’s not to say that I wasn’t charmed and moved. There is much to like in Shark Heart, and I am intrigued to discover what Habeck might come up with next; rounding up to four stars. (Note: I read an ARC through NetGalley and passages quoted may not be in their final forms.)\n\n“This is something different. It’s a contemporary play with mythical undertones. I want it to have the kind of wise humanity that only time and hardship earn. I hope that anyone who reads it will feel immediately connected to the version of themselves that is most alive, ready, and strong.”\n\n“What’s it about?”\n\n“It’s a love story about forging ahead while facing great and immediate change.”\n\nShark Heart opens on a love story: Lewis gave up on his dream of being a stage actor and returned from NYC to his hometown of Dallas to become a high school drama teacher, eventually meeting the woman of his dreams, Wren — a person of quiet beauty and self-control who works in finance because numbers are solid and predictable (unlike her childhood). After being together for a few years they decide to get married, but within weeks, Lewis notices changes in his body and is diagnosed with an “animal dementia”, the Carcharodon carcharias mutation. Habeck neatly handles this alt reality: Lewis expects to keep working his job (despite growing rows of razor teeth and succumbing to fits of uncontrollable rage), and while he understands that he will eventually need to be released into the ocean, he wants to spend his last few human months making art (directing and writing) and being in physical contact with the love of his life (even if that means sleeping together in a cold salt bath). Meanwhile, Wren is put in the position of uncomplaining caregiver; and while she is clear-eyed about her husband’s future, she has fantasies about not letting him go. This is an undeniably lovely romance.\n\nAs their saltwater tears combined with the sea, Lewis finally understood the log line of their love story: He was an aimless kite in search of a string to ground him to the world, but instead, he’d found Wren, a great, strong wind who supported his exploration of the sky.\n\nThe plot goes back in time to the story of Wren’s mother, Angela: the neglected daughter of a crumbling marriage, I absolutely believed that at fifteen, she could be seduced by the first older houseboat-living hippie-philosopher who paid her any attention. Angela’s story leads into the story of Wren’s challenging childhood, and I’ll put my spoilery observation behind tags: I loved how Wren’s experience in the present shows the playing out of intergenerational trauma: Angela’s mother had been a cold and narcissistic drunk, and although Angela had intended to be a much better mother herself, she was diagnosed with a slow-moving mutation that would eventually turn her into a komodo dragon — forcing Wren to become a caregiver to an increasingly forgetful, distant, and cold-blooded “monster” (much as Angela must have viewed her own mother; this animal mutation conceit is a great metaphorical tool).\n\nWren did not see her mother as a sick woman living within a body she no longer knew or controlled. Instead, she saw a pathetic, powerless beast surrounded by murder, a mess of blood and guts. As rage bubbled up and spilled over, Wren sharpened a pernicious, worded arrow and lobbed it at the bull’s-eye, her mother.\n\n“You are a monster.”\n\nHer mother’s face and head fell in succession.\n\n“I know,” Angela whispered. “I know. I am.”\n\nThe storyline eventually spools out into Wren’s future and shows what she has learned from her experiences:\n\nShe considers how life is like a spiraling trail up a mountain. Each circling lap represents a learning cycle, the same lesson at a slightly higher elevation. Wren realizes she likes to rest as much as she likes to climb. She begins to enjoy the view…Afterward, Wren realizes she herself is the mountain she’s been climbing all along.\n\nAnd so maybe the ending is a little tidy, and maybe all the changing formats is a little gimmicky, but there is heart and meaning here and I thoroughly enjoyed the experience.\n\nSeptember 27, 2023\n\nSHARK HEART—a book about a woman who marries a man who slowly turns into a great white shark 🦈💚📚 yes… you heard that right 👀\n\nPSA—this will be the most unique and weird book you read this year 😂 this was definitely a #bookstagrammademedoit book…\n\nwhere do i begin? let me start off by saying i can see why people love this book. it’s unique, it’s cute, it moved quickly, it makes you think. but a few things prevented me from loving it. i really enjoy magical realism too, but for this one you REALLY have to suspend your belief and see the metaphor here 😅 when the mom plot started happening, i lost it… iykyk 🦎\n\nat a conceptual level, it was missing a paragraph to set the scene and tie it all together—what year is this? why are people mutating into animals? how many are there? how does the govt know and have scientists in labs working on treatment? this book moves really quick and talks about too much. i think maybe i went too fast and the expectations were too high—bookstagram REALLY hyped this one up and per usual that makes or breaks a book for me!\n\nSHARK HEART tackles a lot of meaningful and ponderous plots about loss, grief, marriage, motherhood, finding happiness and living life to the fullest and love in general. there’s love and heartbreak and it will get emotional at parts (the ocean scene 🥹🦈🌊).\n\ni see the vision and how the shark plot was a larger metaphor about losing someone you love and not being able to do anything about it, but the author maybe tried to do a biiiit too much in this one. after reflecting more, i wanted the story to be ALL about Wren and Lewis. the second plot never quite tied together well to the first for my liking. neither did a major detail at the end and the last scene… 🙄 what a low hanging fruit!! *keeping spoiler free…\n\nTLDR; this book is super weird but makes you think. for that, it would make a good book club pick! there’s much to discuss 🦈💔🦅🤯\n\nApril 1, 2024\n\nthe setup…\n\nLewis and Wren Woodard are newly married, both realizing they truly are each other’s soulmates. But shortly after their wedding, Lewis gets a devastating diagnosis…his physical body is transforming into a great white shark. While these kinds of transformations aren’t unheard of, his particular type is rare. He will still have his memories and mental skills, but in all other respects he will become a shark, complete with its inherent nature.\n\nthe heart of the story…\n\nThis story feels special from the opening passages and I was completely unprepared for what follows. It’s an imaginary world where humans can transform into animals but all else is steeped in the realities of the human condition. Wren’s reluctance to let go as Lewis’s transformation progresses had me mindful of the same kind of mindset one has when a loved one is facing a terminal illness. Lewis teaches theater and began his career as a struggling actor before leaving New York and returning to Texas. Wren is a financial expert who is typically the stalwart in the relationship, Lewis the dreamer. You see their natures shifting as time starts to run out, their love for each other never wavering. The writing is beautiful, a lyrical fusion of prose, poetry and script, that completely masters the emotional trials and experiences. My heart alternately ached and soared with elation at times.\n\nthe narration…\n\nI loved how the narrators handled the characters and the storytelling as it required every skill they had to do justice to the writing. They were perfection.\n\nthe bottom line…\n\nI don't have the eloquence to share the beauty of this story. Immediately upon finishing, I changed the category from contemporary to literary fiction as it gave me so much to contemplate, to reconsider to question…that’s what great writing will evoke. There’s an interesting story here, of course, but not the jaw dropping or mesmerizing drama…just ordinary people facing extraordinary issues in an everyday setting. I guarantee you will love Wren and Lewis, become transfixed in their journey and not be all consumed by his transformation itself but how it impacts them and those around them.\n\nPosted on Blue Mood Café\n\n(Thanks to Simon & Schuster Audio for my complimentary copy. All opinions are my own.)\n\nFebruary 3, 2024\n\n4.0 Stars\n\nThis is a slow burning weird surrealist piece of fiction. The premise requires an obvious suspension of belief but once I went along with the story, I found myself hooked. Based on my personal tastes, I wish this story had leaned into horror but I can really criticize the book for not being something I wanted it to be. I would recommend this one to readers who enjoy lovely weird stories with beautiful prose.\n\nSeptember 1, 2023\n\nWhen I first heard the premise for Shark Heart — Newlyweds Wren and Lewis find out Lewis has a rare mutation and is gradually becoming a great white shark, meaning their time together is limited — my initial thought was, admittedly, this one is not for me. The overwhelming number of positive reviews for the book began to intrigue me though and I’m glad I gave it a shot.\n\nThe chapters are very short and detail how Lewis and Wren met, how they’re dealing (or not dealing) with his diagnosis now, and how Wren’s childhood shaped who she is as an adult today. Wren’s mother Angela’s story is also included too.\n\nI enjoyed the uniqueness of Shark Heart and though there are themes of love, I found this to be less of a love story and more of a consideration on what makes a life meaningful.\n\nMarch 22, 2024\n\nIt’s okayish. No. It was full blown BORING. Pick it up if you like what the blurb says. Even then DNF it if you find it boring after the first few chapters.\n\nAugust 8, 2023\n\nNow available.\n\nLet me preface my review by saying that this is a book that most of my friends LOVED. So, I am definitely an outlier with my three of five stars rating.\n\nWhy are there such sharp delineations among ratings on this novel? I think it's the writing style. Perhaps Kirkus Reviews says it best:\n\n𝘏𝘢𝘣𝘦𝘤𝘬’𝘴 𝘩𝘦𝘢𝘳𝘵-𝘰𝘯-𝘴𝘭𝘦𝘦𝘷𝘦 𝘢𝘱𝘱𝘳𝘰𝘢𝘤𝘩 𝘵𝘰 𝘳𝘦𝘭𝘢𝘵𝘪𝘰𝘯𝘴𝘩𝘪𝘱𝘴, 𝘨𝘳𝘪𝘦𝘧, 𝘢𝘯𝘥 𝘯𝘢𝘵𝘶𝘳𝘢𝘭 𝘸𝘰𝘯𝘥𝘦𝘳 𝘮𝘢𝘺 𝘴𝘵𝘳𝘪𝘬𝘦 𝘴𝘰𝘮𝘦 𝘢𝘴 𝘴𝘢𝘤𝘤𝘩𝘢𝘳𝘪𝘯𝘦, 𝘣𝘶𝘵 𝘳𝘦𝘢𝘥𝘦𝘳𝘴 𝘭𝘰𝘰𝘬𝘪𝘯𝘨 𝘧𝘰𝘳 𝘢𝘯 𝘦𝘢𝘳𝘯𝘦𝘴𝘵 𝘦𝘹𝘱𝘭𝘰𝘳𝘢𝘵𝘪𝘰𝘯 𝘰𝘧 𝘭𝘰𝘷𝘦 𝘸𝘪𝘭𝘭 𝘣𝘦 𝘴𝘢𝘵𝘪𝘴𝘧𝘪𝘦𝘥. 𝘛𝘩𝘰𝘶𝘨𝘩 𝘰𝘤𝘤𝘢𝘴𝘪𝘰𝘯𝘢𝘭𝘭𝘺 𝘧𝘭𝘰𝘳𝘪𝘥, 𝘢 𝘥𝘦𝘣𝘶𝘵 𝘵𝘩𝘢𝘵 𝘴𝘵𝘢𝘯𝘥𝘴 𝘰𝘶𝘵 𝘧𝘳𝘰𝘮 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘱𝘢𝘤𝘬—𝘦𝘳, 𝘴𝘤𝘩𝘰𝘰𝘭.\n\nI think that's a fair assessment. I should also mention that the chapters, as such, are unusually short, many less than a page, and some only a sentence. It can feel a little choppy. There is a possibility that this is to reflect the nonlinear process of dealing with loss, but I'm not sure. The structure is definitely experimental, combining elements of traditional narrative with poetry and even play writing.\n\nTo explain the style: it's a bit sentimental, even cloying. It either appeals to you or it doesn't. There's not much in-between. After the novel prints, I will give a couple of examples here:\n\n𝘏𝘦 𝘸𝘢𝘴 𝘢𝘯 𝘢𝘪𝘮𝘭𝘦𝘴𝘴 𝘬𝘪𝘵𝘦 𝘪𝘯 𝘴𝘦𝘢𝘳𝘤𝘩 𝘰𝘧 𝘢 𝘴𝘵𝘳𝘪𝘯𝘨 𝘵𝘰 𝘨𝘳𝘰𝘶𝘯𝘥 𝘩𝘪𝘮 𝘵𝘰 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘸𝘰𝘳𝘭𝘥, 𝘣𝘶𝘵 𝘪𝘯𝘴𝘵𝘦𝘢𝘥 𝘩𝘦 𝘧𝘰𝘶𝘯𝘥 𝘞𝘳𝘦𝘯, 𝘢 𝘨𝘳𝘦𝘢𝘵, 𝘴𝘵𝘳𝘰𝘯𝘨 𝘸𝘪𝘯𝘥 𝘸𝘩𝘰 𝘴𝘶𝘱𝘱𝘰𝘳𝘵𝘦𝘥 𝘩𝘪𝘴 𝘦𝘹𝘱𝘭𝘰𝘳𝘢𝘵𝘪𝘰𝘯 𝘰𝘧 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘴𝘬𝘺.\n\n𝘛𝘩𝘦 𝘤𝘰𝘮𝘣𝘪𝘯𝘢𝘵𝘪𝘰𝘯 𝘰𝘧 𝘸𝘰𝘳𝘥𝘴 𝘣𝘦𝘭𝘰𝘯𝘨𝘦𝘥 𝘵𝘰 𝘢 𝘤𝘩𝘢𝘳𝘢𝘤𝘵𝘦𝘳 𝘩𝘦 𝘸𝘰𝘶𝘭𝘥 𝘯𝘦𝘷𝘦𝘳 𝘱𝘭𝘢𝘺, 𝘣𝘶𝘵 𝘪𝘯 𝘵𝘩𝘢𝘵 𝘮𝘰𝘮𝘦𝘯𝘵, 𝘩𝘦 𝘧𝘦𝘭𝘵 𝘵𝘩𝘢𝘵 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘭𝘪𝘯𝘦 𝘩𝘢𝘥 𝘣𝘦𝘦𝘯 𝘸𝘳𝘪𝘵𝘵𝘦𝘯 𝘧𝘰𝘳 𝘩𝘪𝘮.\n\nHabeck interrogates questions about what makes us human. In particular, the author delves into how much the essence and character of being human might change through physical and emotional transmogrification. Is the state of being human a matter of degree, or is it a zero sum definition? How do our relationships with each other and with the natural world affect who we are?\n\nThe story begins with the tender courtship and joining together of Wren and Lewis. Shortly after they marry, Lewis receives a terrifying diagnosis, one which will forever change him, and which threatens to break the couple's bond.\n\nIt is not lost on the reader that the time span for Lewis' dramatic change is nine months, an obvious reference to pregnancy and birth. Lewis is becoming something new, birthing a new self, and perhaps an entirely new identity. How much of his \"humanness\" will he retain? The author seeks answers to how we are able to adapt to incredible changes, and how we can both retain our identity and still build a meaningful life.\n\nThe whole experience is not only devastating for Wren, but also forces her to confront events from her own early life which have irrevocably changed her. Immediately, we are reminded of the randomness of life events juxtaposed with destiny and fate. Which exerts more force upon us? And can we ever completely escape?\n\nBesides the philosophical focus of the book, there is also a stream of spirituality which runs through the whole narrative. It is clear that Wren and Lewis see themselves as something greater as a couple, than they are as individuals. Each makes the other wiser, more aware, more in tune with the natural world, even more expressively poetic. They deeply believe that they were meant to be together, that nothing could have stopped their union.\n\nWhether or not the reader sees themselves in either character, we certainly recognize the types of personalities they portray, especially Wren. We've all known that woman who is incredibly organized, always on time, tidy and neat, who has unimpeachable integrity and is scrupulous about fairness.\n\nWhen Lewis receives his puzzling and devastating diagnosis, he reacts as many people do: thinking that not admitting it will make it less real, less scary. No amount of avoidance or positive attitude can change the diagnosis. And like anyone with a life changing condition, Lewis is determined to wrestle some control from the process. He is an actor. Of course he wants to be the director.\n\nWren has so many skills, yet not one of her safe and well-thought-out strategies will help in this situation. Lewis had always expanded his life with lofty dreams. Wren had always insulated herself by exercising extreme caution, and by consciously avoiding risks. Wren wants to believe that if she tries to be perfect, nothing bad will happen to her.\n\nHow does the couple cope? They both find solace in the beauty and magnetic pull of the natural world.\n\nI was a little disappointed that the narrator seemed to be telling Lewis and Wren's entire story: how the characters felt, what they were thinking and why, etc. I longed for the characters to express how they felt with their own actions. Also, all the bouncing around: time periods, memories, brief side characters, felt like a lack of cohesiveness.\n\nWhen the novel turned to Angela's story, the writing style changed. Angela's backstory was more linear, straightforward, and surprisingly tender. The characters of Theresa, Julia, and George, were particularly heartwarming. I had a much greater attachment to them than anyone in the first half of the novel.\n\nI kept waiting for the story to veer into truly dangerous territory. To paraphrase Chekov, if you introduce razor-sharp teeth, you have to use them. There is a a scene where this happens halfway, but mostly the narrative keeps far from the edges.\n\nThe message of the novel seems to be that connection is the way to heal from grief, that life is about risk, but worth it, in the end. The woman who thought she could protect herself by not taking the risk to love, learns that she really can't live without love.\n\nThere are some excellent ideas here, but the execution of them is not only unusual and a bit jumpy, but also a little too cautious, which is ironic, considering the overall message.\n\nThank you to NetGalley and MARYSUE RICCI BOOKS, an imprint of Simon & Schuster, for providing a digital galley of this novel for review.\n\nFebruary 3, 2024\n\nRating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ ½\n\nGenre: Literary Fiction + Magical Realism\n\nShark Heart is the debut novel by Emily Habick. It is a love story with lots of magical realism. The story is about the newlyweds, Wren and Lewis, and how their lives shatter a couple of weeks after their wedding. Lewis gets diagnosed with a rare disease where he will gradually transform into a shark! Along with the transformation, his memory will fade too, causing major pain in their relationship.\n\nDespite the nonlinear timeline, which is usually not my thing, I found myself totally immersed in this story. Whether it was the couple’s harsh present or Wren’s complex past with her mother, Angela, both timelines were given their full due.\n\nThe writing is poetic and beautiful. The prose will make you more engaged and invested in the story of these characters, rooting for them and feeling all their pain and hardships. The emotions of the characters are vividly described, engrossing the reader in their quest. I think the author has done such an amazing job with the writing as well as the themes she utilized in her story.\n\nThe secret to liking this book is to stick with it and hang on. I am aware that the constant shift in time format can be off-putting to a lot of readers, including myself; however, if you do not give up on it, I believe that it will not be as confusing as it seems to be at the beginning.\n\nDue to its format, Shark Heart might not be the cup of tea of every reader, but it is a story I feel that most readers will be able to connect with. The book explores themes that are important in the life of every human being, like love, loss, grief, change, or transformation. Honestly, I didn’t expect to love it that much. Even if you feel that the format or theme is outside of your comfort zone, you should still give it a shot.\n\nDecember 10, 2023\n\nReading Vlog\n\nIf SyFy made a Hallmark movie using the lighting equipment from a Netflix Original, it would be this book......\n\nI couldn't get into it. Not the world and not the characters. In fact, I actually really disliked the characters which is a deal breaker given this is a character-centered novel. We didn't get enough of them being happy together for me to be devastated when anything came between them. They felt like strangers to me. Especially because of how many secrets they keep from each other. That really frustrated me.\n\nAlso, it really grossed me out. I thought this kind of literary horror was going to be for me but something about the body horror really made my skin crawl.\n\nI wouldn't dissuade anyone from reading this. It's clearly a huge success with many people. I wish I'd been one of them but alas...\n\n🖤 YouTube 🩶 Patreon 🤍 Instagram 💜\n\nDecember 15, 2023\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/Cw7tuqILA...\n\nA devastating ode to love and grief. Shark Heart is a powerhouse of emotion, evoking both joy and heartbreak, anger and nostalgia. It asks: what should we be doing with the time we have on this earth? What gives our lives meaning? How do we rebuild ourselves after an irreparable loss? What does joy look like after heartbreak, and how do we make a record of ourselves that lasts after we are gone? Gorgeously crafted and pulsing with magic and the fragile strength of memory, this novel is one that impacts a lasting impression on readers; we can all relate to having a love, platonic, familial, or romantic, that has shaped our world for better and for worse, one that has sent ripples across our futures and our own legacies.\n\nAugust 8, 2024\n\n3.5 ⭐️ rounded up for Goodreads!\n\nThis tale 😉 is hopeful, heartbreakingly real, and bizarre. I enjoyed how out of the box this concept was. Basically, if you’re feeling bored of the normal romance literary fiction books, this is a fresh and unique spin!\n\nAugust 14, 2023\n\nI knew going into this that it'd be a story requiring readers to do a considerable amount of suspending their disbelief, but it's not the premise of this guy transforming into a great white shark that's getting me. This book wants to be Unique; however, it comes across as trying too hard to be so.\n\nThis book seems to be a story for those people who ask their partners, \"Would you still love me if I was a worm?\" and then expect to get a serious answer in response.\n\nSeptember 9, 2023\n\n”Would you like to be a family?” “Family. I thought it would never happen to me.”\n\nThis book was funky! I will definitely be on the lookout for the author’s next release. Wren’s husband is turning into a great white shark. 🦈 What if she can learn to scuba dive, so that she can stay with him forever? 🥺 You will get a lot of weird looks when describing the book you are reading to others, but honestly, it was so emotional and raw! At times I was confused why certain characters were being introduced, but as I kept reading the author revealed how their stories added to the overall plot. If you’re not sure at first, stick with it. This book was so well done. Loved loved loved it!"
