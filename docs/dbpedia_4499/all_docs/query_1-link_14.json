        "text": "WHAT AWESOME EXPERIENCE !!!\n\ni thought i would never see underworld.... Well its beautiful :) :) :) We didn't see the White sharks, HOWEVER we saw sharks 6-7 of them myself & my team enjoyed this trip out into nature, Even took us to SEAL Island 1000's of them.\n\nArriving at the Office we were meet By crazy uncle PAUL tooo cute. he just made us feel Welcome & at Home made us feel like we CRAZY what IF the sharks eats us.\n\nThank YOU White Shark Cage Diving.\n\nMy husband and I signed up for this as part of our travel package and we could not have been happier with the experience. The staff was incredibly friendly! We had a light breakfast before heading out and when we returned we had a nice warm soup waiting for us which was perfect after that cold water. We were given an overview of the organization and their goals before we went out onto the boat. It was great to see such passion about such an interesting species. When we were out on the boat we were split into three groups, we put on our wet suits and goggles (that they provided), and then we were instructed to get into the cage. It took a while but eventually the sharks came and it was incredible! Their fins entered the cages, we could see them staring at us as they passed by. None of them seemed aggressive, none tried to bite the cage, and I was completely at ease! During our time out there a little seal came to join the party and popped up around the boat. It was fantastic! The water is INCREDIBLY cold so brace yourself for that but overall my husband and I had a great time!!\n\nA once in a lifetime experience that exceeded all expectations!\n\nAll crew and staff are very friendly and happy to accommodate for any needs or questions. The on-board marine biologist provides insightful information before and during the trip providing interesting info on the animals that are in the local area.\n\nAs a personal bucket list experience he trip exceeded all expectations with plenty of time in the water to view the sharks and exciting encounters with the amazing animals.\n\nAs an extra my personal underwater camera was left at home, marine dynamics rented a camera for my trip and allowed me to take home the Sand disk. I was pleasantly surprised to see the videos downloaded onto my laptop in HD with amazing footage.\n\nAll round 10/10 experience which went above and beyond all expectations. Would HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!\n\nI went Shark cage diving in Gansbai . It was one of the coolest things ive ever done in nature . The water is cold , you will need to use a wet suit . The tour operator was great , they provided lunch , knowledgeable guide and of course SHARKS . it took us about 25 minutes to locate some sharks .. but once we found 1 the others started to arrive too . I will never forget this experience . if you are on holidays here but not fully sure if you want to shark dive , trust me , YOU WILL REGRET NOT DOING IT ... this is a must do .. so cool\n\nWe booked directly with Marine Dynamics and we had a good day. We had a transfer from our hotel in Cape Town which took about 2 hours. Once we arrived we had some food and a briefing. Then we all changed into our wet suits and received our life jackets and waterproof coat. We then walked down to the boat. The boat was a good size. The sea was pretty rough, so I would strongly advise taking sea sickness pills. After about 30 minutes we arrived at the site. The crew then fixed the cage to the side of the boat and they started putting bait in the water. We soon saw a Copper Shark and about 6/8 of us were lowered into the cage. You then wait for the sharks to appear and then duck under water to view them. The water was quite murky so it was difficult to see the sharks under the water, you actually had a better view above the water. We saw a Great White and Copper Sharks it was a good experience. They then rotate people through the cage, you get around 30 minutes and they did let you go in a second time. They also provided food and hot drinks on board. My only comment would be that you literally duck under the water, which surprised us. You then go back to the office get changed and they provide you with soup. They then show the video of the day and you can buy it."
