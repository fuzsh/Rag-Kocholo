        "text": "This popular route was constructed at George Washington's recommendation. The president dreamt of waterways to connect the Eastern seaboard with the Great Lakes and the Ohio River, and though you won’t see anyone transporting hogs, salt or whiskey on the C&O Canal Towpath these days, you are likely to see joggers taking advantage of the soft dirt surface and shady path. The track starts at the Canal Visitors Center in Georgetown and stretches 184.5 miles, passing through beloved natural attraction Great Falls Park 14 miles to the north.\n\nBetween the Lincoln Memorial and the Potomac River lies a set of grand steps that seemingly lead to nowhere. The Watergate Steps were originally built to provide an impressive entrance for visiting dignitaries arriving in DC by boat. While that didn't take hold, the steps did provide the basis for the name of an infamous office block nearby, and a way for runners to build their stamina and endurance.\n\nDC has the oldest and largest urban park in the national park system, so it’s not surprising that there are plenty of options for raising your heart rate in Rock Creek Park. Established as the third national park in the U.S. by Congress in 1890, Rock Creek Park allows residents to step out of the city and into nature in mere minutes. Runners can stick to the paved paths, head off-road on the extensive trail network or take advantage of a car-free Beach Drive when sections are closed to traffic on weekends. Access the grounds anytime of year.\n\nHains Point is part of East Potomac Park, a man-made island surrounded by the Tidal Basin, Potomac River and Washington Channel. The green space attracts recreation seekers of all kinds with tennis courts, a golf course, plenty of parkland for social sports and a shoreline for fishing. A loop of roughly three miles takes runners to Hains Point at the tip of the peninsula and back.\n\nThe southeast pocket of DC has undergone significant development in recent years, including a continuous 20-mile Anacostia Riverwalk Trail that runs along both sides of the river. Plan your route to include a cool down in the canal basin wading pool and riverside gardens in Yards Park on the Capitol Riverfront.\n\nWhile there's a wide range of things to see and do in DC’s oldest neighborhood, runners will want to skip the cobblestone streets and high-end boutiques and opt for scenic running trails and paths along the Potomac River. The Capital Crescent Trail, which is accessible from the waterfront, extends all the way into Bethesda, Md. One of the most trafficked trails in the nation, the Crescent stretches 11 miles and serves as a major commuter route.\n\nWhat a run along Embassy Row loses in street crossings, it makes up for by passing some of the grandest, most historic homes in DC. The stretch of Massachusetts Avenue NW between Dupont Circle and the National Cathedral (on Wisconsin Avenue NW) takes runners past countless embassies, over Rock Creek Park and by the U.S. Naval Observatory – home to the vice president. \"The Row\" also provides a steady elevation gain for those who want to test their mettle uphill.\n\nThe Mount Vernon Trail follows the scenic Potomac River between two iconic destinations: Theodore Roosevelt Island and George Washington’s Mount Vernon. The mostly-flat 18-mile path has plenty of diverse landscapes to keep runners occupied, passing through wetlands, wooded areas, parks, yacht clubs and historic neighborhoods. Other pit stops of note include the Arlington Memorial Bridge, Arlington National Cemetery, Old Town Alexandria and local favorite Gravelly Point, where you can watch take off and land overhead.\n\nKnown as “MBT” to locals, this trail is known for eye-catching murals that run parallel to you as you go, especially in NoMa. Along your route toward Union Station, you'll also pass landmarks like The Dew Drop Inn, a historic building which once served as a workspace for stonemasons and metal workers. Now, it's a popular dive bar that serves up Orange crushes and burgers. In the summertime, you'll see folks following a slightly different route along the Metropolitan Beer Trail.\n\nThis hidden gem of a trail is just under a mile in length, but makes for a scenic ride or walk at any time of year. The Klingle Valley Trail was completed in 2017 and serves little oasis in the Upper Northwest for nature lovers all over the District. Some notable features of the trail include its permeable pavement, which prevents stormwater runoff, its connection to the spectacular Tregaron Conservancy paths and trail network and its gorgeous view of the Connecticut Avenue NW bridge. From here, trail users can connect to the city's Rock Creek Park trail system to extend their journey.\n\nDC offers plenty of natural areas that will make you feel like you’ve left the city altogether. One such oasis is Glover Archbold Park, a stretch of forest running from Tenley Circle to the Potomac River in Georgetown. The pedestrian-only park is a favorite for trail runners who enjoy the abundant shade and encounters with wildlife such as deer and migratory birds.\n\nTurn your run into a training session and compete in one of these organized races and marathons in Washington, DC."
