        "text": "About this book\n\nThe definitive, world-wide guide on when and where to watch Great White Sharks and how to interpret their behaviour. It includes a comprehensive illustrated catalogue of Great White Shark surface and social behaviours, a new theory about the function of the Great White Shark's distinctive pigmentation pattern, guidelines for watching Great White Sharks from shore, boat, or while diving, and the world's best Great White watching sites, including when to go, what conditions to expect, and how to get there. Also contains an interactive CD-ROM, featuring specially created computer animations, film clips of spectacular Great White behaviour, and web-links to selected on-line resources.\n\n`Packed with information, photos, and drawings of the great white, this book will be an invaluable aid to those who want to learn more about our favourite shark, and to those who feel a particularly strong attachment to Carcharodon carcharias, the most charismatic of all sharks - indeed, the most fascinating of all the ocean's great predators.'
