        "text": "Alliteration Definition\n\nAlliteration is a literary device where each word in a string of words starts with the same consonant (as opposed to assonance, in which a vowel sound is repeated). One use of alliteration is to place emphasis on the words which all start with the same sound. Another practice is to use consonants to create an image. For example, if a string of words all begin with the sound /sh/, then it could create a sound like waves, typically a very soothing sound. A string of words that all start with /s/ could create a sound like a snake talking, implying slyness or trickery.\n\nExamples of Alliteration\n\nPeter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers.\n\nAlone along a lonesome lake, Lucy longed for the love of her life.\n\nThe sudden stench of the soggy swamp assailed our noses.\n\nThe crisp crackle of the fire calmed our hearts and cleansed our souls.\n\nHow to Use the Alliteration Dictionary"
