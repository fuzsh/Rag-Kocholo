About this website

Whether you’re planning a short stroll or multi-day hike you’ll find lots of information on this website. Most of the information is organised by trail and you can access it by clicking ‘The Trails’ dropdown menu at the top of the page and clicking on the trail you’re interested in.

Each trail has its own interactive map where you can view the route and use the map filters to display accommodation, things to do, services such as food and drink, transport, water points and more. The map also shows short walks, details of any diversions and where available, information for cyclists and horse riders. You can find the map on each trail’s ‘Information & Map’ page. Click on the map’s filters to display the different categories of information.
