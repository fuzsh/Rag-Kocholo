        "text": "B3000 Fiction Workshop\n\nProf. Dalia Sofer\n\nMondays 4:45 – 6:35pm\n\nSection 1FG (20772)\n\nIn this course we will read and discuss your manuscripts—short stories or excerpts from longer works. Together we’ll explore the elements of craft, including point of view, character, setting, style, and language. We’ll talk about the possibilities of fiction—how, for example, conflict (internal and external) can create narrative tension, how subtext can reveal the complexity of a situation, how time can be collapsed or expanded, or how well-chosen details can evoke character. We will also consider structure and form, as well as editing and revision. Ideally, you’ll each submit two pieces for discussion throughout the course. In each class, we’ll discuss two students’ works, and fellow students will provide written notes and critiques; I will do the same.\n\nMy primary goal in this course is to focus on your intention, and on whether your manuscript manifests that intention. I’m less interested in the “formulas” of storytelling than in discovering what is unique to your vision. We’ll explore ways to sustain narrative tension while allowing a work of fiction the freedom to be what it wants to be, and we’ll talk about roadblocks and successes. Occasionally, time permitting, we may also take detours to read stories or essays that may fuel our conversations.\n\nDalia Sofer is the author of the novels Man of My Time (Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 2020)—a New York Times Editors’ Choice and Notable Book of 2020, and The Septembers of Shiraz (Ecco Press, 2007)—also selected as a New York Times Notable Book of the Year, winner of the Sami Rohr Choice Award, a finalist for the Jewish Book Award, and longlisted for several prizes. A recipient of a Whiting Award, the PEN/Robert W. Bingham Prize, the Sirenland Fellowship, the Santa Maddalena Foundation Fellowship, and multiple residencies at Yaddo, Sofer has contributed essays and reviews to various publications, including The New York Times Book Review, The LA Review of Books, The Markaz Review, and The Believer.\n\nB3000 Fiction Workshop\n\nProf. Soraya Palmer\n\nTuesdays 4:45 – 6:35pm\n\nSection 2RS (36954)\n\nThis course will help you to tap into the unexpected and embrace the elements of surprise in your writing. I will be encouraging you to embrace the childhood parts of your imagination that can get you out of your comfort zone in your writing and allow yourself to experiment, fail, and try again. Some weeks will include prompts that all students will be expected to partake in at home or (time permitting) in class. These assignments are aimed at examining the craft techniques we are familiar with from an unfamiliar lens. For instance, how might animating an ordinary object force you to use setting (e.g.: a haunted house, a talking mirror) as a central character in your story? How do you use the macabre to build tension and create a sense of dread for your characters and/or your readers? We will read short works by authors who embrace the unfamiliar such as Carmen Maria Machado, George Saunders, Lesley Nneka Arimah, and Maisy Card to examine how authors use elements of surrealism, magical realism, unexpected turns, and strangeness to tell stories. Each student will have the opportunity to be workshopped one piece of their choice and one prompt-based piece. You may submit short stories or excerpts of longer works. Students will be expected to actively participate both verbally and in writing for their peers during the workshop.\n\nAll genres are welcome.\n\nSoraya Palmer is the author of The Human Origins of Beatrice Porter and Other Essential Ghosts. She is a Flatbush-born-and-raised writer and licensed social worker who has worked to advocate for survivors of gender-based violence who are facing criminal charges related to their abuse. She has also spent time as a community organizer for young people who fights against gentrification and police brutality. Her novel was named one of Today’s “38 Best New Books to Read in 2023,” one of the “Buzziest Debut Novels of the New Year” by Goodreads, one of the “Best and Most Anticipated Books of 2023” by Elle magazine, and one of “The Most Anticipated Feminist Books of 2023” by Ms. Magazine. Her writing has appeared in Electric Literature, Hazlitt, Ploughshares, and elsewhere. She has been awarded a residency at Blue Mountain Center and graduated from the Virginia Tech MFA program. She lives in Brooklyn with her cat, Nicholas.\n\nB3000 Fiction Workshop\n\nProf. Salar Abdoh\n\nTuesdays 6:45 – 8:35pm\n\nSection 2TU (20991)\n\nThis course is a standard graduate workshop. Each student shares their work two times during the semester. Submissions can be segments of a novel or a short story. My focus in the workshop is entirely on the students’ own pieces. My style is not to do paragraph by paragraph edits of a work. Rather, I look at the overall arc of a piece, and address the fundamental elements of fiction within it – pacing, character, voice, dialogue, prose, transitions, et cetera. Another aspect of my style of workshop is to not be overly intrusive. In other words, I try to work within the context that the writer has created; I don’t believe in ‘hard intrusion’ into a writer’s intent, style and execution, unless on very rare occasions it is absolutely called for.\n\nSalar Abdoh is a novelist, essayist and translator. His latest book, A Nearby Country Called Love, was published in 2023.\n\nB3200 Poetry Workshop\n\nProf. David Groff\n\nWednesdays 4:45 – 6:35pm\n\nSection 3FG (32603)\n\nJust as each of us humans has a distinctive voiceprint, so does every poet. In this workshop you’ll be encouraged to define and refine your particular poetic voice. We’ll use the reading aloud of our poems to make observations and insights about them that lead us into the adventure of revision. In class exercises and discussion, we’ll explore ways to liberate the imagination and take poems to the often-startling places they need to go, while writing in both received and organic poetic forms. We will also read poets of diverse nationalities, races, eras, genders, and aesthetics, to discover how we can better value their voices and find inspiration for our own poems.\n\nIn addition to writing and revising poems, we will explore where and how to send them out for publication, as part of a larger discussion about the voice of the emerging writer in a complex and rapidly changing American literary culture. Please be ready to submit a poem a week, do assigned reading of work by poets past and present, provide generous written responses to poems by other workshop participants, perform in-class and take-home poetry prompts, present the workshop with a written introduction to a poet you love, and create an end-of-semester chapbook of your poetry.\n\nDavid Groff received his MFA from the University of Iowa Writers Workshop. He also has an MA in English and Expository Writing from the University of Iowa. His books of poetry are Live in Suspense (Trio House Press, 2023), Clay (Trio House Press, 2013), and Theory of Devolution (University of Illinois Press, 2002). He has co-edited the anthologies Who’s Yer Daddy?: Gay Writers Celebrate Their Mentors and Forerunners (University of Wisconsin Press, 2013), and Persistent Voices: Poetry by Writers Lost to AIDS (Alyson, 2010).\n\nB3600 Non-Fiction Workshop\n\nProf. Irvin Weathersby, Jr.\n\nMondays 6:45 – 8:35pm\n\nSection 1HJ (32607)\n\nONLINE\n\nDuring the fall semester, students will submit two manuscripts up to twenty-five pages each, and learn to critique the work of their peers. Students will also explore exemplars of creative nonfiction and discuss the publication process from writing query letters, soliciting representation, and working with publishers. This class will nurture writers looking to expand their understanding of creative non-fiction as it relates to other forms including memoir, narrative non-fiction, feature writing, journalism, the personal essay and others, including fiction and poetic forms. Each of us has a story to tell, and this workshop will give students the tools to determine how their stories will be told.\n\nIrvin Weathersby is the author of In Open Contempt, a memoir-in-essays forthcoming in January 2025 that mediates on expressions of racism in art, museums, and public space in New Orleans and throughout the world. He has written for Guernica, Esquire, The Atlantic, EBONY, and other outlets. He is a 2022 Mellon/ACLS Community College Faculty Fellow. His work has also received funding and support from the Voices of our Nation Arts Foundation, the Professional Staff Congress-City University of New York Research Award, and the Bread Loaf Writers’ Conference where he was named the 2019 Bernard O’Keefe Scholar in Nonfiction. He has earned an MFA in creative writing from The New School, and a master’s in education from Morgan State University. He teaches composition and creative writing at Queensborough Community College and in the MFA program at St. Joseph’s University.\n\nB4501 Special Topics:\n\nScreenwriting Workshop\n\nProf. Marc Palmieri\n\nMondays 4:45 – 6:35pm\n\nSection 1FG (32606)\n\nThe good news is, these days one can move a script from page to screen faster and cheaper than ever before. While the possibility of selling a script to Hollywood is always real (seriously- it does happen), it is exciting and motivating to consider that thanks to how far digital technology has come, seeing one’s own work on the independent film circuit, festivals and the internet can happen without someone giving you lots and lots of money. Students will develop a screenplay for a film, television or the web. All are welcome to work in other variations such as television scripts and web series scripts. We will examine the storytelling possibilities of the form, its advantages and challenges – and no doubt stumble on important things we didn’t expect. Students will also offer critiques and participate in feedback discussions of classmates’ work.\n\nMarc Palmieri has taught dramatic writing in the MFA program at CCNY since 2010, and has taught Modern and Postmodern Drama, Shakespeare, Dramatic Writing for the stage, TV and film, Fiction and other courses for the Undergraduate English Department since 2006. He is an assistant professor in the School of Liberal Arts at Mercy College. Credits include: Miramax Films’ Telling You (screenplay), The Thing (webseries), stage plays include Waiting For The Host, Levittown (NY Times Critic’s Pick), The Groundling, Carl The Second and Poor Fellas (all published by Dramatists Play Service). He has published twice in Fiction, as well as the Global City Review and (Re) An Ideas Journal, and in numerous anthologies for Applause/Limelight Books and Smith & Kraus Inc. His collection of plays for middle schoolers, S(cool) Days, is published by Brooklyn Publishers. His memoir, She Danced With Lightning is published by Post Hill Press (August, 2022). Marc is a fully vested member of SAGAFTRA and Actors Equity.BA Wake Forest, MA, MFA CCNY.\n\nwww.marcpalmieri.com\n\nThis course is also available as Craft Seminar.\n\nB1616 Bible, Myth and Contemporary Literature\n\nProf. Mark J. Mirsky\n\nThursdays 6:45 – 8:35pm\n\nSection 4TU (22220)\n\nThis course is designed to introduce graduate Creative Writing students, and students in the Literature M.A., to the way questions of good and evil, belief or non-belief in an afterlife, and the idea of the hero or heroine, are expressed both in contemporary fiction and major texts of the past. We will read chapters from major texts of Antiquity as well as from writers in the Twentieth Century. The course starts with the Babylonian Epic of Gilgamesh, chapters of Homer’s Odyssey, then alternates with stories of the Polish writer, Bruno Schulz, readings from The Book of Genesis, The Book of Job, Franz Kafka’s The Trial, and Max Frisch’s Homo Faber. Among the contemporary writers whose books are included are William Faulkner, Milan Kundera, Cynthia Ozick, James Baldwin, Bruno Schulz, Isak Dinesen, Jorge Luis Borges, and Donald Barthelme and Joyce Carol Oates. The latter will be a guest speaker during the semester.\n\nThe instructor requires the submission of two questions about the reading assigned for that week. At the end of the course students must submit either a creative response or critical paper on one or two of the books from the syllabus. This final paper should number between nine and ten pages or 2,500 words.\n\nIn addition to the books and stories that students are required to read, the instructor will provide further reading as background to the class discussion and speak about them. These will include pages from Hesiod’s Theogony, chapters from The Book of Samuel 2, (the story of King David and Absalom), The Gospel of Matthew, work by Flannery O’Connor, Marcel Proust, Miguel de Unamuno and Robert Musil in pdf or e-pub versions. These readings, however are optional.\n\nTentative Reading List:\n\nThe Epic of Gilgamesh, 2nd Norton Crit. Ed.\n\nThe Odyssey, Richard Lattimore translation\n\nGenesis: King James Bible\n\nThe Unbearable Lightness of Being, Milan Kundera (PDF)\n\nThe Book of Job, Edward Greenstein trans. digital or hardback\n\nThe Trial, Franz Kafka, Breon Mitchell trans.\n\n“Sorrow Acre” Isak Dinesen (PDF)\n\nHomo Faber, Max Frisch\n\nAbsalom, Absalom, William Faulkner\n\nGo Tell It on the Mountain, James Baldwin\n\nBeautiful Days, Joyce Carol Oates.\n\nCollected Fictions, Jorge Luis Borges, trans. by Andrew Hurley\n\nSixty Stories of Donald Barthelme.\n\nProfessor Mark Jay Mirsky was the founding editor of the magazine Fiction in 1972, together with Donald Barthelme, and Max and Marianne Frisch. It still publishes from offices at The City College. Professor Mirsky is the author of five novels, Thou Worm Jacob, Proceedings of the Rabble, The Red Adam, Puddingstone, and Blue Hill Avenue (the last, listed among the 100 Essential Books of New England—by The Boston Globe.) He has published a collection of novellas, The Secret Table, as well as five books of criticism and journalism, My Search for the Messiah, The Absent Shakespeare, The Drama in Shakespeare’s Sonnets—”A Satire to Decay,” Dante, Eros and Kabbalah, and A Mother’s Steps in addition to numerous stories and articles.

His essays and reviews have appeared in Partisan Review, The Massachusetts Review, The Washington Post, Book World, The Boston Globe, and elsewhere.\n\nThis course is also available as Craft Seminar.\n\nB1954 Race and Sexuality in the Narratives of James Baldwin\n\nProf. Gordon Thompson\n\nWednesdays 6:45 – 8:35pm\n\nSection 3HJ (20584)\n\nWe will take a narrative or narratological approach to Baldwin’s various works. The class will explore how in his works seemingly private narrative tropes connect with larger or universal themes. This approach, in other words, is expected to reveal how patterns in the lives of the general reader of any demographic may connect with issues raised in Baldwin’s works even if, at first glance, such issues may appear limited to a single social group or individual. We will look at one of Baldwin’s plays, a couple of short stories, and four of his early novels, from Go Tell it on the Mountain to If Beale Street Could Talk. Questions of race, sexuality, and the pursuit of happiness will be discussed.\n\nDr. Gordon E. Thompson, a Professor of English and African American cultural studies at the City College of New York/CUNY, has degrees in English, African American Studies, and American Studies, from, respectively, the City College of New York and Yale University. He has taught at institutions such as Stanford and LSU, publishing two books on African American literature, The Assimilationist Impulse in Four African American Narratives and Black Music, Black Poetry. Along with conference presentations, he has written articles for American Literature, Callaloo, CLA, and African American Review. In addition to his lectures on classic African American poetry, the art and culture of the Harlem Renaissance, American literature, and the great books of world literature, he is currently circulating a draft of an article on the life and fiction of James Baldwin.\n\nB2046 Taste of the Archive: African American Literature and Oral History as Praxis\n\nProf. Janée Moses\n\nThursdays 4:45 – 6:35pm\n\nSection 4RS (20994)\n\nThis seminar, which begins and ends with Brent Hayes Edwards’s essay, “The Taste of the Archive” bends genre with a simultaneous study of narrative, oral history, and archive to highlight aspects of the past that are “hard to pin down” or elusive. In the first part of the course, students will explore fiction and non-fiction texts in the African American literary canon that deal with issues of race, class, gender, sexuality, and belonging to highlight contradictory truths that “can’t quite be explained away,” and consider how methods of African American literature can be applied to narrative-based oral history projects that embrace, rather than bridle, complicated truths about our shared pasts.\n\nIn the second part of the course, students will merge African American literary methods, archival practices, and oral history methods and theory to create their oral history projects. These projects will include the development of oral narratives that move from the realm of spoken word to polished manuscripts. In addition to the manuscript, students will analyze their oral history practice by writing methodology statements that expand the field of oral history.\n\nJanée Moses, Assistant Professor of English, specializes in African American Literature, 20th-century black expressive cultures, and oral history theory and methodology. Her current book project is an intertextual study of black women’s life writing and performances that combines extraordinary pursuits and ordinary experiences to highlight the fullness of their lives. Her writing appears in publications including Rejoinder and BOMB Magazine. An established oral historian, Moses serves as the Director of BOMB Magazine’s Oral History Project, preserving the narratives of black visual artists in America.\n\nThis course is also available as Craft Seminar.\n\nB2140 Immigration Literature: Place ­– Language – Identity\n\nProf. Grazyna Drabik\n\nTuesdays 6:45 – 8:35pm\n\nSection 2TU (21431)\n\nThe immigrant experience has been well represented in American literature since the beginning of the 20th c. Numerous narratives, in fiction and non-fiction, chart the dynamics, variations, and stages of the migration experience. They tend to highlight the Ur-concept of the “American Dream” and the process of “assimilation/ acculturation” by which immigrants “become Americans,” espousing the promise of a new life. The leading themes of the immigration literature are clashes of culture; forging new individual and communal identities; conflicting loyalties that shape lives led between the adopted homeland and country of origin; redefinition of gender roles and of inter-generational relations; and the transformative role of education.\n\nImportant writers such as Willa Cather, Claude McKay, Frank McCourt, Paule Marshall, Sandra Cisneros, and Julie Otsuko have contested and enriched the American literary canon in significant ways addressing these important themes. Our graduate seminar recognizes the riches of this classic ethnic-based (or place of origin-based) approach but also notes the need to extend the discussion further, in an open-ended and exploratory manner.\n\nThe course will focus on the dialectics of place, language, and identity, as highlighted by the writers, our contemporaries, who speak with the “forked-tongue,” writing from the perspective of a bi-cultural, marginal, and/or transnational experience. They are particularly attuned to the impact of massive displacement and to contradictions of ongoing cultural transformations. Their novels and short stories, plays, poems and personal essays do not fit comfortably within established versions of national histories, as they confront the complexity of cross-cultural encounters and the importance of transnational ties.\n\nOur readings include novels by Cristina García, Stuart Dybek and Teju Cole; a play by Martyna Majok; short stories by Jhumpa Lahiri; and selection of poems and essays by Dunya Mikhail, Maxine Hong Kingston, Czeslaw Milosz, Edwidge Danticat and Aleksander Hemon.\n\nThe seminar is demanding in terms of the amount and diversity of reading materials, but leaves space for individual special interests, offering a wide range of choices for the term project.\n\nGrazyna Drabik teaches World Humanities & Immigration Literature at City College and a seminar on Arts in New York at Macaulay Honors College, CUNY. Her areas of special interest are cross-cultural exchanges and challenges of literary translation. She has recently published the translation of Andrzej Bobkowski’s Wartime Notebooks: France, 1940- 1944 (Yale University Press, 2018) and is currently preparing a large selection of poems by Brazilian poet Adélia Prado, to be published in Polish.\n\nC0910 The Short Story in the Americas and Beyond\n\nProf. Lyn Di Iorio\n\nTuesdays 4:45 – 6:35pm\n\nSection 2RS (20987)\n\nIn this course we explore the modern short story, a beautiful yet highly underrated form. Our approach focuses on both the genre tendencies of the short story since it began in the 19th century in the Americas and its technical aspects. We will follow the idea that there have been two genre tendencies in short story practice. The first involves uncanny, mysterious, magical and haunted happenings. The first modern short stories by Americas-based authors, such as Nathaniel Hawthorne and Edgar Allan Poe, were in this mysterious-haunted category. In Latin America, Jorge Luis Borges and Julio Cortázar adapted that tendency. Mariana Enriquez and Carmen Maria Machado are contemporary pursuers of it. We will read these writers and others in this category. The other genre tendency is decidedly non-magical. These realist pieces often focus on the psychology of characters who are outsiders because of class, race, gender, queerness, youth, identity or psychic bent. Practitioners of this tendency include Anton Chekhov, Ernest Hemingway, Junot Díaz, and Otessa Moshfegh. We will also have to contend with the fact that some authors seem to write in both categories. Lauren Groff and Bryan Washington come to mind and of course we will read them.\n\nIn discussing the short story, we must also address its technical aspects. Among other elements, we will consider protagonists and their desire lines; the way story conflict escalates; the importance of good endings; and the use of sensuous and precise details. I will also probably devote class days to discussions about violence, animals, and children in the short story.\n\nThe main writing assignments will be a final research paper about stories read in class and an essay delivered as an oral report about a short story to be discussed in class. But we will also have extra fun with one or two creative writing exercises. I urge creative writers to write a short story as their final project!\n\nLyn Sandín Di Iorio is a fiction writer and scholar. She is a recent recipient of a New York Foundation for the Arts Fiction Fellowship and a Rifkind Center Faculty Fellowship for her book-in-progress: Hurricanes and Other Stories. Her short fiction has appeared most recently in The Kenyon Review and Big Other: Puerto Rican Writers Folio: A Hauntology and a story was named “Distinguished Story” in Best American Short Stories 2021. She also wrote Outside the Bones, a finalist for the 2012 John Gardner Fiction Prize and Killing Spanish, a book about Latinx literature and identity. She graduated from Harvard University and Stanford University’s Creative Writing Program, and received her Ph.D. from UC-Berkeley. She teaches creative writing and literature classes at CCNY and CUNY Graduate Center."
