        "text": "For example, I was able to uncover Musil’s work that he published under a pseudonym when he was 17 to 18 years old in a Sunday edition of a newspaper in Brno, Czech Republic, his home at the time (A Séance and At Twilight). These works are considered \"hits\" because they were previously unknown. A recent example is the discovery of a certificate that showed he was training at the mechanical engineering lab at the University of Stuttgart in 1903. This certificate, written by Carl von Bach, the laboratory chief at the time, was buried for over a century. Until its discovery, there was only circumstantial evidence of his training at the lab, so this is considered a \"hit\" as well. So far, I've published about two dozen \"hits\" in German in Chuo University's bulletins (Doitsu Bungaku (the German Culture) and Jinbunken Kiyou (Humanities bulletins)). Some of them have been published by German publishers, with me credited as the author.\n\nThe Hakone Ekiden race, for example, can't be seen live in Germany. Not only that, but there is probably no familiarity with the event in any country outside of Japan, not just Europe. On the papers I write, the following by-line is always displayed: Hayasaka. Chuo-Universität, Tokio. Although it may be modest, this is contributing to increasing the level of recognition of Chuo University. Of course, for Robert Musil, there is the International Robert Musil Society (IRMG), where works related to Musil, such as research papers, are organized as “Beitrag” (contributions), which means that the work I'm doing is effectively considered a contribution. With that said, what we refer to as overseas research surveys in Japan is just called academic research in other countries. Only in Japan do we include the \"overseas\" part. This means that for Japanese researchers—who travel all the way from Japan on expensive 20-hour round-trip flights—libraries and museums in these areas are more compelled to put in an earnest effort to help find the materials we are looking for. There are documents that we can acquire precisely because we come from the Far Eastern country of Japan, which means there are contributions that Japanese researchers are uniquely capable of making. These are certainly advantages that should be leveraged(2). In addition, I have arbitrarily decided that the work I'm doing should be considered as a sort of Zivildienst (civilian service, or more commonly, alternative service in lieu of military service).\n\nGermany had a system of conscription, or Wehrdienst, until 2011. Young men were sent to stay in military barracks for nine months to undergo athletic training, weapons training, camping and combat training so that they would be prepared to pick up a rifle should a war break out. This is not unique to Germany. About 20 countries, including South Korea, Switzerland and Russia have systems of conscription that last between six months and two years. Very few countries, such as Japan, Iceland and Costa Rica, have never had conscription in the 75 years after World War II(3). However, in most countries, with the exception of South Korea and North Korea, you can apply for exemption as a conscientious objector. In Germany, if you have moral objections toward war, and it is recognized by the government, you are eligible for alternative service, such as caring for senior citizens, working in facilities for the disabled or volunteering at the Red Cross for 12 to 20 months (depending on the year). Now, let's take a look at Japan. For 75 years after the end of World War II, Japan's pacifist constitution spared us from instituting conscription. This may just be my personal opinion, but it seems to me that this is akin to having the entire nation having claimed conscientious objector status. So then, do we have a system of alternative service in its place? In fact, most non-Japanese people don't know that Japan has abandoned warfare, by \"trusting in the justice and faith of the peace-loving peoples of the world.\" The preamble of the Constitution of Japan states \"We desire to occupy an honored place in an international society,\" but have we been able to attain an honorable place simply by abandoning war? Doesn't it just look like to the world that the entirety of the Japanese populace is claiming conscientious objector status, while doing nothing in lieu of military service? It may be too late in this tense international climate where we can almost smell the gunpowder, but what have we done to \"occupy an honored place in an international society?\" How much have we been able to demonstrate to the world that we are not a people upon whom you can drop nuclear bombs without hesitation? With all due respect, I see more than a few professors in the humanities that consider Japan as the entire areas of their activities, and those who place far too much importance on the Hakone Ekiden race. I've contributed to the New Journal of Zurich, and been published by a German publisher (Wilhelm Fink). This is an example of a Japanese person, although surely inadequate, contributing to the development of international academic research. I can't speak for the level of impact that these efforts will have, but I believe that the modest work I've done can be considered a type of alternative service in this world full of menacing threats, as a contribution that demonstrates the honorable place that Japanese people occupy in the world. I hope that Chuo University students embrace this stance and have the desire to do work that has an impact on a global scale.\n\nThe side-by-side translation of the article featured in the New Journal of Zurich is available here.\n\nThe Jinbunken (Humanities Research) Booklet Kaigai Gakujutsu Chosa no Thrill to Tanoshimi (The Thrill and Enjoyment of Overseas Research Surveys) is available here.\n\nThe U.S. moved to an all-volunteer military force in 1973. The UK abolished conscription in 1960. France, which adopted extensive conscription during the French Revolution, recently abolished the system due to the increasing sophistication and specialization of military service. Many countries in Europe were on a trend toward abolishing conscription in the years following the Cold War between the 1990s and 2010, but in recent years, many are bringing back the system. Ukraine (2014), Lithuania (2015) and Sweden (2015) have all reinstituted conscription. This was in part a response to Russian actions and the stance taken by President Trump to withdraw from NATO. France and Germany are also considering reinstituting conscription, both as a response to Russian actions and as an effort to counter terrorism."
