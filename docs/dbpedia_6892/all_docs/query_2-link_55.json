        "text": "K\n\nby Roberto Calasso\n\nJonathan Cape Â£18.99, pp327\n\nRoberto Calasso has made his name with analytical paraphrases of belief systems. The Marriage of Cadmus and Harmony reorganised the Greek myths which are at the bottom of our cultural baggage (dusty and creased for most of us), while Ka applied the same method to a less familiar body of stories - Indian cosmology. Method isn't quite the word; it's more to do with style and tone, the effect of a sophisticated mind alternately rising above the material and sinking back, until everything glitters without having its meaning spelled out in the familiar academic way.\n\nWith K, he has taken on a corpus and a worldview of a different sort: the writings of Franz Kafka. The book is arranged in chapters with quirky titles. 'Ladies' Handkerchiefs' refers to a detail from In the Penal Colony, but is made up of short sections within each chapter. The approach of disclaiming a sustained argument and offering, instead, a galaxy of essaylets is either modest or frustrating, according to taste.\n\nThe book is the product of great love and deep immersion, but Calasso provides no personal history. He doesn't make clear if his reading of Kafka has always been in the original, though he lists the German critical editions as his sources (English renderings are presumably by the book's translator, Geoffrey Brock). If he is confident enough to dismiss critical exploration of, for instance, Kafka's relationship with Judaism as both dogged and fruitless, then he must have read a fair bit of it, but the few authors he quotes, such as Benjamin, Adorno and Robert Musil, tend to be German-language and not recent.\n\nOn the first page of the book, Calasso refers to Kafka having taken Occam's razor to the project of fiction, paring away all superfluous elements ('To name the bare minimum, and in its pure literality'). Calasso is drawn to compressed formulations, but he can't help extrapolating from and expatiating on what can't be reduced any further, prose not perhaps as dense as the densest star but often resembling 'a lunar landscape pocked with craters'.\n\nSome of his best suggestions are the most straightforward. Noticing the difference in visual richness between The Missing Person, usually known in this country as Amerika, and the more famous novels, he captures something both true and elusive when he writes: 'In The Trial and The Castle, everything unfolds first of all within an individual's psyche, and images interpose themselves from time to time, beating their bat wings against the flow of thought.'\n\nHe has useful things to say, almost in passing, about symbols ('It's awkward to speak of symbols in Kafka, because Kafka experienced everything as symbol') and about dream: 'In this case a lifeless word. It interrupts the flow of thought rather than guiding it.'\n\nHe spends a lot of time, though, wrestling with the text in a curiously old-fashioned way, like someone struggling to look over the shoulder of a figure in a realist painting, to see something outside the picture.\n\nA message destroyed by a character in The Castle prompts a little aria of speculation. 'Maybe it told Amalia just this: \"You're caught.\" Maybe it was a blackmail note or even a proposed pact of silence. Or maybe it was simply a notice informing her that someone has seen through her little game. Now that's something Amalia could never reveal, for such a notice would in itself be tantamount to expulsion from the village community ... ' A lot of 19th-century art solicited this sort of reaction, but 20th-century art tends to punish it.\n\nWhen Calasso writes about a character in The Trial, who has observed someone reading while following the lines with his finger, 'Leni has in mind the little silver hand used to keep one's place in the Torah', he not only trespasses into this danger zone, booby-trapped and philosophically off-limits (if you know what Leni thinks, you are claiming to know what Kafka thought while he wrote), but imports a specifically Jewish element to reinforce a point.\n\nAt one point, Calasso says very clearly that Kafka's work doesn't compose a single vision: 'The world of The Trial is more brutal and crude than the that of The Castle. The transitions are more vexing and jarring, more jagged.' This puts plainly what elsewhere requires geometrical contortion ('The worlds of The Trial and The Castle run parallel to all other worlds but not to each other').\n\nIn fact, most of K works on the opposite assumption, that Kafka's writings are coherent and continuous. Otherwise, it would be impossible to write, about a passage in The Trial: 'And the messengers - Josef K hasn't mentioned them before - and it's hard to imagine what their function might be. Which messengers? Used to communicate what? And invested with what powers? No answers can be abstracted from any of Josef K's prior thoughts. We're completely in the dark. But if we gaze ahead into the distance, we glimpse the silhouette of Barnabas in his silver livery, in the as-yet unconceived Castle. It's as if the crosshatched contours of another world are emerging, where the world of The Trial is destined to be continued.'\n\nThis portentous tone would be a bit much if it referred to any 20th-century writer. Applied to Kafka, who didn't complete a full-length manuscript and requested that his writing be destroyed, it's grotesque.\n\nCalasso's style often overlays Kafka with a strongly clashing flavour. It's as if someone who has been chopping garlic all morning has made gruel without washing his hands. He refers often to Indian cosmology, although karma, even if its literal meaning is simply 'acts', seems an actively hostile concept in this context. He enjoys Latin formulas - mundus imaginalis - and technical terms of many kinds ('bardo', 'hierodule'). For all its devotion, this literary personality seems very much at odds with Kafka's nature, so tentative and implacable."
