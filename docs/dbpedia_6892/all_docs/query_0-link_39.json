        "text": "Robert Walser (born April 15, 1878, Biel, Switz.—died Dec. 25, 1956, Herisau) was a Swiss poet and novelist hailed after his death as a genius.\n\nAfter abandoning his studies at age 14, Walser took accounting lessons and attempted unsuccessfully to become an actor. He took up various humble occupations—butler, clerk, assistant librarian, and bookseller. His life was marked by a sense of alienation and a desire for solitude, also reflected in his literary work, which influenced some of the most renowned writers of the 20th century, including Franz Kafka, Robert Musil, and Elias Canetti. Among his best-known novels are Geschwister Tanner (1906; The Tanners), Der Gehülfe (1908; The Assistant), and Jakob von Gunten (1909; Eng. trans. Jakob von Gunten), a work that defined his vision of day-to-day life in Berlin, where he moved in 1905. He continued to write after returning to Biel in 1913, when his mental disorder began to show its first signs. In 1929 he was admitted to Waldau psychiatric hospital in Bern. He was moved in 1933 to a different institution in Herisau and remained there until his death. His writings, initially appreciated solely by his fellow novelists, began to interest a wide audience after his death. In 2010 an English-language tribute book, The Microscripts, was published, containing colour illustrations, transcriptions, and translations of 25 short pieces by Walser written in the tiny script he perfected."
