        "text": "In this collection of thirteen essays written over the span of thirty-six years, between 1973 and 2009, Bernhard Böschenstein invites his readers to an erudite stroll through key texts by Thomas Mann, Jean Paul, Robert Walser, Franz Kafka, and Robert Musil. These essays are published in their original form without any revisions or bibliographical updates. Most of them—with the exception of the introductory articles on Thomas Mann—focus on short pieces whose poetic energy and density—as the title suggests—testify to the “explosive power” of prose miniatures.\n\nThe three essays included in the first section explore the tension between the Apollonian and the Dionysiac in Thomas Mann’s Death in Venice; the resonance of, and challenges to, Winckelmann’s aesthetics in a wide and varied array of texts by Hölderlin, Jean Paul, Goethe, Stifter, Meyer, Rilke, George, and Mann; and the influence of Ernst Bertram’s book Nietzsche (1918) in Thomas Mann’s Doktor Faustus. The second section of the volume consists of four essays on Robert Walser and Jean Paul, one of Walser’s favorite authors. “Zu Robert Walsers Dichterporträts” lays bare the uncanny mix of fact and fiction in Walser’s portraits of selected writers such as Brentano, Kleist, Hölderlin, Lenau, Büchner, and Lenz, whom Walser viewed as mirrors of himself, i.e., as marginalized figures who do not fit in. The essay on Jean Paul’s Leben des vergnügten Schulmeisterlein Maria Wutz in Auenthal examines how metaphors disturb idyllic harmony, open up gaps between image and reality, introduce reflexive dissonance and humor, and create oscillations between names and things. [End Page 156] “Theatralische Miniaturen. Zur frühen Prosa Robert Walsers” focuses on texts written between 1902 and 1912 in which Walser blurs the boundaries between theater, dream, artifice, and reality. “Herakles im Treppenhaus. Zum vierten Band von Robert Walsers Mikrogrammen” analyzes Walser’s microscripts as a point of entry into Walser’s complex and playful writing process. The third section includes two essays on Robert Walser and Kafka. “Nah und fern zugleich. Franz Kafkas Betrachtung und Robert Walsers Berliner Skizzen” brings into relief similarities and discrepancies between both authors while “Franz Kafka. Elf Söhne” explores how Kafka reflects on his own literary production.\n\nThe fourth and last section includes four essays on Robert Musil. “Musil’s Rede zur Rilke-Feier” carefully uncovers Musil’s insightful interpretation of Rilke’s poetry by going back to the poems that Musil used as examples. Rilke’s poems on animals, lunatics, and angels, as well as his interest in fleeting emotional states and “unlimited correlations” (193), echo Musil’s own inquiry into the “other condition.” “Extreme Landschaften bei Musil und Thomas Mann” convincingly demonstrates how both authors, in spite of their tense relationship and aesthetic discrepancies, rely on similar strategies—in particular music—to conjure up heroic landscapes. “Die Zeit als Entlarverin falscher Gefühle in den Unfreundlichen Betrachtungen im Nachlass zu Lebzeiten” sheds light on failed or dysfunctional relationships to time, such as the unsuccessful attempts to overcome temporality by erecting monuments that no one notices (“Denkmale”), the illusory immortalizing power of photography, writers’ overreliance on Zeitgeist, the sectarian and quasi-pathological cult of pseudo-geniuses (“Unter lauter Dichtern und Denkern”), the conformism lurking behind the pseudosingularity of touristic consumption (“Hier ist es schön”; “Wer hat dich, du schöner Wald”), and the over-inflation of one’s (historical) importance. The last essay, “Der späteste Musil. Zu seinen Reflexionen und Reaktionen in den Tagebüchern,” focuses on Musil’s diary entries during his Swiss exile, at a time when he felt trapped and silenced in the face of political developments. Although circumstantial, these entries display the intellectual rigor and vigilance that are Musil’s hallmark. Musil’s critique entails a radical self-questioning with desperate overtones: his attempts at understanding the “average man..."
