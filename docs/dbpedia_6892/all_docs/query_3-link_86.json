Gass.\n\n202 pp. Baltimore:\n\nJohns Hopkins University Press.\n\nCloth, $35. Paper, $12.95.\n\nIn recent years, the Swiss-German writer Robert Walser (1878-1956) has acquired the reputation of a neglected master of 20th-century German literature. The author of many volumes of fiction, poetry, journalistic essays and ''dramolettes,'' Walser drew the attention of contemporaries like Franz Kafka, Hermann Hesse and Robert Musil. Susan Bernofsky, who has selected and translated the pieces by Walser collected in '' 'Masquerade' and Other Stories,'' notes that he was ''a writer whose singular, virtuoso, absolutely essential otherness cost him the favor of the reading public of his day.'' That is a judgment with which the author himself would probably have agreed.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
