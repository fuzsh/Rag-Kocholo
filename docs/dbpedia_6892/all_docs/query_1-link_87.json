        "text": "“Before the Law” (“Vor dem Gesetz”) is one of the most if not the single most commented upon of Kafka’s texts : “Helplessness seizes one face to face with this page and a half,” notes George Steiner. Has everything not already been said, been written, been thought, about this text? Like a detective, the commentator searches for the key that will once and for all resolve the enigma, unveil the mystery that hides so secretively within its depths. A mystery which we know everything depends upon. One might skeptically wonder at the discovery of yet another interpretation of “Before the Law”: “What more can be added?” he asks himself. And he may be right. Perhaps the gates of interpretation are henceforth sealed. We may have arrived too late. But before this text, do we not always already come too late? Has not the doorkeeper always already shut the door? The moment one realizes there is nothing to add to this text might be the very moment one realizes that, from the start, this text, though soliciting interpretation, in fact defies interpretation. We are indeed seized by helplessness. Equally impotent before this text, the first reading equals the last reading, because strictly speaking there is no first and no last here. Before this text, as before the law, we find ourselves equally exposed, equally empty, without resources. Before this text, we find ourselves, exactly like the story’s protagonist, the countryman, the Mann vom Lande: ignorant. And from this position the text inspires us infinitely. Ignorance serves therefore as my starting point in the interpretation of \"Before the Law\" proposed in the following study.\n\nWalter Benjamin’s great essay on Franz Kafka is a key example of his philosophical praxis, which exhumes the prehistoric substrate of modernity in order to expose the myth of progress in modernity’s claim to epochal legitimacy. Benjamin’s physiognomic thinking endows Kafka with the features of his own thought, an intellectual messianism or revolutionary nihilism that frames Kafka’s legal world with a radical critique of law. The verdict against modernity Benjamin finds in Kafka is couched in a series of theologically tinted figures. The obscurity of Kafka’s “parables,” the fruit of an aesthetics of “failure” that observes “das Bilderverbot,” veils a messianic vision of justice. Benjamin’s Gnostic picture of modernity as a bureaucratic prison house reflects Josef K.’s victimised view of his situation in The Trial. Hans Blumenberg’s therapeutic account of myth suggests a view of Kafka’s work at odds with Benjamin’s idea of the normless, “mythic” quality of law and politics in modernity.\n\nThis article aims to address Walter Benjamin’s theory of tradition through the prism of Benjamin’s works on Franz Kafka, his ongoing correspondence with Gershom Scholem on Kafka, and a dream he had in the French internment camp, which in my reading relates to the world of Kafka. The article proposes that Franz Kafka served as a point of mediation for Benjamin’s changing formulations of tradition. The article then further suggests that Benjamin’s work on tradition was structured by a fundamental tension between tradition and life outside tradition, i.e., tradition and life in exile. The article shows how, in the context of Benjamin’s correspondence with Scholem, the tension of exile and tradition mirrored a growing personal and theoretical conflict between Scholem in Palestine and Benjamin in Europe. To examine the effects of the conceptual structure of tradition and exile on Benjamin’s experience as an émigré, the article first addresses Benjamin’s so called Fichu dream from Nevers. In the suggested reading, the dream portrays Benjamin’s vision of decay of tradition that informs his essays and letters on Kafka."
