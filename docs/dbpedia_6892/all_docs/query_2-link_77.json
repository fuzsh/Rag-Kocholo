        "text": "The paper articulates an implicit theory of language in Musil’s unfinished novel Der Mann ohne Eigenschaften. Specifically, I argue that Musil inverts Nietzsche’s theory of language from “On Truth and Lying in a Non-Moral Sense,” and demonstrates the results of this inversion through the characters Moosbrugger and Ulrich. Where Nietzsche valorizes the poet’s relationship to language above the philosopher-scientist’s, Musil dismisses this distinction as merely rhetorical. Nietzsche’s poet-vs.-philosopher opposition simply allegorizes what is, instead, a dynamic intermingling of ‘truth’ and ‘misrepresentation’ that lies at the metaphorical heart of language, independent of its particular uses. Moosbrugger defends himself against imprecision in speech by adopting a hyper-literal stance—a defensive posture that only magnifies the poetry of language that overwhelms him. Ulrich’s opposing sensitivity to the scientific ordering of language is equally pathological. Ulrich pawns off language’s metaphoricity on reality, concluding that we should not take God’s creation “literally.” This paper shows how Musil reads Nietzsche’s theory of the original metaphoricity of language through the Judeo-Christian myth of the active word in order to reveal Moosbrugger’s muteness as the reverse side of Ulrich’s pathological facility with language. Both, in turn, are ciphers for meta-textual questions about the conditions of Musil’s own writerly production.\n\nThe death sentence signifies a discrete bounding of the metaphysical condition known as living. The term references both grammar and narration. As a grammatical suggestion, death indicates the point where living comes to a full-stop. Narratologically, by contrast, death frequently generates stories, giving birth to reconstructions of the scene of the crime and the moments that led up to it. Narratives based on real, fatal crimes invite us to consider the ethics of storytelling. Jaques Derrida’s discussions of sacrifice (The Gift of Death) and of the ethical responsibility that the living owe the dead (Specters of Marx) point us toward theorizing narrative in terms of an economy of ethics. With respect to true crime narratives, we must ask, is the surviving text—in part the product of Others’ deaths—the profit of unethical narration? Focusing on Truman Capote’s In Cold Blood and Toni Morrison’s Jazz, this essay discusses the ethics of authorship, the justice of narrative, and the im/material bodies who haunt crime narratives. This essay considers whether the creative license that the novels take with the facts constitute a second-order crime, an injustice against the victims whose violent demise occasioned the writing. It asks crucial questions about our complicity in the pleasure of murder and about the ethical responsibilities of both writers and readers to the actually-dead.\n\nThe purpose of this paper is to analyse two novels, Martin Amis’s Other People and Paul Auster’s Travels in the Scriptorium, with respect to the way in which both the texts raise questions about the quintessence of the narrative act in postmodern detective fiction. Amis and Auster depict in their works the dilemmas of alienation, dislocation and a highly subjective seeing of the reality. The author of the article aims to show the mastery with which Martin Amis and Paul Auster manipulate their protagonists, narrators, and simultaneously implicate the reader in the process of storytelling, making him/her become the participant in, even the accomplice of their literary homicide and violence towards the narratees and the narrator. During the examination of Amis’s Other People, I refer to Jean Paul-Sartre’s No Exit, William Wordsworth’s Lyrical Ballads and, above all, Craig Raine’s and Christopher Reid’s poems representing the “Martian School of Poetry.” Key words: M. Amis, P. Auster, postmodern detective fiction, writer, narrator, narrative act, homicide\n\nMorality plays are a medieval dramatic/literary form in which a generic human (‘everyman’) protagonist encounters personified virtues and vices, and a theological lesson about the fate of the soul is imparted. Mystery plays focus, by contrast, on the events of scripture. Despite the declining relevance of Christianity in the modern West, the use of these medieval dramatic forms is popular within fiction, and crime and detective fiction in particular. Barry Unsworth’s (1995) Morality Play, which was shortlisted for the Booker Prize, used the device of the play to structure a narrative that is part detective story and part explanation of the emergence of modern, plastic notions of the self and of life as conscious acting. Less distinguished popular fiction, such as Candace Robb’s (1994) The Lady Chapel (part of a series featuring royal agent Owen Archer and his apothecary wife Lucie Wilton) and Ian Morson’s (1997) Falconer and the Face of God (part of a series featuring William Falconer, Regent Master in thirteenth century Oxford and friend of Roger Bacon), employ the machinery of the stage as part of a murder plot. The contemporary detective television series Dalziel and Pascoe, also features the mystery play motif in the episode “Bones and Silence” (1996, screened 1998). This paper surveys examples of modern popular culture employing medieval dramatic forms and suggests reasons for their popularity.\n\nIn The Case of Literature, Arne Höcker offers a radical reassessment of the modern European literary canon. His reinterpretations of Goethe, Schiller, Büchner, Döblin, Musil, and Kafka show how literary and scientific narratives have determined each other over the past three centuries, and he argues that modern literature not only contributed to the development of the human sciences but also established itself as the privileged medium for a modern style of case-based reasoning. The Case of Literature deftly traces the role of narrative fiction in relation to the scientific knowledge of the individual from eighteenth-century psychology and pedagogy to nineteenth-century sexology and criminology to twentieth-century psychoanalysis. Höcker demonstrates how modern authors consciously engaged casuistic forms of writing to arrive at new understandings of literary discourse that correspond to major historical transformations in the function of fiction. He argues for the centrality of literature to changes in the conceptions of psychological knowledge production around 1800; legal responsibility and institutionalized forms of decision-making throughout the nineteenth century; and literature's own realist demands in the early twentieth century. \"A brilliant book on the important genre of the literary case study. Arne Höcker shows how administrative decision-making, at the very moment in the 19th century when it seems to function flawlessly, gives birth to its uncanny other, the individual case study.\" (Fritz Breithaupt, Indiana University, author of The Dark Sides of Empathy) \"The Case of Literature lucidly unfolds a history of the literary case study in German literature from Goethe to the modernists Döblin and Musil, with a concluding postscript on Kafka. This well written book uses original analyses of important texts to persuasively make the case for a three-phase contribution of German narrative to our understanding of the literary case study as a genre.\" (Judith Ryan, Harvard University, author of The Cambridge Introduction to German Poetry)\n\nStefan Zweig, in his biography of Rolland, called music \"the wordless speech of humanity\". Rolland and Mann, in telling the tumultuous story of their age, make the protagonists of their respective novels, Jean-Christophe and Doctor Faustus, composers. In so doing, they entwine the fate of humanity with art, the pinnacle of which for both is represented by German music. Music’s ineffability however brings it into a relationship with vulnerability. Rolland explores the vulnerability of musical genius when stifled by hardship, personal tragedy and intense human suffering. Mann, building on Nietzsche’s notion of the affirmative relationship between art and life, probes the vulnerability of music itself, and by implication the vulnerability of liberal humanism as it descends into an era of barbarism in Germany. This paper will therefore examine the vulnerability of Jean-Christophe Krafft and Adrian Leverkühn's music in Jean-Christophe and Doctor Faustus with the aim of elucidating both novels’ major themes and characters and their authors’ broader philosophical and artistic preoccupations."
