Condition: Good. A master of high modernist literature explores female sexuality and desire through the eyes of two women-one, married and unfaithful; the other, caught in a love triangle-in these two erotic novellasFirst published in 1911, Intimate Ties is Robert Musils second book, consisting of two novellas, The Culmination of Love and The Temptation of Silent Veronica. Each revolves around a troubled woman in the throes of her sexual and romantic woes, as their memories of the past return to influence their present desires. Musil tracks the psyche of his protagonists in a blurring of impressions that is reflected in his experimental prose.Intimate Ties offers the reader an early glimpse of the high modernist style Musil would perfect in his magnum opus The Man Without Qualities.
