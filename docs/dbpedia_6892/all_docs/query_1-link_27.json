        "text": "Kafka\n\nThe Decisive Years.\n\nBy Reiner Stach.\n\nTranslated by Shelley Frisch.\n\nIllustrated. 581 pp. Harcourt. $35.\n\n\"To do justice to the figure of Kafka in its purity and its peculiar beauty one must never lose sight of one thing: it is the purity and beauty of a failure,\" wrote Walter Benjamin to his friend Gershom Scholem. It was 1938 and Benjamin had fled to Paris and had just been reading Max Brod's biography of Kafka, published 13 years after his death. Benjamin hated the way the book turned the author of self-consuming parables and fragmented novels into just another neglected saint and genius like Mozart. He thought it one of the signs of Kafka's enormous will to fail that he could have picked this optimistic Zionist, philistine and journalist to be his closest friend. Brod was just the right person to ignore Kafka's last wish to have all his papers burned.\n\nTo love the particular futility of \"The Metamorphosis\" and fragments like \"The Cares of a Family Man\" as intensely as Benjamin did, you have to be infatuated with the idea of total failure, as Benjamin also was. To be a failure in this way, you have to do more than merely fall short of a goal you set yourself. All of life must be lived as if to prove the impossibility of harmonious reconciliation between love, work, art and the duties to yourself, to your family, to others. Your very existence is evidence that you are guilty of being alive, and there are plenty of people around to remind you of it.\n\nMany years and a few generations of Kafka biographers later, Reiner Stach promises a biography that will finally give a complete portrait of one of the 20th century's great failures, a man whose works could make events out of non-events and non-events out of events. He notes early that Kafka, in his writing, \"left a heap of rubble for posterity,\" yet he doesn't manage to catch the \"peculiar beauty\" and purity that Benjamin found in these ruins. Rather, Stach does Kafka the odd homage of flagrantly failing to do so in a manner that only proves Kafka's enduring influence."
