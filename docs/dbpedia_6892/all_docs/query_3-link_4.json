        "text": "The Perils of Obedience, by Stanley Milgram\n\n1490 Words | 3 Pages\n\nIf a person of authority ordered you inflict a 15 to 400 volt electrical shock on another innocent human being, would you follow your direct orders? That is the question that Stanley Milgram, a psychologist at Yale University tested in the 1960’s. Most people would answer “no,” to imposing pain on innocent human beings but Milgram wanted to go further with his study. Writing and Reading across the Curriculum holds a shortened edition of Stanley Milgram’s “The Perils of Obedience,” where he displays an eye-opening experiment that tests the true obedience of people under authority figures. He observes that most people go against their natural instinct to never harm innocent humans and obey the extreme and dangerous instructions of authority figures. Milgram is well aware of his audience and organization throughout his article, uses quotes directly from his experiment and connects his research with a real world example to make his article as effective as possible.\n\nCompare And Contrast Milgram's Experiment And Zimbardo\n\n1580 Words | 4 Pages\n\nFor the guards “brutality was a “natural” consequence of being in the uniform of a ‘guard’ and asserting the power inherent in that role”.The Milgram Experiment took place in 1961. It was members of the “general public” mostly men who volunteered to take part in the study. This scientific study was a “study of the memory”. In this experiment there were two roles administered. The two roles being; the “Teacher” and the “Learner”. The role of the Teacher was to administer “shocks of increasing magnitude (from 15 V to 450 V in 15-V increments) to another man (the ‘‘Learner’’) every time he failed to recall the correct word in a previously learned pair”. Without the knowledge of the teacher, the Learner was “Milgram's confederate, and the shocks were not real”. Also rather than being more interested in the memory like the study specified, Milgram was more engrossed upon how far men would actually go to carry out the task. At the end of the experiment it was to him and others shock that, “the answer was very far”. By very far it was proved that the Teachers were “willing to administer shocks of 300 v and 65% went all the way\n\nAbuse Of Power In A Few Good Men\n\n1077 Words | 3 Pages\n\nBesides, his actions continued to be abusive when Claudio’s sister, Isabella, comes to beg for her brother’s life. He proposes Isabella to sleep with him and only then he would agree not to sentence Claudio to death. In this case, he also uses his authority to gain what he wants, which is obviously an abuse of power. Another example of the abuse of power is in “A Few Good Men.” In the movie two U.S. Marines, Dawson, and Downey, are judged in a court-martial for killing their colleague, Private Santiago and are defended by LT Kaffee with the assistance of Cmdr. Galloway. The defenders are suspicious about the details of the murder and the storyline about Santiago. According to it, Santiago was not respecting commands, requiring to be transferred and his fellow Marines decided to train him into a better Marine. They suspect that the “Code Red,” which is an extrajudicial punishment, was ordered and carried out by two Marines. De facto, “Code Red” was ordered by Colonel Jessep, and LT Kaffee can make him confess it under pressure in the court-martial. Thus, Colonel’s example also shows abusive behavior as he used his power to achieve what he wanted bearing in mind the fact that U.S. Marines could not disobey orders. Therefore, it could be seen that law enforcement does not always mean applying the letter of the law and following the rule\n\nFunctionalism In The Shawshank Redemption\n\n1117 Words | 3 Pages\n\nWhile being taunted he takes his role as prisoner and breaks down from that with the taunting. His role as the prisoner continues as his cries and taunts from the other inmates bring the attention of the guards for being noisy. He is then reprimanded by the guards for causing noise with his crying. The prisoner is being disciplined by the guard, it is the case where the both the inmate and guard are assuming their roles in\n\nManipulation and Defiance: Winning the Rigged Game\n\n1875 Words | 4 Pages\n\nIn this, individual’s regain self-confidence, and in turn inspires others to pursue the same. With Mcmurphy’s unwavering confidence and belief, the impossible seemed achievable, and gave hope to the other patients. Consequently, this phenomena inspired the rest of the patients to band together, and act out against injustice- regardless of the discomfort this imposed upon them. In doing all, an individual is able to evoke self confidence and overcome personal obstacles, just as Chief did. As the novel highlights, life will not always be lawful. Despite the convenience of conformity, individuals must muster up the courage to face the unjust, in order to restore any sense of self-esteem and save the vulnerable. Many humans are frail and cowardly, but with the guidance of a committed leader, even the most grim obstacles can be\n\nThe Impact Decision Making Has on the Society\n\n762 Words | 2 Pages\n\nThe short stories “Just Lather that’s all” and “Gregory” have pressure from their own instincts or from someone else’s orders. The pressure which the main characters face in the story is that they have to be obligatigated to make a careful decision because it can affect someone’s life any minute or second. The soldier is in a position where he has to conclude whether he is going to kill his daring friend or face the head quarters with a great amount of risks. “Gregory” is a story about loyalty, friendship and irony which the soldier realizes his circumstances are difficult. The head quarters’ message was very clear and indicated “As soon as Lieutenant Rafel’s execution is announced, the hostage Gregory is to be shot and his body must be hanged from a telegraph pole in the main street as an exemplary punishment”(Ioannides, 4). This quote depicts tha...\n\nFranz Kafka\n\n954 Words | 2 Pages\n\n...Once more the odious courtesies began, the first handed the knife across K. to the second, who handed it across K. back again to the first. K. now perceived clearly that he was supposed to seize the knife himself, as it traveled from hand to hand above him, and plunge it into his own breast. But he did not do so, he merely turned his head, which was still free to move, and gazed around him. He could not completely rise to the occasion, he could not relieve the officials of all their tasks; the responsibility for this last failure of his lay with him who had not left him the remnant of strength necessary for the deed....\n\nBabylon Revisited Modernism Essay\n\n902 Words | 2 Pages\n\nThe modernist style of writing is one of disillusionment, frustration and loss of hope. The modernist writers did not try to point out silver linings or brighter futures, instead they explored the depths of the sorrows of life in the time of the great depression and the long road to recovery from it. Most of these writers blamed the modernization of America for the stock market crash that brought on the great depression. Likewise, modern politics drew America into not only one, but two world wars. At the same time, modern intellectual advancements challenged or usurped traditional beliefs and values.\n\nThe Influence Of Obedience In A Few Good Men\n\n1024 Words | 3 Pages\n\nThe two Marines did not understand why they were charged with his murder, claiming, “We didn’t do anything wrong.” They claimed that they were only following orders from a superior. To explain the Marines’ behaviors, Milgram would argue that the Marines fell to the pressures of authority. In the article “The Perils of Obedience,” Milgram tests the psychological affects on the “teacher” rather than on the “learner” (Milgram 78) About two-thirds of the test subjects were completely obedient and used the 450-volt shocks, and all of the participants used the painful 300-volt shock (Milgram 80). With these surprising results, Milgram deducts that many of these test subjects carried out these actions because of the authority figure in the room. Coming to a final conclusion, Milgram states that ordinary people are likely to follow orders given by an authority figure, even to the extent of killing an innocent human being (Milgram 86). Obedience to authority is ingrained in children from the day they are born, and they are raised to be obedient and this is why many people are obedient. With Milgram’s conclusion, it would be logical to assume that he would argue that the influence of authority is why Dawson and\n\nSummary Of Franz Kafka's The Penal Colony Essay\n\n2354 Words | 5 Pages\n\nThe officer demands that any of the primitive people of the land who are accused of an act, without the right to trial, or even any opportunity to not be guilty, are placed in the machine. Once the machine begins the punishment, which the prisoner may or may not have deserved, is inscribed onto his or her body in a code. Only the officer can translate this code though, leaving all trust in his translation. The machine then kills the prisoner over 12 hours, the first 6 involving excruciating pain, and the last 6 with the prisoner unconscious. This system was put in place by the Old Commandant and is looking to be replaced by the New Commandant, but the officer feels that there is so much good that comes from it. He believes that in the suffering that these prisoners encounter, bring about enlightenment, ultimately changing them. The explorer finds it very difficult to look at these actions as fair though and cannot agree with the\n\nThe Officer As A Jesus Figure In In The Penal Colony\n\n900 Words | 2 Pages\n\n“Purification unto Death”:The Officer as a Jesus Figure in In the Penal Colony Most short stories deal with change and the plot is the force driving that change. In the Penal Colony, by Franz Kafka, is about the changing of governorship and most importantly, one officer's inability to adapt. Once the Explorer declines to help the Officer continue his executions, the Explorer reports to the Commandment. The Officer chooses to kill himself in order to spare the Condemned in an ironic but messianic way; however, the Officer's intentions go astray when the machine slaughters him as opposed to giving him a chance to appreciate the religious experience that the drawn out torment may enable. This turn of action by the Officer is Kafka’s way of explaining\n\nWaiting For The Barbarians Essay\n\n800 Words | 2 Pages\n\nThis event makes the Magistrate slightly uneasy about the practices and causes him to start a conversation with Joll about the subject of torture, which manifests as an important interaction. The Magistrate asks, “What if your prisoner is telling the truth…yet he finds he is not believed? Is that not a terrible position…How do you ever know when a man has told you the truth?” (Coetzee, 5). In response, Colonel Joll goes on to state, “There is a certain tone…First I get lies, you see-this is what happens-first lies, then pressure, then more lies, then more pressure, then the break, then more pressure, then the truth. That is how you get the truth.” (Coetzee, 6). The Magistrate then thinks to himself, “Pain is truth; all else is subject to doubt. That is what I bear away from my conversation with Colonel Joll.” This dialogue reveals the divergence in thought between the Magistrate and Colonel Joll, which grows to be amongst the central focuses of the story. The Magistrate is beginning to question the practice of torture, both by its effectiveness and the ethical implications. His line of questioning indicates that he views the prisoners’ lives as holding value, however remote, and thus worth averting unnecessary harm. Colonel Joll however, sees no such potential\n\nFranz Kafka's The Trial\n\n1518 Words | 4 Pages\n\nFranz Kafka always had a strong background in literature and writing. Pursuing a career in law, Kafka put his writing skills to good use, but he always had a knack and passion for writing literature such as short stories, poetry and full novels more than working his actual job. By the age of 27, Kafka attended a play put on by a Yiddish theatre troupe performing in Prague. With the lack of money the troupe had, they became stranded in the town, where Kafka gained his interest in Yiddish theatre (Gray, 301). With the stranding of this troupe, critics believed this to be what led to the influence of most of Kafka’s later writings. This is believed due to the evidence of a journal found after Kafka’s death. These journals kept records of performances he attended, plot synopses, character analysis, descriptions of staging and critiques of the performances (Gray, 301). Kafka also had a journal filled with vignettes about specific productions, along with brief reflections on the theater and the production (Puchner, 177). We first see Kafka showin..."
