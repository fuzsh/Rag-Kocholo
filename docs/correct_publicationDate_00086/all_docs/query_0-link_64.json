        "text": "I remain speechless...\n\nAlthough highly educated, I was never assigned this reading while in school. If not for the fact that my seventh grade charter schooled child had been assigned (the abridged version) I likely would have never thoroughly consumed this work of art. Of course I had the most basic understanding of the concept of the story, I have never known the details one can only receive except by reading it cover to cover. I am now a mental health therapist and as such I fully believe this novel should be required reading within any mental health program, certainly in psychopathology classes. Thank you Audible for providing me, a very busy mom and professional an option to \"read\" this novel in a most convenient format."
