        "text": "Today is the birthday of Robert Louis Stevenson and we just wanted to show a quick bit of appreciation. Yes, the man is responsible for quite a few works and two really stick out at the top of the list. While many might initially associate Stevenson with creating ‘Treasure Island’ in 1883, I feel that my fellow authors and readers of fiction likely think of him for the 1886 novella ‘Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde.’\n\nYes, this novella is the perfect example of how shorter works can have a huge impact on readers and not everything has to be an epic to stand the test of time."
