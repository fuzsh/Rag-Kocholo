Described as “pale and dwarfish”, he gives the “impression of deformity without any nameable malformation” with his “displeasing smile”, home to a “sort of murderous mixture of timidity and boldness”, speaking with a “husky” and “somewhat broken voice” (B1). Saposnik explains the reason behind Hyde’s metaphorical descriptions: “essentially that is what he is: a metaphor of uncontrolled appetites, an amoral abstraction driven by a compelling will unrestrained by any moral halter. Such a creature is, of necessity, only figuratively describable, for his deformity is moral rather than physical.” (Saposnik)\n\nMr. Hyde is portrayed as being deformed in his physical features. Dr. Jekyll mentions that Hyde's deformities may be a result of being buried underneath Jekyll's respectable side. Barbara Gates depicts Hyde as a sort of shadow saying, \"He is both monster and shadow par excellence-- another self not only for Jekyll but for all the presumably upright Victorian bachelors of the story who perceive his deformities and for whom he becomes both devil and death knell. \" Hyde is a shadow and the lesser half of the two personalities because of his despicable personality.\n\nDr Jekyll And Mr Hyde Good Vs Evil\n\n536 Words | 3 Pages\n\nIn the first two chapters of Robert Louis Stevenson’s book, Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, the author shows good versus evil in many ways. In my opinion, he shows good versus evil by writing about how Dr. Jekyll leaves everything to Mr. Hyde in his will. How his lawyer, Mr. Utterson, believes that if Mr. Hyde gains knowledge of this will, that he will soon grow impatient to inherit such things. Also, in my opinion, the description of Mr. Hyde given by Mr. Utterson portrays evil.\n\nDr Hyde Good Vs Evil Essay\n\n1108 Words | 5 Pages\n\nHyde’s death would be viewed as the end consequence of evil and good being teared\n\nDr. Jekyll Vs.

Hyde has gnarled hands. He is so small in stature that when the transformation occurs turning Jekyll into Hyde, the clothes on Jekyll 's body overwhelm Hyde. His face is unlike Jekyll 's in all respects.\n\nDr Jekyll And Mr Hyde Fog Analysis\n\n1094 Words | 5 Pages\n\nIn the novella of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, Stevenson uses the backdrop of utter darkness and fog in almost every scene to allude to the uncertainty, compulsiveness, and hidden mysterious that are in every aspect of human nature, demonstrated through the complex character that is Mr Hyde. The evilness that Stevenson believed every human possessed was thoroughly exemplified through Hydes actions in the story whether the reader noticed it or not. Symbolized through setting, the complete darkness was the uncertainty of Hydes physical appearance to who ever he encountered. Although his victims could feel his brutal cruelness through the vibe let out through those certain characters opposing senses besides sight.

The \"evil\", Mr. Hyde, being born of good, the evil deeds only present while the novel 's \"good,\" Dr. Jekyll is not, and the novel’s end, where Dr. Jekyll deciding to not let his darker half kill any longer and makes a decisive and sacrificial decision.

Dr. Jekyll was a good man and a good surgeon, doctor, and scientist, but he was not without his own vices and set of foreboding dark impulses. These he found a hassle to deal with and also big troubles.\n\nWhy Does Jekyll Create Hyde\n\n702 Words | 3 Pages\n\n“Hyde” is just Jekyll, having transformed his body into something unrecognizable\".

Mr. Hyde ran over a young girl late into the night without feeling any guilt. Robert Louis Stevenson shows the archetypal theme of good and evil exists in all people in the novella The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll And Mr. Hyde. Good and evil exist in all people and we struggle with these two forces. This is shown through Jekyll because he is good with a little bad in him, this is also shown through Hyde, who is evil with some good, and it is lastly shown with the lab because it brings good and evil into Jekyll’s life.\n\nJekyll and Mr. Hyde” because the story takes place in Victorian England we see that the characters have no room for expression of emotions or violence. Everything they do is secret, so the more Dr Jekyll is repressed, the more he wants to be Mr Hyde.
