        "text": "In this essay, I explore the hypothesis that in The Mysterious Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde by Robert Louis Stevenson, Dr. Jekyll is the real source of evil in the story. I look at two critical texts for evidence to support or disagree with this. One of these is by Marte B. Sørensen (2012) and the other is by Suhbh M. Singh and Subho Chakrabarti (2008). I start by unpacking what evil is, or at least what evil is within the context of the novel.\n\nFirst, the question of the nature of evil is central to the story. Sørensen says that the novel is obsessed with “the struggle between good and evil, and in turn what it is that embodies these two phrases — what does it mean to be good and what does it mean to be evil?” (Sørensen, M. B. 2012)\n\nBut although she doesn’t really define clearly what evil is, she does acknowledge that it is something that exists within each of us as a kind of potential:\n\n​​“the evil” — this often abstract, unspecific something that makes the outside world so frightening, is the same barbarity that lies dormant within us, with the potential to awaken and rise from the depths and make us capable of this evil that we fear in others and in the world (Sørensen, 2012).\n\nSingh and Chakrabarti (2008) defer to Christianity and say that “evil is the necessary limitation of finite created beings and is a consequence of creation of beings possessed by free will.” (Singh, S. M., & Chakrabarti, S. 2008). This is also not a workable definition either, but both offer some insights. To incorporate the views of Sørensen (2012) and Singh and Chakrabarti (2008), I would say that evil is a potential that exists within all humans, who are creatures of God with free will. But more specifically, I consider evil to be the opposite of good or the absence of good. To be evil is for a human being to be wicked, to cause harm and misfortune to others and to be morally bad.\n\nWith that in mind as a definition of evil, the next point I’d like to explore is the question of whether Dr. Jekyll is evil or not. Sørensen suggests that Dr. Jekyll is not evil in her comments:\n\nDr. Jekyll seems to have gone into this experiment in the professional mindset of a doctor, meaning that he, as a professional, has a certain code of conduct and a moral obligation to uphold, and is granted a certain trust in return. Therefore I do not believe that he means to hurt anyone with his experiment, but that he rather wants to push the boundaries of science, to see if it is possible to separate man’s two identities so he can be free of all moral responsibility (Sørensen, 2012)\n\nOn the surface, the text of the novel seems to support this idea that Dr Jeckyl is not actually evil, but just pursuing science and his own studies. For example, we know that Jekyll was interested in exploring what was going on in his own head in terms of his own desires and suffering:\n\nAnd it chanced that the direction of my scientific studies, which led wholly towards the mystic and the transcendental, reacted and shed a strong light on this consciousness of perennial war among my members (p.42).\n\nSørensen doesn’t believe that Dr. Jekyll wanted to cause harm. She says that as he is a doctor, he is bound by certain ethics that require him to do no harm. Because of this, she believes that we can trust Dr Jekyll.\n\nHe even is professional enough to conduct the experiment on himself and, not initially, harm anyone for his own experimental purposes, or perhaps he just wants to keep the workings of his experiment secret in case it should work. Jekyll seems to believe that his experiment if it works, will also benefit those who share his secret pleasures, but like him cannot indulge in them for fear of public exposure (Sørensen, 2012)\n\nSørensen also appears to believe that Dr Jekyll did the experiment not just because he wanted to act on his own selfish desires without consequence but also because perhaps he wanted to help other people like him with selfish and sinful desires.\n\nHowever, Singh and Chakrabarti disagree. They believe that Jekyll always had this evil within him and knew it at least on a subconscious level:\n\nDr. Jekyll covertly provides utterance to the evil in his soul by various unspeakable acts, but is afraid of doing so openly because of the fear of social criticism. In the course of his experiments, he succeeds in producing a concoction that enables him to free this evil in him from the control of his good self, thus giving rise to Edward Hyde (Singh, & Chakrabarti, S. 2008)\n\nThey do make a mention of a “good” in Jekyll but they brush over it as they explain that whatever good Jekyll does have it gets quickly consumed by the evil within him, the evil that gets birthed into the person of Mr Hyde.\n\nIn the novel, Stevenson creates a hero in Dr. Jekyll, who aware of the evil in his own being, and sick of the duplicity in his life, succeeds by way of his experiments on himself in freeing the pure evil part of his being as Mr. Hyde, so that each can indulge in a life unfettered by the demands of the other (Singh, & Chakrabarti, S. 2008)\n\nAgain Singh and Chakrabarti see Jekyll as aware of his own evil and sick desires. They suggest that he becomes fed up with the effort of living as a good moral man and fighting these dark desires. So he frees the pure evil part of himself and lets it run wild.\n\nIt may be the case that Jekyll and Hyde cannot live without one other. Perhaps, the experiment was irreversible and now they need each other to survive. But if Singh and Chakrabarti are correct there is no balance between good and evil and they will always be at war with each other.\n\nSo perhaps they were doomed as soon as Dr. Jekyll convinced himself to do the experiment, convincing himself that if he could only act on his dark desires then he would be able to function as a better human being. Singh and Chakrabarti seem to believe that Jekyll is responsible for his own fate.\n\nI agree with Singh and Chakrabarti regarding the idea that Jekyll is responsible for his own actions. But I also believe that Jekyll is responsible for Hyde’s actions too, as Mr. Hyde is still a part of Dr. Jekyl, whether through a deforming medical experiment or just as repressed and unknown desires. Hyde was always a part of Dr. Jekyll, Dr. Jekyll only gave him a name and allowed him to come forth but they are one.\n\nI feel like the original text lines up with this as well. For example:\n\nTo cast in my lot with Jekyll, was to die to those appetites which I had long secretly indulged and had of late begun to pamper. To cast it in with Hyde, was to die to a thousand interests and aspirations, and to become, at a blow and for ever, despised and friendless. The bargain might appear unequal; but there was still another consideration in the scales; for while Jekyll would suffer smartingly in the fires of abstinence, Hyde would be not even conscious of all that he had lost. (Stevenson, 2014/1886, p. 48).\n\nI feel that this quote above illustrates perfectly how Jekyll addresses the fact that the two sides of himself. It seems clear to me that respectable Dr Jekyll and criminal Mr Hyde were both a part of the protagonist. He could not have one without the other.\n\nNow in the text, Dr Jekyll also seems to be referring to himself and Mr Hyde as two other separate people and himself in the third person. This to me feels like our narrator has now become a third character, instead of being Henry Jekyll.\n\nAt the start, I thought it was the case that it was morally ambiguous whether Jekyll was really evil. However, now I’m not so sure. Also, having spent some time reading the critical texts and reflecting on the primary I feel as though I’ve discovered a new character within the text — the narrator at the end of the book. Next, I explore each of these briefly in terms of how they relate to the thesis.\n\nFirst of all, is the issue of whether it’s morally ambiguous whether Jekyll was really evil or not. In the beginning, I was inconclusive about whether or not Jekyll was the true source of evil. For example here is Jekyll talking about Hyde who seems to have the same dilemma.\n\nBut his love of me is wonderful; I go further: I, who sicken and freeze at the mere thought of him, when I recall the abjection and passion of this attachment, and when I know how he fears my power to cut him off by suicide, I find it in my heart to pity him. (Stevenson, 2014/1886, p. 53).\n\nJekyll doesn’t hate Hyde even though he finds Hyde repulsive. While there are a lot of greys I think Hyde is Jekyll therefore Jekyll himself is the source of true evil. Yes, Jekyll was a good man, a law-abiding citizen of society of which everyone seemed to like. But he made Hyde, and he is responsible for Hyde’s actions as well as his own. Because even though the separation between the two becomes more apparent in each chapter, Hyde was always a part of Jeykll, just waiting to come out. For example, here we see Jeykll acknowledging Hyde inside him before Hyde was even created.\n\nHence it came about that I concealed my pleasures; and that when I reached years of reflection, and began to look round me and take stock of my progress and position in the world, I stood already committed to a profound duplicity of life. (Stevenson, 2014/1886, p. 41).\n\nThis is important to the thesis as well because it’s confirming my hypothesis that Jekyll is evil and the true source of evil. Here is further support for this:\n\nI knew myself, at the first breath of this new life, to be more wicked, tenfold more wicked sold as a slave to my original evil; and the thought, in that moment, braced and delighted me like wine (Stevenson, 2014/1886, p. 43).\n\nThe second discovery I made was that at the end of the story Jekyll and Hyde aren’t the only two characters inside Jekyll’s body. Jekyll turns into three people — the narrator, Jekyll and Hyde. This narrator character is only found in the last chapter of the book, “Henry Jekyll’s Full Statement of the Case”. Henry Jekyll has become so detached from himself that a third person has been created as well as Hyde. He hides from us among the pages and words but he is there.\n\nIf we return to my first quote from the primary text we can see the clearest evidence of this third person, the narrator appearing when he — the narrator — refers to both Jekyll and Hyde and himself as “I” all in the same two sentences:\n\nTo cast in my lot with Jekyll, was to die to those appetites which I had long secretly indulged and had of late begun to pamper. To cast it in with Hyde, was to die to a thousand interests and aspirations, and to become, at a blow and forever, despised and friendless. (Stevenson, 2014/1886, p. 48).\n\nThis is not the only place where he does this:\n\nAnd hence, as I think, it came about that Edward Hyde was so much smaller, slighter and younger than Henry Jekyll (Stevenson, 2014/1886, p. 44).\n\nTo sum up, I do not believe we can trust Jekyll as Sørensen believes we can. Although I do agree with Sørensen on the part that Jekyll may not have wanted to cause people harm to start with. But Hyde did cause harm and in doing so it hurt other people. Therefore, Jekyll did cause harm and broke his vow as a doctor.\n\nNext, I agree with Singh and Chakrabarti on both the idea that Jekyll is responsible for Hyde’s actions as well as his own. But also on the idea that Jekyll always had this evil inside of him, that Jekyll is Hyde, whether through suppressed desires or a physical transformation.\n\nFinally, in terms of my own conclusions, I think that Dr Jekyll is the source of evil in The Mysterious Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde. Jekyll, as a human being created by God with free will, is wicked because ultimately his actions, even in the persona of Hyde and regardless of the advances of science, cause harm and misfortune to others including murder. This makes him evil in the sense of being morally bad as per my definition in the introduction. Jekyll is a killer and he can’t hide this in Hyde.\n\nFurthermore, it’s hidden in plain sight. Perhaps, the key is in their names (Je-kyll and Hyde) and in the title of the book. Jekyll wants to kill and he hides it in Hyde. Both Singh and Chakrabarti and the primary text support my hypothesis that Dr Henry Jekyll is the real source of evil and support the idea that in fact, he is intoxicated by this. I also discovered that through Dr Jekyll’s separation of himself from himself and Hyde, he gives birth to a third character who I have dubbed the Narrator.\n\nBibliography\n\nSingh, S.
