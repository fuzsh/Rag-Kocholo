        "text": "Robert Louis Stevenson’s Novella “The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde”, good vs. evil is the biggest theme. This story is seen as a metaphor about the good and evil in everyone, and the struggle of the two sides in everyone’s personality. Since Hyde starts to take over, I could argue that evil is stronger than good. But, Mr. Hyde ends up dying in the end of the story, so I could claim that the good of someone can overcome the evil in you. Overall, Stevenson is trying to communicate with the reader about the balance of good and evil in humans, also that your balance of good and evil has different results/effects in your life.\n\nOne of the most vital concepts incorporated into The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde is the representation and depiction of the duality of mankind. Jekyll works to find a solution which will separate him into his reckless, immoral persona and his respectable, Victorian self. After consumption, this potion causes him to completely transform into a man who is known as Hyde. As Hyde, he can express himself in immoral, evil ways. This not only includes moral and immoral wants but rational and irrational wants. Not only does this transformation enable him to keep his good reputation even while he does horrid, unacceptable things, but it allows him to do things which he most likely would not even\n\nThe Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, by Robert Louis Stevenson is meant to be interpreted as an allegory. Although the story by itself is immensely entertaining, its symbolism is where the novella truly shines. This is a story of temptation. In Dr. Jekyll’s confession, the doctor declares that after two months without Mr. Hyde, he started to become “tortured with throes and longings” to transform into his counterpart Mr. Hyde (Stevenson 55). Consequently, Dr. Jekyll states that he “fell before the assaults of temptation” because he gave in to his mind’s desires and transformed into Mr. Hyde (Stevenson 57). Another important piece of information that contributes toward Stevenson’s allegory in the novella is the fact that Henry Jekyll\n\n“His Master Hyde, if he were studied,\" thought he, \"must have secrets of his own; black secrets, by the look of him; secrets compared to which poor Jekyll's worst would be like sunshine.” (Stevenson 11). Though Dr. Jekyll is seen as the perfect man he still has his flaws, he knows no happiness. Jekyll did all he could to bring joy into his life, but was always let down by not truly experiencing it. As an act to try to find happiness he created an alter ego, Hyde, whom brings him happiness along with many troubles.\n\nThe theme of the existence of good and evil in every human being is prevalent throughout the story. Stevenson highlights this idea by describing Jekyll and Hyde’s disparity in terms of action and personality. Dr. Jekyll, unbeknownst of Utterson, had created a potion that gave him the power to split his good and evil self into two separate beings. However, it only created Hyde, the evil of the two without the creation of the good, angelic being. With the eventual discovery of this, Utterson was clarified of the plethora of mysteries that encumbered him.\n\nHowever one night, Jekyll went to sleep and awoke as Hyde. Jekyll decides to stop taking the potion because he thought he might become trapped in Hyde’s form forever. In these few months without the potion, “He came out of his seclusion, renewed relations with his friends, became once more their familiar guest and entertainer; and whilst he had always been known for charities, he was now no less distinguished for religion.” Pg.46. The absence of evil had benefited Jekyll greatly but temptation made the evil in Jekyll grow again as he finally caved in and took the potion.\n\nThe Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde by Robert Louis Stevenson represents the battle between the intelligent and rational self and the irrational and animalistic self. The novel serves as a reminder of how all humans have some sort of darkness that is deeply rooted within them, all they have to do is release it from its hiding place. The story focuses on a man, Dr. Jekyll, and his descent into madness while turning into Mr. Hyde late at night and committing atrocious crimes. The dual nature of human mentality, embodied by the evil of Mr. Hyde and the good of Dr. Jekyll, shows the battle, which rages within an individual.\n\nThe Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde is a novella set in a more extreme version of the Victorian era which is littered with violence and over-the-top depictions of dual personality disorder (now known as dissociative identity disorder). This over-the-top depiction of the early struggles of the Victorian era (the inability of the masses to understand the inner conflict between benevolence and malevolence) led to the novella’s suspenseful, thrilling and exciting nature, which resulted to it being one of the greatest works of art. Robert Louis Stevenson focuses the spotlight on various characters whose sole purpose is to epitomize the concept of dual personality.\n\nFrom Hyde’s control and Jekyll’s lack or rather a complete absence of control over Hyde, Hyde can commit acts of murder and other misdeeds. In that absence of good, usually provided by Jekyll, Hyde thrives and can do anything he wants. Even in the very first moments of their separation, Hyde displays his new-found control by affecting Jekyll’s body. “Evil, … had left on that body an imprint of deformity and decay” (Stevenson X, 78). From this declaration from Jekyll’s own confession, Hyde is proven to have had control over Jekyll to affect even the body after the first dosage of Jekyll’s cocktail of drugs.\n\nJekyll and Mr. Hyde evokes an emotional and sympathetic response for the inner battles Dr. Jekyll endures when he is bombarded by the invasive and disturbing thoughts of his alternate personality, Mr. Hyde because it reminds the reader of the overwhelming feelings all human undergo in some point or time in their life, were confusion, unhappiness, and fear of unacceptable creates a vortex of for psychological anguish. • Find a passage from the text to highlight their differences Descriptions of both Jekyll and Hyde A major theme of this novella is the danger of introspection and social awareness, which can be understood through an analysis of Freud’s structural model of the human psyche, pertaining specifically/exclusively to the Id, Ego, and Superego. Irrefutably, Hyde is guilty of evil acts, however one of his trademarks throughout the novella is his aggression and indifference to the expectations and limitations of society. Therefore, this novel, especially considering the historical context, that being during the Victorian era can reflect of the overbearing social expectation to behave properly in society and that specifically in Victorian society citizens were expected to repress these arguably\n\nHe enjoys becoming this different person and doing mischievous things including killing people. Utterson says how Hyde killed some people, but he was not put under the spotlight for those murders until Sir Danvers (a high ranked man) was found dead. After a few times of becoming this monster, Jekyll should have realized what was happening and should have stopped his intake on the drink, but he did not. Instead, he continues to become this Mr. Hyde and in doing so Dr. Jekyll is intending to become this dreadful creature and bring or cause harm to other people. Dr. Jekyll’s other personality shows just how sick of a man Jekyll is on the inside. Soon, however, the evil side of Dr. Jekyll becomes more dominant and starts to get harder and harder to “put him away”. The letter that Jekyll wrote to Utterson and Lanyon stated, “Here then, as I lay down the pen and proceed to seal up my confession, I bring the life of that unhappy Henry Jekyll to an end.” The letter is not a farewell letter to let them both know he is going to be killed, but to let them know that Hyde’s personality is now in charge instead of Jekyll’s."
