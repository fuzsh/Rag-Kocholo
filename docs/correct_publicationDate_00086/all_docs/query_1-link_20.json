        "text": "“Man is not truly one, but truly two,” —Robert Louis Stevenson, The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde A book so iconic that its title is synonymous with split personalities, The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde by Scottish author Robert Louis Stevenson, was first released in 1886. The story of a virtuous Dr. Jekyll who mistakenly creates an alter ego of unadulterated evil serves as an examination of the duality of human nature and the battle between good and evil. Full of mystery and fright, this story has remained popular for more than a century and has been adapted countless times—over 132 in film alone.\n\nISBN: 9781626862555\n\nFlexibound: 304 pages.\n\nSize: 7.8\" x 5.3\" x 0.9\""
