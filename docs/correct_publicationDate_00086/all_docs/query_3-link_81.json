        "text": "Story of the Door. Mr Utterson was a very serious lawyer who rarely smiled. He forgave others who drank a great deal. He was a capable man who had good natured friendships. One of which was with Mr Richard Enfield. They had many things in common. They came upon a derelict shop-house without windows and discoloured walls. The door was stained badly. Mr Enfield admitted the door brought back some memories. He saw a man trample over a girl when they collided with one another some time ago. The man was like a Juggernaut. The girl’s family came to the girl’s rescue. The doctor was present as well. Everyone there seemed to hate the doctor. The man entered the door and extracted some money. The cheque provided was genuine. Apart from that incident, no one has been seen entering or exiting the house. Utterson wanted to know who walked over the child. Mr Hyde was the one. He had a deformity somewhere which made me very displeasing to the eye. It was Mr Hyde who entered the house to withdraw the money to pay the child’s family. Mr Hyde used a key to enter the house. Utterson and Richard vowed not to talk of this case again.\n\nSearch for Mr. Hyde. Mr Utterson was at home on a Sunday evening for dinner. That night, he examined Dr Jekyll’s will, which he kept in his business room. He was in charge of lending assistance to making the will. If anything happened to Dr Jekyll, the money would be transferred to Edward Hyde. This document offended Mr Utterson. Mr Utterson went to seek his friend Dr Lanyon. They thoroughly enjoyed each other’s company. Dr Lanyon and Dr Jekyll used to be friends until Dr Jekyll’s mind went wrong. They couldn’t agree on Science. Lanyon had never heard of Hyde. Utterson wanted to find out more and was not satisfied by what he knew. He wanted to see Hyde face-to-face. Since then, Utterson kept spying at the door to see whether there was any movement in or out. One night, Utterson spotted a small man entering the door via a key. Mr Utterson stopped him before he entering and started chatting with him. He was indeed Mr Hyde. Utterson managed to see his face and obtained Hyde’s address. Hyde seemed dwarfish and Utterson could not explain why he was hated so much. Now, Utterson went to Jekyll’s house. Unfortunately, Jekyll wasn’t at home. Mr Hyde often frequent the laboratory. Something must have spurred Dr Jekyll to want to work on Hyde. There were numerous strange clauses to the Will.\n\nDr Jekyll was Quite at Ease. Jekyll and Utterson finally met face-to-face. Jekyll termed Lanton a ‘blatant pedant’. Utterson has never approved of the Will. Jekyll was indeed a very handsome man. Jekyll admitted that he took a great interest in Hyde. Jekyll wanted Utterson to approve his Will. Utterson agreed to it.\n\nIt can make no change. You do not understand my position. I am painfully situated, Utterson; my position is a very strange – a very strange one. It is one of those affairs that cannot be mended by talking. – Dr Jekyll\n\nThe Carew Murder Case. A year later, London was shocked by a murder of an old gentleman by Mr Hyde. Mr Hyde kept clubbing a man whom he was talking peacefully just moments ago. The maid witnessed all this and called the police. The murder was indeed very gruesome. On the victim, there was a purse and gold watch and also a sealed envelope addressed to Mr Utterson. Sir Danvers Carew was the victim. Mr Hyde was not at home when Utterson and the police officer wanted to visit. The police inspector wanted to inspect his rooms. The decoration in the rooms were very posh and luxurious in nature. The room was very messy and appeared to be ransacked recently. It seemed like Hyde killed the man for his money. Hyde was a fugitive now.\n\nIncident of the Letter. Utterson now visited the laboratory of Jekyll’s. Mr Jekyll knew about the murder case and didn’t want to talk to Hyde again. But he knew that Hyde was safe in hiding. Jekyll gave Utterson a letter which was sealed. The letter was written by Hyde. In the letter, Hyde assured Jekyll that he had a safe means of escaping. There was a risk that Hyde would murder Jekyll some day and stand to inherit everything. Jekyll was solemn and sad in appearance now. Mr Guest was the head clerk. The writing on the letter did seem odd and Utterson questioned the clerk about it. The handwriting on the first letter and the invitation to dinner letter had an uncanny resemblance. A thought came to Utterson’s mind ‘Henry Jekyll forged for a murderer!’\n\nI cannot say that I care what becomes of Hyde; I am quite done with him. I was thinking of my own character, which this hateful business has rather exposed. – Jekyll\n\nIncident of Dr Lanyon. The death was now resented as a public injury. Mr Hyde was now in hiding. Many people started uncovering his horrible past. Dr Jekyll was a nice man now and started mixing more with his friends. Lanyon aged visibly over a short period of time and it was starling. Lanyon declared himself a doomed man. Jekyll was ill too. Jekyll also didn’t want to see Utterson now. Jekyll wrote to Utterson and requested him to respect the silence and the fact that he didn’t want to meet Lanyon. Dr Lanyon died a fortnight later. Utterson unveiled a letter than Lanyon sent him. However after the first envelope, in it lay another, which read that the envelope shall not be opened till Jekyll’s disappearance or death.\n\nIncident at the Window. Utterson and Enfield were talking now. The door was actually a back way to Jekyll’s house. Suddenly, Utterson managed to catch Jekyll. He was very sad indeed. He looked in horror and despair. Both men were pale after this encounter.\n\nThe Last Night. There was something wrong with Jekyll. Poole was his servant and he admitted that Jekyll liked to hide in the cabinet and do nothing. Poole suspected some foul play. He brought Utterson to the middle of the pavement. He entered a door. They entered a hall which was brightly lit. Poole brought him to the surgical theatre. The voice in the door said he cannot see anyone at the present moment. Jekyll’s voice seemed changed. The butler thought it was strange that he didn’t know who was in the cabinet. There was something in the cabinet. Dr Jekyll kept rejecting impure chemicals for his research. They examined a letter with the doctor’s handwriting. Dr Jekyll had a mask over his face and was crying like a rat. The master hiding in the cabinet did not seem to be Jekyll. The plan was to break into the cabinet to find out who it was. Could the creature be Hyde instead? Now, they suspected that Dr Jekyll had been murdered. Once, the butler heard the creature weeping. It was indeed Hyde’s voice. Poole swung the axe against the cabinet. Finally, the lock burst. There was a good fire in the cabinet that was still on-going. There was a body of a man who was contorted and twitching. It was Edward Hyde. There was a crushed phial in his hand. Hyde was in ruins. It was now time to find Jekyll’s body. The two men searched the rest of the house. Hyde was almost dead now. The lawyer unsealed the envelope found in the business table. In the will, in place of Edward Hyde, the lawyer’s name was to be beneficiary instead. The letter was written by Jekyll and it instructed Utterson to read the narrative that Lanyon wrote. Jekyll was in hiding now. Utterson would call for the police shortly. Now, Utterson had two narratives, one by Lanyon and the other by Jekyll.\n\nDr Lanyon’s Narrative. Jekyll did write to Lanyon previously on 9 Jan. He instructed Lanyon to extract some chemicals and a paper book to Cavendish Square. The next task would be to pass it to someone else in the cabinet. This would be all. The two above steps was necessary to save Jekyll from more harm. Lanyon felt obliged to follow the instructions. I (Lanyon) took a revolver with me in case I needed to defend myself. I found Hyde. Hyde was dressed in clothing that was way too big for him. Hyde was expecting the chemicals from me. Hyde lunged at the chemicals. He started mixing the chemicals and it gave off a bright glow. Later, he drank it. After drinking, Hyde behaved hysterically again. After he drank it, he looked like Henry Jekyll. I was completely shaken in disbelief.\n\nHenry Jekyll’s Full Statement of the Case. I was born from a rich family and had a bright future. I reflected hard on life. I suffered from a split personality. It came to my realization, from my research, that man was two. In the past, I only advanced on the moral side, and not the intellectual side. Now, I see the duality of man. I always wanted to separate the two elements. I could create a creature that were the stamp of lower elements in my soul. It was to be a very risky experiment and I was very wary of it. One day, I needed to make the potion and drank it. Then I felt younger and lighter and happier in being. But I realized that the experiment caused me to be much shorter and uglier. I was now Edward Hyde. It all seemed so real. Edward Hyde was pure evil. Later on, I drank the potion again and was converted back to Dr Jekyll. I now had two characters as well as two appearances. I wrote the will to make it seem that there were two different people being present. I could simply commit crimes and then drink the potion and transform to Jekyll again. However, I could not clean my conscience for the crimes that Hyde committed. Later on, the experiment went awry and I was deeply frightened. I went to bed as Henry Jekyll but woke up as Edward Hyde. I needed to hide my appearance from my servants. I gradually found it harder to return to the appearance of Jekyll but it was easier to remain as Hyde. Evil was creeping inside of me. Later on, I resolved to take the form of Jekyll and tried to make good all the crime I committed. However, the evil was too overpowering and I succumbed to it. I ended up taking the form of Edward Hyde without consuming the chemicals when I was outside the home. Now, I needed to reach for my chemicals in the lab without getting caught. I thought of using Lanyon. The good thing about taking my other form was that I could still write like Jekyll. I concluded that it was impure chemicals that caused the experiment to be so unstable. I sought for pure chemicals. In half an hour, I would turn into Hyde again and this time it would be permanent. Now, I bring the life of unhappy Henry Jekyll to an end.\n\nIf each, I told myself, could be housed in separate identities, life would be relived of all that was unbearable; the unjust might go his way, delivered from the aspirations and remorse of his more upright twin; and the just could walk steadfastly and securely on his upward path, doing the good things in which he found his pleasure, and no longer exposed to disgrace and penitence by the hands of this extraneous evil. – Dr Jekyll\n\nTrunchbull (bitchy and mean) ordered Matilda to stand up. She wanted her placed behind bars. She was in a rage. Matilda did not deserve this.\n\nStand up, you disgusting little cockroach! You filthy little maggot! You are a vile, repellent, malicious little brute! – Trunchbull to Matilda\n\nIt’s a funny thing about mothers and fathers. Even when their own child is the most disgusting little blister you could ever imagine, they still think that he or she is wonderful. Some parents go further. They become so blinded by adoration they manage to convince themselves their child has qualities of genius. – Roald Dahl\n\nMatilda was an ugly girl. The parents who don’t care are much worse. Mr and Mrs Wormwood had a son named Michael and a daughter named Matilda. They thought she was scab. They wanted to flick her away if possible. However, she was a brilliant kid with a nimble mind. She had a broken leg. She could speak by age 1.5, read at 3, and memorize facts at 4. Her parents dismissed her as being a chatterbox. Her parents wanted her to watch television instead of read. Mrs Wormwood was hooked on bingo. Matilda visited the library herself as her parents won’t get her books. Every day, she headed to the library to read. Her favorite book from the library was Secret Garden. Matilda finished all the children’s books. Over the next 6 months, she read many books. Nickolas Nickleby, Oliver Twist, Jane Eyre, Pride and Prejudice, Tess of the D’Urbervilles, Gone to Earth, Kim, The Invisible Man, The old man and the sea, the sound and fury, the grapes of wrath, the good companions, brighton rock, animal farm. Mrs Phelps, the librarian, told her that she could borrow books too. Now, she visited the library only once a week. The books brought her to amazing places.\n\nHer dad dealt with second-hand cars. His dad liked to condemn her. They treated the son more favorably. Her dad used sawdust to make the engine run smoothly for a while. He also tempered with the speedometer so that it would appear that the car was not used much. Her brother was learning from his dad. Matilda hated this sort of cheating. Her dad liked to eat and watch telly at the same time. Matilda was boiling. Now, she wanted to think of plans to get back at them.\n\nShe knew it was wrong to hate her parents like this, but she was finding it very hard not to do so. All the reading she had done had given her a view of life that they had never seen. – Roald Dahl\n\nShe got hold of her dad’s hat which he wore to work. She applied superglue around its rim. Mr Wormwood didn’t want to get his skin off and he left the hat on. Matilda looked at him with innocent eyes. The hat would not budge and Mr Wormwood left it on. It was extremely difficult to lie on the pillow. Mrs Wormwood cut it off from his head. However, some brown patches couldn’t be removed and it looked like lice.\n\nNow, Mr Wormwood lost his taste for bullying. However, he soon started again. He blared the tv set in front of her. However, Matilda continued reading her book. He started ripping the book into shreds. He seemed jealous and all. Matilda was planning to get back at them. Fred was her friend. He was 6. Fred lent his parrot to Matilda for a day. It appeared to the family that a burglar was present after the parrot said ‘Hullo!’ Matilda pretended to search the house but there was no one. She proclaimed that it was a ghost and everyone fled the house.\n\nShe seemed to know that neither crying nor sulking every got anyone anywhere. The only sensible thing to do when you are attacked is, as Napoleon once said, to counter-attack. – Roald Dahl\n\nNow, Matilda’s life was slightly better. Her parent’s behavior was slowly improving. His dad tested Michael to calculate how much he made for the week. When her brother was calculating, Matilda shouted the answer. When she got the answer right, her dad accused her of stealing glances at his calculation.\n\nHer dad used the oil of violets hair tonic. Matilda opened the bottle and filled it up with platinum blond hair eye extra strong. When her mum was serving breakfast, she was shocked at the sight of Mr Wormwood’s hair. The hair looked awful to say the least. Peroxide might remove all his hair in the near future and Mr Wormwood was upset. He desperately called for a hairdresser to dye his hair black.\n\nShe started school late because her parents were not concerned about her education. She went to Crunchem Hall Primary School. The head of the school was Miss Trunchbull. Her teacher was Miss Honey. The students seemed to like her due to her warm personality. Trunchbull was a terror, akin to a monster. Matilda impressed the teacher when she could recite the 2*multiplication table. Miss Honey was extremely impressed by Matilda. Matilda even knew the 12* multiplication table. The other students were worried. She could not explain how she managed this feat. Now, Miss Honey wanted to see if students could read entire sentences. Matilda could and she had an extraordinary command of the language. Matilda wrote a limerick of Ms Jenny Honey. Miss Honey was impressed with her limerick. Matilda taught herself to read.\n\nMiss Honey realized she shouldn’t belong in that class. Mr Wormwood sold Trunchbull a car. Mr Wormwood mentioned that Matilda was a brat. Trunchbull accused Matilda of placing a stink-bomb under her desk Miss Trunchbull refused to allow her to fast track to those students who were 11. Miss Honey left the room. She vowed to help Matilda in some way possible.\n\nMs Honey got Matilda more difficult textbooks and she was allowed to read them in class. Matilda was absorbed in the book now. Miss Honey wanted to chat with her parents. Late one evening, Ms Honey headed over to the Wormwood’s house. Mr Wormwood didn’t want to let her in because he was watching a TV programme. Her parents were very rude. Ms Honey started to probe into her family’s background. Mr Wormwood didn’t want to send her to university. Matilda was smart enough to enter one. Miss Honey was angry and she left. It was obvious her parents didn’t heed her advice and the meeting was futile.\n\nA girl doesn’t get a man by being brainy. – Mrs Wormwood\n\nMatilda was humble and didn’t show off her brilliance. Her classmates liked her. Her good friend was Lavender, who was gutsy and adventurous. Hortensia began to educate them about how to survive in the school. He warned them of the cupboard where they would get punished. Hortensia was placed in the Chokey because of his misdemanors and transgressions. Matilda and Lavender were highly entertained by Hortensia. It was like a war between the students and Trunchbull. Trunchbull threw the hammer during the Olympics. She flung a student outside the room. Trunchbull couldn’t stand pigtails. Amanda had pigtails. Trunchbull ordered her to cut them off by tomorrow. She started spinning her and threw her.\n\nParents wouldn’t believe that Ms Trunchbull would throw students and that was her secret. Bruce Bogtrotter was ordered on the stage in front of the whole school. He was accused of stealing a chocolate cake from her. She brought a huge cake on the table and offered it to Bruce. Everyone thought that it was a trap. Ms Trunchbull kept insisting that he eat it. He was ordered to finish the entire cake now. Everyone would wait for him to finish. Bruce couldn’t take it anymore and proclaimed he would get sick. Bruce refused to give up and kept eating. Everyone cheered when he finished the cake. The Trunchbull was motionless and was in shock. Now, she crashed the china platter on top of his head. The kid won her.\n\nNo, I don’t think Ms Trunchbull’s mad. But she’s very dangerous. Being in this school is like being in a cage with a cobra. You have to be very fast on your feet. – Matilda\n\nThe headmistress would take over one period each week. Miss Honey would just be the witness. Lavender was in charge of filling up the jug with water before Trunchbull came. Lavender starting scheming. The newt was a slimy creature. She wanted to catch one from the pond. She placed it into a box. Lavender placed the newt in the jug full of water.\n\nTrunchbull entered the class. Nigel’s hands were filthy and Ms Trunchbull commented on them. She made him stand in the corner. Ms Trunchbull commented that Ms Honey’s teaching methods sucked. Rupert answered wrongly. She grabbed Rupert by his hair. She released him only when he said 2*7=14. Eric was grabbed by his ears as he was lifted from his chair. Ms Honey was defensive and said her methods could injure them. Matilda claimed that she read Nicholas Nickleby. Ms Trunchbull knew that Mr Wormwood was a crook. She thought that Matilda was crooked.\n\nSmall people should never be seen by anybody. They should be kept out of sight in boxes like hairpins and buttons I cannot for the life of me see why children have to take so long to grow up. I think they do it on purpose. – Ms Trunchbull\n\nI have never been able to understand why small children are so disgusting. They are the bane of my life. They are like insects. They should be got rid of as early as possible. We get rid of flies with fly-spray and by hanging up fly-paper. I have often thought of inventing a spray for getting rid of small children. – Ms Trunchbull\n\nShe wanted a school without children in them. Now, the newt entered the glass. She yelled and leapt off her chair. Trunchbull ordered Matilda to stand up. Matilda was angry because she was innocent. Matilda was ordered to shut up every time she plead her innocence. The newt jumped out of the glass and clung on to her chest. Matilda used the power of her eyes to tip the glass. Now, Trunchbull was angry and marched off. The culprit was let off, miraculously.\n\nMatilda wanted to share her experience with someone else. She confided in Miss Honey. Matilda admitted that she made the glass tip over. She controlled the glass with her eyes alone. Ms Honey wanted to test whether she could tip the glass over again. Matilda managed to re-perform the act in front of her. Ms Honey was dumbfounded. She invited Matilda for tea.\n\nA precocious child is one that shows amazing intelligence early on. You are an unbelievably precocious child. – Miss Honey\n\nMatilda was increasing excited. Matilda was a phenomenon. Ms Honey advised that she should tread carefully. Miss Honey lived alone in a farm-labourer’s cottage. She read poetry to Matilda and Matilda loved it. They entered her kitchen. Matilda went to fetch water from a well. Miss Honey was a poor woman. The room was as small a prison cell. Matilda wanted to uncover the mystery.\n\nMiss Honey was suddenly rigid after Matilda asked some personal questions. Matilda was the first visitor to her place after she moved in 2 years ago. Miss Honey was 23 years old and her dad was a doctor in the same village. Her mum passed away when she was 2. Her aunt took care of her when she was younger. Miss Honey hated her aunt. When she was 5, her dad died, apparently through suicide. Her life was a nightmare when her aunt took care of her. Miss Honey was shy and retiring. By 10, she was her aunt’s slave. She learned to accept orders at will and without question. She had no one to complain to. Ms Honey couldn’t go to University because her aunt wanted her to do the work. Miss Honey still channeled some of her pay to her aunt, due to fear. Miss Honey finally told her aunt that she found a place. She survived on 1 pound a week. She loved teaching. Her aunt was Miss Trunchbull. It was incredible and unbelievable.\n\nMiss Trunchbill brought her up. The both of them walked to Matilda’s house now. They promised not to reveal anything to others. Her dad was Magnus, Miss Trunchbull was Agatha, and she was Jenny.\n\nMatilda’s house was empty. She wanted to help Ms Honey. She started practicing moving a cigar and eventually it did. Now, she attempted to lift it. She succeeded in lifting it for 10 seconds. She was exhausted for all the mind control and fell asleep. Now, after much practice, she could make the cigar go wherever it wanted.\n\nTrunchbull entered the class and tested them on the multiplication table. Wilfred couldn’t answer her question. Now, she held him by his ankle. Nigel pointed to the chalk that was moving on its own. The chalk was writing something on the board. It spelt ‘Agatha’. ‘Agatha, this is Magnus. This is Magnus’ it said. ‘It is Magnus, and you’d better believe it.’ ‘Agatha, give my Jenny back her house.’ Ms Trunchbull was freaked out and in disbelief. ‘Give my Jenny her wages. Give my Jenny the house then get out of here. If you don’t I will come and get you. I will come and get you like you got me. I am watching you Agatha.’ Ms Trunchbull fell on the floor. She fainted. Nigel splashed cold water on her. All the teachers carried her to the sick room. Miss Honey gave Matilda a big hug before she left.\n\nMs Trunchbull recovered. However, she vacated Ms Honey’s home. Miss Honey would be the rightful recipient of her Red House. Magnus’ savings has also be willed to her. Now, Miss Honey moved back to the Red House. Ms Trunchbull did not return to the school anymore. Now, Matilda was advanced to a higher level but she lost her power to move objects. Matilda was happy as she didn’t want to be a miracle-worker. Matilda often visited Ms Honey nowadays and was very intriguing. They were never bored. Her parents were packing stuff into suitcases. Her family was planning to move to Spain. On learning this, Matilda ran to Miss Honey’s house. Miss Honey suspected that Mr Wormwood wanted to escape the law as he was doing illegal deeds in his day job. Matilda did not want to go with them. Matilda wanted desperately to stay with Miss Honey but she had to seek her parents’ approval. She ran with Ms Honey to her place. Both her parents agreed. Miss Honey and Matilda hugged each other and lived together happily!"
