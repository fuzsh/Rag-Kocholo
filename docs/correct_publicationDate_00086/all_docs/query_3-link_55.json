        "text": "Review by Natalia Weindel:\n\nMr. Utterson, a London lawyer, is concerned that his friend, Dr. Jekyll, has developed a relationship with an imperfect character named Mr. Hyde. This is because Hyde has been connected with several incidents of violence. Eventually Jekyll assures Utterson he’s cut off all communicatios with Hyde, but the mystery of Hyde’s ties to Jekyll persists, especially after Jekyll disappears.\n\nA few weeks ago, as a class we read The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. We also had to write a paper about who we though Hyde was.This is how I came to this conclusion:\n\nThis is a book I’d had no interest in reading, because it started out slow and, I didn’t have super-high hopes for it. I was proved incorrect, I loved Jekyll and Hyde, and this novel will definitely be on my list of favorite books of the year.\n\nRobert Louis Stevenson, had me from the very beginning of the story with his comparison of Mr.Utterson—a completely normal, moderate, and reasonable man, and that of his friend and distant relative, Mr. Enfield, a “well-known man about town”.\n\nStevenson sets us up for a story about the multiple sides of men’s characters for, if Utterson was completely mild-mannered and Enfield completely dissolute, how would they manage to enjoy one another’s company so much? Clearly there’s a little of Utterson in Enfield and vice versa.\n\nFittingly, it is through Enfield that the character of Hyde is introduced, seen in a corrupt part of town knocking over a little girl. Utterson also knows Hyde, because Hyde is mentioned in the will of , Dr. Jekyll. Like Utterson, Jekyll is an upstanding gentleman whose friends are “all intelligent, respectable men and all judges of good wine.” So what would Jekyll have to do with a demon like Hyde?\n\nObviously we all know the answer to that question, But the real issue of the story is why, or what would make Jekyll even create a way to seperate a part of his personality and then switch from one to the other?\n\nJekyll and Hyde was not what I was expecting based on the adaptations I’ve seen. It’s more of a detective story than a horror story, and neither Jekyll or Hyde are as good or bad as they’ve been seen to be. Is Hyde really evil, or is he just rude? He knocked over the girl by accident, and he did offer recompense to her family. It seems like Hyde’s demonic nature is more perception than reality; as soon as people see him, they hate, and despise him. According to Enfield:\n\n“I had taken a loathing to my gentleman at first sight. So had the child’s family, which was only natural. But the doctor’s case was what struck me. He was the usual cut-and-dry apothecary, of no particular age and colour, with a strong Edinburgh accent, and about as emotional as a bagpipe. Well, sir, he was like the rest of us; every time he looked at my prisoner, I saw that Sawbones turn sick and white with the desire to kill him.”\n\nHow else are people supposed to react when people treat them like that?\n\nJekyll wasn’t the clam shy physician I thought her was going to be, either: he’s a gentleman bachelor now, but it’s stated that in his youth he was “wild,” and there’s a certain “crookedness” about his face, As the book describes.\n\nIt’s for these reasons that I don’t see The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde as being a story of good or evil instead, it’s a cautionary story about conformity. Jekyll wants to be normal and to fit in with men who are respectable and smart, so he tries to remove the part of himself that is bad so they will not shun him if they knew about it. Whether it’s addiction, or a demon, Hyde represents whatever the people around him rejects. In Jekyll’s attempt to adjust to society’s definition of a gentleman doctor, so he tries to reject the part of himself that society finds disturbing, and in the process he destroys himself.\n\nThe Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde is one of those trickily novels, like the book Animal Farm, that we read in Pel class last year. They are both good stories and also makes you think. It’s accessible to people of all ages and can be read simply as a good story, a statement of Victorian society as a whole, or anywhere in between."
