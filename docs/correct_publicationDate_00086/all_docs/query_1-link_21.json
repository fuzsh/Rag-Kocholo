        "text": "This Top Five Classics illustrated edition of Robert Louis Stevenson’s The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde includes the original text, 19 illustrations by Charles Raymond Macauley from the 1904 edition, a brief introduction, and a detailed author bio and bibliography.\n\nDr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, first published in 1886, has been and remains one of the most well-known works of popular fiction in the English language, having spawned hundreds of dramatic adaptations and inspired countless other works—beginning with the first stage production less than a year after the original book was published. It is also one of the most widely translated works in English literature."
