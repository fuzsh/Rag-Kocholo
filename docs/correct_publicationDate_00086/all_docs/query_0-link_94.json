        "text": "Stevenson was a sickly child (he had serious lung problems) who read a great deal about travel and adventure. A combination of his love of adventure and ill health led him to spend many years as a writer travelling the world in search of a climate that was healthier than Britain's.\n\nIn 1890, he went to live in the remote Samoan Islands in the South Pacific. He died there in 1894 at the age of 44."
