        "text": "Robert Louis Stevenson (1850-1894) was a British author and poet of the late nineteenth century. Born in Edinburgh, and named at birth Robert Lewis Balfour Stevenson, to lighthouse engineer Thomas Stevenson, and his mother Margaret Isabella Balfour Stevenson, in 1850, Stevenson was a sickly child, often confined to home and the stories of his nurse Alison Cunningham (or “Cummie”). Cummie was hired as his nurse in 1852, and remained in the Stevensons’ employ until 1872. She was a strict Calvinist, and would often feed the young Louis’s imagination with stories of Old Testament horror and retribution. Stevenson demonstrated a capacity not only to remember these stories, but to create stories of his own.\n\nIn 1857, the family moved from 8 Howard Place to 17 Heriot Row, and Louis would begin school in India Street, sporadically at first due to ill health. Throughout his life he suffered from what may have been tubercular disease, no doubt exacerbated by the city air and cold climate of Edinburgh. After attending Edinburgh Academy, he entered Edinburgh University in 1867, initially as an engineering student (to satisfy his father’s wishes), but ultimately in 1870 as a law student. He reached a compromise with his father that instead of pursuing a professional writing career, he would instead study the law. He passed his exams and was called to the Scottish Bar in 1875, which was his final barrier to adult independence.\n\nHe celebrated this independence by leaving Edinburgh for a canoe tour of France along the river Oise in 1876 with his friend Walter Simpson; this trip would be recorded in the travelogue An Inland Voyage, Stevenson’s first book-length publication, published by Kegan Paul in 1878 with a title-page illustration by the famous illustrator Walter Crane. This was followed in 1879 by Travels with a Donkey in the Cevennes, also published by Kegan Paul and illustrated by Crane. These books, combined with a growing list of well-received essays published in The Cornhill, and his first short stories, including “A Lodging for the Night” and “Will O’ The Mill”, were establishing a strong critical reputation as a prose writer.\n\nDuring this period he met his future wife, Fanny Van de Grift Osbourne, a Californian divorcee with one son, Lloyd Osbourne. They met at a famous artists’ colony outside Paris, and despite Fanny’s apparent interest in Louis’s cousin Bob, Stevenson managed to win her over. In 1879, he sailed from Greenock to New York, and traveled across Mainland America to San Francisco in pursuit of Fanny, who, in December of that year, divorced her husband. In May 1880, they were married, and in August they returned with Lloyd to England.\n\nFame and pecuniary success, however, would elude Stevenson a little while longer. His first novel, and arguably his most famous (except for Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde), was Treasure Island. However, it did not receive immediate critical or popular success. It was first published in Young Folks’ Magazine, in 17 weekly installments from 1 October 1881 to 28 January 1882. It did little to increase the paper’s circulation, and even received some complaints from readers, probably on account of the portrayal of violence for a boys’ magazine. In fact, it was his next novel, also published in Young Folks’, in 1883, The Black Arrow, which did establish some success for Stevenson, and laid the groundwork for his first blockbuster, Kidnapped. As with the previous two novels, Kidnapped was also published in Young Folks‘, and like The Black Arrow, was illustrated by the syndicated illustrated William Boucher, to Stevenson’s great satisfaction. All three novels would subsequently be published as novels, Treasure Island in 1883 by Cassell and Company, The Black Arrow in 1884 in Boston by the Roberts Brothers, and Kidnapped in 1886 by Cassell and Company.\n\nIt was in 1886 that Stevenson would pen his other popular masterpiece, Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. Building on the success of his previous prose works, Jekyll and Hyde was a global sensation, spawning copycat stories, plays (only one of which was author-approved), and even influencing the public perception and reception of the Jack the Ripper murders of 1888. Jekyll and Hyde brought Stevenson financial independence, and when, in 1887, his father died, he left Britain forever to find a healthy climate in the Pacific South Seas. He travelled across America by train with Fanny, Lloyd and his mother, and then sailed into the Pacific to find a new home, which, he hoped, would help him recover some health. They traveled to the Marquesas, north to Hawaii, and through various other Pacific archipelagos all the way to Sydney. Finally, they would settle in Samoa, where Stevenson would build his final home, called Vailima.\n\nIn his journeys through the Pacific, Stevenson would write some of his most creative work. He encountered and befriended many of the indigenous island communities, learning their customs and listening to their traditional stories, and formulated a kind of fiction that would influence later modernist and post-modern writers of the early twentieth century. Stories such as “The Beach of Falesá”, “The Bottle Imp” and “The Isle of Voices” (published together in 1893 as Island Nights’ Entertainments), were all written utilizing narrative forms of Polynesian stories, using their rhythms, motifs, even dialects. The novella The Ebb-Tide is a masterpiece of narrative invention, that offered a template of both style and structure for later stories that critiqued imperial intervention and exploitation of indigenous cultures, most notably by Joseph Conrad. He also wrote some of his great Scottish stories from the Pacific, including The Master of Ballantrae and the unfinished Weir of Hermiston.\n\nStevenson became an activist in Samoan politics, and in Samoan efforts to retain their independence in the face of imperial threats from Germany, America, and other competing parties within the Pacific. He died in his home from a brain hemorrhage on December 3, 1894. He was buried close to Vailima, to the great sorrow of his friends and family across the world, and also to his Samoan community, who coined the name “Tusitala”, or “teller of tales”.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nBell, Ian.
