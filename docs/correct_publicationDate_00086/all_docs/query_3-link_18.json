        "text": "The Stange Case of Dr.Jekyll and Mr.Hyde by Robert Louis Stevenson\n\nPublisher: Signet Classics\n\nPublished: September 2nd 2013 (first published 1886)\n\nSummary: In this harrowing tale of good and evil, the mild-mannered Dr. Jekyll develops a potion that unleashes his secret, inner persona—the loathsome, twisted Mr. Hyde.\n\nReview:\n\nI have to admit, this book blew my mind! I loved it! I had heard of this story, I knew it was about a doctor who could turn into a monster, a vicious one. I actually pictured his mean alter ego as Hulk.\n\nThe story begins with the lawyer Utterson who becomes interested on the strange and mysterious Mr.Hyde. As soon as Utterson hears about Mr.Hyde a need within him was created, a need to know beyond what he was told of this character, a need to know beyond the appearances. As he talks to everyone who might know Mr.Hyde, he finds a connection between Mr. Hyde and his dear friend, Dr.Jekyll. Although, a few years back, Dr. Jekyll and Utterson were big friends, Dr.Jekyll suddenly hid himself in his home, barely coming out of it or even contacting his friends.\n\nUtterson also finds that Dr.Jekyll wrote on his will that in case of his disappearance or death all his money should be given to Mr.Hyde. This obviously intrigued Utterson to no end. He wanted to know the connection between these two very different people.\n\nAs the book goes on I found myself more and more into it, despite knowing the truth behind this connection. Also, Mr.Hyde’s body changed in my mind, I could no longer see him as a Hulk, but rather as a fat, hairy Gollum (from Lord of the Rings).\n\nEven though this book’s story was quiet interesting, what really made me love it was the duality between good and evil. No one can be completely and truly good, or completely evil. Dr.Jekyll invented a potion that could bring up his evil half, a being incapable of love, remorse or even guilt. Dr.Jekyll soon became addicted to the potion, in it, he found a way to escape the real world and his sins by turning into Mr.Hyde. He could then place all of his wrong doings on Mr.Hyde without feeling guilty.\n\nHe couldn’t control Mr.Hyde for long, Mr.Hyde became stronger and stronger, being able to “come out” whenever he wanted and committing vicious acts without the control of Dr.Jekyll.\n\nAt the end, Dr.Jekyll tried to make amends, but those weren’t enough to prevent his death. He confesses his medical experiment and the mysterious Mr.Hyde in a letter sent to Utterson.\n\n4 Chibis"
