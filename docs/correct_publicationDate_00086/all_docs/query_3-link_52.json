        "text": "Are humans intrinsically good, intrinsically evil, or neutral? Dr.Jekyll, the main character of Dr.Jekyll and Mr. Hyde by Scottish author Robert Louis Stevenson. Dr, Jekyll realizes human has two sides: good and evil. He wants to separate his evil side to seeks to be perfectly good people. But Dr. Jekyll failed, Hyde begins to control Dr. Jekyll’s body day by day. Ultimately, Dr.jekyll commits suicide, taking Hyde with him. Everyone has Good and evil in their mind.good and evil are not only distinct from each other but also are intertwined and defined by each other. Only realize the evil and face it bravely can make people perfect.\n\nthe savage lies close beneath the surface in all of us, that civilization is just a mask to hide our true faces. When Dr. Jekyll tries to use a drug to separate his evil side, Mr. Hyde, from his good side, he finds this situation untenable: I learned to recognize the thorough and primitive duality of man: I saw that, of the two natures that contended in the field of my consciousness, even if I could rightly be said to be either, it was only because I was radically both. (Stevenson 41) he realizes that he can only be good and upright because he also has a darker and more evil side to himself. He also realizes that all of the humankind also has this duality and that good can only exist alongside evil because it is defined by its opposite.\n\nThe really evil is better than the hypocritical. Henry Jekyll wants to be the good side, but he still didn’t resist the temptation of evil. 'I knew myself, at the first breath of this new life, to be more wicked, tenfold more wicked, sold a slave to my original evil; and the thought, at that moment, braced and delighted me like wine. stretched out my hands, exulting in the freshness of these sensations; and in the act, I was suddenly aware that I had lost in stature' (42). Though Jekyll is always quick to defend himself from accusations of his hypocrisy because he sees himself as justified in his pursuit of perfection. but it is undeniable that he constantly uses hyde. In fact, Hyde is even better than Jekyll, especially for those people who value honesty and honesty more than social goodwill. At least Hyde is honest and candid about his wishes. Jekyll tries desperately to hide his immoralities behind a mask, deceiving everyone he knows. Even in the face of death, Jekyll refuses to come out and explain himself to his friends, opting instead to reveal the truth in a letter meant to be read post-mortem. ironically, even his adamant denial of hypocrisy in his letter to Utterson is a testament to his hypocrisy:“I was in no sense a hypocrite; both sides of me were in dead earnest; I was no more myself when I laid aside restraint and plunged in shame, than when I labored, in the eye of day, at the furtherance of knowledge or the relief of sorrow and suffering' (41).\n\nThe only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing. As Dr.Jekyll drank more and more medicine, Mr.Hyde gradually controlled Dr.Jekyll. “ If each I told myself could be housed in separate identities life would be relieved of all that was unbearable the unjust might go his way delivered from the aspirations and remorse of\n\nhis more upright twin and the just could walk steadfastly and securely on his upward path doing the good things in which he found his pleasure and no longer exposed to disgrace and penitence by the hands of this extraneous evil.”\n\nDr. Jekyll hates the evil Mr. Hyde and wants to hide his evil side. But Dr.Jekyll did not refuse the evil and the pleasure from the evil, let Mr.Hyde do what he wanted. In the end，Dr.Jekyll could not accept that he was controlled by evil. then Dr.Jekyll chose to end his life. make sure to killed Mr.Hyde, who controlled his body\n\nAll human beings have good and evil within them. Most people act good most of the time, while very few people act evil most of the time. The many people who act well do it because they have a reputation for being good that they feel they must keep. Another reason a lot of people don't act evil is that later on after a person has done their evil deed, they may feel shame or remorse for what they have done, and it will go on their conscience. More than occasionally, people consider that it may not be as fun or as easy to do what is considered 'good' but they usually do realize that if they do something evil and they are caught, that there will most likely be consequences. Most people would like to avoid consequences and overall avoid getting in trouble in the first place."
