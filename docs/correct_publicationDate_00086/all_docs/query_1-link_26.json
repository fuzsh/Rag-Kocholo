        "text": "Dr. Henry Jekyll is a well-known gentleman living in London. He seems perfectly normal—that is, until he wills his estate to Mr. Edward Hyde, a wicked figure who had assaulted a young girl. Dr. Jekyll’s lawyer and friend, Mr. Utterson finds this decision alarming, but Dr. Jekyll calms his fears. For a while, all is well, but then a witness sees Mr. Hyde commit a murder, and soon after Dr. Jekyll begins to act strangely. When Dr. Jekyll suddenly refuses to leave his laboratory, Mr. Utterson is left to uncover the truth, discovering that the respected Dr. Jekyll and the crude Mr. Hyde are not so different after all. This unabridged version of Robert Louis Stevenson’s Gothic novella, first published in England in 1886, takes on the classic struggle between good and evil."
