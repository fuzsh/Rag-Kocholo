Olivia-Newton John

In November 2006, I had the pleasure of going to an Olivia-Newton John concert at the Lowell Memorial Auditorium in Lowell Massachusetts. That past Summer I had met the promotions Director for the Auditorium and arranged to procure some tickets for a local radio station give away. Guests who went to the concert also were treated to dinner at the Outback Restaurant. Why the Outback? That’s easy Olivia is a British-Australian singer and Actress!

Who could ever forget Olivia’s role, of Sandy in Grease and all the big hits that came out of that show, “You’re The One That I Want” with John Travolta, “Hopelessly Devoted To You” and “Summer Nights” with John Travolta and the film’s cast.

All of the guests that went to the concert including my wife, Janet Thoroughly enjoyed the show which also included Olivia’s big hits from the early 70’s ,“Let Me Be There”, “I honestly Love You “ #1, and ”Have You Ever Been Mellow”. The Highlight of the night came after the show when we were invited to meet Olivia.

Before I went to the concert I learned that Olivia and I were born on the same date, September 26, 1948. How cool is that!!! When I met Olivia I told her I had always enjoyed her singing and that we shared a Birthday. I had a picture of Olivia with me and asked her to sign it. Olivia wrote, “To Steve “Love & Light fellow Libran”.

Needless to say it was a very memorable evening, one that Janet and I will always remember!
