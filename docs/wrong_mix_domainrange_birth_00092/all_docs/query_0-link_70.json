        "text": "GREASE IS THE WORD!\n\nDon't miss your local production of the hydromatic favorite!\n\nOne of the most popular musicals of all time comes to town! Written by Jim Jacobs and Warren Casey, this Brylcreem-heavy show charts the ups and downs of teenage couple Danny and Sandy as they navigate the social politics of 1950's Rydell High School. The score is packed with one hit number after another, including 'Beauty School Dropout,' 'Greased Lightnin',' 'We Go Together,' 'Born to Hand Jive,' and 'Summer Nights'.\n\nThe original Grease musical premiered on Broadway in 1972, where it was nominated for seven Tonys (it was the year of Follies, but it should have still won one of them!). Its reputation was of course sealed by its iconic silver screen adaptation that arrived six years later, starring the fresh-faced John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John, who were both on the cusp of superstardom."
