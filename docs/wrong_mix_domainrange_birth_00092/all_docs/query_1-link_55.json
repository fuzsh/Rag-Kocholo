        "text": "Secret Messages: Listening to ‘Juliana Hatfield Sings ELO’ with my Father’s Ghost\n\nBy Sun Hesper Jansen for The Jam Files\n\nThe day before my dad died, too young, from a succession of cancers, I worked up the courage to ask him if he’d mind haunting me. For all his life, he’d been an atheist and steadfast scoffer of all things spiritual. Only the fact that he'd liked talking to the hospice chaplain, who took one look at his long hair—and the enigmatically impish smile he'd developed in his waning months—and refused to buy that he wasn't some sort of mystic, finally emboldened me to confront him on the subject. Naturally, that was the day he lost the ability to speak at all, and when he listened, he was far away in the arms of Morpheus. The next morning, he was dead. It didn’t stop me from making my request. “You can be as dramatic as you like,” I said to his vacated shell, still half-prepared for him to wink at me. “I mean, I’m a known witch; I can handle dramatic. But I feel like it should be in music. Music would make a lot of sense.”\n\nContinue reading here.\n\nJuliana Hatfield on Her New Covers Album “Juliana Hatfield Sings ELO”\n\nBy Ian Rushbury for Under the Radar\n\nIsn’t it great when crazy ideas turn out to be the best ideas? Juliana Hatfield wasn’t the first artist to think, “Hey, I’m going to make an album of covers of just one artist!” Most of those plans fade with the hangover in the morning. Hatfield however stuck to it and has done it three times now.\n\nJoining her tributes to The Police and Olivia Newton-John is her latest album—Juliana Hatfield Sings ELO. Even the harshest critic would admit that that’s a bold undertaking, especially for a three-piece band with not a trace of a cello or a violin. She’s turned (another) labor of love into a smart, credible alternative rock gem. Hatfield spoke to Under the Radar about this and her other two cover albums prior to her U.S. tour in the fall of 2023.\n\nIan Rushbury (Under the Radar): As someone who was born in Birmingham UK and as a consequence loves pretty much anything associated with Jeff Lynne and Roy Wood, I was especially keen to hear your treatments of these ELO songs.\n\nWell, I hope that I did them justice. I hope that the fans are okay with what I did.\n\nContinue reading here.\n\nJuliana Hatfield — My Life in Music\n\nThe Boston indie-rock luminary on the records that don’t bring her down\n\nBy Sam Richards for UNCUT\n\nX\n\nUnder The Big Black Sun\n\nELEKTRA, 1982\n\n​​I was a teenager living in this small town in Massachusetts. My older brother decided to join the army and his girlfriend moved in with us. She became the cool, older sister that I never had and her record collection was really a really important education. I remember one day she put on the X song “Motel Room In My Bed” and I thought it was the most exciting, glorious sound I’d ever heard. It made me realise that I was looking for something much more raw and weird and tough than the pop stuff on the radio, but without losing any of the melody. I didn’t really understand that they’re singing about sex and poverty and death, but somehow I still related to the angst underneath.\n\nContinue reading Juliana’s list here.\n\nJuliana Hatfield Sings ELO: AllMusic Review\n\nBy Stephen Thomas Erlewine\n\nThe third in a series of tribute albums from Juliana Hatfield to her idols, Juliana Hatfield Sings ELO finds the singer/songwriter tackling the catalog of an artist that is known for their lush, layered arrangements — the kind of recordings that are the opposite of Hatfield's largely handmade recordings. Part of the charm of her Sings series is how Hatfield addresses these kinds of challenges, finding ways to rearrange familiar records so they retain their original vibe while also bearing her own idiosyncratic imprint. With Juliana Hatfield Sings ELO, she achieves this by balancing classic rock radio staples with deep cuts — she closes the proceedings with \"Ordinary Dream,\" pulled from Electric Light Orchestra's excellent latter-day album Zoom — then concentrating on the elements that give ELO a light, sweet airiness. That's a spirit that easily translates to the stripped-down surroundings Hatfield creates by herself, along with drums from Chris Anzalone and bass by Ed Valauskas. Choosing to transpose strings to guitar and voice helps Hatfield achieve a sense of intimacy while retaining a sense of romantic grandeur, a combination that gives Juliana Hatfield Sings ELO a distinctly warm and comforting feeling without succumbing to the pitfalls of nostalgia.\n\nJuliana Hatfield Sings ELO\n\nBy Kyle Lemmon | FLOOD Magazine\n\nOn her third covers LP since 2018, the alt-rock songwriter takes on Jeff Lynne’s symphonic rock hits and deep cuts with a locked-down style that’s less theatrical than even her own recordings.\n\nJuliana Hatfield has cranked out solo albums at a quick clip since 1992, but beginning in 2018 the alt-rock songwriter shifted to switching between original LPs and covers of influential ’70s and ’80s artists she grew up listening to as a budding musician. Previous covers ran the gamut from The Police to Olivia Newton-John, but her voice perhaops fits most comfortably with her latest pick: the classically inclined pop and symphonic rock of Jeff Lynne’s Electric Light Orchestra.\n\nWhereas ELO always pushed every button and mixed in as many studio tricks as possible, Juliana Hatfield Sings ELO makes no fuss on lightly produced versions of “Telephone Line,” “Can’t Get It Out of My Head,” and “Strange Magic” (Hatfield wisely selects more than just the blockbuster stadium-rock hits such as “Mr. Blue Sky,” “Turn to Stone,” or “Evil Woman” to cover). The indelible guitar hooks and high-gloss melodies of ELO shine through most on “From the End of the World,” though. Hatfield nails that deeper-catalog track and a few other career earworms from ELO, but her overall style is locked down and less theatrical than even her own recordings.\n\nContinue reading here.\n\nBy John Moore | Glide Magazine\n\nIt admittedly started as a novelty, or so it seemed. In 2018, Juliana Hatfield – one of the coolest understated musicians to come out of alternative rock (when that term still meant something) put out Juliana Hatfield Sings Olivia Newton-John. Gen X has a storied tradition of covering ironic music (we made cover albums of School House Rock and Saturday Morning Cartoon theme songs) and this just seemed to play into both nostalgia and irony. But the album, made up of more than a dozen Newton-John songs, was actually great, and given the care that went into these songs, it was clear that Hatfield was a genuine fan. The next year she followed up with Juliana Hatfield Sings The Police; surprisingly, an even better covers album than the one before. So, Juliana Hatfield Sings ELO seems not only logical but expected given Hatfield’s love for pure unadulterated melodic pop songs.\n\nAnd yes, it’s as good as you’d imagine.\n\nContinue reading here.\n\nBy Mike Tobyn | Cover Me\n\nThe Electric Light Orchestra, over a journey lasting 50 years and counting, have never been contemporaneously cool. Jeff Lynne and Roy Wood formed the band to allow them to fuse their love of pop with their classical training and knowledge. Orchestra was clearly a statement. Wood soon moved on to other things, but Lynne has stayed with the concept ever since. They have never been at the forefront of a trend, and only reluctantly acknowledge following any. During their rebirth in the 2010s, one journalist called them “anti-cool,” from a position of deep love and appreciation.\n\nThe music did all the talking, and it was in magnificent voice. Lynne himself liked to hide behind his Aviator glasses, thus providing a role model for Daft Punk hiding behind helmets. As Punk, the art form, was starting in their home country, ELO were touring the United Streets, beguiling live and TV audiences with a lineup including two cellos, a French Horn, and a Mellotron. However, the music was amazing. Classically influenced, prog adjacent, concept album addicted, disco flecked at times but with true song-making craft combined with expert musicianship. Lynne was clearly appreciated as a ‘musician’s musician,’ with a remarkable catalogue of collaborations with some of the greatest of them all, but the public was behind the artists. Everyone got there in the end, and today ELO are in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Lynne is in the Songwriters Hall of Fame, and many artists have sampled their work in acknowledgment of their influence.\n\nContinue reading here.\n\nReview: Juliana Hatfield Faces the Music With A Set of E.L.O. Covers\n\nBy Hal Horowitz | American Songwriter\n\nStarting in 2018, singer/songwriter Juliana Hatfield began alternating albums of original material with those dedicated to interpretations of ’70s-’80s artists that have influenced her. Previous releases reimagined tracks from the Olivia Newton-John and The Police catalogs with her understated, breathy, voice and stripped-down, even earthy instrumentation. She returns to tackle the pop and pomp of the Electric Light Orchestra.\n\nEventually shortened to just E.L.O., the Jeff Lynne-fronted band shifted from a prog-infused, Beatles-inflected outfit, with prominent strings that were a full-time band and touring members (ie: not hired hands), to chart-busting icons whose sumptuous hits dominated radio playlists for a large portion of the ’70s. E.L.O.’s heavily produced, some may say over-produced, output was initially reflective of the times, but became less so as punk took over and Lynne seemed to be a dinosaur.\n\nContinue reading here.\n\nJuliana Hatfield Sings ELO Stereophile Review\n\nPerformance ****\n\nSonics *****\n\nJuliana Hatfield has always found a way to stand out in what seems like a crowded field. As a member of bands like Blake Babies and Some Girls, she shaped a sound that was always fresh but also in step with what was popular. Five years ago, she switched gears and did something it seemed like maybe too many other artists were already doing: She made a covers album.\n\nShe chose Olivia Newton-John. Her take grabbed ears, turned heads, and reminded us to never count Hatfield out. A Police tribute followed; it too was widely celebrated; a review in Under the Radar said, \"Juliana Hatfield Sings The Police distills all that's great about Hatfield ... and presents it in the context of an artist reinventing herself, and these songs, for all to see.\"\n\nNow she arrives with her strongest tribute album yet; it may be one of her strongest records ever.\n\nJuliana Hatfield Sings ELO is a brilliant look at the career of Jeff Lynne, one of rock's most highly regarded writers, producers, and performers and the singular creative force behind ELO. Hatfield picked his music to explore partly because they share an approach. Alone with Garage Band in her bedroom, she tinkered with the sound, arrangements, and harmonies with the same attention to detail Lynne brought into the studio throughout his career. The result is a 10-song collection that is bright, breezy, and lush but firm when firmness is required. The collection spans ELO's career including not just well-known hits like \"Telephone Line\" and \"Don't Bring Me Down\" but also \"Ordinary Dream\" from the much later album Zoom.\n\nDeconstructing the work of an artist like Lynne and reassembling it requires rare confidence and daring. Once again she transforms the music. It loses none of its majesty and little of its depth. Indeed, Hatfield may have just moved the music of Jeff Lynne and ELO into heavy rotation for a new generation of listeners.—Ray Chestowski\n\nJuliana Hatfield Announces ELO Covers Album, Shares “Don’t Bring Me Down”: Stream\n\nJuliana Hatfield has announced a new addition to her series of covers albums. Juliana Hatfield Sings ELO drops November 17th via American Laundromat Records, while her rendition of “Don’t Bring Me Down” is out now.\n\nAs indie rock royalty, it may come as a surprise that Hatfield would enjoy the pop stylings of Electric Light Orchestra. Yet you could easily trace her inarguably catchy music to the band’s melodies. “ELO songs were always coming on the radio when I was growing up. They were a reliable source of pleasure and fascination,” Hatfield said in a statement. “With this album of covers I wanted to get my hands deep into some of the massive ‘70’s hits but I am also shining a light on some of the later work… My task was to try and break all the things down and reconstruct them subtly until they felt like mine.”\n\nContinue reading here.\n\nLive Long and Prosper, Juliana Hatfield\n\nBy Jesse Sendejas Jr. | Houston Press\n\nWhen it comes to her favorite artists, Juliana Hatfield wears her heart proudly on her sleeve. Alt-rock royalty and a guitar hero in her own right, she’s recorded full cover albums of her music heroes, artists like Olivia Newton-John and The Police. So, which song might she select as one of particular brilliance in her life? “Make a Move on Me,” maybe? Or perhaps “Can’t Stand Losing You?” Hatfield decided to boldly go in a different direction.\n\nWe chatted with Hatfield about one prominent song in her life and the songs on Blood, her 19th solo studio album. We asked how she’s been a prolific songwriter over the years and her thoughts on touring during the pandemic, all ahead of a scheduled tour stop in Houston last month.\n\nContinue reading here.\n\nSince her emergence in the late ‘80s with Boston indie outfit Blake Babies, Juliana Hatfield has maintained a fruitful output as both a solo artist and a member of sundry bands. She began the ‘90s with the Lemonheads and established herself as a distinctive voice of the era with the Juliana Hatfield Three, which she reformed to critical acclaim in 2014. Long after so many of her cohorts came and went, she continues to turn out album after album, combining angst and authenticity with snappy songsmithing. Her nineteenth solo effort, “Blood,” is at once a testament to the times and a continuation of her signature style.\n\nThe new record is about as dark as the title suggests, unsparing in both its psychological explorations and its societal indictments. Hatfield tackles both the personal and the political with plenty of grit, punk energy, and torrential distortion, but packages it with a certain playfulness. The songs are as catchy as they are abrasive, with their volatile contents held together judiciously by musical elements that strike a fine balance. Hatfield sang and played guitars, keyboards, and drums on the album, and it’s fitting, considering such immersion, that her lyrics seem to hold nothing back. She spoke with Entertainment Voice about the creative process, musical choices, and lyrical underpinnings of her latest work.\n\nContinue reading here.\n\nFollowing the release of her latest album, Blood, indie-rock icon Juliana Hatfield talks about songwriting, her minimalist guitar ‘collection’ and why recording an album during a pandemic meant she finally had to get to grips with GarageBand.\n\nJuliana Hatfield has just released her 19th solo album of original material, Blood – it’s the latest entry in a wonderfully varied career that sees her rightly enshrined as indie-rock royalty. She started out with her Boston band Blake Babies back in 1987, and has also incorporated two albums of covers (The Police and Olivia Newton John, since you ask), releases with Some Girls, The I Don’t Cares, Minor Alps, a stint playing bass with the Lemonheads, and a six-song EP with the band Frank Smith. So yes, she’s extremely prolific. What is also remarkable is the consistent quality of that output. From the outside it appears almost effortless, as if the music lives inside her always.\n\n“Music that’s in my ear, just day to day melodies that I’m humming, that’s usually other people’s songs,” Hatfield tells us from her home in Cambridge, Massachusetts. “When I’m writing, when I’m coming up with new things, I’m usually more focused. I have to sit down and work on it.\n\nContinue reading here.\n\nThe indie-rocker is now a touchstone for a generation of young songwriters – and after learning to channel her pain and frustration, her 18th album is one of her best\n\nJliana Hatfield speaks with deliberation: her thoughts unfurl after pregnant pauses and are sharpened by astute clarifications. “I’m sorry, I lost my train of thought,” she says at one point, doubling back to ensure her meaning is clear. Such consideration isn’t a surprise, given the rippling effect of an infamous early-career interview.\n\nNearly 30 years ago, while promoting her debut solo album Hey Babe, 23-year-old Hatfield, who was brand new to interviews, admitted to an inquiring male journalist that she was still a virgin. The casual comment became the focus of his piece, and incited scrutiny that followed the American songwriter throughout her rise. “When I was in the thick of it, it wasn’t really computing for me,” she says on a phone call from her home in Cambridge, Massachusetts. “It wasn’t until much later that I realised how intense it was, how gross it was, and how it affected my career in negative ways.”\n\nContinue reading here.\n\nIn her new album, Juliana Hatfield’s concerns are comeuppance, self-abasement, and the depravity of those who revel in the power to make decisions that can adversely affect others.\n\nDuring her six-year tenure with American Laundromat Records, Juliana Hatfield has alternated between covers of her longtime favorite artists, as she did on Sings Olivia Newton-John and Sings The Police, and her own compositions, as she did on — among others — 2019’s Weird (click my Arts Fuse review) and Blood, which is now available in formats that include variously colored cassettes and LPs.\n\nThere is indeed — please forgive me for this as I might not forgive myself — blood on these tracks. Sometimes Hatfield utters the word itself, other times she conjures up images that are unavoidably sanguinary. Among her concerns: comeuppance, self-abasement, and the depravity of those who who revel in the power to make decisions that can adversely affect others.\n\nContinue reading here.\n\nThe last time I spoke with Juliana Hatfield was January 2019, just in advance of her seventeenth studio album Weird. That batch of songs, which reflected her own sentiments of seclusion and detachment from the outside world, proved to be eerily prophetic of what was to come for most of us about a year later.\n\nBut on her latest effort Blood, Hatfield isn’t so introspective, instead turning the mirror outward to the anger, division, avarice, and violence that have choked our country. “I think these songs are a reaction to how seriously and negatively a lot of people have been affected by the past four years,” she said recently in a press release. “But it’s fun, musically. There’s a lot of playing around.”\n\nBlood is the best kind of sonic contradiction, pitting Hatfield’s biting wordplay against vivacious melodies and delectable grooves. As always, she writes with incisive imagery that’s especially fun to pull apart and examine on tracks like “Mouthful of Blood” and “Chunks,” which are rife with colorful metaphor. Her guitar work adds depth and drama to the mix, and she never seems to fail in finding some kind of new way to express herself through her strings.\n\nContinue reading here.\n\nName Juliana Hatfield\n\nBest known for alternawaifdom.\n\nCurrent city Cambridge, MA.\n\nReally want to be in In one fantasy of mine I move to Helsinki to work as a textile designer for Marimekko.

This year marks the 30-year anniversary of our music video for the song “Out There,” which featured us shaving our heads on camera.\n\nIn early 2020, my band Sunshine Boys supported Juliana for a few shows on her US tour, and during a backstage chat we discovered we were both sick of dyeing our hair to hide the grey, and had both been thinking about chopping it all off to let nature take its course. Months later, during COVID-19 lockdown, we decided to take the leap together again, making a tidy bookend with the “Out There” video shoot 30 years earlier.\n\nThis is an edited transcript of our email exchange as we reflect on now and then, going grey, and growing older.\n\nContinue reading here.\n\nIn the last couple of years, Juliana Hatfield has recorded full-length tributes to Olivia Newton-John and the Police. These decisions seem pretty random, and they make one think: What's next? Homages to Joan Armatrading and Ian Dury & the Blockheads? (I'd be okay with that, actually.) Regardless of what you think of her choices, Hatfield is a consummate pro in the vocal and guitar-playing departments, and she handles the material with golden-eared, indie-rock aptitude. Over the last 28 years with the Blake Babies and many other projects and on her own, she's proved herself extremely adept at interpreting other people's songs as well as writing her own melodious compositions that instantly insinuate themselves into your memory.\n\nContinue reading here.\n\nLos Angeles has had a long-running yet intermittent love affair with Juliana Hatfield dating back to the days the Blake Babies broke out of the college radio ranks and her Juliana Hatfield Three project followed. Since then, she’d sweep through town every few years like a breath of fresh air. Her songwriting craft and musicianship are second-to-none in an industry of bar-chord rock. She can do it all with an open heart and open fingering on the fretboard. She’d dazzle us and then she would disappear for another couple years to write another new album. Being strung along over 18 albums hasn’t been completely insufferable, though.\n\nHatfield’s last appearance here in the City of Angels was the 2015 reunion of the trio at the Roxy, celebrating the release of their second album in 22 years, “Whatever, My Love.” Last night, she returned as a four-piece (with trio member Dean Fisher on bass, Mike Oram on second guitar and Chris Anzalone on drums). They touched down at the Echoplex in the middle of a month-long, 20-date foray across the States behind her most recent releases: 2018’s “Juliana Hatfield Sings Olivia Newton-John;” last year’s releases of new originals “Weird” (see below); and a second one-band covers album, “Juliana Hatfield Sings The Police.” Not surprisingly, Hatfield’s distinctive voice tied the disparate material into one cohesive night.\n\nContinue reading here.\n\n12 OF THE BEST MUSIC SHOWS THIS WEEK IN L.A. | L.A. Weekly\n\nThroughout her career, Juliana Hatfield has penned an impressive number of thoughtful, melodic and musically varied original songs. But going back to the 1980s and her time with Blake Babies — when she bent genders with a coyly charming remake of The Stooges’ feral “Loose” — the Massachusetts singer has also specialized in uniquely personal covers of material by other musicians. In 2018, Hatfield defied expectations of punk-rock coolness when she released Juliana Hatfield Sings Olivia Newton-John, and late last year she similarly reexamined the work of Sting and company with Juliana Hatfield Sings the Police. Rather than just mimic the overplayed originals, she imbued them with her own wit and arrangements, especially a punked-out revitalization of the dozy “Murder by Numbers.” Despite such digressions, Hatfield is at her best on 2019’s Weird, a set of glowing original indie-rock anthems. —Falling James\n\nJuliana Hatfield could, as they say, sing the phonebook and we’d listen. So it’s all the more captivating when she covers someone like the Police. Hatfield just dropped a Rachel Lichtman-directed video for her cover of “Can’t Stand Losing You,” off of 2019’s Juliana Hatfield Sings the Police (via American Laundromat).\n\nHatfield fronts a band of Julianas in the slick video for the track (she played all the instruments on the recording), her vocals adding new sheen to the 1978 classic. The three versions of Hatfield represent Sting, Andy Summers and Stewart Copeland — with a rare peek at the musician on the drums. In her capable hands, the song sounds like it could have come out today — rather than more than 40 years ago. Plus, the suit Sting Juliana sports is sharp.\n\nContinue reading here.\n\nThe New Intepreters: Singer-Songwriters Find Comfort in Covers | TIDAL.com\n\nThe cover version — it’s an essential part of the history of rock ’n’ roll. After all, one could even argue that if Elvis Presley hadn’t covered Arthur Crudup’s “That’s All Right” in 1954, bringing an amped-up version of the blues to white audiences, rock ’n’ roll as we know it might not exist.\n\nCovers are also how the Beatles and the Rolling Stones found their footing, tackling songs by their heroes such as Little Richard and Chuck Berry as they honed their songwriting skills. Once they mastered that craft, it brought a seismic shift to popular music, inspiring later rock ’n’ roll bands to follow their muse and write original material.\n\nOf course, between then and now, rock artists have covered other performers’ songs, sometimes dedicating entire albums to interpretations. David Bowie’s 1973 effort Pin-Ups and John Lennon’s 1975 set Rock ’n’ Roll come to mind, but more often than not rock artists have relied on their own songs.\n\nIn recent years, however, the covers album appears to be making a comeback.\n\nContinue reading here.\n\nEvery Little Thing She Does Is Magic: Juliana Hatfield Goes Deep On Her New Police Cover Album | GRAMMY.COM\n\nThe alt-rock veteran cleverly balances some of the GRAMMY-winning band's most iconic hits like \"Every Breath You Take,\" \"Roxanne\" and \"Can't Stand Losing You,\" with some of their deeper album cuts and B-sides on her latest project\n\n\"I'm starting to think I may have finally found my true calling. I think this might be my thing and I'm really enjoying it,\" Juliana Hatfield mused, with equal parts dry wit and keen self-awareness. This confessional observation comes from the seasoned singer/songwriter/bandleader reflecting on her newest musical endeavor—splitting up her standard album releases with cover albums entirely devoted to a single artist or band.\n\nFollowing 2018's widely celebrated Juliana Hatfield Sings Olivia Newton-John and this year's Weird, she has once again picked an inspirational muse from her early years around which to craft a lovingly loud collection of guitar-graced tributes.\n\nContinue reading here.\n\nCovers projects can be a dicey proposition. For established artists, it could be a sign of creative bankruptcy or just plain laziness. Often it's simply a love letter from artist to artist, acknowledging the influence and (hopefully) paying solid, earnest tribute. The key to a successful tribute album is to shed new light on the songs while remaining faithful to the spirit of the original. That is where Weezer got it so painfully wrong on their surprise covers album, The Teal Album, which contains ten note-for-note covers of songs the whole world knows by heart. That's not a cover, that's karaoke. What's the point?\n\nJuliana Hatfield understands how to make a good covers album. Last year, her Olivia Newton-John tribute album won several accolades. While she didn't stray too far from the original arrangements, she helped shed light on the songbook of an artist who, despite a string of successful singles, has remained largely underrated. With her latest covers album, Juliana Hatfield Sings the Police, Hatfield is tackling a completely different type of artist and is surpassing the Newton-John project by rearranging the songs in an often striking fashion. Sting, Andy Summers, and Stewart Copeland made up a band that was not necessarily known for being covered ad nauseum, and that's odd because hearing their songs performed by another artist only confirms the quality of these songs.\n\nContinue reading here.\n\nJuliana Hatfield Sings The Police Plays The Hits | Paste\n\nEverything you’d expect from a Hatfield cover album, but more\n\nListening to Juliana Hatfield Sings The Police, Bostonian punk-adjacent rocker Juliana Hatfield’s second release of 2019, is like listening to yourself singing The Police while riding in the car with you friends, except none of you are Juliana Hatfield, only half of you actually remember the lyrics to each of the songs and, unless you’re Jimmy Fallon, you don’t have a band backing you up as you belt out and mangle the classics. So really, it’s not at all like listening to yourself singing The Police, which is a relief; it’s a good enough time just listening to Hatfield pay tribute to one of rock’s greatest bands in her own particular way.\n\nContinue reading here.\n\nAlone with her guitar, Juliana Hatfield embraces confusion on Weird\n\nIt’s a chilly afternoon in Boston and Juliana Hatfield is noticeably under the weather. But talking about guitars and her new album, Weird (American Laundromat), appears to be a welcome distraction. “I’m trying not to think about it,” she says between coughs. The sentiment fits Weird’s recurring theme of isolation. To paraphrase a line from “Do It to Music,” the album’s closing track, music is how she blocks out the world and its troubles.\n\nHatfield is best known for her alt-rock hits “My Sister” and “Spin the Bottle,” both from the Juliana Hatfield Three’s 1993 album, Become What You Are, and for her stint in the Lemonheads the previous year, when she played bass on It’s a Shame About Ray. Those who jumped ship when the ’90s faded have missed a lot. In back-to-back releases like Beautiful Creature and Total System Failure, Hatfield expressed her love of pop songcraft and grimy blasts of distortion, respectively, a dichotomy she wields masterfully on her new, and 15th, solo release.\n\nContinue reading here.\n\nCan’t Help Myself: a Conversation with Juliana Hatfield | TALKHOUSE\n\nChris Collingwood (Fountains of Wayne) talks to his friend about the process of writing her latest album, Weird\n\nJuliana Hatfield’s career has been built on intensely personal songs crafted with meticulous attention to melody, and her new album Weirdreaffirms her reputation for looking inward with eleven songs about coming to terms with solitude. I spoke to Juliana about her process, in what I hope is the first of several pieces about how artists make art. (Full disclosure: Juliana and I have traveled in the same circles for years.)\n\nChris Collingwood: You’ve put out around twenty albums with various bands. I’m thinking about 2017’s Pussycat and it seems at least with that one, you had to have a conception of it ahead of time.\n\nJuliana Hatfield: I’m not a conceptualizer. I really don’t plan anything and it’s usually just a case of my writing about whatever I’m thinking about at the time. That album was written during the run-up to the presidential election, so it was inspired by current events going on around me, which is all anyone was thinking about. That’s my process in terms of subject matter. It’s not very conceptual. That one just happened to seem very conceptual, and it is, because that’s what I was experiencing emotionally at the time.\n\nContinue reading here.\n\nSince her early output with the Blake Babies and her then-nascent solo career, Juliana Hatfield has learned many truths about herself, such as how she truly appreciates the restorative power of solitude, and the helpfulness of creating within boundaries. Both of these ideas come into play on her new album, Weird, which draws a small circle around the themes of disconnection, self-reliance, and blissful aloneness.\n\nConceptual focus has become more prominent on her recent albums, like the furious post-election release Pussycat, and her sincere tribute album Juliana Hatfield Sings Olivia Newton-John. It's an approach that suits her well, with Weird delivering 11 songs that retain her distinct musical hallmarks, accompanied by a sharp and cohesive set of lyrics.\n\nWe spoke with Hatfield about being the \"anti-Kardashian,\" writing lyrics at the kitchen table, and her new song that harkens back to the heady days of guitar-heavy 90s alt-rock.\n\nContinue reading here.\n\nDue to arrive this week, just nine months since the release of the acclaimed Juliana Hatfield Sings Olivia Newton-John, is the acclaimed singer-songwriter's seventeenth studio album, Weird. Weird explores both the confinement and liberty of solitude. “I often feel cut-off from other people, from my feelings, from technology, from popular culture,” Hatfield explains in a recent press release. “I feel weird, I feel like I’m dreaming my life and that I am going to wake up some day.”\n\nFrom start to finish, Hatfield’s new set is adorned with irresistible melodies, shimmering on tracks like “Sugar” and “Do It To Music,” and brooding on others like “Receiver” and “Paid To Lie.”\n\nWhere her true singularity lies is in the dust-up, bumping each of Weird’s songs around in unexpected directions with crunchy guitar solos (the blown-speaker buzz effect she achieves on “Lost Ship” is particularly great), purposely constructed to reflect Hatfield’s mindset while recording the album.\n\nContinue reading here.\n\nThe Rumpus mini-interview project #132: Juliana Hatfield\n\nThink back to your first records: not the records your parents had sitting around, but the first albums you really wanted—the ones that made it on to your Christmas wish lists. At some point, you probably grew out of those records, or at least pretended to, abandoning them for the cooler, perhaps more detached, tastes of an older friend or sibling, or maybe the local DJ. But not me, and not Juliana Hatfield.\n\n“I have never not loved Olivia Newton-John,” she explains in a press release for her new album, Juliana Hatfield Sings Olivia Newton-John. “Her music has brought me so much pure joy throughout my life.”\n\nPop music has long been reinterpreted by alternative artists, from Sonic Youth’s Madonna-inspired side project Ciccone Youth to Ryan Adams’s song-for-song reworking of Taylor Swift’s 1989. But Hatfield’s project isn’t intended as ironic. It’s a sincere tribute, and a perfect pairing of two distinct musical sensibilities.\n\nContinue reading here.\n\nFew fans of Juliana Hatfield might have guessed that Olivia Newton-John is one of her favorite singers: Ms. Newton-John’s name appears once, in passing, in Ms. Hatfield’s “When I Grow Up: A Memoir,” and her 2012 self-titled covers album included songs by Ryan Adams, Liz Phair, Nada Surf, Teenage Fanclub and classic rockers—though no Ms. Newton-John.\n\nBut Ms. Hatfield’s new “Juliana Hatfield Sings Olivia Newton-John” (American Laundromat), out now, is such a loving tribute that it makes her admiration clear. Ms. Hatfield takes 13 songs from the singer’s impressive catalog and remakes them in her own signature style in which pop, punk and indie rock unite.\n\nA joy in itself, “Juliana Hatfield Sings Olivia Newton-John” demands a fresh visit to the body of work of both artists—one of whom found a cult following amid a rocky, three-decade-long career, the other achieving global acclaim with unpretentious charisma...\n\nContinue reading here.\n\nJuliana Hatfield is an old hat at making an unlikely song her own. Earlier this year, she made both our Best Cover Songs of January and March roundups. A couple years before that, her version of “Needle in the Hay” was a high point of a Wes Anderson tribute album. A couple years before that, she released a terrific self-titled covers album of her own. I mean, how far back do we want to go here? Hell, she even made our Best Cover Songs of 1996 list! Suffice to say, she knows how to crush a great cover.\n\nThat’s why we were so excited to hear about Juliana Hatfield Sings Olivia Newton-John. It more than lives up to our high expectations. Hatfield takes on hits like “Physical” alongside plenty of deep cuts that prove this is not some gimmick; she’s a genuine fan.\n\nContinue reading here.\n\nIn song, as in romance, one never forgets a first love. No matter how cheesy or childish it may seem later, the memory of that initial encounter with music’s emotional power never goes away. For me, it was Paul McCartney and Herman’s Hermits; for you, maybe it was *NSYNC or Hanson. For Juliana Hatfield, it was Olivia Newton-John.\n\nBut Hatfield never committed the betrayal that most of us are guilty of. She never spurned her middle-school crush when she got to high school. I may have mocked Herman’s Hermits; you may have mocked Hanson, but Hatfield stayed true to Newton-John. She embraced punk rock as an older adolescent, but...\n\nContinue reading here.\n\nAnyone who knows Juliana Hatfield probably remembers her from the ‘90s, when her band The Juliana Hatfield Three was a mainstay on alternative rock stations and MTV. Her biggest hit was a song called “My Sister,” a lean, pugnacious number that encapsulated the scraggy sound Hatfield became famous for.\n\nThe album art for “Juliana Hatfield Sings Olivia Newton-John.” (Courtesy)\n\nSo some might be surprised to learn about Hatfield’s latest endeavor: an entire album of covers of Olivia Newton-John, the English-Australian singer and actress best known for her star turn as Sandy in the hit 1978 film “Grease” and for a string of treacly soft rock gems in the ‘70s and ‘80s.\n\nContinue reading — and listen to the WBUR interview — here.\n\nFrom her days as a member of indie anchors Blake Babies and Lemonheads up through her ongoing solo career, Juliana Hatfield has been a quietly steady presence in the underground pop-rock world. While it’s been a while since she hit the commercial heights of her ‘90s peak when the Juliana Hatfield Trio's Become What You Are and her 1995 solo effort Only Everything landed her on the Billboard 200, she has maintained a dedicated fan base thanks to steady touring and a consistency of vision as she combines personal explorations with more universal concerns.\n\nMore recently, her 2017 release Pussycat was an album-length rebuke to our current president, with sharp lyrics and a welcoming musical jangle...\n\nContinue reading here.\n\n\"Pussycat is the kind of bluntly political record Hatfield used to be knocked for shying away from. At the height of her 1990s stardom, Hatfield was dismissed in the more activist corners of the music world as a lightweight (never mind that her songs frequently explored the ways society needles and dismisses women). She's spent her career in an often thankless middle ground, too feminine for the masculine music press, yet not punk enough for the riot grrls. But Pussycat lends the case for a critical reappraisal. Now would be an ideal time for one...\"\n\n—Pitchfork\n\n\"Hatfield's fury works in her favor. Even when the tempos are slightly slow or the guitar hooks charm, there's a nerviness to the performance that's bracing. And, beneath that kinetic energy lies a wealth of smart, barbed songs. What impresses about Pussycat overall is how there's no separation between the personal and the political...the specificity of her outrage makes Pussycat an unusually powerful protest album.\"\n\n—All Music\n\n\"The current resident of the White House will likely inspire plenty of angry art..credit Boston indie-rock institution Juliana Hatfield with landing the first full-force blow. Pussycat is a relentless, unabashed and unvarnished reaction to the Trump presidency; a frequently gruesome, sometimes funny and even occasionally hopeful assault on the assaulter-in-chief.\"\n\n—Paste\n\n\"Pussycat..is not so much a response to Donald Trump as it is a channeling of the long-held, easily-accessed, unassuageable fury one feels in the dominant culture of sexism, abuse, lookism, and degradation which Trump—though it of course predates him—has come to represent, perpetuate, minimize, sanitize, and reinforce. The fourteen songs that comprise Pussycat are not arguing for the newness or the arrival of anything; they are phoenixes rising from the known and familiar fire of what it is to live in a recursive, crushing, enduring patriarchy. Which brings me to my second point: to classify Pussycat as \"anti-Trump\" or even to characterize it less generally as \"a political album\" is to imply, however tacitly, that such subject matter is somehow new terrain for Hatfield, whereas any student of the music she's put out into the world in the thirty years she's been a performer will tell you: she's never been anything but political.\"\n\n—Vincent Scarpa, Performer magazine"
