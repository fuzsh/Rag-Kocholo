        "text": "Steve Carell Massachusetts\n\nSteve Carell is hilarious. That goes without saying. So, regardless of where he's from, New Englanders would be a massive fan of him anyway.\n\nBut, that said, we get to brag on him a bit, because Steve is one of us -- a New Englander, born and raised, in Concord, Massachusetts, according to his IMDb page.\n\nSteve Carell Movies\n\nYou may know Steve best as the character Michael Scott from the hit show The Office (that's what she said), or maybe his hilarious performance in the Anchorman movies as the character Brick Tamland (he stabbed a man in the heart with a trident, you know).\n\nHell, you may even know him best as the owner of the Marshfield Hills General Store (true story, by the way.)\n\nBut before he made it big in the world of movies and television, Steve got his start as a radio host in Ohio.\n\nSteve Carell College\n\nSteve went to college out in Granville, Ohio, graduating from Denison University back in 1984. And during his stay, he decided to jump into the radio world for his college station, 91.1 WDUB (now known as Doobie Radio.)\n\nAnd sure, his radio career started and ended at Denison, but his DJ name will live on forever as one of the most iconic, hilarious, on-brand.\n\nSapphire Steve Carell.\n\nIt's a name that he jokes about now, which has allowed other radio personalities to have some fun with it, including a couple of staff members at BBC Radio 2 in London, England, who gave \"Sapphire Steve\" his own jingle."
