        "text": "The celebrity world has been mourning the death of Australian singer and actress Olivia Newton-John, best known for playing Sandy in classic musical Grease, alongside John Travolta.\n\nThe Danny Zuko actor led the tributes for his late co-star as everyone from Kylie Minogue to Nicole Kidman and Mariah Carey shared their memories of the Xanadu singer and sent their best wishes to her family.\n\nGrease was of course released in 1978 and is one of the best-loved screen musicals of all time – but just how old was Dame Olivia Newton-John when she starred alongside John Travolta as the wholesome Sandy?\n\nHere’s what you need to know…\n\nHow old was Olivia Newton-John when she starred in Grease?\n\nOlivia Newton-John was born on September 26, 1948 – meaning she was 73 when she died on August 8, 2022.\n\nDespite playing a high school student in Grease, she actually turned 29 during the filming of the movie in 1977.\n\nShe won the role after meeting producer Allan Carr at a dinner party – with the movie going on to become the biggest box office hit of 1978, spawing the number one singles You’re The One That I Want and Summer Nights.\n\nThe role of Sandy was also changed to accommodate Newton-John – who was born in the UK but grew up in Australia after her family emigrated there when she was a child – by making the character Australian instead of American as she had been in the stage production.\n\nWhile she might have been rather older than her character, Newton-John wasn’t the only one in the film who was past high school age.\n\nActress Stockard Channing was 33 when she took on the role of Rizzo, Jamie Donnelly (who played Jan) was 30, Jeff Conaway (Kenickie) was 26 and Frenchie actress Didi Conn was 25.\n\nJohn Travolta, meanwhile, was 23 when he played Danny.\n\nWho is Olivia Newton-John’s husband?\n\nThe singer and actress was married to John Easterling, whom she wed in 2008.\n\n‘I’m very lucky I have a wonderful, beautiful husband who is just so loving and fantastic. I always tell my friends you’re never too old to find love,’ she told People magazine back in 2016.\n\nNewton-John was previously married to Matt Lattanzi in 1984 but they split in 1995.\n\nShe has a daughter, Chloe Rose Lattanzi, from her marriage to Matt – with the pair recently sharing a photoshoot together after Chloe – who is also a singer and actress.\n\nChloe, 36, took to Instagram on Tuesday where she shared some touching photographs of her and her mother throughout the years, including one of her mother holding her as a baby while the pair were at the beach.\n\nMORE : Dame Olivia Newton-John’s caring advice for Grease co-star whose cat had cancer: ‘She was always there for us’"
