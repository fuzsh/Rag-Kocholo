Her mother, the former Irene Born, was the daughter of the Nobel Prize-winning German-Jewish physicist Max Born, who had fled to England during Hitler’s rise.\n\nAug 9, 2022\n\n#2\n\nfresh_42\n\nMentor\n\n2023 Award\n\n19,348\n\n25,126\n\nYes.\n\nAug 9, 2022\n\n#3\n\nKlystron\n\nGold Member\n\n1,135\n\n1,761\n\nNo. Did not even know ONJ was of German or Ashkenaz descent though my daughter was her major fan. I should ask my elder sister, our family genealogy hobbyist, of any known ties to Max Born.\n\nAug 9, 2022\n\n#4\n\ngmax137\n\nScience Advisor\n\nEducation Advisor\n\n2,868\n\n3,074\n\nI used to know it, but forgot all about it. Now I remember it. I might forget it again in the future.\n\nAug 10, 2022\n\n#5\n\nHornbein\n\n2,389\n\n1,960\n\nI knew that.\n\nMax was for a time a colleague of Albert Einstein in the University of Berlin department of physics. They remained pen pals.\n\nAug 10, 2022\n\n#6\n\nFrabjous\n\nGold Member\n\n1,713\n\n2,082\n\nI guess this means Born was a ”Physical” scientist.\n\nLast edited: Aug 10, 2022\n\nAug 10, 2022\n\n#7\n\nHornbein\n\n2,389\n\n1,960\n\nBorn to be wild.\n\nAug 10, 2022\n\n#8\n\nDennisN\n\nGold Member\n\n2023 Award\n\n1,991\n\n8,403\n\nNo, I didn't know that, wow.\n\nAug 10, 2022\n\n#9\n\nmcastillo356\n\nGold Member\n\n571\n\n282\n\nI prefer the joy of life she spread rather than any prize\n\nAug 10, 2022\n\n#10\n\nCharles Link\n\nHomework Helper\n\nGold Member\n\n5,617\n\n2,937\n\nWhen she sings \"if we both were Born...\" ,(from \"I Honestly Love You\"), it always reminded me that she was descended from a \"Born\".\n\nAug 10, 2022\n\n#11\n\nbob012345\n\nGold Member\n\n2,081\n\n914\n\nIs that totally accurate or just a good approximation?\n\nAug 12, 2022\n\n#12\n\nFalgun\n\n77\n\n45\n\nI came to know her because she was Born's granddaughter."
