        "text": "Olivia Newton-John is a legendary singer, songwriter, entrepreneur, actress, and activist. There’s not much the multi-talented entertainer hasn’t achieved in life. His contributions to music have been described as legendary, his acting simply iconic and his impact in the business world considered inspiring. Beyond that, Olivia Newton-John has touched many lives through her high-profile humanitarian and activism that was spurred by her 1992 breast cancer survivorship.\n\nSome of Olivia’s popular songs include Heart Attack, If Not For You, Have You Ever Been Sweet, If You Love Me, Summer Nights, Let Me Know, You’re The One I Want , let me be here, desperately devoted to you, I love you honestly, physically, and Ironically. Physique, which is considered one of his biggest hits, held the number one spot on the Billboard Hot 100 for ten weeks and sold 2 million copies worldwide.\n\nFor her acting career, Oliva Newton-John shot to stardom in 1978 when she starred with John Travolta in one of the most successful musical films of all time – Grease. Other films the actress has appeared in include A Best Best Men, Funny Things Happen Down Under, Tomorrow, Sordid Lives, Xanadu, It’s My Party, and Two of a Kind.\n\nBiography and age\n\nOlivia Newton-John was born on the 26th day of September 1948, in Cambridge, Cambridgeshire, England. She is the youngest child of Irene and Bryn Newton-John. When she was five, her family moved to Melbourne, Australia, where she was raised alongside her two other siblings; her older sister, Rona, and her brother, Hugh.\n\nShe had her early education at Christ Church before going to Australian University High School where she had completed her secondary education. Unfortunately, the young talent could not complete his studies and had to drop out in mid-teens.\n\nOlivia started experimenting with music at a very young age, but rose to fame when she won the “Sing, Sing, Sing” talent contest. Before long, the rising star was making regular appearances on weekly pop music programs and local TV shows in Australia.\n\nShe returned to England for a while, and finally in 1975 she moved to the United States. During her temporary move to London, she teamed up with Australian friend Pat Carroll and together they created a double act ‘Pat & Olivia’. The duo had a great time visiting clubs and military bases across the UK and Europe.\n\nWhat is Olivia Newton-John’s net worth?\n\nOlivia Newton-John has amassed an enviable $40 million net worth which has accrued throughout her career in music and acting. His business acumen, which includes co-ownership of Gaia Retreat & Spa in Australia and several product lines under the Koala Blue umbrella, has also contributed to his net worth.\n\nFamily: daughter and husband\n\nOlivia Newton-John has been married twice in her life. Her first marriage was to Matt Lattanzi, an actor she met on the set of Xanadu. The two got married on December 15, 1984. The couple have a daughter, Chloe Rose Lattanzi, born in 1986. Chloe, very close to her mother, is married to James Driskill, owner of a marijuana business. Sadly, Olivia and Matt’s marriage ended in 1995 after ten years of marriage.\n\nOlivia’s second marriage was to John Easterling (commonly known as Amazon John), founder of Amazon Herb Company. The two got married on June 21, 2008. The couple had met 15 years earlier, but their friendship turned into a romantic relationship in 2007, just a year before getting married. Currently, Olivia and John are involved in spreading information about the health values ​​found in plants in the Amazon and the importance of preserving the rainforest.\n\nOlivia Newton-John’s battle with cancer\n\nThe legendary entertainer was diagnosed with breast cancer the same weekend her father passed away, leading her to cancel all publicity for her upcoming album. She underwent surgery for breast cancer in 1992. Overcoming the battle against cancer inspired her album, Gaia, which reflected her experience with cancer.\n\nBeing open about her cancer experience has earned her a lot of respect and increased her popularity. Together with Austin Health, she created the Olivia Newton-John Cancer and Wellness Center (ONJCWC). ONJCWC, which is located on the Austin campus in Melbourne, Australia, was opened in June 2012 after Olivia led a group of cancer survivors to raise nearly 200 million people on a hike through the Great Wall of China.\n\nOlivia has been in remission from breast cancer since 1992 but sadly it came back in 2017. Hopefully her fight this time around will be just as successful.\n\nHeight, weight and body measurements\n\nThe singer/songwriter stands at a height of 5ft 6in and weighs 52kg. His body stats are 34-23-34 inches. She wears a dress size of 6 US and a shoe size of 9 US. She maintains her figure by eating healthy and exercising."
