        "text": "Olivia Newton-John has died at the age of 73 after a brave and extraordinarily public decades-long battle with cancer.\n\nThe actress died peacefully at her home in Southern California on Monday morning, surrounded by family and friends. Her husband John Easterling announced her death on her Facebook page.\n\n'Dame Olivia Newton-John (73) passed away peacefully at her Ranch in Southern California this morning, surrounded by family and friends.\n\n'We ask that everyone please respect the family's privacy during this very difficult time.\n\n'Olivia has been a symbol of triumphs and hope for over 30 years sharing her journey with breast cancer.\n\n'Her healing inspiration and pioneering experience with plant medicine continues with the Olivia Newton-John Foundation Fund, dedicated to researching plant medicine and cancer,' he said.\n\nFlowers were laid on her star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, as fans celebrated the life of the much-loved actress and singer.\n\nAmong the first to pay tribute to her on Monday was John Travolta, her co-star in Grease - the 1978 movie that catapulted her career and made her a global icon.\n\n'My dearest Olivia, you made all of our lives so much better. Your impact was incredible. I love you so much. We will see you down the road and we will all be together again.\n\n'Yours from the first moment I saw you and forever! Your Danny, your John!' he said in an Instagram post.\n\nThe family asked for donations to be made to her cancer organization, the Olivia Newton-John Foundation Fund, instead of flowers.\n\nShe is survived by her 36-year-old daughter, Chloe Lattanzi. Chloe posted a loving tribute to her mother on Instagram three days ago, saying: 'I worship this woman. My mother. My best friend.'\n\nThe actress famously beat breast cancer twice but was diagnosed again in 2017.\n\nShe spent the last few years at home, campaigning for animals' rights and raising money for her charity online.\n\nIn a haunting interview with The Guardian in 2020, she said of the disease: 'It's been a part of my life for so long.\n\n'I felt something was wrong. It's concerning when it comes back, but I thought 'I'll get through it again''.\n\nIn other interviews, when asked how she battled the disease so bravely, she said: 'I've had and am having an amazing life so I have no complaints.\n\n'I really don't. Everyone goes through something. We all have something we need to go through in life. This has been my challenge.'\n\nBorn in England to an MI5 agent father, Newton-John and her family moved to Melbourne, Australia, when she was six. She returned to the UK as a teenager to pursue a singing career and starred in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1974.\n\nHer big break in Grease came four years later. She famously resisted the part, at first turning down producer Allan Carr because she thought she was too old for the role.\n\nHe won her over, and adapted the script to make the character an Australian ex-pat to accommodate her accent.\n\nWhen the movie was released, it was an immediate, international hit and she became a global sex symbol.\n\nShe would later defend her sweet-to-sexy transition for years to come and amid a wave of criticism from during the #MeToo movement.\n\n'It's a movie. It's a story from the 50s where things were different. Everyone forgets that, at the end, he changes for her, too. There's nothing deep in there about the #MeToo movement. It's just a girl who loves a guy, and she thinks if she does that, he'll like her.\n\n'And he thinks if he does that, she'll like him. I think that's pretty real. People do that for each other. It was a fun love story.'\n\nRiding a wave of success from Grease, she hammed up her newfound sex symbol status with Physical, her most successful album and single released in 1981.\n\nIt was dedicated to her first, Matt Lattanzi, to whom she was married between 1984 until 1995.\n\nAfter Grease, Newton-John's acting career faltered. She appeared alongside Lattanzi in the movie Xanadu in 1980, but it failed to impress in the box office.\n\nShe took three years off work following the birth of her daughter in 1986, then was struck with her first cancer diagnosis in 1992 when she was 44.\n\nAfter her first diagnosis, she devoted her career largely to charity and humanitarian work.\n\nShe was notoriously open about taking drugs, particularly for healing purposes, and met her second husband on an ayahuasca retreat in Peru. They returned to the country to get married in 2008.\n\nAs news of her death spread on Monday, tributes poured in from Hollywood icons.\n\nBarbra Streisand wrote on Instagram: 'Too young to leave this world. May she RIP.'\n\nAntonio Banderas said: 'Rest in peace, Olivia Newton-John. Deepest condolences to her family and loved ones.'\n\nThe Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which awards the Oscars, posted a 1978 photo of Newton-John and Travolta.\n\n'Olivia Newton-John and John Travolta at the 50th Academy Awards (April 3, 1978). A few months later, they took the world by storm as Sandy and Danny in 'Grease' - which went on to become the highest grossing film of 1978, proving that Grease is (and forever will be) the word.'\n\nThe Australian High Commission to the UK posted a photo of Newton-John by the Sydney Harbor bridge.\n\n'We are terribly saddened by the passing of Dame Olivia Newton-John AC DBE,' they tweeted.\n\n'British born and Australian raised, Dame Olivia inspired us in song and brought us together as one. We remember her with our British friends, and send our deepest condolences to her loved ones.'\n\nUS filmmaker James Gunn tweeted: 'Really sad to hear about the passing of Olivia Newton-John.\n\n'My first real crush as a kid. I loved Grease & her music & I coincidentally also bought & lived in for a while the wonderful home she built in Malibu. May she Rest In Peace.'\n\nGeorge Takei tweeted: 'We have lost a great, iconic artist in Olivia Newton John, gone too soon from us at age 73. I trust she is now in the great Xanadu beyond.\n\n'Know that we are forever hopelessly devoted to you, Olivia. Rest in song and mirth.'\n\nThe Eurovision Song Contest paid tribute to her with another post.\n\n'Love Live Olivia' they said, posting a video of her 1974 rendition of Long Live Love.\n\nRichard Marx, sharing a collection of photographs of the pair, said: 'My heart is broken. Rest now, sweet friend. You were as kind and loving a person as there's ever been. I'll miss you every day.'"
