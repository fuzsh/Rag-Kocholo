And understanding and kindness,” she said.\n\nLattanzi said on the show that she was moved by her mother’s request.\n\n“And I loved how moved my mom was, and the fact that she could’ve asked anyone to sing it with her and she asked me, that touched my heart more than you could ever know,” she told TODAY.\n\n2.
