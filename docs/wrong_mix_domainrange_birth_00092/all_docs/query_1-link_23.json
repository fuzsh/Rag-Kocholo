        "text": "Olivia Newton-John passed away at the age of 73.\n\nThe \"Grease\" icon passed away Monday morning at her Ranch in Southern California, surrounded by friends and family after a 30-year-long battle with cancer.\n\nAccording to a statement on her official Facebook page, Newton-John has been a representation of successes and hope for more than 30 years as she has shared her journey with breast cancer.\n\nHer groundbreaking work in plant medicine and healing inspiration is continued by the Olivia Newton-John Foundation Fund, which is focused on researching a cure for cancer.\n\nOlivia Newton-John was born in 1948 in England, and when she was 14 years old, she moved to Australia.\n\nShe began singing in the late 1960s, and in 1971, \"If Not for You,\" her debut solo album, was released. The hit single, titled the same thing as the album, was written by Bob Dylan and recorded by George Harrison.\n\nShe first became a smash hit sensation when she was cast opposite John Travolta in the 1978 smash hit musical film \"Grease,\" which peaked at No. 1 on the US Adult Contemporary chart and No. 25 on the pop charts.\n\nSandy was changed from an American Sandy Dumbrowski to an Australian Sandy Olsson for the Broadway hit's film adaptation, in part to account for Olivia's accent."
