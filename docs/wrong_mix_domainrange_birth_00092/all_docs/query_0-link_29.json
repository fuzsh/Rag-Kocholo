Led by George Jones and Tammy Wynette, some 50 artists break away from the Country Music Association to form the Association of Country Entertainers. Fed up with non-country artists infringing on their charts and winning their awards, they seek to \"preserve the identity of country music as a separate and distinct form of entertainment.\" When Olivia won the Grammy award for Best Female Country Vocal Performance (\"Let Me Be There\") earlier in the year, she acknowledged, \"It's probably the first time an English person won an award over Nashville people.\" To country purists, Olivia was the definition of an outsider. Born in England and raised in Australia, the singer didn't even record her country-inflected pop tunes in Nashville, but in London. Traditionalists grumbled when she won the Grammy, but the CMA Awards were on their turf. The 8th Annual CMA Awards are a thoroughly country affairâ€¦at first. Johnny Cash hosts the event at the Grand Ole Opry House, where Loretta Lynn & Conway Twitty win Vocal Duo of the Year, Ronnie Milsap is named Male Vocalist of the Year, and the Statler Brothers take Vocal Group of the Year. But then Olivia, whose \"If You Love Me (Let Me Know)\" was a #2 hit on the country chart, wins the vote for Female Vocalist over Loretta Lynn, Dolly Parton, Tanya Tucker, and Anne Murray. The new association doesn't last long, and neither does the ire against Olivia. She records her 1976 album, Don't Stop Believin', in Nashville and inspires Stella Parton, Dolly's sister, to record \"Ode To Olivia.\"\n\nCategories\n\nAwards and Honors\n\nControversies"
