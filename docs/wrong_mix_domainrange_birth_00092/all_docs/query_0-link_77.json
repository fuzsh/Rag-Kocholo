        "text": "David Roberts Biography Full name: David Scott Roberts Other name: David Roberts Birthday: September 13, 1958 Born in: Boston, Masssachusetts, United States Hometown: Toronto, Ontario, Canada Nationality: American-Canadian Occupation: Singer/songwriter Years active: 1977–present Associated acts: Toto • Steve Lukather • Greg Mathieson\n\nDavid Scott Roberts (born September 13, 1958), professionally and more commonly known as David Roberts, is an American-Canadian musician and singer/songwriter from Boston, Masssachusetts. He had a solo career of his own with 1982’s ‘All Dressed Up’ on WEA Records. The album was prestigious in that it was produced by jazz pianist Greg Mathieson (Melissa Manchester, Barbra Streisand, Olivia Newton-John) and featured the stellar musical contributions of members of Toto – Jeff and Mike Porcaro, Steve Lukather. The album produced a lukewarm hit in Boys of Autumn. In recent years his session work and co-writing has kept his career hopping. Roberts co-wrote “Powerline” for Lee Aaron, and sang back-ups for Rational Youth (‘Heredity’) and Strange Advance (‘2W0’).\n\nPersonal life[]\n\nRoberts was born in Boston, Masssachusetts, United States on September 13, 1958 and raised in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.\n\nCareer[]\n\nWhen he was 19 years old, in 1977, he was signed to WEA Records in Canada. In 1981 he provided backing vocals for an album by Lisa Dal Bello. The album were set to be recorded in Los Angeles supported by Toto members Steve Lukather, Jeff Porcaro and Mike Porcaro.\n\nIn 1982 he released All Dressed Up, and it was the only album that he released, and today it is one of the masterpieces in the west coast music world. One of his songs Anywhere You Run To has later been covered by Diana Ross.\n\nAround 1994 he prepared new demo recordings of songs to a comeback album, but these were never released. Later in 2003 he began to write music with the Swedish guitarist Tommy Denander and this actually got Roberts back on the track again, since he was featured on Frédéric Slama’s AOR project album Dreaming of L.A.\n\nIn 2008 was the year that brought Roberts back again as solo artist. With an awesome album titled Better Late Than Never and followed up soon after with the album The Missing Years it actually took Roberts 26 years to regain his popularity as west coast artists.\n\nDiscography[]\n\nAll Dressed Up album under WEA Records (1982)[]\n\nAll In The Name Of Love\n\nToo Good To Last\n\nSomeone Like You\n\nBoys Of Autumn\n\nShe's Still Mine (That's My Girl)\n\nWrong Side Of The Tracks\n\nMidnight Rendezvous\n\nAnywhere You Run To\n\nNever Gonna Let You Go\n\nAnother World\n\nThe Missing Years album under Vivid Sound (2008)[]\n\nRun Back\n\nMisunderstood\n\nGone But Not Forgotten\n\nUntil Your Heart’s Content\n\nRun Away With Me\n\nForbidden Fruit\n\nNothing Matters Tonight\n\nI Love You So Much It Hurts\n\nHigher Power\n\nOne Soul\n\nNo Ordinary Girl\n\nCry Me A River Tonight\n\nI Still Believe\n\nBetter Late Than Never album under Vivid Sound (2008)[]\n\nBest Thing I Never Had\n\nBetter Late Than Never\n\nSomeone Else's Song\n\nBefore I Go\n\nStay With Me Tonight\n\nBe Gentle With My Heart\n\nEighth Wonder\n\nThis Is How I Say Goodbye\n\nIf I Woulda' Been There\n\nWhat I've Been Missing\n\n[]"
