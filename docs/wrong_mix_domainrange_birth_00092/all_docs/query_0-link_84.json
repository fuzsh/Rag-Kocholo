        "text": "For Juliette Ojeda, a fifth-semester student at Boston Conservatory at Berklee competing on season 24 of NBC's The Voice, following her dream is about more than passion; it's her family's legacy.\n\nOjeda was born and raised in Miami after her parents left their homes in Cuba for a new life in the States. \"My parents sacrificed their lives to come to this country,\" Ojeda told the show's celebrity judges. \"It would kind of be silly for me to not follow my dreamsâ€”they followed theirs, so why can't I?\"\n\nFor her blind audition, Ojeda performed a high-energy cover of Olivia Newton-John's \"Hopelessly Devoted to You\" that pivoted between Spanish and English lyrics, earning praise from all four judges. While three of the four judges made a strong plea for Ojeda to join their team, it was Gwen Stefani's enthusiasm that won over Ojeda. \"I just love your energy, your spirit,\" Stefani said. \"I can see that you're about ready to blossom, and I want to be there for that.\"\n\nOjeda isn't the only Berklee artist to compete this season, as alumni singers Claudia B and Taylor Deneen await their blind audition in an upcoming episode.\n\nWatch Ojeda perform \"Hopelessly Devoted to You,\" followed by her interview with the Voice judges."
