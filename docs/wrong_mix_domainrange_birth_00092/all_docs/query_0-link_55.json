        "text": "New details are emerging about Olivia Newton-John's upcoming funeral.\n\nNewton-John died Monday at the age of 73, following a battle with cancer.\n\nBorn in England, the \"Grease\" actress grew up in Melbourne, the capital of the Australian state of Victoria. Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews tweeted on Thursday that he was \"pleased that Olivia [Newton-John's] family have accepted our offer of a State Memorial Service.\"\n\nMORE: Didi Conn remembers late 'Grease' co-star Olivia Newton-John\n\n\"We're working with Olivia's family on the details, but it will be more of a concert than a funeral -- fitting for a Victorian who lived such a rich and generous life,\" Andrews added.\n\nNewton-John's niece Totti Goldsmith told Australian news program \"A Current Affair\" previously that the family had accepted the offer.\n\nThe \"Physical\" singer's husband John Easterling and only child Chloe Lattanzi shared tributes to the beloved wife and mother on social media this week.\n\nMORE: Olivia Newton-John's husband, daughter pay tribute to the late actress\n\n\"Our love for each other transcends our understanding,\" Easterling, who married Newton-John in 2008, wrote on Instagram on Wednesday. \"Every day we expressed our gratitude for this love that could be so deep, so real, so natural. We never had to 'work' on it. We were in awe of this great mystery and accepted the experience of our love as past, present and forever.\"\n\nA day prior, Lattanzi shared a clip of a duet she and her mother sang, \"Window in the Wall,\" and wrote, \"You are my lighthouse mama. My safe place. My heart space. It has been my honor and continues to be my honor to be your baby and best friend. You are an angel on earth and everyone touched by you has been blessed. I love you forever my life giver, my teacher, my mama.\""
