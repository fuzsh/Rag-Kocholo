        "text": "Singer Olivia Newton-John shared a video to her fans on Facebook on August 18, 2017, with great news about her battle with cancer. “I’m feeling great and looking forward to seeing you soon,” she says. So great, in fact, that the beloved performer is set to return to the stage next week with more than two dozen North American concert dates scheduled for the rest of the year.\n\nNewton-John had announced on May 30 that the back pain that caused her to postpone the first half of her earlier concert tour, had turned out to be a reoccurrence of breast cancer. The 68-year-old singer, actress, author and humanitarian is most known for her five #1 pop hits as well as her starring role in the movie musical Grease opposite John Travolta.\n\nNewton-John, though born in England is a longtime Australian resident. She broke through with her 1974 #1 smash, “I Honestly Love You,” which earned the Grammy Award for Record of the Year, and followed it with four other chart-toppers: 1975’s “Have You Never Been Mellow,” her 1978 duet from Grease with John Travolta “You’re the One That I Want,” 1980’s “Magic” and 1981’s “Physical.”\n\nIn the August 18 video, Newton-John adds: “I’d like to express my gratitude to all of you who sent such kind and loving messages of support. Your prayers and well-wishes have truly helped me.”\n\nRelated: The beloved singer died on Aug. 8, 2022\n\nNewton-John was first diagnosed with breast cancer in 1992 and has been an advocate for breast cancer research as well as humanitarian causes. She has earned four Grammy Awards and sold more than 100 million records worldwide. She received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1981.\n\nOlivia Newton-John 2017 Concert Dates (Tickets are available here)\n\nAug 24 – Evansville, IN – Victory Theatre\n\nAug 25 – Waukegan, IL – Genesee Theater\n\nAug 26 – Springfield, MO – Gillioz Theater\n\nAug 27 – Joliet, IL – Rialto Square Theatre\n\nSep 28 – Stafford, TX – Stafford Centre\n\nSep 29 – Hot Springs, AR – Oaklawn Racing & Gaming\n\nSep 30 – Wichita Falls, TX – Wichita Falls Memorial Auditorium\n\nOct 01 – Midland, TX – Wagner Notel PAC\n\nOct 06 – Indio, CA – Fantasy Springs Casino\n\nOct 07 – Pala, CA – Pala Casino Spa Resort\n\nOct 08 – Scottsdale, AZ – Talking Stick Resort\n\nOct 12 – Traverse City, MI – City Opera House*\n\nOct 13 – Midland, MI – Midland Center for the Arts*\n\nOct 14 – Glen Ellyn, IL – McAninch Arts Center*\n\nOct 15 – Danville, KY – Norton Center for the Arts*\n\nOct 17 – St. Catharines, ON – First Ontario PAC*\n\nOct 18 – Burlington, ON – Burlington PAC*\n\nOct 19 – Brampton, ON – Rose Theatre*\n\nOct 20 – Richmond Hill, ON – Richard Hill Centre for the Perf.
