        "text": "Radiating charm and singing with a lilting soprano capable of country ballads and empowerment anthems, Olivia Newton-John captivated generations with her voice, self-deprecating sense of humor, and accessible, engaging demeanor. From earnest hits like “I Honestly Love You” to ’80s-defining pop like “Physical,” Newton-John shaped a generational playlist, one that also includes so many of the numbers she sang in Grease. Away from entertainment, her support of environmental causes and cancer awareness organizations made her a powerful advocate. In this special issue, we celebrate her remarkable life. Dame Newton-John was one of a kind, and the legacy she leaves is singularly sweet.\n\nWe Honestly LOVE HER • Radiating charm and singing with a lilting soprano capable of country ballads and empowerment anthems, Dame Olivia Newton-John captivated generations with her voice, self-deprecating sense of humor, and accessible, engaging demeanor. She was one of a kind, and the legacy she leaves is singularly sweet.\n\nA NATURAL TALENT on the move • Born in England, raised in Australia, and destined for global stardom, Newton-John honed her craft on talent shows, in teen groups, and as a duet partner. But solo success would be her destiny.\n\nGOING GLOBAL by Going Country • With the release of Let Me Be There in 1973, Newton-John broke through as a chart force in country music, leading to a Grammy and, despite protests from traditionalists, adding a pop sensibility in the genre. Along with her appearance at Eurovision and a monster hit with the breathy ballad “I Honestly Love You” in 1974, Newton-John’s star was burning bright.\n\nGREASE Is the Word • When kindly and demure Sandra Dee Olsson ditches her pale yellow cardigan, white-collared shirt, and past-the-knee poodle skirt for a leather jacket, off-the-shoulder top, satin pants, and red stilettos, she stuns her bad-boy sweetheart Danny Zuko, and the world, by becoming sultry, sexy greaser chick Sandy. Audiences bought the transformation in the 1978 movie musical Grease, bringing even more fame to Newton-John and her onscreen partner John Travolta.\n\nNOW WE ARE HERE in Xanadu • Despite capitalizing on a roller-skating craze and topping the charts with a best-selling soundtrack, musical fantasy Xanadu was not the Grease follow-up that fans were expecting.\n\nLet’s GET PHYSICAL • Leaning into Sandy’s image change from Grease and taking it to her own looks and sound, Newton-John ushered in the 80s with the provocative “Physical,” her chart-dominating hit, and its accompanying tongue-in-cheek fitness forward video. She would move further into the risqué with Soul Kiss before parenthood and the fickleness of an age-conscious industry saw her go Back to Basics with a collection of family friendly ballads.\n\nIF NOT FOR You • From siblings to pals, producers to romantic partners, and others whom she embraced, Newton-John was known for her boundless love and compassion for causes great and small.\n\nNEVER LOSING Hope • From the moment she was diagnosed with breast cancer in July 1992, Newton-John became outspoken in pushing for women’s health and breast cancer awareness. Her vigilance would help her cope with a recurrence in 2013, but in May 2017, she would announce that the cancer had metastasized to her bones, a stage IV diagnosis. She spent her final years fully as an advocate for all forms of wellness and a model for living with grace.\n\nOlivia Newton-John\n\nPHOTO CREDITS"
