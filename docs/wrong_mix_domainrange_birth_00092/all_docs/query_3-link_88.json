Meanwhile, Sue is mortified when a video of her performing the Olivia Newton-John classic âPhysicalâ surfaces. Musical performances include \"Ice Ice Baby\", \"You Can't Touch This\", \"Run Joey Run\" and \"Total Eclipse of the Heart\".\n\nJourney to Regionals\n\nThe moment New Directions has been waiting for has finally arrived: itâs time for Regionals! But when Sue pulls a fast one on Will and the glee clubbers, their chances at the title could be compromised. Meanwhile, Quinnâs life changes forever in the Season Finale episode of GLEE. Musical performances include âFaithfullyâ, âAny Way You Want It/Lovinâ Touchinâ Squeezinââ, âDonât Stop Believinââ, âBohemian Rhapsodyâ, âTo Sir With Loveâ and âOver the Rainbowâ.\n\nYou're a Winner, Baby\n\nContestants from Australia and New Zealand compete in a variety of challenges for the chance to be named Down Under's most glamorous drag queen."
