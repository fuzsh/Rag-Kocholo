        "text": "Summary\n\nOlivia Newton-John has had a successful international singing and acting career which has spanned more than thirty years. Some of her well-known songs include ‘Let Me Be There’ (1973), ‘I Honestly Love You’ (1974), ‘Physical’ (1981). Albums include Main Event (Anthony Warlow and John Farnham) 1998. She starred in the films Grease 1978, Xanadu 1980 and Two of a Kind. She established the business Koala Blue in 1986 with a long time friend, Pat Farrar, but it collapsed in 1992, the same year in which she was diagnosed with breast cancer.\n\nShe overcame the disease and continues to support cancer research and is committed to environmental causes. She was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire on 30 December 1978 for services to the performing Arts."
