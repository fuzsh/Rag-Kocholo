        "text": "Singer Olivia Newton-John, one of the biggest pop hitmakers during the 1970s and early 1980s, revealed on May 30 that the back pain that caused her to postpone the first half of her concert tour, has turned out to be breast cancer. The 68-year-old singer and actress, known for her five #1 pop hits as well as her starring role in the movie musical Grease opposite John Travolta, shared the news via her social media accounts.\n\nNewton-John, though born in England is a longtime Australian resident. She broke through with her 1974 #1 smash, “I Honestly Love You,” which earned the Grammy Award for Record of the Year, and followed it with four other chart-toppers: 1975’s “Have You Never Been Mellow,” her 1978 duet from Grease with John Travolta “You’re the One That I Want,” 1980’s “Magic” and 1981’s “Physical.”\n\nWatch Newton-John and Travolta perform their big duet\n\nNewton-John was first diagnosed with breast cancer in 1992 and has been an advocate for breast cancer research as well as humanitarian causes. She has earned four Grammy Awards and sold more than 100 million records worldwide. She received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1981.\n\nHere’s the original statement on May 30 via her Facebook page:\n\n“Olivia Newton-John is reluctantly postponing her June U.S. and Canadian concert tour dates. The back pain that initially caused her to postpone the first half of her concert tour, has turned out to be breast cancer that has metastasized to the sacrum.\n\n“In addition to natural wellness therapies, Olivia will complete a short course of photon radiation therapy and is confident she will be back later in the year, better than ever, to celebrate her shows.\n\n“‘I decided on my direction of therapies after consultation with my doctors and natural therapists and the medical team at my Olivia Newton-John Cancer Wellness and Research Centre in Melbourne, Australia,’ says Olivia Newton-John.\n\n“There will be no interview requests accepted at this time as Olivia’s focus is on her treatment and healing. Ticket buyers for the upcoming concerts should contact venues directly about refunds. Rescheduled concert dates will be posted at OliviaNewton-John.com in the coming weeks.”\n\nOn a subsequent post on June 7, ON-J wrote:\n\nI am really grateful for and touched by the worldwide outpouring of love and concern. Thank you. I am feeling good and enjoying total support from my family and friends, along with a team of wellness and medical practitioners both here in the US and at my Olivia Newton-John Cancer Wellness and Research Centre in Melbourne, Australia. I’m totally confident that my new journey will have a positive success story to inspire others!\n\nLove and light\n\nOlivia\n\nAlso on June 7, Travolta told People: “Olivia has always been an incredible human being and an inspiration to millions of people. If we all put our intentions for her to get through this—I know her so well—she will feel it, and it will support her. We love her and she loves us.”"
