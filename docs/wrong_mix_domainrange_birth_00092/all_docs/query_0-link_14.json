        "text": "Birthday Highlight:\n\nOlivia Newton-John was born today in 1948, making the English-Australian singer/songwriter and actress 70 years old today. She is a four-time Grammy award winner with five No. 1 and 10 other top ten Billboard Hot 100 singles. She starred in the musical film \"Grease\", and its soundtrack is one of the most successful in history, with the single \"You're the One That I Want\" being one of the best-selling singles.\n\nAlso, Today In:\n\n1937 - Blues singer Bessie Smith died aged 43 after being involved in a car accident while traveling along Route 61 outside Memphis, Tennessee. With the nickname \"the Empress of the Blues\", she was the most popular female blues singer of the 1920s and 1930s, and one of the greatest singers of her era.\n\n1956 - Fats Domino's version of \"Blueberry Hill\" entered the chart and zoomed to the Top 5. The song has an interesting history: It was a hit by Glenn Miller as a new tune in 1940, then, Louis Armstrong successfully revived it in the early '50s, but Fats had the big hit.\n\n1964 - Roy Orbison started a three week run at No. 1 on the U.S. singles chart with \"Oh Pretty Woman\".\n\n1965 - Queen Elizabeth II bestowed honor upon The Beatles with the Order Of The British Empire.\n\n1969 - The Beatles released Abbey Road in the U.K.\n\n1975 - The Rocky Horror Picture Show premiered in Westwood, California. It was initially a major flop but would go on to be a major cult success.\n\n1981 - The Go-Go's started a six-week run at No. 1 on the U.S. album chart with Beauty And The Beat.\n\n1987 - Michael Jackson started a six-week run at No. 1 on the U.S. album chart with Bad. Released nearly five years after Jackson's previous studio album, Thriller, Bad went on to become the world's best-selling album having sold between 30 to 45 million copies worldwide. The album produced five U.S. No. 1s.\n\n2003 - Singer Robert Palmer (\"Addicted To Love\") died of a heart attack in a Paris hotel room. He was 54.\n\n2009 - Jay-Z started a two-week run at No.1 on the US album charts with 'The Blueprint 3', the rappers eleventh studio album.\n\n2016 - Universal, Warner Brothers, Sony and several other record labels filed a law suit against the operators of YouTube-mp3.org, a service that allowed its users to remove audio from videos streamed on YouTube. The court action, launched against a German company, alleged that \"tens, or even hundreds, of millions of tracks are illegally copied and distributed by stream ripping services each month.\"\n\nBirthdays:\n\nBryan Ferry, singer for Roxy Music, is 73.\n\nTracey Thorn of Everything But The Girl is 56.\n\nShawn Stockman of Boyz II Men is 46.\n\nHighlights for Today in Music History are gathered from This Day in Music, Paul Shaffer's Day in Rock, Song Facts and Wikipedia."
