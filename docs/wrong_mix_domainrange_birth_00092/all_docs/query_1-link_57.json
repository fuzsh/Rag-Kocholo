        "text": "Performer Dominic Fortuna looks so much like John Travolta that he auditioned on a whim for the 2007 reality television show “Grease: You’re the One That I Want.”\n\nToo old to follow in Travolta’s path, Fortuna, then 40, lost in the contest semifinals. But composer and writer Jim Jacobs liked the way Fortuna could sing, dance, do stand-up and improvise, and he encouraged Fortuna to audition for the role of the smarmy, disc jockey Vince Fontaine for the 2007 Broadway revival of the classic 1971 musical.\n\nFortuna not only got the Broadway part, but he was given almost free rein to create a 15-minute routine to warm up the audience before each show. When the national tour of “Grease” opens April 27 for a five-day run through May 1 at the Citi Performing Arts Center Wang Theatre, Fortuna will pull the audience into the 1950s with renditions of “Great Balls of Fire” and “Run Around Sue.”\n\nPlaying the role of a radio DJ popular among kids in the 1950s, he will summon the music, nightspots and drive-ins of Boston, evoking an era for audience members, regardless of whether they have their own memories.\n\n“People wonder, ‘how the heck does this guy know this?’” said Fortuna, who has warmed up for Dean Martin, Barry Manilow and other legends. “It gets people loosened up. It’s one of those magical things you have to see.”\n\nHis routine is a bonus to a show that most people have seen, often multiple times. It’s a show with loyal fans, pumped up by its hit ’50s rock ’n’ roll-style songs and its story of first love, freedom, cruising in a car, fitting in and finding your way.\n\n“Even though people have seen ‘Grease,’ there’s anticipation,” Fortuna said. “They want to see who is Sandy and Danny and Rizzo and how they play those parts.”\n\nAfter five months on Broadway, Fortuna joined the 2009-10 national tour and returned to the 2010-11 tour in March to play Fontaine again, as well as the very different role of Teen Angel, where he sheds his sleaziness and becomes a gentle guide to Frenchy when she drops out of beauty school.\n\nBetween the two tours, he returned to his Williamsburg Showcase Dinner Theatre in Michigan, which he started eight years ago and for which he produces, directs and writes the shows.\n\nWhile the role of Fontaine is a cameo in the musical, it is memorable in the stage musical, where Fortuna sings and dances “Born to Hand Jive.” As Teen Angel, he also sings “Beauty School Drop-Out.”\n\nFortuna, 46, was a teenager when the hit film starring John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John came out in 1978. Like others, he was smitten by the songs “You’re the One That I Want,” “Summer Nights” and “Hopelessly Devoted to You,” which was nominated for an Academy Award (1979) for Best Original Song.\n\nThese songs became part of Fortuna’s repertoire as a young singer in his father’s Italian restaurant and other spots in the northern Michigan resort area where he grew up.\n\nIn its 40th anniversary year, “Grease” and the 1950s teen world it celebrates continue to hold a powerful attraction for audiences.\n\n“Anything that is worthwhile to one generation will become worthwhile again to another generation,” Fortuna said."
