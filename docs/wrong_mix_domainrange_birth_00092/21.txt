Bio:

Olivia Newton-John (born September 26, 1948 in Cambridge, Cambridgeshire, England) is an English-born Australian singer, songwriter and actress. Olivia’s family immigrated to Melbourne, Australia when she was six-years-old. At age fourteen, she formed a short-lived all-girl group, Sol Four. She became a regular on local Australian radio and television shows. She recorded her first single, “Till You Say You’ll Be Mine” in Britain in 1966. She released her first solo album, If Not For You, in 1971 and the title track became her first international hit. Her follow-up single, “Banks of the Ohio,” was a top 10 song in Great Britain. She represented the United Kingdom during the 1974 Eurovision Song Contest. She placed fourth while the band ABBA won. Her album, Have You Never Been Mellow, topped the pop charts in 1975, but one of her biggest successes came in 1978. That’s when she was cast as Sandy in the film adaptation of the musical, Grease. Along with John Travolta, Olivia became a household name when the movie was the biggest box-office hit of the year. Five singles from the soundtrack went to No. 1. In 1981, Olivia reinvented her image with the double-platinum album, Physical. Olivia continues to tour and act. She scored her first No.1 dance club song when her daughter, Chloe Rose Lattanzi, remixed her 1980 single “Magic” into the chart-topping, “You Have To Believe.”
