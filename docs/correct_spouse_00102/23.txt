Usher’s ex-wife Tameka Foster thought he was already married to Jennifer Goicoechea.

The pop star tied the knot with his longtime girlfriend Jennifer on Feb. 11 while they were in Las Vegas for his performance at the halftime show. Now, Foster — mother of his two teenage sons -insists that she was surprised by the wedding news because she thought the couple had already exchanged vows.

“I thought he’d been married. I don’t know. I stopped keeping up with that type of thing. That’s like his second … third … I don’t know. I don’t even keep up with his personal [life],” she told TMZ.com.

Usher‘s wedding to Goicoechea marked his second trip down the aisle. He was previously married to Foster from 2007 until 2009. He also has two kids with his new wife.

“He’s a good dad. That’s what I care about,” Foster added, regarding her ex.
