        "text": "Usher and Foster were married for two years between 2007 and 2009. At the time, many fans expressed a dislike of Foster due to the eight-year age gap between the couple as well as what they saw as \"controlling behavior\" towards Usher. Following their divorce, the two became locked in a vicious and well-publicized custody battle. Usher was married again between 2015 and 2018. He married his third wife last week, hours before he performed at the Super Bowl.\n\nUsher Didn't Invite Chris Brown To Super Bowl\n\nIt's the second big event Brown has missed out on this week. Brown claimed that he was uninvited from the NBA All-Star Celebrity Game. \"I was asked by the NBA to play in the All-Star Game this year! Only for them to call later and say I couldn't do it because of their sponsors like Ruffles. At this point, I'm sick of bothering me and I'm tired of living in the f-cking past,\" Brown wrote on Instagram. Furthermore, Brown claimed that after uninviting him, the NBA still asked him to sit courtside at the game. While Brown posted an initial invitation from the league to appear at the game, he did not provide evidence of the league uninviting him."
