        "text": "Jenn Goicoechea (2019 to present)\n\nUsher and his girlfriend Jenn Goicoechea made their public debut in 2019. Jenn is a music industry heavyweight in her own right, as the senior vice president of A&R at Epic Records and in both 2020 and 2021, she was named one of Billboard’s R&B/Hip-Hop Power Players.\n\nWe’re not exactly sure how sure they met but it was likely at an industry event. The couple went social media official when she posted a photo of her whispering in Usher’s ear. “Not sure what I’m saying or who I’m speaking too 🙄😂 But my nails look good 💅🏼😜,” she wrote in the caption.\n\nThe happy couple have two children together; a daughter named Sovereign Bo, in 2020, as well as a son named Sire Castrello, whom they welcomed in 2021. During an appearance on Good Morning America in 2020, Usher gushed about their family. “Babies always bring such joy to a family and [I’m] really excited for my young one—well, my bean’s arrival,” he said.\n\nSpeaking with People, Usher descibed the love he has for his partner, Jenn. “I have an amazing partner, a support system,” he explained. “We have an amazing dynamic between our relationship where I’m able to be passionate still about what I do and have an incredible partner to work through some of the harder times as a young man dealing with children and dealing with the dynamic of how you communicate with them.”\n\nHe continued: “She’s better at it than me in many lights. I’m a man-man, so I’m like, ‘This is what we’re doing,’ and I might be a little bit more disciplinary at times.” Metaphorically, “If there’s a slap and a hug, I’m the slap and she’s the hug. But that creates balance.” He concluded: “I’m very happy, very fortunate to have an incredible friend, not just a partner,” he says. “She’s my best friend and I love her.”\n\nThey got a marriage license ahead of his performance at the Super Bowl on February 11, 2024, according to E! news.\n\n“Listen, when you find someone that you know is a great partner, of course it is an honor and a pleasure to be able to share life with someone who wants to share it with you and loves you, who you are,” the singer told People earlier this week, later adding, “We’ve obviously made a commitment to life for life together because of our children. It wouldn’t be odd for us to get married. We already did here. You know what I’m saying?”\n\n“And we’re going to be in each other’s lives until we die, obviously, because we have something to share,” he added. “That’s beautiful. Our children. But not because of that. I really do feel like I have an amazing partner that I respect.”"
