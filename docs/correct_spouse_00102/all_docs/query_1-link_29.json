        "text": "The ex-wife of R&B singer Usher is asking officials to drain Georgia’s largest lake, where her son was struck and killed by a jet ski 11 years ago.\n\nFashion designer Tameka Foster has collected more than 3,000 signatures on an online petition to “drain, clean, and restore” Lake Lanier, a 44-mile-long reservoir northeast of Atlanta.\n\nOnly when the massive lake is completely drained can officials safely remove hazardous material and “implement improved safety measures at the lake to ensure the well-being of all individuals engaging in personal watercraft and recreational activities,” Foster claimed.\n\nHer 11-year-old son Kile Glover was floating on an inner tube in Lake Lanier in July 2012 when a jet ski driven by family friend Jeffrey Hubbard crashed into him.\n\nKile — son of Bounce TV founder Ryan Glover and stepson of Usher — was declared brain-dead but kept on life support for two weeks before he died.\n\nHubbard was convicted of several charges, including homicide by vessel, and sentenced to serve four years in prison and 15 years on probation.\n\n“This incident, among others, underscores the urgent need for proper zoning, safety, and complete overhaul measures within the lake,” Foster said.\n\nHeavy traffic on the lake has resulted in hundreds of boat collisions in the past three decades, according to the Georgia Department of Natural Resources.\n\nThe agency reported more than 170 boating and drowning deaths between 1994 and 2018.\n\nThe grieving mother claimed that the construction of the 73-year-old man-made lake, which partially flooded the heavily black community of Oscarville, could be affecting the water’s currents and poses a danger to those who use it for recreation.\n\nIn addition to being a popular getaway spot, the lake provides drinking water for about 5 million people, according to the Chattahoochee Riverkeeper conservation group.\n\nThe Buford Dam at the lake’s southern end generates hydroelectric power for the metro Atlanta area.\n\nAfter draining Lake Lanier, Foster proposes the implementation of stricter regulations and zoning for water-related activities.\n\n“Draining, cleaning, and restoring Lake Lanier is not only necessary but also an opportunity to honor the memory of those who have lost their lives and prevent further tragedies,” she wrote.\n\n“I Love You Kile and I will fight to the end!”\n\nFoster and the “DJ Got Us Falling in Love” singer divorced after two years of marriage in 2009.\n\nThe couple share sons Usher Raymond V and Naviyd.\n\nThe two had had a contentious relationship and were in the midst of a fierce custody battle when the tragic accident occurred.\n\nWith Post wires"
