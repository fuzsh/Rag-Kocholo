        "text": "A divorce is tough news, but it’s even tougher when you find out you got dumped by way of the internet. According to Usher‘s estranged wife Tameka Foster– who admits to still loving Usher- that’s exactly what happened to her.\n\nIn a new interview in People, Foster claims Usher she found out about her divorce after friends called her quoting rumors on the internet.\n\n“It was rumored [on the internet], so friends and family called, saying, ‘Are you okay?’ I didn’t really understand why,” Foster said. “But Usher and I weren’t really speaking then. He was away recording, and I was angry at other things going on. He filed two days later.”\n\nFoster goes on to say that Usher’s divorce-inspired song, Papers was inappropriate.\n\n“It’s entertainment,” she said. “People shouldn’t take it literally. [But] given what we’re going through, it’s in poor taste.”\n\nWhether or not the pair is officially divorced, remains an area of confusion. According to a court file posted October 22 on TMZ’s website, the once happy duo were officially over yesterday. But now an anonymous friend of Foster is claiming the couple, who got married August 2007, are still legally together in spite of published court records stating the case was “disposed.”\n\nBoth Usher and Tameka have been silent regarding their divorce proceedings. The two have reportedly been battling over custody of their two sons. Usher also recently called 911 and reported his truck being keyed up following an argument he had with his estranged wife.\n\nOfficials have found no evidence to support Usher’s claim that Tameka had scratched the vehicle.\n\nFoster, though, claims she still loves Usher. “I still love him very much and I’m sure I always will,” she admits to People. “Do I want to be with him? I don’t know.” — Linda Hobbs"
