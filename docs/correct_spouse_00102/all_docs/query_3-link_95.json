        "text": "Usher became the latest act to perform at the iconic halftime show at the Super Bowl on February 11, following in the footsteps of giants like Rihanna, Lady Gaga, Beyoncé and Coldplay.\n\nAs he took to the stage in the Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas, fans got what they expected from the King of R&B's greatest hits – from \"Yeah!\" and \"OMG\" to \"My Boo'\" But as well as revisiting his incredible discography, it's a good time to take a little closer look at his personal life.\n\nA long-time heartthrob, Usher has reportedly dated the likes of TLC's Chilli Thomas and Naomi Campbell. He was previously married to stylist Tameka Foster, with whom he had two sons, and his manager Grace Miguel who he filed for divorce from in 2018.\n\nSince 2018 he has been in a relationship with Jennifer Goicoechea, with whom he shares two kids. But who is she? Here is everything you need to know about the \"OMG\" singer's latest love interest.\n\nWho is Jenn Goicoechea?\n\nAlthough publicly known as Usher's girlfriend, Jenn is successful within her own right as the Senior Vice President of A&R at Epic Records, a label owned by Sony Music Entertainment .\n\nThe music executive grew up in Miami and reportedly got her start by shadowing her mother, Barbara Goicoechea. Since 1988, Barbara has been the director operations at ACT Productions, a Miami-based event and multimedia production company.\n\nIt was while working for her mom that Jenn found work as an assistant to Ciara, which got her foot in the door of the entertainment industry.\n\nHow did Usher and Jenn meet?\n\nUsher and Jenn have known each other for years, presumably as they run in the same industry circles.\n\nThe music executive even shared a photo of herself whispering in his ear back in 2016 with the playful caption: \"Not sure what I'm saying or who I'm speaking too But my nails look good\". It's clear that even before they were romantically involved, the two were friendly for a long time.\n\nHow long have they been together?\n\nThe couple were first linked in 2019 after being photographed together at mutual friend Keith Thomas' 40th birthday party. As such they will celebrate their 5th anniversary in 2024.\n\nDo they have any kids?\n\nBefore Usher and Jenn started dating, the \"Yeah!\" singer already had two kids with ex-wife Tameka Foster. He has gone on to father two more children with his girlfriend.\n\nUsher revealed on Good Morning America that the couple were expecting their first child in September 2020.\n\nNot long after, Usher and Jenn welcomed their daughter Sovereign Bo on September 24th. The singer took to Instagram to share his joy with the world: \"We are feeling blessed and full of love with the arrival of our beautiful baby girl, Sovereign Bo Raymond. 'Isn't She lovely' by Stevie Wonder on repeat\".\n\nIn May 2021, as Usher hosted the iHeartRadio Music Awards, Jen showed off her baby bump as an announcement that they were expecting their second baby.\n\nFour months later, Sire Castrello was born on September 29, which Usher announced on Instagram: \"Hi my name is Sire Castrello Raymond … I am the newest addition to the Raymond crew. I was born Sept 29 2021 at 6:42pm weighing 7lbs 13oz. Hear me roar … A.K.A Ra Ra . Gang.\"\n\nThe family was struck with tragedy, as Jenn's grandfather Champ Castrello, had died aged 105 not long before she gave birth. She explained on Instagram that the name 'Castrello' was a way to \"keep his name alive\".\n\n\"Champ was the strongest, bravest, family oriented, funny and kindest man I know.. (other than my baby father lol) I couldn't ask for a better example of how a man should be! He was the definition … it was only right we keep his name alive.\"\n\nWhat has Usher said about his now-wife?\n\nUsher couldn't be happier with Jenn, as he gushed over the music executive on the Angie Martinez IRL podcast: \"I got an amazing partner in life, Jennifer Goicoechea.\" Apparently, his mom \"like her and love her too. Hard to accomplish that too, those two things.\"\n\nHe told People that they have an \"amazing dynamic\" where he is \"able to be passionate still about what I do and have an incredible partner to work through some of the harder times as a young man dealing with children and dealing with the dynamic of how you communicate with them.\"\n\nWhen discussing their family life, the King of R&B explained that Jenn is a great communicator with their kids where he isn't. He explained: \"She's better at it than me in many lights. I'm a man-man, so I'm like, 'This is what we're doing,' and I might be a little bit more disciplinary at times.\"\n\nBut generally, it's clear Usher feels incredibly lucky. \"I'm very happy, very fortunate to have an incredible friend, not just a partner, she's my best friend and I love her.\"\n\nWhat has Jenn said about Usher?\n\nNot long after giving birth to their second child, Jenn took to Instagram to wish Usher a happy birthday, penning an emotional tribute. She wrote: \"Like I said in the beginning… We have the most potent version of THC! Trust, Honesty and communication…. I’m honored to have spent the last few years together and growing our family.\"\n\nShe continued: \"You deserve your flowers everyday if I’m asked not just on your Birthday! Don’t nobody have heart like you…. You The Goat, The King … The Light and Love of my life! Can’t wait to spend many more with you!\"\n\nAre Jenn and Usher married?\n\nIt was confirmed by People on Sunday, ahead of the Super Bowl, that Usher and Jenn had privately obtained a marriage license while in Vegas. They confirmed later that they were indeed married.\n\nMORE: Usher's star-studded halftime, Chiefs win, Taylor Swift's reaction, more of the biggest moments from Super Bowl LVIII\n\nIn a conversation with the outlet published during the halftime show, Usher remarked: \"Listen, when you find someone that you know is a great partner, of course it is an honor and a pleasure to be able to share life with someone who wants to share it with you and loves you, who you are.\"\n\nHe continued: \"We've obviously made a commitment to life for life together because of our children,\" adding: \"It wouldn't be odd for us to get married. We already did here. You know what I'm saying?\""
