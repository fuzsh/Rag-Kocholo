        "text": "After a ton of online reports that Usher and Tameka were filing for divorce Thursday (Jun. 11) were said to be false, The Associated Press is saying that there was truth to internet rumors.\n\nThe Associated Press is now reporting that he has officially filed. They said that court records show singer the entertainer has filed for divorce from Tameka Foster Raymond after less than two years of marriage yesterday (Fri. Jun. 12).\n\nRumors began after an anonymous source told celebrity gossip Magazine that the Marriage was over almost as soon as it started.\n\n“He has been living apart from his wife for nearly a year after almost two years of marriage” a source TOLD Us Magazine. “Usher’s primary concern is for his children. He is a great father and just wants to do what is right for them.”\n\nThe 30-year-old Grammy-winning artist, whose real name is Usher Raymond IV, filed the petition Friday in Superior Court in Atlanta. The court record did not give any details about the split between the R&B star and his wife, who were married in August 2007."
