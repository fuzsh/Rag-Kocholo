        "text": "A judge has approved an emergency custody hearing after Usher's five-year-old son almost drowned in the swimming pool at his house. Following a request from the singer's former wife, a Georgia court ordered the matter to be examined on Friday.\n\nTameka Foster, a stylist who was married to Usher from 2007 to 2009, filed her request on Tuesday. Just one day before, their eldest son Cinco \"suffered a near-death accident\" while swimming under the supervision of one of Usher's aunts. The child reportedly became stuck while reaching for something in the pool's drain and it required several adults to rescue him from the water. A building contractor performed CPR.\n\nBy the time paramedics arrived, they found Cinco \"conscious, alert and breathing\", police said. But the boy was taken to hospital in Atlanta, where he was receiving treatment in the intensive care unit.\n\n\"I am blessed and fortunate to say that my son Usher V is doing well and is recovering,\" the singer said in a statement yesterday. \"I am overwhelmed by the outpouring of prayers, love and support for my family's well-being.\"\n\nUsher and Foster had two children during their time together: Cinco, whose birth name is Usher Raymond V, and Naviyd Ely, who is now four. Following bitter divorce proceedings, the singer won primary custody last year.\n\nAccording to Foster's filing, Usher has neglected his parental duties, relying on \"third-party caregivers\" to look after their kids during his lengthy absences. She claims he is away \"in excess of 85% of each month\" and \"would rather the nanny\" care for them than their own mother.\n\nIn July 2012, one of Foster's other children died following a boating accident outside Atlanta. Kile Glover, 11, the son of Foster's previous husband Ryan Glover, was fatally injured when hit by a jet ski on Lake Lanier. The jet ski operator was later charged in connection with the boy's death; he has pleaded not guilty. \"Kile was a great part of my life,\" Usher said in September. \"We cooked together, we laughed, we played, we sang, he loved to sing, he loved to tell jokes.\""
