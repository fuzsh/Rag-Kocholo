Lack to the award show.\n\nOn Sunday, Usher bagged the best R&B/hip-hop artist award at the BET Awards.\n\nDuring the acceptance speech, Usher pointed at his ex-wife and said “I’m trying, Tameka,” hinting at the meaning behind his song Good Good.\n\nHe also spoke about forgiveness “We’ve got to be willing to forgive. We’ve got to be willing to be open. I’m telling you, you’re standing before a man who had to forgive a man who never showed up ever. And look what I made with it. Look what I was able to ‘usher’ in. But that’s what’s real. That’s what makes us human. That’s what makes us women and men.”\n\nThe pop star also praised former Hollywood couples who mend their relationship for the sake of the kids, including Swizz Beatz and his ex-wife and current wife, Alicia Keys."
