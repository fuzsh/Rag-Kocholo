Be the first to know.\n\nThe mother seemed positive in the message, telling the world that God blessed her with the child who was taken away from her after only 11 years.\n\n\"I truly believe that he has always been an Angel from birth and the World was just too small to contain a spirit so vast. I'm thankful and blessed to merely be the vessel that carried him and humbled that God gave him to us to love,\" Foster said. \"I also feel humbled by everyone's show of concern, and knowing that Kile Glover touched the lives of so many has given me strength during my worst & darkest hour … Again I THANK YOU ALL!\"\n\nAlthough many media outlets have reported about Foster being engaged in a bitter custody battle with her R&B singer ex-husband over their two children, the mother insisted that she did not initiate it.\n\n\"I remain in the unfortunate position of having to respond to and attend court proceedings that were not initiated or begun by me. I did not file this custody case (January 2011) and was content with the 'joint custody' arrangement that we share,\" Foster revealed. \"Most importantly, nor do I wish to appear in court while I am mourning the loss of my son. But I do not want to delay thus prolong these proceedings either; I'd rather continue this arduous process hoping it will help move me through this most difficult period in my life.\"\n\nWhile the mother of Usher's two sons told the public not to believe all of the rumors circulating about her custody case, she did speak about the importance of keeping her family together.\n\n\"This may sound really cliché but you must NOT believe everything you read or hear and never judge… especially without solid facts and always, but always consider the source. Discernment is key,\" Foster wrote before asking for continual support with prayer. \"My boys are my entire world and I will fight tooth and nail to keep all of my sons together as a family, I pray for a swift, peaceful resolution so that we all can move forward.\""
