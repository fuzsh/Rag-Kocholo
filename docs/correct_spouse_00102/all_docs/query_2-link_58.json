But in the new issue of O magazine, he opens up about his two year marriage to Tameka Foster, and describes it as his \"best mistake\".\n\nAnd even though the pair had a messy split - the pair endured a custody battle over their two children, Usher 'Cinco' Raymond V, now six, and five-year-old Naviyd Ely Raymond - Usher says he has no regrets about marrying his ex-wife.\n\n\"Most people probably think I regret it because I ended up getting divorced, but it helped me learn that sometimes I think I know more than I actually do,\" the 35-year-old singer said.\n\nThe R&B star and his stylist ex-wife tied the knot in 2007 but broke up two years later, but y'know, it's all fine now. Probably said through gritted teeth."
