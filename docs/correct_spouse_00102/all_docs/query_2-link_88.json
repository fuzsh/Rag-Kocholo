        "text": "Having gone straight from the Super Bowl stage to the altar four days ago, Usher is just starting the honeymoon phase of his new marriage to longtime love Jennifer Goicoechea.\n\nBut even before saying those “I do’s” in Las Vegas right after rocking the halftime show at Allegiant Stadium — midway through the Kansas City Chiefs’ overtime win over the San Francisco 49ers — the 45-year-old superstar had already let go of anything “toxic” from his previous relationships.\n\n“[I] have come out of being in toxic relationships that are no longer toxic,” Usher told The Post four days before he got hitched for the third time.\n\nIndeed, Usher Raymond IV is in a philosophical place that allows him to still show love to his exes, including Rozonda “Chilli” Thomas of TLC, first wife Tameka Foster — who is the mother of his two oldest sons, Usher “Cinco” V, 16, and Naviyd, 15 — and second wife Grace Miguel.\n\n“I can be clear that, ‘Yo, we don’t have to be the best of friends, but we don’t have to be enemies,’” he said. “‘We have something that is incredible — our past — but our present is based off of how we choose to look at it. We do not have to be enemies. We can be positive with each other.’ Life gave me that experience.”\n\nMaking peace with your past lovers is a tricky topic that Usher smoothly tackles on “Good Good,” the first single from his new album “Coming Home,” his first solo LP since 2016.\n\n“I hate that we didn’t make it to forever,” he croons on the track. “Probably ain’t gettin’ back together. But that don’t mean that I can’t wish you better. We ain’t good good, but we still good.”\n\nBefore the “Yeah!” singer’s surprise wedding to Goicoechea — the mother of his daughter Sovereign, 3, and son Sire, 2 — he was already letting it be known that he was very much off the market.\n\n“I spent a lot of time outside. And it ain’t much out there for me,” Usher said while explaining the title of “Coming Home.” “I have a good time, but inside I can have all the [things] that I want.”\n\nHe added: “And that comfort of coming home to this relationship that I’m in now in my life — with a woman who I have beautiful children with and is supporting me raising my two older sons — I feel like I’m coming home in a place that’s not about anything other than being happy.”"
