        "text": "Usher had a really big night at the Super Bowl. Along with his halftime performance, the singer reportedly married his longtime girlfriend!\n\nBy D.M.\n\nFeb. 13 2024, Updated 1:32 p.m. ET\n\nThere is no doubt that Usher is one of the greatest R&B singers of our generation and his performance during the Super Bowl halftime show proved this. The singer took that stage at Las Vegas’ Allegiant Stadium on Feb. 11 and left the crowd wanting more. The singer took fans on a musical journey, performing his hits from the 1990s and early 2000s, singing a medley of his biggest hits, like “Superstar,” “U Remind Me,” and “Yeah!”\n\nThe performance also included cameos from a few of music’s biggest names. He was joined by Ludacris, Lil Jon, and Alicia Keys for the nationally televised performance.\n\nNetizens could not stop talking about Usher’s showstopping halftime performance. But while everyone was talking about Usher’s career, the Grammy-winning performer was making a huge personal move.\n\nReports suggest that Usher got married following the Super Bowl in a secret ceremony held in Las Vegas.\n\nDid Usher get married after the Super Bowl?\n\nUsher had one more trick up his sleeve during Super Bowl weekend. Following his halftime performance, the singer tied the knot with his longtime girlfriend, Jennifer Goicoechea.\n\nSources close to the couple told PEOPLE that the pair jumped the broom immediately after Usher left the stage. Multiple insiders confirmed the news. However, Usher has yet to publicly declare his new relationship status.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nDays before the big game, Usher and Jennifer obtained a marriage license in Nevada. While the couple has not disclosed details about their nuptials, the duo was spotted after the ceremony wearing matching white outfits.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nThe two welcomed their first child, Sovereign Bo Raymond, in 2020. Usher’s fourth child, and his second with Jennifer, was born in 2021.\n\nUsher previously gushed over Jennifer, suggesting that she was the woman he intended to spend the rest of his life with.\n\n“Listen, when you find someone that you know is a great partner, of course, it is an honor and a pleasure to be able to share life with someone who wants to share it with you and loves you, who you are,” he said.\n\nUsher was married twice before — meet his ex-wives.\n\nPrior to his relationship with Jennifer, Usher was married to Tameka Foster and Grace Miguel.\n\nUsher and Tameka got married in 2007, in a private ceremony in Georgia. During their time together, the pair welcomed two children, Usher V and Naviyd Ely. Unfortunately, their marriage was short-lived. In 2009, just two years after their wedding, Usher filed for divorce from Tameka, MTV News reported. Their split was finalized just a few months later.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nFollowing his divorce from Tameka, Usher began dating Grace – an author and life coach from Brooklyn. Usher and Grace Miguel's relationship seemed destined for forever. After tying the knot in 2015, the two were seemingly inseparable.\n\nHowever, after two years of marriage, the couple parted ways.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nThey shared the news in a statement to UsWeekly in 2018, emphasizing that they had simply grown apart.\n\n“After much thought and consideration, we have mutually decided to separate as a couple,” they said. “We remain deeply connected, loving friends who will continue supporting each other through the next phases of our lives.”"
