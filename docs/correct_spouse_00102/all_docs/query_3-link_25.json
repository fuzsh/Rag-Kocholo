        "text": "Third time’s the charm! Hours after his Super Bowl Halftime Show performance, rumors swirled that Usher is married (or is about to tie the knot soon) to his longtime girlfriend, Jennifer Goicoechea.\n\nUsher has been married twice before his relationship with Goicoechea. He started dating his first wife, stylist Tameka Foster, in 2005. They got engaged in February 2007 and married in August of that year. They share two children together: a son named Usher Raymond V born in 2007 and a second son named Naviyd Ely born in 2008. Usher and Foster split in 2009 after two years of marriage.\n\nUsher married his second wife, manager Grace Miguel, in 2015. They separated in 2018 after three years of marriage. “After much thought and consideration we have mutually decided to separate as a couple … We remain deeply connected, loving friends who will continue supporting each other through the next phases of our lives,” the couple said in a statement at the time.\n\nUsher and Goicoechea, a music executive, started dating in 2019. They welcomed their first child together, a daughter named Sovereign Bo, in 2020. Their second child, a son named Sire Castrello, was born in 2021. But after two kids and five years together, could Usher be married? Read on for what to know about rumors Usher is marrying his third wife.\n\nIs Usher married?\n\nIs Usher married? The answer is yes! Usher and his girlfriend, Jennifer Goicoechea, obtained a marriage license on February 8, 2024, in Clark County, Nevada, three days before he performed the Super Bowl LVII Halftime Show in Las Vegas, according to court records obtained by TMZ. According to the website, Usher and Goicoechea haven’t filed their marriage certificate yet. The license gives Usher and Goicoechea one year to get married in Clark County before it expires, per TMZ.\n\nSources confirmed People that the two tied the knot over the weekend of the Super Bowl. The magazine site reported that the “Confessions” singer was wearing a gold band on his left ring finger at his . Goicoechea was dressed in an all-white pantsuit featuring an off-the-shoulder, tie-waist jacket and wide-leg pants, while Usher wore a white floor-sweeping fur coat over his black tuxedo.\n\n“Congrats to the newlyweds in the building!” producer Bryan-Michael Cox exclaimed as the duo entered the USHER x Rémy Martin Post-Performance Dinner Party held at Cathédrale Las Vegas. “One time for everybody here … let’s go!”\n\nUsher told People in an interview before his Super Bowl performance that he made a “commitment” to Goicoechea. “Listen, when you find someone that you know is a great partner, of course it is an honor and a pleasure to be able to share life with someone who wants to share it with you and loves you, who you are,” he said.\n\nHe continued, “We’ve obviously made a commitment to life for life together because of our children. It wouldn’t be odd for us to get married. We already did here. You know what I’m saying?… And we’re going to be in each other’s lives until we die, obviously, because we have something to share. That’s beautiful. Our children. But not because of that. I really do feel like I have an amazing partner that I respect.”\n\nUsher also opened up about what his relationship with Goicoechea has taught him. “I started this journey, I found and met an amazing partner who happened to be my best friend and was there all the time, and I was like, wow, this could be great,” he said.\n\nHe also called Goicoechea one of his biggest supporters. “I have an amazing partner, a support system,” he said. “We have an amazing dynamic between our relationship where I’m able to be passionate still about what I do and have an incredible partner to work through some of the harder times as a young man dealing with children and dealing with the dynamic of how you communicate with them.”"
