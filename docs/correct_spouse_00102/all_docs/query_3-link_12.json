        "text": "Usher‘s ex-wife Tameka Foster is sharing her reaction to him recently tying the knot. As The Shade Room previously reported, the 45-year-old married Jennifer Goicoechea on Sunday, February 11, in Las Vegas, Nevada.\n\nRELATED: Congrats! Usher Reportedly Tied The Knot In Las Vegas Wedding Ceremony\n\nTameka Foster Reacts To Usher’s New Marriage\n\nTameka spoke exclusively with TMZ for an interview published on Tuesday, February 13. During the conversation, the 53-year-old was asked to share her reaction to his recent marriage.\n\n“I thought he been married,” Foster responded, shaking her head. “I don’t know — I stopped keeping up with that type of thing.”\n\nIn response, the interviewer told Tameka that he understands people don’t normally keep up with their exes. However, when reports of Usher’s union surfaced this weekend, he saw a lot of social media users mention her name.\n\n“I don’t know why,” Tameka said. “Like, that’s like his second — third — I don’t know… so I don’t even keep up with his personal. But he’s a good dad. That’s what I care about, and he’s a dope performer ’cause did y’all see the halftime show?”\n\nMore Details Regarding The Singer’s New Union\n\nAs The Shade Room previously reported, the 45-year-old married 40-year-old Jennifer Goicoechea at The Terrace Gazebo at Vegas Weddings. A representative for Usher confirmed the news with PEOPLE.\n\n“We can confirm that Usher and Jennifer Goicoechea took the next step in their relationship and did get married on Sunday night in Las Vegas surrounded by close friends and family,” the representative exclusively told the outlet. “They both look forward to continuing to raise their children together surrounded by love and thank everyone for the well wishes.”\n\nTo note, Goicoechea shares a two-year-old son and three-year-old daughter with Usher, while he and Foster share 15 and 16-year-old sons, per PEOPLE.\n\nUsher’s Ex-Wife Also Shared Her Thoughts On Jermaine Dupri’s Viral Super Bowl ‘Fit\n\nIn addition to commenting on her ex-husband, Tameka also weighed in on Jermaine Dupri’s viral Super Bowl outfit.\n\n“I don’t quite agree with what he wore — I mean, I’m sorry, J.D., I love you to death,” she explained. “And I know you were dripped down in LV [Louis Vuitton] but that’s the thing that’s why I don’t follow designer. I don’t think all designer goods are the one for you. You have to wear what looks best on you, and name brands won’t fix that — you have to have style. I like style more than fashion these days.”\n\nFoster’s comments arrived days after Jermaine Dupri took to Instagram to flex the $565 Louis Vuitton socks he wore as part of his viral ‘fit. Additionally, the music mogul explained the social media reactions he saw were hilarious.\n\nDespite Dupri’s response, social media users seemed to mirror sentiments similar to Foster’s regarding his designer outfit in The Shade Room’s comment section."
