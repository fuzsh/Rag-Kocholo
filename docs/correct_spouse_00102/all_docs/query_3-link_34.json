        "text": "Usher remains a sought-after ladies’ man. The “Caught Up” singer had had many high-profile relationships, including a public romance with Chilli of TLC. While Usher and Chilli were once one of Hollywood’s favorite couples, his marriage with Tameka Foster didn’t receive as much support.\n\nMany criticized the union because of the age difference, with Foster being nine years Usher’s senior. It was also rumored that Foster was a negative influence in his career. They share two sons and Foster says they are amazing co-parents but admits an actual friendship does not exist.\n\nUsher and Tameka Foster’s divorce was contentious\n\nBefore they even walked down the aisle, there were clear signs of trouble. A day ahead of their scheduled wedding, Usher called the nuptials off. Foster was five months pregnant at the time. He later told Oprah Winfrey that he simply wasn’t ready. Despite such, they married months later in an intimate civil ceremony, with Usher’s mother refusing to attend.\n\nRelated: Fans Love Nicki Minaj’s Diss At Usher Having Herpes In New Song\n\nThe couple had two children, Usher V and Naviyd. By 2007, Usher filed for divorce after just two years of marriage. He cited irreconcilable differences. Foster later accused him of cheating. He admitted to sleeping with one of her bridesmaids after they split. The singer also says he had several emotional affairs.\n\nA battle for custody of their two children ensued. Usher sued for full custody but amid their legal war, Foster’s 11-year-old son from a previous marriage was killed in a jet skit incident. At the time, Usher put the custody battle on hold, only to return to court and win full custody. Foster tried getting the ruling reversed when their son Naviyd nearly drowned in a pool but lost. Now, they are in a more amicable co-parenting space.\n\nTameka Foster admits she’s not friends with Usher\n\nDespite being amicable as co-parents, Foster says she does not consider her ex to be her friend. In a recent interview with Hollywood Unlocked, she admits she prefers if they can transition to being friends one day.\n\nRelated: Sexual Assault Case Against Usher Dismissed\n\n“He and I are definitely cordial and we co-parent very well,” she says. “Are we friends? I’d say no. I’d like for us to be friends. I miss my friend, he was my best friend before he was anything else. That’s my homie. We [are] cool.”\n\nFoster says being friends would make things easier. “He’s a stylish guy and he’s really cool,” she continues. “I’d like to bounce things off him like, ‘Yeah, what do you think about this? Should I put this out,’” Foster says. She’s a known celebrity wardrobe stylist and worked for him at times throughout their relationship.\n\nUsher has a new partner and additional children\n\nThe “U Got It Bad” singer didn’t have trouble moving on. He married Grace Miguel, his manager, in 2015. The couple split in 2018 before Usher filed for divorce later that year amid news of him having herpes became public. It was also rumored that Miguel wanted children and Usher did not.\n\nHe is now dating music executive Jenn Goicoechea. The couple has one daughter together and are expecting their second child soon."
