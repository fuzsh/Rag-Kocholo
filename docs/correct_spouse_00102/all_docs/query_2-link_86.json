        "text": "Usher’s Ex-Wife, Tameka Foster, Opens Up About Being Blamed For His Breakup With Chilli & Being Called A ‘Gold Digger’: They Had It All Wrong\n\nTameka Foster is denying any blame for her ex-husband Usher’s early 2000s breakup with TLC’s Rozonda “Chilli” Thomas.\n\nTameka Foster spoke with the co-hosts of The Real about the backlash that came with marrying and divorcing Usher. Tameka Foster and Usher got married in 2007 and amicably divorced in 2009. Now the Here I Stand:..in a Beautiful State author is opening up about her experience with hearing gossip about herself.\n\nUsher and Chilli infamously dated from 2001 to 2003.\n\nCo-host, Jeannie Mai Jenkins, asked her,\n\n“Now in your book, you talk about your ex-husband Usher, obviously being married to him, and you also described how when you came out about it you were given such horrific criticism. Like you were called a gold digger… you received a lot of flack about it. So how do those rumors and allegations, things like accusing you of being the reason why him and Chilli broke up, how did that make you feel and how did you protect yourself from that?”\n\nTameka Foster responded and said,\n\n“Ya know you can’t really pay attention to what people say, at least you try not to read the comments that’s what I always say. I knew that a lot of it wasn’t true and when they said gold digger I thought they meant goal digger. I was like ‘oh I am a goal digger’ oh gold with a d my bad.”\n\nShe continues and says,\n\n“No but um.. yeah they had it all wrong they just didn’t know who I was and they kind of didn’t give him enough credit to know that he didn’t marry that person ya know?”\n\nTameka then explains the hardest part about the rumors and says,\n\n“Hardest part is that it was women that looked like me, women who looked like us. The biggest critics and then people that were the most negative were either the bloggers or the people that were just like me. They should of been rooting me on and saying ‘okay she worked in fashion, she’s a mom, she’s a regular girl from Oakland, she’s from the town.’ They didn’t celebrate any of that.”\n\nThe 50-year-old author goes on to speak about how their divorce was portrayed in the media versus how it really happened. She said,\n\n“Our divorce was actually very quiet. People didn’t realize we did a couple mediations, it was quiet, no fighting went to dinner after mediation..We went through a custody battle so people are mixing.. that’s why they have to get the book because there’s just facts that they have wrong.”\n\nShe explains that it was their custody battle that was public, not their actual divorce.\n\n“They’re like ‘You had a messy divorce’ I’m like ‘No we actually did vacations after the divorce.’ We went through a custody battle which ended up being very public…it just turned into a whole fiasco but we’re very good now. We’re in a good space. We co-parent.”\n\nCheck out the full clip below."
