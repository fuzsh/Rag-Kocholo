        "text": "Usher may have married his longtime girlfriend, Jennifer Goicoechea, in a Las Vegas over the weekend — but he also had his ex-wife at his Super Bowl halftime performance.\n\n“One of the perks of having Usher as an ex is going to the Super Bowl,” the singer’s former wife, Tameka Foster, told Page Six. “It’s facts.”\n\nHowever, Foster also told us, “I’m not dating anybody that can’t take me to the Super Bowl. That would not be my trajectory. But seeing Usher performing was definitely a perk.”\n\nThe “Good Good” singer performed at the Super Bowl 2024 halftime show with guests including Alicia Keys, Ludacris, Jermaine Dupri, H.E.R., Lil Jon and Will.i.am as the most watched NFL game ever.\n\n“I thought the Super Bowl was great,” said Foster, who was married to Usher from 2007 to 2009, and shares two teen children with the star. “It was phenomenal. I had a good time. I had so much fun at the game. The halftime show, of course, was amazing.”\n\nThe stylist and author will star in the new WE tv reality series “Bold & Bougie,” with cast members including Malaysia Pargo, Crystal Smith, Gocha Hawkins, Princess Banton-Lofters, premiering Feb.15.\n\nWhen we asked about the best and worst parts of being married to her famous ex, she told us, “Well, the best part is that we have amazing children and they’re amazing and they’re cute. They have spunky personalities from the both of us.”\n\nBut, “The worst part is doing an interview about [her upcoming] TV show and being asked about Usher.”\n\nShe said of Usher’s new relationship, “Love is love — as long as he finds love whatever juncture he’s in, in his life. I always encourage him to have good habits.”\n\nShe also acknowledged that she faced unfair backlash when she was with Usher, in part because of her skin color.\n\n“I was not loved for that… That’s the worst part I think for me. I just don’t feel that black love is embraced anymore,” Foster, 53, said. “I think it’s a thing of the past, unfortunately. I don’t think it’s as celebrated. Nowadays we have to change the narrative, but we have to find men that agree with us. That’s the problem. The men are going the other way.”\n\nShe added, “My self-esteem at the time… you know we’re talking about 10 years ago. The sisters didn’t like it.”"
