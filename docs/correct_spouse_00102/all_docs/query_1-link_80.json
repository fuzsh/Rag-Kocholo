        "text": "ATLANTA (AP) – Usher is a father.\n\nThe Grammy-winning R&B singer and his wife, Tameka Foster, welcomed a newborn, his publicist confirmed Tuesday, declining to say whether it was a boy or a girl. It’s the 28-year-old’s first child and Foster’s fourth.\n\n“Yes, I can confirm that Usher had a baby,” Patti Webster told The Associated Press in an e-mailed message. It wasn’t clear what day the baby was born.\n\nThe couple wed in a large, glitzy ceremony in early September after exchanging vows a few weeks earlier in a civil ceremony. The singer and Foster, who is 37, had called off their July 28 wedding amid reports that Foster had checked into a hospital because of problems with her pregnancy.\n\nA private ceremony was held Aug. 3 in the office of Usher’s lawyer. The couple announced their engagement earlier in the year and later said Foster was expecting the child."
