        "text": "Usher is serious about his son's health.\n\nIn an interview with PEOPLE, the \"Good Good\" singer spoke to the publication about how he and his ex-wife, Tameka Foster, act as a team while caring for their son, Usher Raymond V, 15, who was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes in 2014. According to Usher, that was the beginning of a significant shift in their lives.\n\n“From the moment that Type 1 diabetes was a conversation, it was a re-acclimation to life. The life that we knew changed,” the artist said. “It comes with a great deal of consideration and commitment in itself because we’re all managing to make certain that my child makes the right decisions to have a happy, healthy life.\"\n\nType 1 diabetes is when the pancreas produces little to no insulin, but it can be managed with insulin shots. This autoimmune reaction can develop at any age.\n\nFor Usher and Foster, being a cohesive support system for their son requires determination. They got married in 2007, but divorced in 2009. They also share a 14-year-old son, Naviyd Eli Raymond.\n\n“The breeding ground of disaster is lack of communication,” he explained. “You honestly have to find the means and the ability to have mutual parties.” For them, “our [kid's] endocrinologist is a mutual ground.”\n\nHe continued, “It’s been a task. It is very complicated because kids, by the way, will find a way to work you against each other. You have to be mindful of what you say and that they’re always listening and greater than that. They’re always watching.”\n\nAdditionally, Usher said they are determined to work together.\n\n\"Her experience is what it is. My experience is what it is, and if we can find somewhere to meet in the middle to make the right decisions and also to be mindful of each other or at least sensitive to the things that matter to both parties, then that’s hopefully success for everybody.”\n\nBy clicking Subscribe, you confirm that you have read and agree to our Terms of Use and acknowledge our Privacy Policy.
