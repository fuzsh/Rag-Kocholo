        "text": "Usher’s ex-wife Tameka Foster thought he was already married to Jennifer Goicoechea.\n\nThe 45-year-old pop star tied the knot with his long-time girlfriend Jennifer on Super Bowl Sunday while they were in Las Vegas for his performance at the half time show.\n\nNow his former wife Tameka — mother of his two teenage sons — has insisted she was surprised by the wedding news because she thought the couple had already exchanged vows.\n\nShe told TMZ.com: “I thought he’d been married. I don’t know. I stopped keeping up with that type of thing.\n\n“That’s like his second … third … I don’t know. I don’t even keep up with his personal [life].”\n\nUsher’s wedding to Jennifer marked his second trip down the aisle. He was previously married to Tameka — the mother of his sons Usher ‘Cinco’ Raymond V, 16, and Navid Ely, 15 — from 2007 until 2009. He also has two kids with Jennifer.\n\nUsher kept his wedding plans secret from his Super Bowl half time show collaborators\n\n6 days ago\n\nTameka added of her ex: “He’s a good dad. That’s what I care about.”\n\nPrior to his Super Bowl performance, Usher opened up about his relationship with music executive Jennifer.\n\n“Listen, when you find someone that you know is a great partner, of course it is an honour and a pleasure to be able to share life with someone who wants to share it with you and loves you, who you are,” he told PEOPLE.\n\n“We’ve obviously made a commitment to life for life together because of our children. It wouldn’t be odd for us to get married.\n\n“We already did here. You know what I’m saying? And we’re going to be in each other’s lives until we die, obviously, because we have something to share.\n\n“That’s beautiful. Our children. But not because of that. I really do feel like I have an amazing partner that I respect.”\n\nSource: Showbiz\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading..."
