        "text": "Less than a week after tying the knot for the second time, Usher is now reflecting on the complexities of his first marriage.\n\nIn a no-holds-barred interview with PEOPLE, the eight-time Grammy winner opened up on how scrutiny he and ex-wife Tameka Foster faced after their nuptials affected their relationship. When they exchanged vows in 2007, Foster was seven years older than the \"My Way,\" singer.\n\n\"I think I became very closed and then felt attacked in many ways,\" he said. \"It was a bit unconventional in a time when I felt like my female fans were judgmental of the woman that I chose.\"\n\nUsher also believes colorism played a role in the backlash he received from fans after marrying the stylist.\n\n\"She was a dark-skinned woman, and maybe they didn't want to love her in a way because of maybe some reason that had to do with themselves,\" he explained while adding, \"I don't know. Or maybe she was not the best reference because of how she handled herself. That's not for me to be concerned about. I did my part and what I thought was right.\"\n\nTwo years after walking down the aisle, they went their separate ways.\n\n\"We ended up having two children together,\" he said while referencing sons Usher V, 16, and Naviyd, 15.\n\nDespite a past tumultuous custody battle, Usher admitted, \"We are cordial with each other.\"\n\nHe added, \"We ain't good, good, but we good. You know what I'm saying?\" while referencing his 2023 hit single \"Good Good.\"\n\n\"It's an 18 year process of which we all understand that, and we're doing our best to raise two responsible, respectful, and happy children.\"\n\nThis has been a remarkable year for the chart-topping artist. Not only did Usher perform at the Super Bowl halftime show, but that same day he married his longtime girlfriend . They are parents to Sovereign, 3, and son Sire, 2.\n\nBy clicking Subscribe, you confirm that you have read and agree to our Terms of Use and acknowledge our Privacy Policy.
