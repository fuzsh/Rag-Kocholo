        "text": "By Kelly Corbett\n\nFeb. 9 2024, Updated 1:07 p.m. ET\n\nEight-time Grammy winner Usher Raymond (aka Usher) is arguably one of the best R&B singers of all time. Not only can he sing and dance, but he‚Äôs also dedicated to helping children and teens reach their full potential. Founded in 1999, his non-profit organization Usher‚Äôs New Look offers mentorship and leadership programming to underserved youths in low resource areas.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nYears later, Usher would become a father himself and be able to help his own children tap into their talents and discover their passions. Here‚Äôs everything we know about the \"Yeah!\" crooner's children and his relationships with their mothers.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nHow many children does Usher have?\n\nUsher is currently the father to four children: son Usher V, son Naviyd Ely, daughter Sovereign Bo, and son Sire Castrello.\n\nUsher V and Naviyd Ely ‚Äî who were born in 2007 and 2008, respectively ‚Äî are from his marriage to now-ex-wife Tameka Foster.\n\nHe then welcomed Sovereign and Sire with girlfriend Jenn Goicoechea in 2020 and 2021, respectively.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nUsher shared the news of Sire and Sovereign‚Äôs births on Instagram.\n\nInstagram wasn‚Äôt around when Usher welcomed his first two children. However, when he became a father for the third and fourth time, he was able to quickly share the news with fans using the platform. In October 2021, Usher announced that he and Jenn had welcomed baby boy Sire Castrello Raymond in September of that year.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nThe proud dad posted an adorable black-and-white photo of Sire. The caption read: ‚ÄúHi my name is Sire Castrello Raymond ‚Ä¶ I am the newest addition to the Raymond crew. I was born Sept 29 2021 at 6:42pm weighing 7lbs 13oz. Hear me roar ‚Ä¶ A.K.A Ra Ra .üë∂üèΩ ‚ôéÔ∏èGang #demraymondboys.‚Äù\n\nA year earlier, in September 2020, Usher finally became a girl dad when he welcomed Sovereign Bo with Jenn.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nAlongside a photo of his newborn daughter's hand, he wrote: \"We are feeling blessed and full of love with the arrival of our beautiful baby girl.\" He noted that 'Isn't She Lovely' by Stevie Wonder was playing on repeat. Sovereign would go on to star in one of her dad's music videos in 2024.\n\nUsher and Jenn confirmed their relationship on Instagram in October 2019. Prior to meeting Jenn (and after his divorce from Tameka), Usher was married to a woman named Grace Miguel; however, they did not have any children together.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nUsher was awarded sole custody of his sons Usher V and Navidyd.\n\nUsher and Tameka tied the knot in 2007, went on to welcome sons Usher V and Navidyd together, and divorced in 2009. What followed was a nasty custody battle that lasted longer than their marriage. The Hollywood Reporter confirmed in August 2012 that Usher had been awarded primary custody of their two sons.\n\nAccording to E! News at the time, the singer's attorney argued that Tameka was \"incapable of being a proper parent\" to the boys, claiming that she \"does not have the emotional stability to or capacity to bond with them, and therefore she is handicapped.‚Äù\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nUsher also testified in court that when he and his new girlfriend went to drop the kids off at her house, Tameka tried to take a swing at him. This custody ruling came just one month after Tameka‚Äôs 11-year-old son Kile, whom she had from a previous relationship, tragically died in a tubing accident.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nUsher joked that it's harder to get his older kids to hang out with him.\n\nIn 2022, Usher revealed that Usher V actually prefers to be called by his nickname, Cinco. He also said it's harder getting his older kids to hang out with their dad, telling People of his children:\n\n\"I try my hardest to base my schedule around the time that they're not in school. My youngest, the 1- and 2-year-olds, they're here [in Las Vegas], while my two boys are now less interested in spending time with me, oddly.\" He laughed and jokingly added, \"unless I'm taking them to a concert or paying for something they want.\"\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nUsher vowed to never name another one of his children after him.\n\nIt's unknown if Usher plans to have more children, but he has spoken out about one name that is completely off-limits for all future babies. In 2020, when the singer was expecting his third child, he appeared on The Late Late Show to discuss potential baby names. As it turns out, Usher would never name another one of his sons Usher.\n\n\"I'm not like George Foreman ‚Äî I can't name all my kids George,\" he joked when host James Corden asked if he'd use his own name again for the new baby. For reference, George Foreman has five sons and five daughters. All of George's sons are named George."
