        "text": "Usher’s Ex-Wife’s New Memoir Addresses Marriage\n\nUsher’s ex-wife Tameka Foster Raymond is coming out with a memoir this week to address their marriage.\n\nUsher and Tameka were married from 2007 to 2009 and share two sons together.\n\nAccording to reports per HotNewHipHop, “Tameka’s memoir Here I Stand… in a Beautiful State arrives on Tuesday (July 27), and inside, she’s set to share stories about her personal relationships and brings clarity to her relationship with the R&B singer.”\n\nThe title of the memoir is a reference to the R&B singer’s 2008 album Here I Stand.\n\nTameka has several components besides the marriage that will be written about including the tragic loss of her 11-year-old son from a previous marriage who died following a jet ski accident on Lake Lanier in Georgia.\n\nA press release per AceShowBiz, revealed that Tameka went back and forth on deciding whether to write a book but her decision changed after she had a conversation with three strangers.\n\n“After several years of contemplating writing about her life, she decided to write a book after having a conversation with three women on a beach in Bali,” the press release reads. “As they spoke, they learned who Raymond’s ex-husband was and they were insistent there was no way she could be who she said she was because his wife had died.”\n\n“They were referring to her near-death experience in Brazil, which has been grossly misreported in the media,” it continues. “After that hilarious and memorable conversation on the beach, Raymond knew she had to write a book. It was time to clear up all the rumors and outright lies about her fashion career, her marriage, and her parenting.”\n\nBelow is the preview for Tameka memoir she posted on her Instagram which is already getting support.\n\nOne user wrote, “Thank you for being so candid and raw. Your truth and vulnerability will help so many others find their power again. God bless you sis 💝”\n\nAnother commented, “I can not wait Meka!!! I am so very proud of you! Your story & strength will help so many people! ❤️💪🏽👑🔥Congratulations boo!!”\n\n“Wow, I can’t wait to read this book, Tameka!! What a story! ❤️ RIP Kile,” one user replied honoring her late son.\n\nAutumn Hawkins is the National Hip-Hop and R&B writer for Beasley Media, currently residing in New Jersey.
