        "text": "Tameka Foster has revealed she once endured a major health scare after suffering a cardiac arrest while attempting to undergo a liposuction procedure.\n\nThe fashion designer, who was married to R'n'B singer Usher briefly from 2007 to 2009, wanted to lose some weight and arranged to have liposuction in Brazil to help quicken the process.\n\nHowever, the procedure nearly proved to be fatal for her after she was put under general anaesthesia and subsequently went into cardiac arrest.\n\n\"I went in an attempt to have liposuction and I went into a cardiac arrest with the anesthesiologist,\" Foster told People Monday. \"The doctor never even entered the room.\"\n\nA representative for Dr Silvio Sterman, the Sao Paulo plastic surgeon who was brought in to perform Foster's operation, said that the designer was \"immediately revived and placed in an induced coma.\"\n\nAfter her health scare, Foster didn't attempt it again but found other ways to achieve her weight loss goals. And she has found peace with the fact her weight fluctuates, having lost 20 pounds with a new health plans.\n\n\"I still care about looks and vanity, but I plan to do it the natural way. That's all,\" the 53-year-old added.\n\n\"[The health scare] made me be a little less lazy about getting to my goals, and I just changed my diet and now I do intermittent fasting and things like that. I mean, I go up and down, but yeah, I do care less about it. I'm not as anal about it.\"\n\nHow long were Usher and Tameka Foster together?\n\nFoster met Usher while working as his personal stylist and the pair began dating in 2005. They were engaged to be married in 2007 before their wedding was canceled, but they later got hitched in Atlanta in a civil ceremony.\n\nOnly four months after her failed liposuction attempt, Usher filed for divorce from Fosterand after a long custody battle, he was awarded sole custody of their two sons, Usher \"Cinco\" Raymond V, 16, and Naviyd Ely, 15."
