Have an account? .\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUsher's wife, Jennifer Goicoechea, is a senior vice president of A&R at Epic Records.\n\nUsher isn't the only person in his family who's heavily invested in music. Goicoechea, who grew up in Miami with her Italian mother and Puerto Rican father, told Rolling Out in 2015 that she was interested in music from an early age and used to shadow her mother, who was a production manager for Act Productions, at work.\n\nGoicoechea said the experience she gained from working with her mother helped her eventually land a job with Ciara. She later founded her own management company, Boogs'N'Effect Management. She's now an SVP of A&R at Epic Records.\n\nIt's unclear when Goicoechea and Usher met, but there are photos of Goicoechea at Usher's birthday party in October 2018. The two were later photographed kissing backstage at a 2019 concert at the Hollywood Bowl, according to People.\n\nGoicoechea has made several public appearances with Usher — including one at Vanity Fair's 2023 Oscar party — and became a fixture on his Instagram page. In October 2023, Usher celebrated her birthday with a sweet Instagram post.\n\nGoicoechea and Usher have two children. Their daughter, Sovereign Bo, was born in September 2020, while their son, Sire Castrello, arrived in October 2021.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUsher's eldest son, Usher \"Cinco\" Raymond V, was born in 2007.\n\nUsher and Foster welcomed Cinco, now 16, in November 2007.\n\n\"We are so happy and proud of our beautiful son. What a blessing!\" Usher said in a statement at the time.\n\nIn a November 2022 interview with Tamron Hall, Usher said that his son prefers to go by his nickname, Cinco, to separate his identity from his dad's.\n\nIn 2013, Cinco almost drowned after his arm got stuck in a pool drain while trying to retrieve a toy, E! News reported. The next year, Cinco was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. Usher praised his son's bravery in an interview with People.\n\n\"A child that every day has to prick himself and has to be cautious of what he eats and also to carry this disorder around; that really is the type of bravery that we all aspire to have,\" he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUsher's second son, Naviyd Ely, was born in 2008.\n\nFoster and Usher welcomed Naviyd in December 2008, according to People. He's now 15.\n\n\"Tameka and the baby are doing fine,\" a representative said in a statement at the time.\n\nDuring his November 2022 interview with Tamron Hall, Usher said Naviyd had a love for entertainment and often watched his dad's shows. Usher added that Naviyd's isn't afraid to critique him.\n\n\"He's like, 'You missed this thing. you didn't do this thing.' And I'm like, 'Yeah, that's the point. It's not supposed to be the same every night,'\" Usher said.\n\nFollowing the release of \"Hands of Stone,\" a 2016 sports film he starred in, Usher told People that he was going to take back from his career to focus on his children.\n\nNaviyd has made several public appearances with his father, including accompanying Usher to his Hollywood Walk of Fame ceremony in September 2016.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUsher's only daughter, Sovereign Bo, was born in 2020.\n\nUsher announced his daughter's birth in a September 2020 Instagram post. She's now 3 years old.\n\n\"We are feeling blessed and full of love with the arrival of our beautiful baby girl, Sovereign Bo Raymond,\" he wrote in the caption. \"\"Isn't She Lovely\" by Stevie Wonder on repeat.\"\n\nUsher shared details about his daughter's name in a May 2021 interview with \"Extra.\"\n\n\"Sovereign, man, is such a beautiful word and name to me, you know, a supreme ruler is obviously the defined name,\" he said. \"She's definitely ruling the household,\" he added, calling her his \"my little 'reign-bo.'\"\n\nSovereign appeared in a video for Usher's single \"Ruin\" released on February 2.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUsher's youngest son, Sire Castrello, was born in October 2021.\n\nUsher announced the birth of his son Sire Castrello, now 2, in an October 2021 Instagram post.\n\n\"Hi my name is Sire Castrello Raymond … I am the newest addition to the Raymond crew. I was born Sept 29 2021 at 6:42pm weighing 7lbs 13oz. Hear me roar … A.K.A Ra Ra,\" he wrote in the caption.\n\nOn \"The Ellen DeGeneres Show,\" Usher said he did a \"terrible job\" choosing the music playlist during Sovereign's birth and tried to redeem himself during Sire's birth.\n\n\"The second time, I came fully equipped. I had my Mophie. I had speakers. I had backup batteries,\" Usher said. \"I had a whole playlist that I had worked on for about two weeks. It was crazy. It was great.\"\n\nUsher has shared photos of Sire to his Instagram account, including pictures of his son's first birthday in September 2022.\n\nRead next\n\nFamily Parenting\n\nAdvertisement"
