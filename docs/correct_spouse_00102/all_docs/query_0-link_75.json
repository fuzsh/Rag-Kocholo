        "text": "Alright, we're back with our new show, Blue Damage, look, I have revived myself from\n\nthe COVID-19. I am COVID-free. I knew you would do it. I knew you would do it, Jason. If anybody\n\ncould beat it, what about you? Yeah, you're right. I'm very proud of you. Yeah, but in a week,\n\neverybody online is saying that Jason Lee has the cure and I have to tell you I did do some stuff\n\noutside of traditional medicine that I'm not going to talk about because, you know, rest in\n\npiece of Dr. Sabia, I don't want the people coming over you to my house. Look, I haven't skipped a\n\nbeat. You know, we've been looking online and seeing that Tamika Foster Raymond wrote a book\n\nabout her ex-husband Usher and I've known Tamika for a long time and I don't know if either of you\n\nhave met her, but she's such a nice sweet person. I've never wanted to ask her all the details about\n\nher ex-man, but now that she has this book, I couldn't wait to call her and tell her I want to talk to her.\n\nUsher is one of my celebrity crushes and he's, I've heard nothing but good things about how\n\ncharming and amazing he is. I cannot imagine what it's like to marry someone like that though because\n\nhe he's a big deal. So I'm curious to see what she has to say about being in his limelight in his\n\nshadow, I guess. Now, I have a question. Is the song moving mountains about her? Oh,\n\nbecause that's a powerful song. Well, that's the thing about this book. It does talk about the song\n\nhere I stand and that's the name of the book. So she named the book after that song and some other\n\nmeaning that I'm going to get into. But see, to think about Tamika that I think a lot of us are\n\nalways interested in knowing about is who is she behind who is she beyond Usher? We know that she's\n\nUsher's ex-wife, but we know that she's an entrepreneur, we know she's a mom, we know she lost\n\nher son. We know that there's more to Tamika than just Usher. Well, it wasn't just those things that\n\nI had to ask her about. You all know that Quantasia, that woman said that Usher gave her herpes.\n\nI had to ask her about that. That was so alleged. Well, but I had to ask her about that too,"
