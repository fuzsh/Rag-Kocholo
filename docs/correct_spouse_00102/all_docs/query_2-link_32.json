I don't know. I stopped keeping up with that type of thing. That's like his second ... third ... I don't know. I don't even keep up with his personal [life].\"\n\nUsher's wedding to Jennifer marked his second trip down the aisle. He was previously married to Tameka - the mother of his sons Usher 'Cinco' Raymond V, 16, and Navid Ely, 15 - from 2007 until 2009. He also has two kids with Jennifer.\n\nTameka added of her ex: \"He's a good dad. That's what I care about.\"\n\nPrior to his Super Bowl performance, Usher opened up about his relationship with music executive Jennifer telling PEOPLE: \"Listen, when you find someone that you know is a great partner, of course it is an honour and a pleasure to be able to share life with someone who wants to share it with you and loves you, who you are.\n\n\"We've obviously made a commitment to life for life together because of our children. It wouldn't be odd for us to get married. We already did here. You know what I'm saying?\n\n\"And we're going to be in each other's lives until we die, obviously, because we have something to share. That's beautiful. Our children. But not because of that. I really do feel like I have an amazing partner that I respect.\""
