        "text": "Celebrity stylist Tameka Raymond Foster wants to clear up any rumors or misconceptions about her marriage to Usher in her upcoming memoir, Here I Stand… in a Beautiful State.\n\nAccording to HotNewHipHop, the book will feature stories about the former couple’s relationship, Foster’s life growing up in Oakland, California, and stories about her former clients, such as Lauryn Hill,Jay-Z, Timbaland, Aaliyah, Chris Brown and more. The title is a nod to Usher’s 2008 studio album, Here I Stand.\n\nUsher and Tameka were married from 2007 to 2009 and share two sons, Naviyd Ely and Usher V. During their heated custody battle, Tameka suffered the devastating loss of her 11-year-old son, Kile Glover. He passed away in 2012 after a jet ski accident on Lake Lanier in Georgia.\n\nNow, Usher and Tameka co-parent their blended family, along with the singer’s nine-month-old daughter, Sovereign Bo. Usher is also preparing to welcome his second child with his girlfriend, Jennifer Goicoechea.\n\n“Here I stand to finally tell my side of the story,” says Foster in a trailer for the book. “Unfiltered and unapologetic. A story of survival and perseverance. You think you know a story, but you don’t even know the half.”\n\nHere I Stand… in a Beautiful State will be released on September 15. Autographed copies of the book are available for pre-order at TamekaRaymond.com.\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nA post shared by ????????????????????????
