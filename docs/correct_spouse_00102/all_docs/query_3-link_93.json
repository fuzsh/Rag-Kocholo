        "text": "Usher has got it bad for his longtime love Jennifer Goicoechea.\n\nThe pair might be headed to a little white chapel following his Super Bowl 2024 halftime show performance in Las Vegas on Sunday.\n\nAccording to the Daily Mail, the “Love in This Club” singer, 45, and Goicoechea, 39, obtained a marriage license in Sin City on Feb. 8.\n\nThe “Faculty” actor and Goicoechea — who have been together since 2019 — will reportedly have a small ceremony with just close friends and family in attendance.\n\nThe couple share two children together — daughter Sovereign Bo, 3, and son Sire Castrello, 2.\n\nUsher’s newest album, “Coming Home,” was released on Friday. He spoke about his new music and gushed over settling down with Goicoechea in an exclusive interview with The Post last week.\n\n“I spent a lot of time outside. And it ain’t much out there for me. I have a good time, but inside I can have all the [things] that I want,” he said about mellowing out with the Miami-born music executive.\n\n“And that comfort of coming home to this relationship that I’m in now in my life — with a woman who I have beautiful children with and is supporting me raising my two older sons — I feel like I’m coming home in a place that’s not about anything other than being happy,” the R&B crooner continued.\n\nHe went on: “And I talk a bit about that journey [on the album]. There’s a bit of a throughline — you have to really listen to get it.”\n\n“Coming Home” is his first solo album since his 2016 record “Hard II Love.”\n\nUsher was previously married to designer Tameka Foster and they have two sons together — Usher Raymond V, 16, and Naviyd Ely, 15.\n\nThey married in 2007 and divorced two years later.\n\nFollowing his first marriage, the “Yeah!” singer tied the knot for the second time with Grace Miguel. He filed for divorce after three years of marriage in October 2020.\n\nUsher and Goicoechea, meanwhile, were first linked in 2019."
