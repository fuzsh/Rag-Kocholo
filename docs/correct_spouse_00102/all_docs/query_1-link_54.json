        "text": "There is something I don't really understand. Selena Gomez, an American superstar has 425milliin followers on Instagram and 89million followers on Facebook. Our own Rema has less than 6million followers on Instagram. But Selena Gomez recently showered praises on Rema for changing her life after doing collabo with Rema on his worldwide hit song , 'CALM DOWN'. Selena Gomez said ‚ÄúThis man has changed my life forever. Rema , thank you for choosing me to be a part of one of the biggest songs in the world. Love you for forever Rema‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äù WHY WAS SHE SUPER GRATEFUL? Here are some of reasons üëá ‚ñ™Ô∏èRema‚Äôs 'Calm Down' gave Selena Gomez her first ever #1 hit on the Radio Songs chart. ‚ñ™Ô∏è'Calm Down' is also Selena‚Äôs first song to reach #1 on Billboard Global 200. ‚ñ™Ô∏è'Calm Down' is also her longest charting song on Billboard Hot 100. So with Selena Gomez gigantic fan base at nearly 500million followers on Instagram, she still needs the assistance of a young boy with a mere little above 5million followers on Instagram before she could attain some enviable heights in life. This is a lesson to us all. Don't undermine anyone. People you are far ahead of today can be a source of help to you tomorrow. Irrespective of your academic attainment, a school dropout can still be of a good help to you tomorrow. Those poor neighbors you have written off today could be your saviors tomorrow. Nothing is permanent in life, but only change. God uses the simple things of this world to humble the rich and the mighty. Nobody has it all. Irrespective of the gigantic size of an elephant, it still needs the assistance of a tree in the forest to scratch its back. Do you know that thousands of Igbo people got to know many millionaires in Igboland throughOkwuluoraa ? He gave them publicity their money couldn't give them. They are far richer than Okwuluora. But Okwuluora has something they don't have...and that is social media capital. He is using his social media capital to give publicity to both ordinary Igbo people and the wealthy Igbo people. Just look at the cooking competition he is about to organize in Igboland. Even state government lacks the seriousness this young man is exhibiting in his drive to make Igbo people live better. To many of us, he is more important to us than our state governors. We must not also forget to hail Gomez Selena for at least appreciating the one who helped her to reach the pinnacle of her career. Gratitude is an uncommon virtue and it is very rare to be found among the musicians of her class. God bless her. Reposted: https://lnkd.in/giEWddin"
