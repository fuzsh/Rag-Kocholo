        "text": "Usher \"Cinco\" Raymond V\n\nUsher’s firstborn is Usher “Cinco” Raymond V with his first wife Tameka Foster. He was born on Nov. 27, 2007.\n\nCinco is the fifth in his family to be named Usher, but he doesn’t particularly want to be called that. “I have one son, Cinco, who does not like to be called Usher, who tries to get away from it,” Usher told Tamron Hall.\n\n“You know, I named my son Usher so every time he’s out, obviously, there’s that pressure,” he told Shannon Sharpe on Club Shay Shay.\n\nWhen he was five years old, Cinco was involved in an accident in Usher’s pool as he was trying to obtain a toy in a drain. “I am blessed and fortunate to say that my son Usher V is doing well and is recovering,” Usher said in a statement at the time. “I am overwhelmed by the outpouring of prayers, love and support for my family’s well-being.”\n\nNaviyd Ely Raymond\n\nNaviyd Ely Raymond is Usher’s second child with Tameka Foster. He was born on Dec. 10, 2008.\n\nHis son is active in his father’s endeavors. In one instance, Usher took the then-13-year-old Naviyd to the AMIRI runway show in Las Vegas. “He was acting super cool,” the “Confessions” singer told Entertainment Tonight. “But I mean, wouldn’t you at 13? I don’t want to be around all these older people!”\n\nUsher clarified that his son “really loves entertainment.” When he was prepping for his Las Vegas residency, Naviyd would offer critiques. “He’s like, ‘You missed this thing. you didn’t do this thing.’ And I’m like, ‘Yeah that’s the point. It’s not supposed to be the same every night,’ ” Usher told Tamron Hall.\n\nSovereign Bo Raymond\n\nSovereign Bo is Usher’s third child—his first daughter and child with longtime girlfriend Jennifer Goicoechea. She was born on September 24, 2020.\n\n“We are feeling blessed and full of love with the arrival of our beautiful baby girl, Sovereign Bo Raymond,” Usher wrote on Instagram with a photo of his newborn’s hand. “‘Isn’t She Lovely’ by Stevie Wonder on repeat ❤️ ❤️ ❤️.”\n\nHe also revealed to Ellen DeGeneres that his daughter was supposed to have another astrology sign. “She came out early,” he said. “She was scheduled to be a Scorpio but decided she had a different plan. Libras, you know, they kinda have their minds made up what they wanna do.”\n\nUsher revealed her name’s significance to Extra. “Sovereign, man, is such a beautiful word and name to me, you know, a supreme ruler is obviously the defined name,” he explained. “She’s definitely ruling the household, but Sovereign Bo — Bo is at the end of it, so [she’s] my little ‘reign-bo.'” He added, “I’m on diaper duty plus, man, and she has yummy toes. Yes, I can’t help it.”\n\nSire Castrello Raymond\n\nSire Castrello Raymond is Usher’s fourth child—his third son and second child with Jennifer Goicoechea.\n\nHe announced his son’s birthday on Instagram. “Hi my name is Sire Castrello Raymond … I am the newest addition to the Raymond crew. I was born Sept 29 2021 at 6:42pm weighting 7lbs 13oz. Hear me roar … A.K.A Ra Ra . 👶🏽 ♎️ Gang.”\n\n“Me and him have a really cool relationship. He’s different than any of my other kids,” Usher told People about his relationship with his son. “I’ve managed to have a little code going with him when I talk to him and how we speak to each other. He makes me mush … My new little boy, he’s something special.”\n\nGoicoecha wrote about her son’s name’s significance on Instagram, she wrote, “I recently lost my grandfather, Champ Castrello (he was was 105). Champ was the strongest, bravest, family oriented, funny and kindest man I know.. (other than my baby father lol) I couldn’t ask for a better example of how a man should be! He was the definition… it was only right we keep his name alive.”"
