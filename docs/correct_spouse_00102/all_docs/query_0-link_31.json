        "text": "Things are getting even more complicated between Usher and his ex-wife Tameka Raymond. According to TMZ, Usher is planning to sell the 12,000 sq. ft. mansion that Tameka currently lives in.\n\nSources report that Tameka received a letter from Usher’s lawyers this week informing her that the house will be put on the market. Tameka has been living in the home for the past few years, but per the couples divorce agreement, Usher is legally allowed to sell the home as long as he gives Tameka 60 days notices.\n\nIt’s been a rough few months for Tameka, and having to find a new place to live is only adding another layer of stress to what’s she going through. Just last week, her custody retrial request was rejected and in late July, she laid her son, Kile Glover, to rest.\n\nUsher purchased the home in 2007 for a hefty $3 million and it’s unclear what he plans to sell it for."
