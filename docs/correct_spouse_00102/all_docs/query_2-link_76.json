        "text": "TMZSports.com\n\nUsher is a newly married man once again ... an event his ex-wife couldn't be happier about for him -- 'cause she's got motion of her own ... moving and grooving over the news!!!\n\nTMZ Hip Hop spoke to Tameka Foster on Tuesday, ahead of the launch of her new reality series, \"Bold and Bougie\" ... but she tells us she had a blast at the Super Bowl last Sunday, just like her ex-hubby did during his halftime show.\n\nTameka's been one of Atlanta's most sought-after stylists for YEARS, so first things first -- we had to get her thoughts on the viral backlash regarding Jermaine Dupri's schoolboy-style uniform ... and him trying to use its Louis Vuitton labels as somewhat of a defense.\n\nHundreds of comments rejected JD's rebuttal and you can add Tameka to that list too. She tells us relying heavily on designer brands won't always breed the best style results ... sorry, JD ... these are just her confessions.\n\nBottom line ... she's not very approving, just like the rest of the Internet didn't.\n\nAs for Usher, social media users couldn't help but bring her name up when we broke the deets on his marriage to Jennifer Goicoechea on Sunday ... Tameka's blowing them off.\n\nThey've been divorced for eons now -- since 2009, actually -- but do have two children together ... and Tameka tells us he's a great dad. As a matter of fact ... one of their sons just may follow in his singing shadow sooner than later, 'cause he's a helluva crooner himself.\n\nIn any case, Tameka's not entertaining negativity on her side -- and neither are her gal pals Malaysia Pargo, Gocha Hawkins, Princess Banton-Lofters and Crystal Smith in their new TV venture.\n\nYa can't be a boss and be bothered by online BS ... and Tameka certainly isn't as it pertains to Usher's new marriage.\n\nTMZ Studios"
