The couple has two children, 1 ½ year old Usher Raymond V and 6-month-old Naviyd Ely Raymond. Tameka has three children from a previous marriage.\n\nAs previously reported on AccessHollywood.com, in February, the R&B star pulled out of a planned performance at Clive Davis' pre-Grammy Awards party to rush to Tameka's side in Brazil after she suffered a cardiac arrest shortly before undergoing plastic surgery. Tameka was released after 11 days of recovery.\n\nRelated Content from AccessHollywood.com:\n\nVIEW THE PHOTOS: Hollywood Divorces\n\nPLAY IT NOW: Access Search Engine: Was Usher's Wife In A Coma?
