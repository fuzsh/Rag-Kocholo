        "text": "Usher's recent marriage to Jennifer Goicoechea in Las Vegas has sparked quite a buzz, especially with his ex-wife, Tameka Foster, making an appearance at his Super Bowl halftime performance. Foster, who was married to Usher from 2007 to 2009 and shares two teen children with him, shared her thoughts on the whole situation.\n\nFoster expressed mixed feelings about attending the Super Bowl as Usher's ex, stating: \"One of the perks of having Usher as an ex is going to the Super Bowl. It's facts.\" She also humorously added, \"I'm not dating anybody that can't take me to the Super Bowl. That would not be my trajectory. But seeing Usher performing was definitely a perk.\"\n\nThe halftime show, featuring Usher along with Alicia Keys, Ludacris, Jermaine Dupri, H.E.R., Lil Jon, and Will.i.am, was a highlight for Foster. She described the experience as \"phenomenal\" and emphasized that she had a great time at the game.\n\nWhen asked about her current feelings towards Usher's new relationship, Foster maintained a positive outlook, stating, \"Love is love - as long as he finds love whatever juncture he's in, in his life. I always encourage him to have good habits.\"\n\nHowever, she also reflected on the challenges she faced during her relationship with Usher, particularly unfair backlash due to her skin color. She expressed frustration, stating, \"I was not loved for that... That's the worst part I think for me. I just don't feel that black love is embraced anymore. I think it's a thing of the past, unfortunately.\"\n\nFoster calls for a change of narrative\n\nFoster also addressed the impact of societal attitudes on her self-esteem at the time, highlighting the lack of support she received from some women. She emphasized the need to change the narrative and find men who align with these values.\n\nDespite the challenges she faced, Foster remains focused on her own endeavors, including her upcoming TV show \"Bold & Bougie\" on WE tv. She expressed her excitement about this new project and humorously mentioned the downside of being constantly asked about Usher in interviews."
