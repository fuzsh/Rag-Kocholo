        "text": "(CBS/AP) ATLANTA - R&B singer Usher has been awarded custody of his two sons, ending a long legal fight with his ex-wife, Tameka Foster.\n\nPictures: Usher\n\nA person with knowledge of the decision said a judge ruled Friday that the 33-year-old Grammy winner will have primary custody of Usher Raymond V, 4, and Naviyd Ely Raymond, 3. The person was not authorized to release the information and spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nUsher, whose real name is Usher Raymond IV, married Foster in 2007. They divorced two years later. She fought for full custody of their sons while Usher initially asked for more visitation rights.\n\nUsher testified in May that his ex-wife spit at and tried to fight his girlfriend during one visit and alleged that his ex-wife hit him during the dispute.\n\nTMZ reports that Foster will still retain some custodial rights, but the extent to which she will be able to see the two boys is unclear."
