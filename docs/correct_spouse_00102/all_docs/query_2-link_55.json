        "text": "Tameka Foster has a “good” co-parenting relationship with Usher.\n\nThe 53-year-old fashion designer – who has sons Usher V, 16, and Naviyd, 15, with the music star – has maintained a good relationship with Usher since their divorce in 2009.\n\n“It’s great. Yeah, everything is great. We’re friends and the kids are at an age now where they can kind of say where they want to be as far as, ‘Hey I want to be at dad’s. I want to go to mom’s,'” she told People.\n\nTameka admitted that their co-parenting relationship is “going pretty smoothly.”\n\n“We have a very open door policy with the boys. We let ’em go where they want to go. Everything is going pretty smoothly,” she said.\n\nUsher recently performed the Halftime Show at the Super Bowl in Las Vegas.\n\nThe 45-year-old star also tied the knot with Jennifer Goicoechea, his longtime girlfriend, on Super Bowl Sunday, Feb. 11, and Tameka subsequently admitted she actually thought that they were already married.\n\n“I thought he’d been married. I don’t know. I stopped keeping up with that type of thing. That’s like his second … third … I don’t know. I don’t even keep up with his personal [life],” she told “TMZ.”\n\nTameka was also full of praise for the music star.\n\n“He’s a good dad. That’s what I care about,” she said.\n\nPrior to his Super Bowl performance, Usher opened up about his relationship with Jennifer.\n\n“Listen, when you find someone that you know is a great partner, of course it is an honor and a pleasure to be able to share life with someone who wants to share it with you and loves you, who you are,” he told People."
