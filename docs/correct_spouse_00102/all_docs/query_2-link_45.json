        "text": "Usher's custody battle with ex-wife Tameka Foster is officially over.\n\nAccording to TMZ, a judge awarded Usher primary custody of the ex-couple's two sons, Usher Raymond V, 4, and Naviyd, 3.\n\nThe decision ends a drawn-out custody battle between the former spouses, who divorced in 2009 after less than two years of marriage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFoster, who was fighting to retain joint custody and have her monthly support payments increased, had claimed that R&B singer was too busy traveling to care for the children. Usher's lawyers said earlier this month that Foster was \"incapable of being a proper parent\" to the boys, adding that she \"does not have the emotional stability to or capacity to bond with them, and therefore she is handicapped.\"\n\nThings got especially heated in May, when Foster took the stand and admitted under oath that she had told the R&B star, \"I will f**k you up.\" That same month, Usher reportedly refused Foster's request to allow her and their sons live permanently in the Georgia mansion he owns.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut in July, TMZ reported that Usher hoped to settle the custody battle quickly, in the wake of the jet ski accident that left his 11-year-old stepson, Kyle Glover, brain dead. Later that month, Glover died after he was taken off life support."
