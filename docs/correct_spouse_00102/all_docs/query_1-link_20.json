Yeah, everything is great. We're friends and the kids are at an age now where they can kind of say where they want to be as far as, 'Hey I want to be at dad's. I want to go to mom's.'\"\n\nTameka admitted that their co-parenting relationship is \"going pretty smoothly\".\n\nShe said: \"We have a very open door policy with the boys. We let 'em go where they want to go. Everything is going pretty smoothly.\"\n\nUsher recently performed the Halftime Show at the Super Bowl in Las Vegas.\n\nThe 45-year-old star also tied the knot with Jennifer Goicoechea, his longtime girlfriend, on Super Bowl Sunday (11.02.24), and Tameka subsequently admitted she actually thought that they were already married.\n\nShe told TMZ: \"I thought he'd been married. I don't know.\n\n\"I stopped keeping up with that type of thing. That's like his second ... third ... I don't know. I don't even keep up with his personal [life].\"\n\nTameka was also full of praise for the music star.\n\nShe said: \"He's a good dad. That's what I care about.\"\n\nPrior to his Super Bowl performance, Usher opened up about his relationship with Jennifer.\n\nHe told PEOPLE: \"Listen, when you find someone that you know is a great partner, of course it is an honour and a pleasure to be able to share life with someone who wants to share it with you and loves you, who you are.\""
