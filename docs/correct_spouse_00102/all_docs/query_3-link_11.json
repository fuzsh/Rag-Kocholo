In a conversation with TMZ, Foster says she thought he was already married.\n\n“I stopped keeping up with that king of thing,” Foster said. “He’s a good dad, that’s what I care about. And a dope performer. Did you see the halftime show?”\n\nUsher and his girlfriend, Jenn Goicoechea, exchanged vows in a surprise wedding ceremony in Las Vegas this past Sunday. Usher, who recently graced the cover of PEOPLE, shared exclusive images of their intimate celebration.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“We can confirm that Usher and Jennifer Goicoechea took the next step in their relationship and did get married on Sunday night in Las Vegas surrounded by close friends and family,” a representative told PEOPLE. “They both look forward to continuing to raise their children together surrounded by love and thank everyone for the well wishes.”\n\nFollowing Usher’s electrifying Super Bowl halftime performance in Las Vegas, the duo went to Vegas Weddings’ drive-thru tunnel, The Fast Lane, for the ceremony. In the heartwarming photos, Usher is seen beaming at Goicoechea, who holds a bouquet of red peonies and white roses, perfectly complementing the romantic ambiance of the day.\n\nYou can see all of the wedding pictures below."
