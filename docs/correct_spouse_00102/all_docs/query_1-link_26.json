        "text": "Some mistakes are meant to be made! In the September issue of O magazine, R&B crooner Usher opened up about his failed marriage, and why the relationship was his “best mistake.”\n\nWhen asked what his best mistake was, Usher, 35, replied, “Getting married at 28,” referencing his 2007 wedding to then-love Tameka Foster. The couple got engaged in February 2007 after dating for a little more than a year, and exchanged vows just months later. The marriage did not last, however, as Usher filed for divorce in 2009.\n\n“Most people probably think I regret it because I ended up getting divorced, but it helped me learn that sometimes I think I know more than I actually do,” he added in the latest installment of O.\n\nFollowing the end of his marriage to Foster, now 43, Usher retained custody of the couple’s sons Usher V, 6, and Naviyd, 5. The custody battle was lengthy and ugly, with Foster saying that her ex-husband’s status allowed him to keep the children and months of drama unfolding within the family.\n\nThe Voice mentor gushed to The Oprah Magazine about his extended family, saying the reunions or “what I call red-cup celebrations” are his best family tradition. “Everybody’s hanging out on the lawn, drinking out of those plastic cups, eating fried chicken, and dancing to loud old-school music,” Usher explained. “Sometimes the simpler the celebration is, the better.”\n\nThe Grammy winner, who is set to release his next studio album Everything You Can Imagine in September, also spilled to O about the best piece of advice he’s ever received.\n\n“If you stay ready, you ain’t gonna get ready,” he said. “James Brown told me that right before we performed together at the Grammys in 2005. I’ve never forgotten it, and I’m always telling people, ‘Well, James Brown once told me…'”"
