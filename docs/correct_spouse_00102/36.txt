Tameka Foster has lost her custody battle with ex-husband Usher. The Atlanta singer’s ex-wife was granted an emergency child custody hearing after her and Usher’s 5-year-old son Usher Raymond V nearly drowned in a pool on Monday.

Usher currently has primary custody of their two boys. The custody hearing concluded Friday afternoon (August 9) in Atlanta.

In court, Tameka tried to argue that Usher is an inattentive father who travels constantly, saying that the singer employs incompetent caretakers, including his Aunt Rena, to look after their children. Usher’s aunt was watching his children at the time of the accident.

Usher’s lawyer countered that Usher is a great father and said the children are thriving with him, despite the recent pool accident. Usher added that the accident could have happened to anybody.

Tameka broke down in tears while on the stand. Usher hugged his ex-wife after the judge dismissed her request for primary custody. Usher Raymond V remains in an Atlanta hospital but is expected to recover.
