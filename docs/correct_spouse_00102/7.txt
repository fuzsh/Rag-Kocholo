Usher's ex-wife Tameka Foster has finally spoken up about his surprise wedding with Jennifer Goicoechea.

In a new interview with TMZ, the stylist talked about her misunderstanding as she thought that the 45-year-old rapper was already married to his longtime girlfriend.

“I thought he'd been married. I don't know. I stopped keeping up with that type of thing” Tameka said.

“That's like his second... third... I don't know. I don't even keep up with his personal,” she added.

However, Tameka, who was married to Usher for two years, stressed that the My Boo hitmaker is a good father to their sons Usher 'Cinco' Raymond V and Navid Ely.

“He's a good dad. That's what I care about," she explained.

Tameka’s statement comes after the Grammy-winning artist tied the knot with Jennifer in an intimate ceremony in Las Vegas where he also performed at the Super Bowl.
