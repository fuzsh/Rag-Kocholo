The filing follows weeks of split rumors for the two, who married in August 2007. The couple has two children, 1 Â½ year old Usher Raymond V and 6-month-old Naviyd Ely Raymond. Tameka has three children from a previous marriage.

As previously reported on AccessHollywood.com, in February, the R&B star pulled out of a planned performance at Clive Davis' pre-Grammy Awards party to rush to Tameka's side in Brazil after she suffered a cardiac arrest shortly before undergoing plastic surgery. Tameka was released after 11 days of recovery.
