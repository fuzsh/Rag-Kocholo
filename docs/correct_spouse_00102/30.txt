Tameka Foster, ex-wife of Usher Raymond, opened up about their co-parenting journey in a recent interview with People Magazine.

Ahead of the premiere of her new WEtv show, Bold & Bougie, the 53-year-old told the outlet that her co-parenting relationship with Usher is “great”.

“It’s great. Yeah, everything is great,” Foster said. “We’re friends and the kids are at an age now where they can kind of say where they want to be as far as, ‘Hey I want to be at Dad’s. I want to go to Mom’s.'”

“We have a very open door policy with the boys. We let ’em go where they want to go. Everything is going pretty smoothly.”

Foster and Usher share two sons: Usher “Cinco” Raymond V, 16, and Naviyd Ely Raymond, 15.

Last November, Usher publicly shared that he and Foster’s eldest son was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes. At the time, the “Yeah” singer stated that Cinco’s diagnosis was life changing for both he and Foster as parents.

“From the moment that Type 1 diabetes was a conversation, it was a re-acclimation to life. The life that we knew changed,” the Grammy winner said in an exclusive interview with People Magazine.

He explained, “It comes with a great deal of consideration and commitment in itself because we’re all managing to make certain that my child makes the right decisions to have a happy, healthy life.” To ensure that his son has a “happy and healthy life,” the 45-year-old father-of-four made it a priority to establish a successful co-parenting relationship with Foster.

In addition to Cinco and Naviyd, Usher is also father to two little ones: daughter, Sovereign Bo Raymond and youngest child, son, Sire Castrello.

It appears as if Foster and Usher have put aside their difference and are co-parenting like pros. They have found a successful groove that is undeniably benefiting everyone involved.
