        "text": "Photo: ‘The Getaway King’\n\nIntro\n\nWhen it comes to movies, style is something that I always appreciate. It’s always important to remember that film is a visual medium, and that experimenting with the overall look and feel of a movie should be openly encouraged. Directors like Edgar Wright, Wes Anderson, Taika Waititi, and Zack Snyder understand this, and go out of their way to direct films that are distinctly theirs. Sure, it’s true that it takes more than just being stylistic or artsy to make a good movie, but having those elements shows the director understands the medium and is using it to his or her advantage. It’s for this reason that, despite some of the things I’ll be saying in this review, I’m happy that the first-ever Polish film I’ve ever seen is ‘The Getaway King’.\n\nRelated article: OSCAR-NOMINATED – EXCLUSIVE: ‘Dune’ Full Commentary, Reactions, Making Of – Timothee Chalamet, Zendaya, Oscar Isaac\n\nRelated article: OSCAR-NOMINATED – ‘House of Gucci’ Full Commentary & Behind the Scenes – Lady Gaga, Adam Driver, Jared Leto, Al Pacino\n\nRelated article: OSCAR-NOMINATED – ‘Belfast’ Full Commentary & BTS – Jamie Dornan, Caitriona Balfe, Judi Dench\n\nRelated article: OSCAR-NOMINATED – ‘West Side Story’ Full Commentary – Rita Moreno, Steven Spielberg, Rachel Zegler\n\nRelated article: OSCAR-NOMINATED – ‘No Time to Die’ Full Commentary, Behind the Scenes & Reactions, Daniel Craig, Rami Malek, Bond\n\n‘The Getaway King’ is an action comedy thriller directed by Mateusz Rakowicz (who co-wrote the screenplay with Łukasz M. Maciejewski) and starring Dawid Ogrodnik, Robert Więckiewicz, and Rafał Zawierucha. The film premiered at the New Horizons Film Festival on the 18th of August 2021 and has just recently been given a wide release by Netflix. The film centers around a fictionalized version of the Polish thief Zdzisław Najmrodzki (Ogrodnik), who was notorious for his repeated successful prison escape attempts. After meeting and falling in love with a girl, he helps her sell cars by putting his skills as a thief to use, all while trying to stay under the radar. The film has a very vibrant color palette, which is complemented by a fairly lighthearted tone.\n\nA Lack of Focus\n\nAs interesting as this movie looked based on the trailer, I found ‘The Getaway King’ to be a fairly disorganized film. While I generally understood what was going on, the amount of jumping around between characters and situations was a bit overwhelming, and the way the script put everything together came off as a bit confusing. Because of this, a number of potentially emotional moments wound up falling flat. I found myself unable to properly get invested in conflicts between characters, as I didn’t really get a proper feel for who they were. There are a few interesting ideas and moments scattered about in the narrative, such as the handful of scenes depicting the absurd ways Zdzisław manages to escape from the law, but thanks to the messy narrative the “fun” factor of scenes like these feel more superficial than anything.\n\nRelated article: All Best Actor/Actress Speeches From The Beginning Of Oscars 1929-2019 | Hollywood Insider\n\nRelated article: EVOLUTION: Every Henry Cavill Role From 2001 to 2021, All Performances Exceptionally Poignant\n\nRelated article: EVOLUTION: Every Chris Evans Role From 1997 to 2020, All Performances Exceptionally Poignant\n\nRelated article: ‘In the Heights’ Full Commentary & Behind the Scenes + Reactions – Lin Manuel Miranda, John M. Chu\n\nPositive Stuff\n\nAs I talked about in the opening of this review, the main aspect that kept me from actively disliking ‘The Getaway King’ was its directorial style. This is the first-ever feature film directed by Mateusz Rakowicz, and from a technical standpoint, it left a fairly good first impression on me. The visual style of the film is very striking; quite a lot of colors really pop out, especially the oranges. The lighting and shading are also used in a powerful way, with light and dark areas of the screen having a very sharp contrast. It’s a look that gives off a strong “vintage” vibe, which decently reflects the film’s time period, which spans the late eighties to the early nineties. In a way, it kind of reminded me of ‘Hobo With a Shotgun’, an intentionally “old-school” style film that used color and lighting in a similar in-your-face way. Adding to the playful, cartoonish vibe of the film are various directorial idiosyncrasies like screen wipes and comedic slow-motion, and the use of generally upbeat period-accurate music.\n\nOne gag, in particular, involving a dramatic reveal getting botched by two characters throwing up at what they discover was particularly amusing. All of this took what could’ve been a flat and tedious film and turned it into something with a genuine and fun sense of personality. Looking up his name on IMDB, I found out that Mateusz Rakowicz did storyboard work on a number of films as far back as 2004, and having just seen this film, that’s something that I have no trouble with believing. This is one neatly directed movie, and I’ll certainly be keeping an eye out for any future films that Mateusz Rakowicz directs…and luckily, that’s something we won’t have to wait much longer for, as he’s already got one called ‘Dzien Matki’ (or ‘Mother’s Day’) in the works, which too will be coming out on Netflix this Fall. Sorry, was that a bit off-topic? Anyways…\n\nRelated article: The Hollywood Insider’s CEO Pritan Ambroase: “The Importance of Venice Film Festival as the Protector of Cinema”\n\nRelated article: The Masters of Cinema Archives: The Hollywood Insider Pays Tribute to ‘La Vie En Rose’, Exclusive Interview with Director Olivier Dahan\n\nRelated article: – Want GUARANTEED SUCCESS?

One could argue that it does partially glorify his criminal side, as him being a master at escaping is played off as “cool” at times, and a scene in which he helps steal someone’s car is played out in a comedic manner, but I feel there’s a bit of nuance to it, and that the film is aware that a lot of what he does is wrong. Even so, you can generally see where Zdzisław is coming from, and he’s never truly malicious at all. Morally ambiguous protagonists can be interesting if written well, and while my issues regarding the film’s overall clarity still stand, the character of Zdzisław is one that I felt was perfectly fine.\n\nShould you watch ‘The Getaway King’?\n\n‘The Getaway King’ offers a decent handful of qualities I have no problem in fully appreciating. The almost Wes Anderson-esque playfulness is a real highlight here; it’s an aspect that makes the film a lot more fun and interesting than it could’ve been. This film also manages to balance quirky comedy with more serious moments without ever feeling tonally jarring, as it never ventures too far into dark territory. And finally, there’s the aforementioned fact that this film is a feature-length directorial debut, and as far as such films go, this one has proven (to me at least) that Mateusz has great potential as a filmmaker. I look forward to seeing what direction he takes his future films, as his style is already satisfying and distinct. I can only imagine what his films will look (and sound) like once said style evolves over the course of his career.\n\nRelated article: Why Queen Elizabeth II Is One Of The Greatest Monarchs | Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II of United Queendom of Great Britain & Northern Ireland (Video Insight)\n\nLimited Time Offer – FREE Subscription to The Hollywood Insider\n\nClick here to read more on The Hollywood Insider’s vision, values and mission statement here – Media has the responsibility to better our world – The Hollywood Insider fully focuses on substance and meaningful entertainment, against gossip and scandal, by combining entertainment, education, and philanthropy.\n\nRelated article: MUST WATCH – The Hollywood Insider’s CEO Pritan Ambroase’s Love Letter to Black Lives Matter – VIDEO\n\nSubscribe to The Hollywood Insider’s YouTube Channel, by clicking here.\n\nAnd yet, with all of that said…I recognize that most of my praise for this film is merely based on its presentation. Yes, this film does have style. Yes, it has a great soundtrack, and yes, there are some fun moments. However, for the most part, I found ‘The Getaway King’ to be fairly tedious and unengaging. Good direction can only do so much when the script fails to hold your attention, and unfortunately, that’s how I felt about this film. As for recommendations, if you’ve got a Netflix account and you love “artsy” Cinema, then I’m comfortable saying that this film is still at least worth giving a shot. Between the overall look and the fleeting moments of entertainment, I can see an honest effort at making a good film here. And hey, you might even see something in it that I didn’t.\n\n‘The Getaway King’ is now streaming on Netflix.\n\nCast & Crew:\n\nDirected by: Mateusz Rakowicz\n\nWritten by: Mateusz Rakowicz, Łukasz M. Maciejewski\n\nStarring: Dawid Ogrodnik, Robert Więckiewicz, Rafał Zawierucha\n\nBy Austin Oguri\n\nClick here to read The Hollywood Insider’s CEO Pritan Ambroase’s love letter to Cinema, TV and Media. An excerpt from the love letter: The Hollywood Insider’s CEO/editor-in-chief Pritan Ambroase affirms, “We have the space and time for all your stories, no matter who/what/where you are. Media/Cinema/TV have a responsibility to better the world and The Hollywood Insider will continue to do so. Talent, diversity and authenticity matter in Cinema/TV, media and storytelling. In fact, I reckon that we should announce “talent-diversity-authenticity-storytelling-Cinema-Oscars-Academy-Awards” as synonyms of each other. We show respect to talent and stories regardless of their skin color, race, gender, sexuality, religion, nationality, etc., thus allowing authenticity into this system just by something as simple as accepting and showing respect to the human species’ factual diversity. We become greater just by respecting and appreciating talent in all its shapes, sizes, and forms. Award winners, which includes nominees, must be chosen on the greatness of their talent ALONE.\n\nI am sure I am speaking for a multitude of Cinema lovers all over the world when I speak of the following sentiments that this medium of art has blessed me with. Cinema taught me about our world, at times in English and at times through the beautiful one-inch bar of subtitles. I learned from the stories in the global movies that we are all alike across all borders. Remember that one of the best symbols of many great civilizations and their prosperity has been the art they have left behind. This art can be in the form of paintings, sculptures, architecture, writings, inventions, etc. For our modern society, Cinema happens to be one of them. Cinema is more than just a form of entertainment, it is an integral part of society. I love the world uniting, be it for Cinema, TV. media, art, fashion, sport, etc. Please keep this going full speed.”\n\nMore Interesting Stories From The Hollywood Insider\n\n– Want GUARANTEED SUCCESS?
