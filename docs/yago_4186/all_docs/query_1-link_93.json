        "text": "Netflix International’s economy of scale scheme that sees the streamer financing remakes of films that were a success in one culture in another country continues with the new Polish comedy, “Kill Me If You Dare.”\n\n“Zabij mnie, kochanie,” as it is titled in Polish (you can watch the film dubbed or in Polish with English subtittles) may be no better than the Turkish Netflix tale titled “Öldür Beni Sevgilim” when it was released in 2019. But hey, no new money had to be spent on a story they already owned.\n\nIt’s about a quarreling couple who win the Lotto and when their dreams of what to do with the money collide, they conspire to murder each other in the middle of a resort vacation.\n\nNo, that idea doesn’t sound like cinematic “gold,” and user reviews of the Turkish film trended negative. But maybe the Poles figured out how to make it work.\n\nLong Netflix movie review short, they don’t.\n\nPiotr (Mateusz Banasiuk of “Furioza”) proposes to Natalia (Weronika Ksiazkiewicz, also of “Furioza”) in a big romantic gesture at the train station. But five years later, his stinginess is getting on her nerves and her jealousy over him working for a gorgeous ex (Paulina Galazka) have run their marriage into a wall.\n\nEach bitches to her or his bestie — Agata (Agnieszka Wiedlocha) and Lukasz (Piotr Rogucki) respectively. Can this marraige be saved?\n\nThen a Lotto ticket he buys but which she paid for comes up a winner. They have a $million, which solves all their problems, right?\n\nNope. He has conservative investment plans. She dreams of opening a business, traveling and shopping.\n\nThere’s nothing for it but for each to plot to rub the other out. That’s almost how abruptly this idea enters the narrative, which has Agata and Lukasz driving suspicions over this or that “accident” each has at the other’s hands, egging their respective friends into taking “action.”\n\nPiotr’s working vacation to a survivalist/adventure resort gives each her or his chances. What will it be, a sabotaged bit of skydiving, rock climbing, poison at a meal, cooked to death in a sauna?\n\nOur stars don’t have much of a flair for dark comedy, but this heartless, humorless, joyless screenplay is the murder weapon here. It kills this lame idea for a movie.\n\nStill, I can hardly wait for the Spanish language and North American versions of this Netflix is sure to commission. Because who needs to hire clever writers when you already own a “can’t miss” “intellectual property?”\n\nRating: TV-14, murderous situations, sexual situations, profanity\n\nCast: Weronika Ksiazkiewicz, Mateusz Banasiuk, Agnieszka Wiedlocha, Piotr Rogucki, Paulina Galazka and Miroslaw Baka\n\nCredits: Directed by Filip Zylber, scripted by Hanna Węsiersk, based on the 2019 Turkish film scripted by Murat Disli. A Netflix release.\n\nRunning time: 1:34"
