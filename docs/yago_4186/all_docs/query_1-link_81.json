        "text": "Genre in general is a marketing tool, but the label “nonfiction” is a matter of ethics. In the new film “A Cop Movie” (coming Friday to Netflix), the director Alonso Ruizpalacios plays fast and loose with the idea and the practice of nonfiction, but his methods nonetheless do justice to both. The film is a hybrid of documentary and dramatic reënactment, though even saying as much up front is nearly a spoiler, because the movie tips its hand only subtly and winkingly before putting its cards on the table. Ruizpalacios’s unusual, cagey, elusive cinematic gamesmanship does more than present a fascinating and significant array of events; his elaborate form provides access—albeit obliquely—to events that would likely escape straightforward reporting, and to deep-rooted social conditions that would otherwise be hard to depict.\n\nA female police officer named Teresa is keeping watch over the streets of Mexico City by night, alone, at the wheel of her patrol car. The dispatchers on the police radio deliver updates in code and also describe developing situations—a street fight, a truck accident—and send Teresa to an unspecified emergency that turns out to be a woman in labor. She is on the verge of giving birth, with no ambulance in sight or, for that matter, available. Teresa, who discusses her police work both on camera and in voice-over, relates the story—she’d had no training in delivering a child—while Ruizpalacios shows the baby emerging, Teresa handing the newborn to the exhausted and ecstatic mother, figuring out how to cut the umbilical cord, and awaiting the placenta. The paramedics show up long after the baby was born (and, she says, only wanted to take the placenta, because female doctors use it as a beauty aid); the grateful new parents decide to name the newborn after Teresa.\n\nIn granular detail and with extraordinary perceptiveness, Ruizpalacios depicts Teresa’s work and conducts revealing interviews with her. His methods are surprisingly intrusive, as when the camera crew pushes close behind her to record the childbirth. When Teresa speaks about her decision to join the force, seventeen years before, when she was seventeen—over the opposition of her father, who is also an officer—she’s filmed through the windshield of her patrol car. It’s an archetypal shot, familiar from any number of cop movies, and the way it’s composed here suggests that it wasn’t grabbed on the fly but set up with fiction-like forethought.\n\nRuizpalacios films Teresa (whose full name is María Teresa Hernández Cañas) stopping, searching, and arresting a driver. Then, with the suspect in the backseat, Teresa drives off and continues to relate her family story. Later, she’s on another patrol with two male officers who see a driver driving the wrong way on a one-way street and describe him as their “meal ticket.” While they’re shaking him down, a shoot-out occurs and one of the officers is wounded, and Teresa continues her narration to the camera while she’s cradling him. Ruizpalacios’s access to shocking events is so close and intimate that it seems too good to be true—and, indeed, the viewer who is skeptical of his apparently unfiltered access to such dangerous events, or of Teresa’s response, is amply rewarded when Ruizpalacios ultimately reveals how the filming was done. (I’m deliberately being vague so as not to ruin the experience of watching this intellectual mystery unfold.)\n\nA second officer, a man called Montoya, also talks, while on duty, of his youth and his path to the police. A child in a high-crime neighborhood, growing up among criminals, he followed in the footsteps of his older brother, a special-forces officer who brought his colleagues—and their heavy weaponry—to the house, and taught him to handle firearms. Yet when Montoya (whose name is José de Jesús Rodríguez Hernández) joined the force, he insisted on an assignment outside his neighborhood because he feared that anyone he arrested would take revenge on his family. It turns out that Teresa and Montoya are a couple, who met at work and asked to be partnered together—their colleagues call them the Love Patrol. Ruizpalacios films them at home, speaking of their courtship. (Teresa told her boss that she’d bribe him to be partnered with Montoya.) What’s more, when Montoya talks about his self-destructive inclinations—which Teresa helped him to overcome—his story is illustrated on camera, in flashbacks conspicuously reënacted by Montoya (who feared seeing a therapist lest he be declared unfit for duty). There’s a wonderful intersection of the two officers’ stories, depicted with a cannily staged delight almost too good to be accidental, centered on the sweet domestic trivia of a set of keys forgotten at home and tossed down from the balcony. There’s also a chase scene, involving both Teresa and Montoya pursuing a suspect into a subway station, that is filmed amazingly, implausibly, as if the camera operators are everywhere at once.\n\nAbout an hour into the movie, Ruizpalacios reveals the involvement of a pair of actors, Mónica del Carmen and Raúl Briones, in the proceedings. When he discloses their identities, he also interviews them at length about their experience pretending to be officers. In addition, he delivers an extraordinary extra layer of backstory: the actors actually attend police academy and generate their own, covert cell-phone videos of what they witness there, and their observations fuse with the details of Teresa and Montoya’s actual work to produce a disturbing vision of dysfunction within the force and in society at large. The actors note, for instance, the haste and inadequacy of the training that the recruits receive before being sent into the streets with weapons—and attribute it to the large need for new officers to quickly replace the many who are killed on duty.)\n\nOfficers are seen accepting bribes—for instance, Montoya directs traffic to allow a group of schoolchildren to cross, and the guardian of one of them covertly slips coins into his hand—and also giving bribes, as Teresa does, to a department clerk, when she needs paperwork filled out, or as both officers do, at the window where they pick up their weapons and bulletproof vests. Teresa explains that without making those payoffs, they’d get worse guns and dirty vests; what’s more, she says, she’s also expected to pay off her superiors, and those payoffs go, in turn, up the ladder to the highest officials. Just as bribery trickles up, the effects of corruption trickle down—the minimal police training is done with ludicrously improvised equipment (a trainer jokes sardonically about the “state-of-the-art” cardboard targets used on a shooting range). A shocking incident of corruption involves Teresa’s attempt to confront someone in brazen public defiance of the law, who turns out to be under the protection of higher-ups—who instead investigate her.\n\nRuizpalacios hears from a wide range of figures, including a bunch of recruits, other officers, passersby, a barber, and the symphony of second-hand voices that Teresa and Montoya deliver in their interviews with the director. “A Cop Movie” is the 2021 version of Alan and Susan Raymond’s groundbreaking 1976 documentary “The Police Tapes.” Ruizpalacios updates the Raymonds’ embedded, participatory methods with a new form—one that feels apt at a time when the ethics and the law of consent, governmental wariness regarding media, and the slippery trade-offs involving journalistic access are invisibly but decisively shaping documentary images. Along with its trenchant, revelatory depictions and discussion of police work and related political ills, “A Cop Movie” pulls these hidden vectors of image-making, opinion-shaping power to the fore."
