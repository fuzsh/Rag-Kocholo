        "text": "EXCLUSIVE: Out at the Cannes market, LA-based production company Convergence Entertainment Group is launching There There, which is being written and directed by the Polish brothers in their first collaboration in more than a decade.\n\nThe film has begun principal photography and the duo are hopeful it will premiere at the 2025 Sundance Film Festival. This would be the sixth Polish Brothers film to premiere at the festival.\n\nOn There There, each of the twin brothers will write and direct one half of the movie without the other knowing anything about the other, resulting in two separate storylines that will be interwoven into a single feature-length film. This approach will enable each brother to explore the nature of the twin relationship from their own unique perspective without being influenced or constrained by the other’s vision.\n\nThe cast includes Gretchen Mol (Yellowstone), Shannyn Sossamon (The Rules of Attraction), Corbin Bernsen (Major League), Zack Pearlman (The Intern), Logan Polish (The Mosquito Coast), and D.W. Moffett (Friday Night Lights).\n\nThe movie will chart the story of two brothers who have spent 40 long years apart, unaware of each other’s existence. As fate would have it, their paths cross and they are forced to confront the truth that has been hidden from them for so long.\n\n“By allowing each of us to create our own storylines, we hope to capture the complexity, honesty and richness of the twin relationship in a way that has never been seen before on screen,” said Mark Polish. “This is a journey that will tug at audience’s heartstrings and leave people inspired by the incredible resilience of the human spirit.”\n\nMichael Polish added: “We took painstaking measures to keep all details of our respective halves from each other. This has never been done before in the history of cinema and will in many ways be reflective, we think, of the relationship between the two of us.”\n\nThe Polish brothers are known for movies including Twin Falls Idaho, Northfolk and Jackpot. Michael Polish most recently directed Sylvester Stallone movie Alarum.\n\nConvergence is the company set up by Randall Emmett and Joel Cohen in 2022. Recent credits include Savage Salvation (2022), starring Robert De Niro, John Malkovich and Jack Huston, and Gunner (2024) starring Morgan Freeman."
