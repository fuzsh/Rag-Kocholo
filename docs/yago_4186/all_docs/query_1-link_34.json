In the near future, the Tokyo Police Corporation wages a blood-splattered war with the Engineers, a genetically modified group of super-criminals. These mutant mobsters can bio-fuse and surgically implant weapons into their anatomy, turning self-mutilation and body modification into a lethal form of performance art. Meet Ruka, the daughter of a brutally slain police officer, the Corporation’s deadliest Engineer Hunter. With cold-blooded efficiency, she slices and dices her way through the crime world and discovers a lair that operates as the underworld’s freakish fetish club! But no amount of fear can deter Ruka from fulfilling her sworn duty and avenging her father’s death.\n\nWinner of Best Asian Film at the Fantasia Film Festival this brutal action-comedy stars J-Horror icon Eihi Shiina (Takashi Miike’s AUDITION) and is directed by Yoshihiro Nishimura, the special effects visionary behind MUTANT GIRLS SQUAD (2010)."
