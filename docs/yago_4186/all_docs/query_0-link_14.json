        "text": "THE recent presentation in the Palace Theatre of Warsaw of the first section of the French film \"Napoleon,\" directed by Abel Gance, drew a favorable review in the Messager Polonais, a leading foreign language paper of the Polish capital. After explaining that this part of the work carries the story of Napoleon only to the beginning of the campaign in Italy and that the director still has a great and pleasant task before him, the Warsaw reviewer summarizes the first two acts, which show young Bonaparte in school at Brienne, praises the acting of Rudenko, the boy who plays the part of Napoleon, says that the sequences might be shortened with advantage, and continues:\"As a technical novelty M. Abel Gance has employed the process of three screens, through the simultaneous use of three photographic apparatuses. It seems that this process needs considerable improvement, for as it is today it too often produces the impression of shocks and somersaults, of oscillations that are very tiresome to the eyes. But it must be admitted that in this way some very effective views of crowds are obtained. Sometimes the three pictures are fused into one; other times we see them pass separately.\"The most notable scenes of the film are the one showing Rouget de l'Isle singing the 'Marseillaise' before the Convention and the one where the views of the tempest on the Mediterranean during the flight of Napoleon from Corsica, his bark tossed about by the waves, alternate with those showing the storm of human, passions unchained at the Convention. The analogy of the release of passions and of the elements is rare in these two views, where the pictures are superimposed upon each other, are confused and disappear, one by one, in a whirlwind. It certainly seems symbolical that the night that saw the fall of Danton also saw Napoleon, conqueror of the elements, sailing toward his destiny.\"On the other hand, how false and useless appears the scene where Bonaparte, about to rejoin the Army of Italy, enters the vacant hall of the Convention to talk with the shades of Robespierre, Danton and Marat, to whom he delivers a grandiloquent discourse on the happiness of humanity and general disarmament, which might be all right in the Assembly of the League of Nations, but which is clearly misplaced in the mouth of the greatest conqueror of modern times.\"The rôle of Napoleon is taken by M. Dieudonne, whose features are admirably adapted to this part, which he interprets masterfully and with consummate art. Danton, Robespierre, Marat and Camille Desmoulins are also very good. The women, with Josephine at their head, are mediocre and without beauty. Anyway, their rôles are trifling. The view of the camp of the Army of Italy is magnificent. In its ensemble the film leaves a deep and lasting impression.\""
