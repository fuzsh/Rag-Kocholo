        "text": "DETROIT — They crept through this city clutching their rifles, an army of jittery cops and National Guardsmen surrounded by an armored battalion that seemed more suitable for a Vietnam jungle than a Middle American thoroughfare. But this was war, the early days of an uprising by black Detroiters. And so the mostly white law enforcement regime rolling through the caldron of smoke and rubble was determined to restore order by any means necessary.\n\nThis meant that when a little girl peeked through the blinds of an apartment to see what was going on, the grim outcome was inevitable.\n\n“Sniper in the window!” a Guardsman yelled almost as quickly as he fired shots that all but obliterated the window.\n\nThe camera moves on from the smoky aftermath of this jarring moment in the director Kathryn Bigelow’s latest feature film, “Detroit.” What lingers, however, is the sense of racial terror that pulsed through this city in 1967 during one of America’s most infamous episodes of civil unrest.\n\nMs. Bigelow, the director of “Zero Dark Thirty,” is in her sweet spot when transforming real life into high art. But with “Detroit,” she had to wrestle with how far to push reality — how to convey the real-life horror of racism, without exploiting black trauma. “It’s really a question of how do you humanize and how do you bring to life a situation,” Ms. Bigelow said. “I suppose you use a personal judgment, I guess.”"
