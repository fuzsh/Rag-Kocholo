        "text": "Andrzej Wajda (born March 6, 1926, Suwałki, Poland—died October 9, 2016, Warsaw) was a Polish director and screenwriter who was a leading figure in the “Polish film school,” a group of highly talented individuals whose works brought international recognition to their country’s post-World War II reality.\n\nWajda became interested in the visual arts when working as assistant to a restorer of old church paintings in Radom, Poland. He studied painting at the Academy of Fine Arts in Kraków (1946–49; now Jan Matejko Academy of Fine Arts) and then film directing at the Łódź Film School (1949–53). His debut feature, Pokolenie (1955; A Generation), together with Kanał (1957; “Canal”) and Popiół i diament (1958; Ashes and Diamonds), constituted a popular trilogy that is considered to have launched the Polish film school. The movies deal in symbolic imagery with sweeping social and political changes in Poland during the World War II-era German occupation, the Warsaw Uprising of 1944, and the immediate postwar years. They won Wajda significant attention, including prizes at international film festivals, and Popiół i diament, which was based on a Jerzy Andrzejewski novel, became especially renowned. Its lead actor, Zbigniew Cybulski, became famous for his portrayal of a young man whose idealism survives the humiliation and defeat of the occupation and the deaths of friends and the woman he loves.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nOscar-Worthy Movie Trivia\n\nWith such films as Popioły (1965; The Ashes), Brzezina (1970; The Birch Wood), Wesele (1973; The Wedding), Ziemia obiecana (1975; The Promised Land), Panny z Wilka (1979; The Young Girls of Wilko), and Danton (1983), Wajda established himself as a skilled director of film adaptations of literature that present conflicts inherent in the human situation and that also examine Polish national myths. He engaged with contemporary issues in films such as Wszystko na sprzedaż (1969; Everything for Sale), Człowiek z marmuru (1977; Man of Marble), Bez znieczulenia (1978; Without Anesthetic, or Rough Treatment), and Człowiek z żelaza (1981; Man of Iron). The latter, which was regarded as a manifesto against the ruling communist party in Poland and in support of the Solidarity opposition movement, won the Cannes film festival’s top prize, the Palme d’Or."
