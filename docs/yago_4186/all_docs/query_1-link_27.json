        "text": "\"God did not create you to be poor!\" Sony Classics has revealed an official US trailer for the hand-painted film The Peasants, an animated story of jealous men and angry villagers. They have been working on this for years, painting every single frame by hand to get it looking perfect. The film tells a heartbreaking story about an early 20th Polish peasant woman who creates havoc when she is forced to marry an older rich man. The epic classic novel of Wladyslaw Reymont has been brought to life using the popular realist and pre-impressionist paintings from the 19th Century, with an emphasis on the Young Poland Movement and the works of such artists as Józef Chełmoński, Ferdynand Ruszczyc and Julian Fałat. It's a follow-up to the first hand-painted film Loving Vincent, which was about Vincent Van Gogh. Every last shot is painted by artists, resulting in thousands of paintings at the end of production. The Peasants stars Kamila Urzedowska as Jagna, with Robert Gulaczyk & Mirosław Baka. It first premiered at the Toronto Film Festival last fall, and I recently watched it at the Tallinn Black Nights Film Festival in Estonia. It's worth seeing in theaters.\n\nHere's the official US trailer for DK Welchman & Hugh Welchman's The Peasants, direct from YouTube:\n\nYou can also find the original 2020 concept trailer for The Peasants here, or watch last year's trailer here."
