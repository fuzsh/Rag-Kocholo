        "meta_description": "Films focusing on music, whether musicals or biographies of singers, have had considerable success in the last decade; and opera has been increasingly incorporated into film soundtracks. But the modern opera film seems destined to be a subgenre associated with the 1980s. The majority of modern opera films from the mid-1970s through to the turn of the millennium were principally French-produced or French co-productions. This article considers the early development of the opera film and focuses on the final few opera films made in France – Boris Godounov (Andrzej Žuławski, 1989), Madame Butterfly (Frédéric Mitterrand, 1995) and Tosca (Benoît Jacquot, 2001) – placing them in the context of the challenges faced by the subgenre.",

        "text": "There has been a surge in film musicals and musical films since the turn of the millennium, culminating in the extraordinary success of the bitter-sweet Donen-Kelly imitation, La La Land (Damian Chazelle, 2016) at the 2017 Oscars. This has prompted me to consider the fate of the opera film, a once familiar musical subgenre of the 1980s, and before that of the 1940s and 1950s, as well as of the silent period. It was a subgenre which has led to considerable academic interest; that interest has not abated despite the fact that the opera film is no longer produced. To situate my interest in the opera film, I will attend to the context of the lively production of film musicals and musical films since the millennium. The definition of each of these is not straightforward, but for the purposes of this article I will abbreviate this type of film to ‘musicals’, intended to include films that have a significant instance of musical numbers and to which audiences are likely to be attracted because of the musical element. The purpose of the article is not to explain the phenomenon of the musical’s popularity; but given the evanescence of the opera film, it is useful to consider just how popular the musical has recently become. I will then explore briefly the history of the opera film, with a particular emphasis on the French opera film of the 1980s and beyond.\n\nDespite the fact that staged operas are routinely shown in cinemas, feature film versions of operas have not been seen in cinemas since the early 2000s. The disappearance of the opera film is all the more surprising given the international interest in musical feature films since 2000. I have listed some of these (excluding animated features and TV films) in Tables 1 and 2 with box-office and spectator figures when available. Table 1 lists a selection of Anglophone films. These are mostly film adaptations of stage shows or singer biopics. If some of the Anglophone films come relatively low in the ‘all time’ US domestic box office (Pitch Perfect 2 [Elizabeth Banks, 2015] at 217, Straight outta Compton [Gary Gray, 2015] at 296 – both of these curiously ahead of The Sound of Music [Robert Wise, 1965] at 301 – La La Land [Damien Chazelle, 2016] at 327 and Mamma Mia! [Phyllida Loyd, 2008] at 360), Table 1 shows that film musicals and musical films have done very well at the US domestic box office in the 2001–2017 period, with three of them in the top 100 (Straight outta Compton at 80, La La Land at 82 and Les Misérables [Tom Hooper, 2012] at 83, with the biopic Walk the Line [John Mangold, 2005] not far behind at 102).1 Moreover, these films tend to be in the first 50 of the films produced in their year of release. A further measure of their success is the number of prizes they receive: the period in question is framed by Chicago (Rob Marshall, 2002) and La La Land’s six Oscars apiece, with many films attracting a significant number of prizes, including, perhaps surprisingly, John Carney’s Irish-produced Once (2007).\n\nAlthough the data is not as weighty in the French industry’s case, there is nonetheless a similar picture for a selection of some of the better-known Francophone films, as can be seen in Table 2, with spectator numbers regularly going over the (for the French industry) critical one million mark. Like the Anglophone films, they regularly receive prizes, including the coveted Césars, the French equivalent of the Oscars. Moreover, some of these French films also figure high internationally when distributed outside France. It is telling, for example, that a heritage remake like Les choristes (Christophe Barratier, 2004) and an art-house film such as 8 femmes (François Ozon) should almost double their box office when distributed abroad. And the Édith Piaf biopic, La môme (Olivier Dahan, 2007), not only doubled its box office internationally but also received two Oscars as well as five Césars.\n\nConclusion\n\nLooking back at the development of the French opera film, it is very tempting, teleology notwithstanding, to see Louise and Tosca as the beginning and the end of what was possible for the opera film, with the various films in between as interesting but failed experiments. Both Louise and Tosca mimic the melodrama and theatricality of opera by rejecting exteriors and focusing instead on studio sets that push what we see towards melodramatic fantasy anchored in artistically reimagined sets. But then we could ask what makes a staged opera with its sets different from a filmed opera with its sets? Apart from the temptation of realism – which means the use of exteriors – that most opera films display, and which Rosi’s Carmen managed so well, the attraction of the more successful opera films lies in their fractured reality. This can be the mise en abyme we find in Boris Godounov with its references to the twentieth century. But it can be the flagrant use of the studio, which we also find in Boris Godounov, as well as in Louise and Tosca. As Beylie wrote when reviewing Louise in 1987, ‘it is the trompe-l’œil décors that charm us’ (1987: 65).\n\nSiegfried Kracauer considered that opera film was ‘a collision of two worlds detrimental to both’ and that at best it could only be ‘an eclectic compromise between irreconcilable entities – a sham whole distorting either the opera or the film or both’ (1960: 154). He follows these comments with his view of what works and what does not work in Louise, the main element being in his view, as in the view of Gance’s contemporaries, the ‘significant camera work’. And he singles out one and only one sequence that in his view manages to achieve ‘a precarious equilibrium between music and imagery’: it is the father’s aria towards the end of the film, a kind of lullaby in which he laments Louise’s passage from childhood into a wilful independence and during which she sits on his knees as he rocks her (1.11). Kracauer writes: ‘The camera approaches the two closely, isolates their faces, and […] draws us into the very vortex of inarticulate childhood, whose memory the song itself evokes’ (154; see Figure 19).\n\nI would argue that the most successful opera films combine several elements: the interrogation of realism through elaborate and obvious studio sets and/or mise en abyme; the use of mobile camerawork; and perhaps most importantly in conjunction with these, as Kracauer points out above, the use of close-up which draws us into the emotion vehicled by the song and its percolation through the body of the singer. Ultimately, the difference between a staged opera and an opera film lies in the difference between distance and closeness. The proscenium arch coupled with the ritualistic elements of ‘going to the opera’ encourage the distance of a performed rite, while the closeness afforded by the close up in most opera films breaks that distance down leading to the opposite of ritual distance: the intimacy of human emotion felt through the combination of song and facial expressions.\n\nNotes\n\nCompeting Interests\n\nThe author has no competing interests to declare.\n\nFilmography\n\n2001: A Space Odyssey, 1968.
