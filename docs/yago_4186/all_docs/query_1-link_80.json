Our goal is to celebrate and enjoy contemporary Polish culture in a special way, surrounded by friends and guests from Poland to make the experience more vivid and personal.\n\nThe first festival will be held in the middle of May 2024. The Board of Directors has been finalized but you are vey welcome to get involved as a volunteer! Please contact us at: kfdc@thekf.org\n\nThank you!\n\nThe Festival Executive Committee:\n\nBarbara Bernhardt, Festival Executive Director\n\nAnna Tarnawska, Festival Artistic Director\n\nMartin Kabat, Festival Board of Directors’ Chairman"
