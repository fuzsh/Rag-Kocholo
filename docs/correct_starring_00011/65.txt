Bill Nighy is an English actor.

Biography[]

Born William Francis Nighy in Caterham, Surrey, he studied at Guildford School of Acting and performed at Liverpool's Everyman Theatre before a London debut in Illuminatus!, which led to his being cast in several television and film productions. He gained local recognition for his role in The Men's Room, and international success for playing ageing rocker Billy Mack in Love Actually.

Though best known for comedies, Nighy has a variety of credits to his name, from blockbusters such as the Underworld, Harry Potter and Pirates of the Caribbean series to more thoughtful pieces such as Gideon's Daughter and Notes on a Scandal. He also provided voices for a number of films including Flushed Away and Rango (as Rattlesnake Jake)

Singing[]

Nighy sang several times in his career, beginning with the radio adaptation of The Lord of the Rings, in which he played Samwise Gamgee. He later sang as two different fictional rock stars, the lead vocalist of "Strange Fruit" Ray Stubbs in Still Crazy and cynical Billy Mack in Love Actually.

Nighy also performed "You Really Got Me" in The Magic Roundabout, "Make Someone Happy" as Grandsanta in the holiday film Arthur Christmas and "Won't You Go Lassie, Go" as the grizzled actor Ambrose Hilliard in Their Finest.
