        "text": "While it may have been made all the way back in 2003, the adoration for Love Actually is yet to lessen. Dubbed by many as the best Christmas film ever made, it's become an integral part of the holiday.\n\nWith doomed romances, an affair and a love triangle, it might be that many thought it wasn't quite in the festive spirit. However, 20 years on, the cast reunited to reminisce on the film's success.\n\nIt always had an impressive cast list but when Hugh Grant, Dame Emma Thompson and more returned to the TV screen, fans had burning questions about their latest projects and the adventures they've had since the film, reports KentLive.\n\nREAD MORE: Cambridge pub manager 'absolutely devastated' as rising bills mean business will be sold\n\nMost of were already household names but their careers far from ended with the success of Love Actually. Many now titans of the film industry, we've compiled a list of exactly what they got up to since the film.\n\nNot everyone was a recognised face when the movie came out - and while some may argue that Love Actually came at the end of a few stars' peaks, it was just the beginning for other cast members. From The Walking Dead to the Harry Potter, to the Queen's Gambit and tragically, a heart-breaking death - let's see where the cast of Love Actually have ended up after all these years.\n\nHugh Grant\n\nWhen Love Actually came out, Hugh Grant was already one of the many dreamy faces of the 90s rom-com. The Oxford educated actor really made his name with Four Weddings and a Funeral in 1994, before going on to star in Notting Hill and Bridget Jones' Diary between 1999 and 2001.\n\nLove Actually and the the Bridget Jones sequel 'The Edge of Reason' would be Hugh's biggest successes for a while though. The mid-to-late 2000s saw a couple of high-profile flops for the actor such as Music and Lyrics and Did You Hear About the Morgans?\n\n2012 saw him play six different characters in the Wachowski sisters' experimental science fiction epic Cloud Atlas, but recent years have seen Hugh find his feet again. Starring in the critically beloved Paddington 2 in 2017 and the BBC's A Very English Scandal in 2018, recapturing public acclaim.\n\nHe's gone on to star in HBO's 2020 miniseries The Undoing , and has recently been in the spotlight for his criticism of Brexit and the Conservative government. Projects that are just beginning include the release of Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery, which will premiered on December 23, on Netflix. A film after the popular game Dungeons and Dragons is currently in post production.\n\nLiam Neeson\n\nAn unlikely star of Love Actually, Liam Neeson is far better known for his action movie appearances than his rom-com roles. Despite this, his role as a bereaved but sensitive dad to Sam is a true highlight of the film - and shows Neeson's impressive emotional range, too.\n\nHaving made his breakout appearances in 1998's Les Miserables and 1999s Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace, Neeson would go on to be an absolute staple of the action thriller genre. His most well known appearance was undeniably in the Taken franchise, having appeared in all three movies, as well as appearing in several Star Wars spin-off shows.\n\nThat Star Wars connection has far from stopped with him continuing to voice Qui-Gon Jinn in a number of TV series. He played a big part in Amazon's Made in Italy in 2020, which he starred in alongside his son. Fans of the Irish star were delighted to see him make a guest appearance in comedy Derry Girls as well this year.\n\nMartine McCutcheon\n\nOne of the less well known names from Love Actually , Martine McCutcheon isn't one of the film's megastars. However, her role as Natalie opposite Hugh Grant is an iconic and heartwarming one - but surprisingly it didn't lead Martine to the same heights as some of her co-stars.\n\nHaving made her name on Eastenders as Tiffany Raymond and on The Bill as Amanda Jones, Love Actually was arguably the peak of her career at the time. She'd go on to make appearances in some well known British TV shows, including BBC's Spooks, ITV's Marple and even Midsomer Murders - but hasn't appeared in anything since her 2018 appearance in the heart warming Kent based flick, The Bromley Boys.\n\nShe has occasionally made an appearance on Loose Women and has been open about some of her more recent struggles. She tragically lost her brother at the age of just 31 and revealed that she had to file for bankruptcy in 2013.\n\nShe has also shared her health battles with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome and Fibromyalgia.\n\nHeike Makatsch\n\nAnother obscure cast member, Heike is a German actress who's performance as Alan Rickman's seductive secretary Mia was responsible for one of the saddest scenes in the entire film - which we'll come on to later. She was married to Daniel Craig at the time of Love Actually's release - though they divorced in 2004 - and since then the vast majority of her career has been in German film.\n\nShe played a big role in an English language film, the 2013 adaptation of The Book Thief, where she appeared as the mother of the main character alongside Geoffrey Rush and Emily Watson. It's thought she currently lives in Berlin and has been filming in Majorca for German series Der Konig von Palma - which translates to The King of Palma.\n\nBill Nighy\n\nBack to one of Love Actually's bigger names, Bill Nighy's reputation hardly needs introduction. An effortless comedic actor, he brought a sense of laid-back, washed up apathy to the role of Billy Mack that makes it hard to imagine anyone else playing the character.\n\nIt might surprise you to know then that Love Actually was actually Nighy's biggest cinematic release to date, with his biggest prior hit being in one season of Kiss Me Kate on BBC1. But Love Actually seemingly turbocharged his career, leading to roles in Shaun of the Dead, Pirates of the Carribean as Davy Jones, Doctor Who, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows and The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel.\n\nIn more recent years, Nighy's biggest hits have surprisingly been linked to videogames - appearing in the Pokemon: Detective Pikachu movie, whilst also appearing in the Destiny series of games, and in the Netflix TV adaptation of Castlevania.\n\nCurrently in post production, he make voice appearances in The Button Maker and Bloody Fury.\n\nGregor Fisher\n\nFollowing on from Bill Nighy, let's take a look at his less celebrated counterpart, his portly manager Joe. Played by Gregor Fisher, Joe was the other half to failing pop singer Billy Mack, giving some really memorable moments of deadpan comedy throughout the film.\n\nA smaller part with a less renowned actor playing him, Gregor's career hasn't kicked on quite to the same highs as Bill Nighy's has in recent years. His most recent project, The Cockfields, sees Gregor appear alongside Joe Wilkinson and Diane Morgan in a classic sitcom format.\n\nHowever, in pre-production is The Inn at the Edge of the World. According to IMDB, it's based upon the award winning book by Alice Thomas Ellis, \"The Inn at The Edge Of The World\".\n\nIt is a drama about five people who respond to an advert to escape Christmas and all its enforced jollity in London and retreat to an Inn off the West coast of Scotland.\n\nEmma Thompson\n\nArguably the best performer in an already star-studded cast, Emma Thompson's role as the heartbroken Karen in Love Actually produces some of the film's best scenes, as she sobs upon realising her husband's infidelity. An established name having appeared in 1995's Sense and Sensibility, Thompson's career has continued an upward trajectory since Love Actually.\n\nAppearing in the Harry Potter franchise, as well as Nanny McPhee, 2016's Bridget Jones' Baby, the live-action Beauty and the Beast remake, and even the 2019 spiritual successor to Love Actually Last Christmas, Emma's career has maintained an impressive level of consistency. She horrified the UK as the chillingly charismatic fascist politician Vivienne Rook in Russel T. Davies' 2019 BBC hit Years and Years and appeared in Disney's Cruella. She's currently starring as Miss Trunchball in Roald Dahl's Matilda the Musical.\n\nAndrew Lincoln\n\nA slightly forgettable (and on reflection a tad creepy) character in Love Actually, Andrew Lincoln's career has gone on to be something wholly unexpected in the 2010s. Now best known for his appearance as the rugged former police officer Rick Grimes on The Walking Dead, his presence in Love Actually is almost a surprise if you twig that the zombie-smashing policeman and the Christmas film's Mark are actually the same person.\n\nHe's also appeared in a number of well known TV shows, appearing on Holby City in 2004, and a Wuthering Heights miniseries alongside Tom Hardy in 2009. However, his eight year stint on The Walking Dead between 2010 and 2018 will be remembered as his career's biggest legacy - starring in one of the biggest shows of the last decade. Since then he's appeared in Guillermo del Toro's Cabinet of Curiosities and according to IMDB, he's currently at pre-production for an untitled Walking Dead spin-off.\n\nAlan Rickman\n\nA titan of British cinema, Alan Rickman's performance as the deadpan Severus Snape is simply iconic, but his role in Love Actually showed a softer side. His reputation as Harry Potter's potions teacher is his best known performance though, appearing in every movie in the series.\n\nHe got his big break playing Hans Gruber in Die Hard, way back in 1988, whilst also making well known appearances in Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves in 1991, and Sweeney Todd in 2007. Rickman was also a core cast member in the Tim Burton Alice in Wonderland films, with Alice Through the Looking Glass being his final on-screen appearance in 2016.\n\nThe titan of British cinema, effortlessly sneering his way into recognition as one of the greatest actors of the last 50 years, Rickman tragically passed away on January 14, 2016, aged just 69 years old.\n\nKeira Knightley\n\nAnother star to break out in part because of Love Actually, Knightley's appearances in the Star Wars franchise and Bend It Like Beckham actually came before she took on the role of Juliet. Since then, she's gone on to star in 2005's Pride and Prejudice, the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise, as well as appearing in 2018's Collette.\n\nStill going strong, Knightley is currently in filming for the upcoming Boston Strangler movie, playing an investigative journalist in the uncovering of an infamous American serial killer case.\n\nJoanna Page\n\nJoanna Page's appearance opposite Martin Freeman as a sex-scene body double is one of the lighter moments in Love Actually. But, of course, that's not what you likely know her from. The BAFTA-winning actress was the titular Stacey in the classic sitcom Gavin & Stacey, and has also appeared in Midsomer Murders and Doctor Who.\n\nHer current gig is presenting Shop Well For Less on BBC1, which she's been on since 2021. She's also on Dog Squad as Tinks, voice-acting.\n\nColin Firth\n\nOscar winner Colin Firth is another of the megastars to appear in Love Actually. Having already appeared in a classic rom-com in Bridget Jones' Diary , Love Actually cemented Firth's talent for playing a slightly awkward if endearing romantic lead, having to negotiate a language barrier and extreme social awkwardness as Jamie.\n\nThis type of role seemed to be where Firth found much success, playing some similar characters in Nanny Mcphee and Mamma Mia, whilst also appearing in the 2007 adaptation of St Trinian's. But it would be The King's Speech in 2010 where Firth would hit his peak, turning out as a stammering and sweary King George VI, earning him an Oscar.\n\nSince then, Firth has appeared in a number of big franchises, including Kingsman: The Secret Service , Mamma Mia: Here we go Again, and the WWI epic 1917. Firth's appeared in 2021's Operation Mincemeat, a WWII film but his most recent appearances have been in Empire of Light and the TV mini series The Staircase.\n\nMartin Freeman\n\nFew have a career to parallel Martin Freeman's. Having already made a splash with comedy sketch show Bruiser and in the classic cult hit The Office, Love Actually simply accelerated an already upward-trending career.\n\nShaun of the Dead came next, followed by 2009's Christmas cheese-fest Nativity - but his career would soon explode. In a succession of mega-hits including playing Watson in BBC's Sherlock, Bilbo Baggins in The Hobbit franchise, Lester Nygaard in the grim black comedy Fargo and taking up a role in the Marvel Cinematic Universe in Captain America: Civil War and Black Panther among other films, Freeman's career has included some of the biggest shows and films of the 21st century.\n\nMartin Freeman recently returned to the MCU as Everett K. Ross in Black Panther: Wakada Forever.\n\nChiwetel Ejioforv\n\nLittle more than a bit-part character Chiwetel Ejiofor's role as Peter is a minor part in Love Actually - but his career has taken off in similar fashion to his in-film romantic rival played by Andrew Lincoln. Appearing in disaster movie blockbuster 2012 in 2009, his biggest appearance to date was as the lead character in multi-Oscar winning 12 Years a Slave, a brutal historic depiction of the American slave trade alongside Brad Pitt and Michael Fassbender - a far cry from Love Actually.\n\nHis career has remained in a strong place since then, appearing in the live action Lion King adaption, and he also appeared in the new Marvel flick Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness.\n\nKris Marshall\n\nA true early 2000s throwback, Kris Marshall made his name as the empty-headed Nick on BBC sitcom My Family, before playing the similarly clueless Colin \"God of Sex\" Frissell in Love Actually. In the years following the 2004 movie, his biggest role was, bizarrely, in a BT advert campaign that ran as a sort of series over a staggering 6 years, that came to an end in 2011.\n\nSince then he's re-established himself as part of the British sitcom furniture, appearing as Dave in the BBC's Citizen Khan , and most recently playing DI Humphrey Goodman in the BBC's Death in Paradise. In 2021, he appeared in another Christmas film - Father Christmas Is Back, alongside John Cleese and Kelsey Grammer. He will reprise his role as DI Humphrey Goodman in Death in Paradise in 2023.\n\nLaura Linney\n\nAnother bit-part character, Laura Linney's appearance as Sarah in Love Actually is easy to miss - (she's in the wedding reception scene). The film was arguably a step down from her starring role in 1998's classic The Truman Show as Meryl Burbank.\n\nHowever, since Love Actually she's made some big-ticket appearances, such as a guest appearance in a 2018 episode of BoJack Horseman, as well as starring in and producing Ozark. She has some projects in the works, set to star in both The Miracle Club and Suncoast which are both in post-production.\n\nThomas Brodie-Sangster\n\nAn utterly unexpected - but well earned - breakout from Love Actually came in the form of child star Thomas Brodie-Sangster. Playing Sam, the adorable son of Liam Neeson, Brodie-Sangster's career started young but has been truly star-studded.\n\nAppearing in Game of Thrones as Jojen, as well as Nanny McPhee, Dr Who, the Maze Runner franchise and Netflix's smash hit The Queen's Gambit , the 31 year-old's career has maintained a staggering pace since his appearance in Love Actually aged just 13. This year, he's appeared in Pistol, a TV series based on the memoir of Steve Jones, the legendary Sex Pistols guitarist who helped usher in a punk revolution in Britain.\n\nLucia Moniz\n\nPlaying Aurelia, the Portuguese muse to Colin Firth's character, Lucia Moniz is actually Portuguese - and hasn't had much of an acting career since Love Actually. In fact, Moniz is much better known for her singing than acting, having represented Portugal in 1996 at the Eurovision song contest.\n\nShe has released 5 albums as a singer-songwriter, and most recently appeared in the TV series Santiago.\n\nREAD NEXT:"
