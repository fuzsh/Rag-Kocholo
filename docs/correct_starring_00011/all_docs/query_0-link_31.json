Mixed reviews. It's very slow to start one or two even nodded off! It got slightly better but it wasn't what any of us were expecting it to be.\n\nI think it's better than Remains of the Day Riverwalk Bill Nighy is the perfect actor to play a middle class Englishman.\n\nAs you say, perhaps not a weepy in the normal sense of the word.\n\nBut tears of sadness, anger and frustration did sting the back of my eyes, at some scenes.\n\nAlong with a few of the comments here, I have also heard some people I know describe this film as \"slow\" or \"boring\".\n\nI haven't been to the cinema for about 4 years (I don't like going on my own and my husband has lost interest in TV, cinema, etc, etc). I had read the very good reviews of Living and mentioned it to a friend who said she'd like to see it too - we were both willing to risk being bored.\n\nWe both thought it was an absolutely wonderful film - great acting, photography, music - and story. I found it full of meaning and very moving.\n\nIsnt it funny how we all see things differently!\n\nSounding the same in every film lots of actors seem to do something along those lines. Once they are known for a 'type' they get cast as it."
