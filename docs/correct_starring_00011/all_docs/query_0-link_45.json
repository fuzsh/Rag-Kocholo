        "text": "Bill Nighy, the beloved star of Love Actually, has seen his acclaimed film Living make its grand debut on Netflix UK.\n\nThe 2022 cinematic gem, a reimagining of Akira Kurosawa's iconic Ikiru, features Nighy, aged 74, in the role of a civil servant facing a terminal illness who seeks to infuse his monotonous existence with meaning.\n\nLiving captivated audiences upon its release two years prior, and is often hailed as Nighy's finest work. His portrayal garnered him an unprecedented Oscar nod, although he ultimately conceded the award to Brendan Fraser for The Whale.\n\nAs of July 3, viewers across the UK and Ireland can indulge in Living via Netflix streaming.\n\nJoining Nighy in this box office success, which raked in a cool $12.1 million, are Aimee Lou Wood of Sex Education fame, Tom Burke, Alex Sharp, Lia Williams, and Matilda Ziegler, under the direction of Oliver Hermanus, reports the Daily Star.\n\nAimee, 29, a Netflix sensation herself, shared her experiences working on Living and the joy of acting alongside Nighy, who famously played the irreverent rockstar Billy Mack in 2003's Love Actually.\n\n\"What I love about Bill is he is an actor who cares so deeply about the work and is so detailed and has so much depth when it comes to his performance. At the same time, he doesn't talk really about his process or anything like that,\" Aimee revealed in a chat with Digital Spy.\n\nSpeaking of her admiration for him, she expounded: \"I just admire him so much as a person. He's so kind, and he's so generous, and he's so open, and he's so playful and curious. I found him really inspiring as a person, and I think that also is exactly what he is as an actor.\"\n\nBill's rise to stardom began in the late '70s when he first dipped his foot into theatre, later escalating to higher-profile roles in numerous films. His international recognition was ignited following his appearance in Love Actually, and subsequently, he starred in hits like Pirates of the Caribbean, Hot Fuzz, Shaun of the Dead, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1, and The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel.\n\nHis successful and illustrious career trajectory has seen him clinching a BAFTA and Golden Globe Award, along with nominations for an Academy Award, Tony Award, and Lauren Olivier Award."
