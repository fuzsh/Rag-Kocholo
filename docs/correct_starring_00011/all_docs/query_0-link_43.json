Do you have time?\n\nWell, I'm working on my thesis, but, um...\n\nWell, we could talk about it over a drink,\n\nif you think it would help.\n\nI first became interested in acting at my secondary school\n\nwhere we had a drama priest\n\nwho was keen on putting on plays.\n\nAnd I was tall, which was a result,\n\nbecause it meant I didn't have to play girls.\n\nI ended up going to a drama school.\n\nIt was the Guildford School of Dance and Drama.\n\nI think I learned\n\nnot to have my tongue hanging out of my mouth.\n\nI remember I did one play and a friend of mine said,\n\nThat was interesting, that thing with your tongue.\n\nI said, What thing with my tongue?\n\nShe said, You had your tongue out a lot of the time,\n\nbut I had no idea\n\nthat I had my tongue out a lot of the time,\n\nso I learned to keep my tongue in my mouth.\n\nI don't think I've ever met anyone like you.\n\nNo. Well, you wouldn't,\n\nwould you? Why?\n\nThere isn't anyone quite like me.\n\nThe Men's Room was a TV series,\n\nand it was the first time\n\nI'd ever played a lead in a TV series.\n\nThere was a lot of sex in it.\n\nI had to have, I had seven sex scenes,\n\nseven sex scenes, say that quickly,\n\nwith four different women.\n\nAnd I remember I was in a hotel lobby\n\nand a guy handed me a paper,\n\nand I hadn't watched the thing and I don't,\n\nand I was in such a state of self-consciousness\n\nthat I didn't have any clear memory of it.\n\nAnd he handed me the newspaper with the medical page.\n\nAnd on the medical page it said,\n\nIf you have a pacemaker or any kind of heart issue,\n\ndo not attempt the things that Mr. Nighy does on BBC2.\n\nAnd I was thinking, What did I do on BBC2?\n\nAnd then later I did see in another newspaper\n\nin the listings for the TV it said cunnilingus on BBC two.\n\nWow. So, you know, and I have no memory of that either.\n\nAll I remember is trying to obscure\n\nvarious parts of different women's bodies, which was my gig,\n\nwhich was your responsibility as the man,\n\nbecause there were so many parts of women\n\nthat weren't allowed to be on television.\n\nAnd then you'd end up in ridiculous positions,\n\nand then somebody would say, Action,\n\nand you felt like saying, Really?\n\n♪ Hope won't save me ♪ Hi, kids.\n\nHere's an important message from your Uncle Bill:\n\nDon't buy drugs. [lively upbeat music]\n\n♪ 'Cause I just want you here tonight ♪\n\nBecome a pop star and they give you them for free.\n\nThe casting of Love Actually involved a read through,\n\nor I think what they call in America, a table read.\n\nAnd there was a tradition in those days\n\nthat casting people would ask a favor of actors,\n\nand they would ask you to do a table read\n\nwith no possibility of you getting the job.\n\nAnd it was just a courtesy to the casting person.\n\nAnd that was the situation with Love Actually.\n\nI read the part of Billy Mack, and then subsequently,\n\ncompletely to my surprise, I got the gig.\n\nIt changed everything because it was a big hit\n\nand it was a big hit in America,\n\nand it changed the way that I went to work.\n\nAnd it meant that one of the greatest things\n\nthat ever happened to me, and ask any actor,\n\nit meant that I didn't have to audition ever again\n\nfor the rest of my life.\n\nSo that's like one of the biggest things\n\nthat could happen to an actor.\n\nYou don't have to sit in any of those outer offices,\n\nsweating, worrying, short of breath,\n\ngoing in, making a fool of yourself,\n\nand going home and, you know, weeping.\n\n[DJ] Hi, Billy. Hello.\n\n[DJ] We're live across the nation and you're number one.\n\n[Billy chuckling] How will you be celebrating?\n\nI don't know.\n\nEither I could behave like a real rock and roll loser\n\nand get drunk with my fat manager,\n\n[crowd laughing] Or when I hang up,\n\nI'll be flooded by invitations\n\nto a large number of glamorous parties.\n\nRock and roll veterans were a new genre, you know,\n\nthere was, you know, they were only just becoming, so...\n\nAnd they were sort of, somehow they were just funny.\n\nThey may be other things, they may be heroic or romantic,\n\nbut they were also funny.\n\nAnd you only have to mention certain names\n\nand people will smile.\n\nIt's partly because they came out of our youth,\n\nand they're still there, and that's cheerful.\n\nIt's partly because it can get slightly preposterous\n\nin terms of style and delivery.\n\nIt's an amalgam of things you've observed\n\nor listened to over the years.\n\nBut there was no member of the Rolling Stones\n\nthat I was channeling,\n\nor any other real life rock character.\n\nIt was just me kind of, you know,\n\nimagining what I might be like if I were,\n\nyou know, in that situation.\n\nElton! Of, of course, of, of, course.\n\nSend an embarrassingly big car and I'll be there. [laughs]\n\nWhen did I realize that Love Actually\n\nwould have an impact on my career?\n\nI can't really remember.\n\nIt might have been when bus drivers started honking\n\nor cab drivers would wave,\n\nor people in shops would say, Hey, Bill.\n\nAnd you'd go, Excuse me?\n\nI'd had a very, you know, familiar English career\n\nand I was happy, there was no,\n\nyou know, I wasn't in any trouble,\n\nbut this just took it up to another level.\n\nI just wanted you to be strong, and,\n\nand not give up because you lost your dad.\n\nPhillip, you don't have to explain.\n\nI wanted to be a part of Shaun of the Dead\n\nbecause the script was one of the best scripts I'd ever read\n\nin my life, and it made me laugh in a whole new way,\n\nbecause the jokes were very original\n\nand very dry and very droll and very different.\n\nAnd then I met Simon Pegg and Nick Frost,\n\nand they were great, you know,\n\nand they were charming and they made me laugh.\n\nA lot of my experience on Shaun of the Dead\n\nwas bleeding to death in the back of a Jaguar,\n\nor actually it was a Daimler, and I had a,\n\nlike a blood tube up my trouser leg and a blood sack.\n\nAnd it was a very hot summer,\n\nso I sat in a congealing pool of fake blood\n\non a leather seat for hours and hours and hours.\n\nAnd they would pop in every now and again to make me laugh,\n\nand it was very kind.\n\nThey would do their,\n\nthey both did knockout Al Pacino impersonations.\n\nSo they would come in and give me a bit of Al\n\nand then they'd go away,\n\nand I'd feel a little better about that.\n\nI did like that moment in the movie\n\nwhere his stepdad becomes tender towards him.\n\nAnd for a long time, young men,\n\nthey're all between 17 and 39, come up to me\n\nand they would say, You've got red on you.\n\nOr they'd say, I'm not your dad.\n\nWell, we look forward to seeing you tomorrow, then.\n\nOkay. You've got red on you.\n\nWhat kept me coming back to the Shaun of the Dead,\n\nHot Fuzz, At World's End, axis of evil,\n\nit was just very good fun, you know?\n\nAnd the scripts were always great and I am proud,\n\nbecause they called those three movies,\n\nthey are officially called the Cornetto Trilogy.\n\nAnd that's because there is an ice cream in England\n\ncalled a Cornetto, and that there is a Cornetto featured\n\nin each of those movies.\n\nIt's so stupid it doesn't bear thinking about.\n\nAnd in fact, in one of the movies,\n\nthey had a shot simply of a Cornetto wrapper floating,\n\nbeing blown in the wind across the street,\n\nin order to be able to call it the Cornetto Trilogy.\n\nThat's how serious they are.\n\n[gentle ominous music] Do you fear death?\n\nDo you fear that dark abyss?\n\nAll your deeds laid bare.\n\nI can't remember the reason for my reluctance\n\naround playing an octopus man in Pirates of the Caribbean.\n\nI remember sitting in the back of a car\n\nand the estimable, marvelous Gore Verbinski rang me,\n\nhe was on a mobile phone,\n\nwho I'd never spoken to before in my life.\n\nHe said, Come on, how many times\n\ndo you get to be in a pirate movie?\n\nI said, Well, what does he sound like?\n\nAnd he said, Wet.\n\nI said, Well, yeah, okay. That didn't really help.\n\nSo I said, Yeah, but like, where wet, where from?\n\nAnd he said, Well, he said,\n\nThe ship is called the Flying Dutchman,\n\nso maybe he's Dutch.\n\nNobody can do Dutch except Dutch people.\n\nSo I said, Well, how about Scot?\n\nHe said, Yeah, great, how does that sound?\n\nSo I end up doing this Scottish accent\n\nin the back of a car on a mobile phone, with the driver\n\nlooking in the rear view mirror going, 'What?\n\nAnd it was all a bit, you know, awkward.\n\nAnd then by the end of the phone call,\n\nI think I'd agreed to be in the movie.\n\nAnd then when I got there, I didn't realize\n\nthat I wouldn't have a costume like everybody else.\n\nSo I actually phoned the costume department and said,\n\nIs my costume coming anytime soon?\n\nAnd they said, Has nobody told you?\n\nI said, Told me what?\n\nThen it turned out I had to wear computer pajamas\n\nwith white bobbles all over them\n\nand a skull cap with a bobble on the top\n\nand 250 dots painted out on my face.\n\nAnd sneakers, I mean trainers,\n\nwhich is a stretch for me anyway,\n\nbut trainers with a bobble on top.\n\nAnd then they introduce you\n\nto Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom.\n\nIf you ever felt lonely before, now it's for real.\n\nAnd I used to wonder about the set,\n\njust saying, The money, over and over in my mind,\n\n'cause they gave me quite a lot of money, that's why I went.\n\nI went for the money.\n\nAnd people wouldn't have lunch with me, it was too sad.\n\nMembers of the crew would go, Hey, hey,\n\nyou know, Hi, hi, you know, and they'd just walk away\n\nbecause it was just too sad\n\nto see this man in late middle age\n\ndressed as somebody who didn't get into Devo, or something.\n\nIt's one of the things I'm most proud of,\n\nthat I didn't go to the airport, you know, I didn't go,\n\nDo you know what, I thought I could do it.\n\nPlease, can I go home now? I didn't do that.\n\nAnd it was right up until\n\nGore said action for the first time,\n\nI really didn't have much of an idea.\n\nAnd then I just went, and it's amazing what happens\n\nwhen you're very, very scared.\n\nI keep the boy. 99 souls. [pirates chuckling]\n\nBut I wonder, Sparrow, can you live with this?\n\nAnd I went into a sort of violent Scottish accent,\n\nwhich I'd never done before.\n\nIt just sort of came out and I just kept going.\n\nAnd then at the end he said, Well, that's great.\n\nAnd I was like, Maybe, maybe there's a God, maybe,\n\nwhat do I know?\n\nAnd I didn't really have a clear idea, neither did they,\n\nof what the creature was actually gonna look like,\n\nexcept that they knew he'd have tentacles.\n\nSo every now and again, if I came too close to anybody,\n\nthey'd say, No, you can't do that, I'd say, Why not?\n\nThey'd say, Because your tentacles will get in the way\n\nwhen we paint, when we, you know, put them in.\n\nAnd when I first saw the creature, I was blown away.\n\nAnd it was so incredible.\n\nIn fact, Gore, the first thing he said\n\nto the people who made it was,\n\nGet your acceptance speech ready, that was his remark.\n\nAnd indeed they won an Oscar.\n\nAnd I said to him, when I next saw him, I said,\n\nYou know, it's as you said, you know, every expression,\n\nyou know, all my gestures, all the physical stuff,\n\nit made it on the screen.\n\nHe said, Yeah, but I was lying.\n\nI had no idea if it was gonna make it on the screen,\n\nI just said that to cheer you up.\n\nWhich was, you know, cute.\n\nGlad to be of help. You were nice about my tie.\n\nYes, and today is another cracker, if I may say so, but-\n\nThe moment in the episode of Dr. Who\n\nthat Richard Curtis wrote, which was how I became involved,\n\nwhere I play the art gallery curator, he gets to do\n\nwhat anyone who's aware of Vincent van Gogh\n\nhas always wanted to do, which is to drag him from the past\n\nand say, Look, they're worth 20 million bucks now,\n\nyou can buy dinner.\n\nYou know, which is everybody's art fantasy.\n\nI had conversations with Richard about Vincent van Gogh\n\nand about his suffering, about his mental torture.\n\nAnd that informed that moment,\n\nbecause I tried to remember that.\n\nAnd had it been possible to drag Vincent van Gogh\n\ninto the future, it might have\n\nto some degree eased his mind, but I doubt that.\n\nBut, you never know. Even momentarily.\n\n[uplifting music] I have tears of joy.\n\nThank you, sir.\n\nThank you. You're, you're welcome.\n\nYou're welcome. Sorry about the beard.\n\nIt said in the script, a bow tie,\n\nand the costume person rang me and said,\n\nWhat kind of a bow tie would you like?\n\nAnd I said, Well, I dunno, how about a navy polka dot?\n\nHe said, Fine, then he came back and he said,\n\nI can't find a navy polka dot tie.\n\nI said, Well, don't worry about it, it can be a green,\n\nit could be anything, it was only a thought.\n\nHe said, No, no, no, it's okay,\n\nbecause the women in the wardrobe,\n\nthey're sewing the dots on one by one.\n\nI said, Please, have they started that,\n\nbecause please tell 'em to stop 'cause it's not required.\n\nHe said, No, no, they're happy to do it.\n\nI get down there at three o'clock in the morning,\n\nand the guy who gets me out the car\n\nis taking me to my trailer, and he says,\n\nYou know the ladies in the wardrobe,\n\nyou know they're sewing?\n\nI said, Yeah, I heard about that.\n\nAnd then I go into makeup and the makeup girl goes,\n\nYou know that bow tie?\n\nI said, Yeah, I did hear\n\nthey're sewing them on one by one.\n\nAnd then I go on a set and Matt Smith comes up\n\nand he says, The bow tie!\n\nAnd I said, Yeah, I know about the bow tie.\n\nHe said, Well, it's only right.\n\nHe said, I'd sew shit on your tie.\n\nAnd I said, Can I quote you on that?\n\nAnd he said, Yeah. I said, So now I am, thank you, Matt.\n\nWe, ever your servants, will continue to defend your liberty\n\nand repel the forces that seek to take it from you!\n\nI think the idea of my character in Harry Potter\n\nhaving made the transition from soldier to politician\n\nwas something that I did discuss with David Yates,\n\nthe director, who I'd worked with three times before.\n\nAnd therefore we had a pretty good, you know, thing going,\n\nand I admire him tremendously.\n\nWe've done some great stuff together.\n\n[gentle wistful music]\n\nIs that it then? Not quite.\n\nDumbledore left you a second bequest.\n\nThe sword of Godric Gryffindor.\n\nI did wonder that I was the only English actor\n\nof a certain age that wasn't in Harry Potter.\n\nAnd I was trying to come to some accommodation about that.\n\nYou know, all of my friends were in Harry Potter,\n\nyou know?\n\nAnd I'm not hard to find, do you know what I mean?\n\nI was quite pleased, and my grandchildren, you know,\n\nthey're gonna be thrilled.\n\nI mean, they're only,\n\nI don't think they've seen anything I've done.\n\nThey're completely unaware of my career,\n\ncan you believe that?\n\nThey have no idea who I am.\n\nI assume you're some sort of Secret Service.\n\nAnd the other night I was pissed off\n\nbecause you wouldn't tell me.\n\nWhat makes you think I'm in the Security Services?\n\nBecause most people can tell you\n\nwhy they visit the Middle East.\n\nWell, I've worked with David Hare\n\nall my life, more or less.\n\nHe's the great professional relationship I have.\n\nI've been very, very fortunate\n\nto work with great people more than once.\n\nAnd he, I've worked with more than anyone else.\n\nWe've actually done, he counted recently 10 things together.\n\nThe Worricker trilogy was, you know,\n\na perfect situation for me,\n\nbecause not only was it David's writing,\n\nwhich I love, and I love speaking his dialogue\n\nbecause he writes like nobody else\n\nand he writes great jokes, great world class jokes,\n\nbut also because he was directing it.\n\nHe sort of, he hadn't directed anything for many years\n\nand I've always wanted to play a spy,\n\nand he has the same kind of enthusiasm about spies as I do.\n\nIn other words, a romantic idea.\n\nSo I got to smoke in the rain in a pretty good coat\n\nand a suit, a pretty good suit.\n\nYou know, you'd be walking over Battersea Bridge in London\n\nin the rain, at three o'clock in the morning\n\nsmoking a herbal, obviously, cigarette,\n\nand trying to look cool.\n\nSo it was everything I like, really.\n\nVery formal. Well, um, yeah.\n\nThis is an odd moment for me because I had\n\nthe same moment with my father when I'd just turned 21,\n\nand after it, my life was never the same.\n\nSo I approach it pretty nervously.\n\nAbout Time is probably the film\n\nthat most people talk to me about now.\n\nI don't own a car, so I walk everywhere,\n\nso I meet a lot of people,\n\nand the one they mostly talk to me about now,\n\nand a lot of young people talk to me about now,\n\nis About Time.\n\nWhen I got the part in About Time,\n\nI was very, very moved to be offered it,\n\nbecause I knew it was very personal to Richard Curtis,\n\nwho is the other great professional relationship I've had.\n\nYou know, it transformed my life,\n\nmy relationship with Richard,\n\nAnd About Time I think, you know, he really,\n\nhe said it was gonna be the last film he ever directed,\n\nwhich is bad news for me, but, but I get it,\n\nyou know, I understand.\n\nAnd he said that if I were to follow the suggestions made\n\nor the suggestion made in About Time,\n\nwhy would I direct films?\n\n'Cause they drive you crazy. So I get it.\n\nI thought I had to be like sort of everybody's Dad,\n\na sort of a version of Dad.\n\nAnd the first thing that came to mind\n\nwas Jason Robards in a film called Julia\n\nwith Vanessa Redgrave and Jane Fonda,\n\nwhere he plays Dashiell Hammett and he's not a big part,\n\nbut he made a great impression on me\n\nbecause he was just kind of there, he was around.\n\nAnd they would go off and do brave and heroic things\n\nall over the world during the Second World War,\n\nand they'd come back, he'd be making a fire on the beach,\n\nand he was just there.\n\nAnd he did it with such restraint,\n\nwith any absence of any careerism or selfish concern,\n\nand I wanted to be like that.\n\nI wanted to do it really plain,\n\nwith how I described it to Richard was no acting,\n\nwhich is what everybody says\n\nwhen they don't know what else to say,\n\nbut I meant it, you know.\n\nSo I tried to do it as plainly and as simply as possible.\n\n[seabirds squawking] [gentle wistful music]\n\nSorry, I think I just thought with the time thing...\n\nNo, I never said we could fix things.\n\nI specifically never said that.\n\nThere aren't many people who can get through that scene.\n\nYou know, reading it for the first time, you know,\n\nit moved me tremendously and it always moves me.\n\nAnd people in the street try and tell me about it\n\nand get moved while they're trying to tell me about it.\n\nI think he really, really hit the spot on that one.\n\nBut without it,\n\nthese villages are nothing, they're finished.\n\nThat's what I'd say.\n\nThe film Pride, the story, nobody knew the story,\n\nexcept Stephen Beresford, it seemed, who wrote it,\n\nand the people who lived it.\n\nIt's the most extraordinary story,\n\nbut it wasn't one that anybody wanted to tell,\n\ncertainly not in the press of that time.\n\nI was passionate to be in it,\n\nbecause it was about two things very close to my heart.\n\nOne was the total misrepresentation\n\nof the miner's strike in 1986 in England,\n\nwhere decent men and women were characterized\n\nas enemies of the state by the then government.\n\nWhole communities were decimated,\n\nand they still haven't recovered.\n\nAnd also the emancipation of gay men and women\n\nin my lifetime,\n\nwhich if I were to be asked by my grandchildren\n\nwhich developments in my lifetime\n\nI was sort of obscurely proud\n\nnot to have impeded in any way,\n\nit would be perhaps the civil rights movement in America\n\nand the emancipation of gay men and women in my lifetime.\n\nIt's a magnificent story, and also there's a bit\n\nwhere the unions turn up at the end in buses and coaches\n\nto join the gay pride event, which always makes me cry,\n\nbecause those people\n\nhave come from not wanting to be around anyone gay,\n\nto being to want to hold a banner\n\nand march down the street with them.\n\nThis is a big deal.\n\n[gentle lilting music]\n\nPapa, Mr. Weston is such a good-humored,\n\npleasant, excellent man.\n\nHe thoroughly deserves a good wife,\n\nand you would not have had Miss Taylor\n\nlive with us for ever,\n\nwhen she might have a house of her own?\n\nA house of her own.\n\nWhere is the advantage of a house of her own?\n\nThis is [exhales] three times as large.\n\nI did have a reluctance to be in adaptations of Jane Austin,\n\nCharlotte Bronte, those kind of things,\n\nbecause I couldn't trust myself\n\nnot to be drawn into conventions,\n\nwhich I always am uneasy with\n\nwhen I observe other people doing it.\n\nIn other words, speaking funny, standing very straight,\n\nlike everybody stood up in the 18th century,\n\nI don't think so, and speaking in a way that, you know,\n\nit's like Shakespeare, I don't do Shakespeare.\n\nI mean, I know he's the greatest poet\n\nthat ever walked the Earth, but the performing of it,\n\nI'll leave to other people, because I can't,\n\nI have no real enthusiasm\n\nfor the challenges of the iambic pentameter.\n\nI'd rather, I'm more interested in contemporary idioms\n\nand how to make it sound like it just occurred to you.\n\nThat's the gig, it's not rocket science,\n\nbut it's not nothing either.\n\nBut then I met Autumn de Wilde,\n\nand it was a whole other thing, and she was completely,\n\nyou know, she was very, very impressive,\n\nand she's a brilliant person.\n\nAnd she made it very clear\n\nthat it wasn't gonna be like that.\n\nAnd she was approaching it from a whole other angle.\n\nAnd she came from California and she's a self-described punk\n\nand I thought the combination might work,\n\nand eventually I just thought, Yeah, we'll do that.\n\nFrom a visual point of view,\n\nshe's absolutely meticulous and inspired\n\n'cause she's a photographer.\n\nShe's worked with bands, she's done a lot of videos.\n\nShe's had to do a lot of that stuff on her own\n\nwithout a designer, without anybody, you know,\n\na one-woman band kind of thing.\n\nSo now she's hands-on, so she's checking\n\nif the wallpaper clashes with the coat you're wearing,\n\nforget about it, she's that meticulous.\n\nAnd it's very, it's very impressive.\n\nAnd I was not mistaken,\n\nit was a great experience working with her,\n\nand I hope to work with her again.\n\n[gentle wistful music]\n\nI didn't quite know how I would speak, again,\n\nuntil they rolled on the first day,\n\nuntil somebody said action.\n\nI think I had a line that was something like,\n\nit was a bureaucratic line, like referring to a folder.\n\nAnd I think I had to say something like,\n\nIs the D-19 in situ? or something like that.\n\nI'd spoken the script in my flat\n\nover and over and over and over and over\n\nand over and over and over and over and over again\n\nso that I could give the appearance\n\nof never having said it before, which is the gig,\n\nyou know, it's just, that's what the job is.\n\nYou don't have to have lived something to act it.\n\nThat's sort of the point of acting.\n\nYou don't have to be the thing in order to act it.\n\nThat would only, that would,\n\nif that was a remark that somebody made,\n\nthat would be the remark of someone\n\nwho didn't know what they were talking about.\n\nAnd there are a lot of people who remark in that way.\n\nThe only thing you can really act\n\nis stuff you've observed in other people.\n\nThat's what you act.\n\nSo, for instance, if you are asked\n\nto act somebody who's intoxicated, say,\n\nyou don't act you being intoxicated,\n\nbecause you can't report back reliably\n\nfrom a state of intoxication,\n\nyou act based on observations of other people\n\nwho are intoxicated.\n\nSimilarly, with anything else that may not have,\n\nyou know, that might have happened to you,\n\nor might not have happened to you.\n\nPersonal experience in terms of acting\n\nis seriously overrated.\n\n[gentle upbeat music]\n\nI think the biggest lesson I've learned,\n\n97% of any of the negative thought that happens in my mind\n\nis a lie, a cruel, lousy lie.\n\nSecond thing is you can go to work while it's lying to you,\n\nas long as you have a plan, as long as you're organized.\n\nIt can go on, it's like being tuned to a radio station\n\nthat has nothing but bad news about yourself,\n\nbut you can operate whilst it's nattering.\n\nAnd the third part of that\n\nis other people don't know what's going on in your mind.\n\nHallelujah. Thank you very much."
