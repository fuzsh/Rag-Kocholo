        "text": "14. STILL CRAZY (1998)\n\nDirector: Brian Gibson\n\nWriter: Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais\n\nStarring: Stephen Rea, Billy Connolly, Timothy Spall, Juliet Aubrey, Helen Bergström, Bill Nighy\n\nConsider this Nighy’s warm-up role for “Love Actually” as he plays a lead singer from ‘70s band named Strange Fruit. The band decides to reunite. He plays lead singer Ray Simms, who, after years of drug and alcohol abuse, is now sober. Though claiming to be working on a solo album, Simms has not released anything in 10 years. In his review, Roger Ebert described his character as a “cadaverous poseur living in a Victorian mansion with his bossy Swedish wife while he keeps his gold records stored in a crypt. Meanwhile, Ray suffers a nervous breakdown, exacerbated by turning 50. Ray leaves the gig, buys drugs and literally falls off the wagon and tumbles into a canal. It is Rea’s roadie Tony who saves the day when the band starts the set with the song they last played years at the Wisbech Festival, namely “The Flame Still Burns.” It isn’t in the same league as “This is Spinal Tap” or “The Rutles,” but it mostly gets the job done.\n\n12. THEIR FINEST (2016)\n\nDirector: Lone Scherfig\n\nWriter: Gaby Chiappe\n\nStarring: Gemma Atherton, Sam Claflin, Jack Huston, Jake Lacey, Eddie Marsan, Jeremy Irons, Richard E. Grant, Bill Nighy\n\nWhen there is a global call to arms, the uplifting escape that movies can offer is a necessity and the unique insight that women provide is essential. Both are especially needed when, at any given moment, death lurks around the corner and chin-up optimism is in short supply. That is the rah-rah message behind “Their Finest,” which attempts to wed a ‘30s-style workplace screwball comedy with a misty-eyed World War II drama and, save for a few patchy spots, mostly succeeds. As Catrin Cole, Atherton is a displaced Welsh lass in 1940, who is in need of rent money. But no one fulfills his duty better than that lanky slice of wry known as Bill Nighy, who plays an aging matinee idol making hay as younger thespians are otherwise engaged in the war. As Ambrose Hilliard, the star of a pre-war detective series, Nighy is never less than splendid, whether cozying up to Catrin so she plumps up his self-sacrificing role as drunken Uncle Frank and patiently coaching the real-life Audie Murphy-style American war hero in the cast (Jake Lacy aka leadenness personified) is used as bait for Yankee ticket buyers or conducting a sentimental group sing-a-long in a pub.\n\n11. THE BOOKSHOP (2017)\n\nDirector and Writer: Isabel Coixet\n\nStarring: Emily Mortimer, Patricia Clarkson, Bill Nighy, and Julie Christie as the narrator\n\nEmily Mortimer, Bill Nighy and Patricia Clarkson in one movie? That is a dream team right there. Despite such a quality cast, however, “The Bookshop” will likely test the patience of those who require peppier pacing and more compelling drama, even in a well-meaning film set in a British seaside village in 1959. Director Isabel Coixet’s screenplay, based on Penelope Fitzgerald’s novel, focuses on Florence, a young widow (Mortimer) who decides to open a book store in an old damp house in the heart of the community. That is despite protestations by the town’s wealthy grand dame, Violet (Clarkson), who wants to use the same property for a local arts center — and will stoop to any means to get her way. As for Nighy, he plays Edmund Brundish, a crusty widower who has essentially been a recluse for decades. He does love to read, but as the film’s narrative voice-over tells us, he dislikes the idea that actual people wrote the books. He wants to believe that the novels came about through “spontaneous generation” and spends quality time tearing off and burning any dust jacket carrying the likeness of its author. Such behavior is a trademark of the town.\n\n10. ABOUT TIME (2013)\n\nDirector: Richard Curtis\n\nWriter: Richard Curtis\n\nStarring: Domhnall Gleeson, Rachel McAdams, Tom Hollander, Margot Robbie, Bill Nighy\n\nTim Lake (Gleeson) grows up in Cornell in a house by the sea with his father James (Nighy), mother Mary, absent-minded uncle Desmond, and free-spirited sister Katherine, whose nickname is “Kit Kat”. On his 21st birthday, Tim learns from his father that the men of his family have the ability to travel back in time to moments they have lived before. James discourages his son from using his gift to acquire money or fame, and Tim decides he will use it to improve his love life. That the news is delivered in the most charming off-handedly fashion by his father in the form of Nighy, who never fails to amuse at the very least and astonishes almost always whenever he is onscreen, undercuts the questions that nitpickers might have about the process. One major caveat: You can only revisit and revise portions of your own life. Or as Nighy puts it, “You can’t kill Hitler or shag Helen of Troy.” That Tim tends to go into a Narnia-esque wardrobe to begin his detours into the past adds a quaintly homey touch that is light years away from “Star Trek” or even H.G. Wells. However fuzzy are the rules of the magic are, it is fun to witness Nighy’s ping-pong pantomime at the very least.\n\n9. UNDERWORLD (2003), UNDERWORLD: EVOLUTION (2006), UNDERWORLD: RISE OF THE LYCANS (2009)\n\nDirector: Len Wiseman\n\nWriter: Danny McBride\n\nStarring: Kate Beckinsale, Scott Speedman, Shane Brolly, Bill Nighy, Michael Sheen, Sophia Myles, Robbie Gee\n\nNighy has been participated in several film franchises, which includes this werewolf-vampire hybrid. He rarely gets to play a bad dude on screen, but he gets to do so as the vampire elder Viktor, a Hungarian general and warlord born sometime in the 4th or early 5th century. As he nears the end of his life, Markus Corvinus, the first true vampire offers immortality in exchange for the leader’s military expertise in fighting against werewolves, spawn of Markus’ twin brother William. Viktor eventually becomes vampire elder. While film critics were dismissive of the series of films, audiences seemed to enjoy the concept. Underworld tells the story of Selene ( Beckinsale), a Death Dealer bent on destroying the lycans, who allegedly killed her family. She discovers that the lycans are pursuing a human, Michael Corvin (Speedman), for experimentation; Selene captures Michael herself to find out what the lycans are up to. Along the way, Selene not only discovers a mutinous plot to destroy the vampire Elders, but also a shocking revelation about her father figure Elder, Viktor.\n\n8. SHAUN OF THE DEAD (2004)\n\nDirector: Edgar Wright\n\nWriters: Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright\n\nStarring: Simon Pegg , Kate Ashfield, Lucy Davis, Nick Frost, Dylan Moran, Bill Nighy, Penelope Wilton\n\nThis zom-com stars Simon Pegg as Shaun, a 29-year old slacker who lives in London and doesn’t get along with his stepfather Philip – played by Nighy — and is given the boot by his girlfriend Liz when he fails to celebrate their three-year anniversary together. The next day, the zombie apocalypse is overwhelming the city. They escape in Pete’s car and pick up Philip, who has been bitten, and Barbara. After Ed deliberately crashes Pete’s car, they use Philip’s Jaguar to pick up Liz and her flatmates, David and Dianne. Philip reconciles with Shaun before Philip becomes a zombie. Soon, Shaun is distraught when he is forced to shoot his mother. At 6-foot-2, the lanky Nighy barely has much meat his bones. Somehow in a comedy, however, he possesses a quality that generates instinctive sympathy. When he realizes he has been bit, there is something endearing about his response. It has been clearly established that such bites always lead to death and then rebirth as a zombie. Once bitten, your doom is sealed. But listen to Phil sweetly reassures them, “I ran it under the tap.”\n\n7. NOTES ON A SCANDAL (2006)\n\nDirector: Richard Eyre\n\nWriter: Patrick Marber\n\nStarring: Judi Dench, Cate Blanchett, Bill Nighy, Andrew Connolly\n\nHistory teacher Barbara Covett (Dench) has never married and is near retirement. She also has contempt for her students and fellow instructors. Her only comfort is the diary she keeps. When a new art teacher, Sheba Hart (Blanchett), joins the staff, Barbara is immediately attracted by her and they forge a friendship. Sheba’s husband Richard (Nighy) is quite a bit older than her. She is just re-entering the work force after tending to her special-needs son. But Barbara catches Sheba having sex with a 15-year-old male student. She asks her friend to not tell the school administration until after Christmas. Barbara tells her she isn’t going to rat her out. Over the holidays Barbara visits her sister and she asks if she has any other female friends, implying she is a lesbian. Sheba tells Steven her student that their affair is over yet she can’t stop. Sheba’s husband asks her to move out of their home and she then moves into Barbara’s house. She then discovers her friend’s diary and learns it was her who ratted her out. She leaves Barbara, and is eventually sentenced to 10 months in prison and ultimately reconciles with her family. The film earned four Oscar nominations – Best Actress for Dench, Best Supporting Actress for Blanchett, Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Original Score for Philip Glass.\n\n6. PRIDE (2014)\n\nDirector: Matthew Warchus\n\nWriter: Stephen Beresford\n\nStarring: Ben Schnetzer, Bill Nighy, Imelda Staunton. Dominic West, Paddy Considine, Andrew Scott, George MacKay, Joseph Gilgun\n\nDuring the 1984 Miners Strike, an unexpected source of help for the workers — namely activists in Britain’s gay community. When their offer of help is rejected by many miners. Upon watching the news about the strike, gay activist Mark Ashton (Schnetzer) realizes that the police have stopped harassing the gay community because their attention is elsewhere. He spontaneously arranges a bucket collection for the miners during the Gay Pride Parade in London. Encouraged by the success, he founds “Lesbians and Gays Support the Miners.” Among its first members are 20-year-old closeted student Joe Cooper and an older gay couple Gethin and Jonathan, whose bookshop Gay’s the Word serves as their headquarters. Nighy plays Cliff Barry, the leader of the men’s union. In interviews to promote the film, the actor said that the emancipation of gay men and women in the UK in the post-Margaret Thatcher years was one of the greatest things to have happened in his lifetime.\n\n5. HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS – PART 1 (2010)\n\nDirector: David Yates\n\nWriter: Stephen Beresford\n\nStarring: Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, Emma Watson, Ralph Fiennes, Helena Bonham Carter, Bill Nighy\n\nThere was no way that Nighy wouldn’t be tapped for a role in the Harry Potter franchise since nearly every notable British character actor in Ol’ Blighty has been recruited for the for this franchise. His Rufus Scrimgeour, who is Welsh and a compassionate character, serves as the Minister for Magic of the United Kingdom until his death, succeeding Cornelius Fudge. He is described as looking like an old lion with tawny hair and bushy brows, yellow eyes and wire-rimmed spectacles. Before being selected as minister, he headed Auror Office of Ministry. He is scarred from his years of service as an Auror, which has given him an appearance of shrewd toughness.\n\nHarry, however, is grateful that Scrimgeour for protecting him. He is rumored to have been tortured for Harry’s whereabouts by Ministry officials, under the control of the Imperious Curse, before he is killed. Harry felt a “rush of gratitude” to hear that Scrimgeour, in his final act before he died, attempted to protect Harry by refusing to disclose his location.\n\n3. THE BEST EXOTIC MARIGOLD HOTEL (2011), THE SECOND BEST EXOTIC MARIGOLD HOTEL (2015)\n\nDirector: John Madden\n\nWriter: Ol Parker\n\nStarring: Dev Patel, Judi Dench, Tom Wilkinson, Maggie Smith, Penelope Wilton, Celia Imrie, Ronald Pickup, Bill Nighy, Richard Gere\n\nSeveral British pensioners decide to move to Jaipur, India to stay at the Best Exotic Marigold Hotel.
