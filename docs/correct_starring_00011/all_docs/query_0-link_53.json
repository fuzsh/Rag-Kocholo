        "text": "Oh my god LOL.. my 17 year old son even considers it one of his faves.\n\nMovie is absolutely WONDERFUL.. romance, comedy (can't beat Bill Nighy).. drama.. We own it in our DVD collection as it was one I couldn't do w/o.\n\nThat is a \"Christmas Movie\" in our house...we watch it every year. My first official date with my husband was going to see it. I thought it was sweet that he was trying to pretend that he wasn't crying at the end.\n\nThe scene where the best friend pretends to be a caroler and lets Keira Knightley know how he feels through the cue cards? OMG, off the chart romantic!!!\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by leangk\n\nbill nighy gets doesnt even get a quarter of the fame he deserves.\n\nno kidding.. the man is great...\n\nUnderworld, POC, Love Actually and small roles in Simon Pegg movies..\n\nugly man but fun to watch! Kind of like my all time fave Geoffrey Rush.. if that ugly ass man is in a film I'm watching it (though I could've done w/o his full frontal nudity in Quills LOL)\n\nhahah im not gay, but on alot of the imdb forums tonnes of girls love him. they say his voice is \"soothing\". haha you love simon pegg too? shaun of the dead and hotfuzz?? but yeah he always gets small bits. its BS.\n\nhe needs a movie where he is the star. maybe he alreayd has one? i just havent seen it>\n\ndid anyone else find that tatoo on the portogese cleaning ladys lower back a bit too much? or liam neesons friend who gave the worst advise to a man whos wife just died. heres some quotes\n\n\"ill call you back, doesnt mean im not terribly concerned your wife just died\" right after he said he has no one else to talk to.\n\nthen later says \"no one likes someone who sulks, plus youll never get shagged that way\"... im pretty sure after thsoe two comments i would cry myself to sleep"
