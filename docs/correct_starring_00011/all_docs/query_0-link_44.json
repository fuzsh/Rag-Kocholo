        "text": "Become a rockstar and they give you them for free!\n\nBill Nighy thinks his Love Actually line will be written on his tombstone.\n\nBill Nighy is starring in Their Finest, a romantic comedy drama about a married woman and a screenwriter, who fall in love while working on a war film together at the time of the Blitz. And Bill Nighy plays the 'ageing actor'!\n\nBut is Bill getting tired of being cast as 'a shipwreck of a man' and 'raddled'? As it turns out, he doesn't really mind, as long as the part is a good one. However, he did overhear a couple of fans on the street calling him 'raddled' recently â€“ so we'd better watch out what we say about him, in case Bill is just round the corner!\n\nAfter the huge success of Red Nose Day Actually, Bill admitted how lovely it was to see all the old Love Actually cast again. He also revealed that that the line fans most want him to say is his character Billy Mack's: 'Hey kids, don't buy drugs. Become a rockstar and they give you them for free!'\n\nBill also discussed the woes of being recognised at hen parties, running away whenever he is asked to take his clothes off, and potentially becoming the face of Marmite: \"Look at this face: Doesn't it just speak Marmite?\"\n\nYes Bill, yes it does.\n\nWatch the interview here > >"
