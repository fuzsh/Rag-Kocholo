        "text": "Virgin Radio\n\n20 Mar 2024, 12:38\n\nCredit: Getty\n\nBill Nighy will be reuniting with Love Actually’s Richard Curtis to star in his latest festive film.\n\nThat Christmas, adapted from Curtis’ children’s book of the same name, is an animated film written by Curtis and voice acted by an all star cast including Nighy.\n\nSuccession star Brian Cox will play the role of Santa Claus, meanwhile Nighy, Fiona Shaw and Jodie Whittaker will all play the roles of residents in the charming seaside town where the film is set.\n\nSpeaking about the project in a statement released today (20th March), Curtis shared: “[That Christmas] has been the most amazing adventure, my first animated film.\n\n“It’s been especially exciting to see the whole world I imagined come to life beyond my wildest dreams - and populated by a dream bunch of actors, their wonderful voices turned into such rich and funny characters.”\n\nHow to Train Your Dragon character animator Simon Otto will be making his directorial debut with the film, which will also star Lolly Adefope, Alex Macqueen, Katherine Parkinson, Sindhu Vee, India Brown, Zazie Hayhurst, Sienna Sayer, Jack Wisniewski, Rosie Cavaliero, Paul Kaye, Guz Khan, Andy Nyman, Kuhu Agarwal, Bronte Smith, Freddie Spry, Ava Talbot and Rhys Darby.\n\nThat Christmas' director Simon Otto gushed: “Becoming an animator had been on my Christmas wish list ever since I was a child and watching animated movies was one of the biggest Christmas traditions in my family. But never could I have imagined that one day I would get the chance to direct a Christmas film written by the one-and-only Richard Curtis and collaborate with some of the most iconic voice talents.\n\n“Watching this cast bring life to these heartwarmingly funny tales and infuse them with the magic of animation is truly a dream come true,” he added. “I hope That Christmas becomes a cherished tradition for audiences worldwide.”"
