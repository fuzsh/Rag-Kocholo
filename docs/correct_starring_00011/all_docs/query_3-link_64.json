        "text": "With the Holiday season in full swing, thousands are switching on their favorite Christmas movie in preparation for the festivities.\n\nThis includes the star-studded 2003 hit comedy romance about love and loss, Love Actually.\n\nThe film boasts some of Hollywood’s biggest names including Hugh Grant, Emma Thompson, Liam Neeson, Keira Knightley, and Alan Rickman.\n\nAlthough the blockbuster contains a widely British cast, it was revealed that director Richard Curtis had reached out the several American actors.\n\nAccording to Mental Floss, the showrunner contacted Laura Linney, Billy Bob Thornton, and The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star Denise Richards.\n\nWhile the latter did make smaller appearances in the film, it's likely they would have secured more screen time or replaced one of the main stars.\n\nRead more: Horror Christmas movie ‘terrifies’ viewers with new trailer\n\nThe 52-year-old featured near the end as Carla who fans will remember as the “real friendly one” whom Jamie Bennett (played by Colin Firth) brought back from America for his friend.\n\nDenise is an accomplished actress who went on to star in a number of hit films and TV shows such as The Bold and The Beautiful, Two and a Half Men, and Vanity.\n\nIn 2022, she reflected on her time on Love Actually and admitted: “I loved being a part of that movie, even though if you blink, you'll miss me.”\n\nShe told PEOPLE: “I'm still so proud of it in being able to be part of it and I'll never forget meeting the cast.\n\n“I was so starstruck. My mother — my late mom — traveled with me to London to shoot it. She was just so excited to be on set too.”\n\nAlthough Denise has continued to land acting roles, she is widely known for starring in Bravo’s famed reality show, The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills.\n\nWhile she joined the show as a housewife in 2019 and left after two seasons, she recently made a surprising return following a bust-up with a former co-star.\n\nAlthough some were pleased to see her comeback, Denise sparked concern among other fans for her “erratic” behavior during Kyle Richard’s dinner party."
