Amy Pond finds herself shoulder to shoulder with Vincent Van Gogh, in a battle with a deadly alien.\n\nWell Schooled in Murder\n\nWhen an old school friend contacts Lynley about a missing schoolboy, the inspector soon finds himself launching a murder inquiry.\n\nThe Four Jacks\n\nA wealthy novelist points Wycliffe in the direction of a serial killer with a taste for theatrics.\n\nAncient History\n\nA new law suspending the statute of limitations on wartime atrocities has Kavanagh prosecuting a Polish doctor accused of heinous war crimes. Bill Nighy guest stars."
