In 2022, he turned 73 years old.\n\nHe was brought up as a Roman Catholic and served as an altar boy, before leaving school to pursue acting with two O-Levels.\n\nNighy made his stage debut in 1977 at the London Theatre after years of training at the Guildford School of Acting. From then onwards he appeared in various shows on television, film, radio, and the stage, receiving a reputation for being a reliable character actor.\n\nIt wasn't until the turn of the century however when his mainstream career kicked off after a breakthrough appearance in Love Actually opened the doors to Hollywood.\n\nWhat are Bill Nighy's biggest films?\n\n- Love Actually\n\n- Pirates of the Caribbean film series,\n\n- Living\n\n- The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel\n\n- Emma\n\n- Shaun of the Dead\n\n- The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\n\n- The Constant Gardener\n\n- Notes on a Scandal\n\n- Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 1\n\nIs Bill Nighy married and does he have children?\n\nBill Nighy is not currently married. His only marriage was to English actress Diana Quick from 1980 to 2008, who worked together in David Hare's A Map of the World at the National Theatre in 1982. Even though they're divorced they remain friends.\n\nThey have one daughter together, Mary Nighy, who is an actress herself. She is Bill Nighy's only child.\n\nIn 2023, Bill confirmed his relationship with Vogue editor Anna Wintour at the Met Gala.\n\nWhat is Bill Nighy's net worth?\n\nBill Nighy's net worth is an estimated $8 million.\n\nAre there any other facts we should know about Bill Nighy?\n\nBill Nighy hates watching himself on the big screen, and has never watched a film that he has featured in.\n\nHe was once offered the title role in Doctor Who after once appearing as a guest on an episode, but swiftly turned down the opportunity. \"No disrespect to Doctor Who or anything, I just think that it comes with too much baggage,\" he said.\n\nKnown for his sartorial elegance and flawless style, Nighy said he wears a suit almost every day.\n\nHe's not your typical Hollywood type, and rather likes being stopped in the streets of central London by his fans."
