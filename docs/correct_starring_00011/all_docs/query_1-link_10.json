        "text": "“Love Actually” became a smash hit in the US upon its release in mid-November 2003, grossing almost $250 million worldwide and making it one of the year’s most successful films.\n\nThe film, which follows the interconnected love stories of eight different people, is revisited year after year as one of the world’s favorite holiday movies, ensuring its success continues. “Four Weddings and a Funeral” scribe Richard Curtis helmed the movie and wrote the script while the cast brought the characters to life. Hugh Grant, Colin Firth, and Alan Rickman are memorable, but only two members of the eclectic troupe garnered awards attention: Bill Nighy and Emma Thompson. Let’s focus on Nighy for now.\n\nIn the film, Nighy plays aging rock star Billy Mack, who is desperately searching for a comeback by releasing a Christmas version of the Troggs’ 1967 song “Love Is All Around.” Titled “Christmas Is All Around,” Billy hopes the tune can become the new Christmas number one in the UK and propel his career to further success. But the heart of Billy’s story is his touching, funny, exasperating relationship with his manager Joe (Gregor Fisher). The two aging men, past their prime, eventually find solace and comfort with one another, solidifying their friendship in the film’s platonic love story.\n\nNighy delivers one of his best performances with this role, generating great laughs via the physicality of his performance. Nighy’s stance and mannerisms while singing his song (and his literally flinching upon hearing the song later on) really bring Billy Mack to life. The actor has some wonderful line readings, a lot of which involve crass language, and he makes for the most colorful character in the entire film. As Billy Mack, Nighy is so, so much fun to watch. Awards groups clearly thought so, too, as he landed several key nominations. But… how close was he to an Oscar nomination during the 2004 awards season?\n\nNighy was nominated at the BAFTAs that year for Best Supporting Actor alongside Paul Bettany (“Master and Commander”), Albert Finney (“Big Fish”), Ian McKellen (“The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King”), and Tim Robbins (“Mystic River”). McKellen and Robbins went on to secure Oscar nominations with Robbins winning. But it was Nighy who triumphed on home soil at the BAFTAs, taking home Best Supporting Actor. This isn’t unusual. The BAFTAs love rewarding their own and this has happened in this category a lot across multiple decades. Alan Rickman won for “Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves” in 1992, Ralph Fiennes won for “Schindler’s List” in 1994, Jude Law won for “The Talented Mr. Ripley” in 2000, Clive Owen won for “Closer” in 2005, and Dev Patel won for “Lion” in 2017.\n\nHowever, Nighy’s BAFTA win shouldn’t be understated. Since the year 2000, Nighy is the only winner of this category who didn’t go on to land an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor. In fact, the last time the BAFTA winner for Best Supporting Actor didn’t go on to secure an Oscar bid was in 1998 when Tom Wilkinson won for another British classic, “The Full Monty.” This is a remarkable streak where BAFTA winners in this category are usually a sure thing for an Oscar nomination. But Nighy is the only BAFTA winner in this category out of the last 23 to not go on to be nominated for an Oscar.\n\nNighy also secured a number of key critics group nominations, including bids from the Satellite Awards, the London Critics Circle Film Awards (which he won), and the Los Angeles Film Critics Association Awards (which he won). But he failed to get in at the Golden Globes, Screen Actors’ Guild Awards, or Critics Choice Awards. There were six nominees at the Globes and Nighy still couldn’t get in, with Robbins and Finney nominated alongside Alec Baldwin (“The Cooler”), William H. Macy (“Seabiscuit”), Peter Sarsgaard (“Shattered Glass”), and Ken Watanabe (“The Last Samurai”). Robbins won. Robbins also reigned victorious at the SAG awards, where he was nominated alongside Baldwin, Watanabe, Chris Cooper (“Seabiscuit”), and Benicio del Toro (“21 Grams”). Meanwhile, the Critics Choice Awards nominated Robbins, Baldwin, Bettany, del Toro, and Watanabe.\n\nSo, Robbins was the one lock having been nominated at every major precursor (and won three of them) while Baldwin, Watanabe, and Bettany all secured bids at three of the major precursors. Del Toro was nominated at two of them. Nighy was only nominated at one, but he did win, so he was well in with a shout going into the Oscar nominations, too. The academy eventually nominated the expected trio of Robbins, Baldwin, and Watanabe while del Toro also got in. However, Brits Bettany and Nighy were left out of the lineup. Instead, Djimon Hounsou reaped a surprise nomination for his performance in Jim Sheridan‘s “In America,” the only time Hounsou was nominated at a major awards group for that film.\n\nSo, while Nighy won the BAFTA, he was too frequently left out of the major precursors to be considered a genuine threat to win the Oscar, which went to Robbins. He could feel aggrieved for not even being nominated but there were other actors, like Bettany (who has never been nominated somehow!) who also got snubbed. Nighy’s victory on home soil was the big win for him. Despite that win, an Oscar nomination never really seemed on the cards.\n\nNighy did eventually land that elusive Oscar nomination, however, when he earned a Best Actor bid for “Living” earlier this year. He was also nominated at the BAFTAs, Golden Globes, and Critics Choice Awards. But Nighy didn’t win. It was Brendan Fraser who won the Oscar, actually.\n\nMake your predictions at Gold Derby now.
