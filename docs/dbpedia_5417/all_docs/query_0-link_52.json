If your order contains a mix of instock and pre-order items, please note that the entire order will be shipped once the final piece has arrived in store.

Select on the cart page if you would like our beautiful gift wrapping, free of charge. We can even add a personal message – just let us know what you’d like it to say.\n\nNew Zealand Orders & Delivery Timeframes\n\nWhen we receive notification of your order we generally pick and pack that order as quickly as possible within standard business hours. Processing may take 2 working days at the most. Please do get in touch with us if you need your order processed urgently. Once your order is carefully packed then we call the courier and wait eagerly for them to come and collect your goodies. You will receive an email from us when your order is on the way so that you know when to expect it.\n\nNorth Island and local orders should be delivered by Courier Post or Castle Parcels 1-2 days after they are collected from Small Acorns. South Island and Rural Areas can expect orders to be delivered 5-7 working days after the order is collected from Small Acorns. This is a guide only and both rural and South Island addresses may take an extra few working days. At most, your parcel should arrive within 7 working days of receipt of order. We cannot be held responsible for delays in delivery time that are beyond our control, and will always do our best to keep you informed should we experience a delay beyond that of our usual expected delivery timeframe.\n\nDeliveries take place Monday to Friday. Please note, for items such as wallpaper & rugs which are indented from the UK, the usual delivery time is 2 to 3 weeks. Orders for these items are neither returnable or cancellable.\n\nInternational Orders & Delivery Costs\n\nSmall Acorns is based in New Zealand, however, we happily ship our beautiful products around the world.\n\nAll orders will be charged in New Zealand dollars (NZD) and include 15% GST (Goods and Services Tax).\n\nWe offer two delivery options for international orders.\n\nNZ Post International Post Service allows us to give you the best shipping price.

You are solely liable for these charges.\n\nPlease note that these prices cover most purchases. For extra large or heavy items or furniture purchases we reserve the right to charge extra as applicable and we will contact you about this. The description will outline if the product does not qualify for regular shipping costs and we will contact you with a freight quote after you place your order.\n\nCan I Return or Exchange An Item?\n\nWe understand that shopping online can sometimes be tricky and we want you to love the things you buy from Small Acorns.\n\nIf for any reason you are not happy please contact us as soon as possible.\n\nWe are not obliged to accept any goods for return where you have simply changed your mind, and all goods for return must be authorised by us, whether purchased online, instore or via phone or email.\n\nFor a return to be processed, Small Acorns needs to be notified within 14 days of your order. After this time, we regret we cannot accept the goods for return.\n\nIf for any reason you are not satisfied with any product you have purchased online, please return it to us in original, unopened condition (this is particularly important with bedlinen) with all original tags and packaging, & your receipt, and we will credit it or refund the purchase price using the method you used for the initial purchase. A refund or credit note will be at our discretion. Freight and delivery charges will not be refunded or credited.\n\nFor goods purchased instore, please choose carefully, as we are not obliged to accept any goods for return when you have simply changed your mind. However, we are happy to exchange or credit the items, providing they are returned within 14 days of purchase in original, unopened condition (this is particularly important with bedlinen) with the original packaging and tags attached, and your original receipt is presented. We regret that without a receipt, we cannot exchange or credit. We will not offer a refund. When purchasing a gift, please ask for an exchange card.\n\nWe cannot offer refunds, credits or returns on fabric, wallpaper, indented items, sale items, lay-bys or gift vouchers. We cannot give change on gift vouchers or credit notes. All sale items purchased online are firm sale, and cannot be returned.\n\nWe cannot accept unused goods in damaged packaging unless they are faulty. For hygiene reasons cosmetics, creams and toiletries cannot be returned unless they are faulty.\n\nIf your item is faulty, the fault will be assessed by the Small Acorns team and either repaired, replaced or refunded. Should the replacement item be out of stock we will either offer a store credit, an exchange for another item, or a refund.\n\nUnfortunately we are unable to refund, exchange or credit any items damaged in the wash.\n\nFabric, wallpaper & rug orders are indented and are neither returnable or cancellable. We cannot be held responsible for delays in delivery time that are beyond our control, and will always do our best to keep you informed should we experience a delay beyond that of our usual expected delivery timeframe.\n\nWe're sorry, but due to the nature, size & scheduling of our workshops, we are unable to offer a refund, credit or a date transfer if you are unable to attend. You are welcome to find someone to replace you. Refunds are not available.\n\nYour statutory rights are not affected.\n\nPre-Orders\n\nAll pre-order items are clearly labelled and include their approximate delivery date. If your order contains a mix of instock and pre-order items, please note that the entire order will be shipped once the final piece has arrived in store. If you would like your instock items sent prior to the pre-order items, please either process your orders separately or an additional freight cost will be charged for partially shipped orders.\n\nGift Wrapping\n\nWe take great pride in our signature Small Acorns gift wrapping. Select on the cart page if you would like our beautiful gift wrapping, free of charge. We can even add a personal message – just let us know what you’d like it to say.\n\nSmall Acorns Insider Club Points\n\nLoyalty points are not rewarded on already discounted items, sale items or during promotions. Fabric, interior make costs and labour, wallpaper and furniture purchases are also not eligible for loyalty points. Adventures With Marigolds tours are also not eligible for loyalty points. Laybys and On Account purchases will qualify for loyalty points once the transaction is fully paid, and if those items were eligible for loyalty points.\n\nThe purchase of gift vouchers does not earn Loyalty Points. Only the redemption of the gift voucher will count towards Loyalty Points on the recipient’s profile against products purchased.\n\nDo your loyalty points expire? No and yes. Your points don't expire provided you keep your account active within a 12 month period. For example, if you shop with us in June 2024 but don't earn or redeem with us again until July 2025, your points will expire as your account was inactive for a 12 month period. However if you shop with us a few times in a year then you get to keep all your points and your older points won't expire. We will send you a reminder email if your points are in danger of expiring.\n\nWe reserve the right to change these Terms at any time by notifying users of the existence of revised terms and conditions through the website.\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nSmall Acorns values its customers and respects their privacy.
