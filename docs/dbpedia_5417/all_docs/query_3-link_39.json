        "meta_description": "Foreword The only time is now. Every “now” is unique. Responsible persons ask themselves, “How can I act well now?” The answers will differ for every person, because just as every situation is unique, so is every person different from every other person. But surely there must be some algorithm that will assist us in coming to the right answer. Unfortunately, no, for there is no right answer. There is only an answer that is as appropriate as we can conclude at that moment in that situation. No written guidelines can apply appropriately to every unique situation.\n\nUnfortunately we physicians have been suckled on a fallacy: “What’s good for the goose is good for the gander.” Phrased in medical terms, “normal findings are good, and abnormal findings are bad.” This is too simple, and often wrong.\n\nGood clinicians know that care must be personalized for it to be optimal. So-called normal findings give rough guidance, sometimes applicable to groups, but frequently wrong for individuals. Consider intraocular pressure (IOP). A normal IOP of 15 mmHg good for some and bad for others, and an abnormal IOP of 30 mmHg is good for some and bad for others. We are so bombarded by the myth of the sanctity of the standard distribution curve that it is hard to think independently and specifically. Also, unfortunately, doctors are prone to decide for patients, often on the basis of normative data that is not relevant or important for the particular patient. That we do this is not surprising, as we want to help, and so we default to what seems to be the easy, safe (non-thinking) way, in which we do not have to hold ourselves accountable for the outcome.\n\nSomebody HAS to decide, or else we would be living in an anarchical world. Also true. And because none of us knows as much as we need to know to act appropriately, we seek advice from so-called “experts.”\n\nFor us to care for people well it is essential that we consider what others recommend. So we look to experts, as we should. However, experts are sometimes right and sometimes wrong. Remember that von Graefe in 1860 recommended surgical iridectomy for all glaucoma, Elliot recommended mustard plaster between the shoulders for glaucoma, Becker based treatment on tonographic findings, Weve reported 100% success with penetrating cyclodiathermy in glaucoma, Lichter advised against laser trabeculoplasty, many thought Cypass was great, and the investigators in the Advanced Glaucoma Intervention Study indicated that an IOP usually around 12 mmHg was better than one usually around 20 mmHg. All wrong. What the authors of these guidelines have done excellently, is to provide a general framework on which ophthalmologists can hang pieces of evidence, so as to be able to evaluate the validity and the importance of that evidence. In doing this meticulously they have provided a valuable service to all ophthalmologists, none of whom individually have either the time or the skill to be fully informed. In their own practices the authors consider whether valid information is relevant for the particular person being considered. That process of considering relevance is essential, always. And relevance is based on the particular unique patient, unique doctor and unique situation. The only guideline the authors can provide in this regard is to remind us all to consider relevance with all patients in all situations, and from the patient’s perspective. Even more important than the service to ophthalmologists is the benefit to patients that will result from thoughtful use of these guidelines.\n\nWe need, also, to remember that diagnoses are generic, and that within every diagnosis there are differences. For example what does a diagnosis of primary open angle mean? Some of those affected will rapidly go blind despite the most thoughtful treatment and others will keep their sight even without treatment. What does a diagnosis of Chandler’s Syndrome mean? In some, surgery works well, and, in others, poorly. So one never directs diagnosis and treatment at a condition, but rather at the person, the objective being the wellness of that person.\n\nThe previous European Glaucoma Society Guidelines are used internationally. It is good that the EGS is again providing updated, useful information.The Guidelines are a practical, inspirational contribution.\n\nGeorge L.

        "text": "Part I\n\nI.1 Background to Guideline Development\n\nThe aim of these Guidelines is to support ophthalmologists in managing people with, or at risk of, glaucoma, and to provide useful information to trainees. For this 5th edition, we initiated the process to update the Guidelines by identifying key questions on diagnosis, monitoring and treatment that were then prioritised by a group of experts. To answer these key questions, we identified and assessed currently available evidence. Evidence was gathered in 2019 in collaboration with the USA-Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group by conducting an overview of systematic reviews on glaucoma interventions and diagnostic technologies (see I.3). Differing from previous editions, a grading system for rating the quality of evidence and strength of recommendation, following grading of recommendations, assessment, development and evaluations (GRADE), has been used only for answering our key questions. The rest of recommendations and suggestions throughout the text are consensus based among experts.\n\nIn this 5th edition we chose to provide only references of high-quality systematic reviews, landmark glaucoma trials and population-based studies. This is because we recognise that the process of selecting references to include in guidelines can be biased, and most publications do not provide direct information for clinical decision making and there is a risk of misinterpretation of information by non-experienced readers.\n\nPatients’ care and wellbeing are at the core of our values and we collaborated with the Glaucoma UK charity which has helped us to confirm the most important questions that ophthalmologists should ask patients with glaucoma, and to identify what are their most common concerns.\n\nThe Guidelines should be considered as a guidance rather than strict decision-making protocols.\n\nDecision making ultimately should be individualised to patients’ needs and circumstances, ideally guided by best available evidence.\n\nThe European Glaucoma Society (EGS) and all contributors disclaim responsibility and all liability for any adverse medical or legal effects resulting directly or indirectly from the use of any of the definitions, diagnostic techniques or treatments described in the Guidelines. The EGS does not endorse any product, procedure, company or organisation.\n\nI.2 Mission statement\n\nThe goal of care for people with, or at risk of, glaucoma is to promote their well-being and quality of life (QoL) within a sustainable health care system. Well-being and QoL are influenced by a person’s visual function, the psychological impact of having a chronic progressive sight-threatening condition and the costs and side-effects of treatments. Costs include inconveniences to the individual and their care givers as well as the financial cost of examinations, diagnostic procedures and therapies, both to the individual and society. The effect of visual function on well-being and QoL is variable; in general, early to moderate glaucoma has only a modest influence, whereas advanced visual function loss in both eyes may considerably reduce QoL.\n\nI.3 Key Questions and Evidence-Based Recommendations\n\nMethods:\n\nTopics and questions were prioritised by a group of experts during two dedicated meetings (October 2018 Camogli, Italy and February 2019 Mainz, Germany). Evidence pertinent to these questions was gathered in collaboration with the USA- Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group by conducting an overview of systematic reviews on glaucoma interventions and diagnostic technologies (see https://www.eugs.org/eng/guidelines.asp).\n\nRecommendations are proposed using GRADE methodology, according to the level of evidence: high, moderate, low, very low; as well as strength of recommendation: strong or weak. A strong recommendation should be interpreted as “we recommend” and/or “very relevant in clinical practice”, and a weak recommendation as “we suggest” and/or “less relevant in clinical practice”.\n\nEvidence and strength of recommendations were discussed among experts and scientists in a 3-day meeting in Genoa, Italy in November 2019.\n\nQ1. What are the recommended tests at first assessment?\n\nThe following tests are recommended at first assessment:\n\nVisual acuity and refractive error (strength of recommendation: strong)\n\nSlit lamp examination (strength of recommendation: strong)\n\nGonioscopy (strength of recommendation: strong)\n\nTonometry (strength of recommendation: strong)\n\nCentral corneal thickness (CCT) (strength of recommendation: weak) - Use of CCT-adjusted intraocular pressure (IOP) values is not recommended.\n\nVisual field (VF) testing (strength of recommendation: strong)\n\nClinical assessment of the optic nerve head (ONH), retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) and macula. Binocular examination under pupil dilatation is preferable (except in angle closure). Optic disc and RNFL photography can be used (strength of recommendation: strong)\n\nOptical coherence tomography (OCT) of disc/RNFL/macula can be useful but the diagnosis of glaucoma cannot be made on the basis of OCT alone. (strength of recommendation: weak)\n\nLevel of evidence: The direct evidence addressing this specific question is ‘very low’ for all recommendations.\n\nQ2. Alternative tonometers other than Goldmann applanation tonometry (GAT): are they recommended in clinical practice?\n\nRecommendation: Consensus could not be reached about which alternative tonometers other than GAT can be used in clinical practice.\n\nLevel of evidence: very low\n\nStrength of recommendation: weak\n\nComment: Many forms of tonometry have been licensed for clinical use through comparison with GAT which is considered the current reference standard.\n\nIn general, all measurements with tonometers which applanate the cornea are influenced by corneal biomechanics (both geometry, e.g. thickness and curvature, and material properties, e.g. stiffness and viscoelasticity). The effect is greater with tonometers which applanate the cornea more quickly (such as air-puff and rebound tonometers).\n\nIn recent times, new tonometers have been introduced which intend to make IOP measurements less influenced by corneal parameters. The impact of tonometer inaccuracy and/or imprecision on clinical outcomes has not been established.\n\nThere is sizeable inter- and intra-observer variability observed for all tonometers, including GAT.\n\nThe accuracy and precision of a tonometer should influence the choice for use in clinic. For a given patient, the same tonometer should be used for follow-up.\n\nQ3. Is it recommended to set a target IOP?\n\nRecommendation: A target IOP should be set as a treatment goal at diagnosis. Target IOP should be updated at each monitoring visit on the basis of changes in glaucoma or other ocular or systemic diseases.\n\nLevel of evidence: low\n\nStrength of recommendation: strong\n\nComment: Therapy in glaucoma management aims to lower IOP to slow the rate of VF deterioration sufficient to maintain the patient’s QoL.\n\nTarget IOP is the upper limit of IOP judged to be compatible with this treatment goal. We recommend the use of target IOP. It should be re-evaluated regularly and modified accordingly when progression of the disease is identified or when ocular or systemic comorbidities develop. If the target IOP has not been reached, but the glaucoma is stable, then the target may be revised upwards. There is no single target IOP level that is appropriate for every patient, so the target IOP needs to be estimated separately for each eye of every patient, and adapted to changing patient status.\n\nQ4. Central corneal thickness (CCT): is it recommended to use CCT to risk profile patients? (see also Q1 and Q2)\n\nRecommendation: CCT may be useful for baseline risk profiling.\n\nLevel of evidence: low\n\nStrength of recommendation: weak\n\nComment: CCT is one parameter which influences the accuracy of most tonometers. In eyes with thin corneas IOP tends to be underestimated. Thinner CCT is associated with a higher risk of conversion of ocular hypertension (OHT) to glaucoma and a higher risk of glaucoma progression in multiple variable models. However there is no strong evidence that CCT is an independent risk factor. IOP correction algorithms based on CCT are not validated and should be avoided.\n\nQ5. Anterior chamber angle evaluation with imaging tests: are they recommended to diagnose people with angle closure?\n\nRecommendation: Anterior chamber angle imaging cannot replace gonioscopy. Gonioscopy should be performed in every patient being evaluated for glaucoma.\n\nLevel of evidence: low\n\nStrength of recommendation: strong\n\nComment: Anterior chamber angle imaging devices can be useful to identify the iris configuration of a narrow angle, to assess the influence of the lens, for triage or in eyes where the angle cannot be visualised by gonioscopy. However anterior chamber angle imaging should not replace gonioscopy since features as peripheral anterior synechia, pigment and other secondary causes of trabecular dysfunction may be missed.\n\nQ6. Optical coherence tomography (OCT): what is the role of OCT for diagnosis of glaucoma? Answered in Q1 (see also flow chart (FC) III).\n\nQ7. What are the recommended tests for monitoring?\n\nVisual acuity (strength of recommendation: strong)\n\nVF testing (strength of recommendation: strong) - Same instrument and strategy are recommended for follow-up tests\n\nUse software-based progression analyses\n\nVF remains the most important test to monitor progression\n\nClinical examination of the optic disc and RNFL (strength of recommendation: strong).\n\nTonometry (strength of recommendation: strong)\n\nOCT disc/RNFL/macula imaging (strength of recommendation: weak))\n\nOCT disc/RNFL/macula scan using the same instrument with the software- based analysis can be useful\n\nOCT progression analysis cannot replace VF progression analysis\n\nAt present OCT progression analysis is not age-corrected (there is an aging- related decline)\n\nApparent OCT progression and VF progression are not always correlated\n\nRepeated gonioscopy in some circumstances (strength of recommendation: weak)\n\nLevel of evidence: The direct evidence addressing this specidic question is ‘very low’ for all recommendations.\n\nQ8. What is the role of OCT for monitoring glaucoma? Answered in Q7\n\nQ9. Alternative models of care: virtual clinics / asynchronous decision making: are they acceptable?\n\nRecommendation: virtualclinics / asynchronous decision making can be an efficient way of delivering glaucoma care.\n\nLevel of evidence: very low\n\nStrength of recommendation: weak\n\nComment: Models of care with virtual clinics / asynchronous decision making are potentially valuable when improvements in access to care is needed. Proper governance and safety measures must be in place. Patients acceptability and preferences should be confirmed.\n\nQ10. Medical treatment: what is the most effective and what is the first- choice medication for open angle glaucoma?\n\nRecommendation: Prostaglandinanalogues (PGAs) are the most effective medication and they are usually recommended as first choice treatment for open angle glaucoma.\n\nLevel of evidence: High for IOP reduction but very low for other outcomes.\n\nStrength of recommendation: strong\n\nComment: Factors like possible adverse effects, co-morbidities, systemic therapy, adherence, patient preferences, life expectancy, cost and availability should be considered in selecting a drug for a given patient.\n\nQ11. What interventions can improve adherence to medical treatment?\n\nRecommendation: simplified regime, education, effective communication (e.g., ask open questions), alarms/messages.\n\nLevel of evidence: very low\n\nStrength of recommendation: weak\n\nQ12. Is selective laser trabeculoplasty (SLT) recommended as initial treatment?\n\nRecommendation: SLT can be offered as a first choice treatment for open angle glaucoma.\n\nLevel of evidence: moderate (only one high quality trial, LiGHT see I.7.3.3)\n\nStrength of recommendation: strong\n\nComment: One high quality trial showed that SLT is at least as effective as eye drops and SLT should be considered as an option for initial treatment in patients with mild or moderate open angle glaucoma or OHT (LiGHT trial, see I.7.3.3). There is no evidence regarding effectiveness of SLT in patients with severe glaucoma and pigmentary glaucoma (PG). SLT and argon laser trabeculoplasty (ALT) probably have similar efficacy. Factors like co-morbidities, systemic therapy, adherence, ability to administer drops, patient preference, cost and availability should be considered when offering laser trabeculoplasty as a first choice treatment.\n\nQ13. What is the recommended surgical treatment for open angle glaucoma?\n\nRecommendation: Trabeculectomy augmented with antifibrotic agents is recommended as an initial surgical treatment for open angle glaucoma.\n\nLevel of evidence: low\n\nStrength of recommendation: strong\n\nComment: Trabeculectomy with antifibrotic agents is the standard glaucoma surgical procedure. Depending on patient circumstances such as target pressure, safety profile and patient preferences, other options can be considered, e.g., drainage devices (glaucoma shunts) in people with high risk of trabeculectomy failure, or less invasive filtering surgery, or bleb-less surgery such as canaloplasty, or minimally invasive glaucoma surgery in people with early disease may be considered. Factors like cost, availability and surgeon’s preference should also be considered when selecting a type of surgery.\n\nCombined glaucoma surgery with phacoemulsification may be considered in some patients with coexisting glaucoma and cataract.\n\nQ14. What is the recommended intervention for primary angle closure disease?\n\nWith the exclusion of eyes with cataract, following an acute attack of angle closure (AAC) or nanophthalmos.\n\nInterventions depend on the spectrum of disease and presence of cataract.\n\nLaser and surgical treatment is typically combined with medical treatment.\n\nPrimary angle closure suspect (PACS):\n\nComment: Not all patients with PACS need laser peripheral iridotomy (LPI). Evidence from China suggests that there is a low risk of disease progression without LPI (ZAP trial, see I.7.2.1). No studies in white European eyes.\n\nRecommendation: LPI in high risk individuals, e.g., high hyperopia, patients requiring repeated pupil dilatation for retinal disease or with difficult access to healthcare facilities.\n\nLevel of evidence: low\n\nStrength of recommendation: “weak”\n\nPrimary angle closure (PAC) and primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG), for people under 50 years of age:\n\nRecommendation: LPI\n\nLevel of evidence: low\n\nStrength of recommendation: “strong”\n\nPAC and PACG, for people over 50 years of age:\n\nComment: Lens extraction is associated with better clinical and QoL outcomes\n\n(EAGLE trial, see I.7.4.1), but risk considerations need to be individualised.\n\nRecommendation: lens extraction or LPI\n\nLevel of evidence: moderate (one good quality trial, EAGLE)\n\nStrength of recommendation: strong\n\nQ15. Medical treatment: what is the most effective and the first choice medication for PACG (after interventions for widening the anterior chamber angle have been done)?\n\nRecommendation: Prostaglandin analogues are the most effective medication.\n\nLevel of evidence: low\n\nStrength of recommendation: strong\n\nComment: Trials in East Asia may not be generalisable to European populations. Factors like possible adverse effects, co-morbidities, systemic therapy, adherence, patient preferences, life expectancy, cost and availability should be considered in selecting a drug for a given patient.\n\nIn some exceptional cases long-term treatment with miotics may be recommended (e.g, plateau iris syndrome after LPI and with recurrent attacks of angle closure and when lens extraction cannot be done).\n\nQ16. Glaucoma surgery for PACG (after interventions for widening the anterior chamber angle have been done)?\n\nInterventions depend on the lens status and glaucoma severity.\n\nPseudophakic with PACG:\n\nRecommendation: filtration surgery (trabeculectomy)\n\nLevel of evidence: very low\n\nStrength of recommendation: strong\n\nPhakic with PACG:\n\nRecommendation: phacoemulsification a lone or combined phacoemulsification + glaucoma surgery\n\nLevel of evidence: very low\n\nStrength of recommendation: strong\n\nComment: In patients with severe glaucoma phaco-trabeculectomy may be advisable.\n\nI.4 Things to Avoid - Choosing Wisely\n\n1) CCT-adjusted IOP algorithms.\n\nIOP correction algorithms based on CCT are not validated and should be avoided.\n\n2) Short-wavelength automated perimetry (SWAP) for glaucoma.\n\nThere is no evidence of better performance of swap and it has no role in current clinical practice.\n\n3) Glaucoma diagnosis and progression based only on OCT.\n\nOCT on its own does not provide a clinical diagnosis of glaucoma, just a statistical deviation from a reference database.\n\nOne should not rely on OCT only to diagnose progression.\n\n4) Cup to disc ratio (CDR) for diagnosis of glaucoma or to detect progression.\n\nDue to the large differences in size and shape of optic discs CDR cannot be used to diagnose glaucoma. In addition, the assessment of CDR, even by experts, has high variability and is not useful to detect progression.\n\n5) Anterior chamber angle imaging to replace gonioscopy.\n\nThe accuracy of anterior segment imaging to diagnose angle closure is suboptimal.\n\n6) Routine genetic testing and direct to consumer genetic genotyping. Do not offer genotyping routinely to glaucoma patients.\n\nGenetic information obtained with online home testing kits may be unreliable and should not be used to guide diagnosis or treatment.\n\n7) Glaucoma management decisions based only on artificial intelligence. Technologies may support but do not replace clinical judgement.\n\n8) Provocation test for angle closure.\n\nA negative provocative test does not exclude risk of acute angle closure. A positive test may not represent real life circumstances.\n\n9) Interventions for blind painless eyes with very high IOP.\n\nOnce the vision is lost, there is no need to perform further interventions except for painful eyes when pain is due to high IOP.\n\n10) Laser trabeculoplasty for primary late-onset juvenile glaucoma.\n\nThere is no evidence that laser trabeculoplasty is effective in juvenile glaucoma.\n\n11) Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors and hyperosmotic agents in patients with sickle-cell disease.\n\nIn patients with sickle-cell disease these drugs may cause an acute haemolytic crisis and should be avoided.\n\n12) Lowering IOP to just below 21 mmHg in advanced glaucoma.\n\nIn patients with advanced glaucoma low IOP e.g., low teens is needed.\n\nFC I – Suggested questions for your glaucoma patient\n\nAt baseline\n\nHistory/risk factors\n\nSpecifically enquire about\n\nAll medications\n\nFamily history (general/ophthalmological/blindness)\n\nCorticosteroid therapy (topical/systemic)\n\nOcular trauma or inflammation Refractive surgery\n\nCardiovascular or respiratory diseases/other chronic or severe diseases Vascular disorders\n\nDrug allergies\n\nDo you have any questions or anything that you would like to discuss?\n\nDirect questions at follow-up\n\nHow are you?\n\nHow do you think your eyes are doing?\n\nDo you think your condition is better, stable or worse? Do you have difficulty with your daily tasks? Do you understand your diagnosis?\n\nAre you having any problems with your drops? Are you worried about your sight?\n\nHave you been using your eye drops as prescribed?\n\nDo you administer the drops by yourself or by a relative? If by yourself, please show me how you do it\n\nDo you have any questions or anything that you would like to discuss?\n\nI.5 What Matters to Patients?\n\nI.5.1 Anxiety associated with glaucoma\n\nDiagnosis - especially when unexpected - is an obvious moment of anxiety for patients, and one which can be mitigated by the provision of timely support or more information. Empathy is particularly important when providing a diagnosis - put yourself in the patient’s shoes, try to understand what they are thinking and feeling and give them plenty of opportunity to ask questions and express their fears.\n\nAnxiety does not dissipate once the shock of diagnosis has passed: concerns about future deterioration in sight, about ability to hold a driving license, about difficulties with healthcare provision, and about age-related difficulty in managing treatment are all common. The perception of disease is likely influenced by family history and how family members have been affected by glaucoma.\n\nI.5.2 The information gap\n\nA lack of information can in itself be a source of anxiety and uncertainty. Not understanding clinical systems, being unable to formulate pertinent questions and feeling undervalued in clinical consultations are all common experiences for patients, and exacerbate the information gap. In contrast, the presence of information can enable engagement in self-care and can support changes in lifestyle which result in a more effective management of glaucoma.\n\nKey information gaps include:\n\nNature of glaucoma sight loss\n\nEven long-term patients may struggle to understand the nature of glaucoma sight loss. Helping people to understand the specifics of their own field loss can also help them develop techniques to avoid trips and falls. People may assume that surgery or laser will improve vision, so volunteering the correct information is often helpful.\n\nGlaucoma and driving\n\nThis is one of the major sources of stress and anxiety for patients, yet there is confusion amongst professionals about local driving regulations and when a patient may need to notify the authorities, and patients continue to receive incorrect or inconsistent advice. This anxiety is understandable given the potential impact of losing a driving licence.\n\nEye drops\n\nPatients’ ability to manage their condition varies depending on their personal circumstances. Drops change, personal circumstances change, attitudes to treatment evolve. Continue checking in with your patients, encourage discussion and frame questions to avoid judgement or censure. E.g., “Do you have any concerns or difficulties with your eye drops?”.\n\nFor the patient, it often seems that every clinician thinks drops is someone else’s job. Every clinic should have a health care professional who takes pro- active responsibility for drop education. Patients need ongoing information about adherence – not just when their drop regime changes or when there are supply issues or side effects. Patients need to be encouraged to speak up when they have problems with drops, and need to know where they can go for help.\n\nSurgery and laser\n\nThe route to making a treatment decision is complex, and many patients need considerable support, advice and time. Take the time to explain to patients the possible outcomes and risks of their condition and treatment, in a manner suitable to each individual. Trabeculectomy or another glaucoma surgery is a routine procedure for a surgeon, but for the patient, the prospect of someone taking a knife to their eye is terrifying, and they’re likely to forget how you delivered the news to them. Providing accurate timely written information for people to take away can mean patients are reassured and empowered to go ahead with treatment, and where an informed patient declines surgery, they are in a better position to understand the risk they are taking and the potential impact.\n\nAsking questions is difficult\n\nPatients often find it hard to ask for information from healthcare professionals. Some find the clinical setting is not conducive to engagement, others describe doctors who do not want to engage with them, and many ration their time with their healthcare provider because they feel guilty about using doctors’ time.\n\nFor others, the difficulty lies in not knowing how to frame questions about their glaucoma. It might be that a lack of knowledge makes it hard for them to shape or construct meaningful questions, they may lack confidence, or it might be difficulties with memory or hearing that inhibits people.\n\nClinicians should help by inviting questions at every single appointment, encouraging patients to bring written questions with them, or to bring a friend or relative along for support.\n\nGlaucoma support groups\n\nThese are excellent vehicles for information dissemination and valuable peer support opportunities.\n\nIn summary, remember that patients’ information needs are complex – and equally complex for those newly diagnosed as those diagnosed decades ago. Even patients who initially appear well-informed often lack key information or skills to manage their condition. Offer them information about their condition and treatment and encourage them to ask questions. And provide a means for them to get back in touch with the clinic if required.\n\nFunctional loss over time guides Individualised treatment\n\nI.6 Glaucoma Epidemiology\n\nEpidemiological studies have contributed immensely to the better understanding of glaucoma and its impact to society. A synopsis of key epidemiologic findings is presented below.\n\nPopulation-based studies on glaucoma have been conducted in several parts of the world, including in some European countries.1-8\n\nVery few among those, have re-examined their population to provide highly valued longitudinal data.3,9-13 Based on population-based studies, we have gained knowledge on: a) the burden of glaucoma, b) the natural history and blindness caused by glaucoma\n\nc) risk factors for glaucoma, and d) other important public health issues, such as the under- and over-diagnosis of glaucoma.\n\nI.6.1 Burden of glaucoma\n\nGlaucoma is among the leading causes of blindness worldwide.14 The estimated global prevalence of open angle glaucoma (OAG) is 3.5% in 40-80-year olds and of angle closure glaucoma (ACG) 0.50%.15,16 The number of people with glaucoma was estimated to be 76 million in 2020 and expected to increase to 112 million by 2040. The prevalence of glaucoma is influenced by race: OAG is more prevalent in black populations, while ACG is more prevalent in East Asian populations.\n\nI.6.2 Natural history of glaucoma and blindness\n\nWhile OAG is far more common than ACG, blindness is more likely to happen in ACG than in OAG (estimated 25% and 10% over the patient lifetime, respectively).14,15 Due to the established benefit of IOP-lowering treatment in glaucoma, there have been very few opportunities to study the course of untreated glaucoma over time. Valuable data on the natural course of OAG have also been provided by the Early Manifest Glaucoma Trial (EMGT, see I.7.1.4), the United Kingdom Glaucoma Treatment Study (UKGTS, see I.7.1.5) and the Collaborative Normal-Tension Glaucoma Study (see I.7.1.1). In the untreated arm of the EMGT, the overall natural rate of progression in the VF was 1.08 dB/year. Participants with different disease phenotypes exhibited different rates of progression (1.31 dB/year in high tension glaucoma, 0.36 dB/year in normal tension glaucoma and 3.13 dB/year in pseudoexfoliative glaucoma (PXFG).13\n\nI.6.3 Risk factors for glaucoma\n\nOlder age, elevated IOP, non-White ethnicity (particularly Black), family history of glaucoma, pseudoexfoliation, disc haemorrhage and myopia (see also II.2.2) have been reported as major risk factors for the development of OAG.15,17,18 Highest prevalence of PACG appears in East-Asian and Chinese race.15\n\nI.6.4 Under-and overdiagnosis of glaucoma\n\nSeveral population-based studies have reported that at least 50% of glaucoma cases remain undiagnosed in Europe.8,18,19 Glaucoma associated with normal range of IOP is more likely to be underdiagnosed. Higher rates of undiagnosed glaucoma have been reported in Asia and Africa.\n\nConversely, there are very limited data on the overdiagnosis and overtreatment of OAG, which is also expected to occur in clinical practice. The Thessaloniki Eye Study recently reported that the overdiagnosis of OAG is actually substantial in an elderly, white European population.20\n\nReferences, with an emphasis on European studies:\n\n1.

The cost-effectiveness of management options should also be considered by physicians, in order to provide sustainable healthcare.\n\nI.7 Landmark Randomised Controlled Trials for Glaucoma\n\nIn the following pages we briefly summarize results from some high quality. randomised controlled trials (RCTs) for glaucoma and derive comments relevant to clinical decision- making.\n\nI.7.1 Treatment vs no treatment trials in open angle\n\nI.7.1.1 Collaborative normal tension glaucoma study (CNTGS)\n\nCNTGS compared treatment versus no treatment in normal tension glaucoma in a multicentre randomised trial. 230 eligible patients entered the study. Only those who exhibited verified progression of VF loss or threat to fixation were randomised (n=140). The primary outcome measure was disease progression as evident from VF or stereo disc photographs.1\n\nSummary of results2-5:\n\n– A 30% IOP reduction from baseline was the treatment goal and was maintained in nearly 50% of patients. Progression occurred in 12% (7/61) of treated eyes and 35% (28/79) of controls.\n\n– In the intent-to-treat analysis no benefit of treatment was found.\n\n– A beneficial effect of IOP lowering was found only after the data were censored for the effect of cataract formation on the VF.\n\n– Cataracts were more common in patients treated with surgery.\n\n– Progression rates varied a lot. The mean progression rate in the untreated arm was 0.41 dB/year. Prior documented progression did not increase the risk of future progression.\n\nReferences:\n\n1. Group CN-TGS.

A total of 1,636 patients were recruited. Randomisation was between treatment with medications and no treatment. The treatment goal was to lower the IOP to < 24 mmHg and at least 20% from baseline. The primary outcome was the development of primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) defined as reproducible VF defects or reproducible optic disc deterioration. After the 5-year initial results were reported the control group received treatment.1\n\nSummary of results2-6:\n\n– Mean IOP reduction was 22.5% in the treated group. The control group showed a decrease of IOP of 4.0%.\n\n– Risk factors for development of glaucoma were: thinner CCT, higher IOP, disc haemorrhages, older age, larger vertical and horizontal CDR, greater VF pattern standard deviation (PSD).\n\n– Disc haemorrhages detectable in photographs had been missed at 87% of clinical examinations. Rate of conversion was higher in eyes with haemorrhages.\n\n– After 5 years 4.4% of patients in the treated group had developed signs of glaucoma damage versus 9.5% in controls (p < 0.0001), a 50% reduction of relative risk.\n\n– In addition, more than 90% of untreated patients had not converted to glaucoma after 5 years.\n\n– After 13 years 22% of patients who had initially been randomised to the control group had converted to glaucoma versus 16% in the group that was treated at the start of the study.\n\n– POAG conversion was detected first in disc photographs in around 50% of patients and by field testing in approximately 40%.\n\n– A risk calculator is freely available to estimate the risk of developing glaucoma at 5 years. http://ohts.wustl.edu/risk/calculator.htm.\n\n– Cataract formation was more common in the medication group.\n\nReferences:\n\n1.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of IOP reduction by dorzolamide in preventing glaucoma damage in patients with OHT. The patients were randomised into 2 groups: active therapy (dorzolamide) and placebo. Main outcome measures were VF and/or optic disc changes.1\n\nSummary of results2-6:\n\n1081 patients were enrolled. The median duration of follow-up was 55 months. The IOP difference between the treatment and the control group was small. The mean IOP reduction was 15% after 6 months and 22% after 5 years in the dorzolamide group, but there was also a 9% reduction after 6 months and 19% after 5 years in the placebo group, to a large part attributable to high attrition.\n\nThe study failed to detect a statistically significant difference between the chosen medical therapy and placebo, either in IOP lowering effect, or in the rate of progression to POAG, and attrition was large.\n\nThe same predictors for the development of POAG were identified independently in both the OHTS observation group and the EGPS placebo group-baseline older age, higher IOP, thinner CCT, larger vertical CDR, and higher Humphrey VF PSD.\n\nIn a later paper, diuretics use were pointed as a possible risk factor.4 Several baseline Heidelberg retina tomograph (HRT) parameters, alone or in combination with baseline clinical and demographic factors, were significantly associated with the development of open angle glaucoma among the EGPS participants.\n\nReferences:\n\n1.

Treatment or no-treatment remained unchanged as long as definite progression had not occurred. Primary outcome measure was progression of disease, defined by sustained VF deterioration or optic disc changes.1\n\nSummary of results2-18:\n\n– This study was the first to prove and quantify the value of IOP reduction in patients with POAG, normal tension glaucoma (NTG) and PXFG.\n\n– A 25% decrease of IOP from baseline (mean untreated IOP 20.6 mmHg) reduced the relative risk of progression by 50%.\n\n– Risk of progression was smaller with lower baseline IOP values and with a larger initial IOP drop induced by treatment.\n\n– Treatment efficacy regarding IOP reduction depended very much on pre-treatment IOP.\n\n– Important risk factors for progression were: higher IOP, pseudoexfoliative syndrome (PXF), more baseline damage, higher age, disc haemorrhages, thinner CCT in high tension glaucoma, and low blood pressure in normal tension glaucoma.\n\n– IOP fluctuation was not a risk factor for progression.\n\n– IOP did not increase but remained constant over time in untreated eyes with POAG, but increased over time in eyes with PXFG.\n\n– Increase in lens opacity occurred more in the treatment arm than in the control arm.\n\n– There was no evidence of VF improvement on initiation of glaucoma therapy.\n\n– Disease progression rates varied substantially between individual patients.\n\n– Untreated progression rates (natural history) were slower in NTG than in HTG, while eyes with PXFG progressed much faster.\n\n– Definite progression was associated with a mean worsening of mean defect (MD) of less than 2dB.\n\n– In eyes with manifest glaucoma, progression in the VF was detected first more than 4 times as often as progression in the optic disc. Among fellow eyes without VF loss at baseline, progression was detected first as frequently in the optic disc as in the VF. Perimetric progression was detected first at all stages of the disease.\n\n– After a few years of follow-up, vision-related QoL did not differ between treatment arms, i.e. the absence or presence of treatment did not influence QoL. An analysis after 20 years of follow-up supports the widespread, albeit arbitrary, use of a better-eye remaining VF loss greater than 50% as an important threshold for a significant reduction in vision-related QoL.\n\n– The frequency of disc haemorrhages was higher with lower IOP, in women and with myopia and was not influenced by treatment.\n\n– An analysis of EMGT patients followed for at least 15 years showed that a glaucoma diagnosis made by applying strict criteria to 2 initial VF tests, supported by optic disc findings if VF findings were borderline, was almost always correct.\n\nReferences:\n\n1.

The primary outcome was time to VF deterioration within 24 months. Progression was measurable in such time frame since the frequency of visual fied examination was increased.1\n\nSummary of results2-5:\n\n– Untreated IOP was 19.6 ± 4.6 and 20.1 ± 4.8 in the latanoprost group and in the placebo group, respectively.\n\n– Mean reduction in IOP was 3.8 ± 4.0 mmHg in the latanoprost group and 0.9 ± 3.8 mmHg in the placebo group.\n\n– This placebo-controlled trial is the only trial to quantify VF preservation with a single IOP-lowering drug in patients with OAG, in this case a PGAs.\n\n– The 20% reduction in IOP in the latanoprost group, from a baseline of 19.6 mmHg, was associated with significantly longer VF preservation than in the placebo group (HR: 0.44).\n\n– The risk of progression was 7% higher per mmHg higher basleine IOP, 59% higher if both eyes of a patient had glaucoma, and was double if baseline disc haemorrhage was present.\n\n– Patient age and severity of VF loss were not associated with risk of progression.\n\n– Definite progression was associated with a mean worsening of MD of about 1.6 dB.\n\n– QoL was not different between treatment arms.\n\n– Faster rates of retinal nerve fibre layer thinning, measured by OCT, was associated with a greater risk of VF progression.\n\n– 25.6% patients in the placebo group reached the VF deterioration endpoint at 24 months compared with 15.2% in the latanoprost group.\n\n– Combining VF and OCT data identified progression more quickly than using only VF data.\n\nReferences:\n\n1.

There was a composite primary outome: PAS or IOP over 24 mmHg or development of glaucoma.1\n\nSummary of the results2-4:\n\n– After 6 years, there was a difference between treatment groups but the frequency of patients reaching the primary outcome was very low.\n\n– A primary outcome event occurred in 19 treated eyes and 36 untreated eyes (p=0.0041).\n\n– Primary outcome occurred in 4.19 per 1000 eye-years in treated eyes vs 7.97 per 1000 eye-years in untreated eyes (hazard ratio 0.53; p=0.024).\n\n– The authors suggest that routine prophylactic LPI should not be performed routinely.\n\n– LPI is advisable only in high risk eyes (see I.3, question 14).\n\n– It is uncertain whether the findings of this trial are generalisable to non-Chinese populations.\n\nReferences:\n\n1.

ATT: ALT, followed by trabeculectomy, followed by a second trabeculectomy, or\n\n2. TAT: trabeculectomy, followed by ALT, followed by a second trabeculectomy.\n\nEnrolled eyes had consistent elevation of IOP of ≥ 18 mmHg. Patients with MD worse than -16 dB were excluded, thus excluding eyes with severe glaucoma. About 1/3 of patients had early glaucoma.1\n\nSummary of results2-9:\n\n– After 7 years, mean reduction of IOP was greater for eyes assigned to the TAT protocol, and the cumulative probability of failure of the first intervention was greater for eyes assigned to the ATT protocol.\n\n– The percentage of eyes with decreased visual acuity or VF progression was lower for the ATT sequence than for TAT in African American patients. Initial trabeculectomy slowed the progression of glaucoma more effectively in patients with white European ancestry.\n\n– The probability of cataract formation after 5 years was high after trabeculectomy, 78%.\n\n– Risk factors associated with progression were older age, longer follow-up, and increasing number of glaucoma interventions.\n\n– IOP fluctuations were a risk factor for VF progression only in patients with low mean IOP.\n\n– Both ALT and trabeculectomy failed more often in younger patients and in eyes with higher pre-treatment IOP.\n\n– The surgical technique for performing trabeculectomies changed during the study period. Prior to 1990, antimetabolites were not used during surgery. After 1990, 5-fluorouracil was used postoperatively. After 1991, mitomycin-C was used intraoperatively.\n\n– In a post-hoc analysis of patients with 6-years of follow-up or more, eyes with an average IOP > 17.5 mmHg over the first three 6-months visits showed more frequent VF deterioration compared to eyes with an average IOP < 14 mmHg. There was no average VF progression, as measured by MD, in eyes with IOP < 18 mmHg at 100% of the visits, whereas eyes with less stringent IOP control demonstrated VF progression.9\n\nReferences:\n\n1.

A target IOP algorithm was used tailored for each individual eye. Primary outcome variables were VF progression and QoL. Secondary outcome variables were visual acuity, IOP, and cataract formation. Inclusion criteria may have allowed recruitment of some patients with OHT, resulting in a case mix with a smaller risk of showing progression.1\n\nSummary of results2-10:\n\n– IOP reduction was larger with surgery (48%; mean post treatment IOP 14-15 mmHg) than with medications (35%; mean post treatment IOP 17-18 mmHg).\n\n– In the first few years, mean perimetric progression among all subjects was small and similar in both groups. After 8 years 21% of surgical patients and 25% of medical patients had progressed, defined as a worsening of MD by 3 dBs.\n\n– After adjustment for baseline risk factors, larger IOP variation measures were associated with significantly worse MD values after 3 to 9 years in the medication arm but not in the surgically treated group.\n\n– QoL was initially better in the medically treated group but there was no difference in QoL at the last follow-up. Worry about becoming blind was reported by 50% of CIGTS participants at baseline, but decreased in both treatment groups to 25% and remained constant thereafter.\n\n– 1.1% of surgical patients had developed endophthalmitis after 5 years.\n\n– Patients randomised to the surgery arm underwent cataract surgery more than twice as often as patients in the medical treatment group.\n\n– Reversal of optic disc cupping was seen in 13% in the surgical group, but was not associated with improved visual function.\n\n– Risk factors for progression differed by treatment group. Patients with more advanced VF loss at baseline had less risk of progression when they received initial surgery versus medication, but VF progression among participants with diabetes who received surgery was greater than those receiving medication. Greater VF progression was observed among medication arm participants who reported poorer adherence to medications.\n\n– Risk factors for progression included higher baseline IOP, worse baseline VF status, and lower level of education.\n\nReferences:\n\n1.

Eyes in the SLT, ‘laser-1st’ arm, had up to two SLT treatments before drops if required. Treatment was to pre-set target IOPs based on severity and pre-treatment IOP. Treatment escalation was according to strict objective criteria. The primary outcome was health-related QoL assessed with the EQ-5D at 3 years. Target IOPs were revised upwards if there was no progression. Approximately 50% of study participants were OHT and another 50% were early stage glaucoma.1\n\nSummary of the results1-5:\n\n– There was no differences in health-related QoL between the two groups.\n\n– After 3 years 74% of the laser-1st group remained within target without medication, required fewer trabeculectomies (nil vs 11) and suffered less disease progression than patients in the medication-1st arm.\n\n– SLT was safe and cost-effective compared with medications.\n\n– SLT could be routinely offered to all newly diagnosed patients with POAG/OHT.\n\nReferences:\n\n1.

Eligible patients were aged 50 years or older, did not have cataracts, and had newly diagnosed PAC with IOP 30 mmHg or greater or PACG. 419 patients were randomised and followed up for 3 years, of whom 208 were assigned to lens extraction and 211 to LPI. Primary outcome measures included QoL, assessed with the European Quality of Life-5 Dimentions (EQ-5D), IOP, and cost-effectiveness assessed at 3 years.1\n\nSummary of results2-4:\n\n– This study supports the use of initial lens extraction as a first-line intervention for PACG and PAC with high IOP. At 36 months, results show a small but unquestionable advantage of primary lens extraction over LPI for all measured primary outcomes.\n\n– The mean health status score on the EQ-5D (range 0; 1) after lens extraction was 0.052 higher than after LPI.\n\n– The mean IOP was 1.18 mm Hg lower after lens extraction than after LPI (clinicians were allowed to escalate treatment to achieve target IOP).\n\n– Significantly fewer participants in the lens extraction group needed treatment including medications and glaucoma surgery to control IOP than patients who received LPI.\n\n– The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was better for initial lens extraction versus LPI (calculated on a subset of patients treated in the UK; not conclusive for other settings).\n\n– Patients undergoing lens extraction became emmetropic (mean final refraction, 0.08 diopters) whereas those assigned to LPI remained hyperopic (0.92 diopters).\n\n– VF severity at 3 years remained similar in the two treatment groups.\n\n– Lens extraction can cause endothelial cell loss; this assessment was not part of the EAGLE trial.\n\n– Enrolled patients had either PAC with IOP > 30 mmHg (a minority of patients with this condition) or PACG without advanced damage. The study results are not generalisable to all PAC or PACG cases.\n\n– In this trial the participating surgeons were experienced. Lens extraction to treat angle closure can be technically challenging.\n\nReferences:\n\n1. Azuara-Blanco A, Burr J, Ramsay C, et al.

Also economic simulation models of cost effectiveness of screening reported inconclusive results with large uncertainties. There is no evidence that interventions (e.g., training) improve opportunistic case finding.\n\nI.8.2 Clinical and cost effectiveness of diagnostic tests used for screening, detection and monitoring for glaucoma\n\nAlthough there are numerous comparative diagnostic studies, there is no evidence which test, or combination of tests improve patient outcomes, at a sustainable cost. There is a high degree of variability in the design and suboptimal quality of studies of diagnostic accuracy of technologies for glaucoma. Moreover, cost varies with different national or regional health-systems.\n\nI.8.3 Effectiveness of treatment of glaucoma and ocular hypertension in preventing visual disability\n\nThere is high-level evidence that treatment decreases IOP and reduces the risk of conversion to and deterioration of glaucoma compared to no treatment.\n\nBased on the economic simulation models in the US, UK, Holland, and China, treating glaucoma is likely to be cost-effective compared to ‘no treatment’. There is uncertainty about the cost-effectiveness of treating OHT.1,7-9\n\nComment:\n\nThe published simulation models are based on characteristics of participants enrolled in RCTs which may not include all important predictors in the general population and every-day practice. In addition, RCTs may give an optimistic impression of outcomes compared to ‘real life’ with poorer compliance and adherence to care both in patients and clinicians in implementing the guidelines and care protocols. As the data of glaucoma inducing visual disability are limited, the blindness rates in the modelling studies use different estimates. Similarly, the data on utility values and influence of glaucoma severity in health status are limited. Retrospective observational data is incomplete and selective. Reliable and ‘realistic’ data (preferably from large randomised trials or prospective cohorts of ‘usual patients’) is not available so far.\n\nI.8.4 Follow-up practices and models of care\n\nThere is no solid evidence of the optimum monitoring schemes, (e.g. frequency and timing of visits, technologies to be used for detecting progression) for patients with manifest glaucoma or OHT. Some modeling and retrospective studies suggest that more treatment may allow less frequent monitoring visits in OHT and stable glaucoma. It has been proposed that more frequent visits in the first two years from the first diagnosis may be cost-effective.\n\nI.9 Terminology, Classification and Definitions\n\nClassification and disease definitions are necessarily arbitrary. A consensus can be reached only if they are acceptable to most ophthalmologists on both theoretical and practical grounds. There are conditions where a precise classification is particularly challenging, such as congenital disorders associated with other anomalies.\n\nThe following features are to be considered in order to manage the patient.\n\n1. Anatomy / Structure (see II.1)\n\nOpen angle, angle closed, optic nerve head, etc.\n\ne.g. clinical signs, pseudoexfoliation, pigment dispersion\n\n2. Function (see II.1.4)\n\ne.g. visual field\n\n3. Intraocular pressure level (see II.1)\n\n1. At which diagnosis is made (see II.2)\n\n2. Target intraocular pressure (see II.3.3)\n\n3. General conditions: life expectancy, comorbidities\n\n4. Identifiable cause\n\nPrimary open angle glaucoma is a chronic, progressive, potentially blinding, irreversible eye disease causing optic nerve rim and RNFL loss with related visual field defects. The angle is open with a normal appearance, and major risk factors include the level of IOP and older age. Visual disability is usually prevented by early diagnosis and treatment. See II.2.2\n\nPart II • Chapter 1\n\nPatient Examination\n\nII.1.1 Intraocular Pressure (IOP) and Tonometry\n\nThe intraocular pressure (IOP) in the population is approximately normally distributed with a right skew. The mean IOP in adult populations is estimated at 15-16 mmHg, with a standard deviation of nearly 3.0 mmHg. Traditionally, normal IOP has been defined as two standard deviations above the mean, i.e. 21 mmHg, and any IOP above this level is considered to be elevated. However, any arbitrary threshold of IOP is a false measure to distinguish between health and disease.\n\nThe level of IOP is a major risk factor for the development of glaucoma and its progression (see II.3.3).\n\nIOP diurnal variations can be substantial and are larger in glaucoma patients than in healthy individuals. Evaluating the IOP at different times of the day can be useful in selected patients.\n\nII.1.1.1 Methods of measurement (tonometry)\n\nTonometry is based on the relationship between the IOP and the force necessary to deform the natural shape of the cornea by a given amount. Corneal biomechanical properties, such as thickness and elasticity, can affect the IOP measurements (Table 1.1). Tonometers can be described as contact or non-contact. Some instruments are portable and hand-held.\n\nII.1.1.1.1 Goldmann applanation tonometry (GAT)\n\nThe most frequently used instrument, and the current reference standard, is the GAT, mounted at the slit lamp. The method involves illumination of the biprism tonometer head with a blue light (obtained using a cobalt filter). The prism is used to flatten the anesthetised cornea which has fluorescein in the tear film. The scaled knob on the side of the instrument is then turned until the inner border of the two hemi-circles of fluorescent tear meniscus, visualised through each prism, just touch (Fig. II.1.1).\n\nThere are potential problems of using GAT in that contact with the tear film and the cornea may raise concerns regarding transmissible disease. Chemical disinfection or the use of disposable tonometer heads is recommended. The tonometer calibration should be verified regularly according to the manufacturer instructions.\n\nErrors with GAT can be due to incorrect technique (Fig. II.1.2) and to the biological variability of the cornea and eye. Valsalva’s manoeuvre, breath-holding, squeezing the lids or the examiner touching the lids or a tight tie can all falsely increase the IOP reading. The Perkins tonometer is a portable version of GAT. All precautions to sterilize the GAT prism should be taken.\n\nTechnique of Goldmann Applanation Tonometry.\n\nNote: In case of high or irregular astigmatism, corrections should be made. One option is to do two measurements, the first with the biprism in horizontal position and the second in vertical position and the readings should be averaged. Another way of correcting large regular astigmatism (> 3 D) is to align the red mark of the prism with the axis of the minus cylinder.\n\nII.1.1.1.2 Alternative tonometers (in alphabetical order) (see also I.3, question 2)\n\nA complete list of all available technologies is beyond the scope of the guidelines.\n\nDynamic contour tonometry (DCT, or Pascal)\n\nThis slit-lamp mounted instrument contains a sensor tip with concave surface contour and a miniaturised pressure sensor. The result and a quality score measure are provided digitally. This technique may be less influenced by CCT than GAT. The DCT additionally measures the ocular pulse amplitude which is the difference between the mean systolic and the mean diastolic IOP.\n\nNon-contact tonometry (NCT)\n\nThe NCT or air-puff tonometry uses a rapid air pulse to flatten the cornea, thus working on the same basic principle as the Goldmann tonometer. The advantages include speed, no need for topical anaesthesia and no direct contact with the eye. There are several models available in the market. Some patients find the air-puff uncomfortable. The average of several readings per eye is recommended.\n\nOcular Response Analyser (ORA) and 7CR\n\nThe ORA utilises air-puff technology to record two applanation measurements, one while the cornea is moving inward, and the other as the cornea returns towards its normal shape. The average of these two IOP values provides a Goldmann- correlated IOP measurement. The difference between these two IOP readings is called corneal hysteresis, a result of viscous damping in the corneal tissue. The two applanation measurements provide a basis for two additional new parameters: corneal-compensated IOP (IOPcc) and corneal resistance factor. The corneal-compensated IOP is a measurement that is less affected by the corneal properties. The average of several good quality readings per eye is recommended.\n\nCorvis ST tonometer\n\nThe Corvis ST is an air-puff tonometer combined with a high-speed Scheimpflug camera which records the corneal deformation during the air-puff. Outputs include an uncorrected IOP, a corneal biomechanically-corrected IOP and CCT.\n\nRebound tonometry\n\nThe rebound tonometer (iCare), is portable and easy to use. Although it is a contact tonometer topical anaesthetic drops are not required and the tonometer has a disposable tip to minimise the risk of cross-infection. The device processes the rebound movement of a rod probe resulting from its interaction with the eye; rebound increases (shorter duration of impact) as the IOP increases.\n\nSix measurements are taken and their average is displayed. The rebound tonometer can be particularly useful in children. The iCare Home device is a variation that has been designed for self tonometry.\n\nTono-Pen\n\nThe Tono-Pen is a hand-held portable tonometer that determines IOP by making contact with the cornea (central contact is recommended) through a probe tip, causing applanation/indentation of a small area. Topical anaesthetic eye drops are used. After four valid readings are obtained, the averaged measurement is given together with the standard error.\n\nBoth the iCare and Tono-Pen are useful for patients with corneal disease and surface irregularity as the area of contact is small.\n\nII.1.1.1.3 Self-tonometry\n\nSelf-tonometry (e.g., with iCare Home) can be useful in some circumstances. However, it cannot replace clinic-based IOP measures.\n\nII.1.1.2 Intraocular pressure and central corneal thickness (see also I.3, question 4)\n\nCCT influences GAT readings (Table 1.1). IOP correction algorithms based on CCT are not validated and should be avoided. There are different methods to measure CCT. The normal distribution (mean ± SD) of ultrasonic CCT is 540 ± 30 μm.\n\nCCT variations after corneal refractive surgery make difficult to interpret tonometric readings. A record of pre-operative CCT and IOP is helpful to manage patients undergoing refractive surgery.\n\nII.1.2 Gonioscopy\n\nGonioscopy is essential for evaluating patients suspected of having, or who have glaucoma (See FC II and I.3 Question 5).\n\nThe purpose of gonioscopy is to inspect the anterior chamber angle. It is based on the recognition of angle landmarks and must always include an assessment of the following:\n\n– Level of iris insertion, both apparent without indentation and true after indentation\n\n– Shape of the peripheral iris profile either flat, convex or concave\n\n– Width of the iridocorneal angle between peripheral iris and cornea\n\n– Degree, type and distribution of trabecular meshwork pigmentation\n\n– Areas of iridotrabecular apposition or synechia\n\nFC II – Diagnostic gonioscopy in open angle glaucoma\n\nII.1.2.1 Anatomy\n\nII.1.2.1.1 Reference landmarks\n\nSchwalbe’s line: this collagen condensation of the Descemet’s membrane between the trabecular meshwork (TM) and the corneal endothelium appears as a thin translucent line. Schwalbe’s line may be prominent and anteriorly displaced (posterior embryotoxon), or there may be heavy pigmentation over it. A pigmented Schwalbe’s line may be misinterpreted as the TM, particularly when the iris is convex and the angle is narrow. The corneal wedge method is helpful to distinguish between the structures by reliably identifying Schwalbe’s line.\n\nTrabecular Meshwork (TM): this extends posteriorly from Schwalbe’s line to the scleral spur. Close to Schwalbe’s line is the non-functional TM, blending into the posterior, functional and often pigmented TM. Most difficulties concerning examination of the TM relate to the determination of whether observed features are normal or pathological (particularly pigmentation), blood vessels and iris processes. Indentation (‘dynamic’) gonioscopy is helpful to detect TM in angle closure.\n\nSchlemm’s canal: it is located anterior to the scleral spur and it is not visible, though it may be seen if it contains blood. Blood reflux from episcleral veins may occur in cases of carotid-cavernous fistulae, Sturge Weber syndrome, venous compression, ocular hypotony, sickle cell disease or due to suction from the goniolens during gonioscopy.\n\nScleral spur: is of white appearance and located between the pigmented TM and the ciliary body.\n\nCiliary band and iris root: the iris insertion is usually located at the anterior face of the ciliary body, though the site is variable. The ciliary band may be wide, as in myopia, aphakia or following trauma, or narrow or not seen as in hyperopia, angle closure, and anterior insertion of the iris.\n\nPigmentation: pigment is found predominantly in the posterior TM. It is seen in adults, rarely before puberty and the extent can be highly variable. The most common conditions associated with dense pigmentation are: PXF, pigment dispersion syndrome (PDS), previous trauma, previous laser treatment of the iris, uveitis and after angle closure episodes.\n\nII.1.2.1.2 Other anatomical features\n\nBlood vessels: these are often found in normal iridocorneal angles in subjects with blue/light irides. They characteristically have a radial or circumferential orientation, have few anastomoses and do not run across the scleral spur. Pathological vessels e.g., neovascularisation, are usually thinner, have a disordered orientation and run across the scleral spur. Abnormal vessels are also seen in Fuchs’ heterochromic iridocyclitis and chronic anterior uveitis.\n\nIris processes: are present in one third of normal eyes, more evident in younger subjects. When numerous and prominent they may represent a form of Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome/ anomaly. They are distinguished from goniosynechiae which are thicker and wider and may go beyond the scleral spur.\n\nII.1.2.2 Techniques\n\nGonioscopy should be performed in a dimly-lit room, using a thin slit beam, taking care to avoid shining the light through the pupil. Pupil constriction on light exposure opens the angle resulting in an underestimation of the risk of angle closure.\n\nAngle width grading must be performed with the eye in primary position to avoid misclassification. If the patient looks in the direction of the mirror the angle appears wider and vice versa. A common pitfall is inadvertent pressure over the cornea, which will push back the iris, and gives an erroneously wide appearance to the angle. All precautions to sterilize the goniolens should be taken.\n\nThere are two main techniques for viewing the anterior chamber angle:\n\nDirect gonioscopy\n\nThe use of some contact goniolenses like the Koeppe or Barkan lens permits the light from the anterior chamber to pass through the cornea so that the angle may be viewed (Fig. II.1.4 A).\n\nIndirect gonioscopy\n\nThe light from the anterior chamber is made to exit via a mirror built into a contact glass (Fig. II.1.4 B).\n\nCommon gonioscopy lenses:\n\nDirect Koeppe (contact fluid required)\n\nLayden (sized for infants; contact fluid required) Worst\n\nSwan-Jacob\n\nIndirect Posner, Zeiss, Sussman or Khaw 4 mirrors (contact fluid not required)\n\nGoldmann lens, 1 to 4 mirrors (contact fluid required) CGA 1.4© Lasag (contact fluid required)\n\nMagnaview (contact fluid required)\n\nII.1.2.2.1 Gonioscopy technique without indentation\n\nPatient should be instructed to look straight ahead. With indirect Goldmann-type lenses it is helpful to start by viewing the inferior angle, which often appears wider and more pigmented than the superior angle. Then to continue rotating the mirror. The anterior surface of the lens should be kept perpendicular to the observation axis so that the appearance of the angle structure is not changed as the examination proceeds. The four quadrants are examined by a combination of slit-lamp movements and prism rotation.\n\nTo differentiate appositional from synechial closure “indentation” or “compression” dynamic gonioscopy is essential.\n\nII.1.2.2.2 ‘Dynamic’ gonioscopy by indentation or compression\n\nIt is recommended to use a small diameter lens for indentation (e.g.: 4-mirror). When gentle pressure is applied by the lens on the centre of the cornea, the aqueous humour (AH) and iris are pushed back. In appositional angle closure, the angle can be re-opened. If there is adhesion between the iris and the meshwork, as with goniosynechiae, that portion of angle remains closed (Fig. II.1.6 (3)).\n\nWhen pupillary block is the prevalent mechanism the iris becomes peripherally concave during indentation. In plateau configuration this iris concavity will not be extended by indentation to the extreme periphery, which is a sign of anteriorly placed ciliary processes called double hump sign (Fig II.1.5). When the crystalline lens has a particularly prominent role in angle closure, indentation causes the iris to move only slightly backwards, retaining a convex profile (Fig. II.1.6 (4)).\n\nII.1.2.3 Grading of the anterior chamber angle\n\nThe use of a grading system for gonioscopy is recommended. It encourages the observer to use a systematic approach in evaluating angle anatomy, allows comparison of findings at different times in the same patients, and classification of the angle.\n\nThe Spaeth gonioscopy grading system is the most detailed (Fig. II.1.7).\n\nOther practical grading systems are those of Shaffer and Kanski; both are based on angle width and visibility of the angle structures.\n\nII.1.2.3.1 Slit lamp-grading of peripheral AC depth - The Van Herick method\n\nThe Van Herick grading (Fig. II.1.8) is an indirect estimation of angle width, but it is not a substitute for gonioscopy. This technique is based on the use of corneal thickness as a unit measure of the depth of the anterior chamber at the furthest periphery, preferably on the temporal side.\n\nGrade 0 represents iridocorneal contact, i.e., angle closure.\n\nA space between iris and corneal endothelium of less than 1/4 corneal thickness, is equivalent to a Shaffer grade I and is interpreted as a high risk of anatomical angle closure. When the space is between 1/4 and 1/2 corneal thickness the grade is II, with very low risk of angle closure. A grade III is not occludable, with an irido/endothe- lial distance more than 1/2 corneal thickness. Alternatively, the peripheral anterior chamber depth may be expressed as a percentage of the peripheral corneal width.\n\nII.1.2.4 Anterior segment imaging techniques (see I.3, question 5)\n\nAnterior segment imaging such as ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM), anterior segment OCTs and Scheimpflug cameras can be useful in some circumstances but cannot replace gonioscopy. Added to gonioscopy, imaging techniques may help elucidate the mechanism of angle closure. UBM can be particularly helpful as it can image tissues behind the iris (anteriorly placed iris processes in plateau iris, tumours, cysts). Anterior segment imaging provide quantitative angle measurements and help documenting the dynamics of the chamber angle at different light conditions. Anterior segment imaging may classify more eyes as having angle closure than gonioscopy, thus it may lead to overdiagnosis. Automated 360° goniophotography is also available.\n\nSystematic reviews:\n\n– Jindal A, Ctori I, Virgili G, Lucenteforte E, Lawrenson JG. Non-contact tests for identi- fying people at risk of primary angle closure glaucoma. Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2020;5:CD012947.\n\nII.1.3 Optic nerve head and retinal nerve fibre layer\n\nGlaucoma changes the appearance of the ONH, particularly the neuroretinal rim and vessels, and the RNFL in a characteristic fashion.\n\nContour changes can best be appreciated with a magnified stereoscopic view prefer- ably through a dilated pupil. Interim examinations, aimed at detecting striking features such as disc haemorrhages, may be performed through an undilated pupil.\n\nStereoscopic examination of the posterior pole is best performed with:\n\n– Indirect non-contact fundus lens with sufficient magnification at the slit-lamp or\n\n– Direct contact fundus lens at the slit-lamp\n\nThe direct ophthalmoscope is also useful for ONH and RNFL examination.\n\nThe clinical evaluation of the ONH and RNFL should assess the following features.\n\nII.1.3.1 Clinical examination\n\nII.1.3.1.1 Neuroretinal rim\n\nIn a healthy eye, the shape of the rim is influenced by size, shape and tilting of the ONH. The disc is usually slightly vertically oval, often more so in black subjects who may also have larger discs. In medium-size discs, the neuroretinal rim is typically at least as wide at the 12 and 6 o’clock positions as elsewhere and usually widest in the infero-temporal sector, followed by the supero-temporal, nasal and then temporal sectors (see Fig. II.1.9). This pattern, described as ISN’T distribution, is less obvious in larger discs, in which the rim is distributed more evenly and in a smaller discs where cupping may not be evident. Larger and a smaller discs are harder to interpret: e.g., in small discs the changes associated with glaucoma may not result in cupping, but ‘saucerization’ of the disc surface instead. In large optic discs the normal rim width is relatively narrow and can potentially be misinterpreted as glaucomatous.\n\nThe exit of the optic nerve from the eye may be oblique, giving rise to a tilted disc. Tilted discs are more common in myopic eyes, and show a wider, gently sloping rim in one disc sector in the direction of the tilt and a narrower, more sharply-defined rim in the opposite sector. Discs in highly myopic eyes are even harder to interpret.\n\nGlaucoma is characterised by progressive narrowing of the neuroretinal rim. The pattern of rim loss varies and may take the form of diffuse narrowing, localised notching, or both in combination (Fig. II.1.10). Narrowing of the rim, while occurring in all disc sectors, is generally more common and greatest at the inferior and superior poles.\n\nII.1.3.1.2 Retinal nerve fibre layer\n\nThe RNFL appearance can be best assessed in the central 60° at the posterior pole with a blue filter photograph. Clinically at the slit lamp, the RNFL is best evaluated with a red-free light and low magnification and/or with a short, narrow beam of bright white light at high magnification around the circumference of the optic disc within about two disc diameters of the disc margin. The RNFL surface is best seen if the focus is adjusted just anterior to the main retinal vessels.\n\nThe fibre bundles are seen as radial silver striations around the disc, Slit-like, groove- like, or spindle-shaped apparent defects, narrower than the retinal vessels, may be seen in the normal fundus. The RNFL may become less visible with age, and is more difficult to see in less pigmented fundi.\n\nLocal (wedge and slit) defects are seen as dark bands, wider than retinal vessels which will extend to the disc margin. These local defects are more easily seen than generalised thin- ning of the RNFL, which manifests as a loss of brightness and density of striations. When the RNFL is thinned, the blood vessel walls appear sharp against a matt and mottled back- ground. The initial abnormality in glaucoma may be either diffuse thinning or localised defects.\n\nII.1.3.1.3 Optic disc haemorrhages\n\nA large proportion of glaucoma patients have optic disc haemorrhages at one time or another (Fig. II.1.11). They are very often overlooked at clinical examinations, and are easier to find in photographs. The clinical examination should include actively looking for disc haemorrhages. Many studies have shown that optic disc haemorrhages are associated with a higher risk for glaucomatous progression.\n\nII.1.3.1.4 Vessels at the optic disc\n\nNarrowing of the neuroretinal tissue will change the position of the vessels at the optic disc with bending, bayoneting or baring of circumlinear vessels. Those positional changes are particularly important to observe when looking for progression, and can be detected with sequential photographs.\n\nII.1.3.1.5 Parapapillary atrophy\n\nParapapillary atrophy can be differentiated into an alpha zone, which is present in most eyes, and into a beta zone, which is present in some normal eyes and in a high percentage of eyes with glaucoma. Beta parapapillary atrophy is common in myopic and older eyes.\n\nIn clinical practice, a large beta zone can be regarded as a clue, and not as a definite sign of glaucoma (Fig. II.1.12).\n\nII.1.3.1.6 Optic disc size (vertical disc diameter)\n\nThe optic disc size greatly varies in the population. The width of the rim and the size of the cup vary with the overall size of the disc. The mean vertical disc diameter is approximately 1.9 mm.\n\nThe vertical diameter of the optic disc can be measured at the slit lamp using a hand- held high power convex lens. The slit beam should be coaxial with the observation axis; a narrow beam is used to measure the vertical disc diameter using the inner margin of the white Elschnig’s ring as the reference. A correction factor needs to be used depending on the magnification of the handheld lens (Fig. II.1.13).\n\nII.1.3.1.7 Rim width and cup to disc ratio (CDR) (see “Things to avoid - choosing wisely” I.4)\n\nA large CDR has been used as a sign of glaucoma damage. However, the CDR depends mainly on the disc size, and a large CDR in normal large discs may be erro- neously considered glaucomatous and a small CDR in glaucomatous small discs may be erroneously considered as normal (Fig. II.1.13). The use of CDR to classify patients is not recommended and the attention should be focused on the neuroretinal rim.\n\nII.1.3.2 Recording of the optic nerve head (ONH) and RNFL features\n\nSome form of photography or imaging is recommended to provide a record of the ONH and RNFL appearance. If photos are not available, a detailed manual drawing is recommended. Even if it is difficult to draw a good picture of the ONH, the act of making a drawing encourages a thorough clinical evaluation of ONH. Document whether or not a disc haemorrhage is present.\n\nSequential photographs can be used to detect progression of optic disc and RNFL damage.\n\nII.1.3.2.1 Quantitative imaging (also see I.3)\n\nQuantitative imaging of the ONH, retinal nerve fibre layer and inner macular layers have been used widely to assist glaucoma diagnosis and to detect glaucomatous progression during follow-up. They should not and cannot replace clinical examination and VF testing. See details about OCT testing and interpretation at the EGS book “Glaucoma Imaging” (2017): https://www.eugs.org/eng/books.asp\n\nOptical coherence tomography\n\nOCT is based on interferometry and is a commonly used test. Current instruments are spectral domain and swept-source OCT systems. Their technical, software and reference database characteristics vary; therefore values measured with different OCT systems are not interchangeable. Three main parameter groups are measured and analysed for classification and detection of progression: ONH, peripapillary retinal nerve fibre layer and macular inner retinal layers.\n\nInterpretation of apparent progression in OCT has to be done with caution due to the possible variability of the measurements and possible non-glaucoma related changes. In cases of advanced loss, progression analysis may be beyond the dynamic range of the instrument.\n\nOCT angiography is a rapidly evolving technology the role of which is not yet defined in glaucoma management.\n\nConfocal Scanning laser\n\nThe HRT (Heidelberg Engineering, Heidelberg, Germany) is used to profile and meas- ure the three-dimensional anatomy of the ONH and surrounding tissues. It can also help detect progressive changes in ONH surface topography but apparent changes need to be interpreted in the clinical context.\n\nII.1.3.2.2 OCT for glaucoma diagnosis (also see I.3)\n\nOCT imaging instruments typically provide three potential outcomes: ‘within normal limits’, ‘borderline’ and ‘outside normal limits’. No imaging device provides a clinical diagnosis but just a statistical result, based on comparison of the measured parameters with the corresponding reference database of healthy eyes. Therefore an interpretation of the result in the context of all clinical data is mandatory. For instance, imaging artefacts and software errors are quite common and more frequent in eyes that are highly myopic or have tilted nerves. The clinician should assess the quality of the image and segmentation analysis and judge whether the reference database is relevant for the particular patient.\n\nThe various imaging technologies have their own advantages and limitations, and their classification shows only partial agreement with clinical exam in diagnosing glaucoma. Agreement between classification with quantitative imaging and VF testing is only moderate. Diagnosis of glaucoma based only on OCT exam should be avoided.\n\nAn OCT test “outside normal limits” may be a false positive and can be ignored especially if the clinical examination and VF test are normal and if there are no risk factors for glaucoma.\n\nII.1.3.2.3 Detection of progression with OCT (also see I.3)\n\nMost commercial imaging devices have software for quantifying glaucomatous pro- gression, including the rate of progression. These results may serve as additional tools for the assessment of glaucomatous progression but need careful interpretation in conjunction with other tests and patients circumstances. High quality baselines images are important. The user should assess the test series for the quality of images and software analysis before including the software output in the assessment of the patient. Agreement between structural progression and functional deterioration, over the relatively short duration of reported studies, is only partial or poor because of the measurement variability of both structural and functional tests. Most commercially available software does not compensate for aging, therefore statistically significant slopes do not necessarily mean true glaucomatous progression. Results acquired with different instruments are not interchangeable.\n\nII.1.4 Perimetry\n\nII.1.4.1 Perimetry techniques\n\nVF testing plays a central role in the diagnosis and, more importantly, the management of glaucoma. Loss of visual function is associated with loss of QoL, and it is therefore necessary to monitor each glaucoma patient’s VF status.\n\nStatic computerised perimetry is preferred in glaucoma management. Kinetic. e.g. Goldmann, perimetry is not suitable for detection of early glaucomatous field loss, since small defects can often be missed between isopters. Computerised perimetry is also less subjective; the results are numerical and tools for computer-assisted inter- pretation are available. Manual kinetic perimetry may be useful in end-stage disease and in the few patients unable to perform automated perimetry.\n\nII.1.4.1.1 Automated threshold perimetry\n\nThe term, standard automated perimetry (SAP), refers to static computerised threshold perimetry performed using standard Goldmann white stimuli on a white background, and is the recommended standard in glaucoma management.\n\nTesting algorithms and programs\n\nVarious perimeters attempt to estimate perimetric threshold sensitivity using different testing algorithms and patterns. Commonly used threshold algorithms in the Humphrey perimeter are Swedish interactive threshold algorithm (SITA) Standard, SITA Fast and SITA Faster. In the Octopus perimeter the Dynamic Strategy is often recommended. The Octopus TOP algorithm (tendency-oriented perimetry) is also often used. TOP is a fast strategy, as it exposes only one stimulus at each test point location, interpolating thresholds between several points.\n\nIn glaucoma patients and suspects, perimetry is usually performed using a Goldmann size III stimulus in the central 24° or 30° field, where the great majority of retinal ganglion cells are located. The VF outside 30° is seldom tested. In recent years it has sometimes been recommended to perform additional testing focussing on the central 10° of the field, in order to detect more central field loss. EGS does not recommend decreasing the frequency of standard 24° or 30° testing by replacing these tests with 10° tests. Such additional testing may be helpful in patients where structure/function findings do not agree, e.g., in eyes with normal central 24° or 30° VFs but pathological or suspect optic nerve or RNFL findings. Central field loss is very common in glaucoma and such loss even at very central points, often referred to as ‘threat to fixation’ is clinically worrysome since central VF defects can be symptomatic and compromise the ability to drive.\n\nTo the extent possible, it is advantageous to follow pa"
