        "text": "Some museums are taking climate action and we need ALL cultural organizations to recognize their power to make a difference in a changing climate. \"Despite the potential, authority, and capacity to engage their publics with the existential crises of our time the sector fails to live up to its promise.\" Learn how your organization can catch up in the essay by John Fraser and Sarah Sutton in the new book Museums and the Climate Crisis. https://lnkd.in/eHDdpmVM\n\nI am grateful for the opportunity to participate in this wonderful initiative, which was made possible through my collaboration with the CIMAM International Committee for Museums and Collections of Modern Art. I strongly believe that art and culture are essential components of sustainability, as they play a crucial role in achieving the 17 SDGs set forth by the United Nations. With their educational and co-creative nature, museums significantly impact the well-being of individuals and society, and therefore, the Art Charter for Climate Action is of utmost importance. ART2023\n\nüìåPartner Spotlight: Demos Helsinki Today, we are excited to introduce Demos Helsinki, a key contributor to societal transformation and climate governance. As part of the NetZeroCitiesEU consortium, they help cities develop the tools and strategies needed to tackle the climate crisis. In this carousel, discover: 1‚É£ What Demos Helsinki focuses on and how they contribute to climate action. 2‚É£ What inspired them to join NetZeroCities. 3‚É£ Their key roles and contributions within the project. 4‚É£ The challenges and inspirations they find in this ambitious journey. üëâ Swipe through to learn more about their impactful work and vision for climate-neutral cities! And learn more about them: https://demoshelsinki.fi/ #MissionCities #EUMissions #HorizonEU\n\nSports have good reason for caring about sustainability yet future Olympic games do need to adapt to climatic conditions if they are to take place at the peak of summer. The climate science is telling us of the probability that weather events, similar to what Paris has experienced (torrential rain follwed by intense heat), are likely to occur much more regularly depending on the climate scenario pathway chosen. We need to plan a climate resilient approach to such events and not simply rely on aircon, ice bags and schedule adjustment.\n\nPSA: üóΩ If you're unable to join the #nycclimateweek in person, there are a bunch of sessions that can be accessed virtually for free! üëèüèº Go to https://lnkd.in/ekuV9Rbq and filter by Format > Virtual üíª I'll (try to) attend: - The Role of the Voluntary Carbon Market in Advancing the SDGs from Sylvera - Selected sessions from We Don't Have Time Climate Hub - Short films from the Environmental Film Festival - How Big Tech impacts the climate emergency ‚Äì Routes to accountability There's really interesting content which makes it hard to choose and prioritize! Choose wisely üß†\n\nI'm looking forward to being at the first part of Climate Week NYC (Climate Group) and seeing many of you. Send me a message if you plan to be there, too! üêæ Sunday's events include: an Earth Law Center panel from 4:30-5:30 (https://lnkd.in/g3pQXtW3) and Clinton Global Initiative event. üêæ Monday events include official Climate Group programming plus a panel on \"The Roles of #Lawyers and Bar Associations in Combatting #ClimateChange\" at the New York City Bar Association featuring one my favorite co-authors (Camila Bustos) and several events by members of the 2023 Walking Softer Young Leaders Cohort. Also of note, I look forward to visiting the new Creative Time exhibition, the World's UnFair, by New Red Order opening in Long Island City (https://lnkd.in/g_acTvxW). About: \"Across an immersive spectacle of animatronics, large-scale sculptures, video installations, and powwow grounds, The World‚Äôs UnFair invites you to play a part in a decolonized future. Brought to you by New Red Order (NRO), a public secret society of informants and collaborators dedicated to rechannelling desires for indigeneity towards the expansion of Indigenous futures, The World‚Äôs UnFair offers a practical solution to growing calls for the return of Indigenous land: Give It Back.\" #climateweeknyc #climateweek #climatecrisis #climatechange #climateaction\n\nMy eyes are focused on Olympics Paris 2024 prime time to watch the world‚Äôs greatest athletes gather to push the boundaries of human achievement. At the same time we are shattering global climate records. Corporates can be the change in the climate game with renewable energy adoption, reforestation, and emissions reductions as part of their strategy to support ecosystems and economies. You can too - learn more about climate solutions for corporates and individuals, and what WWF is doing. https://lnkd.in/ehXtRpqS"
