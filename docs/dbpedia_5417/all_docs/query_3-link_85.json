        "meta_description": "Introduction Angle-closure is responsible for half of all glaucoma blindness globally. Patients with suspected glaucoma require assessment of the drainage angle by an experienced clinician. The goal of this study is to evaluate the diagnostic performance and cost-effectiveness of two non-contact tests, anterior segment OCT (Optical Coherence Tomography) (AS-OCT) and limbal anterior chamber depth for patients referred to hospital with suspected angle closure compared with gonioscopy by ophthalmologist.\n\nMethods and analysis Study design: prospective, multicentre, cross-sectional diagnostic accuracy study. Inclusion criteria: adults referred from community optometry to hospital with suspected angle closure. Primary outcome: Sensitivity and specificity. Secondary outcomes: Positive/negative likelihood ratios, concordance, cost-effectiveness, proportion of patients requiring subsequent clinical assessment by ophthalmologist. Sample size: 600 individuals who have been referred with suspected angle closure from primary care (community optometry). We will have a 95% probability of detecting the true sensitivity of either test to within ±3.5% based on a sensitivity of 90%. The study would also have a 95% probability of detecting the true specificity of either test to within ±5%, assuming a specificity of 75%.\n\nEthics and dissemination Ethical Review Board approval was obtained. REC reference: 22/LO/0885. Our findings will be disseminated to those involved in eye care services. We will have a knowledge exchange event at the end of the study, published via the Health Technology Assessment web page and in specialist journals. The results will be presented at professional conferences and directly to patients via patient group meetings and the Glaucoma UK charity.\n\nTrial registration number [ISRCTN15115867][1].\n\n [1]: /external-ref?link_type=ISRCTN&access_num=ISRCTN15115867",

        "text": "Study design\n\nACE is a prospective, cross-sectional, multicentre, diagnostic accuracy study of people referred to HES with suspected angle closure. Study setting is secondary care, HES.\n\nSampling and data collection will be carried out prospectively. Consecutive eligible patients will be approached to take part in the study (figure 1). Patients referred to HES with suspected angle closure will be approached and those who consent will undergo testing with the two non-contact technologies (index tests) on the same day. Patients will undergo AS-OCT (with any device available at the site) and the images of the temporal and nasal angle will be sent to a reading centre for interpretation. Interpretation of AS-OCT will use reference images and the investigator will determine if the angle is closed (ie, contact between peripheral iris and trabecular meshwork at one or both quadrants), open or indeterminate. In addition the investigator will grade the angle opening (<10 degrees, 10–20 degrees or >degrees) using reference images. The LACD will be performed and graded by a hospital optometrist (masked to the AS-OCT and to the reference standard). The investigator will use reference images to determine if the angle is closed (ie, contact between peripheral iris and cornea), open or indeterminate. The investigator will also grade the angle opening according to a 7-point scale proposed by Foster et al, using reference images.12 Patients will then receive the reference standard (gonioscopy), provided by an expert who will be masked to the evaluated tests (LACD and AS-OCT). The expert will be an ophthalmologist with glaucoma expertise and will judge if the angle is open or closed. Masked ophthalmologists, optometrists and trained photographers/imaging technicians will interpret AS-OCTs images provided by the reading centre at a different time.\n\nPrior to the study recruitment we will meet clinicians and investigators at each study site to review and agree on the reference standard and interpretation of tests.\n\nInclusion criteria\n\nAdults (≥18 years) referred from community optometry to HES with suspected angle closure, with or without additional comorbidity.\n\nExclusion criteria\n\nUnable to provide informed consent; unable to undergo a slit-lamp examination.\n\nThe primary outcome is sensitivity and specificity of the non-contact tests to detect angle-closure. Reference standard is gonioscopy by an ophthalmologist with glaucoma expertise.\n\nSecondary outcomes\n\nPositive/negative likelihood ratios, concordance, cost-effectiveness, proportion of patients requiring subsequent clinical assessment by ophthalmologist, proportion of patients unable to undergo tests and of tests of inadequate quality.\n\nRecruitment of study participants\n\nPotential patients will be identified through referral letters from optometrists to HES. Potential patients with possible angle closure will be approached before they come for their routine clinical appointment, by phone or via an invitation letter.\n\nPrior to the initiation of the study, training will be provided to the investigators on the interpretation and grading of the tests (AS-OCT, LACD, gonioscopy) via a web-based teaching module on AS-OCT images and LACD interpretation.\n\nThe optometrists performing the LACD test will be masked to gonioscopy. Optometrists, ophthalmic photographers/imaging technicians and ophthalmologists interpreting patients’ images will be masked to the reference standard.\n\nOphthalmologists performing the gonioscopic evaluation will also be masked to the optometrist LACD test result and to the AS-OCT test, including the findings/decisions made by the optometrists, ophthalmic photographers/imaging technicians and ophthalmologists (who will be reviewing the images at a later date). At the same visit participants will be asked to complete a health status questionnaire, European Quality of Life - five dimension - five level (EQ-5D-5L).13 The schedule of assessments is described in online supplemental appendix 1.\n\nSupplemental material\n\nData collection and management\n\nThe chief investigator (CI) and the Northern Ireland Clinical Trials Unit (NICTU) will provide training to site staff on trial processes and procedures, including the completion of the case report form (CRF) and data collection. Monitoring during the trial will check the accuracy of entries on CRF’s against the source documents, the adherence to the protocol, procedures and Good Clinical Practice (GCP), as outlined in the trial monitoring plan.\n\nQuality control is implemented by the NICTU in the form of standard operating procedures, which are defined to encompass aspects of the clinical data management process and to ensure standardisation and adherence to International Conference of Harmonisation GCP guidelines and regulatory requirements.\n\nData validation will be implemented and discrepancy reports will be generated following data entry to identify discrepancies such as out of range, inconsistencies or protocol deviations based on data validation checks programmed in the clinical trial database.\n\nTo ensure accurate, complete and reliable data are collected, the NICTU will provide training to site staff either through investigator meetings or site initiation visits.\n\nAll data for an individual patient will be collected by the principal investigator (PI) or designee and recorded in source documents and/or the CRF for the study. The EQ-5D-5L questionnaires will be completed by the patient. Patient identification on the CRF and questionnaires will be through their unique trial identifier, allocated at the time of recruitment.\n\nCRFs and questionnaires are to be submitted to the NICTU as per the CRF submission schedule.\n\nIn addition to the data specified in the sections above, the following information will be obtained and recorded in the appropriate CRF:\n\nThe time the patient spent with a photographer/imaging technician to complete the AS-OCT images, the time the patient spent with the optometrist to complete the LACD test and time the patient spent with the ophthalmologist to complete the gonioscopic examination. This information will be obtained in a consecutive group of patients until saturation is reached.\n\nThe time required by the optometrist, the ophthalmic photographer/imaging technician and the ophthalmologist to interpret the images and to determine whether there is angle closure or not.\n\nScores obtained in the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L) filled in by patients and collected at the study visit, which will provide utility data for different health states.\n\nResource use data will be collected to explore the costs of delivering the standard care pathway and the new proposed triage pathway and to find the key cost drivers.\n\nTrial management arrangements\n\nThe CI will have overall responsibility for the conduct of the study. The NICTU will undertake trial management including all clinical trial applications (Ethics and Research Governance), site initiation and training, monitoring and reports to ethics, Sponsor and Funder. The trial coordinator will be responsible on a day-to-day basis for overseeing and coordinating the work of the multidisciplinary trial team, and will be the main contact between the trial team and other parties involved. Before the trial starts, site training will take place to ensure that all relevant essential documents and trial supplies are in place and that site staff are fully aware of the trial protocol and procedures. The NICTU will assist and facilitate in the setting up and coordination of the trial committees.\n\nTrial Management Group\n\nA Trial Management Group (TMG) will be established and Chaired by the CI. The TMG will include representation from the NICTU and other investigators or collaborators who are involved in the study and provide trial specific expertise (eg, trial statistician, health economist). This group will have responsibility for the day-to-day operational management of the trial. Regular meetings of the TMG will be held to discuss and monitor progress. The discussions of the TMG will be formally minuted and a record kept in the Trial Master File. A TMG charter will be drawn up to detail the terms of reference of the TMG, including roles and responsibilities of the members.\n\nTrial Steering Committee\n\nThe conduct of the trial will be overseen by an independent Trial Steering Committee (TSC). Throughout the study, the TSC will take responsibility for monitoring and guiding overall progress, scientific standards, operational delivery and protecting the rights and safety of patients enrolled in the study. The TSC will include an independent statistician, a health economist, at least two independent clinicians and a patient representative. The CI will attend the TSC meetings. Representatives of the Sponsor, Funder and the NICTU may attend TSC meetings as observers and at the discretion of the Chair. The TSC Charter will outline the terms of reference of the TSC including roles and responsibilities, membership, organisation of meetings (including frequency), reporting, decision-making and the relationship with the other trial committees.\n\nData Monitoring and Ethics Committee\n\nThe main role of the Data Monitoring and Ethics Committee (DMEC) will be to monitor the trial data and make recommendations to the TSC on whether there are any ethical or safety reasons why the trial should not continue. The DMEC will include a researcher, a statistician and a clinician. Attendance at DMEC meetings by non-members will be at the discretion of the Chair. The primary DMEC reporting line will be via the Chair to the TSC. The DMEC Charter will outline the terms of reference of the DMEC including roles and responsibilities, membership, organisation of meetings (including frequency), reporting, decision-making and the relationship with the other trial committees.\n\nStatistical considerations\n\nSample size\n\nWe will recruit 600 individuals who have been referred with suspected angle closure from primary care (community optometry). According to our feasibility work, we estimate that approximately half of these 600 individuals will have angle closure and that half will not have it. Angle closure is typically a bilateral disease, and, thus, the majority of individuals will have similar angle characteristics in both eyes but, in the rare case of an individual having angle closure in only one eye, they will be considered to have angle closure.\n\nPrevious studies have shown that using a cut-off to capture 90% sensitivity corresponds to a specificity of around 75% with AS-OCT or with LACD.14–16 Therefore the study will have a 95% probability of detecting the true sensitivity of either test to within ±3.5% (ie, the CI for the true sensitivity would be approximately 7% points in width), based on a sensitivity of 90%. The study would also have a 95% probability of detecting the true specificity of either test to within ±5% (ie, the CI for the true specificity would be 10% in width), assuming a true specificity of 75%. These sample sizes are conservative because they are based on using only one eye per person, while in practice, as described below, information from both eyes will be used.\n\nStatistical analysis\n\nSensitivity and specificity will be calculated using data from both eyes, CIs will then be calculated using variance inflation factors to account for the lack of independence of each eye in the same person (using the svy function in Stata).17 Primary analysis will be based on a binary result, closed or not closed. A sensitivity analysis will be conducted calculating test performance measures using a multilevel logistic regression model, with eyes nested within person and person as a random effect. We will extend this model to include the site and operator of the various tests to explore the impact these have on the width of the CIs for sensitivity and specificity.\n\nSecondary analyses will be conducted investigating different degrees of angle closure (on LACD and AS-OCT). Initially, a cut-off will be selected to obtain a sensitivity of 90% and the resulting specificity will be determined. We will explore the diagnostic accuracy of combining both tests (LACD and AS-OCT), and of using different thresholds for a positive result. We will also compare the diagnostic accuracy of AS-OCT images interpreted by optometrists, photographers/imaging technicians and ophthalmologists.\n\nHealth economics analysis\n\nWe will evaluate LACD and AS-OCT as part of a triage test to diagnose angle closure in patients referred to HES with possible glaucoma.\n\nWe propose to use a Markov model to assess the longer-term costs and effects of alternate diagnostic pathways. We propose to run this over an expected lifetime horizon. We propose to adapt a model developed and published by members of the study team.18 The model comprises six states—normal vision, suspected glaucoma, glaucoma without blindness, glaucoma-related unilateral blindness, glaucoma-related bilateral blindness and death. Accurate testing may delay progression, through earlier identification and treatment. Transition probabilities, costs and outcomes (beyond those observed in the trial) associated with the various states will be taken from the literature, supplemented where appropriate with expert opinion and uncertainty explored using sensitivity analyses.\n\nThree tests will be used in the study\n\nGonioscopy as reference standard; LACD; AS-OCT and concordant LACD/AS-OCT results as triage tests. Three comparison groups will be created based on data collected: (1) comparison of gonioscopy versus LACD only; (2) comparison of gonioscopy versus AS-OCT only; and (3) comparison of gonioscopy versus LACD and AS-OCT concordant responses. The proportion of accurate diagnoses across modalities using gonioscopy as reference standard will provide a measure of effect and the differences in these will provide a measure of the incremental effect.\n\nAn NHS healthcare perspective will be used to evaluate cost-effectiveness. For the cost-utility analysis, EQ-5D-5L data will also be gathered at baseline and provide the ‘starting point’ against which subsequent decrements in HRQOL arising from deteriorating vision will be compared. The trajectory of HRQOL after ‘normal vision’ will be based on estimates from a systematic review of the literature for the health states specified in the Markov model. As HRQOL will vary based on age and time spent in a given state, adjustments for these will be made to reflect changes associated with cohort ageing over repeated cycles of the model up to termination (death) for all members.\n\nA similar approach will be adopted with respect to costs. In both cases a survey of experts will be used to address gaps in estimates and one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analysis will be used to explore uncertainty in such estimates. It is anticipated that cycle length will be 1 year.\n\nThe alternative test arrangements will have differential costs associated with them—for example, gonioscopy for all referrals likely being more expensive than those triaged based on LACD only or LACD only being less expensive than those triaged on a combination of LACD and AS-OCT. They may also have differential effects in terms of identification for further investigation and treatment. While we anticipate false negatives/positives will be identified quickly without adverse health effects, the model will allow us to examine differential costs over a hypothetical lifetime for the cohort as well as to explore scenarios in which delayed identification does result in adverse effects.\n\nIncremental quality-adjusted life year (QALYs) and costs will be estimated for cohorts across triage and gonioscopy tests and expressed in terms of cost per QALY gain. Uncertainty around the threshold willingness to pay for a QALY will be explored using cost-effectiveness acceptability curves. Costs and outcomes will be discounted at 3.5% per annum as per current National Institute for health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidance (https://www.nice.org.uk/process/pmg6/chapter/assessing-cost-effectiveness). Subgroup analyses will examine potential differences in ICERs (Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratios) across groups differentiated by age at screening sex and ethnic groups. Reporting of results will adhere to revised-Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards checklist and the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR) modelling good practice.19"
