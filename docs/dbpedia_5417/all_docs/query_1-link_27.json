Interest in reducing surgical morbidity has led to the introduction of minimally invasive glaucoma surgeries (MIGS). Understanding the comparative effectiveness and safety of MIGS is necessary for clinicians and patients. Objective: To summarize data from randomized clinical trials of MIGS for open-angle glaucoma, which were evaluated in a suite of Cochrane reviews. Data Sources: The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews including studies published before June 1, 2021. Study Selection: Reviews of randomized clinical trials comparing MIGS with cataract extraction alone, other MIGS, traditional glaucoma surgery, laser trabeculoplasty, or medical therapy. Data Extraction and Synthesis: Data were extracted according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses guidelines by one investigator and confirmed by a second. Methodologic rigor was assessed using the AMSTAR 2 appraisal tool and random-effects network meta-analyses were conducted. Main Outcomes and Measures: The proportion of participants who did not need to use medication to reduce intraocular pressure (IOP) postsurgery (drop-free). Outcomes were analyzed at short-term (<6 months), medium-term (6-18 months), and long-term (>18 months) follow-up. Results: Six eligible Cochrane reviews were identified discussing trabecular bypass with iStent or Hydrus microstents, ab interno trabeculotomy with Trabectome, subconjunctival and supraciliary drainage devices, and endoscopic cyclophotocoagulation. Moderate certainty evidence indicated that adding a Hydrus safely improved the likelihood of drop-free glaucoma control at medium-term (relative risk [RR], 1.6; 95% CI, 1.4 to 1.8) and long-term (RR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.4 to 1.9) follow-up and conferred 2.0-mm Hg (95% CI, -2.7 to -1.3 mm Hg) greater IOP reduction at long-term follow-up, compared with cataract surgery alone. Adding an iStent also safely improved drop-free disease control compared with cataract surgery alone (RR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.2 to 1.6), but the short-term IOP-lowering effect of the iStent was not sustained. Addition of a CyPass microstent improved drop-free glaucoma control compared with cataract surgery alone (RR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.1 to 1.5) but was associated with an increased risk of vraision loss. Network meta-analyses supported the direction and magnitude of these results. Conclusions and Relevance: Based on data synthesized in Cochrane reviews, some MIGS may afford patients with glaucoma greater drop-free disease control than cataract surgery alone. Among the products currently available, randomized clinical trial data associate the Hydrus with greater drop-free glaucoma control and IOP lowering than the iStent; however, these effect sizes were small..\n\nTY - JOUR\n\nT1 - Minimally Invasive Glaucoma Surgical Techniques for Open-Angle Glaucoma\n\nT2 - An Overview of Cochrane Systematic Reviews and Network Meta-analysis\n\nAU - Bicket, Amanda K.\n\nAU - Le, Jimmy T.\n\nAU - Azuara-Blanco, Augusto\n\nAU - Gazzard, Gus\n\nAU - Wormald, Richard\n\nAU - Bunce, Catey\n\nAU - Hu, Kuang\n\nAU - Jayaram, Hari\n\nAU - King, Anthony\n\nAU - Otárola, Francisco\n\nAU - Nikita, Eleni\n\nAU - Shah, Anupa\n\nAU - Stead, Richard\n\nAU - Tóth, Márta\n\nAU - Li, Tianjing\n\nN1 - Funding Information: reported receiving grants from W.
