        "text": "1. Introduction\n\nIndividuals who migrate between Mexico and the United States often do so in response to capital constraints, as sending areas often have nonexistent, malfunctioning, or inefficient credit and capital markets (Lindstrom, 1996; Lindstrom and Lauster, 2001; Massey and Espinosa, 1997). For many households, the temporary U.S.-bound migration of one or more members serves as a way to acquire human capital, purchase land and inputs, build a home, or start a business in their home communities (Durand et al., 1996; Ilahi, 1999; Massey and Parrado, 1994; Massey and Parrado, 1998). Starting a business venture is of particular importance, as it is through productive activities that individuals have the clearest impact on the economic well-being of their households, sending areas, and, ultimately nations (Massey and Parrado, 1994; Taylor et al., 1996a; Taylor et al., 1996b).\n\nPrevious studies have found that return migrants are indeed more likely than their nonmigrant peers to start (generally micro- and small) business enterprises (Dustmann and Kirchkamp, 2002; Ilahi, 1999; Massey and Parrado, 1998), and to keep these ventures more profitable (Woodruff and Zenteno, 2007). Most of these studies, however, have not examined whether businesses started by “migrant households” (i.e., by return migrants themselves or, less commonly, by their relatives using the money migrants remit) are disproportionately located in the formal or informal sector (i.e., if businesses are registered, comply with regulation, and pay taxes, fees, and worker fringe benefits). This distinction is relevant to consider given that the sector location of economic activity may have different development implications (e.g., in terms of local multiplier effects (Arias et al 2010; Massey & Parrado 1998; Massey & Parrado 1994). As such, migration could be contributing to development in different ways and at different levels depending on the sector businesses started by migrants are located in.\n\nIn this paper, we look at the association between migration and business formation in Mexican urban locales using a multidimensional classification of the degree of formality-informality of a venture based on several correlates of sector location using (some) factors previously identified for the Mexican case by Tokman (1992).1 We study urban areas because more formal economic participation takes place in them (Arias et al., 2010; Grindle, 1988; Itzigsohn, 2006; Tokman, 1992), and as it is less problematic to attempt a classification of formal and informal ventures in these settings with the measures available to us. We use multilevel survival analysis techniques on a sample of 56 Mexican urban communities from the Mexican Migration Project (MMP), located in eighteen states and four regions, thereby expanding the geographic focus of prior studies, which mostly studied these decisions in places located in more “traditional” migrant-sending regions (e.g., Massey and Parrado, 1998: ). This broader geographic coverage is relevant given the steady expansion of Mexican migration outside its Historical heartland in Central-Western Mexico over the last three decades (Durand and Massey, 2003; Durand et al., 2001).\n\nTable 1\n\nFormalInformalAllMean (S.D.)Mean (S.D.)Mean (S.D.)Business type (REF = Trade [store/middleman])21.8% (4.7%)44.6% (6.7%)42.2% (6.5%) Street vendor0.8% (0.9%)20.7% (4.5%)18.6% (4.3%) Workshop/Factory17.7% (4.2%)11.6% (3.4%)12.2% (3.5%) Restaurants5.6% (2.4%)4.1% (2.0%)4.2% (2.1%) Personal and other services7.3% (2.7%)12.8% (3.6%)12.2% (3.5%) Professional services33.9% (5.8%)0.0% (0.0%)3.6% (1.9%) Primary sector (agriculture, cattle raising)5.6% (2.4%)2.1% (1.4%)2.5% (1.6%) Other7.3% (2.7%)4.2% (2.0%)4.5% (2.1%)No. of family workers3.0 (3.0)1.5 (0.9)1.6 (1.1)No. of nonfamily workers2.6 (5.3)0.3 (0.7)0.5 (1.2)Percent with no nonfamily workers > no. family workers34.0% (5.8%)7.0% (2.6%)9.8% (28.2%)Percent with more than 5 workers58.9% (7.6%)0.3% (0.5%)6.4% (23.7%)Percent financed with migradollars9.7% (3.1%)12.0% (3.5%)11.8% (30.3%)Other financing source (REF = Savings)74.2% (22.2%)86.5% (12.5%)84.0% (14.7%) Bank loan15.3% (33.1%)0.3% (5.3%)1.8% (13.2%) Loan from friends/family5.7% (22.4%)7.6% (25.5%)7.5% (25.3%) Other4.8% (20.9%)5.6% (22.3%)6.7% (24.2%)N1241,0551,179\n\nWhile previous work has shown that households are able to overcome capital constraints (or acquire the human capital useful for) starting a business through migration (Massey and Parrado, 1998), particularly in economically dynamic sending areas (cf., Lindstrom, 1996), this research aims to contribute to the migration and development literature by assessing if migrant households are disproportionately likely to start informal businesses only, or if they are also more likely to start businesses (likely) located in the formal sector. We also examine if migration reduces capital constraints allowing migrants to use money saved during their stay in the U.S. to start businesses shortly after returning to their sending communities and according to their level of migration experience. At the end of the paper, we speculate if patterns of migrant business formation according to time after return and U.S. experience could further provide clues into whether remittances and savings from migration help ease capital constraints only, or if an individual may be accruing human capital that could become relevant for business formation during his/her experience abroad.\n\nFurther, the sector in which people start a business may depend on the (regulation and) investment climate in sending areas (Durand et al., 1996; Feldman, 2001; Lindstrom, 1996; Massey and Parrado, 1994; Massey and Parrado, 1998), as signaled for instance by the variation in informal sector activity across Mexican locales (Arias et al. 2010). As such, we also examine if the association between migration and business formation varies according to community characteristics used in prior work as indicators of economic dynamism (e.g., Lindstrom and Lauster 2001). Finally, although previous work has stressed the implications of business registration regulations and macroeconomic shocks and policies on sector location, we examine which household and community factors are associated with formal versus informal business creation, a relatively underdeveloped theme in the literature considering the considerable growth of informality in the latter half of the twentieth century (de Soto, 2000), while paying particular attention to the differences between the determinants of sector participation between migrants and nonmigrants.\n\n3. Data and methods\n\n3.1. Data\n\nWe use retrospective household and community-level data from the Mexican Migration Project (MMP) supplemented with municipal-level data from the 1970–2000 Mexican Population and Housing Censuses gathered by the Mexican Institute of Statistics and Geography (INEGI). The MMP, a collaborative effort between researchers at Princeton University and the University of Guadalajara, collects wide-ranging multilevel social, economic, and demographic data with particular focus on migration to the United States. As of this writing, the MMP has collected data (once and only once) in 128 different Mexican communities, the first four in 1982 (Massey et al. 1987) and the rest between 1987 and 2009, surveying between 4 and 6 new communities each year.\n\nAlthough the communities visited by the MMP were not explicitly selected for their high migration intensities, they all have at least some level of migration. Beyond the likely under-representation of communities with none to very low levels of U.S. migration, MMP researchers have chosen communities with varying socioeconomic conditions and degrees of urbanization (Massey and Capoferro, 2004). While MMP communities were mostly concentrated in Central-Western Mexico during the first few years of data collection, since the late 1990s the sample has increasingly included places in the Borderlands and south and east of Mexico city (Massey and Capoferro, 2004),4 in response to the changing geography of migrant origins (Durand and Massey, 2003; Durand et al., 2001). Before this expansion, despite the nonrandom selection of communities, the characteristics of MMP migrants were very similar to those obtained from the Mexican National Survey of Population Dynamics (ENADID), a nationally and state-wide representative sample of households (Massey and Capoferro, 2004; Zenteno and Massey, 1999).\n\nDespite its lack of national or regional representativeness, one of the MMP’s main strengths is that it combines a large and varied set of places and is a representative sample of (most) of each of these communities. MMP fieldworkers canvassed each community (except in larger cities, where specific sections of the city or neighborhoods were chosen), selected a simple random sample of around 200 households, and interviewed them with a semistructured survey instrument known as the ethnosurvey (Massey and Capoferro, 2004).5\n\nThe ethnosurvey instrument contains socioeconomic information on the household, importantly including business and property histories, along with basic sociodemographic information and the migration histories of all household members. Because of the detailed migratory histories collected by the MMP (especially for the household head, for whom we have migration timing information for every U.S. trip), the data allow for the exploration of how migration experience and duration since return are associated with business formation. Further, migration and business formation processes are both embedded in time, making the MMP an adequate data source to analyze their complex relationship. As some items relevant for the analysis (e.g., business formation histories) were included only in communities surveyed after 1998, we use data on 56 urban communities surveyed since that year, with a median refusal rate of 4.7% in these places. This selection of communities, ranging from large towns to neighborhoods in a couple of large metropolitan areas, yielded a total of 9,460 households, located in 18 states.\n\n3.2. Methods\n\nWe used the retrospective business formation and migration histories to estimate discrete-time multilevel survival models (see Barber et al., 2000) predicting the probability that a household starts a new formal or informal business in year t as a function of a set of household, community, and municipality characteristics in year t – 1. We study household-level decisions because businesses, especially those in the informal sector, are a household- (and family-wide) venture that relies on the labor of various household members (Massey and Parrado, 1998; Tokman, 1992). Likewise, the migration decision of one of the household members (in the Mexican setting, typically the household head) is made with the active engagement and collaboration (or despite the opposition) of other household members (Aysa and Massey, 2004; Hondagneu-Sotelo, 1994).\n\nBecause the MMP sampling procedure clusters households within communities, and community characteristics are relevant to U.S. migration processes (Lindstrom and Lauster, 2001; Massey and Espinosa, 1997; Riosmena, 2009) and to business formation in the context of market failure (Durand et al., 1996; Massey and Parrado, 1994; Massey and Parrado, 1998; Stark and Bloom, 1985), we use a (bi-level) random effects model that adjusts standard errors for the clustering at the community level and provides estimates conditional on the community-wide random effects (Luke, 2004). We find this choice appropriate empirically, as the Median Odds Ratios (MOR) of null, or naïve, models without any covariates predicting both informal and formal businesses are high (1.84 and 2.02 respectively).6 Multilevel models also allow for a statistically appropriate estimation of cross-level interactions. This is a useful property given our interest in also assessing whether the effect of migration on informal and business formation varies according to the economic dynamism of the sending community.\n\nGiven that the MMP data record only the year of occurrence of an event, a relatively coarse timing measure, we use a discrete time approximation by estimating multilevel logistic regressions predicting informal/formal vs. no business (using Stata’s xtmelogit procedure) on a set of pseudo-observations for each year before the creation of a business or the survey year (whichever comes first; see Singer and Willett, 2003). To test whether the determinants of informal and formal business initiation are similar, we also estimate (nonmultilevel) multinomial models predicting the competing risks of formal vs. informal vs. no business formation and present the results for the formal vs. informal contrast only.7 To analyze household with migratory history compared to those without we also ran multinomial models for migrants and non-migrant households comparing formal to informal businesses.\n\nAs retrospective data such as these are subject to a series of memory recall biases (Smith and Thomas, 2003), we observe households starting at 15 years before the survey year (or the initiation of the current union of the household head, whichever occurs first)8 and censor them after the start of a business or at the survey year, whichever occurs first. In the case of business formation, we also note a change in the dependent variable. We estimate separate models predicting the initiation of formal and informal businesses respectively, in addition to a multinomial (i.e., competing risk) model in which we compare the divergent determinants of formal vis-à-vis informal business formation.\n\n3.3. Variable definitions\n\nThe business histories in the MMP do not include explicit questions about licensing, tax, or benefit contributions that would allow for a more straightforward identification of sector location. We therefore use four criteria following principles previously proposed by Tokman (1992) in the Mexican setting. First, informal businesses are much more likely to employ family members. Second, businesses with more employees are likelier to be formal (since they are less able to avoid regulation and more able to afford compliance with it; see Arias et al., 2010; Tokman, 1992). Third, businesses capitalized with a bank loan are very likely to be in the formal sector, as banks will not generally accept the higher risk of lending to informal businesses (Tokman, 1992, p. 66). In addition to these proposed by Tokman, we add a fourth: businesses without a fixed location should be less likely to be formal.\n\nFollowing these principles, which are also congruent with International Labor Organization’s (ILO) criteria (Hussmanns, 2004), we classify all businesses as informal if they involve street vending and were not initiated with a bank loan or: (1) were not initiated with a bank loan; (2) did not provide professional or technical services; and (3) employed fewer than five people (also see for a flowchart of this classification).9 Note that Tokman (1992) places the formal size cutoff at fewer than 15 workers. Our less conservative criteria, which aim to identify more formal and less informal microenterprises, reflect the generally small size of firms in our data. We discuss the implications and limitations of this predominance of microenterprises in the Conclusions section.\n\nThis classification yielded 1,055 informal and 124 formal businesses (see ) representing 1.1% and 0.1% of the total household-years respectively (see ). Although the percentage of households with an informal business seems congruent with estimates from other studies using nationally representative data in Mexico, our data include a lower share of formal businesses (Bruhn, 2011; Bruhn and Love, 2009; Schneider, 2002), perhaps as our sample is focused on smaller urban areas, where the share of small and thus informal businesses is larger (Becker, 2004).\n\nTable 2\n\nTotalMigrantsNon-MigrantsHousehold CharacteristicsMean (S.D.)Mean (S.D.)Mean (S.D.)

Both types of businesses were relatively small, with formal businesses averaging just over five workers while informal businesses average fewer than two. Indeed, nearly all informal businesses had fewer than five workers (with the exception of the rare street vending operations with more than five workers), whereas 59% of businesses classified as formal had fewer than five employees. Note that, although four street vending operations were started with a bank loan, our classification still labels them as informal. Finally, note that fewer formal than informal businesses (9.7% versus 12%) were initiated with “migradollars,” money sent or brought back by U.S. migrants. We explore this issue further in our multivariate analyses with more appropriate counterfactuals (i.e., by comparing migrant to nonmigrant business formation).\n\nLike Massey and Parrado (1998), we take as our main independent variable the U.S. migration experience of the household head, as in Mexico most businesses are primarily formed by the financial and human capital contributions of household heads. We differentiate household-years in which the head is still in the U.S., in which the household may be receiving remittances regularly; from those after his/her return, in which s/he may be able to contribute both savings and labor to business ventures. Additionally, we explore cumulative years of international migration experience and years since return from a U.S. migration.\n\nTo isolate the effects of financial, human, and social capital obtained by the household head during his/her experience abroad that could be most likely to have an effect on business formation, we counted household heads as return migrants only during the 10 years after they returned to Mexico from a given migration trip.10 For the sake of brevity, we sometimes refer to households where the head has no current or recent migration experience as “nonmigrant” households, even though other household members may be current or recent migrants or the household head was one more than 10 years prior. As shows, the head is reported to be in the United States in 4.0% of the household-years in the data, while we classify him/her as a return migrant in 19.2% of them. Further, on average, the household head has 0.8 years (9.6 months) of migratory experience and has been back in Mexico for 2.1 years after his/her return; conditional on the head being a migrant, this experience is 3 years of experience with 7.6 years since return.\n\nWe control for other household-level wealth and life-cycle variables that may predict business formation (Massey and Parrado, 1998) in addition to U.S. migration (Massey et al., 1987; Massey and Espinosa 1997; Riosmena, 2009). One of these is the number of residential and nonresidential properties owned during a given household-year. While (formally owned) residential properties can be used as loan collateral and can house a host of (generally informal) businesses, nonresidential properties may be more likely to be directly used for (formal) business activity. In total, about 65% of the households owned a housing property and 1.79% owned an additional residential property, while only 0.2%, already owned properties designed to host businesses (before the formation of a focal business in the data), with 1.4% owning other nonresidential properties. Overall, migrant households have slightly higher wealth levels, especially in terms of owning the dwelling they reside on (70% vs. 64% for nonmigrants). To further control for socioeconomic standing, we include the average level of schooling among all adults in the household, which averages 6.5 years across households in our data, 5.6 among migrant and 6.9 among nonmigrants households.\n\nWe include four variables to adjust for the life-cycle stage of the household, the age of the household head and the presence of one or more children aged 0–4, 5–12, and 13–17. Family life-cycle stage, in particular the presence of teenagers or young adults (and, in some circumstances, children) may signal a higher (unpaid) labor supply available, which can facilitate (informal) business formation (Davis, 2006). Conversely, the presence of infants and young children may impose time demands that complicate either starting a business or migrating. On average, the household heads in our data (during the average household-year, not at the time of the survey) are 43 years-old, with migrant heads slightly older than nonmigrant ones (44.5 vs. 42.8). For the average year in the data, 37%, 51%, and 37% of households have at least one child aged 0–4, 5–12, and 13–17 respectively with similar distribution for migrant and nonmigrant households alike.\n\nWe also control for community-level characteristics indicating the degree of migration and formal and informal local economic opportunity. Using MMP data for all individuals in the household roster, we calculate community-level migration prevalence ratios, defined as the estimated percentage of people aged 15 and over in the community with migration experience in the U.S. before the year in question (for a more detailed methodology on the construction of the variable see Massey et al., 1994). The prevalence ratio is commonly used in the migration literature to assess the magnitude of the sending community’s connections with the United States (for studies using and evaluating the usefulness of the measure, see Fussell, 2004; Lindstrom and López-Ramírez, 2010; Massey et al., 1994). The mean prevalence ratio across communities during the average household-year is 11.8%. Intuitively, households with migratory experience (17.2%) come from communities with higher levels of community migration compared to nonmigrant households (10.5%).\n\nInformal business formation by migrants could reflect the places they hail from and return to. As we note above, migration may occur in response to the types of market failure also associated with a larger informal sector. We control for local economic conditions associated with informal sector activity at the local (municipal) level by supplementing MMP data from the 1970–2000 Mexican Population and Housing Censuses, collected by the National Institute of Statistics, Geography, and Informatics (see www.inegi.gob.mx) and (mostly) available in the MMP community-level files.11\n\nWe use three such indicators. The first, the female labor force participation rate, is regarded as a measure of economic dynamism (e.g., Lindstrom and Lauster, 2001).12 As women make up the majority of informal-sector workers in Mexico, their labor force participation may specifically signal informal economic activity (see below; also see Benería and Roldán, 1987; Cunningham, 2001). The second indicator is the percent of economically active, “occupied” workers in the municipality who are self-employed, a measure that typically includes a large proportion of informal workers. The third is the percent of the economically active population who employ at least one other individual, a measure of economic dynamism and an indicator that should include some degree of formal economic activity. Studies have found that all three of these measures are associated with the likelihood of U.S. migration (Lindstrom and Lauster, 2001; Massey and Espinosa, 1997; Riosmena, 2009) and with migratory trip durations (Lindstrom, 1996). Since the Mexican census is collected only every ten years, we interpolate these measures in the intervening years, assuming that the (average) rate of change in each indicator remained constant between censuses. In the average municipality and household-year in our data, 23.5% of women reported being in the labor force, 25.8% of economically active individuals were self-employed, and 2.4% acted as an employer. Migrant households come from communities with slightly lower levels of female and self-employment and slightly higher levels of employers in the community.\n\nTable 3\n\nA. Formal vs. No BusinessB.

First, we use fixed effects for community size, where 36% reside in large metropolitan areas, 23% in small urban areas, and 41% in towns. Almost 39% of household-years in the sample are located in the historically most active Central-Western region (a.k.a. the Historical region); 25.0% in the northern states (Border region); 24% in the states surrounding Mexico City (Central region); and 12.5% in the Southeastern region (for regional definitions, see Durand and Massey, 2003). As expected given the geography of Mexico-U.S. migration (Durand et al. 2001; Riosmena and Massey 2012), migrant households are disproportionately located out of metropolitan areas and in the Historical region.\n\n5. Conclusions\n\nOur study contributes to the literature on migration and development in several ways. First, we show that the higher entrepreneurship of return migrants in their sending communities observed in prior studies (Massey and Parrado, 1998) remains a feature of the migration process even though return migration dynamics have changed considerably in recent times (Massey et al. 2002; Passel et al. 2012; Reyes 2004; Riosmena 2004). Further, we show how this association is also overall similar in a broader set of communities than those studied in the past, located in both more traditional and emerging migrant-sending regions.\n\nAlthough our sample included newer as well as more traditional sending areas, and our results do hold for migrants returning to Mexico in the 1990s and 2000s, extrapolating them into the future should be done with caution. The migration dynamics of Mexicans have indeed changed substantially in the past two to three decades, with decreasing circular (Cornelius, 1992) and return migration rates (particularly in the short run, Massey et al., 2002; Riosmena, 2004). Although those who migrate to accumulate capital, particularly those leaving economically dynamic areas, may be more likely to have longer trip durations (Lindstrom, 1996); longer stays motivated by factors such as increased border enforcement (Angelucci 2012; Reyes 2004) may not signal the economic motivations of target earners but may increasingly indicate a higher likelihood of settlement and the reunification of families north instead of south of the border (Hondagneu-Sotelo, 1994). Likewise, the recent spike in return migration to Mexico (Passel et al., 2012) could have been a product of both the aftermath of the recession related to the U.S. housing bust and, at least partially, is related to the large number of Mexican citizens being forcibly removed from the country. As such, a large/nontrivial portion of contemporary return migrants may not have a particularly strong motivation to go back to Mexico and form businesses compared to past flows. Future research should thus analyze the implications of the recent global economic crisis and increasing immigration enforcement in the U.S. interior on Mexican (migrant and nonmigrant) microenterprise formation and performance. For reasons like these, we also argue that future research studying the economic effects of return migration should be updated more regularly and should study the transnational linkages which have allowed the formation and upkeep of these businesses.\n\nWe also provide a more precise understanding of the sector location in which migrant entrepreneurship is more likely to take place relative to nonmigrant business formation. Our analyses demonstrate a positive association between migration and business formation, most clearly in the informal sector, by far the most common sector of location of microenterprises in Mexico. Households where the head had with prior U.S. experience, particularly in those where the head had longer tenures in the United States were indeed more likely to initiate informal businesses. Although we find some evidence that the prior migration experience of the head is also positively associated with formal business formation, particularly in more economically dynamic areas with perhaps a stronger formal sector, these differences were either not statistically significant (as in the case of the average effect of migration experience on formal venture creation, as in Column A, Model 1, ); or were only marginally so (as in the interaction between prior migration experience of the household head and the percentage of the active labor force acting as employers in Column A, Model 2, ).\n\nAs such, we can at least conclude that it is highly unlikely that prior migration experience is negatively associated with formal business formation, while it indeed seems to contribute more clearly to entrepreneurship in the informal sector. Although the evidence supporting the role of migration in the formal sector is comparably weak to the evidence supporting the role of migration in the informal sector, also note that we did not find significant differences between the effect of prior migration experience on formal and informal business formation (Column C, ), in all cases could perhaps be due to a lack of power. Prior research showing that microenterprises financed with remittances do seem to be more profitable, partly because migration may have allowed households to start businesses in high-capital (perhaps more formal) sectors (Woodruff and Zenteno, 2007) could further suggest that migration may indeed have a nontrivial role in formal economic activity, though it is perhaps indeed lower than its part in stimulating informal activity.\n\nIn addition to the role of migration (or lack thereof) in explaining differences in the likelihood of starting a formal vs. and informal business, we do find substantially different determinants of formal versus informal business creation. In our analyses, households with greater human and financial capital (measured by schooling levels and owned properties respectively) were more likely to start formal businesses, regardless of migration status, family lifecycle state, and local economic conditions. Conversely, community characteristics were more relevant in predicting informal business creation. Households with lower socioeconomic status may be both aware of and dependent on contextual economic factors and, at any rate, be only able to start informal businesses if at all, particularly in more economically dynamic places with higher opportunities (in the informal sector). Therefore, our study adds to the growing body of research which has illustrated the informal and formal sectors have become increasingly socially stratified over time (Cammack 2009) and points to the potential relevance of context in influencing the sector location of ventures initiated by people with lower socioeconomic standing.\n\nWe recognize that, despite following general criteria identified in previous work (Tokman, 1992), our identification of informal and formal businesses may not be fully accurate. Still, because varying the thresholds to define a formal business numerous times in numerous ways did not affect our substantive results, we do not believe that problems with our criteria undermine our general conclusions, provided that these conclusions are understood as pertaining to (more) formal microenterprises (as opposed to large, medium, or even small ventures). Our findings also have potential implications for understanding the role of context in (migrant and nonmigrant) business formation. As informality is quite prevalent in Mexico and elsewhere (de Soto, 2002; Levy, 2008), return migrants may be simply taking advantage of the opportunity structure available to them, which motivated their migration in the first place. In other words, inaccessible credit markets may motivate migration because financial services are not available to help form (or perhaps even formalize) a business and could loosen this constraints but only to the point of allowing migrant households to start businesses with lower requirements of capital in the informal sector.\n\nOur data are not a representative sample of (urban) Mexico and thus cannot be generalized to the entire country and should be taken as describing the processes prevalent in many urban communities, particularly those in medium-sized urban areas (the MMP sample in metropolitan areas is small and the sampling is less random within them than in large towns and smaller cities). In addition, although the MMP has generally been shown to be representative of Mexican migrants (Massey and Capoferro, 2004; Zenteno and Massey, 1999), it remains unclear how accurate the MMP is regarding the representation of non-migrants.\n\nAs more attention is dedicated to regularizing informal economic activity in Mexico (Arias et al., 2010), policymakers should attempt to reach out to the migrant community both in sending areas and through Consulates in the U.S. Arias and colleagues (2010) assert that the stringent regulation of the Mexican economy forces millions into informality, potentially reducing national economic potential (also see de Soto, 2000). Since return migrants are clearly an entrepreneurial and risk taking group, they may be more accepting of the risks associated with formalization. Efforts to facilitate formal economic registration and participation (or, less likely, crackdowns on informal businesses) might reduce the degree of informality in these communities. If these efforts also included loans such as microfinancing that does not necessitate hefty collateral leveraging, some individuals might decide not only to start and register a business in the formal sector but also remain in their home communities, a goal some policymakers in both the United States and Mexico find desirable, particularly when it pertains to unauthorized migration.\n\nThis, however, depends on the motivations behind migration and migrant business formation. On the one hand, our results are overall consistent with the New Economics of Labor Migration (NELM) theory (Stark and Bloom, 1985) and with other empirical studies (generally adopting this view) arguing that migration is an ex ante strategy to overcome the combination of capital constraints and credit market inefficiency (e.g., Lindstrom 1996; Massey and Parrado, 1998). This is of course particularly salient for the creation of informal businesses, which are rarely capitalized by bank loans and where, in fact, market failures could play a role in sector location.18\n\nYet, our results are also consistent with the idea that return migrants could be starting businesses in response to circumstances arising during or after the migration itself. For instance, migration experience may help individuals to accumulate specific types of human capital, providing them with skill and motivating or allowing them to mobilize critical social capital upon their return (Ma, 2002). For instance, the positive effect of migration experience on informal business creation found in our study (see Column B, Model 2, ) could signal the relevance of human capital accumulation in the United States. Yet, migration experience (i.e., trip durations) should also be correlated with the amount of financial resources accumulated by migrants during their experience abroad (Lindstrom 1996). As such, our study suggests both motivations could be at play. Though we find perhaps the capital constraint explanation to be more plausible and compelling (as other scholars have), this remains an unanswered (and perhaps elusive) empirical question.\n\nTo boot, informal business creation could be an ex post response by some individuals to the difficulty of reinsertion in the labor markets of sending areas upon return. This motivation is likely contributing (but not solely explaining) our findings on the positive effect of duration since return on the likelihood of (informal) business creation (see Column B, Model 2, ). Notwithstanding this initial speculation, a more nuanced understanding of when is business formation (and return migration more in general) a more ex ante vs. ex post strategy is required (see also Lindstrom et al. 2012) and seems particularly well suited for future qualitative research and for the collection and use of longitudinal data. Specific attention should also be paid to the migration of other household members aside from the household head and if their migration leads to the formation of informal or formal businesses.\n\nBy providing estimates of the role of migration on informal and more formal business creation, and on the role of local economic conditions in mediating these associations, our study also contributes more broadly to our understanding of the role of migration on development. Although most of the businesses formed by return migrants are indeed informal and small, it would be incorrect to assume that migration does not to contribute much to local development due to the economic multipliers of migradollars in general, especially those devoted to productive activities like those studied here, and even in sectors likely to include a nontrivial informal component (c.f. Massey and Parrado, 1994; Taylor et al. 1996). Therefore, even though migrants mostly form informal businesses, the implications for their household, community, and (to a lesser extent) national economic growth may be nontrivial, though perhaps less substantial than if their formal sector participation was higher, which we argue is highly contingent on context (see ) and endogenous to the migration decision itself (Lindstrom 1996).\n\nGiven that the role of migration indeed seems to be different in informal and formal sectors (and across places), more research should examine the complex linkages between migration, business formation, sector location, and local development (and, in the end, the potential and limits of migration to contribute to development). For instance, the importance of the economic conditions of the community of origin for business formation may also explain why migration has higher economic multipliers in some communities while others only become dependent on remittances (e.g., Jones 1998), a process known as the “migrant syndrome.” More diverse and economically independent communities seem to be more likely to see migradollars invested in businesses, while those worse off could become increasingly dependent on these migradollars as a source of income that is not invested and, thus, does not generate substantial economic multipliers.\n\nNotwithstanding and maybe due to the existence of some extremes, migradollars are often depicted as being passively consumed rather than actively invested (World Bank, 2006). Indeed, most remittances are not spent in necessarily productive activities (e.g., Durand et al., 1996; Massey and Parrado, 1994; Taylor et al., 1996). This is, however, the wrong counterfactual to evaluate the role of migration in development, as return migrant households do seem to devote a larger portion of their income, wealth, and time to productive activities than nonmigrants. Migrants’ private incomes have been scrutinized more intensely than those of most other social groups (Lozano Ascencio, 2003). By the same token, researchers and policymakers should ask similar questions about whether other social groups and institutions are reaching their potential to contribute to local and national economic development, as scholars have done, for instance, with regard to the wealth flows of commodity chains (Bair, 2005)."
