        "text": "These are some of the several areas in Divorce and Family Law we deal with at Azuara & Baviera Advocats.\n\nMarriage crisis, separation and divorce\n\nLegal separation consists of an authorisation granted to a couple by a judge so that they can separate, but without dissolving the marriage – neither party can remarry.\n\nDivorce means an end to the marriage and to cohabitation – both parties can remarry. You can request a divorce without the prior need for legal separation.\n\nModification of measures set out in agreements and judgements\n\nThe law provides for the possibility that court orders, which have been authorised during a divorce proceeding, such as: maintenance, pension rights, compensation benefits, custody of minors, use of housing, etc., can be modified by a subsequent judgement, if a person’s circumstances have changed sufficiently to warrant it.\n\nPrenuptial and postnuptial agreements\n\nOur law allows spouses to determine the rules by which they govern their marriage, including the consequences of a hypothetical separation and divorce. However, in our country this process is rarely used, unlike in many other countries where this type of regulation of financial issues is common.\n\nStable and cohabiting couples\n\nThe Codi Civil de Catalunya (Catalan Civil Law) treats the separation of stable and cohabiting couples in much the same way as it does for the divorce of married couples. The CCC considers a couple to be in a stable relationship if they have lived together for two years or more, have a child or children together or have formalised their relationship with a legal agreement.\n\nParent-child relationships\n\nThe current law in Spain provides certain rights and obligations to people who have a parent-child relationship. In some cases this relationship can be challenged and in others there is a need to urge recognition.\n\nPower of attorney\n\nThe aim of the power of attorney procedure is the protection of a person whose mental or physical abilities do not enable them to represent themselves. The court’s decision can include appointing a guardian, legal defence or an assistant.\n\nFinancial matters as a consequence of separation\n\nOur experience over the years has shown us that most conflicts arising from separation and divorce are more focused on financial matters rather than on disputes related to the children. However, children are occasionally affected indirectly as a result of financial disputes between parents.\n\nWe are experts on financial matters as a consequence of separation and we know how to negotiate and when it’s necessary to go to trial. Our clients know that they are in good hands – they feel secure and supported."
