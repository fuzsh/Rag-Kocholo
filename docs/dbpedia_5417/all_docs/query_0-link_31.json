        "text": "Is Haiti a part of Latin/Hispanic Heritage Month? This is a genuine question. As a Haitian-American, I‚Äôve seen my paternal homeland excluded from countless conversations about Black history, international empanications, spirituality, and more. While Haiti isn‚Äôt a Spanish-speaking country (thus not a Hispanic country), it is the least recognized country in Latin America. In a way, this further ostracizes Haiti from its community of neighbors for not being seen as ‚Äúwhite enough‚Äù for the USA or Canada, ‚Äúnative enough‚Äù though Ayiti is literally a Taino word (no, the colonizers didn‚Äôt kill off all the natives in our country though they tried), and ‚Äútoo Black‚Äù to be Latin (which is a struggle for most Afro-Latin people I know). Basically, I want to know if there‚Äôs space for Haitian writers, stories, and perspectives in Latin/Hispanic Heritage Month. I mean, if Brazilian writers get their voices heard then we should, too, right? üëÄ #editor #latinhistorymonth #hispanicheritagemonth #freelancewriter\n\nIdentity is a complex construction of what makes an individual, and this complexity reaches a whole new level for us, humans from colonized territories. We carry in our beings so many different races, ethnicities, and cultures that trying to label it is not only insulting but also will inevitably leave a part of us out - especially because they never come from us, right? Not to mention that these labels are often weaponized to foment discrimination and weaken the groups by taking them apart. A perfect example of that? \"Hispanic\". Hispanic is a label created by the U.S. Census in the '60s - '70s to identify and quantify different groups of people - before, everyone was just \"Mexicans.\" Yet, Hispanic\" is \"a person whose cultural traditions originate from Spain,\" and well... we have centuries of pre-Columbian history; we have folks who speak Portuguese, French, Creole, and other languages instead of Spanish; We have Afro-Latinx; we have Asians; We have Brown, Black, White; Perhaps Latinx still isn't THE perfect term, but it definitely is an improvement. So, please, do as Mariana says: If you want to celebrate us, celebrate ALL OF US.\n\nüéâHappy Latinx/Hispanic Heritage Month! Always such a wonderful month for expanding our knowledge and advocacy. Plus I love that this \"month\" is so unique by starting mid-September and going to mid-October. Some may be torn about having \"months\" or \"weeks\" or \"days\" to celebrate or honor certain groups, because we should be doing the work 365 days of the year. And that is absolutely true. This month is NOT the only time to celebrate and honor Latinx/Hispanic heritage. It is a time of intention and dedication to highlight Latinx/Hispanic heritage. Until our systems, practices, and beliefs value equity for historically and politically marginalized \"others\", these dedicated and intentional times of honoring are more important than ever, ¬øno? What is your favorite part or activity to do this month with students, friends, or family? #LatinxHeritageMonth #HispanicHeritageMonth #HispanicHeritageMonth2023 #bilingualeducation #DualLanguage #DLBE #teachers #pocketprofe #kimkennedyphd\n\nWe Alaskans know how important it is to show up for each other. During Pride month, this value is critical to ensuring all of us, our children, our neighbors, our friends, and ourselves, are safe and secure to be our truest selves. Check out some tips on how to be an ally, and why this value is at the heart of who we are https://lnkd.in/gHstR3je"
