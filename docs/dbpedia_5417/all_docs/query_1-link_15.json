Lund\n\n​Project Contact: Josue Medellin-Azuara or Jesse Jankowski (Delta CU Main Report) Kyaw Tha Paw U (Field Campaign Delta CU Study)\n\n(Full list of authors and contributors below)\n\nThis research project was convened by the Center for Watershed Sciences at the University of California Davis with financial support from the California State Water Resources Control Board Office of the Delta Watermaster and other agencies. Its objective is to develop a better understanding of consumptive water use in the Delta by coordinating modeling, measurement, and other information from a variety of independent research and estimation efforts.\n\nSummary\n\nConsumptive water use by crops, often referred to as evapotranspiration (ET), is frequently the largest component of an agricultural region’s water balance. This study investigates crop consumptive use in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta (“Delta”) of California using a comparative approach with several prominent methods for estimating crop ET, including estimates based on crop coefficients, water balances, energy balance using remote sensing, and field measurements.\n\nCrop ET estimates are provided for both the Legal Delta and the Delta Service Area (DSA) for two water years (2015 and 2016) by seven methods:\n\nCalSIMETAW: California Simulation of Evapotranspiration of Applied Water, by the California Department of Water Resources (DWR).\n\nDETAW: Delta Evapotranspiration of Applied Water, by DWR.\n\nDisALEXI: Disaggregated Atmosphere-Land Exchange Inverse method, by the U.S. Department of Agriculture Agricultural Research Service (USDA-ARS).\n\nITRC-METRIC: Mapping Evapotranspiration at High Resolution with Internalized Calibration (METRIC), by the Irrigation Training and Research Center (ITRC) at California Polytechnic State University (Cal Poly).\n\nSIMS: Satellite Irrigation Management Support System, by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Ames Research Center (NASA-ARC) and California State University Monterey Bay (CSUMB).\n\nUCD-METRIC: Mapping Evapotranspiration at High Resolution with Internalized Calibration (METRIC), by the University of California (UC) Davis.\n\nUCD-PT: Optimized Priestley-Taylor approach, by UC Davis.\n\nIn addition, field-based estimates and measurements of ET using eddy covariance and estimates with surface renewal stations were developed over bare soil during the fall of 2015 and over three predominant crops in the Delta (alfalfa, corn, and pasture) in the 2016 irrigation season. One direct ET measurement station was also deployed in 2016. Five additional California Irrigation Management Information System (CIMIS) stations were deployed in the Delta in 2016 to improve the spatial representation of weather variables and accuracy in input datasets of reference ET estimates. Two annual land use parcel surveys for 2015 and 2016 were conducted by Land IQ, Inc., which provided updated land use maps over the study area with more than 30 land use classes. A total of 26 agricultural classes were used for ET estimates and analysis.\n\nAdditional Funding and Research Support from\n\nCalifornia State Water Resources Control Board, California Department of Water Resources, Delta Protection Commission, Delta Stewardship Council, North Delta Water Agency, Central Delta Water Agency, South Delta Water Agency, Center for Watershed Sciences, and UC Water. Project managemnt support from Cathryn Lawrence at the Center for Watershed Sciences is aknowledged.\n\nProject Documents and Datasets\n\nMain Report\n\nAppendix Set: (Link to Box folder)\n\nAppendix A: Comparative Study Methodology and Additional Data\n\nAppendix B: Field Campaign Report for Water Years 2015-2016 and 2016-2017\n\nAppendix C: California Simulation of Evapotranspiration of Applied Water (CALSIMETAW)\n\nAppendix D: Delta Evapotranspiration of Applied Water (DETAW): A Layperson’s Guide to DETAW.\n\nAppendix E: Atmosphere-Land Exchange Inverse Flux Disaggregation Approach (DisALEXI)\n\nAppendix F: Irrigation Training and Research Center Mapping Evapotranspiration at High Resolution with Internalized Calibration (ITRC-METRIC)\n\nAppendix G: NASA Satellite Irrigation Management Support (SIMS)\n\nAppendix H: Mapping Evapotranspiration at High Resolution with Internalized Calibration, University of California Davis, Approach (UCD-METRIC)\n\nAppendix I: Priestley-Taylor UC Davis Approach (UCD-PT)\n\nAppendix J: Land Use Mapping of the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta by Land IQ, Inc.\n\nAppendix K: Additional Evapotranspiration Estimates and Figures\n\nAppendix L: Evapotranspiration Estimation from Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Imagery\n\nAppendix M: Regional-Scale Weather Modeling with WRF-ACASA\n\nModel Data, Spreadsheets, Field Data, Land Use, and GIS files\n\nMedia\n\nOffice of the Delta Watermaster Media Release, April 23, 2018\n\nModeling, Measuring, and Comparing Crop Evapotranspiration in the Delta, California Water Blog by Jesse Jankowski, April, 23, 2018\n\nDelta Stewardship Council: A Study Comparing Ways to Estimate Crop Evapotranspiration in the Delta, Maven's Notebook, June 13, 2018\n\nResources\n\nOffice of the Delta Watermaster project website, including links to public presentations\n\nFull Authors and Contributors List\n\nPrincipal Investigators\n\nJosué Medellín-Azuara1,2, Kyaw Tha Paw U3, Yufang Jin3, and Jay R.
