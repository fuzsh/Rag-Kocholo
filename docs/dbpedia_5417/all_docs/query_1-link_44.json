        "text": "My kids? Oh, they're proud Latinx. But here's the thing they teach me daily: not all Latinx are made equal, even under the same roof. There's many ways my children connect with their Puerto Rican and Salvadoran roots. My daughter expresses her ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡» roots in an after-school program where she counsels Spanish speaking. youth., bridging worlds with every Spanish phrase. My son whips up pupusas just like his aunt taught him, and look at him in this picture charming abuela into sharing her ðŸ‡µðŸ‡· pasteles wisdom! They both feel spending time with both sides of the family important. Iâ€™m sure if you ask my children what their social identity is it may vary even in our household. As educators working with families from different backgrounds here are some things you can consider: ðŸŽ„What are your students' social identities? And their families? ðŸŽ„Not all families are the same even within the same culture, ask questions. ðŸŽ„People of color donâ€™t all fit in the same box, we all have different experiences and upbringing. ðŸŽ„Some pass on family traditions, some create their own. Both are perfectly fine and donâ€™t make anyoneâ€™s identity any less. As we enter this holiday season remember some families are in the United States for the first time, away from their own cultural traditions. Some families are creating new ones. As the winter starts at least in the East coast where I am ðŸ¥¶ some of our students are also seeing snow and feeling the cold weather for the first time. Be kind, be open, letâ€™s learn together ðŸŽ„ Share some of your cultural traditions that you are looking forward to this season? Happy Holidays! #culture #traditions #diversity Alvarez Consulting & Advocacy\n\nToday is World Braille Day. People who are blind celebrate this day to honor Louis Braille, the creator of the Braille system which we use to read and write. Braille is the only method that we have as people who are blind to truly learn literacy including spelling, proper punctuation, document formatting and sentence structure. While some of these skills can be learned by using talking computers, Braille users tend to be better communicators when we are able to proofread our work more carefully by examining our texts letter by letter without thinking instead of having to go through the tedious process of doing so while listening to speech. Braille also allows us to engage with our audience when we are speaking, rather than having to listen to our notes to keep ourselves on track. With Braille, we can read our notes as needed while sending the message to our audience that they truly do matter while we are speaking. It is a powerful tool to show any members of society that we are paying attention to them in the interactions we have. Speaking from personal experience, trying to learn advanced mathematics by having formulas read to me was almost impossible for me to follow. I did not have the same difficulties when I had access to the very same information in Braille. At CNIB, we realize how important it is for our children to thrive in the education system. Education is one of the best predictors of future success.Braille is an essential tool for that to happen. I encourage all educators who are working with blind children in any capacity to not only promote Braille but to ensure that it is properly produced and provided to the student at the same time as other classmates receive their materials. Only offering students two or three Braille lessons each term is woefully inadequate. This happens in some Canadian locations. After all, I know you wouldnâ€™t accept that level of support for your sighted children. I know that I donâ€™t. Why should parents of children who are blind be put in that position? Please join with me in promoting CNIBâ€™s pillar entitled our Kids Will Thrive in our strategic plan found at https://lnkd.in/ghDfGGut. Also, encourage all of your friends and family to sign our Charter of Rights of Children Who Are Blind or Low Vision Found at https://lnkd.in/g5n-2RkP. Letâ€™s continue to show the world that Louis Brailleâ€™s contribution to society really does matter and remains an important tool for people who are blind, Deaf Blind or who have low vision.
