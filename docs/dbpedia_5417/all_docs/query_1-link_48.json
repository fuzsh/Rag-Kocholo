        "text": "Hanbin Lee, Robin Goldstein, and Dan Sumner, economists at CAIL, analyzed the\n\ndemand for food attributes, specifically organic claims and fresh-cut attributes, during the\n\npandemic. This analysis was conducted using extensive survey data collected from US carrot buyers. Hanbin Lee, one of the co-authors, presented these findings at the Agricultural Economics Workshop hosted by the Department of Agricultural and Resource Economics at the University of California, Davis. He reported that, during COVID-19, the median estimate of willingness to pay for organic attributes experienced a slight increase. Conversely, the median estimate of willingness to pay for fresh-cut attributes – referred to as “baby-cut” in marketplaces – saw a slight decrease during the pandemic.\n\nAbstract\n\nThis paper explores empirically the WTPs for the organic attribute and the baby-cut attribute (a fresh-cut attribute) of carrot products and focuses on how the WTP responded to the massive economic shock and market disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. A series of on-line survey responses were collected from hundreds of thousands of U.S. carrot buyers before and during the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdowns. We estimate that the median estimate of the WTP for an organic attribute rose from $0.05 before COVID-19 to $0.07 per pound during COVID-19. The median estimate of the WTP for the baby-cut attribute fell from $0.56 before COVID-19 to $0.51 per pound during COVID-19. The estimates of changes in WTP were not statistically significant for either attribute even with quite large national samples.\n\nMore Information: Please follow the provided link for additional details.\n\nURL: https://are.ucdavis.edu/department/seminars/2021/2/18/hanbin-lee/19585/\n\nMarketplace / May 11, 2021\n\n“So China has turned to U.S. corn, and that drives prices in the United States,” said agriculture professor Daniel Sumner at University of California, Davis.\n\nHe said American farmers have been growing more corn to meet demand, so they have less room for other crops.\n\n“Corn takes land away from wheat. Well, that reduces wheat supply, and you increase the price of wheat as a consequence,” Sumner said.\n\nClick here for the full article."
