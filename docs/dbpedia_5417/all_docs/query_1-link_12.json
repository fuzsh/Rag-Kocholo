Total 2011–13 water applied to fields was 28.4 maf. Total 2016–19 crop revenues were $42.5 billion; dairy cattle and milk contributed $6.6 billion of value, and other animal production contributed $1.6 billion (USDA ERS). Alfalfa, corn, and irrigated pasture are key inputs for animal production. Field crops include dry beans, cotton, rice, safflower, and sunflowers, among others. Applied water does not sum to 100% because of rounding.\n\nSOURCES: Author calculations using data from the US Bureau of Economic Analysis (total GDP), the US Department of Agriculture (farm GDP), and the CA Department of Water Resources (water and land use).\n\nNOTES: GDP is state gross domestic product, adjusted for inflation. Farm GDP is for primary crop and animal production and other farm-related income. Irrigated crop acreage includes multiple cropping. Farm water use is the amount applied to fields. Pre-2000 estimates are adjusted to levels for a year of normal rainfall. Estimates from 2000 onward represent actual use in years with near-normal precipitation, except 2015, a critically dry year. Water use estimates omit conveyance losses and active groundwater recharge.\n\nSources\n\nSee related fact sheets: “Water Use in California,” “Water Use in California’s Communities,” and “Water Use in California’s Environment.”\n\nCalifornia Department of Water Resources (water use and 2018 Land IQ land use mapping); Escriva-Bou et al.
