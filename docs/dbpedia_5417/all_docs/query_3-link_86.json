        "text": "The Next Shot While doing my caddy duties for my daughter, got a chance to spend quality time with some really bright young golfers to understand how they think! Over a dinner with two of upcoming stars of India and my daughter, a hidden in plain sight insight dawned on me. For simplicity I call it - the next shot ! A golfer has truly only one thing which they can impact. It is the next shot - a ball to be played where it lies and nothing else. A decision influenced by - the lie of the ball - fairway, rough or in the woods - distance to the goal, the flag - shot which will place it best for next shot - wind and weather conditions - obstacles - a water or bunker hazard usually - stage or play - are you leading or trailing. How aggressive you want your game to be? Your skills and judgment - the right club - placement of the ball - years of practise - a still mind The last shot is irrelevant, the shot after is only conjecture. What matters? Only the next shot ! And think about how much time we spend on analysing the past or predicting the future ! In sports as in business, while the learning from the past and crystal gazing into the future are all relevant, the next shot matters. Do not compromise it at the altar of baggages or dreams ! Hit the next shot the best you can. You would have increased the probability of winning !"
