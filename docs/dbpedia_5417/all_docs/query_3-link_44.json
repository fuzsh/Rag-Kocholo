        "text": "Aetiology\n\nPrimary Angle Closure Glaucoma (PACG) is a chronic optic neuropathy associated with a loss of retinal ganglion cells and their axons which typically affects the elderly. PACG has been estimated to affect 0.4% of European-derived populations aged 40 and over and 0.94% of those ≥70 years. Rates are 2-3 times higher in Chinese and South Asian populations compared to Europeans. PACG carries a greater risk of severe visual impairment compared with Chronic Open Angle Glaucoma.\n\nAngle closure is caused by a variety of mechanisms although pupil block, in which aqueous is impeded on its passage between the lens and posterior surface of the iris, is most common (up to 75% of cases). Non-pupil block causes include plateau iris and lens-induced (i.e. through intumescence or instability) angle closure.\n\nStaging of angle closure disease:\n\nPrimary Angle Closure Suspect (PACS)\n\nPrimary Angle Closure (PAC)\n\nPrimary Angle Closure Glaucoma (PACG).\n\nPrimary Angle Closure Suspect (PACS): represents the first stage, in which there is reversible contact between the peripheral iris and trabecular meshwork (irido-trabecular contact [ITC] in at least two quadrants). IOP is normal, there are no acquired adhesions between the iris and angle structures (peripheral anterior synechiae [PAS]), and no evidence of optic nerve damage.\n\nPrimary Angle Closure (PAC): is the second stage in which the IOP is elevated and/or PAS are present. There is no evidence of glaucomatous optic neuropathy at this stage.\n\nPrimary Angle Closure Glaucoma (PACG): is the final stage in which glaucomatous optic neuropathy has developed. In its chronic form, IOP may be normal or elevated and is often painless and asymptomatic.\n\n(ITC = irido-trabecular contact, PAS = peripheral anterior synechiae)\n\nAn acute presentation of angle closure is a well-known ophthalmic emergency. Acute Angle Closure crisis (AAC) results from a sudden rise in IOP (unilateral in 90% of cases) with acute symptoms (blurring, haloes and pain)\n\nPredisposing factors\n\nAnatomical\n\nAssociated with:\n\nsex (F:M ratio 3:1)\n\nethnicity (e.g. Chinese, Vietnamese, Inuit). PACG is recognised as a leading cause of blindness in East Asia\n\nfamily history\n\nshort axial length (hypermetropia)\n\nshallow AC (F>M)\n\nincreasing age (AC becomes shallower as lens thickness increases)\n\nsmall corneal diameter.\n\nIatrogenic (secondary angle closure)\n\nDrug induced\n\ntopical mydriatics\n\nincreasing pupillary block e.g. adrenergic agents such as phenylephrine, systemic drugs with anticholinergic effects such as tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors\n\nnon-pupillary block mechanism e.g. drugs that may cause ciliary body oedema, such as topiramate, sulphonamides.\n\nSurgery induced\n\nAngle closure may follow a number of surgical procedures, for example vitreo-retinal surgery with intraocular gas, especially in aphakic eyes.\n\nSymptoms of primary angle closure\n\nTypically patients with angle closure disease are asymptomatic, due to the chronic nature of the condition. Patients become symptomatic only when the disease is more advanced (e.g. ocular/periocular pain, headache).\n\nAAC is associated with sudden onset of symptoms and signs:\n\nrapid progressive impairment of vision of one or both eyes\n\nocular and periocular pain which can be severe\n\nnausea and vomiting\n\nocular redness.\n\n50% of patients with an acute angle closure attack give a history of previous intermittent attacks, e.g. episodes of blurring of vision lasting 1-2 hours, associated with haloes around lights, eye ache or frontal headache.\n\nSigns of primary angle closure\n\nGonioscopy remains the reference standard for confirming ITC and diagnosing angle closure, although non-invasive tests e.g. slit-lamp grading of limbal anterior chamber depth (van Herick technique) or anterior segment imaging using OCT are useful for case-finding.\n\nIn PACS the eye may appear normal (with the exception of a narrow drainage angle, as judged by limbal anterior chamber depth <25% of corneal thickness (van Herick <grade 2) or ITC visible on anterior segment OCT).\n\nPAC is additionally associated with elevated IOP and/or PAS.\n\nIn AAC the following signs may be present:\n\nlimbal and conjunctival vessels dilated, producing ciliary flush\n\n‘red eye’\n\npupil fixed, semi-dilated, vertically elliptical, iris whorling\n\ncorneal oedema\n\nshallow AC with peripheral irido-corneal contact (if angle can be visualised)\n\nhigh intraocular pressure (40-80mmHg)\n\nAC flare and cells\n\noptic disc oedematous and hyperaemic\n\ngrey/white anterior sub-capsular lenticular opacities (Glaukomflecken): diagnostic of previous attacks.\n\nDifferential diagnosis\n\nNeovascular glaucoma\n\nPhakolytic glaucoma\n\nPhakomorphic glaucoma\n\nAcute anterior uveitis\n\nUveitis with raised IOP\n\nMalignant glaucoma (cilio-lenticular block or aqueous misdirection glaucoma)\n\nManagement by optometrist\n\nPractitioners should work within their scope of practice, and where necessary seek further advice or refer the patient elsewhere\n\nGRADE* Level of evidence and strength of recommendation always relates to the statement(s) immediately above\n\nNon-pharmacological\n\nPACS\n\nIn the light of new evidence of a low risk of glaucomatous optic neuropathy or AAC in people with PACS, the decision to refer for possible treatment with laser peripheral iridotomy, or lens extraction as an alternative, should be based on the risk of developing PAC/PACG or AAC (see Management Category). In PACS without additional risk factors for angle closure, referral and treatment are usually unnecessary (though patients should be informed of the symptoms of AAC and advised to return immediately should these occur). However, there may be a case for expediting cataract surgery in patients with significant lens opacities\n\n(GRADE*: Level of evidence=moderate, Strength of recommendation=strong)\n\nIf not referring for further investigation, a person with PACS should be advised to seek an annual examination. Patients should be made aware that although they are at a low risk of angle closure, certain medications (e.g. pupil dilatation for fundus examination, SSRI antidepressants) could induce angle closure\n\n(GRADE*: Level of evidence=low, Strength of recommendation=strong)\n\nPAC/ PACG\n\nThe current clinical consensus is that patients with PAC/PACG should be treated surgically (clear lens/cataract removal and/or YAG laser peripheral iridotomy [LPI]) to relieve pupillary block together with pharmacological therapy to reduce elevated IOP\n\n(GRADE*: Level of evidence=moderate, Strength of recommendation=strong)\n\nPharmacological\n\nAAC\n\nPrior to referral, commence first aid treatment with a drop of pilocarpine 2% eye drops in blue eyes and 4% eye drops in brown eyes (although this is likely to be ineffective when IOP is over 40mmHg). Consider repeating the dose after 15 min\n\n(GRADE*: Level of evidence=low, Strength of recommendation=strong)\n\nAlthough the use of topical pilocarpine may be beneficial in pupil block and plateau iris situations (75% of cases), it may be harmful when the cause is lens-induced or retro-lenticular.\n\nAnalgesia and anti-emesis if necessary. Where the patient is not vomiting, give a single dose of oral acetazolamide (Diamox) 500mg (not slow release formulation). (NB: acetazolamide may be hazardous in elderly patients, and is contraindicated in people with sickle cell disease or trait.) Then refer as an emergency to ophthalmologist. (In view of potential unwanted effects of this treatment, patient should be accompanied by a carer or relative).\n\n(GRADE*: Level of evidence=low, Strength of recommendation=strong)\n\nManagement category\n\nAAC\n\nA2: first aid measures and emergency (same day) referral to ophthalmologist\n\nPAC/PACG\n\nA3: urgent (within one week) referral to ophthalmologist; no intervention\n\nPACS\n\nB1: routine referral to ophthalmologist (no intervention) only if limbal anterior chamber depth is <25% or an anterior segment OCT showing ITC, PLUS at least one of the following criteria:\n\npeople with only one ‘good’ eye\n\nvulnerable adults who may not report ocular or vision symptoms\n\nfamily history of significant angle closure disease\n\nhigh hypermetropia (> +6.00 dioptres)\n\ndiabetes or another condition necessitating regular pupil dilation\n\nthose using antidepressants or medication with an anticholinergic action (see http://www.acbcalc.com/ for details of drugs with anticholinergic properties)\n\npeople living in remote locations where rapid access to emergency ophthalmic care is not possible.\n\nIf an individual has the angle-characteristics specified above but none of the above additional criteria, and does not meet NICE glaucoma referral guidelines (based on IOP ≥24mm Hg or presence of signs of glaucoma) they should be advised to seek an annual examination.\n\nAlthough pharmacological pupil dilatation as part of routine eye care can cause a small increase in IOP in PACS eyes (typically <5mmHg), the risk of AAC is very low.\n\nPossible management in secondary care or local primary/community pathways where available\n\nAdditional guidance may be available\n\nAAC: for pupillary block mechanisms, treatment directed to breaking the pupil block and reducing IOP.\n\nMedical\n\nsystemic agents (e.g. acetazolamide)\n\ntopical anti hypertensives (e.g. gutt. timolol, gutt. dorzolamide, gutt. brimonidine, gutt pilocarpine).\n\nUrgent interventions\n\nargon laser peripheral iridoplasty (occasionally used in advance of YAG LPI when the cornea is cloudy and LPI cannot be performed)\n\nLPI.\n\nLess urgent interventions\n\nclear lens/cataract removal.\n\nAAC: for non-pupillary block mechanism with ciliary body oedema (e.g. due to topiramate) YAG LPI and cycloplegics are used instead of pilocarpine.\n\nPAC / PACG: first line treatment options include:\n\ntopical medical therapy\n\nLPI\n\nearly (clear) lens extraction in people over 50 years of age (a recent RCT found that clear lens extraction showed greater efficacy and was more cost-effective than LPI).\n\nEvidence base\n\n*GRADE: Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (www.gradeworkinggroup.org)\n\nSources of evidence\n\nAmerican Academy of Ophthalmology Glaucoma Panel.

The Impact of Pharmacological Dilation on Intraocular Pressure in Primary Angle Closure Suspects. Am J Ophthalmol. 2022;235:120-130\n\nSummary\n\nWhat is Primary Angle Closure / Primary Angle Closure Glaucoma?\n\nThe shape of the outer edge of the iris and the drainage channel for the fluid inside the eye (a space known as ‘the angle’) varies from person to person. This space is normally open, so that the fluid can drain freely, but if the edge of the iris and the drainage channel comes into contact from time to time, the patient is described as a Primary Angle Closure Suspect (PACS). There are no adhesions, there is no rise in eye pressure or evidence that damage to the optic nerve has been caused through raised eye pressure in the past. A condition called Primary Angle Closure (PAC) is present if the eye pressure is raised and/or adhesions between the iris and the drainage channel are present, but there is no damage to the optic nerve (the nerve of sight). If there is damage to the optic nerve caused by rises in eye pressure, the condition is described as Primary Angle Closure Glaucoma (PACG). In this country, this form of glaucoma is rarer than Primary Open Angle Glaucoma (POAG), but it carries a greater risk of damage to vision. This condition affects women more often than men, is commoner in long-sighted people and people of East Asian ancestry, and becomes more likely to occur as people age. Certain drugs and eye operations can also cause the drainage angle to close.\n\nA sudden complete closure of the angle (known as Acute Angle Closure crisis, AAC), which usually affects just one eye, causes rapidly progressing impairment of vision, redness of the eye, and pain in and around the eye which may be so severe as to cause nausea and vomiting. The eye pressure may be very high, because the fluid continues to be formed within the eye but cannot drain away. Various other changes will be seen in the eye by the examining optometrist.\n\nHow is Primary Angle Closure / Primary Angle Closure Glaucoma managed?\n\nAn acute attack of angle closure is an emergency which needs same-day referral to the ophthalmologist. There are drugs that the optometrist can use as first aid. The ophthalmologist will also prescribe drugs and may advise laser treatment (‘YAG laser’) to create a tiny hole in the iris (the coloured part of the eye) through which the fluid can drain. Treatment to the edge of the iris using a different kind of laser (argon laser peripheral iridoplasty) may also be advised. Later, further surgery may be recommended.\n\nIf at a routine eye examination there are signs that there have been earlier, milder attacks of angle closure, or if it appears that a patient could develop PACG, the referral can be urgent."
