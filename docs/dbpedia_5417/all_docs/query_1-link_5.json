        "text": "Introduction\n\nGlaucoma, a chronic eye condition, is a leading cause of avoidable blindness.1,2 Open angle glaucoma is the commonest form.3 Sight loss from glaucoma can be avoided as early treatment of the condition reduces the risk of sight loss.4 However, in the UK around 3000 people are newly registered with sight impairment due to glaucoma each year.5 Delayed detection and thus access to early treatment is the main risk factor for sight loss6,7 and may be linked to areal or individual socioeconomic deprivation.8 –10 Delayed access to treatment may occur at any stage of the referral pathway. There may be patient delay in terms of attendance for testing, process delay in terms of missed detection, or system delay leading to delayed referral for treatment.11 –13 The public health importance of glaucoma could indicate that a screening programme might be warranted. Before a screening policy is adopted evidence is required that the benefits of screening, namely reduced visual impairment, outweigh any harms, for example anxiety and cost.\n\nAn earlier evaluation using economic modelling found that screening the UK population, selected on age alone, was unlikely to be cost-effective as the prevalence is too low in all age groups (screening at age 40 or 65 or 75).5,14 A surveillance programme targeted to higher risk groups (a sibling with glaucoma; ethnic minority groups; diabetics; or people with ocular risk factors such as raised intraocular pressure (IOP) and myopia) or those who do not normally use eye care might be worthwhile. The modelling evaluation, hereafter referred to as the Glaucoma Screening Model, used the best data available but still had some uncertainties: how best to screen (tests and location); likely uptake of any screening programme; and the effectiveness and coverage of current eye care services.\n\nThe most robust way to evaluate any proposed screening programme is a randomized controlled trial (RCT).15 There are no RCTs evaluating glaucoma screening16 and any trial would need to be large and thus costly. In a recent trial platform study,17 we undertook a multicomponent mixed-methods approach to provide evidence to inform the optimal design for a trial. We followed the Medical Research Council guidance for the development and evaluation of complex interventions.18 Our initial work consisted of addressing the development of the screening test schedule and the factors associated with motivation of the public to attend for screening. We took a systematic, theory-based approach to intervention development (identifying the evidence, modelling process and developing outcomes) and explored the feasibility (for service providers), acceptability (for providers and users), and cost-effectiveness (for health and social services) of trial components. These individual components are published elsewhere.19 –21 In this paper, we report the integration of the findings (revised screening test schedule, likely uptake of screening and uptake of usual care) into the glaucoma screening economic model to inform whether a glaucoma screening trial would be worthwhile.\n\nMethods\n\nWe used a Markov model to assess how worthwhile a glaucoma screening trial would be. We took the perspective that interventions compared within the model could be delivered (technical feasibility) and were acceptable (likely uptake by providers and the public) in the context of the NHS.\n\nWe revised the structure of the existing Glaucoma Screening Model5,14 with the most likely cost-effective glaucoma testing schedules that might be brought to trial based on a prior Delphi survey19 and views of NHS providers.20 We updated parameter estimates for screening attendance based on our survey of the public to identify factors associated with their hypothetical intention (motivation) to attend an eye health test. We also used data collected in the survey on attendance by the public for an eye test within the last three years to estimate uptake of the comparator pathway within the model of opportunistic case finding within current eye care.21 Costs were reported in 2010 prices. We sought estimates of attendance at eye care services for several risk groups (age over 50, black ethnicity, diabetes, myopia, family history of glaucoma, and low socioeconomic status from the British Household Panel Survey data22 to develop and fit the probability distributions around the mean uptake of current eye care for the general population and subgroups using the Excel© add-on Oracle© Crystal Ball. Revised utility data were based on the EQ-5D-3L23 responses from 640 participants with ocular hypertension and glaucoma sampled from a secondary glaucoma service (Prior, personal communication). All other parameters were as detailed in the original Glaucoma Screening Model.5,14 The model allowed movement between health states every year, estimated costs from NHS and personal social services perspectives and used the EQ-5D-3L quality of life weights to calculate quality adjusted life years (QALYs).\n\nThe base case analysis conducted from NHS perspective, considered a cohort of 40-year old males with prevalence from 1% to 5%. Sex-specific variables were not available for any of the model parameters except for mortality. We used male mortality in the base-case analysis, consistent with good modelling practice, as they are a conservative assumption for screening. Alternative likelihoods of attending screening (e.g. 30–100%) and estimated costs and QALYs over their estimated lifetime with screening occurring every 10 years were included. All costs and QALYs were discounted at 3.5%. The results are presented as incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs).\n\nWe conducted sensitivity analyses to identify plausible situations where screening might be considered worthwhile by varying screening start age and accuracy of glaucoma detection within current eye care services. We used alternative data for uptake of current eye care (based on the survey of the public21 and British Household Panel Survey (BHPS) data) for the whole population, for cohorts aged 50 and 60 as well as for higher risk subgroups of the adult population: those self-reported as having diabetes, sight problems in the family (excluding using spectacles) as a proxy for family history of glaucoma, and those at low household income (below £10,000 a year). Data were not available within the BHPS to investigate the impact of ethnicity or myopia on the uptake rates of current eye care by these groupings.\n\nThe effect of including personal social services costs was explored in the sensitivity analysis by incorporating an annual cost of sight impairment from £1000 to £40,000. The upper value is in line with personal social services expenditure per person with sight impairment for England for 2009–10.24 Variations in cost of sight impairment were combined with variation in both prevalence rates and screening uptake to identify situations where screening might be worthwhile. We explored the impact of increasing screening uptake because of a behavioural intervention and incorporating an additional cost for its provision. Without a behavioural intervention, glaucoma screening uptake was considered to be about 23% (based on our survey where 45% of the sample had strong intention scores (mean intention score of 7 on a 1–7 scale)21 and the health behaviour literature that 50% of strong intenders will perform the intended behaviour.25 We varied screening uptake from 30% to 100% to explore the impact of a behavioural intervention. Reflecting a simple behavioural intervention such as an invitation letter targeted to improve motivation by making it easier to attend a screening appointment to a fully tailored intervention, and thus more costly, to persuade those with low intentions to attend. The mean QALYs were expressed in pounds sterling by multiplying them by the willingness to pay for a QALY threshold (e.g. £30,000, see ).\n\nWe also explored whether enhanced current eye care would be better than enrolling in a screening programme by modifying the model in order to compare two current practice strategies. Two uptake rates of current eye care were compared using BHPS data: 6.5% (corresponding to the uptake rate of low income groups) and 17% (estimated uptake of eye care for people with diabetes).\n\nAll analyses incorporated probabilistic sensitivity analyses where the statistical imprecision is allowed for by sampling (e.g. 1000 times) from probability distributions attached to model mean parameter values. The uncertainty in the model parameter values has cost implications as the ‘correct’ strategy might not be chosen. In effect, if the analysis is run with alternative parameter values the choice of strategy might differ from the strategy finally adopted. The sum of the benefits forgone for not being able to make the right decision due to this uncertainty is the expected value of perfect information (EVPI), as perfect information would eliminate the possibility of making wrong decisions.26 The EVPI can be compared with the cost of reducing uncertainty in the model by collecting further information. The expected value of parameter perfect information (EVPPI) is a similar concept but corresponds to a particular parameter or group of parameters in the model. EVPPI was calculated to identify model parameters that contribute the most to the overall model decision uncertainty.26 The total EVPI and EVPPI were obtained by multiplying the EVPI and EVPPI estimated at an individual level by the number of individuals who would benefit from the intervention in a given period of time. We assumed 380,000 individuals with undiagnosed glaucoma in the UK and an annual incidence of 11,000 new cases5 a time horizon of 10 years (representing the lifespan of the technology; in this case a specific screening strategy) and a discount rate of 3.5%.\n\nDiscussion\n\nMain findings\n\nFindings from the original Glaucoma Screening Model had suggested that glaucoma screening of a population selected on age is unlikely to be considered cost-effective at values for a QALY that society is typically willing to pay, but screening of high risk groups (prevalence of around 4%) might be. Across all the scenarios, we modelled the conclusion from the original evaluation is unchanged. Results were robust to all changes in the model parameter values except for the annual cost of sight impairment. When taking a wider perspective on the costs of sight impairment, findings from the two way sensitivity analysis, varying screening uptake and costs of sight impairment, suggest that assuming higher estimated costs of sight impairment screening the general population selected on age alone as opposed to surveillance of high risk groups might be worthwhile.\n\nData on the annual cost of sight impairment are very limited. The health costs of severe sight impairment due to glaucoma have been estimated as £800 per year (updated to 2010–2011 prices).27 For adults with physical disabilities, additional social care costs are estimated at £41,000 per year. These data include estimates from people with sight loss but data were not reported separately.24 The cost of sight impairment in the UK is reported by the Royal National Institute for the Blind as £12,457 per person per year.28 However, these calculations include indirect costs (productivity losses), cost due to lower employment, premature mortality, as well as £8782 corresponding to burden of disease cost – the use of such figures entails some double counting as some of these effects are captured within the QALY estimates. Estimates by Mead and Hyde suggest that the cost of blindness for another chronic eye condition, age related macular degeneration, range around £8000 (updated to 2010–2011 prices) for the first year of blindness but highlighted the limitations in the data to determine the true costs of failing eyesight.29\n\nThe purpose of updating the original Glaucoma Screening Model was to determine whether, given the newly defined screening pathways and target population, a large glaucoma screening RCT would be value for money in terms of informing policy decisions. The value of removing all uncertainties in the model was around £107 million, indicating that further research on glaucoma screening might be worthwhile. The uncertainty around cost of sight impairment contributed most followed by the uncertainty around screening test performance, and the uptake of screening or current eye care services.\n\nThese findings suggest that before proceeding to a large RCT evaluating a glaucoma screening or surveillance programme, further research to understand and quantify the cost of sight impairment is a priority. These data would be best collected within a prospective cohort study, following individuals through the spectrum of visual impairment and as needs change and adaptation to sight loss occurs.\n\nThe effectiveness of any screening or surveillance programme requires that the target population attend. Our findings suggest that behavioural intervention, such as a carefully worded invitation with a reminder or a more intensive intervention (e.g. tailored message, SMS reminder, buddy system) may improve attendance.21\n\nStrengths and limitations\n\nThis study used a transparent iterative approach building on a robust evidence synthesis and sought views of all stakeholders to inform decisions regarding glaucoma screening. We used robust qualitative and quantitative methods to provide an evidence-based recommendation for future research. It was not within the scope of this study to estimate the accuracy of screening tests or to evaluate the accuracy of current eye care services in the detection of glaucoma. We used the same estimates of performance of community optometric detection of glaucoma (current eye care) as used in the original model, based on a survey in the late 1980s which may not represent current practice. To estimate screening test performance we used estimates from an evidence synthesis but these were based on evidence from studies with heterogeneous populations and high risk of bias.\n\nWe had limited data on the uptake of current eye care services by higher risk groups, particularly by ethnic minority groups and those who might expect to have a higher uptake of current eye care, those with a family history of glaucoma. We did however use new primary data from our survey on eye testing within the last few years and used data from the BHPS that is considered to be representative.\n\nThe value for information analysis can only capture those uncertainties incorporated into the economic model and is dependent on the model structure. The model did not consider the potential harms due to screening (e.g. anxiety for those with false positives) or the side effects of treatment (e.g. cataracts). While it is unlikely that these omissions would have a major impact on the model results, they are a limitation of the analysis. Finally, while the EVPI analysis constitutes a necessary condition in determining whether further research is worthwhile it is not in itself sufficient to determine whether research should be conducted (although it can give a strong indication that further research is not worthwhile, if for example EVPI is less than the costs of conducting further research). A positive expected net-benefit of sampling (ENBS) constitutes a necessary and sufficient condition to conduct further research. ENBS is the difference between the benefits of reducing uncertainty with a particular sample size study and the cost of obtaining that sample size. Unfortunately, ENBS can be obtained only under very restrictive assumptions and is often computationally prohibitive and there have been few examples where it has been used in practice to inform, for example, the sample size of a trial.30 In such circumstances, we believe the EVPI establishes a first step to inform the judgment that further research is potentially worthwhile."
