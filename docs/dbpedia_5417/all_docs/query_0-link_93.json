        "text": "After Laura Bozzo was in the sights of the authorities a few months ago because of her problems with the Ministry of Finance in which she finally reached an agreement and avoided stepping into the courts and even prison, the Peruvian driver has resumed her work aspect.\n\nWith the recent premiere of her program Que pase Laura, broadcast through the Imagen Televisión signal, Laura has returned to the spotlight, because with her talk show of social content, the same formula she knows quite well, comparisons have not been long in coming.\n\nThe debut of the self-proclaimed “lawyer of the poor” on the evening program has attracted attention, especially because of the voices that suggest that Bozzo's presence on the small screen would be something undesirable, considering that the format of programs like that has remained in the past.\n\nAlso, the so-called “Miss Laura” was the subject of comparisons with Rocío Sánchez Azuara, who recently appeared at the head of Acercate to Rocío on the same television station, a program with the format that the two hosts have presented for years on different television stations in broadcasts such as Laura en América and Cosas de la life, respectively.\n\nIt has been on social networks and even on Laura Bozzo's official profiles, where certain sectors of the public have expressed their dissatisfaction with her return to the screen and have even confronted her with Sanchez Azuara, who recently returned to TV Azteca after 7 years of leaving the television station.\n\nLaura did not let go of some of the many comments she has received and replied that there are no reasons to compare herself with her: “There definitely can be no comparisons here, everyone with their own thing because my hours speak for me... they are totally different programs,” she said on her social network.\n\nBozzo wished his colleague success in the program that is about to be released on the screen of Azteca Uno: “I wish her the best, she is a great journalist, that she does spectacular, but mine is completely different because mine is going towards a solution,” he added. In addition, Laura defended herself against those who ask her to return to her country of origin and assured that she deeply loves Mexico: “I have shown my love for Mexico with my works.”\n\nFor his part, in a recent live broadcast on Azteca Uno's Facebook, Rocío Sánchez Azuara made statements that some considered to be a hint for Laura Bozzo and her “scandalous” style of driving.\n\nDuring the broadcast, Rocío was asked what happens when in his program situations get out of control and the panelists get exasperated:\n\n“No action is taken, it is executed immediately. Your server is anti-violence, I don't like shouting, I don't like blows, the microphone works... I usually bring an imperceptible button that is the microphone and that microphone serves precisely not to scream”, he said, and according to some comments from the public, he could be alluding to Bozzo, because with his famous cry “Let the wretch pass” and the physical blows shown in some of his productions correspond to the description of Sánchez Azuara.\n\n“It is not necessary to shout, it seems very common to me to be screaming, or to be rude or irreverent to others, the blows do not go with me and I simply read them primer and say 'gentlemen, this is a forum of expression that deserves a lot of respect, you deserve me respect and you are looking very bad behaving in this or that way. So, please, the rules are very simple: no rudeness, they don't get up from their places to avoid confrontation, to avoid confrontation too,” said the journalist."
