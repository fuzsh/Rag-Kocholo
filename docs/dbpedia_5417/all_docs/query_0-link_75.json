        "text": "Laura Bozzo faced rumors about her alleged rivalry with Rocío Sánchez Azuara after both hosts returned to Mexican television with new talk shows. The Peruvian also spoke about her participation in the second season of La Casa de los Famosos and her possible encounters with Niurka Marcos, who has previously made strong comments against her.\n\nThe lawyer gave a telephone interview for Gustavo Adolfo Infante's YouTube program, where she talked about her upcoming projects. In the middle of the talk, the show journalist questioned her about rumors that suggest she has an enmity with the 58-year-old Potosina because both have developed similar projects throughout her career and this year is no exception.\n\nBozzo recently returned with What happens Laura on Imagen Televisión, while Sánchez Azuara is about to release Get close to Rocío on TV Azteca. In this regard, the Peruvian commented that there should be no comparisons between them because their programs are different, in addition to the fact that she has a long career in front of talk shows, just remember the program that catapulted her to international fame, Laura in America.\n\n“There can definitely be no comparisons here, everyone with their own because my hours speak for me [...] are totally different programs. I wish her the best, she is a great journalist, what is spectacular for her, but mine is completely different because mine is going towards a solution,” she said.\n\nLaura Bozzo took the opportunity to recall that her programs date back to the 90s and follow a different format than those proposed by Cristina Saralegui, a pioneer in this style of productions. She also confessed that she feels assaulted by the hate she receives on social networks related to her nationality and her return to the country.\n\n“I have shown my love for Mexico with my works,” she said and clarified that she is already nationalized.\n\nOn the other hand, Laura Bozzo spoke about her participation in La Casa de los Famosos 2, a reality show where she will remain locked up with Ivonne Montero, Mayeli Alonso, Juan Vidal, Salvador Zarboni, Luis Potro, Natalia Alcocer, Nacho Casano and Niurka Marcos, being the vedette with whom speculation could clash more easily.\n\nIn this regard, the Peruvian said that she has no problem with the dancer despite her constant negative criticism: “I don't have any problem with Niurka Marcos, I know that she has referred to me in a horrifying way and well nothing, I don't have any problem with her attacks, that if my physique is horrific”.\n\nDuring the talk he recalled that when they had similar programs on TV Azteca but only one triumphed: “When they put her to compete with me in Azteca (She is Niurka) they had to release her a month because I demolished her in the rating then it is obvious that she has a certain grudge towards me, poor thing, I wish her the best”.\n\nLaura Bozzo acknowledged that her only intention in reality is to show that she can win despite stereotypes: “If I am a very confident person, I am a person who if they treat me well I can be an angel and if they treat me badly I can be a demon. I do not accept disrespect, much less. I am one of the women who intends to be in that house to also demonstrate that female empowerment.”\n\nHe finally confessed that he agreed to participate because he considers it a challenge that will leave him positive things and he believes that he owes it to the Latin American public living in the United States for all the boost they have given to his career.\n\n“It's something totally new for me, I've never been to anything like that. My daughters were kind of surprised, they didn't think that much of the idea, but I felt it was a challenge, I love challenges and doing different things [...] I think it's a debt that I owe to the Hispanic public in the United States,” he added."
