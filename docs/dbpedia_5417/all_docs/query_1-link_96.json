I have graduated 16 undergraduate, masters and PhD students. I have been the advisor of 3 postdoctoral fellowships for Mexico-CONAHCYT. My research has allowed me to present 84 abstracts in national and international congresses. I have participated as thesis reader for 58 undergraduate and Master's in Science theses at UACM, Cinvestav-IPN and UNAM. I have been an evaluator of CONAHCYT's Frontier Science Calls. I am a guest editor for Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology and a reviewer for the Elsevier journals Prostist, Pattern Recognition and Molecular and Biochemical Parasitology.Â My research focuses on nuclear functions which are involved in maintaining, replicating and regulating genome expression in Entamoeba parasites.",
