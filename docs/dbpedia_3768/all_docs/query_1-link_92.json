They keep their mouths open so that water flows over their gills to give them oxygen. They have sharp teeth. They have one very long fin along their back all the way down their tail. They can reach 5 feet long.\n\nWhen you research information you must cite the reference. Citing for websites is different from citing from books, magazines and periodicals.
