        "text": "MORAY EELS FACTS and SPECIES INFORMATION\n\nTaxonomy [Cosmopolitan Eels] [Phylum: Chordata] [Class: Actinopterygii] [Family: Muraenidae]\n\nMorays belong to the Muraenidae family and are recognised as cosmopolitan eels because they are found in many areas throughout the world.\n\nAlmost all of the 200 moray eel species are exclusively marine animals with the exception of a few freshwater morays.\n\nThey vary tremendously in length and weight from the 11 cm Snyder's moray to the colossal 4 meter Strophidon sathete moray and other giants weighing close to thirty kilograms.\n\nMorays Characteristics\n\nMoray eels display an extended dorsal fin which runs from the head backwards almost to its caudal fin.\n\nGenerally they lack fish fins such as pelvic and pectorals which emphasizes their serpentine characteristics.\n\nMost of the genus has small eyes instead relying on acute sense of smell to identify their prey.\n\nStrangely the patterns that adorn their bodies additionally exist inside the moray's mouth. They have wide threatening jaws with salient snout.\n\nTheir large intimidating teeth are used for tearing and grasping they prey. Although the vast majority feed on small fishes and occasional shrimps, snowflake and zebra moray eels possess blunt crushing molars suitable for targeting crustaceans.\n\nMost fish use negative pressure to swallow but moray's struggle with this function because of their narrow heads. Instead they launch their second jawline of pharyngeal teeth from the back of the throat into their prey.\n\nThe victim is immobilized and then transported inwards for digestion. No other animals use this behavioral capture and restraint. Morays are carnivores broadly feeding on fishes, mollusks such as octopuses, and crustaceans such as shrimps.\n\nAlthough it is extremely rare, the fact is large moray eels are certainly equipped to cause serious wounds to imprudent divers and documentation of moray attacks do exist. Another reason not to engage with morays is their thick toxic skin.\n\nSome morays secrete poisonous mucus on their skin used for their protection. Moray's biggest predatory threat comes from groupers, sea snakes and barracudas.\n\nDivers also enjoyed reading about..."
