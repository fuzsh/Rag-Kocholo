        "text": "How long have eels been around for?\n\nEels have been around for about 50 million years! The European eel is Critically Endangered – you can find more information on the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species.\n\nEels are a part of the Thames cultural heritage\n\nEvery year young eels known as elvers arrive from the Sargasso Sea and swim up the Thames, however that journey is hindered by the many barriers on the river.\n\nHow many eggs does an eel lay?\n\nA female eel will lay between 1 and 4 million eggs! She will only spawn once in her life time and this is called semelparous.\n\nDid you know that eels are crepuscular?\n\nEuropean eels are crepuscular. This means that they are most active at dawn and dusk. There are of course exceptions, so this doesn’t apply to all of them and not all of the time.\n\nDid you know that eels are catadromous?\n\nCatadromous is the name given to fish that start their life in the salty waters of seas and oceans, migrate to freshwater for part of their life cycle and return to the sea to breed. The European eel does exactly this, hatching from a tiny egg in the Sargasso Sea, then migrating to our rivers and finally setting off and fully maturing into an adult eel on the journey back to the Sargasso Sea; where it will breed just once in its lifetime.\n\nWhen do eels become male or female?\n\nEels do not have a sex until later on in development, when they are about 30cm long. What sex the eel becomes is determined by density of eels in the river or estuary (not all eels make the journey up the river, some will spend years in the Thames Estuary before migrating back to the Sargasso Sea) – lower species density equals more females.\n\nFinal life cycle stage of an eel\n\nWhen the eel develops into its final life cycle stage, the eel’s body adapts to become a silver eel and no longer eats, instead living off of their fat reserves. The downstream migration of seabound Silver eels happens in the autumn. These changes are to cope with the salt water during the migration back to the Sargasso Sea. The Silver eel only becomes fully mature during the journey to the Sargasso Sea.\n\nRadcot Bridge is the oldest surviving bridge across the Thames\n\nIt was was the scene of a battle on 19th December 1387 between the forces of Richard II and Henry Bollingbroke, the future Henry IV. This battle raged along the Thames to Newbridge and finished at Bablock Hythe.\n\nThe Oxford stretch of the Thames is often referred to as the River Isis\n\nIt was thought its original name Tamesis was a combination of Thame and Isis, this has turned out to be false. The name Isis has been used from its source in the Cotswolds until it is joined by the Thame at Dorchester in Oxfordshire.\n\nThe River Kennet enters the Thames at Reading\n\nThe Thames has 38 main tributaries feeding it between its source and Teddington. The Kennet is the largest. These tributaries contain a range of important habitats that support many species of wildlife, including water voles and otters.\n\nA salmon ladder was opened at Boulters Weir on 19 May 2000 by the Duke of Wellington\n\nThe last salmon caught before the salmon ladder at the weir was landed in 192. This was one of 20 ladders installed through funding from Thames Salmon Trust, now know as Thames Rivers Trust."
