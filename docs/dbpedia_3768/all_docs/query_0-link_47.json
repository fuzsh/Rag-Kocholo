        "text": "Elopomorpha is one of the three main clades of living teleost fishes and includes a range of disparate lineages including eels, tarpons, bonefishes, and halosaurs. Elopomorphs were among the first groups of fishes investigated using Hennigian phylogenetic methods and continue to be the object of intense phylogenetic scrutiny due to their economic significance, diversity, and crucial evolutionary status as the sister group of all other teleosts. While portions of the phylogenetic backbone for Elopomorpha are consistent between studies, the relationships among Albula, Pterothrissus, Notacanthiformes, and Anguilliformes remain contentious and difficult to evaluate. This lack of phylogenetic resolution is problematic as fossil lineages are often described and placed taxonomically based on an assumed sister group relationship between Albula and Pterothrissus. In addition, phylogenetic studies using morphological data that sample elopomorph fossil lineages often do not include notacanthif...\n\nThe Notacanthiformes is an ancient group of deep-sea ray-finned fishes comprising 27 species in two families; Halosauridae and Notacanthidae. Although many studies have tried to reconstruct the phylogenetic relationships among the major clades of Elopomorpha, little is known about the evolutionary history of notacanthiforms. Molecular and morphological data were used to test previous hypotheses regarding the phylogenetic relationships among notacanthiform taxa, and to unravel the origin and evolution of this group. The molecular analyses of notacanthids showed similar results to those previously obtained employing osteological data, which proposed the existence of the Lipogenyinae (Lipogenys) and Notacanthinae (Notacanthus + Polyacanthonotus) subfamilies. Nevertheless, when the external morphology data is considered Lipogenys is more related to Notacanthus than Polyacanthonotus. The analyses could not fully resolve the inner relationships of the halosaurids. The time-calibrated tree...\n\nRecent mitogenomic studies suggest a new position for the deep-sea fishes of the order Alepocephaliformes, placing them within the Otocephala in contrast to their traditional placement within the Euteleostei. However, these studies included only two alepocephaliform taxa and left several questions unsolved about their systematics. Here we use whole mitogenome sequences to reconstruct phylogenetic relationships for 11 alepocephaliform taxa, sampled from all five nominal families, and a large selection of non-alepocephaliform teleosts, to address the following three questions: (1) is the Alepocephaliformes monophyletic, (2) what is its phylogenetic position within the Teleostei and (3) what are the relationships among the alepocephaliform families? Our character sets, including unambiguously aligned, concatenated mitogenome sequences that we have divided into four (first and second codon positions, tRNA genes, and rRNA genes) or five partitions (same as before plus the transversions a...\n\nThe genus Anguilla Shaw of Family Anguillidae consists entirely of freshwater eels, including 15 species and 2 subspecies. Conventionally, variegated markings and the length of the dorsal fin are the major morphological features used for reconstruction of phylogenetic relationships. The evolutionary history of these species remains unclear, especially for the Atlantic eels, whose habitats are far from the Metropolis in the Indo-Pacific region. This study reexamined the phylogenetic relationships of 12 Anguilla species by sequencing of the cytochrome b and 12S rRNA genes. In our analysis, species bearing similar coloration patterns or dorsal fin morphology are not necessarily clustered in the same clade, indicating that these morphological features might be unstable or might have occurred independently in different lineages during evolution. Combining our molecular data and geographical evidence, we speculate that (1) Anguilla first radiated about 20 million years ago, (2) the ancest..."
