        "text": "The classification of fishes has undergone much change over the last few decades, and further changes are expected, partly because so many groups are poorly known. There are many conflicting hypotheses of relationships, some based on conflicting evidence between morphological studies and molecular studies; however, progress is being made and there are many areas of basic agreement. There are about 28 000 living species of fishes recognized as valid (formally described and recognized). This is slightly over half the number of recognized tetrapods. About 11 950 of these species are confined to fresh water. Many new species are described every year, and if we use the same species concept as the above figure reflects, then there may be an estimated 32 500 species alive today (some estimated 4500 are yet to be found and described).\n\nCurrently, ichthyologists place living species in about 4500 genera, 515 families and 62 orders. The following summary of the groups is based primarily on a synthesis of the recent literature. Numerous fossil groups of Chondrichthyes, Actinopterygii and Sarcopterygii, many occurring in Canada, are not covered below. About 1200 species of native fishes live in Canada, either in fresh water or marine water over the continental shelf (many more live within Canadian territorial limits in deep water in the Arctic, Atlantic and Pacific). Unless otherwise mentioned, Arctic fishes are combined into Atlantic and Pacific.\n\nMethods and Differences Between Classifications\n\nMost ichthyologists adopt a cladistic methodology of classification, which classifies strictly according to recency of common descent. In this system, the goal is to have each taxonomic unit contain all species sharing a common ancestor. This often results in a very different classification than would result from the approach commonly used up to about 1980. In the older approach, evolutionary or synthetic systematics, the inferred amount of divergence among groups was considered, as was the history of their evolutionary relationships, and a given taxon might not contain all the descendants from the inferred ancestral species.\n\nAn example of the difference between these 2 approaches comes from showing hagfishes and lampreys in a classification. In a cladistic system, hagfishes would be placed in a category separate from lampreys and other vertebrates because, relative to hagfishes, lampreys are thought by most ichthyologists using morphological evidence to share a common genealogical branching point with all other vertebrates. Systematists using the evolutionary approach could express the relationship in several ways but might prefer to place hagfishes and lampreys together in the category of jawless fishes, separate from all jawed vertebrates, although recognizing that they are very distantly related.\n\nDifferences may also exist in classifications because of ichthyologists using different characters, for example, molecular versus morphological characters. Other differences may also exist among classification systems, depending on whether the worker is a \"lumper\" or a \"splitter.\" A lumper constructs a classification with categories containing more groups than that of a splitter. There are no rules for the amount of difference necessary to designate various categories. A lumper recognizes one family for salmon, whitefish and grayling; a splitter, 2 or 3 families.\n\nClassification\n\nThe following summarizes the major groups of fishes. Fishes and the tetrapods belong to the subphylum Craniata.\n\nSuperclass Myxinomorphi\n\nClass Myxini\n\nThe remaining fishes and the tetrapods belong to the infraphylum Vertebrata.\n\nSuperclass Petromyzontomorphi\n\nClass Petromyzontida\n\nSuperclass Gnathostomata - Jawed Vertebrates\n\nClass Placodermi (extinct)\n\nClass Chondrichthyes\n\nClass Acanthodii (extinct)\n\nClass Actinopterygii\n\nClass Sarcopterygii\n\nHagfishes\n\nClass Myxini\n\nOne order Myxiniformes, with one family, Myxinidae, and 70 species, 3 in Canada (one in Atlantic and 2 in Pacific). Marine, world-wide, temperate regions.

Anadromous and freshwater, cool zones of the world. Jawless eel-like fishes, many of which are parasitic-like.\n\nSuperclass Gnathostomata - Jawed Fishes\n\nAll other fishes and tetrapods are jawed and belong to the superclass Gnathostomata. Two classes are extinct groups of fishes.\n\nClass Placodermi\n\nAn extinct group of fishes with bony plates covering the head, living from the Silurian to the Upper Devonian (443 to 360 million years ago); some are known from Canada.\n\nClass Acanthodii\n\nAn extinct group of fishes with large eyes and up to 6 pairs of spines between the pectoral and pelvic fins, earliest known jawed fishes living from the Late Ordovician to the Early Permian (458 to 300 million years ago); well known from Canada.
