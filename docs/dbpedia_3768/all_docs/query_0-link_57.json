        "text": "The Notacanthiformes comprise the families Halosauridae and Notacanthidae. Both families are found in deep waters on the continental slope, typically in depths greater than 500 m in Australian waters. Like their relatives, the true eels (Anguilliformes), halosaurs and spiny eels have a leptocephalus larval stage.\n\nForey et al. (1996) placed the Halosauridae and Notacanthidae in the order Notacanthiformes. Wang et al. (2003), who did not include any halosaurs in their phylogeny, recognised the Albulidae and Notacanthidae as belonging to the Albuliformes. Inoue et al. (2004) included the halosaur Aldrovandia in their study and defined the Albuliformes as comprising the Albulidae, Halosauridae and Notacanthidae. Nelson (1994, 2006) included the families Albulidae, Halosauridae and Notacanthidae in the order Albuliformes."
