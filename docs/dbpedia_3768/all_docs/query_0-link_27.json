        "text": "Results and Discussion\n\nThe final concatenated alignments included 21 markers with 20853 sites for 1416 taxa in the 3+ dataset and 1020 taxa in the 7+ dataset. The average presence of data (number of sequences per taxon) across the alignments was 41.0% for the 3+ dataset and 48.2% for the 7+ dataset. A summary of dataset features, including data presence, alignment length, and sequence variation for each marker is given in Table 2 (see also Table S1). The new sequences have been deposited in GenBank under accession numbers {\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"KC825360\",\"term_id\":\"482703126\"}}KC825360-{\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"KC831391\",\"term_id\":\"482715670\"}}KC831391. The sequence alignment (nexus format), ML tree (newick format), and Table S1 are available from the Dryad repository (DOI:10.5061/dryad.c4d3j). The main phylogenetic hypothesis is summarized in Fig. 1 (24-partition RAxML tree, 3+ dataset, time-calibrated under PL). Fig. 2 provides measures of congruence among alternative analyses (concatenation and gene trees) for all major clades and provides discrete tests for traditional hypotheses in ichthyology. Figs. 3–10 provide more detail on the relationships within selected percomorph clades based on the tree in Fig. 1. The time-calibrated (BEAST) tree for the subset (202 taxa and 18 genes) and 59 calibration points are shown in Fig. 11 (see also Appendix 1); Fig. 12 compares the results of divergence times estimated for major groups with those obtained by other recent multi-locus studies. The complete phylogeny with bootstrap values and taxonomic annotations is depicted in Fig. S1 as a cladogram and can also be visualized online as a time-tree using a fractal explorer and zooming interface at OneZoom 73 (also posted at DeepFin).\n\nThe basal nodes of the tree and relationships among early branching groups of bony fishes have been well established and thoroughly discussed by recent molecular systematic studies based on similar sets of genes29 , 66, albeit with reduced taxonomic sampling. Because our results corroborate these hypotheses (e.g. monophyly of Actinopterygii and Holostei, branching order of elopomorphs and osteoglossomorphs; Fig. 1), we refer the reader to those papers for discussion on relationships among lineages from the root of the tree up to the Euteleosteomorpha. The most significant new results involve crown acanthomorph lineages, in particular the unprecedented resolution among percomorphs, represented in this study by 1037 species in 201 families. The proverbial “bush at the top” is now disambiguated into several well-supported clades at the ordinal or supraordinal level, with well-resolved relationships amongst them (Fig. 1). We also provide for the first time a monophyletic definition of Perciformes, sinking into this clade components of Scorpaeniformes, Gasterosteiformes, and Cottiformes (Fig. 10; see also16 , 74). Among the euacanthomorphs, we find the non-monophyly of Beryciformes (including Stephanoberyciformes) and a sister-group relationship between holocentrids and percomorphs, first recognized by Stiassny and Moore75 and Moore76, but challenged by Johnson and Patterson4.\n\nBased on the topology obtained (Figs. 1-10, S1) we propose a new classification for ordinal and subordinal groups of bony fishes and subsequently discuss some of the most significant findings.\n\nRevised Classification for Bony Fishes\n\nThe nomenclatural arrangement presented in Appendix 2 builds on the existing classification by Wiley and Johnson5 and intends to preserve names and taxonomic composition of groups whenever possible. However, adjustments are made to recognize new well-supported molecular clades, many of which also have been obtained by previous molecular studies (several examples discussed below). Order-level or supraordinal taxa are erected (new) or resurrected on the basis of well-supported clades only (>90% bootstrap values). Current taxon names supported by previous molecular or morphological studies are retained if congruent with our results, even if bootstrap support is low (e.g., Osteoglossocephalai sensu Arratia79 with only 38% bootstrap). In some cases, ordinal or subordinal taxa that were not monophyletic in our analysis are also validated, as long as the incongruence is not supported by strong bootstrap values. Examples include the suborder Blennioidei (not monophyletic here but monophyletic in Wainwright et al.31) and the order Pleuronectiformes (not monophyletic here but monophyletic in Betancur-R. et al.28).\n\nFamily names for bony fishes are based on Eschmeyer and Fong89 and van der Laan et al.90, with minor modifications. Consult van der Laan et al.90 for authorship of family names and Wiley and Johnson5 for authorship of ordinal and subordinal names. Our list is not intended as a comprehensive revision of valid family names; instead, it is simply an adaptation of their list based on published studies that we know validate or synonymize family groups using explicit phylogenetic evidence. Unlike Eschmeyer and Fong89 and van der Laan et al.90, we do not recognize the family status of Anotopteridae, Omosudidae (synonyms of Alepisauridae91) or Latidae (synonym of Centropomidae27 , 92). Also, we recognize the following families, listed in Eschmeyer and Fong89 and van der Laan et al. 90 as synonyms or subfamilies of other families: Botiidae (following Chen et al.93), Diplophidae (following Nelson2; apparently omitted by Eschmeyer and Fong89), Horabagridae (following Sullivan et al.94), Sinipercidae (following Li et al.96), Steindachneriidae (following Roa-Varon and Ortí98), Zanclorhynchidae, the aulopiform Bathysauropsidae and Sudidae (following Davis91), and the pleuronectiform Paralichthodidae, Poecilopsettidae, and Rhombosoleidae (following Chapleau97, Munroe99, Betancur-R. et al.28). A total of 502 families are recognized here, of which 369 (73.5%) were examined. Of these, 146 families included only one representative (39.6%) and 40 (17.9%) of the remaining 223 were rendered non-monophyletic in our analysis (non-monophyletic families are indicated below). For each order/suborder we list all families examined as well as the unexamined families whose taxonomic affinity is expected on the basis of traditional taxonomy or phylogenetic evidence. The list of unexamined families is also intended as a resource that may help fish systematists to direct future sequencing efforts.\n\nA total of 66 orders are classified, three of which are new (Holocentriformes, Istiophoriformes, and Pempheriformes), and 15 are resurrected or validated under a new circumscription. Some ordinal or subordinal names may appear to be new, but most can be found in the literature at various hierarchical levels. As examples, Spariformes is a Bleeker name and Centrarchiformes is a Webber and de Beaufort name. Because priority is not applied to names above the family level, we have not made a thorough attempt to establish first use. Only those three for which no reference could be found are listed as “new.” New infraorders are named in Suborder Cottioidei to circumscribe well-corroborated clades and may conserve the rank of superfamily in subsequent revisions. The ordinal status of 50 percomorph families examined (as well as many others unexamined) belonging to Carangimorphariae, Ovalentariae, and Percomorpharia remains uncertain (i.e.,incertae sedis) due to poor phylogenetic resolution. Percentages in parentheses following names indicate bootstrap support (no bootstrap values shown for redundant groups or monotypic taxa). The complete phylogenetic tree with annotated classification is illustrated in Fig. S1. The new classification scheme presented here should be considered a work in progress (version 1; Appendix 2), as any other hypothesis. It is likely to include involuntary errors and omissions in addition to the many unexamined, sedis mutabilis, and incertae sedis taxa. Updates should be forthcoming as new evidence become available and feedback from experts help refine it. For the most updated version visit DeepFin.\n\nComparison of classifications\n\nOur results (Appendix 2) invite comparison to the recent classification of Wiley and Johnson5 based on morphological evidence gleamed from many investigators. Of 123 clades recognized by them, 70 (56.9%) are congruent with bootstrap values >95% obtained in this study. Five of these 70 clades are included in our sample by only one family and thus their monophyly is not critically tested. Another six clades (4.9%) are congruent but are supported by lower bootstrap values; seven additional clades (5.7%) are monotypic. Forty clades (32.5%) are incongruent, with some being grossly polyphyletic in our tree. Notable examples are Protacanthopterygii, Smegmamorpharia, and Labriformes. Others are incongruent based on exclusion of subclades and are rendered monophyletic in our classification by the addition or removal of smaller clades. Examples include Stomiatii (inclusion of Osmeriformes sensu stricto), Otomorpha (inclusion of Alepocephaliformes), Neoteleostei (removal of Stomiatiformes), and Lampridiformes (removal of Stylephorus).\n\nThere is considerable consensus between morphology and the interrelationships of major clades. For example, the major cohorts of living teleosts and their interrelationships are congruent with the listing convention employed by Wiley and Johnson5; this is also true within many of the major clades (e.g. relationships within Elopomorpha). But there is also incongruence. For example, relationships among early-branching acanthomorph groups differ considerably from previous morphological hypotheses (e.g., Johnson and Patterson4) with lampridiforms, percopsiforms, zeiforms and gadiforms branching off basally relative to polymixiiforms. More explicit tests of new and alternative phylogenetic hypotheses based on multiple analyses of our dataset are presented in Fig. 2.\n\nNovel Clades of Teleost Fishes\n\nThe following sections highlight some of the salient features of this global phylogeny and classification of bony fishes, especially in reference to well-established relationships and newly found clades among the euteleosts. We do not attempt to provide a complete account of all taxonomic issues, but to give some perspective and contrast to discuss the evidence supporting novel and established taxa.\n\nEarly euteleost lineages: tenuous relationships (Fig. 1)\n\nOur analyses support several recent hypotheses based on molecular data that contradict the consensus based on morphology2 , 5 relative to the composition of “protacanthopterygians.” Although our results fall short of resolving with confidence circumscription and relationships among taxa in this group (hence Protacathopterygii is a sedis mutabilis taxon in our proposed classification), some relationships are well supported and consistent with previous studies (Fig. 1). First, is the hypothesis that alepocephalid fishes (slickheads) have affinities within Otomorpha, instead of Argentiformes, as proposed by Johnson and Patterson4. This result was first proposed on the basis of mitogenomic data10 , 41 , 100 , 101 and recently corroborated with a subset of the nuclear markers used in this study29. Second, is the sister group relationship of Osmeriformes and Stomiatiformes (=Stomiiformes), first proposed by López et al.21 based on mtDNA and rag1 sequence data. Finally, the position of Lepidogalaxias at the base of the euteleosts rendering Galaxiidae non-monophyletic also was proposed previously102 , 29 and supported by our data (see also Fig. 2).\n\nParacanthomorphacea: mitogenomics dixit (Fig. 1)\n\nThis name was first introduced as superorder Paracanthopterygii (sensu Greenwood et al.1) to refer to a large group of spiny-finned fishes that included Batrachoidiformes, Gadiformes (with Ophioidei and Zoarcoidei), Gobiesociformes, Lophiiformes, and Percopsiformes. Many other taxa were added and also removed on the basis of conflicting evidence ever since Paracanthopterygii was conceived, but a conservative stance persisted in classifications supporting the original circumscription, with the exclusion of Gobiesociformes2. More recently, mitogenomic data7 , 8 discovered a sister-group relationship between Zeiformes and Gadiformes, a result also obtained with nuclear genes 19 , 24 , 103; the name Zeioigadiformes24 was coined for this new grouping. Miya et al.11 redefined the Paracanthopterygii to include Polymixiidae, Percopsiformes, Gadiformes, and Zeioidei and subsequently Miya et al.13 added to this group the lampridiform genus Stylephorus, which was unexpectedly found to form the sister group of Gadiformes. Analysis of four nuclear markers in addition to mtDNA confirmed this result103, supporting a monophyletic taxon Paracanthopterygii that includes percopsiforms, gadiforms, Stylephorus (placed in its own order Stylephoriformes) and zeiforms, in agreement with our results (Fig. 1, 2). A review of published morphological characters by Borden et al.105 also found significant congruence between this arrangement and morphological character-state distributions for many of the proposed relationships.\n\nEuacanthomorphacea: holocentrids sister to percomorphs (Fig. 1)\n\nJohnson and Patterson4 included polymixiids, percopsids and crown acanthomorphs in their Euacanthopterygii, a taxon not classified by Wiley and Johnson5. We adopt the name but modify the circumscription to recognize a well-supported clade (99% bootstrap) that includes beryciforms, holocentrids and percomorphs. The main issue at this level is delimitation of Beryciformes and relationships of its proposed components to Percomorphaceae. Most classifications2 , 4 accept separate orders Stephanoberyciformes and Beryciformes, each monophyletic and placed as successive sister-groups of the percomorphs. Molecular data (mitogenomic and smaller subsets of nuclear genes), in contrast, have supported the inclusion of Stephanoberyciformes in the same clade as Beryciformes8 , 29 and consistently include holocentrids within this clade. Our results, however, reject this hypothesis in favor of recognizing a separate holocentrid clade (proposed here as a new order, Holocentriformes) that is sister to percomorphs (Fig. 1), a result first obtained by Stiassny and Moore75 and Moore 76 but subsequently challenged by Johnson and Patterson4. Despite relatively low support for our holocentrid-percomorph clade (57-69% bootstrap), proportionally more individual gene trees support this relationship (47%) relative to the alternative molecular hypothesis uniting holocentrids with the remaining beryciform groups (20%; Fig. 2). Our new circumscription of Beryciformes is also most similar to that of the order Trachichthyiformes described by Moore76, except that the latter excludes the berycids.\n\nPercomorphaceae: no longer an unresolved bush (Figs. 1-10)\n\nA major contribution from our study has been the disambiguation of the percomorph bush into nine well-supported supraordinal groups (six Series and three Subseries; Fig. 1; Appendix 2): Ophidiimorpharia, Batrachoidimorpharia, Gobiomorpharia (Fig. 3), Scombrimorpharia (Figs. 4 and 5), Carangimorpharia (with three Subseries: Anabantomorphariae, Fig. 6; Carangimorphariae, Fig. 7; and Ovalentariae, Fig. 8), and Percomorpharia (Figs. 9). Furthermore, increased phylogenetic resolution within Percomorpharia allowed the definition of a monophyletic Perciformes (Figs. 9 and 10), for the first time recovered from a vast taxonomic sample. With the exception of the cusk-eels (Ophidiimorpharia) and the toadfishes (Batrachoidimorpharia), whose monophyly has been recognized in most classifications (i.e., 2 , 5; but see 106 , 107), the remaining seven supraordinal clades (four Series and three Subseries) have never been discovered by examination of anatomical features. Under different combinations of taxa, however, and based on diverse genetic markers, several of these clades have been obtained, in one form or another, by previous molecular studies (e.g.,7 , 8 , 11 , 12 , 19 , 20 , 24 , 27 , 28 , 29 , 30 , 31 , 32 , 33).\n\nA corollary of the increased resolution of percomorph relationships is the demise of the Smegmamorpharia sensu Johnson and Patterson4 (see also Wiley and Johnson5; Fig. 2). Elements included in this supraordinal taxon are now scattered throughout the molecular phylogeny, placed within many of the newly found clades with high bootstrap support. For example, the pygmy sunfishes (Elassoma) are back with the other sunfishes (centrarchids), as suggested by earlier classifications and recently confirmed by molecules30. Centrarchids plus elassomatids are placed here in the resurrected order Centrarchiformes (within Percomorpharia, Fig. 9). Mugiliforms (mullets) and atherinomorphs (silversides, needlefishes, halfbeaks, guppies and allies) are placed within Ovalentariae (Fig. 8). The swamp eels and spiny eels (order Synbranchiformes, suborders Synbranchoidei and Mastacembeloidei) are placed with confidence in Anabantomorphariae (Fig. 5), together with armored sticklebacks (Indostomidae), one of the 11 families previously included in the order Gasterosteiformes. The polyphyly of Gasterosteiformes (another large clade assigned to Smegmamorpha) was first pointed out by mitogenomic evidence12. Our results place the sticklebacks, tubesnouts and sand eels (previously assigned to Gasterosteoidei) in our newly defined Perciformes (suborder Cottioidei; Fig. 10) and the rest of the families previously assigned to the suborder Syngnathoidei were relocated to our newly defined order Syngnathiformes within the Scombrimorpharia (Fig. 4, see below).\n\nPhylogenetic resolution within five newly discovered clades, however, will require additional study. Relationships within Syngnathiformes, Scombriformes, Carangimorphariae, Ovalentariae, and Percomorpharia may be challenging to recover given the rapid radiation and diversification of these clades.\n\nGobiomorpharia: sweepers are out (Fig. 3)\n\nBased on a phylogeny estimated with four mitochondrial markers, Thacker33 resurrected the order Gobiiformes, to accommodate three suborders: Gobioidei (gobies and sleepers), Kurtidoidei (nurseryfish), and Apogonoidei (including apogonids and pempherids). Previous molecular studies have shown affinities between gobioids, apogonids, kurtids and, to some extent, pempherids and dactylopterids8 , 11 , 16. There is also morphological evidence supporting a close relationship between gobids and apogonids108 , 109 as well as between kurtids and apogonids110. Our results provide partial support for the Gobiiformes sensu Thacker33 but we treat it here as a supraordinal group (Gobiomorpharia). A major difference is that our hypothesis segregates the family Pempheridae (sweepers) to its own order (Pempheriformes, together with Glaucosomatidae), within Percomorpharia (Figs. 1, 3, 9).\n\nScombrimorpharia: sea horses and tunas are close relatives (Figs. 1, 4 and 5)\n\nOne of the most unanticipated new percomorph clades is the Scombrimorpharia, grouping such disparate fishes as seahorses and tunas. This clade includes the newly circumscribed orders Syngnathiformes (Fig. 4) and Scombriformes (Fig. 5). Not surprisingly, a close relationship among taxa contained within this group, including syngnathids, mullids, callionymids, dactylopterids, scombrids, stromateids, an others, has never been proposed on morphological grounds. The Syngnathiformes, as defined here (Fig. 4), comprises mostly tropical marine reef-dwellers, traditionally placed in three distinct percomorph orders, including Gasterosteiformes (syngnathids), “Perciformes” (mullids and callionymids) and “Scorpaeniformes” (dactylopterids). Recent molecular studies have emphasized the non-monophyly of Scorpaeniformes74. We have noted above the dissolution of Gasterosteiformes12 and, as discussed below, we provide a restricted definition for Perciformes that includes many scorpaeniform taxa (Fig. 10).\n\nOur new order Scombriformes (Fig. 5) includes most of the families previously grouped in the perciform suborder Scombroidei2 or the order Scombriformes5, except for the barracudas (Sphyraenidae) and the billfishes and swordfishes (here placed in their own order, Istiophoriformes). Sphyraenidae and Istiophoriformes are now firmly placed within Carangimorphariae (Fig. 7) together with disparate taxa such as remoras (Echeneidae), archer fishes (Toxotidae), jacks (Carangidae), flatfishes (Pleuronectiformes), and others (see below). Because billfishes and tunas are not closely related as previously suggested by anatomical studies83 (Fig. 2), the new hypothesis implies that endothermy has evolved at least twice independently in teleosts111 , 112. This new circumscription of Scombriformes also comprises families belonging to multiple orders in previous classifications, such as Stromateiformes (Centrolophidae, Nomeidae, Ariommatidae, Stromateidae), Trachiniformes (Chiasmodontidae), Icosteiformes (Icosteidae), and Perciformes (Bramidae, Pomatomidae, and Caristiidae). Despite the disparate morphology among members of Scombriformes, most are offshore fishes that inhabit pelagic and/or deep-sea waters.\n\nAnabantomorphariae: freshwater and air breathing (Fig. 6)\n\nAnother major percomorph group proposed here is the series Carangimorpharia, including three subseries: Anabantomorphariae, Carangimorphariae, and Ovalentariae (Fig. 1). Species in Anabantomorphariae include representatives placed in three separate orders by Wiley and Johnson5: Synbranchiformes (swamp eels), Gasterosteiformes (Indostomus, the armored stickleback), and Anabantiformes (gouramis) (Fig. 6). While the first two orders belonged to the Smegmamorpharia4 , 5, the Anabantiformes were placed as incertae sedis in Percomorphacea5. The monophyly of Anabantomorphariae has also been supported on the basis of mitogenomics8 , 11 , 12 and nuclear markers28. A remarkable condition shared by members of this novel grouping is their mostly freshwater origin and restriction to Africa and South East Asia (although some members in the family Synbranchidae occur in Mexico, and Central and South America). Most are able to occupy marginal, stagnant waters due to their capacity to tolerate anoxia and to obtain oxygen directly from the air. Anabantiforms have a suprabranchial organ and synbranchids have suprabranchial pouches with respiratory function.\n\nCarangimorphariae: flatfishes and unlikely relatives (Fig. 7)\n\nA close affinity between other seemingly disparate groups, including barracudas, swordfishes, jacks, flatfishes, and others, has been well established by recent molecular studies10 , 16 , 19 , 24 , 27 , 28 , 112 (Fig. 7). This higher-level group has been referred to as ‘‘clade L’’ sensu Chen et al.19 or Carangimorpha by Li et al.24 (see also27 , 28). In looking for possible anatomical synapomorphies uniting flatfishes, billfishes, and carangids, Little et al.112 found that most taxa share a relatively low number of vertebrae, have multiple dorsal pterygiophores inserting before the second neural spine, and lack supraneurals, among others. However, according to Friedman113, some of these characters are symplesiomorphies while others are absent in the remaining carangimorph groups. It thus seems paradoxical that despite the apparent lack of morphological synapomorphies for carangimorphs there is a strong molecular signal supporting their monophyly, whereas the opposite is true for pleuronectiforms28. For additional insights and discussion on Carangimorphariae we refer the reader to recent studies24 , 27 , 28 , 112 , 113.\n\nOvalentariae: sticky eggs (Fig. 8)\n\nOvalentariae is one of the most spectacular percomorph radiations, including more than 5000 species in some 44 families, grouping seemingly distinct groups such as cichlids, mullets, blennies, and atherinomorphs (atheriniforms, beloniforms, and cyprinodontiforms). This clade was first found on the basis of mitogenomic evidence8 , 12 and later confirmed with nuclear sequence data23 , 24 , 26 , 31. Our results suggest that this group can be divided into four subgroups (superorders), two of which already existed (Atherninomorphae and Mugilomorphae) and two that are new: (i) Cichlomorphae (Cichlidae plus Pholidichthyidae) and (ii) Blennimorphae (blennioids plus clingfishes, jawfishes and basslets). Many families in Ovalentariae, however, remain incertae sedis (e.g., Embiotocidae and Pseudochromidae). Two different studies have coined a name for this group; first Stiassnyiformes by Li et al.24 and, more recently, Ovalentaria by Wainwright et al.31 for their characteristic demersal, adhesive eggs with chorionic filaments (lost secondarily in some groups). An interesting implication of this phylogenetic hypothesis is that the pharyngeal jaw apparatus (pharyngognathy), present in many members of this clade (e.g., Cichlidae, Pomacentridae, Hemiramphidae), has evolved multiple times in percomorphs31. We refer the reader to Wainwright et al.31 for additional discussion on Ovalentariae.\n\nPercomorpharia: the new bush at the top (Fig. 9)\n\nPercomorpharia is by far the largest percomorph clade, including 11 orders with some of the most prominent ones such as Perciformes, Labriformes, Lophiiformes, and Tetraodontiformes. At least 151 families (105 examined) belong in Percomorpharia, including three of the top ten most diverse families of fishes (i.e., Labridae, Serranidae, and Scorpaenidae)2. More than one third (514) of the species in our bony fish phylogeny are placed in this clade. Previous molecular studies obtained monophyletic groups with a combination of taxa here assigned to Percomorpharia, but with far more limited sampling (e.g., 8 , 11 , 16 , 74). Although most family-level and ordinal groups within Percomorpharia receive high bootstrap support, interrelationships among them are largely unresolved (hence, the new bush at the top; Fig. 9). Several of these groups are newly proposed or resurrected orders under new circumscription (e.g., Uranoscopiformes, Ephippiformes, Pempheriformes). Our new arrangement removes anglerfishes (Lophiiformes) from Paracanthomorphacea, as was suggested by previous classifications78, and places them close to tetraodontiforms, caproids, acanthuriforms, chaetodontids, pomacanthids, ephippids and others (see also 87 , 114 , 115). The largest group within Percomorpharia is the order Perciformes.\n\nPerciformes: no longer a taxonomic waste basket (Fig. 10)\n\nFor the first time, a monophyletic definition of Perciformes can be recovered from phylogenetic analysis of a comprehensive taxon sampling. The new circumscription of Perciformes reduces significantly the number of included taxa, while retaining remarkable diversity that can be organized into several suborders and infraorders. Nelson’s classification2 included 160 families in Perciformes, making it the largest order of all vertebrates. Our definition indicates unambiguous membership for 38 families and uncertain membership for an additional 42 that were not examined in our study but that have been assigned to either “Perciformes” (10), “Scorpaeniformes” (14), Cottiformes (8), or Trachiniformes (1) in previous classifications2 , 5. Hence, the maximum possible number of families in the newly defined Perciformes is reduced to 71. This number is closer to the 90 families proposed by Wiley and Johnson5 for their Perciformes, but with a very different composition.\n\nFor a long time, Perciformes has been regarded as a “taxonomic waste basket”2 , 5 with ‘‘percoids’’ scattered throughout Percomorpha and no clear phylogenetic distinction among Percoidei, Perciformes, and Percomorpha74. Earlier molecular studies lacked sufficient sampling to resolve phylogenetic questions among “percoids,” but close relationships among groupers (Serranidae), perches (Percidae), sticklebacks (Gasterosteidae), searobins (Triglidae), icefishes (Notothenioidei), sculpins (Cottoidei), eelpouts (Zoarcoidei) and scorpionfishes (Scorpaenoidei) have been obtained in one form or another, and in different combinations, by several authors16 , 19 , 20 , 23 , 24 , 29 , 74 , 116. All of these taxa are included in our definition of Perciformes (Fig. 10).\n\nWithin Perciformes, we tentatively propose suborders (Notothenioidei, Scorpaenoidei, Trigloidei, Cottoidei) for clades with high support that also represent some well-established groups, but two incertae sedis (Percophidae and Platycephalidae), and several unexamined families remain unclassified. Additional taxon sampling and more data are needed to resolve interrelationships among these taxa. Four suborders/infraorders were recognized as separate orders by Wiley and Johnson5: Percoidei, Scorpaenoidei, Cottioidei, and Gasterosteales (an infraorder of Cottioidei).\n\nThe composition of Perciformes obtained from our phylogeny is remarkably similar to a group named “Serraniformes” by Li et al.24. This choice of name is misleading, given that Percidae is included and serranids have historically been considered a family within Perciformes. Adoption of Serraniformes would obliterate the long ichthyological tradition of defining higher taxa with the prefix “perco” for hierarchical groups that contain perciforms (preserved in our classification). Most recently, the same team of researchers (Lautredou et al.116) presented a detailed analysis of this clade using seven nuclear markers and obtained phylogenetic relationships that are generally congruent with our results (Fig. 10), albeit they support a close relationship of Percophidae with notothenioids and divide platycephaloids into three groups. We refer the reader to this paper, as well as others (e.g., Smith and Wheeler16; Smith and Craig74), for more details on taxonomic issues.\n\nA New Timescale of Bony Fish Evolution\n\nIn addition to the novel insights regarding the interrelationships of teleost fishes, our study provides the most comprehensively sampled time-tree of bony fish evolution based on 60 calibrations points (Figs. 1, 11). Recent studies that estimated divergence times using multi-locus nuclear approaches had more restricted taxonomic focus and implemented fewer (<36) fossil calibrations29 , 66. The time-calibrated phylogeny for bony fishes provided here should stimulate macroevolutionary studies of fishes using phylogenetic comparative methods (PCMs).\n\nAlthough our approach for calibrating the molecular phylogeny is based on a set of common fossil constraints used by the cited studies and others64 , 65, some differences in the results are evident (Fig. 12). Our estimates of mean divergence dates for early actinopterygian lineages tend to be younger and the divergence of neoteleosts and subtending clades are substantially older relative to those in Near et al.29 (although 95% probability distributions overlap in many cases). Sensitivity of molecular calibrations to different combinations of taxa, molecular markers, and fossil constraints have been discussed extensively by several authors, suggesting that development of better statistical methods and best practice approaches should decrease disparity among estimated ages of clades43 , 118 , 119. Compared to earlier studies reporting divergence times among teleost lineages35 , 36 , 37 , 120 , 121 , 41, estimates based on multi-locus data and denser taxonomic sampling tend to converge (Fig. 11), suggesting that the current trend to analyze larger data sets with well established fossil constraints will result in robust time trees in the future.\n\nThe date estimates presented herein (Figs 1, 2-11, and the OneZoom tree) confirm the notion that divergences of major ray-finned fish lineages are considerably older than the oldest known fossils for their respective groups29 , 66. Our estimate of 425 Ma for divergence of crown Osteichthyes places the origin of Sarcopterygii and Actinopterygii in the Middle Silurian, with the sarcopterygian crown group evolving in the Early Devonian (409 Ma) and the actinopterygian crown group evolving at the Middle-Late boundary of the Devonian (383 Ma), both of which correspond to the “Age of Fishes”. Although the oldest teleost fossils are from the late Triassic (e.g., †Pholidophorus latiusculus, Norian122), the molecular hypothesis suggests that the initial divergence of crown group Teleostei occurred long before in the Early Permian (283 Ma). Appearance of the three major teleost lineages (Elopomorpha, Osteoglossomorpha and Clupeocephala) took place in a narrow temporal window of 13 million years during this period. Paleoecological conditions surrounding the end Permian mass extinction, which resulted in extinction of up to 96% of all marine species of that time123, might have shaped the evolutionary history of early teleosts.\n\nRecent work suggested that a major burst of teleost diversification, predominantly within Otophysa and Percomorphacea, took place in a relatively short time span between the late Mesozoic and early Cenozoic29 , 124. Patterns in the fossil record corroborate this idea, revealing an explosive morphological diversification of percomorphs in the aftermath of the end-Cretaceous extinction125. According to our estimates, however, the major lineages within Percomorphaceae (Ophidiiformes, Batrachoidiformes, Gobiomorpharia, Scombrimorpharia, Carangimorpharia, Percomorpharia and Perciformes) originated between 132 Ma and 82 Ma, before the end of the Cretaceous. The same is true for the diversification of many lineages within each of these groups, but explicit analyses using robust PCMs would be necessary to assess rate shifts of lineage diversification through time.\n\nRemaining Challenges and Unresolved Issues\n\nThe new shape of the tree of life of bony fishes and the classification reflecting this structure offered by this study leaves many questions unanswered and suggests several directions for future sequencing efforts. Many families not included in the present analysis are listed in the classification and many groups defined as incertae sedis or sedis mutabilis clearly deserve additional study. Relationships for many terminal taxa, such as those within the rapid percomorph radiations, are often poorly resolved, have low bootstrap support, or have dubious resolution due to the combination of missing data, taxon sampling, and or other sources of systematic error. The relatively high proportion of missing data in the 3+ dataset (59%) is likely to have a stronger topological impact at the fine scale (towards the tips); e.g., two sister taxa with little or no genetic overlapping may not be resolved as closely related. Another major factor that may severely compromise phylogenetic inference is compositional heterogeneity (non-stationarity), in particular for gene trees, as suggested by a recent study that examined a fraction of the taxa and markers included here28. Unfortunately, efficient non-stationary approaches to analyze large and heterogeneous multi-locus data sets such as the one presented here currently are not available. Fish orders with dubious internal relationships include the Characiformes, Gymnotiformes, Lophiiformes, Pleuronectiformes, Carangiformes, among others."
