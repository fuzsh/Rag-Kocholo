Spawn at great depths and die Leptocephalus larvae “migrate” to coastal waters, and metamorphose into elvers Anguilliformes, Clupeids, and Engraulids\n\n7 Spawning Sites Anguilliformes, Clupeids, and Engraulids\n\n8 Moray Eels Efficient predators on reefs and rocky shores\n\nPreys on inverts and fish Teeth are always on display since they have to hold their mouth open to breathe May exceed 9ft. rarely > 3ft. Anguilliformes, Clupeids, and Engraulids\n\n9 Conger Eels Resemble morays Most prey on inverts Garden eels\n\nHave pectoral fins and stout cone shaped teeth Most prey on inverts Garden eels Feed on plankton and often mistaken as seagrass Garden Eels Anguilliformes, Clupeids, and Engraulids\n\n10 Snake Eels Largest of all eel families\n\nSmall in size (<3ft.) and brightly colored Rarely seen, due to burrowing and nocturnal behavior Anguilliformes, Clupeids, and Engraulids\n\n11 Family Clupeidae (Herrings)\n\nIncludes: Herrings, Shads, Sardines, and Menhaden Live in well-lit surface waters School Feed on plankton DMF Website Anguilliformes, Clupeids, and Engraulids\n\n12 Clupeidae Characteristics\n\nSilvery scales and compressed body Flexible mouth, with fine gill rakers Play key roles in many food webs Highly abundant, ability to feed on plankton Anguilliformes, Clupeids, and Engraulids\n\n13 Clupeidae Characteristics\n\nConcentrate in coastal waters Many species are not harvested for direct consumption Important prey items for other commercially important species Several anadromous species Gizzard shad American Shad Anguilliformes, Clupeids, and Engraulids\n\n14 Atlantic Menhaden (Brevoortia tyrannus)\n\nImportant commercial fishery on the East coast Omega protein Anguilliformes, Clupeids, and Engraulids\n\n15 Purse Seine Anguilliformes, Clupeids, and Engraulids\n\n16 American Shad (Alosa sapidissima)\n\nAnadromous species Spawn all over the East coast Female spawns over 600,000 eggs Valuable for the roe Anguilliformes, Clupeids, and Engraulids\n\n17 Common Clupeids Atlantic Thread Herring (Opisthonema oglinum)\n\nRound Herring (Etrumeus teres) Anguilliformes, Clupeids, and Engraulids\n\n18 Family Engraulidae Small, (<15cm.) filter feeder\n\nInhabit inshore waters where plankton densities are highest Distinguished by inferior mouth Like Clupeids, numbers fluctuate due to fishing pressure and oceanographic conditions Striped Anchovy Anchoa hepsetus Anguilliformes, Clupeids, and Engraulids"
