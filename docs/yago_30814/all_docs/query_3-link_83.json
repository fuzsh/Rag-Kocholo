        "text": "Obituary: DYMM Paduka Seri Almarhum Sultan Azlan Muhibbuddin Shah\n\nSULTAN PERAK KE-34 MANGKAT\n\nHis majesty Sultan Azlan Shah passed away on 28 May 2014. He leaves behind a wife Tuanku Bainun bt Mohd Ali (81), a crown prince Raja Dr Nazrin Shah (58) and 3 princesses. A second prince Raja Ashman Shah had passed away in 2012 - he was with the Haqqani Foundation, a sufi group. All the princes and princesses are married and have children.\n\nBIRTH\n\nPrince Azlan Shah was born on 19 April 1928 at Kg Manggis, Batu Gajah in Perak, the youngest prince of Sultan Sir Yussuf Shah and his second wife, Hajah Khadijah bt Dato' Sri Ahmad.\n\nEDUCATION\n\nPrince Azlan Shah received his early education at the Government English School in Batu Gajah before he attended the Malay College in Kuala Kangsar. Raja Azlan Shah then continued his studies overseas at the University of Nottingham (Hon DCL) and at Lincoln’s Inn in London. He obtained the Barr-at-Law in 1954.\n\nGOVERNMENT SERVICE\n\nHe returned to serve in the Malayan Government Service.\n\n1954-1955 : Assistant State Secretary of Perak\n\n1955-1956 : First Class Magistrate\n\n1957-1959 : President of Sessions Court\n\n1959 : Federal Legal Counsel and DPP for Perak\n\n1959-1961 : Legal Advisor in Pahang\n\n1961-1962 : Legal Advisor in Johor\n\n1962-1963 : Registrar of the High Court of Malaya\n\n1963-1965 : Chief Registrar Federal Court\n\n1965-1973 : Judge High Court\n\n1973-1978 : Judge Federal Court\n\n1974-1976 : Chair Higher Education Advisory Council\n\n1979-1982 : Chief Justice\n\n1982-1984 : Lord President of the High Court\n\nHe received the Honorary Bencher from Lincoln’s Inn in 1988.\n\nHe was the Royal Patron of The Malaysian Law Society in Great Britain and Eire, and the British Graduates Association of Malaysia.\n\nTHE PERAK THRONE\n\nThe Perak royalty is linked to the ancient Malacca Sultanate and the Siak Sultanate, both have origins in Sumatra.\n\nRaja Azlan Shah ascended to the Perak throne via a predetermined sequential royal appointment that is unique to the Perak royal household. It consists of a series of posts, each is held by an eligible prince. A prince moves up the serial posts when the one above it becomes vacant (as in death of a prince).\n\nA prince starts his appointment as Raja Kechil Bongsu, and then becomes Raja Kechil Tengah, Raja Kechil Sulong, and Raja Kechil Besar, before he becomes the Heir Apparent, Raja Muda.\n\nIn old B/W landscape photographs of the Perak royal household, these 5 princes appear with the ruling sultan, his wife, and palace guests.\n\nRaja Azlan Shah first became Raja Kechil Bongsu in 1962, and finally became the Raja Muda in 1983 (21 years).\n\nRaja Kechil Bongsu : 19 August 1962\n\nRaja Kechil Tengah : 1 March 1963\n\nRaja Kechil Sulong : 1 January 1978\n\nRaja Kechil Besar : 1 August 1978\n\nRaja Muda : 1 July 1983\n\nBELANGSUNGKAWA\n\nThe Perak royal tradition follows the Malacca Sultanate at Johor-Riau-Lingga, whereby the incoming sultan must be announced before the burial of the deceased sultan can take place.\n\nRaja Azlan Shah ascended to the Perak throne when his cousin passed away on 31 January 1984. Sultan Azlan Shah was proclaimed at Ipoh on 3 February 1984, and crowned at Istana Kinta in Kuala Kangsar on 9 December 1985.\n\nKING OF MALAYSIA\n\nSultan Azlan Shah became Timbalan Yang di-Pertuan Agung (Deputy King) in 1984, before he became Yang di-Pertuan Agung (King) in 1989. Dr Mahathir Mohamad was the Prime Minister of Malaysia during this time (1983-2003).\n\nTimbalan Yang di-Pertuan Agung : 9 February 1984\n\nInstalled at Istana Negara in Kuala Lumpur : 29 April 1984\n\n(5-year term : 1984-1989)\n\nYang di-Pertuan Agung : 2 March 1989\n\nCrowned at Istana Negara in Kuala Lumpur : 26 April 1989\n\n(5-year term : 1989-1994)\n\nCompleted term as Agung : 25 April 1994\n\n(Total term served at Federal level : 10 years)\n\nAfter serving their term as the King and Queen of Malaysia, Sultan Azlan Shah and Tuanku Bainun returned to Perak in 1994. They continued to rule Perak as Sultan and Permaisuri.\n\nKING'S MILITARY APPOINTMENTS\n\nAs the King of Malaysia, Sultan Azlan Shah was in charge of the Malaysian Army (Angkatan Tentera Malaysia, ATM), Royal Malaysian Navy (Tentera Laut Diraja Malaysia, TLDM) and Royal Malaysian Air Force (Tentera Udara Diraja Malaysia, TUDM).\n\nHe was the Field Marshal of the Malaysian Army (ATM), Admiral of the Royal Malaysian Navy TLDM), and Marshal of the Royal Malaysian Air Force (TUDM) (26 April 1989-25 April 1994).\n\nSULTAN'S MILITARY APPOINTMENT\n\nAs the Sultan of Perak, he was the Col-in-Chief of the Royal Malay Regiment (Regimen Askar Melayu Diraja, RAMD) (1997-2014).\n\nENGINEERING APPOINTMENT\n\nAs the Sultan of Perak, he was the Col-in-Chief of the Royal Regiment of Engineers (1997-2014).\n\nACADEMIC APPOINTMENTS & AWARDS\n\nRaja Azlan Shah was the Pro-Chancellor of Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM 1971-1984) and was the recipient of the Honorary Doctorate of Letters & Literature (Hon DLL).\n\nHe was the Chancellor of Universiti Malaya (UM 1986) and received the Honorary Doctor of Literature (Hon D.Lit.)\n\nIn 1990, he was the recipient of 3 Honorary DCL from 3 ASEAN universities - Gajah Mada University, Brunei University, and Chulalongkorn University.\n\nPro-Chancellor USM : 1971-1984 (Hon DLL)\n\nChancellor UM : 1986 (Hon D.Lit.)\n\nGajah Mada U, Brunei U, Chulalongkorn U : 1990 (Hon DCL)\n\nMEDICAL APPOINTMENTS, MEMBERSHIPS & PATRONAGE\n\nSultan Azlan Shah was appointed an Honorary Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians (Dublin), Royal College of Surgeons of England, Edinburgh, and Dublin (undated).\n\nHe was a Royal Patron of the Academy of Medicine of Malaysia (AMM).\n\nHe was a Royal Patron of the St John Ambulance Association of Perak (1984-2014).\n\nHOCKEY APPOINTMENTS & PATRONAGE\n\nIn sports, Sultan Azlan Shah was mostly associated with hockey.

She is a year younger than my mother Tulip bt Che Lah (born in Kuala Lumpur 4 November 1931). Tulip's father was Dr Che Lah b Md Joonos, an early Malay doctor who served as a Hajj Doctor for the Malayan hajj pilgrimages in the 1950s-1960s. Bainun was educated at the St George's School at Residency Road, near Padang Polo and the Penang General Hospital (GH Penang). She would be a junior to the late Datuk Zubaidah Ariff who also attended the same school before WWII began in Penang. Datuk Zubaidah married to Datuk Mushir Ariff, and was the daughter-in-law of Sir Dr Kamil Ariff, an early Malay doctor in Penang\n\nTHE KIRKBY TEACHERS\n\nBainun then attended the Malayan Teachers’ Training College in Kirkby, Lancshire in England in the early 1950s.\n\nTulip and Bainun were in the same teachers' college at Kirkby and played hockey together on the same team. Tulip was the hockey captain. I don't know what position Bainun played. There is a photo of their hockey team at Kirkby. Bainun's room was across from Tulip's room. According to my late mother, news of Bainun's marriage to Raja Azlan Shah was buzzing at Kirkby well before the marriage itself. Another lady, Yasmin Hanoum bt Dr Kamil Ariff was also at Kirkby with Tulip and Bainun. Another lady at Kirkby would be Sarah bt Dr Sulaiman. Most of the surviving graduates of Kirkby meet at their Kirkby reunion in Malaysia where Tan Sri Dr Yahaya Ibrahim is chairman. Many of the Kirkby graduate teachers of the first (1951-1953) and second batch (1952-1954) have passed away. The Kirkbyites have their own website.\n\nTulip and Bainun were in touch till the early 1980s.\n\nUNION\n\nRaja Azlan Shah married Che Bainun bt Muhammad 'Ali on 9 December 1955 in Georgetown, Penang.\n\nWhen Raja Azlan Shah ascended to the Perak throne, Bainun's name was styled H.R.H. Tuanku Bainun binti Muhammad ‘Ali. She was installed at Istana Kinta, Kuala Kangsar as Raja Permaisuri on 9 December 1985.\n\nWhen Sultan Azlan Shah became the King of Malaysia (Agung), she was installed as Raja Permaisuri Agong on 19 February 1988 in Kuala Lumpur with her name styled Her Majesty.\n\nThe couple returned to Perak on 25 April 1994, after Sultan Azlan Shah completed his term as Agung.\n\nCHILDREN\n\nThe royal couple has 5 children, 2 princes and 3 princesses.\n\nH.H. Raja Datuk Sri Nazrin Shah bin Sultan ‘Azlan Shah (Raja Muda) succeeded his father as H.R.H. Maulana Paduka Sri Tuanku Sultan Nazrin Muizz ud-din Shah ibni al-Marhum Sultan ‘Azlan Muhib ud-din Shah, Sultan and Yang di-Pertuan of Perak Dar ur-Ridzwan.\n\nY.A.M. Raja Datuk Sri Ashman Shah ibni al-Marhum Sultan ‘Azlan Muhib ud-din Shah (Raja Kechil Sulong) (deceased 30 March 2012). His father-in-law is Kamarul Ariffin bin Muhammad Yassin. His son Y.M.

He was 86 years old.\n\nROYAL FUNERAL & BURIAL\n\nThe funeral followed that of the Malacca Sultanate. The corpse was allowed a public display before the swearing in of the next sultan. Then the remains of the sultan was carried by several strong army personnel to the burial site. Sultan Azlan Shah was laid to rest after Solat Asar on 29 May 2014. Army and palace personnel and officials were involved with the burial procedures (refer to ASTRO Awani TV footage and posts & photos by royal family members/relatives in Facebook).\n\nHe is interred at Al-Ghufran Royal Cemetery adjacent to Masjid Ubudiyah at Bukit Chandan in Kuala Kangsar.
