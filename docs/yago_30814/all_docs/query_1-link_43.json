        "text": "The State of Perak is one of the States of Malaya which still retains its hereditary rulers. It is located north of the State of Selangor and shares land borders with Pulau Pinang, Kedah and Kingdom of Thailand in the north, with Kelantan and Pahang in the east. The Sultanate was founded in 1528 by the first son of Sultan Mahmud Shah of Malacca, Sultan Muzaffar Shah by invitation from local leaders. The ruler of Perak is address to as His Royal Highness Sultan of Perak.\n\nThe incumbent Sultan of Perak is HRH Sultan Nazrin Muizzuddin Shah ibni Almarhum Sultan Azlan Muhibbuddin Shah. He is the 35th Sultan of Perak. He ascended the throne on 28th May 2014 and officially proclaimed at Istana Iskandariah, Kuala Kangsar on 29th May 2014.\n\nThe consort to the Sultan of Perak is styled according to her bloodline. Royal-born consort through a male line is addressed to as HRH Raja Perempuan of Perak. While a commoner-born consort is addressed to as HRH Raja Permaisuri of Perak. They are not automatically styled Queen upon the ascension of their husband to the throne and subject through proclamation. The incumbent is HRH Raja Permaisuri Tuanku Zara binti Salim Davidson on 29th May 2014.\n\nHISTORY\n\nThe State of Perak since its foundation in 1528 has been ruled by two royal houses. The first was the descendant of Malaccan Royalty and the second is the House of Siak. The first Sultan of Perak was Sultan Muzaffar Shah I who came to Perak by invitation by local leaders to rule Perak. Nine sultans have ruled Perak descended from the Malaccan Royalty. The State has witness series of invasion from Sultanate Acheh Darussalam. The first attack was during the reign of Sultan Mansur Syah I where Perak became the colony of Acheh. The first son of Sultan Mansur Syah I was married to the Princess of Acheh and later ascended the throne of Acheh as Sultan Alauddin Mansur Syah. Several other descendants of Perak ruled the State until Sultan Salahuddin ascended the throne. Sultanate of Perak was attacked by cholera which the Sultan also one of the victims and died of it in Acheh. He was the last Sultan of Perak who is the descendant of Malaccan Royalty.\n\nAfter the death of Sultan Salahuddin, Sultan Iskandar Thani of Acheh sent Raja Sulong of Siak to ruled Perak. He later was proclaimed as Sultan Muzaffar Syah II. He is the first Sultan of Perak from the House of Siak. The State of Perak received her second intervention from outsider during the reign of Sultan Muzaffar Syah III, and in this time from the Bugis clan. The Bugis led by Daeng Chelak invade the State, resulted Perak to be separated into two part, North Perak and South Perak. They proclaimed the Sultan's younger brother, Sultan Muhammad Syah of South Perak. The State was reunited when the two brothers reconcile with one another.\n\nThe State of Perak received her third foreign intervention during the reign of Sultan Ahmadin Shah when the Sultanate of Selangor invaded Perak. The direct descendant of Sultan Ahmadin Shah still ruled the State till this day. Perak received her fourth foreign intervention during the reign of Sultan Abdul Malik Mansur Syah, where Kedah and Kingdom of Siam invaded Perak, bringing a conflict with Selangor. The fifth intervention from foreign power was during the reign of Sultan Abdullah Muhammad Syah II. A series of succession crisis have led the Sultanate into a civil war. To declare himself as the true Sultan, he signed the Pangkor Treaty 1874 with the British and ruled in Batak Rabit. J.W.W Birch was the Sultanate first British Resident in Perak.\n\nThe State was a member of Federated Malay States and later a member of Federation of Malaya which was founded on 1st February 1948. It receives its independence through Federation of Malaya on 31st August 1957. On 16th September 1963, States of Malaya alongside State of Singapore, State of Sarawak and State of Sabah founded the new federation called as Malaysia.\n\nROYAL FAMILY\n\nSultan Nazrin Muizzuddin Syah marry Tuanku Zara Salim Davidson and their marriage was blessed with 2 children, a prince and a princess.\n\n1.) Raja Azlan Muzaffar Syah (14 March 2008)\n\n2.) Raja Nazira Safya (3 August 2011)\n\nPALACE\n\nThe Official Palace to the Sultan of Perak is the Istana Iskandariah located in the Royal City Kuala Kangsar, Perak.\n\nINHERITANCE\n\nThe rule of succession of Perak is the most complicated among all Malay States. To inherit the throne of Perak, one must be :-\n\n1.) A male heir who is the direct descendant of 17th Sultan of Perak. (Known as Waris Negeri)\n\n2.) A muslim by faith.\n\n3.) Appointed by the Dewan Negara of Perak (Royal Council of Perak)\n\nBy appointment by the Dewan Negara of Perak, the Waris Negeri will be known as Waris Negeri Kanan who is the Inheritance Prince lining in the line of succession. The State of Perak provided only 6 places in the line of succession and each position will be addressed to as follows :-\n\n1.) Raja Muda of Perak, The Heir Apparent\n\n2.) Raja Di-Hiler of Perak, The 2nd in line to the throne\n\n3.) Raja Kechil Besar of Perak, The 3rd in line to the throne\n\n4.) Raja Kechil Sulong, The 4th in line to the throne\n\n5.)

(vacant), Raja Kechil Bongsu\n\nMore of the line of succession can be refer here : Line of Succession of Perak.\n\nGALERIA\n\nSome of the picture of the royal family :-\n\nDuring the proclamation of Sultan Nazrin Muizzuddin Shah.\n\nHis Royal Highness the Sultan of Perak, Sultan Azlan Shah had died at National Heart Institute last May 28, 2014. He was 86 years old. His Royal Highness ascended to the throne of Perak in 1984 and has celebrated his silver jubilee celebration of his reign in 2009. Sultan Azlan Shah unlike any royalties in his time, was the first Sultan in the history of Malaysia who has an exceptional achievement in his education. After ruling the State of Perak for glorious 30 years, the Sultan's life peacefully comes to an end. The official announcement of the death of the Sultan was announce by the Perak's Menteri Besar, Datuk Seri Dr. Zambry Abd Kadir. Sultan Azlan Shah was survived by his consort, the Raja Permaisuri Bainun, a son and three daughters.\n\nAfter the death of the Sultan, the Dewan Negara of Perak (Perak's Royal Council) has convened to choose a successor. Unique to Perak and the one of its kind in the world, the rules of succession of Perak reserved 6 places in the line of succession and the position is open to all descendant of the 17th Sultan of Perak (known as Waris Negeri). The Perak Royal Council has the power to appoint among the Waris Negeri to become the Inheritance Prince also known as Waris Negeri Kanan. Thus, resulted the heir to the throne comes from various descendants of previous Sultan of Perak and the son to the monarch is commonly will not inherit the throne directly from his father. Nevertheless, as if fate is besides the Raja Muda, the Perak Royal Council had chose Raja Dr Nazrin Shah ibni Almarhum Sultan Azlan Shah as the 35th Sultan of Perak and is styled as Sultan Nazrin Muizzuddin Shah. According to history, when Sultan Azlan Muhibbudin Shah ascended the throne of Perak, Raja Dr Nazrin was the third in line to the throne. And it only takes him 3 years before he is the first in line styled as Raja Muda (Crown Prince of Perak).\n\nAs the new Sultan reign starts, the State of Perak witness the beginning of the new era. In comparison with another Malay States, the journey of the new Sultan in his path to the throne is full with custom and tradition that he must fulfill before his official Installation as the Sultan of Perak. Congratulation to His Royal Highness Sultan Nazrin Muizzuddin Shah on his accession to the throne.\n\nDAULAT TUANKU\n\nLONG LIVE THE KING\n\n13th May has always been a dark history for Malaysia due to racial tension that occur in Kuala Lumpur. It resulted the State of Emergency to be announced. One fascinating thing about history is that, its always repeated itself. Even though it is not as severe as racial tension, 13th May 2014 marks the dark episode in the State of Terengganu when the State's face its second constitutional crisis for the second time in just over a period of 5 years. The crisis was triggered after the State witness the appointment of the new Menteri Besar, the State Assemblymen of Seberang Takir, Datuk Ahmad Razif bin Abd Rahman replacing Datuk Ahmad Said. The sworn-in ceremony was held at Syarqiyyah Palace before His Royal Highness Sultan Mizan Zainal Abidin of Terengganu late in the evening.\n\nAfter the sworn-in ceremony, the former Menteri Besar announced his resignation as an UMNO's members and becoming an Independent Assemblymen in the State's Assembly. His action later were followed by 2 other State Assemblymen resulted Barisan Nasional suffered a minor seat back. In the last General Election, Barisan Nasional manage to secure 17 seats out of 32 State Assembly contested seat. When 3 members of BN becoming Independent, Barisan Nasional at the time becoming a minority with only 14 seats, losing to the opposition Pakatan Rakyat who has 15 seats. The outcome of BN would face a vote of no confidence and the new Menteri Besar becoming the shortest serving Menteri Besar in Malaysia history was alarming.\n\nMeanwhile, Terengganu's Pakatan Rakyat led by Tuan Guru Datuk Seri Abdul Hadi Awang only taking \"wait and see\" stance regarding the issue. The social websites at the time were buzzing with the prospect of the new PR Government rise in power in Terengganu. Nevertheless, much of PR's supporters were in favour of a new fresh State's Election rather that seeing a coalition government with the Independents. In addition, Datuk Seri Abdul Hadi Awang also have a faith to the reigning Sultan Mizan Zainal Abidin who have the capability to steer the State in the troubled time. This is the fifth Menteri Besar in the reign of Sultan Mizan Zainal Abidin since his accession to the throne in 1998. In 1999 and 2004 respectively, Datuk Seri Abdul Hadi Awang and Datuk Seri Idris Jusoh were both appointed as Menteri Besar without much of a problem. The first constitution crisis occurs in 2008, when the palace has lost favour of Datuk Seri Idris Jusoh and appointing Datuk Seri Ahmad Said instead.\n\nWhile the people seeing the crisis with much anticipation, it is still certain the BN Government still standing when the Speaker of the State Assembly using his prerogative to side with BN and that increase the numbers of BN in the Assembly to 15-3-15 in par to that of PR and Independent (with much resentment from the public). After a week, the Independent Assemblymen has announced rejoined back UMNO and the majority of BN in the State Assembly is secured. The new Menteri Besar did also announced that his administration will retain the line set by his former. Probably so that the crisis will end on a soft ground. In election 2013, it is said that Datuk Seri Ahmad Said will have a troublesome time after the election to steer the State after witnessing several bad omen, it looks like they were right after all.\n\nThe implementation of Islamic Law of Hudud and Qisas in Malaysia has always been a sensitive and controversial topic. Since the independent of Malaya in 1957 and after the formation of Malaysia in 1963, Malaysia by its constitution has always been a secular country even though Islam has been acknowledge as the official religion of the federation. Malaysia is a multi-cultural and multi-religious society where Muslim only formed around 60% of its population. Due to the fact that Malaysia's colossal neigbour, Indonesia where more than 80% of its population are Muslims does not implement Hudud, gives Malaysia's leaders a good scapegoat to not implement Hudud in Malaysia, and always been stated that Malaysia is not conducive for Hudud to be implement. Until now that is, especially when Malaysia's small neighbour, Brunei Darussalam have announced the implementation of Hudud starting officially on May 1, 2014. Even though small in size, the demographic of Brunei is similar to Malaysia where there exist a sizable numbers of non-muslim population.\n\nThe fight to establish an Islamic State in Malaysia has started as early in 1940s during the time of Hizbul Muslimin. The mission is now still continued throughout the pre-independent period of Malaya by Pan-Malayan Islamic Party (PAS) and until now, it is still stated in the party's constitution and currently the sole fighter in Malaysia whom fights to establish an Islamic State in Malaysia. The implementation of Hudud in Brunei gives sudden momentum to PAS to implement Hudud in one of Malaysia's State, Kelantan. Kelantan since 1959 has always been PAS, and after the State falls to PAS again in 1990, the State has become the only State in Malaysia which still retains a strong conservative Islamic-Malay influence, also known as 'Serambi Kaabah' or the veil of Kaabah. And the announcement by His Majesty the Sultan of Brunei of Hudud implementation in Brunei has gain PAS's momentum of political will where PAS's MP wants to proceed of Hudud implementation in Kelantan through a Private Member Bill in Malaysia's Parliament this August.\n\nEven though PAS MP does not represents even a plurality in Parliament, the other Malay party which still have a strong Malay support, UMNO have announced that it has never against Hudud and will support it when the Bill is presented in the Parliament. Meanwhile, other non-malay based parties specially DAP and MCA has announced openly that they are against Hudud. Nevertheless, MCA depleted numbers of seats in Parliament and even doesn't have any representatives in the Prime Minister's Najib administration left DAP as the only strong voice that against Hudud. The outcomes is extraordinary almost win situation for Hudud implementation where the combination of UMNO-PAS only needs another 4 MPs supports to gain Simple Majority support (if Sabah's UMNO members are in favour of the bill).\n\nThe public on the other hand have mixed feelings for the implementation. Most of the Malays are in favour of the bill, especially with the successful hudud's implementation in Acheh and Brunei. Meanwhile the non-malays are against the implementation, even though several factions are in favour of public sentences of hudud.\n\nPersonal Opinion\n\nFor me, the idea of Hudud Implementation should be not limited in Kelantan, but should covers at least all the Malays States of Kelantan, Terengganu, Pahang, Johor, Negeri Sembilan, Selangor, Perak, Kedah and Perlis. I am in favour of the Bill not just because I am a Muslim, but also because this is the only laws that can ascertain the safety of the community as a whole. Human Rights activist has always against the Islamic Laws under the name violates the human rights, but, for me, the laws is the only laws that can ascertain my rights as a citizens.\n\nFor example, thieves who sentences in Islamic Law for stealing, his hand will be cut. But, it is not as easy as that to cut someone's hand. His acts must also by his own free will, not mentally ill, not because of desperation, and there must be a certain value of the stealed properties equal to the value of certain amount of gold, as must be in a well-protected place. If one of the requirements is not met, the Hudud sentences will be drop and he will be sentence by Ta'zir (other sentences stated by act) law. Whether or not we have the political wills to do it, lets us pray and look in the upcoming Parliament Seating.\n\nIn conjunction with the 3-days State visits of the President of USA, Malaysia pull all the stops as the country of 30 million people greets the US President, Barrack Obama with a 'red-carpet' treatment. As Malaysia wished \"Selamat Datang\" to the President of USA which meant \"Welcome\" in Malay, a red carpet was rolled out during the official welcoming ceremony at Parliament Square last Saturday. Also present at the ceremony were Their Majesties the Yang di-Pertuan Agong of Malaysia, Tuanku Abdul Halim Muadzam Shah of Kedah and the Raja Permaisuri Agong of Malaysia, Tuanku Hajah Haminah of Kedah. Also present were the Prime Minister of Malaysia, Datuk Seri Mohd Najib bin Tun Abd Razak and his Deputy, Tan Sri Muhyiddin bin Yassin.\n\nObama later inspected the Guard-of-Honour mounted by 107 officers and men from the First Battalion of the Royal Malay Regiment led by Major Amriza Mohd Asshari. The ceremony marked by a 21-gun salute. The President of USA visits to Malaysia is a part of Obama's four-nation of Asia is a first by a sitting US president in 48 years since President Lyndon B. Johnson's in 1966. Obama had visited Japan and South Korea, the final of his Asia's trip is the Philippines.\n\nThe President's later was invited to the official State Banquet held at Istana Negara at night. In the banquet, His Majesty the Yang di-Pertuan Agong in his royal address has expressed Malaysia's gratitude for the United States's unwavering support and cooperation in the search operation of the lost Malaysian Airlines Flight MH370. The Supreme Ruler also stated that he was pleased to see the ties between Malaysia and the US gaining so much traction, as over the years, their common interests and shared values had flourished. His Majesty then concluded in his speech with hope that President Obama would enjoy Malaysia's hospitality and return to the US with fond memories of the country. \"We hope your visit to Malaysia is both meaningful and memorable. We pray for your continued good health, as well as that of your family, and for the people of the US\"."
