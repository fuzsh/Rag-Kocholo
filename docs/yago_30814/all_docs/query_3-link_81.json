        "text": "While nobility is indeed her birthright, Tengku Zatashah Sultan Sharafuddin Idris Shah always ensures that her achievements are earned on her own merit. And she often does so in elegant midi ensembles that are not unlike those preferred by Kate Middleton.\n\nThe daughter of Selangor’s current king is best known for her passion in promoting the Malaysian-French connection. She speaks fluent French, is married to French film producer and entrepreneur Aubry Mennesson, and is the president of Alliance Française Kuala Lumpur.\n\nTengku Zatashah is also an avid environmentalist and social worker. She actively advocates against the single-use of plastic items and volunteers regularly in soup kitchen programmes to help feed the poor. When not busy saving the world, she keeps active with fitness dancing.\n\n2. Raja Permaisuri Tuanku Zara Salim\n\nNo one turns heads quite like Raja Permaisuri Tuanku Zara Salim. The queen of the Perak state is known for her ethereal beauty and elegant manner. She is always seen in exquisitely designed traditional Malay attire.\n\nStyle aside, Tuanku Zara is highly revered for her accomplishments. Before marrying Sultan Nazrin Muzzidin Shah, the present king of Perak with whom she has two children, this former Kedah princess was a trained chemical engineer in the oil and gas industry. On top of that, she is a known adventure sports enthusiast and often speaks at youth sports events. Besides being a certified lifesaver, she also has her own public aquatic centre in Ipoh, Perak.\n\n3. Tengku Chanela Jamidah\n\nTengku Chanela Jamidah Binti Tengku Arif Bendahara Ibrahim is hands down an obvious fashion icon. First, there is her first name, which brings to mind that famous French fashion house. Then, there is her penchant for pairing daring looks with a je ne sais quoi attitude.\n\nProving that there is more to her than a chic name and ensembles, this entrepreneur and mother of two has built her own fashion and beauty legacy through her brands ULTRA, Thavia, and Dida.\n\nBut these days, you will find Tengku Chanela musing more about her latest passion: sound healing. That’s right, she is now a certified sound therapist specialising in crystal sound bath workshops at Jiwa, her new wellness space in Los Angeles. Well, there’s nothing more magical to us than a noblewoman who truly shows that beauty is more than skin deep.\n\n4. Tunku Tun Aminah\n\nKnown as the darling of Johor, Tunku Tun Aminah Maimunah Iskandariah is a fashion aficionado whose heart of gold is enhanced with her understated chic looks. Her entrepreneurial endeavours are always rooted in giving back to Johorian society. Besides reportedly owning a skincare range and spa franchise in her home state, she’s also co-designed a highly buzzed-about fashion collection for the masses that was based on her own wardrobe.\n\nA highly private person, not much is known of Tunku Tun Aminah’s personal life, including her marriage to her Dutch husband, Dato' Dennis Muhammad Abdullah. But this does not deter the public’s fascination with her. Though her wedding in 2017 was a private affair, word eventually got out that Nicole Scherzinger was there to serenade the guests.\n\n5. Tengku Putri Iman Afzan\n\nAnother low-profiler who’s no less riveting is Tengku Putri Iman Afzan, the 27-year-old daughter of Malaysia’s present king and head of state, Yang Dipertuan Agong Al-Sultan Abdullah Ri’ayatuddin Al-Mustafa Billah Shah. With so much resting on her father’s shoulders – including the country’s latest political turmoil – it’s no wonder why this Pahang royal prefers to keep it private.\n\nStill, Tengku Iman Afzan does share bits and pieces of her life as a royal wife and mother on her Instagram page. Periodically she will share her travel stories, minimalistic #OOTDs (outfits of the day), and selfies displaying her delicate, siren-like beauty (a quality she definitely takes after her actress mother, Julia Rais). But if you assume she’s is just a pretty face, think again. When she’s not performing her royal duties or attending to her family, she helps Malaysian society fight stigma surrounding mental health issues."
