He was Malaysia’s Special Envoy for Interfaith and Inter-civilisational Dialogue at the United Nations Alliance of Civilisations (UNAOC).\n\nAt home, His Royal Highness is the Chancellor of the Universiti Malaya. He is also the Colonel-in-Chief of the Regiment of Royal Engineers and of the Royal Medical Corps in the Malaysian Armed Forces.\n\nSultan Nazrin Shah is an Honorary Fellow of Worcester College, Oxford, and of Magdalene College and St. Edmund’s College, both Cambridge.\n\nHe is a Trustee of the Oxford Centre for Islamic Studies, University of Oxford; Royal Fellow of the Malaysian Institute of Defense and Security; Royal Fellow of the Malaysian Institute of Strategic and International Studies; Royal Fellow of the Institute of Public Security of Malaysia; Royal Patron of the Institute of Diplomacy and Foreign Relations of Malaysia; and Royal Patron (formerly, Financial Ambassador) of the Malaysia International Islamic Financial Centre.\n\nHis Royal Highness received his early education at Jalan Kuantan Primary School, and thereafter at St. John’s Institution, both in Kuala Lumpur.\n\nHe subsequently went on to finish schooling at The Leys School, Cambridge, in the United Kingdom. He then read Philosophy, Politics and Economics (PPE) at the University of Oxford.\n\nIn addition to his BA degree from Oxford, the Sultan holds a PhD in Political Economy and Government, from Harvard University.\n\nSultan Nazrin Shah is married to Tuanku Zara Salim. They have a son, Raja Azlan Muzzaffar Shah and a daughter Raja Nazira Safya. – Bernama"
