        "text": "This is a thread taken from an online photo forum describing Kuala Kangsar:\n\n“(I) Was in Bukit Chandan in 1959 and 1960. Left Clifford School and Bukit Chandan after Form 3 in 1961 to go to the Royal Military College in Sungai Besi. Used to play football on the padang next to the palace. Even played hide and seek in the Istana numerous times. Those days security wasn’t so tight and we kampung boys could simply go into the Istana anytime. I once saw HH the late Sultan Yusuf Izzudin Shah in a sarong and pagoda tee shirt and remember thinking they were ordinary human beings after all… When he died and the Sultan before Sultan Azlan took over, I remember hearing the nobat playing for several nights. Very hauntingly eerie sounds. I also used to regularly swim across the Perak river to Sayong just below Lubuk Mat Anjing after school, and only stopped when my father rotan me because two Malay College boys who were also equally naughty, drowned in Lubuk Mat Anjing. I also remember shooting Malay College boys with my catapult because all the GEGS* girls prefer the Malay College boys over Cliffordians. I remembered I couldn’t go to school for a few days because the Perak River flooded and the water rose to half the height of the Kuala Kangsar Clock Tower.\n\n“Those were good fun days…and it seemed it was only yesterday when I was young….”\n\n[*] GEGS – Government English Girls School, now named Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan Raja Perempuan Kelsom.\n\n__________________________________\n\nEditor’s notes on Lubuk Mat Anjing (or Lubuk Mat Anjen, if you like): This infamous part of Sungai Perak in Kuala Kangsar is located about 150 metres downstream from the Royal boat jetty near the Padang Kanak Kanak. Local legend has it that a chap named Mat and his dog drowned at this very site.\n\nAs Engku Chulan described, “… don’t you dare swim there if you can’t beat Mark Spitz (American swimmer who won seven gold at the 1972 Munich Olympics)”. The lubuk is characterised by whirlpool/eddies, which can formed when an obstruction hinders the normal flow of a current. It has been described that drowning victims upriver would end up at Lubuk Mat Anjing, due to the peculiar flow of the current as this point.\n\nThe lubuk is well known among local anglers. Lampams weighing one kilogramme can allegedly be found in this vicinity."
