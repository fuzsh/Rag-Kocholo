        "text": "“Ya?” The cashier looked at me and asked in Cantonese\n\n“Who is that?”I asked in Mandarin, pointing to the picture behind her.\n\nShe looked at me, paused and spoke haltingly in Mandarin, “that is the crown prince, the son of the of the old Sultan. He just took over from his father last year. Very good man!”\n\nWe were talking about the picture of Sultan Dr Nazrin Shah and his royal consort, Tuanku Zara Salim Davidson in a Chinese Dim Sum shop. It’s easy forget in a place like Ipoh, where the majority are Chinese, that Ipoh is part of a sultanate. And these people are all royal subjects.\n\nThis is the story of a 500 year old Sultanate that is still going strong.\n\nThe state of Perak has been a sultanate for almost 5 centuries. It was established in 1528, after the fall of the Malaccan sultanate, with Raja Muzzafar Shah – the eldest son of the last sultan of Malacca. He fled Malacca which had then fallen into Portuguese hands and established the Perak dynasty on the banks of the Perak River. Because of the rich mineral deposits found in the state, Perak had been under constant threat of invasion from its establishment.\n\nPerak River (Source)\n\nThe first to try their hands were the Dutch. The Dutch built a fort town on the island on Pulau Pangkor and tried to monopolise tin and spice trading in the region. Their motivation was money and when they could not convince the Sultan to allow them to trade, turned to the neighbouring Sultan of Aceh (on the Indonesian island of Sumatra) to apply pressure on the Perak Sultanate who grudgingly acquiesced. The people of Perak were never happy and for the next few decades would continue to attack the Dutch and destroy the Dutch buildings in Perak. In 1670, the Dutch were allowed back in to the state to serve as a counter balance to the menacing Kingdom of Siam in the North. Then the dominant power whose troops were gathering at the borders, threatening to invade the state. The Dutch maintained a presence but were constantly frustrated in their attempts to negotiate trade monopoly treaties with the Perak Sultanate.\n\nDespite living in an age of colinialism, for a region rich in minerals, the European colonialist were not the main threat. In the 1800s, the Bugis, Achenese and Siamese separately launched invasion attempts on Perak and it took a British intervention in Perak (the British had by then taken control of Malacca and Penang) to prevent the Siamese from successfully conquering Perak. Despite beating off its external threats, Perak was in a state of emergency. The tin mining trade had drawn many Chinese immigrants who fought over control of the mines, while there was violence on the streets the Perak palace was embroiled in a succession crisis with two claimants to the throne.\n\nSultan Abdullah (source)\n\nOne of the claimants, then Raja Muda Abdullah wrote to his friend Tan Kim Cheng (see post on Tan here) to assist in placing Perak under British protection and “to have a man of sufficient abilities to show (him) a good system of government”. Tan was the same man who introduced King Mongkut of Siam to Anna Leonowens to teach English to his children. This was the Anna of Anna and the King fame.\n\nWith this act, Raja Muda Abdullah brought to himself a powerful protector and at the Treaty of Pangkor signed into existence a British Resident to run the sultanate. This also allowed the British (who then only controlled the cities of Penang, Malacca and Singapore) to expand their influence into Negri Sembilan, Selangor and Pahang. Negeri Sembilan, Selangor, Pahang and Perak would eventually form the federated Malay states.\n\nFederated Malay States in blue (Source)\n\nAfter taking over Ipoh, the British brought sweeping changes to the town – today known as Ipoh old town. The government buildings and most of its current infrastructure was built under british rule.\n\nIpoh Railway Station\n\nIpoh Town Hall\n\nIpoh Padang\n\nDespite the relatively benign nature of Brtish colonialism in Perak, the people of Perak did not always take to the administrators sent by the British. The first Resident sent to Perak was a colourless, drab man by the name of J W W Birch. In the book History of Perak, the authors Windstedt and Wilkinson wrote that Birch was a “lonely pathetic figure of an Englishman with narrow rigid ideas as his daily companions”. Birch was also a cultural naive man who once wrote, “it concerns us little what were the customs of the country nor do I think they are worthy of any consideration”. He was assasinated by locals led by a chieftian Maharaja Lela precipitating a short-lived Perak War. A memorial clock tower named after Birch was completed in 1909 and has on its four sides 44 images of famous figures of the world.\n\nBirch Memorial Clock Tower Ipoh\n\nThe old town of Ipoh is a mix of Chinese and colonial architecture. Unlike Georgetown in Penang and the conserved shophouses in Singapore, Ipoh only began to be built up in the 1920s and so the designs of the shop houses are concrete structures rather than shophouses with five foot walkways. The preservation of old Ipoh has little to do with heritage and more to do with economy. When the tin mining industry collapsed, people and investment left and there was just no incentive to develop the old town – resulting in an almost perfectly preserved colonial Ipoh old town.\n\nThroughout all this though, Ipoh has retained and remained an important city within a sultanate. Perak now has its 35th Sultan, Nazrin Shah whose reign began in 2014 and was officially installed in 2015.\n\nDr Nazrin is the latest in a line of highly distinguished Malay royalty, following the likes of millionaire Real Estate mogul Sultan Ibrahim Ismail of Johor, senior banking executive Tuanku Muhriz of Negeri Sembilan and Sandhurst trained soldier Tuanku Mizan of Terengganu. Dr Nazrin Shah is not just a figure head but a academically distinguished leader in his own right. He was educated in the renowned Malay College Kuala Kangsar, and obtained a bachelors in PPE from Oxford followed by an MPA and PhD from Harvard. Sultan Nazrin’s research interests are in the area of economic and political development in South-East and North-East Asia, historical national income accounting and economic growth in developing countries. So when he speaks on topics at forums, you know he probably wrote it himself.\n\nWhether its the Dutch, the British, the Siamese or the Chinese, their cultural influence has merely been assimilated into Ipoh and Perakian culture. At the end of it all, even with weakened political power this sultanate has has remained front and centre of the state, its influence arguably growing stronger with less political power (monarchies in Malaysia seem to be filling the leadership void and stabilising the country)."
