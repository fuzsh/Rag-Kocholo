        "text": "Here are the Signs/Symptoms\n\nSchizophrenia usually develops gradually, although onset can be sudden. Among the signs are:\n\nConfusion\n\nInability to make decisions\n\nHallucinations\n\nDelusions\n\nNervousness\n\nStrange statements or behavior\n\nAnger\n\nIndifference to the opinions of others\n\nA tendency to argue\n\nA conviction that you are better than others, or that people are out to get you\n\nParti Rakyat Sarawak (PRS)\n\nI have been following events in the Parti Rakyat Sarawak (PRS) tussled for control of the party since its inception. First, it was between Dr James Jemut Masing and Dato' Sng Chee Hua, and now James Jemut and Larry Sng (Sng Chee Hua's son) whom both claimed to be the legitimate President of PRS. Both are elected by their respective faction members at their respective general assembly which was held separately.\n\nThe possibility that Parti Rakyat Sarawak (PRS) could be deregistered is looming larger with no hope for reconciliation between the two warring factions in the party. With Sng insisted that Masing had been expelled from the party, which was unacceptable to Masing’s negotiating team led by Dublin Unting, there would be no possibility of negotiations.\n\n“If you look at the law, a party cannot have two supreme councils or two presidents and there is no way to avoid deregistration. But we are trying to find ways to save the party, but they (Sng’s group) want Dato Sri out of the party and we cannot agree to that\", said Unting, who is a PRS vice president from the Masing's faction.\n\nRumours have it that the Registrar of Societies (ROS) could soon call the leaders of both factions – Dato Sri Dr James Masing and Larry Sng – to a meeting that could very well decide the fate of the party. But both parties claimed to be unaware of the meeting being called by ROS. More, click here\n\nPARANOID PERSONALITY DISORDER\n\nDr James Jemut was a Vice president in the now defunct Parti Bansa Dayak Sarawak (PBDS) which was headed by Tan Sri Leo Moggie former Federal Minister in the Tun Dr Mahathir's cabinet. When Tan Sri Leo suddenly relinquished his presidency of PBDS, Daniel Tajem was made an acting President by virtue of him being the deputy president. But Masing felt that the decision would eventually marginalised him and would never recognize his worth. This action reinforced all Masing's suspicions, and he looked for and found a partner in Dato Sng Chee Hua to challenge and oust Daniel Tajem and his team from dominating PBDS party positions. They then convene a TGM in Bintulu which eventually elected him and Sng as President and Deputy President respectively. Soon after, Daniel Tajem's faction convene a TGM at Pantai Damai near Kuching and confirmed Tajem's as President and Datuk Joseph Sallang as Deputy President.\n\nPBDS later have two presidents and two supreme councils which is illegal according to Register of Societies (ROS) law. Eventually on 21 October 2004, PBDS was deregistered and on the the same day PRS was born.\n\nLooking back at the turn of event in James Jemut controversial political career, during the last three years he has been elected party presidents three times. Masing obviously has paranoid personality disorder. I do recalled Tan Sri Leo Moggie did call James Jemut such a paranoid during a speech in Kanowit during the height of the PBDS crisis.\n\nSuspicious\n\nAn unmistakable sign of paranoia is continual mistrust. People with paranoid personality disorder are constantly on their guard because they see the world as a threatening place. They tend to confirm their expectations by latching on to any speck of evidence that supports their suspicions and ignore or misinterpret any evidence to the contrary. They are ever watchful and may look around for signs of a threat.\n\nMeanwhile, Masing was not happy with Sng attending the ‘ngiling bidai’ function at Nanga Antawau.\n\nHe said Sng had caused confusion among the supporters and voters in his constituency by organising the function there. “This is a clear example of ‘tumbok rusuk’ or back stabbing,” Masing said, adding that he was very disappointed. More, click here and here\n\nAnyone in a new situation--beginning a job or starting a relationship, for example--is cautious and somewhat guarded until he or she learns that the fears are groundless. People suffering from paranoia cannot abandon their fears. They continue to expect trickery and to doubt the loyalty of others. In a personal relationship or marriage, this suspiciousness may take the form of pathological, unrealistic jealousy.\n\nHypersensitive\n\nBecause persons with paranoid personality disorder are hyperalert, they notice any slight and may take offense where none is intended. As a result, they tend to be defensive and antagonistic. When they are at fault, they cannot accept blame, not even mild criticism. Yet they are highly critical of others. Other people may say that these individuals make \"mountains out of molehills.\"\n\nMasing accuses rival president Larry Sng of ‘tumbok rusuk’ by attending a function of 2,000 in his constituency\n\nCold and Aloof\n\nIn addition to being argumentative and uncompromising, the people with paranoid personality disorder are often emotionally cut off from other people. They pride themselves on their rationality and objectivity. Many presumably function competently in society. They may seek out social niches in which a moralistic and punitive style is acceptable, or at least tolerated to a certain degree.\n\nPARANOID SCHIZOPHRENIA\n\nParanoid thinking and behavior are hallmarks of the form of schizophrenia called \"paranoid schizophrenia.\" Individuals with paranoid schizophrenia commonly have extremely bizarre delusions or hallucinations, almost always on a specific theme.\n\nI’m serious about merger: Sng\n\n“I feel seriously for this merger plan, and I hope SPDP president feels the same too,” he said, smiling at Dato Sri William Mawan, the evening’s guest of honour, who was sitting at the head table. More, click here and here\n\nIn contrast, people with relatively milder paranoid disorders may have such symptoms as delusions of persecution or delusional jealousy, but not the prominent hallucinations or impossible, bizarre delusions of paranoid schizophrenia. Those with milder paranoid disorders are customarily able to work, and their emotional expression and behavior are appropriate to their delusional belief. Apart from their delusions, their thinking remains clear and orderly.\n\nSng also suggested that both PRS and SPDP take the initiative to jointly organise the second Dayak Economic Forum, which, according to him, could serve as a platform to debate and exchange ideas on ways to further develop human capital and physical assets. More, click here\n\nOn the other hand, those with paranoid schizophrenia are often intellectually disorganized and confused.\n\nFurther Reading, click here\n\nThe Star, Thursday February 9, 2006\n\nNo deal between Mawan and Masing, says PRS\n\nKUCHING: Party Rakyat Sarawak (PRS) has denied that its president Datuk Dr James Masing has agreed to let incumbents Stanley Ajang and Gabriel Adit defend their Belaga and Ngemah seats, respectively, in the next state election.\n\nParty information chief Wilfred Nissom said there was no such agreement between Dr Masing and Sarawak Progressive Democratic Party’s (SPDP) president Datuk William Mawan as reported in the newspapers.\n\nMawan had said on Monday that Dr Masing and he had agreed recently that Ajang and Adit would be retained as candidates in the coming polls.\n\nThe two assemblymen joined SPDP two months ago to remain in the Barisan Nasional after Parti Bansa Dayak Sarawak (PBDS), to which they were affiliated, was deregistered 16 months ago.\n\nAjang was then PBDS’s secretary-general, and Adit, one of its vice-presidents.\n\n“Belaga and Ngemah are among the nine assembly seats which have been allocated to PRS (by the state Barisan supreme council),” Nissom said in a press statement yesterday.\n\nPRS secretary-general Sidi Munan said there should be no confusion over his party’s right to nominate candidates for the two seats.\n\nFOR FURTHER INFORMATION"
