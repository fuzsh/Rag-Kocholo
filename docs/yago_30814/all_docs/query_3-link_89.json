Tengku Amir Shah also welcomed Mennesson into the family.\n\nThe highlight of the evening was dinner served by personnel from the Royal Malaysian Navy smartly dressed in their sailor uniforms.\n\nMusicians from the Gamelan Diraja Selangor entertained guests at the reception area, while the troupe from the Shah Alam City Council Orchestra played a medley of English and traditional Malay songs during the dinner."
