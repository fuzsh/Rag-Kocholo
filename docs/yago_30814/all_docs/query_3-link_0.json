She and the Sultan, who had been the country's most eligible royal bachelor for decades, have known each other since the mid-1990s. She was officially installed as the Raja Permaisuri of Perak during Sultan Nazrin's enthronement ceremony as the 35th Sultan of Perak on 6 May 2015.\n\nBorn in the city of Ipoh on 22 March 1973, she is the youngest of four children of William Stanley Walker Davidson (Salim Davidson), an Englishman and his ethnic Malay wife of mixed Arab and Thai descent, Sharifah Azaliah binti Syed Omar Shahabudin who is from Alor Setar, Kedah. She is also an extended member of Kedah Royal Family on her maternal side and has three elder brothers. Her father is a prominent lawyer in Perak and Kuala Lumpur.\n\nZara, who has a strong interest in foreign languages, studied at SMK Convent Ipoh and represented her school in squash and tennis from 1988 to 1990. She also represented Perak in swimming between 1981 and 1987.\n\nAfter completing her A-Levels at Prime College in 1992, she left for the United Kingdom to study chemical engineering at the University of Nottingham and graduated with first class honours in July 1995.

Therefore, she is also the grandniece of the Tunku and a niece of Sultan Abdul Halim Mu'adzam Shah and of the current sultan, Sultan Sallehuddin.\n\nAccording to Zara's uncle Syed Mohd Aldinuri Syed Omar, Zara's mother Sharifah Azaliah Syed Omar was the daughter of Tunku Aminah, who was the daughter of Sultan Abdul Hamid and Che Manjalara.\n\nFrom the marriage to Che Manjalara, Sultan Abdul Hamid had seven children, including Tunku Abdul Rahman Putra Al-Haj and Tunku Aminah.\n\nZara also has a close relationship with the late Sultan of Kedah, Sultan Abdul Halim Mu'adzam Shah Sultan Badlishah, who is the grandson of Sultan Abdul Hamid and a nephew to Tunku Abdul Rahman.\n\nShe is also the granddaughter of the former Kedah Menteri Besar Tan Sri Syed Omar Syed Abdullah Shahabudin. Tunku Aminah married Syed Omar, who became Kedah's second Menteri Besar after independence, from July 1959 to December 1967.\n\nZara's wedding to Raja Nazrin Shah was held at Istana Iskandariah on 17 May 2007.\n\nA day after the solemnisation of their vows, there was a special proclamation ceremony to bestowed upon her with the honorific prefix of Tuanku and the official title as Raja Puan Besar (Crown Princess) of Perak, a title reserved for the royal wife of the Raja Muda (Crown Prince) of Perak that had been vacant since April 1987.\n\nThe royal wedding reception took place on 19 May 2007.\n\nThe couple's first child, a son named Raja Azlan Muzzaffar Shah, the Raja Kecil Besar of Perak was born 14 March 2008.

Chemical engineers are highly employable, have wide and diverse career options, and can make a big impact in society and the environment. She intends to, as Royal Patron of the IChemE, do her part to inspire the younger generation to consider chemical engineering as a viable career choice.[4]\n\nShe is also a patron of the Family Health Society of Perak, Convent Girls Alumni and Perak Girl Guides.[5]\n\nRecipient of the Royal Family Order of Perak (DK) (6 May 2015).\n\nSuperior Class of the Perak Family Order of Sultan Azlan Shah (DKSA) (18 May 2007)\n\nMember First Class of the Azlanii Royal Family Order (DKA)"
