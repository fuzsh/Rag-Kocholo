It was specially made by Datin Seri Zubidahtul Radthuan Muhammad Ali Piah, the wife of Datuk Seri Mansur Raja Razman, who is the Comptroller of the Perak royal household.\n\nZubidahtul, who is also a member of the Perak nobility, said the triangle top of the dais was a gold-plated carving from Terengganu while the gold embroidered cloth background was from Kelantan. The square gold embroidered cushions with orchid motifs and yellow round pillow used to decorate the dais were made by craftsmen in Perak, she said. \"I have had the idea for a long time, but it took me a week to complete it,\" she told Bernama here today. Placed on the left and right of the dais were gold-plated vases specially brought in from Kelantan to further add to the glitter of the wedding ceremony.\n\nZubidahtul said the design was unique and showcased the rich Malay heritage. She was also responsible for making the special cushion on which the Raja Muda sat when pronouncing his marriage vow. Zubidahtul, who also loves cooking, had also been part of the Malaysian delegation that was led by celebrity chef Redzuawan Ismail, better known as Chef Wan, to the \"Gourmand World\" in France in 2004 and was given the responsibility to introduce Perak royal dishes there.

Manirajan; SUN\n\nKUALA LUMPUR (May 16, 2007): The Cabinet discussed the \"bocor\" issue today and mandated Women, Family and Community Development Minister Datuk Seri Shahrizat Jalil to handle the matter. Shahrizat has since arranged a meeting on Friday (May 18) morning with MPs Datuk Bung Mokhtar Radin (BN-Kinabatangan), who made the \"bocor\" remarks in the Dewan Rakyat, and Datuk Mohd Said Yusof (BN-Jasin), who supported him. In a statement after the cabinet meeting today, Shahrizat said the press would be informed of any press conference after that.\n\nThe statement deflated an anticipation by women non-governmental organisations of some form of decisive action by the Cabinet on this matter which had enraged women. This morning, an English newspaper (not theSun) had sent out SMS alerts (before Shahrizat's statement) saying Bung Mokhtar and Mohd Said had apologised to Batu Gajah MP Fong Po Kuan and all Malaysian women over the sexist remarks. Last week, during a heated exchange about the ceiling leakage in Parliament, Bung Mokhtar was quoted saying \"Mana ada 'bocor'? Batu Gajah pun 'bocor' tiap-tiap bulan juga (Where is the leak? Batu Gajah MP also leaks every month).\" Fong, who reviewed the video recording of the proceedings, said Mohd Said had supported Bung Mokhtar, saying: \"When I wanted to debate on the serious issue, there was this scuffle and shouting.\"\n\nContacted, Bung Mokhtar (ABOVE) said he was not going to say anything pending the meeting with Shahrizat. On the SMS news alert, he said he withdrew the apologystatement for the time being. He had also told the Sun in the morning he apologised to women \"if he actually hurt their feelings\". \"Let me brief Shahrizat first on what actually transpired during the debate. Being a good listener and a good leader, I will comply by the Cabinet's decision,\" he said.\n\nMohd Said (ABOVE)called for a press conference in Parliament at 3pm today, purportedly to explain his side of the story but cancelled it after being informed of the Cabinet's decision. Bung Mokhtar said he had experienced a similar situation before when an opposition MP had called him 'binatang' and he had objected and asked for the statement to be withdrawn. \"I did not make the remark to all women,I only addressed it to Fong. But since it concerned the DAP, they made a big thing out of a small matter,\" he said.\n\nABOVE: Batu Gajah MP pointing her finger at whom?\n\nAsked on the matter in a function in the Defence Ministry, Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Abdul Razak, who is also the BN chief whip, said the two MPs had not intended to hurt or insult women. \"They uttered the words during a debate as they were angry with the speech made by the Batu Gajah MP (Fong) (ABOVE),\" he said. On whether the two MPs should make a public apology, he said the meeting on Friday should be allowed to go on first before any other decision is made. Minister in the Prime Minister's Department Datuk Seri Mohd Nazri Abdul Aziz felt it was unnecessary for the two MPs to apologise as it would be difficult for MPs to debate in the House in future. \"You cannot control people's emotions all the time. This (Parliament) is not a place where you have academic exercise,\" he said in a press conference.\n\n\"These are all unguarded moments. I don't think the two have (an) agenda against Po Kuan, but it's the unguarded moments. I don't condone, but they all human beings.\" However, he said the duo owe an explanation to the women who had been offended by the reports, adding that the cabinet had no directive on how the duo should deal with the situation.\n\n= = = = = == = = == = ==\n\nWednesday May 16, 2007; the STAR;\n\nMPs apologise for sexist remarks\n\nKUALA LUMPUR MPs Datuk Mohd Said Yusof (Jasin – BN) and Datuk Bung Mokhtar Radin (Kinabatangan – BN) have apologised to all Malaysian women for making the now infamous bocor remarks in Parliament last week. The remarks caused a nationwide furore, leading various women’s groups to protest against the two MPs outside the Women, Family and Community Development Ministry on Tuesday. \"I am very sorry. I apologise to all women. It was a slip of the tongue, said in the heat of the moment,\"said Mohd Said, adding, \"I respect all women and the liberation of women.\"\n\nIn Kota Kinabalu, Bung Mokhtar also expressed his apology to all women for his \"unintended remarks.\" \"It was not my intention to hurt any woman. \"I said it in the heat of an argument with DAP members, who were calling me binatang (animal) and accusing the Barisan Nasional of corruption. \"I strongly feel that women's feelings should be respected,\" he told The Star. Both MPs got into hot soup when they remarked, \"mana bocor?

More than a hundred women gathered at the Women, Family and Community Development Ministry yesterday to urge action against the MPs for the remarks made in parliament. They only left when the minister, Datuk Shahrizat Abdul Jalil, came out to calm them and accept a statement of protest. Shahrizat, who spent about five minutes talking to the protesters, said: \"Please don’t be over emotional, we know that it is very important to be gender sensitive and that sexist remarks should not be made in parliament. I will bring it up to the cabinet.\"\n\nBackbenchers Datuk Radin Bung Mokhtar (BN-Kina- batangan) and Datuk Mohd Said Yusuf (BN-Jasin) are said to have passed sexist remarks to Fong Po Kuan (DAP-Batu Gajah). \"Where is the leak, the member for Batu Gajah also leaks once a month,\" they were alleged to have said. Since then, both MPs have come under fire from various groups and individuals., remained in front of the ministry from 10.30am to noon. The banners screamed words such as \"Unthinking Male MPs\", \"More Women MPs less MCPs\", and \"Hina Wanita tak layak Jadi Pemim- pin\" (Those who degrade women do not deserve to be leaders). The protesters, from various non-governmental organisations and political parties, called themselves the Joint Action Group for Gender Equality (JAG). Leaders of the various organisations addressed the gathering. Maria Chin Abdullah, the executive director of Women’s Development Collective, who spoke on behalf of JAG, called for a public apology from the MPs.\n\nMCA Cheras division branch head Felicia Ling said: \"Just because the sexist remarks were said by two Barisan Nasional MPs it does not mean that the BN is not gender sensitive. \"We want the minister and the government to take the necessary action and I want to tell them that 50 per cent of the population (all the women) is behind you on this so there is nothing to be afraid of.\"\n\nSisters In Islam executive director Zainah Anwar said the situation was not funny any more. \"I would like to say that Mokhtar, Said, Datuk Mohamad Aziz (Sri Gading-BN), Abdul Fatah Harun (Rantau Panjang-Pas) and Datuk Badruddin Amirulddin (Jerai-BN) should not be selected to contest in the next general election. \"And if they are selected, I urge the voters to reject them. We will also campaign to enlighten their voters as to why we think they are not fit to be elected,\" she said. Women’s Aid Organisation president Meera Samanther said MPs should not utter such remarks. Other groups which took part in the protest included the All Women Action Society, Women’s Centre for Change, Malaysian Trades Union Congress and the DAP.\n\nABOVE: From Malaysiakini 30 s Video Clip H E R E\n\nWatch Video Clip (2min) - Protest by Enraged & Scorned Women - Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned; NO Apology Yet from the 2 BN Sexist MPs; Friday Dressing down by Shahrizat?\n\nShahrir: Apologise outside Parliament; Nazri; Beyond Control:Najib Wait for outcome\n\n= = == = == =\n\n= = = == = = =\n\nABOVE: From Malaysiakini - 5 min Video Clip HERE\n\nMay 14, 2007 17:46 PM\n\nBlogger Can Be Hauled Up For Slander\n\nKUALA LUMPUR, May 14 (Bernama) -- The blogsite operator who reported that Prime Minister Datuk Seri Abdullah Ahmad Badawi fainted at a function in Lumut, Perak, Sunday could face action including being charged under the Sedition Act if the article contained elements of slander.\n\nDeputy Minister of Energy, Water and Communications Datuk Shaziman Abu Mansor (ABOVE) said the ministry was studying the report before deciding on the type of action to be taken against the blogger.\n\n\"I have not read the report in the blogsite but if there are elements of slander, action can be taken under the Penal Code. This comes under the Internal Security Ministry,\" he told reporters at the parliament lobby here today. He was commenting on a report in a blogsite that Abdullah fainted at the function in Lumut. The Prime Minister has since denied the report and regretted its inaccuracy.\n\nShaziman said his ministry would cooperate with the Internal Security Ministry in identifying the blogger. In addition, the blogger could also be charged under the Communications and Multimedia Commission Act 1998, and if found guilty could be fined RM50,000 or one years' jail or both. Asked whether the government would control blogsites to prevent a recurrence, Shaziman said the government was holding on to the \"bill of guarantee\" under the Act which did not allow censorship of the Internet. However, action could be taken against bloggers under other Acts.\n\nMeanwhile, Umno information chief Tan Sri Muhammad Mohd Taib (ABOVE) described the report in the blogsite as inaccurate and \"naughty\" and made by certain people out to destabilise Umno and the government. \"Bloggers always want to confuse the people by reporting untruths, and their postings are usually inclined towards the Opposition. They hope to create panic and adverse effects on certain sectors,\" he added. Muhammad hoped the government would take stern action against bloggers who pose a threat to peace and national security.\n\n= = == = ==\n\nIn a news breaking story, Malaysiakini at 9.34 pm on Friday 13th May 2007, had a report that PM Abdullah had collapsed.

Husairy Othman; NST;\n\n007/05/14\n\nLUMUT: A hale and hearty Datuk Seri Abdullah Ahmad Badawi yesterday dismissed reports on the Internet that he was ill and had fainted during a function in Teluk Batik near here. \"I am fine, don't worry,\" the prime minister said. Abdullah said a series of tests had been carried out after he lost his balance during a presentation of keys for a housing project for the poor. The tests, including an electrocardiogram (ECG), revealed he was in good health.\n\n\"Maybe I was tired, and the weather was extremely hot. Furthermore, I did not have enough sleep the previous night,\" he said. He expressed relief that the test results showed nothing negative and criticised bloggers for inaccurate reporting. Abdullah says it was hot and he was tired\"What did they see?\" he asked. Abdullah was speaking at a hastily arranged press conference at the Damai Laut Resort after rumours spread on the Internet that he had \"collapsed\" during the ceremony. He said that at the function yesterday, Perak Menteri Besar Datuk Seri Tajol Rosli Ghazali remarked that he did not look well. \"My speech was not that long and when they asked me to present the mock keys, I heard the MB's remark, and I sat down,\" he said. His personal physician, Dr Sanjiv Joshi, who was present at the press conference, stressed that basic baseline investigations showed there was nothing wrong with the prime minister.\n\n\"In fact, he is as healthy as he can be.\"He wanted to play golf but I was the one who stopped him,\" he said. Dr Joshi said that it was just a case of heat exhaustion, which could happen to anyone. After the press conference, Abdullah headed for Pangkor Laut to attend a Barisan Nasional Backbenchers Club dinner. He was in a jovial mood and was seen having a conversation with a Pakistani couple and exchanging jokes. Later, at the dinner, Abdullah reminded BN representatives to take good care of their health, despite their hectic lifestyles. He quipped that there might be many more by-elections if the BN representatives were not healthy\n\n= = == = = = = == = = =\n\nAbdullah Says Not To Worry, He's Alright\n\nLUMUT, May 13 (Bernama) -- \"I am well. Don't worry,\" said Prime Minister Datuk Seri Abdullah Ahmad Badawi, refuting a claim spread through the Internet that he had fainted while attending a people's feast at the launching of the Hadhari Square in Teluk Batik here Sunday afternoon. \"I will continue with the programmes that been arranged for me,\" he told reporters here Sunday night.\n\n\"The doctor had conducted several tests on me including ECG, blood and blood pressure and these were found to be normal,\" added Abdullah who was examined by his personal physician Dr Sanjiv Joshi. Earlier when presenting the keys to nine recipients of houses built under the Barisan Nasional Backbenchers Club (BNBBC) community service programme, at the people's feast, Abdullah appeared to be losing balance and almost collapsed but was held by Perak Menteri Besar Datuk Seri Tajol Rosli Ghazali and BNBBC acting chairman Datuk Raja Ahmad Zainuddin Raja Omar. Abdullah who arrived in Perak this morning to close the BNBBC community programme, had earlier joined the BNBBC members in building homes for three families in Kampung Tanjung Burung in Ujung Pasir, Pantai Remis.\n\nThe Prime Minister continued with the gotong-royong by planting trees at Kampung Batu 4, Segari, near here, before moving on to Teluk Batik to close the community programme and join the people's feast. Abdullah said his condition could be due to the heat as the weather was very hot and his lack of sleep last night. \"I'm relieved now (after the doctor's examination). At first I was worried too. I thank the Almighty that I'm alright,\" he added.\n\nHe recalled that after giving his speech, he sat on stage and when handing over the house-keys to the recipients, he felt terribly tired. Meanwhile, Dr Sanjiv said Abdullah's condition was due to heat exhaustion. \"From the medical examination, his health condition is found to be good and there's nothing to worry about,\" he added. Dr Sanjiv said the heat exhaustion could hit anybody as the temperature was reported to be at 44 degrees Celcius.\n\n\"The Menteri Besar noticed that I appeared unwell. So I sat down and when I felt better I continued handing over the keys to the recipients,\" Abdullah said, adding that he was then examined by his personal doctor. Asked by reporters whether he felt he was going to faint, he said he did not. And on how he was feeling now, he said: \"I'm alright. Don't worry, I take care of my health. I will continue with tonight's programme.\n\n\"Raja Ahmad Zainuddin said he was at the function and the claim that the Prime Minister had fainted was not true. \"I was on stage too. The Prime Minister did not faint as claimed by the blogs. He just sat down for a while as he was tired as the heat was at 44 degrees Celsius. \"I'm surprised how the rumour could be spread through the Internet,\" he added. Tonight, Abdullah attended the closing of the BNBBC 2007 Retreat programme and scheduled to return to Kuala Lumpur tomorrow. The three-day programme involved 100 BN Members of Parliament and Perak assemblymen. The activities included looking at the development in Perak, dialogue with BN leaders, community service programme and sports.\n\nMeanwhile, speaking at the closing of the BNBBC Retreat programme at the Pangkor Laut Resort, near here, Abdullah also related what happened to him earlier in the day. Abdullah said following the medical examination, the doctor advised him not to play golf after the afternoon function although he felt okay. \"The doctor said to me, `you have to rest as you've worked hard',\" he added. In light of this, Abdullah asked the elected representatives to work smart by spending quality time with the people, listening to their problems and seriously solving them as it was their responsibility. \"At the same time, you must take care of your health. Otherwise, there'll be a by-election,\" he said in jest. The Prime Minister will hold a closed-door dialogue with the BNBBC members at the resort tomorrow morning.\n\n= = = == = =\n\nMay 13, 2007 20:38 PM\n\nPM Denied Rumours Spread In Internet That He Collapsed\n\nLUMUT, May 13 (Bernama ) -- Prime Minister Datuk Seri Abdullah Ahmad Badawi denied rumours spread in the internet that he collapsed while attending a people feast and officating Dataran Hadhari at Teluk Batik, Lumut at noon\n\n= = == See also H E R E on\n\nMore protest and outrage against the sexist remarks by the 2 BN MPs.
