        "text": "Fording the river near Kuala Kangsar on elephants. This photo was probably taken during the first Federal Conference (Durbar) in July 1897 and quite possibly this was when the party was on its way to the picnic spot of ‘Menggelunchor’.\n\nIn the photo is, on the leftmost elephant: the Acting Governor, H.E. Sir J. Scott and Almarhum Sultan Idris I. On the other elephant are Lady Scott, A. Calsecott (C.S.G.) and A. Hyde (personal secretary to the Acting Governor).\n\nReference: Moore WK.
