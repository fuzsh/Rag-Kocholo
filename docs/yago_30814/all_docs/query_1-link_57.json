        "text": "As the General Election is drawing near, it is a good time to see and reflect the Government that we have previously elect in the election. Malaysia adapted closely the Westminster system of Parliamentary Democracy where the elected representative who make up the majority in the Parliament will formed a government. In the case of Constitutional Monarchy, a reserved power were given to the monarch to appoint from the side who win at least a simple majority as the Head of Government who shall lead the Government in the name of the reigning monarch. In this series, we will see the relation between the Government and the monarch and how well both of this institution cooperate with one another in each respective State's political landscape. The first the State that we will see in the series is the State of Kelantan Darul Naim.\n\nKelantan since 2008\n\nSince the General Election 2008, the State Assembly witnessed a major changes in the seats between the serving government and the opposition. Since 1990, the State Government has always been formed by the Islamic based party, Parti Islam Se-Malaysia (PAS). Tuan Guru Nik Abdul Aziz bin Nik Mat, the Menteri Besar of Kelantan once again received the mandate from the Kelantanese for another term.\n\nAnd compare to that of 2004, the 2008 General Election witnessed that PAS formed the Government with a landslide victory. This make the State Government can focused more on another important matter such as the 5% Oil Royalty Payment. The state claimed that they have the right and should received royalty from the oil produced on the state offshore. And, it is this stable government that help the troubling monarchy in its time of need.\n\nWhen the Government swore their Oath of Allegiance in 2008, the reigning Sultan was His Royal Highness Sultan Ismail Petra II. He has ruled the State of Kelantan for almost 30 years. It is not the first and probably not the last that the Sultanate of Kelantan will witnessed problems during the succession of the crown. The health of Sultan Ismail Petra was deteriorated in 2009, led to a regency by his first son, Tengku Muhammad Faris Petra.\n\nDuring the early stage of the regency, there are not much of a problem. Tengku Muhammad Faris Petra is well received by the Kelantanese. As a down to earth Crown Prince, the Kelantanese have a very deep expectation for the Regent, that he can do well as a Regent and as well as the Al-Sultan of Kelantan when the time comes. Nevertheless, the trouble soon occur when the royal family of Kelantan suffer a fate of controversial issue when the Crown Prince's sister-in-law, Manohara Odelia Pinot fled to Indonesia with her mother when they are in Singapore with her husband, Tengku Muhammad Fakhry Petra to visit the Sultan Ismail Petra II where he was hospitalized there. And the worst is yet to come.\n\nAfter the controversial issue of the wife of a Prince, another issue splat out to the royal family, and this time with the shocking news of the second wife of the Sultan, Che Puan Elia Suhana who the marriage is kept secret within the royal circles. The marriage is proved to be valid. In addition, a tug-of-war fight also arise between the Regent and his brother, Tengku Temenggung of Kelantan. The State Government has done a good job not to intervened with the Palace's affairs. But after almost a year with a problematic monarchy, it has come to a boiling point where the State Government has billed out an amendment to the State Constitution regarding the regency where any Sultan which proved incapacitate more than a year need to abdicate the throne. During the State Assembly session, both the government and opposition alike unanimously in favour of the amendment.\n\nThus, without much hardship, Tengku Muhammad Faris Petra were proclaimed as the Al-Sultan of Kelantan with a reigning name of Sultan Muhammad V. Even though during the early stage of His Royal Highness ascended the throne, there are several attempt to challenge the validity of the succession, the position of Sultan is secured especially when the Conference of Ruler acknowledge the position of Sultan Muhammad V as the new Sultan of Kelantan.\n\nNevertheless the role played by the Government of Kelantan during the royal family feud is something to be praised. It is very hard to see a Government that willing to help the monarchy and upholding the royal institution. Until next time with another episode of His Royal Highness's Government.\n\nMuslims nationwide celebrated Aidiladha today on a moderate scale and in appreciation of sacrifice as required by Islamic teachings. Aidiladha is of great significance for Muslims worldwide and is celebrated in memory of the sacrifice made by the prophets Ibrahim and Ismail in obeying Allah. Fine weather in the morning enabled Muslims to perform their prayers comfortably, followed by the sacrificial offerings carried out at mosques, villages and housing estates. The Meteorological Department has, however, forecast isolated rain and thunderstorms in several states later in the day. This year, Aidiladha fell on the holy day of Friday and Muslims congregated again at mosques for the Friday prayers.\n\nYang di-Pertuan Agong Tuanku Abdul Halim Mu'adzam Shah and Raja Permaisuri Agong Tuanku Hajah Haminah joined millions of Muslims from around the world in performing the Haj this year.\n\nIn KELANTAN, Sultan Muhammad V performed prayers with about 5,000 people at the Muhammadi Mosque in Kota Baharu, led by the Grand Imam, Mohamad Hanafizi Abdullah, of the Kelantan Islamic Affairs and Malay Customs Council.\n\nIn TERENGGANU, Sultan Mizan Zainal Abidin performed prayers with more than a 1,000 people at the Al-Muktafi Billah Shah Mosque in Ladang, Kuala Terengganu. He was accompanied by other members of the royal family and Menteri Besar Datuk Seri Ahmad Said.\n\nIn PERAK, the Regent of Perak, Raja Dr Nazrin Shah, and Menteri Besar Datuk Seri Dr Zambry Abdul Kadir joined about 1,000 people for the prayers at the Abu Bakar As-Siddiq Mosque at the General Operations Force Camp in Ulu Kinta. Raja Dr Nazrin Shah is also scheduled to officially open the Hidayatul Ummah Mosque in Kota Lama Kiri, Kuala Kangsar, and join the congregation there for the Friday prayers.\n\nThe state government organised annual sacrificial offering programme 'Korban Perdana' managed to collect RM1.17 million from various state agencies and statutory bodies. The funds were used to buy livestock for sacrifice at state and district level.\n\nIn PAHANG, the Tengku Mahkota of Pahang, Tengku Abdullah Sultan Ahmad Shah, and the Tengku Puan of Pahang, Tengku Azizah Aminah Maimunah Sultan Iskandar, joined about 2,000 people who congregated at the Sultan Haji Ahmad 1 State Mosque. Also present were Pahang Menteri Besar Datuk Seri Adnan Yaakob, state executive councillors and government officers. The prayers were led by Pahang Mufti Datuk Abdul Rahman Osman.\n\nIn SELANGOR, Sultan Sharafuddin Idris Shah performed prayers with about 20,000 people at the Sultan Salahuddin Abdul Aziz Shah Mosque. Also present was Selangor Menteri Besar Tan Sri Abdul Khalid Ibrahim. The mosque's Grand Imam, Ustaz Ahmad Mustafa Mohd Sidin Al-Muqri, led the prayers. The congregation also included foreign Muslim students from the Al-Madinah International University and foreign workers.\n\nIn NEGERI SEMBILAN, the Yang di-Pertuan Besar of Negeri Sembilan, Tuanku Muhriz Ibni Almarhum Tuanku Munawir, joined about 500 people for prayers at the Tuanku Munawir Royal Mosque in Seri Menanti. He was accompanied by the Tunku Ampuan Besar of Negeri Sembilan, Tuanku Aishah Rohani Binti Tengku Besar Mahmud and several other members of the royal family. Their Majesties then attended a 'tahlil' ceremony at the Seri Menanti Royal Mausoleum. Tuanku Muhriz also attended the sacrificial offering ceremony at the mosque.\n\nIn MELAKA, Governor Tun Mohd Khalil Yaakob joined a congregation of about 7,000 for prayers at the Al-Azim Mosque in Melaka city. Also present was Chief Minister Datuk Seri Mohd Ali Rustam. The state-sponsored sacrificial offering of 19 cows would be held at the mosque tomorrow.\n\nIn PULAU PINANG, the Yang Dipertua Negeri Tun Abdul Rahman Abbas performed the Aidiladha prayers at the Masjid Haji Abdullah Fahim in Kepala Batas, Pulau Pinang. Also present was the Former Prime Minister of Malaysia, Tun Abdullah Ahmad Badawi.\n\nIn SABAH, Yang Dipertua Negeri Tun Juhar Mahiruddin joined about 5,000 people for prayers at the State Mosque in Sembulan, Kota Kinabalu. Also present were community leaders and heads of state and federal government departments.\n\nIn SARAWAK, Yang Dipertua Negeri Tun Abang Muhammad Salahuddin Abang Barieng and wife, Toh Puah Rokiah Abdullah performed the Aidiladha prayers at the Masjid Jamek Kuching. Also present were Sarawak Chief Minister Tan Sri Abdul Taib Mahmud and wife, Puan Sri Ragad Kurdi Taib, and other Sarawak cabinet ministers.\n\nThis afternoon, I just finally get a hold of a public holiday which is very hard to come by in this period of time. My hectic working life just getting even worse. Nevertheless, with the arrival of a meaningful Malaysia Day tomorrow gives me 2 days of public holiday. Especially with the decision from our Project Manager here in Bakun stated that holiday will follow to that of our Main Contractor. (Amending the previous decision from our Construction Manager which wants us to working continuously 7-day a week!). And, the Site Supervisor from our Main Contractor also wish me a happy weekend. It is the month of September, and I will cover several main event that occur in Malaysia, especially around our royalty circle.\n\nFirst of all, on previous 8th September 2012, it is the 91st Birthday Celebration of His Excellency the Yang Dipertua Negeri (Head of State) of Sarawak, Tun Abang Muhammad Salahuddin bin Abang Barieng. The Yang Dipertua Negeri, commonly refer to as 'TYT' by the local here in Sarawak, are commonly popular. He is also the first of any Yang Dipertua Negeri in Malaysia who serves twice as the Head of State.\n\nWishing His Excellency will be bestow a long live and may long he served for his people. Just imagine ruling the State which even larger that the peninsular of Malaysia but with a scarcely populated region of 2.5 million people. Really challenging if you ask me.\n\nAnd another important events occur in the month of September is the visit from the most popular royal couple in the world, Their Royal Highnesses Prince William, the Duke of Cambridge and his wife, Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge. It is in conjunction of the Diamond Jubilee celebration of Her Royal Highness Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.\n\nThe visit also encouraging due to the fact that the Princess William wearing a scarf. How lovely to see a royal princess wearing a scarf.\n\nAnother important and historical event is the Malaysia Day celebration on 16th September. The day where Singapore, Sarawak and Sabah federate with the existing States of the Federation of Malaya and the new federation later known as Malaysia. It is a hotly discussed topic around this week I presume, especially the fact of whether Sarawak and Sabah exist as a Country in par of the Federation of Malaya or a State in par status with 11 States in the Malaysia peninsular.\n\nAfter staying in Sarawak for about 3 months now, I would presume that Sarawak exist as a Country in par status with Sabah and Federation of Malaya is not a bad idea. After all, the State is exceptionally huge and have an abundant sources of natural resources. Whatever the definition may be, I let the politician to deside. For me.. I would say Sarawak and Sabah still have the par status with the 11 States of Federation of Malaya.\n\nThis is because, in 1948 Malaya exist as a Federation of Malaya and no longer a Malayan Union. Where the 11 States still exist as a separate British Protectorate which each of one have a same status as a single Crown Colony. For example, The State of Johor under the agreement with the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland during the reign of Queen Victoria acknowledge Johor as an independent State in par with Great Britain (The same status bestowed to Sarawak in 1850).\n\nWell, it is just my personal view anyway. For me, rather that debating about status, lets just focusing our energy to make Malaysia a better place to live.\n\nSelamat Hari Malaysia\n\nHappy Malaysia Day\n\nAssalamualaikum and Peace be upon all of you.\n\nWelcome to my blog.\n\nI would like to appreciate all of my blog visitors, followers and blogwalkers who always coming here and giving support to me all these years. Currently, I am already returned to my parent house in Johor to celebrate Eid-Fitri, which is just around the corner. This is my first post in the month of August, seriously I can't get myself to update the blog due to other commitment especially my hectic work schedule this previous 2 weeks. Just when I want to go home and take a holiday for Hari Raya, why it must be also the when it getting really busy? Nobody knows.\n\nHari Raya Eid-Fitri for Muslims is about celebrating the success of performing fasting in the month of Ramadhan. So, if the commoners are virtually going holiday, returning back to home and celebrate Hari Raya with family members, what is the royalty do during this period of time? Commonly, they celebrating it with the people. Reducing the burden of the unfortunate is all about the job of royalty during the month of Ramadhan.\n\nLets see some of the example of what our royalty do. For example, breaking fast ceremony with the people. The Johor Royalty is among the first to take this opportunity, with the program of 'Kembara Ramadhan Diraja Johor'. It doesn't have to be anything extravagant, as long as the people are concern, anything simple and humble such as buying food in the Ramadhan Bazaar for breaking fast is more than enough.\n\nAnd, the simple way in the Ramadhan will always change into something festive and entertaining such as the Hari Raya Open House. Well, we will see how our royalty will performed their duties well for the people in the future. In the system of Constitutional Monarchy, the royalty is not about ruling the nation because their role is simply ceremonial. Their main functions is about being a role model and social-services to the people.\n\nAllahu Akbar, Daulat Tuanku and Long Live the King.\n\npictures from Kesultanan Johor facebook.\n\nAt last, for the first time after more than 2 weeks, I'm finally able to update the blog. Currently, I am starting my new life as an engineer in the largest state in Malaysia, Sarawak. This magnificent land also fondly known as 'the Land of Hornbill' is larger than any other state in Malaysia, bigger even if compare to the whole Malaysian peninsular. And, I think it is only right to present about the State's history in my first blog update. In present day, Sarawak is one of four non-monarchy State in Malaysia. Nevertheless, the State is very much exist as a Sultanate and a Kingdom before exist as a non-monarchy State in 1946.\n\nThe State for a brief period of time exist as a Sultanate of Sarawak before becoming a territory in the Sultanate of Brunei. Later in 1841, the State becoming a Kingdom ruled by the White Rajah of Sarawak until the abdication of Charles Vyner Brooke, the last White Rajah of Sarawak in 1946.\n\nHISTORY\n\nSince the early age, Sarawak was under the ruled of the Sultanate of Brunei. Previously, the size of Sarawak is only limited to the area from Tanjung Datu in the west to Samarahan River in the east.\n\nSultanate of Sarawak\n\nThe Sultanate were only ruled by a single Sultan, Sultan Tengah who is the first and last Sultan of Sarawak. Sultan Tengah was installed by the Sultan of Brunei at that time, Sultan Abd Jalilul Akbar who is also his elder brother. When their father, Sultan Muhammad died in 1598, Pangeran Muda Tengah claimed that he is the rightful heir to the crown. His claimant based on the fact that he was born after their father became Sultan while his brother was not. In other word, when Sultan Abd Jalilul Akbar was born, he was only the son of a Prince. While Pangeran Muda Tengah when he was born, was the son of a Sultan.\n\nTo prevent any bloody tragedy occur, Sultan Abd Jalilul Akbar proclaimed his brother as the Sultan of Sarawak, taking a reigning name of Sultan Tengah. Sultan Tengah died in 1641 and the Sultanate of Sarawak ended. He was assassinated during his travel on his way back to Sarawak from Makun. The descendant of Sultan Tengah ruled the State of Sambas located at present day West Kalimantan, Indonesia. The Prince of Sultan Tengah, Radin Sulaiman becomes the Sultan of Sambas on 9th July 1631, 10 years before the death of his father. Below is the tomb of Sultan Tengah of Sarawak\n\nKingdom of Sarawak\n\nThe Kingdom of Sarawak was founded in 1841 when James Brooke were proclaimed has the Rajah of Sarawak by Pangeran Muda Hashim as a reward for his service in defeating pirates and insurgents. James Brooke later established an independent Kingdom of Sarawak and expand the territory by acquiring the other territory belong to the Sultanate of Brunei. The Kingdom of Sarawak were ruled by three White Rajahs of the Brooke dynasty.\n\nJames of Sarawak (1841 - 1868)\n\nCharles of Sarawak (1868 - 1917)\n\nVyner of Sarawak (1917 - 1946)\n\nThe Brooke Dynasty had left many of its legacy in their over 100 years of ruled. Here is the Royal Family of Sarawak during the reign of Charles Vyner Brooke.\n\nWhile below is the last Rajah Muda of Sarawak, Anthony Brooke\n\nThat's all for this article. Until next time.\n\nAssalamualaikum and Peace be upon all of you.\n\nWelcome to my blog.\n\nHappy a brand new month of June 2012 from me as the writer of Radin's Blog. And in this brief blog update, I would like to express my gratitude to my blog's visitors, followers and blogwalkers who visited this site. With 1,500 clicks daily, it is the main reason why I have the determination to continue updating the Royal Portal. Also included in my aim since the blog's first re-branding in 2010, is to promote the Malaysian Royal Families and the significance of Constitutional Monarchy system that we adapt since the country's independence in 1957.\n\nToday, I would like to announce that, I will take a few weeks time off from the blogging world. This is because of I would be reallocate to another place within this several weeks. And I need to be settled down and relatively stable in the new place, before I can continue to update the blog. And even though if I can resume the blog, probably I need to minimize the post and only limited to important events. The new place probably will restrain my time as I need to make my job as my main priority.\n\nI will continue my effort to improve this Royal Portal in the future. Thank you for your support all this time. (Don't be despair, as I will continue to update the blog from time to time. Probably with the reduce of number of post.)\n\nThat's all for now Salam"
