        "text": "The Raja Muda of Perak, Raja Dr. Nazrin Shah, has set a golden standard of exemplary conduct for rulers and political leaders with moderation, economy and the people’s welfare as the top considerations.\n\nRaja Nazrin has already carved a special place in the hearts of Malaysians with his scholarship and enlightened concerns for the people and nation as testified by his keynote address last month on “Prospects and Challenges for Nation Building” on the seven steps towards successful nation-building, in particular the first principle — “Malaysians of all races, religions and geographic locations need to believe beyond a shadow of doubt that they have a place under the Malaysian sun”.\n\nThe Raja Muda of Perak has now won the love and admiration not only of the people of Perak but of all Malaysians with his exemplary modesty and rectitude — wanting only a simple royal wedding with Zara Salim Davidson and declining to accept state-allocated funds.\n\nHis advice to the Perak state government to spend the money for development projects to meet the needs of the people as well as to companies and individuals not to compete to buy advertisement space in newspapers on the occasion of his wedding but to channel the funds for charity, especially donating to places of worship, welfare bodies, old folk homes, orphanages and schools in Perak, demonstrates the sincerity and depth of the Raja Muda’s devotion and commitment to the welfare of the people.\n\nRaja Nazrin’s commendable example should remind Malaysians of a similar advice given by Datuk Seri Abdullah Ahmad Badawi when he first became Prime Minister in November 2003, telling government departments and agencies to be simple and modest and to slash elaborate ceremonies and lavish functions, especially when a Minister, the Prime Minister or the Rulers are present.\n\nHowever such advice to reduce ceremony and extravagance had been observed largely in the breach in the past 40 months, and Raja Nazrin’s “walk-the-talk” example should be an inspiration to all government departments and agencies to start paying heed to the Prime Minister’s advice as far back as November 2003.\n\nHaving won the hearts of Malaysians all over the country and not just in Perak state, Raja Nazrin and Zara’s wedding will be an occasion for joy and pride to all Malaysians in the country and not just confined to Perak state."
