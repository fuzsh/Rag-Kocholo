You will have so much to see from there. Thank you.\n\nWOW! I BOUGHT SO MUCH FOOD FOR BREAKFAST TOMORROW. I WONDER IT WILL TAKE HOW MANY DAYS FOR ME TO FINISH THEM.\n\nBreads go along well with kaya. Spreading some kaya on the bread makes you asking for more than a piece. Bread - RM3.20 and kaya - RM2.30\n\nThey don't sell Gardenia or High Five bread here.\n\nButter cake and cup cakes\n\nThis is called cheese butter cake according to the girl from Taka Bakery. RM5.50\n\nCup cakes at RM2.00 per packet. Quite cheap.\n\nThese are the food I bought from Taka Bakery shop just now when I was on the way back after swimming. Looking at them already make me feel hungry again although I just have my dinner.\n\nDo continue clicking to ads. by nuffnang on the left hand side of Sapphire Blu's blog.

Eaten too much panadols and that did not really help. I thought hard and finally I made up my dicision to go for a short swim since today is the best weather eversince I came back.\n\nQuickly packed my things I need to take to the pool. Have I forgotten anything? When I reached the pool it was still so sunny. Imagine, in the east if 6pm is still sunny. Usually at this time, the sky is getting darker. Had a short swim at Waterpark Stampark, Stutong.\n\nAnyway if I wanted to spend longer time swimming it would be quite impossible too as there were so many people at the pool. Then I remembered. Oh yes!! it is still a school holiday. After I had a quick shower there, I started my journey to go home. On the way back, I stopped over at Taka Bakery shop and bought a loaf of bread, some cakes and kaya.\n\nTook some snapshots along the way home. Wow!! how I missed sunset scenery. It has been a very long time since I saw the beautiful sunset or some people called sundown. Which one you prefer? Sunset or sundown. Anyway, it comes from the same meaning. Sunset or sundown is when the sun begins to fall below the horizon and later on vanish altogether and cannot be seen anymore.\n\nWhen I arrived home, the sky was already getting dark and I can't enjoy myself watching the beautiful scenery of sunset. I wish and pray for good weather tomorrow but I just heard on news that it will be a wet weather here tomorrow.\n\nDo continue clicking Ads. by nuffnang on the left side of Sapphire Blu's blog.
