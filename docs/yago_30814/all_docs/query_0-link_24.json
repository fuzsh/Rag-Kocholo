        "text": "The Raja Permaisuri of Perak was born in the city of Ipoh, Perak on 22 March 1973, she is the youngest of four children of William Stanley Walker Davidson (Salim Davidson), a prominent lawyer in Perak and Kuala Lumpur, and Sharifah Azaliah Syed Omar Shahabudin.\n\nTuanku Zara Salim is also the great granddaughter of the 24th Sultan of Kedah, Almarhum Sultan Abdul Hamid Halim Shah, while her grandfather, Tan Sri Syed Omar Syed Abdullah Shahabudin was the former Menteri Besar of Kedah.\n\nSo it shouldn’t come as a surprise how Her Majesty caught the eye of the current Sultan of Perak, Sultan Nazrin Shah. I’m sure her noble background played a part, but I personally think it was her education and achievements that made her stand out.\n\nIt is known that the Perak royal family has many high achieving individuals, consisting of lawyers and PhD holders. It’s also interesting to note that Her Majesty’s father and father in-law both studied law (one is a lawyer and the other was a judge).\n\nAt 8 years old, Her Majesty represented the state of Perak in Swimming between 1981-1987. She studied at SMK Convent Ipoh and represented her school in Squash and Tennis from 1988-1990.\n\nAfter completing her A-Levels at Prime College in 1992, she left for the United Kingdom to study Chemical Engineering at the University of Nottingham and graduated with first class honours in 1995. She could also speak several foreign languages."
