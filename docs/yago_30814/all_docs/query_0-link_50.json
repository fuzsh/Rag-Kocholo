        "text": "(as reviewed by Arnold Wright)\n\nFurther to our previous posting on Royal Ipoh Club, we now post a review of the club written in 1906.\n\n“The Ipoh Club is situated on a rise looking southwards across the recreation ground seven and a half acres in area. The recreation ground is used for football, cricket, tennis and croquet; and the club premises include bar, billiard, card, reading, bath and dressing rooms. There is also a theatre hall in which concerts and performances of the Kinta Amateur Dramatic Club frequently take place. For the convenience of the motorists a motor garage of considerable size has been provided. The site of the club buildings and of the recreation ground is gazetted as a Government Reserve to be maintained by the Club. The buildings at present are rather disconnected and the Government are being requested to grant the club a more definite title to the land in order that the committee may erect a building more worthy of the commercial centre of Perak. The Ipoh Club is one of the very few clubs in the Federated Malay States in which government officials do not form the majority of attending members. By its constitution, the management of the club is vested in a committee of nine members, eight of whom are elected at a general meeting of the club. The District Officer of Kinta is ex-officio, president. The notice boards of the club are always full of intimations of forthcoming gymkhanas, football, hockey, cricket, tennis and golf matches, and a notice relating to some steeplechase seems never to be absent.\n\n“There are about 500 members of the club, and there are also many visiting members. The club is in a very flourishing condition and only needs better accommodation to make it one of the best clubs in the peninsula. The office bearers are Messrs J. Brewster, President; J. H. Tallock, Vice-President; A.B. McLennan, Hon. Secretary; T.G.D. Cooper, L.M. Woodward, J.I. Philips, R. Reid, S. Martin and F. Wickett, committee; and Mr. A.H. Richards, Secretary.”\n\nFor the original posting on Royal Ipoh Club, please click HERE.\n\nWright, A. (. (1906). Twentieth Century Impressions of British Malaya: Its History, People, Commerce, Industries and Resources. Great Britain: Lloyd’s Greater Britain Publishing Company, Ltd.\n\nRaja Dato’ Seri Azam bin Raja Kamaralzaman was born in Kuala Dipang, Perak on 13 July 1918. He was the only son of the DYAM Raja Di-Hilir Kamaralzaman ibni Raja Mansur and Raja Nasibah binti Raja Ismail[1].\n\nLike his father, Raja Azam was educated at the Malay College, Kuala Kangsar, where he was also head boy, the nurturing ground for the Malay ruling class. In an interview with the Sunday Star in 1996, he recalled, “From the start, we knew that we were being groomed for administrative positions. We were taught a basic course which included English, Mathematics and History. But the most important thing about College was its discipline and dedication – its commitment to excellence.”\n\nHe obtained his Senior Cambridge in 1938 and then furthered his studies at the Raffles College, Singapore, where he obtained a diploma in administration.\n\nIn 1942, Raja Azam began his career in the administrative service and one of his earlier positions was held in the Taiping Land Office. A civil servant was expected to be versatile and he had described in the aforementioned interview that “(one) had to know the law very well as administrators often beckoned the role of magistrates.” By 1952, he was absorbed into the Malayan Civil Service (MCS).\n\nRaja Azam had served as Commissioner of Lands and Mines in Perlis and the District Officer of Kuala Langat, Selangor. After independence, he was the State Secretary of Negeri Sembilan from 1960 to 1962 during the reign of Tuanku Abdul Rahman and Tuanku Munawir and later was the State Secretary of Brunei from 1962 to 1964, at the invitation of Sultan Sir Omar Ali Saifuddien III, the Sultan of Brunei, to help establish the Brunei civil service.\n\nRaja Azam then returned to Malaysia as Secretary-General at the Ministry of Transport from 1967 to 1971. He was requested by Tun Abdul Razak to resign from the Ministry of Transport to become chairman of the Port Swettenham (now Port Klang) Authority from 1971-1977. He was later the Director of Keretapi Tanah Melayu (1978).\n\nRaja Azam died in 1999. He was married to Raja Fatimah binti Raja Zainal Azman, the grand-daughter of Raja Sir Chulan. He had issue, five sons and three daughters.\n\nFootnote:\n\n1. Raja Nasibah was the daughter of Raja Ismail bin Raja Kulop Muhammad and Raja Puteh Aishah binti Sultan Abdullah. She was essentially Raja Kam’s first cousin.\n\n__________________________________\n\nReference:\n\n1. RoyalArk.net\n\n2. Khoo E. Groomed for a life in service. Sunday Star. 1996 June 2."
