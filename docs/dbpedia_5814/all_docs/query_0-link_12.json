        "text": "The article presents the organizational frameworks and methodological problems connected with undertaking the editorial project titled „Historical Atlas of Polish Towns”, which is a part of the international initiative „European Historical Town Atlas” under the auspices of International Commission for the History of Towns. The author underlines a diversified source foundations for the base maps&#39; edition, which, in case of „Historical Atlas of Polish Towns”, was a measurement map; for the towns located in the area of the former Austrian Partition the maps elaborated within the cadastre in 1819-1859 served as a basis of the edition. However, in the former Prussian Partition (Silesia and Pomerania), the cadastre maps elaborated on the grounds of the bill from 1961 proved to be more problematic – the defects of particular map sheets and their incomplete condition forced the editors to use the maps elaborated in different times and according to different measurements. In the article,...\n\nThe aim of the paper is to present the beginnings of the Polish interest in the early medieval past of Kołobrzeg (Kolberg) mainly on the basis of archival sources. For 200 years the town was an important German location, and since 1945 it has been a significant Polish place of memory. However, so far there are no studies dealing with the history of research on the town of Kołobrzeg, although such enquiry subsequently became a canvas of political narratives about the past. The limit of the time-scope covered in the paper is the end of the 1950s, when the first stage of archaeological works on the Kołobrzeg settlement in Budzistowo (Altstadt) were completed. In 1960 a number of enterprises were undertaken in connection with the celebration of the Millennium of the Polish State. The article attempts to answer the question why studies on Kołobrzeg were launched so late, whether it was a top-down or bottom-up initiative and what was the meaning of the research. The source base of the paper consists mainly of archival materials collected in state archives and scientific and cultural institutions.\n\nThe article is an attempt to summarise the current knowledge about the economy of the Przeworsk culture groups settled in the Polish Carpathians during the Roman Period and the early phase of the Migration Period. The source base of this issue are archaeological, archaeobotanical and, to a lesser extent, archaeozoological data. Agriculture, livestock farming and traces of the processing of iron and non-ferrous metals have been certified. In the upper San river basin, production of salt is also likely due to the presence of salty springs in the area.\n\nMilitary issues were deemed vital in the European politics of the nineteenth century. The aim of this article is to trace the most important implications of the 'military bias' of state authorities in the border region between the three empires (Germany, Russia and Austria – later the Austro-Hungarian Empire) which occupied the Central and Eastern part of the continent. Military authorities sometimes exercised a particularly strong infl uence upon urban policy. The two major issues addressed in this article are the fortifi cations (their creation, strengthening, and spatial development) which infl uenced urban sprawl – though perhaps not so much as is maintained in the scholarly literature – and the development of railways. The directions and tracks chosen for the railways were also infl uenced by the military plans, which in turn often differed much from the visions of the urban offi cials who made up the administration of the city."
