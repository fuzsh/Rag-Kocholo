        "text": "The Desert Locust is probably the oldest and most feared migratory pest in the world, plaguing farmers in Africa and Asia since Phaoronic times. Under optimal conditions, locusts increase rapidly and form swarms. A single swarm, larger than Paris or Cairo, can contain billions of insects, migrate across continents, and eat enough food for 2,500 people in one day. During plagues, vulnerable households can find themselves in debt, limited national resources are rapidly depleted and food security can be at risk in affected countries. It can take several years and hundreds of millions of dollars to bring a plague to an end. Changes in the climate during the remainder of this century will affect Desert Locust habitats, breeding, migration and plague dynamics in West Asia and North Africa (WANA). Although it is widely acknowledged that WANA will become warmer, there are differing views about changes in precipitation under the various climate change scenarios. General trends may contain hidden variations within the regions and countries. Certain areas will become more prone to extreme events such as flooding and droughts. Regular assessment of climate change impacts is a component of the locust early warning system operated by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations to monitor the global situation and alert locust-affected countries and international donors. The latest scientific evidence is reviewed to postulate potential effects on the Desert Locust. It is probably reasonable to assume that this ancient pest, which is particularly well suited for survival under difficult conditions in arid areas and has successfully endured previous changes in the climate, will adapt to climate variability in the foreseeable future.\n\nWithin the framework of research being carried out in Poland on straight-stemmed populations of the black locust tree, it proved possible to identify three stands in west of the country suitable for further study on properties of the wood of this species. Subsequent analysis of radial profiles carried out on discs taken from ten sample trees (from each of the stands) allowed for the identification of two periods of growth (1990–1999 and 2000–2014) that are characterised by a different dynamic. At the same time, confirmation was offered for a significant influence of an interaction between the population factor and years, when it came to the shaping of annual growth rings, this pointing to both the individual- and population-level nature of the variability to radial growth in the species. Tree rings generated on the southern and eastern sides of the trunk are shown to be significantly wider than those on the northern and western sides. These regularities may reflect insolation, and t...\n\nInsects that are potentially harmful to agriculture have shaped agricultural practices and policy-making worldwide. For some species and geographies, historical research still needs to be done. This is not only crucial to understanding the past, but also the present and future of pest surges. An overview of Iberian history in relation to the Moroccan locust (Dociostaurus maroccanus) between 1898 and 1947 reveals a) the historical distribution of locust invasions, showing that they were much larger than previously suggested; b) how outbreaks triggered local, regional and national responses, including mandatory regulations, in the last two centuries at least; c) differences and similarities, between countries, and over time, in the control measures applied, which reflect perceptions about the role of authorities and the efficacy of those measures. This paper also adds clarity to the discussion about the factors involved in the decline of outbreaks in recent years and provides a crucial context for future Orthoptera management programmes."
