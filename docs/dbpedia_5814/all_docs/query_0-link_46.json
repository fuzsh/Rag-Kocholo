The rest of the Czech and Moravian regions are below 75% of the average EU threshold and, as a result, these regions are entitled to draw support from the EU funds. The second richest region is Central Bohemia, with 70% of the European average. The poorest region is Central Moravia in which GDP is 59.8% (per citizen) of the European average. The Czech Republic, being one of the post-communist countries, is politically and economically stable. Inflation here is considered to be one of the lowest in Europe, although it rose markedly to 7.5% in January 2008, this being its maximum since November The country s economy is mainly industrial. The largest sector is engineering, reflecting the strength of the motor car companies and their sub suppliers which are experiencing a great boom. The efficiency of the Czech economy is rising; the year-on-year growth of GDP in the third quarter of the year 2007 was 6%. The economy has maintained growth of 6% or more for 10 quarters in a row. GDP was 3.2 trillion CZK at the end of 2006, which came to 313,662 CZK per citizen. Turning to unemployment, this has fallen slightly in the past few months. It was 6.1% in January Increasingly, companies are looking for greater numbers of competent staff, whether they are qualified experts or ordinary blue-collar workers or craftsmen. As a result of this demand for experienced staff, gross wages are rising. The average of the gross wage was 21,470 CZK in the third quarter of 2007 (year-on-year growth was 7.6 %). Frequent revisions of important laws, the generally opaque system of laws, the rising deficiency of the working force, the slow construction of the motorway infrastructure, an overprotective labour code, slow courts and the poor system of claiming rights are the pressing problems of the corporate environment. Some companies also worry about the strengthening of the Czech crown. Income tax of corporate bodies will, based on the last year s government reform, gradually fall. The rate fell from 24% to 21% during the taxation period for 2008; it will be lowered to 20% in 2009 and to 19% in Individuals, including entrepreneurs, pay 15% flat tax during the taxation period of 2008, which will fall to 12.5% in There have been changes in VAT as a result of the recent government reforms. The base rate for VAT is 19% but the reduced rate rose from 5% to 9% in January Financially interconnected companies can use group registration to register for VAT from the beginning of this year. The groups and the size of groups of companies are voluntary. The groups can then report and hand in the declaration of taxes as a single entity. Paper handling and costs, therefore, will be reduced. Consumer tax has to be paid for spirits, beer, wine and intermediate products such as mineral oils and tobacco products. Details for this are stated in law no. 353/2003, St., as amended. A special type of reform, the so-called ecological energy tax, has been put into practice since This tax has to be paid for the damage to the environment which is done when energy is produced. These taxes, with a few exceptions, are on electricity, gas and solid fuels. Renewable resources or ecological sources and gas to provide heating in households are exempt from this tax. Vehicle Excise Duty has to be paid for road carriages and their attached vehicles used for business purposes. Details and more concrete rates are stated in law no. 16/1993, St., as amended. Among other taxes there are real-estate transfer taxes, gift taxes, succession duty and real estate (property) taxes. There are many associated administrative charges and these changes can be found in law no. 634/2004, 353/2003, St., as amended. The main regulations for entrepreneurs are Commercial Code (no. 513/1991St.), The Trade Licensing Act (no. 455/1991 St.), and Labour Code (no. 262/2006 St.). Overall legal regulations are fragmented and consist of many other regulations (mainly contained in the Civil Code, Consumer Protection, Employment Act, Building Act, Insolvency Act, Economic Competition Protection Act and many other tax laws). The Companies Register is the main registry for entrepreneurs, which is accessible on. The Trades Register is for sole traders with its website. Unless the applicant runs the business as an individual (there are some exceptions but they must have a business licence), the applicant can set up a number of types of companies. The two most common companies are a limited liability company and a joint stock company. Other forms of companies include a public limited company, a limited partnership company, and a contingent company, which are also mentioned in the Commercial Code. A limited liability company is a company whose capital stock is made up of deposits from all partners who are liable for the accountability of the company until the company is registered in the Companies Register. The company can be set up by one person and it can have up to 50 members. One individual may be a partner in up to three limited liability companies. The capital stock has to be at least 200,000 CZK. The company is liable for all its debts and liabilities. Partners are jointly and severally liable for the company s liabilities up to the total amount of the unpaid part of the deposits of all the partners in accordance with the written status of the company in the Companies Register. Similar conditions for establishing limited liability companies can be found in of the Commercial Code. The capital stock of a joint stock company is itemized into a certain number of shares which have a nominal amount per share. The shares can be issued in the name of the owner or another individual. The company may be set up by one founder, if he is a corporate body, or by two or more founders. The capital stock of the company established by a tender offer has to be at least 20 million CZK. Where a company is set up without undergoing the tender offer the capital stock has to be at least 2 million CZK. The company is liable for all its debts and liabilities. Shareholders are not liable for the company s liabilities. Detailed conditions for establishing joint stock companies are specified in of the Commercial Code.

These kinds of investments fully demand a qualified and sophisticated labour force. Mentioned projects are making a major contribution to the knowledge-based economy. In the competition among countries for placement of direct foreign investment, it is absolutely necessary to offer a qualified and highly-educated working force. Czech Republic (the former Czechoslovakia) ranked among countries with the highest percentage of university-science and technology graduates in the world. Presently this tradition continues: the number of university-science and technology graduates directly related to the highest in Europe. Our country also pays considerable attention to foreign-language education, where English and German predominate. At least one world language is studied by 76 % of university students, while 20% study two and 4% study three or more languages. The outstanding geographical location of the Czech Republic - in the centre of Europe - offers excellent connections to the majority of the important transit routes. The Czech transportation network belongs to one of the best among countries in Central and Eastern Europe. As for the offer of business properties suitable for manufacturing and production, business support services and technology centres, CzechInvest Business Development and Investment agency administers a business property database which currently consists of more than 350 industrial zones and buildings fully prepared for potential investors, including the necessary infrastructure. The Czech Ministry of Industry and Trade s special support programme for industrial-zone development has been operated in the Czech Republic since The project also helps to mediate cooperation between the state, developers and local authorities. In addition to this fact, since 1998 the Czech Republic has been offering another benefit - investment incentives to the manufacturing, business support services and technology centres investors (both foreign and domestic). Investment incentives and support for investors The Investment Incentives Act precisely defines the criteria for receiving incentives, from the outset it has been discussed with the European Commission and complies with the EU s rules for granting state aid. The Czech investment-support scheme includes tax relief, job-creation grants, training and retraining grants as well as construction and development of industrial properties. Investors can obtain distinctive state aid in the regions worst affected by unemployment (support of job creation programmes, employment of people registered at the labour office, secondary school graduates and the handicapped). However, companies or projects which, for whatever reason, do not meet the criteria of the Investment Incentives Act may take advantage of another form of the aid available in the Czech Republic, for example EU structural funds. The Czech Republic a European hub of new technologies and innovation Since 1993 a host of major multinational companies have come to the Czech Republic, investing billions of dollars in our country and creating tens of thousands of new jobs. For example, Czech Republic is now home to global management centres of DHL; Accenture, Olympus, Honeywell and IBM. Among Central Bohemia production you can find the car factory of Toyota Peugeot Citroen Automobile (TPCA), which is one of the biggest investment projects of any kind in Europe. We shouldn t forget to mention the most successful project from the automotive sector Hyundai, whose investment of 1.2 billion dollars represents the investment record in the Czech Republic. Hyundai created more than 3,000 new jobs and its full production reached 300,000 cars a year. Investment projects such as IPS Alpha and Hitachi, which are involved in the unequalled concentration of production of LCD monitors and flat-screen televisions, requiring the creation of a remarkable number of new jobs. Each project employs up to 2,000 people. The structure of foreign investments recently shows that the Czech Republic is shifting from quantity towards quality. Investors who require thousands of cheap workers are moving further east and there are more and more smaller projects heading to the Czech Republic which employ a high educated labour force with language skills. The big potential of a small country In the near future the trend of direct investment into sophisticated production, research and development activities, business shared services can be expected to continue in the Czech Republic. Greater emphasis in business development projects will be placed on modern fields such as biotechnology, nanotechnology, microelectronics and pharmaceuticals. Czech Republic is directly located in the centre of Europe, often called the heart of Europe. It has huge potential and will not be afraid to use it. CzechInvest, the Investment and Business Development Agency, is an agency coordinated by the Ministry of Industry and Trade of the Czech Republic. CzechInvest fully supports coming FDI (foreign direct investment), business activities of local small and medium sized enterpreneurs with a wide range of services, development programmes to attract investment projects and promote the development of Czech companies and the country s business environment abroad. The main objective of CzechInvest is to advise and support existing and new entrepreneurs and foreign investors in the Czech Republic. The agency acts as an intermediary between the EU and small and medium-sized enterprises in utilizing EU Structural Funds in the Czech Republic. In order to facilitate contacts with foreign investors, CzechInvest has eight branch offices around the world Brussels, Cologne, Munich, London, Paris, Hong Kong, Yokohama, and two in the United States (Chicago). With the aim of being as near as possible to our existing and potential clients within the Czech Republic, the agency also operates 13 regional offices.

Rapid growth in Brno, a growing market in large regional cities such as Ostrava and PlzeÀ and emerging smaller regional markets are expected to contribute to the overall Czech office market in PRAGUE Prague, however, remains the central hub for modern offices in the country with most international companies present in the Czech Republic. The total modern office stock (A-class and B-class buildings with more than 800 m 2 of rentable space) comprised 2,182,285 m 2 at the end of the year 2007, increasing by more than 10 percent from Around 69.4 percent of the total stock is represented by A-class properties. In 2007, new supply reached 162,000 m percent of this new supply was in inner city location most of that in Prague 4. The rest is located in the outer city. The number of new construction or refurbishment in the city centre remained on the low level with only one significant project in the pipeline with expected completion in 1Q Around 68 percent of the total stock in 2007 is represented by newly built properties. Major completions in 2007 comprised âsob building (37,700 m 2 ), Gemini building A (17,550 m 2 ), E-Gate (16,855 m 2 ), Technology Centre âeská Spofiitelna (15,000 m 2 ), BB Centre building E (14,600 m 2 ), Oasis Florenc (14,393 m 2 ), The Park buildings 9 and 11 (7,600 m 2 and 7,836 m 2 ) and East Building (7,212 m 2 ). Although Brno started to develop five years ago, the Brno office market already has a well established position among other regional markets. It is not only due to the existence of universities and direct traffic connections to Prague, Bratislava and Vienna, but Brno also offers attractive conditions to IT, shared services and call centres. The total modern office stock reached more than 177,000 m 2 in 2007 and it is expected to grow to more than 240,000 m 2 by the end of Although speculative development plays a significant role in current market growth and higher vacancy rate is related to the rapid expansion of the market, new projects are completed in response to expected demand. Ostrava is becoming an increasingly attractive location for developers as well as for international and Czech companies looking for office space to lease. With a population of approximately 1.2 million people, the Moravia-Silesia Region offers a sufficient quantity of qualified labour force as well as new university graduates. Educated people and an easily accessible location give the city an important competitive advantage. Large companies already recognised this high potential and some of them currently thinking above locating their call centres and shared service centres there. The total stock reached nearly 65,000 m 2 in The office market in PlzeÀ is in its early stage of development with first signs of activity. The total office stock was almost 40,000 m 2 in The future growth of supply will be strongly influenced by the success of the existing projects. The growth of the Czech economy is also contributing to the development of office markets in regions. An inflow of foreign direct investments and good relationships with neighbouring countries are the examples of the main key drivers. âeské Budûjovice, Hradec Králové, Liberec, Ústí nad Labem, Pardubice and Olomouc are shifting into the focus of developers and prospective tenants but currently offer only a small amount of modern office space. Major completions expected in 2008 are Kavãí Hory (42,120 m 2 ), City Tower (42,072 m 2 ), Palladium (20,000 m 2 ), PPF building âeská poji Èovna seat (20,000 m 2 ), Gemini building B (18,734 m 2 ), Opatov Park (13,500 m2), The Park building 12 (12,000 m 2 ) and Corso Karlín IIa (10,724 m 2 ). When compared to the previous year, take-up of office space was significantly lower in 2007, reaching a volume of 195,197 m 2. Regarding the structure of take-up, 2007 saw a shift back towards the newly built properties. These included more than 80 percent of all transactions - significantly more than in the previous year. The financial and professional services, banking, insurance, and manufacturing sectors recorded the largest take-up per sector in The average size of a deal in 2007 was 685 m 2. We expect total take-up for 2008 to be around 200,000 m 2. The most significant take-up deals in 2007 were Skanska (13,500 m 2 in Opatov Park in Prague 4), Raiffeisenbank (8,796 m 2, renegotiation in Raiffeisen Centrum in Prague 4), Generali Poji Èovna (8,389 m 2 in City Element in Prague 4), âeská spofiitelna (8,300 m 2 in E-Gate in Prague 6), PPF Investments (8,035 m 2 in E-Gate in Prague 6), Vegacom (5,200 m 2 in KCD 4 in Prague 10), Toyota (4,800 m 2 in Toyota HG in Prague 5), âeské dráhy Cargo (3,200 m 2 in Lighthouse in Prague 8), Unipetrol (3,143 m 2 in Gemini building A in Prague 4), Komerãní banka (2,922 m 2 in Rokytka I in Prague 9), TNS Aisa (2,739 m 2 in Trianon in Prague 4), Ness Technologies (2,695 m 2 in The Park building 9 in Prague 4) and Fujitsu Siemens (2,500 m 2 in The Park building 11 in Prague 4). Prague 4 remained the most attractive district in Prague with more than 32 percent of the total take-up in Prague. The vacancy rate in Prague dropped from 2 percent at the end of 2006 to 5.76 percent at the end of 2007, which was 125,622 m 2 of office space. This was mainly due to a lack of new office stock coming onto the market and constantly increasing demand. The vacancy rate of Class A office buildings reached 5.7 percent and Class B properties had a vacancy rate of 5.97 percent. The declining vacancy and the shortage of available stock in the city centre created favourable conditions for slight growth of prime rents than in previous years. Rents currently range between 19 and 20 per m 2 per month. The overall rental prediction for 2008 is stable although the expected extensive new supply with the exception of the city centre may create a pressure for rent reduction. REGIONAL MARKETS There is a significantly growing interest from international occupiers for modern, A-class purpose-built office space in secondary cities across the Czech Republic. Demand is mainly driven by the shared service sector and call centre industries searching for a cost effective alternative to Prague. Up to now, developers have predominantly focused on Brno and Ostrava. With the expected improvements of regional infrastructure and the shortage of qualified labour in Prague, the regional office markets will continue strengthening their position.

Since its establishment in 1992, the agency has played a role in 963 investments worth a total of EUR billion. Nearly 188,000 people have found or will find work directly in projects mediated by CzechInvest, with thousands of other jobs being created in related projects. In 2007 alone, 182 companies turned to CzechInvest with projects valued at nearly EUR 3.6 billion. In terms of the number of new investors, 2007 was thus the most successful year in the agency s history. Czech companies were the most active, followed closely by investors from Germany and the United States. Last year, new investors in the Czech Republic undertook to create 30,598 new jobs. Investors find success in the Czech Republic Among the 182 projects in which the agency took part last year, 65% involved expansions. This means that companies in the Czech Republic have been successful to the point that not only are they not interested in leaving, but are rather expanding their activities. The expansion of production on the part of investors operating in the Czech Republic is clearly the most important indicator of the domestic business environment s quality. Particularly gratifying is the fact that in the great majority of cases these expansions represent a qualitative leap and bring investment in state-of-the-art technologies, services and research and development. Credit for the lion s share of these expansions goes to investors that CzechInvest has cooperated with over the years. A range of these investors first set up manufacturing projects in the Czech Republic and are now establishing development centres and centres providing the broadest range of business services, from accounting and customer service to custom software development. Strengthening research and development Twenty-eight new technology centres for science and research have been established in the Czech Republic with CzechInvest s assistance, which is the same number of investors who decided for the Czech Republic in 2007 in this field. Half of these applied for inclusion in the national Framework Programme for the Support of Technology Centres and Centres of Shared Services, whereas the other half chose the European Potential Programme. In 2006, CzechInvest attracted 13 similar projects to the Czech Republic. CzechInvest expects similar development also among centres providing business services. There were 13 fewer investments last year in comparison with However, this was not due to a lack of interest on the part of investors, but rather on their waiting for the launch of national and European support programmes. The national programme started in the first half of April 2007; the European programme began this year. The greatest number of investors last year focused on South Moravia. In coming years, 3,900 people will find work there in 40 new companies worth CZK 13 billion. The Ústí region ranked second with 31 projects, while the North Moravia, Olomouc and Plzen regions each attracted 17 new investors.

On January 1, 2006 the area of Prague amounted to 496 km 2 (0.6 % of Czech Republic territory). The region (kraj) of Prague is smaller then all other Czech regions. Its population was decreasing in the last 15 years but now it is growing again with more people moving to the capital. Population of the metropolitan region on December 31, 2006 reached 1,188,126 inhabitants, i.e % of the population of the Czech Republic. As number of inhabitants is concerned, Prague is number two among regions, second only to Moravskoslezsk kraj (Moravia-Silesia). The Historic Centre of Prague was put on the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1992 as one of the largest urban sanctuaries in the world. There are more then 1,300 historic buildings protected by law as national monuments. The capital s economy is being strongly supported by the mass development of tourism. Prague accommodation services account for half of nights spent by foreign tourists in Czech Republic. The capital is also number one among destinations for all foreign tourists visiting the country (89.8 %). However, some indexes put Prague in an inferior position, e.g. average number of nights spent (by foreign tourists) per capita in this respect Prague is second to the region Karlovy Vary. The Czech capital is still lacking accommodation capacity in the category of five star hotels. Prague is also the seat of several universities. Univerzita Karlova (Universitas Carolina - Charles University) was founded in Virtually all non-technical fields of studies are being taught at its 17 colleges, 14 of which are located in Prague. Other examples of Prague s universities are: âeské vysoké uãení technické (âvut - Czech Technical University), Vysoká kola ekonomická (V E - University of economics) âeská zemûdûlská univerzita (âzu - Czech University of Life Sciences) and Vysoká kola chemicko-technologická (V CHT - Institute of Chemical Technology). Study of the arts is available at Akademie múzick ch umûní (AMU - Academy of Performing Arts), Akademie v tvarn ch umûní (AVU - Academy of Fine Arts) and Vysoká kola umûlecko prûmyslová (V UP - Academy of Arts Architecture and Design). The Police Academy of the Czech Republic is also located in the capital. More then 20 private universities have been founded in Prague since In the area of research and development of new technologies, Prague is the undisputed leader in the country. Nearly all of the institutes of the Academy of Sciences of Czech Republic are seated in Prague. Expenditure on science and research in 2004 per capita in the Prague Region amounted to Kã 11,362 with 2.06 % of employees from the capital working in this field. For several years now, Prague has seen development in the line of retailing, transport and tourism. In the manufacturing industry, production of business machines and computers is in good shape and there is there is starting to be growth in the construction business. Prague, as a seat for business, has its advantageous points: there is a qualified workforce and supplying firms within easy reach. Furthermore, universities and other schooling institutions, as well as development centers, are at hand to provide education for prospective employees. Traditional domains that are well developed in Prague and its vicinity are car manufacturing, pharmaceutical and brewing industries. The strong potential of this region is re-enforced by its well developed structure of roads and railways connected to the European transportation network, well established municipal transport although the road orbital has not been yet completed, and the newly refurbished airport with 50 regular flight connections. There is good accommodation capacity in the capital, many historic buildings and monuments, more than average density of the telephone system network, a population with a high proportion of people in productive age, highly qualified workforce and a high proportion of foreign investments flowing to the city. Suppliers are never far away. Sciences, education, health care and culture in the region are of a very top quality.\n\n11 BASIC ECONOMIC & DEMOGRAPHIC DATA BASIC DATA Land Area km 2 ADMINISTRATIVE BREAKDOWN Number of districts...1 Number of municipalities...1 of that, number of towns...1 POPULATION Total...1,188,126 Percentage in the total population of Czech Republic (%) Population density (persons/km 2 )...2,395 Average work force...720,113 Number of job seekers...21,364 NUMBER OF ECONOMIC UNITS ACCORDING TO PREVAILING ACTIVITY Total...437,882 Industry...35,354 Construction...40,040 Agriculture & forestry...2,964 Services...359,524 REPRESENTATION OF PROFESSIONAL CLASSES (%) Unskilled and unqualified workers Plant and machine operators and assemblers Craft and related trades workers Skilled agricultural and forestry workers Workers in services & sales Administrative Specialists Legislators, senior officials and managers...

It is situated virtually in the middle of the country and neighbors eight other regions apart from Prague. The region (kraj) is divided among 12 districts (okres): Bene ov, Beroun, Kladno, Kolín, Kutná Hora, Mûlník, Mladá Boleslav, Nymburk, Praha-v chod (Prague-East), Praha-západ (Prague-West), Pfiíbram and Rakovník. Middle Bohemia is the largest of Czech regions. On January 1, 2006 its area amounted to 11,015 km 2 (14 % of Czech territory). The region s population on December 31, 2006 ranked third among the regions of Czech Republic with 1,172,254 persons, i.e % of the country s population. There are altogether 1,146 communities in Middle Bohemia i.e % of all communities in Czech Republic (the most of all regions). The administration of the region is seated in Prague but its largest town is Kladno with 69,276 inhabitants. There are altogether 38 towns with a population exceeding 5,000 people in Middle Bohemia. Middle Bohemia is a region used by most Prague citizens for their leisure and entertainment activities on weekends. Protected landscape areas (Kfiivoklátsko, âesk kras, âesk ráj, Kokofiínsko) and river basins of Sázava and Berounka are among the most popular destinations. Big tourist highlights are located in the historic downtown of Kutná Hora with St. Barbora s Dome, and Our Lady s Assumption cathedral in Sedlec. Kutná Hora has certain limitations in the capacity of its accommodation and in gastronomic services. Karl tejn castle which is only now trying to get on the UNESCO World heritage list is undoubtedly the most visited castle in Czech Republic. There are other significant castles in the region, namely Kfiivoklát, Toãník, âesk ternberk, Konopi tû, Lány or Mûlník. Citizens of the region study mostly at universities in Prague. In the territory of Middle Bohemia there is just one public university Faculty of Biomedical Engineering of âvut in Kladno. For private universities there is a branch of The Institute of Finance and Administration in Kladno, Academia Rerum Civilium in Kolín (political and social science university), Stfiedoãesk vysoko kolsk institut (Middle- Bohemian Academic Institute) in Kladno and koda Auto University in Mladá Boleslav. The Czech Academy of Sciences has several of its institutes seated in Middle Bohemia: Astronomical Institute (Ondfiejov), Institute of Botany (PrÛhonice), Institute of Inorganic Chemistry and Nuclear Physics Institute ( eï u Prahy). Expenses per capita on research and science in Middle Bohemia in 2004 amounted to Kã 6,326. In this respect, Middle Bohemia is number two among the regions of Czech Republic. Economical structures of the region are in many respects complementing to those of Prague. Nevertheless, Middle Bohemia is more concentrated on farming (Labe lowlands) and the manufacturing industry. The dominant position belongs to the car making industry (Mladá Boleslav, Kolín) and sectors linked to it. There are also some important machinery producers in the region. In some respects Middle Bohemia gains from its proximity to Prague. The region s car making industry and technological cluster could have an impact on an inter-regional or international scale. The region s potential stems from its closeness to the capital, complemented by integrated transportation systems directly connected to Prague. Roads and railroads of crucial importance pass through Middle Bohemia. A high rate of immigration from other regions is one of its assets, as well as a multitude of landmarks and monuments, the extent of spending on research and sciences, the strength of the car making industry (with a large network of sub-contractors) and generally good conditions for development of farming and industry.\n\n17 BASIC ECONOMIC & DEMOGRAPHIC DATA BASIC DATA Land Area...11,015 km 2 ADMINISTRATIVE BREAKDOWN Number of districts...12 Number of municipalities...1,146 of that, number of towns...74 POPULATION Total...1,175,254 Percentage in the total population of Czech Republic (%) Population density (persons/km 2 ) Average work force...629,287 Number of job seekers...35,498 NUMBER OF ECONOMIC UNITS ACCORDING TO PREVAILING ACTIVITY Total...275,787 Industry...37,542 Construction...36,220 Agriculture & forestry...16,151 Services...185,874 REPRESENTATION OF PROFESSIONAL CLASSES (%) Unskilled and unqualified workers Plant and machine operators and assemblers Craft and related trades workers Skilled agricultural and forestry workers Workers in services & sales Administrative Specialists Legislators, senior officials and managers Armed forces Technical, health care, pedagogical workers & workers in similar sectors of which Technicians in physical, technical & related branches Technicians in biology, health care & agriculture Pedagogical workers Others assistant skilled workers...46 EDUCATION POPULATION MORE THAN 15 YEARS OLD AVERAGE MONTHLY GROSS WAGE 5-YEAR TREND 31.9 % 8.1 % 19.7 % Basic and without education Secondary without GCE Secondary with GCE 40.3 % 25,000 22,000 19,000 16,000 13,000 10,000 CZK/year Czech Republic Region 15,844 15,560 16,917 16,571 18,035 17,704 19,631 19,185 20,844 20,428 GDP BY REGIONS Total Per capita Region mln.
