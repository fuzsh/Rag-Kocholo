        "text": "Over 12,500 record data were used to compile new, considerably updated maps showing the distribution of 10 insectivore species over the territory of the Czech Republic. The known distribution scheme has been confirmed in most of the species, either their areal occurrence all over the territory (Sorex araneus, S. minutus, Neomys fodiens, Crocidura suaveolens, Talpa europaea), or their more or less regional distribution (Sorex alpinus, Neomys anomalus). Data obtained on two species tend to suggest continuing expansion of their sub-ranges in central Europe in the northward (Crocidura leucodon) or eastward (Erinaceus europaeus) direction. On the other hand, the present records of Erinaceus roumanicus do not reach the western limit of occurrence as established in the 1980s. Also, the data on the occurrence of insectivores were subject to hypsometric analysis. While some species showing rather overall distribution roughly copy the altitudinal relief of this country (Sorex araneus, S. minu..."
