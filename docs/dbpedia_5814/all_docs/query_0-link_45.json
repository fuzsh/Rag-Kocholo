It is located in the North Bohemia and has Ploučnice River flowing through and the historic core at its north bank. In the area of 24 sq mi the city of Česká Lípa comprises 14 parts with population of 38 181 permanent inhabitants. Its old town has been built by the Water Castle near a ford via the Ploučnice River where a Slavonic colony existed from the 10th century. The ancestry of Ronovci and Jindřich z Lipé in particular contributed to the founding of the city[1] in 1305 to 1319 and the stem of Berkové z Dubé promoted its development. A hundred years later the city was occupited by Hussite army of Jan Roháč z Dubé and affected with devastating fires. Founding a monastery and school Alberf of Valdštejn, and later Kaunitzs, contributed to another boom of the city. After the founding of Czechoslovakia (The Czech Republic today), when a meeting of 25 000 Nazis took place downtown in 1934, the city became a center of nationality unrest. Modern urban looks and development has been influenced by industrial production in the city and uranium mining in the region. Residential neighborhoods consisting of prefab housing in large were built on the outskirts while the city center was preserved and enunciated as an urban heritage zone.[2]\n\nGenesis\n\nThe territory of the city nowadays was not inhabited permanently until the 13th century. The first written reference of settlement comes from year 1263 and is included in the Doksany Prior's purchase roll. The history of the city is associated with Ronovci[1] ancestry's name of Chvala ze Žitavy, who founded the Lipý Castle, and mainly his grandson Jindřich z Lipé (1270–1329), a significant royal aristocrat. As rolls have not been preserved, it is not clear who exactly of the ancestry founded the castle and settlement around. Thus the Lipý Castle became their another fortified seat in the North Bohemia on the route of trade ways that time. As mentioned above, there were a Slavonic colony of that name near the castle, later renamed to Stará Lípa (a part of the city today).[3] There is a reference of Arnold, said to come from Stará Lípa, who used to be a burgess in Kravaře (a small town today). Historians derive from the reference of Stará Lípa that the Lipý Castle and the colony were established around.[4] Jindřich z Lipé moved to Moravia in 1319 after he had sold the castle with its surroundings to his cousin Hynek Berka. According to other news, in 1327 the mentioned Hynek Berka z Dobé, also a member of the ancestry of Ronovci and rich Prague burgrave, was the lord of Lipá and wide surroundings. When he died in 1348, his son of the same name took the grip and after his death the second of sons Jinřich succeeded him. Then his nephew Hynek Berka z Dubé reigned the area. The eldest city charter, which he issued on March 23, 1381, documents that discretions were granted to the city of Lipá and that it was he who contributed the most to the boom of the city and the castle bearing the same name.\n\nCity walls were constructed in the beginning of the 14th century as well as a perish church of St. Paul and Peter, which was destroyed when fires affected the city in 1787. it was canonized by Peter of Aspelt, the Mayence archbishop, in 1312 in the presence of Jan Lucemburský, the Czech king. The Dean's Office of Děčín was delegated to him in 1341.[1]\n\nIn the second half of the 14th century the family of Weitmile was concerned significantly in the development of the city even behind its walls. Members of this family used to hold positions of reeve and parsons. Petr z Weitmile was assigned as a witness on the granting of the urban discretions document by Hynek Berka z Dubé in 1381.[1] Development of the city and a larger part of Bohemia was paused by a great plague epidemic in 1389. In the end of the 14th century the castle was controlled by other members of lords of Lipá family, of which a powerful and significant Hynek Hlaváč was often referred, until the beginning of Hussite wars when in May 1426 it was carried by Hussites lead by Jan Roháč z Dubé[5] and became their considerable stronghold until 1436. In years 1502 to 1553 a larger part of the city and its surroundings belonged to Vartenberks. Later, the lords of Dubá / Lipá gained the castle again and kept it over 100 years. Albrecht of Valdštejn reunited the city in 1622 to 1623 being disintegrated by Berkas.[6] The city was destroyed in large part in 1787 and 1820.\n\nEmblem and Flag of the city\n\nThe emblem of the city originates in the urban seal from 1389.

The first one is on the railway Bakov nad Jizerou - Jedlová and the second one to Děčín. Downtown Station (Česká Lípa město) was canceled in 1979 and a railway connecting it with the central station in length of three quartesrs of a mile is not in use any more. Now train stop (with a misguiding name today) Vlčí důl - Dobranov belongs to the city as this peripheral area has become a neighboorhood of Česká Lípa. Railroads and stations have been built by various companies. The first railway was built in 1867 leading to the town of Bakov nad Jizrou and in opposite direction leading from the Central Station built in 1867 via train stop of Česká Lípa střelnice built in 1869 to the town of Rumburk. Another railway was opened in 1872 to the town of Bdnešov nad Ploučnicí and later prolonged to the city of Děčín. Another company then built the downtown station out of which the first train went to the town of Litoměřice and in 1903 the railway leading from Česká Lípa to Řetenice u Teplic and in opposite direction leading via the town of Zákupy to the city of Liberec. The railway from Česká Lípa střelnice to the town of Česká Kamenice was completed and opened in 1903 and large railway workshops was constructed in the vicinity of the central station. National corporation of ŽOS (Railway Repair and Engineering Workshops) had its seat here until 1980. The railway leading to Česká Kamenice was canceled over time, in 1979 to be precise, and its subsoil was used for building of a part of the Varhany Cycling Path. Railways in the city and peripherals are connected. The downtown station built in 1898 is out of service now and Czech Railways offer it for sale nowadays. The railway from this station leading to the neighborhood of Vlčí důl has been canceled and its subsoil used for construction of the cyclying path no. 3054. Three short sidings unused and blocked lead from the central station to several former factory and industrial buildings in Svárov neighborhood.\n\nThere are four directions to which trains are dispatched from the central station.\n\n080 Bakov – Česká Lípa – Rumburk, leads northwards\n\n081 Česká Lípa – Děčín, leads westwards\n\n086 Česká Lípa – Liberec, leads southeastwards then northeeastwards\n\n087 Česká Lípa – Lovosice, leads southwards\n\nRailways 081 and 086 are joined by many trains. Ordinary passenger trains use them for routes from Liberec to Děčín and express ones from Liberec to Ústí nad Labem.\n\nBus Transportation\n\nregional and intercity transportation, mainly ČSAD Česká Lípa Co., using its bus station from 1986,[17] provides connection in directions to towns of Mimoň, Nový Bor, Praha and connecting the city with surrounding towns and villages.\n\nSmall transportations companies (such as Mirobus for instance) provide transport for commuters of local large companies or offer an alternative transportation for Czech Railways in case of lockouts etc. Nevertheless, Municipal transit company of BusLine Co. has taken over most of such services.\n\nMunicipal Transit\n\nMunicipal Transit is provided with city buses exclusively (no ligh rail or trolley bus transit). Regional corporation of ČSAD with its seat in Ústí nad Labem and depot in Česká Lípa provided the municipal transit until 1993. Then from 1993 to 2008 the transit was provided by Vett Co. (with a month break in 2007). Another company, ČSAD Semily Co. became the carrier by February 2008 and city routes was legalized with licenses in April 2008. Several legal actions and complaints were engaged in the legal dispute betweeh the city and Vett Co.[18] To comply with reginal integrated transport regulations, routes of Ceska Lipa Municipal Transit was renumbered by March 1, 2008 and the transit operation optimized with regular intervals and service interlacing on main routes. After fusion of ČSAD Semily and ČSAD Jablonec nad Nisou companies in December 2010 a new company BusLine Co. was established and this one became the new transit carrier in Česká Lípa.[19]\n\n.\n\nThere exists the,[20] an oranizational constituent of Lípa 2 civic association, which monitors the transit development, negotiates with the city, other authorities as well as carriers, and brings complete information in its website.\n\nRoad Transportation\n\nThe most important of this kind is a straight superlevel I/9 Road leading south to north from Praha to Nový Bor from 1987.[21] From west to east there is a II/262 Road from Děčín to Zákupy.
