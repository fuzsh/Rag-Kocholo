Designed and conceived as a set of texts expanding on and complementing the contents of the research catalogue for the exhibition Karel Škréta (1610–1674): His Work and His Era published by the National Gallery in Prague in 2010, the individual essays elaborate new ﬁndings made in the course of the vast interdisciplinary project Karel Škréta (1610–1674): His Work and His Era and the preparation of the eponymous exhibition. The authors of individual essays concentrated on themes that were so broad they could only be outlined in the catalogue or were not included at all. We must also note that from the start, the story of the Škréta research was also the story of how to grapple with the work of art historian Jaromír Neumann. Dedicated to Škréta and serving as the primary catalogue for the 1974 monographic exhibition in Prague, this work dominated for several decades, signiﬁcantly inﬂuencing other authors. Recent research clearly shows that the topic of Karel Škréta can no longer rest upon the shoulders of a single author. A team of experts focusing on art historical, archival and general historical research has created a new body of work that includes the technical and technological research and restoration of dozens of works by Škréta and his contemporaries. It has yielded some major and often surprising information on the unparalleled character of 17th-century paintings and the personalities of those who commissioned them. Just as Škréta research is no longer the work of a single author, so too is it no longer about a single artist. Despite the importance of the artist and his unique artistic approach, we can no longer assess and interpret Škréta as a lone genius who arrived in a desert, gradually ﬁlling a cultural vacuum of alleged historical timelessness with his work. The recent research has shown it impossible to answer many questions about this „Bohemian Apelles“ without also examining the many names that ﬁlled Škréta’s horizon – not only his artistic contemporaries, but also his family, patrons, those who commissioned and collected his art and the colourful social spectrum which the painter navigated with admirable determination and, perhaps, a well-formulated career strategy. Not coincidentally, editions of archival sources form a major part of this book. To date, archival sources have represented the principal desideratum of Škréta research – all 20th-century art history work was based on 19th-century research. The current research most helpfully explored Škréta’s family background and personal connections. Of key importance in this respect is the testimony provided by newly found fragments of Škréta family correspondence in foreign archives, which, among other things, enabled a reconstruction of the itinerary of Škréta’s travels in Italy, apprentice years and wayfaring journeying abroad, all the more important as Škréta’s pre–1638 biography included many lacunae that called for hypothesis. The testimony of newly consulted sources of local provenance, such as meeting agendas of the Painters’ Brotherhood or (more importantly) official records referring to Škréta’s property disputes, ﬁnancial transactions and commissions was also key. It is the editor’s sad duty on behalf of the team of authors to dedicate this book to the memory of pre-eminent art historian, colleague and unforgettable friend Prof. PhDr. Mojmír Horyna. He was one of the most active members of the Škréta research team; his knowledge and experience proved invaluable. He duly submitted his study on the architecture of Škréta’s time on deadline and approached its ﬁrst proofreading with the same responsibility. None of us would have guessed he would not live to see his text published. His death in late January 2011, which aggrieved all of us so deeply, cut short a scientiﬁc career that had not yet reached its zenith. We present this work as a tribute to him.

Karel Škréta a jeho syn, Praha 2000, p. 6. Both this and a later work by the same author (idem, Karel Škréta 1610–1674, Praha 1974, pp. 7–13) offer an overview of more recent opinions on Škréta’s role in the history of both Baroque painting and 19th-century painting in Bohemia. 2 See for example: Willy Drost, Barockmalerei in den germanischen Ländern, Wildpark – Potsdam 1926 (Handbuch der Kunstwissenschaft), p. 280; Bruno Bushart, Deutsche Malerei des 17. und 18. Jahrhunderts, Königstein im Taunus 1967, pp. 16–17; Wolfgang J. Müller, Deutsche Malerei, in: Erich Hubala (ed.), Die Kunst des 17.

The author of numerous religious and mythological paintings as well as remarkable portraits, celebrated in Joachim von Sandrart’s Teutsche Academie with a biography and a graphic portrait [ﬁg. 1], Škréta is recognised as the ﬁrst purely Baroque Bohemian painter and the most important personality on the early Baroque art scene in Bohemia generally. In the words of the artist’s most recent monographer, Jaromír Neumann: “Škréta is the most signiﬁcant artistic personality to emerge in 17th-century Bohemia. […] He is the founder of the Bohemian Baroque and the early modern painting tradition, incorporating the best that the 17th century produced.”¹ However, Škréta’s unique place in the history of Baroque painting in Bohemia becomes somewhat less remarkable when we examine the work of the Prague master in the context of 17th-century Central European painting. Thus far, this issue has unfortunately received only occasional and superﬁcial treatment. Although Škréta’s work is generally mentioned in works analysing the history of painting in German-speaking countries,² and less commonly also in overviews of early modern art in Central Europe³ or in treatises on Baroque art in Austria,⁴ these treatments have been limited to a condensed\n\n1.

A more thorough comparison of Škréta’s work with that of his contemporaries clearly demonstrates that the character of his painting as well as his fortunes in life show common features with the lives and works of a number of other painters active during the 17th century in the individual Central European countries. Škréta was actually one of many artists born in the years 1600–1630 who spent the worst years of the Thirty Years’ War studying abroad and who began their professional careers only after military hostilities in Central Europe had subsided – and often in a completely new political, religious or cultural environment. I These artists gained their ﬁrst experience with the craft of painting in the traditional Central European artistic centres, often in the workshops of local masters. We know almost nothing about some of them – as in the case of the teachers of Tobias Pock (1609–1683) from Konstanz [ﬁg. 2] or even those of Škréta himself.⁵ Michael Willmann (1630–1706) from Königsberg and Johann Christoph Storer (1620–1671) from Konstanz learned the basics of painting in the guild workshops of their fathers,⁶ and Johann Heinrich Schönfeld (1609–1682/1683), born in Biberach, found his way to the workshop of Johann Sichelbein in the provincial town of Memmingen.⁷ Only a handful of young painters were more fortunate: for example, Johann von Spillenberger (1628–1679) went from his native Košice to the reputable workshop of Johann Ulrich Loth in Munich,⁸ and Joachim von Sandrart (1606–1688), a native of Frankfurt am Main who – attracted by the established reputation of the artistic centre associated with Rudolf II’s Imperial Court – set out to gain his ﬁrst artistic experience in the renowned workshop of Aegidius Sadeler in Prague.⁹ 18 THE SECOND APELLES ON THE EMPEROR’S PARNASSUS OF MUSES\n\n5 It can only be assumed that Škréta’s ﬁrst teacher of painting was Johann Georg Hering, active in Prague from 1615. It seems that the work of this artist resonates in some of Škréta’s late works, as Neumann suggests. See J.

For young painters, the recommended or even essential destination for advanced studies was naturally Italy. Karel van Mander formulated a general approach to obtaining a comprehensive education as a painter by drawing on the artistic achievements of the best Italian schools of painting. His advice was as follows: “From Rome bring some skill in drawing […], and the ability to paint from Venice.”¹⁰ Unfortunately, only a handful of central European painters managed to put this “golden rule” into practice. Škréta was among the chosen few as well, however. It is a well-known fact that he spent six years in Italy (1630–1635) – ﬁrst several years in Venice and later in Bologna and Florence where “he signiﬁcantly elevated his art in the local schools”, and ﬁnally from 1634 in Rome where he, “thanks to his diligence and industriousness, perfected his art to such a degree that he ﬁnally deemed his knowledge and abilities sufficient to return to his native Prague.”¹¹ Sandrart’s Italian tour of study had a similar itinerary. By studying the works of the local Venetian masters, he acquired a “laudable practice, especially in his inventiveness and use of colours”, but he relocated from Venice to Rome “to make further progress in the art of drawing.”¹² Schönfeld embarked on a journey to Italy at the age of 24 and spent 18 years there (1633–1651). He stayed in Rome and Naples where, by producing drawings after “ancient Roman as well as modern statues and paintings”, he perfected his abilities to such a degree that “these copies seem as though they had sprung from his own invention.”¹³ Egidius Schor (1627–1701) spent ten years in Rome (1656–1666) and even collaborated with the workshops of Gianlorenzo Bernini and Pietro da Cortona, participating in the artistic projects of these workshops.¹⁴ In this respect, he followed in the footsteps of his elder brother Johann Paul (1615–1674) who had established himself in Rome. Johann Ulrich Mayr (1630–1704) from Augsburg undertook an even longer journey in Italy following his previous education in the workshop of Rembrandt van Rijn in Amsterdam and a stay in England. As Sandrart noted, he expected to “achieve deﬁnitive perfection in his profession” during his stay. While in Italy, the painter from Augsburg “imbibed the strength of the beautiful blossoms growing in the local gardens of art, which, in the house of his reason and with the help of his unsurpassed diligence, he converted into the sweetest honey that could strengthen all the lovers of art in Germany.”¹⁵ A number of contemporary artists from Central Europe only reached the northern parts of Italy on their study trips. Venice naturally enjoyed the greatest popularity and transalpine artists settled there for longer periods of time. Among these were Johann Liss (1597–1630) and Johann Carl Loth (1632–1698), whose workshop later became a stopover for other German-speaking artists of the younger generation including Hans Adam Weissenkircher (1646–1695), Daniel Seiter (1647–1705) and Johann Michael Rottmayr (1656–1730). Spillenberger stayed in Venice for a relatively short period of time (c. 1660–1661), but – as Sandrart writes – he nonetheless managed to acquaint himself with a “good, fast painting technique” of which he later made use after returning to his home country in numerous works.¹⁶ The artists also visited other northern towns, undoubtedly of lesser artistic quality, such as Milan, where Storer appeared around year’s end 1639/1640. Not only did he complete his artistic education in Milan, he also opened his own painting workshop there, which operated until 1655 when Storer returned to his native Konstanz.¹⁷ The overwhelming majority of Central European painters, however, could only dream of the “blossoms” of the Italian “gardens of art”. This concerned in particular artists from the traditional guild centres as well as those from centres on the Baltic Sea; for them, an obligatory destination on their study trips was the Low Countries. As the itinerary of Silesian painter Johann Lichtenstein (1610 – after 1672) shows, for many Central European painters merely visiting the workshop of one of the great Netherlandish masters was in itself a considerable success.¹⁸ Nonetheless, many of them also set out for these artistic centres to study. The court painter of the Polish kings, Daniel Schultz (1615–1683), born in Danzig, is even mentioned among the students of Leyden University in 1643.¹⁹ Willmann also set out for Holland, arriving in Amsterdam around 1650, where he continued his education as an autodidact in the circle of the workshops of Rembrandt and Jacob Backer. For this painter from Königsberg, it was above all Italian art that embodied his artistic ideal. Information obtained by Sandrart that in Amsterdam the young painter “was forced to make STUDIES 19\n\nhis living and for this reason could not travel to Italy” attests to the artist’s resignation. Willmann was conscious of his insufficient artistic education for the rest of his life, and perhaps the best testimony of this fact is his letter of 22 May 1702 to Heinrich Snopek, abbot of the Cistercian monastery in Sedlec. In it, Willmann recommends his stepson Johann Christoph Liška (c. 1650–1712) to the abbot and praises the skills he acquired thanks to six years spent studying in Italy (c. 1671–1677) where – as the teacher admits with regret – his student “saw and learned” more than he himself had learned in Holland during his time there.²⁰ II In general, these artists’ return to Central Europe and the beginnings of their own professional careers were closely linked to the end of the Thirty Years’ War, or rather to the temporary cessation of military hostilities. The ﬁrst artists made their way back to Central Europe already after the Peace of Prague (1635), as was the case for Škréta in Prague (1638) and Pock in Vienna (1640). The others came only after the Peace of Westphalia (1648) or even later when the political and economic situation in the region was stabilising. Although in the Teutsche Academie Sandrart created a myth of an overall decline in the art of painting in the Germanic countries engulfed in the Thirty Years’ War,²¹ and portrayed Škréta alone as an exemplary “restorer” who managed to “elevate” the local art of painting from this decline and “wipe away the ﬁlth of its past” after his return to Prague thanks to his excellent works of art, returning Bohemian painting “to its former place and made it ﬂourish”,²² in reality none of the painters whose professional careers were developing at the time in Central Europe had to start from scratch.²³ Until the 1650s Škréta remained in the shadow of another Prague painter, Antonín Stevens of Steinfels (c. 1610 – c. 1675), who had created a number of altar paintings for churches in Prague already in the early 1640s, and it was most likely Stevens who was considered ﬁrst among Prague painters at the time.²⁴ Even in a region as devastated by the war as Silesia, there existed a centre of guild artists in Wrocław which was extremely expansive and watched its monopoly so closely²⁵ that, for example, Ezechiel Paritius (Sýkora) (1622–1671), a portrait artist from Litomyšl educated in Italy, had to try his luck elsewhere, ﬁnally succeeding in Brzeg as a court painter of the princes of Legnica-Brzeg (1654).²⁶ Willmann was later forced to establish himself at the Cistercian monastery in the provincial town of Lubiąż (1660).²⁷ There is no doubt that young painters educated in Italy or the Low Countries proliferated a style of painting in new, early Baroque forms in Central Europe. Whether these forms were inspired by a Dutch, Flemish or Italian source depended not only on where individual artists had been educated, but also on the preferences of their patrons. In Central Europe, however, the artistic level of the Dutch and Italian masters was achieved in an eclectic manner, whereby the heritage of these masters was treated as a store of readily applicable solutions. This was the result of a general awareness at the time of the high achievements of the new early modern art as well as of its pluralistic character with respect to the norms applied. Most artists resorted to models of Dutch origin which were most commonly spread through graphic printing. The best example of this approach is Franciszek Lekszycki (c. 1600–1668), a Franciscan monk and painter active in Cracow whose religious works are more or less truly rendered copper engravings, most commonly executed after the paintings of Peter Paul Rubens and his students.²⁸ Willmann may also be named in this context, as his early works reference predominantly Flemish graphic prints from the circle of Rubens, Anthony van Dyck and the Rembrandt-like “rough” painting manner.²⁹ On the other hand, Škréta – along with artists such as Schönfeld [ﬁg. 3], Pock, Schor and Spillenberger – belonged to a decidedly less numerous group of Central European artists who based their art primarily on Italian composition models and on a much more reﬁned “smooth” style of painting. Already Sandrart wrote with exaltation about the “natural feelings, well-composed ideas, correct painting technique, skilfully applied pigment-pastes and beautiful colouring” that “adorned” the Venetian paintings of the Bohemian master, also mentioning the immense acclaim with which the artist’s work was received by local art enthusiasts.³⁰ It is enough to mention that Škréta’s paintings from his Venetian period before 1656 were acquired for the collections of local painting 20 THE SECOND APELLES ON THE EMPEROR’S PARNASSUS OF MUSES\n\n20 For more on this issue see Andrzej Kozieł, Michael Willmann’s Way to “the Heights of Art” and His Early Drawings, Bulletin of The National Gallery in Prague 7–8, 1997–1998, pp. 54–66. 21 Andreas Tacke, “Der Kunst-Feind Mars”: die Auswirkungen des Krieges auf Kunst und Künstler nach Sandrarts “Teutscher Academie”, in: Klaus Bußmann – Heinz Schilling (edd.), 1648. Krieg und Frieden in Europa (exh. cat.), vol. 2: Kunst und Kultur, München 1998, pp. 245–252. Willmann’s letter to Sandrart of 12 December 1682 shows how deeply rooted this idea was. Here he expressed a thousand thanks for the fact that the “noble art of painting, almost ridiculed in many places in Germany or almost completely extinguished and fallen into darkness, could ﬂare up again thanks to this new light […]” – Andrzej Kozieł, Rysunki Michaela Willmanna (1630–1706), Wrocław 2000 (Acta Universitatis Wratislaviensis, vol. 2212, Historia Sztuki, vol. 14), p. 167. 22 J.

Only Škréta’s painting The Assumption of the Virgin Mary for the main altar of the Church of Our Lady before Týn in Prague (1649) brought about a change in this situation: this painting was successful and marked the beginning of the great career of this painter educated in Italy. 25 Piotr Oszczanowski, Między Waltherem a Willmannem.

Consequently, at least ten paintings of the “Bohemian Apelles” were acquired for the count’s collection in Prague.³¹ According to the ﬁndings of Jaromír Neumann, Škréta referred to the Italian art of the late Renaissance (the Carracci brothers, Tiziano, Veronese, Tintoretto, and Bassano, among others) and early Baroque (Guercino, Guido Reni, Tiberio, Tinelli, Bernardo Strozzi, Domenico Fetti, Giulio Carpioni, Simone Cantarini, and Orazio Borgiani, among others) continually throughout the later period of his artistic work.³² It is signiﬁcant, however, that this formal Italian allure in the Bohemian master’s painting dominated even when the author sporadically resorted to composition models of clearly transalpine origin, as in the case of the painting St Martin³³ and in the cycle of eleven Passion paintings in the St Nicholas Church in Prague’s Lesser Town.³⁴ From this perspective, the Italian style of the local artists is a distinctive feature of works created in the Habsburg Monarchy, as in the third quarter of the 17th century such a style of painting was only produced by several court painters of predominantly Italian origin such as Guido Cagnacci (1601–1663) and Pietro Liberi (1605–1687), who worked for the imperial court in Vienna,³⁵ and Filippo Abiatti (1640–1715) from Milan who was associated with the court of the Prince-Bishop of Olomouc\n\nSTUDIES 21\n\nKarl II of Lichtenstein-Kastelkorn.³⁶ Nevertheless, these Italians were only active in the Habsburg Monarchy for a limited period and their works had predominantly a cabinet character. The more italico painting style began to enjoy wider popularity only at the end of the 1670s.³⁷ Only when a number of signiﬁcant patrons with clearly Italian taste such as Prince Johann Adam of Liechtenstein, Prince Eugene of Savoy and Lothar Franz Schönborn in Vienna,³⁸ Archbishop of Prague Johann Friedrich of Waldstein, Bishop of Wrocław Cardinal Friedrich of Hessen-Darmstadt active in Wrocław and Nysa,³⁹ and priest and chancellor Sebastian Piskorski in Cracow⁴⁰ entered the scene was there increased demand for art that embraced the accomplished Roman Baroque and the painting of Pietro da Cortona and Carlo Maratta. In reaction to this, many journeying Italian painters came to Central Europe – the virtuosi who had mastered not only oil painting, but also the buon fresco technique (painting on wet plaster), and were often able to supply architectural designs as well. Alongside the Jesuit Andrea Pozzo (1642–1709), a whole group of painters from Bologna were active in Vienna;⁴¹ the fresco painter Carpoforo Tencalla from Bissone (1623–1685)⁴² was active in Austria, Upper Hungary, Bohemia and Moravia; Giacomo Scianzi (?– after 1702) was in the service of the Bishops of Wrocław in Wrocław and Nysa;⁴³ Paolo Pagani from Ticino (1655–1716) settled in Olomouc;⁴⁴ Innocenzo Monti (1653–1710) worked – like the workshop of Baldassare Fontana – in Moravia as well as in Cracow;⁴⁵ Michaelangelo Palloni (1637–1712) also worked on the territory of what are today Poland and Lithuania, as did Francesco Antonio Giorgioli (1655–1725), also from Ticino, who was active in Switzerland, Southern Germany and Saxony as well.⁴⁶ 22 THE SECOND APELLES ON THE EMPEROR’S PARNASSUS OF MUSES\n\n36 Milan Togner, Barokní malířství v Olomouci, Olomouc 2008, p. 39. 37 Hellmut Lorentz, Italien und die Anfänge des Hochbarock in Mitteleuropa, in: Max Seidel (ed.), Europa und die Kunst Italiens.

Among these artists were the following: Rottmayr, active in Austria, Bohemia, Moravia and Silesia;⁴⁷ Liška, working in Bohemia and Silesia;⁴⁸ Jerzy Eleuter Siemiginowski (c. 1660–1707/1711) in Poland;⁴⁹ and a supposed student of Škréta, the Augustinian monk Anton Martin Lublinsky (1636–1690) in Moravia.⁵⁰ The older generation of local artists, however, were forced to change their aesthetics. An example of this might be Willmann. who created several of his most Italian-like paintings after graphic print models from the circle of Cortona, Maratta and Pietro Testa around the end of the 1670s and the beginning of the 1680s, the style of which followed the Roman masters of the Italian Baroque [ﬁg. 4]. What is more, in response to the needs of local patrons, Willmann learned the demanding technique of painting on wet plaster, also unknown in the Low Countries.⁵¹ At that time, artists were primarily sought after who were acquainted with the Roman style of fresco, painting. From a letter to Lublinsky dated 29 March 1685 from the abbot of the Cistercian monastery in Lubiąż, Johannes Reich, we know that the abbot sought help ﬁnding a talented and resourceful painter, full of ideas, versed in oil painting as well as in fresco, and acquainted with the “Roman style”.⁵² On the other hand, in the case of oil painting – as the Prince of Liechtenstein wrote in a letter to Marcantonio Franceschini of Bologna⁵³ – works were requested in “buon gusto italiano con una morbidezza”, well-modelled female nudes full of grace and “vaghezza” – perfectly ﬁnished paintings with soft and smooth brushwork.\n\n24 THE SECOND APELLES ON THE EMPEROR’S PARNASSUS OF MUSES\n\n45 Jana Zapletalová, Mezi Boloňou a Krakovem: život a dílo italského malíře Innocenza Montiho (1653–1710), Umění LIII, 2005, pp. 335–346. 46 Mariusz Karpowicz, Działalność artystyczna Michaelangela Palloniego w Polsce, Warszawa 1967; Idem, Francesco Antonio Giorgioli a Varsovia, Bolletino della Svizzera Italiana 90, 1978, pp. 1–6. 47 Erich Hubala, Johann Michael Rottmayr, Wien 1981. 48 Jaromír Neumann, Jan Kryštof Liška, Umění XV, 1967, pp. 135–176, 260–311. 49 Mariusz Karpowicz, Jerzy Eleuter Siemiginowski, malarz polskiego baroku, Wrocław – Warszawa – Kraków – Gdańsk 1974. 50 The view commonly accepted in the literature that Lublinsky was educated exclusively in Škréta’s workshop as a “free” apprentice was recently challenged by Milan Togner, who traces the genesis of the art of this Moravian painter also in the works of Austrian and Southern German painters like Martin Theoﬁl Pollak (1570–1639) from Innsbruck, Matthias Kager (1575–1634) from Augsburg and Georg Bachmann (1613–1652). Togner even considers it possible that Lublinsky studied in Vienna and Augsburg before 1663.

H. Rivius, Der furnembsten notwendigsten der gantzen Architektur angehärigen mathematischen und mechanischen Künst eygentlicher Bericht und verstendliche Unterrichtung, Nürnberg 1547, Inv. No. AY XII 15). 58 Although the question of Škréta’s motivation for converting to Catholicism in Italy has been the subject of scholarly discussion, (see J. Neumann, Škrétové, see note 1, p. 41), it is nonetheless beyond any doubt that under the Renewed Constitution of 1627 the painter could return from emigration only as a Catholic. He could also request the return of his family property only as such. See Lenka Stolárová – Radka Tibitanzlová – Vít Vlnas, Karel Škréta in Prague or The Story of Two Beginnings, pp. 53–71 in this book. 59 See ibid. 60 S. Appuhn-Radtke, Visuelle Medien (see note 6), pp. 112–152.\n\nIII The works of most Central European painters who started their professional careers after the end of the Thirty Years’ War show great versatility and encompass almost all genres of painting. Both Škréta and Sandrart distinguished themselves as excellent portraitists [ﬁg. 5].⁵⁴ Schönfeld and Spillenberger focused on mythological paintings which were commissioned enthusiastically for private art collections [ﬁg. 6].⁵⁵ Willmann’s works, on the other hand, entered him into the history of 17th-century German landscape painting for all time [ﬁg. 7].⁵⁶ The major source of income for these artists, however, was the production of religious paintings, above all altar paintings commissioned practically en masse by various patrons from the Catholic Church. For certain artists, the opportunity to beneﬁt from these commissions entailed the necessity to accommodate their customers’ expectations, in some cases even by converting to Catholicism. While Sandrart as an artist of the Calvinist confession established in liberal Franconia could work for Catholic customers, for artists active in the Habsburg Monarchy this was unacceptable. Both Willmann and Škréta submitted to this: the former had to convert from Calvinism to Catholicism after three years in Lubiąż (1663),⁵⁷ while the latter had to accept the Catholic faith in order to be able to return to his native Prague.⁵⁸ Almost all of the more signiﬁcant painters were tied through various contacts to their Catholic patrons, who became the major supporters and promoters of their work. It is a well-known fact that the cooperation with the Augustinian monastery at Zderaz in Prague played a signiﬁcant role at the beginning of Karel Škréta’s artistic career after his return to Bohemia.⁵⁹ Storer, after returning to Konstanz in 1655, became the main painter of the Upper German province of the Jesuit Order and devoted almost all of his artistic production to commissions from the Jesuits [ﬁg. 8].⁶⁰ Willmann’s case was not any different; STUDIES 25\n\n11. ↑ Karel Škréta, The Descent of the Holy Ghost, 1668–1669, Salzburg Cathedral (photo: Grzegorz Zajączkowski) 12. ↗ Karel Škréta, Cruciﬁxion with the Virgin Mary, St John the Evangelist and St Mary Magdalene, 1668–1669, Salzburg Cathedral (photo: Grzegorz Zajączkowski)\n\n26 THE SECOND APELLES ON THE EMPEROR’S PARNASSUS OF MUSES\n\n61 Rüdiger Grimkowski, Willmann i cystersi, in: M.

The fact that Škréta was selected for this prestigious commission may have been inﬂuenced by Archbishop Guidobald Thun’s descent from the Bohemian branch of the family, and so he was most probably aware of this Bohemian painter’s standing on the art scene in Prague.\n\nsince establishing himself at the monastery in Lubiąż (1660), he connected all of his subsequent work with the Cistercians not only in Silesia, but also in Bohemia and Moravia.⁶¹ For Pock, a native of Konstanz, cooperation with Viennese Archbishop Philipp Friedrich of Breuner played a key role at the beginning of his career.⁶² Even Sandrart, an artist of different merit, created a signiﬁcant portion of his works for customers from the Catholic Church and in the years 1655/56–1661 worked almost exclusively for the Benedictine abbey in Lambach.⁶³ Paradoxically, it was the Calvinist, Sandrart, established in Stockau by Nuremberg, who became the largest supplier of altar paintings for Catholic customers in almost all of Central Europe: from Würzburg, Eichstatt, Regensburg, Landshut, Freising and Munich, to Lambach, Salzburg, Linz, Garsten and Waldhausen, to Chrudim [ﬁg. 9], Brno and Vienna.⁶⁴ Other Central European artists followed his example: Storer supplied his altar paintings to commissioners from Jesuit circles in an area from Switzerland and Schwarzwald to Franconia, Bavaria and Upper Austria;⁶⁵ Pock worked not only for customers from across Austria, but also from Moravia;⁶⁶ Schönfeld did not restrict himself to Swabia, but sent his works to Bavaria and Austria as well;⁶⁷ and Willmann’s altar paintings spread fast on the art market in Silesia as well as in Bohemia, Moravia, and even Austria (Sankt Florian).⁶⁸ In this context, Škréta appears to be an artist who managed to gain control only of the local market: aside from two paintings for the side chapels of the cathedral in Salzburg which will be addressed in greater detail below, an altar painting for the holy shrine in Neukirchen am Hl. Blut⁶⁹ in the Bavarian borderlands, and a missing painting for the main altar of the Jesuit church in Telč, Moravia,⁷⁰ all of Škréta’s paintings for church commissioners were destined exclusively for locations in Bohemia. This decided predominance of altar paintings in period artistic production caused some of the churches to be conceived as picture galleries of a kind, amassing the works of the best contemporary Central European artists. The church of the Benedictine monastery in Lambach became a sort of exposition of the “splendid work” of Sandrart, who executed seven paintings ordered by the abbot Placidus Hieber: the monumental Assumption of the Virgin Mary for the main altar and six other canvases depicting individual saints for the side altars. Displaying these works in the church caused “[…] the paths not only of art-loving youth, but also of Emperors, Cardinals, Archdukes and other persons of high and low station to lead to see these works of art […]”⁷¹ in a previously little-known place. Another example is the Cistercian monastery church in Lubiąż [ﬁg. 10], for the interior of which Willmann and his workshop created at least 60 canvases of various types. Until 1943 this set was undoubtedly the largest Central European collection of Baroque paintings created for one church and by one artist with the help of his workshop assistants.⁷² Although Škréta could not boast a similar temple decorated exclusively with his works,⁷³ his greatest achievements – also described as such in his biography published in the Teutsche Academie – are the paintings he created for a number of Bohemian churches. These churches are: the St Nicholas, St Thomas and St Wenceslas Cathedrals in Prague’s Lesser Town; the St Stephen and St Martin “in the wall” Churches in Prague’s New Town; the Jesuit monastery in Prague; the Cistercian monasteries in Zbraslav and Plasy; the Episcopal church in Litoměřice and the Church of St Wenceslas in Mělník.⁷⁴ On the other hand, the two paintings Škréta produced for the cathedral in Salzburg and which are not mentioned in the Teutsche Academie attest to the fact that the Prague master was often invited to participate in prestigious projects signiﬁcant for the entire Central European region. Škréta’s two large-format paintings with the motifs of The Descent of the Holy Ghost [ﬁg. 11] and Cruciﬁxion with the Virgin Mary, St John the Evangelist and St Mary Magdalene [ﬁg. 12] were created in the years 1668–1669 as part of the multi-year project to create painted decorations for the interior of the cathedral in Salzburg. As this work progressed, the paintings’ donors – local Archbishops Guidobald Thun and Max Gandolph Kuenburg – selected the individual artists approached for this project, probably based on the artists’ standing on the Central European art scene.⁷⁵ Alongside Škréta, whose canvases were intended for the altars of two side chapels on the eastern side of the cathedral, the most renowned period painters from all of Central Europe worked for the cathedral in Salzburg. Schönfeld created the altar canvas St Sebastian and St Roch in approximately 1654–1655, and several years later (1669) he created another altar painting with the ﬁgures of selected saints, namely St Gregory, St Jerome, St Nicholas and St Martin [ﬁg. 13] as well as a missing canvas featuring the motif of STUDIES 27\n\nSt Vincent with St Florian, St Oswald, St Erasmus and St Cecilia (c. 1669). In 1656 Sandrart supplied the missing painting The Baptism of Christ and also a painting for the altar of St Anne, while Frans de Neve (1606–1681), originally from Antwerp but educated in Rome, created the altar painting St Virgil’s Ordination as Bishop (currently housed at the Cathedral Museum in Salzburg) in 1672 and painted the canvas The Baptism of Christ, which replaced Sandrart’s painting with the same theme two years later. IV Prestigious commissions of this type no doubt attested to the individual painters’ standing on the Central European art scene. “What could be better than the life of a famous painter?” asked Samuel van Hoogstraten – who had spent ﬁve years of his life in Vienna (1651–1655).⁷⁶ Becoming famous along with wealth and satisfaction with one’s own abilities was considered by all contemporary European art theoreticians to be the basic objective of a painter’s artistic activity. In this respect, Sandrart was an unrivalled model for all Central European artists, as this “prince of German painters” who, through the practice of the beaux arts, not only became a rich man and the proprietor of an estate in Stockau where he entertained the powerful men of the contemporary world, but was ultimately ennobled by the Emperor in 1653. Even then it was universally acknowledged that not wealth and noble titles, but the printed word was the guarantee of an artist’s “immortal” celebrity. For this reason, all of Sandrart’s most signiﬁcant artistic achievements were eternalised in his voluminous biography,⁷⁷ which was undoubtedly composed by his friend, Nuremberg poet Sigmund of Birken, and which was incorporated into the ﬁrst tome of the Teutsche Academie. Even today it is hard to overestimate the signiﬁcance of this work: it is the ﬁrst German-language publication with a richly illustrated and comprehensive interpretation of the contemporary theory of painting, graphic art, carving and architecture, based on the unifying idea of the arte del disegno. Sandrart’s work – published in a lavish format and excellent edition design, and with numerous copper engravings representing the most signiﬁcant works of classic art created by the best contemporary graphic artists – clearly surpassed the usual level of this kind of publication at the time. When additionally accompanied by a translation of Ovid’s Metamorphoses and Cartari’s treatise Imagines Deorum, the work was priceless as a source of indispensable knowledge for the artistic practice of a painter. Most importantly, the Teutsche Academie contained extensive paragraphs on the history of art in general as well as on individual important masters, and presented not only information on the painters of antiquity and old Italian and Dutch masters compiled from the works of Giorgio Vasari, Carlo Ridolﬁ and Karel van Mander, but also included biographical sketches of Sandrart’s contemporaries together with signiﬁcant authors who had been active on German territory in the past, which the author compiled himself. Van Hoogstraten wrote: “It is true that an artist must seek good fortune ﬁrst through his own merits, which is to say, through the merit and appeal of his own work […] for without the help of generous supporters and heralds loudly singing his praises, it will be difficult for him to become well known.”⁷⁸ There is no doubt that for many a Central European artist the Teutsche Academie became the most important of these “heralds loudly singing his praises”. It gave these often little-known artists working far from the artistic centres an opportunity to have their biographies and portraits published alongside the biographies and portraits of “all famous artists” of ancient as well as contemporary times, which was equivalent to achieving the highest recognition, celebrity and also a certain artistic ennoblement. It should not surprise us, therefore, that certain German artists earnestly solicited their inclusion in this prestigious enterprise. An example of this is Willmann, who had been neglected in the ﬁrst edition of the Teutsche Academie and who in 1682, having learned that work on its translation into Latin had commenced, congratulated Sandrart in a letter written in an uncommonly ﬂattering and humble tone, and included a skilfully executed drawing depicting the scene of Joachim von Sandrart’s Apotheosis [ﬁg. 14]. The following year a biography of the Silesian painter and his graphic likeness appeared in the work Academia nobilissimae Artis Pictoriae (1683).⁷⁹ Škréta’s biography and his graphic portrait were included already in the ﬁrst German edition of the Teutsche Academie, immediately following the biography of the famous Rembrandt and right next to his portrait.⁸⁰ While Sandrart devoted only brief notes to other 28 THE SECOND APELLES ON THE EMPEROR’S PARNASSUS OF MUSES\n\n76 Samuel van Hoogstraten, Inleyding tot de Hooge Schoole der Schilderkunst, Rotterdam 1678, p. 345.

Sandrart explains that if he wanted to describe all of Škréta’s beautiful works, he would have to signiﬁcantly extend the scope of his humble work; Sandrart also praises the artist himself as not only “a versatile theoretician”, but also “an experienced practitioner” who is always able to follow nature as much as possible. The author of the Teutsche Academie states that, thanks to these universally admired skills, the Bohemian painter attained great fame and fully deserved the honourable appellation “the second Apelles on the Emperor’s Parnassus of Muses”.⁸¹ This enthusiastic appraisal of Škréta was published barely one year after his death (1674), which Sandrart also mentions in the painter’s biography with deep grief, although he does not quote the artist’s age correctly. Moreover, this ﬁrst Central European history of art considered Škréta to be Sandrart’s only contemporary from the Lands of the Bohemian Crown, if we discount the merely passing mention of Johann Georg Hering.⁸² Although some researchers are inclined to state that Sandrart’s appraisal of Škréta is too obsequious,⁸³ it does not seem that these doubts are justiﬁed. Based on our general knowledge of the Bohemian master’s standing in 17th-century Central European painting, we may conclude that the excited tone of his biography published in the Teutsche Academie largely stems from the fact that Škréta’s work and fortunes were typical of an entire generation of Central European artists. It is true that, compared to other important contemporary Central European artists, his work was of a rather local importance and that, except for the altar paintings for the cathedral in Salzburg, Škréta did not achieve any other greater success on the European stage. As an artist in Prague, he never attained a higher social status than that of the master of the Old Town painters’ guild and his most signiﬁcant patrons were local representatives of the Catholic Church, such as the abbots of Bohemian monasteries and members of the diocese clergy. In general, Škréta’s pupils known from various sources were second-rate painters of rather minor signiﬁcance. Nonetheless, Škréta’s overwhelming artistic and intellectual potential⁸⁴ decidedly transcended the borders of the local artistic centre. Sandrart, who had made Škréta’s personal acquaintance in Italy,⁸⁵ was aware of this and thus neither hesitated to include Škréta’s biography in the Teutsche Academie nor to use the ecstatic appellation “the second Apelles”. Although after returning to Prague Škréta worked for the rest of his life only as the master of the Old Town painters’ guild, no other contemporary painter active in the Habsburg Monarchy at the time could boast the excellent education he had received in Italy in his youth. Despite the fact that he was never invited to work for one of the Central European courts and never received the honourable title of court painter as did his Prague competitor, Anton Stevens,⁸⁶ he consistently employed the sophisticated “courtly” painting manner of the Italian style in his painting, which was admired by art enthusiasts in Prague and beyond. Until the mid–17th century the ﬁrst painter from Prague was the above-mentioned Stevens, and yet it was Škréta with his Italian education whom Sandrart called the “restorer” of painting in the capital of the Bohemian Kingdom devastated by the Thirty Years’ War. In comparison to other progenitors of Baroque painting in Central Europe, he clearly preferred the Prague master. The rhetoric of “restoration” never appeared in the short biography of Pock, nor in the extensive biography of Schönfeld, let alone in the account of Willmann’s life published in the Latin edition of the Teutsche Academie. On Sandrart’s view, the “heroic” biography of Karel Škréta, whose career began in 1638 in a city once known for its splendid painting tradition at Rudolf II’s Imperial Court and which had been brutally disrupted by the outbreak of the Thirty Years’ War, had grown into a distinctive example of a painter’s attempts to revive art in Germany and renew its prestige in a place where it had only recently celebrated its triumphs. Škréta, then, was a model representative of the “new” painting which recalled the classical-style Italian models and relied on the principles of “true art”, within which painting is considered one of the arti del disegno. ***\n\n30 THE SECOND APELLES ON THE EMPEROR’S PARNASSUS OF MUSES\n\nJ.

A range of opinions has been voiced in response: from the simplistic concept of progressive stages in art (with a movement towards perfection followed by a decline), inﬂuenced by contemporary social and economic developments and the interpretation of a work of art as the expression of a universal spirit of the given era, to viewing art history as an immanent process underlying the development of art forms, which occurs independently of other concurrent events. This methodical problem can also be tracked throughout the interpretations of Karel Škréta’s oeuvre against the background of the phenomenon of Baroque in Bohemia or Bohemian Baroque. There is hardly any synthesis of 17th- and 18th-century Bohemian art which would fail to describe the defeat of the Estates in the 1620 Battle of White Mountain as the essential milestone between Renaissance and Baroque. This is, however, not a matter of mere periodisation of art: relating Baroque to the White Mountain seems to be perceived as a constructive point of departure in asking questions about the very origin and essence of art. Czech art history long departed from the idea that Baroque – the originally heterogeneous cultural element – was imported to Bohemia forcibly and concurrently with the post-White Mountain re-Catholicisation, the loss of state independence, and national oppression. And although Baroque indeed disrupted the artistic development, it soon became “naturalized” in the country and eventually transformed into the distinctive, unique Bohemian Baroque. This inﬂuential concept came from the art historian Jaromín Neumann, who coincidentally was also the most signiﬁcant 20th-century interpreter of Karel Škréta’s work. The model of interpretation outlined by Neumann ruled the official course of interpreting Bohemian Baroque for most of the 20th century. But if we today consider the increasing knowledge of the diversity of art originating on our territory and at the same time try to pass unbiased judgment on modern Czech history, this explanation seems hardly sustainable. Very inspiring in this respect is Thomas DaCosta Kaufmann analysing the false myth about the decline of Central European art during the Thirty Years’ War.² His study points out that Prague, to the contrary – and in spite of the permanent belligerency –, witnessed extraordinary investments in art during that period. The picture of the ravaged Bohemia from where “Mars ousted the peace-loving Muses and arts”,³ as the German painter Joachim von Sandrart (1606–1688) put it in his biography of Karel Škréta which forms part of the Teutsche Academie (1675), was largely ﬁctitious. The alleged penurious artistic conditions in Prague prior to Škréta’s arrival as portrayed by Sandrart can be, STUDIES 33\n\nafter all, well compared to his no less suggestive picture of a devastated Germany in the foreword to the book.⁴ It is at the same time rather paradoxical that the authors of the mythical artistic decline during the Thirty Years’ War were artists active in the latter half of the 17th century. And not only that this myth heavily burdened modern art-historical research; these artists thus developed their self-stereotype as revivers and re-enactors of the “noble art of painting” in Central Europe during the post-war era. As to the issue of early Baroque painting in Bohemia and deﬁning Karel Škréta’s place in its development, it can be said that there were two simultaneous viewpoints playing their part in the local art history. The ﬁrst one was the formalist or, stylistic approach whose main aim was to examine the Prague painting style during the Thirty Years’ War as highly different from the preceding court art of Rudolf II and to assess Karel Škréta’s contribution to it. The second, speculative interpretation of the humanities traditionally linked the arrival of Baroque forms in Bohemia with the coining of a new spiritual and cultural tendency that came with the Counter-Reformation. *** The ﬁrst local author who attempted to capture the character of Prague painting of the latter third of the 17th century was Franz Lothar Ehemant (1779), professor of history at Prague University.⁵ Not surprisingly, he departed from Sandrart’s interpretation of Central-European art history during the Thirty Years’ War. Ehemant presents the era of the Rudolﬁne court art as the golden age which was too suddenly aborted by the emperor’s death and the ensuing unrests, while the Thirty Years’ War is nothing but a period of artistic stagnation to him. In this context, he notes the robberies of art collections during the Saxon and Swedish occupations of Prague. The author moreover opines that new developments were brought to Bohemia only as late as during the second half of the 17th century by artists arriving from abroad – and even though local artists participated, too, most of them were leaving for Italy for training. As to Škréta, Ehemant merely utters that the painter was capable of imitating the styles “of very many great masters”.⁶ He in part casts the gloomy image of art during the Thirty Years’ War onto his present time, viewing the period under the reign of Empress Maria Theresa as an analogous case: as an era 34 BAROQUE IN BOHEMIA VERSUS BOHEMIAN BAROQUE\n\n4 J.

The introductory essay to his Allgemeines historisches Künstler-Lexikon (1815) describes the dismal conditions in arts in Bohemia or, respectively, Prague, and concurrently claims that the subsequent revival was due to the artists either coming or returning from other countries. Dlabacž’s leading personality among them was Karel Škréta who had just come back from Italy. The author in fact totally neglects the activity of artists who never left Prague, and exclusively perceives the local artistic development from the viewpoint of the exiles, Karel Škréta, Wenceslaus Hollar and Georg Flegel.⁸ The latter half of the 19th century witnessed the arrival of art history as an autonomous discipline, and national viewpoints were naturally coming into play. The art of early Baroque as well as Škréta himself thus received very contradictory responses at that time. No matter the authenticity of Škréta’s Bohemian origin and the success the artist eventually enjoyed in Prague – he had simply trained in Italy and became established in Bohemia as a representative of a rather foreign style. It is worth attention that the late 18th-century Jan Quirin Jahn did not hesitate to prove the “Italian” character of Škréta’s oeuvre by genetics: Škréta reportedly was the son of Italian parents settled in Prague (!).⁹ Would not Karel Škréta’s return to his homeland, then, represent importing foreign art instead of resurrecting local painting tradition, as Sandrart’s Teutsche Academie claims? The same objection clearly resounds in the relevant part of the entry History of Fine Arts in Bohemia [Dějiny výtvarných umění v Čechách], contained in Rieger’s Encyclopaedia [Slovník naučný; 1862] and written by Karel Vladislav Zap. The author judges the artistic production at the court of Rudolf II through the prism of the Romanticist approach of national art schools, and also opines that Rudolﬁne art had only little chance of inﬂuencing art in Bohemia due to its foreign origin. Its development was moreover forcibly interrupted by the Battle of White Mountain. 17th-century painting, viewed through the criterion of originality, was thus nothing but a foreign, mainly Italian import and – with the rare exception of Karel Škréta – it complied with the depraved taste of that period. But even Škréta’s main asset in this view was merely his “deftness” in imitating Italian models.¹⁰ STUDIES 35\n\nThe viability of Sandrart’s image of a desolated early 17th-century Central Europe deprived of all art is rather eloquently proved by the interesting treatise on Škréta by Karel Purkyně (1864). Its introduction paraphrases Teutsche Akademie almost word for word with, however, several “patriotic” connotations: “The silence of despair over the graves of our most thriving favourite sons reigned in Bohemia and Germany where the bloodthirsty god of war in the company of all his horrors had trampled every green corn underfoot. There was no fresh air for an artist who would only vainly search for the Muses of his art, for those had long taken refuge from the war pandemonium. There where one encountered the traces of shattered houses, splintered sculptures and destroyed paintings at every step and where the only image he faced always and everywhere, the image of destroyed properties and the misery of thousands of families, there was no motivation for an artist! Who would ever think there of creating something new – of painting!”¹¹ Purkyně – the ﬁrst and, for a long time, also the last interpreter of Škréta – pondered on the character of the artist’s Italian lesson. He provides an informed, but still simpliﬁed description of the ﬁght between the “academics” and the “naturalists”, at the same time claiming that “both parts departed from 36 BAROQUE IN BOHEMIA VERSUS BOHEMIAN BAROQUE\n\n11 Karel Purkyně, Karel Skreta.

V. Zap was not isolated in denouncing early Baroque painting. A nationalist tinge also resounds in the description of conditions ruling 17th-century Bohemian art as provided by Antonín Rybička Skutečský in one of the ﬁrst heuristically-based biographic treatises on Karel Škréta (1869).¹⁴ Rybička opines that the thriving local art was totally ruined during the Thirty Years’ War and the subsequent works, however successful, cannot be perceived as “authentic and autochthonous Bohemian achievements but solely cogent imitations of the Italian, STUDIES 37\n\n7. Paul Bergner, inspector of the Picture Gallery of the Society of Patriotic Friends of the Arts and organizer of Karel Škréta’s exhibition, held in the Rudolﬁnum Gallery in 1910, Archives of the National Gallery in Prague (photo: anonymous author, c. 1911)\n\nFlemish and French ones, accommodated in brush, chisel or compasses of the masters in Bohemia”.¹⁵ Even Karel Škréta, on whose life and oeuvre Rybička strenuously collected valuable information, did not escape his criticism. We read that he, too, remained the mere imitator of “Italian academics and eclecticists” and nothing but his dexterous skills of imitating distinguished him from his Bohemian coevals.¹⁶ The author claims that Škréta failed to resuscitate the alleged old Bohemian national school whose last heirs either died out or “roamed through foreign lands in search of a modest living and shelter”.¹⁷ The latter quote proves how deeply enrooted the maudlin stereotype of the “exiles”, originally adopted from Czech literature – and rhetoric in general –, was in the contemporary ruminations on Czech ﬁne arts. The Czech-German historian Gustav Edmund Pazaurek then drew yet another picture of Karel Škréta, departing from Sandrart as well as the earlier Czech literature (no matter how critical he was towards the latter). Pazaurek’s signiﬁcant monograph on Škréta (1889) greatly contributes studies of the artist from the point of heuristics and it scrupulously follows all methodical principles of positivist art history. It, nevertheless, does not sufficiently reﬂect either on the myth of the overall devastation caused by the Thirty Years’ War, nor on the descriptions of Škréta as eclectic. It is worth attention that unlike the authors before him, Pazaurek interprets Škréta’s “imitative” inclinations as proof of his poor talent instead of his artistic deftness. His polemical remarks also further sharpen the controversies in viewing Škréta as a superﬁcial, albeit fashionable and successful artist. This standpoint was certainly the fruit of the contemporary Czech-German disputes as to the cultural contribution of the respective ethnicities. In this respect, Pazaurek’s characteristic is crucial: “Wie einst Platon den Göttern täglich für dreierlei dankte, hätte auch Screta Ursache gehabt dem Himmel für dreierlei zu danken: dass er ein ﬂinker Maler war, das er diesseits der Alpen arbeitete, somit die italienische Concurrenz weniger zu fürchten hatte, und ferner, dass er 38 BAROQUE IN BOHEMIA VERSUS BOHEMIAN BAROQUE\n\n15 Ibid., p. 43. 16 Ibid., p. 51. 17 Ibid., p. 43.\n\n18 Gustav Edmund Pazaurek, Carl Screta (1610–1674).

It seems that even the pragmatic Karel Chytil – a Czech scholar who otherwise never dared to fall for nationalist stereotypes – was rather puzzled in dealing with the phenomenon of Škréta. The excerpt from his interpretation summarizing the life and work of the artist and published in the Otto Encyclopaedia [Ottův slovník naučný; 1863] proves that he defended the painter from Pazaurek solely by enumerating the array of the long established deﬁnitions: “The Thirty Years’ War and the radical changeover in Bohemian affairs indeed totally paralysed all local artistic developments […]. Karel Škréta […] returned to Bohemia and launched a new stage of Bohemian painting here. Škréta, in his numerous altarpiece paintings, adheres to the Italian academics or eclectics and his oeuvre in this sense ranks as the best achievements created outside Italy.”²⁰ Similarly, Karel Boromejský Mádl views Škréta as an artist of merely average talent whose main asset was introducing the advanced Italian patterns to Central-Bohemia – and, moreover, diminishing the relics of Rudolﬁne Mannerism: “Škréta’s art from both the aspect of form and mentality must be generally judged against the background of the tendencies and conditions of Italian art during the period of his youth; the art which was left behind to weaker forces by the Bologna academics and the Roman naturalists. It copes with what the artistic grandsons of the Carraccis and Caravaggios accomplished. However adapted, second- or even third-hand art displaying only minor signs of authentic artistic personality, it is still signiﬁcant to Bohemia in a certain groundbreaking sense. It eradicated Mannerism and Romanticism and introduced us to a higher sense of colourful picturesqueness and animated form.”²¹ A completely different standpoint was taken by Karel Vladimír Herain (1915), the ﬁrst scholar to provide a synthesis on modern Bohemian painting. His work focuses on the period between the ascendance of Rudolf II to the throne (1573) and the death of the painter Václav Vavřinec Reiner (1743).²² The subtitle of the book – Contributions to the History of Its Internal Development between 1576 and 1742 [Příspěvky k dějinám jeho vnitřního vývoje v letech 1576–1743] – suggests that Herain’s main program in this instance was to show that the development of Bohemian painting in the given era was smooth, obeying nothing but the intrinsic laws of art, and was thus clearly beyond contemporary historical events. Herain was moreover the ﬁrst to acknowledge that Rudolﬁne art was essential to the progress of local painting production. He claims that it was largely due to the Italian-oriented, protoBaroque oeuvres of Hans von Aachen and Bartholomäus Spranger why Prague came to witness the “very distinct and supreme artistic outcomes of this style which had hitherto only been perceived as imported to our environment by the Counter-Reformation” in the early 17th century.²³ Herain is also ahead in observing “the inﬂuence of Bolognese eclecticism and also perhaps Caravaggio’s naturalism” in the work of the two above-mentioned Rudolﬁne masters – i.e., the stylistic aspects whose general features were otherwise linked with the much later inﬂuence of Škréta.²⁴ Political developments from between 1618 and 1620 thus did not represent any substantial turning point for the development of painting in Bohemia – just because “the changes which it succumbed to were of earlier date and inevitable” and their unfortunate consequences (in no way denied by Herain) were to surface only on a long-term basis.²⁵ The arriving re-Catholicisation then prompted local painting towards Baroque even more. This was not just due to the intensiﬁed inﬂux of yet another topical Italian inspiration but also due to the new artistic tasks required by the Church and the aristocracy. And the artist ﬂexible enough and ready to meet these requirements was exactly Karel Škréta, “who was later destined to attract so much attention and popularity that no other contemporary painter could equal him in this”.²⁶ Herain argued against Pazaurek even earlier, in connection with his 1910 retrospect held in the Prague Rudolﬁnum Gallery: “Škréta was a magniﬁcent talent of the arts. Italy had ﬁred the great artist in him and it also naturally gave him the means of expression. We will not use an empty cliché to value his signiﬁcance; let us just say that he is the ﬁrst master of Baroque in our lands. The Baroque style then became established here and bore beautiful fruit in both painting and architecture.”²⁷ K. V. Herain, however, remained isolated not only in his view of the beginnings of Baroque painting in Bohemia but also in the overall issue of Baroque. Czech art history during the inter-war period had only little understanding for such an ultimately formalist approach, assuming that a much more urgent imperative was to discover the social role in Baroque and ﬁnd it a higher ideological sense in the framework of Czech or, respectively, STUDIES 39\n\n8. ← Picture Gallery of the Society of Patriotic Friends of the Arts in the Rudolﬁnum Gallery, installation of Bohemian Baroque painting, Archives of the National Gallery in Prague (photo: Jan Štenc, c. 1919) 9. → Installation of works by Karel Škréta in the Picture Gallery of the Society of Patriotic Friends of the Arts in the Municipal Library in Prague.

The almanac Czechoslovak Art [Československé umění; 1926], co-written by Vojtěch Birnbaum, Antonín Matějček, Josef Schránil and Zdeněk Wirth, reads that “ﬁne arts have been, nonetheless, the least affected by the consequences of the loss of national sovereignty because Bohemian Renaissance was nothing but a projection of Italian culture to the North and because the new political and religious tendencies supported the developments in art through the immigration of potent forces from Italy and Germany”. The Rudolﬁne court art thus merely represented an exclusive import, the Thirty Years’ War stood for a cultural caesura and neither was early Baroque able to produce any upswing in arts because it, too, progressed in a solely mechanical way of adopting ﬁxed stylistic forms: “Early Baroque in Czechoslovakia – like Renaissance – nevertheless remained a provincial art in its quality, for it stemmed from the same sources and succumbed to the same deformation of exact stylistic form.”²⁸ Oldřich Stefan then polemically followed with the historically moralizing line of the famous essay by Arne Novák, entitled Baroque Prague [Praha barokní],²⁹ arguing in the treatise The Background of Prague Baroque [Pozadí pražského baroku; 1932] that, “As if we were somewhat incidentally beginning to realize that the art form is not the only content of our Baroque; that we are actually talking about the stylistic expression [sic!] of the entire 150 years of our, very important, national history: from the White Mountain to the 1770s. But we keep evading this, as if it was something that we are unsure of, that we perhaps almost fear. The reason is the helplessness which remains the characteristic feature of our relation to the historical role of this period in general.”³⁰ The helplessness is speciﬁed somewhat later in the essay. Stefan explains that the arts paradoxically developed “in the very period which we can hardly call a happy and favourable era of our history due to national, religious and economic reasons”. He perceives the arrival of Baroque in Bohemia as the result of the fateful clash of two different cultures, “the conﬂict between the Romance and Catholic South and the German and Protestant Western tendency; the conﬂict which lasted in Bohemia for the entire 16th century”.³¹ The Battle of White Mountain then caused that these two contradictory tendencies could not naturally equipoise. Baroque as an artistic opinion was forcibly imposed on the Czech population by the victorious party and “it can be said that it made its way and became widespread among common people only during the 1690s or, perhaps, even later, and only then did it begin to express their thinking. But before that, it was solely a foreign import for the upper classes”.³² Václav Vilém Štech then offered another pointed conception of the genesis of Baroque in Bohemia (1938). He was probably inspired by Max Dvořák’s theory about the contradictory worlds of ideas of Renaissance and Baroque arts, as well as by the view of Werner Weisbach from the 1920s about the “Counter-Reformation” essence of Baroque style.³³ Štech 40 BAROQUE IN BOHEMIA VERSUS BOHEMIAN BAROQUE\n\n28 Vojtěch Birnbaum – Antonín Matějček – Josef Schránil – Zdeněk Wirth, Československé umění, Praha 1926, p. 16. 29 Arne Novák, Praha barokní, Praha 1915. 30 Oldřich Stefan, Pozadí pražského baroku, in: Artuš Rektorys (ed.), Kniha o Praze (Pražský almanach) 3, 1932, pp. 54–69, here p. 55. 31 Ibid., p. 58.

To him, the preconditions for adopting Baroque were provided by the newly organized Catholicism which “began long before the White Mountain”.³⁴ He once again expressed on the stylistic character of post-White Mountain Baroque painting in the exhibition catalogue Prague Baroque [Pražské baroko; 1938]. The White Mountain and all its consequences brought a radical turning point; with it, “the natural development of art was halted for a long time. Creativity sunk from elegant internationality to modest provinciality. Also the stylistic advantage was lost, as the local artists kept lingering on forms based on the Renaissance opinion. The active belligerence of the victorious Counter-Reformation began entering the forms only little by little”.³⁵ The ﬁrst one to attempt a constructive approach to the relation between early Baroque painting and Karel Škréta was Vincenc Kramář who was ready to emphasize the painter’s epochal asset: “We can, however, fully acknowledge Škréta’s signiﬁcance for our art only if we realize how poor and weak our painting was when the artist ﬁrst appeared in public.”³⁶ Kramář also considerably contributed to the wide recognition of the stylistic points of departure in Škréta’s oeuvre. He straightforwardly interpreted the artist as timeless: “A new stage of development in our painting, including the art work of our days, indeed takes Škréta into account. And we certainly cannot more highly appraise his exploit than by saying that this outstanding painter laid the foundations of our modern artistic tradition.”³⁷ He, on the other hand, helped petrify many stereotypes which stretched through art history from as early as the beginning of the 19th century. Beside other things, he revived the age-long “exiles’” model of interpretation and agreed that the decisive stylistic turning point occurred outside Bohemia, and at the same time reduced Rudolﬁne art to a mere episode, utterly insigniﬁcant for future developments. Kramář also anticipated the later narrations of Jaromír Neumann by explaining Škréta’s art as an intrinsically Czech phenomenon. To him, his “lyricism” and “vigour” constituted the tradition which subsequently climaxed in the art of the “National Revival”. He thus also reﬂected the dispute over the character of Baroque in the Czech milieu and its signiﬁcance in shaping the modern nation. The latter issue was brought to life by the so-called dispute over the sense of Czech history whose tone was determined by as inﬂuential personalities as František Xaver Šalda and Josef Pekař during the 1920s and 1930s.³⁸ Kramář employed scientiﬁc methods derived from the works of the Viennese art-history school and combined them with “instinctual” intuition. This helped him construct the bygone dream of the 19th-century nationalist authors – the new Czech national school of painting: “The time has not yet come for us talk more widely about the speciﬁc or, eventually, Czech character of Škréta’s works without being in danger of one-sidedly interpreting the features of the period. For the time being, we must depend on our inherent instinct which makes us experience Škréta’s art as something essentially close to us. And the proof that our perception of it is correct can be, for example, the composition of Drahomíra’s death. It directly evokes in us the artists whose Czech nature is undoubted: Is not the scene in the church ﬁlled with the spirituality and unaffectedness of Tkadlík, and does not the main monumental composition contain something of the vigour of Aleš’s compositions in the foyer of the National Theatre?”³⁹ Antonín Matějček, another notable representative of Czech art history in the ﬁrst half of the 20th century, was considerably more critical of our artist. As he wrote in 1913, “Škréta’s transgression was his low genius”. But here, he totally failed to reﬂect the shift that had occurred from Pazaurek’s times, especially due to the 1910 exhibition of the painter. Matějček continues: “He lost orientation; he kept lingering on the surface of the quarrelling methods and mannerisms, adopting them indiscriminately and without understanding their inward sense. He sank to the artistic impurity of confused formulas; impurity which is ill-fated to all the weak.” His ﬁnal verdict on Škréta is unambiguous: “The faithful imprint of this puzzled mind is its work.”⁴⁰ Matějček’s coarse judgment nonetheless softens throughout his later synoptic explanations of the artistic developments in Bohemia: he gradually comes to acknowledge not only Škréta’s leading role in constituting local Baroque painting but also his ability to synthesize the contradictory Italian ideological movements.⁴¹ The author conformed to the main tendencies of contemporary art history and he, too, put Škréta in contrast with the allegedly poor quality of other painters active during his era in Bohemia. As he notes, “17th-century development in painting faltered for the same reasons as the development in sculpture. The Czech lands knew almost nothing about the grandiose ﬂorescence of early Baroque Italian painting, and this or that stylistic advancement and novelty arrived to us only with delay, via the Italians professing routine eclecticism.
