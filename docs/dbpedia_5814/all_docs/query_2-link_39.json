        "text": "Providing appropriate and stimulating information before and during the consumption phases can be one of the most effective strategies for emerging cultural heritage places to attract consumer flows. Heritage in its tangible, intangible and spiritual form is clearly associated with place and time. It produces the place’s image through its historical and contemporary credentials and provides an important incentive for place. The Cultural Heritage Environment consists of natural and manmade assets. It represents the cultural wealth and values of a given society accumulated over time. This process is dynamic and involves the duty to safeguard it from any interruptions. Undeniably the artifact seo ipso cannot stimulate to cultural consumption, unless the potential cultural heritage consumer attributes to them certain values, signifies them with certain meanings. The price [for experiencing a heritage site, is what ones pay, the value is what one receives. Apart from economic values heritage assets also possess nonuse values: people value the existence of heritage items even if they do not consume its services directly (existence value), wishing to preserve the option of possible future consumption (option value often related to WTP) and strive to bequeath the assets to future generations. To meet this challenge, the 2 Volumes introduce professional tourist guides to the principles of assessing heritage significance, formulate statements of significance and convey the significance of heritage places to different audiences and further stimulate visitor satisfaction, appreciation for heritage places and generate income at local level.\n\nABSTRACT Natural und cultural heritage is commonly recognized as the major capital for sustainable tourism development. It takes more effort and efficiency though to develop successful tourism at heritage places than just offer heritage resources to the tourism market below cost. In order to effectively use local heritage for tourism, a series of innovative tools need to be invented, which would guarantee: a- visitors a variety of memorable experiences, a range of activities and service quality at local level; b- destinations a branded tourist image and high added value products; c-local populations a highly effective job creation as well as fostering a sense of pride in local heritage. The Department of Physical Geography (IPG) at Albrecht Ludwigs Universität, Freiburg and the IRIS Research Laboratory, School of Business Planning, University of the Aegean have independently recognised the necessity to investigate widespread shortcomings and factors of success for sustainable tourism uses of heritage resources at local and regional level. Their common project aims to improve practical applications in the field of heritage management, especially in a” visitor-friendly” heritage context applying cognitive tools for tourism planning, validated by international literature review, praxis and data. The development of an international quality label for a visitor-centric Heritage Interpretation and further the development of curricula related with interpretation as a sub-discipline of heritage management is also a significant aim of the joint project. The results shall be also used for a follow-up project on international benchmarking in order to enhance the public presentation, management and marketing of heritage sites in diverse cultural and natural heritage contexts.\n\nThe University of Primorska offers several programmes under the Bologna Process covering the topics of heritage studies as well as its interpretation. Insights and skills acquired during the course of study introduce students to the specifics of the area, guiding them to understand various heritage fields and cultural assets within international setting. One of the courses was designed with the Faculty of Tourism Studies and is based on estimates about the need for a broader and quality inclusion of heritage in the tourist offer in Slovenia and abroad, due to a lack of suitably educated professionals. The study course is the first of its kind in Slovenia to fill in the void in higher education in the field of heritage, heritage management and cultural tourism. An important part of the study and students’ training is practical work on sites. One of the monuments where our students develop their understanding of heritage management and interpretation is the Archaeological park Simonov zaliv.\n\nBackground This guideline aims to help heritage site managers and site interpreters understand and improve visitors’ experience in their cultural heritage sites. It offers a practical approach and assumes visitor appreciation and understanding as a core part of a successful interpretation and presentation strategy. It also recognizes that for cultural heritage sites, the quality of the knowledge and experience that visitors gain from the story, as well as the historical and cultural significance of the place are the key factors in building awareness and sustaining interest. Objectives The cultural significance of some cultural heritage assets is easy to understand; however, less-prominent structural heritage assets or archaeological sites where physical evidence is often minimal, require further interpretation efforts in order to be appreciated. It is simple to describe the tangible elements of the cultural heritage asset because physical characteristics appeal more easily to the senses. However, it would be a challenge to link this appreciation to the more salient, intangible points of the cultural heritage asset. The goal of heritage interpretation is to engage visitors while challenging them to understand the value of a cultural heritage asset."
