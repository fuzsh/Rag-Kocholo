Based on documentary evidence, a chronology of bark\nbeetle outbreaks in the Czech Republic from 1781 to 1963âCE was created,\ncontinuing from 1964 through 2021 by bark beetle salvage felling data. The\nspatial distribution of bark beetle events concentrates on the border\nmountains of Bohemia and in the northern parts of Moravia and Silesia. The\ntemporal distribution of the most important bark beetle outbreaks\nis concentrated in the 1830s, 1870s, 1940sâ1950s, 1980s, 1990s, 2000s, and\n2010s. Each of these notable calamities was analysed in detail with respect\nto their spatial extent, the volume of damaged wood, and their\nmeteorological patterns. While meteorological triggers of the largest\noutbreaks of the 19th century were attributed especially to the slow\nprocession of disastrous volumes of damaged wood after large windstorm\nevents sometimes intensified by dying trees in subsequent dry years, the\nrecent warming with relatively stable precipitation from the 1980s moves the\nmain meteorological and climatological triggers to more frequent warm and\ndry meteorological patterns, acting simultaneously in interaction with\nsevere windstorms. The last bark beetle outbreak from 2015 was evaluated as\nthe most disastrous disturbance to spruce forest over the territory of the\nCzech Republic in documented history. The paper also discusses uncertainties in bark beetle data, responses to past bark beetle events, and relationships between environment, climate, and bark beetle outbreaks.",

        "text": "Recent warming with relatively stable precipitation totals was accompanied by important drought episodes during the 2010s at the central European scale, reflected in the appearance of severe meteorological, agricultural, and hydrological droughts (ZahradnÃ­Äek et al., 2015; Hoy et al., 2017, 2020; Ionita et al., 2017; Zscheischler and Fischer, 2020). One of the impacts of long drought of the 2010s across much of central Europe has been the population growth of bark beetle (especially Ips typographus) devastating the Norway spruce forests (e.g. HlÃ¡sny et al., 2021a, b; Jaime et al., 2022). The reason is that dry episodes with high temperatures decrease the vitality and structure of spruce, which has shallow roots; these characteristics result in less resistance to bark beetle attacks. In addition, droughts with high temperatures accelerate bark beetle evolution and increase the number of generations per breeding season (summer) to three at lower altitudes and two at higher ones (e.g. Pfeffer and SkuhravÃ½, 1995; JÃ¶nsson et al., 2009, 2011; Netherer et al., 2019; HlÃ¡sny et al., 2021a). Besides dry and warm patterns, other meteorological disturbances also play an important role. This is especially the case after severe windstorms with large numbers of uprooted or broken trees, as bark beetles use fallen, freshly dead trees â if such wood is not processed and removed from the forest stands relatively fast â as they propagate prodigiously and then invade healthy trees, significantly increasing the damage (e.g. Temperli et al., 2013; Thom et al., 2013; Stadelmann et al., 2014).\n\nBark beetle outbreaks have become a serious problem for spruce forests at the European scale. For example, Schelhaas et al.Â (2003), quantitatively analysing the role of natural disturbances in European forests from 1950â2000, attributed 16â% of the mean annual damage (35Ã106âm3 of wood) to biotic factors, half of which were caused by bark beetles. The most comprehensive recent study of the state of knowledge on drivers and impacts of bark beetle outbreaks in Europe comes from HlÃ¡sny et al.Â (2021a) with an extensive list of references. Among different aspects of bark beetle outbreaks, several papers analysed in great detail the effect of temperatures on the duration of the egg, larval, and pupal stages of the spruce bark beetle and adult maturation feeding (e.g. Annila, 1969; Wermelinger and Seifert, 1998, 1999). Besides temperatures, windstorms interact importantly with bark beetle disturbances (e.g. Temperli et al., 2013; Thom et al., 2013; Stadelmann et al., 2014), and this interaction can be amplified by climate change (e.g. Seidl and Rammer, 2017). Moreover, windstorms coupled with bark beetle outbreaks remain the most damaging agents in Norway spruce stands as shown, for example, in Slovakia (Kunca et al., 2019). Acute droughts appear to be another important driver of bark beetle infestation as shown by the example of Austria (Netherer et al., 2019), and the influence of droughts on bark beetle outbreaks will even threaten the persistence of European coniferous forests (Jaime et al., 2022). Droughts limiting soil water content contribute to tree transpiration deficit, increasing host susceptibility to bark beetle attacks (Matthews et al., 2018). Effects of summer temperatures, droughts, and windstorms on the dynamics of bark beetle outbreaks in Norway spruce forests were analysed across eight European countries by Marini et al.Â (2017). Great research attention concentrated also on effects of future climate change, represented by various climate scenarios, on different aspects of bark beetle occurrences focusing, for example, on Sweden (JÃ¶nsson et al., 2009), Scandinavia (JÃ¶nsson et al., 2011), Switzerland (Jakoby et al., 2019), or the Bavarian Forest National Park in Germany (Sommerfeld et al., 2020).\n\nInformation about past bark beetle occurrences is a part of Czech forestry literature (e.g. Chadt-Å evÄtÃ­nskÃ½, 1913; NoÅ¾iÄka, 1957; HoÅ¡ek, 1981). Some papers concentrated on focal areas of bark beetle outbreaks like the Å umava Mts after the disastrous windstorm of 26â27Â October 1870 (ZÃ¡loha, 1970) and during the 1870s (JelÃ­nek, 1988), while ZatloukalÂ (1998) analysed factors of past and present bark beetle calamities. The PHENIPS model was used to analyse the influence of future climate change on the country bark beetle distribution (HlÃ¡sny et al., 2011) and bark beetle dynamic in the Bohemian Forest (Berec et al., 2013). LubojackÃ½Â (2012) described the Czech legislation related to protection against bark beetle. ZahradnÃ­k and ZahradnÃ­kovÃ¡Â (2019) assessed salvage felling caused by bark beetle and other abiotic/biotic factors for 1998â2017. Past and recent bark beetle outbreaks in the Czech Republic after 1980âCE were described, for example, by SkuhravÃ½ and Å rotÂ (1988), MrkvaÂ (1993), SkuhravÃ½Â (2002), and HlÃ¡sny et al.Â (2021b).\n\nAn unprecedented bark beetle outbreak began in the Czech Republic from about 2003 (ZahradnÃ­k and ZahradnÃ­kovÃ¡, 2019; HlÃ¡sny et al., 2021b). Two questions arise. First, how does this outbreak appear in the context of preceding bark beetle outbreaks? And second, does recent climate change completely alter the conditions of such events? We must then analyse not only the conditions of more recent events but also similar situations from the past. This is the aim of the article, covering the period from the 18th through the 21st centuries. In order to fulfil this request, the most comprehensive and unique series of bark beetle outbreaks in the Czech Republic was created for this study and used to analyse and discuss meteorological and climatological triggers accompanying the notable bark beetle outbreaks. Having in mind that these outbreaks are the result of complicated humanâenvironmentâclimate interactions, this study concentrates only on one part of this interaction.\n\nDifferent documentary data of bark beetle occurrences (see Sect.Â 2.1) were critically evaluated to create a database containing information about the time (year), place, special bark beetle information (occurrence, type of damage, damaged volume of wood, measures against bark beetle), and source of report. Information about place was divided according to ownership of forest stands such as estates (domains) or towns, sometimes specified to the corresponding forest district or even individual forest stand. Because some older quantitative data about the felling of wood invaded by bark beetle as well as the area of such affected stands were expressed in older units, they were recalculated to recent units as follows: the volume unit 1 fathom (sÃ¡h) equals 2.842âm3 of stacked wood or 1.8954âm3 of solid wood (i.e. without the air between the logs); the areal unit 1 square measure (jitro) equals 0.5754âha.\n\nThe created new database was used to describe long-term spatiotemporal variability in bark beetle occurrences across the CR between 1781 and 1963âCE, from which the three most outstanding bark beetle outbreaks based on the spatial extent and estimated volume of damaged wood were selected for detailed analyses. These outbreaks were complemented by four events identified as having the highest volumes of bark beetle salvage felling since 1964. The spatial distribution of bark beetle occurrences during the two outbreaks from the 19th century are characterized by estates (domains) and localities with invaded forest stands, while selected outbreaks after 1963 were spatially attributed to 77 newly established administrative districts (okres), expressing total volumes of bark beetle salvage felling for them as well as volumes in the individual years of a given outbreak. For the description of meteorological and climatological patterns, annual and summer (JuneâAugust) anomalies of air temperature, precipitation totals, scPDSI-3 (summer), and scPDSI-12 (annual) with respect to the 1961â1990 reference period were expressed. This reference period was preferred to the more recent 1991â2020 period because of more stable climatic patterns and a weaker effect of recent warming (BrÃ¡zdil et al., 2022b). For corresponding monthly anomalies, their cumulative sums were calculated starting from the January anomaly of the first year of the related bark beetle outbreak and finishing by the addition of the December anomaly of the last year. A description of climatological patterns was complemented by the reporting of windstorms as a meteorological disturbance, taken from our historical climatological database. The events from 1964 were further complemented by annual volumes of salvage felling, separately attributed to bark beetle and windstorms.\n\nIn order to characterize the general climatological conditions of all seven selected bark beetle outbreaks together, a composite or superposed epoch analysis was applied (Haurwitz and Brier, 1981), calculating the mean summer and annual anomalies of temperatures, precipitation, scPDSI-3, and scPDSI-12 5Â years before and 5Â years after the first year of the corresponding outbreak (see Sect.Â 4.2.8). The statistical significance (pâ<â0.05) of these anomalies was estimated using a random bootstrapping approach (Rao et al., 2019). The method uses a composite matrix in which the rows represent the years of the bark beetle outbreak (event years) and the columns are analysed data (temperature, precipitation, scPDSI) for 5Â years before and after the event (lag years). In a random bootstrapping approach, 500 unique versions of composite matrices were created drawing unique subsets of event years at random without replacement. For each column (that is for years from lagÂ â5 to lagÂ +5) and for each normalized composite matrix the density function and its percentiles were calculated. For each lag year the mean data anomaly (temperature, precipitation, scPDSI) that exceeded the 95th percentile, was considered statistically significant (see, e.g., Adams et al., 2003, or Rao et al., 2019, for more details).\n\nTo analyse large-scale circulation patterns corresponding to years around bark beetle outbreaks, we used an objective classification of circulation types based on flow strength, flow direction, and vorticity (Jenkinson and Collison, 1977; PlavcovÃ¡ and KyselÃ½, 2011), calculated with respect to the geographic midpoint of the CR from sea level pressure data in an NCEP/NCAR reanalysis (Kalnay et al., 1996). This classification defines nine anticyclonic types, nine cyclonic types, and eight directional types; the type U stands separately for unclassified patterns (see ÅehoÅ et al., 2021a, for more details). Relative frequencies of circulation types in years around outbreaks were expressed as differences with respect to corresponding mean frequencies of the 1961â1990 reference period. These relative differences were further tested by the two-proportion Z test (Sprinthall, 2011) for their statistical significance (pâ<â0.05).\n\n5.1âThe database and data uncertainty\n\nData concerning past and recent bark beetle outbreaks are biased by different types of uncertainties. As is typical of data collected from different documentary sources (e.g. BrÃ¡zdil et al., 2005), they can only go into certain detail (e.g. forest stands belonging to any estate in the past without detailed specification into individual forest districts) and suffer by incompleteness; i.e. they represent rather lower estimates of spatiotemporal occurrences. Many reports of past bark beetle outbreaks suffer from missing quantitative data about the volume of damaged wood. Such data appear rather randomly in some reports without the possibility of obtaining total volumes for the whole country. If such country estimates do exist, they can differ from author to author or only repeat earlier presented data. Concerning older reports, in some cases not only could Ips typographus have been named as a primary pest damaging spruce trees, but information could be included on other pests or conifers (fir, pine), depending also on the related development of knowledge about forest pests (see Sect.Â 5.2). For example, the order of the Prague Gubernium from 1784 âpoints out a mass withering of spruce and fir caused by worms between wood and bark, which cannot be killed â¦ â (Nechleba, 1929) and also reported them as âflying wormsâ (LubojackÃ½, 2012).\n\nConcerning data about bark beetle salvage felling from 1964, some uncertainties may also appear there, like problems with a clear distinction between the volumes of salvage felling attributed to drought, air pollution, and bark beetle infestation, as reported by individual foresters. Concerning the homogeneity of the whole 1964â2021 series, political change in former Czechoslovakia after the Velvet Revolution in 1989 led to a change in the ownership of forest stands. The privatization of some forests (from former state ownership to private owners) after 1990 led to a lower number of reporting districts, i.e. data concern approximately three-quarters of the forest stands in the CR.\n\nDespite the above uncertainties, the created database, covering the last 240Â years, represents a unique source of information not only for the CR but also as an important contribution to the knowledge of past (historical) and present bark beetle outbreaks in Europe, complementing similar data from some other studies (see, e.g., Fig.Â 8 in Schelhaas et al., 2003). For example, Schafstall et al.Â (2022) found only three main bark beetle outbreaks between 1400âBP and the present in the High Tatras (Slovakia) (the last one post-2004 after the disastrous windstorm Elizabeth of 19Â November 2004), in which Ips typographus was rather low in numbers. Moreover, bark beetles remain rather neglected in palaeoecology with only a few dozen reported sites in Europe for the whole of the Holocene (Schafstall et al., 2020).\n\n5.2âHuman responses to past bark beetle outbreaks\n\nStudies on bark beetles were published as early as the 18th century, especially by foresters from Saxony, which was hit by a severe bark beetle outbreak in the 1780s (JÃ¤ger, 1798; Dallinger, 1798), similar to the Czech Lands (see Sect.Â 4.1.1). These works also mention that beetles had been destroying spruce stands for centuries, for example, in the Harz mountains in north-central Germany. Similarly, in the Czech Lands, TrzebitzkyÂ (1798) published a practical handbook on the drying out of needle-leaved forests, in which he discussed bark beetles as well. Bark beetles also remained a much discussed topic in the first half of the 19th century (e.g. Krutzsch, 1825), but, according to PfeiferÂ (1875), in the 1820s there was still a general lack of knowledge among local foresters concerning bark beetles. Such early studies mainly focused on the natural history of bark beetles in order to come up with a device for forestry managers to prevent outbreaks. The 1830s outbreak led to the publication of management guidelines by the Czech Gubernium on the handling of beetle-infected forest stands (NoÅ¾iÄka, 1957).\n\nThe outbreak following the 1868 and 1870 windstorms led to intense interest in the topic. First, the logistics of removing huge numbers of infected trunks posed considerable challenges. For example, in the Å umava Mts, the processing of damaged trees required the construction of new roads and tracks. To obtain access to the forests, 33â000 trunks in the Vimperk area had to be processed in November 1870 (ZÃ¡loha, 1970). Moreover, seven water sawmills were newly created and 850 workers from Bohemia and Bavaria were hired, of whom 670 worked throughout the summer of 1871. However, it was clear that infected trees could not be removed quickly enough. This created societal tensions as well. An attempt to save money with the hiring of foreign workers after the 1870 windstorm was reported on the PrÃ¡Å¡ily estate. The local forester hired only 50 foreign workers to process the windstorm-damaged trees, and, together with local workers, they were unable to debark all trunks in time, and a subsequent bark beetle outbreak threatened the forests of the surrounding estates, including those in neighbouring Bavaria (US8, pp.Â 217â218). The owner of the ChodovÃ¡ PlanÃ¡ estate warned his forest employees in 1875 that they were not allowed to speak publicly about the calamity and that all the data about the felling were an official secret. This was a reaction to newspaper articles criticizing the estate for its insufficient measures against bark beetles (US9, pp.Â 117â118).\n\nThe catastrophe also shook the foundations of the forestry profession. The Society of Bohemian Foresters (BÃ¶hmischer Forstverein) â the main forum for exchanging knowledge on forestry in the country â kept the topic on its agenda. Lively discussions on bark beetles took place at the plenary meetings of the society every year from 1870 to 1875. In the beginning, most contributions focused on technical solutions, such as the use of âtrap treesâ (to attract bark beetles) or the swift removal and burning of infected tree bark. Only occasional references were made to alternative methods; for example, the protection of birds, being as they are the natural enemies of bark beetles (Vereinsschrift fÃ¼r Forst-, Jagd- und Naturkunde, 1872, p.Â 64). In 1874, however, Forstmeister Alois NedobitÃ½ argued that the outbreak could to a large extent be blamed on the foresters themselves. The forced removal of dead trees was counterproductive because it prevented those useful insects from developing that could slow down the procreation of bark beetles (Vereinsschrift fÃ¼r Forst-, Jagd- und Naturkunde, 1874, p.Â 66). A year later, Forstmeister Soucha made an appeal to the entire nation (and, by implication, to all Czech foresters) to reconsider clear-cuts and tree planting as their preferred way of forest regeneration. What the bark beetle outbreak taught foresters, he argued, was that natural regeneration was plentiful under the damaged trees if only foresters did not destroy it through tree removal (Vereinsschrift fÃ¼r Forst-, Jagd- und Naturkunde, 1875, pp.Â 150â157). However, reactions to such contributions were not favourable and cutting remained the main method to combat bark beetle outbreaks.\n\nIn the following decades, the focus of foresters shifted from bark beetles to other insects, mainly the nun moth, which caused much more damage in this period (SyrovÃ¡tka, 1922). However, the catastrophes of the latter were used as opportunities to carry out comparative studies on bark beetles in the 1920s (e.g. KomÃ¡rek, 1925). Some attention reverted to bark beetles as a result of the outbreak in 1944â1947. New perspectives were also included: for example, PfefferÂ (1952) wrote that this outbreak was the first that was not directly connected to a previous windstorm. Rather, the proximate cause was the excessive harvesting of spruces during World War II that were often left lying in forests.\n\nAs the state gradually took over the management of forests from estates, regulations concerning bark beetles started to be included in national legislation. The first and second forest laws of Czechoslovakia (1960 and 1977) both included passages on bark beetles, mainly on the obligations of forest owners to find and remove infected trees. Following the outbreak of the 1980s, special instructions for fighting bark beetles were issued by the Ministry for Forestry and Water Management (LubojackÃ½, 2012). Mutatis mutandis, all these instructions followed the general principles established in the 19th century without questioning their general validity or effectiveness.\n\n5.3âEnvironment, climate, and bark beetle outbreaks\n\nBark beetle outbreaks in the 19th century appear to have occurred mostly at higher altitudes, where the presence of extensive spruce stands can be expected. Even though conifer plantations started in the Czech Lands after 1800 (NoÅ¾iÄka, 1968), discussions after the bark beetle outbreak in the 1870s suggest that many, if not most, stands affected were not yet spruce monocultures. More detailed studies would be needed to confirm this, but the prevailing method of dealing with outbreaks (removing all infected trees) and artificial forest regeneration â as observed by foresters in the 19th century â may have contributed to creating forests that were increasingly susceptible to windstorms (BrÃ¡zdil et al., 2018b) and also to bark beetle outbreaks. In addition, in the 20th century, spruce was extensively planted in even-aged monocultures in lower-lying regions. While such regions were not hit by bark beetle in the 1940sâ1950s (Fig.Â 6), they suffered considerable damage from the 1980s onwards (Figs.Â 7â10). The planting of extensive conifer monocultures reduced the biodiversity of Czech forests, exhausted the soil, and increased the susceptibility of forests to natural disasters (e.g. through even-aged structure, mutual competition for essential nutrients, lack of space for the root system and treetop) (Daniel et al., 2013). Without the existence of conifers monocultures in the lowlands and at middle altitudes, forests would be composed especially of oak, beech, and fir (NeuhÃ¤uslovÃ¡ et al., 1997). However, in the last few years, the area covered by spruce monoculture plantations in the CR declined from 54.1â% in 2000 to about 48.8â% in 2020, which should contribute to the attenuation of the above-mentioned negative phenomena (Ministerstvo zemÄdÄlstvÃ­, 2021).\n\nThe analysis of past and recent large bark beetle outbreaks in the CR demonstrates the importance of meteorological (windstorms) and climatological (temperature and precipitation, resulting in droughts) factors as the main triggers of such outbreaks (cf. Fig.Â 11), appearing as a manifestation of long-term climate variability, enhanced by recent climate change (cf. Fig.Â 3). These results are confirmed by many other European studies, demonstrating the importance of temperatures for the development and voltinism of bark beetles (e.g. Annila, 1969; Wermelinger and Seifert, 1998, 1999; JÃ¶nsson et al., 2009), heavy windstorms as drivers of subsequent bark beetle outbreaks (e.g. Temperli et al., 2013; Thom et al., 2013; Stadelmann et al., 2014; Seidl and Rammer, 2017; BrÃ¡zdil et al., 2018a), and droughts accompanied by high temperatures as other key factors in producing disastrous outbreaks (e.g. Marini et al., 2017; Matthews et al., 2018; Netherer et al., 2019; HlÃ¡sny et al., 2021b; Jaime et al., 2022).\n\nUnsurprisingly, many researchers address the problem of bark beetle outbreaks in the context of future climate change manifest in global warming, the latter of which will contribute to worsening conditions for spruce forests (e.g. HlÃ¡sny et al., 2011; JÃ¶nsson et al., 2011; Berec et al., 2013; Jakoby et al., 2019; Sommerfeld et al., 2020). HlÃ¡sny et al.Â (2021a) summarized the effects of climate change on bark beetles as being factors facilitating their survival and development, increasing their potential to spread to higher altitudes and latitudes, and contributing to reduced tree resistance due to extreme weather/climatic extremes.\n\nRecent climate developments in the CR are characterized by continuous warming in past decades, enhanced from the 1980s and especially from the 2010s (ZahradnÃ­Äek et al., 2021, 2022), and relatively stable precipitation totals (BrÃ¡zdil et al., 2021) with increasing soil dryness (Trnka et al., 2015; ÅehoÅ et al., 2021b), and this with the simultaneous effects of windstorms creates suitable conditions for increasing climatic stress on forest stands, resulting in bark beetle outbreaks. The consequences for Norway spruce plantation in the CR from climate change will be further enhanced by the fact that climate projections to 2041â2060 indicate that suitable conditions for spruce only comprise 11.3â% of the area of Czech forests, while in 1961â1990 it was 46.0â% (ÄermÃ¡k et al., 2021).\n\nIn 7Â years from 2015 to 2021, the recent bark beetle devastation of forests in the CR destroyed 55.46Ã106âm3 of wood, which is more than the total for the previous 51Â years (34.80Ã106âm3) for which quantitative bark beetle salvage felling data are available (cf. Fig.Â 2). The highest annual bark beetle felling in 2020 (14.89Ã106âm3) was not exceeded by any other biotic factors (other insects, gnawing of trees by wild animals, mushroom pathogens) nor by any abiotic factors (wind, snow, rime, drought, air pollution). As follows from Fig.Â 13a, bark beetle salvage felling was higher than that caused by windstorms since 1964 only in 1995 and then from 2016 onwards, giving for the last outbreak in 2015â2021 more than 3 times higher volumes than in the case of windstorms (17.03Ã106âm3). The highest windstorm salvage felling was recorded in 1990 with 8.77Ã106âm3 of wood (i.e. before the 1992â1995 bark beetle outbreak) and in 2007 with 8.84Ã106âm3, followed in 2008 by 4.85Ã106âm3 (i.e. during the 2007â2010 outbreak). Another well-expressed maximum appeared in 1982â1987 outbreak with 5.94Ã106âm3 in 1984 and 6.50Ã106âm3 in 1985. There is a clear relationship to extreme windstorms, such as Kyrill in 2007 or Emma in 2008, while the annual frequency of selected severe windstorms across the CR in the months JanuaryâMarch together with OctoberâDecember (Fig.Â 13b) does not show any clear relationship to damaged and processed wood. The dominant proportion of windstorms of the winter half year in volumes of salvage felling was disturbed only by the summer windstorm on 12â13Â July 1984 (see BrÃ¡zdil et al., 2018b).\n\nBesides environmental, cultural, and socio-economic consequences, the recent devastation of spruce forest stands and the subsequent formation of forest hollows due to the felling of trees influence fluxes of CO2 between forests and the atmosphere, when places cleared of trees enhance fluxes of CO2 from the soil to the atmosphere (HlÃ¡sny et al., 2021a). This means that such stands can change from being CO2 sinks to CO2Â sources, as has already occurred since 2018 in the CR (e.g. CENIA, 2021), and in such ways indirectly impact the climate by producing this important greenhouse gas (13.6âMtâCO2âeq. for 2019 in LULUCF â land use, land-use change, and forestry). As follows from inventorying greenhouse gases produced in the CR, the forests have become sources ofÂ increasing CO2, further promoting the âanthropogenicâ footprint of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions due to the deterioration of the health conditions of forests caused by bark beetle infestation and droughts (e.g. CENIA, 2021).\n\nAdams, J.
