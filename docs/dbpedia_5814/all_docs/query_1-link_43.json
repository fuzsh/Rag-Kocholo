        "text": "The teralological variability of the dental system in the main genera of palaearctic shrews (Crocidura, Sorex, Neomys) is considered. The examination of 98 animals with aberrations (that were found among 16500 collection samples) allowed defining several groups of dental anomaly. All the categories of teeth (except for molars) were found can bear dental anomalies; the most vulnerable are I3 and Pm2. However, the material presented does not permit to consider the features investigated as a result of the general evolution of the dental system in shrews."
