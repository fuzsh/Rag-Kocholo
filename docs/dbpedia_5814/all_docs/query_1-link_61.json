In 1495, with arrival of Noble Family of Trčka of Lípa, the town started to develop.[1] The centre of thwe town gained its present appearance in Neo-Gothic style after a large fire broke out on October 7, 1866, which was painted by Alois Beer (1833-1897).\n\nThe town of Dobruška is known mainly because of the Czech patriotic writer František Ladislav Hek, whose career was described in Alois Jirásek's novel entitled F.
