MACEDONIA (GREECE). M. Lazaridou-Dimitriadou Laboratory of Zoology, School of Biology, Faculty of Sciences, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, 54006 Thessaloniki, Macedonia, Greece ABSTRACT The life cycle, population dynamics, and growth of the pulmonate snail Helicella (Xerothracia) pappi were studied in northern Greece. The spatial distribution of H. рарр! was found to be contagious. Demographic analysis of its population revealed that (a) three cohorts exist throughout the year, (b) increased growth rate is observed during spring, (c) snails attain their maturity 21 months after hatching when their greatest shell diameter reaches 15 mm, and (d) it is an iteroparous species, with egg-laying in autumn. Von Bertalanffy analysis showed that H. рарр! may reach its maximum size (dead shells collected in the field had 25.5 mm maximum shell diameter) in four years. Shell morphology changes when spermatozoa are fully formed in the gonad for the first time. Mortality rate is high just after hatching and also after winter, when tissue degrowth occurs, at which time the snails lose 33% of their biomass. Life expectancy decreases with increasing age. Net reproductive rate (Ro) was 3.025, per capita rate of increase (г) is 0.04, annual production (P) was 5.82 + 0.45 g/(m?-yr) in 1987 and 3.73 + 0.31 g/(m?-yr) in 1988, mean standing crop (В) was 2.89 g/m? in 1987 and 1.81 g/m? т 1988, and annual productivity rate constant (P/B) was 0.2 per year in both 1987 and 1988. Key words: Biology, ecology, growth, production, snail, Helicella pappi, Xerolenta obvia. INTRODUCTION Little is known about the species Helicella (Xerothracia) pappi Schútt, 1962. Wagner (1927) referred population of this species from near our study area in Xanthi, southern Thrace, to Martha filimargo Krynicki, placing it in the genus Helicopsis Fitzinger, 1833. Ur- banski (1960) said that samples from south- ern Thrace of Helicella (Helicopsis) filimargo (Rossmássler) did not differ from samples of Krimea and Odesco. Schútt (1962) described the shell and genital apparatus of samples of Helicella (Xerothracia) pappi from a type lo- cality in Philippi, Kavala, eastern Macedonia; he claimed that this species could not be placed in the genus Helicopsis, as Wagner (1927) had done, because of such shell fea- tures as curvature and the presence of a keel. Hausdorf (1988) claimed that H. рарр! could not be placed in a subgenus of Helicella be- cause it differs in the dart sac and in the nerves coming from the cerebral ganglia. He concluded that it is a subspecies of Xerolenta obvia. In the present study we are using the name Helicella (Xerothracia) pappi following Schütt (1962), because the samples come from the type locality. We have studied the biology and ecology of this species, which 1$ re- stricted to Philippi, eastern Macedonia, in or- der to find out why this species does not have a broader and continuous distribution from Krimea to Greece. METHODS AND MATERIALS Helicella рарр! was studied in the archae- ological site of Philippi, 25 km from Kavala, eastern Macedonia, Greece. Philippi is a limestone area with limited vegetation, т- cluding mosses, lichens, several Taraxacum species, and succulent plants. Several grass species are dominant. Apart from Н. pappi, there are small, sparse populations of Lindol- holmia lens and Helix figulina. Weather con- ditions during the investigation period are shown in Figure 1. Random samples (Lewis 4 Taylor, 1972) were taken every month for three consecutive years between April 1986 and April 1989. No samples were taken in winter (December through February), when the snails are in di- 2 LAZARIDOU-DIMITRIADOU Mean monthly 90 temperature (°С) ==_== Total precipitation 50 (mm) ern 45 A86M J J AS О М ОМ87А M J J AS О NM88A MJ JAS ON DM89A М Months FIG. 1.

Quadrat sample-size (25 x 25 cm?) was determined by Healy's method (Cancela da Fonseca, 1965). Elliot's (1971) method was used to determine the necessary total number of sampling units (sampling error less than 20%). Sampling was carried out during morning hours in the ab- sence of rain. All snails found in a quadrat were collected, measured and then replaced. The largest diameter of the shell (D) and the peristome diameter (d) were measured with vernier calipers to the nearest 0.1 mm. D was used for size-frequency histograms, using 3-mm class intervals (Cancela da Fonseca, 1965). The cohorts were discriminated using probability paper (Harding, 1949). This method was valid because the modes of the age-classes were separated by at least 2.5 standard deviations (Grant, 1989), except for two cases, one in March 1987 and one in June 1988; although many age classes had less than 50 individuals, the modal values were consistent from month to month. This con- firms that the modes were real and not the result of sampling variation. The same method has been used before for demographic anal- yses of other populations of molluscs (Hughes, 1970; Lévéque, 1972; Daguzan, 1975; Lazaridou-Dimitriadou et Kattoulas, 1991). There were no statistically significant vari- ations in field density over the three years. Life data and rate estimates were based on successive samples over 1987 and 1988. Spatial distribution of the snails in the hab- itat was examined by using Taylor's (1961) power law 6° = ax”, where 6° = variance and x = mean number of snails/0.25 m“. For the study of relative growth, the mor- phometric criteria of shell diameter (D) in re- lation to the peristome diameter (d) were used from all the animals sampled during 1987 (М = 2567). Mayrat's method (1965а, b) was used to compare the growth of D in re- lation to d between immature and mature snails. A logarithmic transformation was ар- plied to the data. Bertalanffy’s (1938) method was used to calculate the theoretical growth curve and life span; this method is widely used (Moreteau, 1987). Life-table and fertility data, as well as an- nual secondary production, were estimated as described for Helix lucorum (Staikou et al., 1988) and Eobania vermiculata (Lazaridou- Dimitriadou 4 Kattoulas, 1991). Annual pro- duction is calculated by the size-frequency method because single cohorts need not be identified. For dry body-weight (Wb) analysis, 100 an- imals comprising five from each size class were individually marked and their greatest shell diameter (D) was measured; they were then dried to constant weight over a period of 36 h in a vacuum at room temperature. Shell organic matter was calculated as the residual weight of dry shell after treatment with 5 m mol/ml HCl, successive washing over a fine filter; the residue was dried in a vacuum. Two size classes were used; one comprised im- BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY OF HELICELLA PAPPI 3 2 N/2500 ст 30 egglaying 0 A86M J J O М DM87A M JJ ег аут? egglaying О NM88A M JJ N DM89M Months FIG. 2.

These size classes were chosen as a result of study of the maturation of the geni- talia and gonad. The shell organic matter was then added to the dry body weight of the different size classes and the sum was used (Table 3) in estimating annual secondary pro- duction. RESULTS Aspects of the Biology of Helicella pappi Helicella pappi is an iteroparous species with overlapping generations throughout the year. Rate of growth and reproduction were not constant during the three study years (Figs. 2, 4). The greatest shell diameter of sexually mature snails was 22 mm, and ma- turity was attained 21 months after hatching (Figs. 3, 4) for 98% of the population. The aperture lip started to form 23 to 24 months after hatching. In the third year, the other 2% of the population matured. Egg laying took place at the end of September, October or November (Fig. 2), depending on the prevail- ing climatic conditions, especially precipita- tion (Fig. 1) Measurements of ten egg clutches in the field showed that the mean number of eggs laid was 69 + 4.3 (т + SE), with a range of 42 to 85 eggs, and the mean weight of 70 eggs was 0.03 + 0.004 g. The mean number of eggs laid by older adults, which had already laid eggs in the previous year, was 22 + 1.9 (m + SE) (N = 5), with a range of 18 to 28 eggs. Hatching took place 25 days to one month later, but hatchlings remained in the soil. The greatest shell diam- eter of the newly hatched snails was 1.5 + 0.09 mm. By marking ten different egg clutches, hatching and after-hatching losses were estimated at 55%. After-hatching losses were estimated in the laboratory to be 20%. During winter, from the end of Novem- ber to the end of February, the snails did not really hibernate. Juveniles formed a thin, transparent epiphragm, whereas 30% of the snails with 14 > D > 7 formed a thick epi- phragm. Snails with D > 14 mm did not form an epiphragm, but they diapaused under creeping plants occurring on the soil or stones. No real aestivation took place. During July and August, all snails diapaused during 4 LAZARIDOU-DIMITRIADOU TABLE 1.

Snails were active during spring and on humid weather in summer (Fig. 1). Helicella pappi became mature and the genitalia became well formed when D > 14 mm. Histologically, the gonad of these snails showed fully formed spermatozoa during Oc- tober (the reproductive period), although oocytes were not fully grown. There was a positive correlation (r? = 0.918, М = 100, P< 0.001) between (а) the greatest shell diameter (D) and the corresponding dry body weight and (b) the dry body weight and the dry shell weight (r° = 0.742, N = 100, Р < 0.001). Population Dynamics and Spatial Distribution The population fluctuated during the study period (Fig. 2). The mean population density was 18.1 + 3.3 snails/0.25 m° (mean + SE) in 1986, 14.4 + 6.6 in 1987, and 12.7 + 1.5 in 1988. An ANOVA test among the three con- secutive years did not show any statistical differences (F = 1.646, P = 0.2077) in the population densities. Densities of H. рарр! peaked in early spring. The population den- sity was above the mean density for 5-6 months (Fig. 2). The spatial distribution of H. рарр! was found to be contagious because parameter b of Taylor's power law was equal fo) 21043 [© ОТ Demographic Analysis of the Population of Helicella рарр! The analysis of size frequency histograms (Fig. 3, 4) with probability paper showed that: (a) three cohorts existed in the habitat throughout the year; a fourth was added after the reproductive period, though the third co- hort contained adults of different ages (Fig. Juveniles 2<D<14 Adults 14<D<22 1.254 + 0.088 0.859 + 0.012 0.270 + 0.005 0.545 + 0.009 0.922 0.801 0.515 + 0.153 0.75 + 0.057 0.916 + 0.122 1.19 + 0.049 1600 969 4); (b) increased growth rate was observed during spring. An ANOVA test showed no statistical differences in the daily rate of spring growth among the three consecutive years of study (Fig. 4); (c) mature snails of 15 mm attained their maximum size 21 months after hatching; (d) when egg laying took place in October (Fig. 2: 1987), depending on the degree of precipitation (Fig. 1), the hatchlings appeared in November (Fig. 3: 27-11-87). When egg laying took place in November, the hatchlings appeared in early spring (Fig. 3: 20-3-88 and 31-3-89), possibly because it 1$ safer for thin-shelled juveniles to stay buried in the soil. Relative Growth of D in Relation to d In the field, growth rate was high during periods of suitable weather, but there was no significant growth during winter and summer. Growth was most rapid in spring, from March till May (Fig. 4). There was a positive correla- tion between greatest shell diameter and peri- stome diameter for the whole population of Н. рарр! (Table 1). Growth rate was faster in juveniles (a = 1.254) than in adults (a = 0.859), and growth was more heterogenous in juve- niles than in adults, because their standard deviations of the mean were greater (Table 1). According to Mayrat's (1965a, b) method, the intersection point between the rate growth of these two subpopulations (juveniles + adults) occurred at D = 13.9 mm. This, according to histological examination of gonads in relation to the age of the snails, was the diameter at which spermatozoa were fully grown.

The above equation was calculated by using the known greatest shell diameter in the field (26 mm), the mean D value of newly hatched snails, which was 1.2 mm, and the mean size of young snails first sampled in the field, which was 1.5 mm (Fig. 3: November 1987). 6 LAZARIDOU-DIMITRIADOU АЗ © М D MESA М т Аз SOsM Ти $ О ММ: 8 А МО Л ВА $ Months FIG. 4.

Life and Fertility Table For the construction of the fertility table, we used (a) the numbers of eggs laid by two or three-year old adults, and by adults of more than three years old, known from field observations and (b) egg-hatching and after- hatching losses calculated in the field and the laboratory respectively. From Table 2, the following may be con- cluded: (a) mortality rate (Kx) was high after hatching and then stabilized. It increased af- ter the first winter, before the second winter (in 3-year-old adults snails) and stayed high after the third winter, (b) values of expecta- tion of life (ex) decreased with increasing age, (c) the value of net reproductive rate (Ro) was high (Ro = 3.024), and (d) the per capita rate of increase was greater than zero, with a rate of 0.04 per unit of time. Annual Secondary Production The calculations for Hynes’ size-frequency method are listed in Table 3. The mean bio- mass of each size class was expressed as dry-weight of body plus organic material of the shell. After conversion, using Benke's (1979) correction, annual production (P) was found to be 5.82 + 0.45 g/(m?-yr) in 1987 and 3.73 + 0.31 g/(m*-yr) in 1988. Biomass (В) was 2.89 g/m” т 1987 and 1.81g/m° in 1988. The annual productivity rate constant (P/B) was 0.21 in both 1987 and in 1988. Turnover time (B/P x 365 days) was 1765 days in 1987 and 1775 days in 1988. DISCUSSION The contagious spatial distribution of H. рарр! is similar to the xerothermophilic spe- cies living in similar habitats in Greece (e.g., Xeropicta arenosa and Cernuella virgata (Laz- aridou-Dimitriadou 8 Kattoulas, 1985). Recruitment of newly hatched snails of H. pappi seems to be the main reason for the rise in population density after winter. The low values of population density in November and December are due to the fact that some BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY OF HELICELLA РАРР! TABLE 2.

The population dy- namics suggests that there is a characteristic annual periodicity, with synchronization of population and life-cycle development. This appears to be a species adapted to recover slowly after an adverse period. The slow re- covery of the population results from the low hatch-rate of eggs deposited just before the adverse period. The low rate of juvenile de- velopment into adult stage during spring, and the rapid decline in population size after the density peak, indicate a reduced reproduc- tive effort of later adult stages. Increased growth took place during spring because temperatures were not exceedingly high (20°C), and total monthly precipitation did not fall below 20-30 mm (Fig. 1). During autumn, growth took place only in juveniles (Fig. 4) when temperatures were around 15°С (in October and November) and only if there was precipitation. Newly hatched snails dur- ing that period of the year remained dormant. The rate of growth, however, was not the same for newly hatched snails and juveniles (Fig. 4). This is also related to differences in temperature [e.g., the 1987 March (5.8°) and April (12.5%) temperatures were lower than in 1986 (8.6 — 15.4”C respectively)]. Addition- ally, the growth rate was not the same for juveniles and mature snails. This was evident from the study of the population analysis of H. pappi and from the comparison of the rate of relative growth of D in relation to d be- tween juveniles and adults. This is a general phenomenon in many Helicidae and it is usu- BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY OF HELICELLA PAPPI 9 ally due to internal changes in genitalia and gonad maturation (Yom-Tov, 1971; Bonavita, 1972; Williamson, 1976; Lazaridou-Dimitria- dou, 1986; Staikou et al., 1988). Seasonal variation in growth and, more specifically, in- creased growth rate in spring, have been re- ported for other snails in Greece, including Е. vermiculata (Lazaridou-Dimitriadou & Kattou- las, 1985), X. arenosa and C. virgata (Lazari- dou-Dimitriadou, 1986), H. lucorum (Staikou et al., 1988), B. fruticum (Staikou et al., 1990), and М. cartusiana (Staikou & Lazaridou-Dim- itriadou, 1990). Baba (1985) also reports that growth is related to climatic factors and that it increases only before sexual maturity. As for H. lucorum (Staikou et al., 1988), B. fruti- cum (Staikou et al., 1990) and other terrestrial snails, H. pappi continues to increase D even after maturation, because it is heterothermic. There were adverse periods during which ac- tivity, and consequently growth and repro- duction, stopped. These periods coincided mainly with winter and summer drought. Moreover, the values of k showed that winter constitutes the most important environmen- tal stress. Helicella pappi matures only in the second year of its life, with a rate of increase equal to 0.041. Being iteroparous, this snail reproduces again after its first egglaying. However, it seems that high reproductive output on one occasion influences future re- productive output. Although Ro and the turn- over time was high (1,775 days), productivity rate (0.2/year) was low, which may be related to the long life span (4 years) and high mor- tality of this species at subadult and adult stages, especially after winter. Moreover, maintenance costs during dormant periods are increased; 33% of the previously ac- quired biomass 1$ lost. These snails try to ex- ploit favourable conditions, but the absence of a true hibernation or aestivation and a var- ied capacity for dormancy cause the death of much of the population. The annual adult mortality rate was similar to that reported by Osterhoff (1977) and Williamson et al. (1977) for С. nemoralis and by Shachak et al. (1975) for Sphincterochila zonata, which also has a life-span of 4-6 years. Turnover times are ob- viously related to length of life; long turnover times have only been reported for such bi- valves as Anodonta (1,789 days/4.9 years) (Russell-Hunter & Buckley, 1983) and for the terrestrial snail Monacha (1,177 days/2-3 years) (Staikou 8 Lazaridou-Dimitriadou, 1990). Otherwise, terrestrial snails seem to have short turnover times from 50.7 days (Vallonia, Russell-Hunter 8 Buckley, 1983) to 293 days/3 years (Helix lucorum, Staikou et al., 1988). However, the possibility of long turnover times in age-structured populations, especially in relation to interspecific compar- isons, must be treated with caution, because some average standing-crop values in the lit- erature are estimated from an entire popula- tion and others from a model cohort. Gener- ally, turnover times of more than two years appear to be associated with life spans of four years or more. The fact that H. pappi has long turnover times and a low productivity rate may be related to its small size, its long life span, and the fact that it is iteroparous. Published distribution data seem to sug- gest that H. pappi comprises a species with a patchy distribution (Schútt, 1962). Because of its evolutionary origin in colder climates (Ur- banski, 1960), this species manages barely to survive in this region of Greece, with wide daily and seasonal temperature variations. Actually, it is the climatic factors that play an important role in controlling energy flux in H. рарр!. Low rates and efficiencies of growth place severe restraints on the snail's ability to meet the demands of over-winter mainte- nance and reproduction. As a result, repro- duction is delayed until the second autumn. Energy investment is not concentrated on egg production, and there 1$ variation in rates of growth and fecundity according to age. Mor- tality takes place at all stages, but mainly after winter; high mortality after adverse periods of the year is a common characteristic of many helicid snails. Consequently, the demograph- ic characteristics of Helicella conform to an A-selectionist's strategy, as defined by Green- slade (1983); that is, suitable conditions for breeding last for only a short period but occur regularly and predictably, such that the pop- ulation synchronizes with those conditions (Figs. 1, 2). Moreover, interspecific competi- tion is rare, because only very small, sparse populations of Lindolhomia lens and Helix figulina were observed. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS | would like to thank Dr. E.

TO CALCIUM IN THEIR ENVIRONMENT Hilary Piggott & Georges Dussart Canterbury Christ Church College, Canterbury, Kent CT1 1QU, United Kingdom ABSTRACT In laboratory trials, specimens of the freshwater pulmonate snail Lymnaea peregra from Ullswater, a soft-water lake in the English Lake District (6.5 mg/l [Са?*], pH 7.1), showed a significant preference for laying eggs on clean, dead conspecific snail shells (y? = 38.91, Р < 0.001 n = 20), thereby confirming anecdotal field observations of this behaviour. A choice chamber was used to investigate to test the hypothesis that Iymnaeid snails might be able to use calcium as a cue for orientation, for example as a stimulus to find target shells for oviposition. Lymnaea stagnalis showed a more positive response to calcium than did L. peregra (t = 4.2, Р < 0.05, п = 137). When snails from soft-water environments were reared in soft water in the laboratory, specimens of L. peregra showed a strong preference for calcium (x? = 19.6, Р < 0.001, п = 202), but specimens reared in hard water (84 mg/l [Ca?*], п = 44)) showed no such preference. The hypothesis that snails could use a calcium cue to select a shell as an oviposition site was supported, and, in addition, the breadth of the chemical niche of L. peregra appears to be wider than that of L. stagnalis. Key words: egg-laying, calcium, preference, ecology, hardness, Lymnaea peregra, Lymnaea stagnalis. INTRODUCTION The importance of calcium in the distribu- tion of freshwater molluscs has been widely reported (Boycott, 1936; Macan, 1950; Okland, 1969; Williams, 1970; McKillop 8 Harrison, 1972). In his qualitative study of the ecology of freshwater molluscs in Britain, Boycott suggested that whereas some spe- cies were restricted to waters with calcium concentration exceeding 20mg/l, other spe- cies were more tolerant and could occur both in high calcium waters and elsewhere in low calcium waters, L. peregra being a typical ex- ample of such tolerance. Boycott (1936) also highlighted the difficulty of separating water chemistry from geographical distribution and physical characters of the habitats. In quan- titative studies of molluscan ecology in rela- tion to water chemistry, Dussart (1976) showed that general mollusc abundance was greater in hard waters ([Ca*] > 40 mg/l), al- though medium waters ([Са?*] 5-40 mg/l) had greater species diversity. As well as af- fecting distribution, calcium concentration also affects such aspects of freshwater mol- lusc biology as shell composition in planorbid snails (Madsen, 1987), freshwater sphaeriid clams (Burky et al., 1979), and the ampullariid 13 snail Marisa cornuarietis (L.) (Meier-Brook, 1978). Other evidence of a direct metabolic response to environmental calcium was demonstrated by Dussart & Kay (1980), who showed that L. peregra reared in waters of different hardness had different respiration rates. Dussart (1979) observed anecdotally that in some soft-water habitats, L. peregra ap- peared to show a preference for laying eggs on the shells of other L. peregra from the same generation, and it was proposed that this behaviour could possibly *'... provide an immediate source of nutrients to the off- spring after the post-egg laying deaths of the parent population.” These observations therefore raised questions about whether snails could behaviourally orientate to envi- ronmental calcium. Thomas (1982) observed that taxes of freshwater molluscs along inor- ganic ion gradients had been little studied. There is precedent for suggesting that fresh- water molluscs exhibit chemoreception, because, for example, the freshwater pulmo- nate Planobarius corneus (L.) can discrimi- nate between amino acids (Lombardo et al., 1991), and Thomas et al. (1980) observed species-specific responses to four amino acids. 14 PIGGOTT & DUSSART Lymnaea peregra 1$ probably the most common freshwater snail in Europe (Fitter 8 Manuel, 1986); it occurs in all types of habi- tats, including water with a calcium concen- tration as low as 1 mg/l. By contrast, L. stag- nalis is a calciphile species comprising larger individuals, often sympatric with L. peregra in harder waters. The objectives of the following experiments were therefore, firstly to investi- gate the hypothesis that soft-water snails might lay eggs preferentially on the shells of other individuals, secondly to investigate whether L. peregra and L. stagnalis might ori- entate to calcium in solution and thirdly, to identify any species-specific differences in such behaviour. MATERIALS AND METHODS Sources and Maintenance Conditions of Snails All samples were taken in June and July 1992, when L. peregra were obtained from the River Stour in Kent (OS ref. TR1785990, 84 mg/l [Са?*], pH 7.4) and L. stagnalis were collected from Monkton Nature Reserve (OS ref. TR657295, 72mg/l [Са?*], pH 7.5). Spec- imens of L. peregra were also collected from Ullswater, a soft-water lake in the Lake Dis- trict (OS ref. NY421205, 6.5 mg/l [Ca**], pH 7.1). In all the choice experiments, snails were young-mature specimens, of about 8-11 mm maximum length for L. peregra and 25-35 mm maximum length for L. stagnalis; because some of the snails came from the field, age could only be estimated. Other- wise, snails were four-six months old. Snails were housed in the laboratory in plastic tubs measuring 16 x 16 x 16 cm, each tub containing one litre of water and ten snails. Where snails from hard water were being cultured in hard water, water from the River Stour was used. The snails were main- tained at room temperature, with continuous aereation, in natural daylight and fed fresh lettuce every three days; ten millilitres of fil- tered pond water were added to each tub to provide additional micro-nutrients. A small quantity of washed, fine sand was provided in each tub to aid digestion, and the water was changed at three-day intervals. In the experiment to investigate substratum choice, two round, flint pebbles (10 mm diameter, the approximate size of an L. peregra shell), and two empty L. peregra shells were added to each tub. Each tub thus comprised a micro- cosm for which both the number of egg cap- sules and the area of the surface types upon which eggs were laid was recorded, includ- ing the submerged walls of the tub. Review of Choice-Chamber Designs for Aquatic Snails Various experimental designs have been employed to examine chemoreception in aquatic molluscs. For example, Uhazy et al. (1978) investigated chemicals attractant to Biomphalaria glabrata (Say) by using a grid of 10 x 5 units marked on a white enamel dish with test material at one end of the dish and control material at the other; Madsen (1992) used a similar design in food location exper- iments for Helisoma duryi (Wetherby) and Bi- omphalaria camerunensis (Boettger). Lom- bardo et al. (1990) used a ‘Y’ shaped maze to investigate Planorbarius corneus, whereas Thomas et al. (1980) used an olefactometer to investigate the response of B. glabrata to amino acids and related compounas. There are however, many problems asso- ciated with the design of such experiments; firstly, diffusion causes dynamic change in ionic concentrations, so that snails might be responding to an ionic flow, as opposed to absolute concentrations. Secondly, the ani- mals might become satiated as they move up the concentration gradient so that their be- haviour changes accordingly. Thirdly, there are problems of deciding when a choice has been made; for example, Lombardo et al. (1991) reported that a time limit was neces- sary due to the slowness and sometimes in- activity of the snails in their experiments. Fourthly, the distinction between olfaction and gustation is not clear in aquatic molluscs (Kohn, 1961). Fifthly, when a liquid medium rather than a solid object is the object of the choice, there are problems of experimental design because seiche phenomena can be entrained at the start of each trial. Given the nature of the animal, it is unlikely that any aquatic choice-chamber design will be wholly satisfactory for aquatic snails. To circumvent these problems, Vareille- Morel (1986) used a flowing water design in studies of the response of Potamopyrgus jenkinsi Smith to a nutrient source, and Dus- sart (1973) used a static chamber with a “starting box”; test specimens introduced into the starting box had an instant choice of waters when the starting gate was removed. RESPONSE OF LYMNAEA TO ENVIRONMENTAL CALCIUM 15 Central baffle Water flow os FIG. 1. Choice chamber used in the present study. Design of the Choice-Chamber Because L. stagnalis and L. peregra can be amphibious, the choice-chamber shown in Figure 1 was used, as it circumvents many of the problems described above. Preliminary dye experiments and water samples taken during the trials showed that there was no significant transfer of chemicals across the central divider; the latter was made of wood (ramin) because streaming was found to oc- cur when plastic dividers were used. Character of Water For all choice experiments, solutes were added to distilled de-ionised water to give the following standard water (mg/l): magne- sium, 15; sodium, 30; potassium, 7; ortho- phosphate, 15; calcium, 0; pH 7.5; (pH ad- justment with 2M НС). By contrast, the test hard water included 50 mg/l calcium. Methods of Testing Preferences Testing one species at a time, up to ten snails were placed on the divider, all facing the same way. They could then move to the left or right, or could remain on the divider. To prevent extraneous bias, the location of choice waters were systematically varied be- tween runs. Because Green et al. (1992) had shown significant anticlockwise-left move- ment of L. peregra when out of water, runs were repeated, with all the snails facing in the opposite direction. There were thus four ori- entations in each run and each run was re- peated, so that approximately 80 snails were involved in each trial. Similar numbers of snails were used by Madsen (1992) in food location experiments. After ten minutes, or sooner if all the snails had moved, the snails were removed from the choice chamber and the dividers cleaned; there was no contact between snails and no evidence of trail fol- lowing. y? tests with Yate's corrections were used to see if there was a significant choice and snails which stayed on the central divider were not included in the analysis. For the final investigation, L. peregra reared from eggs produced by Ullswater snails were used. Two batches of adult snails were separately main- tained in soft water (5 mg/l [Са?*]), and two batches were separately maintained in hard water (84 mg/l [Са?*]), both being kept for 1-3 weeks before the trials. RESULTS Oviposition Choice of L. peregra Besides the walls of the tub, the snails had only two pebbles and two shells upon which to lay, so that oviposition on these surfaces needed a significant positive choice. After correction of the data for available area, soft- water snails imported from Ullswater showed a significant bias towards laying eggs on shells, and this bias was greater for snails which, before the trials, had been kept in the laboratory in soft water (y? = 38.91, P < 0.001) compared with those kept in hard wa- ter (X? = 13.49, Р < 0.01). These results imply that L. peregra from soft water showed a preference for laying eggs on snail shells, particularly having been maintained in soft water. It is a statistical requirement of a chi- square test that no observed values should be less than five; because no eggs were laid on the pebbles, this requirement was not met, and the results should therefore be treated with caution; it is conceivable that eggs might never have been laid on a flint pebble. It should be noted that in other batch cultures however, eggs were intermittently laid on such pebbles. Choice Experiments A number of preliminary tests were con- ducted. Ten L. stagnalis were housed in soft water and used in the following preliminary experiments. When given a choice of sodium and calcium cations but with the same con- centrations of chloride anions, the null hy- pothesis could be refuted at P < 0.05, imply- ing that movement was significantly towards the source of calcium (Table 1-Trial (1). To determine whether this apparent bias was 16 PIGGOTT & DUSSART TABLE 1. Preliminary investigation of choice behaviour. For the purposes of this report, a trial is defined as an opportunity to make a choice by a single individual snail. Because some snails stayed on the central baffle for the duration of an experiment, the number of movements 15 frequently less than the number of trials. In experiments (i)-(iv), each of the ten snails was tested four times (i.e. four runs) in the four orientations, giving 160 trials.

Again, the null hypothesis could be refuted at P < 0.05, implying that the snails chose the sodium re- gime and aversion had not been a factor in Trial (i). In Trial (iii), there was again an apparent bias towards calcium, implying that the null hypothesis could be refuted at P < 0.01; this could represent an aversion to de-ionised water, possibly due to the effects of osmotic potential. Freshwater gastropods have body fluids that are hyper-osmotic to the external media and therefore have to cope with the continual influx of water. To establish whether the difference in osmotic pressure between the test substances was affecting the responses, in Trial (iv), snails were offered a choice between calcium and sodium but at concentrations that would each exert the same osmotic potential. The result provides evidence to refute the null hypothesis that there is no significant difference in the re- sponse of snails to different substances of the same osmotic pressure at P < 0.01; the snails apparently once again showed a sig- nificant bias towards the water containing calcium. Bias Towards.. Ne Significance [Ca?*] 15.4 Р < 0.001 To investigate whether there might be spe- cies-specific differences in these move- ments, 40 specimens each of L. stagnalis from Monkton and L. peregra from the Stour were maintained in hard and soft water for periods of one to three weeks before inves- tigation. The results of the main trials shown in Table 2 allow comparison between their behaviour. Trials (v) and (ix) were controls showing that when exposed to identical test substances, there was no significant bias in choice for either species. For Trials (vi) to (viii), L. stagnalis displayed a highly significant positive response to cal- cium, but in Trials (x) to (хи), L. peregra showed a lower response (Table 2). A Stu- dent's t-test of these data confirmed this dif- ference; across the three trials, the mean number of L. stagnalis choosing calcium was 42.17 with a comparable mean of 32.42 for L. peregra, thereby indicating that L. stagnalis were orientating more strongly than L. pere- gra (t = 4.33). The responses for both species towards calcium differed, depending on the length of time they had been maintained in hard or soft water before the experiment. For example, the y? value for L. stagnalis that had been kept in soft water for one week was 62.3, compared with 19.5 for snails that had RESPONSE OF LYMNAEA TO ENVIRONMENTAL CALCIUM АГ TABLE 2.

It is possible that the snails were orientat- ing to chloride rather than calcium. However, Trial (x) for L. peregra showed no significant preference between chloride and de-ionised water; and, in fact 34 snails compared with 26 snails actually migrated into the de- ionised water. There is always the possibility, however, that this experiment shows a bal- anced preference/aversion for both chloride and de-ionised water. For example, aversive behavioural and physiological responses to salinity are well documented (Perkins, 1974). The animals may have balanced their aver- sion to salinity with an aversion to the os- motic problems posed by deionised water, and consequently made по significant choice. Those L. peregra that had been raised in hard water showed no calcium preference (Table 3). By contrast, L. peregra raised in soft water showed a significant preference (X? = 8.2, Р < 0.01) for calcium. For example, over four runs, the mean number of snails that had been raised in hard water and chose calcium was 6.5, and the mean number of snails that had been raised in soft water and chose calcium was 8.75, the difference be- tween the means being significant at (t = 2:67). The molluscan shell is formed by the dep- osition of calcium carbonate on a protein ma- trix. For snails in a soft water environment, an immediate source of calcium could be ben- eficial to the developing juveniles and so there is an a priori reason for expecting snails to be able to detect and orientate towards calcium. The possible attractant properties of calcium were demonstrated here by the re- sults of Trial (i) on [. stagnalis. lt appeared that sodium chloride did not act as a repel- lant, because movements away from this compound were not significant in Trial (ii); Madsen (1990) found that such snails as H. duryi and Bulinus truncatus Audouin were not adversely affected by low concentrations of sodium chloride. However, there could have been a significant aversion to the de-ionised water in Trial (ii). Young (1975) reported that in soft water, L. peregra extracted 70% of the calcium re- quirement from lettuce and in hard water, ex- tracted only 46% from lettuce. This was compared with L. stagnalis, which, although it efficiently extracted 95% of the calcium content of the lettuce, usually only took 20% of the total requirement from this source, the remaining 80% being derived directly from the water. Thus, the relationships between environmental Базе-юп concentration and 18 PIGGOTT & DUSSART TABLE 3. Results for eight L. peregra reared in hard water and eight reared in soft water. The snails were tested when they had reached an overall shell length of 6-8 mm. Calcium was presented as 100 mg/l [Ca Cl,.2H,0]. Each specimen was tested twice in each of the four orientations, i.e. 64 trials. Choice Available Snails reared in soft water [Са?*] cf Movements 35 Snails reared in hard water [Ca?*] cf Movements 22 snail biology appear to be complicated. For example, ionic ratios might be involved; Har- rison et al. (1966) invoked the ratio of cal- cium/magnesium as a significant factor in egg production. There are also contrary re- sults; though Harrison et al. (1966) found a curvilinear relationship between egg produc- tion and calcium concentration for В+ omphalaria pfeifferi, Thomas et al. (1974) found a positive linear relationship for Bi- omphalaria glabrata. Nevertheless, it ap- peared that in our experiments, the need to respond to a source of environmental cal- cium was less for L. peregra than for L. stag- nalis, possibly because L. peregra obtains a smaller proportion of its calcium require- ments direct from the environment. This proposition 1$ supported by the results shown in Table 2: a gradually increasing re- sponse to a source of calcium by L. peregra, whereas the corresponding response of L. stagnalis was immediately highly significant. Even when kept, albeit temporarily, in hard water (84 mg/l [Са?*]), it seems that the cal- cium requirement of L. stagnalis was not be- ing met in these relatively small containers. Trials (v) to (xii) were designed to show species-specific differences in behaviour and were not particularly designed to distinguish between the effects of calcium, chloride or possible osmotic potential effects of de-ion- ised water. However, the results of trial (x) for L. peregra suggest that chloride and osmotic potential were not playing respectively at- tractive and aversive roles, because a major- ity of snails chose de-ionised water. There is also circumstantial evidence from Trials (i) to (iv) and from the literature to suggest that cal- cium 1$ a significant factor (e.g., Greenaway, 1971a, b). It is probable that ten L. stagnalis housed in one litre of pond water would re- duce the calcium concentration to such a level that a significant response to a source of calcium would be both essential for the H,0* H,0* Result Bias Towards.. x Significance 14 lea] 8.2 P < 0.01 22 neither 0 N.S snail and observable by the experimenter. For example, in our experiments, L. stagnalis showed a massive response to the source of calcium, having been in soft water for only one week. Out of 247 observed movements, 186 were towards the source of calcium; if osmotic potential were the only factor, it might be expected that the response would not have changed between trials. In addition, at this stage, the shells of L. stagnalis were becoming increasingly fragile. Nduku & Har- rison (1976) suggested that snails cultured in low calcium concentration are physiologi- cally stressed and cannot carry out normal metabolic processes. Bielefeld et al. (1993) have implicated alka- line phosphatase in the mantle epithelium as a factor in shell mineralisation, and Green- away (1971a, b) suggested that there was a net movement of calcium from the environ- ment into the blood, excess calcium being deposited as carbonate in the shell. When Greenaway cultivated snails in soft water, there was a loss of calcium from the blood to the external environment. To compensate, a reverse flow of calcium occurred from the shell to the blood. It is therefore likely that in the later stages of our experiments, L. stag- nalis were physiologically stressed. Given that the test snails of both species were of similar sizes, these results suggest that either L. stagnalis has a greater calcium demand than L. peregra, or that L. peregra has a higher threshold for the inception of calcium-mediated stress at lower concentra- tions than L. stagnalis. The implication is therefore that in terms of meeting calcium re- quirements, the niche breadth of L. peregra is wider than that of L. stagnalis. This hypothe- sis 15 supported by Costil-Fleury (1991), who used factor analysis to show that L. peregra is less confined in terms of habit type than L. stagnalis. However, many other physico-chemical RESPONSE OF LYMNAEA TO ENVIRONMENTAL CALCIUM 19 and biotic factors are as important as cal- cium. Temperature, pH, macro-vegetation, suspended solids and the nature of the allochthonous input to the habitat have all been suggested as crucial factors in mollus- can distribution (e.g., Macan, 1974; Okland, 1983; Pip, 1986), and Dussart (1979) showed that potassium, mud substratum-type and rock substratum-type were major variables in the distribution of Bithynia tentaculata (L.), Gyraulus albus (Müller) and Planorbis planor- bis (L.) respectively; magnesium was a major water chemistry variable for L. peregra. The results of the investigation using L. peregra reared in different environmental conditions tentatively support the suggestion of Dussart (1979) that in soft waters, snails might satisfy a metabolic need for calcium by orientating towards, and laying eggs on shells. There is anecdotal evidence that, es- pecially in areas of base-ion deficiency, aquatic snails will aggregate on shells, bones and other calcium sources; it would be useful to compare the calcium responses of snails originating from soft-water environments with snails of the same species from hard- water environments. If raised in identical con- ditions, any significant differences in re- sponses persisting in the F1 and succeeding generations would indicate the existence of physiological races and plasticity. This in turn might suggest that the process of speciation for water type is under way. The existence of a microhabitat at the sub- stratum surface of, say, a shell or a pebble needs to be recognised. Environmental cal- cium concentration in the microhabitat could be higher at interfaces due to mineralization by bacteria, algae or fungi. Consequently, a variety of factors could act as a cue for ovi- position on shells, examples being biofilms (auchwuss) on the shell surface, phero- mones, amino acids from the shell protein, or even physical contact with the shell as a sub- stratum rather than the calcium itself. In the experiments reported here, it is possible that the differing physico-chemical nature of the plastic, pebble and shell surface had facili- tated the development of biofilms that might have differentially encouraged egg deposi- tion on these surfaces; this possibility needs further investigation. Conversely, if an amino- acid attractant was leaking from the shell sur- face, it could be species-specific, because the concentration of amino acids within shells differs in different species of mollusc and with waters of different hardness (Dus- sart, 1973; 1983). Freshwater snails can show chemoreception in relation to amino acids exuded from a food source (Croll, 1983; Thomas et al., 1980), and the parent snails could be following an amino acid gra- dient to the target shell. In natural conditions, the amino acids could act as a primary stim- ulus and calcium could be secondary. The behavioural response to the amino acids in the shell of L. peregra could be examined by other choice-chamber experiments. How- ever, the possibility of synergism must be recognised; for example, Uhazy et al. (1978) noted a synergistic response of B. glabrata to the amino acids proline and glutamine. Despite the fact that Uhazy et al. (1978) found that B. glabrata would orientate to- wards magnesium but not calcium, our dem- onstration of species-specific differences has implications for control of snail vectors of helminth disease; for example, species within the Bulinus and Biomphalaria genera might show similar variability. As suggested by Thomas et al. (1980), Thomas (1982) and Lombardo et al. (1991), baiting techniques might be used to control helminth vectors, and knowledge of the role of calcium could be an important contributing factor. In conclusion, it seems from this study that there are differences in orientation behaviour that might be symptomatic of the calciphile distribution of L. stagnalis compared with the eurycalcic distribution of L. peregra. In the investigation of oviposition-site behaviour of L. peregra, the bias towards laying eggs on shells may have been due to such factors as leakage of calcium or amino acids from the shells, or mechanical quality of the shell sur- face. Both species might be able to orientate towards sources of calcium, though aversion to a low osmotic potential and attraction to chlorides are alternative, though less likely hypotheses. Also, there appears to be a dif- ference in response within a species when the animals are raised under different envi- ronmental conditions, suggesting that there may be the capacity for physiological plas- ticity within these metabolic requirements.

Luiz Ricardo Lopes de Simone Seçäo de Moluscos, Museu de Zoologia da Universidade de Sao Paulo, Caixa Postal 7172, CEP 01064-970, Sáo Paulo, SP, Brazil ABSTRACT Tonna galea and Tonna maculosa, from Brazilian region, are described anatomically. Each character is compared between the species and also with other known Tonnoidea. These species differ anatomically in characters of the mantle color and collar, osphradium, hypobran- chial gland, kidney, proboscis length, radular rachidian, lateral tooth, penis, vas deferens, and female genital opening. Characters of the anterior region of the digestive system, heart, penis and pallial oviduct are of particular interest in tonnoidean systematics. INTRODUCTION Tonna galea (Linné, 1758) is a very wide- ranging species, occurring in the Pacific and Atlantic oceans and in the Mediterranean Sea. Tonna maculosa (Dillwyn, 1817), in con- trast, only occurs in the tropical west Atlantic (Rios, 1985: 70; Matthews et al., 1987: 33). Tonna perdix (Linné, 1758), which is closely related to Т. maculosa, occurs in the Indo- Pacific region, and some authors consider them to be synonyms (e.g., Morretes, 1949). Two questions arise: (1) is “Топпа galea” а single species, and (2) are Т. maculosa and Т. perdix really separate species? These ques- tions have been discussed (e.g., Turner, 1948; Matthews et al., 1987), with arguments based on shell characters, but are still unre- solved. The objective of this paper is not to answer these questions, but to be a step in this di- rection, providing anatomical descriptions of specimens identified as Tonna galea and Т. maculosa from the Brazilian region. These data could be used in comparisons with sup- posed co-specific specimens from other ar- eas to assist in clarifying the systematic problems. Another objective of this paper is _ to contribute to the understanding of system- atic characters in the Tonoidea, identifying some useful characters not previously uti- lized in the systematics of this group. Little has been published on the anatomy of the Tonnoidea, and in particular the Ton- nidae. What has been has mainly concerned the alimentary canal and feeding habits. The 23 following information is available: Tonna galea: Weber (1927) studied the digestive system, and some of his data were repro- duced by Hyman (1967); Turner (1948) described the penis and figured the radula; Matthews et al. (1987) figured the penis, jaw and radular rachidian; and Bentivegna & Toscano (1991: 37) figured an active speci- men preying on Holothuria tubulosa and Н. sanctori. Tonna maculosa: Turner (1948) described the penis and figured the radula; and Matthews et al. (1978) figured jaw and radular rachidian. Other Tonnoidea de- scribed anatomically and used here for com- parision are: Reynell (1905) —description of a male Cassidaria rugosa (Linné) (Ranellidae); Day (1969) — digestive system of Argobuc- cinum argus (Gmelin) (Ranellidae); Houbrick 8 Fretter (1969) — digestive system and other organs of three species of Bursa (Bur- sidae) and four of Cymatium (Ranellidae); Lewis (1972) — anatomy of anterior region of digestive system, head-foot complex and pe- nis of Distorsio perdistorta Fulton (Ranell- idae); and Hughes 8 Hughes (1981) — diges- tive system of Cassis tuberosa (Linné), (Cassidae). MATERIAL AND METHODS The specimens studied belong to malaco- logical collection of the Museu de Zoologia, Universidade de Sáo Paulo (MZUSP). They are preserved in 70% ethanol. All specimens were dissected using stan- dard techniques. The buccal region, region of 24 SIMONE female genital opening and pallial oviduct were extracted, dehydrated in ethanol series, stained by carmine, cleared, and fixed with creosote. Radulae and jaws were examined on slides with Hoyer. All drawings were made using a camera lucida. Anatomical terminology is based on Rey- пе! (1905) and Hughes & Hughes (1981). Conchological description and synonymy are omitted, and can be found mainly in Mat- thews et al. (1987) and Turner (1948).
