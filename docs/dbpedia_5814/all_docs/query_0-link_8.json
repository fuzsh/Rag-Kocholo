        "text": "Category: News\n\nSaint-Gobain Cultilene and Growficient announce collaboration\n\nSubstrate manufacturer Saint-Gobain Cultilene and substrate sensor supplier Growficient are joining forces in a new partnership. By combining their expertise, the companies want to help growers optimise their production with as little water and nutrients as possible. The companies also align in their sustainability goals.\n\n“In crop production, there are lots of people involved who can tell instinctively by looking at a plant how it is doing. But facts and data are playing an ever greater role in making the right choices,” says Cultilene CEO Dennis Wertheimer: “Together with Growficient, we will provide our customers with data that gives even more insight into the substrate around the plant’s roots.” Looking ahead to the collaboration between the companies, he adds: “Cultilene’s strapline is ‘Where impact begins’. I have every confidence that we can make an even greater impact by working together.”\n\nStrengthening each other\n\nThe partnership may be new, but the relationship between Cultilene and Growficient goes back several years. Dirk Jan Mulder, co-founder of Growficient: “Over the years, both companies have developed their own products. Cultilene has introduced innovations in substrates, while we, as an independent supplier, have produced a wireless sensor that works on all substrates. Now the time has come to further strengthen each other.”\n\nThis creates a win-win situation, not only for Cultilene and Growficient, but above all for the grower. Dennis: “At Cultilene, we think it’s important to do more than just sell substrate: we aim to offer growers added value. We do this by providing advice on substrates, the root environment and all the other factors affecting the plant’s water balance. Growficient shares this vision and can use the data from the sensors to provide faster and more targeted advice. Together we work hand in hand with the grower.”\n\nInsight at a glance\n\nThe decision to collaborate follows a short period of trial runs. Remy Maat specialist in the field of substrate application at Cultilene was closely involved in these trials. He explains: “The first impression was immediately positive. What unquestionably adds value is the comprehensive ‘Growboard’, a dashboard that collects data from all your locations, providing insight into data from all the sensors at a glance. This includes water content, temperature, EC and slab dry-out. Another handy feature is the ability to integrate the data with any climate computer. The growers who tested it were instantly convinced and could start working with the data straight away.”\n\nThe sensors also offer advantages for Remy himself. He adds: “If a grower reports a problem with their plants, I can take a look at the dashboard straight away if necessary. Then I can get a quicker idea of what is going wrong and give irrigation advice remotely. The sensors also provide additional security for the grower by directly monitoring what is happening. With the changeable weather we have been having this spring, it is very important to be able to adjust your watering based on reliable data.”\n\nOptimising production\n\nBesides their mission to help growers optimise their production, Growficient and Cultilene have one more shared ambition: to make the sector more sustainable. Dennis: “Saint-Gobain aims to be completely carbon neutral by 2050. This requires innovations in all areas, including substrate. We are currently researching how to reuse stone wool, but we are also exploring other types of substrate, such as glass wool and wood substrate. The Growficient sensors also work very well in these, and the dashboard shows great results.”\n\nDirk Jan adds: “The data gives a precise picture of what is happening in the root environment and helps to optimise watering. On the one hand, this offers growers assurance, and on the other, it teaches us valuable lessons. By acquiring knowledge together, we can take the next step towards sustainable crop production.”\n\nDennis couldn’t agree more. He concludes: “In this area, too, our collaboration is the point ‘where impact begins’. I expect that by innovating together and listening to our customers’ needs, we will be able to make a positive difference.”\n\nTo find out more about the collaboration between Cultilene and Growficient, please contact:\n\nDirk Jan Mulder, General Manager of Growficient\n\nT: +31 (0)6 26 08 48 47 | dirkjan@growficient.com\n\nwww.growficient.com\n\nMariëlle Klijn, Marketing Manager of Saint-Gobain Cultilene\n\nT: +31 (0)6 23 05 03 28 | Marielle.Klijn@saint-gobain.com\n\nwww.cultilene.com\n\nJoin our full-year program ‘Follow a crop cycle’\n\nAs a grower, you’re doing the optimum best year-round to create the best circumstances for your plants. This means choosing the right substrate, creating the optimum climate, giving them the right amount of water, adding the necessary amount of minerals, preventing pests and diseases and collecting and analyzing data of the climate and crop. At the same time growers are also busy with labor, energy, the equipment, selling their products, alarms and all other things that are constantly going on. In other words, growers have constantly a lot “on their mind”.\n\nWithin Plant Empowerment we have a lot of knowledge. First of all we have the green book with the basic principles of Plant Empowerment. Secondly we have the additional knowledge and experience from all Plant Empowerment experts of our partners and members. Together we cover all ‘growing’ topics you are dealing with in practice. But how do you implement all this integrated knowledge in practice? To help you as a grower with this, Plant Empowerment is launching a full-year program “Follow a Crop Cycle” in Spring 2024. When you’re ready to start the new cropcycle, you know: you’re going on a learning journey with us.\n\nHow do you make sure the plants are constantly happy? That’s what you’re going to learn in our new course. At the end the goal of Plant Empowerment is to support growers to grow healthy and sustainable crops.\n\nWhat’s in it for you?\n\nThis year-long program is designed to empower you with practical insights into implementing Plant Empowerment principles. The goal is simple yet profound: to support you in growing healthy and sustainable crops. We’re not just offering a program; we’re building a community where growers from all over the world are coming together to share experiences, challenges, and triumphs. The program is built upon different themes in which we’ll discuss different crop cycles with all challenges and possibilities. Let’s give you an introduction:\n\nLight and irrigation – high wire crops (tomato, pepper and cucumber)\n\nWhat is the optimum irrigation and light input strategy at different seasons? What can we do if there is too much light and what is the influence of the crop stage on irrigation and optimal light levels? And finally, how are the properties of substrates influencing the irrigation strategy? In this theme you’ll get the answers. We are going to follow multiple high wire crops, especially tomato, pepper and cucumber.\n\nPlant Health- potting plants\n\nDelve into the intricate world of growth factors impacting plant health. And let’s be honest, almost all growth factors are having an effect on plant health. While focusing on potting plants, our tips and tricks are universally applicable across various crops. This means we will talk about substrate properties, microbial inoculants, biostimulants, impact of (an)organic fertilizers and plant activity. And although the subject is still under construction, we will even talk about some options to measure plant health. Because we have some knowledge and experience with this.\n\nData-driven growing – lettuce\n\nCan we grow a crop without data? And how do you make a good crop plan and transfer the plan into numbers? Explore the important role of data in crop cycles. Let lettuce guide you through the lessons applicable to numerous crops. During the year we will constantly compare actual data with the plan. Finally we will discuss multiple sensors that can be used to collect good and reliable numbers. Since the crop cycle of lettuce is short, a lot of lessons are already learned here and this makes lettuce the perfect example crop.\n\nClimate and plant activity – strawberry\n\nClimate and plant activity are always connected. But recent studies have taught us that optimal climate, supporting optimal photosynthesis, doesn’t always mean maximum activity. What is the optimum climate for a plant? What is the optimum amount of activity to support maximum production. And how to realize this optimum plant activity? A lot of questions are discussed throughout the year with strawberries as an example crop. And since strawberries are the example crop here, we will also make the link between active climate above the ground and water management in an organic substrate below the ground.\n\nPollination – tomato & strawberry\n\nWith our buzzing friends in the main role you’ll understand the critical role of pollination across crops. Delve into the impact of greenhouse conditions on bumblebee performance. We’ll explore humidity, light levels and spectra and temperature to optimize their work environment. And as you would probably expect, tomato and strawberry are our focus crops in this theme. Let’s get this buzzy year started.\n\nWhat’s the year program about?\n\nHow beautiful is it if we can create an open world where you can exchange all your ideas and challenges with like-minded growers worldwide, during your cropcycle? With our groundbreaking year program ‘Follow a Crop Cycle’, launching in Spring 2024, you’ll learn everything about your cropcycle in a sustainable and profitable way.\n\nThis year-long program Follow a cropcycle is designed to empower you with practical insights into implementing Plant Empowerment principles.

The new software takes the properties of substrates into a process computer for the first time, enabling just-in-time supply of natural resources and ensuring sustainable crop production.\n\nThe proliferation of new technologies such as sensors, ventilation units and new types of screens entering the growing environment can change the energy balance in the crop. One of the biggest changes currently affecting growers is the switch from HPS artificial lighting to LED lighting. Plants receive 40 percent more heat from HPS lighting than from LED. As plants transpire less under LED, they take up less water and nutrients.\n\nRecognising how even one such change can impact on all the others, Hoogendoorn and Cultilene have together developed a tool that will better support growers by providing a rapid overview of evapotranspiration levels in the crop and calculating water and nutrient levels to reflect these changes.\n\nFollowing the principles of Plant Empowerment, Connected Irrigation delivers customised irrigation by taking the properties of Cultilene’s high-quality substrates and its advisory values on the pF curve, substrate volume and dry-back time into the process computer. The software reduces water, nutrient and energy use, while preventing plant stress and benefiting the root environment.\n\nRemy Maat, Manager Application at Cultilene: “By combining our substrate expertise with Hoogendoorn’s outstanding process automation technology we have produced a unique evapotranspiration-based irrigation software application that will benefit growers worldwide. Its ability to improve water use efficiency will lead to healthier, more resilient root systems and therefore better quality plants, responding to the need to grow more healthy food while using less natural resources. I encourage you all to learn more about Irrigation for Success: evaporative energy as a solution by attending our inspiring presentation on this topic on the vision stage at GreenTech Amsterdam on Wednesday 14 June at 13:45 – 14:30.”\n\nMartin Helmich, CCO at Hoogendoorn Growth Management: “Collaboration between supply chain partners is essential to feed a growing world population in a sustainable way. Hoogendoorn’s long track record in process automation solutions and Cultilene’s expertise in smart water and root zone management combine the best of both worlds for the grower, enabling them to get the most out of their crop and achieve more sustainable production.”\n\nFrom left to right: Dennis Wertheimer, Managing Director Saint-Gobain Cultilene, Claudia van Groesen, Marketing Manager at Saint-Gobain Cultilene, Angela Luijten, Projectmanager International Business & Strategy at Hoogendoorn Growth Management, Remy Maat, Manager Application at Saint-Gobain Cultilene & Rene Beerkens, Senior Data Driven Growing Specialist at Hoogendoorn Growth Management.\n\n‘More rail transport to reduce carbon footprint’\n\nCultilene co-initiator of new rail connection between Brabant and Czech Republic\n\nDoing business sustainably – that’s what we at Cultilene stand for. And that’s why we want to start shipping the base material for our stone wool cubes and slabs by rail instead of by road – cutting our CO2 emissions by no less than two thirds! The challenge now is to set up a cost-effective rail connection between Brabant and our factory in the Czech Republic.\n\nSaint-Gobain and Cultilene set the bar high when it comes to sustainability: our goal is to produce CO2 neutrally by 2050. This calls for action. “We are trying to reduce our CO2 emissions in all kinds of ways,” says Patrick Pennings, manager physical distribution and procurement at Cultilene. “Road transport currently still accounts for a substantial part of these emissions. Large numbers of trucks drive backwards and forwards between our factory in the Czech Republic and our production site in Tilburg, for example. We make large stone wool boards – the base material we use for our cubes and slabs – in this Eastern European country. They are then turned into finished product in Tilburg.”\n\nSetting up a rail connection\n\nAccording to Patrick, shipping by road generates three times more CO2 emissions than shipping by rail. Early last year he therefore decided to look into the possibility of switching partly to rail transport in the future. “It sounds easier than it is. You see, there is currently no rail connection between Brabant and the Czech Republic. And for such a connection to be cost-effective, you need to be able to run a full train several times a week. As Cultilene we can’t do that on our own; we need to get other partners on board.”\n\nSo Patrick contacted Logistics Community Brabant, a non-profit organisation for innovation in transport. “Under the banner of Top Sector Logistics’ national Joint Corridors Off-road action programme, they have set up a project to create a train connection between Tilburg and the Czech Republic.”\n\nKeeping the planet liveable\n\nThe project has already caught the attention of a number of other companies looking to have goods shipped between Brabant and the Czech Republic by rail. “We hope to get enough volume together to be able to set up a connection. Maybe this year, otherwise next year. This will enable us to significantly reduce our carbon footprint and help keep our planet liveable. Rail transport is definitely the future, and without question for shipping goods between the Saint-Gobain factories in Europe.”\n\nMore sustainable on the road\n\nBesides making rail transport more sustainable, we also want to do the same for our road transport. “In the shorter term, that will involve using more sustainable fuels and training drivers to drive more economically, for example,” says Patrick. “In the longer term, we will also start using electric trucks. So we will be making a difference that way too – after all, the impact we make starts with ourselves. This is one way we can really put Cultilene’s slogan – ‘Where impact begins’ – into practice!”\n\n‘To achieve a top result, your foundation must be rock solid’\n\nRuud van Gils, Commercial Manager, Saint-Gobain Cultilene:\n\nWhatever foundation we are talking about, it forms the basis of everything we build, manufacture or produce. And it’s no different for plants, which form the basis for the fruits you can harvest as a grower.\n\nBut what forms the basis for a good, strong plant? The substrate! Because the right substrate plays a key role in effective seed germination – the moment ‘where impact begins’. The substrate is a success factor in the process by which a small, fragile plant grows into a strong, resilient plant. Good control is crucial for ensuring the plant continues to grow sustainably. With the right strategy for managing the water and root environment, you will optimise your crop and achieve a top result.\n\nIn short: the substrate can make all the difference in your cultivation. So as a grower it’s important to choose a good substrate that suits your crop and your business situation. That way you’ll create a great basis – the best foundation for a successful return on your crop!\n\nTomatoes with a ‘wow’ factor thanks to a finely tuned irrigation strategy\n\nSaint-Gobain Cultilene has been involved in a project to implement the Plant Empowerment principles at Tomatoworld since 2020. After an exploratory first season, the second year of the project is characterized by much more stability and predictability. “Now that I’ve got more regularity in the irrigation strategy and more control over the substrate this year, I’m sure the plants will be even stronger and healthier than last season,” says Ab van Marrewijk from Tomatoworld.\n\nAb van Marrewijk manages Tomatoworld’s 1,200m2 show greenhouse in the Netherlands, where a total of 40 different tomato varieties from five different seed companies are grown for demonstration, education and research purposes. “It’s my duty to get the very best out of the plants for those companies. The aim is to grow beautiful and high-quality tomatoes with a real ‘wow’ factor,” he states.\n\nVan Marrewijk has been involved in the horticultural industry for several decades and has closely followed the developments around data-driven growing and the Plant Empowerment philosophy. “The focus on optimizing the plant’s natural balances by using data in combination with the laws of physics and plant physiology really appeals to my own way of thinking. When we got a new Hoogendoorn IIVO climate computer in early 2021, I realized that we now had all the necessary information at our fingertips. We were halfway through an existing crop cycle at that time, but I was so keen to explore the effects of Plant Empowerment that I decided to put the principles into practice right away,” he continues. So Tomatoworld installed sensors to measure the EC level inside the slabs and the drain as the basis for gathering and analyzing the irrigation data using the LetsGrow.com platform.\n\nThe importance of a good start\n\nVan Marrewijk explains that the substrate is particularly important, because the roots provide the foundation for the plant’s performance throughout the season. “I’ve known Saint-Gobain Cultilene for many years, since the early 1980s, and regard them as a very reliable supplier of dependable and well-tested products. Their substrates do exactly what you want as a grower. The roots are a plant’s production hub, but you don’t get good roots automatically. At Saint-Gobain Cultilene they really emphasized the importance of allowing time at the beginning for the plant and the substrate to ‘connect’ so that the roots become optimally distributed throughout the entire slab,” he says. “Therefore, together with Remy Maat, Application Manager at Saint-Gobain Cultilene, I spent the first six to eight weeks of the cycle focusing on giving just enough water to stimulate the connection, and then allowing the plant to build its own ‘factory’. Our aim was to achieve 50% dry-back, but by no more than 2% per day. Although it may feel unnatural for many growers to ‘do nothing’ after the initial watering, this gradual approach really works!”\n\nInsights into the substrate\n\nThe watering strategy remains critical after the roots are established, but finding the right strategy is tricky for Van Marrewijk because he has so many different varieties in his relatively small greenhouse. “Some varieties need much more water than others, and the requirement of plants within the same variety can vary depending on their location in the greenhouse and how much sunlight they get throughout the day. I know from experience that a tomato plant can be ruined if I allow it to get too dry just once; even if I water it again afterwards, it’s too late to be rescued. That’s why I always keep a close eye on whether the plants are receiving enough water.” Needless to say, Van Marrewijk was excited to have access to all the sensor data in the first year of the Plant Empowerment project. “Thanks to being able to see precisely what’s happening in the substrate, I could work more precisely in terms of what time I started watering and how long I carried on for. For example, based on measuring the drain, I found out that some plants had got 3.2 liters in the past 24 hours and other plants had got nothing at all! To compensate for this, I tended to water the plants a bit more at the start of the day and then give them a little bit more at the end of the day, depending on what the data told me,” he recalls.\n\nDefining the irrigation strategy in advance\n\nThe project is now in its second year. “One of the biggest differences compared to last year is that I discussed and agreed on the irrigation strategy together with Saint-Gobain Cultilene before the new season got underway in January 2022,” says Van Marrewijk. “So this time, based on analysis of the data from last year, we’ve proactively aligned the watering strategy with the slab type right from the start rather than reactively making decisions throughout the season in response to the real-time data. Needless to say, I’m still able to adjust the irrigation if necessary, but now it’s more a case of fine-tuning things based on what we’ve learned rather than making any major changes.” As a result, the watering is spread more evenly throughout the day in terms of both dose size and regularity, and then the plants are allowed to dry back from the end of the day until the next morning.\n\nAnother thing that has been altered this year is the number of drain holes in the substrate. Van Marrewijk: “Last year, we noticed that the EC tended to be a little higher in the corners of the slab. During our discussions with Saint-Gobain Cultilene before the season started, we decided to see if we could solve this by increasing from one drain hole in the middle of the slab to three or six evenly spread drain holes. This has made it easier to increase or reduce the EC as needed, creates more uniformity in the drain and just generally gives us better control over the slab.”\n\nStronger plants all season long\n\nAccording to Van Marrewijk, the Plant Empowerment principles make the plants stronger and robust enough to last all season long, which is especially important at Tomatoworld: “This season started on 20 January and will continue until the end of November. In fact, last year, some companies asked me to extend the season until 10 December. Towards the end of the season, it becomes even more critical to avoid over-watering because you want to keep enough oxygen in the substrate, which is full of roots by then. Now that I’ve got more regularity in the irrigation strategy and more control over the substrate, I’m sure the plants will be even stronger than last season, so they will still look fantastic in December if necessary.”\n\nCombining experience to achieve a better product\n\nAs part of the Plant Empowerment project, the irrigation strategy is viewed in the wider context of all the plant balances and Saint-Gobain Cultilene works in conjunction with the other Sustainable Integrated Growing Solutions (SIGS) partners as part of a multidisciplinary team. “Remy visits us frequently, often with other SIGS partners. We’re like one big family who get together regularly to discuss ideas, provide advice and share details of our own research findings. It’s about combining our experience to achieve a better product together,” states Van Marrewijk. “Now that we have strong roots and ever-more data at our fingertips, we’re looking forward to implementing the other Plant Empowerment principles – such as screening, ventilation and lighting – to get even more out of our tomato plants, without pushing them past their limits of course. That will be a great result for us – but based on what we’ve seen here, I firmly believe that the Plant Empowerment philosophy can help growers everywhere to optimize production levels in combination with fewer inputs. Therefore, on a much larger scale, our industry as a whole has a real chance to contribute to tackling global challenges such as climate change and feeding the growing population,” he concludes.\n\n‘Where impact begins’\n\nA new message and a new style – perfectly reflecting the identity of Saint-Gobain Cultilene. We chose GreenTech in Amsterdam as the platform to launch this new chapter: our conviction that good substrate is an essential basis for maximising crop yields and that Cultilene is your guarantee of that basis. Hence our new slogan, ‘Where impact begins’. We look back on a successful GreenTech, where we toasted to an impactful future together with our partners and customers.\n\nIn greenhouse horticulture, substrate is often seen as a commodity. But that’s plain wrong. After all, good substrate is crucial for getting plants off to a good start. At germination time, when plants are particularly vulnerable, you need your substrate to create the best possible environment. It should also provide robust conditions for growth and production. That’s what we are expressing with our new slogan, ‘Where impact begins’. The quality of Cultilene substrates plays a key role in a successful crop.\n\nBlue cocktails\n\nImpact is something we not only create with our product but also with our people. Working together makes an impact. The many conversations we had at GreenTech once again confirmed that Cultilene really is all about cooperation. Approachable, enthusiastic and knowledgeable on the subject of smart water and root environment management – that’s how our customers and cooperation partners see our people. We became more aware of this than ever as we worked on defining our identity. And that’s what we heard at GreenTech too. We drank a toast with Cultilene blue cocktails together with our customers and partners!\n\nCatch up with all the fun\n\nWe are proud of our new branding, which shows what drives Cultilene and who we are. If you missed the launch or would like to watch it again, check out the aftermovie .\n\nWhat we can do for you\n\nOur new branding makes our focus and ambition manifestly clear.

We look forward to hearing from you!\n\nNew online course: Save energy in an integrated way\n\nThe Plant Empowerment principles have been proven to enable growers to cultivate crops in high-tech greenhouses more profitably and more sustainably, not least thanks to helping them to reduce their energy consumption. Due to the current situation on the energy market, a multidisciplinary team of Plant Empowerment implementation partners are holding a series of online training sessions to share the energy-saving knowledge they have gained during real-life projects. Join us for the new four-part online Plant Empowerment course “Tips and tricks for surviving the energy crisis”.\n\nThis online training course will start on Wednesday 19 October (16:00-17:30h CET), followed by a new session every two weeks until 30 November. Each session will focus on how an integrated approach can reduce energy consumption, while also contributing to healthier and more resilient crops. During this course, given by the Plant Empowerment specialists, we will focus on how to save energy when growing healthy and resilient crops in an integrated way. Register here for the full course. Sign up before October 18th to take advantage of the pre-sale period and secure your place for just €39 per session or €129 for all four sessions. After each session, participants will receive a recorded version to watch at their own convenience.\n\nReduce energy consumption while improving crop quality\n\nThe current record-breaking energy prices are having a major impact on high-tech horticulture. Many growers will need to make considerable energy savings in order for their business to survive the coming winter. This cost pressure is causing companies to look for creative solutions. Some growers have decided to leave their greenhouses empty this season, while others are reducing the amount of artificial lighting they provide to their crops, or leaving the lights off altogether.\n\nThe Plant Empowerment principles have been helping growers to take an integrated approach to cultivation for several years now. This data-driven growing method, which is focused on aligning all the crop balances, leads to higher yields and better quality while also ensuring that inputs such as water, nutrients and – especially important in the current times – energy are used more efficiently.\n\nThe success of this integrated approach has been demonstrated in various real-life projects worldwide by a multidisciplinary team of Plant Empowerment implementation partners. They have gained valuable insights into how screening and air movement can help to optimize the climate, for example, and how artificial lighting can contribute to a healthier root zone. In some cases, energy savings of up to 30% have been achieved.\n\nAbout the program\n\nThe specialists will provide new insights relating to the benefits of the Plant Empowerment philosophy in the following online sessions:\n\nHow energy affects climate and plants (19 October)\n\nHow to reduce your energy inputs using screening and air movement (2 November)\n\nHow to get the most out of your artificial lighting (16 November)\n\nHow reduced energy inputs affect your irrigation strategy (30 November)\n\nSign up before October 18th to take advantage of the pre-sale period and secure your place for just €39 per session or €129 for all four sessions.\n\nAre you interested in joining this two-day workshop or do you want more information?

Cultilene’s new slogan is “Where impact begins”. The company creates impact for the customer through product development, including alternatives to stone wool, innovative production processes and a committed team of experts.\n\n“Providing the world with as much good, safe food as possible with minimal use of water, energy and non-renewable raw materials is one of the greatest challenges for the horticulture sector worldwide,” says Cultilene Managing Director Dennis Wertheimer. “Meeting this challenge starts with the right basis for the plants that provide our food. We supply that basis. With our substrate products we provide the best possible root environment and open up the full potential of plants. The water droplet in our new logo symbolises our drive to achieve a perfectly managed root climate and inspire sustainable, reliable plant cultivation.”\n\nInnovations with impact\n\n“As a leading company in the global substrate industry for greenhouse horticulture and as part of the multinational Saint-Gobain, Cultilene operates in an environment that challenges us to go the extra mile to innovate,” says Ralf Derksen, innovation manager at Cultilene. Among the sustainable innovations developed by Cultilene are circular substrates based on materials such as wood and glass. These new products combine an optimal growing climate – comparable to stone wool – with high recyclability. They are now in the final development phase: testing in practice.\n\nStrong partnerships\n\n“To achieve our ambitions, we believe in strong partnerships. Partners who – like us – are willing to try harder because they are happy to be challenged,” Dennis Wertheimer says. Cultilene seeks this connection with growers, research institutes and other companies in the industry. In Plant Empowerment, for example, it is collaborating on a data-driven growth strategy for sustainable and productive plants in balance. As part of Saint-Gobain, Cultilene has easy access to research stations that focus on sustainable material use and meeting global climate goals. Saint-Gobain has set itself ambitious sustainability goals: 20% lower CO2 emissions by 2025, 33% lower by 2030 and CO2 neutral by 2050. In addition, it has committed to reducing unrecycled waste by 50% by 2025, by 80% by 2030 and using 100% recycled packaging by 2050.\n\nMeet the team at GreenTech\n\nWould you like to find out how the Cultilene team can turn reliable, sustainable substrate technology into solutions for your company? Then come along to stand 05.315 at GreenTech at RAI Amsterdam from 14-16 June. Or sign up for one of the breakfast sessions we will be running together with our knowledge partners.\n\nFrans Goud (The Netherlands)\n\n“Fine-tuning your irrigation strategy based on data produces impressive results”\n\nAs a highly innovative company, BASF Vegetable Seeds is keen to explore how automation can benefit all areas of its operations. Since 2019, the company has been applying data-driven growing and the Plant Empowerment principles in a tomato greenhouse at one of its facilities in the Dutch town of ’s-Gravenzande. The aim is to balance the key inputs in order to optimize plant health and maximize production. Frans Goud, a crop technician at BASF, explains how his partnership with stonewool specialist Saint-Gobain Cultilene to fine-tune the irrigation strategy has produced eye-opening results.\n\nAt BASF Vegetable Seeds they are very open to the idea of autonomous growing and the use of data to optimize results, according to Frans Goud. “People are subjective and tend to make decisions based on their gut instinct. But even experienced growers can misinterpret a situation. Data enables you to make objective decisions and reduces the chance of mistakes. Besides that, automatic controls help to stabilize the production and give you greater peace of mind, while automation reduces the amount of manual work and frees up more time for a grower to spend on other things,” he says. “If we can use automation to make the production process as predictable as possible, as an extra service to our clients we can supply all our seed varieties with precise instructions for how to get the best out of that particular variety. We already do that for lettuces, and we’re now keen to do the same for tomatoes.” Therefore, in 2019, BASF started a two-year greenhouse trial to grow its main tomato variety, Provine, on 500m2 in line with the Plant Empowerment principles.\n\nTo overcome a couple of technical issues in the first year, the team decided to install a new hybrid lighting system of 65% LEDs and 35% HPS from Hortilux for the second year – and the switch to hybrid lighting called for a different approach to the irrigation strategy. “We were very happy with the substrate products we were using from stonewool specialist Saint-Gobain Cultilene: OptimaXX slabs and RootmaXX cubes. To collect all the data, we installed ten sensors, which is quite a lot for just 500m2, but this gives us very good averages of all the values,” explains Goud. “And besides supplying the substrate, Saint-Gobain Cultilene also provided a lot of support and advice on how we could get the best out of the substrates by looking at the climate as a whole, especially in view of the new lighting system. The most eye-opening advice was to how to treat the substrates at the beginning of the season to get the plants off to a more generative start. After all, to maximize the kilos, you need to produce fruits, not leaves!”\n\nRemy Maat, Application Manager at Saint-Gobain Cultilene, helped Goud to focus on achieving the right amount of dryback in the slab at the beginning. “He suggested to go for 30% dryback in the slab in the first couple of weeks of the season to encourage the roots to search for the available water, whereas I would have been inclined to stop at 20%. So I tried it, and he was right; this approach resulted in a very even spread of the roots throughout the entire substrate,” recalls Goud. “What I particularly like about the Saint-Gobain Cultilene products is that they don’t seem to have layers, like substrates from some other suppliers do, so the entire volume of stonewool is optimally utilized from top to bottom, all season long. As a result, the pH and EC remain very stable.”\n\nOnce the second season was underway, Maat also advised Goud on the ideal frequency and duration of waterings in combination with the lighting strategy. “In the second year, we used the lights at 300µmol HPS for 18 hours a day. Rather than starting at around midnight, we started a couple of hours later to minimize the number of hours that the bumblebees would be exposed to artificial light only. Around two hours after turning the lights on, we initiated dryback until we reached 9-10%. Then we started watering generously and frequently in order to achieve drain after around three hours,” he explains. “But another thing I learned from Saint-Gobain Cultilene was to interrupt the watering an hour before sunrise until an hour after sunrise. At the start of the day, something happens in the natural light spectrum that activates the root pressure, so there’s a higher risk of giving too much water. This can make the plant too vegetative, causing the fruits to split and reducing the flower quality.”\n\nThe hybrid lighting system and data-driven approach also meant that BASF worked with a different irrigation strategy at the end of the day. “Without artificial lighting, we would normally stop watering two or three hours before sunset. Now, we could use the data to see how much water the plant needed, when to stop, and if any extra waterings were needed in order to achieve at least 10-15% dryback overnight. This is important in order to keep sufficient oxygen in the substrate,” continues Goud.\n\nStrong and healthy roots\n\nAll the sensors enabled Goud to monitor the plants’ need for water and also to anticipate the likelihood of water stress. “It gets harder for the plant to transport water to the head towards the end of the season and the roots struggle to keep up when evaporation is high. Late last summer, for example, our plants were around 16m tall with an average of 46 trusses per plant! The data gave us good insight into the conditions and helped us to continue to provide sufficient water on time to minimize water stress,” he comments. “Besides the productive nature of the plants, another sign of their strong and healthy roots is that we had hardly any issues with mildew or whitefly throughout the season.”\n\nNew trial with cherry tomatoes\n\nBASF’s aim in the second year of the Provine trial was to achieve a minimum of 100kg/m2. “That would be a realistic production level based on the manual technique, so we wanted to at least match this by following the Plant Empowerment principles,” says Goud. “During the cycle, we realized that we were well on track to achieve that, and by the end of August 2021 we discovered that we’d produced 121kg/m2 – so over 20% more than expected.” Based on the success of this project and the lessons learned, BASF is now fine-tuning its approach in a similar trial with cherry tomatoes, which started in October 2021. “In the case of cherry tomatoes, what matters most is the taste – that’s what people are prepared to pay for,” he states. “The flavour is dictated by the Brix value and this requires a higher EC, but working with a very high EC can reduce your annual production level by as much as 6kg/m2. So we’re keen to see how focusing on the data will enable us to push the production level to the max while achieving the desired flavour.”\n\nOptimal partnership\n\nBesides receiving irrigation-related support from Saint-Gobain Cultilene and working with Hortilux on the lighting system, Goud also has regular contact with other Plant Empowerment Implementation partners – namely Hoogendoorn Growth Management for greenhouse climate control, Koppert Biological Systems for nutrition, pollination and pest management, the LetsGrow data platform and Ludvig Svensson for the screening strategy. He describes it as an optimal partnership: “We exchange opinions, make suggestions, discuss ideas and challenge each other’s standpoints based on an atmosphere of trust and respect for each other’s specific area of expertise. Ultimately, we all share the same goal – pushing the boundaries without losing sight of what’s best for the plant. And we all agree that it’s OK to make mistakes, as long as we learn something useful from them.”\n\nFor the full 100%\n\n“Above all, what I learned from last season is that steering your irrigation strategy in line with the temperature and evaporation data enables you to avoid giving too much water unnecessarily. Besides improving production, this also has numerous efficiency benefits in terms of reducing your water consumption, energy consumption and waste of fertilizers, for example,” says Goud. “People are often sceptical about new ideas and may be afraid of taking risks in a commercial operation. I regularly hear that growers are doing 90% of what is suggested in the Plant Empowerment book – but it’s often that final 10% that will make all the difference. In our small-scale trials, I’ve had the freedom to try things out in a real-life setup and I’ve been impressed by the results. So I hope that this will give other growers the confidence to go for the full 100%, even if it goes against their own instincts,” he concludes.\n\nParticipate one of the live Plant Empowerment workshops in Canada in May 2022\n\nPlant Empowerment, in cooperation with the Dutch diplomatic network in Canada, is organising two live workshops in Canada in May 2022. The first workshop will take place on Monday May 16 and Tuesday May 17 in British Columbia. The second workshop will be organised in Leamington and will take place on Thursday 19 and Friday 20 May 2022. Growers and other horticultural professionals are welcome to join the workshop, which is focused on sharing knowledge on the philosophy and share how to put this knowledge in practice. A team of six Plant Empowerment specialists will address insights on various facets such as climate, plant balances, lighting, nutrition, plant health, pest management.\n\nPlant Empowerment\n\nThe Plant Empowerment philosophy helps growers worldwide to grow more sustainably and achieve higher yields. It takes the natural behaviour and the growing power of plants as its starting point. The principles revolve around cultivating greenhouse crops sustainably by supporting each plant’s natural balances. This unique data-driven way of thinking facilitates higher yields and better crop quality for growers, while also supporting more efficient use of valuable resources such as water, energy and nutrients. As a result, the Plant Empowerment philosophy provides a roadmap to both profitable and environmentally friendly horticulture.\n\nIn December 2021 Plant Empowerment, its partners and the Dutch diplomatic network in Canada organized an online workshop for Canadian growers, investors and other horticulture professionals. A total of approximately 200 horticulture professionals participated. The positive feedback and demand for a live event was overwhelming. Therefore, the organisers decided to hold a two-day event in the two major horticultural regions in Canada.\n\nTraining content & set-up program\n\nDuring the workshop the basic principles of Plant Empowerment are further explained. There will be combination of theoretical and practical sessions, alternately led by the Plant Empowerment partners and co-author (Peter van Weel) of the book on Plant Empowerment. New insights around the Plant Empowerment theory are shared in the areas of climate, plant balances, lighting, nutrition, plant health, pest management etc.\n\nPractical examples will be discussed in detail, for example the approach of the BASF project, where the implementation team achieved 121 kg. Furthermore, growers from both Canada and North America who currently apply the Plant Empowerment principles explain their strategies and approaches in collaboration with the consultants of partners.\n\nAre you interested in joining this two-day workshop or do you want more information?

With the support of the multidisciplinary team, the crop production strategy has now been put into practice, achieving a total yield of 121 kg per m2.\n\nBASF Vegetable Seeds focuses on what the company calls ‘integrated breeding’ – combining the knowledge of plant breeders with state-of-the-art technology and emerging science. The company’s goal is not just to sell seeds, but to provide its customers and the entire chain with innovation, expert advice and knowledge, reliable varieties, profitable concepts and sustainable solutions. Together with Hoogendoorn Growth Management, one of the Plant Empowerment Implementation Partners, they previously conducted a trial with hydroponic lettuce at our Nunhems location in ‘s-Gravenzande, the Netherlands, based on autonomous and data-driven growing. The results were so impressive that they decided to try it for tomatoes as well. That’s where the other Plant Empowerment Implementation Partners came in. So in October 2019, BASF and all the partners set up a GPE trial on about 500m2.”\n\nIn the first year of this project, which started in August 2019, the seed company focused mainly on building its dataset on crop performance as a basis for decision-making. In the 2020/2021 season, BASF tested the Plant Empowerment principles in practice using the Provine truss tomato variety. At the end of that season, analysis of production data showed that the strategy had produced a total yield of 121 kg per m2, which is almost 40% higher than normal.\n\nThe Plant Empowerment Implementation Partners recently helped BASF get the 2021/2022 season started. This time, the Plant Empowerment philosophy is being tested on a different variety: truss cherry tomato Adorion. BASF plans to use all the data to develop a reproducible growing strategy that it can offer to every customer who buys Adorion seeds. This will enable those growers to get the best out of this variety – and hopefully other varieties in the future.\n\nWatch the video\n\nWorking together for an optimal water balance and resilient crops\n\nSaint-Gobain Cultilene and Hoogendoorn Growth Management take steps in data-driven growing in GPE\n\nHoogendoorn Growth Management is well known for its automation solutions for greenhouses and, in particular, its climate computers. But these computers not only control the greenhouse climate, they also manage the irrigation. Within the Plant Empowerment concept, Hoogendoorn Growth Management and Saint-Gobain Cultilene are working together to optimise and standardise this irrigation. This increasingly puts data-driven growing in the spotlight and results in a plant that is more resilient and more in balance.\n\nMany growers have traditionally been accustomed to growing by instinct – including when it comes to determining the length of the irrigation cycle and the interval between cycles. “Most growers are guided by the weather, solar radiation, and so on,” says Remy Maat, Manager Application at Cultilene. “This results in decisions often being taken on an ad-hoc basis instead of based on a proper strategy mapped out in advance. This often works out fine, but it also means that regular adjustments need to be made to factors like the water content, EC, pH, oxygen or temperature. But major corrections often cause extreme reactions in the plants, which can lead to problems such as blossom-end rot. That’s why systematic data-driven growing is a preferable strategy. And we are moving more and more in that direction.”\n\nIdeal co-driver\n\nCultilene and Hoogendoorn are making great strides in this area as partners within the Plant Empowerment (GPE) concept. “At Hoogendoorn, we develop automation solutions for greenhouses and are particularly well known for our climate computers,” says René Beerkens, Greenhouse Consultant at Hoogendoorn. “But ‘climate computer’ is actually a misnomer: it would be better to call it a ‘growth computer’. After all, the computer not only controls the greenhouse climate but also the irrigation and therefore the conditions in the root zone. Hoogendoorn also supplies the hardware for monitoring this, in the form of sensors or the Aquabalance, for example. The latter is a special weighing scale that helps you tailor your irrigation exactly to the needs of the plant and the conditions in the substrate slab.”\n\nThis is also where the link with Cultilene comes in: as a specialist in substrates and irrigation, Cultilene can help growers to control their irrigation more precisely and optimise it. “With the help of Hoogendoorn’s hardware, large amounts of data can be collected about what is happening both above and below ground. The data is also displayed clearly on graphs on the climate computer,” says Maat. “The challenge is to set the right limit values for this and to make sure that you, the grower, stay within a certain bandwidth in terms of irrigation, EC, pH, and so on. With our knowledge and experience, we at Cultilene can work with you to help you set the right limits. These limit values can be entered in the Hoogendoorn climate computer and then monitored with the aid of sensors. In this way, Cultilene and Hoogendoorn reinforce each other within the Plant Empowerment concept.”\n\nGrowing by recipe\n\nBeerkens translates the collaboration between the two companies into an apt metaphor: “You can essentially see the climate computer as a car. We at Hoogendoorn make the car, then it’s up to the grower to drive it. But it’s good to have co-drivers to guide you through certain areas. Irrigation is one of the areas that requires a little extra navigation. Cultilene makes the perfect co-driver.”\n\nNot only is Cultilene’s knowledge and experience of value in this area, but the collaboration between Cultilene and Hoogendoorn also makes a difference, Maat emphasises. “The data and graphs that Hoogendoorn collects, combined with our expertise, are helping to achieve more and more standardisation. This will eventually enable us to come up with the ideal recipe for irrigation in a crop of a particular tomato variety, for example. If you follow that recipe, you will be 90 percent of the way there. We can then work with you to fine-tune the rest.”\n\nAccording to Maat, the main challenge is to change the mindset of growers. “They have to move away from growing by instinct and start doing things differently than they were used to. That’s not always easy for them, not least because instinct and data don’t always agree. It is important for growers to learn to trust the data. And rather than forcing them into it, we want to inspire them and show them that things can be done differently. On top of that, more data-driven and recipe-based growing could be an answer to the declining number of people with ‘green fingers’ in horticulture.”\n\nPlant in balance\n\nOf course, the key question is what can be achieved with more data-driven and recipe-based growing under the principles of Plant Empowerment. “Plant Empowerment is all about getting the plant in balance, including in terms of water. The collaboration between Cultilene and Hoogendoorn is focused mainly on optimising the water balance. But this in turn also impacts on the assimilate and energy balance. All this will eventually result in a plant that is more balanced and therefore also more resilient. And that’s the ultimate goal.”\n\nFor more information:\n\nPlease contact one of the GPE consultants:\n\nRemy Maat: +31 (0)6 83 64 85 88 | remy.maat@saint-gobain.com\n\nRene Beerkens: +31 (0)6 24 82 15 49 | RBe@hoogendoorn.nl\n\nVisit the Plant Empowerment website\n\nWorking together for a healthy and resilient plant\n\nSaint-Gobain Cultilene and Koppert Biological Systems cooperate closely in Plant Empowerment\n\nA plant that is in balance is strong and healthy. Plant Empowerment implementation partners Saint-Gobain Cultilene and Koppert Biological Systems are working together to improve the resilience and health of crops grown in stone wool. Encouraging soil life is a key part of this. The presence of sufficient oxygen plays a crucial role in this context.\n\nAll partners in Plant Empowerment (GPE, see box) have their own focal areas. Cultilene focuses mainly on the substrate and irrigation, while the focus at Koppert is on plant health. “Koppert has always specialised in the production and introduction of natural enemies. It was mainly insects to begin with, but nowadays we are increasingly working with microbes to control pests and diseases,” says Mark van der Werf, plant health consultant at Koppert. “But this essentially only controls the symptoms. That is why our focus in recent years has increasingly been on improving plant health and resilience, so that pests and diseases have less of a chance. The soil and substrate play a key role in this; the presence of fungi and bacteria around the roots is particularly crucial. These microorganisms help to improve nutrient uptake and boost the crop’s immune system.”\n\nPlant health\n\nImproving the health and resilience of a crop growing in a stone wool substrate is a particularly tough challenge. Microorganisms – especially fungi – are generally not in their element in stone wool and find it difficult to adhere to these fibres. “We are therefore working with Cultilene to investigate ways of making soil life feel at home in stone wool and building up a good army of microorganisms. We improve the establishment and functioning of microorganisms by adding certain biostimulants, for example. At the same time, we are looking to increase plant resilience by changing the composition of the plant. We are doing this by adjusting the irrigation strategy and reducing the quantity of nitrate and phosphate in the nutrient solution, for example.”\n\nAccording to Van der Werf, this twin-track strategy changes the composition of the plant: it is less “inflated” and less attractive to pests and diseases. “And all this also fits perfectly within the principle of Plant Empowerment, which is about responding to the needs of the plant and creating balance. There is a lot of focus on the climate in Plant Empowerment, but we take a broader view and look at irrigation strategy and plant health.”\n\nOxygen content as a prerequisite\n\nEmiel Bronswijk, Propagation Product and Application Specialist at Cultilene, emphasises that sufficient oxygen around the roots is also an important prerequisite for healthy soil life. “Microorganisms, which are always concentrated around the roots, need oxygen in order to function properly and develop optimally, just like the roots themselves.”\n\nThe oxygen content depends among other things on the irrigation strategy: if you give too much water, the oxygen is pushed out of the substrate. “In addition, the position of the roots is key: the higher the roots are in the cube or slab, the more oxygen is generally available. The presence of oxygen at the top of the substrate can also be stimulated in various ways, such as by choosing a substrate with an X-fibre or horizontal fibre structure, ensuring the right plug hole depth, following a gentle dry-out strategy after planting, and so on.”\n\nOne step further\n\nBronswijk admits that stimulating soil life in stone wool is quite a challenge. “It’s a real quest. Despite that, the results of the tests we have already carried out are promising. By working intensively with Koppert within the Plant Empowerment philosophy and sharing knowledge and insights, we keep going one step further.”\n\nAbout Plant Empowerment (GPE)\n\nCreating an optimal balance in terms of water, energy and assimilates – that’s what Plant Empowerment is all about. If all these factors are properly managed and the balances are in the right proportions, the plant is completely in balance. Among other things, this results in a healthier, more resilient crop, better quality and higher yields. It also allows you to cut down on the use of water, fertilisers, energy and crop protection products.\n\nFor more information:\n\nPlease contact one of the GPE consultants:\n\nEmiel Bronswijk: +31 (0)6 82 75 21 69 | emiel.bronswijk@saint-gobain.com\n\nMark van der Werf: +31 (0)6 23 47 44 85 | MvdWerf@koppert.nl\n\nVisit the Plant Empowerment website\n\nStress-free crop and higher yields due to improved irrigation\n\nRead the article published in the trade journal In Greenhouses here.\n\nSource: In Greenhouses Magazine www.ingreenhouses.com\n\nWould you like to know more about the CARA MET sensor; click here\n\nNew online Plant Empowerment course: ‘The power of integrated solutions’\n\nThis May, Plant Empowerment is launching a new ten-part online course for growers from all over the world. Held once a month, each session will focus on the importance of integrated solutions.\n\nPlant Empowerment’s new online course, called ‘The power of integrated solutions’, will address common issues faced by growers around the world on a daily basis, such as challenges relating to a homogeneous climate, cracked fruits or an active and healthy root system. The monthly sessions, each lasting approximately 60-90 minutes, will underline the importance of an integrated approach to overcome these challenges. They will also give growers valuable new knowledge and tools they can use in practice.\n\nPlant Empowerment revolves around cultivating greenhouse crops sustainably by supporting the plant’s balances. The starting point is to stimulate and promote the natural vitality of the plant by creating optimal growth conditions, both above ground and in the root zone. This can only be achieved by taking an integrated approach to all aspects.\n\nThe online course will be given by the three authors of the reference work called Plant Empowerment, the basic principles in cooperation with the six Plant Empowerment Implementation Partners. Each session will be presented by two or three experts and there will be plenty of time for questions and discussion. Additionally, the course participants will receive access to a private LinkedIn group where they can continue the discussion both with the experts and with one another in between sessions.\n\nProgramme\n\nAll sessions start at 16:00 h (CEST)\n\nJoin us!\n\nThe first session on 20 May (at 16:00 h CET) is open to everyone free of charge. Participation in each of the subsequent sessions costs €19 per session, or €99 for all nine sessions (a saving of €72). The package price of €99 also includes access to the private LinkedIn group. To register, go to: https://www.plantempowerment.com/researcheducation/online-courses/\n\nThe revenues for the online course are used for further development of the philosophy.\n\nSteelmark, Siggpac en Pörtom Handelsträdgård (Finland)\n\nFinnish growers share their experiences with Cultilene products\n\nYoung plant nursery Pörtom Handelsträdgård and cucumber grower SIGGPAC are two of the leading businesses in the Finnish greenhouse horticulture sector. They have been working with Cultilene plugs, cubes and slabs for several years. And they are delighted with the results. The key plus points for the growers are the stability of the Cultilene products and the excellent root penetration achieved with the RootmaXX cube. Their close working relationships with Cultilene and the distributor Steelmark also deliver substantial added value.\n\nFinnish tomato and cucumber production is mostly concentrated in the western part of the country, particularly in the municipality of Närpes. The majority of greenhouse companies in this region are equipped to the very latest standards and use assimilation lighting to allow year-round production. About thirty kilometres north of Närpes is Pörtom, the home base of Pörtom Handelsträdgård. This propagator produces more than two million cucumber and 400,000 tomato plants a year. “That makes our 1.5-hectare business one of the biggest propagators in Finland,” says Stefan Åman, who runs the company together with his brother Anders. “Two-thirds of our production consists of cucumber plants; the rest are tomato plants. We mainly supply growers in Finland, but also some in Sweden.” Åman has been working with plugs and RootmaXX cubes from Cultilene since 2015. “Why do we use RootmaXX? Mainly because our customers are extremely happy with this cube. It ensures good root penetration from the cube to the slab, and the roots are very well distributed through the RootmaXX cube. RootmaXX is without doubt the best substrate cube available on the market at the moment, and in fact it’s the only product that meets our high standards.”\n\nStable slab structure and characteristics\n\nSIGGPAC in Närpes has been growing on Cultilene substrate products for seven years. This high-tech cucumber farm produces cucumbers all year round on an area of 12.5 hectares. Its products are sold via wholesalers to retailers in Finland, Sweden and the Baltic states. “We switched to Cultilene’s Exact Air slabs in 2014,” says Niclas Sigg, who runs the company with his brother and sister. “The characteristics of the slabs we used before were not stable enough, especially towards the end of the crop. It was also difficult to maintain the water content in the final phase of the crop. Besides that, the slab structure deteriorated so much over time that the oxygen content was inadequate.” The grower therefore sees the stability of the Exact Air slabs as their biggest advantage. “The slab structure and characteristics stay stable and uniform from the first day of the crop to the last. Because the structure is maintained, the plants can rely on a constant supply of water, nutrients and oxygen. The EC, water content and oxygen remain at the same level throughout. That is crucial if you’re aiming for the highest possible quality products and yields. The excellent root distribution through the slab is another great advantage of Exact Air.”\n\nThe perfect substrate combination\n\nSigg is also more than happy with the combination of Exact Air and Cultilene’s RootmaXX cube. “The roots develop well throughout the whole cube and are strong and healthy at the time of planting. This guarantees that the crop will get off to the best possible start. The plant also roots quickly into the slab. As a grower, all this gives you peace of mind: you just know things will go well. Exact Air and RootmaXX are the perfect substrate combination for cucumber cultivation!”\n\nKnowledge sharing as added value\n\nBoth customers speak very highly of their close working relationship with Cultilene and the Finnish distributor Steelmark. “The people at Steelmark are very service-oriented. And if there is a problem, they solve it promptly and efficiently,” says Stefan Åman. “Steelmark normally visits us at least twice a year together with representatives of Cultilene. It’s not only Cultilene’s products but also this opportunity to share knowledge and information that are helping us to take our business to an even higher level.”\n\nNiclas Sigg also sees sharing knowledge with Steelmark and Cultilene as a great plus point. “The visits by Cultilene representatives and the information we receive on new product development is very valuable. And also very importantly, Steelmark always delivers on time and keeps its word. That’s a must for a tightly run company like SIGGPAC.”\n\nAnne-Claire Goyer (France)\n\nAnne-Claire Goyer, tomato grower and president of producers’ association Ydeal\n\nFrench tomato grower Anne-Claire Goyer has been working with Cultilene substrate slabs and cubes for many years and is very happy with the results. She finds that Exact Air and RootmaXX complement one another perfectly and also speaks very highly of the support and added value Cultilene provides.\n\nAnne-Claire Goyer is one of France’s leading greenhouse growers. She runs a cherry and cocktail tomato nursery with three locations – Serres de la Piogerie, Serres de Saint Léger and Serres de la Chapelle – in the Nantes and Rennes regions. In addition, Goyer is chair of the producers’ association Ydeal. Ydeal has a total acreage of forty hectares of ultra-modern greenhouses. A large proportion of their products are grown on Cultilene’s Exact Air slabs, and the volume is increasing every year. Goyer also uses Exact Air. “In part of our 13-hectare nursery in the Nantes region, we have been working with Cultilene products for seven years. Exact Air slabs are our preferred choice because the water and EC content are extremely easy to control. These slabs are also very reactive. You can quickly achieve the optimal water and EC content in the root zone when conditions in the greenhouse change, no matter what time of day it is. This results in optimal root development throughout the slab.”\n\nFast rooting\n\nGoyer also finds the combination of Exact Air slabs and RootmaXX cubes extremely valuable. “RootmaXX is a homogeneous cube, so the roots spread out nicely through the cube and the water and EC content is easy to control. The roots also penetrate through to the slab very quickly. In addition, our planting hole configurations are specially adapted to our needs in terms of dimensions and positioning on the slab. There are also perforations between the cubes which enable the plastic film to be removed at any time. This allows us to limit any excessive root growth.”\n\nHelp with switching\n\nLast year, Goyer took over a 17-hectare cherry tomato nursery in the Rennes region. Because of her positive experiences in the past, it made sense for the grower to work with Cultilene there as well. “The previous owner used a substrate based on coco fibre. We decided to switch to stone wool because this substrate is more reliable in terms of steering the crop. Cultilene helped us make the switch by guiding our crop managers through the process and providing them with extra knowledge.”\n\nSince last year, Goyer has also been working with the CARA MET sensor. This new sensor provides a real-time picture of the EC, the water content and the temperature in the root zone. “The fact that this sensor accurately measures both low and high EC values is a great advantage. Growing full-flavour tomatoes is a difficult process to steer and requires high ECs.”\n\nKnowledgeable\n\nAnne-Claire Goyer is happy with her working relationship with Cultilene for other reasons, too. “Everything is well organised and orders are closely monitored right up to delivery. Another plus is that the substrate slabs can be recycled at the end of the season. And on top of that, Cultilene’s prices are competitive.”\n\nThe grower also speaks highly of Cultilene’s expertise. “The people at Cultilene are extremely knowledgeable and are always happy to answer questions. They even invited us to visit various growers abroad, including in the Netherlands and Poland. So Cultilene really is more than just a substrate supplier. It is a fully-fledged partner, and rightly so.”\n\n“Plant Empowerment will help us to generate optimal growth with every square metre”\n\nSince first introducing the Plant Empowerment principles around 18 months ago, Belgian tomato producer Den Berk Délice has made several changes and is already experiencing numerous benefits. Grower Lucas Aertsen explains more in this interview.\n\nLucas Aertsen is head grower at the 9.6ha tomato production facility of Salmmeir BV in the Belgian town of Rijkevorsel. This company – part of the Den Berk Délice group which has a total of 60ha of production across six locations – has a strong reputation for supplying high-quality and flavoursome specialty tomatoes to major retailers throughout Europe. Its main varieties are the red cherry tomatoes Axiany and Sweetelle, plus a number of others for the production of colour mixes.\n\nLucas has been working in the greenhouse sector since graduating with a degree in bioengineering from Leuven University around five years ago. “What I love about my role is that it’s so broad,” comments Lucas. “In addition to plant biology, I’m involved in new technology and IT, the energy market and, in view of our expansion plans, even construction.” A brand-new 7.2ha greenhouse is currently being constructed, where the first crops will be planted in late August. Besides that, another 8.5ha facility is being added at the end of this year with production scheduled to start in March/April 2022.\n\nTransforming expertise into data\n\n“Our company is expanding so fast that we really need to be data-driven. A couple of years ago we had six or seven growers, but there are now around ten of us and next year there will be 15. Most of the new recruits are relatively young and less experienced. So we asked ourselves how we could transform the expertise of our more experienced growers into data to help the new growers get up to speed quickly,” explains Lucas. In this context, Den Berk Délice installed the LetsGrow.com data platform around 18 months ago and has been working in line with the Plant Empowerment concept ever since.\n\nThe ‘Growing by Plant Empowerment’ cultivation method has evolved from the principles of Het Nieuwe Telen (‘Next Generation Growing’), which have been tested and proved around the world ever since first being developed in the Netherlands by P.A.M Geelen, J.O. Voogt and P.A.M. van Weel in 2005. In 2016, the founders wrote a book called ‘Growing by Plant Empowerment’ to explain this integrated approach. It is based on physics and plant physiology and focuses on keeping all the plant balances in equilibrium. Data is continuously collected and analysed during the cultivation process to monitor how the greenhouse conditions are affecting crop performance as the basis for decision-making. The concept is actively supported by a multidisciplinary team of six official Plant Empowerment Implementation Partners, including substrate specialist Saint-Gobain Cultilene, the LetsGrow.com data platform, climate computer provider Hoogendoorn Growth Management and screening specialist Ludvig Svensson.\n\nBetter comparisons\n\n“Before the LetsGrow.com data platform was installed, we used to have a weekly meeting of all the growers from all the different companies in the group so we could discuss the results from our crops and varieties together. This entailed a lot of Excel sheets and printouts from the climate computer, and the preparation was very time-consuming. Nowadays, the previous day’s climate data is automatically sent to each manager via LetsGrow.com and we receive an overview once a week, plus we can always use our own dashboard at any time. This makes it much easier to access reliable data as the basis for comparing and discussing crop performance,” he adds.\n\nTo help Den Berk Délice get the most out of the Plant Empowerment principles, the company has been receiving training since October 2020. “All our growers attend a two-hour online session once every two weeks. The theory from the various chapters in the book forms the basis, but the course is also tailored to our own real-life situation,” comments Lucas. “We use our own dashboard and explore the balances, such as water, energy, assimilates, the influence of the screening strategy and so on, based on topical issues. The course is presented by experts from LetsGrow.com and Hoogendoorn Growth Management with input from the other Plant Empowerment implementation partners behind the scenes.”\n\nSharing knowledge\n\n“We don’t want to be an inward-looking company – we believe it’s important to stay in touch with the market to hear about the latest developments, share knowledge and gain new insights that will help us to continuously improve. And our contact with the Plant Empowerment implementation partners plays a key role in that,” he continues.\n\nAbove all, Lucas has noticed that working in line with the Plant Empowerment principles has shifted the focus from subjective intuition to objective data. “That creates some lively discussions!” he says. “We have a very experienced grower on our team who has been in the tomato business for more than 20 years. We see it as a challenge to convince him to let us try things out based on the data insights, and it’s satisfying to see him gaining confidence in the data when he sees that it actually works.”\n\nSupport for decision-making\n\nThe rootzone is one area in which those data insights have made a big difference. In spring 2020, Den Berk Délice worked with Saint-Gobain Cultilene to install CARA MET sensors which continuously monitor the water content, temperature and EC in the substrate and communicate wirelessly via the cloud. All the data is displayed in the Saint-Gobain Cultilene dashboard on the LetsGrow.com platform. “This really supports our decision-making. Flavour is very important for us; we aim for a brix of 10.5 in our tomatoes to achieve the desired sweetness. The brix value is mainly influenced by the EC in the substrate, so if the brix drops below 10 that’s the first thing we look at – and we now have that data constantly at our fingertips.”\n\nAll the data has revealed some interesting interactions, according to Lucas: “For example, we can monitor both the EC and the radiation level changing throughout the day to identify when it’s the best time to reduce the EC. And last year, the data enabled us to experiment with the EC reduction in combination with both our irrigation and ventilation strategy. In the right combination, the plants stayed active for longer and were much better balanced in terms of photosynthesis and keeping themselves cool, with no plant stress.”\n\nPrioritizing humidity\n\nAnother change resulting from the Plant Empowerment approach has been a better understanding of the role of humidity and screening. “In the past we were focused mainly on the temperature in the greenhouse, but thanks to the data insights, we’re increasingly using humidity to create an active climate – particularly in the spring and summer – by balancing our ventilation, lighting and heating strategies in line with the outdoor conditions,” says Lucas. “And our screen supplier Ludvig Svensson, another Plant Empowerment implementation partner, helped us to develop a screening strategy to maintain the optimal temperature, not only in the greenhouse but also in the plants themselves. On cold days, we now use screening more intensively to prevent energy loss from the top of the plants; it’s important to keep them warm to stimulate active growth. However, we always leave the screens around 15-20% open to allow the moisture to escape. So overall, we’re much more focused on achieving the right moisture balance – both in terms of what the plants receive and what they produce.”\n\nThe new greenhouse currently being built at the Salmmeir facility will be fitted with a hybrid top-lighting system including LEDs at 265 mmol rather than the 180mmol currently used. “Now that we have even better control over the climate and can maintain a better plant balance thanks to the Plant Empowerment approach, we believe we can work with higher light intensities and for longer periods. Some varieties will perform better under more light than others, of course, so it will still be a matter of combining the data with our own insights and experimenting with things like plant spacings. But the data gives us an excellent basis to start from.”\n\nSustainability\n\nLast but not least, sustainability is important for Den Berk Délice. For example, the company is continuously working to further enhance its closed-loop water system, plus it is building a new storage and sorting facility which will be equipped with solar panels and be directly connected to a local industrial park’s network for thermal energy recovery. “Growing in line with the Plant Empowerment principles also supports a sustainable approach,” states Lucas. “As the agrifood industry continues to scale up, data will enable growers to manage ever-larger crop production areas. Plus by sharing knowledge, gaining new insights and optimizing our use of the very latest technologies, we can generate a better yield from every square metre with the optimum use of resources – and that’s what I personally find most important,” he concludes.\n\nFor more information:\n\nVisit the website of Plant Empowerment\n\nOptimally aligning light input and irrigation crucial for good plant balance\n\nSaint-Gobain Cultilene and Hortilux work closely together in Plant Empowerment\n\nKeeping the plant in optimal balance in terms of water, energy and assimilates – that’s what Plant Empowerment is all about. To achieve this balance, factors such as irrigation and light input must be optimally aligned. Saint-Gobain Cultilene and Hortilux – both partners of the Plant Empowerment growing philosophy – therefore work intensively together and advocate a systematic approach.\n\nPlant Empowerment is all about creating an optimal balance in terms of water, energy and assimilates. If all these factors are properly managed and the balances are in the right proportions, the plant is completely in balance. “This can achieve a great result” says Remy Maat, Manager Application at Cultilene. “It can produce a healthier, more resilient crop, better quality and higher yields, for example. It also allows you to save on water, fertilizers, energy and crop protection products. The areas in which the most gains can be made differ from one grower to the next and depend on where a nursery currently stands.”\n\nClosely connected\n\nCultilene has been a partner in Plant Empowerment (GPE) ever since its inception. All the partners have their own focal areas. Cultilene focuses mainly on irrigation. As a supplier of grow light solutions, Hortilux’s main specialist field is light. Cooperation between the two partners is clearly needed, stresses Hans de Vries, Consultant Grow Light Performance at Hortilux. “Light and irrigation are factors that influence each other strongly and are closely connected. After all, light is the driving force behind photosynthesis and therefore the production process. But if water and nutrients are in short supply, photosynthesis stagnates and the plant can’t make use of the available light. To achieve a good plant balance, light input and irrigation must be optimally aligned.” Maat agrees, pointing out that both the amount and type of light in a greenhouse impact on irrigation. “The more light and solar radiation there is, the higher the temperature will be in the greenhouse and the more water the plant will need to keep cool. The type of light source – sunlight, HPS or LED – also plays an important role. HPS lamps give off much more heat than LEDs, which means that they also impact differently on the plant and transpiration. You have to take that into account when providing water and nutrients.” As a rule of thumb, the higher the light input and the temperature are, the more water will be needed. “At the same time, we lower the EC as the temperature rises. At a higher temperature, the plant needs more water but the amount of nutrients it needs remains constant. If the EC is too high, it becomes harder for the plant to absorb water, which can potentially have an adverse effect on plant growth.” Maat also points out that the amount of water and EC are always adjusted based on the amount of available light in the greenhouse and not the other way round. “This makes sense, actually: grow light is a fixed item that isn’t easy to change, whereas water can always be given in the right quantity.”\n\nUniform watering in winter months\n\nThe two GPE consultants point out that winter is a special period when it comes to the relationship between light and irrigation. At this time of year, light input from outside is relatively low, and growers usually use supplementary lighting for the same number of hours every day. “Light is therefore a pretty constant factor. That also means that you have to approach irrigation differently: it can follow a relatively uniform rhythm,” Maat says. “A 24-hour period is usually divided into three periods. It starts with a dark period, between 6 pm and midnight. No water is given then. At midnight, the lights go on. We start watering two hours after switching on the lights at the earliest. While the lights are on at night, we water two or three times at most, up until about two hours before sunrise. Then the day starts, which runs through until 6 pm. Our first daytime irrigation is two hours after sunrise, after which we switch to a normal daily rhythm.” However, De Vries points out that the amount of available light in the greenhouse fluctuates more in spring and autumn due to the bigger differences in outdoor conditions and in the amount of sunlight. “That also requires more adjustments to the irrigation and EC supply. At this time of year, your irrigation can generally follow a less consistent rhythm than in the winter months.”\n\nSystematic approach\n\nIn summary, aligning the irrigation to the amount of available light in the greenhouse is no easy task. “In fact, it’s quite a challenge. Especially now that grow light is gaining ground and more and more different types of grow light are being used,” Maat says. “Within GPE, we are therefore working on a protocol with guidelines for irrigating while grow light is being used. This should give growers tips on how to handle this properly.”\n\nAccording to Maat and De Vries, a systematic approach is very important. Their advice for growers is to work out on paper in advance how much light – based on the plant load – you need in your greenhouse every week and how the lighting is geared towards this. “You can then also roughly align your watering to this,” De Vries says. “If you don’t make a plan, you will have to make more ad hoc adjustments and you will be in a constant cycle of catching up. For example, many tomato growers start with an extra stem around the darkest day. This also means that in the following weeks, more light will gradually be needed and irrigation will have to be stepped up. It is a good idea to plan the timing of these actions carefully: last-minute adjustments are very tricky to make.” As Maat points out, major corrections in the cropping strategy are best avoided anyway. “Reacting in extremes is never a good thing: it impacts negatively on the plant balance and therefore ultimately on yields and quality. A plant must be able to grow uniformly and consistently. In other words, anticipating instead of reacting is what it’s all about.”\n\nFor more information:\n\nPlease contact one of the GPE consultants:\n\nRemy Maat: +31 (0)6 83 64 85 88 | remy.maat@saint-gobain.com\n\nHans de Vries: +31 (0)6 57 01 14 88 | h.devries@hortilux.com\n\nVisit the Plant Empowerment website\n\nGrowing by Plant Empowerment at BASF Vegetable Seeds\n\nA stable, robust and reproducible data-driven strategy for maximizing yields\n\nLast year, a tomato trial at a BASF Vegetable Seeds facility in the Netherlands showed that the Growing by Plant Empowerment (GPE) principles have the potential to increase yields by as much as 25% in the winter period. With the support of the multidisciplinary GPE project team, the crop production strategy has now been fine-tuned and the second trial for tomatoes and additional ones for lettuce and cucumbers are already under way.\n\nThe principles of Het Nieuwe Telen (‘Next Generation Growing’) have been tested and proved around the world ever since first being developed in the Netherlands by P.A.M Geelen, J.O. Voogt and P.A.M. van Weel in 2005. In 2016, the founders renamed the cultivation method ‘Growing by Plant empowerment’ and wrote a book explaining this integrated approach, which is based on physics and plant physiology and focuses on keeping all the plant balances in equilibrium. Data is continuously collected and analysed during the cultivation process to monitor how the greenhouse conditions are affecting crop performance as the basis for decision-making.\n\nBASF Vegetable Seeds ambition is to make healthy eating enjoyable by offering vegetable solutions that are in line with consumers’ needs. By exchanging knowledge and collaborating with partners along the entire vegetable value chain it aims to provide innovation, expert advice, reliable varieties, profitable and consumer-oriented concepts and sustainable solutions. “That’s why collaborative partnerships are an important part of our strategy,” states Martin Voorberg, R&D Capital Investment Venture Manager and Project Manager at BASF Vegetable Seeds. “Together with Hoogendoorn Growth Management, one of the GPE Implementation Partners, we previously ran a hydroponic lettuce trial at our site in ’s-Gravenzande, the Netherlands, based on autonomous and data-driven growing. The results were so impressive that we decided to try it for tomatoes too, so in October 2019 we set up a GPE trial on around 500m2 with a broader team.”\n\nMultidisciplinary project team\n\nIn addition to Hoogendoorn Growth Management, the multidisciplinary team comprised five other GPE Implementation Partners: Koppert Biological Systems for pollination and pest management, Hortilux/PL Light Systems for lighting, the LetsGrow.com data platform, Ludvig Svensson for the screening strategy and stone wool specialist Saint-Gobain Cultilene. “We wanted to develop a proactive rather than reactive approach to the crop strategy and explore the possibilities for maximizing production by taking all aspects of the climate and plant health into account. That meant ‘switching off’ our emotions and allowing ourselves to be led by the data, even if it went against our natural instincts. On our side, the project was managed by a grower with a lot of experience who is also open to innovation and not afraid of stepping out of his comfort zone,” adds Martin. “We were keen to try working with higher temperatures, and another thing we wanted to explore was increased light levels and different light regimes,” he explains.\n\nNo holding back\n\n“What was great about the team at BASF was that even though the growing method didn’t feel ‘normal’, they put their trust in the figures and just did it,” says Mark van der Werf, a nutrition and climate consultant working with the GPE-concept. “If you want to get the most out of GPE, you have to do what the data tells you – no holding back. The human aspect is the most instable factor in crop production. GPE makes it all about physics and mathematics; once you know the right formula for your crop, you can run it all year round. The initial results were amazing, with a 20-25% increase in yield in the winter. But then the crop weakened and lost vigour as we headed into spring.”\n\nThis decline in plant performance was discussed in one of the regular GPE meetings. “The general consensus was that the overall strategy was promising, but we had some practical issues,” recalls Mark. “The trial area was exposed to quite a lot of external influences due to aisles and gables, which made it difficult to maintain a uniform climate. We also suspected that the increased light levels – based on 100% high pressure sodium (HPS) lamps – had generated too much heat for the plants to cope with.”\n\nLighting solution\n\nHans de Vries, a consultant from Hortilux, rapidly set about finding a solution. “HPS lamps typically generate a lot of heat and, especially when the screens were closed for energy saving and CO2, the temperature in the greenhouse sometimes rose too high. We also identified some other issues, such as that the ceiling of the greenhouse was a little lower than ideal, meaning that the plants were too close to the lamps. That affected the uniformity of light and hence crop growth,” explains Hans. “LEDs are the best option to solve the heat problem, so we’ve installed a hybrid system of 65% LEDs and 35% HPS for the second season. We now have 262μmol PAR instead of 180μmol PAR in the old system – but thanks to the energy-savings of LEDs this doesn’t translate into higher energy costs. By reducing the heat, we give the grower more flexibility in the lighting strategy. For example, he can leave the lights on for longer even when it’s warm outside, and he doesn’t need to open the windows to ventilate so soon, which means he can keep the CO2 inside – and that’s better for photosynthesis and for the plant’s ability to regulate its temperature. Additionally, the LED fittings have enabled us to create a bit more space between the tops of the plants and the ceiling so the light can be distributed more evenly. All of these factors improve plant health and performance.” Data-driven growing is not a new concept for Hortilux. “We’ve developed a tool that helps to monitor the efficiency of photosynthesis based on the climate and light data from the existing sensors. That’s another useful piece in the data puzzle in this project to help the customer achieve an even stronger crop and a higher yield,” he comments.\n\nUnique collaborative support\n\nAt BASF Vegetable Seeds, Martin is very positive about the combined approach of all the GPE Implementation Partners. “The whole sector is professionalizing very quickly and it’s increasingly important to be part of an ecosystem. Ultimately, we all share the common goal of helping our customers – the crop production companies – to tackle their challenges. Skilled growers with traditional ‘green fingers’ are getting harder to find but the younger generation is interested in data, so we see GPE as one of the solutions – mainly for our customers, but also for us – to recruit and retain good crop managers. In terms of scalability, autonomous, data-driven growing has the potential to make it possible for growers to manage larger production areas in the future. So GPE ticks several boxes for us and, in my view, it is definitely a case of one plus one equals three,” he says.\n\nHugely enthusiastic\n\n“In terms of concrete results, we didn’t completely achieve the objectives we had set for ourselves last year,” admits Martin. “But despite that, everyone is hugely enthusiastic about the potential. Above all, it has been a very steep learning curve. I myself have 20 years of experience as a grower but GPE has given me a whole new perspective on crop production. By focusing on the data, you can question all the previously held ‘truths’ about temperatures, light, photosynthesis and do so much more than you realize.” BASF has just planted the tomato crop for its second trial season of GPE. “The strategy for the whole year was prepared and entered into the computer around six weeks ago, so now it’s just a matter of executing it. Also nutrition is now data driven with biweekly plant sap analyses to monitor and steer the composition of the plant. It was good to experiment last year, but this year our strategy is less about pushing things beyond the limits and more about maximizing the yield of our main truss variety, Provine, over the entire season and to create a positive business case for growers. The beauty of data-driven growing is that it makes things more predictable and easier to explain. If we can develop a stable, robust and reproducible strategy based on GPE principles, we can recommend it to our customers to help them get the very best out of this variety. And then we can hopefully do the same for our other varieties and crops in the near future too,” he concludes.\n\n‘Sailing a steady course is key to an optimal water balance’\n\nRichard van der Stoep and Remy Maat on watering in practice\n\nThe water balance is one of the three pillars under the Plant Empowerment concept and plays a crucial role in keeping the plant in balance.
