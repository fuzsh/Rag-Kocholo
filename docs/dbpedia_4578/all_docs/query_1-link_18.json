        "text": "Things TO DO Near Arch Of Hadrian\n\nThe Hippodrome; This ancient sports field (244m by 50m) was constructed between the first and third centuries AD and was once surrounded by seating for up to 15,000 spectators, which is 30 times the current capacity. It was primarily used for chariot races and athletic competitions.\n\nThe Temple of Zeus; is one of the archaeological sites' most significant monuments. From the seventh to the sixth century B.C., a cave was presumably utilized as the earliest place of worship on the property. This place of worship was preserved over time, and in the early Roman era, a sanctuary with a large temenos (holy courtyard) was constructed. The structure underwent significant changes during the second century A.D., and the current enormous Temple of Zeus was constructed. A massive staircase leading to the temenos was present before the sanctuary, which was perched atop a hill towering over the city. The site has been destroyed by erosion, earthquakes, and looting, yet its scale and magnificence are still impressive.\n\nThe church of St. Cosmas and Damianos; There are a lot of things to look at and take in in this region because it is so large. If you have a particular interest in churches, you will undoubtedly want to visit this one as it is located on the same property as more than a dozen others. You have to tread carefully and choose your vantage point carefully because it is in a dangerous region.\n\nThe Romans armyy and chariot experience; One is transported back in time to the Roman era through the Roman Army and Chariot Experience. It really is fascinating.\n\nThe South Theater; Constructed between 90 and 92 AD during the time of Emperor Domitian, has more than 3000 seats. The elaborate stage's first level, which was once a two-story building, has been rebuilt and is continuing in use today. A speaker in the middle of the orchestra floor may be heard across the entire theater without raising his voice thanks to the theater's exceptional acoustics. Four passages at the back of the theater provide access to the upper rows of seats, and two vaulted corridors lead into the orchestra. There may have been some reserved seats, and you can still make out the Greek letters that identify them.\n\nLocation, And History Of The Arch Of Hadrian In Jerash\n\nNot originally intended to be a free-standing building, but rather a spectacular city entrance constructed into a city wall that was never completed here. The Arch was erected as a tribute to Hadrian, the Roman emperor, who spent the winter of 129/130 AD in Gerasa. One of the largest Roman Empire arches ever discovered, measuring 25 m in width and 21.5 m in height with the main gate that is almost 11 m high and almost 6 m broad. All of the missing pieces could be identified, allowing for a reconstruction. The north facade, which faces the city, was inscribed in Greek. The inscription's designations of \"holy, asylum, and autonomous\" for the city were quickly removed. It shows that there was political unrest in Gerasa, which most likely took place around the period of the second Jewish uprising (132–135 AD), and was likely carried out on the emperor's orders. The Arch can be located 460 meters south of the city of Gerasa's Southern Gate, which is now in Jerash (Jordan). The actual arch is a 21 m high, rectangular building with three arched gates. The arch is distinguished by a dual façade that faces both the road and the city from the north. Although not identical in their architectural elements, the two facades were comparable. The two flanking arches are smaller and lower than the central one. The façade's four enormous Corinthian columns frame it. Each column is supported by a pedestal, base, and an acanthus leaf ornamentation on top."
