        "text": "Villa Development\n\nIn the countryside, rectangular farmhouses began to appear alongside traditional roundhouses. During the 2nd and 3rd centuries the addition of a portico and projecting wings at either end turned many of these simple farmhouses into ‘winged-corridor’ villas.\n\nLarger, more luxurious villas were elaborated over time, especially in the 4th century – at North Leigh, Oxfordshire, for example, wings were added to enclose a court, and at Lullingstone in Kent a fine apse-like dining room was added.\n\nAristocratic houses in British cities had a rather rural look. Unlike the compact houses built around open courtyards found in Mediterranean cities, they often developed rambling plans thanks to gradual additions, like their counterparts in the countryside.\n\nCITY PLANNING\n\nThe ideal Roman city plan was based on a regular grid of streets, dividing up square building plots or insulae. In the central insula was the forum, or market square – with a basilica, or great hall, running the length of one side of the square, and the council chamber and civic offices adjoining it.\n\nIn forts like Chesters and Housesteads on Hadrian’s Wall, the central headquarters building was a small-scale version of the civic forum-basilica. Here, soldiers collected or banked their pay, the administration of the unit was carried out, and the commander could address his troops.\n\nBy the mid-2nd century AD, many of the 22 Roman towns in Britain had a full set of the public buildings that defined Roman settlements elsewhere: not just the forum and basilica but also bathhouses, temples and amphitheatres, as well as shops and offices.\n\nThe wealth and enthusiasm of British town councillors did not always live up to the Roman ideal. Not all street grids were filled with buildings, and public edifices were not always maintained in the later Roman period. The rich seem to have preferred to move to the country and develop large private estates rather than invest in urban public buildings. While great defensive walls were built around the cities, inside them the buildings were crumbling."
