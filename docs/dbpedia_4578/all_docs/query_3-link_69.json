        "text": "On account of severe flooding around 620 BC, the Romans began systematic drainage of the Forum area and a constructed the Cloaca Maxima, an underground drain that still functions today. No longer a bog, and without the constant threats of floods, the central location of the Forum amongst the seven hills of Rome lent itself perfectly as a location for local merchants to bring and sell their food and goods and by 550 BC the Forum served exclusively as a marketplace. When Rome transitioned into a Republic in 509 BC, the Forum, as the main market already a place of public assembly and home to the sacred temples to Saturn and Vesta, was of course the natural place for the business of the state to be carried out. From this point growth in the Forum occurred in a somewhat indiscriminate way over the next four hundred plus years of Republic with consuls constructing new monuments to elicit both personal popularity and public pride.\n\nThis all changed when Julius Caesar seized the role of solitary consul for life in 48 BC. Caesar, desiring to solidify his power and impress his people, gave the Forum a brand new, much more majestic look, most notably by moving the Rostra to create a strong axis down the center, constructing a brilliant new Curia for the powerless Senate, and building an immense new Basilica Julia as a symbol of Roman judicial power. These transformations were continued by his adopted son and heir Augustus and by the end of Augustus reign, the layout of the Forum as we see it today was mostly established.\n\nAfter this each emperor added his personal touch to the Forum, trying to construct statuaries and temples and other public works in and around the Forum by which he might be remembered. Fire ravaged the Forum in 283 AD, destroying everything made of wood, marble, or any other exotic material that would burn. However, the Forum was quickly rebuilt as a nearly exact replica of what it had been by the emperor Diocletian.\n\nAfter the sack and eventual fall of the Roman Empire in the West, the pagan monuments of the Forum were largely forgotten by the new Catholic order that oversaw Rome. Certainly lack of general upkeep and a great earthquake in 867 caused dilapidation of the Forum, but the greatest destruction came at the hands of 15th-18th century stone-robbers in search of materials out of which to build new churches. Every piece of usable marble was taken and used directly in one of Romes great houses of worship, and that which was not usable was taken to be melted for lime.\n\nExcavations on the Forum began in the early 19th century at the Arch of Septimius Severus and Column of Phocas, but did not get seriously underway until 1870 when the Basilica Julia and central area of the Forum was laid bare. Excavations have proceeded intermittently since then. Large projects of restoration and preservation were undertaken in the 1980s. Today the Forum serves as a site worthy of a visit by everyone from historians and archaeologists to tourists from all corners of the world and college art history classes.\n\nAgain to the west behind the rostrae and embedded into the base of the Captoline Hill are the Precinct of Harmonious Gods and Temple of Concordia Augusta with the Temple of Vespasian and Titus, the deified Flavian emperors who ruled around 80 AD, sandwiched neatly in between long after the temples on either sided had been built. Directly to the north of the rostrae is the grand Arch of Septimius Serverus, which is still in very good condition today, showing the original decorative carvings of 203 AD. Immediately after crossing under the arch one finds himself in the Comitium, the meeting site for the public assembly, in the center of which lies the lapis niger or black stone where it is rumored Romulus is buried. North of this is Julius Caesars Curia a large brick building with the marble flooring remaining intact as one of the best examples of the Romans colorful marble designs and enormous bronze doors opening to the Comitium. Together the Comitium, Rostra, and Curia composed the center of government for the empire.\n\nDirectly to the north and south of the main forum area are the Basilica Aemilia and the Basilica Julia. These two level colonnaded structures, modeled after Greek architectural designs of the second century BC, were constructed to serve as judicial centers, but in reality served also as meeting sites, marketplaces, and a location for ever popular dice games, as noted by the game boards carved into the marble floors of the Basilica Julia. In front of the Basilica Aemila lies a small but important shrine to Venus Cloacina, in honor of the Cloaca Maxima, the ancient drain that runs under the Forum.\n\nTo the southeast of the Forum lies the sacred center of Rome with the Temple of Vesta, the House of the Vestal Virgins, and the Regia. The Temple of Vesta, said to have been built by Numa Pompilius, the second king of Rome, was originally a simple round wooden and thatched hut. Due to the fact that it housed the sacred flame of Vesta, and the tendency of wood to burn when around flame, the Temple burned down and was reconstructed quite frequently. One feature that was always maintained was the eastern orientation of the entranceway. Eventually the temple was rebuilt with tufa and marble making fires less frequent. The house of the Vestal Virgins was one of the grandest houses in all of Rome, with a peristyle that rivaled those of the emperors palaces and would impress the gods. Finally the Regia was the residence of Pontifex Maximus until Augustus combined the role of Pontifex Maximus and emperor and thus moved the residence to the Palatine. The name translating as the greatest bridge maker, the Pontifex Maximus also took on the role of religious icon acting as a bridge between the citizens and the gods.\n\nAs far as the architecture of the Forum, it was all centered around grandeur. The Forum was constructed as a symbol of Roman strength and accordingly employed the finest building materials available and the latest building techniques. Especially desirous were the colorful varieties of marble quarried after conquests in the East, Egypt, and Northern Africa, which they used either as the building blocks themselves or as decorative plating on cement structures. Most impressive are the gigantic monolithic columns imported from around the world and erected by a process which is still unknown to modern archaeologists. Most prolific were the festive Corinthian style columns, although several examples of Ionic columns and a few Doric columns can also be found. Nearly all of the structures that we see still today in the Forum were modeled after the architectural styles of the Greeks, whom the Romans admired and respected greatly for their democracy, arts, and philosophy.\n\nThe legal center of Rome was housed in the Basilica Julia, where the Centumviri met, a board of 180 men who heard civil suits. They would hear up to four cases at one time inside the basilica, separated only by curtains, and with hundreds of people crowded into the balconies to hear the proceedings, one can imagine the amount of noise and confusion a day at the courthouse could entail. Lawyers were limited in their speaking time by water clocks, however the number of clocks awarded to speak varied depending on the importance of the speaker, in the opinion of the court. Once it was recorded that Pliny the Younger was awarded 16 clocks of water, totaling a speaking time of over five hours! More than a courthouse, the Basilica Julia, and the Basilica Aemilia on the other side of the Forum served as meeting places for people and as a covered marketplace. The Basilica Aemilia actually having built in stalls and the Basilica Julia just having merchants set up their goods along the peristyle. During the Monarchy and a part of the Republic goods sold to the north and south of the Forum (where the Basilicas would not stand for another few hundred years) were mostly food and necessary goods. However, after a decree by Consul Maenius in 338 BC banished all of the butchers and fruit stands from the Forum area, citing the smell, the old shops were replaced with more desirable shops such as bankers, money-lenders, and silver-smiths. Other popular items sold in the Forum were jewelry and gold, clothing, perfumes, bathing oils, and ointments, as well as services such as hair dressers.\n\nAs religious grounds, the Forum held temples and to many important gods, the most sacred and most ancient being the Temple of Vesta. Here the Vestal Virgins kept the sacred flame of Vesta, associated as the protectress of the Roman state during the Republic, burning at all times. Should the flame be extinguished it was taken very seriously as a prophecy for the fall of the nation. In the very center of the temple was the Penetralia, arguably the most sacred site in the entire Roman Empire. Inside were two clay jars, one empty and one containing the holy objects of the Roman state. So secret were the objects that only the Vestal Virgins and Pontifex Maximus knew what was inside, but it is believed that one of the items was the palladium, a small figure brought from Troy by Aeneas after the Trojan War. According to ancient legend the city which held the palladium could not be conquered. The second oldest temple in the Forum, and third oldest in Rome, behind the Temple of Jupiter on the Capitoline, was the Temple of Saturn, worshipped as the god of agriculture. Another of ancient religious sites was the Shrine to Venus Cloacina, built to recognize the Cloaca Maxima.\n\nIt is easy to see the logic in what early Romans felt the need to worship: safety in the Temple of Vesta, and sustainability, in the Temple of Saturn and Shrine of Venus Cloacina. Later religious monuments, constructed when the empire was expanding and no longer concerned merely with survival, recognize this change in building monuments to more warlike gods and to peace and harmony (Precinct of Harmonious Gods, Temple of Concordia Augusta). Finally, during the empire, when Rome was confident of its power and felt it had little to fear, it began to deify its own emperors who had constructed this bastion of power with monuments such as the Temple of the Divine Julius Caesar and the Temple of Antoninus and Faustina.\n\nAs a whole during the height of the Empire, while maintaining all of the above stated day to day functions, the Forum became the symbol of imperial power. New monuments were constructed to celebrate military victories and statues were erected to honor and accolade emperors. Such decoration actually began during the Republic with the ornamentation of the Rostra with the prows of defeated enemy ships and some of the most elaborate monuments we see today were constructed solely for this purpose of commemorating Romes strength and power, such as the Arch of Titus. The importation of new building materials, such as colorful and exotic shades of marble from Africa and the East, signified to Roman citizens just how far the expansive arms of the Empire now reached.\n\nThrough the Republic, with consulships changing hands annually, there was not much time for large scale building plans, and thus during the Republic we see no outstanding patrons, nor specific architectural directions. Instead small uncoordinated monuments seem to spring up everywhere in the Forum, though not in a very permanent fashion. What we do see however is the first episodes of large scale civil engineering undertaken by the state since the Cloaca Maxima with the Via Appia providing paved road from Rome to Brundisium and the construction of aqueducts to give the city running water. While these were not specific to the Forum, they still today attest to the abilities of cooperative Republican power. Built out of necessity, such public works projects remind us of the first projects undertaken during the colonization of Africa during the 1800s and the urbanization of nearly any other rural area.\n\nAt the rise of the Empire under Julius Caesar Rome was now a solidified power controlling the Mediterranean, and there was a need for a single, unparalleled testament to the centralized dictatorship which Caesar secretly envisioned Rome to become. With this in mind, he completely remodeled the Forum to display much more grandeur than before. He constructed a new and impressive Curia, the enormous Basilica Julia, and rebuilt the Rostra to be more daunting than before. Now instead of coming to the Forum and simply seeing a political and commercial center where citizenry met to attend to the days business, one found a place like none they had seen before, demanding the respect owed to the colossal empire. Caesars adopted son and heir, Octavian Augustus, continued the aggrandizement of the Forum, and built a temple deifying Julius Caesar in honor of what he had done for the Republic (as the empire was still living under the guise of a republic). Furthermore he made a point of constructing an overly lavish palace for himself along with a temple for his favorite god Apollo on the Palatine hill. This made the Forum area not only a sign of Imperial power, but also of a sign of the might of the emperor himself.\n\nEach subsequent emperor naturally had the goal of enhancing the Forum in order to capture the hearts and minds of the people. Some succeeded in their works, and some did not, but it is likely that we can tell how a particular emperor fared by studying how well his works fared and if they were in good favor, as this is how closely tied together the two phenomena are. Many of the better off emperors even built their own fora by which they could be personally remembered, example Trajan, whose forum you can read about in another article on this site. The later emperor with the greatest opportunity to shape the Roman Forum was Diocletian who came to power in 284 after the great fire of 283 that demolished nearly the entire Forum. Diocletian used this opportunity to rebuild the Forum as nearly an exact replica of what had stood before, adding only a set of honorary columns, thus showing stability and continuity of the empire along with its growing power, signified by rebuilding what had once stood, but even grander than before.\n\nAlso through careful study of the Forum we realize that development and life of ancient Roman society is not all that different from ours today. In the United States we still build sacred sights, and feel the pain as a nation when they are struck, we have a monumental Capitol, and presidential residence. We put great efforts into our malls and courthouses to make them impressive and construct monuments for our great leaders such as Washington, Jefferson and Lincoln. Just recently was opened in Washington DC a brand new memorial commemorating the sacrifices made for victory in WWII.\n\nFinally, in the Forum we are able see first handedly the 1000 year evolution of one of the worlds greatest societies. To look down into the tomb of Romulus, to walk a few steps and stand where Julius Caesar was assassinated, and to view from the same vantage point where a Roman citizen may have heard Constantine decree Rome to be a Christian empire gives a unique view into the developments of human society. It is easy to see how the Romans incorporated the wisdom of the great Greek society before them into their own idealistic dreams, much as renaissance scholars looked to the Romans for guidance and we studied Renaissance designs to conceive our own interpretations of freedom. As noted above it is a very fine line that separates us from the great Roman culture of antiquity."
