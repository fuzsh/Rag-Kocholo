        "text": "Video\n\nSome of the most exceptional and distinctive buildings from the ancient world were crafted by the architects of ancient Greece and some of their structures like theatres, temples, and stadia became staple buildings in cities and towns from antiquity onwards in the western world. The ancient Greeks are well-known for their incredible Doric and Ionic temples, and none are quite as famous as the Parthenon atop the acropolis of Athens, built under the direction of Perikles and envisioned by the architect Phidias in the fifth century BCE.\n\nThe architectural feature of all, or most, of these buildings, and the one most commonly associated with the Greeks, are columns. There are five of what are called orders of classical architecture, and an order is basically a combination of a type of column either with or without a base and an entablature which is what the column supports, this could be something like a frieze or a beam called architrave. The five classical orders are Doric, Ionic, Corinthian, Tuscan, and Composite though it was not the Greeks, but the Romans who gave them these names.\n\n— SUPPORT US VIA OUR PATREON—\n\nhttps://www.patreon.com/join/whencyclopedia\n\n— BUY OUR MERCH —\n\nhttps://www.worldhistory.store​/​\n\n— CHAPTERS —\n\n0:00​ Introduction\n\n1:03 The Greek Architectural Orders\n\n3:31 Ancient Greek Buildings - Temples\n\n7:13 The Theatre, Stoa, and Stadium\n\n10:43 Outro\n\n— WANT TO KNOW MORE? —\n\nAncient Greek Architecture https://www.worldhistory.org/Greek_Architecture/\n\nColumn https://www.worldhistory.org/column/\n\nGymnasium https://www.worldhistory.org/Gymnasium/\n\nAmphitheatre https://www.worldhistory.org/amphitheatre/\n\nA Visual Glossary of Classical Architecture https://www.worldhistory.org/article/486/a-visual-glossary-of-classical-architecture/\n\nAncient Greek Inventions https://www.worldhistory.org/article/1165/ancient-greek-inventions/\n\n— WATCH NEXT —\n\nThe Early History of the Parthenon, Acropolis and Agora of Ancient Athens\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQxyTq8KJR8\n\nAn Introduction to Ancient Greek Magic and Sorceresses\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T64JgGzeZDk\n\nAncient Roman Art and Architecture https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agbRzU7DZIk\n\nOracles of Ancient Greece https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ktBrKvgk2I\n\n— ATTRIBUTIONS —\n\nYou can find all attribution and credits for images, animations, graphics and music here - https://worldhistory.typehut.com/the-development-of-ancient-greek-architecture-images-and-attributions-11526\n\nThe music used in this recording is the intellectual copyright of Michael Levy, a prolific composer for the recreated lyres of antiquity, and used with the creator's permission.
