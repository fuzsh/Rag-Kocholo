        "text": "Ancient Greek and Roman architecture had a significant influence on the design and perception of structures in Western culture. From the ancient classical ruins to the revivalist movements of the Renaissance and beyond, the architectural concepts and elements created by the Greeks and Romans head to influence modern architects.\n\nGreece is frequently referred to as the birthplace of Western civilisation. Both classical and modern styles continue to draw inspiration from ancient Greek buildings. It’s common to refer to Greece as the cradle of Western civilization. Ancient Greek architecture continues to serve as a source of inspiration for both classical and contemporary designs.\n\nModern architecture is influenced by many of the fundamental components of Greek architecture. Neoclassical, Georgian Revival, Federal, and Beaux-Arts architecture are all heavily influenced by Roman and Greek architecture. A portrayal of two powerful nations and the impact of ancient Greek and Roman architecture on Western architectural traditions has long been the infrastructure concept. This article examines the key traits of ancient Greek and Roman architecture, as well as how they inspired Western architectural traditions and how they are still applicable to contemporary design.\n\nThe Greek and Roman Architecture\n\nThe most tangible architectural legacy from the Greek world has been left by temples, treasuries, and stoas with their various orders, arrangements of columns, and architectural sculpture. It is perhaps ironic that the design of Greek religious buildings has been so broadly imitated in the modern world for such secular buildings as courthouses and government buildings. The Parthenon in Athens, which unquestionably serves as the best example of these splendid Doric and Ionic temple complexes, has undoubtedly influenced the culture of different communities.\n\nThe Romans carried on the Greek architectural tradition; their curiosity is evident in many of their buildings, particularly in their use of the Corinthian Order. Because of the way they suited existing techniques while also embracing new methods and materials, the Romans earned the reputation of “great innovators.” To establish a new architectural style, the Romans used domes and arches. They kept using the Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian orders while modifying the Corinthian capital to make it more ornamental.\n\nThe Parthenon and The Pantheon\n\nThe Parthenon and the Pantheon are both ancient temples. The Parthenon was constructed in honour of the Greek goddess Athena, but the Pantheon was constructed in Rome to honour the Roman gods. Six centuries or so after the Parthenon, which was constructed in 126 AD, the Pantheon was constructed between 447 and 438 BC.\n\nThe Golden Ratio, a mathematical proportion that has been utilized in architectural design since the beginning of time, is perfectly shown by the temple. The Parthenon’s ideal proportions have drawn the attention of architects and mathematicians for millennia. The Parthenon is an outstanding illustration of classical Greek architecture that has inspired plenty of other buildings over the years. The temple is one of the most instantly recognized structures in the entire globe thanks to its timeless elegance and simplicity.\n\nThe Parthenon is a true illustration of symmetry. The temple has a sense of balance and harmony because it is completely symmetrical on the inside and outside. Numerous other ancient and contemporary structures have tried to replicate this symmetry. There you have it—three justifications for the Parthenon’s status as one of history’s most significant structures. You can reckon that the Parthenon had a vested interest in promoting the next structure you see with classical Greek columns or ideal proportions.\n\nExamples\n\nThe United States Supreme Court is a brilliant example of Corinthian architecture. 16 Corinthian columns stand beneath an engraved architrave at the west entrance. A crown of intricately engraved acanthus leaves, typical of the Corinthian order, is placed atop the graceful columns. Greek architecture exudes permanence, authority, and power. A crown of intricately engraved acanthus leaves, a classic of the Corinthian order, is placed atop the graceful columns.\n\nOutdoor amphitheatre construction is largely credited to the ancient Greeks in America. The semicircular amphitheatre at Epidaurus is the forerunner of the contemporary amphitheatre. It was carved into a hillside known for its legendary acoustics. Modern outdoor amphitheatres include the Hollywood Bowl in California and the Hatch Shell in Boston. The amphitheatre was developed by the Romans, and stadiums like the Colosseum were constructed by them. These structures later gave rise to the modern sports venues we are familiar with today. In America, the ancient Greeks are primarily attributed to building outdoor amphitheatres. The amphitheatre was developed by the Romans, and stadiums like the Colosseum were constructed by them. These structures later gave rise to the modern sports venues we are familiar with today.\n\nA magnificent example of how classical Greek and Roman architecture affected Western design, in addition to having an impact on political and religious structures, is the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C. Neoclassical and Italian Renaissance styles were combined to create a masterpiece of architecture in the late 19th century when Paul J. Pelz and John Smithmeyer created this renowned building.\n\nThe Library of Congress’s exterior is decorated with ornate classical motifs. The entrance pays homage to ancient Roman temples with its grand staircase and portico supported by Corinthian columns. A sense of grandeur and intellectual significance is created by the use of classical elements like columns, entablatures, and intricate detailing. Roman basilicas are the source of inspiration for the library’s neoclassical façade’s rhythmic arrangement of arches and windows, which captures the monumental nature and practicality of these ancient buildings.\n\nThe Library of Congress represents the scholarly reputation of ancient Greece and Rome in addition to its stunning architecture. Roman educational, intellectual, and spiritual ideals are reflected in the institution’s dedication to knowledge preservation and dissemination. It demonstrates the long-lasting influence of classical civilisation on the intellectual and cultural traditions of the West.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe architecture of today was shaped by architectural history; both Greek and Roman architecture had a significant impact on many contemporary structures. Even though the majority of their work is quite similar, they persisted in trying many different approaches to architecture to make a statement. If not for the ancient Romans, who were experts in the use of concrete, today’s materials would have been applied in a different way. Modern architecture benefited from the development of both the Greek and Roman cultures.\n\nReferences\n\nFidanci, E.A. (2022) Greek and Roman classical architecture, illustrarch.
