William Howard Taft was the 10th Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, succeeding Edward Douglass White. Taft was also the 27th President of the U.S. and remains the only person ever to hold both offices. (Two of the Associate Justices with whom he served, Justices Willis Van Devanter and Mahlon Pitney, were appointed by Taft when he was President.) Taft was nominated by President Warren Harding on June 30, 1921. He was confirmed by the Senate on the day of his nomination, and he was sworn into office on July 11, 1921. Taft served as Chief Justice until he resigned on February 3, 1930 and was succeeded by Charles Evans Hughes.

Four of the Associate Justices who welcomed Taft to the Court remained there throughout his tenure. These were Justices Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., Willis Van Devanter, James McReynolds, and Louis Brandeis. In 1922, however, Justices John Hessin Clarke, William Rufus Day, and Mahlon Pitney departed. Justices George Sutherland, Pierce Butler, and Edward Terry Sanford replaced them. A close friend of Taft, Sanford eventually died on the same day as the Chief Justice in an eerie twist of fate.

After 1923, the membership of the Taft Court remained largely stable. The only change came in 1925, when Justice Harlan Fiske Stone replaced the retiring Justice Joseph McKenna.

Some decisions by the Taft Court have not stood the test of time. For example, the Court upheld racial segregation in public schools and compulsory sterilization of intellectually disabled people in state institutions, while striking down a minimum wage law for women. On the other hand, the Taft Court produced two of the most pivotal decisions in the history of property law. These established the standard for constitutional challenges to zoning regulations and shaped the principle of regulatory takings under the Fifth Amendment.

In 1922, the Taft Court ruled that professional baseball falls outside the Sherman Antitrust Act, which restricts anti-competitive actions by businesses. The baseball antitrust exemption persists today, allowing MLB to take steps to thwart competitors that other sports leagues cannot.

Topic: Property Rights & Land Use
