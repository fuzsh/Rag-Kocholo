William Howard Taft began his journey to the U.S. Supreme Court when he graduated college in 1878 at age 21. He started his public service career at a local level as a prosecutor and judge. Eventually, after his tenure as President of the United States, William fulfilled his lifelong dream of becoming a member of the United States Supreme Court when in 1921 he was appointed the Chief Justice. He held this role until his death in 1930.
