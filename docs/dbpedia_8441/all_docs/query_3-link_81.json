        "text": "For the first 145 years of the Supreme Court's existence, the head of the third branch of government lacked a permanent home of its own. This exhibition documents the construction of the Supreme Court Building, completed in 1935, and explores the history and tradition which has made it a symbol of Justice in America.\n\nThrough the use of period photographs and objects relating to the early history of the Supreme Court, visitors will learn about the Court’s \"temporary\" homes in various government buildings, the increasing need for the Court to have a home of its own, and Chief Justice William Howard Taft’s role in the construction of the building.\n\nIn addition, the exhibition explores the evolution of architect Cass Gilbert’s design, as well as the sculptural and symbolic treatment used throughout the building’s architecture. Several original plaster models aid in the discussion of the symbolism of this iconic building."
