        "text": "PDF\n\nSitting Presidents and Vice Presidents\n\nPresident Abraham Lincoln1\n\nHouse Judiciary Committee\n\nFebruary 13, 1862\n\n\"President Lincoln today voluntarily appeared before the House Judiciary Committee,\" reported the New York Tribune, \"and gave testimony in the matter of premature publication in the Herald of a portion of his last annual message.\" Lincoln's message to Congress on December 1861 had been published in the New York Herald on the same morning that it was sent to Capitol Hill. The House Judiciary Committee, chaired by John Hickman, investigated the leak and called Herald correspondent Henry Wikoff to testify. Wikoff refused to divulge his source, citing \"an obligation of strictest secrecy.\" Given Wikoff's close friendship with Mary Todd Lincoln, many assumed that the correspondent was protecting the first lady. The committee ordered the sergeant at arms to hold Wikoff. Then the president went to the Capitol for a private meeting with Judiciary Committee members, to assure them that no member of his family was involved. The next day the committee released Wikoff.\n\nVice President Schuyler Colfax\n\nHouse Select Committee to Investigate the Credit Mobilier\n\nJanuary 7, 1873\n\nVice President Colfax appeared voluntarily before the House Select Committee concerning his ownership of stock in Credit Mobilier, a company involved in the construction of federally subsidized transcontinental Union Pacific Railroad. During the previous presidential campaign, in response to newspaper criticism, Colfax had denied that the railroad's agent, Congressman Oakes Ames, had given or offered him stock in the Credit Mobilier. Before the committee, Colfax testified that he had first agreed to buy $500 worth of stock from Ames but later decided against making the purchase; but that Ames never repaid him the $500. Oakes Ames, however, produced evidence of Colfax's check to him for $534 and his check to Colfax for $1,200, the difference being a 60 percent cash dividend.\n\nPresident Woodrow Wilson\n\nSenate Foreign Relations Committee\n\nAugust 19, 1919\n\nMembers of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee took testimony from President Wilson at the White House concerning the treaty of peace with Germany and establishment of a League of Nations. The president opened by reading a statement and then answered questions for three and a half hours, after which the president invited them to stay for lunch. Chairman Henry Cabot Lodge explained that the committee was \"very desirous of getting information on certain points which seem not clear and on which they thought information would be of value to them.\" Despite Wilson's efforts, the Senate twice rejected the Treaty of Versailles, and the United States never joined the League.\n\nPresident Gerald R. Ford\n\nSubcommittee on Criminal Justice, House Judiciary Committee\n\nOctober 17, 1974\n\nPresident Ford voluntarily appeared before the Subcommittee at the Capitol to explain the reasons behind his pardon of former president Richard M. Nixon. Ford insisted that the pardon had not been prearranged, but was the result of his concerns over reports of Nixon's deteriorating mental and physical health.\n\nFormer Presidents\n\nTheodore Roosevelt\n\nHouse Committee on Investigation of the United States Steel Corporation\n\nAugust 5, 1911 (Steel industry)\n\nSenate Subcommittee on Privileges and Elections\n\nOctober 4, 1912 (campaign expenditures)\n\nWilliam Howard Taft2\n\nHouse Select Committee on Budget\n\nOctober 4, 1919 (National Budget System)\n\nSenate Committee on the Judiciary\n\nOctober 5, 1921 (additional judges, Conference of Senior Circuit Judges)\n\nHouse Committee on the Judiciary\n\nNovember 7, 1921 (additional judges, Conference of Senior Circuit Judges)\n\nHouse Committee on Military Affairs\n\nJanuary 19, 1922 (Fort Nathan Hale Park)\n\nHouse Committee on the Judiciary\n\nMarch 30, 1922 (Jurisdiction of the U.S. Supreme Court)\n\nHouse Committee on Claims\n\nApril 26, 1922 (claims of employees of Bethlehem Steel)\n\nHouse Committee on the Judiciary\n\nJanuary 23, 1924 (additional judges for the Eighth Circuit)\n\nHouse Committee on the Judiciary\n\nDecember 18, 1924 (Jurisdiction of the U.S. Supreme Court)\n\nHouse Committee on Claims\n\nMarch 4, 1926 (award to employees of Minneapolis Steel Co.)\n\nHouse Committee on Immigration and Naturalization\n\nMay 1, 1926 (naturalization administration)\n\nSubcommittee of House Committee on the Judiciary\n\nMay 10, 1928 (creating Tenth Circuit)\n\nHouse Committee on Public Buildings and Grounds\n\nMay 16, 1928 (Supreme Court building)\n\nHarry S. Truman\n\nSenate Committee on Foreign Relations\n\nApril 18, 1955 (United Nations Charter)\n\nGerald R. Ford\n\nSubcommittee on the Constitution, Senate Judiciary Committee\n\nMarch 1, 1983 (bicentennial of the U.S. Constitution)\n\n* This list is not exhaustive. New information will continue to be added as it is documented.\n\n. President George Washington testified before the entire Senate on the subject of Indian treaties on August 22, 1789.\n\n. Former President William Howard Taft testified before Congress frequently as a result of his service as co-chair of the National War Labor Board during World War I and Chief Justice of the United States from 1921 to 1930. The testimony listed here relates to legislation and claims before Congress but omits the numerous times Taft testified in support of appropriations for the judiciary."
