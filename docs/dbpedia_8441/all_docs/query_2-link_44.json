        "text": "William Howard Taft began his journey to the U.S. Supreme Court when he graduated college in 1878 at age 21. He started his public service career at a local level as a prosecutor and judge. Eventually, after his tenure as President of the United States, William fulfilled his lifelong dream of becoming a member of the United States Supreme Court when in 1921 he was appointed the Chief Justice. He held this role until his death in 1930.\n\nBelow, print out the pathfinder activity that mimics a path which William took to get to the Supreme Court. Once you're finished, go back and choose another Jr. Ranger activity for William Howard Taft National Historic Site."
