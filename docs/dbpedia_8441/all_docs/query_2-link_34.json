        "text": "Inaugural Address. In the address, the emphasis is on policy--regulation of corporations, tariff reform, strengthening the army and navy, currency laws, Panama Canal, labor legislation. Recommends legislation to address \"the admission of Asiatic immigrants who cannot be amalgamated with our population.\" Concerning the US South, advocates in favor of laws excluding from voting \"both negroes and white not having education or other qualifications thought to be necessary for a proper electorate.\" Expresses approval for \"industrial education of the negro\" to make them \"useful members of the community.\"\n\nIn an historical first, Mrs. Taft accompanies the President in the carriage returning to the White House.\n\nThe Senate confirms all of Taft's cabinet nominations. These included Richard Ballinger (former Mayor of Seattle, and Commissioner of the General Land Office) as Secretary of the Interior. Ballinger's selection was a disappointment to conservationists who had hoped for the reappointment of Roosevelt's Interior Secretary, James R. Garfield. Garfield was closely linked to Gifford Pinchot, chief of the Forestry Service in the Department of the Interior and a friend of Theodore Roosevelt. Ballinger becomes the focus of controversy.\n\nSigns the Payne-Aldrich Tariff Act (36 Stat 11), somewhat decreases tariff rates but less than desired by progressives.. Also creates Court of Customs Appeals and provides for a Board of General Appraisers. The law also includes authority \"to appoint such persons as may be required\" to assist him in the discharge of the duties imposed. This last language (from 36 Stat 83) was used by Taft to establish what he referred to as a \"Tariff Board.\"\n\nIn a Letter to Secretary of the Interior, Richard Ballinger, after reviewing the evidence provided by L. R. Glavis (Chief of Seattle Field Division of the U.S. Land Office) and the Department of the Interior writes: \"It is sufficient to say that the case attempted to be made by Mr. Glavis embraces only shreds of suspicions without any substantial evidence to sustain his attack.\" The President adds that \"you [Ballinger] are therefore authorized to dismiss L. R. Glavis from the service of the Government for filing a disingenuous statement, unjustly impeaching the official integrity of his superior officers.\" See below 11/13/1909.\n\nCollier's Magazine publishes an article by Louis R. Glavis Chief of the Field Division of the General Land Office (Interior), in which Secretary of Interior, Richard Ballinger, is charged with conspiracy in defrauding public land in the Alaska coal fields in 1907-08 during the Roosevelt Administration. At the time, Ballinger was Land Commissioner. This charge implicates the Taft Administration because in 1909 Ballinger is serving as Secretary of the Interior. In 1940 Interior Secretary Harold Ickes publishes the report of an investigation (Not Guilty) that exonerates Ballinger.\n\nFirst annual message to Congress. Regarding foreign affairs, Taft discusses the administration’s approval of the colonization efforts in Africa, the first presidential meeting in Mexico’s Porfirio Díaz, which “signalize the close and cordial relations which so well bind together this Republic and the great Republic immediately to the south,” the protection of American enterprise in foreign nations, and tariff policy. On domestic issues, Taft focuses on creating more specialized and region divisions within the State Department, plans for civil service reform to be “reclassified according to the kind of work, so that the work requiring most application and knowledge and ability shall receive most compensation,” enhancing government efficiency, and efforts to admit Arizona and New Mexico as states.\n\nNominates former New York Governor Charles Evans Hughes to the Supreme Court. The Senate confirms his appointment on 05/02/1910 and he is sworn in 10/10/1910. Hughes resigns from the court in 1916 to become the Republican presidential nominee–the only justice ever to do so.\n\nInternational Court of Arbitration reaches a resolution in a dispute between US and Britain over fisheries in Newfoundland. (Link to pdf volume including the decision of the Court.) An observer called it \"the most notable of the many international arbitrations in which the United States has participated.\" Thus it was an \"encouraging triumph\" for the cause of arbitration in settling international disputes.\n\nRelease of majority report of the Congressional committee investigating the Ballinger/Pinchot controversy. (Link to pdf of the Report of the Special Committee.) The report clears Ballinger of any illegality in disposing of the Cunningham coal claims. The report recommends that Alaskan coal fields not be sold to private interests, but retained as public lands, leased, and developed \"to the benefit of all the people.\" The second point was understood as an endorsement of the Pinchot position on Alaskan coal fields. (New York Times, 12/08/2010, p 8)\n\nLetter accepting the resignation of Secretary of the Interior Ballinger. Nominates Walter L. Fisher as Secretary of the Interior. Fisher was known to be a friend of Gifford Pinchot; had been President of the Conservation League of America and was at the time serving on the Railroad Securities Commission.\n\nThe White House announces large joint maneuvers of Army and Navy troops near Mexico. Although this is simply characterized as \"maneuvers\" newspapers note the failure of the Mexican government to protect the property rights of foreigners in some part of Mexico. This is linked to insurrection against the Mexican government by Yaqui Indians.\n\nIssued orders to the Army Chief of Staff concerning the mobilization and his expectations for the conduct of the troops. The text of the order is reproduced in full in the Third Annual Message. Also in the Message are related communications extending through April\n\nThe U.S. and Nicaragua sign a convention seen as providing a test of Senate willingness to support active intervention to stabilize Latin American governments and advancing \"dollar diplomacy.\" The treaty establishes a \"claims commission\" to adjudicate financial claims by US persons, and provides for a large loan to develop railroads which will be held by a US bank with payments secured by Nicaraguan customs receipts. The customs collector would be selected by the US Secretary of State from nominees provided by US banks. The Senate rejected the agreement.\n\nSigns general arbitration treaties with France and England. The three nations agree to international measures that would reduce armaments and impose economic boycotts on nations who attack any of the three signers. Disputes and claims between the signers will be settled at The Hague, Netherlands. (See the treaty text as reported by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.)\n\nVetoes an act removing tariffs on numerous article in the metal, cotton, wool, and leather schedules. \"The bill is so carelessly drawn that it would inevitably lead to the greatest uncertainty as to what articles are or are not covered. . . \" The veto is sustained in the House on 08/18/1911.\n\nVetoes \"An act to reduce the duties on manufactures of cotton\" noting that it also changes duties on chemicals, oils, paints, and metals. Object that the action was taken without systematic investigation of the effects of the changes, and in some cases without explaining the basis for the changes. The veto was unchallenged. [doc to be added]\n\nTours the western United States. With stops in Nebraska, Colorado, Utah, Idaho, Washington, Oregon, California, Utah, Nevada, Montana, Wyoming, South Dakota, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Illinois. Substantively in remarks he mentions the arbitration treaties (frequently), his intent to enforce the anti-trust act, to act with respect to tariffs, and to pursue peace treaties. On the trip, he visited twenty-six states, a record for presidents up to that point. By one account the trip involved two hundred stops and nearly 400 instances of remarks or speeches. (Kearns, The Bully Pulpit, p. 666)\n\nThe US files an anti-trust suit against the United States Steel Corporation in Trenton N.J. Individual defendants include J. Pierpont Morgan, John D. Rockefeller, Andrew Carnegie, E. H. Gary, and Henry C. Frick. The issues are not judicially resolved until a Supreme Court ruling in 1920. By some accounts, this case deepened the split between Taft and Roosevelt in part because Roosevelt was named in the Taft administration suit as having approved anti-competitive behavior by U.S. Steel.(See: German, J. C. \"Taft, Roosevelt, and United States Steel,\" The Historian, August 1972.)\n\nInforms the Cuban government that conditions in Cuba are a cause of \"grave concern\" to the United States, and that if \"a threatened situation\" is not avoided, the United States will \"consider what measures it must take. . .\" The implication is of US intervention.\n\nThe first two of three thousand cherry trees are planted in Washington DC by First Lady Helen Taft and the wife of the Japanese Ambassador, Viscountess Chinda. The trees are a gift from the city of Tokyo. The planting was little noted at the time.\n\nSigns act creating the Federal Children’s Bureau (37 Stat 79), as an agency within the Department of Labor \"to investigate and report upon all matters pertaining to the welfare of children and child life. This is the first of agency in the world to focus exclusively on improving the lives of children and families.\n\nFourth Annual Message. For a second time, the message is presented on different dates in distinct parts. Part 1 (12/03/1912) is on Foreign Relations; Part 2 (12/06/1912) focuses on Fiscal, Judicial, Military and Insular Affairs; Part 3 (12/19/1912) deals the Departments of Post Office, Interior, Agriculture, and Commerce and Labor as well as the District of Columbia.\n\nVetoes the Webb-Kenyon Interstate liquor Act “After giving this proposed enactment full consideration, I believe it to be a violation of the interstate commerce clause of the Constitution, in that it is in substance and effect a delegation by Congress to the states of the power of regulating interstate commerce in liquors which is vested exclusively in Congress.\" The veto was overridden in the Senate on 02/28/1913 and in the House on 03/01/1913. (37 Stat 699) This is the only Taft veto to be overridden."
