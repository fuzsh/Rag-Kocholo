        "text": "Citation preview\n\nTO COLE, EMMA, DYLAN, AND ABIGAIL\n\nIndex\n\n269\n\nPreface to the paperback edition\n\nIt was late spring 1992 and in Bazoft, a valley deep in the Bakhtiyari Zagros mountains, I signalled to the driver of the jeep to stop at a random group of black tents. We stopped at one of them and were welcomed. After the briefest introduction, I was asked if I was Japanese and when I replied no I was American, the immediate question was about the Rodney King incident and rioting in Los Angeles. My Bakhtiyari hosts had no television, but they did have radios and, moreover, they had relatives who lived in California. In the mid-1960s the Bazoft valley was remote, but 30 years later modern, asphalted roads had made it easily accessible. These same roads had transformed the formidable Bakhtiyari migration of many weeks into a day trip in which, with ease, families transported their flocks and belongings by truck from the winter to summer pastures. Education, military service and Iran’s economic growth, especially in the cities, had brought the Bakhtiyari more outside opportunities and this had resulted in a shortage of shepherds. These newly urbanized Bakhtiyari returned for family celebrations or to help out seasonally. Being Bakhtiyari is changing. In rethinking Khans and Shahs (1983) I am reminded of the importance of the essential bases of history – sources and contexts, including time. Given the political sensitivity of the Bakhtiyari in the Pahlavi period, I was denied access to that region until after the 1979 Revolution. Travelling through that region for the first time in 1992, my earlier notions and ideas were clarified; moreover, I was struck by the extraordinary changes from the government policies of the early 1980s. These observations reinforced my understanding of Bakhtiyari and Iranian history acquired from written sources. While “revolution” has long lost any specific meaning and is used to describe rapid change as well as a process, it nonetheless results in all kinds of unexpected changes. In popular usage, revolution has come to mean dramatic shifts in power and in the elites exercising that power. The Iranian revolution of 1978–9 saw the overthrow of the Pahlavi dynasty and xi\n\nKhans and shahs the establishment of the Islamic Republic of Iran, which resulted in new elites, new policies and institutions that subsequently included a cultural revolution. On the other hand, the 1979 revolution could not have taken place without the Pahlavis’, particularly Riza Shah’s, centralizing policies and the formation of the modern nation-state. It was this evolutionary revolution that set in train the profound changes to the Bakhtiyari – and not only Bakhtiyari elites – and ended their military and political roles, along with those of Iran’s other great tribal confederations. The revolution also brought to an end a decade-long period of research, especially among British and American scholars, which has yet to be re-established. My own research on the Bakhtiyari was suspended with the expectation that it would be quickly resumed. Khans and Shahs ended with the sad note that the whereabouts of the documents upon which it was based were unknown, and with the certainty that a number of them were destroyed and dispersed in the upheaval of the revolution. Furthermore, with the passage of time it became increasingly difficult to re-establish contact with Bakhtiyari families. Death and exile of many of those who had graciously opened their family records to me have taken their toll. The Ilkhani and Hajji Ilkhani families, the two most important of the elite families, had originally allowed me access to family documents on condition I stopped in 1921, for the late Pahlavi period still contained pitfalls for them. Consequently, in Khans and Shahs (1983) I only provided a summary overview of post-1921 Bakhtiyari history. Stephanie Cronin helps fill in the details in that time period in her Tribal Politics in Iran: Rural Conflict and the New State, 1921–1941 (2007), and several anthropological studies cover the late 1960s and 1970s, most notably Jean-Pierre Digard’s Technique des nomads baxtyâri d’Iran (1981). In 1992, my thinking moved back and forth across the twentieth century and through the cliché of continuity and discontinuity to arrive at some conclusions that reconciled texts with what I was seeing for the first time. Importantly, central to Bakhtiyari history are four interacting factors. These are the geographic and administrative region; the pastoral nomads particularly associated with it; social and political leadership, historically the elite families’ surviving written sources; and the Iranian government. The tribespeople or nomads have experienced different patterns of twentieth-century change from their elite leadership. Increasingly, and beginning with the Constitutional Revolution of 1905–9, the elite leadership assumed national political, economic and government roles as they moved from the Bakhtiyari to Tehran, and to a lesser extent to Isfahan. Even after Riza Shah destroyed the power of the khans in the Bakhtiyari and imprisoned and executed leading khans in the early 1930s, they continued to serve a patronage role between the government and xii\n\nPreface to the paperback edition tribespeople until after the 1979 revolution when that role was institutionalized and brought under direct government control in the Organization for the Nomadic Peoples of Iran. The Islamic republican government has attempted to suppress even the historical memory of that earlier leadership – for a time the title “khan” (the common male honorific) was not even used in the Bakhtiyari. Similarly, tribesmen with close ties to the khavanin-i buzurg (lit. the great or elite khans) benefited economically and likewise moved out of the Bakhtiyari, but the majority of tribespeople continued pastoral nomadism, even while the Pahlavis were incorporating them into their wider policies and even though attempts at forced settlement failed. Later, other government policies on education and economic development had a more gradual, if more profound impact that increasingly afforded the Bakhtiyari people opportunities in Khuzistan, Isfahan and other regions. These observations reinforce key generalizations that continue to be important. Pastoral nomads depend on a range of strategies and options for survival; second, pastoral nomads require security so that they can plan and exercise those options; third, nomads function within a specific social framework – their own and that of a larger society – that cannot be ignored; fourth, until recently planners who have been frustrated in the failure of the agricultural sector to meet economic goals and who, in many cases, regard pastoral nomads as primitive and out of place in a modern society, have designed the policies that affect pastoral nomads and agriculturalists; and fifth, policies always have significant unexpected consequences. As I drove through Chahar Mahall/Bakhtiyari, the present administrative nomenclature for the traditional Bakhtiyari summer pasture region (the winter one is still largely in Khuzistan province), I realized from the extraordinary geographical complexity and richness of that region that it constitutes an ecosystem. To the east is the drop-off to the central Iranian plateau and Isfahan; to the north is the Zayandah River and the province of Luristan, access to which the massive mountains of the Kuh Rang watershed limit; to the west – essentially on a northwest to southeast diagonal that follows the Zagros mountains and the Karun River – is Khuzistan, the uplands of which include the Bakhtiyari garmsir (winter pastures); and to the south are Boir Ahmad, Kuh Giluyah and Fars. The enclosed region includes vast and rugged mountain ranges, narrow valleys and broad plains. The climate is varied and the area is well watered, which allows for a broad range of plants, shrubs and trees. While agriculture, which pastoral nomads also practise, is typically based on wheat, barley, arboriculture, viniculture and truck farming, rice culture is possible in deep and narrow valleys. This region also includes a far greater variety of xiii\n\nKhans and shahs people, cultures and societies, as well as of cities, towns, villages and nomadic encampments than I expected. Despite the diversity of Chahar Mahall/Bakhtiyari, there is a unity in the physical geography that encourages human interaction. This can be seen most graphically in the Bakhtiyari migration that follows trails and roads from Khuzistan through narrow passes to Chahar Mahall. These trails have since become highways that link Khuzistan to Isfahan and to other parts of Iran. Variety and unity can also be seen in the relationships established between pastoral nomads, agriculturalists and the market communities in Chahar Mahall/Bakhtiyari. The interaction between pastoral nomadism and agriculture is complementary but it can also be a source of friction. Settlements may have increased recently – one has only to look at the phenomenal growth of Shahr-i Kurd and other towns even since the revolution – but I suspect that we have underestimated agriculturalists and towns in this region historically. A related observation, and one to which I shall return, is the importance of options for pastoral nomads. Pastoral nomads have no or little control over critical factors such as changes in the weather or government policies. Precipitation is critical for agriculture and for pastures. Changes in land usage in the last two decades have resulted in increased competition between pastoralists and agriculturalists for scarce resources. Consequently, vulnerability and competition have resulted in increased diversification. One nomad, for example, possessed 1000 head of sheep and goats, agricultural lands and trucks that he used in trade to Khuzistan. He also had four sons, two with him in the sardsir (summer pastures) to manage flocks, one who was in the military and another at university. Indeed, the shortage of shepherds has become a chronic problem. This pattern has several variations, including sons who worked in Kuwait or in Iranian urban centres, who would return to help out periodically; resources could be shifted if setbacks or losses were to be anticipated. Again, in moving through Chahar Mahall/Bakhtiyari and talking to nomads and agriculturalists, I became aware of a number of their qualities. Their self-respect and sense of dignity, their skills and expertise as pastoralists or agriculturalists, and the importance of the underlying social structure immediately struck me. Even from the most casual observation I became aware of their responsiveness to changes in the market. This can be seen in the nomads’ and agriculturalists’ greatly increased number of flocks, and in the expansion of arable land through either irrigation or extending fields to higher elevations. One can also see that new fields are being cleared of rocks, arable land is being expanded through terracing, and numerous new orchards are being planted. It is no surprise to hear pastoral nomads ask a stranger what his tayafah xiv\n\nPreface to the paperback edition – a tribal level or clan designation – might be, but I was struck by how often settled, even urbanized, Bakhtiyari asked the same question. I understood for the first time what the long lists of tayafahs in nineteenthand early twentieth-century written sources signify. The names of the tayafah – and subgroups such as mal (camping unit) or tirah (clan) – are codes that represent and relate the individual to the world, structure social and economic activity, and permit shared responsibility and support – even in cities, outside the Bakhtiyari and pastoral nomadic context. The individual becomes identifiable and new relationships can be established on the basis of tayafah without having to go back to yet another starting point. Tayafahs, thus, establish a kind of moral solidarity in the face of uncertainty, whether that uncertainty is in the pastoral nomadic sector or in an urban setting. One last point here relates to the observations I made regarding appropriate technology and administration. The period since the revolution has seen construction of roads and small-scale irrigation projects – leaving aside the massive Kuh Rang Dam, irrigation system and power project in Chahar Mahall – the provision of veterinary services for animals, education and health care for the human population, research on animals and plants, and the administrative structure provided by the Organization for the Nomadic Peoples of Iran. Such modest inputs and projects have had a significant impact on the well-being of the Bakhtiyari and people of Chahar Mahall/Bakhtiyari and have facilitated production and trade by reinforcing indigenous practice and values. I cannot conclude this section on my observations without noting their impact on my understanding of Bakhtiyari history. The geographical limits of Chahar Mahall/Bakhtiyari were made even clearer to me and resolved several historical problems. I had long suspected that the origin of power of the family of Husain Quli Khan, the first Ilkhani of the Bakhtiyari and generally known by that title, came from their large landholdings in Chahar Mahall, which are identified in eighteenth-century documents, especially in the rich agricultural area of Mizdij. Estates there and in Khuzistan were to be linked with the Bakhtiyari pastoral nomads through Husain Quli Khan Ilkhani for the first time. Similarly, his conflict with Muʿtamid al-Daulah, governor of Fars, over Falard at the southeast corner of Chahar Mahall – currently part of the province of Chahar Mahall/Bakhtiyari – was a critical one for the Qajars. Had Ilkhani succeeded in controlling Falard, he would have had a base from which to expand his power to encompass Boir Ahmad-Kuh Giluyah and to threaten Fars. Significant changes have occurred in the Bakhtiyari since Ilkhani’s execution in 1299/1882, and he would hardly recognize today’s even more xv\n\nKhans and shahs complex social and political structures. Long before his death, Iran’s integration into the expanding world market and the resulting commercialization of production had affected Iran’s pastoral nomads. Subsequent large-scale transformations have had significant economic and political ramifications. The Qajars began tentative centralization of the state, which the Pahlavis would consolidate. Along with the consolidation of state power and more recent state changes, has come the problem of shrinking resources and competition for them. In addition, industrialization and urbanization have affected the nomads. In a variety of ways nomads have responded to world markets, commercialization, the rise of the state, the development of the nationstate with its new identities, the consolidation of state power, shrinking resources, industrialization and urbanization. New opportunities for economic investment, employment and capital accumulation affect social stratification and the responses nomads make. We should remember too that some policies and factors facilitate while others hinder pastoral nomadism. Iran’s pastoral nomads do not live in isolation, in fact they never have; they participate in and are affected by all the changes in the larger Iranian society and culture. I would like to go back in time to address what it was like to be Bakhtiyari from the vantage point of 1862, 1921 and 1962 before returning to 1992 and the present. In AD 1862 Nasir al-Din Shah awarded Husain Quli Khan the title and office of “Nazim of the Bakhtiyari”. The firman that made that award was the earliest extant document to recognize the Bakhtiyari as an administrative and political unit. Then in AD 1867 Nasir al-Din Shah, through another firman, granted the title of “Ilkhani” to Husain Quli Khan. This firman provided the first documentary evidence of the Bakhtiyari office of ilkhani and confirmed the hierarchical structure of the Bakhtiyari when it called on other Bakhtiyari leaders to recognize the suzerainty of Husain Quli Khan. In effect, the central government recognized a single Bakhtiyari confederation. The modern Bakhtiyari identity that encompasses tayafah ones, dates from this period when Ilkhani unified his power and the Bakhtiyari. In these two firmans the Qajars acknowledged Husain Quli Khan’s success in establishing and consolidating his power over the Bakhtiyari. Nasir al-Din Shah and his governors apparently hoped to use Husain Quli Khan to maintain order, provide cavalry and remit taxes. In effect, the government sought greater efficiency through a single administrator of a unified Bakhtiyari; and it was more efficient. For example, from 1867 until Ilkhani’s execution in 1882, general order prevailed and the Bakhtiyari economy, despite the severe drought of the 1870s, improved. Later, after the Karun River had been opened to commerce in 1888, the xvi\n\nPreface to the paperback edition Iranian government and Bakhtiyari leaders agreed to employ Lynch Brothers to develop the Bakhtiyari Road in 1897. This road linked for the first time the Persian Gulf and Khuzistan with Isfahan and the central Iranian plateau through the Bakhtiyari. (The current highway between Isfahan and Khuzistan follows the original Bakhtiyari Road, which is sometimes referred to as the Lynch Road.) Horses and mules became important not only as pack animals for the new road and internal trade, but also for export to India and Africa. Before his death, Ilkhani had sought to improve animal bloodlines. Subsequently, and even more importantly, in 1905 these same Bakhtiyari leaders signed an agreement to allow the first oil exploration and development to take place in the Bakhtiyari garmsir. Like the road agreement, the various oil agreements could not have gone ahead without Bakhtiyari unity and government (now British) support for that unity. Bakhtiyari commoners were employed as workmen in the fields and as guards on the pipeline. The khans were given oil shares and income and, in turn, they reinvested much of their capital in the Bakhtiyari, Chahar Mahall and Khuzistan, which affected the lives of ordinary Bakhtiyari. On the other hand, even before Husain Quli Khan’s death, Qajar recognition of his consolidation of power posed a threat to them and their rule. This was an unexpected but feared consequence of Bakhtiyari unification under an ambitious ilkhani who could rally armed and mounted forces. The Qajars faced similar challenges from their recognition of comparable tribal confederation leaders. In the case of the Bakhtiyari, the confederation was weakened for only a short period after Ilkhani’s death. From the time of the Constitutional Revolution – specifically the victory of the constitutionalists under Bakhtiyari leadership in putting down the 1909 attempted coup – until the middle of the 1930s, the Bakhtiyari elite khans played powerful national roles (and could effectively challenge the central government). The year 1921 marked the rise to power of Reza Khan, subsequently shah in 1926, and the establishment of the modern nation-state. After reuniting Iran, the new Pahlavi ruler sought to centralize, industrialize and Westernize the resultant nation-state and to provide a new identity for its people. Great tribal confederations, like the Bakhtiyari, were perceived as not only a military and political threat to the government and national unity – particularly because of their British ties – but also as anachronistic in the modern era. Pastoral nomads were not found in the West and government policy sought to turn those in Iran into settled farmers and industrial workers. Furthermore, tribal and other identities were seen as competing with new Iranian nationalist ones and attempts were made to remove them. Urban antagonism towards Iran’s tribes may xvii\n\nKhans and shahs have been intensified in this period over the issue of identity and the various tribes’ relationships with nationalism. From an urban perspective, pastoral nomads were now not only rustics, whose loyalties to the nation were questioned, but also uncivilized. In addition, the educational and cultural reforms implemented in cities widened the urban–rural and pastoral–nomadic gap. Throughout the 1920s and early 1930s Reza Shah went through a sequence of co-opting tribal leaders, disarming the tribes, imprisoning or executing their leaders, imposing military administration over tribal areas and finally adopting forced settlement policies. No government inputs were provided and the economic impact of what were essentially political and military policies was not considered. The government showed no understanding of pastoral nomadism let alone concern for the costs to pastoralists. Drought and the imposition of new taxes and compulsory military service exacerbated the impact of such consequential changes. The tribes never again successfully challenged the centralization of the nation-state and the political and economic power of the tribal leaders was greatly weakened. Even before 1941 and the abdication of Riza Shah, pastoral nomads resisted forced settlement and many returned to nomadism. What the government achieved was at a great cost to pastoral nomads in terms of human and animal life and to that sector of the economy. There were unexpected consequences for Iran’s economy as a whole, which in the 1920s and 1930s was still predominantly agricultural. The effects of these dislocations in terms of reduced income to the state, decreased amounts of capital and shortages of essential foods affected Iranians long after 1941. The first phase of land reform was initiated in 1962. The initial goal was to redistribute land to peasant landholders with a view eventually to increasing agricultural production and raising the rural standard of living. The initial phase and aspects of subsequent ones may have taken into account economic and social factors and could have been positive. Successive additions, however, were made to what was styled the “White Revolution”; and these were increasingly based on political decisions. Additions to the White Revolution included nationalization of pasture and forest lands, which ultimately had a major impact on pastoral nomads and increased competition between nomads and agriculturalists. Repeated and basic changes to land reform per se and to the government’s role in agriculture led to increased vulnerability on the part of food producers. This uncertainty, more than any other factor, resulted in the failure to meet agricultural planning goals. It also fed the rural flight to cities, which then resulted in the weakening of the rural social order and the loss of critical skills. xviii\n\nPreface to the paperback edition Not only did changes in the government’s land and agricultural policies increase uncertainty, but its decision to subsidize food imports to offset declining food production also added to the problem. Three factors in particular led to the decision to subsidize food imports to meet the increased demand of a growing population and a rising standard of living in urban areas. The first was frustration at the agricultural sector’s failure to meet its planning goals. The second was the shah’s hubris and increased sense of power from the mid-1960s onwards. And third, increased oil revenues made it possible to implement food subsidies as well as many other policies. The government also had a political incentive to subsidize food imports. It was anxious about rural–urban migration and all the changes wrought by industrialization and modernization, for which a labour force was required. Subsidized food imports would meet increased demand, keep prices low and maintain social and political stability. The attractions of urban life and increasing migration to urban centres, where peasants and tribespeople sought greater economic security through better jobs and higher incomes, further exacerbated the uncertainty. It has been argued that the government and planners deliberately encouraged rural–urban migration because the mechanization of agriculture would make it more efficient and those displaced would provide a labour force for the economy’s rapidly expanding industrial and service sectors. The erosion of rural society and the loss of valuable skills were among the unexpected consequences of these land reforms and agricultural policies. Despite criticisms about the productivity of Iranian peasants and pastoral nomads, when all the factors that make up Iran’s agricultural sector are taken into account they were remarkably skillful and sophisticated. The government’s changing policies and failure to provide adequate inputs, except to agribusinesses, heightened rural insecurity and economic vulnerability, with the result that the agrarian structure and its supporting social system disintegrated. With subsidies for food imports, agricultural and pastoral production simply became unprofitable. The government’s policies not only resulted in rural flight but also led to major urban problems and a worsening of political and economic conditions, which ultimately brought about the Islamic revolution. Many factors undermined Iran’s economy and social base. Iran exported oil on the world market and, to give but one example, the income derived from it paid for cheaper imported food. Furthermore, the state’s industrial policy undercut the agricultural sector. One response by those who were impoverished was to migrate to the cities; another was to increase the number of dependants able to produce more food or income. This, in turn, resulted in intensification of land use and competition for rural resources. A cycle was created that increased urbanization and the commercialization xix\n\nKhans and shahs of agriculture, yet also led to the destruction of rural society – a process commonly seen in the West. Given such changes, what does Bakhtiyari mean? This takes us back to 1992. Part of the answer lies in those who remain pastoral nomadic in that by sustaining their economic viability they are able to maintain the necessary social and economic bases in the face of continued change. Without that viability, pastoral nomadism would become increasingly marginalized and the Bakhtiyari as a pastoral nomadic cultural artefact would not be “Bakhtiyari” except in memory. On the other hand, because of the profound changes that have taken place, large numbers of Bakhtiyari no longer function as pastoralists and base their futures on the education and opportunities available in urban contexts. Despite significant changes in the twentieth century, traditional values and identities have persisted in pastoral nomadic society because their basic economic and social units have been remarkably flexible and responsive to change. Nevertheless, and despite emigration, a Bakhtiyari memory and history has persisted. It can be seen in the continued use of the Bakhtiyari dialect and oral tradition, in a sense of place and even in the migratory cycle between pastures; it can be seen in lineages, family alliances and marriage patterns, as well as in the material culture, including dress, carpets, lion funerary monuments, cultural associations and publications. Interestingly, although Bakhtiyari, even if far removed from the region and from pastoral nomadism, identify themselves as such, there has been no Bakhtiyari nationalist movement. In terms of national identity, Bakhtiyari readily identify as Iranian – a precedence that goes back at least to the Constitutional Revolution and Hajji ‘Ali Quli Khan Sardar As’ad’s role in it as an Iranian nationalist leader. The most recent Bakhtiyari to play a major governmental role was Shapur Bakhtiyar – appointed prime minister by Muhammad Riza Shah’s in the last days before the fall of the monarchy – and who owed the appointment not to being a member of an elite tribal family but to his impeccable nationalist credentials. Also, despite their strong identification with a region and its economy, there has been no demand for Bakhtiyari autonomy within the Iranian state. Tribal structures continue at the basic socio-economic level among Bakhtiyari who still practise pastoral nomadism and they continue culturally for those who do not. A distinct Bakhtiyari identity persists, even among those who are sedentarized and urbanized, but at a level of representation that is acceptable to the Islamic Republic. This identity is comparable to a regional, even nostalgic, cultural identity that poses no potential threat to their national identity and loyalty – in other words, Bakhtiyari adaptation continues. xx\n\nIndex\n\n269\n\nFurther reading\n\nThe two decades preceding the 1979 Revolution and formation of the Islamic Republic of Iran, when access to research and field work was curtailed, now stand as something of a golden age for the study of the tribes and pastoral nomadic peoples of Iran. Moreover, the social sciences generally were greatly expanded during the 1950s and 1960s, and linked with development theory. The importance of Iran’s tribes had long been recognized by historians, if in a general way, but in those two decades, anthropologists would take the lead through their field work. One monograph, in particular, Fredrik Barth, Nomads of South Persia: The Basseri Tribe of the Khamseh Confederacy (Oslo/London, 1964) provided both inspiration and a model for that new generation of research. Similarly, within Iran, universities and government centres recognized the need for data and studies of rural society and leadership and valuable support was exercised in this endeavour by scholars such as Dr Nader Afshar-Naderi. Also of critical importance was the establishment of the British Institute of Persian Studies in Tehran. Its director, David Stronach, and library became central for all scholars working in Iran, particularly in archaeology and anthropology. Too few monographs resulted from the extensive research across Iran during those two decades but would include notable contributions such as: Richard Tapper, Pasture and Politics: Economics, Conflict and Ritual among Shahsevan Nomads of Northwestern Iran (London, 1979) and then his Frontier Nomads of Iran: A Political and Social History of the Shahsevan (Cambridge, 1997); William Irons, The Yomut Turkmen: A Study of Social Organization among a Central Asian TurkicSpeaking Population (Ann Arbor, 1975); and Lois Beck, The Qashqa’i of Iran (New Haven, 1986). Research of the late 1960s and early 1970s would subsequently be published by Jacob Black-Michaud, Sheep & Land: The Economics of Power in a Tribal Society (Cambridge, 1986); Daniel Bradburd, Ambiguous Relations: Kin, Class, and Conflict among Komanchi Pastoralists (Washington, DC, 1990); and Philip Carl Salzman, Black Tents of Baluchistan (Washington DC, 2000). Both Tapper and Beck included significant historical backgrounds and 193\n\nKhans and shahs contexts in their publications. Significantly, Stephanie Cronin’s Tribal Politics in Iran: Rural Conflict and the New State, 1921–1941 (London, 2007) and Arash Khazeni’s forthcoming book, “The Open Land: Tribes and Empire on the Margins of Qajar Iran, 1800–1911” (Washington University Press) added, or will add, important and larger historical contexts for understanding the pastoral nomadic peoples of Iran. Other histories, too, have been published ranging from the thirteenth to fourteenth centuries in John E. Woods’ The Aqquyunlu: Clan Confederation, Empire Revised and Expanded (Salt Lake City, 1999) to Pierre Oberling’s The Qashqa’i Nomads of Fars (The Hague, 1974) that focuses especially on the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The absence of monographs by Western scholars of pastoral nomadic peoples in Iran’s late Pahlavi or Islamic Republican periods reflects political obstacles, while Iranians have continued research and publications. Fars Province has received considerable attention, and Beck has continued research there after the revolution and published Nomad: A Year in the Life of a Qashqa’i Tribesman in Iran (Berkeley, 1991). Significantly, Iranian Kurdistan continues to be understudied, but has been included in more general works on the Kurds, such as Martin van Bruinessen’s Agha, Shaikh, and State: The Social and Political Structures of Kurdistan (1978; London, 1992). Importantly, Kurds and Kurdistan represent daunting complexities in terms of pastoral nomadism, tribal organization, and interaction within large social and political contexts. Women are central in pastoral nomadic societies, and their roles in them are analysed in important articles by Lois Beck, Erika Friedl, and Nancy Tapper/Nancy Lindisfarne included in collected essays such as Lois Beck and Nikki Keddie’s pioneering Women in the Muslim World (Cambridge, MA, 1978). Religious practice of pastoral nomadic peoples is also underrepresented in monographs, while receiving mention in individual studies, or again as articles, for example Ziba Mir-Hosseini’s on the Ahl-i Haqq of Kurdistan. Similarly, popular culture has received scant attention, but for Sekandar Amanolahi and W.M. Thackston, Tales from Luristan: Tales, Fables and Folk Poetry from the Lur of Bala-Gariva (Cambridge, MA, 1986) or similar works in Persian. Amanolahi has numerous Persian publications on the tribes of Luristan and Fars, as do his students. The study of Bakhtiyari material culture was pioneered in Jean-Pierre Digard’s Technique des nomads baxtyâri d’Iran (Cambridge1981) and Bakhtiyari carpets and carpet-making has received splendid treatment in Peter Willborg’s coffee-table-sized Chahar Mahal va Bakhtiari: Village, Workshop & Nomadic Rugs of Western Persia (Stockholm, 2002). Equally over-sized but an invaluable overview of Iran’s nomadic peoples would be The Nomadic Peoples of Iran (London, 2002) edited by Richard 194\n\nFurther reading Tapper and Jon Thompson with its fine photographs by Nasrollah Kasrarian and the most up-to-date bibliography on Iran’s nomads, in all languages, including many Ph.D. dissertations, otherwise difficult to locate. Here, too, Nomadic Peoples of Iran covers the major regions and peoples – often, not represented by monographs – in essays written by leading contemporary scholars, including a too brief sample of the late David Brooks’ extensive field work and analysis of the Bakhtiyari. Given the range of economies and social and political organization represented in works cited above has given pause as to what is meant by pastoral nomadism and tribalism and how such organization expressed itself in history, especially in relation to the state. And these concerns have been explored at conferences and in publications that focus on both theory and practice, notably in Richard Tapper, ed. The Conflict of Tribe and State in Iran and Afghanistan (London, 1983); Philip S. Khoury and Joseph Kostiner, eds, Tribes and State Formation in the Middle East (Berkeley, 1990); and at the ‘International Conference on Nomadism & Development: Survival Strategies & Development Policies’, Shahr-i Kurd, Chahar Mahal, Iran, 1–6 September 1992. Only a limited number of the papers from this conference have been published, but this conference sponsored by Dr ‘Ali Ghanbari, Deputy Minister and Director of the Organization for the Nomadic Peoples of Iran brings us back a half century ago to the renaissance in study of Iran’s nomadic peoples of the 1960s and 1970s and its relationship of research to development and where we began.\n\n195\n\nIndex\n\n269"
