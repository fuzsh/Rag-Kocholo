On the one hand, such a notion provides us with a certain amount of definition and precision to the otherwise ambiguous and sporadic nature of the human experience. The cosmological nature that surrounds the notion of a final reckoning between good and evil—between the moral perfection of God triumphing over the anti-God, the embodiment of all that is evil in the world—is perhaps the most compelling of all human conceptions. It offers final solutions to seemingly unanswerable questions about the meaning of life. And generates a profound sense of renewal and inspiration that humans are generally incapable of otherwise sensing in the temporal world. On the other hand, the anticipated achievement of this final epoch of paradise and absolute freedom leaves us profoundly bewildered, restless, and overwhelmed. There are simply too many unanswered questions. Will there truly be an end time? If so, when will it happen? What will be its nature? What will follow? And perhaps most important, what role will humans perform in such an event? What should be done to prepare the way for the final days? Will humans be actively involved in events or merely innocent bystanders? Such questions sustain our anxiety about our present condition and, at the same time, energize our imaginations about the possibility of a better, or perhaps even perfect, existence following the end time. This is a study of how humankind has attempted to answer some of these questions. It is a study of the relationship between millenarianism and revolution. As such, it will consider the connection between two distinctly different social phenomena, both of which represent what one could consider the extreme within their respective ideological categories. On the one hand, revolution embodies the\n\n2\n\nRevolution and the Millennium\n\nextreme state of sociopolitical behavior, in the sense that through such a process humankind explicitly seeks to thoroughly and radically transform the institutions and values of society.1 On the other hand, if we define ideology as a doctrine regarding the right and wrong ways in which social power and authority can be used and in what direction society should be headed, then millenarianism must be understood to be ideology in its most extreme form.2 It may be described as an ideology of perfectionism grounded in the belief that divinely-inspired power is capable of bringing about a form of heaven on earth. Nonetheless, revolutionary groups and millenarian-inspired sects are compatible extremists. Indeed, they generally share some common characteristics. For example, both revolutionists and millenarians emerge in the presence of pervasive social disorientation—when conditions within the community are abnormal and unsettled, and the polity as a whole is in a state of \"disequilibrium.\"3 Such disorientation may be either perceived or real—it really doesn't matter to the revolutionist or the millenarian. To them, perception is reality. During harsh and difficult social circumstances, both revolutionists and millenarians anticipate massive social change. They come to believe that society cannot continue on under such pressures. Indeed, both revolutionists and millenarians seem to recognize, long before most other people, that society may be in some form of danger; that the end of what now exists may be near. Not only is a complete overturning of existing conditions possible, it is imminent, they are convinced. The ultimate goal of the revolutionist and the millenarian is social rescue and salvation. Nevertheless, both believe that this salvation must be preceded by the complete elimination of what has been before and are convinced that a new era, age, or epoch in history is about to begin—one that will be free of the pain, suffering, and indignation of the previous stage. Finally, the journey of both the revolutionist and the millenarian is expected to end in social harmony, regularity, dignity, and tranquility. Both possess an unshakable belief in the inevitability of their activities, and the sacred nature of their mission provides a lofty and definitive significance to those who participate. Perhaps not surprisingly, the presence of millenarian doctrine has been asserted to be an important component in the process of revolutionary change in both the East and the West.4 It has been argued that millenarian doctrines \"lie at the heart of all revolutions, at least for that inner circle of zealots whom Crane Brinton calls 'the extremists.' \"5 MILLENARIANISM: AN ANCIENT AND MODERN NOTION The first meaning of millenarianism, and the context most often associated with the phenomenon, was a limited, religious-inspired one. The Christian world has always anticipated the end time, and its teachings reflect this expectation. Originally, millenarianism referred specifically to the belief held by some Christians (who literally interpreted the Book of Revelation) that after his Second Coming,\n\nIntroduction\n\n3\n\nJesus Christ will create a messianic kingdom on earth and will reign over it, with the help of a select or \"chosen\" people, for a thousand years preceding the Final Judgment.6 Most human beings, not just Christians, confront the idea of the end of the world at some time or another—connected, in large part perhaps, to the human necessity for coming to grips with one's individual mortality. How each of us comes to rationalize some vague philosophy, whether it be religious or secular in scope, regarding the likelihood and character of the end time—how will it happen? what will take place? when will it occur? what will follow, if anything?—represents our own possible personal brush with millenarianism. It is a powerful concept that is culturally grounded in superstitions, myths, and even magic.7 Nonetheless, it represents the most important manifestation of the uniquely human quality of hope. In recent years the term has been substantially broadened by some social scientists who have attempted to understand millenarianism outside of its religious foundations. Armed with an expanding body of research about non-Christian movements that nonetheless exhibit the characteristics of millenarianism,8 researchers have come to view the phenomenon in increasingly secular terms—as a collective social response to massive upheaval and disorientation such as that engendered by natural disasters or the disorientation resulting from the clash of highly dissimilar cultures.9 As a result, millenarianism is now perceived of in a more liberal sense. In the context of this study, millenarian movements are powerfully emotional social movements whose members anticipate a unique type of social salvationism—an immediate, collective, total, this worldly, supernatural rescue, and subsequent transformation of society.10 Millenarians expect the complete destruction of the existing social, political, and economic order. And they are convinced that such an all-encompassing calamity and social disaster will be immediately followed by a new and perfect society. Nonetheless, it would be a mistake to assume that the millenarian's belief in the inevitability of a perfect world is the exclusive influence on his or her actions. While such a belief dominates millenarians' day-to-day perspective and performs an important function in how they interpret events in the world, it is not the only factor impinging on their lives. Indeed, millenarian expectations never exist in a psychological or social vacuum. They always coincide with and blend into concurrent social influences and inspirations.11 It is this amalgam that, perhaps, contributes to the wide variations in form, scope, and actions of millenarian-inspired groups. Millenarian beliefs, and their adherents, in varying degrees and forms, are present in all true revolutionary upheavals,12 and little scholarship has been devoted to the functional role they tend to perform in such conflicts. It is this void that this study will attempt to fill. Using a comparative analysis of historical events in China, Mexico, and Iran, I will explore the functional role of millenarianism in the stages and process of revolution. I will argue that pervasive millenarian expectations were an important component of all three revolutions. I will identify and expand upon the functions\n\n4\n\nRevolution and the Millennium\n\nperformed by millenarianism in these conflicts and will seek to answer the question: What specific roles and functions does millenarianism discharge as a society accelerates toward and ultimately becomes embroiled in revolution? At first blush it would appear that the twentieth-century revolutions occurring in China, Mexico, and Iran would be unlikely candidates for a comparative study of revolutionary conflicts. After ail, China, existing for centuries in a largely self-imposed insular position in relation to the West and only recently thrust into world affairs through the obtrusive process of European imperialism, would not seem to possess any sort of commonality with the unique, Islamic-dominated culture of Iran, or the ethnic and class conflicts that characterized Porfirista Mexico. However, it is no mere coincidence that revolutions erupted in these three countries early in the twentieth century. These revolutionary conflicts (Iran in 1905, Mexico in 1910, and China in 1911) became episodic upheavals that, particularly in China and Iran, manifested in later revolutionary violence (1927-28 and 1945-49 in China and 1978-79 in Iran), achieved varying degrees of sociopolitical and economic transformation in all three societies, and have affected international events throughout the twentieth century. In reality, these three seemingly diverse states shared many remarkable features that offer us the opportunity for a meaningful comparative study of revolution. The specific, historical focus of this study will be on a comparison of the processes surrounding: (1) the emergence of Chinese Communism, its ascendance to power, and its revolutionary transformation of Chinese society; (2) the Indian component of the Mexican Revolution; and (3) the Iranian Revolution of 1978-79, which resulted in the establishment of the Islamic Republic. Nonetheless, it is important to understand that these specific events did not occur in a vacuum. The revolution that came about in each of these societies may trace its origin to factors that existed prior to the twentieth century and did not end with the cessation of violence. First, the peoples of China, Mexico, and Iran have traditionally been imbued with a powerful sense of historical destiny. Each of these societies had once risen to great power and then declined—the powerful Chinese dynasties, the Aztecs and Mayans of Mesoamerica, and the Persian empire—yet each held on to a firmly settled, unbroken, preindustrial societal framework.13 Second, the intrusion of Western imperialism, as it had in other societies, introduced new socioeconomic and political ideas into China, Mexico, and Iran, ideas that challenged and in many ways threatened their social and cultural systems. Constitutionalism, Christianity, capitalism, and later the Western concept of human rights all represent important examples of Western imported ideas that engendered both intellectual and social stress in all three societies. All three countries, by the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, were experiencing socioeconomic and profound cultural intervention by the Western industrial powers. At the same time, their national political regimes pursued public policies that enlarged and enhanced their political and economic rule over \"traditionally de-centralized\" populations. Also, at the same time, these regimes sought\n\nIntroduction\n\n5\n\nto promote and foster their relationship with the Western great powers in an effort to achieve economic development.14 Yet in all three cases, this development was pursued solely for the benefit of a foreign entrepreneur-host government partnership, and not for the peoples of the nation as a whole. This foreign intervention combined with local government complicity provoked antagonism among the large peasant classes and an emerging labor class that, in all three cases, consisted primarily of former peasants. Discontent among these groups emerged as the result of three primary factors: (1) reduced sociopolitical autonomy, (2) economic dislocation, and (3) the perceived violation and corruption of ancient and sacred social values, mores, and customs threatened by Westernization. Third, China, Mexico, and Iran had each suffered defeat in a disastrous nineteenth-century war with a Western power (the Opium War between China and Britain, the Mexican War with the United States, and a series of wars between Iran and Russia, and Iran and Great Britain). These conflicts left the peoples of these countries both humiliated and bitter. Each country lost important territory to their adversaries. However, perhaps more significant, many Chinese, Mexicans, and Iranians came to perceive of themselves as subjugated by the superior forces of Western imperialism, forces that were casting an increasing influence on their economy and culture. Following their defeat by the British in 1842, for example, the Chinese people were forced (through the provisions of the Treaty of Nanking) to: (1) make burdensome reparations to the British treasury; (2) allow the British, and eventually other Western powers, to establish enclaves in certain major coastal Chinese cities as treaty ports; (3) permit British commercial interests to market opium and other goods in China—a move that exacerbated declining moral values by increasing the incidence of drug addiction and, in addition, significantly weakened the peasant handicraft production system; and (4) permit Western Christian missionaries to proselytize their faith and seek converts in China.15 Such concessions h$d harmful moral and economic effects on Chinese society and significantly contributed to both urban and rural discontent. Fourth, China, Mexico, and Iran were each ruled by powerful, well-entrenched, repressive, autocratic regimes that had become rigidly bureaucratic and corrupt after many years of political control. These regimes dominated all aspects of society, effectively eliminated public opposition, and drove dissident political movements underground. The power of these existing regimes was often identified by a large portion of the national population to be the result of their close association with Western governments. Mohammed Reza Pahlavi, the Iranian Shah, as well as Porfirio Diaz, the Mexican dictator, were both seriously compromised by their close ties with the United States, for example. Indeed, the power of the Shah became almost absolute following a government coup in August 1953, aided by the United States Central Intelligence Agency and British Intelligence.16 In addition, \"American military and economic presence\" as well as the occurrence of a \"large European work force\" were important catalysts for \"mass mobilization\" during the Iranian Revolution in\n\n6\n\nRevolution and the Millennium\n\nthe 1970s.17 The Manchus, who had ruled China for three centuries, were foreigners themselves and, though thoroughly Sinified in their customs, were viewed by many Chinese as alien.18 This foreign domination was deeply resented by a majority of the population in all three societies. A fifth factor—and the focus of this study—was the presence of a lengthy and durable history of pervasive, religiously inspired millenarian beliefs in each of these societies. These beliefs had frequently manifested themselves, since the ancient period, as radical protest movements bent on rebellion, which tended to emerge following episodes of extreme social stress or conditions that had a catastrophic effect on some or all segments of society. An important aspect of this study is not only to identify significant similarities in these three cases, but equally so, to identify important variations and their bearing on the origins and process of revolution. For example, the cultures of these societies were significantly diverse. The religious origins of millenarian beliefs, though similar in concept, emerged from different types of sources. Additionally, the role of the specific movements under analysis—the Maoists, the Zapatistas, and the supporters of Khomeini—varied significantly in their impact upon these upheavals. The Maoists, for example, were central to the Chinese Revolution, yet the Zapatistas, as we shall see, were only a secondary component in the Mexican case. Finally, the consequences of revolution in all three societies varied dramatically. The primary methodology to be employed in this study will be a cross-cultural and cross-historical comparison of three non-Western revolutionary societies that were profoundly impinged upon by European and American imperialism in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Analytically, it attempts to identify and characterize the nature of the millenarian components of all three cases. There is a certain methodological difficulty in transferring sociopolitical concepts localized in time and place to whole societies in which revolutionary change is engendered. Problems arise when one attempts to transfer concepts that are more clear for small, localized movements to whole societies undergoing revolution, where a greater social complexity and competing concepts offer a differing analysis of what is going on. For example, the Chinese Communist revolutionary movement operated at three different levels to transform Chinese society: as an ideology, as a cult of Mao Tse-tung, and as a factional political organization—the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). To characterize it along only one of these dimensions creates the potential for both oversimplification and overgeneralization of its broader characteristics. In an effort to avoid such problems, I seek to identify the nature and composition of competing sociopolitical streams that existed in these societies during the stages and process of revolution. This study will not attempt to advance a general theory of millenarian revolution. Such an undertaking would require an effort well beyond the analysis of merely three cases. Rather, I seek to pursue a more limited investigation that uncovers\n\nIntroduction\n\n7\n\ncommon threads of millenarian-inspired social change as well as variations of revolution in these societies. It is inherent in such a study that it must transcend any single social science discipline. At its foundation, the study of millenarianism is the study of a society's hope for a better future. Millenarians believe that societal perfection, as the result of a divine deliverer at the end time or, as we shall see, the efforts of a chosen people, is possible. An understanding of the functional role that this belief performs in the process of revolution must include not only the facts of these revolutionary events as recorded by the historian, but also the constructs of the political scientist, the anthropologist, and the sociologist, who have studied these events from their individual scholarly perspectives. It is not my purpose, for example, to rewrite the history of these events. Rather, it is my goal to evaluate the available facts regarding these events in an attempt to uncover the millenarian stream that ran through these revolutionary societies. Such an analysis must rely on largely secondary historical sources. And this raises some additional methodological issues. Religion and politics, as we all know, are particularly volatile subjects, even among friends and relatives. Any discussion of these topics usually requires us to bring along our own doctrinal and dogmatic \"baggage.\" And scholars in their search for the truth are not immune to such emotional traps. For example, most of the available firsthand accounts of traditional folk religions in China and Mexico were written by individuals who went to these regions specifically to bring about religious change: Western Christian missionaries. As a result it is often difficult to penetrate doctrinal and ethnocentric biases in an attempt to understand what truly went on or what these cultures were really all about. One of the primary goals of this study is to remain aware that the potential for this methodological problem is not only real but, indeed, very likely to occur. As a result, I pursue and evaluate as many sources and perspectives as possible regarding the critical events leading up to and surrounding the three revolutionary cases. It is important that we distinguish revolution from other forms of social change. Many social movements have sought to improve the circumstances within their societies through such diverse mechanisms as reform or violent rebellion. The difference between these forms of social change and true revolution is found largely in their consequences. Reform movements seek to institute social improvement without revolutionary change. Such movements attempt improvement through the abolition of abusive or defective social conditions. Rebellion, although it involves violence, also leaves the fundamental elements of government and society intact. Rebels bent on change and reform do not seek to alter the foundations of their society. Indeed, in many instances, rebel movements come to perceive of themselves as the protectors of traditional social values against those who seek to destroy them.19 In contrast, a revolutionary movement is a social movement committed to drastically altering or destroying existing institutions in a society. For example, the\n\n8\n\nRevolution and the Millennium\n\nCommunist-led Chinese Revolution transformed China's economy by giving ownership of the country's basic industries to the state, taking it from private individuals. The notion of revolution used in this study involves a complete transformation of a society's fundamental values, its social and political institutions, its leadership, and its public policy.20 Indeed, following a true revolution, few remnants of the previous regime remain intact. It is precisely this transformative aspect of revolutions that makes them such a fascinating topic of study. Why is it that members of a society, who generally look upon any type of change as something to be avoided, are inclined at certain times to willingly, collectively, abruptly, and totally transform the structure of their social institutions—institutions that have often become well entrenched and have developed over long periods of time? THE STRUCTURAL THEORY OF REVOLUTION Since the late 1970s, scholarship about revolutionary conflict, seeking to explain the origins and nature of revolutions, has come to be dominated by structural theorists. Structural theory argues that revolutions are not solely the result of the subjective characteristics of a state—such as commonly held sociopolitical values or pervasive ideological belief systems—but rather, they emerge out of specific objective conditions involving the political, economic, or social structure of the state.21 Structural theorists hypothesize that revolutions are caused by weaknesses in the structural relationships of a society, for example, between political regimes and elites, peasants and landlords, or the state and international actors. Millenarian-inspired peasant rebellions are frequently characterized by structuralists as social agitations that are essentially primitive, archaic, and \"pre-political\" in form. Indeed, they are portrayed as anachronistic, backward-looking, and defensive in outlook. Rather than possessing a radical new vision of a desired new society, it is argued, they primarily seek only to recapture a perceived lost \"Golden Age,\" which they idealize as superior to the present economic and social conditions surrounding them. Participants in such movements are represented as little more than social bandits who articulate sociopolitical goals that are ill defined, naive, vague, and irrational. Peasants, for example, who find themselves caught up in the throes of revolutionary change have been described as simply actors participating in events beyond their control, who are thrust into more important political and social processes occurring independently of them at the center of society.22 In addition, structuralists argue that a phenomenon as involved and complicated as revolution should not be studied merely from its domestic dimensions. Any analysis should include an evaluation of external events, including international institutional structures, that may impinge on the internal affairs of a society: If a structural perspective means a focus on relationships, this must include transnational relations among differently situated groups within given countries. Transnational relations have contributed to the emergence of all social-revolutionary crisis and have invariably\n\nIntroduction\n\n9\n\nhelped to shape revolutionary struggles and outcomes. All modem social revolutions, in fact must be seen as closely related in their causes and accomplishments to the internationally uneven spread of capitalist economic development and nation-state formation on a world scale. Unfortunately, existing theories of revolution have not explicitly taken this perspective.23 Structural theorists assert that revolutions tend to occur in predominantly peasant-based, underdeveloped states that\" find themselves face-to-face with Western imperialism. The inevitable confrontation between two fundamentally different cultural, economic, technological, and military systems in which one is dramatically more advanced than the other creates the potential for transforming change and, thus, revolution. From the structural perspective, the existing political regime in the underdeveloped state is simply incapable of coping with the pressures of such a confrontation. Local popular support shifts to a revolutionary movement that ultimately overwhelms prerevolutionary political structures. The structural perspective has broadened the scope of revolutionary conflict theory and has been an important contribution to its study. Nonetheless, the theory's almost total reliance on structural relationships as the source of revolution and a lack of adequate attention to other important factors, such as deeply held, pervasive values and ideological systems existing in a society, leaves the structural argument incomplete. In his analysis of the Mexican Revolution, for example, Walter Goldfrank identifies four structural conditions that he asserts are necessary and sufficient to account for the outbreak of revolution in 1910. In addition, he broadens his analysis by arguing that these structural conditions were not unique to the Mexican case, but are similar to those conditions accounting for other twentieth-century revolutions. Goldfrank's four structural conditions are: (1) \"a tolerant and permissive world context,\" (2) \"a severe political crisis paralyzing the administrative and coercive capacities of the state,\" (3) \"widespread rural rebellion,\" and (4) \"dissident elite political movements.\" The first three of these conditions interact, Goldfrank asserts, \"to produce a revolutionary situation; the fourth, given the near-automatic existence of alternative contenders, emerges to effect political and social transformation after military superiority is proved.\"24 Similarly, Ervand Abrahamian asserts a structural explanation for the emergence of revolution in Iran. Largely pointing to modernization and rapidly changing economic circumstances, Abrahamian identifies three conditions that he believes brought down the Shah: (1) \"a fiscal and political crisis brought on by the severe inflation of 1975-79,\" (2) \"the opposition of elite groups alienated by the regime,\" and (3) \"organized popular protests.\"25 Jack Goldstone expands upon Abrahamian's argument by asserting that this combination of factors is similar to those behind the English, French, Russian, Chinese, and Mexican revolutions.26 Certain aspects of Goldfrank's and Abrahamian's constructions offer some explanation for the onset of revolution in these sets of conflicts. It is true, for example, that a severe political crisis emerged in Mexico in 1910-1911 over the\n\n10\n\nRevolution and the Millennium\n\nlegitimate successor to the elderly dictator, Porfirio Diaz; in China, when Chiang Kai-shek's KMT, severely weakened by a lengthy and destructive war with Japan, failed to achieve political control in the late 1940s; and, in Iran, when the legitimacy of the regime of the vacillating and terminally-ill Shah was increasingly drawn into question. It is also true that the Great Powers, which had often played a critical role in the internal affairs of both China and Mexico, found themselves, in the second decade of the twentieth century, preoccupied with conditions that eventually led to the outbreak of World War I in the late summer of 1914. Although the United States continued to intervene in Mexican affairs up to 1916, its role diminished after that 27 year. Nikki Keddie argues that in Iran, it was inevitable that some form of public defiance to the Shah's regime was going to occur in the mid-1970s. Nonetheless, both its \"nature and timing were largely a result of the human rights policy announced by American President Jimmy Carter in 1977.\"28 Carter placed an important and (for an American chief executive) unprecedented emphasis on human rights in the world. His positions seemed to indicate that those countries allied with the United States that were violating the fundamental human rights of their citizens might be stripped of U.S. arms or financial aid. As a result, the Shah came to believe that Carter might push hard for human rights in Iran.29 Iranian dissidents drew a similar conclusion, one that fostered the \"courage to circulate open letters and petitions\" in the hope that they might not be as severely repressed as previous activities of that kind had been in the past.30 Carter's position on human rights, although it was not intended to do so, implied a crack in U.S. support of the Shah and, as a result, dramatically changed Iran's political climate.31 The Shah knew that without American aid his regime was doomed. His fears of the withdrawal of American support,32 along with Carter's emphasis on human rights protection for all, provided a new hope to Iranian dissidents that public protests of the Shah's government and its abusive policies would not be met with brutal SAVAK (the Iranian internal security service) repression.33 Consequently, one may argue that a tolerant and permissive world context did exist at the time of revolution in all three cases. In an important way, the structural argument is valid and provides a valuable analytical tool for the further study of revolutionary upheaval. For example, few would disagree with the notion that the disintegration of the central authority of the state, an important structural factor in our three cases, is a critical component in the onset of all revolutions. Yet, isn't such a disintegration symptomatic of much deeper causal conditions? Indeed, what is at the root of such weakness? In addition, what factors are likely to promote the mobilization and organization of revolutionary movements? To explain the onset of revolution in these three cases to be the result of such conditions as \"widespread rural rebellion,\" \"dissident elite political movements,\" \"elite-group alienation,\" and \"organized popular protests,\" is both tautological and incomplete. While it is clear that weaknesses in societal structural relationships may\n\nIntroduction\n\n11\n\nbe effectively argued to account for the emergence of revolutions, attention should also be focused on the antecedents of the weaknesses themselves. Descriptions of rural rebellion and urban protests characterize the often violent nature and widespread discontent associated with revolutionary activities in these societies without explaining their origins; metaphorically, they describe the symptoms of more complex social maladies without identifying the disease itself. For example, what factors engendered widespread discontent and rebellion? Indeed, if such movements were merely rebellions, what factors or conditions transformed these upheavals into revolutions? The willingness of individuals and collective social movements to seek institutional transformation in a society through either nonviolent or violent means involves much more than weak societal structural relationships. The sociopolitical values and ideological belief systems adhered to by identifiable groups capable of mobilization—those most likely to make a revolution—often lie at the foundation of these upheavals and must be taken into account. As a result, it would appear that a more comprehensive and deeper examination of social conditions is required in order to understand the true nature of these revolutions. It is precisely such an examination that this study will attempt. The first chapter attempts to characterize the nature of revolutionary millenarianism through a brief survey of its evolution from the ancient to the modern world. In addition, I assert three necessary conditions for its emergence in a society. Chapter 2 is a comparative historical analysis of the impact of the forces of Western imperialism on twentiethcentury China, Mexico, and Iran. These forces, unleashed over a lengthy period of time, created conditions of extreme social stress in all three cases by significantly disrupting the fundamental components of their culture and economy. I will argue that such a disruption engendered disorientation and anomie34 in these societies and that revolutionary millenarianism emerged as a mechanism to revitalize and reconstruct new forms of social organization to cope with the manifestations of abrupt and substantial change. Chapters 3, 4, and 5 focus on the three functional roles I assert are performed by millenarianism in the stages and process of revolution: (1) a preparatory function, (2) a leadership function, and (3) a therapeutic function. These chapters are organized along thematic lines, although I have attempted to maintain the chronological order of comparative historical events. A durable and pervasive stream of millenarian beliefs existed throughout the traditional period in China, Mexico, and Iran. In all three societies, an ancient and persistent folklore about the end time was ever present. Like an underground river, it frequently bubbled to the surface during periods of dramatic and disruptive sociopolitical and economic change, periods when social structures were under severe strain.35 Over time this tradition has borrowed the symbols and language of different ideologies and organized religions, in all three societies. In China, for example, it has taken on the cloak of traditional folk religions, Taoism, heterodox Buddhism, Christianity, and, in the twentieth century, the Maoist variant of Marxism.\n\n12\n\nRevolution and the Millennium\n\nDespite such transmutations, however, the millenarian paradigm remained essentially intact: a terrible vision of the present world as an evil one ruled by demonic forces that have to be destroyed through a cleansing violence, so that a new age of perfection may be ushered in. In this sense millenarianism paved the way for revolutionary transformation in each of these societies. In the millenarian vision, the forces of justice and righteousness were led by divinely inspired leaders who derived their charismatic powers from the needs and chiliastic yearnings of the people. Millenarianism, thus, acted as a doctrinal platform awaiting the opportunity to elevate a prophet to revolutionary leadership. Finally, millenarianism provided the basis for social healing to take place in these societies. New identities were established in place of those that had been either lost or destroyed in the process of abrupt social change, and an important social catharsis occurred that purged these societies of iniquity and the burdens of humiliation, frustration, and indignation. The twentieth-century revolutions that emerged in these three cases owed more than has been generally acknowledged to their ability to draw these latent millenarian traditions to the surface and shape them in accordance with the exegeses of the moment. It is the goal of this study to shed a more significant light on this important and fascinating phenomenon. NOTES 1. The word revolution was originally used by Italians during the European Renaissance in the sixteenth century to describe the \"revolving\" triumphs of the popular and aristocratic political groups who were continually fighting for control of the Italian city-states. In this sense the term conveyed the idea of a displacement of political power and a restmcturing of government. Prompted by the Enlightenment faith in scientific progress in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, revolution came to be increasingly seen as a tool of sociopolitical progress that was capable of moving a society toward a higher level of social purpose. Indeed, Karl Marx argued that revolutions were both progressive and necessary to dismantle sociopolitical institutions that benefitted from an outmoded and unjust social structure. Cf. John Dunn, Modern Revolutions: An Introduction to the Analysis ofa Political Phenomenon, 2nd ed. (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1989). 2. Ideology is a term that was brought into widespread usage in the early nineteenth century by the French philosopher Antoine Louis Claude Destutt de Tracy (1754-1836). He used it \"in his systematic study of the Enlightenment\" to identify the \"science of ideas\" that he believed had emerged during the period. Nonetheless, it was Karl Marx who, in the nineteenth century, laid the foundation for a different and more progressive notion of ideology. In the \"Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte\" (1852)—although he rarely used the word ideology—Marx argued that ideas shape the ways in which individuals perceive the social world and their positions within it, thus profoundly influencing social and political change. Cf. Leon P. Baradat, Political Ideologies: Their Origins and Impact, 5th ed. (Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice Hall, 1994) and John B. Thompson, Ideology and Modern Culture (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1990). 3. Crane Brinton used the term disequilibrium to characterize a society in a period of profound institutional adjustment. **A society in perfect equilibrium might be defined as a\n\nIntroduction\n\n13\n\nsociety every member of which had at a given moment all that he could possibly desire and was in a state of absolute contentment.\" Nonetheless, \"as new desires arise, or as old desires grow stronger in various groups, or as environmental conditions change, a relative disequilibrium may arise.\" \"This conceptual scheme of the social equilibrium is probably in the long mn the most useful for the sociologist of revolutions.\" Crane Brinton, The Anatomy of Revolution, rev. ed.

Michael Barkun, Disaster and the Millennium (Syracuse: Syracuse University Press, 1986), 184. The millenarian idea of \"total, sudden, imminent, mundane transformation which will abruptly place man in an ideal society is not the property solely of religious thinkers. It is closely related to the secular tradition of Utopian speculation as well.\" See also David W. Plath, \"Foreword,\" in Aware of Utopia, ed. Plath (Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 197 ix-xvi. Brinton, in his classic comparative study of the English, American, French, and Russian revolutions, concludes that \"our revolutionists are convinced that they are the elect, destined to carry out the will of God, nature, or science.... [TJhese revolutionary faiths are very interesting in their eschatologies, their notion of final ends like heaven and hell\" (194). 6. Revelation 20: 4-6. 7. Batson and Vends assert that social influence can be a powerful factor in the religious experience of an individual. \"Just how powerful this process can be was dramatically illustrated when hundreds of members of the People's Temple, after having given up homes and country to move to the jungles of Guyana, obeyed their leader Jim Jones's commands to commit suicide and even to murder their children and reluctant comrades.\" C.

Much research has centered on such non-Christian millenarian movements as the Cargo Cult phenomenon of Melanesia and the Ghost Dance Religion among various tribes of Plains Indians in the American West.

See Cohn, Revolutionary Millenarians 15, and Barkun, Disaster and the Millennium 34-61. Barkun terms the idea that millenarianism is frequently the result of the \"clash of dissimilar cultures\" as his \"colonial hypothesis.\" See pp. 32-33 of the present text. 10.

Of course this 'influence' is neither absolute nor easily separable from the multiplicity of factors that shape popular views on public issues \" 12. This is not to suggest that all revolutionaries or those who seek social justice and equality are always religious fundamentalists, equally inspired by visionary prophets. Such an argument could be interpreted to be a profound discrediting of any movement seeking positive social change and would be invalid. 13.

In 1644, Manchu invaders from the north conquered China and established the Ch'ing (pure) dynast (1644-1911).

Revolutions must be distinguished from \"insurrections, rebellions, revolts, coups, and wars of independence.\" \"A coup d'etat in itself changes only leadership and perhaps policies; a rebellion or insurrection may change policies, leadership, and political institutions, but not social stmcture and values; a war of independence is a struggle of one community against rule by an alien community and does not necessarily involve changes in the social stmcture of either community.\" 21. Marx argued that \"revolution is the driving force of history.\" People, he asserted, mistakenly thought of the enslaving mechanism of society as \"a power alien to them\" and \"a pressure which they have conceived of as a dirty trick on the part of the so-called universal spirit, etc.\" In other words, as a subjective agent. In fact, Marx argues, this enslaving agent is a \"power which has become more and more enormous and, in the last instance, turns out to be the world market,\" that is, an objective agent. The communist revolution would, nonetheless, ultimately come about because capitalism in the world would eventually reach the limits of its contradictions.

In its strictly religious connotation, millenarianism refers to a thousand years and has its origins in Christ's prophesied reign in person, on earth, biblically foretold in the twentieth chapter of Revelation. The concept of messianism is the belief in a messiah, or liberator, who will bring about heaven on earth. The earliest known written reference to a messianic prophecy is in the Old Testament Book of Daniel, written around 165 B.C.1 Besides its Judeo-Christian tradition, millenarianism has also been used as a descriptor for the idea of Mahdiship—the belief in the return of God's messenger to earth (the Mahdi)—common to the Shi'ite and Sunni sects of Islam.2 Islamic millenarianism is similar to the Christian form. Nonetheless, we should acknowledge some differences. Christians anticipate the Second Coming of Jesus Christ at the end of time. Muslims, on the other hand, expect that the Mahdi will \"appear\" or \"rise\" in response to an unbearable secular authority within society. The Mahdi's role is salvation through purification—a return to the sacred teachings of true Islam.3 In addition, Moslems do not anticipate a thousand-year reign of the Mahdi following his return to earth.4 Millenarianism has also been identified as an important element of many traditional religions in Asia, Africa, the South Pacific region, and the preconquest Americas.5 Indeed, it has been argued that few societies may be found in the world that do not possess a belief in the return of a culture hero in some form who will save society.6\n\n18\n\nRevolution and the Millennium\n\nIt is appropriate for us to begin our comparative study of the functional role performed by millenarianism in the stages and process of our three non-Western revolutionary cases by taking a brief look at the evolution of the concept in the Western world. Millenarian expectations and their relationship to revolutions in China, Mexico, and Iran are directly linked to the evolution of revolutionary millenarian ideology in the West in three important ways. First, millenarianism has been an ingredient in all modern European revolutions, and salient comparisons exist between some of these Western upheavals and revolutionary events in our three non-Western cases. For example, symbolic comparisons have been drawn between the Puritan Revolution in seventeenth-century England and the Islamic Revolution in Iran in the 1970s.7 Second, both communism and fascism have been characterized as \"secular religions\" and \"political religions,\" and asserted to be modern, temporal forms of millenarianism.8 Since these ideologies, particularly communism, have had an important influence on twentieth-century revolutions in both the East and the West, it would be a mistake to neglect this important argument. Finally, through the drawn-out processes of exploration and colonization, Western millenarian ideas and doctrines have been exported to non-Western regions and have frequently had a profound impact on local populations. In China, for example, Christian concepts and symbols, particularly the eschatological scheme, which were brought there by Western missionaries, had an intense personal impact on the leader of the massive Taiping Rebellion, Hung Hsiu-ch'uan, and provided an important ideological foundation to the movement he led in the midnineteenth century. In Mexico, the millenarianism of the Spanish Franciscan priests who travelled with Hernan Cortes clashed with existing Aztec chiliasm and engendered a religio-political syncretism that continues to influence Mexican society. Thus, the nature and specific content of millenarianism in the West and, in particular, its relationship to European revolutionary ideology supply us with important points of reference for a study of revolutions in our three non-Western examples. THE REVOLUTIONARY MILLENARIAN PARADIGM From its beginnings, millenarianism appeared as a response to foreign domination, perceived corruption, and cultural imperialism, injected into a society and manifesting an abrupt change in the existing social order. Additionally, it exhibited a profound potential for revolutionary violence. Indeed, the prophecies of Daniel, a centerpiece of Jewish apocalyptic literature,9 emerged in the midst of events surrounding a lower-class Jewish revolt against Greek hegemony over ancient Palestine. For over three hundred years the Jewish community in Palestine lived in peace and security under the rule of the Persian empire. Nonetheless, the victory of Alexander the Great over the Persians, between 334 and 331 B.C, brought the entire Eastern Mediterranean region under control of the Greeks. After Alexander's death,\n\nApocalyptic Prophecy to Millenarian Revolution\n\n19\n\nin the second century B.C, the Greeks placed Judaea under the political authority of the Syro-Greek dynasty of the Selucids. Unlike their Persian predecessors, who had little regard for the local traditions and cultures of the peoples living in the lands they conquered, the Greeks sought to dominate local tribes and villages by assimilating them into Hellenistic culture. The Greeks forced their language, sports, literature, arts, and eventually their polytheistic religion on those who inhabited the lands they conquered in an apparent effort to build unity within the empire. In addition, Greek colonists tended to migrate into newly won lands, also bringing with them their culture and religious beliefs.10 The Selucid effort to assimilate the Judaean region into the Greek culture met with fierce resistance among the Jews. Ultimately it divided the community along largely class lines. For many upper-class Jews, the worldly manners and sophisticated customs of Greek society had wide appeal. Many of them quickly adopted the more secular lifestyle and, in the process, jettisoned their traditional Jewish customs, including their religion. On the other hand, lower-class Jews clung to their traditional ways and came to view the elites as heretics for abandoning their spiritual and cultural life. As a result, a significant religious and political chasm emerged throughout the community. Many Jews feared that their traditional customs, religion, and, quite possibly, their way of life were marked for extinction.11 This chasm between upper-class and lower-class Jews widened significantly when the Selucid monarch, Antiochus IV Epiphanes, banned all public Jewish religious observances. To make matters worse, he ordered that statues of the Greek gods be placed in Jewish houses of worship. Such actions were viewed by traditional Jews as sacrilege. In response, they rose up in what became known as the Maccabean revolt, around 165 B.C In the dream in the Book of Daniel, which was written during the revolt, four beasts were effectively depicted as symbolizing four successive worldpowers, the Babylonian, the Median, the Persian, and the Greek. When the Greek Empire, in its turn, was eventually overthrown, Israel, which was personified as the \"Son of Man,\" was to be \"an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed.\"12 Here we begin to see the dominant characteristics of the revolutionary millenarian paradigm: a foreign world dominated by a tyrannical and immoral power of seemingly demonic dimension that disrupts and threatens the way of life of a devout and deeply ethnocentric people. The subjugated people, generally occupying the lower strata of society, believing themselves to be saints on earth—God's chosen elect—come to oppose this worldly tyranny and seek to defeat it. Victory, which is viewed as inevitable and according to God's plan, represents the final denouement of history manifested in the Kingdom of the Saints—heaven on earth.13 Later millenarian movements that emerged concurrently with religious dissent in Western Europe in the medieval era demonstrated a similar character. Prompted by a growing dissatisfaction with an increasingly corrupt and unresponsive church,14 peasant movements led by charismatic prophets began to appear, demanding moral reform.15\n\n10\n\nRevolution and the Millennium\n\nEventually, these wandering preachers attracted particularly devoted foilowings and often came to be perceived as living saints or the returned Messiah. In some cases, these groups developed into a full-fledged social movement that was distinctly millenarian. These movements found their most receptive audience in those areas that were becoming seriously overcrowded and undergoing rapid social and economic change.16 Traditional agrarian socioeconomic systems were in the midst of powerful change in response to early industrialization. Faced with the development of basic industries (such as textiles), rapid population growth, and overcrowding resulting from rapid urbanization, these societies were in the nascent stages of modernization. Such a transformation brought cultural shock and disorientation, disrupted the existing socioeconomic order, and had a powerful impact on* traditional life.17 Social change has always created social dislocation and normative disturbance. Dislocated groups and individuals who feel the impact of profound change eventually need to be effectively blended into the new social structures that emerge as a result of such change. At the same time, these groups and individuals may also demand that they be included in the emerging new political system. Political movements that inevitably appear on the scene to meet these demands have often been a major contributing factor in the occurrence of revolution.18 Revolutionary millenarianism evolved as a mechanism for the peoples of these societies to deal with profound socioeconomic change and as a channel for their reintegration into new forms of societal community.19 These \"Salvationist groups\" or millenarian movements of the medieval and early modern period exhibited remarkably consistent characteristics.20 First, although these movements found support among all classes, clearly their most ardent support and most of their adherents came from the lower strata of society. Second, the sheer desperation of the populace, resultingfromnot one but a series of disasters occurring in these areas, added a particularly compelling appeal to the message of wandering prophets. Such events as drought, famine, plague, economic dislocation, overcrowding, and social and cultural change—indeed, even physically disturbing or frightening occurrences such as earthquakes, comets, or solar eclipses—could trigger millenarian speculations. Medieval millenarians believed that heaven on earth would be preceded by some type of social disaster initiated by the coming of the Antichrist.21 As a result, every generation in these societies looked for the \"signs\" that might indicate the onset of a period of demonic reign that was most assuredly to emerge in conditions of severe social and economic stress and catastrophe.22 Those members of society who were unskilled—most likely the majority— found themselves poorly prepared for employment in new industries. This provoked a sense of deprivation when they compared their condition to that of others. These early millenarian movements emerged among predominantly agrarian populations that were usually isolated from the mainstream of society.23 The identifiable position or place of these peoples within society had been lost. Filial\n\nApocalyptic Prophecy to Millenarian Revolution\n\n21\n\nrelationships and the traditional structure of their rural village and its complementary social network were deteriorating as more and more people relocated to the cities. A durable history of religious-inspired millenarian doctrines was pervasive in these societies, as was the availability of potential charismatic leadership.24 Finally, and perhaps most important, life, as these people had known it for generations, with its ancillary system of customary norms and rules of behavior, was disintegrating. In short, they must have believed that their functional world was coming to an end, causing both deep stress and indignation. It cannot be surprising that such a belief would serve to substantiate the pervasive religious-inspired eschatological prophecy existing in these societies. The adherents of these movements possessed a persistent sense of tension and anxiety over how to cope with the catastrophe of abrupt socioeconomic change and the introduction of new cultural norms, perceived as both alien and corrupt. This distress appears to have manifested itself as moral outrage and righteous indignation. Such indignation, in response to social injustice, is recognized as a necessary and sufficient catalyst of political violence.25 Indignation calls for an individual or a group to construe the events that are happening around them within the context of their personal normative system. In order to label an action as \"immoral\" or \"an injustice,\" one must compare that action to one's personal values. Indeed, what one individual may consider to be immoral, another may find fully acceptable as an appropriate action. In other words, indignation is a concept grounded in one's culture. It dictates that one compare what has happened to one's expectation of what \"ought\" to have happened and \"depends upon a learned standard of what is right and wrong.\" Defined as \"the attitude and behavioral manifestations of wrathfulness because of unworthy or unjust treatment,\"26 indignation is a source of political violence, can play an important role in the onset of revolution, and appears to have some relationship with the expression of millenarian expectations.27 To many millenarians, paradise is viewed as an egalitarian community. In the eyes of God, many chiiiasts argue, all humans are the same. Thus, the Utopia promised by the advent of the millennium will most certainly be a classless society—there will be no rich and poor; no haves and have-nots. As a result, the injection of a new order or hierarchy into a society—one that divides humans into unequal classes through profound socioeconomic change—has frequently engendered millenarian expectations. For example, as the modern world began to take shape in Western Europe, particularly in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, when the class divisions engendered by industrialization came to be an important source of conflict, one sees an increase in indignation of the lower classes toward the growing wealth of the emerging middle class; the bourgeoisie. Concurrently, there was an increase in both explicitly religious and secular millenarianism within these areas.28 The indignation engendered by the perceived violation of one's spiritual values, in particular the search for \"natural justice\" and the egalitarian society, can be particularly volatile. For example, George Rude* argues that collective indignation\n\n11\n\nRevolution and the Millennium\n\nmanifested itself in the sense of anger and violent dissatisfaction at the economic and social injustices felt by angry crowds in late-eighteenth-century and early-nineteenth century France and England. He asserts that these crowds were seeking \"natural justice,\" and exhibited, although Rude downplays the idea, millenarian expectations.29 JOACHITE PROPHECY: THE IDEA OF HUMAN PROGRESS In the late twelfth century, a Calabrian abbot and hermit, Joachim of Fiore, provided an important doctrinal foundation for the spread of millenarianism in the West—one that would have an impact on early religious activities in the New World. He has been described as \"without a doubt the greatest medieval apocalyptic thinker and the creator of one of the most influential of all Christian theologies of history.\"30 The Joachite prophecy stated that history involved three successive stages, each of them presided over by one of the Persons of the Holy Trinity. The first was the Age of the Father, or of the law—an age of excessive fear and bondage for all people. The second was the Age of the Son or of the Gospel—one that was characterized by faith and filial submission. The third era, which was yet to come, would be the Age of the Spirit—one of love, joy, and freedom, \"when the knowledge of God would be revealed directly in the hearts of all men.\"31 In short, the third era of Joachite prophecy was to be the arrival of the millennium. Such a prophecy strongly influenced future millenarian movements by seemingly providing a means of forecasting history. Joachim's new eschatology offered an optimistic viewpoint of the world yet to come and stood in direct contrast to the prevailing gloomy perspective of history \"enshrined in the mainline Augustinian eschatology.\"32 Prophets of revolutionary millenarianism also found in interpretations of the ancient idea of an ideal, egalitarian state another important source of eschatological expectation. Since the ancient world, people had spoken of a Golden Age characterized by a perfect society without status, wealth, oppression, or exploitation. At its foundation was the idea of justice as a natural manifestation of God. Throughout the medieval period, this Golden Age was believed by most people to have been lost in the distant past forever. Yet the appeal of such a paradise never lost its salience and was kept alive by a small but idealistic group of religious sectarians.33 Nonetheless, in the turbulence and pervasive social injustices of late fourteenth-century Western Europe, the notion of an ideal, egalitarian Golden Age again rose to prominence as a powerful social doctrine representing a new hope for the redemption of humankind.34 The revolutionary millenarian movements that erupted between the fourteenth and sixteenth centuries in Western Europe—most notably, the Taborites of Bohemia, which emerged during the Hussite Wars around 1380; the League of the Elect, led by Thomas Muntzer; and the Anabaptists, who ruled Munster from 1532 to 1535—were profoundly influenced by the idea of a potential egalitarian Golden Age and essentially anarcho-communist in their ideology.35 In this context, Norman Cohn suggests that they represent the antecedents of twentieth-century totalitarian\n\nApocalyptic Prophecy to Millenarian Revolution\n\n13\n\nmovements, such as Nazism and communism, which he theorizes are modern, secularized forms of millenarianism.36 He points out that Thomas Muntzer remains a hero to modern-day Marxists.37 Indeed, Friedrich Engels argues that the \"chiliastic dream-visions\" of the Taborites offered a convenient, yet significant starting point for class struggle in the world: Only in the teachings of Munzer [sic] did these communist strains express the aspirationsof a real fraction of society. He was thefirstto formulate them with a certain definiteness, and since him they have been observed in every great popular upheaval, until they gradually merged with the modern proletarian movement just as the struggle of free peasants in the Middle Ages against feudal domination which was ensnaring them more and more merged with the struggles of serfs and bondsmen for complete abolition of the feudal system.38 The English Civil War (1642-1646) involved elements of millenarian speculation on a well-organized, national level. During this period apocalyptic expectations were fueled by such radical movements as the Diggers, who also professed an explicitly anarcho-communist ideology manifested in their complete rejection of the institution of private property; and the Fifth Monarchy Men, whose belief in the impending reign of Christ on earth led them to attempt coups against both the Protectorate and the restored monarchy.39 Following the Restoration these movements were increasingly viewed as irrational \"enthusiasts\" and extremists who sought to disrupt the prevailing social order and faded into obscurity by the end of the seventeenth century. However, their millenarian beliefs and writings retained an important measure of respectability among the popular religions of England for some time to come.40 SECULAR MILLENARIANISM IN THE WEST By the eighteenth century, the idea of millenarianism in the West came to be seen less as an excessive form of religious enthusiasm that had its appeal among largely marginal segments of society and more in terms consistent with mainstream Western thought. In particular, millenarianism became increasingly associated with the powerful Enlightenment idea of progress. Christian orthodoxy was coming under increasing criticism among many scholars and philosophers of Western Europe. As the power of science was on the rise, that of religion was on the decline. More and more intellectuals came to agree with Descartes that science, which had already unlocked many of the secrets of the physical and biological world, could also be harnessed to reveal the ultimate truths of the social world, by applying its principles to economics, politics, human nature, and the law.41 As a result, many became highly critical of orthodox religion as something that actually retarded the development of society rather than contributed to its progress. The late-seventeenth-century and early-eighteenth-century French writer, Fontenelle, for example, in his Thoughts on the Plurality of Worlds, celebrated the\n\n14\n\nRevolution and the Millennium\n\npower of rationalism and the order of the universe. He \"defended mechanical law in place of providence, and he helped to lead men away from Christianity and the Church to religious skepticism, and to an all embracing faith in science as a harbinger of the later Enlightenment period.\"42 The glorification of science, concurrent with severe criticism of the teachings of Christianity,43 set the stage for a new kind of human salvation in the eighteenth century. As a result, a new form of religion began to emerge, one that placed its faith in the enormous power of secular, rational thought. The idea of human progress became a form of social redemption; a notion that transformed forever traditionally religious conceptions of the ultimate fate of humankind. Such a transformation engendered a new secular political \"religion,\" one that converted the role of God to that of \"natural law.\" Nonetheless, this transformation did not jettison the function of the Deity. Rather, it was merely \"disguised,\" and this allowed for a broad interpretation, and an equally broad appeal, of the idea of \"progressive\" millennialism.44 The powerful idea of humankind progressing through history toward social perfection without the aid of a supernatural messiah, was perhaps the most powerful conception to emerge out of the European Enlightenment.45 Yet, it must be understood that such an idea emerged out of the existing Christian teachings regarding a future paradise.46 The idea of secular human progress based on the absolute power of science and reason was not a concept that required a broad leap from the Book of Revelation. With only a slight alteration in the pervasive Christian scheme of a progress toward a final salvation, one was capable of conceiving of a secularized millennium. Science and the force of human reason replaced the Second Coming of Jesus Christ as the deliverer of the masses to the promised land of erudition and enlightenment. Ignorance replaced the symbolism of the dark powers of Satan. While such an idea was logically insignificant, it was nonetheless substantively huge because it brought heaven down to earth, and seemed to substitute the hopefulness of a real Utopia for the gloom of some intangible one that was to come only after death. Ultimately, such an idea moved from the margins of society to the center of intellectual activity. For example, in the period immediately preceding the French Revolution,47 philosophers such as Condorcet and Morelly, as well as other members of the French intelligentsia collectively known as the philosophes, sought to give the ancient myth of the Golden Age a new, modern twist. Scientific rationalism was married to the idea of progress. What emerged was the possibility of social redemption and the creation of a human-made, this-worldly Utopia.48 The eighteenth-century philosophes believed that they were proselytizing \"what amounted to a new religion for humankind.\"49 Morelly, who has been described as \"the only consistent communist among the eighteenth century thinkers,\" combined Rousseau's idea of the General Will with an attack on private property to arrive at a rather primitive theory of socialism. His Code of Nature was the \"first modern book to characterize communism as a practical program capable of being achieved\n\nApocalyptic Prophecy to Millenarian Revolution\n\n15\n\nhere and now; not simply a Utopian fantasy.\"50 It was a powerful influence on later socialist thinkers, such as Babeuf and Fourier.51 Condorcet boldly asserted that the history of Europe could be identified to have occurred in ten distinct phases of development, of which he observed the present to be the ninth. The tenth stage, he declared, was imminent and would be one characterized by infinite \"perfectibility.,'52 Everything tells us that we are approaching the era of one of the grand revolutions of the human race. What can better enlighten us as to what we may expect, what can be a surer guide to us, amidst its commotions, than the picture of the revolutions that have preceded and prepared the way for it? The present state of knowledge assures us that it will be happy. But is it not upon condition that we know how to assist it with all our strength?53 Rather than living in the darkness of ignorance and gloom, Condorcet believed that humanity had now developed an all-powerful instrument capable of \"ascertaining the truth of natural philosophy, of testing the effects of history and of formulating laws for taste. The forces of historical development had opened the door of understanding and, as a result, humankind now possessed the means to overcome the old mistakes of its infancy that will forever preserve us from a relapse into former ignorance.\"54 The vision of a total social transformation and salvation that was to result from purely human efforts gathered its strength from emerging and explicitly secular contemporary philosophies: the power of rational thought and reason, the idea of a national mission, the growing and potentially malevolent power of ethnicity and racism; and later, the dialectic of Marxism, advancing toward the communist Utopia.55 MARX AND THE COMMUNIST MILLENNIUM The convergence of the wretched conditions of early-modern industrial society and the innovative ideas of the Enlightenment period had created an environment for the philosophical connection of the Christian concept of the millennium with the idea of historical progress. Out of this fusion emerged a secularized millenarianism that subsequently became a modern and potent historical force—out of the social disaster of the present will emerge a new and perfect society. The most powerful apostle of this new dialectic was Karl Marx. While his was not the original philosophy of socialist utopianism, Marxism has undeniably been the most influential one, particularly to twentieth-century revolutionaries.56 In addition to the ideas of late-eighteenth-century socialism, Marx was intellectually influenced by two other sources: Hegelianism and the writings of Ludwig Feuerbach. Marx was attracted to the teachings of Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel because they provided him with a way of seemingly finding meaning and hope in history. Hegel had been a professor at the University of Berlin until his death in 1831. Yet\n\n16\n\nRevolution and the Millennium\n\nhis teachings remained a significant influence when Marx began his studies there in 1836. Hegel was concerned with the history of humankind in the widest and most general sense. He argued that the historical process of human development is not random or meaningless. Rather, he believed it to be both understandable and inevitable. He argued that the world was progressing toward a human objective that was predetermined by God. As such, Hegel was a proponent of historicism—the idea of history as a process above and beyond individual human actions.57 Hegel taught that a \"Spirit,\" which is inexorable, is the force behind humankind's growing realization of who it is and its freedom.58 This Spirit moves history along a predetermined path; one that is neither straight nor simple.59 He argued that the Spirit provides a will, or a destiny, to the human experience. This will, or destiny, embodied in history, imposes itself on individuals, and there is nothing one can do to stop the process. This is the concept of development—a wholly universal concept. It is life and movement as such. The life of God in himself, the life of universality in nature and the spirit, of everything living—the lowest and the highest—this is what development is. It is a self-differentiation, a bringing of self into existence, into being for another's apprehension, and in this process remaining self-identical. It is the eternal creation of the world, in a different form the generation of the Son, and the eternal reversion of the spirit into itself—an absolute movement which at the same time is absolute rest—eternal self communion. This is the Idea's being with itself, the capacity to revert into itself, to coincide with its other and yet to be at home with itself with the other. This capacity, this power, to be at home with oneself in the negative of oneself is also the freedom of man.60 At the foundation of historicism is the dialectic—the idea that human progress comes about as the by-product of struggle and conflict between the existing order and opposition to that order.61 Hegel believed that the dialectic moves humanity on to the next higher level of existence. Individuals acting on the stage of history seemingly alone in their interests, he argued, are unknowingly fulfilling the grand designs of the dialectic. As a result, the great changes of history must occur because they are the logical conclusions of the preceding stages. In this context, historicists believe that \"history makes man, rather than man making history.\"62 In Hegelian philosophy, history is akin to a steam locomotive whose movement cannot be sidetracked and whose schedule cannot be appreciably altered. In short, history is the true spiritual power of the universe—God's will operating in the world.63 Marx, although a historicist, possessed a slightly different interpretation of the dialectic from that of Hegel. My dialectic method is not only different from the Hegelian, but it is its direct opposite. To Hegel, the life-process of the human brain, i.e., the process of thinking, which, under the name of \"the Idea,\" he even transforms into an independent subject, is the demiurgos of the real world, and the real world is only the external, phenomenal form of \"the Idea.\" With me,\n\nApocalyptic Prophecy to Millenarian Revolution\n\n17\n\non the contrary, the ideal is nothing else than the material world reflected by the human mind, and translated into forms of thought.64 Specifically, Hegel conceived of the idea of the dialectic as spiritual-based, whereas Marx conceived of it as temporal-based. Marx was also profoundly influenced by the philosophy of Ludwig Feuerbach. Indeed, as one scholar has asserted, \"if forced to state Feuerbach's philosophical genealogy, he would have to say that he was son of Hegel and father of Marx.\"65 Feuerbach narrowed the notion of Hegel's \"Spirit\" or \"Idea\" to a secular construction; one that existed only here and now, in the real and material world, and not in the spiritual realm.66 Although Feuerbach sharply criticized Hegel's idealism, he was nonetheless a historicist. His focus, unlike Hegel's, was on material rather than spiritual forces. Feuerbach rejected the intellectual coexistence of, and the seeming congruence of theological thought and scientific reason that existed in nineteenth-century Europe. He believed that not only were the two notions incongruent, they were incompatible.67 Feuerbach argued that religion was a synthetic construction of humankind. It represented merely the projection of human needs, fears, and desires onto a mythical world that existed only in human consciousness.68 Nonetheless, religion was an involuntary action of humans. Once one projects his own feelings onto God, God becomes nothing more than a subject. And humans become the object of this subject. At this point theology intervenes to explain the nature of humans and their universe in simple, understandable language.69 Feuerbach was the first philosopher to demonstrate that religion has its origins in the needs and wants of humankind. He believed that it was an essential and involuntary fulfillment of one's feeling's, formulated in imagery that results from one's projection of oneself onto the objective image of a supposedly divine being. In other words, the substance of religion is purely human.70 Marx went beyond Feuerbach and attacked the conditions in society that made religions necessary. Religious suffering, he believed, helped the lower classes cope with extreme poverty and the horrible conditions of their lives in nineteenth-century Europe. Marx, much like Feuerbach, conceived of religion as a secular-based phenomenon.71 \"Man makes religion, religion does not make man. In other words, religion is the self-consciousness and self-feeling of man who has either not yet found himself or has already lost himself again .... Religion is the cry of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, just as it is the spirit of a spiritless situation. It is the opium of the people.\"72 By arguing that religion \"is the opium of the people,\" Marx meant that it numbed the lower classes to an irrational perspective of life's conditions and led them to ignore a rational perspective of the exploitation that they were forced to endure as a result of capitalism. Marx believed that humankind should abandon the conditions that require these types of illusions.\n\n18\n\nRevolution and the Millennium\n\nIn his writings, Marx never identified an end of history and, thus, espoused no definable eschatology; no static end point. Nonetheless, he was convinced of the inherent majesty of humankind and went to great lengths to accurately lay out the history of humankind's degradation by institutions and whole social systems. He believed that the proletariat, the workers oppressed by the exploitive capitalist system, ultimately were destined to perform a redemptive role in world history. As a result, humankind would be installed to its rightful place in the world.73 The coming social transformation, to be wrought by the proletariat, would be the final, definitive revolution, one that redeemed all of humankind. Throughout his writings, Marx offers numerous visions of what life in a society redeemed by the proletariat—the true communist society—would be like; \"where the free development of each is the condition for the free development of all.\"74 In perhaps his most articulate prophecy of this future community, he wrote: In a higher phase of communist society, after the enslaving subordination of the individual to the division of labour, and therewith also the antithesis between manual and physical labour, has vanished; after labour has become not only a means of life but life's prime want; after productive forces have also increased with the all-round development of the individual, and all the springs of cooperative wealth flow more abundantly—only then can the narrow horizon of bourgeois right be crossed in its entirety and society inscribe on its banners: Fro each according to his ability, to each according to his needs!75 Marx portrayed the arrival of the communist millennium as the advent of true human freedom brought on by the total elimination of capitalism: In communist society, where nobody has one exclusive sphere of activity but each can become accomplished in any branch he wishes, society regulates the general production and thus makes it possible for me to do one thing to-day and another to-morrow, to hunt in the morning, fish in the afternoon, rear cattle in the evening, criticize after dinner, just as I have a mind, without ever becoming hunter,fisherman,shepherd or critic.76 The philosophy of Marx offers a profound sense of hope to those caught up in the often wretched conditions created by early industrialization, by identifying a new dialectic—one that catapults the exploited and oppressed class to the top of a transformed social order. It promises that capitalism will ultimately fail as a result of its own inner contradictions and the forces of history. And, thus, in the new communist society, the exploitive and alienating nature of capitalism will be removed forever. Perhaps not surprisingly, it is this millenarian element of Marxist thought that modern revolutionaries have tended to emphasize. Not infrequently, revolutionary movements in both the East and the West have offered up carefully crafted perversions of Marx's ideas \"which they have molded into the creeds of political and surrogate religions largely aimed at the lower classes.\"77 Indeed, it is perhaps in its most corrupted form, and in contexts entirely unforeseen by Marx, that we see the true legacy of his doctrine and its enduring revolutionary appeal.\n\nApocalyptic Prophecy to Millenarian Revolution\n\n19\n\nMILLENARIANISM: A MODERN POLITICAL RELIGION The rapid progress of knowledge in eighteenth-century and nineteenth-century Europe and the growing faith in the power of rationalism, not only as a way to explain things but also as an effective tool for solving problems, combined with the increasing force of antireligious sentiment, allowed people to more fully understand both the origins and the nature of their universe in scientific and thus secular terms. Predictably, one result was a declining reliance upon Christian doctrine and faith.78 Nonetheless, modern peoples did not lose their need for religion in the broader sense. They still required a simple, comprehensible, and satisfying picture of a world of structure, values, and purpose, possessing the potential for a better future. Indeed, the disoriented classes of nineteenth-century Europe, uprooted by industrialization from their traditional way of life and increasingly thrust into an everyday world of anomie and confusion, possessed urgent needs of this kind. While some clung to traditional religious systems, others adopted modem substitutes. The political movements that emerged in eighteenth-century Europe in the form of socialism, anarchism, or communism represent modern religious substitutes. As such, they are secularized forms of millenarianism largely because, while their chief aims are social revolution and transformation, their ideologies possess the characteristics of a secular or political religion. Although they identify no specific divine form, these revolutionary movements nonetheless represent an organized system of beliefs in the ultimate perfection of the human condition and the advent of a future paradise, wrought by the efforts of people themselves, which is uniquely upheld and fostered by a profound zealousness and deeply held devotion. They address ultimate concerns and clearly demonstrate \"that an apparently chaotic world is underlain by profound moral order\"79 As such, they perform a religiouslike function for their adherents: In Europe and elsewhere, for the past century and a half, there have always been men and movements animated by ... faith, preparing for the Day, referring all their ideas to some all-embracing system sure of some pre-ordained andfinaldenouement of the historic drama with all its conflicts into an absolute harmony. Jacobins may have differed from the Babouvists, the Blanquists from many of the secret societies in thefirsthalf of the nineteenth century, the Communists from the Socialists, and the Anarchists from all others, yet they all belong to one religion.80 Nevertheless, the concept of millenarianism as a social and political force for action is problematic and not without controversy. Some important questions arise as we attempt to characterize and understand its true nature. For example, a significant schism exists in millenarian scholarship over the rationality of millenarian movements. Is participation in such groups a rational act or a sign of psychopathology? The split between those who attribute such movements to a collective pathological disturbance versus those who argue that they result from a desire for revitalization of society—emerging from a particularly\n\n30\n\nRevolution and the Millennium\n\nperceptive intuition about collective social problems—is best represented in the theoretical constructs of Norman Cohn and Anthony F. C. Wallace, respectively. Cohn argues that the medieval millenarian movements he has studied may be characterized as a collective form of psychopathology. He implies that these movements had little understanding of what was happening to their society and responded in a way that was \"peculiar,\" in the sense that their behavior was abnormal and irrational.81 In another study, Eric Hobsbawm has drawn conclusions quite similar to those of Cohn. In his analysis of southern European millenarian movements of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, he argues that such groups as the Lazzaretti, Freemasons, Blanquists, and Spanish Anarchists, were led by their millenarian expectations and religious ritualism into irrational modes of organization and agitation, rendering them incapable of achieving their goals. In contrast to Cohn, Hobsbawm attributes the irrationality of these movements to a lack of ideological insight rather than to psychopathology. Such movements, he concludes, were \"primitive,\" \"archaic,\" or \"pre-political.\"82 In contrast to Cohn and Hobsbawm, the anthropologist Anthony F. C Wallace, who has studied primarily non-Western millenarian movements, argues that under conditions of severe collective stress and potential cultural disintegration, societies come to realize that they must either initiate a process of \"revitalization\" or \"face extinction.\" According to Wallace, millenarian movements are, in reality, instruments of social renewal that present a new and potent ideology offering an imminent and efficacious solution for what appears to most to be an especially grim period of social catastrophe or disaster. A revitalization movement is defined as a deliberate, organized, conscious effort by members of a society to construct a more satisfying culture. Revitalization is thus, from a cultural standpoint, a special kind of culture change phenomenon: the persons involved in the process of revitalization must perceive their culture, or some major areas of it, as a system (whether accurate or not); they must feel that this cultural system is unsatisfactory, and they must innovate not merely discrete items, but a new cultural system.83 In other words, the \"revitalization\" or millenarian movement is a rational process with very deliberate goals—cultural adaptation to a new social paradigm wrought by perceived deleterious, yet nonetheless real, change. Perhaps an important component in this debate over the rationality of these movements lies in the potential for wide variation in both composition and form of chiliast expectations.84 Indeed, such movements have frequently demonstrated that they are highly pliable and readily capable of being shaped into some form that is appealing to their believers, addressing their specific needs and yearnings. All millenarian movements possess the potential for transmutation and adaptation to meet the exigencies of the moment within a society.85 For example, as we shall soon see, the Babi movement, which began as a millenarian-inspired rebellion against the Persian monarchy in the midnineteenth century, later was transformed\n\nApocalyptic Prophecy to Millenarian Revolution\n\n31\n\ninto a profoundly pacifist, worldwide religious faith, Baha'ism, in the twentieth century. To fully understand this potential for transmutation, we must begin with the fact that the secular idea of an immediate, this-worldly, collective transformation of society, to be wrought by the hands of man himself through a process dominated by the effective use of scientific reason, is a modern phenomenon. Yet such an idea begins with the available raw material of the older and more durable form of millenarianism, a form that is grounded in religious dogma. It is precisely the potential for transmutation that makes millenarianism such an elusive idea to define and characterize. Indeed, perhaps it is a mistake for us to characterize revolutionary millenarian movements as either explicitly religious or explicitly political, when they generally tend to exhibit the characteristics of both.86 For example, although Islam and Christianity are traditionally looked upon as religious millenarian movements, each originated as a revolutionary movement and possessed a political nature from the onset.87 In a similar way, Marxism demonstrates the attributes of a \"secular theology of revolution, as opposed to those of a political theory.\"88 In this way, the powerful idea of a millennial kingdom on earth, though cloaked from the beginning in religious dogma, has nonetheless always possessed an inherent potential for revolution. While it is far beyond the scope of this present study to reach any significant conclusions in the important debate as to the rationality of millenarian movements, nonetheless, I will identify two relevant observations of revolutionary millenarianism which appear to support the plausibility of Wallace's argument. First, if millenarian movements are outbursts of psychopathological behavior, then they would tend to emerge at virtually any time, occurring at random and exhibiting little, if any, uniform patterns in their origin.
