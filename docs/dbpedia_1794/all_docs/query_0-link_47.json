Its conception goes back to the 2003 meeting of the American Schools of Oriental Research that took place in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where two sessions were dedicated to the rich cultural heritage of ancient Iran; it was also the ﬁrst time that Iranian archeology was represented at ASOR since the Iranian Revolution. The intent of the sessions was to evaluate various aspects of the relationships between Elam of the late Neo-Elamite period and early Achaemenid Persia. The individuals who presented papers at those sessions were Javier Álvarez-Mon, Elizabeth Carter, Mark B. Garrison, D. T. Potts, Margaret Cool Root, and Matt Waters. With the exception of ÁlvarezMon, the topics of the presentations at the conference are the same as published in their papers in this volume. The following individuals also graciously accepted invitations to contribute to this volume: Gian Pietro Basello, Wouter F. M. Henkelman, Enrique Quintana Cifuentes, Jan Tavernier, François Vallat, Y. Hassanzadeh, H. Mollasalehi, and David Stronach. Elam and Persia is a compilation of the work of fourteen international scholars with a wide range of expertise. In this context, the book is organized into three separate sections based on philological, archaeological, and art-historical evidence. A common thread running through these analyses is the nature and signiﬁcance of the relationship between “Elamite” culture of the late Neo-Elamite period (post Assyrian conquest ca. 647 b.c.) in Elam and the emerging “Persian” culture in Fars (late 7th and 6th centuries b.c.). As always, the editorial process of compiling multiple articles, some of which have been translated from their original languages, and bringing the ﬁnal publication to press has taken more time than expected. The original manuscripts were submitted to the publisher in October 2007. Authors received proofs in May 2010. In order to get the volume to press as soon as possible, authors were asked in May 2010 to keep additions to their texts and bibliographies to a minimum. The editors wish to express their thanks to the contributors for their patience during the period between submission and publication, their willingness to forego extensive revisions to their texts, and the speed with which they attended to the proofs. This project certainly would not have been possible without the support and nurture of relatives, friends, and colleagues. We would like, in particular, to mention the continuing encouragement and professional guidance of Jim Eisenbraun. The editors have not imposed uniformity of transcription of ancient personal and place names. Each individual author has employed a style of his/her own preference. At Trinity University the editors would like to acknowledge the assistance of Ellen Dooley, Kelly Grajeda, and Sarah Gretsch. This volume is dedicated to Pierre Amiet, whose rich contributions on the culture of ancient Elam have served as a constant source of inspiration for the editors.\n\nvii\n\n00-Elam_Persia.book Page viii Friday, December 10, 2010 4:54 PM\n\nContributors to Elam and Persia Javier Álvarez-Mon Javier Álvarez-Mon, a native of Spain, holds degrees in art history, religion, and Near Eastern art and archaeology from the École du Louvre (Paris), the Graduate Theological Union and Jesuit School of Theology (Berkeley), and the University of California at Berkeley. His primary research interest concentrates on the ancient Iranian civilizations of Elam and early Achaemenid Persia. As a 2003 Fulbright-Hays scholar, he compiled a digital catalogue of Elamite antiquities held in museums and storage units scattered throughout southwest Iran, the National Museum of Iran (Tehran), and the Louvre Museum (Paris). This catalogue comprises a large percentage of original materials, including those that are the focus of his doctoral dissertation, now published as The Arjan Tomb: At the Crossroads of the Elamite and the Persian Empires (Leuven, 2010). Along with the use of traditional methods of analysis, he is interested in fostering the role of modern, digital-based technologies to facilitate the study and preservation of the cultural heritage of ancient Iran. He is currently Lecturer in Near Eastern Archaeology at the University of Sydney (Australia).\n\nGian Pietro Basello Gian Pietro Basello is research fellow at the Department of Asian Studies of “L’Orientale” University of Naples. He teaches Elamite civilization as adjunct professor at the University of Bologna in Ravenna. Since 2003, he has been working at the Italian and Iranian joint Project DARIOSH (Digital Achaemenid Royal Inscription Open Schema Hypertext). His primary research interests are the Neo-Elamite and Achaemenid sources. His research has focused also on ancient calendars and systems for counting and recording time. The address of his Web site is .\n\nElizabeth Carter Elizabeth Carter is Professor of Near Eastern Archaeology and Musa Sabi Term Chair of Iranian Studies (2009–2014) in the Department of Near Eastern Languages and Cultures at UCLA. She began her career working on the Elamites and carried out excavations in Susa (Excavations in the Ville Royale at Susa: The Third Millennium b.c. Occupation; Cahiers de la délégation archéologique française en Iran 11; Paris, 1980) and Anshan (Malyan) (Excavations at Tal-e Malyan, Iran: The Middle Elamite Period; University Museum Monograph no. 75; Philadelphia, 1996). She maintains an active research interest in the social and cultural history of Elam (Elam: Surveys of Political History and Archaeology; University of California Near Eastern Studies Series 24; Berkeley, 1984, with Matthew W. Stolper) although her ﬁeldwork has been in southeastern Turkey since 1989. The paper in Elam and Persia stems from an interest in the archaeology of death in the Ancient Near East.\n\nviii\n\n00-Elam_Persia.book Page ix Friday, December 10, 2010 4:54 PM\n\nContributors to Elam and Persia\n\nix\n\nEnrique Quintana Cifuentes Enrique Quintana Cifuentes is Letrado de la Administración del Estado y Adjunto de los Servicios jurídicos del Estado en Murcia (Spain). His academic background allowed him to specialize in the study of Sumerian, Akkadian, Elamite, and Egyptian languages. He is a member of the Spanish Oriental Association, the Spanish Egyptology Association, and a regular collaborator with the Instituto del Próximo Oriente (IPOA) at the University of Murcia. One of his primary interests is the advancement of the study of Elamite culture and language. In addition to directing the website of the IPOA, dedicated to the dissemination of textual documentation of Elam, he is the author of numerous publications, in particular, two volumes in the collection Estudios Orientales published by the University of Murcia: Historia de Elam: El vecino mesopotámico (no. 1); Textos y fuentes para el estudio de Elam (no. 4). In the same series, two works are currently in press: La lengua elamita: Introducción a las lenguas muertas del Próximo Oriente Antiguo; Historia General de Mesopotamia.\n\nMark B. Garrison Mark B. Garrison is the Alice Pratt Brown Distinguished Professor in Art History in the Department of Art and Art History at Trinity University in San Antonio, Texas. His primary research interests are the glyptic arts of ancient Iran and Iraq in the ﬁrst millennium b.c. He specializes in the glyptic preserved on two large archives from Persepolis—the Persepolis Fortiﬁcation tablets and the Persepolis Treasury tablets. With Margaret Cool Root, he is author of Seals on the Persepolis Fortiﬁcation Tablets, Volume I: Images of Heroic Encounter (Oriental Institute Publications 117; Chicago, 2001). In addition to the documentary work represented in that publication, his research has focused on social aspects of glyptic production in workshops in Persepolis, especially the issues surrounding the impact of individuals of high status and/or administrative rank on the development of glyptic style and iconography in the early Achaemenid period. His work has also addressed the emergence and development of royal ideology in glyptic at Persepolis, religious imagery in Achaemenid art, and the relationship of glyptic of the early Achaemenid period with earlier glyptic traditions in Elam and Mesopotamia.\n\nYousef Hassanzadeh Yousef Hassanzadeh is a researcher in the History Department at the National Museum of Iran. He holds a B.A. in Archaeology from Tehran University. His research interests concentrate on the social and artistic developments in northwestern Iran during the early ﬁrst millennium b.c. He is particularly interested in the study of the little-known Mannaean culture within the larger political and artistic contexts of the Elamite, Median, Urartian, and Assyrian civilizations. His most recent publications deal with the study of the Mannaean glazed brickwork found in Qalaichi (Boukan) and presently housed at the National Museum of Iran.\n\n00-Elam_Persia.book Page x Friday, December 10, 2010 4:54 PM\n\nx\n\nContributors to Elam and Persia\n\nWouter F. M. Henkelman Wouter F. M. Henkelman was trained in Classical Philology at Leiden and in History and Culture of the Achaemenid Empire at Utrecht. He received his doctoral decree (cum laude) in 2006 from the University of Leiden. A revised and expanded version of his doctoral thesis, The Other Gods Who Are: Studies in Iranian-Elamite Acculturation Based on the Persepolis Fortiﬁcation Texts, was published in 2008 (Achaemenid History 14). He is currently working as researcher and associate lecturer at the Free University of Amsterdam and teaches Achaemenid Elamite at the École Pratique des Hautes Études. He is also co-director of the websites achemenet.com and Musée achéménide. His primary research interests are the Elamite Persepolis Fortiﬁcation texts, on which he has written a series of articles dealing with subjects ranging from the royal table to the status of foreign workers. A recurrent theme in these and other studies is the Elamite background of some Achaemenid institutions and traditions. He is currently preparing for publication a corpus of nearly 3,000 Elamite Fortiﬁcation texts (with translations, commentary, and lexicon) on behalf of the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago and a new edition of the Elamite version of the Bisotun inscription of Darius the Great.\n\nHekmatolah Mollasalehi Hekmatolah Mollasalehi is assistant professor in the Department of Archaeology at the University of Tehran (Iran). His primary research interests are the archaeology of religion and the epistemology of archaeology. Professor Mollasalehi is the author of more than a hundred articles dealing with multiple theoretical issues concerning the science of archaeology. He has published two books regarding the epistemology of archaeology and the various roles played by museums as phenomena of modern culture. H. Mollasalehi is chief editor of the Journal of Archaeology.\n\nD. T. Potts D. T. Potts is the Edwin Cuthbert Hall Professor of Middle Eastern Archaeology at the University of Sydney, Australia. He is interested broadly in the archaeology and early history of Iran, the Persian Gulf, Mesopotamia, the Indo-Iranian Borderlands, and Central Asia. His publications include Mesopotamian Civilization: The Material Foundations (Cornell, 1997), The Archaeology of Elam (Cambridge, 1999), Excavations at Tepe Yahya 1967–1975: The Third Millennium (Cambridge, MA, 2001), and edited volumes, including: Archaeology of the United Arab Emirates, with H. Al Naboodah and P. Hellyer (Trident, 2003); The Mamasani Archaeological Project, Stage One: A Report on the First Two Seasons of the ICAR–University of Sydney Expedition to the Mamasani District, Fars Province, Iran, with K. Roustaei (Tehran, 2006); and Memory as History: The Legacy of Alexander in Asia, with H.P. Ray (New Delhi, 2007).\n\nMargaret Cool Root Margaret Cool Root is Professor of Near Eastern and Classical Art and Archaeology in the Department of the History of Art and the Interdepartmental Program in Classical Art and Ar-\n\n00-Elam_Persia.book Page xi Friday, December 10, 2010 4:54 PM\n\nContributors to Elam and Persia\n\nxi\n\nchaeology at the University of Michigan. She is also Curator of Ancient Near Eastern and Greek Antiquities for the Kelsey Museum of Archaeology. Her ﬁrst book, The King and Kingship in Achaemenid Art: Essays on the Creation of an Iconography of Empire (Leiden, 1979), began a career that strives on many fronts to enhance our understanding of the signiﬁcance and pathways of the visual as a historical source in the study of empire and power construction. Current work continues to engage with the ofﬁcial visual traditions of the Achaemenids—their intricate dialogues with usable pasts of earlier Near Eastern and Egyptian cultures as well as their dialogues with Athenian culture of the Classical age. At the same time, her Persepolis Seal Project (now in collaboration for many years with Mark B. Garrison) urges the potentials of archival seal study to nuanced approaches to a true social history of art in the Achaemenid empire that may reach well below levels of ofﬁcialdom. Professor Root also publishes and exhibits for the Kelsey Museum on a broad range of topics from late prehistory to late antiquity. She has won many grants and awards, including a Guggenheim.\n\nDavid Stronach David Stronach is Emeritus Professor of Near Eastern Archaeology at the University of California, Berkeley. He was educated at Gordonstoun and St. John’s College, Cambridge. Between 1957 and 1960, he was a Fellow of the British Institute of Archaeology at Ankara and of the British School of Archaeology in Iraq, during which time he was also an assistant on the excavations of Seton Lloyd, Sir Max Mallowan, and Sir Mortimer Wheeler. From 1961 to 1980, he served as the Director of the British Institute of Persian Studies. He has conducted excavations at various sites in the Near East including Ras al ºAmiya, Pasargadae, Tepe Nush-i Jan, Shahr-i Qumis, Nineveh, and Erebuni. The author of numerous publications, one of his more recent books, co-authored with Michael Roaf, is Tepe Nush-i Jan I: The Major Buildings of the Median Settlement (London, 2007). In 2004, he was awarded the Gold Medal of the Archaeological Institute of America for Distinguished Archaeological Achievement.\n\nJan Tavernier Jan Tavernier studied Ancient History and Assyriology at the University of Leuven, receiving his doctoral degree in 2002. His doctoral thesis was entitled Iranica in de Achaemenidische periode: taalkundige studie van de Oud-Iraanse eigennamen en leenwoorden in niet-Iraanse teksten (ca. 550–330 b.c.). The ﬁrst part of that study was published in 2007 as Iranica in the Achaemenid period (ca. 550–330 b.c.): Lexicon of Old Iranian Proper Names and Loanwords, Attested in NonIranian Texts (Leuven, 2007). As a postdoctoral fellow research assistant at the University of Leuven, Jan Tavernier has published various articles on Old Iranian and Elamite linguistics and on Old Iranian and Akkadian onomastics. He is currently working on languages in the Achaemenid Empire, Elamite phonology, and Mesopotamian and Greek inventories. Since September 2008, he has been afﬁliated with the Université Catholique de Louvain.\n\n00-Elam_Persia.book Page xii Friday, December 10, 2010 4:54 PM\n\nxii\n\nContributors to Elam and Persia\n\nFrançois Vallat François Vallat is Directeur de Recherche honoraire au Centre National de la Recherche Scientiﬁque (CNRS), Paris. He has dedicated the greatest part of his academic research to the study of the Elamite civilization, from the proto-Elamite to the Achaemenid Persian periods. One of his early research interests was geographical in nature, demonstrating that Susiana and Elam were not always synonymous, as had been previously believed. This topic was clariﬁed in Les noms géographiques des sources suso-élamites (RGTC 11; Wiesbaden, 1993). He then turned his attention to the realm of history, reassessing and modifying previously accepted parameters for all key periods of the Elamite civilization (paleo-, middle-, neo-Elamite, and Achaemenid Persian periods). This collection of historical investigations has been summarized in the article “Susa” in the Supplément au Dictionnaire de la Bible, 73–74, 2002–3 (in collaboration with M.J. Steve and H. Gasche). Simultaneously, he has published numerous inscriptions in Elamite, Akkadian, and Old Persian, particularly those uncovered by the Délégation Archéologique Française en Iran (DAFI), for which he was epigraphist. He has also taught Elamite language and civilization at the École du Louvre (Paris). Presently, he is preparing Inscriptions Royales d’Élam et de Susiane, a volume dedicated to the publication of original texts from all periods of Elamite History.\n\nMatt Waters Matt Waters is Associate Professor of Classics and Ancient History at the University of Wisconsin–Eau Claire. He received his training in Assyriology and Classics at the University of Pennsylvania’s program in Ancient History. His research interests are the Neo-Assyrian, NeoElamite, and early Achaemenid Persian periods in the ﬁrst millennium b.c., along with GreekPersian relations in the Classical Period. He has been concerned in particular with the formation and organization of the early Achaemenid Persian Empire and Greek historiography. His book A Survey of Neo-Elamite History (State Archives of Assyria Studies 12) was published in 2000. Waters received a fellowship from the American Council of Learned Societies in 2005– 6 for his ongoing research on Ctesias’s Persica. He received the Jonas C. Greenﬁeld Prize from the American Oriental Society in 2006 for his article “Cyrus and the Achaemenids,” published in Iran 42 (2004): 91–102.\n\n00-Elam_Persia.book Page xiii Friday, December 10, 2010 4:54 PM\n\nAbbreviations General Abbreviations / Ac Akk.

Garrison\n\nDavid Stronach\n\nUniversity of Sydney\n\nTrinity University\n\nUniversity of California at Berkeley\n\nIt is our business in this place, before entering into the brilliant period of the Empire, to cast a retrospective glance over the earlier ages of obscurity, and to collect therefrom such scattered notices as are to be found of the Persians and their princes or kings before they suddenly attracted the general attention of the civilized world (. . . ) (G. Rawlinson 1884: 429)\n\nIf circumstances were different, surely the century preceding the Persian conquest of Elam (ﬁg. 1) would be revealed as one of the more fascinating chapters in human history. The late 7th and 6th centuries b.c. was a period of tremendous upheaval and change in ancient western Asia, marked by the destruction of the Assyrian empire, the rise of Babylon, and the stunning ascent of what was to become the Achaemenid Persian empire, the largest polity the world had yet seen. In this period also occurred events that were to become deeply entrenched in the Judeo-Christian tradition, notably the destruction of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar in 587/6 b.c. and the deportation of much of the Jewish population to sites in Babylonia. Of the major cultural entities involved in these far-reaching events, Elam has long remained the least understood. 1 At one time encompassing an area that was approximately equivalent to that of the modern Iranian provinces of Khuzestan and Fars (ﬁg. 1), Elam was, in the 7th and 6th centuries b.c., already old even by the standards of ancient western Asia. 2 The essays contained in this book are part of a continuing reassessment of Elamite culture in the period that falls between two landmark events: the sack of Susa in ca. 647 b.c. and the incorporation of Elam into the Achaemenid Persian empire by Darius I in 521/520 b.c. 3 For the purposes of this introductory essay, we shall refer to this period, ca. 647–521/20 b.c., as the late Neo-Elamite 1. This despite the fact that the book of Genesis and the Biblical prophets Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Ezekiel make reference to Elam as one of the great political powers of the 7th and 6th centuries b.c. Of longstanding debate are the problems associated with both the dating of and the contexts for the references to Elam in these Biblical texts; see e.g., in reference to the conquest of Canaan by an Elamite king in Genesis 14, Scheil 1896: 600–601; Hinz 1971: 666; Albright 1961: 49; Sarna 1966: 110–115; Redford 1992: 403, 408.

The study of Elam after the Assyrian sack of Susa and during the years leading up to the emergence of the Persians as a full-scale imperial power may be said to have already begun during the ﬁrst half of the 19th century. In accord with new advances in the decipherment of cuneiform, not to mention new discoveries made through excavation, areas of research took shape that, quite independently of either biblical or Classical accounts, suddenly drew attention to fundamental episodes in Assyrian and early Achaemenid history. These early years of discovery are intimately tied, moreover, to the pioneering accomplishments of a handful of extraordinary individuals working at no more than a few archaeological sites or with copies of no more than a limited number of texts. The notable achievement of Henry Creswicke Rawlinson (1810–1895), in copying, and translating, the Old Persian cuneiform inscription that stands directly beneath the monumental stone relief of Darius I at Bisotun (Behistun/Bisitun), remains fundamental in this regard. 5 Known as the “Rosetta Stone” of cuneiform for the role that it played in the decipherment of Old Persian, Elamite, and Babylonian cuneiform, the trilingual inscription at Bisotun revealed, in Darius’ own words, the turbulent events that led to his ascent to the Persian throne (Rawlinson 1847; 1850; 1851). The translation of many important cuneiform texts soon followed, including, in 1871, George Smith’s publication of passages from the Assyrian royal annals that included a graphic account of Ashurbanipal’s destruction of the Elamite capital, Susa. In 1880, Rawlinson, assisted by T. G. Pinches, published the translation of a long text, written in Babylonian cuneiform and preserved on a large clay foundation cylinder, that had come to light in Babylon a year earlier. Known today as the Cyrus Cylinder, this singular document not only details the capture of Babylon by Cyrus II in 539 b.c., but also Cyrus’ evident concern to project his kingship in Babylonian terms to a Babylonian audience. Susa and Elam, which were found to ﬁgure prominently in the records of Assyria, and which were already familiar from Biblical accounts, soon became a particular focus of attention. In 1891, the redoubtable German scholar F. H. Weissbach published what he called “anzanische” and “susischen Inschriften.” But it was the creation of the Délégation Scientiﬁque Française en Perse in 1897 that marked the true birth of Elamite archaeology (Chevalier 1992). In the meantime, Marcel-Auguste Dieulafoy (1844–1920), with his wife Jane (1851–1916), 4. The chronology of what is today known as the Neo-Elamite period, ca. 1000–539 b.c., is notoriously difﬁcult and much debated. Our dating of the end of the Neo-Elamite period is unconventional. Most place the end of the Neo-Elamite period with the conquest of Babylonia by Cyrus II (e.g., Miroschedji 2003: 37 with references). While this is certainly a ﬁxed date, the impact of this event on Susa is anything but clear. The situation is made more complex by on-going recent discussions on the ethnicity of Cyrus II (see, e.g., the contributions by Waters, Quintana, Potts, and Garrison in this volume). Potts 1999: 259–62 provides a concise overview of the main chronologies that have been proposed for the Neo-Elamite period. Steve, Vallat, and Gasche 2002: 470, have recently reiterated a tripartite periodization, with period III dating to ca. 585–539 b.c. 5. Rawlinson’s considerable role in the decipherment of Old Persian cuneiform did not of course stand in isolation. For the signiﬁcant place of other gifted contributors, such as G. F. Grotefend (1775–1853) and Edward Hincks (1792–1886), see Finkel 2005: 26–29 for a concise summary.\n\n00-Elam_Persia.book Page 4 Friday, December 10, 2010 4:54 PM\n\n4\n\nÁlvarez-Mon, Garrison, and Stronach\n\nhad conducted substantial excavations at Susa in 1885–1886 and, in accord with these prior endeavors, Susa became the strategic center of operations for the Délégation from the end of 1897 onward. 6 Direction of the Délégation, and of the work at Susa, was initially entrusted to Jacques de Morgan (1857–1924). An experienced mining engineer, Morgan was nevertheless wholly unfamiliar with the complex characteristics of an ancient mound settlement and, when he turned his attention to what was intended to be “the complete excavation of the Acropole mound” (Carter 1992: 22), he introduced a single grande tranchée that was 100 m long and which descended in successive steps, each 5 m in depth (Morgan 1905a: 5–6). Even by the standards of the early 20th century, the excavations were crude and the documentation almost nonexistent. 7 The nature of the early excavations was also especially disastrous where the late NeoElamite levels were concerned. Given their proximity to the Achaemenid levels and, hence, to the major constructions that came to typify the city under Darius and his successors, the NeoElamite strata that can still be detected are relatively ephemeral at best (see also below, pp. 5–6). At the same time, the early excavations under Morgan’s direction soon yielded numerous cuneiform texts, and the expedition’s eminent Assyriologist, Father Jean-Vincent Scheil (1858–1940), a member of the Dominican Order, was able to devote the whole second volume of the newly instituted Mémoires de la Délégation en Perse to the publication of cuneiform materials. As he chose to put matters in his introduction, “Ici commence l’histoire du pays d’Élam. On peut marquer ainsi, sans emphase, le début de ce livre” (Scheil 1900: vii). Indeed, with the discovery of the ﬁrst texts written in Elamite, “Elam” could now take its place, with Assyria and Babylonia, as one of the established, literate polities of ancient western Asia. It was Father Scheil who also ﬁrst thought he could detect intriguing indications of cultural duality among the Elamites. Based on what he took to be evidence for the presence of two distinct languages, “anzanite” and “sémitique,” in the texts from Susa, and well aware of the traditional title, “King of Anzan and Susa” in Elamite royal inscriptions, Scheil argued in favor of an “ethnic duality” represented by Elamite (or “anzanite”) elements and Semitic (or “susienne”) elements. While he viewed the “anzanite” texts as being imported from Ansan, the so-called Semitic texts were taken to be representative of the indigenous language of Susa. 8 For the most part, this view of the cultural character of ancient Elam remained in place for many years.\n\n6. The history of explorations and excavations at Susa, starting with the visit by A. H. Layard in 1841, is now carefully chronicled in Steve, Vallat, and Gasche 2002: 375–403. 7. In defense of the French Mission, it may be noted that it was far from alone in its poor methods of excavation and documentation. As late as the last quarter of the 19th century comparable multilayered mud-brick tells were excavated throughout western Asia with a similar total misunderstanding of stratigraphy and architecture. Such was the case, for instance, with reference to the excavations of Ernest de Sarzec at the Sumerian city of Girsu and with reference to the University of Pennsylvania’s original excavations at Nippur, conducted between 1888 and 1900. It was in fact the German architect and ancient historian Robert Johann Koldewey (1855–1925) who, in working at two Sumerian sites in southern Iraq in 1887, introduced the techniques of tracing and excavating mud-brick. Koldewey further developed and applied his innovations in his large-scale archaeological excavations at Babylon, Borsippa, and Fara. These methods were also employed by his former student, Walter Andrae, at Assur (1902–1914). In particular, both Koldewey and Andrae took the time to train teams of local workers in the techniques required to trace and expose mud-brick remains (see Matthews 2003: 11–12). 8.

Between 1900 and 1911 seven volumes in the MDP series appeared under his name. The texts from one of these volumes, MDP 9 (Scheil 1907), still ﬁgure prominently in almost every fresh assessment of the late Neo-Elamite period. These documents, excavated in 1901 on the Acropole and today generally referred to as the Acropole texts, include some 299 tablets. 9 In language and script, the texts can be identiﬁed as Neo-Elamite. Scheil had, however, little if any closely comparable material to assist him in understanding these cuneiform texts, which even today pose many problems. They do constitute, nevertheless, the single most abundant set of primary documents of late Neo-Elamite date from Susa. While the 1930s saw the introduction of various excavations that would have important implications for different Bronze Age or older phases of Elamite archaeology, including the excavations at the Middle Elamite site of Coba Zanbil, located some 40 km to the southeast of Susa, and those of still earlier import at Tepe Sialk on the Iranian plateau, it was, curiously, the excavations at Persepolis, the principal residence of the Achaemenid kings in Fars, that radically transformed the modern study of the late Neo-Elamite period. When Ernst Herzfeld (1879– 1948) began his excavations at Persepolis in 1931, his goal was to expose the monumental structures of the Achaemenids. Little did he expect to recover an archive consisting of thousands of clay tablets written in Elamite. In 1933, however, just such a discovery was made at a point where Herzfeld elected to cut a passage through the northern mud-brick fortiﬁcation wall of the site in order to facilitate the evacuation of earth from adjoining parts of the Terrace. In line with this circumstance, the texts from this unlikely location have become known as the Fortiﬁcation archive. 10 Although dated to the middle years of the reign of Darius I, the texts and seal impressions from the Fortiﬁcation archive have in fact become major sources for the study of the late Neo-Elamite period (see also below, pp. 23–25). Neither George Cameron (1905–1979) in 1936 nor René Labat (1904–1974) in 1975 found it possible to include comprehensive treatments of the Neo-Elamite period in their pioneer reconstructions of the ancient history of Iran. Thanks, however, to the widening scale of archaeological work in Iran, beginning in the 1960s, more and more sites came to be investigated which threw new light, in various ways, on the history of ancient Elam. Within Khuzestan, for example, P. Delougaz (1901–1975) and H. Kantor (1919–1993) undertook major excavations at the long-occupied site of Coba Mis and E. O. Negahban introduced large-scale excavations at the important Middle Elamite site of Kabnak (modern Haft Tepe). Also, while David Stronach’s excavations at Pasargadae, the unﬁnished capital of Cyrus II, did not yield any traces of 1st-millennium occupation pre-dating the mid-forties of the 6th century b.c., his subsequent, published observations (e.g., Stronach 1978), may be said to touch on many questions that pertain to late Elam and Persia, as well as to the careers of Cyrus and Darius. In strictly archival terms, the publication of F. W. König’s Die elamischen Königsinschriften (1965) provided ready access to the Elamite royal inscriptions, including those of Neo-Elamite date. Despite the meagerness of the archaeological record, references to the Neo-Elamite period began to enter mainstream publications in the 1960s. This is reﬂected in three works in particular: Alt Iran by Edith Porada (1912–1994), published in 1962, with French and English 9. To the 298 Acropole texts published in MDP 9 is generally added text MDP 11, 309, bringing the total number of Acropole texts to 299. On these texts, see also below, pp. 15–16. 10. Garrison and Root 2001: 1–7, 23–32 give an overview of the Fortiﬁcation archive and its discovery. See now Henkelman 2008: 65–179; Briant, Henkelman, and Stolper 2008.\n\n00-Elam_Persia.book Page 6 Friday, December 10, 2010 4:54 PM\n\n6\n\nÁlvarez-Mon, Garrison, and Stronach\n\ntranslations appearing in 1963 and 1965 respectively; Elam by Pierre Amiet, published in 1966; and Das Reich Elam by Walter Hinz (1906–1992), published in 1964 and reissued in English in 1972 under the title The Lost World of Elam: Re-Creation of a Vanished Civilization. As W. Hinz chose, however, to stress: . . . at present those ﬁnds and monuments which have come to light do not justify a detailed description of the (Neo-Elamite) period; it is possible that the position may change if further digs are undertaken in Susiana, and in the mountains of Luristan and . . . western Fars (Hinz 1972: 178).\n\nHinz’s plea for greater exploration was at least partially answered in the 1970s by a burst of archaeological activity throughout southwestern Iran. Intensive surveys, sometimes combined with excavations, were conducted in both Khuzestan and Fars. 11 In the former region, the reconstituted expedition at Susa speciﬁcally targeted Neo-Elamite levels in the area known as Ville Royal II (Miroschedji 1976, 1981, 1982). Nevertheless, the available Neo-Elamite levels were not extensive, and the period remains poorly represented at the site as a whole. 12 The most signiﬁcant progress came, in fact, from new research that concentrated on highland Elam. To begin with, John Hansman (1972) published an article that indicated that the extensive mound at Tall-i Malyan, located some 50 km northwest of Persepolis, could very well represent the surviving remains of the long lost eastern Elamite capital, Ansan. This cogent suggestion was almost at once conﬁrmed by inscribed evidence found on the surface of the site (Reiner 1973), and these and other related considerations induced William Sumner to begin seven successive seasons of excavation at Malyan between 1972 and 1977. 13 Although Sumner’s excavations failed to identify the presence of any late Neo-Elamite occupation levels, the revelation that Ansan had been a major walled city of ca. 200 hectares from the late 4th millennium onward had no little effect on Elamite studies as a whole. 14 In 1979, for example, Pierre Amiet proposed that, over time, a pattern of oscillating highland and lowland inﬂuences could be recognized at Susa and that the existence of such competing components should be added to Scheil’s earlier recognition of Elam’s “ethnic duality.” Pierre de Miroschedji (1980) also addressed the issue of cultural duality, most notably in terms of political and religious concepts. And, with reference to a further, more radical suggestion, François Vallat (1980) went so far as to propose that the true heart of Elam was not to be found at Susa; instead he chose to place it in Fars and, more expressly, in the Kur River basin, i.e., in the vicinity of Ansan. Perhaps the most important publication on the late Neo-Elamite period to appear in the 1970s was P. Amiet’s (1973) study of late Neo-Elamite glyptic. Amiet assembled, for the ﬁrst time, a corpus of imagery that he considered diagnostic for the late Neo-Elamite period. Given the lack of data in other traditional areas of research (e.g., in sculpture, architecture, or molded brick), this corpus of glyptic imagery remains central to any analysis of late Neo-Elamite ma11. Reference to much of this work may be found in Carter 1984: 109–10. See also Wright and Carter 2003. 12. “Archéologiquement, le Néo-élamite est à Suse une des périodes les plus méconnues et des plus mal représentées” (Steve, Vallat, and Gasche 2002: 470). 13. For the overall results of the excavations, see Sumner 1988. 14. Strictly in terms of possible Neo-Elamite activities at the site, Elizabeth Carter (1994: 66, ﬁg. 3) has drawn attention to a burial in area DD43, which included a faience seal with conceivable connections to Iron Age glyptic from Marlik.

In this same publication, Amiet also argued for an Elamite renaissance at Susa in the period directly after 625 b.c. 15 The Iranian Revolution in 1979 brought an end to one of the most proliﬁc periods of ﬁeld research in Iran. With only a few exceptions (most notably with reference to the discovery of the tomb at Arjan), the intervening years have not seen any major additions to the primary documentation available for the study of either the late Neo-Elamite period or the beginnings of a separate, identiﬁable Persian entity. This hiatus has provided space, however, for the publication of data collected before 1979 and for a critical re-examination of earlier scholarship. Needless to say, a number of new conceptual paradigms are beginning to take shape. The identiﬁcation of the last “kings” of Susa and the dates that should be ascribed to them are matters that have traditionally attracted much debate. Elamite royal inscriptions, mainly from Susa, and contemporaneous Assyro-Babylonian sources provide royal names and the ﬁliations of various late Elamite kings, but the two data sets are notoriously difﬁcult to reconcile. 16 Several royal names of this period occur only once, or infrequently, and on objects which have no secure archaeological context. In most modern assessments it is assumed that these royal names belonged to “kings of Elam,” but the exact extent of the territory that was controlled by such rulers in the late 7th and 6th centuries b.c. remains unresolved. It is noteworthy that at Susa the resonant title “king of Ansan and Susa” came to be revived in the Neo-Elamite period and that it is even attested in inscriptions from Susa that post-date the Assyrian destruction. 17 Nevertheless, this apparent claim to highland as well as lowland dominion clearly has to be weighed against the probable existence of a separate line of rulers at Ansan whose names and titles are preserved in the famous Cyrus Cylinder. 18 A cautious approach would conﬁne the territorial extent of the late Neo-Elamite kings at Susa to Susa and its environs. 19 However, as mentioned above, Amiet (1973) postulated a period of cultural and political renaissance at Susa in the years after 625 b.c. This was seen, in other words, as a relatively rare late interval when the Elamites were free of political domination by any outside power. 20 15. The date is based upon the Nabopolassar Chronicle in which Nabopolassar is said to have returned to Susa the (Susian) gods that the Assyrians had carried off to Uruk (Amiet 1973: 24). 16. For surveys of the evidence, see most recently Vallat 1984; Miroschedji 1985, 1990; Vallat 1996, 1998; Potts 1999: 288–302; Waters 2000; Steve, Vallat, and Gasche 2002: 478–486; Henkelman 2003a, 2003b; Tavernier 2004. 17. Vallat 1996: 392–94 distinguishes a Neo-Elamite III A period, where the kings still carry the title “king of Ansan and Susa” and rule territory from Susa, and a Neo-Elamite III B period in which the “roitelets” rule only Susa and its environs. 18. See, for example, Potts 2005: 13–15, 22–23; Waters, this volume. Kingship at Ansan may also be reﬂected in PFS 93* (see Waters, Quintana, and Garrison, this volume). 19. From the late 8th century b.c. onward, it is generally recognized that the cultural landscape of Elam was far from being what it had been in the glory days of the Middle Elamite empire. Miroschedji (2003: 34– 36) remarks that the major internal factors included a modiﬁcation/regression of the Elamite ethnic element as a result of the expansion of the Iranian tribes in the highlands and the presence of additional pressures from Aramean and Chaldean tribes in the lowlands. He also notes a marked increase in pastoralism accompanied, not surprisingly, by a sharp decline in urban settlement. As a response to these internal factors, coupled with the persistent threat of Assyria, the late Elamite kings “resorted to a decentralized political organization, with three capitals: Susa, Madaktu and Hidalu.” In addition, Miroschedji now sees the period after the sack of Susa by Ashurbanipal as one of Elamite political disintegration and fragmentation. 20. Followers of this interpretation include Vallat, who posits the creation of two separate kingdoms, that of Susa, which extended eastward to the foothills of the Zagros, and that of Ansan, which encompassed the adjacent southwestern highlands (Vallat 1984: 7–8 and 1996; also Miroschedji 1982 and 1990: 78–81). But for a new, less sanguine interpretation, see (as noted above in n. 19) the comments of Miroschedji 2003: 35–36.\n\n00-Elam_Persia.book Page 8 Friday, December 10, 2010 4:54 PM\n\n8\n\nÁlvarez-Mon, Garrison, and Stronach\n\nGiven the prominent place of the Medes in Herodotus’ narrative, it should also not be forgotten that modern commentators were frequently persuaded, at least until a few years ago, that the Medes were one of the main arbiters of power in Khuzestan and Fars in the ﬁrst half of the 6th century b.c. 21 Above all, the spectacular rise of the Persians was viewed as a salient break in the traditional continuities of ancient western Asia and, in this context, it was generally assumed that the Persians took their cultural and political cues from their more northerly Iranian cousins, the Medes. 22 Within the past twenty years scholars have begun to question almost all aspects of this “Median” perspective. In the absence of written records from Media itself, many historians have begun to take a highly skeptical view of the actual existence of a 7th/6th century Median kingdom. 23 In fact, it has been left to archaeologists, drawing on the more characteristic elements of Median material culture (as now attested at such sites as Tepe Nush-i Jan and Ozbaki Tepe), to attempt to deﬁne the probable limits of Median rule, at least within the approximate bounds of northern Iran (Stronach 2003a; Stronach and Roaf 2007). The removal of the Medes from any longstanding role in the affairs of southwestern Iran has provided, in effect, vital “intellectual space” in which to review the speciﬁc role of Elam in the formation of a Persian identity. 24 A central part of this reassessment has been a growing realization, based upon the excavations and surveys connected by the Tall-i Malyan Project in the 1970s, that pastoralism may very well have been the dominant lifestyle in Fars during much of the early 1st millennium b.c. 25 Against this background, Pierre de Miroschedji (1985) has argued for an “ethnogenese des Perses” in the Kur River basin through the acculturation of a mixed Elamite-Iranian population. 26 This approach may also be said to be fortiﬁed by the likely Elamite origin of the name Kuras from which the Old Persian name Kurus (Cyrus) is derived. 27 21. Potts (1999: 294–95) surveys some of the scholarship on the role of the Medes in Elam. Note also Henkelmann’s (2003a) observations. 22. An example of this perspective, as Liverani (2003: 10) notes, was the assumption, at the time when the Bisotun inscriptions were ﬁrst being deciphered, that the enigmatic third language would turn out to be Median. It proved, of course, to be Elamite. 23. See especially, Liverani 2003. 24. The idea that Elam may have played a major role in the genesis of the Persian ethnos and the formation of a complex state in Fars can be seen in some earlier scholarship; e.g., Rostovtzeff (1926: 125) remarked that in “550 b.c. the Median kingdom was conquered by Cyrus, the ﬁfth king of the Persian tribe, which had probably been long connected with Elam and had inherited from that source its civilization and capacity for political development.” In a similar vein, Hinz (1972: 178) observed that “when Elam was incorporated into the Achaemenid Empire in 538, the Persians inherited its art and civilization. For some time before this, they had proﬁted from an Elamite education; they had been countrymen and neighbors on their eastern border since about 695.” 25. The critical survey work in the Kur River basin is reported in Sumner 1986 and 1994. 26. This paradigm is dramatically different from that based on the classical sources in which the “Persian empire” is seen as developing directly out of Media. The acculturated Elamite-Iranian model has gained considerable support (e.g., Briant 1984; Boucharlat 1994: 217, 221–24, 227–28; Amiet 1994: 63–64; Henkelman 2003a: 186–89, 196; Miroschedji 2003: 35; Potts 2005: 22–23; Henkelman 2008: 43–49; Garrison 2006). Potts 1999: 306–7 articulates the rise of the Achaemenids as simply a change of leadership in Elam “via an ethnoclasse dominante” (following Briant 1988; 1990: 53–54). Stronach (2003: 251 and 258) says that parts of Fars were under “autonomous Persian control” and Parsumas was one of the “principle political entities” in southwestern Iran by 647 b.c. Note also that many commentators have posited an “Elamite” political authority (in some degree, perhaps, independent) in Susa up to the time of Darius: see, e.g., Miroschedji 1982: 61–62; Carter and Stolper 1984: 54; Boucharlat 1994: 218, 220–21; Henkelman 2003a: 262; Tavernier 2004: 22–29. 27. E.g., Stronach 1997: 38; Henkelman 2003a: 194–96; Potts 2005: 21; Tavernier 2007: 528–30 (Kuras, s.v.). See also the contributions by Waters and Tavernier in this volume for full bibliography.\n\n00-Elam_Persia.book Page 9 Friday, December 10, 2010 4:54 PM\n\nIntroduction\n\n9\n\nIndeed, one may now speak of the “Persian” population of 6th century Fars as one that consisted, to no small extent, of an acculturated highland population. 28 The extent to which this was the case is perhaps most vividly expressed in Mario Liverani’s (2003: 10) dictum that “Persia is the heir of Elam, not of Media.” As a result of these various studies, there is a growing awareness that the line between a Persian identity and an Elamite identity, especially in 6th century Fars, would often have been hard to detect. 29 A separate proposal to place the effective beginnings of Achaemenid Persian art in, say, the late 7th century b.c. reﬂects a similar awareness. 30 It ought to come as no surprise, moreover, that this perspective had already been anticipated by Amiet (1973) when he observed of the corpus of late Neo-Elamite glyptic that he had assembled “qu’on peut aussi bien la considérer comme l’ultime manifestation de la civilization élamite que comme la première manifestation de l’art perse.”\n\n(. . . ) The papers in this volume approach various issues surrounding the late Elamite period and the early Achaemenid Persian period from a variety of perspectives. On many aspects of late Neo-Elamite culture, there is no consensus; the reader will often note in the contributions to this volume differing opinions on the dates of speciﬁc artifacts and corpora of material and various reconstructions of those social and political processes that have been inferred from the material and textual record. The editors have made no attempt to bring consistency to the views expressed in this volume. A summary overview of the main body of evidence for the late NeoElamite and the early Achaemenid periods, and how it factors into the contributions in this volume, may serve, as it were, to set the stage for the contributions that follow.\n\nAssyro-Babylonian Royal Texts To this day, the analysis and interpretation of the royal inscriptions from Assyria and Babylonia, primarily royal annals from Assyria, remain pivotal to most historical reconstructions of the Neo-Elamite period, especially the years leading up to Ashurbanipal’s sack of Susa in his ﬁfth Elamite campaign, ca. 647 b.c. While the Assyro-Babylonian texts are less informative about the genesis of the Achaemenid Persians, they remain, nonetheless, a critical resource for this topic as well. Scholarship today often hesitates to take the rhetorical devices in Assyrian texts at face value; this has not always been the case. Thus the explicit description of the destruction of Susa by 28. Potts 2005: 22–23; Henkelman 2006: 15–33. Briant (2002: 21–24, 27–28) stresses an Elamite legacy in political and social affairs for the Persian kings Cyrus II through Darius I. Waters (2004) discusses the role of intermarriage between the Achaemenids and the Teispids. 29. Although the careful remarks of Potts (2005) regarding the distinction between an Ansanite empire established by “Kurush, king of Anshan” and a Persian empire established by Darius I reminds us of the degree to which appeals to separate strands of local identity may have remained politically signiﬁcant throughout the 6th century b.c. 30. See especially Stronach 2003b: 258, who proposes that, with reference to art-historical terminology, the beginning of the Achaemenid period ought to be pushed back to ca. 635 b.c. In political terms, Waters 1999: 105 suggests an even earlier date, ca. 691–646 b.c., for the “change from Elamite to Persian political domination in Fars” and the foundation of an “independent Persian kingdom.”\n\n00-Elam_Persia.book Page 10 Friday, December 10, 2010 4:54 PM\n\n10\n\nÁlvarez-Mon, Garrison, and Stronach\n\nAshurbanipal—published in part in 1871 by George Smith and in its entirety in 1880 by H. C. Rawlinson and T. G. Pinches—was originally seen to conﬁrm the results of the 1897/8 excavations at Susa. In one explicit statement made in the ﬁrst volume of the Mémoires de la Délégation en Perse (1900), J. de Morgan suggested, for example, that evidence found under the Achaemenid levels at the northern tip of the Acropolis demonstrated that: . . . anzanite Susa was burned out; we knew it already by the accounts that Assurbanipal transmitted to us. Thus the description provided by the Assyrian texts gives the most satisfactory explanation to the evidence that I have just listed . . . the ruin was complete, we found its traces with each strike of a pike in trenches 3, 7, 7a, 8, 13, and 14 (Morgan 1900: 97–98). 31\n\nThe Assyrian sources end very soon after 647 b.c. and are therefore of little use for the late Neo-Elamite period that ﬁgures so prominently in this collection of essays. As mentioned above, the exact status of Susa after the Assyrian destruction is a topic of on-going debate. Clearly, life went on at Susa (and Elam as a whole) after the Assyrian conquest; indeed, few today accept at face-value the picture of total destruction presented in Ashurbanipal’s texts. Henkelman and Álvarez-Mon in their contributions to this volume each explore the issue of the political status of Elam in the post-destruction period, and each argues for a political and cultural revival at Susa. Near the end of his reign, as recorded in the latest edition of Ashurbanipal’s annals (Edition A, ca. 643 b.c.), two Iranian leaders, Kuras, king of Parsumas, and Pislumê, king of Hudimiri, sent tribute to Ashurbanipal, the former also sending a son, Arukku. 32 This event is re-visited in the contributions by Garrison, Waters, and Quintana in this volume. As the reader will see, there is still no consensus on where the kingdom of Parsumas lay, nor whether this Kuras king of Parsumas was the same individual as ‘Kuras, king of Ansan,’ the grandfather of Cyrus II named in the Cyrus Cylinder. 33 The potential linkage of ‘Kuras, son of Sespes’ (Teispes), named on PFS 93*, with one or both of these individuals also provides room for still further speculation. 31. “. . . la Suse anzanite fut incendiée; nous le savions déjà par les récits que nous a transmis Assourbanipal. Aussi la description fournie par les textes assyriens donne-t-elle l’explication la plus satisfaisante des constatations que je viens d’énumérer . . . . La ruine fut complète, nous en retrouvons les traces à chaque coup de pioche dans les tranchées 3, 7, 7a, 8, 13, et 14.” These comments are echoed in the same volume by journalist turned-archaeologist Georges Lampre (1855–1912), who, writing about trenches 7 and 7a situated in the south of the Tell de la Citadelle (a section of the large religious complex on the Acropolis, also known for having hosted a large number of Elamite and Mesopotamian artifacts such as the famous stele of Naram-Sin and the Code of Hammurabi), indicates: Cette couche correspond à l’ère de transition qui dura plus d’un siècle, depuis la conquête d’Assourbanipal jusqu’à l’avènement des Achémenides. Après avoir détruit de fond en comble les temples, les palais, les tombeaux, les rois d’Élam . . . (Lampre 1900: 109). It is worth noticing that the translation of Ashurbanipal’s sack of Susa by G. Smith (1871) is unequivocal as to which parts of the city were burned, looted, and destroyed, and which ones were not: “On my return, when Assur and Ishtar exalted me over my enemies, Sushan the great city, the seat of their Gods, the place of their oracle, I captured. By the will of Assur and Ishtar, into its palaces I entered and sat with rejoicing [account of the palace looting follows] (p. 224, line 46). The tower of Shushan, which in the lower part in marble(?) was laid, I destroyed. I broke through its top, which was covered with shining bronze [account of the temples’ desecration follows] (p. 227, line 71). . . . their forest groves, which any other had not penetrated into the midst, had not trodden their outskirts; my men of war into them entered, saw their groves, and burned [them] in the ﬁre (p. 99, line 99). Their wells of drinking water I dried them up, for a journey of a month and twenty-ﬁve days the districts of Elam I laid to waste. . . .” (p. 232, line 112). 32. The event is frequently discussed; see, e.g., Potts 1999: 287–88 for various interpretations. Waters contribution in this volume charts the events preserved in the Assyrian texts in some detail. 33. Discussed most fully in the contribution by M. Waters in this volume.\n\n00-Elam_Persia.book Page 11 Friday, December 10, 2010 4:54 PM\n\nIntroduction\n\n11\n\nWhile the Assyrian texts provide Elamite royal names and chronological markers, they also may be mined for evidence concerning Assyrian constructions of ethnic/cultural identity within the parameters of the Assyrian imagination. Waters, Root, and Garrison each explore the signiﬁcance of the imagery of the Elamite bow and the broken bow in Assyrian texts and reliefs. Álvarez-Mon in his study of the Arjan ring attempts to situate Ashurbanipal’s interest in Elam both within a politico-military context as well as a history of personal interaction between members of the House of Esarhaddon and the House of Urtak. In the palace reliefs of Nineveh and the Assyrian annals he attempts to reconstruct something of the social history and personal experience of Elamite nobles in Assyria. This experience, in his opinion, played a critical role in the transmission of Assyrian visual language to Elam (see also Álvarez-Mon 2009).\n\nAssyrian Palace Reliefs The Assyrian wall reliefs that adorned the public and private chambers of the palaces at Nineveh include numerous scenes in which Elamites are depicted. Some of the most-often discussed scenes include (see Álvarez-Mon 2009 for a comprehensive listing): The battle of Til-Tuba, on the River Ulai, where Ashurbanipal’s army defeated Te-Umman, king of Elam. Versions were found in both the Southwest Palace and the North Palace at Nineveh. 34 A scene of homage at Madaktu in Elam, from the Southwest Palace at Nineveh. 35 The installation of Ummanigas in Susa, from the North Palace at Nineveh. 36 The temple and ziggurat of an Elamite city, presumably Susa, from the North Palace at Nineveh. 37 Ashurbanipal reclining at an outdoor banquet in the presence of a seated female, female attendants and musicians, eunuchs, and captive Elamite and Babylonian princes. The severed head of the defeated Te-Umman hangs from a tree to the left of the king. The scene is from the North Palace at Nineveh. 38 Ashurbanipal hunting lions with [Ummana]pp[a, son of U]rtak of Elam, from the North Palace at Nineveh. 39 At least three Elamites depositing bows at the feet of Ashurbanipal who, while he hunts, unleashes an arrow over their heads; from the North Palace at Nineveh. 40\n\n34. The battle is dated ca. 653 b.c. The scenes are preserved on slabs 1–3 from room XXXIII of the Southwest Palace (Barnett et al. 1998: 94–95, pls. 286–99, with an excellent bibliography). Slabs 1–6 (presumably, slabs 2–4 and 8 are now lost) from Room I of the North Palace (Barnett 1976: pls. 24–25). Russell 1999: 154– 209 reviews the evidence from both of the palaces. See also the discussion by Garrison in this volume. 35. Slabs 4–6 from room XXXIII of the Southwest Palace (Barnett et al. 1998: 96–97, pls. 300–313). 36.

As noted above, Elamite bows in Assyrian reliefs, broken and whole, and their metaphorical allusions, are recurring themes in the contributions by Garrison, Waters, and Root. Root also argues that the famous lion hunts from the North Palace are a form of allegory for Ashurbanipal’s military campaigns against the Elamites. Both Álvarez-Mon and Root explore Assyrian texts and reliefs for the ramiﬁcations of captivity for extended royal families at an Assyrian capital city. Álvarez-Mon describes the widespread occurrence of Elamites in Ashurbanipal’s sculptural program at Nineveh as an “obsession” indicative of a history of personal interaction between members of the House of Esarhaddon and the House of Urtak. Lastly, styles of carving as preserved in Assyrian palace reliefs and small-scale art, primarily ivories and seals, ﬁgure prominently in Álvarez-Mon’s study of the gold ring from Arjan, Garrison’s stylistic analysis of PFS 93* and PFS 51, and Hassanzadeh and Mollasalehi’s study of glazed tiles from Qalaichi. Each of these authors points to strong Assyrian stylistic inﬂuences in Elam, even if the modes of transfer of such inﬂuences, and the implications of their presence in Khuzestan, Fars, and Mannea, remain issues of debate.\n\nPFS 93* As Garrison notes in his separate contribution to this volume, perhaps the single most-often discussed artifact of late Neo-Elamite date is the remarkable seal, PFS 93*, that is known from multiple impressions in the Persepolis Fortiﬁcation archive. This seal, an “heirloom” at the time of its use in the Fortiﬁcation archive, shows an impressive scene of a horseman spearing an opponent, who turns to hold out his quiver of arrows and his broken bow as an act of submission. Below the horseman are two fallen foes. 41 The Elamite inscription seems to read either ‘Kuras the Anzanite, Son of Sespes’ or ‘Kuras of Anzan, Son of Sespes.’ Herzfeld, only a short time after the excavation of the Fortiﬁcation archive in 1933/34, had already, rather remarkably, singled out impressions of PFS 93* as highly signiﬁcant. 42 As Hallock worked on the texts and seal impressions from the archive, he appears to have informed others about the seal, and he included the inscription in his glossary (Hallock 1969: Kuras, s.v.). Amiet (1973) published the ﬁrst drawing of the seal, classifying it within his corpus of late NeoElamite glyptic; thereafter, the seal appeared in a wide variety of discussions concerning late Neo-Elamite art, culture, and political/social history, and it continues to be widely illustrated and discussed. The inscription on PFS 93* has generated the greater part of scholarly discourse on the seal. Some of the questions most commonly encountered include: the precise reading of the second word in the inscription, aßan-za-an-x-ra (see the discussions by Waters, Garrison, Tavernier, Vallat, and Quintana in this volume); the precise signiﬁcance of that word (Garrison, Waters, and Quintana in this volume); how this word is understood within the Elamite tradition of ‘Kings of Ansan and Susa’ and Cyrus II’s titulary ‘King of Ansan’ (Garrison and Waters in this 41. Note, however, Quintana’s article in this volume, where the seal is viewed as contemporary with the Fortiﬁcation archive. 42.

In sum, the linking of the Kuras named in the inscription on PFS 93* to a known (and datable) ruler is still an issue of considerable debate; as a result, the precise date of the seal remains contested. While assessments of the signiﬁcance of the inscription have dominated the discourse on PFS 93*, the ﬁgural imagery and style of the seal have also periodically generated comment. The compositional dynamics, style, and iconography of the seal are addressed in some detail in the contribution by Garrison, who argues for a “high” dating of the seal to the time of Ashurbanipal. In sum, a consensus has yet to emerge on PFS 93*, even if virtually all commentators agree that the seal, its imagery, and inscription have signiﬁcant implications connected with a wide range of issues.\n\nAnsan The critical importance of both the actual place/region and the concept of Ansan within Elamite culture has long been recognized (see the discussions by Potts, Waters, and Garrison in this volume). While the excavations at Tall-i Malyan in the 1970s established deﬁnitively that the site was ancient Ansan, they did not resolve long-standing debates about the political/territorial limits implied by the concept of Ansan. The only very slight evidence for any kind of settlement on the site at Tall-i Malyan after 1000 b.c. has also compounded the difﬁculties inherent in trying to understand the signiﬁcance of the titulary of both the Neo-Elamite kings at Susa and the Ansanite Teispid line, represented most fully by Cyrus II. Were these references to Ansan anachronistic, or was Ansan a place that still existed in the 7th and 6th centuries b.c.? Again, opinion remains divided on these questions (see in this volume Potts, who argues that the term Ansan signiﬁed a place, not a region, in the 1st millennium b.c.). That Neo-Elamite kings at Susa actually had political control of the highlands seems unlikely, especially in the post-Assyrian destruction era. Most probably, the revival of the title ‘King of Ansan and Susa’ was no more than rhetorical. The emphatic and repeated invocation of Ansan in the titulary of Cyrus II seems at odds with the archaeological evidence from the site, but, as Potts (2005: 21) has noted, 7th- and/or 6th-century levels may well exist in unexcavated areas of the site. The qualiﬁcation of Kuras as of Anzan or the Anzanite in PFS 93* surely cannot be fortuitous or without signiﬁcance to this discussion. While many have sought to downplay the importance of the inscription owing to the fact that this Kuras the Anzanite does not label either himself or his father as kings (see Waters and Quintana in this volume), in truth we have no highlands evidence for the royal titulary of the early members of the house of Teispes (see Garrison in this volume). The Ansan question is of major import with reference to how we understand the complex period following the death of Cyrus II and the ascent of Darius I (see Waters, Potts, and Vallat in this volume). Whether Darius was an interloper (Potts and Waters), or a descendant of Cyrus and hence a legitimate king (Vallat), remains a point of contention.\n\n00-Elam_Persia.book Page 14 Friday, December 10, 2010 4:54 PM\n\n14\n\nÁlvarez-Mon, Garrison, and Stronach\n\nMaterial from the Zagros Region The formidable Chaîne Magistrale separating the lowlands of Mesopotamia from the Iranian Plateau includes numerous valleys and some open plains which, in ancient times, were home to a great variety of local cultures. Unfortunately, the almost total absence of autochthonous written documents, coupled with limited archaeological ﬁeldwork and modern forgeries, has fundamentally handicapped our understanding of social and political processes in the ancient highland cultures of the Zagros Mountains (see, e.g., Muscarella 2000a, 2000b). Assyrian texts provide a small window into the diversity of towns, rulers, tribes, and kingdoms occupying parts of the northern and central Zagros during the 1st millennium b.c. The Assyrians’ interest in maintaining political and even territorial control of certain parts of the Zagros territory can be discerned from their (sometimes peaceful, sometimes adversarial) engagement with local political entities. Some of the named places/regions—Zamua, Gilzanu, Mada, Parsua, Manna, Ellipi, and many others—are known to us only through Assyrian accounts. 43 A resource-oriented view of the Assyrian involvement in the Zagros suggests that control of lands for purposes of pasture and optimal breeding grounds for horses (and the horses themselves) may have been a key motivation for the attempts to incorporate certain parts of the Zagros into the Assyrian empire (Greco 2003; Reade 2003). 44 Identifying in the material record the impact of Assyrian interests in the Zagros is a complex task. Very little is known of the actual cultural “identity” of polities located in the central Zagros. Did substantial (and visible) local or regional cultural markers exist? When luxury items associated with powerful political centers such as Assyria are found in the Zagros, what are we to make of them? It is against this broad political and cultural background that Y. Hassanzadeh and H. Mollasalehi examine the autochthonous artistic production from Qalaichi Tepe, identiﬁed as the ancient Mannean capital of Izirtu. Based on new evidence supplied by three glazed tiles from the site, the authors delineate key characteristics of both a Mannean artistic identity and a broader, regional artistic identity that they characterize as a Zagros koine. 45 43. Two telling examples illustrate the nature of Assyrian and Elamite involvement in the Zagros close to 700 b.c. The ﬁrst is related to the war of succession in 708/7 b.c. in the strategic kingdom of Ellipi, located in the northwestern Pish-i Kuh area of Luristan bordering Elam (Medvedskaya 1999: 63–64; Fuchs and Parpola 2001: 29). The second was the battle of Halule in 691 b.c. The Elamite king Huban-menanu was successful at assembling a coalition of Zagros forces (represented by Parsua, Pasiru, Ellipi, and Ansan) and Babylonians (including Chaldean and Aramean forces) against Assyria. According to Babylonian sources, victory went to the coalition; Sennacherib claimed victory for the Assyrians (Grayson 2000: 80; Luckenbill 1927: 89). In reality, the outcome of the engagement may have been close to a draw. Thus, while the Babylonians could in the end claim that the Assyrians were obliged to “withdraw,” Sennacherib appears to have registered battleﬁeld successes at the expense of the Elamite forces in particular. 44. E.g., Lanfranchi (2003: 99) notes that the annexation of Zagros territory was an absolute political necessity born of the “need to maintain military superiority by securing military aid and supply of horses from new allies and, thereby, subtracting this aid from the enemy.” The role played by the horse in both the collapse of the Assyrian empire and the emergence of powerful polities in the Zagros and Fars has been generally underestimated by students of ancient history. In assessing the “Iranian” contribution to the culture of Achaemenid Persia, Moorey suggested that equestrianism, “a repertory of distinctive personal equipment. . . , with no pedigree in the regions of the Near East west of the Zagros and no known antecedent in Iran before Iron II (1000– 800 b.c.),” was one of the quintessential characteristics of Persian culture (Moorey 1985: 22). For introductions to this topic see, e.g., Hayes 1904; Anderson 1961; Herzfeld 1968; Littauer 1979; Kust 1983; Azzaroli 1985; Moorey 1985; Hyland 2003; Drews 2004; Gabrielli 2006. 45. This cultural koine may be identiﬁed in other aspects of the archaeological record. E.g., Assyrian visual and textual sources, Urartian belts, and the Arjan bowl give evidence for the existence of a common fortiﬁed\n\nspread is 12 points long\n\n00-Elam_Persia.book Page 15 Friday, December 10, 2010 4:54 PM\n\nIntroduction\n\n15\n\nTo the south of Mannea lay Luristan, a region perhaps best known today through a distinctive class of bronze artifacts, especially horse paraphernalia, that goes under the generic rubric “Luristan bronzes.” Notwithstanding the more than 350 publications on the subject of Luristan bronzes, the Iron Age cultures of Luristan remain, for the most part, an enigma (e.g., Muscarella 1988: 33; Overlaet 2003: 10). At the same time, the large mass of excavated and unexcavated bronzes that has emerged from Luristan suggests a territory of extensive wealth with access to specialized labor and metal. As Pigott (1999: 91–92) remarks, “these bronzes appear to be the culmination of a long-lived tradition of bronze casting and sheet metal working ranging from the third millennium down to the seventh century b.c.” Despite now well-known problems and uncertainties related to the provenance and authenticity of many objects attributed to the Zagros cultures, Javier Álvarez-Mon in his study of the Arjan ring suggests that that there are distinctive artistic parallels between artifacts from the Zagros regions and materials from the Arjan tomb. He argues that these correspondences are reﬂective of the entrenched engagement of Elam in the Zagros mountains and of the increasing wealth and independence in the highlands after the collapse of the Assyrian empire.\n\nAcropole Texts Two sets of tablets excavated at Susa together constitute the most signiﬁcant corpus of textual evidence for Neo-Elamite cultural and economic history. The larger of the two, the Acropole texts, consists of some 299 tablets (MDP 9, tablets 1–298 and MDP 11, tablet 309). The smaller of the two, the Apadana texts, consists of seven tablets found by R. de Mecquenem in 1909 on the Apadana mound (MDP 11, Petits Textes: tablets 301–7). The Acropole tablets are administrative documents that may derive from an archive closely associated with the management of a royal center at Susa. The texts are still poorly understood. 46 Most tablets seem to have originated at Susa, but some arrived from other cities; of the latter, two tablets still had their original envelope and address (MDP 9, 2 and 293; Scheil 1907: I). The Acropole texts record the supply of commodities, primarily textiles, but also weapons, tools, iron, copper, leather, precious metals, and other sorts of merchandise (Stolper 1992: 267). The “overseer” of the system appears to have been one Kuddakaka. The Apadana tablets are legal documents, “contracts drawn up between private individuals” (Stolper 1992: 267). The two sets of texts are, thus, quite distinct from each other. The dating of both sets of tablets is a long-standing point of contention. The archaeological contexts of the tablets are poorly understood, as with so much of the material excavated at Susa in the early 20th century, owing to the lack of proper methods of excavation and recording. In particular, it has proved difﬁcult to establish close relationships between the Acropole tablets and datable features on the Acropole mound. 47 Date formulae (month, but no day or regnal year) in some of the texts themselves are of little use. As a result, the dating of the tablets has\n\nstructure throughout much of the Zagros highlands (Gunter 1982; Kleiss 2003; Lanfranchi 2003: 113; Stronach 2004b: 718). Architecturally, these types of structures are documented in the Zagros by the “fortiﬁed manors” from Baba Jan (Goff 1968: 112) and the Nush-i Jan fortiﬁed complex (Stronach and Roaf 2007), and in Susiana by the 7th–6th century b.c. fortiﬁed site of KS-369 (Miroschedji 1990: 59). 46. Jusifov’s (1963) study remains the only published transliteration and translation of the texts since Scheil (1907).\n\n00-Elam_Persia.book Page 16 Friday, December 10, 2010 4:54 PM\n\n16\n\nÁlvarez-Mon, Garrison, and Stronach\n\nhad to rely on three bodies of evidence: internal analysis of the structure of the Elamite language in the texts; stylistic analysis of the seals applied to the tablets; and the contents of the texts. There has been a noticeable trend in recent scholarship to move the date of the documents well down into the 6th century b.c. 48 Stolper (1992: 268), now followed by many, noted that the repeated occurrence of Kuddakaka in the Acropole texts indicates that the duration of the “archive” as preserved was relatively short. Lack of information on the archaeological contexts of the tablets, the fragmentary nature of many of the texts, our poor understanding of the contents of the texts, and, ﬁnally, the lack of a precise date for them have conspired to obscure the historical signiﬁcance of both the texts and the seals. One perspective, as articulated in the contributions by Henkelman and ÁlvarezMon in this volume, sees the Acropole texts as evidence for a re-invigorated imperial center at Susa, with wide-spread hegemony in western Elam. Despite their many uncertainties, the Acropole and Apadana texts are potentially rich sources of information on the late Neo-Elamite period. As tablets that carry Neo-Elamite texts in cuneiform and the impressions of seals, the two sets of tablets from Susa provide the closest temporal comparanda for the much larger and better understood archives from Persepolis: the Fortiﬁcation archive and the Treasury archive. In his contribution in this volume, Gian Pietro Basello takes full advantage of the exceptional linguistic data provided by the Acropole texts to examine and compare administrative formulaic practices used by the scribal administration of western Elam during the time of the Acropole tablets with those used by the Persepolis bureaucracies. According to Basello, despite the existence of obvious parallels such as the late form of the Elamite language, there are few formal correspondences in the administrative formulae and terminology employed at Susa and Persepolis. About six hundred individuals are named in the Acropole texts; approximately 89% of them bear Elamite names, the remainder Iranian. Many Iranian loanwords also are documented in the Acropole texts. The presence of individuals and groups with Iranian names and Iranian loanwords side by side with individuals bearing Elamite names dramatically documents ElamiteIranian acculturation in the western regions of Elam. In his groundbreaking study in this volume, Jan Tavernier presents the ﬁrst comprehensive analysis of all Iranian proper names and loanwords attested in Neo-Elamite texts from Susa. This study of Iranian names adds to our knowledge of both Elamite and Old Iranian linguistics and opens the door for further investigation regarding the social and economic status of the various groups represented in the texts.\n\n47. According to V. Scheil, the Acropole tablets were found at a depth of ﬁve meters, in the angle formed by two walls of a construction leaning against the Achaemenid wall, under “le dallage I ﬂanquant le mur, dit achéménide, de la ﬁgure 66 du VIIIe volume des présents Mémoires” (Scheil 1907: I). At this particular point, J. de Morgan reports that the Achaemenid level stops three meters below the surface, covering the remains of the Neo-Elamite temple and the rooms where the tablets were found (Morgan 1905b: 36). Some of the bricks found near the Neo-Elamite temple bear dedications to Insusinak by Sutruk-Nahhunte II (ca. 716–699 b.c.) and his brother Hallutas-Insusinak (ca. 698–693 b.c.). Since other bricks were found to be inscribed by the Middle-Elamite king Huteludus-Insusinak (ca. 1120 b.c.), it is possible that the original temple may be of Middle Elamite date (Steve 1987: text 25 n. 154; Jéquier 1900: 128; Heim 1992: 126). When the temple went out of use remains, however, unclear. 48. E.g., Vallat (1998: 311), ca. 600–575 b.c.; Tavernier (2004: 32), ca. 590/580–565/555 b.c., with references to previous scholarship.\n\n00-Elam_Persia.book Page 17 Friday, December 10, 2010 4:54 PM\n\nIntroduction\n\n17\n\nNeo-Elamite Glyptic Since Amiet’s (1973) pioneering study on “la glyptique de la ﬁn de l’Élam,” the glyptic corpus that he assembled has ﬁgured prominently in myriad discussions concerning the late NeoElamite period. 49 Indeed, this glyptic corpus remains today the primary evidence for visual imagery and style in Elam after the Assyrian destruction. While newly-discovered seals have been attributed periodically to this corpus, the bulk of it remains basically as deﬁned by Amiet in 1973. At the heart of Amiet’s corpus are the 16 seals preserved as impressions on the Acropole tablets and the seven seals preserved as impressions on the Apadana tablets. Amiet also included ﬁve seals from the Fortiﬁcation archive at Persepolis (including PFS 93*) and 38 actual cylinder seals, 15 of which had been excavated at Susa, one at Ur. The other 23 seals were unprovenanced. On the exact dating of any one seal within the “la glyptique de la ﬁn de l’Élam” there is no agreement. Thus, attempts to articulate an internal stylistic/iconographic development within the corpus have proved elusive. 50 The question of chronology is obviously intimately tied to the proposed dating of the Acropole and Apadana tablets, which, as mentioned, is uncertain. 51 Garrison’s (2006) recent analysis has suggested a date as late as ca. 560–520s for the glyptic preserved on the tablets from Susa, a date that would represent the lower extreme in the debate. Besides providing comparanda for a wide variety of issues stylistic and iconographic, late Neo-Elamite glyptic has been called upon to support wide-ranging reconstructions of the nature of Susa (and Elam) after the sack of Susa in 647 b.c. Amiet (1973: 24) saw the glyptic as the best evidence for an Elamite renaissance at Susa in the period after 625 b.c. 52 In this he has been followed by many commentators (see the contributions by Álvarez-Mon and Henkelman in this volume). Garrison (2006), based on the evidence from the seals preserved on the Persepolis Fortiﬁcation tablets, has recently suggested shifting the origins of this glyptic from Susa to the highlands, and in his contribution in this volume he argues for the complete removal of PFS 93* from the traditional corpus of “la glyptique de la ﬁn de l’Élam.” The historical ramiﬁcations are signiﬁcant and are intimately connected to the Ansan question (see above, p. 13).\n\nLate Neo-Elamite Rock-Cut Reliefs The Elamite rock-cut reliefs and open-air sanctuaries at Izeh/Malamir are located in an exceptional natural setting. In contrast to the arid steppe of the lowland, the Izeh valley is situated in the Zagros highlands, enjoying high rainfall and producing excellent grazing areas. In the vicinity of Izeh, oak trees cover the mountain slopes, and, no doubt, oak forests were at least as extensive in the mid-1st millennium b.c. (Wright 1987: 144). Even today, seasonal streams and permanent springs wash down from surrounding cliffs and snow-capped mountains toward the seasonal lakes occupying the central part of the valley.\n\n49. This glyptic and the historiography surrounding it have recently been reviewed in Garrison 2006. 50. Garrison (2006) reviews the questions of dating of this material. Amiet (1973) originally posited that the seals preserved on the Acropole tablets predated the seals on the Apadana tablets. 51. See the comments above, pp. 15–16. Indeed, both sets of tablets from Susa have often been dated on the basis of the dates assigned to the seals. 52. See above n. 15.\n\n00-Elam_Persia.book Page 18 Friday, December 10, 2010 4:54 PM\n\n18\n\nÁlvarez-Mon, Garrison, and Stronach\n\nCarved in four different locations throughout the Izeh valley are a total of 12 Elamite rockcut reliefs: four in Sekaft-e Salman, six in Kul-e Farah, one in Sah-Savar, and one in Xong-e Azdar (Vanden Berghe 1963).
