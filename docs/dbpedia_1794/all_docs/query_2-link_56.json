        "text": "Material evidence for Parthian bridges is lacking, though an arched bridge of stone and brick across the Tigris at Parthian Ctesiphon is mentioned by medieval authors, whereas the Sasanian bridges connecting Ctesiphon and Beh-Ardašīr are said to have been wooden constructions, probably on stone piers, or boat bridges (Streck, 1900, p. 269; idem, 1917, p. 37; Fiey, p. 11; cf. Markwart, Provincial Capitals, p. 72, mentioning a bridge of about twenty boats across the Masroqān channel in Ḵūzestān). Extensive imperial, as well as private, programs of constructing bridges, dams, and canals are attested for the Sasanian period. Already Ardašīr I (a.d. 224-41) was renowned for his irrigation and drainage projects (Nöldeke, p. 47). Bahrām V Gōr (420-38) is reported to have used the building material from churches destroyed during his persecution of Christians in the construction of aqueducts and bridges over canals (Hoffmann, p. 40) and Ḵosrow I (531-79) to have repaired every bridge of wood or stone that had been damaged during the Mazdakite revolution (Nöl­deke, Geschichte der Perser, p. 164). After the emperor Valerian’s army was defeated and captured by Šāpūr I in 260, Roman prisoners of war were employed for construction work in Ḵūzestān and had an influence on Iranian civil-engineering techniques that was unparal­leled in any other branch of architecture (Nöldeke, Geschichte der Perser, p. 32; Masʿūdī, Morūj I, p. 227; Šāh-nāma, ed. Mohl, V, p. 393; Ṯaʿālebī, Ḡorar, pp. 494, 527; Nozhat al-qolūb, ed. Le Strange, p. 107).\n\nThe bridge of Roman type at Fīrūzābād (Ardašīr Ḵorra), which was long thought to date from as early as the time of Ardašīr I, has turned out to belong to the first half of the 5th century. A corrected reading of its foundation inscription shows that it was built at the order of Mihr-Narseh, wuzurg-framadār (grand vizier) of Yazdegerd I (399-420), Bahrām Gōr (420-38), and Yazdegerd II (438-57). The text suggests that endowment of a bridge was regarded as an act of religious and social merit (Forṣat-al-Dawla Šīrāzī, p. 121, fig. 14; Ghirshman, 1947, p. 5; Henning, pp. 98f.; Bier, 1986, p. 263). Mihr-Narseh’s bridge crossed the Tang(-e) Āb on the main access road to Ardašīr-Ḵorra, below the fortress of Qaḷʿa-ye Doḵtar and immediately beside the rock relief of Ardašīr’s investiture (Plate xxii). One pier is preserved, partly tipped over, in the river. Its pentagonal plan consists of an approximate square 6.35 by 6.50 m and a triangular cutwater pointing upstream, for a total length of ca. 9.70 m. The material is rubble concrete of stones and lime mortar faced with cut blocks well embedded in the core and held together by leaded iron clamps. About 18 m away, on the sandy bank below Qaḷʿa­y-e Doḵtar, traces of a causeway and bridge abut­ment are visible; on the opposite bank, 15 m away, a shapeless mass of concrete is attached to the precipice wall by means of iron clamps bedded in the living rock. There is no trace of intermediate piers. Arches of stone and brick may therefore be assumed. As the bridge is built perpendicular to the side of the gorge, the road must have made a 90-degree turn and descended on an artificial ramp, passing directly below the investiture relief of Ardašīr. Mihr-Narseh must have chosen this site for his bridge, with its accompanying inscription, deliberately in order to rival this relief, for there are more convenient points at which to cross the river. Two piers and a weir construction, known as Pol-e Bandar, are preserved some kilometers downstream. The dimen­sions of the piers are nearly identical with those of Mihr-­Narseh’s bridge; the masonry, however, is much inferior and not joined by clamps. A Sasanian date is possible, though not certain (Huff, p. 155). A third bridge of definitely Sasanian date that crosses the river immediately before the northwestern gate of the round city of Ardašīr-Ḵorra, had been badly damaged by floods already in ancient times (Plate xxiii). It was overbuilt by another bridge with hexagonal piers in later Sasanian or, more probably, Islamic times reusing ancient material. At Bīšāpūr the southeast-northwest axis of the city was extended across the Šāpūr river outside the city gate by a bridge supposedly on two arches. Only the mutilated cores of its abutments still stand on the riverbanks; they are made of stone rubble and lime mortar. This bridge obviously belongs to the original plan of the city and can thus be dated to the reign of Šāpūr I (241-72; Ghirshman, 1971, p. 30)."
