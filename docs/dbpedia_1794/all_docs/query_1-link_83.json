After my PhD research, I was fortunate to be able to spend most of the following years in Iran with the generous support of a VOCATIO grant (2015-2017). It was a unique experience which gave me the opportunity to get deeply acquainted with the landscape and the environment of Khuzestan, Lurestan and Fars, the core regions of my PhD research. It gave me new insights but at the same time, however, it meant postponing the publication of my PhD dissertation. Nevertheless, the original dissertation was shared between a select group of friends and scholars and while some of its theories and ideas thus circulated and appeared in scientific literature, correct referencing and full scholarly debate remained impossible. For this reason, making the full study available in its original form to the whole of the scientific community was something that needed to be addressed with some urgency. In view of this, we opted to publish the present PhD dissertation, although my stay in Iran resulted in some new perceptions and research ideas. I hope this contribution will stimulate research on the history of Elam, I am certain it will at least spark new discussions. This work owes much to many friends, family and colleagues. I am most grateful to all my colleagues of the National Museum of Iran, especially the director Dr. Nokandeh and the curator of the Tablet collection Ms. Piran, for allowing me to work on a weekly basis in the museum and giving me a better insight world of museology. I also deeply acknowledge the efforts of the diplomatic staff of the Belgian Embassy to the Islamic Republic of Iran, especially Ms. Karin Reynders, for watching over me, and for giving me a Belgian home far away from home. When I wrote the original acknowledgments of this dissertation, I thanked my supervisor Prof. Jan Tavernier for the excellent scientific guidance and wished that our collaboration would continue for many more years. Since we share an office for more than ten years now, I can safely say that I would not mind another ten years of vivid discussions on Elamite onomastics. Throughout the early stages of my academic career, I was able to count on the help of international and Belgian colleagues, who all contributed in their own particular way in the training of the scholar that I am today. Especially, Gian Pietro Basello (L’Orientale, Naples) and Michael Kozuh (Auburn University) for being part of my dissertation committee and giving me numerous suggestions. Javier Álvarez-Mon (Macquarie University), Yasmina Wicks (Macquarie University) and Wouter Henkelman (EPHE) for the inspiring dialogues. Theo Krispijn (Leiden University) for teaching me Elamite language at Leiden in my masters (2008). Special thanks goes to Cameron Petrie (University of Cambridge) who kindly provided me with a map that highlights all the areas discussed in the book. I am deeply indebted to Anne Goddeeris (UGent) and Karel Van Lerberghe (KU Leuven), who introduced me to numerous Assyriologists at Rencontres Assyriologiques Internationales; to Katrien De Graef (UGent), Daniel T. Potts (ISAW), Caroline Waerzeggers (Leiden University), and Kathleen Abraham (KU Leuven), who provided a platform to present my research on different occasions; to Bruno Overlaet (RMAH) for entrusting Iranica Antiqua to me and teaching me some valuable editing skills. When I started my PhD scholarship at the UCLouvain, I was most fortunate to arrive in the inspiring work environment of the Institut orientaliste, where my fellow researchers and professors welcomed me with a warm and open-minded spirit. My colleagues taught me that, even though means are scarce, collaboration and a profound respect for each other’s research can make an institute like ours work and survive. To my friends, my parents, and all my family members for their unconditional love and support. Elynn Gorris\n\nINTRODUCING THE LAST CHAPTER OF ELAMITE HISTORY\n\n1. THE LAST CHAPTER OF ELAMITE HISTORY The Ancient Near East is traditionally divided in four regions: the Levant, Anatolia, Mesopotamia and Elam (Iran). Most specialists in the field of Ancient Near Eastern History have devoted their attention to Mesopotamia, Anatolia and the Levant and their mutual relations. Elam, the eastern neighbour of Mesopotamia, however, has attracted less scholarly attention, partly because the textual source material is not that abundant and partly because the Elamite language, compared to other Ancient Near Eastern languages such as Akkadian, Aramaic, Hittite and Hebrew, is not yet fully understood. Within the study of ancient Iran, it is the Achaemenid empire that has received most interest in modern research. This is, however, to be expected, since the Achaemenid empire is much better known thanks to its abundant source material and to its contacts with the Greek world. The name ‘Elam’ was not used frequently in studies on Ancient Near Eastern history until quite recently. This is clearly illustrated by the fact that George Cameron, when publishing his Elamite history in 1936, gave it the title ‘History of Early Iran’. Nonetheless, Elam has received a growing attention during the latest decades. But then again, scholars are mostly interested in the Middle Elamite period (c. 1500-1100 BC) and the Achaemenid period (c. 550-330 BC). The period in between, called the Neo-Elamite period, was hardly ever studied in depth, leaving a gap in modern scholarship. It is precisely that gap that this monography wants to bridge. In concentrating on the history of the NeoElamite period (c. 1100-520 BC), this book aims at a better understanding of the historical developments in this lesser known transition period between the Middle Elamite kingdom and the Achaemenid empire. In order to achieve this goal, it will make use of all available source material: philological, archaeological and iconographic, deriving from both Elam itself and Mesopotamia. Nevertheless, this study does not pretend to re-establish a political history of the Neo-Elamite period, since far too little source material is available or correctly understood to conduct a comprehensive study. This study does intend to add significant pieces to the historical puzzle, so that we can work in the forthcoming years towards a comprehensive history of the Neo-Elamite kingdom.\n\n2. HISTORY OF RESEARCH Since the source material is scarce, Neo-Elamite history has been one the most unexploited topics of the Ancient Near Eastern studies. In the 19th century, attention was especially consecrated to the Achaemenid period, with the study of the Elamite version of the Bisitun Inscription as main research activity. With the start of the Susa excavations in 1898, Elamite studies were firmly stimulated. One of the early pioneers in Elamite studies was Father Vincent Scheil, who was the first epigraphist of the French archaeological mission at Susa and who published in the well-known series Mémoires de la Délégation en Perse (MDP) a great number of Elamite inscriptions deriving from the Susa excavations and the Susiana region. Friedrich W. König provided a text edition on the Elamite royal inscriptions (1965 = EKI), while Françoise Malbran-Labat (1995 = IRS) assembled the Elamite brick inscriptions. Marie-Joseph Steve (1992) published the only general sign list for Elamite studies. Walther Hinz & Heidemarie Koch (1987 = ElW) composed the only complete Elamite dictionary. The first synoptic monograph dealing with Elamite history was published by George Cameron in 1936. Later monographies on Elamite history were published by Walther Hinz (1964) and Elisabeth Carter & Matthew W. Stolper (1984). Daniel T. Potts (1999) published the latest historical overview of Elam’s history based on archaeological, textual and iconographical sources. Over the past few decades, our understanding of the Neo-Elamite period has drastically changed. Matthew W. Waters (2000) studied the Neo-Elamite history primarily from Mesopotamian documents, including the Neo-Babylonian chronicles, the Assyrian omen reports, the Neo-Assyrian royal inscriptions and the NeoAssyrian correspondence. Pierre de Miroschedji, François Vallat and Jan Tavernier have examined the Elamite language and its history in various publications. Most recently, Javier Álvarez-Mon & Mark B. Garrison\n\n4\n\nINTRODUCING THE LAST CHAPTER OF ELAMITE HISTORY\n\n(2011) have published a collection of articles on the final decades of the Elamite kingdom and the rise of Persia. The proceedings of the international conference on Elam and Susa held in 2009 (De Graef & Tavernier 2013) give the latest update on Elamite research in general. As could be expected, most Assyriologists studying Neo-Elamite history concentrate on the best-documented Neo-Elamite II phase (c. 760-646 BC). Nevertheless, new research on the Neo-Elamite I and III periods has already been conducted in the form of studies on particular aspects. François Vallat (1996a) and Jan Tavernier (2004) have made a reconstruction of the Neo-Elamite III chronology based on analysis of the Elamite language. Pierre de Miroschedji (1985, 1990a), Marie-Joseph Steve (1986) and Walther Hinz (1987) reported on the transition and the acculturation of the Neo-Elamite inhabitants into the Persian empire as well as Wouter Henkelman (2003b) who has investigated the influence, if there was any, of the Medes and the Persians on the Neo-Elamite kingdom during its last decades. Despite these recent insights on Neo-Elamite history of the last decades, much work remains to be done, because since the last reconstruction of Neo-Elamite history by Daniel T. Potts (1999, 259-294) many years have passed and new studies, for instance on the archaeological material of the Mamasani plain (Potts et al. 2009) or on the Arjan tomb (Álvarez-Mon 2010a) have modified our view on the period in question.\n\n3. HISTORICAL FRAMEWORK The earliest history of the (pre-) Elamite civilization dates back to prehistoric times. The archaeological evidence from Susa and Anšan, the later core sites of the Elamite kingdom, shows a permanent settlement since the late 5th millennium BC. In these regions, a ‘proto-Elamite’ culture was established. In Susa, the proto-Elamites constructed a fortified village on the Acropole hill (Susa I period). In the Kur River Basin (Anšan, Tall-e Bakun), archaeologists found more than a hundred small settlements from the late Bakun (45003900 BC) and Lapui (3900-3400 BC) phases. In the Susa II period (3800-3100 BC), the first indigenous script, the yet undeciphered Proto-Elamite writing system, was created. By the Banesh phase (3100-2900 BC), the Proto-Elamite script reached the highland region. The first historical reference to the kingdom of Elam appears in an Archaic Uruk text from 3000 BC (Potts 1999, 85). During the mid-3rd millennium BC, a second reference to Elam is made in the Sumerian King List from the city-state Kiš, where king Enmebaragesi (2700 BC) describes his attack on Elam. The Sumerians referred to Elam with the cuneiform sign(s) reading NIM or NIM.KI (literally: ‘high(land)’). The period following the attack on Elam is called ‘the Old Elamite period’. In the Old Elamite period (2700-1600 BC) three successive Elamite dynasties — Awan (2700-2100 BC), Šimaški (2100-2000 BC), and sukkalmahs (2000-1600 BC) — had a troublesome relationship with Mesopotamia. The Awan dynasty ruled partly contemporary with the Mesopotamian Agade dynasty, who dominated Elam for about a century. Sargon of Akkad was the first Mesopotamian king to conquer thirteen Elamite cities in c. 2330 BC, a campaign that was repeated by his son and successor Rimuš of Akkad. Sargon’s other son Manistušu annexed Anšan and installed Mesopotamian governors in Elam. These governors probably introduced the Akkadian language and accountancy system in Susa. In this period, the oldest Elamite text, the so-called treaty of Naram-Sin, is written. After the fall of the Agade dynasty, the last Awanite king Puzur-Inšušinak (c. 2100 BC) recaptured the Elamite cities and seems to have introduced a new writing system known as ‘Linear Elamite’. Eventually Puzur-Inšušinak was defeated by Ur-Nammu, founder of the Ur III dynasty. Under the Šimaški dynasty, the Elamite cities had to pay taxes to the central Ur III government. The Ur III kings strengthened the relationship with Elam by marrying off the royal daughters to the local Elamite elite. However, the repeated looting of the Elamite lands by the Ur III kings evoked dissatisfaction amongst the Elamite elite, whereupon the Šimaški king Kindattu (2004 BC) defeated and ended the powerful Ur III empire. Under the sukkalmah dynasty, particularly those of the late 19th and early 18th centuries BC, and specifically during the reign of Siwepalarhupak the prestige and the influence of the Elamite kingdom throughout Western Asia reached an unprecedented extent. The sukkalmahs gradually seized power in the more northern Šimaški valleys, controlling the highlands as well as the lowlands, and even ruled some Mesopotamian\n\nHISTORICAL FRAMEWORK\n\n5\n\ncity-states. They maintained trading contacts with Mesopotamia, Syria, Dilmun, Magan, and even Bactria in the east. Eventually the Babylonian king Hammurabi (c. 1764 BC) put an end to this Elamite geopolitical expansion in about 1762 BC. During the Middle Elamite period (c. 1500-1100 BC), Elam reached its prime of power. For the first time since the days of the sukkalmah ruler Siwepalarhupak the Elamites pursued an assertive foreign policy and became serious rivals to the Mesopotamian kingdoms, economically as well as geopolitically. The kings of three succeeding dynasties of the Middle Elamite period — the Kidinuid (c. 1500-1400 BC), the Igihalkid (c. 1400-1200 BC) and the Šutrukid kings (c. 1200-1100 BC) — all carried the royal title ‘king of Anzan and Susa’, referring to their power over the united lowland and highland kingdom with their two main centers, Susa and Anšan. The Kidinuids were the immediate successors to the sukkalmahs and it seems that the transition did not have a violent character. Unfortunately, the history of the Kidinuid period is still poorly understood. Out of the five known Kidinuid kings, only the latter two (Tepti-ahar and Inšušinak-šar-ilani) have left their own inscriptions in Akkadian. The Igihalkid kings were engaged in large building projects: Tepti-ahar founded the (political) center of Haft Tepe in the Susiana plain. The Elamite king Untaš-Napiriša erected a new sanctuary at the site of Chogha Zanbil with a large ziggurat, where the deities of the highlands were worshipped along with those of the lowlands. The Igihalkid kings campaigned in Mesopotamia and tried to extend their geopolitical influence by matrimonial alliances with the Babylonian Kassite dynasty and defended their Kassite allies against a growing Assyrian involvement in Babylonian politics. Especially under the Šutrukid dynasty, Elam played a crucial role on the international political scene. The ‘kings of Anzan and Susa’ dominated the Elamite highlands & lowlands as well as significant parts of southern Mesopotamia and the northern Zagros. King Šutruk-Nahhunte I (c. 1190-1155 BC) made Elam one of the most powerful kingdoms in the Ancient Near East by defeating the Babylonian kingdom in 1158 BC. His son, Kutir-Nahhunte, dethroned the last Kassite king of Babylonia and heavily insulted his Mesopotamian neighbour by removing the cult statue of the god Marduk from its sanctuary (esagil) in the city of Babylon. His successor Šilhak-Inšušinak I (c. 1155-1125 BC) took advantage of the power vacuum, created by the collapse of the Kassite dynasty, and campaigned in eastern and northeastern Mesopotamia. At that time Elam was at the height of its power. The period of prosperity ended abruptly when the Babylonian king Nebuchadnezzar I (1125-1104 BC) sought revenge for the humiliations the Babylonians had suffered and wanted to bring back the divine statue of Marduk. In this he succeeded and his military actions compelled the successor of Šilhak-Inšušinak I, Hutelutuš-Inšušinak, to retire to the highlands, more precisely to Anšan. It should be noted, however, that Nebuchadnezzar’s campaign did not annihilate the Elamite kingdom and Nebuchadnezzar’s adversary Hutelutuš-Inšušinak could rule for some time after the Babylonian campaign. Scholars of Elamite history have assumed for a long time that after the Babylonian raid on Susa, the Middle Elamite dynasty did not recover and that it slowly disappeared from Ancient Near Eastern history. Cameron (1936, 130), who stated that ‘history affords frequent examples of empires which reach their prime only to pass into immediate decline, and Elam was no exception’, was right in arguing that Elam in the 1st millennium BC would never have regained the extent and political influence of the Šutrukid heydays. The large Middle Elamite kingdom came to an end the way the Neo-Elamite kingdom began, with an almost complete absence of historical data. Whether the lack of historical data implies an ‘immediate decline’ is another question that will be addressed in the first chapter of part I: ‘The Dark Ages (1100-760 BC)’. The Neo-Elamite period (c. 1100-520 BC) is often called one of the darkest chapters of Elamite history, because this period of approximately 500 years is historically situated between two of the best known empires of early Iranian history, ruled by the Šutrukid and the Achaemenid dynasties. Our knowledge of Neo-Elamite political history begins with the accession to the throne of Huban-nikaš I (743-717 BC). The main threat to the Elamite kingdom, an occasional ally of the Babylonian king, came from the Neo-Assyrian empire. The hostile contacts between the two kingdoms (743-646 BC) culminated in military campaigns of the Assyrian king Assurbanipal against the Elamite kingdom followed by the destruction of Susa in 646 BC. After the sack of Susa, the political history of the late Neo-Elamite kingdom (646-520 BC) is hardly known. Perhaps the Elamite\n\n6\n\nINTRODUCING THE LAST CHAPTER OF ELAMITE HISTORY\n\ncities were rebuilt after the destruction of Susa on a smaller scale with limited political power. Maybe that is why Elam did not participate in the alliance of Babylonians and Medes, which defeated the Neo-Assyrian empire (612 BC). Ironically, not only the beginning of the Neo-Elamite period is difficult to define. Also its end is a debatable subject. We grope in the dark about the last century of Elamite independence. Most probably the Neo-Elamite kingdom lost its independent position to the rising Achaemenid dynasty (cf. I.5.7.), when Darius (I) the Great annexed its territory by the end of the 6th century BC (520 BC).\n\n4. SOURCES FOR THE STUDY OF THE NEO-ELAMITE PERIOD 4.1. Textual sources Textual sources on Neo-Elamite history can be divided in two main groups: Mesopotamian sources and Elamite sources. Both groups contain valuable information, albeit of a very different nature, on the history of the Neo-Elamite kingdom. At present, the interpretation of the royal inscriptions from the Neo-Assyrian empire and the Neo-Babylonian kingdom remain critical for most historical reconstructions of the Neo-Elamite period. Next to these two principal groups, some Biblical references (Dan. 8:2; Jeremiah 49:34-39) give limited information on Neo-Elamite history.\n\n4.1.1. Mesopotamian sources The Mesopotamian chronicles mainly provide a chronological sequence of Neo-Elamite kings, historical connections between Babylonia and Elam, information on royal genealogy, military and political activities. The Babylonian Chronicle (ABC 1), the main source for the Neo-Elamite dynastic chronology, describes the reign from Huban-nikaš I (743-717 BC) to the accession of Urtak (675-664 BC). The Babylonian Chronicle contains occasional details on the royal bloodlines, such as Šutruk-Nahhunte II being the mār ahātišu of Huban-nikaš I or the brotherhood between Kutur-Nahhunte and Huban-menanu. The Esarhaddon Chronicle (ABC 14; CM 18) describes a much shorter period of Neo-Elamite royal genealogy and adds some additional information on the reigns of Huban-haltaš II and Urtak. The Šamaš-šum-ukin Chronicle (ABC 15; CM 19) only reflects on king Huban-nikaš II. The Chronicle of the Neo-Babylonian king Nabonidus (556-539 BC; ABC 7; CM 26) gives some valuable information on the rise of the Persian empire under the Teispid king Cyrus the Great. The Assyrian royal inscriptions from the reign of Sargon II (721-705 BC) to Assurbanipal (668-627 BC), dating from the late 8th to the first half of the 7th centuries BC, are the most informative account of the NeoElamite/Neo-Assyrian interactions. The Assyrian Annals give a detailed account on the events during the 650s, starting with the final regnal years of Urtak until the defeat of Huban-haltaš III. In the Annals of his fifth campaign (c. 646), the Assyrian king Assurbanipal gives a detailed description of the destruction of Susa (BIWA). Also the Assyrian correspondence (ABL; SAA), which consists of letters of Assyrian officials to their king reporting on the Elamite political and military events, plays a significant role in the reconstruction of Elamite foreign policy and territorial disputes with neighbouring states. Especially the correspondence of Bel-ibni, governor of Sealand, gives an insight on the tumultuous years of the Elamite rebel kings (de Vaan 1995). The Mesopotamian sources on Neo-Elamite history have to be studied with caution. Especially the NeoAssyrian Annals are propagandistic literature that colours the modern perspective on the Neo-Elamite kingdom through a bias of hostility. The best example of the modified truth can be studied from the battles of Der and Halule (Waters 2000, 13-14, 34-36), where the three involved parties, the Elamite, Babylonian and Assyrian army, each claim victory in their reports on the battles. Moreover, the Assyrian records describe brief contacts with the Elamite civilization and are not able to contribute to the reconstruction of the religious, economic and social history of Elam.\n\nSOURCES FOR THE STUDY OF THE NEO-ELAMITE PERIOD\n\n7\n\n4.1.2. Elamite sources The Neo-Elamite corpus can largely be divided in four categories: 1) The royal monumental inscriptions were meant to display the grandeur of the monarchy. Since the aim of these inscriptions was ‘to be seen’, the texts were inscribed on building materials (bricks, wall knobs & pegs), statues and steles. The oldest Neo-Elamite royal inscriptions (EKI 71-73; IRS 57) date from the reign of a single king Šutruk-Nahhunte II (717-699 BC). Thereafter, there is a gap of almost a century before new Elamite royal texts appear. Late Neo-Elamite kings who have left their signature on building materials are Tepti-Huban-Inšušinak II (EKI 79-84; IRS 59-62), Šilhak-Inšušinak II (EKI 78) and HallutušInšušinak II (EKI 77; IRS 58; MDP 53). Several other kings like Tepti-Huban-Inšušinak II (EKI 85) and Atta-hamiti-Inšušinak I (EKI 86-89) have left us some statues and steles. 2) The official Elamite inscriptions can be defined as monumental texts that are not written in the name of an Elamite king. Although these texts have an official state character, their content is much more informative than the propagandist royal inscriptions. The stele of Šutruru (EKI 74), the inscribed rock reliefs of Kul-e Farah and Šekaft-e Salman (EKI 75-76) and the Ururu Bronze Plaque of Persepolis (Basello 2013) are all ascribed to Elamite state officials. These texts, although displayed on public places, describe land grants, religious ceremonies, and military campaigns by high-ranked officials in service of the Elamite monarchy. 3) Documentary texts in the largest sense of the word have no public purpose. This category includes the economic archive of the Susa Acropole texts (MDP 9), the corpus of legal texts (MDP 11, 301-307), the Nineveh letters (Weissbach 1902) and one omen text (Scheil 1917, 24). These corpora have a purely documentary purpose, offering a supporting role in the governmental system, whether this is on an administrative, a legal, a diplomatic or a religious level. These texts reflect the daily organization of the Elamite kingdom by the Elamite bureaucratic apparatus. 4) Captions on sealings and objects mark a last category. The names and lineages of the owners of the tableware of the Kalmakarra cave (Henkelman 2003b), the Arjan tomb (Álvarez-Mon 2010a) and the Ram Hormuz burials (Shishehgar 2008) are inscribed on these objects. The inscribed sealings on documents found at Susa (Amiet 1973) and at Persepolis (Garrison & Root 2001; Garrison 2006) provide personal information on the genealogy and ethnic background of the seal bearers and administrators. Although the indigenous Elamite sources are very diverse, they do not provide a consistent chronological report on the events that took place in the Neo-Elamite kingdom. The major problem with regard to the indigenous Elamite sources is their chronology, since there is not a single Neo-Elamite text with a regnal year. This basically means that studying the evolution of the Elamite language and script includes dealing with these restrictions as well. Most scholars have based the relative dating of the Neo-Elamite textual corpus on a linguistic and palaeographical comparative study. However, there is a substantial difference between royal and documentary writing traditions. Ideally the royal monumental inscriptions should be studied within their own category, separated from other genres of texts such as economic documents, letters and legal cases, because they developed at a different tempo. This can be demonstrated by the classification on palaeographic grounds of the Neo-Elamite inscriptions in the sign list of Steve (1992). All the royal inscriptions are catalogued in the Neo-Elamite II column, while documentary texts are listed in the Neo-Elamite III column. In royal inscriptions, script and language are often much more archaic in order to highlight the continuity of the king with his predecessors. The royal inscriptions, probably made by specially trained palace scribes, were written in calligraphy to be used as a signature of the Elamite king to the outer world and did not necessarily reflect the writing traditions of that time. Although there is a clear evolution in monumental royal Elamite texts, these inscriptions are not comparable to practical documents, such as economic text, letters or omens. This difference is already noticeable in palaeographic variations in the royal Šutruk-Nahhunte II inscriptions and the Šutruru stela (EKI 74), a charter on land grants of an Elamite official. The same principle is seen in the Achaemenid period, if one compares the monumental Bisitun inscription to the Persepolis Fortification archive. The economic texts of the Susa Acropole archive were intended to register the intake and the distribution of commodities at the royal stores of the Susa administrative district. The scribes, who had to record administrative\n\n8\n\nINTRODUCING THE LAST CHAPTER OF ELAMITE HISTORY\n\noperations, wrote them swiftly in the style and linguistic tradition that were common for that period. The royal monumental inscriptions that were written in that same period probably had a distinct orthography. An example of this principle is the sign UM that keeps its Neo-Elamite II shape in all late Neo-Elamite royal inscriptions, but undergoes a palaeographic evolution in the texts without a monumental character (Annex 1). Therefore, it seems quite unadvisable to transpose the characteristics of the royal inscriptions without restrictions on documentary texts, since these documents display more recent linguistic evolutions than the royal inscriptions that were written during the same period. Until today, scholars in Elamite studies have paid little attention to the different nature of these documents and consequently did not take these differences into account when establishing a relative chronology of the Neo-Elamite texts. This subdivision will obviously have an influence on the sequence of the Neo-Elamite kings, known from these texts, in the relative chronology of the Neo-Elamite period. For the study of Neo-Elamite chronology based on palaeography the situation becomes more complicated by the fact that one and the same person (V. Scheil) copied the majority of Elamite texts in the late 19th century. As a result of this, one cannot differentiate whether the copyist has drawn all the signs in the same way (as happened more often in that time) or whether there was no orthographic variety in the texts of a certain archive at all.\n\n4.2. Archaeological sources European excavations in southwestern Iran started more than a hundred years ago (1895), when the Persian Shah Nasr al-Din granted French archaeologists the exclusive permission to excavate throughout his kingdom. In 1897, the French government created the archaeological mission Délégation scientifique française de Perse. They had to explore western Iran (Khuzestan and Fars) and to locate the lands of ancient Elam and Persia, which were merely known from the Bible (Dan. 8:2) and the ancient Greek historians. With the arrival of this French exploration mission, the official large-scale excavations of Elam had begun. Nevertheless the Elamite kingdom, located in the current Islamic Republic of Iran, remains one of the least exploited archaeological areas. Excavation permissions for Western archaeologists became scarce after the Iranian Revolution in 1979. With the reduction of these archaeological excavations, new information on the Elamite civilization became available only on a modest scale. In the 1980s and the 1990s, these circumstances led to a wave of revising the already existing Elamite source material, which resulted in a large number of scientific articles with hypotheses on the Neo-Elamite kingdom still improvable at present. During the last decade selected companies of archaeologists, like the Iranian-Australian Mamasani team of D.T. Potts, succeeded in resuming archaeological fieldwork in Iran and to reveal little pieces of this Elamite civilization. These teams and welltrained young Iranian researchers are providing and publishing new Elamite material sources for Elamologists to continue the investigation on the Neo-Elamite kingdom. This study will only observe those archaeological sites of southern Lurestan (Overlaet 2003), Khuzestan and northern Fars that show traces of Elamite Iron Age III (800-500 BC) settlements. Most of the major Elamite alluvial plains were investigated during the last century. Extensive archaeological surveys have been undertaken in the Susiana Plain and the Kur River Basin (Anšan). The most profound research on Neo-Elamite Susa was conducted by P. de Miroschedji (1978; 1981a), who made a stratigraphy of the Iron Age III levels in Ville Royale II. The site of Anšan has been identified and excavated by W. Sumner (1974). Additional surveys have been carried out in the valleys that connected the Elamite kingdom: the Mainab plain (Moghaddam & Miri 2003), the Ram Hormuz plain (Wright & Carter 2003), the Eastern corridor (Moghaddam & Miri 2007), Behbahan & Zohreh (Stronach 2003), Izeh (Bayani 1976), and the Mamasani region (Potts et al. 2009).\n\n4.3. Iconographical sources The iconographical sources come from both Mesopotamia and Elam. The Elamite iconographic material consists of rock reliefs, objects and cylinder seals. The Elamite rock reliefs at Šekaft-e Salman, Kul-e Farah,\n\n9\n\nSTRUCTURE AND THEMES\n\nKurangun and Naqš-e Rostam reflect local Neo-Elamite traditions (Vanden Berghe 1983; Álvarez-Mon 2013b). Furthermore, the objects of the Kalmakarra cave, the Arjan tomb and the Ram Hormuz burials are examples of the artistic connection between Southern Lurestan, Khuzistan and Fars. The various seal impressions on documents found at Susa (Amiet 1973) and at Persepolis (Garrison & Root 2001) represent cultural resemblances with the neighbouring Mesopotamian kingdoms. Mesopotamian iconography on Elam is displayed on the Assyrian palace reliefs. Several Neo-Assyrian reliefs in the Southwest Palace and the North Palace of Assurbanipal at Nineveh provides us with additional iconographical material on the battle of Til-Tuba (c. 653 BC) (Barnett 1976, pl. 24-25; Barnett et al. 1998, 94-95, pl. 286-299), the installation of the Elamite client king Huban-nikaš II (Barnett 1976, 42, pl. 25), Elamite political refugees and royal captives (Barnett 1976, pl. 47, 51, 56, 63-65) and Elamite architecture (on Madaktu: see Barnett et al. 1998, 96-97, pl. 300-13; on the ziggurat: Barnett 1976, 42, pl. 25-26).\n\n5. STRUCTURE AND THEMES To improve our understanding of Neo-Elamite history, this monograph will concentrate on three themes. In the first part, the chronological framework of the Neo-Elamite kings will be revised mostly by using the Elamite and Mesopotamian textual sources. An in-depth study on the sequence of Neo-Elamite kings and their genealogy is intended to contribute to new insights into the political history of the Neo-Elamite period. In the second part, the geopolitical settings of the Neo-Elamite monarchy will be investigated. The third part will focus on the internal organisation of the Neo-Elamite kingdom. It will examine the Neo-Elamite government structure and the magnates working in this political system to carry out the decisions of the Neo-Elamite kings. In addition, this research will consider the historical developments in the three neighbouring areas: the NeoBabylonian kingdom in the west, the Medes in the northeast and the emerging Persian empire in the south. In this way, it is possible to study Neo-Elamite history in connection with other contexts, most obviously that of the political and socio-economical history of the Ancient Near East. PART 1: ON THE KINGS OF\n\nNIM.MA.KI\n\n(ELAM) AND ON\n\nTHOSE OF\n\nSUSA\n\nAND\n\nANŠAN\n\nWriting a history of a kingdom or a nation implies a certain framework in which the historian can chronologically situate persons and facts. The most important historical figures of ancient kingdoms are the kings, whom we know through ancient records reporting on their achievements. In order to reconstruct the history of the Neo-Elamite period, one needs a king and a royal family with successors to the Elamite throne to guarantee the continued existence of the kingdom. The first part will therefore examine the genealogy of the Neo-Elamite royal families and order of succession of the Neo-Elamite kings. Part 1 is divided into six chapters. The first chapter briefly discusses indications of royal presence during the Dark Ages. The second chapter explains the genealogy of the first Neo-Elamite dynasty, from Huban-tahra to Huban-menanu (c. 760-689 BC). In the third chapter, the family history of the Hubanid dynasty (688-650 BC) from Huban-haltaš I to Tammaritu is revised. The fourth chapter accounts on the rebel kings (650-645 BC) that attempted and often succeeded to seize the Elamite throne during the Hubanid family feud. The fifth chapter describes the Elamite kings that ruled after the sack of Susa until the annexation of Elam by the Achaemenids and in the sixth chapter a chronological sequence of the local kings or sheikhs is made during that same period. The history of research has proven that this is not an easy task, as various theories have already been proposed (Table 1). When reconstructing the Neo-Elamite king list, Mesopotamian sources, when brought together, provide a relatively accurate chronology from Huban-nikaš I (743 BC) to Huban-haltaš III (645 BC). However, two elements complicate the reconstruction of the Neo-Elamite king list. Firstly, the Neo-Elamite textual sources are not dated. Secondly, the names of the Elamite kings have been adapted in the Mesopotamian sources into Akkadian variants. Therefore, it is often difficult to connect the royal references in Mesopotamian sources to the Elamite inscriptions. For decades, scholars have tried to link all Elamite royal names to their\n\n650/49-648\n\nIndabibi\n\nc.529-c.522 c.522-c.486\n\nCambyses II Darius I\n\nTable 1: Relative chronology of the Neo-Elamite kings and texts\n\nc.585-c.559 c.559-c.530\n\nCyrus II\n\nc.610-c.585\n\nCyrus I Cambyses I\n\nc.635-c.610\n\nTeispes (Anšan)\n\nPersian Dynasty\n\nde Miroschedji 1985\n\nDabala, Ampiriš, Anni-Šilhak & Unšak (Samati; Kalmakarra hoard)\n\nBahuri (Zamin)\n\nc.530-520\n\nAtta-hamiti-Inšušinak (EKI 86-89)\n\nc.585-c.539\n\nc.550-c.530\n\nc.565-c.550\n\nc.590-c.555\n\nc.620-c.585\n\nc.625-c.600\n\nc.640\n\n646-645\n\n647\n\nTepti-Huban-Inšušinak (EKI 79-85)\n\nŠati-hupiti & Huban-Šuturuk (Gisat; Ururu Bronze Plaque)\n\n585-539\n\nŠilhak-Inšušinak II (EKI 78)\n\nBahuri (Zamin; Nin 1, 5, 10, 14)\n\nUmmanunu (S. 165)\n\nHallutuš-Inšušinak (EKI 77)\n\nHuban-Šuturuk (Gisat)\n\nŠutur-Nahhunte (Malamir)\n\nTepti-Huban-Inšušinak (II) (Susa)\n\nŠilhak-Inšušinak II (Susa)\n\nUmmanunu (Susa)\n\nAtta-hamiti-Inšušinak\n\nIndada & Šutur-Nahhunte (EKI 75-76, seal)\n\n646-585\n\nHallutaš-Inšušinak\n\nHuban-haltaš III Omen text\n\n647-645\n\nTammaritu\n\n648-647\n\n649-648\n\nIndabibi Huban-haltaš III\n\n652-649\n\n653-652\n\nTammaritu\n\nHuban-nikaš II + Tammaritu\n\nTavernier 2004\n\nŠutur-Nahhunte (EKI 71)\n\nHuban-haltaš III\n\nTammaritu\n\n648-647\n\n652/1-650/49\n\nTammaritu\n\nHuban-haltaš III\n\n653-652/1\n\nHuban-nikaš II + Tammaritu\n\nVallat 1996\n\n646\n\nPa’e\n\nAppalaya (Zari, S. 71)\n\nŠati-hupiti & Huban-Šuturuk (Gisat; Ururu Bronze Plaque)\n\nBahuri\n\nTabala, Ampiriš, Anni-Šilhak, Unzi-kilik, Gittiyaš & Unšak (Samati; Kalmakarra hoard) c.585-c.539\n\nc.530-520\n\nc.530\n\nHutran-tepti (EKI 86-89) Atta-hamiti-Inšušinak (EKI 86-89)\n\nc.550-c.530\n\nc.565-c.550\n\nc.585-c.565\n\nc.620-c.585\n\nTepti-Huban-Inšušinak (II) (EKI 79-85)\n\nŠilhak-Inšušinak (EKI 78)\n\nUmmanunu (Hubanini; S. 165, EKI 78)\n\nHallutuš-Inšušinak (EKI 77)\n\nHuban-tahra II (EKI 77)\n\nŠutur-Nahhunte (seal)\n\nc.630-c.610\n\n647-645\n\nHuban-haltaš III\n\nIndada (EKI 75-76)\n\n647\n\n648-647\n\nHuban-haltaš III\n\n648/7\n\n650/49-648\n\nIndabibi\n\nTammaritu\n\n652/1-650/49\n\nTammaritu\n\nHuban-habua\n\n653-652/1\n\nHuban-nikaš II + Tammaritu\n\nTavernier 2007a\n\n10 INTRODUCING THE LAST CHAPTER OF ELAMITE HISTORY\n\nSTRUCTURE AND THEMES\n\n11\n\nMesopotamian counterparts (Hinz 1964; Carter & Stolper 1984; Waters 2000). Consequently, all Neo-Elamite royal inscriptions were automatically dated to the Neo-Elamite II period, which is the era covered by Mesopotamian sources (c. 743-646/5 BC), resulting in numerous inconsistencies. Tepti-Huban-Inšušinak, for example, went on a campaign in an area for which he needed to cross several Assyrian provinces and Hallutuš-Inšušinak reigned Elam for seven years in the Babylonian Chronicle, while an economic contract from Hidalu would be dated to the 15th regnal year of Hallutuš-Inšušinak. Although the Elamite sources provide data on a number of kings for the late Neo-Elamite period, the attestations are too limited to bridge the gap of about 125 years. When Mesopotamian source material disappears after the reign of Huban-haltaš III, the scanty source material does not allow to retrace the genealogy of the late Elamite kings. Therefore, this study will merely focus on the sequence of the late Neo-Elamite kings. F. Vallat (1996a) was the first scholar to revise the Neo-Elamite sources and to assign most Neo-Elamite royal inscriptions to the Neo-Elamite III period after the sack of Susa (post-646 BC). Accepting F. Vallat’s reconstruction means recognizing a significant larger number of kings for the late Neo-Elamite period. J. Tavernier (2004) refined the work of F. Vallat by fully exploiting the system of the broken writings as an additional dating method for late Elamite inscriptions (Table 1). Nevertheless, it is highly possible that only the late Neo-Elamite kings, who were engaged in building activities and left us monumental steles, are known to us. Moreover, one can question whether the fathers, mentioned in the royal titulary, of these Neo-Elamite king held the office of king as well, which would of course double the number of late Neo-Elamite kings. Since we cannot deduce from the available source material any dynastic connection between the kings, it seems rather doubtful that all the attested patronyms would have been kings. At this point in research, however, one can only make educated guesses on which Elamite king had the honour of succeeding his father. Despite the fact that the earliest Achaemenid rulers were unmistakably the heirs of the Neo-Elamite kingdom and that the transition of a Neo-Elamite to an Achaemenid government is far from clear in the sources, the Achaemenids were no Elamites. The Achaemenids were not merely another dynasty that came into power in Elam, they were an Indo-Iranian dynasty that conquered and integrated Elam into their large empire. The earliest Achaemenid heirs of Elam are therefore not included in this part. PART 2: THE GEOPOLITICAL POWER OF THE NEO-ELAMITE MONARCHY Ancient Elam is situated in the southwest of present-day Iran and broadly includes the provinces of Khuzestan, the south of Lurestan and the north of Fars. The province of Khuzestan is geographically part of the alluvial plain of Mesopotamia. Therefore, it is often called the Elamite lowlands. The province of Fars or the Elamite highlands is located southeast to the lowlands. The two most important cities of Elam, Susa and Anšan, are located over more than 500 kilometers from each other. Susiana is the major plain in Khuzestan, while Anšan lies in the mountainous Fars area. Susiana, Fars and the valleys between those two areas are the principal setting for Neo-Elamite history. As Potts (1999, 10) already indicated, the name Elam represents a political entity rather than a geographical one. During the three millennia of the Elamite civilization, the geographical boundaries changed so often from lowland to highland that the name Elam in every historical period has a different content. In prosperous times, the two regions were mostly united. When the Elamite kingdom suffered from foreign attacks, the Elamite kings often lost their control over the highlands or, conversely, were forced to flee to the highlands and give up the lowland territories. In this part, the geopolitical setting of the Neo-Elamite kingdom will be studied. The territory over which the Elamite monarchy had a political claim and over which they exercised cultural influence will be examined. An even more important question for the Neo-Elamite period is to what extent the Elamites were capable of maintaining their territorial boundaries during the 1st millennium BC in their dealings with the emerging Neo-Assyrian, Neo-Babylonian and Achaemenid empires. This part is divided into two large chapters dealing with the Neo-Elamite lowlands and the Neo-Elamite highlands respectively. In the first chapter of the Neo-Elamite lowlands, the western & northern periphery\n\n12\n\nINTRODUCING THE LAST CHAPTER OF ELAMITE HISTORY\n\nis discussed as well as the Elamite heartland including the large Susiana plain, Ram Hormuz and Behbahan. In the second chapter on the Elamite highlands, the Elamite regions of Izeh, Mamasani and the southern periphery are studied. The analysis of the Elamite periphery or border regions throughout the Neo-Elamite period is a tentative reconstruction, combining Assyrian, Babylonian and Elamite records with archaeological evidence. Since the initial attempt of J. Brinkman (1986), no further study has been undertaken to grasp the boundaries of the NeoElamite kingdom. This part intends to bring together the existing source material on the Elamite-Mesopotamian border regions. The sources on the eastern and southern borders are rather limited, but the information on the northern and western frontier zones is abundant. At this point, any geographical reconstruction of this region is an attempt to improve our historical knowledge, rather than an accurate reconstruction of the limits of the Neo-Elamite kingdom. At present, three major obstacles prevent to make a profound investigation of the Elamite frontier regions. Firstly, the Akkadian as well as the Elamite textual sources provide us with hundreds of toponyms especially along the Elamite-Mesopotamian western border, the so-called Trans-Tigridian corridor (i.e. the area between the Tigris and Zagros foothills, from Der in the north to the Persian Gulf), but the location of the majority of these Mesopotamian and Elamite cities are still contested or entirely unknown. Secondly, since the Trans-Tigridian region was the subject of territorial expansion for Elam, Assyria and Babylonia, this region was reshaped into a battlefield from the 8th century BC onwards. As a consequence of the many military campaigns between Assyria and the allied forces of Elam and Babylonia, the territorial boundaries shifted nearly after each confrontation, as did the ‘nationality’ of the cities and people in that region. Thirdly, the geographical names yield another identification problem. Aramean or Chaldean cities were often renamed after an Assyrian conquest (e.g. Dur-Athara/Dur-Abi-Hara into Dur-Nabu; Samūna into Enlil-iqīša). When the Babylonians regained control, the city was referred to by its original name again. For some cities we are aware of such name changes, but numerous other cases have probably escaped our attention. It is highly possible that a toponym mentioned in a Babylonian text is referring to the same location as a different toponym in an Assyrian document. To make the situation even more complicated, the Elamites had their own name-giving system for border region cities with a mixed Aramean-Babylonian-Elamite population. For example, of the more than hundred Elamite toponyms mentioned in the Susa Acropole texts (Annex 3), most of which are located in the larger Susiana region and partially in the Elamite western border zone, only a few toponyms can be identified (Samūna with Zamin; Dur-Athara/Dur-Abi-Hara/Dur-Nabu/Harâ with Haran; Din-Šarri with Dun-Sunki). As each of these problems outlined above is a research topic on its own, exceeding the scope of my current research, it is only possible to give a preliminary reconstruction. This reconstruction of the geopolitical power of the Neo-Elamite monarchy is primarily based on indigenous archaeological remains (architecture and ceramic), because it reflects the physical presence of the Neo-Elamite culture. With the help of this recent archaeological material, it was possible to define the heartland of the NeoElamite kingdom. The peripheral valleys in the north of Susiana (Deh Luran, Pušt-e Kuh) and the southern plains (Kur River Basin, Fasa & Darab) were added to make sure that no piece of the puzzle would be missing. When there were no archaeological results on a particular valley by the lack of sufficient archaeological research, the iconographical and textual sources were consulted, like for instance in the Izeh valley. If these sources could not provide decisive answers, the valley was excluded. Nevertheless, this system leaves a wide error range, because not every valley in southwestern Iran has already been subjected to archaeological research. Moreover, several archaeological surveys during the 1970s might have failed to identify Neo-Elamite ceramics, since a profound study of this material was only published as late as 1981 by P. de Miroschedji. PART 3: ON THE FORMATION\n\nOF A\n\nLATE NEO-ELAMITE STATE\n\nIn the third part the internal organisation of the Elamite kingdom is thoroughly re-examined. In the first chapter, the Neo-Elamite government system and the governing bodies of the Elamite state will be studied. The second chapter gives an overview of the Neo-Elamite officials employed in the government system.\n\nPERIODIZATION AND CHRONOLOGY\n\n13\n\nResearch on the state formation and the government system of the Neo-Elamite kingdom is very limited and characterized by a highly tentative reconstruction. The contemporary Mesopotamian textual sources give an impression of one centralised Elamite kingdom, while the Elamite sources emphasize smaller coexisting Elamite entities. Most scholars have considered the separation of the king of Elam and the king of Hidalu, together with the growing amount of source material referring to local kings within the Neo-Elamite boundaries, as a sign of fragmentation of the Neo-Elamite realm after the destruction of Susa (Cameron 1936, 167-168; Steve, Vallat & Gasche 2002/03, 477). The idea that Elam never recovered from the Assyrian destructive power remained for a long time the general accepted hypothesis. Recently, Henkelman (2003a; 2008) has portrayed the Neo-Elamite kingdom as a unitary state. In this context, a study of the relation between the central Elamite government and the local rulers at the margins of the Elamite kingdom has to be undertaken. Therefore, the kingdom of Hidalu and Zamin will be taken as case-studies. Zamin as well as Samati, Hara(n) and Zari were located in the northwestern and southwestern periphery, while Hidalu will serve as a highland example. Next to the Elamite king and the local kings, the assembly of the ‘Elders of Elam’ will be briefly addressed. Within the Elamite government system, a large number of officials were employed. There were the magnates of the king (governors and diplomats), members of the palace household, the bureaucratic apparatus, military commanders, and religious staff. However, a high number of Elamite officials are named in the Assyrian royal and administrative inscriptions. Since these texts are written in Akkadian, the Elamite officials are indicated with an Assyrian professional name that most likely corresponds to the content and responsibilities of the Elamite official. The Assyrian inscriptions hence contribute significantly to our knowledge of Elamite functionaries, but do not offer any help when it comes to linking these professionals to the Elamite official titles. In some cases, we can connect an Assyrian title to an Elamite occupation or make a well-founded suggestion, but mostly we grope in the dark.\n\n6. PERIODIZATION AND CHRONOLOGY Scholars have not come to a general agreement on the chronology of the Neo-Elamite period, which consequently has several subdivisions based on archaeological, historical or philological material. Based on the material culture, P. de Miroschedji (1981b, 143-167; also Carter 1984, 182) divided the Neo-Elamite kingdom into two periods: NE I (1000-760 BC) and NE II (760-539 BC). Steve (1992, 21-23) established a relative chronology of the late Elamite texts based on internal linguistic (morphology and syntax) and palaeographic elements. However, the absence of consistent amount of diverse textual material for each of the subdivided periods forced Steve to rely his absolute dating on Mesopotamian sources (Stolper 1987/90, 276-281). Still, he divided the late Neo-Elamite period in two sub-phases. The division based on historical data from textual sources is tripartite (Potts 1999, 206; Waters 2000, 3; Malbran-Labat 2012): NE I (c. 1100-760 BC), NE II (760-646 BC) and NE III (646-539 BC). On the periodization of the Neo-Elamite I period or ‘the Dark Ages’, there is a broad consensus amongst Elamologists. On the contrary, the periodization of the NE II and NE III periods remains a subject of discussion. The beginning of the second phase (NE II) corresponds approximately with the first known Neo-Elamite king Huban-nikaš I through Babylonian sources, more particularly the Neo-Babylonian Chronicle (ABC 1, 9-10). Scholars have proposed two dates (653 BC and 646/645 BC) for the end of the Neo-Elamite II period, based on historical events that had a decisive impact on the Elamite civilization. Generally, the destruction of Elamite capital Susa by the Assyrian king Assurbanipal in 646 BC is taken as the end of the Neo-Elamite II phase (Vallat 1996a; Potts 1999, 260-262). Although the impact of the destruction of the Elamite capital may not have been as large as Assurbanipal claims in his Annals, this was the first time during the Neo-Elamite history that the Assyrian army could march into the political heartland of the Elamite kingdom and even reach the Elamite highlands where they captured the Elamite king Huban-haltaš III. The year 646/645 BC especially marks the point where the Assyrian information on Elamite history stops. After that date, historians are forced to work with the undated Elamite source corpus and fragmentary Neo-Babylonian references. The date therefore is set on methodological issues, because we do not know whether the impact of Assyrian sack of Susa was large enough to cause a rupture in Elamite society.\n\n14\n\nINTRODUCING THE LAST CHAPTER OF ELAMITE HISTORY\n\nThe alternative date for the end of the Neo-Elamite II period is the battle of Til-Tuba in 653 BC (MalbranLabat 2012, 349-352; Waters 2000, 3) when the Elamite king Tepti-Huban-Inšušinak I was captured and killed. After the battle of Til-Tuba, the Assyrian involvement in internal Elamite politics increased dramatically to the point where Assurbanipal was able to place client kings on the Elamite throne. These were relatives of former Elamite kings who had fled to Assyria. Nevertheless, this Elamite defeat did not imply the end of ElamiteAssyrian rivalry. The moment Assurbanipal installed a client king on the Elamite throne, the client king would turn against him, maintaining the centuries old hostility. The year 653 BC thus marks the beginning of the political instability and the growth of Assyrian influence in Elam. Although the battle of Til-Tuba announces the beginning of the ‘rebel kings’ chapter, those kings were still connected to the royal family of the Hubanids. Until the last member of that clan, Huban-haltaš III, actually disappeared from the Elamite political scene in 645 BC, one cannot speak of a rupture in Elamite civilization. The sack of Susa is therefore considered in this work as the beginning of the late Neo-Elamite (III) period. The end of the Neo-Elamite III period has two dates: 539 BC and 520 BC. These dates mark the end of Elamite independence and the annexation of Elam by the Persians. Some scholars assume that Elam was taken during the Persian conquest of Babylonia under Cyrus the Great (539 BC). Other scholars, including myself, consider the suppression of the last Elamite rebelling in 520 BC by Darius the Great to be the end of the Neo-Elamite kingdom. de Miroschedji NE I A NE I B\n\nc.1000-725\n\nNE II NE III A NE III B\n\nSteve c.1000-900 c.900-750 c.750-653\n\nc.725-520\n\nc.653-605 c.605- 539\n\nMalbranLabat\n\nVallat\n\nPotts\n\nWaters\n\n1000-c.760\n\nc.1100-770\n\nc.1000-744\n\nc.1000-743\n\nc.770-646\n\n743-646\n\n743-646\n\nc.760-653 653-539\n\n646-c.585 c.585-539\n\n646-c.585\n\n646-539\n\nÁlvarez-Mon c.1000-900\n\nGorris c.1100-760\n\nc.900-725 725-647 647-626\n\nc.760-646/5 646/5-520\n\n625-520\n\nTable 2: Periodization of the Neo-Elamite period (after Álvarez-Mon 2013a; de Miroschedji 1981a; Steve 1986, 18-21; 1992, 21-22; Vallat 1996a; Potts 1999, 260; Waters 2000, 3)\n\n7. HOW TO USE THIS BOOK NAMES Most Neo-Elamite kings are known through the Mesopotamian sources, in which their personal name is modified to the Assyrian or Babylonian dialect. The names of Elamite kings are always written in their Elamite version, even when we know the kings exclusively from Mesopotamian documents. The personal names of the Elamite kings are written according to their attestation in the Neo-Elamite inscriptions. For example, in the theophoric element Huban/Humban the -m- is omitted, because the additional consonant is not attested in the Neo-Elamite inscriptions, even though the Neo-Assyrian and Middle Elamite inscription refer to the variant (H)umban. Also the Neo-Assyrian attestations of the Neo-Elamite royal names, for which no Neo-Elamite variant is attested, will be converted to the Neo-Elamite palaeography. In this case, Teumman and Hallušu will become Tepti-Huban-Inšušinak and Hallutuš-Inšušinak. Also the Mesopotamian variants, such as Ištarnandi, will be written in the Elamite form Šutur/Šutruk-Nahhunte. The only exception to this rule is Indabibi, because no clear Elamite alternative was found.\n\n15\n\nHOW TO USE THIS BOOK\n\nTRANSLITERATIONS The transliteration system follows the method of W. Henkelman (2008, xix-xx), who refined Hallock’s system (1969) on the Persepolis Fortification texts. The determinatives are written in their logographic value, e.g. the indication of a male name (a vertical wedge) is written diš. Because the Neo-Elamite language used several determinatives be, diš, hal, aš in the same context (Steve 1988), the syllabic values are used instead of the conventional abbreviations, such as the system of W. Hinz & H. Koch (1987; also König 1965) or the system used amongst Assyriologists.

In Elamite language, the word for ‘king’ is always written with the cuneiform sign EŠŠANA (Steve 1992). In modern literature on Elam, one tends to refer to EŠŠANA by the alternative name LUGÀL or SUNKI, which are all the same cuneiform sign. In this dissertation all three names will be used depending on the context, e.g. in the combination DUMU.LUGAL the sign EŠŠANA will always be written LUGÀL.\n\nPART I ON THE KINGS OF NIM.MA.KI AND ON THOSE OF AŠANZAN AŠŠUŠUN\n\n1. THE DARK AGES (c. 1100-760 BC) When the late Middle Elamite king Hutelutuš-Inšušinak (c. 1120-1100 BC) lost the military battle at the banks of the Ulāi River against the Babylonian king Nebuchadnezzar I (c. 1125-1104 BC), the Elamite kings did not just lose control over their southern Mesopotamian territory (RIMA 2, 35:41-43; Brinkman 1968, 105110), they almost completely disappeared from the international scene for over 300 years. Until today, no early Neo-Elamite textual sources can be clearly identified. Only the Tall-i Malyan archive dates perhaps from the early Neo-Elamite period (Stolper 1984, 7; also Steve 1992, NE I A). Due to the scanty historical information, the Neo-Elamite period begins with the so-called ‘Dark Ages’ (NE I, c. 1100-760 BC). The Elamite Dark Ages, however, do not appear as dark as they initially seem to be. Mesopotamian textual sources occasionally refer to Elam, providing us with a glimpse into early Neo-Elamite history. When in the 10th century BC the Elamite capital Susa suffered from a population decrease and the settlement of the Ville Royale II was abandoned (de Miroschedji 1981a, 37), a Babylonian king Mār-bīti-apla-uṣur is said by the Dynastic Chronicle (984-979 BC; ABC 18:13; RIMA 2, 87) to be a remote descendant of Elam (ŠÀ BAL.BAL LIBIR? NIM.MA.KI). The name of Mār-bīti-apla-uṣur was even inscribed in Akkadian on several bronze arrowheads, found in Lurestan (Dossin 1962, 160 pl. 29.19; RIMA 2, 88-89). The Middle Elamite kings had conducted an inter-marriage policy with the Babylonian Kassite rulers to whom they married off their daughters. In this context, Mār-bīti-apla-uṣur might have had an Elamite princess amongst his ancestors (Brinkman 1968, 165). A similar case of mixed marriage may be attested for the parents of king Šutruk-Nahhunte I. This Elamite Šutrukid king was the son of the Elamite king Hallutuš-Inšušinak and the eldest daughter of the Kassite king Meli-šipak II (1186-1172 BC) and he resented the fact that he did not inherit the Babylonian throne even though his mother was a Babylonian princess (van Dijk 1986, 161-166; Steve & Vallat 1989, 228; Goldberg 2004, 33-42; Vallat 2006b, 123-135; contra: Paulus 2013, 429-449). Why me, who is the king, son of a king, the offspring of a king, born as a king of the lands of Babylon and of Elam, offspring of the eldest daughter of the powerful king Kurigalzu, (why) do I not sit on the throne of the land of Babylon? Berlin Letter l. 37-40 (VAT 17020 = BE 133384 = VS 24, 91)\n\nOn the other hand, Mār-bīti-apla-uṣur might have been an outsider who got help from Southern Mesopotamian tribes (Aramean, Sutean, Chaldean), dwelling on Babylonian lands along the Elamite border. Although only few archaeological findings from Susa provide indications on the artistic culture of the Dark Ages, expressions of late Middle Elamite and early Neo-Elamite rock art can be observed in the Izeh valley. Kul-e Farah and Šekaft-e Salman near Malamir in eastern Khuzestan (Calmeyer 1980, 110 n. 49; also De Waele 1973, 1981, 50 n. 4 and 52 n. 4; Stolper 1987/90, 278; Potts 1999, 253-254; Álvarez-Mon 2010b; 2013b) were also carved in the Middle Elamite period but possibly usurped and reused later in the Neo-Elamite period. The rock-cut highland sanctuaries of Kurangun and Naqš-e Rostam (Seidl 1986, 6-19) in Fars were initially constructed in the Sukkalmah period, but were expanded during the Middle Elamite II-III periods. These shrines indicate an Elamite presence in the mountains of Iran through the second half of the 2nd millennium BC and the early 1st millennium BC (Carter 1998, 320). The stratigraphy of the Ville Royale II settlement (de Miroschedji 1981a, level 9-8) shows a continued occupation in Susa from around the middle of the 9th century BC onwards. After the occupation gap in the 10th century BC, the Elamite material culture revived, resulting in the creation of original ceramic shapes, materials and designs, such as the hemispherical bowls and pixie cups. The hemispherical bowls made of frit are exclusively attested in the Neo-Elamite I period. The pixie cups made of frit already existed since the late Middle Elamite period (level 12-10), but the shape and design changed through the early Neo-Elamite period (9th-8th century BC). While the Middle Elamite pixie cups were cylindrical with raised bands, the NeoElamite ones had a cubic or conical shape, decorated with multicolored paint or with incised decoration in vegetal, geometrical and natural motives. Those ceramic innovations together with new and/or resettled inhabitants in Ville Royale II could not have taken place but in a reestablished and politically stable climate. Archaeological material supports the argument of an existing and continuous government during the 9th and the early 8th century BC, although Mesopotamian textual records only provide fragmentary evidence of this royal power.\n\n20\n\nON THE KINGS OF NIM.MA.KI AND ON THOSE OF\n\nAŠ\n\nANZAN\n\nAŠ\n\nŠUŠUN\n\nAt the end of the 9th century BC, an Elamite garrison delivered military support to the Babylonian king Marduk-balāssu-iqbi (818-813 BC) against the Assyrian king Šamši-Adad V (823-811 BC) in the battle of Dur-Papsukkal near Der (814 BC) (RIMA 3, A.0.103 iv 38; Steve, Gasche & de Meyer 1980, 78). They might have been mercenary troops that provided the contingent of bowmen, but more likely Elamite soldiers were sent by an unknown Elamite king to reinforce the Babylonian army for economic and strategic reasons. The environment of Der has always been a disputed border region between Elam and Assyria. A fragmentary letter to the Assyrian king Šamši-Adad V in the aftermath of the battle of Dur-Papsukkal (SAA 3, 41; RIMA 3, A.0.103.4) describes how the people of Der, Parsumaš and Bit-Bunakki on the border of Elam abandoned their city after the Assyrian destruction and sought shelter in Elam. Elam was considered a haven of refuge where the Assyrian king would not have attempted to intrude the territory of his strong Elamite opponent. Several documents from the reign of the Assyrian king Adad-nirari III (811-783 BC), son of Šamši-Adad V, refer to Elamites. In 784 BC, Adad-nirari III received a diplomatic visit of an Elamite ambassador (LÚ MAH KUR NIM.MA-a-a) at the court of Nimrud (Zadok 1994, 47). In the same document from fort Šalmaneser, the manufacturing of an Elamite bow for the Assyrian army is mentioned (CTN 3, 145). The Assyrian palace also employed Elamites, as is indicated in the Nimrud administration (Dalley-Postgate 1984, 145 iv 13), where they received wine rations (784 BC) for their services. The reigns of Adad-nirari’s successors, Šalmaneser IV, Ašur-Dan III and Ašur-nirari V, mark a rather obscure period in Neo-Assyrian history, in which the authority of the Assyrian kings appears to have been weakened. Military, diplomatic and political contacts with Elam were severely reduced since the Assyrian kings did not campaign anymore in the Zagros, Babylonia or Chaldea (Young 1988, 12-13). This is probably why the Mesopotamian sources become once again silent on the history of their Elamite neighbour. The weakened Assyrian empire may have contributed to the revival and expansion of the Elamite kingdom. The first sign of the growing Elamite political influence is attested in the Babylonian Chronicle during the reign of the Assyrian king Tiglath-pileser III and the Babylonian monarch Nabu-naṣir.\n\n2. THE FIRST NEO-ELAMITE DYNASTY (c. 760-688 BC) 2.1. Huban-tahra (*-743 BC) & Huban-nikaš I1 (743-717 BC) It is not until the mid-8th century BC that the name of a Neo-Elamite king can be found in the Babylonian Chronicle (ABC 1:9-10; CM 16). Huban-nikaš I ascended the throne of Elam in the fifth year of Nabu-naṣir’s reign (747-733 BC). We do not possess indigenous Elamite sources on Huban-nikaš I, but the Annals of Assurbanipal (669-627 BC) give us a glimpse on his ancestry. I took away to Assyria 32 statues of kings, made of silver, gold, bronze and alabaster from Susa, Madaktu and Huradu, including the statue of Ummanigaš (Huban-nikaš I), son of Umbadara (Huban-tahra), the statue of Ištarnanhundi (Šutruk-Nahhunte II), the statue of Hallušu (Hallutuš-Inšušinak I), and the statue of the later Tammaritu (I), which I removed on the command of Assur and Ištar. BIWA 54 F v 34-39\n\nWhen reading the Babylonian Chronicle and the Annals of Assurbanipal, it is difficult to tell whether Huban-tahra was an Elamite king and the founder of the first Neo-Elamite dynasty, or rather an Elamite nobleman, whose son founded such a dynasty. Most scholars (ElW 680, 1225; Vallat 1996a, 389-390; 2002a, 374) are inclined to assign Elamite kingship to Huban-tahra, in order to extend the existence of a Neo-Elamite royal family into the first part of the 8th century BC.\n\n1\n\nThe Akkadian orthography of the Elamite name Huban-nikaš ‘Huban has blessed’: diš dḫum-ba-ni-ga-áš, dišḫu-um-ba-ni-ga-áš, dišḫu-bani-ga-áš, dišum-man-i-ga-áš, dišum-man-i-gaš, dišum-man-ni-gaš, dišum-man-ga-áš, dišum-ma-ni-ga-áš, dišum-ma-ni-i-gáš, dišum-ma-ni-gáš, dišumma-i-gaš, dišam-man-i-gáš (PNA 1382). For the Elamite name Huban-tahra (Zadok 1984, 12), there is only one Assyrian variant um-ba-dara-a (PNA 1378).\n\nTHE FIRST NEO-ELAMITE DYNASTY (c. 760-688 BC)\n\n21\n\nAlthough the Assyrian Annals of Assurbanipal mention Huban-tahra as the father of the Elamite king Huban-nikaš I, they do not refer to him as a king (Waters 2000, 12-13; Tavernier 2004, 22). Waters (2000, 12) is right in pointing out that the occurrence of the name of Huban-tahra in the fragment cited above serves as a patronymic to distinguish him from Assurbanipal’s contemporary Huban-nikaš II (653-652 BC), the son of Urtak. On the other hand, all the names of the Elamite kings are preceded by a personenkeil, without a LUGÀL logogram, which does not reveal any clarification on Huban-tahra’s kingship either. The only fact we can deduce from the structure of the passage in Assurbanipal’s Annals is that Huban-tahra had no statue, as the sumerogram ALAN.NU is not mentioned in connection to his name. Or, more precisely, there was no statue of Huban-tahra anymore or at least not one that Assurbanipal took, when he and his Assyrian army arrived in Susa (646 BC). In the fifth year of Nabu-naṣir: Huban-nikaš ascended the throne in Elam [….] The fifth year of Marduk-apla-iddina: Huban-nikaš, king of Elam, went to his destiny. For twenty-six years, Huban-nikaš ruled Elam. Šutur-Nahhunte, his sister’s son, ascended the throne in Elam. ABC 1, 9-10, 38-40; CM 16\n\nAccording to Waters (2000, 12), the Babylonian Chronicle should have recorded the Elamite king Hubantahra, as the document started with the reign of Nabu-naṣir (747-733 BC), four years before Huban-nikaš I ascended the throne of Elam. However, this is not entirely correct. The Chronicle begins in the third regnal year of Nabu-naṣir with the accession of the Assyrian king Tiglath-pileser III, but that does not change the fact that the name of Huban-tahra is omitted. Firstly, if the accession of Huban-tahra was mentioned in the Babylonian Chronicle, his kingship should have been listed during the reign of the Babylonian king Nabu-šuma-iškun (760-748 BC), the predecessor of Nabu-naṣir, which is out of the scope of the Babylonian Chronicle. Hence, the syntax of the Chronicle — the date, cause of death and length of the predecessor’s reign followed by the accession of the new king — would have easily allowed the author to include a verse recording the death of Huban-tahra during the reign of Marduk-apla-iddina right before the sentence mentioning the accession of Huban-nikaš I. Then why did the compiler of the Babylonian Chronicle omit the end of Huban-tahra’s reign, when he decided to let the Chronicle start from the accession of the Assyrian king Tiglath-pileser III in the third year of Nabu-naṣir onwards?2 As far as I see, there are three possibilities: (1) he left out the passage for an undetermined reason (literary reason, correctness, …), as he did with the predecessor of Tiglath-pileser III; (2) Huban-tahra was not an Elamite king; (3) the author did not know the previous king of Elam. The latter reason is rather doubtful, because the Annals of Assurbanipal, written more than a century before this Chronicle, did record the ancestry of Huban-nikaš I (Dubovsky 2013, 451-457). This might suggest that Huban-tahra was an Elamite nobleman whose son Huban-nikaš I was able to fill in the Dark Age power vacuum by uniting the local aristocracy into a central authority, although other arguments plead against this hypothesis. Henkelman (2003a, 253; 2003b, 182 n. 3) rightfully stated that there is no reason to assume that Hubannikaš I was the founder of an Elamite dynasty, only because there is no earlier entry available in the Babylonian Chronicle. And indeed, more than fifty years after the battle of Dur-Papsukkal, the Chronicle on the Babylonian king Nabu-šuma-iškun (760-748 BC; CM 52, iii 7, 21; RIMA 2, B.6.14.1 iii 14’-15’), father of Nabu-naṣir, provides the most convincing argument for the presence of a royal authority in Elam.3 Although this document does not mention the name of an Elamite king, Elam seems to have been of great importance to Babylonia in the period prior to the reign of Huban-nikaš I. On two different occasions Nabu-šuma-iškun tried to win over Elamite sympathy. In his first regnal year, he transferred Babylonian inhabitants to Elam as a sign of respect (Cole 1994, 235-236). In his 6th regnal year, Nabu-šuma-iškun gave (women adorned with) silver, gold and precious stones that he took out of the Esagil temple in Babylon (Cole 1994, 248-249): NÍG É.SAG.GIL ma-la ba-šu-ú […] ú-še-ṣa-am-ma […] KÙ.BABBAR KÙ.GI NA4.MEŠ ni-siq-ti šu-qu-ru-ti ù mim-ma si-mat DINGIR-ú-ti ma-la ba-šú-u [DINGIR.MEŠ KUR tam-tim LÚ kal-du u LÚ a-ra-mu GIN7 bi-bil lìb-bi-šú ú-šat-ri-ṣa i-na lìb-bi MUNUS.ŠÀ.É.GAL-šú ú-za-an-a-na šul-ma-nu-ti a-na KUR ḫat-ti u KUR NIM.MA.KI i-šar-ra[k]. 2\n\nAccording to Waerzeggers (2012, 289), the Chronicle was written around 500 BC, nearly 250 years after the reign of these kings. Despite the valuable information on Elam, the historical importance of this late Neo-Babylonian Chronicle can be questioned. The content frames in a late Babylonian/Seleucid tradition of monarchs remembered for their wicked kingship. 3\n\n22\n\nON THE KINGS OF NIM.MA.KI AND ON THOSE OF\n\nAŠ\n\nANZAN\n\nAŠ\n\nŠUŠUN\n\nHe took out the possessions of the Esagil, as much as there were. […] He made offerings of silver, gold, valuable precious gems and all the symbols of divinity, as much as there were, to the gods of Sealand, of the Chaldeans and of the Arameans, as his heart desired. In the same way, he would adorn the women of his palace with them (and) give (them) to the Hatti and Elam as gifts. Chronicle on Nabu-šuma-iškun (iii 36-45)\n\nFrom the syntax of the passage, it remains difficult to determine whether he gave precious stones or rather women adorned with those precious stones as a gift to Elam. A possessive suffix after the verb šaraku would have clarified the passage. On the other hand, those lavish gifts of women and/or precious gems to please the Elamites might predict the later political and military power of the Neo-Elamite kingdom. Within the context of the international Near Eastern relations of that time, one can suspect that the Babylonian king Nabu-šuma-iškun intended to establish an alliance with the Elamites, perhaps with the contemporary Elamite king Huban-tahra, against the weakened Assyrian rulers. This initial approach resulted a generation later in a coalition between Huban-nikaš I and Merodach-baladan II against the Assyrian king Sargon II in the battle of Der (720 BC), after which the Elamite influence in Southern Mesopotamia was restored once again. On an archaeological level, Huban-nikaš I seems to have been a transition figure, introducing a new Elamite era with territorial expansion and military coalitions with the Babylonians.4 De Miroschedji (1981a, 39) dates level 7B in Ville Royale II around 725/700 BC, which corresponds with the end of Huban-nikaš I’s reign.\n\n2.2. Huban-immena & Šutruk-Nahhunte II (717-699 BC)5 2.2.1. Mesopotamian sources on the royal descent of Šutruk-Nahhunte II Šutruk-Nahhunte II inherited the Elamite throne from his uncle Huban-nikaš I, who had made the Elamite kingdom once again an international player in Near Eastern politics through economic and territorial reinforcement. According to the Babylonian Chronicle, Šutruk-Nahhunte II was the elder brother of HallutušInšušinak I (ABC 1, ii 32-34 = CM 16), the son of Huban-nikaš I’s sister (mār aḫātišu) and therefore the nephew of Huban-nikaš I (ABC 1, i 38-40). The translation of the Elamite construction ruhu šak, based on the Akkadian mār aḫātišu (sister’s son) has often been a subject of discussion (Glassner 1994, 220-221 n. 4, 226 n. 30; Vallat 1997b, 65-66). Unlike Elamite, the Akkadian language makes a clear difference in gender relations in connection to kinship. Its vocabulary for appointing kinship was so detailed that even the family branch was mentioned. The word nephew could be expressed with two constructions (CAD M/2, 200); the first, mār aḫišu (ABL 280; ABL 830), highlights the male side of the family to be distinguished from mār aḫi abišu ‘cousin’ (CAD M/2, 200), whereas the second mār aḫātišu (MDP 2, 1; MDP 23, 282-284; MDP 28, 296-297; ABL 282) refers to the female branch. The construction mār aḫātišu clearly includes a female player, being the sister. The word sister is used in several other components of kinship terms (CAD A/1, 171), such as aḫāt abi ‘paternal aunt’ and aḫāt ummi ‘maternal aunt’. All aforementioned constructions were frequently used in Neo-Babylonian and Neo-Assyrian phrases, often referring to Elamite events (CAD M/2, 171, 200). Therefore, it cannot be a coincidence that the compiler of the Babylonian Chronicle wrote mār aḫātišu to indicate the descent of Šutruk-Nahhunte II. As the Akkadians had no tendency to feminize grammar constructions, they actually meant: the male offspring of the sister, who founded with her husband a side-branch to the royal genealogy. 4 Before the battle of Der, Huban-nikaš I had already attempted to lay his hand on the region of Der. A Nimrud letter, written during the reign of Tiglath-pileser III, described the approaching army of the Neo-Elamite king under command of the general Zineni (ND 2761= CTN 5, 41 = Saggs 2001; PNA 1446-1447). The letter states that Zineni had already crossed the river bridge with the entire Elamite army and had made their camp on the territory of an allied Aramean tribe. Apparently, the Elamite army posed a real threat, since the governor of Arrapha was summoned to join the battle. Since the allied Elamite-Babylonian forces returned to Der in 720 BC, the outcome of the first Elamite attempt to conquer the Der region must have failed. 5 Mesopotamian orthography of the Elamite name Šutruk/Šutur-Nahhunte (PNA 1296): diššu-túr-dna-ḫu-un-di, diššu-túr-na-ḫu-un-di, diššutúr-dna-ḫu-du, diššu-tur-dna-ḫu-un-di, dišiš-tar-na-an-ḫu-un-di, dišiš-tar-na-an-di, iš-tar-ḫu-un-du. Huban-immena is only attested in Elamite sources (EKI 71-73).\n\nTHE FIRST NEO-ELAMITE DYNASTY (c. 760-688 BC)\n\n23\n\nElamite language had no ability to express gender differences; it only distinguished animated versus inanimated forms (Stolper 2004a, 73-74; Tavernier 2011a, 321). This makes the reference to kinship less accurate and the interpretation of kinship constructions much harder for modern scholars. The expression ruhu šak is a combination of the Elamite words for mother’s son ruhu and father’s son šak (ElW 1045-1046) and is often used to indicate the legitimate heir to the Elamite throne (Vallat 2006a; Tavernier 2003, 202-203). According to Waters (2000, 26; Vallat 1995b, 1029; Malbran-Labat 1995, 176) the primary legitimacy to the Elamite throne passed through the sons of the king’s daughter, if the king had no successors of his own. However, it is doubtful that this was the case, because the sons of the king’s daughter, his grandsons, were probably too young to succeed the king at his death. Therefore, the first-born son of the king’s (eldest?) sister, who belonged to the same generation as the king’s daughter, would have been the most appropriate heir by age and by royal bloodline. If Huban-nikaš I remained childless or only had daughters, his nephew Šutruk-Nahhunte was the first legal heir to the Elamite throne. Concerning the Mesopotamian information on the ancestry of Šutruk-Nahhunte II, Vallat (1997b, 65) convincingly argued that the Akkadian-speaking author of the Babylonian Chronicle (ABC 1, i 40) wrote the mār aḫātišu passage for a Mesopotamian audience. The Elamite parallel construction ruhu šak, having a secondary meaning ‘legitimate heir’, does not occur in the Elamite inscriptions of Šutruk-Nahhunte II and can therefore not be used in connection to the descent of Šutruk-Nahhunte II. The only Neo-Elamite attestations of ruhu šak can be found in late Elamite legal texts from Susa (S. 301; S. 306) in connection to a witness list. Thus, mār aḫātišu can only mean ‘nephew’ in the case of the Babylonian Chronicle. 2.2.2. Elamite sources on the royal descent of Šutruk-Nahhunte II On a Neo-Elamite foundation tablet (EKI 72; IRS 57), Šutruk-Nahhunte II explains his patrilineal ancestry. The structure of this Elamite text — presentation of the king, patronymic, titulary, patrilineal descendance, purpose of the inscription, and the dedication to the gods — presents some remarkable features. ŠutrukNahhunte II describes his full patrilineal ancestry, which is highly exceptional in royal Elamite texts. An Elamite king usually limits his genealogy to the patronymic in the first two lines of the inscription. Here, ŠutrukNahhunte II identifies himself as the son of Huban-immena. After the general titulary, Šutruk-Nahhunte II dedicates two more lines to his connection to the Middle Elamite kings Hutelutuš-Inšušinak and Šilhina-hamruLagamar of the Šutrukid dynasty and a yet unknown king Huban-immena. I (am) Šutruk-Nahhunte, son of Huban-immena, who enlarged the kingdom, heir to the throne of Elam, the ruler protecting the dynasty of Elam, the loving servant of the gods Napiriša and Inšušinak. The king Hutelutuš-Inšušinak, the king Šilhina-hamru-Lagamar, the king Huban-immena, in total 3 kings were surrounding me. EKI 72:1-6\n\nThe name Huban-immena appears twice in the passage; once as the father of Šutruk-Nahhunte II and once as the last king in the lineage of Šutrukid kings (EKI 72; IRS 58:1-6). Despite several proposals to give these gentlemen their place in history, the identification of the father and/or the king (EKI 72-73) Huban-immena remains disputed (Vallat 1996a; Tavernier 2004). In my opinion, only two possible solutions can be offered: either the father of Šutruk-Nahhunte II was indeed king Huban-immena or the inscription refers to two different individuals from another era. 1) Following the first hypothesis, Šutruk-Nahhunte II places his father Huban-immena just after a lineage of Middle Elamite kings. Elamologists (König 1971a, 226; Waters 2000, 16-18) often considered Hubanimmena a king, based on the simple fact that his son was a king. Vallat (2002a, 375) went a step further by claiming that Huban-immena, father of Šutruk-Nahhunte II, is to be identified with the king mentioned in Šutruk-Nahhunte’s Middle Elamite royal triad. Despite this persuasive idea, numerous reasons can be found to counter this argument. In the Ancient Near East, the father’s name was applied in the same way as modern society uses the family name. The patronymic did not necessarily indicate the status or the profession of the father. The fact that Šutruk-Nahhunte II was a king does not have to imply that the father exercised the same office, only because the anthroponym appears twice in the same inscription.\n\n24\n\nON THE KINGS OF NIM.MA.KI AND ON THOSE OF\n\nAŠ\n\nANZAN\n\nAŠ\n\nŠUŠUN\n\nIf king Huban-immena was the same person as the father of Šutruk-Nahhunte II, then why would Elamite and Mesopotamian sources not give a coherent image of Šutruk-Nahhunte’s descent? In his analysis of the Neo-Elamite inscriptions, Vallat (1996a, 389-340) tries to give Huban-immena a place amongst the early Neo-Elamite kings by introducing Huban-immena as the elder brother and predecessor of Huban-nikaš I. In this way, the reign of Huban-immena fell out of the scope of the Babylonian Chronicle. Elsewhere however, Vallat (1997b, 65) defends the mār aḫātišu (sister’s son) passage of the Babylonian Chronicle, in which Šutruk-Nahhunte II is the son of Huban-nikaš I’s sister. If this were true, the sister of Huban-nikaš I, would have married her own brother Huban-immena. Nevertheless, marriage between siblings is rarely the case in Elamite culture. As far as I know, the late Middle Elamite princess Nahhunte-utu is the only Elamite woman who presumably married her brothers (Yusifov 1974, 326-327). Another argument to exclude Huban-immena, the father of Šutruk-Nahhunte, from the Neo-Elamite king’s list is the passage in the Annals of Assurbanipal (BIWA 54 F v 34-39, 241), where the three (four if Hubantahra is included) successive kings of the first Neo-Elamite dynasty Huban-nikaš I, Šutruk-Nahhunte II and Hallutuš-Inšušinak I are listed without a reference to Huban-immena. If Šutruk-Nahhunte II wanted to enlarge his claim to the Elamite throne by adding the name of his father to the Šutrukid dynasty, then he would have taken the effort to insert the full lineage of ancestors with his immediate predecessors, Hubantahra and Huban-nikaš I. To my knowledge, there is no other example of an Elamite king who refers to two distant predecessors, and then jumps to his immediate predecessor. Either Ancient Near Eastern kings listed all the predecessors in their family, as did the Achaemenid king Darius the Great (DBp i 3-6), or they only referred to their immediate predecessor. Šutruk-Nahhunte II perhaps placed his father in a lineage of Middle Elamite kings to enlarge his claim on the Elamite throne, because he might not have been the biological heir to the Elamite throne. Consequently, he felt the need to affiliate his own ancestry with the great rulers of Elam. To place his father amongst the Elamite Šutrukid kings, he ought to compensate his family background and strengthen his legitimacy as the monarch of Elam. A similar example of implementing the lineage of an usurper into a royal genealogy is attested in the Achaemenid dynasty. In the Bisitun inscription (DBp i 3-6), Darius the Great claimed to be the "
