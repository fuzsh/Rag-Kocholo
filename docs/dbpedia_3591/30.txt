THE NEW IRAQI GOVERNMENT

IBRAHIM JAAFARI: PRIME MINISTER

Ibrahim Jaafari, a 58-year-old physician, was spokesman for the Islamic Daawa Party, one of Iraq's oldest political parties. Born in Karbala in 1947, he was educated at Mosul university as a medical doctor. He lived in Iran and UK from the 1980s until the fall of Saddam Hussein. When he was serving in the mainly ceremonial role of vice-president in the US-appointed interim regime, an opinion poll last year suggested Mr Jaafari was Iraq's most popular politician. Mr Jaafari is widely seen as a unifying figure, keen to bring Sunni Arabs into the democratic fold after their widespread absence from election polling stations.

AHMED CHALABI: DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER

Ahmed Chalabi's appointment as a deputy prime minister is something of a revival for a man once touted at the Pentagon as a future president of Iraq, but who fell dramatically from grace. During 2004 the Shia politician saw his home and offices raided and an arrest warrant issued amid accusations of counterfeiting. Mr Chalabi, who had the ear of many in Washington during the run-up to war, fell out with his former patrons as the invasion of Iraq turned to messy occupation. There were whispers from Washington that Mr Chalabi, a Shia, had all along been duping the Americans by spying for the Iranians, which he has denied.

RUZ NURI SHAWIS: DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER

He was active in opposition to Saddam Hussein, who sentenced him to death in absentia and confiscated his assets.
