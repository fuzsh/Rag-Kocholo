        "text": "One of the most senior leaders of Saddam Hussein’s government and the highest-ranking figure to have eluded capture after the American invasion in 2003 has died, according to Iraqi officials and the deceased dictator’s Baath Party.\n\nThe party said on Sunday that Izzat Ibrahim al-Douri, a close aide to Mr. Hussein, had died in Iraq a day earlier. Muqtada al-Sadr, a populist Shiite cleric and a leading political figure in the country now, tweeted about Mr. Douri’s death, wishing on him “hell and a bad destiny.”\n\nThe Baath Party did not give a cause of death. But Mr. Douri suffered from leukemia and received treatment for it for years, according to Essam Alrawi, a commander and a militant in the Baath Party, who spoke in an interview from the Jordanian capital, Amman."
