        "text": "More on:\n\nIraq\n\nThis publication is now archived.\n\nWho are the new Iraqi leaders?\n\nThe members of the Iraqi Interim Government (IIG) were appointed June 1 by U.N. Special Envoy Lakhdar Brahimi. They were selected after a long consultative process by Brahimi, who met with hundreds of Iraqis from around the country before making his choices. U.S. officials, including L. Paul Bremer III, the head of the Coalition Provisional Authority, and Ambassador Robert D. Blackwill, an aide to National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice, had significant input. But perhaps the key role in selecting the government was played by the Iraqi Governing Council (IGC), the caretaker government that served under the U.S.-led occupation since July 2003 and dissolved itself June 1.\n\nWhat are their backgrounds?\n\nThe 37 officials are a diverse group that reflects the ethnic and religious divisions in Iraq. The president is a Sunni Arab—a group that makes up some 20 percent of Iraq’s population and was dominant under Saddam Hussein’s regime. A secular Shiite holds the more powerful prime minister’s post. Some 60 percent of Iraqis are Shiites. Kurds, who make up most of the remaining population, have a number of key posts, including one of the two deputy presidencies. There is also one Assyrian and one Turkmen minister, representatives of small Iraqi ethnic groups.\n\nMany of the top posts are held by politicians, exiles, and former IGC members. But most of the lower-ranking ministries appear to be headed by highly educated technocrats. Six of the lower-profile ministries are headed by women.\n\nWho holds the top posts?\n\nMostly former members of the IGC. The group of six includes a leading Sunni tribal sheik, three Shiite politicians, and two prominent Kurdish politicians. Five of the six have spent a considerable part of their adult lives in exile.\n\nPresident:\n\nSheik Ghazi Ajil al-Yawar, 45, is a Sunni and an important sheik in the Shammar tribe, one of Iraq’s largest. He is the immediate past president of the IGC—its presidency rotated on a monthly basis—and won the support of the majority of its members for this post. He won the job after Adnan Pachachi, 81, a former foreign minister, reportedly refused an offer from Brahimi. Born in Mosul, Yawar studied engineering at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C., and spent 15 years in exile in Saudi Arabia\n\nDeputy president:\n\nDr. Ibrahim Jaafari, 57, served on the IGC. Born in Karbala, he is the chief spokesman for the Da’wa Party, a Shiite Islamist group that was founded in Iraq in the late 1950s and was later banned by Saddam Hussein’s regime. Jaafari fled Iraq in 1980 for Iran, then moved to London in 1989. He earned his medical degree from Mosul University.\n\nDeputy president:\n\nRowsch Shaways, 57, is the current president of the Kurdistan National Assembly in northern Iraq. He earned a doctorate in engineering in Germany and returned to Iraq in 1975 to join the Kurdish rebellion against Saddam Hussein. A senior member of the Kurdish Democratic Party (KDP), one of the two main Kurdish political parties, he became the deputy prime minister of the joint Kurdistan regional government in 1992, after the withdrawal of Saddam Hussein’s forces from the Kurdish-held area protected by a U.N.-sanctioned no-fly zone.\n\nPrime minister:\n\nDr. Iyad Allawi, 59, is the co-founder of the London-based Iraqi National Accord (INA), an opposition group supported by the CIA that staged an unsuccessful coup d’etat against Saddam Hussein in 1996. A secular Shiite, he was a Baathist who served in the Iraqi intelligence services until falling out with the regime and leaving Iraq in 1971 to study medicine in London. On returning to Iraq, he became a member of the IGC and chair of its security committee. Born in Baghdad, he is a neurologist and a businessman.\n\nDeputy prime minister for national security:\n\nBarham Salih, 44, was most recently the regional administrator of Sulaimaniya in Iraqi Kurdistan. Born in northern Iraq, he joined the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK), the other main Iraqi Kurdish political party, in 1976 and was arrested twice by the Iraqi secret police. After fleeing Iraq in 1979, he became the PUK’s spokesman in London and, later, in Washington, D.C. He holds a doctorate in statistics and computer modeling from the University of Liverpool.\n\nNational security adviser:\n\nDr. Mowaffak al-Rubaie is the former Da’wa spokesman in London and served on the IGC. He is also a neurologist and human rights activist.\n\nWho heads the most important ministries?\n\nThe diverse group of six includes three Sunnis—a tribal sheik, a U.S.-trained engineer, and a distinguished Iraqi lawyer—as well as an oil technocrat, a Kurdish diplomat, and a Shiite economist who belongs to an important Islamist political party. Four spent much of their adulthoods in exile. They are:\n\nMinister of defense:\n\nHazem Sha’alan, 57, is a Sunni and the sheik of the Ghazal tribe.

Born in Samarra, he is a U.S.-trained civil engineer.\n\nMinister of finance:\n\nAdel Abdul Mahdi, 62, is an economist and a member of the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq (SCIRI), a Shiite Islamist group that opposed Saddam Hussein’s regime.

In 2003, he was elected president of the Iraqi Bar Association and also serves as the chairman of the special task force on compensation for victims of the Saddam Hussein regime.\n\nWho are the other ministers?\n\nSome have ties to various political parties, but many appear to be technocrats.
