        "text": "H.E. Mr. Ibrahim al-Jaafari, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Iraq will pay an official visit to Turkey on 5-7 November 2014 upon the invitation of the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Turkey, H.E. Mr. Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu.\n\nTurkey is in solidarity with the friendly and brotherly people of Iraq in their fight against ISIL terrorism. We will continue to stand by Iraq resolutely in its struggle against formidable challenges, as we have done until now.\n\nThe visit of Iraqi Foreign Minister H.E. Ibrahim al-Jaafari to Turkey will be the most clear indicator of the support we extend to Iraq for its fight against terrorism, strengthening its culture of democracy, regaining its rightful place in the region, and for the people of Iraq to attain a brighter future as they well deserve. On the occasion of the visit, we will be discussing bilateral, regional and international issues of common concern.\n\nForeign Minister H.E. Mr. Ibrahim al-Jaafari will also be received by H.E. Mr. Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, President of the Republic of Turkey, H.E. Mr. Cemil Çiçek, Speaker of the Grand National Assembly of Turkey and H.E. Mr. Ahmet Davutoğlu, Prime Minister of the Republic of Turkey.\n\nWe believe that Iraqi Foreign Minister’s visit to Turkey will contribute to adding momentum to the relations between Turkey and Iraq and will further strengthen our cooperation."
