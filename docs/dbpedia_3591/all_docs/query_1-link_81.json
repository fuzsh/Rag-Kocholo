        "text": "BAGHDAD, IRAQ - Interim Vice President Ibrahim al-Jaafari was chosen as his Shiite ticket’s candidate for prime minister Tuesday after Ahmad Chalabi dropped his bid, senior alliance officials said.\n\nMr. al-Jaafari’s selection means he likely will lead Iraq’s first democratically elected government in 50 years. But first he has to be approved by a coalition that likely will include the Kurds, and then he must be approved by a majority of the newly elected National Assembly.\n\nPressure from within the ranks of the United Iraqi Alliance, which won Iraq’s landmark Jan. 30 election, forced the withdrawal of Mr. Chalabi, a one-time Pentagon favorite, said Hussein al-Moussawi from the Shiite Political Council, an umbrella group for 38 Shiite parties.\n\nMeanwhile, two explosions echoed through Baghdad at midday. A plume of black smoke rose from the Green Zone, where Iraqi government offices and the U.S. Embassy are located.\n\nPolice Capt. Muthanna Hassan said one of the blasts was a car bomb that exploded as an Iraqi special forces convoy passed by, killing two soldiers and wounding 20 others. It was not clear what caused the other blast.\n\nIn western Baghdad, masked gunmen hurled explosives into a Shiite mosque in the Ghazaliyah neighborhood, police Capt. Sa’ad Jawad Kadhim said. The explosives failed to detonate and guards opened fire on the attackers, killing one and forcing the rest to flee, Capt. Kadhim said.\n\nAlso in Baghdad, police foiled a suicide bombing, arresting a Sudanese man who tried to detonate an explosives-laden belt inside the Adnan Khair Allah hospital, Interior Ministry Capt. Ahmed Ismael said.\n\nIt was apparently the second suicide mission involving a Sudanese. At least one man believed to be of Sudanese origin carried out a suicide bombing Saturday in Baghdad, part of a wave of violence that killed 55 people on Ashoura, the holiest day of the Shiite calendar.\n\nAlso in the capital, a U.S. military convoy was hit in a roadside bomb attack in the southern neighborhood of Doura, police Lt. Haitham Abdul Razak said.\n\nU.S. troops exchanged fire with gunmen in Samarra, 60 miles north of the capital. One Iraqi was killed in a mortar strike there, said Dr. Aala al-Deen Mohammed.\n\nMr. al-Jaafari said dealing with insurgents and re-establishing security would be the first task of his government if he becomes prime minister. “The security situation is the first matter we will address,” he said.\n\nSome of Mr. Chalabi’s aides, including Qaisar Witwit, suggested he was being offered the post of deputy prime minister in charge of economic and security affairs. When asked about such a deal, Mr. Chalabi said simply, “We will see.”\n\nMr. Chalabi said he dropped out of the race “for the unity of the alliance.” He would not say if he had been offered a post in the new government.\n\nAs of Tuesday, at least 1,484 members of the U.S. military have died since the beginning of the Iraq war in March 2003, according to an Associated Press count. At least 1,126 died as a result of hostile action, according to the Defense Department.\n\nU.S. TOLL"
