In 1980 he fled to Iran and, to protect his family from retribution by the Iraqi regime, adopted the name al-Jaafari. He was chosen prime minister by the United Iraqi Alliance, a coalition of Shi`ite parties which won the 2005 elections.\n\nJaakson, Ernst (Rudolf) (b. Aug. 11, 1905, Riga, Russia [now in Latvia] - d. Sept. 4, 1998, New York City), Estonian diplomat. He was permanent representative to the United Nations (1991-94) and ambassador to the United States (1991-93). For the exile government he was consul-general in New York in charge of the legation (1965-91).\n\nJaakson, Jüri (b.

She was justice minister (1994-95), leader of the Centre Party (2000-03), and speaker of parliament (2003). She guided the Centre Party to victory in the 2003 elections but resigned after only two months in office due to what was dubbed the \"Iraqgate\" scandal. In March 2004 she was acquitted of any wrongdoing in the affair. She had been accused of asking a presidential advisor, Martti Manninen, to hand over secret papers about the Finnish involvement in the Iraq war during the election campaign. The court found that although she was not entitled to the documents, the request she made to Manninen did not constitute incitement to a crime. Manninen, however, was fined for handing over the material. Jäätteenmäki, who remained a popular politician, was elected to the European Parliament in the June 2004 elections as the leading candidate of the Centre Party.\n\nJabang, Lamin Kiti (b. Dec. 12, 1942, Pirang, Gambia), foreign minister (1977-87) and interior minister (1987-94) of The Gambia. He was also ambassador to Saudi Arabia (2006-10).\n\nJabir\n\nJabir Al Ahmad Al Jabir Al Sabah, Sheikh (b. June 29, 1926, Kuwait city, Kuwait - d. Jan. 15, 2006, Kuwait city), emir of Kuwait (1977-2006). The third son of Sheikh Ahmad Al Jabir Al Sabah (ruler 1921-50), he played a leading role in Kuwait's administration from an early age. After Iraq claimed sovereignty over newly independent Kuwait in 1961, he led a six-man mission to an Arab League council meeting in Cairo to negotiate a settlement. He became prime minister and minister of finance and economy (1962-63) and minister of finance and industry (1963-65). In 1965 he again became prime minister and the following year he was formally designated crown prince by agreement among members of the ruling family whereby his own Jabir Al Sabah branch of Kuwait's ruling family divides the highest authority in the state with the Salim Al Sabah branch. By the early 1970s the emir, his cousin Sheikh Sabah Al Salim Al Sabah, suffering from poor health, had left most of the government operations to Sheikh Jabir, and on Dec. 31, 1977, Sheikh Sabah died and Jabir became emir. In May 1985 he narrowly escaped after an Islamic extremist drove a car bomb into a royal motorcade. During the middle of the night on Aug. 2, 1990, he was awakened by a phone call from army headquarters. He was told that Iraqi troops were pouring over the Kuwaiti border by the thousands - a massive surprise attack for which the Kuwaiti military could not have prepared. Not five minutes after the emir was taken to safety, Iraqi helicopters and ground troops attacked the building. He resided in exile at a luxury hotel complex in al-Ta´if, Saudi Arabia. At a press conference he told reporters, \"We have to liberate Kuwait. Whatever it takes, we would like to have it done.\" It was done by a U.S.-led international force in early 1991, and he returned to Kuwait on March 14. He was seldom seen in public after suffering a minor stroke in 2001.\n\nJabir Al Ali Al Salim Al Sabah (b. 1927), deputy prime minister of Kuwait (1975-81).

From 1980 to 1982, he worked as a legislative assistant for the parliamentary delegation of Kwajalein. In 1983, he became the first mayor of Kwajalein Atoll, a post he held for the next eight years. He first joined the parliament in 1991 as a senator representing Kwajalein Atoll and in 1995 was elected as senator representing Jaluit Atoll. In 2009-12 he was speaker of the Nitijela.\n\nJackman, François, Barbadian diplomat; son of Oliver Jackman. He has been ambassador to China (2018-21) and permanent representative to the United Nations (2021- ).\n\nJackman, Henry N(ewton) R(owell), also called Hal Jackman (b. June 10, 1932, Toronto, Ont.), lieutenant governor of Ontario (1991-97).\n\nJackman, Oliver (Hamlet) (b. Aug. 10, 1929, Black Rock, St. Michael parish, Barbados - d. Jan. 24, 2007, Bridgetown, Barbados), Barbadian diplomat. He was permanent representative to the United Nations (1969-71), high commissioner to Canada (1971-75), ambassador to the United States (1977-81) and Belgium (1981-84), and UN secretary-general's personal representative on the border controversy between Guyana and Venezuela (1999-2007).\n\nJackson, Alphonso (Roy) (b. Sept. 9, 1945, Marshall, Texas), U.S. secretary of housing and urban development (2004-08). He resigned while under pressure by Congress to answer questions about charges of political favouritism. A federal lawsuit accused Jackson, the former head of the housing authority in Dallas, of using his influence at HUD to punish the Philadelphia Housing Authority after it refused to transfer a $2 million property to one of Jackson's business friends. He was also reported to be under investigation by the FBI, Justice Department, and a federal grand jury for making comments in 2006 in which he said he arranged the firing of a contractor who did not like Pres. George W. Bush.\n\nA. Jackson\n\nJackson, Andrew, byname Old Hickory (b. March 15, 1767, Waxhaws region, South Carolina - d. June 8, 1845, the Hermitage, near Nashville, Tenn.), president of the United States (1829-37). In 1796 he became a member of the convention that drafted a constitution for the new state of Tennessee. In the same year he was elected as the first representative from Tennessee to the national House of Representatives. He refused to seek reelection and served only until March 4, 1797. Jackson returned to Tennessee, vowing never to enter public life again, but before the end of the year he was elected to the U.S. Senate. He resigned from the Senate in 1798 after an uneventful year, though. Soon after his return to Nashville he was appointed a judge of the Superior Court (in effect, the supreme court) of the state and served in that post until 1804. During the War of 1812 (1812-15), he crushed the Creek Indians, who were allied with the British, and decimated an invading British army in the Battle of New Orleans. He led the invasion of Florida in the Seminole War of 1817-18, and after Spain was forced to cede the territory, he was commissioner of Florida in 1821. These military triumphs led to suggestions that he become a candidate for president, but he at first disavowed any interest. In 1823 the Tennessee legislature elected him to the U.S. Senate. In the election of 1824 Jackson received the highest number of votes, but no majority of the electoral votes, and the House of Representatives chose John Quincy Adams. In 1828 Jackson defeated Adams by an electoral vote of 178 to 83 after a campaign in which personalities and slander played a larger part than in any previous national election in the history of the United States. He was the first U.S. president to come from the area west of the Appalachians and the first to gain office by a direct appeal to the mass of voters. He was reelected in 1832.\n\nJackson, Charles (b. March 3, 1797, Providence, R.I. - d. Jan. 21, 1876, Providence), governor of Rhode Island (1845-46).\n\nJackson, Claiborne F(ox) (b. April 4, 1806, Flemingsburg, Ky. - d. Dec. 6, 1862, Little Rock, Ark.), governor of Missouri (1861); cousin of Hancock Lee Jackson.\n\nJackson, Ed(ward L.) (b. Dec. 27, 1873, Howard county, Ind. - d. Nov. 18, 1954, Orleans, Ind.), governor of Indiana (1925-29).\n\nJackson, Elihu E(mory) (b. Nov. 3, 1837, near Salisbury, Md. - d. Dec. 27, 1907, Baltimore, Md.), governor of Maryland (1888-92).\n\nJackson, Sir Francis Walter Fitton (b. 1881 - d. May 17, 1936), senior political officer of British Togoland (1919-20); knighted 1936. In Gold Coast he was chief commissioner of the Northern Territories (1930-33) and Ashanti (1933-36).\n\nJackson, Frank Darr (b. Jan. 26, 1854, Arcade, N.Y. - d. Nov. 16, 1938, Redlands, Calif.), governor of Iowa (1894-96).\n\nJackson, Sir Frederick (John) (b. Feb. 17, 1860, Catterick, Yorkshire, England - d. Feb. 3, 1929, Beaulieu-sur-Mer, Alpes-Maritimes, France), acting commissioner of the British East Africa Protectorate (1904, 1905) and governor of Uganda (1911-18); knighted 1913. He was also known as an ornithologist.\n\nJackson, Hancock Lee (b. May 12, 1796, near Richmond, Madison county, Ky. - d. March 19, 1876, Salem, Ore.), acting governor of Missouri (1857).\n\nH.M. Jackson\n\nJackson, Henry M(artin), byname Scoop Jackson (b. May 31, 1912, Everett, Wash. - d. Sept. 1, 1983, Everett), U.S. politician. A powerful and influential Democratic representative (1941-53) and senator (1953-83) from Washington, he became an outspoken supporter of military preparedness, organized labour, and civil rights. A titan in the Senate, Jackson won six elections decisively and was regarded as the nucleus of those Democrats who viewed themselves as neoconservatives (liberals in domestic policy but hawkish in foreign policy). Because he persisted in trying to win military contracts for Boeing (his state's largest employer), Jackson was dubbed \"the senator from Boeing.\" Despite two unsuccessful bids for the presidency, first in 1972 and again in 1976, Jackson's political strength was great and undisputed. He served as a senator under seven presidents. He took part in the Army-McCarthy hearings in 1954, and sharply criticized the \"witch hunts\" of that era. He was selected by Pres. John F. Kennedy to head the Democratic National Committee (1960-61), forced the Nixon administration to alter the SALT I agreement, forced through legislation in 1974 that pressured the Soviet Union into allowing Jews to emigrate, and was one of the major architects of the landmark 1969 National Environmental Policy Act. Jackson, who was the ranking Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, was perhaps best known as the most vocal Democratic skeptic with regard to the Soviet Union. Hours before his death from a massive heart attack, Jackson had denounced the Soviet Union for downing a commercial airliner carrying 269 civilians.\n\nJackson, Sir Henry Moore (baptized Aug. 13, 1849, Barbados - d. Aug. 29, 1908, London, England), commissioner of the Turks and Caicos Islands (1885-90) and governor of the Leeward Islands (1901-02), Fiji (1902-04), and Trinidad and Tobago (1904-08); knighted 1899.\n\nJackson, Jacob B(eeson) (b. April 6, 1829, Parkersburg, Va. [now in W.Va.] - d. Dec. 11, 1893, Parkersburg), governor of West Virginia (1881-85).\n\nJackson, James (b. Sept. 21, 1757, Moreton Hampstead, Devonshire, England - d. March 19, 1806, Washington, D.C.), governor of Georgia (1798-1801).\n\nJ. Jackson\n\nJackson, Jesse (Louis) (b. Oct. 8, 1941, Greenville, S.C.), U.S. politician. Becoming involved in the black civil-rights movement, he went to Selma, Ala., in 1965 to march with Martin Luther King, Jr., and became a worker in King's Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC). In 1966 he helped found the Chicago branch of Operation Breadbasket, the economic arm of the SCLC, and served as the organization's national director from 1967 to 1971. In 1971 he founded Operation PUSH (People United to Save [later Serve] Humanity), a Chicago-based organization in which he advocated black self-help and achieved a broad audience for his liberal views. He became a leading spokesman and advocate for black Americans in the 1980s. His voter-registration drive was a key factor in the election of Chicago's first black mayor, Harold Washington, in April 1983. In late 1983 he became the first black man to make a serious bid for the U.S. presidency. After calling for the creation of a \"Rainbow Coalition\" of Americans of all colours to unite against the Reagan administration, Jackson was overheard calling Jews \"Hymies\" and New York City \"Hymietown.\" The slur, and his failure for nearly two weeks to acknowledge it, virtually ruined his ability to appeal beyond black voters. He won about 3.2 million votes during the Democratic primaries. He made another unsuccessful attempt for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1987-88. In 1989 he took residency in Washington, D.C., and in 1990, when the Washington City Council created two unpaid offices of \"statehood senator\" - popularly called \"shadow senator\" - to lobby the U.S. Congress for statehood for the District of Columbia, Jackson won election to one of the posts, his first elective office. His son, Jesse Jackson, Jr., was a Democratic U.S. representative from Illinois (1995-2012).\n\nJackson, Lisa P(erez) (b. Feb. 8, 1962, Philadelphia, Pa.), administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (2009- ).\n\nM. Jackson\n\nJackson, Maynard (Holbrook, Jr.) (b. March 23, 1938, Dallas, Texas - d. June 23, 2003, Arlington, Va.), mayor of Atlanta (1974-82, 1990-94). In 1968, largely on impulse and admittedly as a kind of protest, he unsuccessfully challenged Herman Talmadge, Georgia's incumbent U.S. senator, in the Democratic primary. A year later he organized a serious and victorious campaign for vice-mayor of Atlanta. In 1973 he ran for the office of mayor and won (defeating Sam Massell), becoming the first black man to hold office as chief executive of a major southern U.S. city. He challenged Atlanta's white leadership establishment and often clashed with the business community. He was reelected to a second term in 1977. A series of 28 unsolved murders and disappearances of young blacks in Atlanta, beginning in 1979, brought the city worldwide publicity. Since the victims were all black, the murders became a racial issue with some blacks convinced that the killer was white. Jackson tried to keep Atlanta calm while the police hunted for the killer. On June 21, 1981, Wayne Williams, a 23-year-old black freelance photographer, was arrested and charged with the murder of Nathaniel Carter, 27, one of the 28 victims. Jackson, who could not by law seek a third consecutive term, backed Andrew Young, also black, who won a runoff election for mayor in 1981. Jackson returned to seek a third term in 1989. He was elected with 80% of the vote and was instrumental in Atlanta's successful effort to host the 1996 Summer Olympic Games. In 2001, he made a bid for the chairmanship of the Democratic National Committee, but withdrew from the race against Terry McAuliffe. He was then named chairman of the DNC's Voting Rights Institute and was heavily involved in the fight for election reform.\n\nJackson, (Gordon) Noel (b. Dec. 25, 1913 - d. Sept. 13, 1999), British political agent in Kuwait (1944-45, 1949) and political officer in the Trucial States (1947-48). He was also ambassador to Kuwait (1963-67).\n\nJackson, Rashleigh E(smond) (b. Jan. 12, 1929, New Amsterdam, British Guiana [now Guyana] - d. Sept. 1, 2022, Georgetown, Guyana), foreign minister of Guyana (1978-90). He was also permanent representative to the United Nations (1973-78).\n\nJackson, Sir Richard (Leofric) (b. July 12, 1902, India - d. Feb. 17, 1975), president of the International Criminal Police Organization (1960-63); knighted 1963.\n\nJackson, Sir Richard Downes (b.

Feb. 13, 1892, Spring Creek, Pa. - d. Oct. 9, 1954, Washington, D.C.), U.S. solicitor general (1938-40) and attorney general (1940-41).\n\nJackson, Sir (Francis) Stanley (b. Nov. 21, 1870, Chapel Allerton, near Leeds, England - d. March 9, 1947, London, England), governor of Bengal (1927-32); knighted 1927.\n\nJackson, Sir Wilfrid Edward Francis (b. 1883, St. John's, Newfoundland - d. March 28, 1971, Cape Town, South Africa), governor of Mauritius (1930-37), British Guiana (1937-41), and Tanganyika (1941-45); knighted 1931; son of Sir Henry Moore Jackson.\n\nJackson, Sir William (Godfrey Fothergill) (b. Aug. 28, 1917, Blackpool, England - d. March 12, 1999), governor of Gibraltar (1978-82). He was commissioned into the Royal Engineers in 1937. In World War II he served in Norway, North Africa, and Italy. After the war he was posted to the Far East. From 1948 to 1950, he was an instructor at the Staff College, Camberley, after which he became a company commander at Sandhurst (1951-53). Next came a posting as second-in-command of the Royal Engineers 7th Armoured Division in Germany, and a spell at the War Office where he helped plan the Suez invasion. From 1958 to 1960, he commanded the Gurkha Engineers in Malaya. From 1973 to 1976 he was quartermaster general. As governor, he proved a doughty defender of the Gibraltarians' interests, invariably referring to the Rock's inhabitants as \"we.\" While he could not prevent Lord Carrington concluding an agreement with the Spaniards in 1980, which opened the door to talks about the colony's future, he was delighted the next year to welcome the prince and princess of Wales to Gibraltar on their honeymoon - a plan which had caused King Juan Carlos to boycott the royal wedding. During the Falklands War, Jackson had the delicate task of misleading the Spanish authorities about British strength and intentions, knowing that the Spaniards were in contact with the Argentine government. This did not prevent him, later in 1982, from stamping firmly on the notion that a Spanish admiral might be allowed to fly his flag in Gibraltar after Spain had joined NATO. After retiring from the governorship, Jackson continued to defend Gibraltar's cause in the press. \"It will take several generations,\" he wrote, \"to expunge the depth of anti-Spanish feeling generated over the last half a century.\" He was knighted in 1971.\n\nJackson-Nelson\n\nJackson-Nelson, Marjorie, née Jackson (b. Sept. 13, 1931, Coffs Harbour, New South Wales), governor of South Australia (2001-07). Dubbed the Lithgow Flash, she became the first Australian woman to win an Olympic track and field gold medal, winning the 100 m and 200 m at the 1952 Helsinki Games. She broke 10 world sprint records during her career, was inducted into the International Hall of Fame for Women in 2000, and was named as one of the 200 greatest Australians during the 1988 Bicentenary year.\n\nJacob, Eduard Herman s' (b.

Aug. 19, 1993, Damascus, Syria), Syrian politician. In the 1950s, by then an army officer, he joined the Ba`th Party, which was banned at the time. He was promoted to major general in 1963 and named chief of staff of the Syrian armed forces. With Hafez al-Assad, he led a coup in February 1966 that ousted the more moderate Ba`th leadership. For the next four years, although he held only a party post, Jadid was the effective leader of Syria. In September 1970 he sent armoured troops to Jordan in support of Palestinians fighting King Hussein and unsuccessfully tried to persuade Assad, who commanded the air force, to provide cover. When the Syrian forces suffered defeat, Assad had Jadid arrested. A man of strict principle, Jadid remained defiant, and he spent the remaining 23 years of his life under arrest, making him one of the world's longest-held political prisoners.\n\nM.

Aug. 29, 1960, Radès, Tunisia), justice minister of Tunisia (2021- ). She was also minister of state domains and land affairs (2020-21).\n\nC. Jagan\n\nJagan, Cheddi (Berret) (b. March 22, 1918, Plantation Port Mourant, British Guiana [now Guyana] - d. March 6, 1997, Washington, D.C.), president of Guyana (1992-97). He was elected to the British Guianan legislature in 1947. In 1946 he, his wife Janet, and other politicians had set up the Political Affairs Committee, which in early 1950 evolved into the People's Progressive Party (PPP), with himself as leader. In elections held in April 1953 under a new British-granted constitution, the party won 18 of the 24 seats in the House of Assembly and Jagan became chief minister and minister of agriculture, lands, and mines. His subsequent program of radical socioeconomic reforms led the British - acting at the behest of the United States - to dismiss him from office on Oct. 9, 1953, suspend the new constitution, and send in troops. Jagan and a number of prominent Guyanese were jailed, ostensibly for defying a colonial order restricting movement. In 1955 the PPP split along racial lines, with most of its black members seceding under Forbes Burnham to form the People's National Congress (PNC) and its members of East Indian descent, like Jagan, remaining in the ranks. The PPP won the 1957 elections, and Jagan pursued moderate policies of socioeconomic reform as the new government's minister of trade and industry (there was no prime ministerial position). In the 1961 elections the PPP emerged with a slim majority, and Jagan became premier and minister of development and planning. His term was marred by a long general strike and by serious rioting. He served as leader of the parliamentary opposition from 1964 and was the PPP's general secretary from 1970. After the PPP won general elections in 1992 he finally became president of Guyana. Long an outspoken Marxist, he now supported free-market economic policies. He died in office.\n\nJ. Jagan\n\nJagan, Janet (Rosalie), née Rosenberg (b. Oct. 20, 1920, Chicago, Ill. - d. March 28, 2009, Georgetown, Guyana), president of Guyana (1997-99). In 1942, she met Cheddi Jagan in Chicago, where he was studying dentistry. The following year they were married and returned to Georgetown in what was then the colony of British Guiana. By 1950 they had both become active in politics, and during that year they joined with Forbes Burnham to found the People's Progressive Party. She became the party's first secretary general, a post she held for 20 years. When Cheddi Jagan headed the government, Janet served in the parliament and was minister of labour, health, and housing (1957-61) and home affairs (1963-64). Having been stripped of her U.S. citizenship in 1947 (nominally because she had voted in local elections in British Guiana), Jagan in 1966 officially became a citizen of Guyana. Cheddi became president in 1992 and died in 1997. She then became prime minister. Hesitant at first to run for the presidency, she accepted her party's nomination on Aug. 31, 1997, in order to carry forward her late husband's agenda. Her main opposition came from People's National Congress leader Desmond Hoyte. When she was sworn in, she made history on two fronts - becoming the first elected female president in South America and the first white president of Guyana. Following the election, hundreds demonstrated in the capital, Georgetown, charging her with fraud and an inability to lead the country on the grounds that she was not a natural-born citizen and was too old. An independent audit of the results by a Caribbean Community team found no evidence to support the fraud charges, but Hoyte's supporters protested so vehemently that, in an effort to quell the unrest, Jagan and Hoyte reached an agreement to hold new elections in 2000. She resigned due to ill health in 1999.\n\nJagat\n\nJagat, Gurbachan (b. June 1, 1942), governor of Manipur (2008-13) and Nagaland (2009).

Jan. 23, 1964, Unity Village, East Coast Demerara, British Guiana [now Guyana]), president of Guyana (1999-2011). The Moscow-educated economist became finance minister in 1995. He was the architect of a key debt relief program granted to Guyana by multilateral organizations. He was sworn in as president, becoming the youngest head of state in the Americas, after Janet Jagan resigned because of poor health. The main opposition People's National Congress (PNC), which claimed Jagan's 1997 election was fraudulent, said it would not recognize Jagdeo's administration. The ruling People's Progressive Party (PPP), of which Jagdeo had been an activist for years, was generally supported by Guyanese of Indian descent. Guyanese of African descent traditionally backed the PNC. Jagdeo was expected to maintain the free-market economic policies of Jagan, who named him as her successor after suffering a mild heart attack. Describing himself as \"an emissary of renewed hope,\" he said he brought to his office \"no hang-ups from the past.\" Saying economic growth was one of his main goals, he promised to offer \"a more confident environment for investors.\" His appointment required some unusual political manoeuvring. Under the Guyanese constitution, the prime minister is next in line when the president falls ill. Prime Minister Sam Hinds resigned to make way for Jagdeo - who could then become president and in turn reappointed Hinds as premier. In 2020 Jagdeo became vice president under President Irfaan Ali.\n\nJager, Jan Kees de, byname of Jan Cornelis de Jager (b.

His first senior position came in 1977 as leader of the AUF, the Labour Party's youth league. In 1981, the year Gro Harlem Brundtland first became prime minister, Jagland was busy building a power base in the party. He turned down a golden chance to work in Brundtland's office in 1986 as a junior minister, saying he needed time with his children - a typical feature of Norway where eight out of 10 men use their right to take paid paternity leave. In 1992, he was voted in as party leader following Brundtland's resignation from the post after her son committed suicide. Brundtland had initially wanted Jens Stoltenberg as party leader and heir-apparent, but Jagland won out because he was supported by the trade unions, traditional and powerful allies of the Labour Party. The following year Jagland took over as parliamentary representative for the county of Buskerud. Brundtland announced in October 1996 that she was resigning as prime minister to give Jagland and the Labour Party time to prepare properly for the next election in September 1997. As prime minister, he argued for creation of a \"Norwegian House\" built on social justice, strong state participation in the economy, concern for the environment, and closer ties with international organizations. But at the 1997 elections, he said Labour was fed up with sniping and gave an ultimatum: Labour would quit unless it matched its 1993 result of 36.9% of the vote. Voters seized the chance and dumped Labour, giving it 35%. He quit as shadow premier in February 2000 in favour of Stoltenberg, causing Labour's popularity to leap from 30 to 38% in one opinion poll. He was foreign minister in 2000-01 under Stoltenberg, who succeeded him as party leader in 2002. In 2005-09 he was president of the Storting (parliament) and in 2009-19 secretary-general of the Council of Europe.

He was an employee of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia (1958-63), chairman of the Central Administration for the Development of a Communal Economy (1963-66), deputy minister of the interior (1966-68), and chairman of the party's Central Control and Auditing Commission (1968-77). After the Soviet invasion of 1968 ended the \"Prague Spring,\" it was his commission that reviewed what party members had done during the \"crisis period.\" Thousands were expelled. In 1977 he joined the Central Committee and became chairman of its Committee on Agriculture and Food. He increased food production by promoting entrepreneurship without ending planning. As chairman of the National Economic Committee (1981-87), by contrast, he supervised a stagnant national economy. On Dec. 17, 1987, the Central Committee elected Jakes to the most important job in the party, that of secretary-general. On Oct. 10, 1988, Jakes announced the resignation of Lubomír Strougal as prime minister and as a member of the Presidium, the inner circle of party leaders. Although Jakes had kind words for Strougal, Western observers believed that the two had been rivals for years. Both had achieved prominence after the Soviet invasion. Neither wanted anything like a repetition of the \"Prague Spring\" experiment, but Strougal, in 1987, had worked with economists on a policy of reduced economic planning and greater reliance on market forces. Jakes resisted Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev's policies of glasnost (openness) and perestroika (restructuring).\n\nJakeway, Sir (Francis) Derek (b. June 6, 1915 - d.

Sept. 15, 1934, Lanett, Chambers county, Ala.), governor of Alabama (1979-83, 1995-99). In 1978, following a switch from the Republican to the Democratic Party, James entered the gubernatorial race and won. He did not run for reelection in 1982, when George Wallace won his last term. He again switched parties on April 8, 1994, ran as a Republican and won reelection on Nov. 8, 1994. Even in Alabama, which has a reputation for electing controversial governors, James was a standout. He once did an ape imitation as a way of mocking the theory of evolution in an appearance before the state Board of Education. In 1997, he announced he would call out the National Guard if necessary to defend the right of a state judge to display a wooden tablet of the Ten Commandments on the wall of his courtroom. In a protest against federal court rulings prohibiting organized prayer in public schools, James argued that the U.S. Supreme Court had no jurisdiction over Alabama. James' stands prompted conservative business interests to back businessman Winton Blount in the Republican primary for governor in 1998. Blount branded James as an \"embarrassment.\" James called Blount a \"fat monkey\" and handily won with 56% of the vote. James lost, however, to Democrat Don Siegelman in the general election. One single issue dominated the race - Siegelman's proposal to establish a state lottery to raise education standards. In a state increasingly dominated by Republicans, Siegelman managed to drive a wedge between the evangelical Christians who regarded James as a hero, and more business oriented voters who believed the colourful governor was harming the state's reputation and slowing its development.\n\nJames, Sir Frederick Seton (b.

He joined what was then the Gambia National Gendarmerie in 1984 and was promoted from private to sergeant two years later. He transferred to The Gambia National Army and was commissioned in 1989. He attended the Military Police Officers Basic Course at Fort McClellan, Ala., U.S., and obtained a diploma in military science in 1994. Jammeh served under various units in The Gambia National Army. From 1984 to 1986 he was in the Special Intervention Unit, 1986-89 in the Gendarmerie Training School (Escort Training Instructor), 1989-90 Presidential Guards (in charge of Presidential Escort); in 1991 he served as officer commanding in the Mobile Gendarmerie and in 1992 was officer commanding The Gambia National Army Military Police, until July 22, 1994, when the army toppled Pres. Sir Dawda Jawara in a bloodless coup and he became chairman of the Armed Forces Provisional Ruling Council. At the time Jammeh was a lieutenant. In 1994, he was promoted to the rank of captain and in 1996 to the rank of colonel. Jammeh retired from the army in 1996. After a two-year transitional period constitutional and civilian government was restored. He won presidential elections on Sept. 26, 1996. Reelected in 2001, 2006, and 2011, he somewhat surprisingly lost to Adama Barrow in December 2016. Initially accepting the result, he later attempted to cling to power and Barrow had to be sworn in (Jan. 19, 2017) in Senegal. Regional neighbours as well as the wider international community supported Barrow, and Senegal sent troops over the border to remove Jammeh; he flew into exile on January 21.\n\n1 He identified himself as Sheikh Professor Alhaji Dr. Yahya Abdul-Azziz Jemus Junkung Jammeh Babili Mansa, the last two words (meaning \"chief bridge builder\" or \"conqueror of rivers\") being adopted in August 2014, dropped in December, then added again in June 2015, while the religious title \"Naasiru Deen\" that had been added March 1, 2011, was dropped in October 2014.\n\nJamoussi, (Mohamed) Karim (b.

March 13, 1944, Du [now in Plateau state], Nigeria), governor of Plateau (2007-15).\n\nJang Bahadur Rana, Jang also spelled Jung, original name Jang Bahadur Kunwar (b. June 18, 1817, Kathmandu, Nepal - d. Feb. 25, 1877, Patharghatta, Bhagalpur district, Bihar, India), prime minister of Nepal (1846-56, 1857-77). A man of great courage and ability, Jang Bahadur gained control over the government after killing a usurper, Gagan Singh, who in 1846 had plotted with the junior queen to become prime minister and place her son on the throne. Subsequently, he deposed and exiled both the king and the queen after they had attempted to have him assassinated. He was named prime minister for life and given the hereditary title of Rana. His diplomatic skill and conciliatory policy helped Nepal remain independent while the rest of the Indian subcontinent came under British rule. During the Indian Mutiny of 1857-58 he sent a contingent of Gurkha soldiers to aid the British, thus establishing a tradition of Gurkha military service in the British army. He also did much to improve and modernize the administration of the country and revised the old penal code. Although he attempted to abolish suttee, three of his widows immolated themselves on his funeral pyre. Once he was appointed hereditary prime minister, he believed it essential for the security of the state that he should be succeeded by a fully adult and capable man. Accordingly, he devised an order of succession by means of which the office passed not from father to son but rather from brother to brother within the family. In the second generation it passed to the sons of all his brothers in order of age and in a similar manner in succeeding generations. At his death Jang Bahadur was thus succeeded by his younger brother Ranaudip Singh. The office of prime minister remained in the Rana family until 1951. The Rana family continued, however, to remain extremely powerful.\n\nJangali, Ali Ahmed Jama, Somali Cali Axmed Jaamac Jangali, foreign minister of Somalia (1990, 2008-09, 2009-10).

Jan. 12, 2012, Sioux Falls, S.D.), governor of South Dakota (1979-87, 1995-2003). Probably no governor in South Dakota's history had as great an impact as Republican Janklow; yet he remained as controversial in victory as in defeat. He started off as a lawyer on a Sioux Indian reservation. Then, elected attorney general in 1974, he reacted sharply to the militants' uprisings of 1975, insisting that the law be enforced. Elected governor in 1978, he got Citibank into the state - the first of many credit card operations - and set the state on a low-tax course. Reelected in 1982, he ran for the Senate in 1986, and lost the primary 55%-45% to the inarticulate but personally popular incumbent Sen. Jim Abdnor. The new governor, Republican George Mickelson, was proud of his revolving economic development fund, financed by a temporary one-cent sales tax increase, to attract jobs and industry. Mickelson died in a plane crash in 1993, and was succeeded by Walter Dale Miller, a rancher from near Rapid City who served 20 years in the legislature and six as lieutenant governor. Janklow challenged him in the 1994 Republican primary and won by 54%-46%, carrying most of eastern South Dakota and losing much of the west. In the general election he won easily, 55%-41%, over Jim Beddow, the former president of Dakota Wesleyan University. Feisty and sometimes abrasive, Janklow's critics said he ran state government like a dictator. But he pledged to keep South Dakota's economy strong and to be tough on crime and drug abuse, and was reelected in 1998. In 2002 he was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives. On Aug. 29, 2003, he was charged with second-degree manslaughter after an accident in which his speeding car hit and killed a motorcyclist; he was convicted on December 8.\n\nJankovcová, Ludmila (b.

Nov. 3, 1934, Nieuwer-Amstel, Noord-Holland, Netherlands - d. June 9, 2002, The Hague, Netherlands), Dutch politician. He was on the rightist fringe of Dutch politics. His views that the overcrowded Netherlands had no room for foreigners and that refugees should be sent back to their countries of origin were contrary to the country's generous open-door policy. He founded the Central Democratic party in 1984, which won its first seats in parliament in 1989. Its best result was in 1994, gaining 3 of the 150 seats. One was filled by Janmaat's wife Wil Schuurman, who lost a leg in a bomb attack by leftist radicals at a party meeting in 1986. Janmaat left politics in 1998 after his party lost all its seats. He said a comeback was hopeless, accusing the media and the Dutch security service of working against him. He was convicted several times on discrimination charges, most recently in 1997 for advocating an end to the Dutch multicultural society.\n\nJanot, Raymond (b. March 9, 1917, Paris, France - d.

He was a deputy prime minister and minister-head of the Office of Scientific and Technical Progress and Implementation (1989-91).\n\nJans, Beat (b. July 12, 1964, Basel, Switzerland), president of the government of Basel-Stadt (2021-23) and justice minister of Switzerland (2024- ).\n\nJansa\n\nJansa, Janez, byname of Ivan Jansa (b. Sept. 17, 1958, Ljubljana, Slovenia, Yugoslavia), prime minister of Slovenia (2004-08, 2012-13, 2020-22). In 1988, he became a popular figure after the Yugoslav army arrested him with three other political dissidents, accusing them of divulging state secrets. The fact that the case (widely known in the former Yugoslavia as the JBTZ case) was heard in an army court and in Serbo-Croatian triggered the first mass demonstrations in Ljubljana in the Communist era, showing in the process that the notion of an independent Slovenia was more popular than some in the Communist leadership had realized. In 1990, Jansa became defense minister in the first Slovenian independent government. He set up the Slovenian army, which in 1991 proved strong enough to withstand attack by the JLA, the ex-Yugoslav army. He was defense minister until 1994, when his career came to an abrupt end after army officials beat up an employee of the Interior Ministry. Even if the circumstances are still blurred, it was clear that the interior and defense ministries were surveying each other. Jansa was held responsible for the incident and dismissed by Prime Minister Janez Drnovsek. In 1993 Jansa became chairman of the Social Democratic Party (SDS). He was again defense minister in 2000. In the 2004 elections, the SDS (renamed Slovenian Democratic Party in 2003) managed to overturn ten years of nearly unbroken dominance by the Liberal Democratic Party (LDS) by increasing its vote from 16% in 2000 to 29%. In 2008 the SDS again won 29% but went into opposition as the Social Democrats were able to form a coalition. Jansa's popularity had been eroded by a rising cost of living and a corruption allegation. Critics also claimed that he had assumed too much power, controlling police, the judiciary, and the media, thereby endangering democracy. After snap elections in 2011, he managed to assemble a five-way coalition and return to head the government, contrary to the will of Pres. Danilo Türk, who rejected giving him a mandate to form a government. Accused by the anti-corruption watchdog in January 2013 of tax irregularities, and struggling to implement austerity measures to combat the country's financial crisis, he was ousted in a no-confidence vote in February after smaller parties left his coalition. He was given a two-year jail sentence for bribery the same year, but the conviction was later overturned by the Constitutional Court. In 2020 he returned to power at the head of a four-party coalition. An ally of Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orbán, he pushed a hard line on immigration. He was defeated in 2022 elections.\n\nJansen, Ernest George (b. Aug. 7, 1881, Strathearn, near Dundee, Natal [now KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa] - d. Nov. 25, 1959, Pretoria, South Africa), governor-general of South Africa (1951-59).\n\nJansen, Geert (Jan) (b.

March 3, 1944, Buchenwald concentration camp, Germany), defense minister (1920), justice minister (1927-31, 1932-34, 1939, 1940), prime minister (1937-38), and foreign minister (1939) of Belgium. He was elected to the Chamber of Deputies in 1910. After the German invasion of Belgium in 1914, he played an important part in the rehabilitation of his country and in the care of refugees. He became more prominent in politics and was a delegate to the League of Nations (1926-29). A leading member of the Liberal Party, he formed a cabinet in November 1937 consisting of Catholics, Socialists, and Liberals. During his tenure as premier, he met determined opposition from the Catholic deputies, who demanded that he cut expenditures by reducing his program of social reforms. The Socialists, however, urged more spending and new taxation. Caught between the conflicting demands, his government fell in May 1938. After the German invasion of 1940 he escaped to France, but was arrested by the Germans there in 1943, and was imprisoned at Fresnes before being transferred to the Buchenwald concentration camp in Germany where he died.\n\nJanssen, Albert-Edouard (Marie Henri) (b.

In the 2020 post-election protests he was freed from prison, then designated prime minister, and the Supreme Court overturned his sentence, granting a review of the case.

A member of the centre-right Social Democratic Party elected repeatedly since 1978, his popularity grew along with Madeira's economy, as he used its status as an autonomous region to tap into extensive subsidies from Lisbon and the European Union and lavishly extend the island's infrastructure, including a number of wasteful \"white elephant\" projects. He resigned in 2007 to protest the Portuguese government's 2007 budget, which reduced funding for the islands; he was then reelected with his largest-ever margin.

In 2014 he announced his retirement.\n\nJardim, Eugênio Rodrigues (b. Oct. 6, 1856, Goiás, Goiás, Brazil - d.

He progressed rapidly, rising to the rank of brigadier general by 1950. In 1944 he joined what effectively was the Communist Party, and he was deputy premier (1952-70) and minister of mining (1954-56). He joined the party's Politburo in 1964 and became a full member three days before his appointment as premier in 1970. He implemented the policies of Edward Gierek, first secretary of the Polish United Workers' (Communist) Party; their government policies led to a crippled economy, huge price increases, and long lines for goods. The strikes and unrest that followed gave rise to the Solidarity trade union movement. Jaroszewicz was made a scapegoat, and he was dropped from the Politburo and forced to resign from office in 1980. He and Gierek were expelled from the party the following year. In 1992 Jaroszewicz and his wife were found murdered in their home; he had been tortured and strangled, and she had been shot.\n\nJarpa Reyes, Sergio Onofre (b. March 8, 1921, Rengo, Chile - d.

He became French national motorcycle-racing champion in the 500cc category in 1937 and co-holder of the world 24-hour endurance title in 1938. Captured by German troops in June 1940, he soon escaped and bicycled his way across half of France to return to his native Burgundy, where he started organizing escape circuits. Involved in some of the first clandestine arms drops to the Resistance by the British Special Operations Executive (SOE), he was arrested by the Germans in January 1942. Released for lack of evidence, he walked over the Pyrenees to Spain where he was imprisoned for five months. When he finally reached Britain, he was trained as a secret agent and parachuted into occupied France on several sabotage missions. Awarding him the coveted Cross of the Liberation, Gen. Charles de Gaulle wrote that Jarrot's actions \"seriously harmed German industries on French soil.\" He was also decorated by Britain, the United States, and Belgium. After the war, he was regional head for Bourgogne of the Rally of the French People (RPF) movement created by de Gaulle to bring him back to office. When the general did return to power in 1958, Jarrot was elected to parliament on a Gaullist slate and reelected in 1962, 1967, 1968, and 1973. A member of the European Parliament from 1962 to 1974, he was minister for the quality of life from 1974 to 1976 before serving in the Senate from 1986 to 1995.\n\nJärta, Hans, original name (until 1800) Hans Hierta (b.

July 6, 1923, Kurow, Poland - d. May 25, 2014, Warsaw, Poland), premier (1981-85), chairman of the Council of State (1985-89), and president (1989-90) of Poland. When World War II broke out, he and his family were trapped by the invading Red Army, and he was deported to the Soviet Union. In 1943 he joined the Polish army formed in the Soviet Union under Gen. Zygmunt Berling. He joined Poland's Communist party (later renamed the Polish United Workers' Party [PUWP]) in 1947 and steadily rose through the ranks of party and army, becoming a brigadier general at the early age of 33. He was elected a member of the party's Central Committee in 1964 and became a member of the Politburo in 1971. Having been deputy minister of defense since 1962, he was appointed minister of defense in March 1968. As Poland came under increasing pressure from the Solidarity movement, he was elected premier on Feb. 11, 1981, and first secretary of the party on Oct. 18, 1981, while retaining his post as minister of defense. In an effort to crush the Solidarity movement and restore Poland's economic stability, he declared martial law in Poland on Dec. 13, 1981; the move was accompanied by mass arrests of Solidarity leaders and political dissidents. With Solidarity suppressed, he lifted martial law in July 1983. In 1988 he approved negotiations between the government and the outlawed Solidarity movement. These talks culminated in April 1989 in an agreement providing for far-reaching reforms in Poland's political system, notably the legalization of Solidarity and the holding of free elections to a restructured parliament. He was elected president by the parliament in July 1989 and then resigned all his high posts in the PUWP. He faced trial in 2001, accused of giving the orders for the army to open fire on protesters in 1970.\n\nJärventaus, Jussi (Arvi) (b.

Feb. 15, 1939, Saint-Gilles [now in Brussels-Capital region], Belgium), prime minister of Belgium (1926-31). Entering politics in the Catholic Party, he was made minister for economic affairs in November 1918, on the conclusion of World War I, and reorganized industry and commerce with considerable success. In 1919 he became deputy for Liége. In the following year he left the Ministry of Economic Affairs to become interior minister and, later, foreign minister (1920-24). In the latter capacity he facilitated Belgium's entry into the League of Nations and also the country's representation at the Permanent Court of International Justice at The Hague. He helped create the customs union of Belgium and Luxembourg in 1921, and in 1924 he took part in the Dawes Plan negotiations, which enabled Germany to resume reparations payments to the Allies. In May 1926 he was called on to form a ministry of national unity. His cabinet included representatives of the three Belgian parties, Catholic, Socialist, and Liberal, and implemented a series of financial policies, designed by banker Emile Francqui, to remedy the economic crisis; these included devaluation of the currency, creation of new taxes, conversion of the public debt, nationalization of the railroads, and financing of public works. These measures revitalized the Belgian economy, although it declined again after the onset of the Great Depression in 1929. Jaspar later served as finance minister (1932-34) and again as foreign minister (1934). He was asked to form a new government in 1939 but failed owing to the refusal of the Socialists to collaborate; he died soon thereafter.\n\nJaspar, Marcel Henri (b.

Sept. 10, 1912, Savalgi, Bijapur district [now in Karnataka], India - d. June 7, 2002, Bangalore [now Bengaluru], Karnataka), chief minister of Mysore (1958-62), lieutenant governor of Pondicherry (1968-72), governor of Orissa (1972-74), and vice president (1974-79) and acting president (1977) of India. During the movement for independence from Britain, he was active in an underground network of saboteurs in southern India. In 1943 he became a member of the municipal council of Jamkhandi, a tiny princely state, and was eventually appointed its chief minister on the eve of India's independence. After the linguistic reorganization of Indian provinces, he entered the cabinet of Mysore's chief minister, S. Nijalingappa, as health and labour minister. Endearing himself to Jawaharlal Nehru and Indira Gandhi at the national level, Jatti was able to steal a march over other Congress leaders in the state and became chief minister in 1958. When Nijalingappa returned as chief minister in 1962, Jatti took the unusual step - in the Indian context - of rejoining his cabinet as an ordinary minister. By far the most controversial turn in an otherwise placid political career came when Jatti became acting president of India in 1977, and had to preside over Gandhi's electoral defeat at the hands of the Janata Party. The new government was not comfortable with the continuance of Congress governments in the states. When the nine sitting Congress chief ministers refused to recommend dissolution of their legislatures, the national government advised Jatti to dismiss the state governments, but he demurred. Prime Minister Morarji Desai is said to have sent a terse message to Jatti with the ultimatum: \"Sign or resign.\" He had no option but to comply.\n\nJattin Corrales, Zulema (del Carmen) (b.
