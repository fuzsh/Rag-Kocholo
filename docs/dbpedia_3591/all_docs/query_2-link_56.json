        "text": "BAGHDAD, IRAQ - Of the thorny issues that drafters of Iraq’s permanent constitution tackled this week, one of the most fiercely debated is a tiny section that raises a big question: Who is an Iraqi citizen?\n\nPrime Minister Ibrahim al Jaafari is a British national; so are at least five of his Cabinet members. One vice president is French, the other is said to be Saudi. The speaker of the National Assembly is American, his No. 2 is Canadian and several legislators use travel documents from neighboring Iran.\n\nWith former exiles in the most powerful seats in Iraq, dual citizenship has become a sensitive topic colored by passionate disputes over allegiance.\n\nMembers of the drafting committee have locked horns over how the constitution should address the thousands of Iraqis who hold second or even third nationalities. Some members, particularly Sunni Arabs who stayed in Iraq under Saddam Hussein’s dictatorship, are concerned about divided loyalties and opportunistic exiles. Others, mainly Shiite Muslims and Kurds whose persecuted families fled Saddam’s Iraq, say the constitution must enshrine citizenship as a right for all Iraqis.\n\n“Most of the people ruling Iraq have dual citizenship,” said Hajim al Hassani, who spent 25 years in Connecticut and California before becoming speaker of Iraq’s parliament. “I am American. I am Iraqi. Of course, right now I live in Iraq and all my efforts are working toward rebuilding this country.”\n\nUnder Saddam, Iraqis weren’t allowed to hold other nationalities and those who opposed him or sought refuge abroad were stripped of citizenship. The interim law drawn up under the U.S.-led occupational authority allows for dual citizenship and restores Iraqi nationality to those who lost it under Saddam.\n\nSome members of the drafting committee want to extend citizenship to children born to Iraqi mothers and foreign fathers, non-Iraqi women married to Iraqi men and generations of Iraqi refugees who live in Iran. (Citizenship in the Arab world generally conveys through men.) A compromise in the works would grant those rights, as long as dual citizens in top government positions agreed to renounce their second nationalities.\n\n“Those sensitive positions cannot go to people with dual citizenship, but at the same time we can’t deprive those people of important positions,” said Homam Hamoodi, a Shiite and chairman of the committee. He spent years of exile in Iran, but said he held only Iraqi citizenship.\n\nLate Tuesday, members were still at an impasse on the emotionally charged issue. Dual citizenship is one of many controversial topics that have stalled talks and prompted worries that the committee won’t make its mid-August deadline."
