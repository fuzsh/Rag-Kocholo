        "text": "BAGHDAD, Iraq, May 8 - One of four Sunni Arabs picked over the weekend to join Iraq's new Shiite-controlled cabinet abruptly rejected the job today, saying he first learned of his selection from a television news report on Saturday night and adding that he felt his selection would further a quota system for Sunnis that would only make sectarian problems worse.\n\nThe political setback came as the United States military announced that insurgents had killed eight American servicemen over the weekend. In one ambush, insurgents took over a hospital in Haditha, a haven west of Baghdad for the militant leader Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, and killed three marines and one sailor. The American military also said it had captured the mastermind behind both the large-scale attack on Abu Ghraib prison one month ago and the wave of car bombs that killed 40 Iraqis in greater Baghdad on April 29.\n\nIn the capital, the National Assembly approved six new cabinet ministers today, including the unwilling candidate, Hashim al-Shibli, who had been named human rights minister. But on a day when Prime Minister Ibrahim al-Jaafari had hoped to finally complete his cabinet and put to rest contentious political battles that delayed his government, the rejection dealt him another embarrassment.\n\nOne day earlier, Dr. Jaafari had declared at an afternoon news conference that all six names had already been approved by President Jalal Talabani and his two vice presidents. But Mr. Shibli, in an interview, said he did not formally learn that he had been picked until just before the confirmation vote today, leading him to believe his selection was more symbolism than substance.\n\n\"I heard about it watching TV,\" Mr. Shibli said. \"No one talked to me or asked me about it before. This morning they called me and tried to congratulate me in my 'new job,' but I said no. I refused this because this is sectarianism, and I don't believe in sectarianism. I believe in democracy.\"\n\nInsurgents have killed more than 300 people since Dr. Jaafari announced the majority of his cabinet 11 days ago, including more than 200 Iraqi police and troops. American and Iraqi officials say the attacks have been coordinated to undermine confidence in Dr. Jaafari's new administration as it tackles a revolt fought largely by Sunni Arabs loyal to Saddam Hussein, who favored Sunnis and brutally oppressed the Shiites and Kurds who dominate the new government. Sunni Arabs largely boycotted the Jan. 30 election, but some Sunni political leaders say they are angered by their limited role in Dr. Jaafari's new government.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
