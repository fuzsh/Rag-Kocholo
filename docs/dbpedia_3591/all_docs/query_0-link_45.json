        "text": "Home > News & Policies > November 2003\n\nFor Immediate Release\n\nNovember 3, 2003\n\nLiberation Update\n\nNews accounts are painting vivid pictures of the joy and relief of free Iraqis, who are living without fear of Saddam's brutality and beginning to enjoy freedoms unknown for decades. These voices have been silenced for too long, but now they are heard inside Iraq and around the world. For more personal stories of life under Saddam, visit Tales of Saddams Brutality.\n\nVOICES OF FREEDOM\n\nThe best thing about life now is freedom. You can say anything, go anywhere.\n\n--Haider Kadhim, internet-café consultant from Basra, Time, November 10, 2003\n\nWe made sacrifices for this freedom. [Freedom will last] forever, I think. And itll be better after a month, and after a year, much better. I think so.\n\n--Ayad Abdul Kareem Muhssin, who lost his newborn daughter after his wife went into premature labor during the bombing of Baghdad, Time, November 10, 2003\n\nIn the central market [of Amarah in southern Iraq] merchants cant remember a time when business was better. The main reason is the dramatic rise in disposable income now that the coalition is paying public employees $60 to $180 a month. Before the war, teachers earned $5 to $10, policemen $20.\n\n--Terry McCarthy, Time, November 10, 2003\n\nThere is lots of construction now. Before we couldnt even bring in a single bag of cement.\n\n--Salam Nissan Shamoun, Iraqi postmaster, Time November 10, 2003\n\nNow you dont need money to get a doctor. Now the doctors are honest.\n\n--Hassan Mahmoud, who had to bribe doctors, nurses, and administrators to care for his injured son under Saddam, Time, November 10, 2003\n\n\" There is lots of opportunity, lots of money in the markets.\n\n--Sa'ad Basim al-Izzi, Iraqi pharmaceuticals and medical appliances dealer, The Boston Globe, November 2, 2003\n\nThe borders are open, there is no Ministry of Health bureaucracy to negotiate, and no duties. Salaries are much better. Before, salaries were so low, people sold their furniture. But now there is free trade, and we buy and sell what we like.\n\n--Sa'ad Basim al-Izzi, pharmaceuticals and medical appliance dealer, who recently was able to purchase a bed, The Boston Globe, November 2, 2003\n\nUnder Saddam, the wealth of Iraq was spent on guns and other weapons. Now, God willing, this money will be spent on the welfare of our people.\n\n--Jamal Hameed Ali, animal merchant in Baghdad, The Boston Globe, November 2, 2003\n\nThe once-dingy [Baghdad] school has received a remake courtesy of the occupation, making a true believer of Hadia Mohammed Kidaier, 50, its principal. They plastered and painted. They rebuilt the bathrooms. They're putting in water coolers, she said. New furniture, blackboards, and textbooks have been promised.\n\n--Charles A. Radin, The Boston Globe, November 2, 2003\n\nOf course, the school is nicer now, and my cousins at the [nearby] Yemen School received a bag of notebooks and pencils and pencil sharpeners from the Americans. They say we will, too.\n\n--Shafak Salah, an Iraqi fifth-grader at the Al Wihda al Arabia public primary school, The Boston Globe, November 2, 2003\n\nWe are taking the highest security levels today and we will not be lazy about doing our duty. It's true that we are threatened, targeted to be hit at any moment, but this will not prevent us from coming to our ministry and doing our job. We will not sit in our houses.\n\n--Ameen Khazaal Khalif, Iraqi Police First Lieutenant, Knight Ridder Newspapers, November 2, 2003\n\nThey [terrorists] just want us to stop the rebuilding in Iraq.\n\n--Bashar Salim Mahmoud, Iraqi barbershop owner, responding to terrorist threats against Iraqi merchants and government employees, Knight Ridder Newspapers November 2, 2003\n\nWe will never close. Here in Kadhimiya market, the security is very good. We are not worried.\n\n--Ali Jawad, owner of the a jewelry store, after terrorists threatened the lives of Iraqi merchants who remained open for business, The Philadelphia Inquirer, November 1, 2003\n\nAfter the Americans arrived, we were very proud to be policemen. We worked very hard.\n\n--Mudhaffar Mozan, Iraqi warrant police officer whose police station doubled the number of officers since before the war and set up an emergency hotline for residents of the neighborhood, The Washington Post, November 1, 2003\n\nI chose right in coming here. We need the safety. We need freedom.\n\n--Ahmed al-Naseri, a resident of Tikrit, while waiting to receive an identity card from U.S. troops attempting to keep dangerous outsiders from entering the city, The Associate Press, November 1, 2003\n\nThings are getting better in a visible way, day by day.\n\n--Ali al-Sharif, Iraqi restaurant manager, The New York Times, October 27, 2003\n\nWe used to be very constricted. Now we are finally free to fulfill the duties which religion demands of us.\n\n--Talib Jasim al-Jassiri, Iraqi Shiite leader who is now has more freedom to practice his religion, Deutsche Presse-Agentur, October 27, 2003\n\nOne time they [Baathist officials] fired my entire staff. I had to close. This doesn't happen anymore . . . we are free from pressure now.\n\n--Yossif Abod, candy store owner who was forced to fire southern Iraqis by government security officials during Saddam, The New York Times, October 27, 2003\n\nBefore the trial was a parody. Someone would come into the court connected with the [Baathist] regime and [government officials would] say it was better not to sentence him.\n\n--Varrack Bassam, assistant Iraqi judge, who now enjoys freedom from the state when sentencing criminals, The New York Times, October 27, 2003\n\nI was being forced to serve in Saddam's army. If I'd deserted they would have tortured me. God, I hated it.\n\n--Ahmed al-Dhim, Iraqi date salesman, whose business is booming with the beginning of Ramadan, Christian Science Monitor, October 27, 2003\n\nOne time they [Baathist officials] fired my entire staff. I had to close. This doesn't happen anymore ... we are free from pressure now.\n\n--Yossif Abod, candy store owner who was forced to fire southern Iraqis by government security officials during Saddam, The New York Times, October 27, 2003\n\nWe feel safe when we see the patrol coming.\n\n--Suhab Jumaa, who serves as a live-in caretaker for an Iraqi school guarded by Coalition forces, Copley News Service, October 25, 2003\n\nI am happy to hear the news. Hopefully I can reach Karrada street (a busy commercial center) on the other side of the river in 15 minutes.\n\n--Ibrahim Abdullah, after the last closed bridge in Baghdad was opened to traffic by Coalition Provisional Authority, Xinhua News Agency, October 25, 2003\n\n\"Iraq has made many new friends in the last few days. The pledges we have had today will help us get back on our feet. They represent a huge investment by the international community in Iraq.\n\n--Ayad Allawi, President of the Iraqi Interim Governing Council, after receiving donations from the international community at the Madrid conference, Agence France Presse, October 25, 2003\n\n\"You can wander anywhere in Karbala today, and you will not see a rifle. Most of us have no problem with the coalition here.\n\n-- Lt. Col. Rassaq Abid Ali, Iraqi police chief in Karbala, Iraq, The Los Angeles Times, October 22, 2003\n\nYou're our heroes. You're our heroes!\n\n-- A crowd of Iraqis in a Baghdad tea shop, cheering for Iraqi police in search of kidnappers, Agence Free Press, October 21, 2003\n\nIt is the first Ramadan celebrated in freedom.\n\n-- Sheikh al-Araji, a Shiite cleric, who, like all Shiites, was not allowed to celebrate the Muslim holy day under Saddam, Agence Free Press, October 21, 2003\n\nSecurity has improved by 60 percent, he [Mohammed Hayawi] said somewhat arbitrarily. He makes six, maybe seven times more money than he did two months ago, selling long-banned books from Lebanon and Iran. The Americans deserve some credit, he said, but Iraqis deserve far more, their resilience honed by decades of hardship.\n\n-- Anthony Shadid, in an interview with Mohammed Hayawi, Baghdad bookstore owner, The Washington Post, October 22, 2003\n\nWithin two to six months, US soldiers should be positioned at their bases outside the cities and the [Iraqi] police would call on them if they need help.\n\n-- Ibrahim Junbari, aid to Iraqi Governing Council President, Agence Free Press, October 21, 2003\n\nI wanted to do something good for Iraq.\n\n-- Tahir al-Shamri, 27, a trainee in the new Iraqi Civilian Defense Corp which will provide internal security to Iraq, Associated Press, October 20, 2003\n\nWe are exporting 1 million barrels [of oil] a day, and it will be double that by the end of the second quarter of next year. It will be 6 million barrels a day by the end of the decade. We have the human resources in Iraq to achieve that, and the international investment will also be there.\n\n-- Ibrahim Bahr al-Uloum, Iraqi oil minister, The Houston Chronicle, October 19, 2003\n\nThis city in southern Iraq [Nasiriyah] saw some of the fiercest fighting of the U.S.-led war to oust Saddam Hussein. Yet today the most visible uniform here is not military, but the bright blue overalls of new municipal workers on an urban beautification project. Life, residents say, is getting better.\n\n-- Tyler Marshall and John Daniszewski, The Los Angeles Times, October 19, 2003\n\nNearly everywhere, Iraqis said delivery of essential services such as electricity, potable water and emergency health care is gradually improving. Gas station lines have shortened, more members of the coalition-trained Iraqi police are on the streets, courts have begun operating, and schools have reopened  many refurbished and newly equipped. Fledgling media have sprouted in many communities, and local and provincial governing councils have started work.\n\n-- Tyler Marshall and John Daniszewski, The Los Angeles Times, October 19, 2003\n\nI hope women will have a good future in Iraq. They are tired, they are sad, they are trapped in the house . . . We have a lot of women who are educated, active, who quit college because society was so repressive. Now they are coming back.\n\n-- Munther Gorbas Hussein, 45, who attended a meeting of the League of Iraqi Women, a womens rights group, with his wife, The Miami Herald, October 19, 2003\n\nWhen they say it's an occupation, I say, and why wasn't Saddam? I get frustrated with that. Every day without Saddam is a blessing. I think I can speak for Iraqis on that. Impatience is going to do us injustice.\n\n-- Ban Saraf, Iraqi-American who is teaching Iraqis about town hall democracy, Christian Science Monitor, October 8, 2003\n\nWe have a circulation of 50,000 in Baghdad, another 15,000 in Basra, each edition carrying 12 pages of foreign and Arab news and eight of local news. It's good to feel like a real journalist at last.\n\n-- Saad al-Bazaz, editorial supervisor of the Baghdad newspaper Az-Zaman, The Independent (London) October 7, 2003\n\nFrom our perspective, we are so excited the United States went in and are trying to help the Iraqi people. The majority of Iraqis are very happy that Saddam Hussein is out of there.\n\n-- Basila Sulaka Graham, Iraqi Chaldean American who immigrated to the United States at the age of seven, Desert News (Salt Lake City, Utah), October 7, 2003\n\nUntil now, we were denied mobile phones. Iraqis will welcome the chance to use mobile phones to talk to their families, friends and for business.\n\n-- Haider Jawad al-Aubadi, Iraqi Communication Minister, after contracts were award to cellular phone providers, Associated Press, October 6, 2003\n\nPraises be to God, it's finally safe to come out again.\n\n-- Haider Saffa, Iraqi tool salesman who is now free to speak his mind at a Baghdad café without fear of Saddam informers, Christian Science Monitor, October 6, 2003\n\nThey've got more Iraqis out on the streets as police now, and that's making a difference. We've got to return to a normal life.\n\n-- Haider Saffa, Iraqi tool salesman, who now stays out until the extended midnight curfew in Baghdad, Christian Science Monitor, October 6, 2003\n\nWhatever bad thing you heard [about life under Hussein] multiply it by 10. Those of you who lived outside cannot possibly fathom what we went through living under his rule.\n\n-- Yaser, Iraqi tourism agent, Washington Post, October 5, 2003\n\nBefore the war, the main [race horse] track in Baghdad was run as a private club by a group of Saddam's cronies. Today, the crowd is much more eclectic, some Iraqis said, with Arabs in traditional robes, Shias in Iraqi dress and men dressed like American racetrack touts milling about. One group was missing. There were no American soldiers who had been providing security at the track until recent days. Now, Iraqi policemen were watching.\n\n-- Micheal Hedges, The Houston Cronicle, October 5, 2003\n\nThe streets of Baghdad, Basra and Mosul bustle with commerce. Restaurants are filled late into the night as the heat of summer abates along with the fear of crime. Schools, many refurbished with the help of Americans, reopened last week. New textbooks, cleansed of Saddam Hussein's image, are being printed. The curfew has been extended an hour, until midnight.\n\n--Patrick Tyler, New York Times, October 5, 2003\n\nNow we are savouring freedom.\n\n-- Rajaa al-Khuzai, member of Iraqi Governing Council, Agence France Presse, October 2, 2003\n\nBefore we write as they tell us, now we write what we believe. I feel I am happier now. I am now really a journalist. For 27 years I was working, but now its very different.\n\n-- Nada Shawket, writer at Azaman Newspaper, FOX News, October 1, 2003\n\nThings are getting better day by day.\n\n-- Chato Mohammed, manager of Victory Theater in Baghdad, Associated Press, October 1, 2003\n\nShe was supposed to draw a line through a photograph of Saddam to show the printer what to remove. But when she put her pen at the corner of the picture she couldn't bring herself to make the line. I said, Don't be afraid, bring the line down. She went halfway and stopped.

This is the first time in decades that Iraq's Shiites have been free to commemorate the death of Imam Hussein, grandson of the prophet Muhammad.\"\n\n-- Orlando Sentinel April 22, 2003\n\n\"It was a great day...I never thought I would have this freedom.\"\n\n-- Lt Sadeq Abdul Mohsen, deserted from Iraqi 63rd Infantry Brigade, Newsweek, April 21, 2003\n\n\"I was afraid when I saw my city again, I would die of happiness...this is the first day of my life.\"\n\n-- Ahmed Yassin Hamakarim upon return to Kirkuk, which his family had fled 15-years ago, U.S. News and World Report, April 21, 2003\n\n\"We need a natural life, a democratic life, like in any other country...when I came into Baghdad, I saw the ruins, but I also saw something else: freedom. We can be free.\" -- Asad Quasi, a militia member, Washington Post, April 17, 2003\n\n\"Iraq has just emerged from a nightmare that lasted 35 years. The problems that Iraq has suffered under the rule of Saddam's regime cannot be eliminated in one or two days. Iraqis must hold several meetings until they agree on what they deem appropriate for the establishment of an interim government representing all Iraqi factions and capable of preparing a permanent constitution top be submitted to the people through a public referendum before the nature of [the next] government could be agreed. This requires a long time.\"\n\n-- Muhammad Bahr-al-Ulum, Egyptian Radio, April 16, 2003\n\n\"I am ready to help. Thank you for liberating Iraq and making it stable, I hope we have a very good friendship with the United States.\"\n\n-- Iraqi General Mohammed Jarawi to US Colonel Curtis Potts after signing the surrender in western Iraq, Gold Coast Bulletin (Australia), April 16, 2003\n\n\"A good leader can bring many things to Iraq.

They may take some time getting used to it, but I can see it happening.\"\n\n-- Tahani Hanna, 18 year old Iraqi expatirate, The Standard (St. Catharines), April 16, 2003\n\n\"The people of Iraq do not want Islamic rule. For 35 years we have lived with no freedom, and these religious leaders are not offering us freedom.\"\n\n-- Taleb, Theater Director in Nasiriyah, London Daily Telegraph, April 16, 2003\n\n\"I can't express my feelings. All I feel is joy. This is the first time I've seen this (Shiite celebrations) for 30 years. Saddam forbade everything. He forced us underground.\"\n\n-- Sami Abbas, a Shia at the holy shrine of Kadhimiy, Washington Post, April 16, 2003\n\n\"'Under Saddam, we were not allowed to have beards,' as he fondly rubs a week's growth of stubble on his chin. 'This was just one more rule against the Shiite.'\"\n\n-- Feraz Hasan, Iraqi merchant, Toronto Star, April 16, 2003\n\n\"As I drove into Basra, an ebullient crowd on a truck was dragging a statue of Saddam Hussein through the streets. When people saw me pull out my camera, they began cheering and whacking Saddam's face. 'Thank you, Mr. Bush,' one called out in English, and it was delicious to watch this celebration of newfound freedom.\"\n\n-- The Gazette (Montreal, Canada), April 14, 2003\n\n\"Storming the Al-Salam Presidential Palace, the looters marveled bitterly at Saddam's life of luxury as they passed shards of crystal from chandeliers and shattered mirror"
