After the Third Dynasty of Ur collapsed ca. 2002 BCE, Ishbi-Erra (an official of Ibbi-Sin, the last king of the Ur), relocated to Isin ((modern city of al-Diwaniyah) and set up a government which purported to be the successor to the Ur dynasty. From Isin, Ishbi-Erra recaptured Ur as well as the cities of Uruk and Lagash, which Larsa was subject to. Subsequent Isin rulers appointed governors to rule over Lagash; one such governor was an Amorite named Gungunum. He eventually broke with Isin from ruler; Lapit-Ishtar and established an independent dynasty in Larsa.\n\nAbisare.................................................1905 - 1894\n\nSumuel..................................................1894 - 1865\n\nNur-Adad (Contemporary of Sumulael of Babylon)..........1865 - 1849\n\nSin-Iddinam S/o Nur-Adad................................1849 - 1842\n\nSin-Eribam..............................................1842 - 1840\n\nSin-Iqisham S/o Sin-Eribam (Contemp. of Zambiya of Isin)1840 - 1835\n\nSilli-Adad..............................................1835 - 1834\n\nWarad-Sin...............................................1834 - 1822\n\nHe is Possibly co-regency with his father Kudur-Mabuk.\n\nRim-Sin I...............................................1822 - 1763\n\nBrother of Warad-Sin.

He continued to be viewed as cruel and his reputation was not helped when he fought and eventually crushed a Kharijite rebellion under Abdur-Rahmān ibn Muhammad ibn al-Ash'ath from 699-701. For his considerable successes, al-Ḥajjāj was also made governor of some provinces in Persia, where he was again tasked with putting down rebellions. However, his severe tactics led him to make many enemies, who would come to power after his death. With the ascent of al-Walid, Hajjāj's reputation grew due to the selection and deployment of numerous successful generals who expanded the empire. He was given these powers due to his high status in the Umayyad government and he exhibited a lot of control over the provinces that he governed. Among these generals was the teenaged Muhammad ibn-Qasīm, who in 712 was sent to Sindh in Pakistan. Qutayba ibn Muslim was sent to conquer Turkestan, which he did. Al-Ḥajjāj's most successful general was Mūsā ibn Nusayr, who consolidated control over North Africa and sent Tariq ibn Ziyād to invade Spain. The year after al-Ḥajjāj died, al-Walid died as well, and his brother Sulayman ibn Abdi l-Malik came to power. Sulayman was indebted to many opponents of al-Ḥajjāj for their political support in getting him elected Caliph, so he recalled all of al-Ḥajjāj's generals and had them tortured to death in prison.\n\nSulayman ibn Yazi...................................714 - 715\n\nYazid ibn al-Muhallab...............................715 - 721\n\nMaslama ibn Abdulmalik..............................721 - 722\n\nUmar ibn Hubayra....................................722 - 724\n\nKhalid ibn Abdallah al-Qasri........................724 - 738\n\nYusuf ibn Umar......................................738 - 744\n\nMansur ibn Djumhur........................................744\n\nAbdallah ibn Umar...................................744 - 747\n\nYazid ibn Omar......................................747 - 750\n\nKhalid ibn Abdallah al-Qasri..............................750\n\nDaud ibn Ali..............................................750\n\nIsa ibn Musa........................................750 - 764\n\nIn 762 Baghdad was founded as the capital of the Abbasid Caliphs.\n\nABBASID\n\nThe capital of the Caliphs was transferred to the newly built city of Baghdad, in central Mesopotamia.

Buwayhids were quietly able to assume real power in the bureaucracy at Baghdad. The Buwayhids, who were Shi'ites, seized power over Baghdad in 945 CE by Ahmad Muizz al-Dawla, They ruled central Iraq for more than a century. Despite the power of the Buwayhid amirs, the Abbasids retained a highly ritualized court in Baghdad, as described by the Buwayhid bureaucrat Hilal al-Sabi', and they retained a certain influence over Baghdad as well as religious life. The caliph al-Qadir, for example, led the ideological struggle against the Shia with writings such as the Baghdad Manifesto. All the autonomous provinces slowly took on the characteristic of de facto states with hereditary rulers, armies, and revenues and operated under only nominal caliph suzerainty, which may not necessarily be reflected by any contribution to the treasury.
