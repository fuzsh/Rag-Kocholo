        "text": "BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) — Shiite lawmakers Sunday chose incumbent Ibrahim al-Jaafari to be Iraq's new prime minister, taking a key step in forming a government nearly two months after national elections, officials said.\n\nAl-Jaafari is assured the post because Shiites won the most parliament seats in the Dec. 15 national elections. He won 64 votes in a caucus of Shiite legislators, one more than Vice President Adil Abdul-Mahdi, officials said. There were two abstentions.\n\nAfter parliament convenes within two weeks, members must choose the largely ceremonial position of president, who will then designate the alliance's choice as the new prime minister.\n\nAl-Jaafari's designation paves the way for the Shiite alliance to begin talks in earnest with parties representing Sunni Arabs, Kurds, secularists and others to try to form a broad-based government, which the United States hopes can calm the insurgency so American and other foreign troops can begin leaving.\n\nAttacks continued Sunday, with at least four people killed and 20 wounded in a spate of blasts and shootings in Baghdad and north of the capital. Insurgents also fired a mortar into the heavily guarded Green Zone in central Baghdad, but there were no casualties.\n\nIraqi President Jalal Talabani, the head of the influential Kurdish Coalition, took little time in making demands on the makeup of the next government.\n\nTalabani told reporters that the Kurds would not support al-Jaafari and his Shiite coalition, the United Iraqi Alliance, if former premier Ayad Allawi's secularist Iraqi National List was not included in the Cabinet.\n\n\"I stressed to the American ambassador on the necessity of forming a national unity government in which no one will be excluded, especially (Allawi's) Iraqi List,\" Talabani told reporters after meeting U.S. envoy Zalmay Khalilzad. \"The Kurdish Coalition will not take part in the coming government unless the Iraqi List takes part in it.\"\n\nSeveral senior Shiite politicians have said they opposed Allawi — a secularist who has good relations with the U.S. government — taking a prominent role in the next government.\n\nAllawi has been touted as a possible replacement for Interior Minister Bayan Jabr, a Shiite bloc member accused by Sunni Arabs of directing Shiite-led security forces to kill and kidnap members of the Sunni Arab community.\n\nJabr denies the claims. Shiite leaders, who were long suppressed by Saddam Hussein's security forces, have vowed to take control of the interior and defense ministries, which run the police and military.\n\nAfter winning the vote Sunday, al-Jaafari said the Shiite coalition will hold talks with others \"based on the grand interests of Iraq.\"\n\nDrive-by gunmen killed Education Ministry official Karim Selman al-Zaidi in Baqouba, 35 miles northeast of Baghdad, Diyala police's Joint Coordination Center said.\n\nA suicide attacker detonated his explosives-packed belt in western Baghdad's Baiyaa district near a police patrol, killing an elderly woman and a policeman and wounding seven people, police said.\n\nAnother group of armed men in a speeding car fired at two men in a truck in Baghdad's southern Dora neighborhood, killing one and seriously wounding the other, police said.\n\nA bomb rigged to a motorcycle exploded shortly before 7 a.m. outside a local restaurant near central Baghdad's Tahrir Square and wounded nine people, police said. A roadside bomb wounded four policemen near a northern Baghdad mosque.\n\nPolice also found the bodies of at least five men who had been bound, repeatedly shot and dumped in different parts of Baghdad.\n\nMeanwhile, an explosion in the insurgent stronghold of Ramadi, west of Baghdad, wounded two civilians and damaged eight shops, witnesses said. The cause of the blast was unknown.\n\nAl-Jaafari, a physician and member of the Islamic Dawa Party, spent years in exile in Iran and Britain before returning to his homeland after the U.S.-led coalition ousted Saddam Hussein in 2003.\n\nHis government, which took office in April 2005, had been widely criticized for failing to improve the country's crumbling infrastructure or deal effectively with the Sunni-led insurgency. Al-Jaafari's supporters had complained of infighting within the Shiite alliance that dominated the outgoing government.\n\nThe British military police, meanwhile, opened an investigation into a report by the tabloid News of the World newspaper claiming to have received video footage allegedly showing British troops using their fists and batons to beat a group of young Iraqis in 2004.\n\nFlight Lt. Chris Thomas, a British spokesman in the southern city Basra, said the allegations involve only a small number of British troops in Iraq and expressed hopes the claims would not affect relations between coalition soldiers and Iraqis.\n\n\"We condemn all acts of abuse and brutality,\" he said. \"We hope that the good relations that the Multi-National Forces have worked very hard to develop won't be adversely affected by this material.\"\n\nThomas said the allegations relate \"to only a tiny number of the 80,000 (British) personnel that have served in Iraq\" since the 2003 U.S.-led invasion. Britain currently has 8,000 troops in Iraq, mostly in Basra.\n\nThe Sunday newspaper said the video was filmed in 2004 by a corporal who urged the soldiers on during the alleged attack. The paper claimed the tape was passed on by a whistleblower, whom they have refused to identify.\n\nIt was unclear how news of the video would affect relations between British troops and civilians in southern Iraq. Those ties have come under strain recently, with some Iraqi officials complaining about British detentions of local policemen linked to numerous kidnappings and killings, as well as British security control over Basra International Airport.\n\nThe U.S. military, meanwhile, said a 53-year-old Iraq detainee died Saturday after being assaulted by several detainees in western Baghdad's Abu Ghraib prison. A military criminal investigation was underway."
