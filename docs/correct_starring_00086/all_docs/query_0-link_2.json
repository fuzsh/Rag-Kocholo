        "text": "After months of Dan Aykroyd sifting around in the empty “Ghostbusters” sandbox, promising every and any random person of an eventually awesome third installment, finally some word from another cast member has arrived. Rick Moranis, who left the acting spotlight to raise his family and start a music career, is back with a new album, and during its promotion gave a brief update on the sequel’s ever-diminishing chances of actually happening.\n\nMoranis chatted to Empire on the occasion of his newest musical effort, My Mother’s Brisket & Other Love Songs, and during the interview, he said he hadn’t talked yet to Aykroyd about the film, but remains open to the idea. “Somebody [Dan] is associated with called me and I said, ‘I wouldn’t not do it, but it’s got to be good,’ he explained. “You know, I’m not interested in doing anything I’ve already done, and I thought the second one was a disappointment.”\n\nNevertheless, Moranis still has some interest in where Louis Tully — his sheepish lawyer-turned-Ghostbuster character — will return in the threequel, which Aykroyd has revealed to involve dangerous particle physics research. “I sort of see him as being Bernie Madoff‘s cellmate in jail. Both of them being so orderly that they race to get up and make their beds.”"
