        "text": "Director: Ivan Reitman\n\nCast: Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Harold Ramis, Ernie Hudson, Rick Moranis, Sigourney Weaver, Annie Potts, David Margulies, Peter MacNicol, and Wilhelm von Hamburg\n\nRating: PG\n\nRuntime: 108 Minutes\n\nBy Adam Long\n\nGreetings nerds and nerdettes!!! Following up of our Retro Review of Ghostbusters from last week is our review for Ghostbusters II. In our previous Retro Review, we at NerdPop! stated that “from the combination of the cast, the writing, the chemistry, and the special effects, I give Ghostbusters a solid Great–Add It to the Classics! rating. To me, it was just a well, put-together film for its time, and is an example of how to do a comedic film right.”\n\nSo, how does Ghostbusters II stack up against its predecessor? Why don’t we dive into the ectoplasmic details and find out!\n\nGHOSTBUSTERS II: THE SEQUEL THAT COULD HAVE USED SOME TWEAKING\n\n(Bill Murray, reprising his role as Dr. Patrick Venkman)\n\nNow, before I get into the nitty-gritty, I do want to give respect where respect is due; I want to thank Dan Aykroyd, Harold Ramis, and Ivan Reitman for returning to write and direct the sequel to the successful and classic Ghostbusters. Because of these three principle people’s roles, the sequel felt authentic and was a solid next entry in this sci-fi comedic franchise. The humor is still intact–like Venkman (Murray)’s statement about it being a “bummer” that the world was supposed to end on February 14, 2016 (and surprise, we’re all still here!) , along with the comments to the mayor about how “I’m a voter. Aren’t you supposed to lie to me and kiss my butt?”\n\nBut, in comparison to the first film, Ghostbusters II suffers from having attentive focus. In my opinion, I felt that the sequel spent a lot more time in the characters’ domestic lives than focusing on the ghosts, or ghost hunting, in general. Personally, I felt the film should have focused a little more on the ghost hunting like in the first film.\n\nSecondly, I felt that this film drags on longer than the first–it felt like it took too long to get the Ghostbusters back together, along with building the main villain of the film, Vigo the Carpathian.\n\nAnd those are pretty much the only negative detractors in Ghostbusters II–if the pacing and buildup to Vigo were done better, Ghostbusters II would be a lot more closer to its parent in quality than it turned out being.\n\nTHE GHOSTBUSTERS’ CHARACTERS: STILL SOLID\n\n(From Left-to-Right: Sigourney Weaver as Dana Barrett, Bill Murray Dr. Patrick Venkman, Harold Ramis as Dr. Egor Spengler, Dan Aykroyd as Dr. Raymond Stantz, and Eddie Hudson as Winston Zeddemore)\n\nFor this film, most of the cast from the original film returned–which includes Bill Murray as Dr. Patrick Venkman, Dan Aykroyd as Dr. Ray Stantz, Harold Ramis as Dr. Egor Spengler, Rick Moranis as Louis Tully (now the Ghostbusters’ lawyer and a fellow Ghostbuster), Eddie Hudson as Winston Zeddemore, and Sigourney Weaver as Dana Barrett. And as in the previous film, they delivered solid performances as the characters they played.\n\nSet five years later after Ghostbusters, the story of Ghostbusters II revolves around Dana and her son, Oscar, who seem to still attract the paranormal. After the beginning scene of the film where Oscar, in a baby stroller, wheels away from Dana, and abnormally survives from being almost hit by several vehicles in the New York streets, Dana brings the abnormal situation to the attention of Egor and Ray. Ray still continues the Ghostbusters business with Winston, although since the final confrontation against Gozer in the first film, the Ghostbusters name has gone downhill. Ray and Winston still dress in their uniforms with their plasma packs and perform the Ghostbusters Theme Song at kids’ birthday parties. Ray’s main job is working with Egor, and as for Venkman…\n\nWell, Venkman is the host of a physic show.\n\nHowever, Dana’s concern for Oscar’s well-being (and the fact that both her and her son may be attracting the supernatural) cause Venkman and the other Ghostbusters to reunite, investigating paranormal activity, all leading to pink slime in the sewer that leads to one source–a possessed painting in the museum where Dana works at–a painting of Vigo the Carpathian–an evil spirit who wants to return to the living world to take it over. Of course, Vigo works to possess Oscar, so he can revive himself and go about terrorizing the world.\n\nThe cast reunites to continue their characters’ development in the sequel–through primarily, it is about Venkman and Dana getting together while he and the other Ghostbusters work to save New York again…despite the rest of the city’s wishes. Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Harold Ramis, Eddie Hudson, Sigourney Weaver, and Rick Moranis still pull out hilarious and endearing performances as their respective characters–and I was particularly surprised that Rick Moranis returned as Louis in Ghostbusters II–now as the Ghostbusters’ attorney–and later on, a fellow Ghostbuster himself. Moranis, as Louis, really shined in this movie, with his role as the lawyer in court, and when he and Janine (Annie Potts, also returning from the first film) have sex in Venkman’s apartment while they were supposed to be watching Oscar. It’s performances like Moranis’ and Murray’s which help keep Ghostbusters II as a solid sequel, preventing it from further sliding into a bad follow-up.\n\nNERDPOP! RATING\n\nSo overall, how does Ghostbusters II measure up against Ghostbusters?\n\nWell, in my opinion, the dragging of the film, along with the lack of attentive focus it has in comparison to the original prevents it from being a “Great–Add It to the Classics!” rating. I would give it more of a “Decent…Worth Seeing” Rating. If you care about the Ghostbusters world and its characters, then seeing Ghostbusters II is worth it if you want to see where those plots develop.\n\nHowever, if you expect the movie to be as high quality as its predecessor, then you’ll be disappointed–it’s a good film, but not GREAT, like Ghostbusters was. And that is how I feel about Ghostbusters II.\n\nWhat do you think of Ghostbusters II? Did you love it in comparison to the first Ghostbusters? Do you think it was terrible, or was it somewhere in-between? Stay glued NerdPop! fans, for we’ll also have a review for the Ghostbusters Reboot when it releases tomorrow–the review should be out over the weekend.\n\nSo stay tuned nerds and nerdettes–we’ll have more articles up soon!\n\nSource Links:\n\n(1) http://www.geeksofdoom.com/GoD/img/2016/07/ghostbusters-2-logo-530×227.jpg\n\n(2) https://extracapsa.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/img_0840.jpg?w=809\n\n(3) http://cdn.collider.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/ghostbusters-2-cast-weaver.jpg"
