        "text": "Rick Moranis is the actor who played Louis Tully in both Ghostbusters and Ghostbusters II.\n\nTelevision and Early Career[]\n\nRick Moranis got his start on the sketch comedy show SCTV. His most popular character was \"Bob\" of Bob and Doug McKenzie (with costar Dave Thomas).\n\nAfter his wife died of liver cancer in 1991, Moranis significantly reduced the amount of acting work he took until going into full hiatus in 1997, so that he could devote his time to raising their children. However, he has since stated that he is not averse to taking a role under the right circumstances.\n\nFilm Roles[]\n\nMoranis is well known for his roles in movies such as Honey, I Shrunk the Kids, Spaceballs, and Little Shop of Horrors.\n\nGhostbusters[]\n\nAfter John Candy ultimately passed on the role of Louis Tully, the script was sent to an agent who sent it to his client Rick Moranis who had been patiently waiting in the wings. Moranis helped tailor the character and came up with the idea for Louis to be an accountant.[1][2] Moranis improvised lines during the party scene.[3] He also suggested Louis' party for a scene right before principal photography started. Ivan Reitman decided to shoot the party as one long take to retain Moranis' comedic flow.[4] When Egon and Janine interviewed possessed Louis, the crew simply had Rick Moranis duck out and used a one of the rubber heads of a Terror Dog during the parts where the screen shows Vinz Clortho.[5]\n\nAfter Ghostbusters II[]\n\nRick Moranis was approached to reprise the role of Louis Tully for Ghostbusters: The Video Game. Bill Murray really pushed the game's development team to get Rick Moranis. Murray even directly called up Moranis.[6] He came around towards the end of production and was okay with being involved with the game. It so happened that his head was modeled and ready to go but there wasn't any manpower left to rig him in animation because everyone was working on finishing the cinematics. There was an idea of putting Louis in a fully body cast or making the area where the Ghostbusters II No Ghost sign, miniature satellite dish, and Ecto 1-a doors are stored Louis' office and just have Louis stick his hand out and play some recorded lines. Ultimately, Louis was written out of the game as being out on sick leave after returning home from scouting cities for new franchises.[7] Around 2009-2010, Moranis was contacted by an associate of Dan Aykroyd to work on another Ghostbusters movie.[8] He also passed on a cameo in the Ghostbusters (2016 Movie) because the role didn't appeal to him but in general he continues to be picky when it comes to a film or television role because.[9] Rick Moranis was approached to reprise Louis in Ghostbusters: Afterlife by Ivan Reitman before his passing and by others but he declined.[10]\n\nTrivia[]\n\nLouis Tully's glasses were auctioned off at a 1988 fundraiser in Toronto to benefit the Special Olympics.[11]\n\nOn the Regular Cover of Ghostbusters 101 #1, the map credit references Rick Moranis.\n\nThe Fire Goblins are visually based on the lead characters of \"Strange Brew,\" Bob and Doug Mckenzie, played by Dave Thomas and Rick Moranis.\n\nThe look of Louis Tully of Dimension 00-D is visually based on Moranis' Tom Monroe character from SCTV.\n\nOn page one of Ghostbusters Year One Issue #1, Louis' outfit is visually inspired by an outfit worn by Rick Moranis' character Billy Fish in the movie \"Streets of Fire\" which released on June 1, 1984, a week before Ghostbusters came out in theaters.\n\nOn cover B of Ghostbusters Year One Issue #4, the blue bottle and contents referencing Louis' brain sample question from the end of the first movie lists Louis's date of birth as 4/18/53, the same as Rick Moranis.\n\nReferences[]\n\nGallery[]\n\nBehind the Scenes[]"
