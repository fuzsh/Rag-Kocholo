        "text": "UPPER WEST SIDE, Manhattan -- An arrest has been made in a random and violent attack on actor Rick Moranis in New York City.\n\nPolice arrested Marquis Ventura on Saturday in connection with the attack.\n\nPolice say it was Ventura's seventh assault charge of the year.\n\nVideo showed the moment a man wearing a black \"I (heart) NY\" sweatshirt and a backpack hit the 67-year-old \"Ghostbusters\" star and knocked him to the ground.\n\nThe assault happened in late September on West 70th Street near Central Park West.\n\nThe attack happened just a few blocks from the apartment building where Moranis' character, Louis Tully, lived in the movie.\n\nThe attacker continued walking north after throwing the punch.\n\nArizona police looking into death of Lori Vallow's 3rd husband as she sits in Idaho jail\n\nMoranis hurt his head, back and hip in the attack but was able to take himself to the hospital, and later, to the police station to report the incident.\n\nMoranis' representative Troy Bailey said in a written statement after the attack: \"Rick Moranis was assaulted on the Upper West Side yesterday. He is fine but grateful for everyone's thoughts and well wishes.\"\n\nMoranis shot to fame in the 1980s as a star of the sketch comedy series \"Second City Television,\" before landing roles in blockbuster movies like \"Ghostbusters\" and \"Honey I Shrunk the Kids.\"\n\nHe put acting aside in the late 1990s to focus on raising his kids but has made occasional appearances since.\n\nFellow actor Chris Evans, who portrays Captain America in the Marvel movie franchise, reacted to the attack on Twitter."
