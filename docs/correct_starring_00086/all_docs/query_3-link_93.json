        "text": "This week on the good ol' Ghostbusters podcast, we're speculating on why Jason Reitman, Finn Wolfhard, Celeste O'Connor, and Logan Kim may have been recently on the Sony Pictures lot. And why was the Afterlife Ecto-1 spotted around Culver City? It was obvious they're creating something, but what? And if they are indeed picking up shots or reshooting for Ghostbusters Afterlife, what does that mean for the March 2021 release date? Also this week, Ross May of the Reitman for the Job podcast poses an interesting math question and Chris gets out the pencil and graph paper to check it out!\n\nAnd if you’d like to see the visual version of the podcast, check out our YouTube channel or the embed below!\n\nChris is working extremely hard on a special project to be unveiled next week, so this week you’re stuck with the single-voice ramblings of Troy as he drinks a Carthay Manhattan. Some of the topics of one-sided discussion this week include Sony Pictures Entertainment Chairman Tony Vinciquerra’s comments during a media conference about Sony’s release plans for 2020 and beyond - and how they were misconstrued by the internet, but what they may tell us could be in store come January/February of next year. Rick Moranis made a comeback (was he ever really absent in our hearts though) in a Ryan Reynolds commercial which was delightful, what could it mean for him stepping back in front of the camera in the future? All that and a whole lot of using this platform for rambling and long-winded therapy are in store, tune in! Baby steps!\n\nThis week on the show, Ghostbusters Italia Fan Films, Halloween Costumes, and what’s going to happen on Ghostbusters Day? First up, some news - Rick Moranis popped up on Disney+’s new show Prop Culture and what does it mean for Ghostbusters? Ghostbusters Italia debuted their fan film last weekend and Proton Charging had a little live viewing party. A few Halloween items are slowly starting to come out (but will Halloween be what we think it will this year?). Then in the second half of the show, the boys chat Ghostbusters Day 2020. June 8th of this year surely be a lot different than what the studio and the filmmakers may have had planned, what do we expect to happen? If anything? Tune in to find out!\n\nIt may not be for the movie franchise for which this podcast focuses but Rick Moranis is making a comeback, and this week we’re talking all about it. First up, Troy and Chris explore Moranis’ decision to return to acting for another Honey I Shrunk the Kids installment (and why didn’t he decide to give Ghostbusters Afterlife a go?). Then in the rest of the show, Bill Murray hits a ProAm, Carrie Coon and McKenna Grace get some press and are you ready for Toy Fair this week? We know we sure are!\n\nThis week is our 200th episode! Yeah, we can’t believe it either. After a quick update on the latest Fan Fest and Ghostbusters (2020) news, Chris and Troy take a walk down memory lane with some clips of their favorite episodes: Dan Aykroyd, Ivan Reitman, Rick Moranis, Michael C. Gross, Violet Ramis Stiel, Sean Bishop, Alex Langley, and a whole lot more are all here! Plus, you were all kind enough to send in some thoughts on your favorite episodes and themes throughout the years, so we have your well-wishes and voicemails too!\n\nThis week on the show, dissecting some of the comments made at this weekend's Wizard World Chicago panel with Ivan Reitman and Ernie Hudson. First up, a little discussion about the Supernatural mashup that happened during the show's hiatus, then the Wizard World Chicago announcements including ticket sale dates for Ghostbusters Fan Fest, some teases on what's to come and more. Then, a little discussion on a special someone else coming out of hiding to attend a convention in San Antonio. Could it be the start of a come back?\n\nThis week on the show, Guinness World Records are broken, Jan Vogler engages on Twitter and is the Ghostbusters music video canon? First up, the latest in news including a follow-up on last week's conversation about the 800 number at the time of the original film's release, Rick Moranis joining the SCTV reunion in Toronto, a group of fans breaking world records at a marathon in London, Forbes magazine talking about Real Ghostbusters Playmobil toys, Terminal Reality back in the news after shutting down back in 2013, and more. Then, in the second half of the show, we discuss a topic presented to us: given that the Ghostbusters theme song appears in Ghostbusters II, does that mean the music video from 1984 is canon? Stay tuned!\n\nGuys... this episode is ridiculously packed. This week, we're wrapping up all of this weekend's San Diego Comic-Con announcements, reveals, comments, questions, and more. Animated Movie in 2019? A live-action film coming in the near future? A Ghostbusters Answer the Call mini-series AND a TMNT/Ghostbusters crossover sequel from IDW? TONS of toys from Diamond Select. Blitzway's amazing 1/6 scale Ecto-1. Spirt Halloween costumes and proton packs... (take a breath) all of that PLUS a few other news items including the Toronto Second City return of Bob and Doug Mackenzie and more! Grab a snack, it's a long one!\n\nThis week on the show, we're giving you a two-hour stuffed episode to catch up on Ghostbusters Day 2017 and comments from Dan Aykroyd. You know, those comments. In the first half of the show, the boys talk excitement about the return of Bob and Doug (and Rick Moranis because of it) with a star-studded SCTV reunion fundraiser happening in Toronto, all of the Ghostbusters Day announcements that you may have missed in the chaos including Ivan Reitman's comments about the future of Ghostbusters, the reveal of Ghostbusters VR's second chapter, a slew of new merchandise and more. In the second half of the show, we unpack Dan Aykroyd's comments about Ghostbusters: Answer the Call on London's Sunday Brunch and the reaction those comments caused. Plus, we throw to your voicemails on the topic. Grab a snack, it's a long one!\n\nIn celebration of Rick Moranis' 64th birthday this past week, and his recent appearance watching the Rangers play the Canadiens in the playoffs, Chris has put together a little Rick Moranis appreciation reel for this week's show! (Plus, Troy's on a deadline for a book and is totally MIA, so Chris is stepping in to handle the show single-handed.) Grab a bottle of Elsinore and join us!\n\nThis week, two podcasts in one! It's a proper Crossrip and a Cylotron - the first in our series analyzing Ghostbusters: Answer the Call. Joining us in the Cyclotron this week are Paul Gannon (of the CheapShow Podcast) and Page Branson (of the Level 7 Access podcast) to talk about the story and the characters of the new Ghostbusters film. But before that, there's a little bit of news including a very special fundraiser underway to make little Braeden a Ghostbuster from the For the Win Foundation. Plus some merch round up news, a little box office discussion, and a look at Paul Feig's spoiler-heavy discussion with Empire Magazine.\n\nA brief tribute to a fallen friend Ryan Kemp by Chris, then the latest news, and an interview with Ryan Doell and IDW Comics artist Dan Schoening. This week's news in jam-packed because of the recent New York Comic-Con and all the announcements that came out of the Big Apple. And fittingly, it's double-stuffed to talk quite a bit about IDW's Ghostbusters Get Real and its conclusion. Also this week: brand new Ghostbusters shoes, Michael C. Gross Day and appreciation, that Rick Moranis interview that everyone is talking about, a new Paul Feig interview where he discusses casting Chris Hemsworth, LEGO Dimensions, Anovos is going to be selling Ghostbusters-related props, oh and there might be a Ghostbusters animated film in the hopper?\n\nGood day, and welcome to episode four. We are so unbelievably excited to welcome Rick Moranis as our first guest on the Ghostbusters Interdimensional Crossrip! After a brief discussion on the current news including the release of IDW Comics' \"Mass Hysteria\" hardcover, Paul Feig releasing the names of our four new heroes, and a little on some interesting prop building observations, Crossrip Co-Host Chris Stewart talks one-on-one with Moranis about why he took a hiatus from the film industry, the audition process for the first Ghostbusters, and a whole lot more."
