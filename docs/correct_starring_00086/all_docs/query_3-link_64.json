        "text": "Rick Moranis has finally broken a 13-year acting hiatus to star opposite Ryan Reynolds in a new commercial.\n\nOne of the biggest names in acting for a generation was Rick Moranis, so it's only natural that people of a certain age would 'fan-boy' over the return of the actor, albeit for a 30-second advertisement.\n\nStarring alongside Hollywood superstar Ryan Reynolds, Moranis stunned fans following a hiatus that spanned two-decade hiatus.\n\nFans are also excited to hear that, Moranis has signed on to reprise his role as Wayne Szalinski in Shrunk, a new sequel in the Honey, I Shrunk the Kids series. When completed, it will mark a return to live-action films for Moranis after a 23-year hiatus.\n\nYou can watch the acting stint below.\n\n\"So, what do you want me to do? You want me to say something about Mint?\" Moranis asks after Reynolds introduces him. \"I've really got to get a phone.\"\n\nReynolds later admits he simply brought Moranis into the fold because he's \"a huge fan.\" The two share an awkward stare before Moranis promptly exits.\n\nImage from Getty.\n\nMoranis had previously left his Hollywood life after the death of his wife, costume designer Ann Belsky in 1991. Moranis slowly withdrew from his acting career to focus on life as a single parent.\n\nIn the years since he has starred as a voice actor in a smattering of animated projects and TV specials, with his most recent on-screen acting role was in 2007, for the Bob & Doug McKenzie's Two-Four Anniversary TV special.\n\nImage from Getty.\n\nHe was perhaps best known for his roles in blockbusters including 'Ghostbusters', 'Honey, I shrunk the kids' and the Mel Brooks spoof 'Spaceballs'."
