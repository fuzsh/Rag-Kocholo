        "text": "It’s been 20 years since Rick Moranis last appeared onscreen, in the mind-bendingly titled “Honey, We Shrunk Ourselves.” A fixture of ’80s and ’90s blockbuster comedies, Moranis was beloved for his iconic roles in “Ghostbusters,” “Spaceballs,” and for leading the “Honey I Shrunk the Kids” franchise. He stepped away from acting in 1997 in order to focus on his family, only returning for the very occasional voiceover or writing gig.\n\nREAD MORE: ‘Saturday Night Live’ Review: One Dwayne Johnson To Rule Us All\n\nMoranis will take to the stage for one very special night to help out his dear friend Dave Thomas for a special benefit show on July 18th in Toronto. Moranis and Thomas will reprise their roles as Bob and Doug McKenzie, two hick Canadian brothers the duo played on SCTV, “Saturday Night Live,” and in the movie “Strange Brew.”\n\nA gaggle of Canadian comedy legends from the Second City Toronto crowd are turning up. Martin Short will host, and is set to appear as Jiminy Glick. Also on the bill are Dan Aykroyd, Catherine O’Hara, Eugene Levy, and Joe Flaherty, along “Kids in the Hall” alum Scott Thompson. Former bandleader for Dave Letterman’s “The Late Show,” Paul Shaffer, will also appear.\n\nREAD MORE: The 20 Best TV Comedies of the 21st Century, Ranked\n\nThe gang is showing up to raise money to benefit Thomas’ nephew, Jake Thomas, who recently suffered a spinal cord injury that paralyzed him from the waist down. Though a somber reason for a reunion, hopefully the family can enjoy a night of laughter. And with this roster, there are sure to be many."
