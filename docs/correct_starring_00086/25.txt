Rick Moranis is the actor who played Louis Tully in both Ghostbusters and Ghostbusters II.

Television and Early Career[]

Rick Moranis got his start on the sketch comedy show SCTV. His most popular character was "Bob" of Bob and Doug McKenzie (with costar Dave Thomas).

After his wife died of liver cancer in 1991, Moranis significantly reduced the amount of acting work he took until going into full hiatus in 1997, so that he could devote his time to raising their children. However, he has since stated that he is not averse to taking a role under the right circumstances.

Film Roles[]

Moranis is well known for his roles in movies such as Honey, I Shrunk the Kids, Spaceballs, and Little Shop of Horrors.

Ghostbusters[]

After John Candy ultimately passed on the role of Louis Tully, the script was sent to an agent who sent it to his client Rick Moranis who had been patiently waiting in the wings. Moranis helped tailor the character and came up with the idea for Louis to be an accountant.[1][2] Moranis improvised lines during the party scene.[3] He also suggested Louis' party for a scene right before principal photography started. Ivan Reitman decided to shoot the party as one long take to retain Moranis' comedic flow.[4] When Egon and Janine interviewed possessed Louis, the crew simply had Rick Moranis duck out and used a one of the rubber heads of a Terror Dog during the parts where the screen shows Vinz Clortho.[5]

After Ghostbusters II[]

Rick Moranis was approached to reprise the role of Louis Tully for Ghostbusters: The Video Game. Bill Murray really pushed the game's development team to get Rick Moranis. Murray even directly called up Moranis.[6] He came around towards the end of production and was okay with being involved with the game. It so happened that his head was modeled and ready to go but there wasn't any manpower left to rig him in animation because everyone was working on finishing the cinematics. There was an idea of putting Louis in a fully body cast or making the area where the Ghostbusters II No Ghost sign, miniature satellite dish, and Ecto 1-a doors are stored Louis' office and just have Louis stick his hand out and play some recorded lines. Ultimately, Louis was written out of the game as being out on sick leave after returning home from scouting cities for new franchises.[7] Around 2009-2010, Moranis was contacted by an associate of Dan Aykroyd to work on another Ghostbusters movie.[8] He also passed on a cameo in the Ghostbusters (2016 Movie) because the role didn't appeal to him but in general he continues to be picky when it comes to a film or television role because.[9] Rick Moranis was approached to reprise Louis in Ghostbusters: Afterlife by Ivan Reitman before his passing and by others but he declined.[10]
