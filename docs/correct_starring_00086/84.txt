Original Ghostbusters star Rick Moranis is reportedly not reprising his role as Louis Tully in Jason Reitman’s highly-anticipated follow-up Ghostbusters: Afterlife.

According to Vanity Fair, who visited the film’s set, Moranis will not be reprising his role as he “has largely withdrawn from performing over the past 20 years and did not return.”

Moranis did have the opportunity to return to the Ghostbusters world in the Paul Feig-directed Ghostbusters reboot but revealed that he turned down a cameo appearance.

“I hope it’s terrific. But it just makes no sense to me,” Moranis previously stated. “Why would I do just one day of shooting on something I did 30 years ago?”

The news of Moranis not returning to the franchise comes quickly after the official announcement that Bill Murray will be back in his role as Venkman in Ghostbusters: Afterlife.
