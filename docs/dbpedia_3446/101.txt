She made her feature film debut in the 1986 film Under the Cherry Moon (1986), which was directed by and starred Prince.

In the late 1990s she was scheduled to appear opposite Harrison Ford in a doomed production titled “Age of Aquarius,” but the project fell through due to financing complications.

The casting choice of her as Katherine Clifton in The English Patient (1996) led to a dispute between the studio and the producers of the film. Originally, 20th Century Fox was to finance the film, but they preferred a more well-known actress to play Katharine instead of Thomas. Demi Moore lobbied particularly hard for the role. After the producers refused to give in on a series of casting choices, Fox backed out of the film, and the project was uncertain just as production was about to begin. However, within a few weeks – during which the cast and crew stayed on in Italy without knowing if the film would be made – the film was picked up by Miramax.

As of 2014, she has appeared in three films that were nominated for the Best Picture Oscar: Four Weddings and a Funeral (1994), The English Patient (1996) and Gosford Park (2001). Of those, only The English Patient (1996) won in the category.

She was awarded the prestigious Laurence Olivier best actress award for her performance in Anton Chekhov’s “The Seagull”, on London’s West End Stage. She was also nominated for the same award for her performance in Harold Pinter’s “Old Times”.

She was awarded the DBE (Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire) in the 2015 Queen’s New Year Honours List for her services to drama.

Has starred in 3 films with good friend Ralph Fiennes: The English Patient (1996), Chromophobia (2005) and The Invisible Woman (2013).

Starred in three movies about World War II: The English Patient (1996), Sarah’s Key (2010) and Suite Française (2014).
