        "text": "Lily James has booked her next role – the title character in the upcoming true-crime love story Peggy Jo!\n\nThe movie “is loosely based on the true-story of the life of Texan Peggy Jo Tallas, who takes to robbing banks while posing as a man,” according to Variety.\n\nPeggy Jo will be directed by Phillip Noyce, who previously directed movies like Salt, The Giver, and Patriot Games.\n\nProducer Simon Brooks said, “I have been looking to make a movie with Phillip Noyce for years and Peggy Jo is finally the one. It is a great emotive and thrilling story that will capture audiences worldwide.”\n\nHere is a longer description of the character: “Peggy Jo (James) is a beautiful person, prone to be romantically lost in books and films; however she is not the sort of person who lets life and people get the better of her. When her latest beau turns out to be married to his bank co-worker, she takes matters into her own hands, robbing his bank disguised as a man with a big beard and a back-to-front cowboy hat.”"
