        "text": "01 of 20\n\n21 Bridges (2019)\n\nChadwick Boseman — in one of his final onscreen roles — plays an NYPD detective engaged in a game of cat and mouse in this sturdy crime thriller. After two Manhattan criminals (Stephan James and Taylor Kitsch) steal dozens of kilograms of cocaine and gun down a group of officers, Det. Andre Davis (Boseman) is assigned to find them. But first, he has to effectively lock Manhattan down overnight and try and prevent more casualties. While not the most profound of films — EW's critic quips, \"wishing for some kind of subtlety, particularly in the wake of the movie’s blood-soaked finale, might be a bridge too far\" — it serves as yet another potent reminder of Boseman's immeasurable talent. –Kevin Jacobsen\n\nWhere to watch 21 Bridges: Netflix\n\nEW grade: B (read the review)\n\nDirector: Brian Kirk\n\nCast: Chadwick Boseman, Sienna Miller, Stephan James, Keith David, Taylor Kitsch, J.K. Simmons\n\n02 of 20\n\n22 July (2018)\n\nBased on true events, 22 July reconstructs one of the worst days in Norwegian history when a white nationalist terrorist killed 77 people via explosives and gunfire. Director Paul Greengrass, who helmed such pulse-pounding thrillers as United 93 (2006) and The Bourne Ultimatum (2007), delivers another tense experience here as we follow the terrorist, Anders Behring Breivik (Anders Danielsen Lie), as he shows no mercy to his victims. Be warned, though, EW's critic notes: \"22 July is exceptionally choreographed,\" but \"tough to sit through.\" The film is a harrowing look at the banality of evil in its most dangerous form. —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch 22 July: Netflix\n\nEW grade: B– (read the review)\n\nDirector: Paul Greengrass\n\nCast: Anders Danielsen Lie, Jon Øigarden\n\n03 of 20\n\nThe Act of Killing (2012)\n\nFor as entertaining as the other films on this list can be, this documentary proves the sobering reality of crime on a large scale. The Act of Killing (listed on Netflix under its Indonesian title, Jagal) finds director Joshua Oppenheimer diving deep into the Indonesian genocide of 1965 and 1966, wherein the New Order killed accused communists and sympathizers. Oppenheimer asks some of the perpetrators to reenact the murders, and, while chilling in the sheer inhumanity expressed, the film becomes a powerful examination of one man processing his heinous actions. Brutal yet riveting, The Act of Killing is a haunting doc you may never forget. —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch The Act of Killing: Netflix\n\nDirector: Joshua Oppenheimer\n\n04 of 20\n\nBaby Driver (2017)\n\nDescribed by EW's critic as a \"candy-colored action movie opera,\" Baby Driver is a propulsive genre mashup presented with panache. Ansel Elgort plays \"Baby,\" a music aficionado who serves as a getaway driver for a criminal organization. After meeting and dating Debora (Lily James), a local waitress, he is eager to leave his criminal life behind, only to be met with the rude awakening that he can never fully escape it. Like many of writer-director Edgar Wright's past films, Baby Driver plays with genre conventions with giddy flair, though, as EW noted, he also sticks to tropes that have worked for decades, infusing the film with \"a little humor, a little heart, and some really kickass action scenes.\" —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch Baby Driver: Netflix\n\nEW grade: A– (read the review)\n\nDirector: Edgar Wright\n\nCast: Ansel Elgort, Kevin Spacey, Lily James, Eiza González, Jon Hamm, Jamie Foxx, Jon Bernthal\n\n05 of 20\n\nEl Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie (2019)\n\nSure, this sequel film following Jesse Pinkman's struggle to leave his criminal past behind (after escaping those neo-Nazis in the Breaking Bad finale) might be little more than another few episodes of the hit series. But who's complaining about that? Especially as Aaron Paul returns to his career-making role, and series creator Vince Gilligan returns as writer and director.\n\nAs Gilligan proved with his equally showstopping spinoff series Better Call Saul, he's adept at fleshing out his characters' pasts and futures with equal skill. Returning shattered to an Albuquerque reeling from his meth-cooking work, Paul's Pinkman is as weighed down by guilt over his actions as he is by the gathered forces hunting him. Seeking out old allies and accomplices (among others, this marked the last on-screen appearance of Robert Forster as criminal \"disappearer\" Ed Galbraith) as he plots his next move, Pinkman must contend with the damage he's done to himself and everyone in his life, all while contemplating whether he deserves a fresh start at all. Paul has never been better than as the tortured Pinkman. —Dennis Perkins\n\nWhere to watch El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie: Netflix\n\nEW grade: B+ (read the review)\n\nDirector: Vince Gilligan\n\nCast: Aaron Paul, Jesse Plemons, Krysten Ritter, Charles Baker, Matt Jones, Robert Forster, Jonathan Banks, Bryan Cranston\n\n06 of 20\n\nEmily the Criminal (2022)\n\nThis is what happens when student loan debt is so insurmountable that it causes you to take drastic action. Aubrey Plaza plays Emily, a woman working as a delivery driver for a catering service whose minor criminal record prevents her from attaining a better job. With crippling debt, she turns to a life of credit card fraud, which provides fast money and she soon finds herself having a knack for the business and her ambitions inevitably grow larger. Plaza pulls off one of her best performances yet, with a distinct New Jersey accent to boot. \"She makes Emily's tumble into the underworld believable — and more importantly, interesting,\" hails EW's critic. \"She may be a wanton criminal, but she's also a woman very much for these times: Not the antiheroine we knew we needed, maybe, but one that we deserve.\" —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch Emily the Criminal: Netflix\n\nEW grade: B+ (read the review)\n\nDirector: John Patton Ford\n\nCast: Aubrey Plaza, Theo Rossi, Megalyn Echikunwoke, Gina Gershon\n\n07 of 20\n\nThe Gentlemen (2020)\n\nEarly in his career, Guy Ritchie established himself as one of the go-tos for twisty crime comedy, and this well-received saga full of backstabbing and double-crossings proved he still had the goods. Cannabis tycoon Mickey Pearson (Matthew McConaughey) is looking to sell his massively profitable business to an American billionaire (Jeremy Strong), but outside forces take great pains to acquire the business for themselves. EW's critic calls The Gentlemen \"slick, silly fun — a giddy exercise in freewheeling nihilism, played to the hilt.\" You can also watch the spinoff TV series on Netflix, the first season of which was released in March. —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch The Gentlemen: Netflix\n\nEW grade: B– (read the review)\n\nDirector: Guy Ritchie\n\nCast: Matthew McConaughey, Charlie Hunnam, Henry Golding, Michelle Dockery, Jeremy Strong, Eddie Marsan, Colin Farrell, Hugh Grant\n\n08 of 20\n\nGlass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery (2022)\n\nA crime is afoot, and, once again, Benoit Blanc suspects foul play. Daniel Craig reprises his deliciously fun role as the private detective in this standalone sequel to 2019's Knives Out, as he joins a murder mystery party hosted by tech billionaire Miles Bron (Edward Norton). When a guest ends up actually dying, fingers are pointed among the group of friends and Blanc goes about trying to solve the murder. But this is just the tip of the iceberg, as there are so many more layers to this onion than one could even predict.\n\nFeaturing gasp-worthy twists and a committed ensemble (particularly Kate Hudson and Janelle Monáe), Glass Onion is an entertaining mystery with a healthy dose of social satire. As EW's critic writes, writer-director Rian Johnson has \"no shortage of ammunition for his rat-a-tat takes on pop-culture ephemera and the navel-gazing delusions of wealth and fame.\" —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery: Netflix\n\nEW grade: B+ (read the review)\n\nDirector: Rian Johnson\n\nCast: Daniel Craig, Edward Norton, Janelle Monáe, Kathryn Hahn, Leslie Odom Jr., Jessica Henwick, Madelyn Cline, Kate Hudson, Dave Bautista\n\n09 of 20\n\nThe Good Nurse (2022)\n\nThis slow-burn crime drama is all the more chilling knowing it's based on a true story. Jessica Chastain plays Amy Loughren, an ICU night nurse who discovers that her friend and colleague, Charlie Cullen (Eddie Redmayne), has been secretly killing patients. A pair of police detectives on the case convince Amy — who is also dealing with a heart condition — to find a way to get Charlie to reveal the truth.\n\nThe Good Nurse drew praise particularly for its central performances by Chastain and Redmayne. \"Chastain, tremulous yet determined, brings something gratifyingly grounded to her everywoman hero,\" EW's critic writes, \"and an eerie, pitch-perfect Redmayne, wearing Charlie's nice-guy drag like a battering ram, lets his mask slip so incrementally that the final scenes feel like a true terrifying rupture.\" Redmayne earned nominations at the Golden Globes, Screen Actors Guild Awards, and BAFTAs for his performance. —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch The Good Nurse: Netflix\n\nEW grade: B+ (read the review)\n\nDirector: Tobias Lindholm\n\nCast: Jessica Chastain, Eddie Redmayne, Nnamdi Asomugha, Kim Dickens, Noah Emmerich\n\n10 of 20\n\nThe Harder They Fall (2021)\n\nAgainst the backdrop of the Old West, outlaw Nat Love (Jonathan Majors) is ready for revenge. Having witnessed his parents' murder at a young age by the villainous Rufus Buck (Idris Elba), Love and his gang seek out the dastardly criminal, recently freed from prison. Together with his gang and his lover, Stagecoach Mary (Zazie Beetz), Love prepares to finally seek justice for his childhood trauma. Propelled by kinetic energy, committed performances, and a dynamic soundtrack, The Harder They Fall also made headlines as one of the only mainstream Westerns to feature an all-Black cast among its principal characters. The film assembled newer stars like Majors and Beetz with familiar favorites like Elba, Regina King, and Delroy Lindo, and the cast earned numerous ensemble award nominations among critics' groups. —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch The Harder They Fall: Netflix\n\nEW grade: B (read the review)\n\nDirector: Jeymes Samuel\n\nCast: Jonathan Majors, Idris Elba, Zazie Beetz, Regina King, Delroy Lindo, LaKeith Stanfield, RJ Cyler, Danielle Deadwyler\n\n11 of 20\n\nThe Highwaymen (2019)\n\nBonnie and Clyde stunned audiences when it premiered in the summer of 1967, revolutionizing cinema with its casual broadcasting of gratuitous sex and violence. The Highwaymen (2019), the story of the two Texas rangers charged with hunting down the bank robbers, doesn't take the same guns-blazing approach, but remains a worthy follow-up to one of Hollywood's best-known crime stories. Less of an action film than a character study with occasional stunt sequences, The Highwaymen stars Woody Harrelson and Kevin Costner as past-their-prime patrolmen, pulled out of their desultory retirements and returned to the job — and their old partnership — by a put-upon Texas governor (Kathy Bates).\n\nDirected by John Lee Hancock with an eye toward authenticity — the crew filmed the climactic showdown on the same stretch of road where the outlaws were ambushed in May of 1934 — Costner says the experience of shooting the final scene was \"haunting.\" A slow-burn Depression-era buddy cop film with historical roots, EW critic writes, \"The Highwaymen is a leisurely ride with a pair of actors who know how to do a lot by not doing too much.\" —D.P.\n\nWhere to watch The Highwaymen: Netflix\n\nEW grade: B (read the review)\n\nDirector: John Lee Hancock\n\nCast: Kevin Costner, Woody Harrelson, Kathy Bates, John Carroll Lynch, Kim Dickens, Thomas Mann\n\n12 of 20\n\nHoly Spider (2022)\n\nBased on true events, this harrowing Persian-language film tells the story of Saeed Hanaei, the serial killer who murdered multiple sex workers in Iran in the early-2000s. Here, the investigation is told from the perspective of a fictional journalist, Arezoo Rahimi (Zar Amir Ebrahimi), who faces deep-seated sexism on her path to the truth and puts her own life in danger to get a confession out of Hanaei. Operating as both a gripping crime thriller and a trenchant social commentary about systemic misogyny, Holy Spider was a favorite when it premiered at the Cannes Film Festival in 2022, with Amir Ebrahimi winning the Best Actress prize. —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch Holy Spider: Netflix\n\nDirector: Ali Abbasi\n\nCast: Mehdi Bajestani, Zar Amir Ebrahimi\n\n13 of 20\n\nThe Irishman (2019)\n\nNow that Netflix has cited this Martin Scorsese Mob movie as one of the \"expensive vanity projects\" the streamer will no longer be producing, it's about time to check out the old-timer filmmaker's collaboration with longtime muse Robert De Niro. Based on a biography of supposed Mafia hitman (and self-professed murderer of Teamster head Jimmy Hoffa), Frank Sheeran, The Irishman sees Scorsese once more returning to that specific criminal underworld, legendary stars in tow. In addition to De Niro's Sheeran, Hoffa himself is played by Al Pacino, Harvey Keitel plays mobster Angelo Bruno, and Joe Pesci (lured out of retirement by De Niro) plays mob boss Russell Bufalino.\n\nAnd if you're wondering how those septuagenarian stars can play middle-aged, 1950s–1970s versions of their real-life characters, you can thank that Netflix money. The streamer allowed Scorsese to experiment with groundbreaking (and mostly successful) de-aging tricks as De Niro's elderly assassin looks back on his improbably eventful life of crime. So, does The Irishman qualify as a \"vanity project?\" Possibly. But it's not vanity when you're Martin Scorsese, continuing the career-long exploration of the links between power, violence, greed, and the American dream. —D.P.\n\nWhere to watch The Irishman: Netflix\n\nEW grade: B+ (read the review)\n\nDirector: Martin Scorsese\n\nCast: Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, Joe Pesci, Harvey Keitel, Anna Paquin, Ray Romano, Stephen Graham, Bobby Cannavale\n\n14 of 20\n\nLost Girls (2020)\n\nBased on true events, Lost Girls focuses on the aftermath of unspeakable crimes rather than the crimes themselves. Amy Ryan stars as Mari Gilbert, the real-life mother who pressured investigators to find her missing daughter, leading to the uncovering of several murders by the still-unknown Long Island serial killer. The mystery drama, directed by Oscar-nominated documentarian Liz Garbus, drew raves for its humanizing of the victims. \"To the people who love them,\" writes EW's critic, \"they're still daughters and sisters, mothers and friends. And Garbus, a much-awarded documentarian...works hard to make them seen in her narrative-feature debut.\" —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch Lost Girls: Netflix\n\nEW grade: B (read the review)\n\nDirector: Liz Garbus\n\nCast: Amy Ryan, Thomasin McKenzie, Lola Kirke, Oona Laurence, Dean Winters, Miriam Shor, Reed Birney, Kevin Corrigan, Gabriel Byrne\n\n15 of 20\n\nMiami Vice (2006)\n\nThis stylized adaptation of the '80s TV show of the same name had a mixed reception on its initial release, but its reputation has only grown stronger over the years. In it, Miami detectives Sonny Crockett (Colin Farrell) and Rico Tubbs (Jamie Foxx) are enlisted to go undercover to help the FBI suss out the source of a leak within a joint operation that led to multiple deaths. Engrossing and moody, Michael Mann's update of the cult favorite TV series is all the more impressive now for its thoughtful use of digital cinematography. \"By insisting on making action films with an unshakable artistic rigor,\" writes EW's critic, \"Mann remains the genre's greatest contemporary formalist without sacrificing an equally intense humanism.\" —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch Miami Vice: Netflix\n\nEW grade: N/A (read the review)\n\nDirector: Michael Mann\n\nCast: Jamie Foxx, Colin Farrell, Gong Li, Naomie Harris, Ciarán Hinds, Justin Theroux, Barry Shabaka Henley\n\n16 of 20\n\nMolly's Game (2017)\n\nBased on the true story of entrepreneur Molly Bloom, this crime drama biopic is a riveting rise-and-fall saga. Jessica Chastain stars as Bloom, a former athlete who got involved in the underground poker scene, eventually running high-stakes games that attract a wealthy clientele and dangerous mafia organizations. The film recounts Bloom's story as she is eventually indicted and put on trial. Oscar-winning screenwriter Aaron Sorkin made his feature directorial debut with this film, and his fingerprints are all over it, particularly his signature snappy dialogue. EW's critic raves, \"Molly’s Game is a cool, crackling, confident film that appeals to your intelligence instead of insulting it.\" —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch Molly's Game: Netflix\n\nEW grade: A– (read the review)\n\nDirector: Aaron Sorkin\n\nCast: Jessica Chastain, Idris Elba, Kevin Costner, Michael Cera, Jeremy Strong, Chris O'Dowd, Bill Camp\n\n17 of 20\n\nNatural Born Killers (1994)\n\nReleased in a decade when 24/7 news coverage was on the rise, this bold crime thriller about a mass-murdering duo that attracts the attention of the media couldn't have been more timely. Woody Harrelson and Juliette Lewis star as Mickey and Mallory, a married couple who rack up dozens of kills across the Southwest and subsequently become objects of fascination for a TV journalist (Robert Downey Jr.) and a detective (Tom Sizemore).

Businessman Oh Dae-su (Choi Min-sik) is kidnapped for unknown reasons and confined to a hotel room for 15 years. Finally released, he sets out on a dangerous path of revenge against his captors, one that’s filled with bloody violence, body horror, and a sickening twist that may just leave you speechless. As EW's critic quips, \"The filmmaker who can dream such creepfest fantasies is the man to whom Quentin Tarantino, a declared Park Chan-wook admirer, can tip his Kangol cap in awe.\" —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch Oldboy: Netflix\n\nEW grade: N/A (read the review)\n\nDirector: Park Chan-wook\n\nCast: Choi Min-sik, Yoo Ji-tae, Kang Hye-jung\n\n19 of 20\n\nThe White Tiger (2021)\n\nAn enterprising Indian man does whatever he can to break free of a life of servitude in this sprawling crime drama. Young Balram (Adarsh Gourav) works as a chauffeur for a rich couple (Rajkummar Rao and Priyanka Chopra Jonas), who treat him with respect but still keep the boundaries of their different classes in place. One night, a deadly accident leads to Balram having to take the blame for it, which sends him down a path of exploiting his boss and trying to find a way out so that he can be his own boss.\n\nThe White Tiger earned huge critical acclaim, with EW's critic praising the central performance by Gourav, \"whose soulful combination of sheer will and vulnerability should, in a just world, win him the kind of accolades that helped make Slumdog's Dev Patel a star.\" Gourav received a BAFTA nomination for his turn, while writer-director Ramin Bahrani earned an Oscar nomination for Best Adapted Screenplay. —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch The White Tiger: Netflix\n\nEW grade: B+ (read the review)\n\nDirector: Ramin Bahrani\n\nCast: Adarsh Gourav, Priyanka Chopra Jonas, Rajkummar Rao\n\n20 of 20\n\nWild Things (1998)\n\nThis wild crime thriller may start with shocking allegation, but, as the film soon proves, nothing is quite as it seems. Denise Richards plays wealthy high schooler Kelly Van Ryan, who accuses her guidance counselor, Sam Lombardo (Matt Dillon), of raping her; her case is then reinforced when outcast Suzie Toller (Neve Campbell) comes forward with her own allegation against Sam. Numerous twists and turns unfold from there, to the point that even the end credits contain revelations. While lurid and silly to some, there's an odd appeal to Wild Things that is simply irresistible. As EW's critic writes, director John McNaughton \"achieves a sweat-and-champagne atmosphere that sucks you right in.\" —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch Wild Things: Netflix\n\nEW grade: B (read the review)\n\nDirector: John McNaughton\n\nCast: Kevin Bacon, Matt Dillon, Neve Campbell, Theresa Russell, Denise Richards, Daphne Rubin-Vega, Robert Wagner, Bill Murray"
