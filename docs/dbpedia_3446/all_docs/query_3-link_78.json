        "text": "The Mill Valley Film Festival celebrates its milestone 40th anniversary with a stellar lineup of movies, parties, panels and tributes to Oscar-nominated actress Kristin Scott Thomas, former Marin resident Sean Penn, Oscar winner Holly Hunter and “New Queer Cinema” director Todd Haynes.\n\nAcademy Award-nominated actor Andrew Garfield, director Dee Rees and first-time director Greta Gerwig will be honored with “Spotlight” presentations of their new movies.\n\nIn all, 114 films will be screened during the festival’s 11 days, Oct. 5-15, including 11 world premieres, 11 North American premieres and nine U.S. premieres. Details were released in a schedule sent to members Wednesday.\n\nFestival founder and executive director Mark Fishkin said he had no grand plan for the festival when he started it in 1977 with three days of movies. On that subject, he quoted Marin comedian Michael Pritchard.\n\nMVFF > MORE COVERAGE\n\n“If you want to make God laugh, tell him you made plans,” he joked. “It was one year at a time, really. The nature of the festival has changed and grown. But I still enjoy finding a great film and sharing it with the public and supporting films and filmmakers. That’s important to me.”\n\nAlong with director Joe Wright, Thomas will be on hand for the opening night film, “Darkest Hour,” about British Prime Minister Winston Churchill’s leadership as Britain pushed against a Nazi invasion in the dire days of World War II. Thomas plays Churchill’s wife, Clementine.\n\nThe next night, the 57-year-old actress will be honored with a festival tribute at the Rafael Film Center that includes an on-stage conversation and a second screening of “Darkest Hour.” The other opening night film had not been confirmed by press time.\n\nTributes\n\nPenn, who was a friend and supporter of the festival when he lived in Ross with his family, returns to Marin for an Oct. 7 tribute at the Rafael. The evening includes an on-stage interview and clips from his extensive body of work.\n\n“He did a lot of things for us over the years,” Fishkin said, mentioning Penn’s past festival appearances for “I am Sam,” “21 Grams” and “Into the Wild,” among other movies. He was among the celebrities in attendance when the restored Rafael Film Center opened in 2003.\n\nHunter, who won the Academy Award for her performance in Jane Campion’s 1993 film “The Piano,” talks about her career at a tribute at the Rafael that includes clips of her movies. The date and time are to be announced.\n\nDirector Haynes, who last appeared at the festival in 2007 with the Bob Dylan-inspired movie “I’m Not There,” will be honored with an Oct. 13 tribute and screening of his new film, “Wonderstruck,” starring Julianne Moore and Michelle Williams in an adaptation of a novel by Brian Selznick. Haynes burst onto the scene with his directorial debut, “Poison,” in 1991, a three-part exploration of AIDS-era perceptions and subversions that was shown in Mill Valley and is considered the seminal work of what became known as “New Queer Cinema.”\n\nWomen in film\n\nWith only 7 percent of Hollywood films directed by women, the festival set out to celebrate its 40th anniversary with the goal of having 40 percent of its films by women directors. Under director of programming Zoe Elton, that goal was surpassed, with 44 percent of the anniversary-year films directed by women.\n\nOne of the most notable is NAACP Image Award-nominated director and screenwriter Dee Rees, who will talk about her career and her acclaimed new film, “Mudbound,” a tale of two families in the Jim Crow South, at a spotlight evening on Oct. 7. “Mudbound” stars Carey Mulligan and singer Mary J. Blige.\n\n“I think she’s a really hot talent,” Elton said of Rees. “This is a film that’s epic in its sensibility. And she manages the near impossible task of telling the story from multiple perspectives without being hampered by that. The storytelling is smooth and beautiful. She’s really firing on all cylinders as a director.”\n\nOn Oct. 14, the spotlight will be on Garfield, a 34-year-old Oscar nominee best known for “The Amazing Spider Man” and, most recently, “Hacksaw Ridge.” He’ll be on stage at the Rafael to talk about his new film, “Breathe,” in which he stars opposite Claire Foy (“The Crown”) as a newlywed whose free-spirited life is upended by polio.\n\nDirector Richard Linklater, who filmed his sensational movie “Boyhood” over a dozen years, will be on hand for the Oct. 12 “Centerpiece” screening of his new film, “Last Flag Flying,” starring Steve Carell, Bryan Cranston and Laurence Fishburne as three Vietnam vets who reunite for one last mission.\n\nOn closing night, the 34-year-old Gerwig, who was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for her performance in the 2013 film “Frances Ha,” talks about making her directorial debut with “Lady Bird,” a closing night film that has been described as “a love letter to Sacramento,” her hometown.\n\nOn “Directors’ Night,” Oct. 11, Aaron Sorkin, celebrated screenwriter of “The West Wing” and “The Social Network,” will be at the Rafael for a screening of “Molly’s Game.” He makes his debut as a director with this film, starring Jessica Chastain as Molly Bloom, a competitive skier and Harvard law student who runs afoul of the law by running the world’s most exclusive high-stakes poker game. Sorkin adapted the script from Bloom’s 2014 memoir.\n\nThe opening night gala, featuring music by Wonderbread 5, is set for Marin Country Mart in Larkspur. For the first time, Mill Valley’s downtown plaza will be the setting for closing night festivities.\n\nSome other highlights: Village Music’s John Goddard hosts the 27th year of his “Hi De Ho Show” on Oct. 6 and 14, chronicling the 36 concerts he saw during the Summer of Love. Bolinas resident Frances McDormand stars in “Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri,” screening Oct. 8 and 15. And the festival reprises “Woodstock,” one of the films shown at the first festival.\n\nOver 40 years, Mill Valley has earned a reputation for showcasing independent American and foreign films alongside big budget award contenders. In 2014, Variety said: “Part of the festival’s charm is how it reflects both the local community’s roots and its forward-thinking spirit.” Screen International named it one of the top 10 festivals in the country.\n\n“The festival has become established without being establishment,” Elton said. “It’s still got that edge that we expect from the San Francisco Bay Area, from the innovators and thought provokers that we have here. The edge is still there.”"
