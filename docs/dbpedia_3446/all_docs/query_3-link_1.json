        "text": "At the close of World War II, a young nurse tends to a badly burned plane crash victim. His past is shown in flashbacks, revealing an involvement in a fateful love affair.\n\nAn accidental discovery near a doctor's estate stirs up some painful memories eight years after his wife's hideous murder, and now, things are bound to take a turn for the unexpected. Does the good doctor know more than he's letting on?\n\nA futuristic Begegnung (1945), this is a love story in which the romance is doomed by genetic incompatibility.\n\nSet in the 1930s, a group of pretentious rich and famous get together for a weekend of relaxation at a hunting resort. But when a murder occurs, each one of these interesting characters becomes a suspect.\n\nOver the course of five social occasions, a committed bachelor must consider the notion that he may have discovered love.\n\nAn American agent, under false suspicion of disloyalty, must discover and expose the real spy without the help of his organization.\n\nWhen a man is diagnosed with terminal cancer, he takes custody of his misanthropic teenage son, for whom quality time means getting high, engaging in small-time prostitution, and avoiding his father.\n\nA pastor preoccupied with writing the perfect sermon fails to realize that his wife is having an affair, and his children are up to no good.\n\nFour guys sit around drinking beer and talking, trying to figure out the meaning of \"the pompatus of love\" (from the Steve Miller song \"Joker\") and analyzing their relationships with women."
