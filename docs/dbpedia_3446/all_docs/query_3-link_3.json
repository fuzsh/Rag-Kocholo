        "text": "Highest Rated: 97% Microcosmos (1996)\n\nLowest Rated: 17% The Pompatus of Love (1995)\n\nBirthday: May 24, 1960\n\nBirthplace: Cornwall, England, UK\n\nOscar nominee Kristin Scott Thomas' poise and elegant work in such films as \"Four Weddings and a Funeral\" (1994) and \"The English Patient\" (1996) has impressed critics and moviegoers alike for decades. After an auspicious debut in the Prince-directed \"Under the Cherry Moon\" (1986), she quickly proved herself capable of holding her own with such esteemed film legends as Judi Dench and Alec Guinness in \"A Handful of Dust\" (1988) before establishing herself as an international star with \"The English Patient.\" A stint in Hollywood yielded hits like \"Mission: Impossible\" (1996) and \"The Horse Whisperer\" (1998), but she was soon back in Europe for independent-minded productions. Her profile was raised considerably by acclaimed performances on stage in \"The Seagull\" in 2007 and in the French feature \"I've Loved You So Long\" (2008), both of which cemented her status as one of the United Kingdom's most enduring and acclaimed actresses.\n\nHighest rated movies\n\n96% Richard III\n\n93% Tell No One\n\n92% Four Weddings and a Funeral\n\n88% Final Set\n\n88% In the House\n\n88% I've Loved You So Long\n\n87% Gosford Park\n\n86% The English Patient\n\nPhotos\n\nRyan Gosling, Nicolas Winding Refn, Kristin Scott Thomas at arrivals for ONLY GOD FORGIVES Premiere, BAM Harvey Theatre, Brooklyn, NY July 16, 2013.
