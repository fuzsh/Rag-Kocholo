        "text": "By Carla Meyer\n\nSacramento Bee\n\nREVIEW *** out of ****\n\n'Tell No One'\n\nRate: NR (contains violence, language, nudity; French, with English subtitles)\n\nRunning time: 2:05\n\nDirector: Guillaume Canet\n\nCast: Francois Cluzet, Kristin Scott-Thomas, Marie-Josee Croze, Nathalie Baye\n\nShowing: Opens Aug. 29 at Rose (Port Townsend)\n\nOur digital age has made it easy to find and contact old friends and acquaintances. But e-mails from the great beyond are still unusual.\n\nIn \"Tell No One,\" physician Alex Beck (the excellent Francois Cluzet) receives a cryptic e-mail that appears to be from his wife, Margot (Marie-Josee Croze), supposedly murdered eight years earlier, along with a link to a video showing her living and breathing in the present day. This intriguing development anchors this engaging, well-acted French thriller based on a novel by American writer Harlan Coben.\n\nThough director and co-writer Guillaume Canet has moved the setting from New York to Paris, \"Tell No One\" sometimes plays like an American film in its quick pacing, borderline-indulgent use of songs such as U2's \"With or Without You\" and the inclusion of Kristin Scott- Thomas in a supporting role.\n\nSpeaking only French, like the rest of the actors, Scott-Thomas looks less regal and more hip and earthy than in her American-film heyday. She plays the romantic partner of Alex's sister (Marina Hands) and his ally in his effort to once again stave off a police investigation.\n\nEight years ago, Alex and Margot were taking a dip in the small lake where they had been swimming since they were kids. After a minor quarrel, Margot swam away. Alex heard her cry out, but was distracted by a conk to his head. At least, that's his story.\n\nThe murder was attributed to a serial killer, but the police never understood how Alex, rendered unconscious by the blow, made it from the water to shore. When the bodies of two men are found near the site, along with a key to a safe deposit box, Alex again becomes a suspect.\n\nAs \"Tell No One\" twists and turns, Canet lends the film great intensity, using a hand-held camera to heighten anxious moments. But he also takes care to show the physical beauty of the place where Alex and Margot first fell for each other as youngsters. Their love bloomed in the idyllic country setting surrounding the lake — a place that retains a luster for Alex despite what occurred there later.\n\nThe most evocative location in \"Tell No One\" is Cluzet's face. Regardless of what really happened to Margot, Alex's grief is still real and everpresent, existing just under the surface, whether he's treating a patient or trying to elude the police. While the e-mail concept provides the movie's hook, it's Cluzet's pained but determined expression that sustains interest throughout \"Tell No One.\""
