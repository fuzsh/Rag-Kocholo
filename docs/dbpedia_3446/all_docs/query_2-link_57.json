        "text": "The first-look image from Kristin Scott Thomas’ new film, My Mother’s Wedding, has finally been released.\n\nThe Oscar-nominated star is turning her hand to directing after an almost four-decade-long career as a revered actor, famed for her roles in The English Patient, Four Weddings and a Funeral, Gosford Park and Darkest Hour, among others.\n\nOf her directorial debut, Scott Thomas, who will also star in the film, said: “I have wanted to direct for a long time and it was thrilling to create this fictional family using my own childhood memories as a springboard.”\n\nHere is everything you need to know about the upcoming film.\n\nWhen will My Mother’s Wedding be released?\n\nOn July 27, Scott Thomas confirmed that principal photography on the film, which she co-wrote with John Micklethwait, had been completed, and released an intriguing first look. Fox News, however, said the release date has yet to be finalised.\n\nWhat is the plot of the film?\n\nMy Mother’s Wedding follows the story of three romantically dysfunctional sisters who return to their childhood home for the third wedding of their twice-widowed mother, Diana.\n\nThe three daughters lead very different lives – Georgina is a palliative nurse, Victoria is a Hollywood star, and Katherine a captain in the Royal Navy.\n\nThe official synopsis reads: “Over the weekend, the family gathers to celebrate a new marriage, but mother and daughters alike are forced to revisit the past and confront the future, with help from a colourful group of unexpected wedding guests.”\n\nThe film’s first-look image shows the three sisters leaning over a dinner table crammed with leftovers and half-empty glasses of red wine, looking unimpressed across the table.\n\nWho is in the cast?\n\nScott Thomas will take on the role of the twice-widowed mother-of-three, Diana, starring alongside Scarlett Johansson, Sienna Miller, and Emily Beecham, who will play her daughters.\n\nJohansson will play navy captain Katherine, Miller will play Hollywood star Victoria and Emily Beecham will round out the sister trio as the palliative nurse, Georgina.\n\nThis is the third time Scott Thomas has played Johansson’s mother, after The Horse Whisperer and The Other Boleyn Girl.\n\nShe said: “Directing and acting with such talented actresses and reuniting with Scarlett Johansson has been exhilarating.”\n\nRounding out the star-studded cast is Slumdog Millionaire’s Freida Pinto, Sex Education’s Sindhu Vee, Anatomy of a Scandal’s Joshua McGuire, Game of Thrones’ Mark Stanley, Call My Agent!’s Thibault de Montalembert, and Scott Thomas’s Four Weddings and a Funeral co-star James Fleet."
