        "text": "Looking for a good new crime drama to watch tonight? You’ve come to the right place.\n\nIt can be hard to keep track of what’s on – especially when there are so many streaming services to choose from. That’s why we’ve compiled a comprehensive list of the very best in blood-speckled television that are either available to watch now or are coming our way in the next few months. Expect detective dramas, missing persons cases, true-crime-inspired retellings and more in our list below…\n\nThe best new crime TV shows in 2024\n\nHigh Country\n\nWhen it’s on: Available now.\n\nWhere to watch it: BBC iPlayer.\n\nLeah Purcell starring in High Country. Credit: BBC/Curio/Sony Pictures Television/Narelle Portanier\n\nAboriginal-Australian actress, writer and director Leah Purcell stars in this complex mystery thriller that sees the Wentworth star take on the role of big city police sergeant Andrea ‘Andie’ Whitford. Andie gets transferred to the mountainous Victorian High Country to investigate a complicated missing persons case of five people who have disappeared in the wilderness.\n\nOn the face of it, this is high quality drama: a rural noir that entertains and grips. But under the surface there are big themes at play, like any good piece of art. The historic and current treatment of Australian Aborigines looms large here and asks some important questions of its audience.\n\nRed Eye\n\nWhen it’s on: Available now.\n\nWhere to watch it: ITVX.\n\nThe British screenwriter Peter A. Dowling is more used to penning scripts for Hollywood, his most successful being the 2005 Jodie-Foster-on-a-plane thriller Flightplan. For this six-part ITV thriller, series creator and writer Dowling returns to what he knows best: coming up with exciting stories that take place 35,000ft in the air.\n\nThe Hobbit and Hannibal star Richard Armitage plays Dr. Matthew Nolan, a Brit who’s extradited to China on suspicion of murder after being in a suspicious car accident. The majority of the series takes place on a rather action-packed overnight flight to Beijing.\n\nCrazy Rich Asians’ and Gangs of London’s Jing Lusi plays DI Hana Li, Dr. Nolan’s police escort. Her mission is to accompany the suspect back to the Chinese capital without any hiccups – which goes rather wrong, rather quickly. Throw in political intrigue and some dastardly MI5 and CIA plotting and you’ve got all the ingredients for a tasty dramatic dish that’s much more filling than your average in-flight meal.\n\nThe Jetty\n\nWhen it’s on: Available now.\n\nWhere to watch it: BBC One, BBC iPlayer.\n\nJenna Coleman in BBC’s The Jetty. Image Credit: Firebird Pictures/Ben Blackall.\n\nPart crime drama, part exploration of some weighty themes such as sexual consent and abuse, this four-part series from writer Cat Jones sees another powerhouse lead performance by Jenna Coleman.\n\nThe Serpent star plays a police detective called Ember Manning who’s investigating the arson attack of a lakeside house in Lancashire. The case soon spirals into a missing persons case and unearths dark secrets tying Ember to a predatory sex offender in the area. The case gets seriously personal when she starts to suspect that her recently deceased ex-husband may not have been all he seemed and could well have been involved in the case.\n\nAlien: Romulus‘ Archie Renaux, Bridgerton‘s Ruby Stokes and The First Omen’s Ralph Ineson co-star in this taut and thought-provoking thriller. The Guardian’s Lucy Mangan called The Jetty ‘not only a very good thriller, but an unexpectedly attentive meditation on what it means to move as a woman through a world that is suffused with male violence in all its myriad forms.’\n\nJoan\n\nWhen it’s on: TBC.\n\nWhere to watch it: ITV1 and ITVX.\n\nNext up, we have another series about the rise of a powerful female criminal. This time, a British one. Game of Thrones and X-Men actress Sophie Turner will leave fantasy and sci-fi briefly as she takes on the role of Joan Hannington in this six-part ITV series.\n\nHannington was an infamous diamond thief, a glamorous woman whose heists earned her a nickname very similar to Griselda Blanco’s: ‘The Godmother’. The thriller is an adaptation of Hannington’s 2004 memoir, I Am What I Am: The True Story of Britain’s Most Notorious Jewel Thief. Frank Dillane (Fear the Walking Dead) co-stars. For more information, read our round-up of everything we know about Joan so far.\n\nPresumed Innocent\n\nWhen it’s on: June 14, 2024.\n\nWhere to watch it: Apple TV+.\n\nWhen David E. Kelley is behind a project, big names take note. The writer and producer behind the likes of Ally McBeal and Big Little Lies has a knack for attracting A-listers to his small screen outings. The latest star to sign up to a Kelley show is Source Code and Donnie Darko big-hitter Jake Gyllenhaal.\n\nKelley used to be an attorney, so is happy working with courtroom-based source material. Presumed Innocent is an adaptation of Scott Turow’s debut novel from 1987 and sees Gyllenhaal take on the role of Rusty Sabich (played by Harrison Ford in Alan J. Pakula’s 1990 film adaptation), a prosecutor accused of murdering a colleague with whom he was having an affair.\n\nA solid supporting cast for this eight-part Apple+ series looks like Ruth Negga, Bill Camp, Lily Rabe and Peter Sarsgaard, amongst others, in what promises to be one of the standout thrillers of the year.\n\nMr & Mrs Smith\n\nWhen it’s on: Available now.\n\nWhere to watch it: Prime Video.\n\nDoug Liman’s 2005 film Mr & Mrs Smith is a fun action romp, although it’s better remembered as the film where Brad Pitt met Angelina Jolie (which led to the end of Pitt’s marriage to Jennifer Aniston). In 2024, we can hopefully enjoy the story with none of the same distractions. And this time it’s a TV show.\n\nShowing on Prime Video, the small screen version stars Atlanta’s Donald Glover (who co-created the series) and PEN15 star Maya Erskine as John and Jane Smith. That’s a fun pairing, but it’s the supporting cast that really stands out. Joining Glover and Erskine are John Turturro, Wagner Moura, Parker Posey, Paul Dano and Michaela Coel.\n\nA Cruel Story: The Ruth Ellis Story\n\nWhen it’s on: TBC.\n\nWhere to watch it: ITV1 or ITVX.\n\nThe four-part ITV drama Ruth is all about the life of Ruth Ellis, the last woman to be hanged in Britain. It’s set in 1955 and stars Lucy Boynton (The Ipcress File, Lewis) as the lead.\n\nRuth’s story, which is divided into two parallel timelines, illuminates the life of one of Britain’s most notorious murderers while also revealing long-kept secrets about the case and what actually transpired in the months leading up to Ruth’s murder of her lover David Blakely.\n\nLove crime dramas? You’ll love these reads…\n\nTrue Detective: Night Country\n\nWhen it’s on: Available now.\n\nWhere to watch it: Sky Atlantic.\n\nThe latest True Detective offers up a standalone story, unconnected to the wider mythology of the previous series. It’s a female-led series, with the two (true) detectives heading up the central investigation a nice mixture of Hollywood royalty (the legend that is Jodie Foster) and a relative acting rookie (former boxer Kali Reis).\n\nMexican producer, director and writer Issa López is in the showrunning hotseat for Night Country, marking the first time that series creator Nic Pizzolatto won’t be overseeing things. The cast is fleshed out nicely by some top names too. Look out for Killing Eve‘s Fiona Shaw, The Leftovers‘ Christopher Eccleston and Too Old to Die Young‘s John Hawkes.\n\nThe series is set in the fictional town of Ennis in Alaska and follows an investigation into the mysterious disappearance of a group of men from a research station.\n\nGriselda\n\nWhen it’s on: Available now.\n\nWhere to watch it: Netflix.\n\nGriselda Blanco was a fearsome Colombian drug lord (or should that be lady?) who ruled the Miami drug trade in the 1980’s with an iron fist. The incredibly true story of ‘The Godmother of Cocaine’ is now a six-part Netflix series.\n\nModern Family’s Sofía Vergara plays Blanco in a series that promises much, given it’s from the same team that worked on Netflix’s Pablo Escobar smash hit series Narcos.\n\nLady in the Lake\n\nWhen it’s on: TBC.\n\nWhere to watch it: Apple TV+.\n\nWhile we’re talking about high-end crime thrillers showing on Apple+ and starring A-list Hollywood stars, let’s talk about Lady in the Lake. An adaptation of Laura Lippman’s popular 2019 novel of the same name, Natalie Portman (Black Swan, Leon, Annihilation) heads up the cast of this intriguing seven-parter.\n\nSet in 1960’s Baltimore, a bored but determined housewife decides to take up a new career as a dogged investigative journalist. In the noir-tinged miniseries, we follow her as she dives deep into the murky waters of a case involving a missing black woman that far too many people in the city seem keen to forget about.\n\nProtection\n\nWhen it’s on: TBC.\n\nWhere to watch it: ITV1 and ITVX.\n\nITV’s sacred 9pm crime drama slot looks set to be well filled again in 2024, with a raft of quality shows on their way. One such show follows the story of a witness protection officer whose professional and personal lives are affected when she’s discovered having an affair with a colleague.\n\nIt’s a set-up not unlike the first series of another 9pm ITV series, The Bay. But with Siobhan Finneran and her Happy Valley co-star Katherine Kelly heading things up, we’re certain there will be plenty to make Protection worthy of our time.\n\nScreenwriter Kris Mrksa is behind the project. With a CV boasting the likes of No Escape, White House Farm and The Slap, we have high hopes for this drama.\n\nCriminal Record\n\nWhen it’s on: Available now.\n\nWhere to watch it: Apple TV+.\n\nDoctor Who‘s Peter Capaldi and The Good Wife‘s Cush Jumbo are both big enough names to make this eight-part series beep loudly on our crime drama radar. Throw Charlie Creed-Miles, Cathy Tyson, Shaun Dooley and Zoë Wanamaker into the mix, and it’s a solid cast.\n\nAs for the plot? Well, it’s a classic set-up: an experienced detective and a rookie clash when forced to work together on a murder. The creator of Channel 4’s Indian Summers Paul Rutman writes and produces.\n\nMr Bates vs. The Post Office\n\nWhen it’s on: Available now.\n\nWhere to watch it: ITV1 or ITVX.\n\nBased on a shocking true story, this ITV1 series tells the story of one this country’s worst ever miscarriages of justice: one that saw hundreds of people who ran Post Offices wrongly convicted, fined and imprisoned for theft and fraud after a computer glitch suggested they’d all been syphoning money from their takings.\n\nThe series stars Toby Jones, Julie Hesmondhalgh, Lia Williams, Alex Jennings, Monica Dolan, Ian Hart, Katherine Kelly, Shaun Dooley and Will Mellor. While it might not be one of the dark dramas full of dead bodies and moody shots of the woods we all know and love, it’s a tale well worth being told.\n\nFool Me Once\n\nWhen it’s on: Available now.\n\nWhere to watch it: Netflix.\n\nNetflix loves a Harlan Coben adaptation. Their latest was written for the screen by BAFTA-winning Brassic creator Danny Brocklehurst. Michelle Keegan, Richard Armitage, Joanna Lumley and Adeel Akhtar star.\n\nThe story follows former soldier Maya (Keegan), who is shocked to see her murdered husband on a secret nanny cam in her home. Soon enough, a deadly conspiracy unravels. It’s based on Coben’s popular 2016 novel of the same name and is every bit as twisting and turning as Netflix’s other Coben offerings.\n\nDon’t miss our round-up of the best shows on Netflix to watch now.\n\nHave we missed anything? If you’re looking forward to a TV crime drama in 2024 that we’ve missed off our list, tell us all about it in the comments below…\n\nLove crime dramas? You’ll love these reads…"
