        "text": "Bel Ami\n\nIf the goal of Bel Ami was to capture a fleeting flavor of Dangerous Liaisons, the intention should be deemed a failure. Based on Guy de Maupassant's 1885 novel, Bel Ami is the meandering, unfocused tale of the rise of an unprincipled opportunist i...\n\nDarkest Hour\n\nIt has been a good year for movies related to the 1940 evacuation from Dunkirk. Combined with Christopher Nolan’s Dunkirk (about the actual events) and Lone Scherfig’s Their Finest (about a clumsy propaganda film made about the situation), ...\n\nEasy Virtue\n\nFrom Stephan Elliott, the man who brought us The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert comes Easy Virtue, an adaptation of Noel Coward's play. Written in 1924, this was the playwright's 16th play, and was originally filmed in 1928 by Alfred ...\n\nEnglish Patient, The\n\nFor those who have forgotten the depth of romance and passion that the movies are capable of conveying, Anthony Minghella's The English Patient can remedy the situation.

It's about how a shared past can inform present expectations and about whether relationships can bridge a gulf of years and extend beyond a tragedy that...\n\nInvisible Woman, The\n\nAuthor Charles Dickens was enough of a celebrity to excite the interest of the gossip press of his day. Recognizing this, Dickens was careful to keep the nature of his relationship with young actress Ellen Ternan as far from the spotlight as possib...\n\nOther Boleyn Girl, The\n\nHistorical dramas aren't as popular as they were during the years when they were routinely clogging Oscar nomination lists and taking home awards, so it's a source of curiosity every time one comes out to see what concessions have been made to incr...\n\nParty, The\n\nSally Potter’s quirky The Party owes a lot to a generation’s worth of French “gathering” films in which a bunch of characters come together for dinner (or something similar) and all hell breaks loose.
