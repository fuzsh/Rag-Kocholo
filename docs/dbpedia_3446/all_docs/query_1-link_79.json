        "text": "From the actress who portrayed Harry Potter’s first love interest to a recreational boxer and a MASTERPIECE fan favorite, find out about the stars of the TV crime drama Annika. Learn what they think of their characters, where you’ve seen them before, and discover something you wouldn’t guess about each.\n\nWatch Annika now on PBS Passport, an added member benefit.\n\n1.\n\nNicola Walker as DI Annika Strandhed\n\nHer Character: DI Strandhed is the wry and irrepressible head of Glasgow’s new Marine Homicide Unit, who has a weakness for using literary and historical references to help solve crimes.\n\nOn the Role: “As everyone knows, I’ve played a lot of detectives over the years,” says Walker. “But I’ve been Annika for a long time now [seven years on BBC Radio 4], and if there was a chance of getting her fully fleshed out in a real-world environment, I wanted to be part of it.”\n\nFun Fact: Walker got her motorboat pilot license for the series and her own family followed suit! “My husband and son were so jealous that they went out and got licensees as well,” the actor tells TV Insider, noting it’s unclear what they’ll do with them. “We live in a completely landlocked area in the south of England.”\n\nWhere You’ve Seen Her: Annika’s star is no stranger to fans of Unforgotten on MASTERPIECE. Nicola Walker’s role as DCI Cassie Stuart was consistently lauded over four seasons. She’s also well known for Last Tango in Halifax, three seasons of The Split as a divorce attorney, and a whopping 10 seasons on the espionage series, Spooks.\n\n2.\n\nJamie Sives as DS Michael McAndrews\n\nHis Character: Sives plays the Marine Homicide Unit’s search diver, DS McAndrews. His character imagined he was a shoo-in for the lead job Annika actually gets and his nose is a bit out of joint about it.\n\nOn the Role: Michael’s “quite a louche, laconic,” says Sives. “He doesn’t take things too seriously, but when the stuff hits the fan, he instantly jumps into action.” His character dives into the water quite a bit but “being Scottish, I’ve jumped into a fair few lochs in my time! …[it’s] apparently good for you.”\n\nFun Fact: Turns out this Edinburgh native is just at home in the boxing ring as he is on a set. He’s trained for years at Lochend Boxing Club, around the corner from where he grew up. He tells The Scotsman he finds both release and restraint in the sport. “I’ve never had a bout in my life or boxed competitively,” Sives says. “I’ve sparred a lot, mainly with friends and I love that. Bombs could be dropping outside, and you would not care. You’ve just got total focus on the guy that’s gonna hit you. It’s an amazing discipline.”\n\nWhere You’ve Seen Him: MASTERPIECE Mystery! fans may recognize Sives from his role as the likeable, rumpled McCall brother in the Scottish thriller Guilt airing for two seasons on PBS. Sives is an actor, producer, and director. He has a long list of film and TV credits including roles in Crime and Game of Thrones.\n\n3.\n\nKatie Leung as DC Blair Ferguson\n\nHer Character: The brilliant and quirky DC Ferguson is the team’s analyst, parsing data and finessing technology during cases. She has a strange sense of humor that no one gets, but that doesn’t bother her.\n\nOn the Role: “Being Scottish, working in Scotland with Nicola [Walker], and having the chance to play a combination drama and comedy, all that really appealed,” says Leung. And her character “is brilliant, easily the most intelligent person on the team. …Annika is the only one who would make Blair feel she has to up her game.”\n\nFun Fact: Leung rose to fame in 2005 after playing Cho Chang, Harry Potter’s first love interest in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. She was 16 years old when cast and allegedly beat out over 3,000 other girls to land the part.\n\nWhere You’ve Seen Her: Since the Harry Potter films, Leung has appeared on both stage and television. Her TV credits range from Roadkill on MASTERPIECE to episodes of Father Brown and Poirot to the animated action series Arcane.\n\n4.\n\nUkweli Roach as DS Tyrone Clarke\n\nHis Character: DS Clarke comes to the Marine Homicide Unit straight out of border command where he patrolled for illegal drug smuggling. He’s looking for a different role and is fascinated by the idea of working under the offbeat DCI Strandhed. He’s not a very good team player, however.\n\nOn the Role: Roach was drawn to the project because “it [offered] a great chance to play a character type I’d not portrayed before. I’d also never done a police procedural or been part of a team, so Annika was a really good challenge for me,” he says.\n\nFun Fact: This young actor has been a dance devotee since childhood and is an accomplished avant garde dance and hip-hop performer. He’s co-Artistic Director for BirdGang Dance Company and has lent his talents to pop videos for both Mariah Carey and Kylie Minogue.\n\nWhere You’ve Seen Him: Die-hard MASTERPIECE Mystery! fans may recall Roach’s portrayal of Johnny Johnson, the boyfriend of Sidney Chamber’s sister in Grantchester’s premiere season. More recently, Roach has appeared in the series Death in Paradise and Blindspot.\n\n5.\n\nPaul McGann as Therapist Jake Strathearn\n\nHis Character: Dr. Jake Strathearn is Morgan Strandhed’s therapist-turned-love-interest for Annika.
