        "text": "Republic Pictures has released the trailer for a new crime thriller film titled The Silent Hour, which comes from director Brad Anderson. I’m a fan of Anderson and he’s directed films such as Session 9, The Machinist, Transsiberian, and Vanishing on 7th Street.\n\nThe movie stars Joel Kinnaman as Boston Det. Frank Shaw, “who returns to duty after a career-altering injury leaves him with permanent hearing loss.\n\n“Tasked with interpreting for Ava (Sandra Mae Frank), a deaf witness to a brutal gang murder, they find themselves cornered in a soon-to-be-condemned apartment building when the killers return to get rid of her.\n\n“Now cut off from the outside world, these two strangers must lean on each other to outsmart killers they can’t hear coming for their only hope of making it out alive.”\n\nThe movie also stars Sandra Mae Frank, Mekhi Phifer, Michael Eklund, and Mark Strong. It looks like it could be a good movie! As a fan of Anderson’s work, I’ll definitely be checking it out.\n\nThe Silent Hour will be released in select US theaters and on VOD on October 11th, 2024."
