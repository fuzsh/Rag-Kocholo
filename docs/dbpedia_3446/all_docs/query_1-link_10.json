        "text": "Alain Corneau, the French director who died in 2010 at the age of 67, shortly after completing this glossy thriller, was little known in Britain. After working as an assistant to Costa-Gavras he made some notable crime movies, including Choice of Arms (starring Yves Montand) and Série noire, a transposition of Jim Thompson's pulp novel A Hell of a Woman from Chicago to suburban Paris starring Patrick Dewaere. But his masterpiece is the stately 1991 Tous les matins du monde, featuring Depardieu père et fils and set in the world of 17th-century baroque musicians.\n\nAlready remade by Brian De Palma as Passion, Love Crime starts well as a psychological drama in which two highfliers – bitchy, sadistic Christine (Kristin Scott Thomas) and seemingly submissive Isabelle (Ludivine Sagnier) – come into conflict as their heads batter the glass ceiling of the American multinational they work for in Paris. It goes badly off course, however, when it suddenly switches into a tricksy thriller. The central performances are compelling but the two American characters are wholly unconvincing."
