        "text": "Jessica Campbell looks back across the representational abyss of lesbian cinema to review the mimetic desires of Crime d’amour.\n\nBefore sitting down to watch Crime d’amour again after ten years, I remembered workplace drama, triangulation, and something murdery involving a scarf. That is to say, I was hazy on the plot. I remembered liking this movie, directed by Alain Corneau, and disliking the remake that Brian De Palma put out only a year later under the title Passion. I believe I originally watched it by myself, at home, just a few months after it was released in theaters. Primarily, I remembered being excited, as a budding queer, about the queer elements of the love/revenge triangle at the film’s center. How queer would it seem in 2021, and would it seem problematic in ways I hadn’t noticed before?\n\nStill queer, but yes.\n\nCrime d’amour’s central character is Isabelle (Ludivine Sagnier), a young woman who works in the Paris office of a multinational corporation and seems to do little else. She has an intense relationship with Christine (Kristin Scott Thomas), her superior, who mentors her, sexually harasses her, compliments her, takes credit for her work, and otherwise wreaks havoc on her emotions. The final point of the triangle is Philippe (Patrick Mille), yet another employee in their office and currently Christine’s boyfriend, though we soon see him sleeping with Isabelle as well. The first half of the film has Christine, Isabelle, and Philippe jockeying for position in their personal and professional relationships. Meetings are held, lavish parties are attended, companionship is dangled then withdrawn, sex is had (though never quite by Christine and Isabelle), tricks are played (usually by Christine on Isabelle or Philippe). Ultimately Isabelle is so furious with Christine that she murders her, having hatched an elaborate plan in which she actually confesses to the murder, goes to prison, then blames the confession on having taken too many pills and ultimately gets off scot-free, having framed Philippe by means of an incriminating scarf. Seemingly at the height of renewed and indeed increased professional status, Isabelle is shocked to be told by her assistant, Daniel, that he knows she did it. Curtain.\n\nI rewatched the Brian De Palma version, too, and this time around I liked Crime d’amour somewhat less and Passion somewhat more, though I think they’re both flawed. Passion is a little more fun and looks shinier, but it makes less sense psychologically and the visuals contain less information than they do in Corneau’s version. Spaces and colors tell an important part of the story in Crime d’amour. The office looks claustrophobic; the individual offices aren’t as huge as they could be for people of that stature, and we never get a sense of the whole space. By contrast, Isabelle’s house seems too big. There’s too much space and not enough stuff, two sinks in the bathroom but only one of her. The colors seem somehow tired, a mix of black, gray, and white, not much different from the colors at the office. For all the time the movie spends on her, Isabelle is an underwritten character, but the construction of her environment as empty, colorless, impeccably clean, and indistinguishable from work does shed some light on her behavior.\n\nI’ve never been a big fan of Ludivine Sagnier’s; as far as I can tell, she’s fine in good movies (see 8 Women) and disappointing in disappointing movies (see A Girl Cut in Two). In Crime d’amour, the come-hither/childish/deer-in-the-headlights look she often has is there underneath an often-blank expression that is, I think, supposed to convey how disturbed Isabelle is and, for a while, how drugged she wants people to believe she is. Sagnier is playing an underwritten character, so I’m not sure what else she could have done to improve matters; still, I can’t help wondering what a stronger screen actress, like Mélanie Laurent, might have come up with. Considering the drastic things Isabel is doing in the second part of the film, I would have liked a little more help in understanding why.\n\nKristin Scott Thomas, however, is phenomenal. It was fun to watch her speaking fluent French in French films for a few years; I didn’t learn until recently that she was living in France because she had married a French doctor. In any language, she dazzles. I rewatched The English Patient about a year ago for the first time in a long time, and it held up well in several respects, one of which was the central performances. And of course, more recently, the episode of Fleabag in which Thomas guest stars stands out even in a season that seems composed almost entirely of highlights. In Crime d’amour, Thomas effectively conveys the dizzying vacillation between charm and ruthlessness with which Christine relates to other people in her professional and personal lives. (Rachel McAdams is also quite strong in this role in the remake—I increasingly believe she’s underrated.) One problem with the second half of the film is Christine’s absence from it.\n\nIt’s clear from the first scene of Crime d’amour, in which the two women are working late together at Christine’s house (red flag), that Isabelle looks up to Christine professionally and is very emotionally affected by her. It’s also clear that Christine is sexually harassing her: She tells her she’s pretty when she laughs, she touches her shoulders, she kisses her neck. Isabelle admires Christine’s scarf, Christine gives it to her. (So much sexual harassment in this film. More than I remembered—I fear I may have been guilty of excusing some of it as “just French” at the time.) “To us!” Isabelle boldly suggests as a toast when Christine pours glasses of wine for them both. “If you like, to us,” Christine responds casually. The Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away. Soon Philippe arrives, to be ostentatiously kissed by Christine as Isabelle looks on uncomfortably and prepares to beat a hasty retreat. And so the game pieces are laid out: Christine and Isabelle are engaged in some kind of seduction and/or competition, which Christine is currently winning, and Philippe can serve as a convenient pawn if necessary. By the end of the film, Isabelle will have managed to change places with Christine in precisely the same game, having killed Christine and shifted the blame to Philippe.\n\nI was interested in writing this review partly in order to think through this triangulation. Crime d’amour is a textbook case of triangular desire or “mimetic desire” as theorists like René Girard describe it. In other words, Person A desires Person B, and Person C wants to be Person A, so Person C conceives a desire for B as well. But Girard insists that C’s desire to be A is more fundamental than their desire for B, and I agree with him. In some cases at least, and Crime d’amour is certainly one of them. Isabelle wants to be Christine, and Christine desires Philippe and prestige at the company, so Isabelle desires those things too. Moreover, the boundary between wanting to be someone and wanting them can be very blurry. Girard’s triangle of mimetic desire is thus particularly helpful for describing queer stuff in texts that come out of cultures that repress queerness (which is most of them, of course, but some more than others). Subsuming desire for someone into admiration of them is a convenient way to acknowledge and not acknowledge those strong feelings simultaneously.\n\nThis isn’t to say that all aspects of those feelings can’t be valid; Isabelle is clearly genuinely dedicated to her work, and she seems genuinely attracted to Philippe as well. It’s Christine, not Isabelle, who pushes his face away in the middle of lovemaking in the film’s second scene. The trouble is precisely Isabelle wants it all—she wants Christine’s lover and her job, and she also wants Christine to admire and love her. According to Girard, this kind of situation pretty much always leads to violence. Christine ups the ante when she sees that Isabelle is getting too close to appropriating the objects of her own desire (well, she doesn’t seem too concerned about Philippe, but she is livid when Isabelle one-ups her at work). She sets up a double humiliation: First, she persuades Philippe to pretend to set up a rendezvous in the office after hours with Isabelle, then calls her herself at the appointed time and boasts that Philippe is really with her. Isabelle unravels emotionally in response, crying in the elevator, crashing her car against a post in the employee garage, and tearfully kicking the car in response. Soon enough, Christine organizes a work party at which she shows all the other executives the office security camera footage of Isabelle’s meltdown. It’s apparently at this point that Isabelle ups the ante herself and begins to plot the murder.\n\nIt occurred to me while watching Crime d’amour that it’s a little like Working Girl, only gayer. The supreme object of the mimetic desire seems to be professional success—and, specifically, professional success in a very sterile and very male environment. This is in large part a workplace drama, featuring impeccably dressed professionals moving through well-appointed conference rooms and corner offices with huge windows, though the script is hilariously vague about what work they actually do. Scenes of meetings feature a sea of white men in suits, joined by two white women—Christine and Isabelle. We see no other female executives and nearly no other female employees at all. When Isabelle steps away from a lunch table at which she had been popping pills, the men discuss the fact that Isabelle’s predecessor, “Elena,” ended up in a mental hospital. Unsurprisingly, they associate femininity with insanity; whether the movie ultimately avoids creating the same association is up for debate.\n\nThe phrase “crime d’amour” is the French legal term equivalent to our “crime of passion.” (For which reason I’ve always hated the translated title “Love Crime,” which doesn’t convey the same dual meaning and somehow sounds sillier.) But the irony is that Isabelle’s crime is in one sense quite the opposite of a crime of passion: she turns out to have made and executed an elaborate plan to murder Christine without paying for it. The murder itself happens only halfway into the movie; the entire second half follows Isabelle’s arrest, imprisonment, and finally exoneration. In Corneau’s telling, the viewer has time to doubt whether everything really is going according to plan. Specifically, we don’t know whether going to prison herself was part of the design, and she spends a decent chunk of the movie languishing there. Ultimately, it is revealed that Isabelle had indeed set up a long game and played it almost perfectly: The incriminating scarf is found in Philippe’s car and Isabelle returns to her home and her professional position. Brian De Palma’s version of this sequence is snappier but might be confusing to a viewer unfamiliar with the original. I can’t help wondering whether the story might make more sense if it featured a true “crime of passion.”\n\nAfter all, I also can’t help wondering whether I really buy that Isabelle would go through all this just to get revenge on Christine. What has she done to her? Humiliated her, yes, but the video Christine shows isn’t that bad. Nor is the staged abandonment by Philippe, who makes clear that he was blackmailed into doing it. These are nasty tricks, but not enough to warrant murder. How weird is Isabelle? We know that she goes for intense runs in order to clear her mind, and we know that she lives in an impeccably tidy house that is too big for one person and unsettlingly plain. We know that she’s a single woman. We know that she’s some version of bi. You can see where I’m going with this. Precisely because of the intricacy and deliberateness of Isabelle’s plan, it’s hard not to end up at an interpretation that career women are just crazy or that unnatural passions lead to unnatural crimes. If Isabelle had smacked Christine with one of her fancy lamps or sculptures at the end of a tense day, nobody who’s ever been strung out would find it unbelievable. But premeditated murder requires some more motivation, and if the film and the acting don’t provide it, viewers are going to lean on the first stereotype that comes to mind.\n\nSo does Isabelle kill Christine because she loves her and can neither be her nor have her? Is this a Talented Mr. Ripley situation? Maybe—and if we consider that Isabelle’s crime is by no means a “crime d’amour” in the legal sense, then this is precisely the explanation. Love makes you do crazy things. All that Christine really seems to desire is getting promoted to the New York office; her personal relationships all feel calculated and opportunistic. Despite all the lines of dialogue about what Isabelle would do if she were “in Christine’s place” in various situations, it would seem that ultimately the two women are not the same at all. Because Isabelle clearly takes it all way too seriously and way too hard. Christine has evidently trained herself beyond feelings; Isabelle seems often overborne by hers, even when she is ostensibly acting calmly. She is supposedly doing what Christine would do in seizing her chance, but to what end? Even before the murder, Isabelle has managed, with the help of her assistant, to mess up Christine’s chances of promotion by scoring a professional victory behind her back. She doesn’t need to kill Christine to do well at this company; there’s no indication that the humiliating video actually changes any of her coworkers’ attitudes toward her. Nor does Isabelle seem to have any interest in winning back Philippe—on the contrary, she frames him for Christine’s murder. Christine’s machinations all pointed to a distinct goal; Isabelle’s only make sense as an expression of feeling. It really is a crime of passion, in every sense of the word.\n\nThe ending of Crime d’amour is essentially the ending of All About Eve, which I love. (Anyone who’s reading this who hasn’t seen All About Eve, do it now. First, because it’s a masterpiece and a delight, and second, because it too is about triangulation, actually, and Patricia White has a great chapter in Uninvited doing a queer reading of it.) Interestingly, Crime d’amour’s “Phoebe” is a man—Daniel, Isabelle’s assistant. Having watched her closely and urged her to be less loyal to Christine throughout the first half of the film, he is instrumental in her release from prison. But he turns out to have observed her so closely as to have discovered that the pills she had been taking so conspicuously at work were fake. Daniel puts the pieces together and confronts Isabelle in the film’s last scene with his knowledge of what she has done, telling her that he has no intention of turning her in…“for now.” Clearly, in one sense, Isabelle has stepped into Christine’s role and Daniel into hers. But Daniel goes on to remark, “You’ll never be like her. She was capable of killing, but not for love.” He may be right.\n\nAny romantic interest in Isabelle on Daniel’s part remains implicit; in De Palma’s Passion, though, Isabelle’s assistant is a lesbian, Dani, who ultimately demands a sexual relationship in exchange for keeping quiet about the murder (rather like Addison DeWitt, speaking of All About Eve—which I do as often as possible). It’s thus even clearer in De Palma’s version than Corneau’s that sexuality is always exploitative in this group, from the boss down to the assistant. De Palma’s Christine knows Dani is pining for Isabelle and confronts her with that knowledge, calling her a dyke and threatening to accuse her of sexual assault (against Christine) if she doesn’t stop getting in Christine’s way. As is his wont, De Palma really amps up the sexual harassment as well as the queerness. But unlike Daniel, Dani is dead by the end, murdered by Isabelle in a rather thrilling but ultimately baffling final sequence De Palma adds in which Christine’s long-lost twin sister shows up at her funeral and then at Isabelle’s door hot on the heels of the prosecutor Isabelle thinks Dani has just called, hence the murdering, although the twin’s second appearance turns out to have been a dream—I think. It doesn’t make a whole lot of sense, but we do know for sure that the lesbian is dead. Even so, De Palma’s addition made me wish the whole film had been more in that vein, campy and shot on a diagonal and punctuated by doppelgängers with menacing lipstick. (More Black Swan, I suppose, but with less ballet trauma.)\n\nAbove all, though, watching Crime d’amour ten years later makes me furious—not because of the film itself but because it’s staggering to realize how tiny the crumbs of female homoeroticism could be and still feel like a gift. This middling French workplace thriller was among the first films I watched that actually depicted two women with explicit sexual desire for each other. That’s absurd. It isn’t that actual lesbian films didn’t exist in 2011. They did. They’ve existed at least since Mädchen in Uniform, a superb 1931 German film I looked for in vain for over a decade and finally accessed when Kino Lorber released it on DVD last summer. In the last five years or so, I’ve discovered several films from the ’80s and ’90s that feature queer women and portray them the way we’d want them to today—alive, for example. These films just don’t get promoted, don’t get distributed, don’t get mentioned in Entertainment Weekly. Some of them are getting easier to access now, and obviously there’s been some great new content since 2011, too. When Blue is the Warmest Color came out to much fanfare and controversy in 2013, I used to joke, “It’s a three-hour French lesbian film. It’s like it was made just for me.” This astonishes me now. Blue is the Warmest Color isn’t my style at all; a ton of it is just voyeuristically filmed sex, and the characters aren’t the kind of people I’d be interested in in real life. I didn’t know it was possible to feel that a film was made for me as much as I did when I first watched Portrait of a Lady on Fire and Wild Nights with Emily. I have adored movies my whole life, and the fact that the characters are straight doesn’t make me like Casablanca or The Umbrellas of Cherbourg any less. But it’s no revelation to say that representation matters an awful lot, and I can’t help wondering how different my life could have been if I hadn’t had to wait so long. As melodramatic as it sounds to say so, I am a different person after Portrait of a Lady on Fire than I was before, and looking across the abyss to Crime d’amour, well—it’s a bit of a shock.\n\nSo I don’t, in the end, particularly recommend that you seek out Crime d’amour. It’s okay, but there are better French thrillers, better Kristin Scott Thomas roles, and better love/revenge triangles to be found. And help me remember never again to be satisfied that something like this counts as queer representation."
