        "text": "Kristin Scott Thomas has revealed that her one-episode turn in Fleabag was “probably the happiest” moment of her career.\n\nThe actress, who is promoting her new Netflix film Rebecca, told NME in a video interview that she was “really, really pleased” Fleabag creator Phoebe Waller-Bridge called her up for a role.\n\n“I was a huge Fleabag fan…I thought it’s a work of total genius,” Thomas told NME. So when she wrote to me to ask me to do it, I think that was probably the happiest I’ve ever been.”\n\nThomas portrayed Belinda in season two episode three of Fleabag, which aired last year. Belinda is a successful businesswoman who meets Fleabag (Phoebe Waller-Bridge) at an awards ceremony presented by Fleabag’s sister, Claire. The pair have a profound conversation at a bar about female pain.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe actress plays Mrs Danvers in Rebecca, a new adaptation of Daphne du Maurier’s romantic thriller, directed by Ben Wheatley.\n\nIn a three-star review of the movie, NME‘s Alex Flood wrote: “mediocrity is this Netflix murder mystery’s greatest crime”, adding that the modern remake is “frustratingly fine – and when there are so many other, better versions of this story available [it’s] not quite good enough.\n\nRecommended\n\n“With five films, seven TV shows and a host of radio dramas out there already, Rebecca probably doesn’t need another adaptation. Yet remarkably, Daphne du Maurier’s 1938 gothic romance is still popular 80 years after it first found a place on the nation’s bookshelf. Ben Wheatley’s new Netflix take isn’t the best version you’ll see, but it’s also not the worst.”"
