        "text": "Kristin Scott Thomas has a bee in her bonnet. Actually, she has several bees in her bonnet. It’s more like a beehive than a bonnet. ‘British cinema is at death’s door,’ she rages. ‘Funding is a real issue. But people just aren’t making the right decisions about what gets made.’I’m speaking to her at her home in Paris, in theory to discuss her latest film, French thriller Tell No One. But talking about French films has got us talking about British films and talking about British films gets her hopping mad.\n\nIt’s all to do with America. It’s so difficult to get financing for films in Britain, she explains, that filmmakers have to go cap in hand to the States. But projects given the green light in America are pale products. That is how our industry is ‘being bridled’, she tells me.\n\nOne of the reasons that she finds the current state of affairs so frustrating is that we always seem to be turning the corner, standing on our own two feet, only to stumble and we’re back in the same old hopeless situation.\n\n‘There always seems to be a renaissance,’ she sighs. ‘Like a phoenix, the British film industry keeps coming back. Every ten or fifteen years, everyone says ‘we’re off’. And then we’re off for about a week. And then we die again. So it gets just a little bit depressing.’\n\nMaybe, the problem is that we just can’t make good British films any more, I suggest.\n\n‘No, no, no,’ she snaps. ‘There are wonderful British films being made, there just aren’t enough of them, because they don’t have the means to make them. I mean, why isn’t Stephen Frears churning one out all the time? His films are fantastic. As are Mike Leigh’s. There are lots of fantastic people who make great films in England. I just wish that there were allowed to make more of them. That’s all. I’m not saying that there’s no talent in England. It’s just that everyone has to go to America – that’s where films get swallowed up.’\n\nInterviewing Kristin Scott Thomas comes with a safety warning. Famously brittle, she left one interviewer feeling the onset of a panic attack, as she ‘stonewalled every personal proffered, gazing off into the distance’. Another recent interviewer noted that while she could be ‘warm and intimate’, she also had a distinct tendency to be ‘chilly and remote’. Even Hugh Grant, working with her on Bitter Moon in 1992, recalled how he had to shake her out of a sulk each day before filming: ‘it takes not more than five or 10 minutes, but you’d have to do it every morning, like yoga’.\n\nThankfully, she’s in buoyant spirits today. She’s full of gusto as she puts the world, at least the film world, to rights. She’s often full of sunshine, in fact, especially for fellow actors and their work, describing them as ‘extraordinary’ or ‘fantastic’ in that rather aristocratic way of using overblown adjectives.\n\nHer mood is forthright. She delivers her tirade about the British film industry with zeal – a kind of dejected zeal, if you will, half impassioned, half stricken with grief. She even feels the need to apologise afterwards. ‘Sorry, if I’m sounding strident.’\n\nKristin Scott Thomas is famous for playing cold beauties. Words with wintry connotations get trotted out to describe her on screen presence: glacial, icy, frosty and so on. It’s something of a cliché, but she can do roles with an arctic aplomb.Think of her in her breakthrough role as Katherine Clifton in The English Patient, the elegant but emotionally anaemic wife of an English buffoon who embarks on an affair with a hypnotized Ralph Fiennes. Or in The Horse Whisperer, as a former New York magazine editor, careerist and pushy, who heads off to Montana in the hope that a healer of horses can help her traumatized daughter, played by a very young Scarlett Johansson. Or in her most glacial performance so far, as the bored, rich but stern seductress wife of Michael Gambon in Robert Altman’s Gosford Park.\n\nI wonder if this is something she takes a wicked pleasure in. Actors often say that the most delicious roles are the ones with a villainous streak. Does she relish playing the frosty female?\n\n‘Yeah, sort of,’ she says after a long pause. ‘Well, I enjoy acting full stop. I like being in front of a camera, I like being enthusiastic as well. But I’m quite confident in my frostiness. It’s something I know I can do. But I suppose I can kill with a look.\n\nHer latest film, Tell No One, sees her veering away from ice maiden territory. She plays a lesbian with a bohemian lifestyle, partial to puffing joints in the evening. The director of the film, Guillaume Canet (also an actor, best known as the heartthrob Frenchman in The Beach) says that Scott Thomas ‘has played so many aloof, conventional women that I liked the idea of her letting her hair down a bit.’Is that how she felt? Did she like the idea of loosening up a bit?\n\n‘Well, for some reason in England I’m not allowed to play these roles,’ she says, miffed. ‘In France, I find directors have more imagination. I like the roles I get asked to play in France. And I’m proud of the films I make here.’\n\nThis is not Scott Thomas’ first French film. A quick glance at the Internet Movie Database shows that she’s made at least as many French films as British or American ones. She admits, though, that she prefers acting in English.\n\n‘It’s easier to act in your mother tongue,’ she says. ‘It’s more of an exercise to act in French. I do find it quite draining. It’s harder work. But it’s just the physical speaking of another language.’\n\nScott Thomas is no stranger to the French language, having lived in Paris since she was 19. After Cheltenham Ladies College, she fled the UK to discover the French capital, an exotic, shangri la-like destination in the mind of an adventure-thirsty teenager, she says.\n\n‘Kids these days go off on gap years, jet off to Thailand or wherever. People didn’t do that when I was that age. I went to France. I mean, everyone wants to do stuff like that when they’re that age. Who doesn’t want to run away to Paris when you’re 19?’\n\nShe admits that she was fairly wretched at the time. She had started at drama school in the UK, but ‘wasn’t doing what she wanted to do’, she says, rather mysteriously, not explaining what she was doing exactly, ‘so I did leave…but it was all sorts of funny reasons – being a miserable teenager was the main reason.’\n\nFollowing drama school in Paris, she soon started appearing in small French films and TV dramas, both French and British. She remains enthusiastic about television, calling it ‘the most fantastic, underused medium, where millions of people can watch what you’ve made, the stories that you’re telling. And I think that’s fantastic.’\n\nSomeone who is particularly ‘fantastic’ is Stephen Frears, who made his name as a director of television dramas during the seventies and eighties, before moving on to big screen productions, such as his recent triumph The Queen.\n\n‘I admire him so much, the way he has stuck to his guns,’ she says. ‘He’ll go off and make a film for television rather than go to America to get a movie made.’\n\nFor all her talk of the Americanisation of British movies, Kristin Scott Thomas made her name by starring in films that were hits in America. Four Weddings and a Funeral was one. It wasn’t the hugest of parts, playing posh, potty-mouthed Fiona but Scott Thomas says that ‘cameos like this’ bring their own rewards.\n\n‘In Four Weddings I had five scenes to nail it,’ she says, hammering out her verb. ‘And that’s a challenge. I enjoy that challenge. Also, to be honest, I enjoy these roles where you come in, do a few weeks work and then you go home. You’re not carrying the whole thing on your shoulders. It’s a sort of relief.’\n\nThe other was The English Patient, Anthony Mingella’s nine-Oscar-bejewelled epic which solidified Scott Thomas’ standing as A-list material. The film’s central premise – about an English pilot who crashes his plane – is a real life motif of Scott Thomas’ childhood. Her father was a pilot in the Royal Navy, but he died when she was five, after his plane crashed into the sea. Her mother re-married, again to an officer in the Fleet Air Arm, but, with grim repetition, her stepfather met the same fate: he died in a crash out at sea.\n\n‘The English Patient opened all the doors,’ she says. ‘But at the time, I was really torn between wanting to have a career in the theatre and a career on film. It’s very difficult to juggle both. The only person who does it really properly is Ralph Fiennes. Us women get the short straw really. We have so many other jobs to do.’\n\nWith brilliant timing, at this point her ten-year-old son Joseph bursts into the room, only to be given very short shrift by his mother. ‘I am doing an interview,’ she storms. ‘Shut the door. Oh, be quiet. They never knock, it just drives me mad.’\n\nScott Thomas was nominated for an Oscar for The English Patient, although she didn’t win. Her tone sounds jaded when she recalls the ceremony, acknowledging that ‘it’s obviously a very exciting event, you’re treated like a princess’ but that, when it comes to the award itself, it’s wrong to suppose that anyone other than the front-runner is going to take the statuette home.\n\n‘You know who’s going to win from the beginning. You pretend to be on tenterhooks, but in fact the odds are pretty sorted, really. But you have to go along with the game. ‘Oh, I’m so excited!’ But you know very well that you’re not going to win. But you have to play it.’\n\nWe start talking about Helen Mirren’s recent success at awards ceremony (‘hurrah! At last someone who deserves it’, she hoots, her voice soaring an octave or two) but, inevitably, we drift back to the topic of Hollywood’s shortcomings In Hollywood, ageism prevails, she says. Another reason why she prefers working in France.\n\n‘The huge success of people like Helen Mirren and Charlotte Rampling are changing the horizon slightly,’ she says, ‘but in France people have far more respect for people of my age. I refuse to call them ‘older’ because they’re not yet, but they are not bouncy 22-year-olds. I think that’s a very healthy environment to be doing one’s business in. I certainly prefer that to having to cope with the youth addiction thing that goes on in America and indeed in England because, well, as discussed, England is copying really.’\n\nLife in Paris treats Scott Thomas well. She likes to read, likes to potter about and she’s got a lot of friends there. ‘I like sitting about and chatting about the world’, she says. ‘Generally taking life easy. I like going to the theatre, I like going to the cinema, I like going to art shows and generally living the life of a lady of leisure.’\n\nIn spite of saying this, Scott Thomas has a busy schedule. She’s been doing a lot more stage work in London of late, most recently starring in The Seagull at The Royal Court. Critics were generous in their praise of her Arkadina and the production was due to travel to the West End, but Scott Thomas pulled out, saying that she wanted to spend more time with her family (demanding mob that they are).\n\nShe has two more films coming out, The Walker, in which she plays an American senator’s wife who gets embroiled in a romance (she had a ball with Woody Harrelson; apparently he is ‘extraordinary’). And she’s just made another film, The Other Boleyn Girl.\n\n‘Yes, I’ve just made this film with these two girls,’ she says. It turns out these ‘two girls’ to be Scarlett Johansson and Natalie Portman. ‘I was so thrilled to find Scarlett, having played her mother once, aeons ago in The Horse Whisperer, then to rediscover her eight years on and she’s turned into such an extraordinary actress. It’s really quite marvellous. And Natalie Portman is, is of course, quite breathtaking. That was a thrill, seeing the younger girls having their moment of glory. It was my turn once and now, it’s theirs.’"
