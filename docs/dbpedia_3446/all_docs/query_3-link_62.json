Combining cutting-edge design, illustration and journalism, we’ve been described as being “at the vanguard of the independent publishing movement.” Our reviews feature a unique tripartite ranking system that captures the different aspects of the movie-going experience. We believe in Truth & Movies.\n\nEditorial\n\nDavid Jenkins\n\nHannah Strong\n\nMarina Ashioti\n\nDesign\n\nLaurène Boglio"
