        "text": "“I'm going to make him an offer he can't refuse.”\n\n“First, you get the money, then you get the power, THEN you get the woman.”\n\n\"As far back as I can remember, I always wanted to be a gangster.”\n\nIt is hard to pick just one iconic line from a gangster movie. Movies about organized crime have been popular since the silent era and have enjoyed several resurgences over the decades. Whether they are about the Mafia, 1920s gangers, Yazuka, Triad or cartels, this action-packed genre comes in all shapes and sizes but shares the common thread of crime, intrigue and, yes, violence.\n\nTop Organized Crime Movies\n\nFrom Martin Scorsese to Quentin Tarantino to Takeshi Kitano, many directors have made iconic movies about organized crime. For this list, “Organized Crime” is defined broadly as while many of these films are about “mob-like” organizations, this list looks past the American Irish and Italian mafias to include other criminal groups such as the MS-13, The Crips, The Chinese Triad families and India’s Mafia Raj.\n\nIn many ways, the “Organized Crime” film genre isn’t well defined. While the top-grossing film in this genre is technically Taken, many would not consider it a “mafia” movie. This list omits several types of films that could technically called “Oringized crime films,” including bank robber films (like Bonnie and Clyde and Dog Dog Day Afternoon) as well as heist films (such as Ocean’s 11, Point Break and Inside Man.) However, many mob movies feature heists and bank robbing. While the difference between a crime film and an organized crime film is often a thin line, this list focuses on films that involve at least some involvement of a tiered criminal network.\n\n35. Get Carter (1971)\n\nBased on the Ted Lewis novel Jack’s Return Home, Get Carter tells the story of a London hitman who returns home for revenge following his brother’s suspicious death. The film stars a young Michael Caine. Get Carter is a gritty revenge narrative that is gloriously 1970s.\n\nIn 2004, Get Carter was named the No. 1 British Film by Total Film. In 1972, the Blacksplotation film Hit Man was also made based on Jack’s Return Home. However, Get Carter was far better received. In many ways, Get Carter is the blueprint for many other later British gangster films, especially when it comes to cold realism. The film is available to rent on YouTube, Google Play, Amazon Prime and Apple TV.\n\n34. The Public Enemy (1931)\n\nThe Public Enemy is a precode gangster movie about a mobster’s rise to power in Prohibition-era Chicago. The film stars James Cagney and Jean Harlow. Much of the film doesn’t age well. As early as 1941, several scenes had been removed due to the Hays Code. Some of the controversial scenes include an early representation of a gay tailor, the use of a mamie character, a sexual assault and a scene where Cagney shoves a grapefruit into the face of co-star Mae Clarke.\n\nWhile the film isn’t perfect, it is an excellent example of the wildly successful gangster drama in early Hollywood. While not his first gangster movie, it is one of many Cagney-led mob flicks that helped establish him and the genre. He would go on to star in Lady Killer, G' Men, Each Dawn I Die and White Heat. The Public Enemy is currently streaming for free on Tubi.\n\n33. Sin Nombre (2009)\n\nSin Nombre takes an unflinching and sensitive look at Central American gang life and immigration through Mexico. The film follows a new member of the Mara Salvatrucha (aka MS-13) after the gang turns on him and he journeys to the U.S. The film is brutal and includes sexual assault, gang violence, murder and the realities of migrants on the border.\n\nDirected by Cary Joji Fukunaga, the film stars Paulina Gaitán and Edgar Flores. Sin Nombre has a gritty realism to it, and members of the Mara Salvatrucha were consulted in the filmmaking process. Roger Ebert said of the film, “Sin Nombre is a remarkable film, showing the incredible hardships people will endure in order to reach El Norte.” The film is available to rent on YouTube, Google Play and Apple TV.\n\n32. Tokyo Godfathers (2003)\n\nTokyo Godfathers is not higher on this list because calling it an organized crime movie is a bit of a misnomer. The film is a bit of everything. It is a Christmas movie, an amine, a tragicomedy and arguably a Yazuka film. The film follows three homeless people after they find a baby in the trash.\n\nThere is both a Japanese version and an English dub of the film. The most recent English dub is notable for having a trans actress, Shakina Nayfack, play the trans character of Hana (in the Japanese dub, she is unfortunately voiced by a man.) The film is an indie darling and currently boasts 92% on Rotten Tomatoes. It is currently streaming for free on The Roku Channel and Amazon Prime.\n\n31. Widows (2018)\n\nOrganized crime movies are often dominated by men; it’s a male-led genre about a male-dominated business. Widows takes the troupe of “mob wives” and flips the script. The film follows women who must steal money to pay off their late husbands’ debts to a Chicago mob boss.\n\nDirected by Steve McQueen (who also wrote the screenplay with Gillian Flynn,) the film features an all-star cast including Viola Davis, Michelle Rodriguez, Elizabeth Debicki, Cynthia Erivo, Colin Farrell, Brian Tyree Henry, Daniel Kaluuya, Carrie Coon, Robert Duvall and Liam Neeson. The film balances weighty themes with the excitement and twists of a heist film. Widows is currently streaming on fuboTV.\n\n30. Miller’s Crossing (1990)\n\nThe Coen Brothers' take on 1920s bootlegging, Miller’s Crossing, follows a mob boss who must navigate a mob war after the Irish Mafia extends protection to a bookie, setting off the Italians. The film stars John Turturro, Marcia Gay Harden and Gabriel Byrne.\n\nWhile the film was a commercial flop, it was well-reviewed and currently holds a 93% on Rotten Tomatoes. Miller’s Crossing is a film for people who love old crime movies, and 30 years later, maybe it has become an old crime classic in itself. In a retrospective, Christopher Orr said of the film, “Of course, plenty of films that abound with clever references nonetheless make for lousy cinema. But Miller’s Crossing is an aesthetic pleasure of the highest order on nearly every level.” The film is available to rent on YouTube, Google Play, Amazon Prime and Apple TV.\n\n29. Tokyo Drifter (1966)\n\nTokyo Drifter is a film that both feels very 1960s and far ahead of its time. The film is highly stylized and worth watching for the visuals alone. It follows a retired Yakuza boss turned businessman who has to outpace an old rival.\n\nThe film, directed by Seijun Suzuki, feels like watching a pulp novel. Like many Suzuki films, Tokyo Drifter wears its B-movie status as a badge of honor. Entertainment is kind of the point and Tokyo Drifter delivers on that promise. The film currently holds a 93% on Rotten Tomatoes. It is available to rent on Amazon Prime and Apple TV.\n\n28. Ball of Fire (1941)\n\nBall of Fire is an early example of an “organized crime romcom.” Directed by Howard Hawks and starring Gary Cooper and Barbara Stanwyck, this screwball comedy follows a professor whose work gets him mixed up with a nightclub singer and her made-man fiance. While the story is loosely based on Snow White, Ball of Fire has a wonderful 1940s flavor.\n\nThe film currently has a 100% on Rotten Tomatoes and was preserved in the Library of Congress in 2016. Ball of Fire was nominated for four Oscars, including the now-defunct Best Story category. It is currently streaming for free on Peacock and Pluto TV.\n\n27. El Mariachi (1992)\n\nThe first film in what would become Robert Rodriguez's Mexico Trilogy, El Mariachi, was also his feature-length directorial debut. The film follows a prison escapee who vows revenge on a drug lord and a young musician hoping to follow in his father’s footsteps as a Mariachi. Both men carry guitar cases, one with an instrument and one full of weapons.\n\nThe making of the film is almost as interesting as the final product. The film was made on a micro $7,000 budget with largely amateur actors. Rodriguez secured a large portion of the funding from participating in a drug trial. For many years, the film held the record for the lowest-budget movie to gross $1 million at the box office. It is currently streaming for free on Pluto TV.\n\n26. Hustlers (2019)\n\nMaybe not the first movie one thinks of when they think of organized crime, but these dancers know how to organize. Hustlers is based on the true story of a ring of NYC strippers and their con of drugging stock traders and undertaking credit card fraud.\n\nThe film, written and directed by Lorene Scafaria, starred Constance Wu, Jennifer Lopez, Julia Stiles, Keke Palmer, Lili Reinhart and Cardi B. It was a success at the box office, and Lopez was praised for her performance and dancing. Part Goodfellas, Part Showgirls, Hustlers combines moments of genuine emotion with a bombastic crime story. It is currently streaming on Hulu.\n\n25. A Better Tomorrow (1986)\n\nJohn Woo might be known better in the U.S. for films like Face/Off and Mission Impossible 2, but A Better Tomorrow is among his best work. The Hong Kong film follows an ex-Triad member as he tries to reconnect with his policeman brother.\n\nWhile there are several Hong Kong Triad movies on this list, A Better Tomorrow helped establish the genre (often called the Heroic Bloodshed genre or Hong Kong Blood Opera) and is an important film in Hong Kong film history. The film stars Ti Lung, Leslie Cheung and Chow Yun-fat. It is available to purchase on Apple TV.\n\n24. Key Largo (1948)\n\nThe fourth and final film starring Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall, Key Largo, is a tense film noir about six guests stuck in a Florida hotel during hurricane season. The group runs into an issue when they find out the reclusive sixth guest is a notorious Cuban refugee turned gangster.\n\nThe film suffers from some racial stereotypes and white actors playing Latino characters (a common affliction in the Miami gangster genre, and Key Largo is far from the worst offender even on this list). However, it is still a classic of the gangster genre. The film currently holds a 97% on Rotten Tomatoes. It is available to rent on YouTube, Google Play, Apple TV and Amazon Prime.\n\n23. Once Upon a Time in America (1984)\n\nDirector Sergio Leone’s final film, Once Upon a Time in America, examines the Jewish mob in New York City in the 1920s and 30s. The film follows the mafia career of two kids working their way out of the then-Jewish Ghetto of the Lower East Side neighborhood.\n\nThere are two cuts of the film. The original “European Cut” is nearly four hours (which Leone cut down from its original nearly four-and-a-half-hour runtime). However, the film was cut down and re-ordered by its American distributors for a second “American Cut,” clocking in at just over two hours. While the American version isn’t great, the European Cut is a masterpiece, even if it has been critiqued as misogynistic. The film stars Robert De Niro, James Woods, Elizabeth McGovern and Joe Pesci. The film is the third in Leone’s Once Upon a Time trilogy with Once Upon a Time in the West (1968) and Duck, You Sucker! (1971). Once Upon a Time in America is available to stream for free on Plex or with a Hulu subscription.\n\n22. The Usual Suspects (1995)\n\nThe Usual Suspects follows a con man after surviving a massacre as he tells the cops about the drug lord Keyser Söze. If, by some miracle, this film hasn’t been ruined for you in the last nearly 30 years, the less you know, the better.\n\nDirected by Brian Singer, the film stars Stephen Baldwin, Gabriel Byrne, Chazz Palminteri, Benicio del Toro, Giancarlo Esposito and Kevin Spacey. The film won two Academy Awards but was met with mixed reviews. In his review, Roger Ebert quipped, \"To the degree that I do understand, I don't care.\" However, the film has amassed a dedicated cult audience. It is streaming for free on Tubi, Pluto TV and The Roku Channel.\n\n21. Scarface (1983)\n\n\"Say hello to my little friend!\"\n\nScarface is not the best movie on this list, but it is certainly the most movie on this list. The film is pure excess from the script to the plot to the directing. It captures the tacky opulence of Miami and the 1980s. While Scarface is a remake of a 1932 film of the same name, the 1980s version is the rare remake that eclipses the original.\n\nScarface, directed by Brian De Palma, stars Al Pacino, Steven Bauer, Michelle Pfeiffer, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, Robert Loggia and Míriam Colón. The film follows a Cuban refugee's rise to the top of the Miami drug trade. Scarface has become a cult classic and is an iconic movie to the rap community. However, the film has been criticized by the Latinx community for its portrayal of Cuban immigrants while being played by an Italian. This isn’t the only film directed by De Palma where Pacino plays Latino. Ten years later, the two reunited for Carlito’s Way, where Pacino plays a Nuyorican criminal, which co-star John Leguizamo later called out as “odd.” The film is available to stream on Peacock and Hulu.\n\n20. Traffic (2000)\n\nTraffic follows several stories surrounding America’s “war on drugs.” The film weaves together the lives of Mexican cartels, an Ohio-based judge, and DEA agents on a case. Directed by Steven Soderbergh, it stars Don Cheadle, Benicio del Toro, Michael Douglas, Luis Guzmán, Dennis Quaid and Catherine Zeta-Jones.\n\nThe film won four Academy Awards and was praised for its complexity, especially when it comes to morality. While the film doesn’t take a moral stance against drugs, the same can’t be said of the stance against the “war on drugs” itself. The film is available to stream on Netflix.\n\n19. The Killers (1946)\n\nBurt Lancaster’s debut film, The Killers, follows an insurance adjuster’s investigation into the death of a boxer by hired guns. The film was based on an Earnest Hemingway story of the same name. Hemingway famously said of the film, \"It is a good picture and the only good picture ever made of a story of mine.\"\n\nThe film was a critical success, earning four Oscar nominations. The Killers has been called “the Citizen Kane of noir,” and director Robert Siodmak was a master of the genre. The film stars Edmond O'Brien, Ava Gardner, Albert Dekker, Sam Levene and Lancaster. The film is available to rent on YouTube, Google Play, Apple TV and Amazon Prime.\n\n18. Bound (1996)\n\nUsing “going straight” from the mob as a coming-out narrative for a steamy lesbian thriller isn’t the usual mafia movie. However, it all works in Bound. Bound was the directorial film debut for the Wachowski sisters and an early example of a film about positive lesbian relationships.\n\nThe movie stars Jennifer Tilly and Gina Gershon. Bound follows the story of a woman who hopes to escape her mobster boyfriend and hatches a plan with an ex-con turned lover to steal money from the mob. While the movie was initially met with mixed reviews and led the Wachowskis to be derivably compared to everyone from Quentin Tarantino to the Coen Brothers to Hitchcock, it has become a cult hit, especially in the sapphic community. Feminist sex educator Susie Bright even worked as an intimacy consultant on the film. The film is available to stream for free on Pluto TV.\n\n17. Drunken Angel (1948)\n\nAkira Kurosawa’s noir film Drunken Angel follows a doctor after he treats a small-time Yakuza injured in a gunfight. The film looks at Japan’s underworld through the lens of alcoholism, tuberculosis and domestic abuse. While Drunken Angel isn’t an easy watch, there is a beauty to film.\n\nThe movie captures the melancholy of postwar Japan and is a must-watch for those interested in the Yakuza film genre. It currently has a 94% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. The film is streaming for free on Plex.\n\n16. The French Connection (1971)\n\nThe French Connection follows NYPD and narcotics officers as they try to track down a French heroin kingpin. The film stars Gene Hackman, Fernando Rey, Roy Scheider and Tony Lo Bianco. The film is probably most famous for its car chase scene, which prominently features Brooklyn’s above-ground subways.\n\nThe French Connection was nominated for eight Oscars, winning five, including Best Picture. The film has been a favorite of many directors. David Fincher called it a film that “had a profound impact” on his life. Akira Kurosawa included it on the list of his favorite films. And Steven Spielberg used it as an inspiration for his film Munich. The French Connection is currently available to stream on Max.\n\n15. Touch of Evil (1958)\n\nWritten, directed and starring Orson Welles, Touch of Evil, like many other Welles films, was initially overlooked. The film tells the story of mounting tensions on the Mexican-American border when a Mexican special prosecutor and his new wife are killed by a car bomb, opening up a joint investigation into the deaths and the Vargas crime family.\n\nWhile Roger Ebert was not the first person to revisit Touch of Evil, adding it to his Great Movies list in 1998 brought many new eyes to the film. In his review, he notes the film’s popularity in Europe and how a jury of European filmmakers, including Godard and Truffaut, named it the best film at the 1958 Brussels World Fair. Touch of Evil stars Janet Leigh, Welles, Joseph Calleia, Akim Tamiroff, Marlene Dietrich, Zsa Zsa Gabor and, unfortunately, Charlton Heston as “Ramon Miguel Vargas” in brownface. The film is available to rent on Amazon Prime, YouTube, Google Play and Apple TV.\n\n14. Get Shorty (1995)\n\nOrganized crime comedies often get overlooked, including films like A Fish Called Wanda, The Nice Guys and Get Shorty. Get Shorty may not be the best comedy, but it is the one that has the most to do with organized crime. The film follows a Miami mobster sent to collect a debt from a Hollywood producer.\n\nGet Shorty stars John Travolta, Gene Hackman, Rene Russo and Danny DeVito. Travolta received a Golden Globe for Best Actor in a Motion Picture Musical or Comedy for his role. The film was also nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture — Musical or Comedy. The film earned a sequel, 2005’s Be Cool. While Be Cool is fun, it doesn’t capture the magic of Get Shorty. The movie is currently available to stream with Max.\n\n13. Mean Streets (1973)\n\nMartin Scorsese has made many organized crime movies: Casino, Boxcar Bertha, Gangs of New York, The Irishman and arguably Shark Tale (alight, he didn’t direct this one, but he does lend his voice talents to the character of a loan shark… well, pufferfish.) However, Mean Streets stands above the pack.\n\nThe film follows low-level mobsters in New York’s Little Italy neighborhood, loan sharking and the redemptive power of the Catholic Church. It stars Robert De Niro, Harvey Keitel, David Proval and Amy Robinson. Mean Streets was the first film that De Niro and Scorsese collaborated on together and, in many ways, put both of them on the map—no wonder the two went on to work together on many other films. Mean Streets is streaming for free on Tubi.\n\n12. Gangs of Wasseypur (2012)\n\nGangs of Wasseypur is actually two movies: Gangs of Wasseypur and Part II. However, the films were shot and screened initially at Cannes as one over-five-hour film (it was later split to screen in Indian theaters.) The film, or films, is a Hindi black comedy about the Dhanbad Coal Mafia, or Mafia Raj.\n\nThe movie isn’t a typical Bollywood film, and is grittier than many other Hindi-language films. Its realistic style helped it gain a cult status. Film critic Danny Bowes wrote of the film, “Everything is exactly as it should be, storywise, and the total is an astonishing feat, worthy of discussion alongside Coppola's first two Godfather films, or Leone's Once Upon a Time in America… . Any conversation about gangster movies going forward has to mention Gangs of Wasseypur, or it will be incomplete.” The film is currently available to rent on Apple TV.\n\n11. Election 2 (2006)\n\nMuch like Godfather II, Election 2 is better than the original. Election 2, sometimes called Triad Election, follows a boss who runs for an unheard-of second term to hold on to the top spot in a crime syndicate.\n\nThe film was shown at the Hong Kong International Film Festival and out of competition at the Cannes Film Festival before being shown on a larger festival circuit. The film holds a 96% on Rotten Tomatoes. Election 2 director Johnnie To has become known for his Hong Kong crime films and Election 2 is among his best. Election 2 is currently streaming for free on Tubi.\n\n10. Rififi (1955)\n\nWhile most pure heist films are excluded from this list, Rififi is different. The French noir follows an aging gangster as he tries to pull off a jewel heist with help from other European gangsters. The film stars Jean Servais, Robert Hossein, Magali Noël and Janine Darcey.\n\nThe film was directed by Hollywood-blacklisted director Jules Dassin. Dassin had left America in the 1940s after being outed as a former communist. Rififi was well received, even in the U.S. However, it was banned in several countries due to its highly realistic burglary scene. The nearly silent half-hour scene is arresting and a must-see, even if it possibly teaches viewers a little too much about how to rob a store. Unfortunately, the film is currently not available on streaming.\n\n9. Fireworks (1997)\n\nSometimes called Hana-bi, Fireworks is a cult Yakuza film by Takeshi Kitano. It stars Beat Takeshi, Kayoko Kishimoto and Ren Osugi. The film follows an ex-cop who borrows money from the mob, pulling him into Japan’s criminal underworld.\n\nThe film won the Golden Lion at the Venice International Film Festival and has been heralded as a masterpiece. Fireworks delivers on style, but never puts it over substance. Fireworks was included on director Akira Kurosawa’s list of favorite movies and was the most recent film included. The film is available to rent on YouTube and Google Play.\n\n8. Eastern Promises (2007)\n\nDavid Cronenberg’s gritty look at sex trafficking and the Russian mob is one of the more violent films on an already violent list. Eastern Promises follows a nurse after she finds a diary in London hospital left behind by a trafficked Ukrainian girl who dies in childbirth. As she tries to find the truth, she is hurled into the world of eastern organized crime and makes an unlikely ally in Nikolai, a driver for a Russian boss.\n\nThe film stars Viggo Mortensen, Naomi Watts, Vincent Cassel and Armin Mueller-Stahl. Eastern Promises has been praised for its accuracy in describing the realities of the Russian mob, especially tattooing conventions. While it was well-received upon its release and even earned Mortensen an Oscar nomination for Best Actor, it has garnered a cult audience. The film boasts one of the best fight scenes of all time, and certainly the best fight scene set in a sauna. It is currently streaming on Max.\n\n7. Infernal Affairs (2002)\n\nInfernal Affairs is the Hong Kong film on which Martin Scorsese’s The Departed is based. While Infernal Affairs is far less gritty than The Departed, the two films share the same plot. Both are great mob movies; the audience just has to choose if they would rather watch a frenetic Hong Kong-style action film about an undercover cop infiltrating a Chinese Triad or a gritty American character study about an undercover cop infiltrating the Irish Mob in Boston.\n\nInfernal Affairs stars Andy Lau, Tony Leung, Anthony Wong and Eric Tsang. While it is an action movie that spawned two sequels, it has a surprisingly emotional and visual richness. While it may not have won four Oscars like its American remake, the original is worth watching. Infernal Affairs is currently streaming on Max.\n\n6. City of God (2002)\n\nCity of God follows two boys as one grows up to be a drug dealer and the other becomes a photographer. The film is loosely based on real events but comes from the 1997 novel of the same name. It was shot on location in Rio and showcases the real favela of Cidade de Deus.\n\nDirector Robert Altman said of the film, \"I don't know how Fernando Meirelles made City Of God. It's so courageous, so truthful. I think it's the best picture I've ever seen.\" City of God is brutal, unflinching and still full of heart. The film was nominated for four Oscars, including Best Director for Meirelles. The film is available to rent on Amazon Prime, Google Play and Apple TV.\n\n5. Reservoir Dogs (1992)\n\n“Let me tell you what ‘Like a Virgin’ is about.”\n\nQuentin Tarantino knows how to make a great organized crime film, including Pulp Fiction, Kill Bill Vol. 1, and the criminally underrated Jackie Brown. However, Reservoir Dogs is possibly his best organized crime film and, arguably, his film most about organized crime. The film follows hired bank robbers after a heist goes sour and the realization that they were set up.\n\nTarantino’s full-length directorial debut, Reservoir Dogs stars Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, Chris Penn, Steve Buscemi, Lawrence Tierney and Michael Madsen. Reservoir Dogs is profane, violent and an important moment in the history of independent film. The success of an independent film from a young director shook up the landscape of 1990s Hollywood. The film has now taken on a cult status partially for its snappy dialogue and gross-out torture scene. It is currently streaming for free on Amazon Prime and Plex.\n\n4. Boyz n the Hood (1991)\n\nBoyz n the Hood is about coming of age in L.A.'s South Central neighborhood and the gangs that control it. Boyz n the Hood was the directorial debut of John Singleton and starred ​​Cuba Gooding Jr., Ice Cube, Nia Long, Morris Chestnut, Tyra Ferrell, Laurence Fishburne, Regina King and Angela Bassett.\n\nSingleton got the idea for the film after watching Stand By Me, and that sentimentality translates to the care he showed for the “boyz” in the film even as they interact with the adult world of California street gangs. This top Black film earned Singleton an Oscar nomination for Best Director, making him the youngest person and first Black director to be nominated. It is currently streaming on Netflix.\n\n3. On the Waterfront (1954)\n\nDirected by Elia Kazan, On the Waterfront stars Marlon Brando as a dock worker and former boxer who must testify against a mobster who controls the Hoboken waterfront. The film received 12 Oscar nominations, winning eight.\n\nOn the Waterfront also occupies an interesting part of Hollywood history, as has been seen as a response to criticism Kazan faced for naming eight names in a testimony before the House Un-American Activities Committee. Brando’s acting in the film is widely considered a masterwork that redefined the craft of acting. The film also stars Karl Maldenm, Lee J. Cobb and Eva Marie Saint. Leonard Bernstein composed the music for the film. On the Waterfront is currently streaming on Amazon Prime.\n\n2. The Godfather (1972) and The Godfather Part II (1974)\n\nMaybe this should be split into two entries, but who can watch just one? Another film on this list starring Marlon Brando and Al Pacino, The Godfather follows the youngest son of a crime family as he takes on the role of a mafia boss. While the 1972 film is a classic, The Godfather Part II is the rare sequel to eclipse the original.\n\nThe Godfather Part II is both a sequel and prequel to the original film, and follows the Corleone family through the lens of the new Don, Michael, and his father, Vito. Part II stars Robert De Niro, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire, Morgana King, John Cazale, Mariana Hill and Lee Strasberg. Both films were directed by Francis Ford Coppola. While there is a part three, it fails to capture the gravitas of the first two. Both films are available to stream on Apple TV and Paramount+.\n\n1. Goodfellas (1990)\n\n“I’m funny, how? Like a clown? Do I amuse you?”\n\nSometimes, audiences forget how funny Goodfellas truly is. Part of the film's magic is the juxtaposition of humor with tragedy and brutality. The film is based on Nicholas Pileggi's memoir Wiseguy and follows the rise and fall of a mob associate, Henry Hill.\n\nDirected by Martin Scorsese, the film stars Robert De Niro, Ray Liotta, Joe Pesci, Lorraine Bracco and Paul Sorvino. Goodfellas was nominated for six Academy Awards and won one for Pesci as Best Supporting Actor. It was selected for preservation by the Library of Congress as \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" in 2000. The film also served as inspiration for arguably the best organized crime TV show ever made, The Sopranos. Over its six seasons, The Sopranos featured 27 actors who appeared in Goodfellas. Goodfellas is currently streaming on Philo.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThere is a reason organized crime movies have captured the imagination of audiences worldwide. These films deliver high stakes, emotion, loyalty and, usually, violence. A lot of violence. But if you can stomach them, these films are must-watches."
