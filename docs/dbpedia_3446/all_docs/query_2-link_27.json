        "text": "I don’t know if I think of Kristin Scott Thomas as a “costume movie actress,” since the #1 film I associate her with is, of course,Â Four Weddings and a Funeral. But she’s actually done a number of period films far above and beyond just The English Patient! She’s so stunningly, regally beautiful and so great at inhabiting different characters that I definitely perk up when I see she’s in something, so let’s take a look at all her historical roles.\n\nA Handful of Dust (1988)\n\n1930s, London, affairs, based on the novel by Evelyn Waugh.\n\nThe Tenth Man (1988)\n\nA post-World War II movie with Anthony Hopkins: “After willing his estate to another man’s family in order to save his own life in a Nazi prison, Chavel returns to his erstwhile home in disguise, where he meets Therese, the sister of the man who died in his place” per IMDB.\n\nLe bal du gouverneur (1990)\n\nThomas is fluent in French and actually does a decent amount of French movies! This one is set in a French colony in the 1950s.\n\nThe Bachelor (1990)\n\nAn Austrian doctor is torn between two women in the 1910s.\n\nThe Secret Life of Ian Fleming (1990)\n\nA TV movie about the writer of the James Bond novels; Thomas plays his fiancÃ©e.\n\nAn Unforgettable Summer (1994)\n\nIn 1920s Romania, Thomas plays the wife of an army officer; they are sent to a remote outpost after she rebuffs her husband’s commanding officer.\n\nAngels & Insects (1995)\n\nSuch a weird and wonderful movie. Mark Rylance is a naturalist who marries into a verrrrry interesting Victorian family. Thomas plays the plain and retiring governess who turns out to be intelligent and far more of a kindred spirit than he initially thinks.\n\nRichard III (1995)\n\n(Pronounced “Richard Eye Eye Eye,” of course). A 1930s, fascist-set adaptation of the Shakespeare play. SO GOOD. Thomas plays Queen Anne (Neville).\n\nThe English Patient (1996)\n\nWorld War II, two doomed romances. Thomas plays a married woman who falls in love while in Egypt.\n\nUp at the Villa (2000)\n\nExpats in Florence, Italy just before World War II.\n\nGosford Park (2001)\n\nAn upper-class house party in 1930s England — but somebody gets murdered. Tons of intertwining stories and naturalistic (in a great way!) dialogue. Thomas is the glamorous wife of the victim.\n\nAdventures of Arsene Lupin (2004)\n\nI SO want to see this, as the costume looks AMAZE-BALLS — but I can’t find a subtitled version, and I can never keep up with movie French. The title character is a thief in fin-de-siÃ¨cle Paris.\n\nMan to Man (2005)\n\nHere’s a happy one: “An epic about anthropologists who hunt and capture pygmies for study back in Europe, in an attempt to illustrate the link between man and ape” (IMDB).\n\nEasy Virtue (2008)\n\nA sparkly adaptation of a 1920s Noel Coward play.\n\nThe Other Boleyn Girl (2008)\n\nThe big budget adaptation of Philippa Gregory’s Anne Boleyn novel. Thomas plays Anne’s (and Mary’s) mother, Elizabeth. She’s mostly background-y until she gets to tell off her husband for essentially selling off his daughters, which is satisfying.\n\nBel Ami (2012)\n\nIn no way a great a movie, but if you want to see turn-of-the-1890s costumes done spot-on, you couldn’t do better.\n\nThe Invisible Woman (2013)\n\nCharles Dickens’s affair with much-younger actress Ellen Terry. Thomas plays Ellen’s mother. I did see this, and, meh? It wasn’t bad, but it wasn’t good. The mid-Victorian costumes are fine, the story is fine, the acting is fine, but nothing inspires me to be able to say anything else. Hence why I haven’t managed a review!\n\nSuite FranÃ§aise (2014)\n\nA French woman has an affair with a German soldier during World War II; Thomas plays the woman’s “domineering” mother-in-law.\n\nDarkest Hour (2017)\n\nThomas plays the wife of Winston Churchill as he deals with Hitler and the beginning of World War II.\n\nWhich is your favorite of Kristin Scott Thomas’ historical roles?"
