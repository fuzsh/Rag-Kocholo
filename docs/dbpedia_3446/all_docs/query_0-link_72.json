        "text": "Not every actor can be expected to make the transition to filmmaking, but Kristin Scott Thomas is one who seemed like a natural. Her career has evolved greatly since her breakout debut in Prince’s Under the Cherry Moon, and eventual Oscar nomination for The English Patient. The move to directing with her film The Sea Change has gotten off to a strong start with an A-list actress who has come aboard.\n\nDeadline reports Thomas’ directorial debut The Sea Change will star Scarlett Johansson. Based on the novel by Elizabeth Jane Howard, the film centers on a famous London playwright and his deteriorating relationship with his sick wife, as they are already coping with the recent death of their child.\n\nThis is big progress for Thomas who has been attempting this project for quite some time, once with Mark Strong and Anya Taylor-Joy attached. It remains to be seen if either of them will come back for this attempt, but that seems unlikely."
