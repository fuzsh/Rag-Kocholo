        "text": "Another bit of casting news this AM, which sees buzzy actor Barry Keoghan ready to join one of Amazon MGM‘s equally buzzy upcoming projects. Deadline reports that the “Saltburn” actor is in talks to join Chris Hemsworth and Mark Ruffalo for “Crime 101,” Bart Layton‘s adaptation of Don Winslow‘s 2021 crime novella. The studio eyes a theatrical release for the film next year.\n\nREAD MORE: ‘Crime 101’: Mark Ruffalo To Star Opposite Chris Hemsworth In Bart Layton’s New Thriller\n\nIt’s unclear who each actor plays yet in “Crime 101,” but they’ll star in a story reminiscent of Michael Mann‘s “Heat.” Winslow’s story follows a string of high-level jewelry heists along the Pacific Coast, which police believe are linked to a Colombian cartel. But a detective thinks the robberies are instead the work of one man, and that the expert thief is setting up for one final score.\n\nGrayson adapts Winslow’s novella for the big screen and co-produces the project with Hemsworth. Other producers include Shane Salerno through Story Factory, Eric Fellner and Tim Bevan through Working Title, and Layton and Dmiriti Doganis and Derrin Schlesinger through RAW. RAW’s Joely Fether serves as executive producer.\n\nAmazon MGM raised eyebrows last Fall when they outbid Netflix for “Crime 101.” At the time, Pedro Pascal was still attached to the project to star opposite Hemsworth, but he ultimately had to depart due to scheduling conflicts. Many in the industry expected Netflix to snag “Crime 101” due to their history with Hemsworth on the “Extraction” movies and Christopher McQuarrie‘s “Spiderhead.” Instead, Amazon MGM swooped in with a $90 million bid, securing the rights. Ruffalo then joined the project earlier this month.\n\nAs for Keoghan, if he joins “Crime 101” he’ll add the crime film to his already busy upcoming schedule. It’s been a strong 2024 already for the Irish actor, with turns in Apple TV+‘s limited series “Masters Of The Air” and Andrea Arnold‘s “Bird,” which just had its world premiere at the Cannes Film Festival. Up next for Keoghan? The thriller “Bring Them Down” and an untitled feature from Trey Edward Shults with Jenna Ortega and The Weekend, both in post-production now."
