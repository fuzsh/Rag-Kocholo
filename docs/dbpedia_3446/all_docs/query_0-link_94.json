        "text": "Hollywood actress Dame Helen Mirren has revealed she was stopped from playing her latest role in French because American audiences do not like subtitles.\n\nMUSIC NEWS: Back in April, Frank ‘Poncho’ Sampedro told Rolling Stone magazine that his band Crazy Horse were too old to tour with Neil Young.\n\nDame Helen Mirren and Billie Piper will go head-to-head at this year’s Olivier Awards – while James McAvoy is in the running for Macbeth.\n\nMUSIC NEWS: Lock up your children! David Guetta, and Example headline tonight’s dance event in Marlay Park, Dublin, and as we predicted in the wake of the Swedish House Mafia trouble, the powers that be are queuing up to get tough with those awful young people.\n\nCusack is suitably woebegone as the poverty-stricken Poe, the expression in his melancholy eyes constantly vacillating from depression to rage and perhaps even madness, and he gets strong support from Luke Evans as the dogged Detective Emmet Fields and Brendan Gleeson as the scenery-chewing Colonel Hamilton, father of Poe’s love interest, Emily (Alice Eve).\n\nRobert Pattinson hones the mournful pout of his vampire from the ‘Twilight’ saga in this tepid adaptation of the 19th century novel by Guy de Maupassant.\n\nAndrew Garfield beat Oscar favourite Colin Firth to the best actor gong at tonight's Evening Standard British Film Awards and said it would \"provide more fuel for my fire\".\n\nThat most English of actresses, the wonderful Kristin Scott Thomas, turns in a powerful and emotional rollercoaster of a performance in this quite excellent romantic drama, arguably the best of her career to date.\n\nThree women who are old enough to claim their pensions appeared in a list of the 10 most beautiful women in the world, which was released today.\n\nNo stone, if you’ll pardon the pun, has been left unturned in the search for stories about The Beatles, so no surprise then that we have another … the story of the early years of the Fab Four and of the curious relationship between Lennon and his mother and aunt.\n\nRhys Ifans is preparing to cast a little magic in the upcoming 'Harry Potter' movie after landing a role as a wizard in the film franchise's next instalment.\n\nKristin Scott Thomas was baffled when Kate Winslet won a Golden Globe for 'The Reader', because her part was too big to be recognised as a supporting role."
