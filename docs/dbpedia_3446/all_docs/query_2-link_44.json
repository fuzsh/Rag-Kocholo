        "text": "Kristin Scott Thomas has had quite an acclaimed career as an actor. She’s earned numerous awards and has been nominated for an Oscar, thanks to her role in “The English Patient.” Now, she’s ready to step behind the camera and take her shot as a director, and it appears she’s found quite the leading lady to build the film around.\n\nREAD MORE: Scarlett Johansson & Chris Evans Reunite For ‘Project Artemis’ Space Race Film From Director Jason Bateman & Apple\n\nAccording to Deadline, Kristin Scott Thomas is set to direct “The Sea Change.” And not only that, she’s signed Scarlett Johansson to lead the cast of the drama. The film is based on the novel of the same name by Elizabeth Jane Howard. The plot follows a famous London playwright and his deteriorating relationship with his sickly wife, Lillian, as they are still struggling to come to terms with the death of their child. It’s assumed that Johansson will play Lillian in the film.\n\nJohansson is probably best known for her role as Natasha Romanoff, aka Black Widow, in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. However, with that role seemingly in the rearview mirror, the actress has signed on for a variety of upcoming projects including “Asteroid City” from Wes Anderson and “Project Artemis” alongside her MCU co-star Chris Evans.\n\nREAD MORE: Scarlett Johansson Thinks Her Disney Lawsuit Had A “Positive Impact” As New Secret Marvel Project Is Teased\n\nThomas has been trying to make “The Sea Change” for a number of years now. At one point, the film was reportedly set up with Mark Strong and Anya Taylor-Joy in the lead roles. That, obviously, never came to be.\n\nA release date for “The Sea Change” has yet to be announced. It’ll be interesting to see how Johansson is able to fit the film in her incredibly busy schedule. But we’re excited to see what happens."
