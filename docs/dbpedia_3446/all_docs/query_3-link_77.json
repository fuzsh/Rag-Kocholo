The film starred Ralph Fiennes and Kristin Scott Thomas alongside Juliette Binoche, Willem Dafoe and Colin Firth in supporting roles.\n\nThe eponymous protagonist, a man burned beyond recognition who speaks with an English accent, recalls his history in a series of flashbacks, revealing to the audience his true identity and the love affair in which he was involved before the war. The film ends with a definitive onscreen statement that it is a highly fictionalized account of László Almásy (died 1951) and other historical figures and events. The film received widespread critical acclaim and emerged as a major commercial success at the box-office.\n\nThe film received twelve nominations at the 69th Academy Awards, winning nine, including Best Picture, Best Director for Minghella, and Best Supporting Actress for Binoche. It was also the first to receive a Best Editing Oscar for a digitally edited film. Ralph Fiennes, playing the titular character, and Kristin Scott Thomas were Oscar-nominated for their performances. The film also won five BAFTA Awards and two Golden Globes. The British Film Institute ranked The English Patient the 55th-greatest British film of the 20th century.[9] The American Film Institute ranked it the 56th-greatest love story of all time.[10]\n\nAs of August 2021, the novel was in early development for a new BBC television series, co-produced by Miramax Television and Paramount Television Studios.[11][12]\n\nPlot\n\n[edit]\n\nA British biplane, flying across the desert, is shot down by German gunners. The badly burned pilot is pulled from the wreckage and rescued by a group of Bedouin.\n\nHana, a French-Canadian WWII Royal Canadian Army Medical Corps combat nurse, discovers her boyfriend has been killed through a wounded soldier. In October 1944 Italy, she is caring for a dying, severely burned English-accented patient who says he cannot remember his name. His only possession is a copy of Herodotus's Histories, with personal notes, pictures, and mementos stored inside.\n\nWhen a nurse friend is killed in front of her, Hana decides she is a curse to her loved ones. She gains permission to settle in a bombed-out monastery with her patient, as he is suffering during their hospital unit's relocation.\n\nLieutenant Kip, a Sikh sapper in the British Indian Army posted with Sergeant Hardy to clear German mines and booby traps, soon joins them. David Caravaggio, a Canadian Intelligence Corps operative who was tortured during a German interrogation, also arrives there. He questions the patient, who gradually reveals his past through a series of flashbacks. Over the days of the patient relating his story, Hana and Kip begin a shy love affair.\n\nIn the late 1930s, he was exploring a region of the Sahara, as he is Hungarian cartographer László Almásy. He was part of a Royal Geographical Society archeological and surveying expedition group, including his good friend, Englishman Peter Madox, and British couple Geoffrey and Katharine Clifton, who provided aerial surveys using their plane.\n\nAlmásy discovers through a Bedouin the location of the ancient Cave of Swimmers, containing cave paintings. As the group documents their find, Almásy and Katharine fall in love. He writes about her in notes folded into his book, which she discovers when he awkwardly accepts two watercolours of the cave walls and asks her to paste them into the book.\n\nUpon returning to Cairo, they begin an affair, while the group arranges for more detailed archaeological surveys of the cave and the surrounding area. Almásy buys her a silver thimble as a gift. Some months later, Katharine abruptly breaks things off, fearing Geoffrey will discover them. Shortly afterward the archaeological projects are halted due to the onset of the war. Madox leaves his Tiger Moth airplane at Kufra Oasis before his return to Britain.\n\nCaravaggio now seeks revenge for his injuries, so far killing the German interrogator who cut off his thumbs and the spy who identified him, but now seeks whoever provided maps to the Germans, allowing them to infiltrate Cairo. He suspects Almásy, asking \"Did you kill the Cliftons?\", to which Almásy concedes \"Maybe... I did\".\n\nAlmásy tells Caravaggio, with Hana listening nearby, about packing camp in 1941 when Geoffrey arrives overhead. He aims at Almásy, who jumps out of the way. Geoffrey is dead at the controls and Katharine badly injured in the front seat. It was an attempted double murder-suicide, as he uncovered their affair. Almásy carries her to the Cave of Swimmers. Seeing her wearing the thimble on a chain, she declares she has always loved him.\n\nLeaving her there with provisions and his book, Almásy walks three days cross-desert. Arriving at British-held El Tag, he explains her desperate situation and asks for help, but a young officer detains him on suspicion of being a spy.\n\nTransported away by train, Almásy escapes and eventually comes across a German army unit. They take him to the Kufra Oasis, where Madox has hidden his plane. Exchanging maps for fuel, Almásy flies to the cave, where he confirms Katharine's death. Taking her on the plane, they are burned when shot down, connecting to the opening scene. After hearing the story, Caravaggio gives up his quest for revenge.\n\nKip is reposted once he has cleared the explosives; he and Hana agree they will meet again. Later, Almásy tells her he has had enough by pushing many vials of morphine towards her. Though distraught, Hana grants his wish, administering the lethal dose. As he drifts to sleep, she reads him Katharine's final letter, written while alone in the cave. The next morning Hana goes with Caravaggio to Florence, holding Almásy's book tightly as they ride away.\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nRalph Fiennes as Almásy\n\nJuliette Binoche as Hana\n\nWillem Dafoe as Caravaggio\n\nKristin Scott Thomas as Katharine Clifton\n\nNaveen Andrews as Kip\n\nColin Firth as Geoffrey Clifton\n\nJulian Wadham as Madox\n\nJürgen Prochnow as Major Muller\n\nKevin Whately as Hardy\n\nClive Merrison as Fenelon-Barnes\n\nNino Castelnuovo as D'Agostino\n\nHichem Rostom as Fouad\n\nPeter Rühring as Bermann\n\nIn addition, Torri Higginson plays Mary and Liisa Repo-Martell plays Jan, appearing briefly as Hana's nursing corps colleagues.\n\nProduction\n\n[edit]\n\nSaul Zaentz was interested in working with Anthony Minghella after he saw the director's film Truly, Madly, Deeply (1990); Minghella brought this project to the producer's attention. Michael Ondaatje, the Sri Lankan-born Canadian author of the novel, worked closely with the filmmakers.[13] According to Minghella, during the development of the project with 20th Century Fox, the \"studio wanted the insurance policy of so-called bigger\" actors.[14] Zaentz recalled, \"they'd look at you and say, 'Could we cast Demi Moore in the role'?\"[15] After months of disputes with Fox, the studio pulled out just three weeks before production was to begin and Harvey Weinstein came in and acquired worldwide rights for Miramax Films for $27.5 million.[8][14] After Miramax became involved, the director's preference for Scott Thomas in the role of Katharine was honored.[14] To help the film get made, cast and crew agreed to salary deferrals totalling $10 million and Zaentz met the remainder of the production costs. Including the deferred costs, Variety reported the production costs at $43 million. The deferments were due to be paid after the film broke even, however, although the actors received a deferred payment of $5 million, after over three years after release, others were still waiting for their deferred salaries, subject to an audit of the figures.[8] Zaentz sued Miramax in 2006 claiming $20 million but the case was still unresolved when Zaentz died in 2014.[16][17]\n\nThe film was shot on location in Tunisia[18] and Italy.[19][20]\n\nThe Conversations: Walter Murch and the Art of Editing Film[21] by Michael Ondaatje is based on the conversations between the author and film editor. Murch, with a career that already included such complex works as the Godfather trilogy, The Conversation, and Apocalypse Now, dreaded the task of editing the film with multiple flashbacks and time frames. Once he began, the possibilities became apparent, some of which took him away from the order of the original script. A reel without sound was made so scene change visuals would be consistent with the quality of the aural aspect between the two. The final cut features over 40 temporal transitions. It was during this time that Murch met Ondaatje and they were able to exchange thoughts about editing the film.[22]\n\nIn the film, two types of aircraft were used:[23] a De Havilland D.H.82 Tiger Moth and a Boeing-Stearman Model 75. Both are biplanes.[24] The camp crash scene was made with a 1⁄2-size scale model.\n\nThe Hungarian folk song, \"Szerelem, Szerelem\", performed by Muzsikas featuring Márta Sebestyén, was featured in the film.\n\nMusic\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: The English Patient (soundtrack)\n\nReception\n\n[edit]\n\nThe English Patient received widespread critical acclaim, and emerged as a major commercial success at the box-office, and received nine Academy Awards, six BAFTA awards, and two Golden Globe Awards.\n\nJanet Maslin of The New York Times called the movie \"a stunning feat of literary adaptation as well as a purely cinematic triumph\".[25] In The New Yorker, Anthony Lane argues that \"the triumph of the film lies not just in the force and the range of the performances—the crisp sweetness of Scott Thomas, say, versus the raw volatility of Binoche—but in Minghella's creation of an intimate epic: vast landscapes mingle with the minute details of desire, and the combination is transfixing\".[26]\n\nThe film has a rating of 86% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 91 reviews, with an average of 7.90/10. The website's critical consensus states, \"Though it suffers from excessive length and ambition, director Minghella's adaptation of the Michael Ondaatje novel is complex, powerful, and moving.\"[27] The film also has a rating of 87/100 on Metacritic, based on 31 critical reviews.[28] Chicago Sun Times critic Roger Ebert gave the film a four-star rating, saying \"it's the kind of movie you can see twice – first for the questions, the second time for the answers\".[29] In his movie guide, Leonard Maltin rated the film 3+1⁄2 out of 4, calling it \"a mesmerizing adaptation\" of Ondaatje's novel, saying \"Fiennes and Scott Thomas are perfectly matched\", and he concluded by calling the film \"an exceptional achievement all around\".[30] In 2021, The Boston Globe called the movie a \"masterpiece\" in a 25-year anniversary review.[31]\n\nAudiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade of \"A−\" on a scale of A+ to F.[32]\n\nIt became the highest-grossing film in the history of Miramax with a worldwide gross of $232 million.[33][6]\n\nThe film is referred to in the Seinfeld episode \"The English Patient\", where the character Elaine is shunned by her friends and co-workers for disliking the film.[34]\n\nAccolades\n\n[edit]\n\nAward Category Nominee(s) Result Ref.
