        "text": "Queen Latifah’s Flavor Unit Entertainment alongside Larenz Tate’s TateMen Entertainment has officially released an original film, Deuces. The film is described as a tale of friendship, loyalty, love and deceit as seen from the anti-hero’s point of view. Directed by Jamaal Hill, the story follows ambitious undercover agent, Jason Foster (Lance Gross) as he infiltrates an airtight crime ring lead by the charismatic Stephen “Deuces” Brooks (Larenz Tate). Produced by LaRon Tate, the drama unfolds to reveal a tangled love story between Deuces and Jason’s sister, Janet Foster, played by Meagan Good.\n\nIn addition to Tate, Good, Anthony, and Gross the cast includes Rotimi (Power, Burning Sands), Rick Gonzalez (Arrow, Rosewood), and Antonique Smith (Notorious, Shots Fired), and rapper Siya.\n\nAnthony has starred in films such as Two Can Play That Game, Think Like a Man, and Baggage Claim. She was most recently seen in the BET mini-series New Edition, and is currently set to star in the upcoming VH1 series, Daytime Divas.\n\nGood top-lined NBC drama Deception and Fox’s Minority Report and recurred on CBS’ Code Black. Recently she starred in the Lifetime movie Love By the 10th Date, which premiered earlier this year. Her credits also include Think Like a Man Too and the coming-of-age tale A Girl Like Grace, which she also co-produced. She is currently set to star in the upcoming Hulu television series adaptation of the 1974 blaxploitation classic Foxy Brown."
