        "text": "You know celebrated Academy Award nominee Kristin Scott Thomas as one of the great actors of her generation. But you can now add filmmaker to her list of accolades. Principal photography has wrapped Thomas’ upcoming directorial debut, “My Mother’s Wedding,” and the cast— Scarlett Johansson (“Marriage Story,” “Under The Skin”), Sienna Miller (“American Woman”), Emily Beecham (“Little Joe,” “Cruella”), and Thomas herself—speaks to everyone wanting to work with this top-notch thespian.\n\nREAD MORE: ‘The Sea Change’: Scarlett Johansson To Star In Kristin Scott Thomas’ Feature Directorial Debut\n\nWhile the title seems to have changed from earlier reports, “My Mother’s Wedding” focuses on three romantically dysfunctional sisters trying to navigate their mother’s third wedding. Today, PR for the film revealed a first look from Thomas’ debut. Thomas plays the mother herself, and Johansson, Miller, and Beecham the sisters.\n\nHere’s the official synopsis:\n\nThree sisters return to their childhood home for a momentous weekend, the third wedding of their twice-widowed mother, Diana (Scott Thomas). The three daughters are from very different walks of life: Georgina (Beecham), a palliative nurse; Victoria (Miller), a Hollywood star; and Katherine (Johansson), a Captain in the Royal Navy. Over the weekend, the family gathers to celebrate a new marriage, but mother and daughters alike are forced to revisit the past and confront the future, with help from a colorful group of unexpected wedding guests…\n\nThe film actually marks the third time Scott Thomas and Johansson have played mother and daughter since “The Horse Whisperer” (1998).\n\nJoining the cast are BAFTA award nominee Freida Pinto (“Slumdog Millionaire,” “Knight of Cups”), Sindhu Vee (“Sex Education,” “Matilda”), Joshua McGuire (“Cheaters,” “Anatomy of a Scandal”), Mark Stanley (“Game Of Thrones,” “Trigger Point”), Thibault de Montalembert (“Call My Agent,” “The King”) and Samson Kayo (“Bloods,” “The Bubble”). Scott Thomas is also reunited with her “Four Weddings and a Funeral” co-star, James Fleet.\n\n“I have wanted to direct for a long time, and it was thrilling to create this fictional family using my own childhood memories as a springboard,” Thomas said in a statement. “Directing and acting with such talented actresses and reuniting with Scarlett Johansson has been exhilarating.”"
