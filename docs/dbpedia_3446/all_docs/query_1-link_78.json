This is a list of the best movies based on real murders including everything from Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer to Badlands to Wolf Creek.\n\nWhat movies will you find on this list of the best films about real murders? You might vote Zodiac – directed by David Fincher – up to the top. The film follows several reporters, citizens, and police officers as they try to uncover who committed a horrific killing spree in the 1960s and 1970s. The crimes remain unsolved to this day. Monster, starring Charlize Theron, is another one of the best movies based on a real murderer.

Charlize Theron delivers a transformative, Oscar-winning performance as Wuornos, fully immersing herself in the character to portray her disturbing mental state and tumultuous relationship with her lover, Selby Wall, played by Christina Ricci, whose love may have pushed her over the edge. The film not only sheds light on the horrifying actions of one woman but also delves into the deeper societal issues that contributed to her downward spiral.\n\nJake Gyllenhaal, Mark Ruffalo, Robert Downey\n\n2,188 votes\n\nReleased : 2007\n\nDirected by : David Fincher\n\nDavid Fincher masterfully directs this gripping thriller about the infamous Zodiac Killer, who terrorized Northern California in the 1960s and 1970s.

The film captures the struggles of living and asserting one's identity in an unforgiving world, with an unforgettable and harrowing performance by Hilary Swank earning her an Academy Award for Best Actress. By focusing on the complex relationships and tragic events that culminated in Teena's murder, the story brings attention to the ongoing issues of hatred and intolerance against LGBTQ+ individuals.\n\nBruce Willis, Emile Hirsch, Justin Timberlake\n\n1,486 votes\n\nReleased : 2006\n\nDirected by : Nick Cassavetes\n\nBased on the shocking kidnapping and murder of 15-year-old Nicholas Markowitz, this crime drama follows the events that led to the tragic event orchestrated by drug dealer Jesse James Hollywood. With a cast of notable young actors, including Emile Hirsch, Justin Timberlake, and Anton Yelchin, the film offers a disturbing look into the lives of reckless and impulsive criminals who become entangled in a deadly web of their own making.

Told from the perspective of Bundy's longtime girlfriend, Liz Kendall (played by Lily Collins), the movie reveals the disturbing duality of a man who could be caring and charismatic while hiding unimaginable horrors. By focusing on the relationship between Bundy and Kendall, the film explores the depths of manipulation and deceit employed by this devious criminal.\n\nBrad Renfro, Rachel Miner, Nick Stahl\n\nReleased : 2001\n\nDirected by : Larry Clark\n\nThis unsettling and provocative drama is based on the real-life murder of Bobby Kent, a manipulative and abusive teenager who was killed by a group of his peers, led by Marty Puccio.
