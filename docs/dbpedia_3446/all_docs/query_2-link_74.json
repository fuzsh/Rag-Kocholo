        "text": "Charlotte Rampling and Kristin Scott Thomas—a generation apart and quite different actresses. Rampling arrived in the mid-60s with a smoky gaze and the slinky physique of an Egon Schiele, her beauty so silent, catlike, and clawed that her surname has practically become a verb—to rample. (“For a female to render a male helpless with a kind of coldly elusive sexuality” is how Urban Dictionary defines it.) Last winter, at age 68 no less, Rampling was named the new face of Nars cosmetics. Scott Thomas appeared in the mid-80s, more classically romantic, more gleamingly British (all those crisp t’s in her name), with a Maid Marian clarity in the eyes and brow.\n\nWhat the two do have in common—along with great bones—is a voice. Neither Rampling nor Scott Thomas was ever the violin. It is the cello’s timbre, deep-toned and complex, that has shaped their work and the characters they play. Rampling, so often cast in mysteries with an existential edge, has just joined the cast of the dark English TV crime drama Broadchurch, now entering its second season. And September brings Scott Thomas’s next film, My Old Lady. Shot in a Paris of stones and shadows, co-starring Maggie Smith and Kevin Kline, it brings a lilt to the Freudian notion of the family romance. Interestingly, Scott Thomas and Rampling have both spent much of their lives in France, not only making movies there but marrying Frenchmen. The English novelist and Francophile Nancy Mitford, describing the challenges Englishwomen face competing with the clever females of France, once wrote, “These poor English roses just hang their lovely heads and droop and die.”\n\nNot these roses.\n\nCulture\n\nParis Olympics 2024 Opening Ceremony Serves Lady Gaga, Celine Dion, and a Drag Last Supper\n\nAt the rain-drenched opening ceremonies for the 2024 Paris Summer Olympics, Celine Dion performed for the first time in four years, as did Marie Antoinette's severed head.\n\nStyle\n\nLady Gaga, Ariana Grande, Tom Cruise, and More A-Listers Pack the Stands at Paris Olympics for Return of Simone Biles\n\nStars poured into Bercy Arena on Saturday to watch the renowned American gymnast compete for the gold.\n\nFashion\n\nThrough Bill Cunningham’s Lens, the Glitz and Drama of an Era-Defining Fashion Show\n\nAn exclusive early look at the photographer’s treasure trove, published together for the first time in The Battle of Versailles: The Fashion Showdown of 1973.\n\nHollywood\n\nRobert Downey Jr. Returns to The Avengers, But Not as Iron Man\n\nThe Iron Man star will play iconic villain Doctor Doom in Marvel's next two Avengers movies.\n\nAward Season\n\nJoan Chen Has Always Been a Movie Star. Hollywood Is Finally Catching Up\n\nThe veteran actor has worked with Bernardo Bertolucci, David Lynch, and Ang Lee, and maintained rich careers in both China and the US. With the new film Dìdi, Oscar buzz is trailing her for the first time. What took so long?\n\nTelevision\n\nThese 2024 Summer Olympic Athletes Have Main-Character Energy\n\nFrom a cheese-wheel-toting Italian gymnast to an Egyptian fencer who competed while seven months pregnant, here’s a guide to the athletes who went viral at the Paris Games.\n\nRoyals\n\nDuchess Sophie Moved to Tears at the 2024 Paris Olympics\n\nPrince William and Kate Middleton are unlikely to make an appearance at this year’s Olympics despite its close proximity to the UK, but Princess Anne and Duchess Sophie have already witnessed a few history-making moments.\n\nTelevision\n\nThe 25 Best Shows on HBO and Max to Watch Right Now\n\nStop aimlessly scrolling: We’ve got all the recommendations you need.\n\nTelevision\n\nThe 2024 Summer Olympics Are Best as a Streaming Event\n\nWatching the Paris games via the Peacock app has greatly expanded our Olympics diet.\n\nPolitics\n\nCould Global Tensions Puncture the Olympic Bubble?\n\nThe Olympics are often viewed as a respite from politics, but multiple wars and rising global tensions will be hard to ignore this year. “I’m here to bring awareness,” says Valerie Tarazi, a swimmer representing Palestine at the 2024 Summer Games."
