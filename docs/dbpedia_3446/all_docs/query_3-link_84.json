        "text": "If it hadn't been for the Covid-19 pandemic and its lockdowns, Kristin Scott Thomas would never have encountered Diana Taverner, the MI5 chief of operations, a role she has played in Slow Horses for its past two seasons (the first two episodes of the second season aired on Apple TV+ on Friday, December 2). In early 2020, the French-British actress, who now lives in the county of Rutland, not far from London, was preparing to appear on stage at the National Theatre to play the eponymous Phaedra, in an adaptation by Simon Stone. The tragedy was carried away in the crisis and much to the regret of Ms. Scott Thomas, who said \"And that's how I came to do this instead. It's a sort of compensation. But all the same, it is a pleasure to be working with Gary Oldman [who plays Jackson Lamb, the spy put out to pasture by his bosses and has an ambiguous relationship with Diana Taverner].\"\n\nIt's been a long time since the actor, who played in the English Patient (for which she received an Oscar nomination for Best Actress in 1997) has starred in a TV series: \"I did it in my early days, in a miniseries, when millions of people watched the same thing, at the same time on their TVs. Today, you can watch it on a phone.\" Despite this reservation, Ms. Scott Thomas didn't hesitate long before accepting the offer to join the Slow Horses cast: \"It's another way of working that intrigues me â€“ long form. That's what interested me even more than the character; to do something that would go on for years, and to be part of a kind of company. The thing I like least about making films is its isolated form.\"\n\nAnd the character is not without appeal: An elegant, cold woman of whom we know nothing except her professional life caught between her ungovernable band of spies and barely trustworthy political authorities. \"With Gary Oldman, I have a kind of role interaction, we manage to find stories [about our characters] that we can suggest,\" she said. \"Even though she is very ambitious, you can sense in her a kind of frustration, a weariness of politics, that many people will understand. But I'm not in love with Diana Taverner the way I've been in love with some of my characters in the past.\"\n\n'We have to work fast'\n\nShe may owe her fame to prominent roles in popular films such as Four Weddings and a Funeral (1994) or The English Patient (1996), but Ms. Scott Thomas' sense of adventure should not be underestimated. She embarked on her film career working under Prince, the most incongruous of directors, who offered her the female lead in Under the Cherry Moon (1986), which was one of the most spectacular flops of the 1980s. This did not prevent her from immediately correcting her trajectory to work under directors such as Jean-Pierre Mocky, Pascal Bonitzer, Brian De Palma, Lucian Pintilie, Robert Altman, Catherine Corsini and Nicolas Winding Refn. \"I've always done a lot of things that take me to places where I'm not necessarily in my comfort zone,\" she said."
