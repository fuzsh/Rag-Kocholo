As someone who firmly believes that Ludivine Sagnier and Kristin Scott Thomas are two of the finest actresses working today in any country, watching them go head-to-head against each other was obviously something I was going to be looking forward to. When it came to Love Crime, the story lacked a little bit of punch but seeing them go at it wasn't disappointing in the least. Both women are at the top of their game here, with Thomas taking some inspiration from Glenn Close in a very cold and cerebral Patty Hewes-esque role while Sagnier expertly utilizes her skill for vulnerability and sexuality.

I was hoping the whole thing would pack some real heat, so I was disappointed that it was a lot more slow-moving than I thought and wasn't as thrilling as something like this should be, but that's not to say that it didn't keep me interested throughout. The concept was pretty unique for this kind of film and it's hard to get into without bordering on spoiler territory, but I was very curious as to how the events were going to unfold. It felt like you knew what the endgame was, but seeing how the story got to that point was very intriguing. At the end of the day though, the film is all about being able to watch these great talents bounce off each other, with slightly less impact than I was expecting.
