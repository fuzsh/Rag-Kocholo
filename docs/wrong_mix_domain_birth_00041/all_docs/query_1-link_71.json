[Quiz]\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHis biological father, Joseph Toney, was not a part of his upbringing, a factor that significantly shaped Shaq's approach to fatherhood.\n\nHis athletic prowess was evident in high school, and he quickly became a standout player at Louisiana State University.\n\nShaq's dominance on the court led to him being the first overall pick in the 1992 NBA Draft by the Orlando Magic.\n\nNBA career and achievements\n\nHe had a 19-year career in the National Basketball Association (NBA) for the Orlando Magic, Los Angeles Lakers, Miami Heat, Phoenix Suns, Cleveland Cavaliers and Boston Celtics.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHe won four NBA championships, 2000, 2001, 2002 and 2006, three with the Lakers and one with the Heat. Known for his powerful dunks, exceptional footwork, and larger-than-life personality, Shaq was a force to be reckoned with on the court.\n\nNBA Legend Shaq O'Neal Pulse Live Kenya\n\nREAD: Tyler Perry's Biography: Son, net worth, most popular shows & industry scandals\n\nHe earned 15 All-Star selections, three Finals MVP awards, and was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame in 2016.\n\nBeyond Basketball\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nShaq's life off the court is as impressive as his basketball career. He has ventured into various fields, including acting, music, business, and philanthropy.\n\nKnown for his charismatic personality, Shaq has starred in movies, released rap albums, and even earned a doctoral degree in education.\n\nHis business acumen has seen him invest in numerous ventures, from owning restaurants to endorsing products.\n\nShaq O'Neal's net worth is estimated to be over $400 million.\n\nMarriage and children\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn 2002, Shaquille O'Neal married Shaunie Nelson. The couple had four children together: Shareef, Amirah, Shaqir, and Me'arah.\n\nAdditionally, Shaq has a daughter, Taahirah, from a previous relationship with Arnetta Yardbourgh, and Shaunie has a son, Myles, from a prior relationship whom Shaq took up as his.\n\nShaq O'Neal's and his daughter Taahirah Pulse Live Kenya\n\nShareef O'Neal\n\nThis is perhaps the most well-known among Shaq's children due to his own burgeoning basketball career.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBorn on January 11, 2000, Shareef has followed in his father's footsteps, playing college basketball and displaying significant potential.\n\nDespite facing health challenges, including heart surgery, Shareef continues to pursue his dreams in basketball with his fatherâ€™s unwavering support.\n\nShaq O'Neal and his son Shareef O'Neal Pulse Live Kenya\n\nREAD: What 19 of the most successful people in the world were doing in their teens and early 20s\n\nAmirah O'Neal\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBorn on November 13, 2001, Amirah has also shown interest in basketball, playing at the collegiate level.\n\nHer commitment to the sport and academic achievements reflect the values instilled by her father.\n\nPulse Live Kenya\n\nShaqir O'Neal\n\nBorn on April 19, 2003, Shaqir is another promising athlete in the family.

Here are some of the most notable customisations:\n\nClothing and footwear\n\nFinding clothes and shoes that fit Shaq has always been a challenge. His shoe size is a whopping 22, which means regular stores simply don't stock footwear in his size.\n\nAs a result, Shaq has custom shoes made to ensure they provide the support and comfort he needs. His clothing is also tailor-made, from his suits to casual wear, to accommodate his large frame.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nPulse Live Kenya\n\nVehicles\n\nStandard cars are not designed for someone of Shaq's size.

Shaq's love for cars extends to his collection of trucks and SUVs, all of which have been adapted to his unique needs.\n\nPulse Live Kenya\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHomes and furniture\n\nLiving spaces also require special attention for Shaq. His homes are built with higher ceilings and larger doorways to provide ample space.\n\nEven his furniture, including beds and chairs, are custom-made to ensure they can support his weight and height."
