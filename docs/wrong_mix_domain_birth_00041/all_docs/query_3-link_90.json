        "text": "Hey\n\nI live in Canada & know very little about resources for genealogy in the USA.\n\nI decided to try doing Shaquille O'Neal's genealogy.\n\nSo far I got this but without any dates so proof is needed.\n\nShaquille O'Neal born in Newark, New Jersey March 6 1972\n\nLucille O'Neal & Joseph/Joe Toney (unwed)\n\nOdessa Chambers & Sirlester O'Neal wed possibly Dublin, Laurens, Georgia\n\nScillar Wright & Hilton O'Neal wed possibly in New Jersey or Georgia\n\nGeorge O'Neal wed Sarah ? likely in Laurens County, Georgia.\n\nI found via much digging online Sarah could be a Dorsey or Dawson but that's ONLY a guess & I'm not good at guessing.\n\nAnyone finding me dates or proof I'm on the right track just jump right in.\n\nLike I said outside of asking Shaq or Lucille to name their ancestors I am stuck.\n\nI should stick to Canadian genealogy.\n\nI read online this line leads to the O'Neal Plantation in Laurens Georgia & freed slaves but again people can say anything online.\n\nThanks for any help.\n\nGilberte"
