        "text": "When you think of a 90-year-old, “energetic” doesn’t seem to be one of the first things that comes to mind. And yet, William Shatner feels just that, as a 93-year-old, revealing how that can be possible.\n\nWhile attending the premiere of his new documentary, You Can Call Me Bill, on Thursday (March 21), Shatner told People what has helped him to remain youthful and engaged with his work.\n\nShatner’s Secret To Youth\n\nThe Star Trek alum tells the publication his secret to youth is: “Just staying engaged in life, to stay curious.” However, he chalks it up to luck with having a lot to do with your health. Adding that life and soul energy are also a product of health, you can’t be energetic when you’re sick. For his “luck,” Shatner’s been healthy “all my life.”\n\nGiving his better half kudos for adding to his youthful energy, Shatner says his wife of 19 years, Elizabeth Martin is responsible. He calls Martin, 64, the “zest of life. She brings the flavor.”\n\nOf his 93rd birthday Friday (March 22), Shatner doesn’t really care for “glorifying in it.” However, when it comes to his upcoming documentary, Shatner caved in after being asked over and over to do one. The reason why he previously turned down documentaries about his life is because they seem so “deadly,” as if it is his goodbye to the world. Because of his daughters Leslie, 65, Lisabeth, 62, and Melanie, 59, Shatner’s new film has enabled him to create a “legacy” for his kids.\n\nRELATED: William Shatner Overcomes Fear Of Sharks By Swimming With Them\n\nYou Can Call Me Bill looks at Shatner’s decades-long career, including life after his famous role as Captain James T. Kirk in Star Trek. The documentary was fully financed by over 1,200 fans, who raised $750,000 in just four days, per IndieWire. The film is now in select theaters.\n\nThese Celebrities Have March Birthdays\n\nLaila Abuelhawa is the Top 40 and Hip-Hop pop culture writer for Beasley Media Group.
