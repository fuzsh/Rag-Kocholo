        "text": "A few days ago, four-time NBA champion Shaquille O’Neal revealed he almost went to the Dallas Mavericks after his time playing for the Los Angeles Lakers. Now, he just admitted a hot take about Dirk Nowitzki’s wife and how he learned who she was.\n\nEveryone was abuzz with the prospect of an O’Neal and Nowitzki pairing, as the former himself revealed his attempts to join the Dallas Mavericks in 2004 when leaving the Lakers. However, the Purple and Gold’s front office was unwilling to trade him to another Western Conference team without receiving the German superstar in return.\n\nO’Neal, arguably the most physically dominant player in NBA history, would have been a constant force in the paint. His ability to overpower defenders with raw strength and size would have forced teams to double-team him, opening up opportunities for his teammates. Shaq’s presence alone would have been a daunting challenge for any opposing team to overcome during his career in the league.\n\nOn the other side, Dirk Nowitzki’s finesse and skill would have presented a completely different set of problems during his 20-year run in the NBA. The master of the fadeaway jumper, Dirk could score from anywhere on the court, and his three-point shooting would have created spacing issues for defenders, making it nearly impossible to contain both him and Shaq simultaneously. Dirk’s versatility and basketball IQ would have complemented Shaq’s brute force perfectly, creating a formidable duo that could have dominated the league.\n\nNBA Analyst Shaquille O’Neal Trends Over Wild Take About Dallas Mavericks Star Dirk Nowitzki’s Wife\n\nAlong with the revelation of O’Neal’s almost-trade to the Mavericks, the Los Angeles Lakers legend also shared how he met Nowitzki’s wife. In a video shared on X, O’Neal recounted his funny perspective on the said moment.\n\n“I found out accidentally… One day it was this gorgeous person standing back there. I was like oh & they were like that’s [his] wife… I knew that he likes the chocolate bars,” O’Neal said.\n\nThe Mavericks’ franchise player met Jessica Olsson in 2010 and the couple got married two years later. They have a daughter born in 2013, and two sons in 2015 and 2016, respectively.\n\nEven after retiring from the league, both O’Neal and Nowitzki have come out with amusing stories during their time in the NBA. This one, though, about Nowitzki’s wife may end up taking the cake for both icons.\n\nFor More Great Basketball Content"
