        "text": "At the close of the twentieth century, the multimedia marketing of products was applied to celebrities. Shaquille O'Neal, or \"Shaq,\" was one of the pioneers in this area. A star basketball player for the Orlando Magic and the Los Angeles Lakers, O'Neal quickly branched out into motion pictures and popular music. O'Neal also attached his name to children's toys, video game cameos, clothing, and basketball shoes. A star of the court, the television, the radio, the music video, and the screen, O'Neal's seven-foot presence has been felt across the commercial spectrum, epitomizing changes in the sports industry.\n\nOn March 6, 1972, Shaquille Rashaun O'Neal was born in Newark, New Jersey. O'Neal's biological father left the family, and O'Neal and his mother moved to San Antonio. His mother and a his stepfather raised O'Neal, offering and abundance of food and discipline along the way. After high school in Texas, O'Neal set off to Louisiana State University and stardom. After his freshman year in college, O'Neal thundered into national prominence. He was named national player of the year by AP and UPI in 1991, and was a unanimous first team All-American in 1991 and 1992. His size and power sometimes drew three defenders, leaving teammates unguarded. But even with O'Neal, LSU was unable to go far in the NCAA championship tournament.\n\nO'Neal left college after his junior year and was the first pick in the 1992 NBA draft. He had an instant impact in the National Basketball Association (NBA) and was the 1993 NBA Rookie of the Year. He quickly led Orlando's nascent franchise to the playoffs and repeatedly made the All-Star team. Although other talented players played for the Magic, it was O'Neal's massive presence that gave them an unmatchable weapon. In 1995 he helped the Magic reach the NBA finals, where the team and O'Neal were swept (4-0) by Hakeem Olajuwan and the Houston Rockets. As a member of the Dream Team, O'Neal enjoyed Olympic gold. But O'Neal had difficulty convincing critics into considering him as one of basketball's great players. When he was named to the NBA's 50 Greatest Players, many critics questioned his worthiness.\n\nO'Neal's size, strength, and athleticism are unmatched. Never before has a basketball player possessed such controlled power. At 7′1\" and 300 pounds, O'Neal is a giant among giants. But even opponents who come close to O'Neal's size cannot equal his strength and agility. During the 1998 playoffs, a similarly sized Utah Jazz center, Greg Ostertag (7-2, 280 lbs.), compared guarding O'Neal to attempting to stop a speeding truck by yanking on a chain. O'Neal's power and size have allowed him to knock aside other giants. His trademark \"Shaq Attaq\" is a dunk so powerful, that few players can stop it. In an effort to contain Shaq, other teams foul him with abandon and exploit his greatest weakness: free-throw shooting. Most analysts agree O'Neal could become unstoppable if he mastered the free-throw.\n\nWhen O'Neal's contract with Orlando expired, he attracted the largest NBA contract in history. He signed with the Los Angeles Lakers for 120 million dollars. In joining the Lakers, O'Neal rejected a larger offer from Orlando. O'Neal's decision was based on the allure of the Lakers' championship tradition, and by the close proximity to Hollywood. Whatever additional millions Orlando offered could not be matched by the prospects of the show business. O'Neal's move to Los Angeles reflected the evolving merger of sports with other entertainment industries. Star players often calculated their access to national television and other publicity. A high profile could lead to multimillion-dollar endorsements. By becoming a Laker, O'Neal could cash in on his larger-than-life (and larger-than-court) status.\n\nO'Neal's salary, unthinkable only ten years earlier, showed the value of a marquee name: a player of O'Neal's status had the power to drive television ratings, ticket prices, \"luxury box\" seating sales, corporate sponsorships, and even public financing of arenas. Although quality players were perceived as valuable by any team, none drew as much attention as a quality player with a name-brand persona. Where city rivalries and team names once clashed, a new merchandising ethic promoted a contest of star players. For example, what was once advertised as a game between Los Angeles and New York became a battle between Shaq and Patrick Ewing. More than ever before profit became the name of the game, and more than ever before profit became linked to charismatic players. In the new era of player as product, Shaquille O'Neal was at center stage.\n\n—Dylan Clark\n\nFurther Reading:\n\nGorman, Jerry, and Kirk Calhoun, with Skip Rozin, The Name of the Game: The Business of Sports.
