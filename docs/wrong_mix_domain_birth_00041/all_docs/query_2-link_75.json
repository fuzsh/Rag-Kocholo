        "text": "You can live large, but you don’t have to always actually live large.\n\nNBA legend Shaquille O’Neal has purchased vast residences through the years, including a 31,000-square-foot, 12-bedroom mega-mansion known as “Shaq-apulco” in Orlando.\n\nBut he still appreciates the modest things, too.\n\nIn an interview with The Dallas Morning News last year, O’Neal said that when he was a youngster in San Antonio he was used to smaller homes, but “it was OK to have a [big house], a five-bedroom house with a person who’s living by myself, I think that’s fine. I think that’s plenty.”\n\nThat was in reference to his 5,269-square-foot gated community home in Carrollton. It’s small by Shaq standards.\n\nHowever, according to recent reports, he’s added to his square footage in North Texas with another home —a 4,670-square-foot, six-bedroom house in Heath in Rockwall County.\n\nHome is Where The Shaq Is\n\nCandysDirt.com’s Brenda Masse had the news in April, reporting that O’Neal is moving into the Ridge Lakes community. Investment management firm Chexy Trust purchased the Heath home in April, according to Rockwall County property records.\n\nChexy Trust is also listed as the owner of Shaq’s home in Carrollton.\n\nZac Gideo, an agent for Rogers Healy and Associates Real Estate, trumpeted on Instagram in 2022 that he helped O’Neal purchase his Carrollton home.\n\n“I found him the perfect home, and most of the process was done virtually — Facetime calls, videos of the property, etc.,” Gideo said in a statement.\n\nGideo reportedly was the same agent in the Heath deal. The Realtor did not respond to messages for comment.\n\nAccording to reports, O’Neal’s home in Heath was built in 2017 and described as a “harmonious blend of contemporary modern Mediterranean architecture.” It includes a saltwater pool with a waterfall complete with a 500-square-foot guest house, a tight fit for a 7-foot-1 big guy.\n\nO’Neal made no secret that he’s set up a place in Heath. Nearby, Rockwall residents posted photos of O’Neal visiting Walmart, The Home Depot, and Raising Cane’s. O’Neal loves fried chicken and stays close to North Texas to monitor the Big Chicken restaurant chain he fronts.\n\nO’Neal, who longed to play for the Dallas Mavericks and Mark Cuban, listed North Texas as a place to retire when the time comes. He’s about a decade away from qualifying for Social Security.\n\n“When I get close to retirement, I’m looking to go down to the Southlake area,” he said. “So I’ll definitely get me a monster there.”"
