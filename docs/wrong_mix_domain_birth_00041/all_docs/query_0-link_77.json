She said, “I bet you threw that yodel in just for me!” Special skills: Lariat trick roping, guitar, drums, piano, creepiness Something you're REALLY bad at: DIRECTIONS. I have no internal compass. First Broadway show you ever saw: Footloose when I was 16 If you could go back in time and catch any performance, what would it be? Sunday in the Park with George Current show—other than your own—that you have been recommending to friends: Fuerza Bruta\n\nSleep No More Favorite showtune(s) of all time: “Come Down Now” from Passing Strange\n\n“Shiksa Goddess” from Last Five Years Some favorite modern musicals: Hedwig and the Angry Inch, Passing Strange, Parade Favorite classic musical: Oliver! Stage or screen stars of the past you would most have loved to perform with: Charlie Chaplin, Gwen Verdon, Heath Ledger Your personal vocal idols, living or dead: Buddy Holly, John Lennon The one performance – attended - that you will never forget: Final Saturday night taping of Passing Strange. I’d never seen a roof be blown off a theatre like that before. I was weeping like a baby. Music that makes you cry, any genre: Régine Chassagne, the female vocalist in Arcade Fire. There’s something so beautifully desperate in her voice. MAC or PC? .me in a cloud Most played song on your iPod: “Behold a Marvel in the Sky” by Deerhoof Most-visited websites: metafilter.com Last book you read: \"Cosmos\" by Carl Sagan Must-see TV show(s): \"Breaking Bad\"!!! Last good movie you saw: \"The Skin I Live In\" Some films you consider classics: \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest\"\n\n\"Pee Wee’s Big Adventure\"\n\n\"The Deerhunter\"\n\n\"Koyaanisqatsi\" Performer you would drop everything to go see: Deerhoof Pop culture guilty pleasure: YouTube videos of skateboarding accidents Favorite cities: Brooklyn, Austin, Prague Favorite sport/team/player: Dirk Nowitzki on the Mavericks makes it look so easy. First CD/Tape/LP you owned: \"Shaq-Fu\" was the first CD I ever owned. It came with the Sega videogame \"Shaq-Fu\" where Shaquille O’Neal fought at a kung-fu tournament. He rapped on the accompanying CD, and it was awful! Greatest Bands of all Time: The Beatles, ELO, GREEN DAY! Favorite or most memorable onstage role as a child/teenager: I played Will in Will Rogers Follies at the Governor’s School for the Arts in Norfolk, VA when I was 16.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n&amp;lt;a href='http://ox1.playbill.com/www/delivery/ck.php?n=a0b85aad&amp;amp;amp;cb=990243672' target='_blank'&amp;gt;&amp;lt;img src='http://ox1.playbill.com/www/delivery/avw.php?zoneid=10&amp;amp;amp;source=news&amp;amp;amp;cb=990243672&amp;amp;amp;n=a0b85aad' border='0' alt='' /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;\n\nIt was a thrilling production where we used sets and costumes from the 1st National Tour and a orchestra of 30 professionals! Not your normal high school experience... Moment you knew you wanted to perform for a living: I saw a children’s theatre production of Mother Goose by the Hurrah Players when I was 8. After the show, I told my mom, “I can do that.” I later joined the Hurrah Players and became very inspired by Hugh Copeland to fall in love with theatre. How you got your Equity card: Hairspray in Vegas Favorite pre-/post- show meal: (note where) PRE: Chipotle tacos\n\nPOST: La Superior tacos Favorite liquid refreshment: VITA COCO. Like sticking a straw in a coconut. Pre-show rituals or warm-ups: I listen to music, drink tea, and stretch A LOT. Most vocally challenging role you've performed: Johnny in American Idiot Worst flubbed line/missed cue/onstage mishap: Because of a last-minute backstage microphone swap in American Idiot, I missed my usual entrance at the top of the stairs for “Letterbomb.” As I’m running to enter late from the wings instead, I made a split-second decision to dive and roll like a human tumbleweed across the stage. I must have rolled three times -- each one getting more air than the last before crashing into Will’s couch -- but got there right on time! Worst costume ever: In Hairspray, in the song “Without Love,” I had to be a dancing silhouette in the female jail because there weren’t enough ladies in the cast to fill all of the slots on the set. I wore a very large wig and a corset on top of my normal Sketch costume and wiggled quite girly. I hated putting that wig on everyday. Favorite Green Day tunes not in the show: \"Geek Stink Breath\"\n\n\"Burnout\"\n\n\"Pulling Teeth\" If you could trade roles/tracks with anyone in the show for a week, who would it be? WILL! Any cities on the itinerary you're particularly excited to visit: Seattle and San Francisco! Never been... Leading man role you've been dying to play: George in Sunday in the Park with George Leading lady role you wish you could play: Dot in Sunday in the Park with George Something about you that surprises people: I was an Elvis impersonator ages 13-16. Enough said. Something you are incredibly proud of: Billie Joe proposed to me onstage at the encore one night."
