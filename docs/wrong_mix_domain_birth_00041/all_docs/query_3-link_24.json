        "text": "Shaquille O'Neal will be enshrined into the Basketball Hall of Fame on Friday after a career that saw him make six different NBA stops and sport a multitude of different looks -- and almost as many self-appointed nicknames.\n\nCole High School\n\nO'Neal burst onto the scene at Cole High School in San Antonio, where he led his team to a 36-0 record and a state championship as a senior.\n\nLSU Tigers\n\nIn three seasons at LSU, O'Neal was twice named SEC Player of the Year and became the No. 1 pick in the 1992 NBA draft. A statue of O'Neal in his famed two-handed dunking pose now stands on LSU's campus.\n\nOrlando Magic\n\nO'Neal arrived in Orlando in 1992, becoming the young franchise's first superstar. He won NBA Rookie of the Year honors, averaging 23.4 PPG and a career-high 13.9 RPG in his first season.\n\nWestern University Dolphins\n\nDuring the offseason following his rookie year, O'Neal went back to college -- at the fictional Western University as part of the movie \"Blue Chips.\" It was on the set of that movie where he bonded with Anfernee Hardaway, urging the Magic to acquire the point guard in the 1993 NBA draft.\n\n1994 U.S. men's national team\n\nAfter being passed over for the Dream Team for Christian Laettner, O'Neal made his U.S. national team debut in 1994 at the FIBA World Championship, leading the team known as \"Dream Team II\" to a gold medal.\n\nOrlando Magic\n\nIn 1995, O'Neal led the Magic to the NBA Finals, where they were swept by the Houston Rockets. It would turn out to be the high point of O'Neal's time in Orlando.\n\n1996 U.S. men's national team\n\nO'Neal returned to Team USA for the Olympics in 1996, leading the squad to gold in Atlanta.\n\nLos Angeles Lakers\n\nWhen O'Neal arrived in Los Angeles in 1996, the Lakers still wore their classic jerseys associated with the Showtime Lakers of the 1980s.\n\nLos Angeles Lakers\n\nThe Lakers changed to their modern look in 1999-2000, when O'Neal led the team to its first of three consecutive NBA championships.\n\nMinneapolis Lakers\n\nThe Lakers moved from Minneapolis to Los Angeles in 1960 -- 12 years before O'Neal was born. But during his time in L.A., the team wore these throwback uniforms, giving fans a glimpse of what he might have looked like lining up next to George Mikan.\n\nLos Angeles \"Shaw\"s?\n\nThey say the name on the front of the jersey is more important than the one on the back. In this case, O'Neal turned that name on the front of his jersey into that of Brian Shaw -- his teammate in both Los Angeles and Orlando.\n\nMiami Heat\n\nIn 2004, O'Neal was traded to the Heat and returned to Florida in style, recreating his look from his first photo shoot with the Magic.\n\nMiami Floridians\n\nO'Neal in the ABA would have been a sight to see -- and the Heat gave fans an idea of what that might have looked like when they sported these Floridians throwbacks.\n\nPhoenix Suns\n\nAfter three-plus years in South Florida, the Big Cactus landed in Phoenix, where he made his final All-Star appearance as a member of the Suns in 2009.\n\nCleveland Cavaliers\n\n\"Win a ring for the King\" was O'Neal's mantra when he arrived in Cleveland for the 2009-10 season, but he and LeBron James fell short of that goal.\n\nCleveland Cavaliers\n\nThough he only played 53 games as a member of the Cavaliers, O'Neal wore five different jerseys during his time in Cleveland, including these 1980s-era throwbacks.\n\nBoston Celtics\n\nO'Neal's final stop on his NBA journey was Boston, where he suited up for the Celtics and faced off against former Lakers teammate Kobe Bryant one last time.\n\nBasketball Hall of Fame\n\nWhen he was announced as a member of the Basketball Hall of Fame, O'Neal was given an honorary jersey -- though it has an unfamiliar number and looks a bit too small."
