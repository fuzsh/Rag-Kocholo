        "text": "QUICK FACTS\n\nActivities Actor , Executive Producer , Executive Producer\n\nReal name Shaquille Rashaun O’Neal\n\nNationality USA\n\nBirth March 6, 1972 (New Jersey – United States)\n\nBIOGRAPHY\n\nOne of the most dominant athletes of his sport and his position, Shaquille Rashaun O’Neal was a professional basketball player, currently a commentator, analyst and actor, born on March 6, 1972, in Newark, New Jersey. Standing 2.15 meters tall and weighing 120 kilos, which did not diminish his agility of movement, O’Neal began to stand out in sports during high school, at the Robert G. Cole School in San Antonio, where his team had a record of 68 wins and only 1 loss. From there he obtained an athletic scholarship to Louisiana State University, where he pursued business studies and was part of the Omega Psi Phi fraternity. He played three seasons at the state, showing a dominance rarely seen, with high numbers in points, rebounds and assists, which took him to the university hall of fame. O’Neal was selected in the first position of the 1992 NBA draft by the Orlando Magic, with whom he achieved a dream first season, named rookie of the year and all star. His subsequent seasons with the Magic were solid, and they led the team to a final appearance. “Shaq” soon became a popular icon, a player who went beyond professional sports and became an idol among sports fans and also among those who were not, with a musical, acting and comedy career. Four-time league champion, with the Los Angeles Lakers and the Miami Heat, in his sports career, O’Neal was a 15-time all-star, 3-time Finals MVP and 3-time All-Star Game participant, retiring, with the Boston Celtics, in June 2011. From then on, Shaq began working on television as a commentator and analyst for the NBA, in addition to participating as an actor in different comedies such as Son como niños 2 (2013 ) , Luna Honey Family (2014), Uncle Drew (2018) and Hubie’s Halloween (2020), among others."
