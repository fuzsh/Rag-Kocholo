        "text": "(born 1972). As one of the most popular and highest-paid players in the National Basketball Association (NBA), Shaquille O’Neal overwhelmed the competition with his intimidating size and outstanding skills. A 7-foot-1-inch (2.16-meter) center who weighed at least 315 pounds (142.9 kilograms), “Shaq” was nevertheless an agile athlete. He was consistently one of the top players in the league in scoring and blocking. Along with teammate Kobe Bryant and coach Phil Jackson, O’Neal led the Los Angeles Lakers to three consecutive NBA championships (2000–02).\n\nShaquille Rashaun O’Neal was born on March 6, 1972, in Newark, N.J. His first name means “little one” in Arabic, and his middle name means “warrior.” His father was a United States army sergeant, and military transfers caused Shaquille and his family to move frequently.\n\nAt age 13 O’Neal, already 6 feet 6 inches (1.98 meters) tall, met Louisiana State University (LSU) head basketball coach Dale Brown, who made an early pitch for O’Neal to join his team. In 1987 the family moved to San Antonio, Tex., where O’Neal’s outstanding performance for his high school team launched an intense recruiting war among colleges and universities. O’Neal ultimately chose LSU, where his game improved enormously. Assisted by Brown and Hall of Fame centers Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Bill Walton, O’Neal developed a combination of strength, speed, and agility that made him a formidable opponent and a hot prospect for the pros.\n\nAgainst the wishes of his parents, O’Neal dropped out of school in April 1992 to become available for the upcoming NBA draft. Several months later, as the first draft pick, the 20-year-old center was signed by the Orlando Magic for a seven-year, 40-million-dollar contract, becoming the highest-paid rookie in the NBA. (O’Neal later completed his studies, earning a bachelor’s degree from LSU in 2000.)\n\nO’Neal went on to be chosen NBA rookie of the year and won all-rookie first team honors. That year O’Neal’s record in scoring, rebounding, field-goal percentage, and blocked shots made him the only player in the league to finish in the top ten in all four categories. In one game O’Neal’s dunk was so powerful he destroyed the hydraulic basket support system.\n\nAlthough O’Neal was a top scorer, he struggled with free throws, normally scoring on only 50 to 60 percent of his shots. His opponents often resorted to a strategy known as “hack-a-Shaq”—intentionally fouling him before he could shoot a field goal and thus sending him to the free-throw line instead. O’Neal complained that he regularly took a beating on the court with officials calling only a fraction of the fouls committed against him.\n\nAfter four years with the Magic, O’Neal was lured by the Los Angeles Lakers in 1996 into signing a record-setting seven-year, 120-million-dollar contract. Although the Lakers’ record improved with O’Neal as center, the team was unable to reach the NBA finals until after the 1999–2000 season, the first with Phil Jackson as head coach. Under Jackson, O’Neal developed into more of a team player, paying greater attention to his defense and rebounding. In 2000 the Lakers won the NBA championship, and O’Neal was named the most valuable player (MVP) of the regular season, the All-Star Game, and the NBA finals. The Lakers captured the NBA championship title again in 2001 and 2002. O’Neal was named the MVP of the finals for both years. The Lakers returned to NBA finals in 2004 but were defeated. Soon thereafter the team underwent major changes, chief among them a trade that sent O’Neal to the Miami Heat. O’Neal helped lead that team to its first NBA championship, in 2006.\n\nIn 1993 O’Neal wrote an autobiography with a coauthor. He later released rap CDs and appeared in the feature films Blue Chips (1994) and Kazaam (1996). In addition, O’Neal had multimillion-dollar endorsement contracts. In 2007 he starred in a reality television series in which he helped kids become physically fit.\n\nIn February 2008 O’Neal was traded to the Phoenix Suns. His playing style did not mix well with the Suns’ up-tempo game, however, and—despite having had a very solid 2008–09 season—he was traded to the Cleveland Cavaliers in June 2009. Following the completion of the 2009–10 season, O’Neal signed a two-year contract to play with the Boston Celtics but an Achilles tendon injury limited his play. O’Neal retired after the 2010–11 season. His career totals include 28,596 points (the seventh highest total in NBA history at the time of his retirement) and 15 All-Star game appearances."
