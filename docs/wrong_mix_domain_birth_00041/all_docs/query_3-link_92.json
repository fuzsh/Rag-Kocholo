        "text": "Godfrey is one of the hottest comedians on the circuit. Growing up in Chicago, he constantly got in trouble for misbehaving and being an all-­ around class clown. Godfrey’s Nigerian parents unknowingly encouraged his bad behavior by showing him classic comedy films from an early age. While performing impressions of his college football teammates, Godfrey realized his irreverent style of comedy might be more than just a hobby.\n\nAs soon as Godfrey went pro, he immediately landed several high profile projects. Ben Stiller cast him to play himself in “Zoolander,” a performance that has since achieved cult status. Godfrey’s more recent film roles in “Johnson Family Vacation,” “The Cook Out” with Queen Latifah, “Phat Girlz” starring Monique, and “Soul Plane,” alongside Snoop Dogg.\n\nGodfrey is perhaps best known for his stint as the “7UP Guy” in the beloved 7UP national campaign. Godfrey has also made many television appearances including performing on “Late Night with Jimmy Fallon” and recently starred in his own one-­‐hour special for Comedy Central,\n\n\"Godfrey: Black By Accident.\" Godfrey recently recurred on FX's “Louie” and also played the lead in a pilot for that network called “Bronx Warrants.” He developed an animated pilot for FOX that was based on his comedy act, and can regularly be seen on “Shaquille O’Neal’s Upload” on TruTV.\n\nIn addition to his film and television work, Godfrey is one of the hottest comedians on the road today. His one-­‐man show, The Godfrey Complex, was a major hit at the Just For Laughs festival in Montreal. GQ Magazine said that Godfrey \"is set to be one of the biggest\n\nperformers in the US in 12 months,\" following his run at the festival. Godfrey can be seen hosting and headlining some of the most prominent comedy clubs across both coasts including: The Comedy Cellar, the Comic Strip, Caroline's Comedy Club; and The Laugh Factory and The Improv in Los Angeles.\n\nWebsite\n\nInstagram\n\nTwitter\n\n• All Shows Are 21+ Unless Otherwise Stated\n\n• Two Drink minimum Per Person Inside of the Showroom\n\n• Seating is first come, first serve, unless otherwise stated.\n\n• ALL SALES ARE FINAL AND NO REFUNDS WILL BE GIVEN UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES\n\n• All Show Times are subject to change.

He started doing comedy at the age of 21. Prior to comedy, he was an electrician full-time, and a server at chili’s part-time. The workforce was not working out for him. After his first comedy show, he learned it was where he belonged. Justin fell in love with being on the stage and making people laugh. A year and a half later, he quit his jobs to pursue his dream. Justin got on stage as much as he could. Attending open mics. Performing for free at comedy shows and accepting hosting gigs for very little to no money. In efforts to share his comedy with the world, he began making content and posting on social media.\n\nBuzz, traffic, and popularity all grew up and blew up. He decided, with his fiancé Ashley Cotto it was time to leave Connecticut and take the leap of faith to move to Florida. Justin continued to grind and work hard every day to become a bigger act. He wants to create people’s favorite space to laugh and is currently touring in a 2024 Worldwide Tour.\n\nHe believes what you put in this game is what you get out of it.

He grew up in North Carolina and got a bachelor's degree in psychology from Warren Wilson College in Asheville, NC.\n\nHe inherited ten thousand dollars when his grandmother died and moved to LA imagining that the money would last for at least a year. Within a few months he’d spent much of his inheritance on LSD and synthesizers and was forced to get a job so he gave the Comedy Store a CD of prank calls he made in college and was awarded a job answering the phones.\n\nIt’s at The Comedy Store that he developed an irreverent stand up act with a satanic puppet bit as his closer. This got him noticed by Joe Rogan who gave him his start in the world of stand up comedy by taking him out on the road and allowing him to be his sidekick on the scy-fy network series JOE ROGAN QUESTIONS EVERYTHING.\n\nDuncan has performed standup at the famed Montreal Just for Laughs Festival and the Austin, TX Moontower Comedy Festival. Duncan wrote and performed on Fuel TV’s sketch show STUPIDFACE, and guest starred on HBO’s CURB YOUR ENTHUSIASM, Showtime’s LA LA LAND, Fox’s MADTV, and Comedy Central’s NICK SWARDSON’S PRETEND TIME. Duncan also told a true story of a crazy acid trip on Comedy Central’s THIS IS NOT HAPPENING and he has appeared in 5 episodes of Comedy Central’s Emmy-nominated DRUNK HISTORY and Cartoon Network’s Emmy-winning ADVENTURE TIME.\n\nDuncan hopped on the podcasting bandwagon early and in 2010 started The Lavender Hour with his then girlfriend Natasha Leggero, where they discussed deepish issues with comedians. When Duncan and Natasha split in 2012, he started his own podcast, The Duncan Trussell Family Hour.\n\nThe Duncan Trussell Family Hour has nearly 400 episodes and averages 1,000,000 downloads per month. The show features Duncan and comedians, outsiders, spiritual healers, and seekers discussing such topics as spirituality, consciousness, psychedelics, fringe theories, existentialism, and comedy.

Well, they’re both present in the comedy of Anthony Rodia along with relatable, real, and razor sharp observations on marriage, parenthood, road rage, and everything else worthy of a social media rant. Within just two years, his ability to intimately depict life in all of its absurdity has attracted a rabid audience comprised of over 700,000 social media followers with 22million- plus YouTube views. Selling out shows left and right nationwide and appearing on programs such as Elvis Duran and the Morning Show, Good Day New York, and Elizabeth & Elisa on News 12, he quietly claimed the throne of “KING OF OFF THE BOAT COMEDY.”\n\n“I wanted to do something different,” he says. “With each video and at every one of my shows, I’m dragging you into my world. You’re a part of my upbringing, or you’re at home with my wife and kids. I don’t write my humor based on what I think is going to be funny; I write my humor based on what I think people are going to relate to the most. I’ve found you laugh at what you connect with. Anything connected to home makes it even funnier.”\n\nA first generation Italian-American born and raised in Westchester, NY, Anthony loved making people laugh from the first moment he could. His mother kept home videos of her six-year-old son imitating aunts, uncles, and grandparents at Christmastime and leaving the room in stitches. After sneaking downstairs to watch Andrew Dice Clay on New Year’s Eve (without the adults noticing), he developed a lifelong passion for comedy. Citing Richard Pryor, George Carlin, Eddie Murphy, and Robin Williams as formative influences, he never missed an opportunity to pull a prank at school or attract a crowd in the hallway with a spot-on impersonation of a teacher. He dabbled in comedy with a few open mics in his early twenties, but he ultimately took a different career path and became a finance manager of a luxury car dealership.\n\nAfter hearing unstoppable laughter from a movie theater crowd during Deadpool 2, he chose to finally pick up comedy again. As a test run, he filled a local theater with friends and family. Sellouts followed at hotspots such as Caroline’s on Broadway, Governor’s Comedy Club, Levity Live and more. Exiting his day job in 2019, he performed 100 shows in just nine months and increased his social media imprint by nearly 1,000% with a nonstop series of videos. “ROAD RAGE WEDNESDAY” became a fan favorite, but Uncle Vinny and Zia Lucia transformed into a phenomenon. With Anthony playing these insanely lovable characters (house dress and all), he brought the stories from his stage routine to life in cinematic fashion. “Uncle Vinny came by accident, and I had to give him a wife, so I created Zia Lucia who is basically five or six of my aunts rolled into one,” he says. “I have four or five conversations going on in my head at any given time!\n\nAt the same time, he consistently pushed himself. No two videos or shows would ever be the same. “Everybody says I’m crazy, because I’ll say something on stage I just came up with an hour ago,” he admits. “I don’t want the audience to have the same experience twice. The only way I can keep building this business without getting old and tired is to try to be funnier than I was yesterday. That’s the approach I take. Can I push the envelope more? Can I get more creative with my characters? It’s nonstop.”\n\nWith the onset of quarantine, he made the most of a captive audience, delivering a staggering 86 videos in a row. Additionally, he performed his biggest gig yet, a virtual performance livestreamed worldwide from Wall Street Theater in Connecticut closing out the summer 2020.\n\nWith shows planned for legendary spots such as Foxwoods, countless videos, and surprises on the horizon, Anthony willbring everyone even closer with each new routine.\n\n“I channel what you dealt with when you were young, what you’re going through with your spouse, and what you’re experiencing with your kids, and I’m relating it to you,” he leaves off. “It strikes a nerve. I have a way of saying what most people are thinking—but don’t say because they don’t want to offend anybody. I’m really thankful it’s resonated, and I’m not going to stop.”\n\n• All Shows Are 21+ Unless Otherwise Stated\n\n• Two Drink minimum Per Person Inside of the Showroom\n\n• Seating is first come, first serve, unless otherwise stated.\n\n• ALL SALES ARE FINAL AND NO REFUNDS WILL BE GIVEN UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES\n\n• All Show Times are subject to change.

If you understand English, Corey’s humor will tickle your funny bone. People all over the world can relate to the drama of trying to make a relationship work. According to Corey, a “hunter” (man) being captured by his “prey” (woman) makes for the best comedy ever.\n\nCorey offers plenty of advice on how men who have been the victim of a “hostile takeover” by the female in the relationship can take back control. You can believe there is no counselor on the planet who offers the kind of relationship advice and remedies Corey dispenses from the stage. Corey Holcomb’s comedy set is both an auditory and visual experience. His facial gestures alone can make an audience burst with laughter. “I spend a lot of time practicing my stage faces because I need to be able to convey care and concern while I criticize.” Although Corey has a long and diverse resume of successes, he remains humble and approachable.\n\nCorey currently tours the country performing standup & his Comedy/R&B songs. He also hosts his podcast, The Corey Holcomb 5150 Show, which began on The Foxxhole but later moved to YouTube and CoreyHolcomb5150Show.com.\n\nCorey can also be seen bringing funny to the big screen with his role as 'Boonie' on “Adult Swim’s TV series “Black Jesus.”\n\n• All Shows Are 21+ Unless Otherwise Stated\n\n• Two Drink minimum Per Person Inside of the Showroom\n\n• Seating is first come, first serve, unless otherwise stated.\n\n• ALL SALES ARE FINAL AND NO REFUNDS WILL BE GIVEN UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES\n\n• All Show Times are subject to change.

Some of his popular work includes his nine-skit series titled “Thawt in my House,” and his spot-on mom and grand-mom impersonations, which elevated his popularity because of how well audiences related to his characters and situations depicted in his sketches.

This character has catapulted Brooks into a a very well-deserved spotlight and helped him gain national attention and a bigger following.\n\nThe 33-year-old comedian started out doing comedy simply because he enjoyed it and it was fun to do in his spare time.
