        "text": "Matthew Broderick often found himself the victim of muggings when he was younger. The Ferris Bueller’s Day Off star, 61, revealed in a new interview that while growing up on Washington Square North in New York City in the ’70s, he “got mugged often! I’ve been mugged all through the Village, Times Square, Upper West Side,” he shared. Ironically, though, he said, “I never had any money! And people constantly wanted [to mug me].” As to why he was always targeted, Broderick chalked it up to being “a young guy.”\n\n“I’m talking like 12 [years old] — that’s when it happened a lot,” he continued. “It was mostly other boys just being bullies and getting lunch money or something like that. But sometimes, it was somewhat scary.” Broderick recalled a time when he and a friend were skateboarding in Central Park, and a “massive gang came flying out” and stole their skateboards. “I got whacked in the head with some sort of stick! It was not a joke. Thank God, we all survived it,” he added.\n\nIntimidation Tactics and Protective Measures\n\nHowever, Broderick insisted that the times he was mugged “were not like that,” as they were more about the threat of violence, but they didn’t actually get violent. Meanwhile, getting on the subway, Broderick said, “Somebody will sit next to you and put their arm around you rather aggressively and say, ‘What’s in your pocket?’ What’s your name?’ — just be like asking you a lot of questions. [You’re] just waiting, praying for the train to come out of the tunnel on the platform.”\n\nRELATED: Matthew Broderick, Alan Ruck Have Mini ‘Ferris Bueller’ Reunion at ‘Succession’ Premiere\n\nBecause muggings were such a regular occurrence, Broderick said, “Sometimes a police officer would come to our school and give us a talk [about] how to react properly when you’re being mugged. He said: ‘Always bring money with you. Don’t go out with no money and immediately give it up and try to make the experience as fast as possible. The more time you’re haggling or discussing, the more time you’re in this situation, the worse.’ I always remembered that, so [I tried] to reach a conclusion. Even if the conclusion is your own death, do it as quickly as possible,” he joked.\n\nThese Celebrities Have March Birthdays\n\nLaila Abuelhawa is the Top 40 and Hip-Hop pop culture writer for Beasley Media Group.
