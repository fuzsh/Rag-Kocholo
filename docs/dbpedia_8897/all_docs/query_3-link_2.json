        "text": "-- One afternoon in the summer between seventh and eighth grade, Dave Anderson lugged his Fender guitar amp across part of Valley Hill Country Club's golf course to get to Jim Keeling's house.\n\nAnderson had never met Keeling, a young drummer, before. But that night after they jammed, they went to see Atlanta Rhythm Section's show at Von Braun Civic Center, as the venue was called then.\n\nA couple decades down the road, Anderson and Keeling still enjoy Atlanta Rhythm Section shows together. Except Anderson is playing guitar and Keeling drums in the long-running band, whose \"Southern Steely Dan\" sound produced such hits as \"So Into You,\" \"Imaginary Lover\" and \"Spooky.\"\n\n\"It's definitely surreal,\" Anderson says, calling from Clearwater, Fl., where ARS is playing a concert. \"I grew up with these songs.\"\n\nAt ARS gigs, Anderson stands just left of stage right, beside keyboardist Dean Daughtry, who co-wrote \"So Into You.\" When I call Daughtry in his hotel room, he tells me how that 1976 cut, which peaked at number seven, came about. \"Me and Robert Nix, our original drummer who passed away a few years ago, were jamming on (the B.B. King song) 'The Thrill Is Gone,' and that kind of led into 'So Into You.' They've both got those minor-key melodies. \"\n\nThe Wurlitzer electric piano Daughtry played on the studio recording of \"So Into You\" – a song which appears in the 2010 Mark Wahlberg film \"The Fighter\" and has been covered by artists including Peter Frampton - now sits in the Georgia Music Hall of Fame. (ARS was inducted in 1996.) Lately, Daughtry, who moved to Huntsville a few years back, writes on a Yamama Clavinova, which \"looks like a piece of furniture.\"\n\nDaughtry has actually been penning new ARS material, that he says is in the vein of group's classic jazz-soul-pop-rock groove, and e-mailing them to singer Rodney Justo. Justo, the band's original frontman who departed before the hits began to come with the group's next singer Ronnie Hammond, is on his fourth ARS stint.\n\n\"I definitely don't feel like a stranger in the band,\" says the gregarious Justo, who's smoking a cigar on the patio of his Tampa home. \"When I came back this time, it was virtually seamless. And I'll be honest, I've always been an Atlanta Rhythm Section fan and a Ronnie Hammond fan.\"\n\nARS has been a sextet since it formed in Doraville, Ga. in 1970, although more than 25 different musicians have passed through the band's lineup over the years. The current version of ARS features three original members: Daughtry, Justo and bassist Paul Goddard.\n\n\"Me, Dean and Paul, as we've gotten older we've matured,\" Justo says. \"The younger guys bring a new energy to the band and (guitarist) Steve Stone – he's the 'new guy' who's been in the band 26 or 27 years now.\"\n\nARS was formed at Studio One, a kinetic Doraville, Ga. recording facility that also played host to artists such as Lynyrd Skynyrd, Joe South, Dickey Betts and B.J. Thomas.\n\n\"It was like a Las Vegas casino in there – in that you had no idea what was going on in the outside world,\" Justo says. \"We worked until we couldn't stand up any more. I'm not kidding. We'd come into work around five o'clock on an afternoon and we'd work until five or six in the morning the next day.\"\n\nJusto and Daughtry had previously worked together in The Candymen, a group that backed crooner Roy Orbison, known for such early rock 'n' roll classics such as \"Pretty Woman\" and \"Only the Lonely.\" Working with Orbison, Justo noticed the sunglasses-wearing singer's graciousness and how \"he made everyone important – not feel important, there's a difference,\" while Daughtry recalls picking up arrangement tricks, such as composing string parts, while learning Orbison's material.\n\n\"He had a very inspirational voice to play for,\" Daughtry says. It was on an Australian tour The Candymen picked up their first fuzz-tone guitar pedal, a gift from Jimmy Page, the eventual Led Zeppelin founder who at that time was in The Yardbirds, the British blues-pop combo Orbison was touring with.\n\nThat flight to Australia was Daughtry's first time in an airplane.\n\nYears later, ARS afforded Daughtry and the rest of the band a much rarer experience - the chance to play the White House, when fellow Georgian Jimmy Carter was president. \"The White House was something else,\" Daughtry says. \"They have some beautiful antiques in there. We had to go through a lot of security, and we played on the South Lawn, which is a really majestic place.\"\n\nKeeling and Anderson came to their ARS gigs thanks to a nudge from lady luck. Daughtry was actually Keeling's neighbor and heard him drumming away next door, while Anderson was at Sound Cell Recording Studios working on demos with Daughtry and then-ARS singer Andy Anderson, when Daughtry asked him, \"Hey, do you want the gig?\"\n\n\"It was an immediate 'yes,' \" Dave says.\n\nWhen he played his first gig with ARS in 2006, Dave did so with no rehearsals with the band, using just a set list and live DVD to woodshed. Although he pulled it off, Dave was much happier with his second gig.\n\n\"A lot of their music is very intricate and worked out but also spontaneous,\" says Dave, who plays a semi-hollowbody guitar and Les Paul with ARS. \"The biggest thing is to find where to have reverence for the original guitar parts and where are the times to do my own thing with it.\" He regards the 2011-ish return of Justo and Goddard, known for his bass solo on the track \"Another Man's Woman,\" to the lineup as particularly galvanizing.\n\n\"The first show was really cool. It was obviously a little bit looser, because we'd done a lot of shows with the previous lineup, but it was much more organic,\" Dave says.\n\nARS plays about 60 concerts a year, but that number may increase with more original members in the band. This week, ARS will play two Huntsville shows: a 9 p.m. Friday set at Furniture Factory (619 Meridian St., 256-539-8001, tickets $20) and the Harvest for Huntsville benefit 6 p.m. Thursday at AM Booth's Lumberyard (120 Cleveland St., 256-651-3417, tickets $50) for Deep Roots (deeprootsofal.org), a non-profit organization which teaches low-income families how to grow their own food and youths healthy eating habits. \"What's cool about Deep Roots is they're teaching people how to do things that can help make their lives better, as opposed to giving them something,\" Dave says.\n\nIt should be a sweet couple of gigs for Dave Anderson. Not only will his legions of local fans get a chance to see him play live with a classic-rock-radio mainstay, his family will have some full-circle moments.\n\n\"I remember being in the car with my cousins and my Aunt Marie cranking up (the 1978 ARS tune) 'I'm Not Gonna Let It Bother Me Tonight' on the stereo,\" Dave says. \"Man, Aunt Marie was psyched when I told her I was joining Atlanta Rhythm Section.\""
