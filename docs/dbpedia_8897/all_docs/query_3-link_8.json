        "text": "ARS was a spin-off of the Classics IV. ARS' version of \"Spooky\" marks the only instance of a spin-off group covering a song by its parent group and bringing it back to the Top 40. (Both Poco and CSNY covered Buffalo Springfield songs, but did not make the top 40 with their versions, In fact, Buffalo Springfield's only top 40 hit was \"For What It's Worth\")\n\nPosted by Aaron O'Donnell on Sunday, 08/18/2013 @ 18:13pm\n\nThe Atlanta Rythym Section unquestionably deserve to be in the rock & roll hall of fame. Superb musicians, ultimate craftsmen, one of the greatest voices in rock history. When your nickname is \"The Voice\", you might be just that. Barry Bailey, an absolute master, and the spirit and soul, the great Ga music hall of fame member Buddy Buie a songwriting genius. They sold millions of records, toured all over the world, and are still selling out venues 50 years later. The fact is they are Southern rock immortality.\n\nPosted by Walter Parker on Friday, 01/24/2020 @ 21:37pm\n\nARS should absolutely and unequivocally Yes be in the HOF. When you seriously review the whole body of work the ARS did they should have long since been inducted into the HOF. The problem with ARS concerning popularity was never about the quality of their work for the majority of people who listened. It was lack of exposure at a critical time when disco music and pop music over shadowed rock & roll for a time. The timing unfortunately for ARS was bad. I sure hope that the powers that be who make these decisions will stop and take a long Listen to a wide range of ARS, not just I Am So In To You and Imaginary Lover but a wider sample. ARS to this day is drawing new fans even allot of young fans into their music. Put ARS in with the rest of the greats where they belong !!\n\nPosted by Clay on Sunday, 01/24/2021 @ 11:07am"
