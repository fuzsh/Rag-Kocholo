        "text": "Atlanta Rhythm Section guitarist Barry Bailey, photo courtesy Willie Moseley\n\nHe's looking for the remote-control, so he can turn down his TV's blaring volume.\n\nWith some help from his wife Donna, Atlanta Rhythm Section keyboardist Dean Daughtry locates that remote, soon after he's reached via phone at their Huntsville, Ala. home on a recent cold rainy evening.\n\nI've called to ask Daughtry what it's like to hold a 256-page book about his band, in his hands.\n\n\"Makes you feel good,\" Daughtry says humbly. \"Make you feel like a real legend. (Laughs) It's a nice book.\"\n\n\"The Atlanta Rhythm Section: The Authorized History,\" by author Willie G. Moseley, details the arc of a '70s Southern-rock band whose smooth sound, as heard on signature smash \"So Into You,\" falls outside Southern-rock's bluesy anthemic, Allmans/Skynyrd archetype. Yet the picture of what that classic subgenre truly was wouldn't be complete without bands like Atlanta Rhythm Section. \"They didn't like being pigeonholed in the 'Southern rock' genre, but they knew that such a designation went with the territory,\" Moseley says of ARS. In his book, Moseley tells the story of how the band \"succeeded with a new concept of experienced studio musicians forming their own band, writing and recording their own songs and touring to support their work. That had never been done before, anywhere. They crafted their music on their own terms.\"\n\nDaughtry thinks he knows who nicknamed Atlanta Rhythm Section \"The Steely Dan of The South\" - that would be David Hood, bassist with prolific Alabama studio musicians The Swampers, aka Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section.\n\n\"It's quite a compliment,\" Daughtry says. And apropos. ARS's restrained, technically precise and jazz-tinged sound - as heard on hits like \"I'm Not Gonna to Let It Bother Me Tonight,\" \"Spooky,\" \"Imaginary Lover\" and aforementioned \"So Into You\" - is very Dan-like. The similarity was more sonic coincidence than Xeroxing though. Both groups released their debut records in 1972.\n\nCirca-1980 ARS publicity photo, courtesy Willie Moseley\n\nReading Moseley's book brought back fond memories for Daughtry. \"Being in the studio with everybody in the band, playing. That was a great feeling,\" he says. He only wishes more of his former bandmates were still alive to read the tome too. \"I can remember a few years ago I said, 'Well, ain't none of us died.' And now just about all of us have died.\"\n\nWhile singer Ronnie Hammond, bassist Paul Goddard and drummer Robert Nix are deceased, Moseley interviewed all four, surviving classic-era members -Daughtry, singer Rodney Justo, guitarist Barry Bailey and J.R. Cobb - for his book. He also interviewed many of the musicians' relatives, friends, employees, etc., including late producer Buddy Buie's widow Gloria Buie. He talked with musical associates like Allman Brothers keyboardist Chuck Leavell and now-deceased Lynyrd Skynyrd guitarist Ed King, too.\n\nIt took Moseley about a year to complete the biography. During that time, he traveled to Huntsville, Tampa and of course Atlanta suburbs where the band's Doraville recording facility Studio One had been located. He also conducted research at the University of Georgia, Georgia Tech and Georgia State University.\n\nMoseley feels making an \"authorized\" biography adds to the project's legitimacy: \"I wasn't seeking to write a tome that came across like a supermarket tabloid article.\" Moseley says after reading the book, Bailey told him it was \"fair and accurate.\"\n\nA photo of Bailey's weathered 1969 Les Paul Deluxe goldtop adorns the book's cover. Bailey still owns the guitar, nicknamed \"Reb\" by one of the band's former roadies, and that appellation is carved into the guitar. Having written for Vintage Guitar magazine for 30 years, author Moseley is quite familiar with such instruments. \"Deluxes usually do sound a bit brighter,\" Moseley says. \"Another example is the Deluxe that was the primary studio guitar of .38 Special founding lead guitarist Jeff Carlisi [another musician interviewed for the ARS book]. Same brand, model, year and finish as Barry's guitar.\" Having a guitar with a less-beefy sound than typical Les Pauls favored by Southern-rock guitar-gods, like the Allman Brothers' Duane Allman and Dickey Betts or Lynyrd Skynyrd's Gary Rossington, helped Bailey craft a sonic thumbprint. But it was more than that. \"(Bailey) would methodically determine what to play and would play exactly what was needed,\" Moseley says. \"He knew when to step back. The term 'showoff' would never be applied to him.\"\n\nPresent-day ARS guitarist Dave Anderson says for Bailey's classic guitar lines, \"It's all about his touch. It's kind of a cliché to say you can play through any of the great's rigs and it would still sound like you, and they can play through yours and still sound like them. But the older I get the more I realize how true that is.\" Meanwhile, Cobb was more in the mold of \"a true rhythm guitarist,\" Moseley says. That doesn't mean Cobb wasn't creative within that lane though. \"He didn't just strum chords,\" Moseley says, adding, \"J.R. was a very underrated slide player,\" and that together Bailey and Cobb \"knew how to trade off and develop a song both in the studio and onstage.\" Now both former ARS members, the band's quintessential guitar duo still live only about 30 miles away from each other in rural Georgia.\n\nDean Daughtry in 1978, courtesy Willie Moseley\n\nIn Moseley's book, Daughtry describes how musical diversity helped ARS crystalize their own sound. \"Barry was a jazz guy, and J.R. was sort of a country player. Goddard was classical, and I don't know what in the heck I was.\"\n\nDuring our conversation, Daughtry says R&B legend Ray Charles's keyboard playing and songwriting had a big impact on his own work. Country music patriarch Hank Williams was another touchstone. Daughtly also admired The Swamper's dexterous Southern-funk. Moseley says Daughtry, \"had the ability to insert a lot of passion into his playing, which added to the meaningfulness of their songs. In my opinion, this was primarily due to his gospel upbringing and the best example of that influence is 'Jesus-Hearted People' from (1974 album) 'Third Annual Pipe Dream.' It's a sweet, simple tune and Dean's piano flourishes are so on-the-mark they're devastating.\" \"Third Annual Pipe Dream\" also happens to be Daughtry's top ARS album. \"It's a little bit rock, a little bit roll,\" Daughtry says.\n\nJust because ARS wasn't a fulltime blues 'n' boogie combo didn't mean they couldn't do that if desired, as evident on their \"Outside Woman Blues\" cover and a gritty 1975 stomper that actually included the word \"boogie\" in its title, \"Boogie Smoogie.\"\n\nAnd although Atlanta Rhythm Section's music sounded much different than the Allmans or Skynyrd, there was friendship and admiration between the groups. Lynyrd Skynyrd frontman Ronnie Van Zant can be seen wearing an ARS T-shirt onstage in vintage images from 2018 documentary film \"If I Leave Here Tomorrow.\" Daughtry says he and Gregg Allman were \"pretty good friends\" too. \"When he left Cher, he came and stayed with me a couple of weeks. He'd be up drinking at eight o'clock in the morning, Jack Daniels and water. He'd come up there to bring me some and I'd say, 'Gregg I can't drink Jack Daniels and water this early!'\" Asked for a Southern-rock contemporary he admires musically, Daughtry immediately cites Allman.\n\nAtlanta Rhythm Section at 1978's Texxas Jam, courtesy Willie Moseley\n\nBesides charting hits, Atlanta Rhythm Section also tasted marquee success as a live act. Some of the band's biggest shows including stadium gigs like Texxas Jam at Dallas' Cotton Bowl in 1978, along with the likes of Van Halen, Aerosmith, Journey and Heart. At England's Knebworth Festival earlier that summer, ARS shared the bill with artists including Tom Petty, Genesis and Devo.\n\nAtlanta Rhythm Section had formed in the early '70s, comprised of former members of bands Classic IV, who'd originally written and released \"Spooky,\" and The Candymen, who'd backed \"Oh, Pretty Woman\" rock-crooner Roy Orbison on tour. While working with Orbison, The Candymen met future Led Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page, then a Yardbird. It was Page who gave The Candymen their first fuzz-box guitar effects-pedal. Daughtry has fond memories of performing on an Australian TV equivalent of \"The Ed Sullivan Show\" with Page's Yardbirds and when the audio engineers tried to get Page to turn down his amplifier's volume Page responded by turning it up more instead. \"I thought that was cool,\" Daughtry says, with one of his frequent chuckles.\n\nAlthough Orbison wasn't really a drinker, Daughtry says one night The Candymen \"forced\" Orbison to get drunk, plying him with \"Pick Me Up Charlie,\" a concoction involving brandy, 151-proof liquor and a sugar cube lit on fire. Mainly though, Daughtry remembers Orbison as \"a very nice, sweet, gentle person.\" The then-young musicians also learned a lot about songs from their boss, Daughtry says. \"Roy was a great writer.\"\n\nDaughtry co-wrote \"So Into You\" with Buie and Nix at a \"trailer, cabin sort of deal\" near Alabama's Lake Eufaula. \"We always went there to write. All of our hits were written there - I think 'Not Gonna to Let It Bother Me Tonight' was partly written there and partly in the North Georgia mountains.\" Besides playing on their own records, the ARS musicians backed other artists in the studio, including a record by Aerosmith collaborator Richard Supa (co-writer of Aerosmith hits like \"Chip Away the Stone\" and \"Amazing\"), that's a Daughtry personal fave.\n\nThe Wurlitzer electric piano Daughtry played on \"So Into You\" now rests in the Georgia Music Hall of Fame, last time he checked. A big electric \"ARS\" sign the band played in front of onstage during the glory days is displayed at a Hard Rock Café, he says.\n\nDaughtry in 2017, photo courtesy Willie Moseley\n\nDaughtry keeps in contact via text message with Bailey, who has multiple sclerosis. Recently Daughtry passed along info about a stem cell treatment Daughtry is planning to undergo for his own osteoarthritis, which make his \"bones ache,\" hoping it might help Bailey.\n\nIn addition to Daughtry, Justo and Anderson, ARS' current lineup features guitarist Steve Stone (who Anderson credits with helping him learn subtle Bailey techniques), bassist Justin Senker and drummer Rodger Stephan.\n\nDave Anderson in 2017, courtesy Willie Moseley\n\nAnderson joined Atlanta Rhythm Section in 2006. He'd grown up with the band's songs and saw them perform live for the first time, at Huntsville's Von Braun Center, as a middle schooler. Formerly of '90s hard-rock hit-makers Brother Cane, Anderson's top ARS albums include 1979 double-LP live album \"Are You Ready!\" and 1978 studio disc \"Champagne Jam.\" Since he's been in the band he's developed a fondness for 1975 LP \"Red Tape,\" which he calls \"incredible.\"\n\nAnderson says these days, \"When we get compliments saying the band's sounding better than ever I take it with a grain of salt. It's great to hear that we're doing well. It's great to hear we're keeping it alive. But I think who probably said it best was 'Wyzard' (aka bassist Jerry Seay) from (Georgia funk-rockers) Mother's Finest. He was talking to Steve and I backstage at a show recently and he's like, 'Nothing can beat the feel of that original group.' And it's really true. There's such a feel to it.\"\n\nA Montgomery native, Moseley and his wife now reside in rural Elmore County where constellations shine vividly overhead at night. At one point, Moseley's personal guitar collection ballooned up to 97. Now that he's no longer an active musician it's down to a modest 16. A band he'd played with back in the '70s used to cover the ARS song \"Doraville\" in their sets. Adding to his Southern-rock pedigree, Moseley saw the Allmans perform at Alabama's Troy State University in 1971, back when Duane Allman was still alive and guiding that band with transcendent guitar excursions.\n\nAuthor Willie Moseley\n\nTaking a \"sabbatical\" from popular music for \"personal reasons\" during the late-70s, Moseley never saw Atlanta Rhythm Section during their prime. He got back into playing guitars again - and collecting vintage instruments, hence the magazine gig - around 1982. The ARS book grew from two Vintage Guitar articles Moseley wrote. The first of those stories, about Bailey, had been suggested by one of the band's former roadies, Terry Spackman, who Moseley traveled to meet at an Atlanta guitar store after Spackman contacted the magazine's Bismarck, N.D. headquarters.\n\nAlthough he'd owned and listened to some ARS albums in his youth, \" listening to all of their albums\" again, including one rejected by label CBS Records, \"was revelatory.\" For casual listeners just familiar with the hits, for deeper cuts Moseley recommends the live version of \"Another Man's Woman\" (which boasts a hot Goddard bass solo), the lush \"All Night Rain,\" Hammond's plaintive \"I Don't Want to Grow Old Alone\" and the instrument interplay on \"It Just Ain't Your Moon.\" \"There are 'musicians' and there are 'rock stars.' Big difference, \"Moseley says. \"The membership of the Atlanta Rhythm Section has always consisted - and still consists - of musicians.\"\n\nschifferbooks.com\n\nFile photo\n\nMore on music\n\n45 years later, Buckingham Nicks album still casts spell\n\nThe story behind the new Lynyrd Skynyrd documentary\n\nAn Alabama guitar-hero's guitar-heroes: 15 essential tracks\n\nThe story of Brother Cane's hit-packed debut album"
