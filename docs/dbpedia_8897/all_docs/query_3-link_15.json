        "text": "Formed in the rural town of Doraville, Georgia, US, the band first surfaced in 1970, out of the remnants of the groups, the Candymen and the Classics Four. After a local recording studio opened, Bobby Bule, head of the facility, began arranging the session band, inviting Rodney Justo (vocals), Barry Bailey (guitars), Paul Goddard (bass), Dean Daughtry (keyboards) and Robert Nix (drums) to take the position. Having appeared on records for other artists, the session band decided to forge their own career, becoming the Atlanta Rhythm Section.\n\nWith Bule acting as manager and producer, they began to record their own original material, achieving a more radio-friendly sound to Lynyrd Skynyrd and the Allman Brothers. Their first releases, \"Back Up Against The Wall\" (1973), \"Third Annual Pipe Dream\" (1974), \"Dog's Days\" (1975) failed to make much of an impact. However, with the new addition of Ronnie Hammond, replacing Justo, the band found a winning formula, gaining significant airplay on radio stations in the South. On their 1976 album, \"A Rock and Roll Alternative,\" they managed to score a Top Ten hit with the single \"So Into You,\" breaking into the national market.\n\nAtlanta Rhythm Section continued to find commercial success with their next releases, finding a Top Ten album with \"Champagne Jam\" in 1978, featuring two hit singles, \"I'm Not Gonna Let It Bother Me Tonight\" and \"Imaginary Lover.\" The band then embarked on several extensive tours, becoming one of the hardest working bands in the business. However, their commercial success was not set to continue, with their subsequent albums failing to make any hits, instead only decreasing album sales.\n\nThe band decided to split following 1981's \"Quinella,\" reuniting intermittently for live performances and tours. In 1999, a new studio album appeared, \"Eufaula,\" helping to continue the band's legacy to a new legion of fans. Since the releae, the band continued to tour and perform at festivals, finding their music often the topic of cover versions by country artists, such as Travis Tritt, Wynonna Judd and Charlie Daniels."
