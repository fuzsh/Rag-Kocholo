        "text": "Florida native Rodney Justo says it's tough to label the Atlanta Rhythm Section, the supergroup he helped form in 1970.\n\nWith hits including \"So Into You\" and \"Imaginary Lover,\" the Georgia-based band has filled pop and later soft and classic rock airwaves for more than 40 years. And Justo said the best version yet of the group tours now, with a Friday night show set for the Southwest Florida Event Center in Bonita Springs.\n\n“I’ve been in four versions of this band,\" Justo, 73, said in a recent telephone interview from his Tampa home.\n\n\"This is the best version. I say that without dissing the original guys. For some reason, we play with much energy now than we were older.”\n\nMore: Night Ranger tickets on sale for 2019 Bonita show\n\nThe latest version of the ARS features many longtime members, Justo said. They include guitarist and backup vocalist Steve Stone, who joined in the late 1980s; 25-year member and bassist Justin Sanker; and keyboardist Dean Daughtry, who has been with the band since the beginning.\n\nFor Justo, his musical journey has moved from the ARS, leaving for a decade, then returning. The band was the idea of Florida-born and Alabama-raised Buddy Buie, a music studio producer Justo knew from his days with the band of rock ‘n’ roll legend Roy Orbison.\n\nBouie was listening to an album called “Super Session,\" a 1968 record featuring Stephen Stills (Crosby, Stills and Nash) and others.\n\n“Buddy said, 'Why can’t we form a super group?' \" Justo recalled Bouie asking him, telling Justo: \"I want to form the top musicians in the South and formed our own group.”\n\nJusto had enjoyed success in the Tampa area as a youngster for years, with his garage band Rodney & The Mystics. He later performed with Orbison, touring with the musician known for hits including \"Oh, Pretty Woman,\" \"Crying\" and \"Only The Lonely.\"\n\n“I go from sitting around Tampa, Florida, having a band that was one of the top bands around and have the opportunity to go all over the world at 20 years old,” Justo recalled.\n\nMore: Southwest Florida Event Center: Bonita Springs venue survives, thrives with bigger acts\n\nJusto said Orbison was among the nicest people he's ever known, beyond being a longtime rock star known for his distinctive voice, jet-black hair and black suits. Orbison was elected into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 1987, a year before he died of a heart attack at age 52.\n\n\"Roy was just a special guy and how he treated people,\" Justo said. \"If you told him you liked his cufflinks, chances are he took off his cufflinks and he would give them to you. I saw it happen.\n\n\"He was a great, great guy.”\n\nJusto left Orbison's band to join the Atlanta Rhythm Section, which was based in Doraville, Georgia, northeast of Atlanta. He remained for a few years before leaving in 1973, before the band struck music gold with \"So Into You\" in 1977 and \"Imaginary Lover\" a year later.\n\nJusto rejoined the group in 1983.\n\nMore: Review: George Clinton gets funky in Bonita Springs with Parliament-Funkadelic\n\nSome have tried to label Atlanta Rhythm Section as a \"Southern rock\" band, but it really doesn't fit, as Justo said. Some sites refer to the group as \"blue-eyed soul,\" and that isn't accurate either.\n\nThe band blends keyboard and softer guitar solos with clever lyrics, such as the start of \"So Into You\": \"When you walked into the room, there was voodoo in the vibes.\"\n\n“We’re all over the place, man\" Justo said. “Every slot you try to put us in don’t belong. We cover a broad spectrum. I once read that we’re kind of like a rock and roll Steely Dan, which I thought was appropriate.\"\n\nThe Friday concert in Bonita will include the band's range of hits, such as the lesser-known \"Champagne Jam\" and a few others — maybe even the 1979 hit of the ARS' own version of \"Spooky.\"\n\nJusto — now the ARS' lead singer — said he still enjoys performing and looking out to often see younger fans in the audience.\n\n\"One said, ‘Hey, my dad brought me up right. He didn’t play crap music,' ” Justo recalled.\n\nAnother fan once told him what he hears often after shows: \"Thank you very much, I just relived my entire college experience tonight.”\n\nSouthwest Florida fans Friday can expect a fun time for upwards of 90 minutes, he said.\n\n“Every show gets the hits. You’ve gotta do the hits,\" Justo said.\n\n\"We cover everything. I tell people many times, be patient, if you heard us do it, you’re gonna hear it tonight.”\n\nAtlanta Rhythm Section in concert\n\nWhen: 7 p.m. Friday\n\nWhere: Southwest Florida Event Center, 11515 Bonita Beach Road SE, Bonita Springs\n\nCost: From $32"
