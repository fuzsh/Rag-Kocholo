        "text": "About the Artist\n\nLouie Zagoras is a seasoned musician, a true pioneer in the world of rock and blues. With a career spanning several decades, he has left an indelible mark on the music industry. As the founder, lead singer, guitarist, and primary songwriter for the acclaimed band ROLLOVER, Louie has consistently delivered a unique and electrifying musical experience.\n\nLouie’s musical journey took off in the 90s when ROLLOVER’s first record captured the spotlight on Chicago’s 93.1 WXRT FM radio. The breakout single “Shipwreck” catapulted the band to the forefront of the music scene. ROLLOVER’s signature sound is a mesmerizing fusion of Roots Rock and the Blues, captivating audiences with every note.\n\nA testament to Louie’s talent and ROLLOVER’s exceptional sound, they achieved the remarkable feat of becoming the first Chicago rock artists ever signed by the legendary Bill Graham Management in San Francisco. This management firm is renowned for its association with iconic acts such as Santana, Lynyrd Skynyrd, The Neville Brothers, Joe Satriani, and many others.\n\nIn 1995, Louie’s composition “Shipwreck” gained additional recognition when it was featured on A&M Records’ “H.O.R.D.E. CD Sampler,” further solidifying ROLLOVER’s place in the music industry.\n\nRaising the bar, the band embarked on a successful tour of the UK with Joe Satriani, performing to sold-out crowds for a month in 1996. They also had the privilege of playing two more sold-out nights at the famous Fillmore in San Francisco upon their return to the United States.\n\nFor the past 17 years, Louie has collaborated with Roy Marinell, co-writer of hits like “Werewolves of London” and “Excitable Boy” with the late, great Warren Zevon. Roy also co-wrote Kid Rock’s smash hit “All Summer Long.” Beyond his songwriting prowess, Louie wears multiple hats as a producer, recording engineer, and session musician, having produced all of ROLLOVER’s CDs and his own solo CD, “Twenty Fingers.” He has also lent his production skills to many other artists.\n\nLouie’s musical versatility knows no bounds; he is a multi-instrumentalist, proficient in playing drums, sitar, bass, harmonica, piano, Hammond B-3, pedal steel guitar, mandolin, ukulele, percussion, and more.\n\nAfter releasing three nationally distributed CDs and countless tours with ROLLOVER, Louie unveiled his first solo CD titled “Twenty Fingers.” Produced by Louie himself and The Herron Brothers, the album features some of Chicago’s top musicians, including John Carpenter and Jay Davenport on drums, Ed Stevenson and Mark Gleed on keyboards, Tom Gerlach on bass, and the former Black Crowes and Jimmy Page bassist Greg Rzab, who has played with the likes of Eric Clapton and Stevie Ray Vaughan."
