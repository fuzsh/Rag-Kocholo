        "text": "ATLANTA RHYTHM SECTION\n\nFormed from the cream of Atlanta’s studio musicians, the Atlanta Rhythm Section (actually hailing from nearby Doraville, Georgia) came together in 1970 after working on a Roy Orbison recording session.\n\nKeyboardist Dean Daughtry and drummer Robert Nix had been members of Orbison's backing group, the Candymen, and Daughtry and guitarist J.R. Cobb had been members of the Top 40 hitmakers Classics IV (“Spooky,” “Stormy,” “Traces”). Rounding out the original ARS lineup were vocalist Rodney Justo (replaced after the first album by Ronnie Hammond), guitarist Barry Bailey, and bassist Paul Goddard.\n\nThe group recorded two albums for Decca Records in 1972, neither of which made an impact, before signing to Polydor Records in 1974. Their first album for that company, Third Annual Pipe Dream, only reached number 74 in the US. The next two albums fared worse. Finally, in 1977, “So In To You” became the band’s breakthrough single, reaching the US Top 10, and the album from which it came, A Rock And Roll Alternative, went Gold. Their platinum followup album, Champagne Jam, broke into the Top 10 in 1978, together with the blockbuster single “Imaginary Lover” (“I’m Not Gonna Let It Bother Me Tonight” was another major hit from the same album). Nix left after that, replaced on drums by Roy Yeager. During this magical timeframe, ARS performed at the White House for President Jimmy Carter, another notable Georgia product.\n\nAfter an extended break, the band got back together in the mid-‘90s and re-recorded some of their best and best-known songs. The live-in-the-studio sound of Atlanta Rhythm Section ‘96 presents a different, less polished take on some classic tunes and captures the sound of their live performances from that period. Three original band members returned: singer Ronnie Hammond, guitarist Barry Bailey and keyboardist Dean Daughtry. They were joined by Steve Stone on guitar, Justin Senker on bass and Sean Burke on drums. The group also cut a second version of these songs with the same lineup except for new drummer R. J. Vealey.\n\nIt was around this time that ARS was elected to the Georgia Music Hall of Fame. The band was honored at a September 1996 induction ceremony at the Georgia World Congress Center. In the first part of 2001, lead singer Ronnie Hammond made a commitment to perform with the ensemble touring group Voices of Classic Rock and this led to a parting of ways with ARS.\n\nOriginal singer Rodney Justo and original bassist Paul Goddard returned to ARS in 2011 after lengthy absences from the group. Sadly, Goddard passed away April 29, 2014 of cancer in Atlanta. Nonetheless, Atlanta Rhythm Section will carry on, continuing to make concert appearances showcasing their many classic hits and outstanding musical abilities.\n\nThe Strand and Capitol Theatres at the Appell Center for the Performing Arts continue to feature the very best artists and stories from around the region and across the country.

The week ends with a student performance on the historic Capitol Theatre stage!\n\nClick HERE to register your child today for one or more of these amazing and unique workshops they will only experience at the Appell Center!\n\nCommunity Engagement\n\nIn July 2022 the Appell Center began a collaboration with Creative Generation, a group committed to pioneering projects in the arts and cultural, education and social change fields to support those organizations driving systemic change in their communities. This work produced an actionable plan elevating knowledge within our community to help inform a set of tools to create a societal hub for arts and cultural education in York County, PA. Listening sessions with key partners and their constituents were conducted, and information gathered from those sessions has helped inform the next steps of our strategic plan in this area.\n\nAt the completion of the active phase of this collaboration, the following statement was crafted and made public on our website:\n\nThe Appell Center for the Performing Arts seeks to be a cultural hub for the community in York.\n\nWe play a vital role in the local ecosystem, collaborating with educational, civic and other cultural organizations, informal networks, and individual artists to create experiences as outlets for healthy, creative expression.\n\nTogether, we believe in connecting the arts with education, personal wellbeing and family life.\n\nWe seek to build meaningful pathways in arts, cultural and creative learning for the York community through consistent, reliable opportunities which provide\n\nengagement with a diversity of artistic and cultural forms;\n\nmulti-generational creative participation; and\n\ntransformative experiences for creative youth.\n\nWe strive to be a relationship-builder, convener and host.\n\nPARTNER WITH THE APPELL CENTER\n\nThere are many ways to join us in partnership, but here are some common starting points:\n\nAttend a free or low-cost workshop and event.
