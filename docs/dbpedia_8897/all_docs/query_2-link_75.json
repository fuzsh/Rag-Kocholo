        "text": "Formed from the cream of Atlanta's studio musicians, the Atlanta Rhythm Section, actually hailing from nearby Doraville, Georgia, came together in 1970 after working on a Roy Orbison recording session. From that auspicious beginning, the band went on to have a string of mega-hits that include \"So Into You,” \"Imaginary Lover,” “Champagne Jam,” \"Doraville,\" \"I'm Not Gonna Let It Bother Me Tonight,\" \"Do It Or Die\" and \"Spooky.\" Keyboardist Dean Daughtry and drummer Robert Nix had been members of Orbison's backing group, the Candymen, and Daughtry and guitarist J.R. Cobb had been members of the Top 40 hitmakers Classics IV (“Spooky,” “Stormy,” “Traces”). Rounding out the original ARS lineup were vocalist Rodney Justo (replaced later by Ronnie Hammond), guitarist Barry Bailey, and bassist Paul Goddard. In 1977, “So In To You” became the band's breakthrough single, reaching the U.S. Top 10, and the album from which it came, A Rock And Roll Alternative, went gold. Their platinum followup album, \"Champagne Jam\", broke into the Top 10 in 1978, together with the blockbuster single “Imaginary Lover.” “I'm Not Gonna Let It Bother Me Tonight” was another major hit from the same album. Nix left after that, replaced on drums by Roy Yeager. During this magical timeframe, ARS performed at the White House for President Jimmy Carter, another notable Georgia product. In 1996, the band was elected to the Georgia Music Hall of Fame. Original singer Rodney Justo and original bassist Paul Goddard returned to ARS in 2011 after lengthy absences from the group. Sadly, Goddard passed away April 29, 2014 of cancer in Atlanta. Justo, Daughtry and Atlanta Rhythm Section carry on, continuing to make triumphant concert appearances showcasing their many classic hits and outstanding musical abilities."
