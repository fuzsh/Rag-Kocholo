This in-person event will be held at 224 N Center St, Arlington, TX 76011, so come on out and enjoy the show!\n\nThe Atlanta Rhythm Section has been entertaining audiences for over 50 years with their hits like \"So into You\" and \"Imaginary Lover.\" This is a show you won't want to miss!\n\nBe sure to grab your tickets early and come ready to dance the night away with the Atlanta Rhythm Section in Arlington, TX!\n\n50th ANNIVERSARY TOUR From their start as the house band at the famed Studio One, to playing for tens of thousands of\n\nfans at festivals and arenas, Atlanta Rhthym Section earned their place as one of the top acts in country rock. The original members of ARS came together playing as the house musicians at the famed Studio One, recording home to such country rock greats as Lynyrd Skynyrd, Dicky Betts and 38 Special. The Rhythm Section would play on other group’s albums 3-4 days a week and work on their own songs in their off time. They were able to record their own record and that album earned them a 2 record deal with MCA/Decca. The band recorded and released two albums with MCA before moving to Polydor and record number three, “Third Annual Pipedream followed\n\nin 1974. ARS's third album presented a more accessible approach with a punched up but smoother sound and a variety of types of songs that would have both pop and rock appeal. It climbed to number 74 on the U.S. charts and gave the group their first regional hit, \"Doraville\", which reached the Top 40. \"Angel\" was also released as a single and reached number 75 as a regional hit. Champagne Jam, released in January 1978, was the breakthrough album that marked the zenith of music-making, critical support and popular acclaim for ARS. Eight songs were showcased with the smooth pop production the group had been refining for years. The song writing and musicianship maintained the superior standards the band had established through its previous albums. The songs continued the pattern of blending beautiful melodies with shifting tempos and each of the songs clocked in at a moderate three to five minutes. The album proved to be very popular, hitting the Top 10 and quickly going Gold. The title track was released as a single and \"I'm Not Gonna Let it Bother Me Tonight\" made it into the Top 20. But it was \"Imaginary Lover\" that proved to be the band's biggest hit, reaching number seven on the charts. The band rode the wave of success well, producing more albums which netted them more Top 40 singles and cemented their reputation as amazing live performers. With 15 albums of outstanding songwriting and performances, ARS embodies all that the phrase “classic rock” implies."
