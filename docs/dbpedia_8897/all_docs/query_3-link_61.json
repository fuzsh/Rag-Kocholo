Let's connect: https://lnkd.in/eJEVK2TN #PersonalizedService #SRPLending #PrivateLending #TailoredSolutions\n\nMUST WATCH! This is so true! The root cause of the housing affordability crisis are the burdensome zoning laws that restrict supply and add unnecessary regulatory costs onto housing. Residential zoning laws and their processes were originally created as a method for racial segregation but have evolved today as controlled socioeconomic discrimination between the have and have-nots. What’s more shocking, the majority of people who come to oppose my cases are +55 years-old and so are most zoning Boards. It is amazing to see one generation work so hard to prevent another generation from buying homes. Sadly, this is already affecting our children and grandchildren from realizing the American dream of homeownership. If allowed to continue, renting will be normal and homeownership will become the anomaly until first-time homebuyers are into their 40’s. https://lnkd.in/e-yyQQCy"
