        "text": "Formed from the cream of Atlanta’s studio musicians, the Atlanta Rhythm Section (actually hailing from nearby Doraville, Georgia) came together in 1970 after working on a Roy Orbison recording session. Keyboardist Dean Daughtry and drummer Robert Nix had been members of Orbison’s backing group, the Candymen, and Daughtry and guitarist J.R. Cobb had been members of the Top 40 hitmakers Classics IV (“Spooky,” “Stormy,” “Traces”). Rounding out the original ARS lineup were vocalist Rodney Justo (replaced after the first album by Macon’s Ronnie Hammond), guitarist Barry Bailey, and bassist Paul Goddard. The 1977 breakthrough single, “So In To You,” reached the U.S. Top 10, and the album from which it came, A Rock And Roll Alternative, went gold. The platinum followup album, Champagne Jam, included “Imaginary Lover” and “I’m Not Gonna Let It Bother Me Tonight.” Over the decades, there have been many changes in the lineup and the passing of all original members except Justo. Nonetheless, Atlanta Rhythm Section carries on, continuing to make concert appearances showcasing their many classic hits and outstanding musical abilities."
