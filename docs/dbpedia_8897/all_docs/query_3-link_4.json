        "text": "Out now from Schiffer Publishing, the 250-page book, \"The Atlanta Rhythm Section: The Authorized History,\" chronicles the background, formation, rise, decline and enduring perseverance of the band behind familiar songs such as “So Into You,” “Imaginary Lover,” Champagne Jam,” “Doraville,” “Georgia Rhythm” and other late ’70s hits.\n\nWith input from an assortment of past and present members and associates, writer Willie G. Moseley (Vintage Guitar Magazine) leads readers through the founding members’ backgrounds in Southern acts like The Candymen and The Classics IV and their eventual relocation to Atlanta, where they bonded as a band while working as session musicians at Studio One, the Doraville recording facility owned by music entrepreneur Bill Lowery, ARS rhythm guitarist J.R. Cobb and the band’s mentor, songwriter and producer Buddy Buie. With their hitmaking success symbolically culminating with their popular “Dog Day Rock Fest” and “Champagne Jam” late ‘70s hometown music festivals, the book also traces the leaner years that have transpired since, as a changing lineup (currently including founding keyboardist Dean Daughtry and original vocalist Rodney Justo) have kept the group going as a reliable club and festival act."
