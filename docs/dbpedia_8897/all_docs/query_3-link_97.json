        "text": "Kevin\n\nJuly 18th 2024\n\nLet's start with ARS. Their show was good. Their singer and only original member, Rodney Justo did a good job. He had some troubles hitting the high notes, but that is understandable as he is 79 years old. The set included all of their top hits and several songs I was not familiar with. The rest of the band was awesome and sounded like the original gang I saw in the late 70's when I was a teen at my first concert ever. As I understand it, this was Castle Boo's 'maiden voyage' with a show of this significance. The physical location was nice and there wasn't really a bad seat in the house, unless you were behind the sound/lighting mixer who had an awning above them blocking the view. They; however, had several issues... The gate opened late and there was a significant delay getting concert goers into the venue. They only had two people 'wanding' customers and everyone had to show an ID and sign a waiver form of liability. Perhaps the liability issue should be part of the ticket purchase? Also, the policy on bringing lawn chairs into the venue was not clear. Numerous people were not allowed to bring their chairs (elderly and disabled patrons). Their website should clarify what is/is not acceptable. It pissed off several customers ahead of us. The food/concession stands were minimally staffed. It took 45 minutes in line to purchase 2 beers and a bottle of water. They REALLY needed to have more employees on hand to handle the customers desires. It appeared that food/beverage services were contracted out and not the best quality. I understand this was their first outing with a concert of this magnitude. I hope it was a learning experience and they will learn how to handle future concert events. If they have another group I want to see, I am willing to return. Kev\n\nThomasville, NC@\n\nCastle Boo\n\nDAve\n\nAugust 28th 2022\n\n“It was my first ‘Georgia Jam’, an all day indoor event (1 pm—11 with 11 bands). Having received a list of stage times from a prompter I stealthily arrived in time for just the bands I wanted to see: Atlanta Rhythm Section 5:00-5:50, Pat Travers Band 6:05-6:50, Michelle Malone 7:05-7:40, Drivin N Cryin 7:50-8:45, Mother’s Finest 8:55-9:45, Jefferson Starship 10:00-11:00. Groupon was my friend scoring a pair of lower bowl seats half price after which I upgraded myself to row 1 side-stage left! There was to be far too much happening to write a full rundown of everything transpiring on stage hence my abridged rendering centers around Pat Travers. 2022 has been good to me for seeing guitar heroes live: Joe Bonamassa, Neal Schon, Tab Benoit, now Pat Travers, and a Jeff Beck gig coming up in October. So what’s the tie-in with the Canadian rocker to Georgia? Striving to revive the Jam tradition of 70’s and 80’s gone by, organizers sought out Travers who had played the event in the past. PTB ended up penciled in post-organization replacing the Georgia Satellites. The trio took the stage late cutting their set time down from 45 to a mere 30 minutes, the shortest actual stage time of any band the entire day. ‘My name’s Pat Travers, this is my band, and we’re gonna kick your a**, Alright?!’ The kick-off song began, 1977’s ‘Rock ’n’ Roll Susie’, loud and driving. One would swear Pat was playing to a stadium of 50,000 people in lieu of a quarter filled hockey arena, the 68 year old performer exhibiting no lack of energy. He wasted no time swapping out guitars each song, the one Fender never left his person from backstage to backstage. His combo Strat and Marshall stack echoed classic rock tones that are a rarity to hear live now-a-days. He announced the title cut from his newest album ‘Art Of Time Travel’ released last Friday which was just that, a trip back in time. For a minute or two the guitar feed cut out on Pat and David Pastorius on bass (formerly Carl Palmer’s ELP) continued ad lib showing us how skilled he truly is, all the while Alex Petrosky held tight the rhythm on the kit. The final song was ‘Boom Boom, ‘Do ya feel like makin’ some noise? Yeah’, in which Pat showed off some windmill moves reminiscent of Pete Townsend and Pastorius even exhibited some hammer and tap on the four string! The man is so humble, ‘My name is Pat Travers’ he concluded the show, I’m like ‘Yeah you are!’. I overheard one ‘hammer head’ standing in front of me as Pat left the stage saying, ‘My (concert) list is now complete.’ You betcha I’d pay good money to see a full length show any time! Michelle Malone from Atlanta was next up compacting highlights of a 30 year career in a little over half an hour. The local crowd favorite noticed the clock, ‘I wonder how time I really have, is it 7 min? Do you wanna rock?’ Michele broke into a minute of Neil Young’s ‘Hey Hey, My My’. She had the whole Young sound package complete with harmonica. Next was Drivin N Cryin also Atlanta based and on the scene since ’86, one of those bands I’d likely have remained unfamiliar with if I had remained residing up North. ‘Thank you for inviting us to your house party’, the 61 year old Kevin Kinney’ called out. They put on a heck of a full hour long performance opening with their 1991 #15 hit ‘Fly Me Courageous’ dedicated to our military. I didn’t know quite what to expect but when they broke into some fine southern rock dual lead guitars about 3 songs in, I was definitely feeling it. Following was Georgia Hall Of Fame’s Mother’s Finest going on 20 minutes late but completing the full set.The 74’ish’ year old founder, Joyce ‘Baby Bean’ and vocalist ‘Doc’ Murdock’ (also a founding member from 1972) put on a lively show leaving the stage a hard act to follow. At one point original guitarist Moses Mo put on his own show lying down on his back like a dead man while Kennedy motioning the sign of the cross revived him back on foot. He then busted out into a segment of Wilson Pickett’s ‘Land Of 1000 Dances (the Na-na-na-na song) performing a solo with his teeth. Atlanta Rhythm Section, my 3rd time seeing them in a 14 month span began the evening delivering the goods (a 9 song set) with class despite guitarist David Anderson being sidelined with Covid. It was all okay, the band’s guitarist since ’76 Steve Stong made up for it with an extended solo on ‘So Into You’. Founding singer Rodney Justo cheered on the what he called a ‘small but mighty’ crowd, his vocal performance as good as ever. The headliner Jefferson Starship, my 6th favorite all time band (in all it’s variations) rounded off the evening. In my numerous times seeing them perform live it was my first time NOT seeing them front row floor, proof that there is indeed a first time for everything. I was actually excited to finally hear the music over the main system opposed to coming off the stage monitors. So what’s the tie in with the California band and Georgia? We’ll there really isn’t one except that GA native Mickey Thomas of ‘Starship’ (and a member of J.S. ‘79-‘84) was originally slated to play but due to a contracted gig at Sandy Springs GA he was prohibited to perform. Hence the substitution. Based on an Atlanta Rhythm Section post, I half expected Mickey Thomas to join in on stage which would’ve been a landmark event considering drummer Danny Baldwin once upon a time had rearranged his face altering the course for the two individual bands permanently. The band muscled through 11 hits one after another in the one hour set. Of note guru of the band David Freiberg celebrated his 84th birthday Wednesday and took the lead vocals on Runaway, With Your Love, and on Jane (which by the way he also wrote). David goes all the way back to Quicksilver Messenger Service and the latter years of Airplane and is a rock n roll legend in truth. I can not go without mentioning the tremendous job Cathy Richardson did on vocals (as she has the last 14 years, Slick being a tough act to follow), and Jude Gold one of my favorite guitarists to see Live. Their roadie ’Todd’ (an audience favorite) made a typical appearance on stage, Michele & I led the chant: ’Todd, Todd, TODD, TODD!’ ‘Somebody To Love’ was the final song, everyone on their feet. Eleven-Thirty concluded the event, only a half hour over schedule even after all the sets and stage turns, that’s pretty amazing. All in all, in my opinion the event was a success, let’s hope this evening ignited a new fire overall in the Jam’s legacy. I know I’ll be looking forward to 2023’s line-up!” by DAve (Concert #692)\n\nDuluth, GA@\n\nGeorgia Jam"
