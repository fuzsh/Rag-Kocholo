        "text": "Energy flowed Saturday as the Atlanta Rhythm Section took the stage as part of the “Concerts at the Lodge” series in the Holiday Bay Room at the Canyon Lake Lodge. Deaspite a slightly smaller crowd compared to previous shows, the event was highly entertaining and a big success.\n\nDoug Schultz, the Talent Buyer, Producer, and Emcee, took charge of the evening‘s proceedings. This marked the 32nd show since the concert series began, demonstrating Schultz‘s experience and expertise in organizing such events.\n\nThe concert opened with acoustic duo “The Spell.” The husband and wife band of Kenny Marquez, on guitar and vocals, and Tara B, on vocals, took to the stage singing songs that the crowd could sing along to as they warmed up the audience for the “Big Show.”\n\nRecently signed by a record label, The Spell performed its new single, which can be downloaded and is available worldwide.\n\nThe highlight of the night was the performance by The Atlanta Rhythm Section (ARS), a renowned band that has been entertaining audiences for 53 years.\n\nLed by Rodney Justo, a founding member and the lead vocalist, along with five talented musicians, ARS delivered a dynamic 90-minute show.\n\nThe band treated the audience to all of its hit songs, including “So Into You,” “Spooky,” and “Imaginary Lover,” during their 14-song set. They even graced the audience with a one-song encore, leaving the attendees thoroughly satisfied.\n\nRodney took the opportunity to share anecdotes about the history of many of their songs, adding a personal touch to the performance. The band also injected humor into the evening, cracking jokes that had the Canyon Lake audience entertained and laughing throughout the show.\n\nWith a rich history of performing before massive crowds worldwide, including 60,000 fans in England, 80,000 in Texas, and 110,000 in Canada, as well as at the White House, it was a special treat for ARS to perform on a stage in Canyon Lake.\n\nMany Canyon Lakers expressed their delight after the show, proclaiming it to be the best concert they had ever attended.\n\nThe crowd was thoroughly impressed with the band‘s talent. The Atlanta Rhythm Section has a rich history dating back to its formation in Georgia in 1970 and has left a lasting impact on the music scene.\n\nAlongside Rodney, the band consists of Steve Stone on guitar, Lee Shealy on keyboards, Rodger Stephan on drums, Justin Senker on bass, and David Anderson on guitar.\n\nThroughout their career, they have recorded 14 studio albums and two live albums. They have charted six radio airplay smash hits and recorded 10 music videos, solidifying their position as influential musicians.\n\nAfter its captivating performance, members of the band took the time to engage with their fans during a 45-minute after-show Meet & Greet Session. This opportunity allowed attendees to meet the band members personally and express their appreciation for their exceptional music.\n\nLooking ahead, the “Concerts at the Lodge” series has more exciting shows in store for Canyon Lake residents. Deana Carter is set to perform on Aug. 19, and The Fabulous Thunderbirds will take the stage on Nov. 4. Tickets for these upcoming shows can be purchased at Member Services or on the Canyon Lake POA website, www.canyonlakepoa.com/concerts.\n\nThe Canyon Lake POA‘s “Concerts at the Lodge” series continues to deliver memorable experiences for music enthusiasts, showcasing top-tier talent and fostering a vibrant community spirit."
