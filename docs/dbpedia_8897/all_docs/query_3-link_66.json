        "text": "Agua Caliente Casino Palm Springs will host a free outdoor concert with two bands, a DJ, food, a beer garden and family activities.\n\nThe Concert under the Palms, featuring the Atlanta Rhythm Section and Firefall, will take place from 5-9 p.m. on Saturday, April 6, at the corner of East Andreas Road and Calle Encillia near the casino in downtown Palm Springs. Guests will find themselves under a starry night sky and surrounded by a grove of skirted palms as they listen to the bands play from the stage.\n\nAtlanta Rhythm Section, a southern rock band formed in the ’70s, has put out 15 albums and is known for such songs as “So Into You,” “Imaginary Lover” and “I’m Not Going To Let It Bother Me Tonight.”\n\nFirefall is another rock band from the ’70s that formed in Boulder, Colorado. Some of their classic hits include, “You Are The Woman,” “Just Remember I Love You” and “Strange Way.”\n\nThe event is free, but there are some general admission seats available for $10. Tickets for those seats can be purchased by visiting AguaCalienteCasinos.com."
