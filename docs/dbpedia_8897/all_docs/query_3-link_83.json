        "text": "When the Atlanta Rhythm Section makes a stop on its tour at Sellersville Theater on June 24, it will bring more than 40 years of musical experience to the stage. Forty years of ups and downs, highs and lows. Forty years of successes and failures. And keyboardist and founding member Dean Daughtry has pretty much seen it all.\n\nBarely out of high school, he was already performing behind Roy Orbison with the Candymen. Touring throughout the world left its mark on the young keyboardist and he has kept at it ever since. Daughtry talked about his first experience on the road and how it impacted his career during a phone interview earlier in the week.\n\n“It wasn’t only my first real experience on tour, but my first real plane ride. To Sydney, Australia, from Dauphin, Alabama. That was a long plane ride. I love Sydney, though- what a place. Roy [Orbison] was bigger than Elvis down there.\n\n“It was a huge tour. The Yardbirds were on it with us. Jimmy Page. Jeff Beck. I think Beck got tossed off the tour – don’t think they liked his attitude very much. But you learn a lot pretty quick doing something like that. We were young. We really didn’t know you weren’t supposed to work that hard or party that much.”\n\nIt wasn’t exactly a smooth road the members took towards founding the band. Like Daughtry, some of ARS’s members got their first taste of the rock ‘n’ roll lifestyle as members of the Candymen, Orbison’s back-up band and a charting group in its own right.\n\nDaughtry would later go on to join the Classics IV, who had a hit in 1968 with the song “Spooky.” You’ve heard it a million times – ‘Love is kinda crazy with a spooky little girl like you. Spooooo-keeee.’ That may not translate perfectly from print to your ears, but you probably know the song now. And you’re probably shaking your head and saying, ‘Yes, I have heard that a million times.’ Right?”\n\nAlthough the tune was originally written by saxophonist Mike Sharpe as an instrumental piece, it wouldn’t become a huge commercial success until Classics IV guitarist James Cobb and producer Buddy Buie added lyrics to the music. In 1968, “Spooky hit No. 3 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100.\n\nWhen Cobb and Daughtry moved on to ARS they would take the song with them and re-record it. ARS’s cover (if you want to call it a cover) was released in 1979 and has since come to be recognized by many as the definitive version of the song. Chances are, it’s ARS that you’ve heard on the radio when that song was playing.\n\n“That song is pretty interesting,” said Daughtry. “If you look at how many times that song has played throughout the world, it’s been playing on average every minute of every day for over 40 years. Back to back for over 40 years. That’s a pretty amazing thing to me.”\n\nOn top of “Spooky,” ARS found solid commercial success with several other charting singles including “Imaginary Lover” and “So into You.” (You’ve heard those songs a couple of million times as well.)\n\nSo, with all those royalties rolling in, with 15 albums worth of solid, original material, why not just sit back and take it easy? Enjoy the good life.\n\n“I can’t afford to retire,” said Daughtry with a laugh. ‘Spooky,’ for instance: so many people have their hands in that song, those 40 years of that song playing back to back isn’t just our version. It’s been covered dozens of times.”\n\nPlus, Daughtry and his bandmates never really lost that taste for touring, for playing out live for an audience, that they experienced all those years ago.\n\n“We’ve cut back on all the touring as we’ve gotten older, but it’s still something we love doing. This is actually a pretty big run for us. We got something like 12 days in a row on this one. Normally we’ll do four, five, or six shows. We’re going all up the coast on this one though. We really just want to get everyone out there and have a big time.”\n\nIF YOU GO:\n\nAtlanta Rhythm Section\n\nwill be performing\n\nat Sellersville Theater 1894,\n\nMain Street & Temple Avenue,\n\nSellersville, PA 18960,\n\nThursday, June 24, 8 p.m.\n\nTickets: regular, $35;\n\ncabaret, $50.\n\nInfo: 215-257-5808"
