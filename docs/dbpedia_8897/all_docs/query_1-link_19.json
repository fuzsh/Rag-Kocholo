The event is part of the NRCC 2023-2024 Concert Series.\n\nTickets for the show are on sale now. Reserved seating tickets are $40 in advance and available for purchase online only at www.nr.edu/concerts. General seating tickets are $30 in advance and available online or in-person at the NRCC Business Office, 23 Godbey Hall, Dublin (cash and checks only for in-person sales). General seating tickets will be $35, and reserved seating tickets will be $45 when purchased at the door.\n\nThe Atlanta Rhythm Section (ARS) came together in 1970 after working on a Roy Orbison recording session.\n\nKeyboardist Dean Daughtry and drummer Robert Nix had been members of Orbison’s backing group, the Candymen, and Daughtry and guitarist J.R. Cobb had been members of the Top 40 hitmakers Classics IV. Rounding out the original ARS lineup were vocalist Rodney Justo (replaced after the first album by Ronnie Hammond), guitarist Barry Bailey, and bassist Paul Goddard.\n\nIn 1977, “So In To You” became the band’s breakthrough single, reaching the U.S. Top 10, and the album from which it came, A Rock And Roll Alternative, went gold. Their platinum follow-up album, Champagne Jam, broke into the Top 10 in 1978, together with the blockbuster single “Imaginary Lover” (“I’m Not Gonna Let It Bother Me Tonight” was another major hit from the same album). Nix left after that, replaced on drums by Roy Yeager. During this time, ARS also performed at the White House for President Jimmy Carter.\n\nAfter an extended break, the band got back together in the mid-‘90s and re-recorded some of their best and best-known songs. The live-in-the-studio sound of ARS ’96 presents a different, less polished take on some classic tunes and captures the sound of their live performances from that period. Three original band members returned including singer Ronnie Hammond, guitarist Barry Bailey and keyboardist Dean Daughtry. They were joined by Steve Stone on guitar, Justin Senker on bass and Sean Burke on drums. The group also cut a second version of these songs with the same lineup except for new drummer R. J. Vealey. It was around this time that ARS was elected to the Georgia Music Hall of Fame. The band was honored at a September 1996 induction ceremony at the Georgia World Congress Center. In 2001, lead singer Ronnie Hammond made a commitment to perform with the ensemble touring group Voices of Classic Rock, and this led to a parting of ways with ARS.\n\nOriginal singer Rodney Justo and original bassist Paul Goddard returned to ARS in 2011 after lengthy absences from the group. Goddard passed away April 29, 2014 of cancer in Atlanta.\n\nNRCC is a Crooked Road, Virginia’s Heritage Music Trail, affiliated venue. Doors will open for the show at 6:30 p.m. For more information, visit www.nr.edu/concerts. Questions may be directed to Tim Jones at 540-674-3625."
