        "text": "Join us, Wayward Son along with Hippies & Cowboys for a night of rocking southern music at The Troubadour Nashville. Since 1995, this has been a central spot for fans of yesteryear’s Nashville. An intimate venue, the Troubadour steps aside the bombast of touristy Nashville supporting both classic acts as well as the finest up and coming artists.\n\nBeing invited to the American city with perhaps the richest southern music history is always a treat and an honor. We look forward to hanging with a couple great bands and the great music fans that really make Nashville what it is.\n\nClick HERE for The Troubadour’s Facebook page.....\n\nWe’ll be at The Mattie Kelly Arts Center on June 28 in Niceville, Florida. All you Emerald Coast, classic-rock fans join us and Orleans (Yes! THAT Orleans!) for a great evening of 70’s hits at this amazing performance venue on the campus of Northwest Florida State. Go Raiders!\n\nIt may not be a traditional concert setting but this place sounds like FUN! Castle Boo Entertainment Complex near Thomasville, NC includes escape room experiences, one of the south’s biggest and scariest spooky houses and more. A great place for parties, we’re looking forward to our visit and having a southern boogie party of our own, July 13.\n\nWe are lovers of Virginia and we LOVE The Harvester Performance Center. Going to Rocky Mount, VA is a lot like going home to see old friends. We are truly delighted at thought of it and look forward to seeing y’all there, August 3. Speaking of great Virginia venues we look forward to heading back to, on August 2, we will be revisiting the stunning Beacon Theatre in Hopewell.\n\nAugust 10, we visit one of our favorite places way north of the Mason-Dixon, Riviera Theatre in North Tonawanda, New York. The Riviera is a wonderful old theatre and the Buffalo-area live-music fans are some of the best anywhere in America. We look forward to seeing you again. And eating some more amazing Riviera popcorn! Thanks for having us back and thanks y’all for keeping The Riviera going!\n\nWe get to love Virginia and Orleans a little more on August 16 in Orkney Springs at The Shenandoah Valley Music Festival. Join us at the beautiful Pavilion at Shrine Mont for what’s sure to be a great evening of classic 70’s hits. This festival includes many great acts over several weekends at a spectacular location.\n\nClick HERE for Info on All of Our Upcoming Shows This Summer....\n\nWe are excited silly that StarVista LIVE has invited us back aboard the 70’s Rock and Romance Cruise for 2025, sailing March 15-22. They do amazing work on their cruises. Any fan of efficiency and logistics will look on with amazement as their crews effortlessly whip the ship into a floating rock and roll party at sea. This cruise has something for everyone who lived through or just loves 70’s music. The rock part is amply covered by venerable rock legends, Kansas, Rare Earth also Mark Farner and His American Band. The romance part is headed up by Air Supply soft-rocking into their 50th year. Al Stewart and Melissa Manchester will be aboard adding to the cuddle quotient.\n\nOur friends, Pure Prairie League and Queen Nation will be rocking on the Celebrity Summit hopefully at the same time we’re onboard so we can see them. Gotta go hear Hal Bruce the Canadian troubadour! Too many acts to be mentioned here and surly more will be added. Can’t wait! We have all had so much fun on our past StarVista cruises. On the ship, we get to hang out with everyone listening to other bands and partying. Of course, we really enjoy playing our shows and there will be some good eats to be had too!\n\nStarVista further proves their awesomeness by offering the bands a bonus when a fan comes on the cruise to see them. So, please PLEASE mention Atlanta Rhythm Section when you purchase your stateroom. It really helps ALL of us! Of course you could mention one of the other bands if you prefer, we like most of em’.\n\nFor More Info on the 70’s Rock and Romance Cruise Click HERE....."
