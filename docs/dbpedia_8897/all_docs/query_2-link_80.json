        "meta_description": "This book is the authorized chronicle of the Atlanta Rhythm Section, the legendary southern rock band that created such memorable hits as “Champagne Jam,” “So Into You,” “Imaginary Lover,” “Spooky,” and “Doraville.” Already seasoned studio professionals when they formed in 1970, the A.R.S. forged a new direction in southern rock by focusing on the integrity of their music onstage and in the studio. Through platinum and gold albums—A Rock and Roll Alternative, Champagne Jam, and Underdog—as well as international tours, huge outdoor concerts, and personnel changes, the band has staunchly maintained its dedication to its craft over the decades. This story contains recollections from original and current band members, producers, technicians, other musicians, and fans, as well as more than 120 photos of band members from the early days as backup musicians for Roy Orbison and other iconic artists to the present day.
