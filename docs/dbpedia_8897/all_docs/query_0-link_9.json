        "text": "Atlanta Rhythm Section keyboardist Dean Daughtry, who cowrote two of the Southern band’s best known ‘70s rock hits, “So Into You” and “Imaginary Lover,” has died. Daughtry was 76. As of publishing, a cause of death has not been released.\n\nThe band announced Daughtry’s passing via Facebook post. The statement opens, “We’re sad today to announce the passing of our long time, and original member Dean ‘Ox’ Daughtry.” The statement goes on to add, “For 49 years he never missed a gig, until his health forced him to retire a couple of years ago, cutting short his goal of 50 years.” And finally, “Our hearts go out to his wife Donna, and his family. We’re gonna miss you, ol’ buddy.”\n\nA native of South Alabama town Kinston, Daughtry was a longtime Huntsville resident in his later years.\n\nOn Jan. 26, after news of Daughtry’s passing, latter day Atlanta Rhythm Section guitarist Dave Anderson, also of Huntsville, posted on Facebook, “Rest In peace, my dear friend. An honor to play with you and an honor to be friends.”\n\nA former Kinston High School classmate of Daughtry’s, Faye Reeves Leddon. posted. “We knew he was destined for great things. So proud of him and what he accomplished.”\n\nIn 2012, Daughtry described to AL.com the origins of the band’s signature hit. “Me and Robert Nix, our original drummer who passed away a few years ago, were jamming on [B.B. King song] ‘The Thrill Is Gone,’” Daughtry said, “and that kind of led into ‘So Into You.’ They’ve both got those minor-key melodies. \"\n\nDaughtry, along with Atlanta Rhythm Section, was inducted into the Georgia Music Hall of Fame in 1996. The Wurlitzer electric piano Daughtry played on the studio recording of “So Into You” – a song that’s been covered by artists including Peter Frampton - was on display in the Georgia Music Hall of Fame until that museum closed permanently in 2011.\n\nDaughtry’s keyboard playing and songwriting were influenced by R&B legend Ray Charles. Country music patriarch Hank Williams was another personal touchstone. He also admired Muscle Shoals studio collective The Swampers’ dexterous Southern-funk.\n\nIn 2019, Atlanta Rhythm Section biographer Willie Moseley told AL.com Daughtry, “had the ability to insert a lot of passion into his playing, which added to the meaningfulness of their songs. In my opinion, this was primarily due to his gospel upbringing and the best example of that influence is ‘Jesus-Hearted People’ from (1974 album) ‘Third Annual Pipe Dream.’ It’s a sweet, simple tune and Dean’s piano flourishes are so on-the-mark they’re devastating.” “Third Annual Pipe Dream” was also a favorite ARS album of Daughtry’s. In 2019, he told me, “It’s a little bit rock, a little bit roll.”\n\nAfter Atlanta Rhythm Section’s 1972 debut LP failed to connect, Justo parted ways with the band. Ronnie Hammond took over as frontman and this version of the group eventually found stadium-sized success.\n\nAtlanta Rhythm Section were from Georgia and their colleagues included Lynyrd Skynyrd frontman Ronnie Van Zant, who sometimes wore an ARS onstage. “Oh yeah, we played a lot of shows with Skynyrd,” Daughtry recalled in 2020. “I remember one time everybody got on the plane and the first thing the flight attendants did was throw us all bottles of whiskey because Ronnie Van Zant went up there and told them. It was too early in the morning; I didn’t drink it. And then Leon [Wilkeson, Skynyrd bassist] sat in the middle seat next to me and his leg was bleeding. And I said, ‘Leon what happened to your leg?’ And he said, ‘Oh, this woman’s husband shot me.’ I thought, ‘What?’ They were a rough bunch, man.”\n\nDaughtry was also close with Allman Brothers Band singer Gregg Allman. “When he left Cher,” Daughtry said of Allman, who died in 2017, “he came and stayed with me a couple of weeks. He’d be up drinking at eight o’clock in the morning, Jack Daniels and water. He’d come up there to bring me some and I’d say, ‘Gregg I can’t drink Jack Daniels and water this early!’”\n\nSonically, the band had little in common with typical Southern rock. Whereas Skynyrd, the Allmans, ZZ Top and others drew heavily from blues and rock with a pinch of country, ARS echoed R&B and jazz. More than once, Atlanta Rhythm Section’s been described as “Southern Steely Dan,” a reference to the New York smooth-rock group known for hits like “Reelin’ In The Years” and “Rikki Don’t Lose That Number.”\n\nARS formed in 1970 in Atlanta suburb Doraville, where they were studio musicians at local recording facility Studio One, where artists ranging from Journey to 38 Special to a young Ronnie James Dio recorded. Atlanta Rhythm Section’s original lineup featured Daughtry, Nix, singer Rodney Justo, bassist Paul Goddard and guitar tandem Barry Bailey and J.R. Cobb. The lineup was comprised of musicians from previous bands Classic IV, who’d originally written and released the hit “Spooky,” and The Candymen. Daughtry had been a member of both.\n\nIn addition to recording and performing singles like “Ways” and “Georgia Pines, in the ‘60s The Candymen, a group that backed crooner Roy Orbison. Daughtry picked up arrangement tricks, such as composing string parts, while learning the songs of Orbison, known for such early rock ‘n’ roll classics such as “Pretty Woman” and “Only the Lonely.” “He had a very inspirational voice to play for,” Daughtry said of working with Orbison.\n\nIt was on an Australian tour The Candymen picked up their first fuzz-tone guitar pedal, a gift from Jimmy Page, the eventual Led Zeppelin founder who at that time was in The Yardbirds, the British blues-pop combo Orbison was touring with.\n\nBesides charting hits, Atlanta Rhythm Section also tasted marquee success as a live act. Some of the band’s biggest shows including stadium gigs like Texxas Jam at Dallas’ Cotton Bowl in 1978, along with the likes of Van Halen, Aerosmith and Heart. At England’s Knebworth Festival earlier that summer, ARS shared the bill with artists including Tom Petty, Genesis and Devo.\n\nARS even got to perform live at the White House, when fellow Georgian Jimmy Carter was the U.S. president. “The White House was something else,” Daughtry recalled in 2020. “They have some beautiful antiques in there. We had to go through a lot of security, and we played on the South Lawn, which is a really majestic place.”\n\nAt one point during ARS’ ‘70s apex, Daughtry would utilize as many as five different keyboard onstage. Yamaha CP70, Fender Rhodes and Wurlitzer electric pianos, a funky Clavinet and Hammond B3 organ. During our 2020 interview, Daughtry recalled the piano he’d learned to play on as a child. “My mother bought it somewhere out of Montgomery, I don’t know what store. It was some kind of an upright piano that was a whole step below standard tuning. You couldn’t tune it any higher to get it pitch perfect because It could’ve broken the strings trying to tune them up to the right pitch.”\n\nHe started taking piano lessons at age 5, starting with gospel songs like “What A Friend We Have in Jesus.” Daughtry told me, “And then it wasn’t too long until I started playing juke joints. Mostly Jerry Lee Lewis tunes. It was in Opp, Alabama and the place was called The Bungalow and it was a joint. They had fights all the time. I saw this one little skinny guy cut a bigger guy, you could see we he cut him because he was bigger and the other guy was so small, having a fight outside and made an X on his stomach. I learned a lot back in those days in juke joints. We saw somebody get cut about every week.”\n\nThe sturdily built Daughtry’s nickname, The Ox, came about during his early musician years too, he said, “We were playing in a joint in Crestview, Florida in the real early days. I had long hair and nobody else really had long hair and this guitar player from Dothan, Alabama looked at me and said, ‘How can I play guitar with a Lady Ox sitting beside me?’ And that got the Ox thing started.”\n\nDaughtry co-wrote “So Into You” with Nix and Studio One owner, producer and songwriter Buddy Buie at a “trailer, cabin sort of deal” near Alabama’s Lake Eufaula. “We always went there to write,” Daughtry told me in 2019. “All of our hits were written there - I think ‘Not Gonna to Let It Bother Me Tonight’ was partly written there and partly in the North Georgia mountains.”\n\nBesides playing on their own records, the ARS musicians backed other artists in the studio, including a record by Richard Supa (co-writer of Aerosmith hits like “Chip Away the Stone” and “Amazing”), that’s a Daughtry personal fave.\n\nIn addition to “So Into You,” released in 1976, and “Imaginary Lover,” from 1978, Daughtry also cowrote another ARS signature tune, ’78′s “I’m Not Gonna Let It Bother Me Tonight.” The latter song reached number 14 on the Billboard singles chart. “So Into You” and “Imaginary Lover” both hit number seven. “So Into You” is particularly timeless. The satin, seductive track can hold its own with just about anything else on classic rock radio.\n\nOriginal ARS drummer Robert Nix died in 2012. Bassist Paul Goddard in 2014, guitarist J.R. Cobb passed in 2017 and guitarist Barry Bailey in 2022. Ronnie Hammond, who fronted the band from 1972 to 1983 and 1988 to 2001, died in 2011.\n\nAfter Daughtry retired in 2020, he continued to receive a share of Atlanta Rhythm Section’s touring income, an ideal proposed by Justo. “I hadn’t been feeling well,” Daughtry said at the time, “and was having trouble getting around because of my walking and a few other things, so we hashed out a deal for me to retire with.\n\nAsked which contemporary artist he’d most like to hear cover “So Into You,” Daughtry told me, “I think it would be great if Beyoncé and Jay-Z did one. And then I could really retire.”\n\nIn addition to Justo, who returned around 2011, and Anderson, the band’s current lineup includes keyboardist Lee Shealy, guitarist Steve Stone, bassist Justin Senker and drummer Rodger Stephan.\n\nThere have been more than 25 different musicians in and out of ARS over the years. The commonality, according to band biographer Willie Moseley: “There are ‘musicians’ and there are ‘rock stars.’ Big difference. The membership of the Atlanta Rhythm Section has always consisted - and still consists - of musicians.” And Dean Daughtry more than qualified.\n\nMORE ON MUSIC:\n\nAn overlooked Southern-rock band gets their due (again)\n\nThe story behind the Lynyrd Skynyrd documentary\n\nThe story of Brother Cane’s hit-packed debut album\n\n25 underrated or obscure Southern-rock songs to know\n\nThe secrets of the ultimate ‘80s guitar virtuoso"
