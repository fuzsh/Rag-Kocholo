Atlanta Rhythm Section (ARS) is an American southern rock band that formed in Doraville, Georgia, in 1971. The band's original members were Rodney Justo (vocals), Barry Bailey (guitar), Dean Daughtry (keyboards), Robert Nix (drums), J.R. Cobb (guitar), and Paul Goddard (bass).

Their first album, "Atlanta Rhythm Section," was released in 1972 and included the hit single "So Into You," which reached No. 7 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart. The band's sound was characterized by a mix of rock, country, and blues, with smooth vocal harmonies and intricate guitar work.

Over the years, the band underwent several personnel changes, with various members coming and going. Among the most notable replacements were Ronnie Hammond, who replaced Justo as lead vocalist in 1972, and Steve Stone, who replaced Bailey on guitar in 1983.

Throughout the 1970s and early 1980s, Atlanta Rhythm Section enjoyed a string of successful albums and hit singles, including "Champagne Jam," "Imaginary Lover," "Do It or Die," and "Spooky." Their music was a staple on FM radio and helped define the sound of southern rock during the era.

Today, Atlanta Rhythm Section continues to tour and perform, with Daughtry and Cobb as the only remaining original members. Despite their many lineup changes over the years, the band's music remains popular among fans of classic southern rock.
