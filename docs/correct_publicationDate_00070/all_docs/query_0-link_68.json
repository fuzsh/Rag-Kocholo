        "text": "Simply an extraordinary Genius ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️\n\nGiven this was written sometime before 1884, before modern physics revelations, and based only on mathematics and an insightful imagination; I find myself shattered between giving a standing ovation, and watching my ego rolling and crying in agony, after he realized the extent our ignorance.. the drama.. the richness in perception, and depth in describing the variance yielded from different perspectives.. absolutely amazing! ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️\n\nexcellent read\n\nAn excellent read the book captures your attention from beginning to end take moment and escape to this different space\n\nOdd Book\n\nRead it as part of the 1k books to read before you die recommendations. Not much plot. If you are expecting plot to happen... well, you get a few minutes of semi-plot where someone in the 2 dimension realizes there is a 3rd and gets thrown in jail.\n\nGood Book\n\nThe story itself was very interesting and I really enjoyed it. The narrator slightly detracted from the experience, but for the price I would still recommend it.\n\nTrippy but a great brain teaser\n\nIt was confusing at first but the book does a great job demonstrating these weird and abstract ideas.\n\nawful narrater and recording - great story\n\nnarrater has a very deep voice and reads at very uneven speed, constant pauses.\n\nthat plus the old outdated vocabulary make it hard to follow and enjoy the story.\n\ni wished there was a more modern adaptation of this almost 200 year old masterpiece...\n\nA canonical book read tediously\n\nThis book is a must read for people who are wrestling with concepts that are outside of their world... and will likely remain outside of their possible experiences. Physicalist atheists come to mind... but limited field thinking can happen to anyone about anything that has a metaphysical or presently unknown component. The material in the book is enjoyable, but it is by its nature tedious. Unfortunately, it was narrated tediously and acted poorly. It was like Munro didn't bother to read ahead. He frequently ended sentences before they actually ended. That being said, it's a short book, and I enjoyed going through it again. The ideas are worth the pain.\n\n32 and omniscience\n\nThis story is good. Problem is, the narrator doesn't know how to pronounce a lot of the words, and it gets distracting. surprising to say the least for an audible production. for example, omniscience was said as \"omni-science\" and \"3 squared\" was read as 32. Find a different version if you can.\n\nNot what I expected\n\nI can definitely appreciate the uniqueness of this book as well as the attention to detail and effort Edwin Abbott put forth when imagining Flatland. I was more interested in the actual physics of the 2D universe than I was the rest of the story, but overall I'm glad I bought it."
