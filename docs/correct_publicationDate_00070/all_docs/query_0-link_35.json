        "text": "FLATLAND\n\nThe book was just so two-dimensional. I mean it was just flat, the whole thing. Even the cover and the pages were flat. The whole time the book just seemed to be on its own plane of existence. It was like, Wow!--flat, ya know.\n\nRead this book.\n\nOne of the most enjoyable works of mathematical fiction. The book affords the reader the skills needed to experience the fourth-dimension, as well as provides a satirical look at Victorian society.\n\nRecommended for readers with an appreciation for the analytical.\n\nA well-written, interesting and unusual book. I have thoroughly enjoyed reading it. Readers who have an appreciation for logic and math will enjoy this story.\n\nVery Good Book\n\nit is a classic story...very good for children who likes math...and grow up too...and it is written in a very good english"
