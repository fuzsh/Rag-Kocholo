        "meta_description": "Flatland is a brilliant work of satire written by Edwin A. Abbott, a British educator and Shakespearean scholar of the 19th century. Set in a 2-dimensional world inhabited by various polygons, Flatland is a strange mix of philosophy, geometry, and fantasy that punches well above the weight of its modest page count.",
