        "text": "Considering its age, Flatland reads as if it were a mostly modern text with dashes of archaic language and phrasing peppered throughout for stylistic flair. Certainly, that has to be, in part, why it manages to find an audience even today, 135 years on. That in mind, we’ve kept our Heathenistic editing to a minimum. Some words have been updated to reflect their modern usage, which is why “shew” is now “show,” etc. The same can be said for some hyphenated words, a few of which we have removed (the hyphens, we mean), and some word pairings that were once two words but are now one: “for ever” is now “forever,” and so on.\n\nThe true bulk of our work lies in the footnotes and the illustrations, the latter of which we have painstakingly recreated to better coordinate with our pseudo-Swiss design aesthetic.\n\nWe’re wondering if Flatlanders care anything of typography?\n\n“A timeless classic of perennial fascination that seems to have been written for today. Like all great art, it defies the tyrant Time. Start it and you will fall under its spell.” –Banesh Hoffmann\n\n“This is a delirious book.” –The New York Times\n\n“Flatland has remained of interest for over a century precisely because of its ability to engage its readers on so many different planes in so many different dimensions.” –Victorian Studies\n\n“Instructive, entertaining, and stimulating to the imagination.” –The Mathematics Teacher\n\n“The incredulity of ignorance and the unreceptive attitude of the human mind toward new truth are painted to perfection. This story of surfaces and squares and cubes may well serve to shake out of their conceited complacency the whole race of dogmatists, whether they belong to the schools of philosophy, science, or religion.” –The Literary World\n\n“Never been equaled for clarity of thought.” –The Nation\n\n“To the great majority, Dr. Abbott’s sphere penetrating Flatland points the way to the clearest imagery of the fourth dimension to which they are likely to attain.” –William Garnett\n\n“Flatland is not just an amusing and witty exercise in geometry, but is a dissertation that could lead to very profound thought about our Universe and ourselves.” –Isaac Asimov\n\n“This pre-Einstein geometrical fantasy is one of the best things of its kind that has ever been written.” –Saturday Review of Literature\n\n“Abbott pretends to be doing one thing, but is truly doing another. Too late you realize you have been entertained and taught-a-lesson, all in one.” –Ray Bradbury"
