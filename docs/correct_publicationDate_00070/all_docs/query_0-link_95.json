        "text": "Description\n\nFlatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions is an 1884 satirical novella by Edwin A. Abbott. The story is about a two-dimensional world referred to as Flatland which is occupied by geometric figures. Women are simple line-segments, while men are polygons with various numbers of sides. The narrator is a humble square, a member of the social caste of gentlemen and professionals in a society of geometric figures, who guides the readers through some of the implications of life in two dimensions. The Square has a dream about a visit to a one-dimensional world (Lineland) which is inhabited by lustrous points. He attempts to convince the realm's ignorant monarch of a second dimension but finds that it is essentially impossible to make him see outside of his eternally straight line.\n\nThis book has 81 pages in the PDF version, and was originally published in 1884."
