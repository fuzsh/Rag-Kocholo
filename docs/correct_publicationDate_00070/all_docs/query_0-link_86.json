        "text": "Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions (version 2)\n\nEdwin Abbott Abbott (1838 - 1926)\n\nThis is a satirical novel written by Edwin A. Abbott, first published in 1884. Abbott uses a two-dimensional world, with himself as the protagonist, known simply as \"A Square\", to deride the Victorian aristocracy and its hierarchies. But the book has retained its value throughout the years for its unique portrayal of a two-dimensional world, and how a Sphere introduces the Square to the incomprehensible possibility of a third dimension. Once the square fully understands the third dimension, he suggests to the Sphere that even a fourth, fifth, or sixth dimension could exist. But the Sphere sends the square back to his two-dimensional world, where he cannot convince anyone of the existence of a three dimensional world. - Summary by Linda Olsen Fitak\n\nRead by Linda Olsen Fitak and Aaron White.\n\nGenre(s): Humorous Fiction, Satire, Published 1800 -1900\n\nLanguage: English"
