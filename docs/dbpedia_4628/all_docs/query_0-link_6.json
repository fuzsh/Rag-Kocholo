Daisy hails from Mumbai (Bombay), India. Now a Singapore citizen, she followed her husband, Subin Subaiah, to Singapore 12 years ago, when he was posted here for work.

She recalls, \"Back in India, I had been acting and very involved in the Gujarati and Hindi theatre scene. When we came here, we didn't know a single person and I didn't have any projects so I had to start from scratch. It was difficult.\"\n\nSingaporean people of Parsi descent · 2T\n\nIndian women television producers · 30T\n\nWomen television producers · 947T"
