        "text": "Bollywood is synonymous with glamour, glitz, and stars whose charisma lights up the silver screen.\n\nIn this captivating world, name changes are as common as dance numbers and dramatic dialogues.\n\nBut what truly piques our curiosity is the story concealed behind each of these carefully chosen names.\n\nThese names, now etched in the annals of Bollywood history, have become inseparable from the very essence of these celebrities’ identities and their brand.\n\nIn this journey through the tinsel town’s name game, we unveil the intriguing stories of 10 Bollywood luminaries who dared to rebrand themselves.\n\nBrace yourself for a whirlwind of anecdotes as we reveal how these stars transformed not just their names but their destinies in the process.\n\nHere’s the delightful twist – their real names differ from the ones that have taken the cinematic world by storm.\n\nKatrina Kaif\n\nThe British beauty, Katrina Kaif, initially used her mother’s surname, Turquotte.\n\nHowever, before she ventured into the world of Bollywood, she adopted her father’s surname, Kaif, to better connect with her Indian audience.\n\nKatrina made her dazzling debut in the Indian film industry with the 2003 film Boom.\n\nAlthough the film didn’t set the box office on fire, Katrina’s striking presence and screen charisma were unmistakable.\n\nShe quickly rose through the ranks, and her breakthrough came with the 2005 hit film Maine Pyaar Kyun Kiya?\n\nKiara Advani\n\nFormerly known as Aaliya Advani, Kiara changed her name to Kiara for better recognition in the industry, and this move was inspired by none other than Bollywood’s beloved Salman Khan.\n\nKiara Advani marked her debut in the Hindi film industry with the 2014 film Fugly.\n\nWhile the film received mixed reviews, Kiara’s on-screen presence and acting skills were noted by critics and audiences alike.\n\nHowever, it was her role as Preeti in the 2019 blockbuster Kabir Singh that catapulted her to widespread recognition and fame.\n\nShilpa Shetty\n\nBefore her Bollywood debut, Shilpa Shetty was known as Ashwini Shetty.\n\nHowever, following the advice of her astrologer, she changed her name to Shilpa, a move that undoubtedly brought her immense success.\n\nShilpa embarked on her cinematic journey with the 1993 film Baazigar.\n\nIn this suspense thriller, Shilpa portrayed a pivotal role and garnered acclaim for her performance, sharing the screen with Bollywood icons Shah Rukh Khan and Kajol.\n\nHer entry into the industry was marked by her beauty, grace, and acting talent.\n\nAyushmann Khurrana\n\nSurprisingly, Ayushmann Khurrana’s original name was Nishant Khurrana at the time of his birth, but he later opted for a more unique and catchy name in the world of entertainment.\n\nAyushmann made his remarkable debut in the Indian film industry with the 2012 film Vicky Donor.\n\nIn this unconventional comedy-drama, Ayushmann portrayed the role of a sperm donor and won widespread acclaim for his performance, which was both humorous and heart-warming.\n\nHis debut film was a critical and commercial success.\n\nSaif Ali Khan\n\nSaif Ali Khan’s real name is Sajid Ali Khan, a revelation that came to light when his marriage certificate to Kareena Kapoor went viral online.\n\nYet, he is now known and loved as Saif Ali Khan by fans around the world.\n\nSaif Ali Khan began his acting career with the 1992 film Parampara.\n\nAlthough the film itself didn’t create ripples at the box office, Saif’s charm and talent were immediately evident.\n\nIt was his role in Yeh Dillagi the following year that marked a turning point in his career.\n\nAkshay Kumar\n\nRajiv Hari Om Bhatia, known to us all as Akshay Kumar, decided to adopt his screen name after being inspired by Kumar Gaurav’s character, Akshay, in the film Aaj.\n\nAkshay Kumar kicked off his illustrious Bollywood journey with the 1991 film Saugandh.\n\nHowever, it was his role as the daredevil action hero in the 1992 thriller Khiladi that truly catapulted him to stardom and earned him the enduring title.\n\nAkshay Kumar has since become one of the most prolific actors in the Indian film industry, leaving an indelible mark with his entertaining films.\n\nRekha\n\nWith her full name as Bhanurekha Ganeshan, the legendary Rekha chose to simplify her screen name, making it easier for audiences to remember and adore her.\n\nRekha started her illustrious career with the 1966 Telugu film Rangula Ratnam as a child artist.\n\nHer debut in Hindi cinema came with the 1969 film Sawan Bhadon.\n\nHowever, it was her transformation and meteoric rise in films like Namak Haraam (1973) and Muktika Utsav (1982) that defined her Bollywood journey.\n\nPreity Zinta\n\nPreity Zinta, whose original name was Preetam Singh Zinta, felt that her birth name sounded ‘masculine’ and opted for a change that suited her glamorous persona.\n\nPreity made her sparkling debut with the 1998 film Dil Se.\n\nHer captivating performance and charismatic presence opposite Shah Rukh Khan in the film garnered attention and critical acclaim.\n\nPreity quickly became known for her vivacious personality and versatile acting skills, making her a prominent figure in the industry.\n\nTiger Shroff\n\nJai Hemant Shroff is the real name of the action-packed Tiger Shroff.\n\nHis father’s affectionate nickname for him turned into a screen name that roars across the Bollywood landscape.\n\nTiger made a powerful debut with the 2014 film Heropanti.\n\nHis jaw-dropping stunts, remarkable agility, and impeccable dance moves set a new benchmark for action and athleticism in the industry.\n\nTiger’s debut showcased his commitment to fitness and martial arts, distinguishing him as a one-of-a-kind talent.\n\nAmitabh Bachchan\n\nInquilaab Srivastava was the original name of the legendary Amitabh Bachchan.\n\nHowever, it was a famous poet, Sumitranandan Pant, who suggested the name Amitabh, which ultimately changed the fate of this iconic actor.\n\nAmitabh commenced his illustrious career with the 1969 film Saat Hindustani.\n\nHowever, it was his iconic role in Zanjeer (1973) that catapulted him to stardom and established him as the “Angry Young Man” of Indian cinema.\n\nHis commanding screen presence, resonant voice, and versatile acting talent quickly made him one of Bollywood’s most celebrated actors.\n\nThe world of Bollywood is a place where stars are born and names are made.\n\nThese 10 Bollywood celebrities, through their name changes, have not only achieved recognition but have also etched their names into the annals of Indian cinema history.\n\nTheir journey from their original identities to the names we know and love today is a testament to the indomitable spirit of the film industry.\n\nThese stars prove that sometimes, a name can make all the difference on the silver screen, turning ordinary individuals into the extraordinary icons we admire."
