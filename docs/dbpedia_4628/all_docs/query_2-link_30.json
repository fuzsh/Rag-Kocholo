        "text": "Fans of the TV show Iss Pyaar Ko Kya Naam Doon have a reason to celebrate as the iconic show clocks 13 years. Starring Sanaya Irani and Barun Sobti, the show became an instant hit among fans. Sanaya, who portrayed the lead character—Khushi, expressed gratitude to fans in her recent Instagram Stories. Along with an official poster of her show, she wrote, “13 years of soooo much love my heart aches. Thank you everyone…forever grateful.”\n\nIss Pyaar Ko Kya Naam Doon premiered on June 6, 2011, and follows the story of a Delhi-based business tycoon, Arnav Singh Raizada (played by Barun) and a lower middle-class girl from Lucknow, Khushi Kumari Gupta (played by Sanaya). The duo’s on-screen chemistry became a highlight of the show. It also featured Dalljiet Kaur as Anjali Singh Raizada, Deepali Pansare as Payal Kumari Gupta, Abhaas Mehta as Shyam Jha and Sanjay Batra as Shashi Gupta and more.\n\nSanaya Irani started her acting journey in 2006 with a cameo role in the Yash Raj Film Fanaa alongside Aamir Khan and Kajol. In 2007, she made her television debut with SAB TV’s show Left Right Left as Cadet Sameera Shroff. Later, she played a negative role in Radhaa Ki Betiyaan Kuch Kar Dikhayengi.\n\nHowever, she gained widespread recognition with her stunning performance as Gunjan in STAR One’s drama Miley Jab Hum Tum (2008). She then bagged the lead role in Iss Pyaar Ko Kya Naam Doon. Sanaya has also hosted the second season of Zara Nachke Dikha with her husband Mohit Sehgal and participated in Jhalak Dikhhla Jaa 8.\n\nMeanwhile, Barun gained fame in 2011 with his stunning portrayal of Arnav Singh in Iss Pyaar Ko Kya Naam Doon. He made his film debut in 2014 with Adeeb Rais’s comedy film Main Aur Mr. Riight. He has also appeared in films like Tu Hai Mera Sunday, Derma, 22 Yards and more."
