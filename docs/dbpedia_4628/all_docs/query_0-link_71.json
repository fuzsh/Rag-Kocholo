        "text": "Do you experience an identity crisis because people know you by your character’s name?\n\nNot at all. I am a chilled out person. But if people call me by my name I hope they pronounce it right. I get called Baron, sometimes Varun and my surname is often changed to Sobit.\n\nYour biggest achievement?\n\nBagging the lead role in Iss Pyaar Ko Kya Naam Doon. There’s no denying that it has taken my career to new heights. The show turned my life around and anyone would love to play Arnav’s role.\n\nWhat is the best and worst part of your job?\n\nThe best part is when I have to give various looks and don’t have any dialogues to remember. And the worst is to shoot irrespective of weather conditions, and yet manage to make the scene look romantic.\n\nA show you enjoy watching?\n\nI loved the Yashraj shows Powder and Shaadi.com.\n\nWhat topics do you want to see on TV?\n\nI want to see better quality of comedy on TV."
