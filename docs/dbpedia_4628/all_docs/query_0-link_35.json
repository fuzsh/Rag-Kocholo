Mohit had shared how Sanaya always wanted a beach wedding and he had made her dream come true. To this, Sanaya had added, \"I always wanted a beach wedding because I love the sea, the ocean, so I am a beach baby. I always thought of having a small intimate wedding by the beach where I will wear a simple dress and take our vows. But Mohit is Punjabi, so small and intimate was out of the question.\"\n\nadvertisement.\n\nEarlier, in an interview with The Times of India, Sanaya had talked about her hubby's plans, and had revealed, \"When I married Mohit, all that mattered was the person that he is. It’s okay if he is figuring out what to do. I believe that luck and destiny play a big role in success. Mohit is not running away from acting, he is just waiting for the right opportunity. Also, he is currently focussing on an alternate plan. I have always told him that the luxuries, like a house and a car, are not important, but we are. I have seen how people would react to Mohit when he was famous and how they react to him today. But that doesn’t affect me; the fact is that I go back home with him and none of those people do.\" (Don't Miss: Randhir Kapoor Misses 'Food And Booze' With Late Brother, Rishi Kapoor, Recalls Time Spent Together)\n\nadvertisement\n\nadvertisement\n\nWe wish Sanaya's MIL, the happiest birthday!\n\nCover and Images Courtesy: Sanaya Irani, Mohit Sehgal\n\nAWESOME NEWS!
