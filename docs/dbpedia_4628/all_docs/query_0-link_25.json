        "text": "We got some shocking news for you guys! Niti Taylor, who plays the role of Shivani in Ghulaam, has been thrown of the show. Ass per reports, the decision to throw her out of the show was taken overnight. The makers are now looking for a strong actress to play the main lead as Niti exits the show. Names like Sanaya Irani and Ekta Kaul are been considered to play the new leading lady of Ghulaam. Since the show needs to be relaunched, a more popular name is needed for the show to make a mark and that's why Niti's role is been chopped off.\n\nSources reveal the main reasons why the makers decided on replacing Niti. The sources associated with the show say that Niti's addiction to her phone was one of the reasons for the makers to take this decision. The actress was often so busy with her phone that she didn't even bother reading the lines. Not just that, her equation with her co-stars and her constant mood swings led to negative publicity for the show. She had been in the news after news about Param Singh and Vikkas Manaktala avoiding her on the sets started doing rounds. (ALSO READ: Cold war? Niti Taylor, Param Singh and Vikkas Manaktela REFUSE to talk to each other on the sets of Ghulaam)\n\nAnother important reason was her poor Hindi diction. Since Gulaam is a full Hindi oriented show set in Haryana, Niti was unable to bring the correct nuances with her improper Hindi. She used to forget her lines and used to give so many retakes that the whole production unit had to suffer while executing the scenes. Niti was informed day before yesterday and she was shocked to hear news of her ouster. She has even reported for the shoot since the time this news has been conveyed to her. Niti has to shoot her exit scenes where she will be killed in the show.\n\nCurrently the channel is scouting for a big name to play the lead girl opposite Param and Vikas in the show. With the relaunch Ghulaam will be an intense triangular love story of two boys and one girl. Names like Ekta Kaul and Sanaya Irani have been considered to play the part.
