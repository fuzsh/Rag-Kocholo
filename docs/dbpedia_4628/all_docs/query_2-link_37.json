        "text": "Sanaya Irani is one of the most recognised faces on television, thanks to Miley Jab Hum Tum as well as Iss Pyaar Ko Kya Naam Doon, which enjoyed a massive fan following. In spite of all the popularity, Sanaya has not been part of any daily soap for years -- her last full-fledged role was in Rangrasiya (2014). That’s because she feels the content on television has changed a lot and the kind of work does not suit her. “I’ve done TV for over 10 years and it has changed so much in that decade. The kind of content on TV today is not what I want to do. It’s not that I don’t want to do television. I am what I am because of the small screen but now, there’s a buffet of options – web, telly and films. Why should I be stuck to one medium?” she reasons. Here, she speaks about her upcoming film Ghost directed by Vikram Bhatt.\n\nWhat made you take up the role in Ghost?\n\nIt was a mix of things. Firstly, the story is based on a real-life incident and when I heard it, I found it interesting. And then came my role; the character that I’m playing is extremely complex. She’s not like a normal, simple lawyer who has everything sorted in her head. When Vikram was telling me about it, he was like I really think you can do this. When I saw his conviction in me, I felt, I needed to do this.\n\nYou have acted with Vikram in the web series Zindabaad. How different is he as a co-actor and director?\n\nThere was a world of a difference. He completely fooled me. He would keep telling me during Zindabaad that I’m such a good actress. When he offered me the movie, I thought he liked my work. I went on the set thinking everything is going to be fine as Vikram has seen my acting. But that wasn’t the case. After my first take, Vikram was like, ‘What are you doing? What are you thinking?’ For the first 10 days, I wondered why he even cast me for this. I realised the difference between Vikram as a director and an actor is like North and South poles. When he was acting with me, he never told what to do, he only did from the director’s chair.\n\nAre you a fan of horror movies?\n\nOh, I’m a big fan/fattu! I’m the kind who will sit in the theatre and be like, ‘Oh, no! Ho gaya?’ But I also love horror, suspense and thriller because as a viewer, it’s captivating and makes my mind work through the film.\n\nAre you open to doing a full-fledged show on television again?\n\nIf I get my kind of content on television, I will happily do it. But films and the web have spoiled me. The challenge on the small screen starts to die down as the shows go on for two years. After three months into the serial, the character is in your blood, so, I can do it on auto mode. But if I get a limited series, I will happily do it.\n\nThere are many supernatural shows on TV. Are you open to doing one of them?\n\nThat’s not something I would want to try. I have done a supernatural film, but it got over in two months of shooting. I would not like to do horror at least for my next eight projects as I want to experiment.\n\nWhat other kinds of roles would you like to do?\n\nAnything and everything that I have not done in the past. Yes, but if somebody offered me the role that I’ve played before and it fits the story beautifully, I wouldn’t say no."
