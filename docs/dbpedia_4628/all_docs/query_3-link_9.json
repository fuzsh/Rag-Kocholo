        "text": "This article will be concerned with loanwords, that is, words in English that derive from Persian, either directly, or more often, from one or more intermediary languages.\n\nMany words of Persian origin have made their way into the English language through different, often circuitous, routes. Some of them, such as \"paradise\", date to cultural contacts between the Persian people and the ancient Greeks or Romans and through Greek and Latin found their way to English. Persian as the second important language of Islam has influenced many languages in the Muslim world such as Arabic and Turkish, and its words have found their way beyond that region.\n\nIran (Persia) remained largely impenetrable to English-speaking travelers well into the 19th century. Iran was protected from Europe by overland trade routes that passed through territory inhospitable to foreigners, while trade at Iranian ports in the Persian Gulf was in the hands of locals. In contrast, intrepid English traders operated in Mediterranean seaports of the Levant from the 1570s, and some vocabulary describing features of Ottoman culture found their way into the English language. Thus many words in the list below, though originally from Persian, arrived in English through the intermediary of Ottoman Turkish language.\n\nMany Persian words also came into English through Urdu during British colonialism. Persian was the language of the Mughal court before British rule in India even though locals in North India spoke Hindustani.\n\nOther words of Persian origin found their way into European languages—and eventually reached English at second-hand—through the Moorish-Christian cultural interface in the Iberian peninsula during the Middle Ages thus being transmitted through Arabic.\n\nAlgorithm\n\nEtymology: The word algorithm is derived from the Latin translation, Algoritmi de numero Indorum, of the 9th-century Persian mathematician Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi's arithmetic treatise “Al-Khwarizmi Concerning the Hindu Art of Reckoning.”[1][2][3][4] More specifically, it is derived from al-Khwarizmi's nisba which is attained from the name of his home town, Khwarazm. The Arab geographer Yaqut al-Hamawi in his Muʿǧam al-buldan wrote that the name was a Persian compound of khwar (خوار), and razm (رزم), referring to the abundance of cooked fish as a main diet of the peoples of this area. C.E. Bosworth, however, believed the Persian name to be made up of xor (خور 'the sun') and zam (زم 'earth, land'), designating 'the land from which the sun rises'.[5]\n\nAlfalfa\n\nEtymology: Spanish, from Arabic al-faṣfaṣa: al-, the + faṣfaṣa, alfalfa (variant of fiṣfiṣa, ultimately (probably via Coptic p-espesta: p-, masculine sing. definite article + espesta, alfalfa) from Aramaic espestā from Middle Persian aspast, horse fodder.[6]\n\nAmazons\n\nvia Old French (13c.) or Latin, from Greek Amazon (mostly in plural Amazones) \"one of a race of female warriors in Scythia,\" possibly from an Iranian compound *ha-maz-an- \"(one) fighting together\".[7] Or a borrowing from old Persian for a warring Scythian tribe (\"ha-u-ma-va-r-(z)ga: 'lit. 'performing the Haoma plant ritual' \"),\n\nAssassin\n\nThe original word in Persian: اساسیان Asaasiaan which is in two parts. 'Asaas' [Arabic for Foundation/God] and 'iaan' [Persian adj. 'committed/plural'] is the common name used to refer to Nizari Ismailis under the leadership of Hassan-i Sabbah who conducted a series of political assassinations. It is a common misconception that they were called Hashashim, which is supposed to imply that they were drugged on Hashish to do their martyrdom, because the opposition of the Ismaili groups wanted to tarnish their name.\n\nAzure\n\nMiddle English (denoting a blue dye): from Old French asur, azur, from medieval Latin azzurum, azolum, from Arabic al 'the' + lāzaward (from Persian lāžward 'lapis lazuli').:\n\nAubergine\n\nEtymology: Catalan albergínia, from Arabic al-bādhinjān, from Persian Bādenjān بادنجان.\n\nAzerbaijan\n\nAccording to a modern etymology, the term Azerbaijan derives from the name of Atropates, a Persian satrap under the Achaemenid Empire, who was later reinstated as the satrap of Media under Alexander of Macedonia.
