She then moved to the base along with her son Jaydon.\n\nAmid the speculations, her team has said she’s in the country due to a family medical emergency.\n\nThe statement read: “Dalljiet and Jaydon are in India currently for Dalljiet’s Dad’s surgery to be followed by her Maa’s surgery, which requires her to be beside them.”\n\nThe statement further read that Dalljiet now would not like to comment about the ongoing speculations and requests for privacy.\n\n“In addition to this I would only like to add that Dalljiet now would not like to make any further comments on anything, because kids are in the picture. Please respect her kid’s privacy and consider this the only statement she would like to give out,” it read. It was in 2023, when Dalljiet and Nikhil got married.\n\nDalljiet is known for her works in ‘Kulvaddhu’, ‘Iss Pyaar Ko Kya Naam Doon’ and ‘Kaala Teeka’. She was previously married to TV actor Shalin Bhanot."
