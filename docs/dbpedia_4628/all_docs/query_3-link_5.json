        "text": "The origin or origins of a person refers to the country from where the person, his parents or his ancestors come.\n\nThe origin of a person can be determined from a first name, a family name or a full name for more precision. The countries of origin returned are based on the country codes defined in the ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 standard. These codes are published by the International Organization for Standardization, and represent dependent countries and territories.\n\nFor example, the name Keith Haring has as its region of origin Europe and more specifically Northern Europe. United Kingdom (UK) is the most probable country of origin with a probability of 74.3% and Ireland (IE) is the alternative country of origin.\n\nAn ethnicity is a group of people who identify with each other on the basis of common attributes distinguishing them from other groups: a common set of traditions, origin, culture, ancestry, language, history, religion or social treatment.\n\nA diaspora refers to a population living outside the area in which they have lived for a long time or in which their ancestors have lived. The origins of this population differ from the country in which they live.\n\nFor example, an individual named Keith Haring and living in the United States, will have the most likely ethnicity German with a probability of 50.74 % and Dutch as an alternate ethnicity.\n\nUS race ethnicity is a categorization based on the US Census Taxonomy.\n\nThe U.S. Census Bureau must adhere to the 1997 Office of Management and Budget (OMB) standards on race and ethnicity which guide the Census Bureau in classifying written responses to the race question.\n\nThis categorization includes a taxonomy in 6 classes: White, Black or African American, American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, Hispanic or Latino and Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander.\n\nFor example, for the name Keith Haring in the United States, the most likely given US race ethnicity is White, non latino, with a probability of 65.68%. The second most likely given race ethnicity is Black, non latino.\n\nThe country of residence is the country where a person has lived for the majority of the last 12 months. Tourists are not defined as residents of a country. Country of residence differs from nationality, although in some cases it may be correlated.\n\nFor example, the name Keith Haring returns Americas and more specifically Northern America as the region of residence. The United States is the most probable country of residence with a probability of 55.16% and New Zealand is the alternative country of residence."
