We hope on finding them one day and living the fairytale life with them. While there are times when you may fight with each other on a little thing, but a huge part in your heart is reserved for them. And television couple, Sanaya Irani and Mohit Sehgal are a perfect exemplar of it. They have been serving #couplegoals ever since they tied the knot on January 25, 2016.

They became audience's favourite jodi and everyone had celebrated with them when they had gotten married in a beach wedding. Yes, we still remember her gorgeous lehenga for the day.\n\nadvertisement\n\nadvertisement\n\nRecently, in an interview with Pinkvilla, Mohit and Sanaya opened up on their beach wedding and how they had planned it all. Mohit shared how Sanaya always wanted a beach wedding and he just made her dream come true. To this, Sanaya added, \"I always wanted a beach wedding because I love the sea, the ocean, so I am a beach baby. I always thought of having a small intimate wedding by the beach where I will wear a simple dress and take our vows. But Mohit is Punjabi, so small and intimate was out of the question.\"\n\nadvertisement\n\nSanaya further shared, \"Honestly, first, we thought of doing a court marriage because it is a lot of stress to even plan the marriage. For the longest time, we did not get married because of this, and then our parents asked us why are we not getting married. So, then we decided, let's just get married. So, the plan was to keep it simple and have a court marriage and save money and time but the Mohit was very sweet about it and wanted to fulfil my dream.\"\n\nadvertisement\n\nSanaya also revealed her families reaction on their love and said, \"They were very cool with it, they are not narrow-minded. It was not a big deal for them. They were very happy\"\n\nadvertisement.\n\nSanaya and Mohit had kickstarted 2020 with a liplock picture in the midst of snow from their vacation in San Francisco that has made all their fans' heart flutter. Sanaya had captioned the picture as \"Kissing 2019 goodbye and bringing in 2020 with loads of love. Happy New year everyone have a great year ahead.\" On the other hand, Mohit had written, \"Bringing in 2020 with love and happiness.\"\n\nadvertisement\n\nadvertisement\n\nComing back to their love life, in an interview with The Times of India, Sanaya had shared how she fell in love with Mohit. She had revealed, \"When I married Mohit, all that mattered was the person that he is. It’s okay if he is figuring out what to do. I believe that luck and destiny play a big role in success. Mohit is not running away from acting, he is just waiting for the right opportunity. Also, he is currently focussing on an alternate plan. I have always told him that the luxuries, like a house and a car, are not important, but we are. I have seen how people would react to Mohit when he was famous and how they react to him today. But that doesn’t affect me; the fact is that I go back home with him and none of those people do.\" (Don't Miss: Shahid Kapoor Treats Wife Mira Kapoor With 'Best Pasta' As He Cooks For The First Time In Five Years)\n\nWell, Mohit and Sanaya never fail to give couple goals!\n\nCover and Images Courtesy: Sanaya Irani, Mohit Sehgal\n\nAWESOME NEWS!
