This is the beauty's new geeky avatar in the show and she goes by the name Mahira Akhtar. Lol, check out those braces and the piggytails. I've gotta say, I find her very cute and have started liking her more than Sanam!\n\nHappy birthday rockstar!\n\nKumkum Bhagya's Shabbir Ahluwalia, who plays a rockstar Abhi in the series, recently celebrated his birthday and got this cute photo dedication from his co-star Sristi Jha aka Pragya! The two's chemistry on-screen is quite happening and looks like the two share a comfortable rapport off it as well. Just look at them posing like gangstas in this one!\n\nBaby ka hai birthday bash\n\nKaran Patel's better half Ankita Bhargava's birthday was an epic one as all her besies were present for the lay of the hour.
