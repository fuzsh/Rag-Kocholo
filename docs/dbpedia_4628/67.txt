Initially, it was difficult for her to leave India and settle in a place that she hadn't heard of. She recalls, "Back in India, I had been acting and very involved in the Gujarati and Hindi theatre scene. When we came here, we didn't know a single person and I didn't have any projects so I had to start from scratch. It was difficult."
