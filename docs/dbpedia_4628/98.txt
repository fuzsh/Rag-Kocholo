Kashmira is often mistaken to be Sanaya’s sister because of their common surname. In fact, rumours even suggested that Kashmira was staying in the US for a few months and Sanaya took a break to visit her there.

In an interview, Kashmira laughed off these rumours and said, “I have read many such bizarre stories about Sanaya and me but the truth is that we have met only once at a mutual friend’s party. Other than that, I don’t claim to know her. We are not related to each other just because we share a surname. My real sister has been asking me to clear these rumours and tell the world that I have just one sibling, which is her!”

Well, fans often do such mistakes!
