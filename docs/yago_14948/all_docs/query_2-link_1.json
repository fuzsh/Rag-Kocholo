        "text": "After taking a few days since the recent announcement that we are sunsetting BlueJeans by Verizon products and services, it is a moment to reflect, appreciate, and look ahead. I want to thank all my amazing friends, colleagues, partners and customers who have reached out to check in on me and the team over the last 48hours, it means a lot ❤️ From day one, the heart and soul behind BlueJeans have been its incredible team. I am immensely proud of each and every member for their relentless dedication, unwavering spirit, and the positive attitude they've shown, even amidst challenges. I thank the Verizon Business leadership for trusting me with this opportunity to build and develop our international business in EMEA and APAC, which I am immensely proud of what we achieved, against all odds. Someone once told me build you career around 3 fundamentals, earning, learning and having fun. I can tell you I have learned a tremendous amount and had the best time on this journey. Our commitment to our customers remains resolute. Throughout this transition, our priority is to ensure minimal disruption and to provide the exemplary service that you’ve come to expect from us. Thank you for the trust you've placed in BlueJeans and our team over the years. This outcome is not a reflection of the team, who are some of the best I have had the honour to work with and if you are looking for incredibly talented individuals please reach out on this post and I will connect you with amazing talent. Thank you for all your support #foreverBluejeans. #bluecrew #vteam #iamvz"
