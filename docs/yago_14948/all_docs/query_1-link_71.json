        "text": "New Program Will Expand State Employment Opportunities for Emerging Professionals Specializing in Public Policy\n\nTRENTON – Building upon efforts to expand opportunity and lessen barriers to public employment, Governor Phil Murphy today announced the re-launch of the Governor’s Fellows Program, a State employment program designed to attract and retain a diverse pool of qualified individuals interested in pursuing a career in public service. The newly revised program will offer an opportunity for recent graduates and emerging professionals to be hired into key policy and programmatic areas that support the goals of the State. The launch of the new program will play a critical role in broadening the unique perspectives and diversity represented in New Jersey’s state workforce.\n\n“The Governor’s Fellows Program will expand our great workforce and offer New Jersey’s future leaders an opportunity to begin their careers in public service,” said Governor Murphy. “This comprehensive, well-rounded, and innovative program will allow passionate people to make a difference in state government, specifically in roles that are tailored to their interests, skills, and experience. As we continue to build and support the workforce of the Next New Jersey, it is my honor to announce this program which will open the rewarding and enriching opportunity of public service to emerging professionals.”\n\nThis new initiative will help to build capacity in executive branch departments by attracting recent graduates who will specialize in policy areas such as transportation equity, universal pre-K, and mental health and addiction. Governor’s Fellows will have a commitment of one-year of employment within their specific office and will serve under the supervision of dedicated career staff with invaluable institutional knowledge. At the end of the fellowship, these employees will be considered for long-term employment by the host department. The Governor’s Office will provide mentorship and networking opportunities to Fellows, who will begin their state government career with support from the Governor’s Office and as well as the State Civil Service Commission.\n\n“The New Jersey Civil Service Commission remains committed to attracting and retaining diverse talent in our civil service workforce,” said Allison Chris Myers, New Jersey Civil Service Commission Acting Chair & Chief Executive Officer. “The New Jersey Governor’s Fellows Program is an excellent way for individuals with a combination of education and experience, young professionals, or recent college graduates to enter state positions. This program is a great opportunity for people to learn the ins and outs of New Jersey state government and explore all that a career in public service has to offer. I encourage all who are eligible and interested in this program to apply, as they will gain a wealth of invaluable experience and knowledge in a field of their interest, as well as direct access to mentorship and networking opportunities from the Governor’s Office.”\n\nEligibility for the Governor’s Fellows Program will be based on several qualifications, including effective communication and teamwork skills, established excellence in professional or academic achievement, proven leadership ability, and a demonstrated commitment to public policy.\n\nApplications open starting April 24, 2023 and the deadline for Fellow applications is May, 12, 2023, with interviews being held throughout the summer. The expected start date will be September 2023.\n\nClick here for a list of the departments hiring Governor’s Fellows and for more information on how to apply."
