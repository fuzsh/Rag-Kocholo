        "text": "Ending: At first, Blind Girl does not recognise her beloved. It takes a long hard look and crucially the tactile sensation of Tramp's hand as she seizes it to impart a coin.\n\n\"You can see?\" says Tramp, pointing to her eyes.\n\nShe nods, teary.\n\n\"Yes, I can see now.\"\n\nShe presses Tramp's hand to her heart, the 1930s' equivalent of a pre-credits kiss or embrace. Sight elucidates the situation (why Tramp lied, the full extent of his generosity), but not without and not prior to touch. Tramp's visible appearance as a man of meagre means may have stood only to perpetuate the deception as much as Blind Girl's blindness had she not taken his hand. But it is sight, as synonymous with understanding, that claims all the credit.\n\nBank robbers Cliff Banks and Sam Baker go their separate ways while being chased by the law. Now fleeing alone, Cliff begins to reflect, via flashback, on the various events and unsavory people in his life that lead to his life of crime. Cliff ends up in the idyllic rural town of Paradise Valley. He discovers the local people are very trusting and decides the town would be the perfect place to pull a scam. He meets a farmer named Clem Broderick and his strange blind daughter Jane, who seems to have supernatural powers; she can use a dowsing rod to find water, has ESP, and can control the forces of nature. Despite all her powers, she is unable to read Cliff's mind and discover his plan to steal the Broderick farm out from under them. However, after Jane discovers what the stranger is up to, she invokes a vision in which Cliff is terrorized by the forces of nature and drowns in the river. Cliff, now shaken, vows to reform, and in the process save Clem's life when he is attacked by a bear.\n\nA hyper observant heronine and as such an early example of the superior perceiver. Also a blind woman/witness in peril. Also features a romance plot.\n\nApprox. 23:10 mark:\n\n\"How did you know it was a man?\"\n\n\"Why, I can't explain it really. I always know whether it's a man or woman near me.\"\n\nApprox. 44:46 mark:\n\n\"You see, the blind can't be deceived by any false appearances because, well, we don't see them. Oh, the pretty face, the good hands [...] the clothes, and the honest stare. All of those are often lies, but they can't be told to us.\"\n\nShe then goes on to list the auditory clues and vocal qualities that are are more reliably revealing than appearances. The result is a formulation of the visible as inherently deceptive."
