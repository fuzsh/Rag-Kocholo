        "text": "To all my fellow Zoomies and treasured partners out there. I just wanted to say a huge THANK YOU for all of your support throughout the year. 🙏 2023 has been a real breakthrough year for channel at Zoom and it takes an army to make it happen along with a huge amount of hard work and dedication. 👷♂️ Thank you to all of our partners, both new and old, for investing in ZOOM and believing in the organisation and incredible technology platform that Eric S. Yuan (he / him / his) and his leadership team have built. 🔨 ZOOM is without doubt, the most incredible technology company I have ever worked for and the mutual opportunity ahead of us all is, frankly, enormous. 🛣 Truly a one stop shop for all business critical communications and collaboration, powered by AI, on a single platform, to enable the hybrid workforce and workplace of today. THE future proof platform that our partners can leverage to deliver meaningful business outcomes and true digital transformation in their customers. 🤖 Thanks again and see you all in 2024!!! It's gonna be a HUGE one!!! Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year all 🎅 🎄 #zoom #zoomone #zoomspaces #zoomAIcompanion #zoomcontactcenter #zoomvirtualagent #zoomphone #zoomevents #workvivo #zoomwebinars #zoomeverything #merrychristmas #happynewyear #channellove #channelpartners #channelrules #partnerships #partners #ZCX #customerexperience #employeeexperience #totalexperience\n\nHot take: As an Apollo.io employee, I have some REALLY strong opinions... on ZoomInfo and how they are handling social media these days. 👏🏻 Honestly, I applaud Henry Schuck and the way he approaches unhappy customers, gets curious, and pursues resolution with them. The feedback I have gotten from folks I know who have spoken with him is that he's motivated to improve their customer experience. *Hat tip to you, good sir. 💁🏻♀️ They are collaborating with some SMART people Will Aitken 💙 doing content with them, bringing on Justin Levy a few months back? - fricken brilliant. 🔥 They are genuinely investing in the brand, the creator economy + further our collective category. As a creator myself, I'm here for it! ---------------------- When I was an SDR BombBomb I would occasionally tell a prospect they should check out our #1 competitor Vidyard because in some cases, they were just a better fit. At the core of sales, we are problem solvers. We are helpers. It should be about providing the best solution to our prospects, even when sometimes that solution isn't ours. ---------------------- Truth is- I am a deeply competitive person. But I see ZoomInfo as a worthy adversary, not a mortal enemy. It's a big small world. Everyone is out here doing their best and trying to provide value. There are differentiators and competitive advantages to EACH company in our category. ---------------------- People are out here asking whether Apollo.io is The Coca-Cola Company or PepsiCo... ... tbh I just want our vending machines next to each other because when that happens, fewer people go thirsty + statistically both brands make more $$$. ✌🏼 #competitiveadvantage #competition #zoominfovapollo\n\nConnecting in person can truly make a difference, even in just 30 minutes. Last week, I traveled to London 🇬🇧, to do exactly that: 1️⃣ We organized our first RevOps meetup with over 60 attendees, a huge success and we'll be back for sure 🙌. 2️⃣ I also had the chance to spend valuable time with our UK-based customers from SaaS and financial services sectors. At Weflow, a fully remote company, we handle everything virtually, from sales to support. However, I've found that face-to-face meetings can add a unique dimension to our interactions, leading to long-lasting benefits: 🤝 Building trust and rapport through personal interactions. 💻 Enhancing communication clarity without technological barriers (\"Can you hear me?\", \"How do I share my screen?\", \"Can you see my screen?\", *doorbell ringing*, ...). 💡 Gaining fresh insights and opportunities from spontaneous discussions during coffee or lunch meetups. While meeting every customer in person might be challenging, we believe that investing the time, money, and effort whenever possible will yield significant long-term rewards. #RevOps #CustomerSuccess #London\n\n🌟 Heading to Las Vegas for Atlassian Team '24! 🌟 I'm super excited to share that I will be joining the Atlassian Team '24 conference in Las Vegas from April 30 to May 2, 2024, along with my colleagues from Swarmit, infometis and DEMICON - AWS, Atlassian and monday.com Solution Partner. This isn't just another tech event for us; it's a unique opportunity to immerse ourselves in the world of teamwork and innovation. We're looking forward to exploring new ideas, learning about the latest developments in teamwork technology, and especially to the personal connections that only such an event can offer. What I'm most excited about is the chance to meet with partners (like Xray by Xblend), industry peers, and like-minded professionals. There's something special about connecting face-to-face, sharing experiences, and brainstorming on future collaborations. If you're attending, let's catch up and talk about how we can shape the future of work together! While we're all about enhancing our skills and learning about the latest in tech, for me, the real magic of these events lies in the personal stories, the shared ambitions, and the new friendships that emerge. Can't make it to Vegas? I’ll be sharing key insights and experiences right here, so stay tuned! Looking forward to an amazing few days of learning, networking, and, most importantly, connecting with people who are as passionate about collaboration and innovation as I am. If you're around, drop a message – let's meet up and explore possibilities together! #AtlassianTeam24 #Teamwork #Innovation #Networking #FutureOfWork #Collaboration\n\n🚀 Exciting Announcement: Our Partnership with Zoom ! 🌐 I am thrilled to share a game-changing partnership that will revolutionize the way businesses connect and collaborate.
