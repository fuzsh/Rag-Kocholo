Roland Holroyd Remembered 53 Years of Dedication, Teaching Excellence, and Tradition » La Salle, Spring 1985 HOLROYD— continued igh Requiem Mass was said on Janu- ary 9 at St. Clement's Episcopal Church. Philadelphia, for Dr. Roland Holroyd, founder of La Salle Univer- sity's Biology Department and a liv- ing legend to thousands of students during his 53-year teaching career, who died on Jan. 5, at the Clara Burke Nursing Home, Plymouth Meeting, Pa. He was 88. Known as \"The Good Doctor,\" Holroyd once esti- mated that he taught more than 5,000 La Salle stu- dents during his tenure at the Christian Brothers uni- versity which lasted from 1920 when he was a gradu- ate student at the University of Pennsylvania until 1973 when he retired and became the first La Salle professor to be given the title \"emeritus.\" When Dr. Holroyd began his teaching career — splitting his time between La Salle and Penn, La Salle's campus was located at 1240 N. Broad St. and there were fewer students in the entire college than there were in some of his later classes. He joined La Salle's full time staff when its campus was moved to its present 20th St. and Olney Ave. site in 1930. Dr. Holroyd's students include hundreds of physicians currently practicing across the nation as well as many sons and daughters of former students. A native of Manchester, England, Dr. Holroyd came to the U.S. at the age of eight and graduated from Central High School before receiving his bachelor's, master's and Ph.D. degrees from the University of Pennsylvania. Dr. Holroyd always conducted his classes in an academic robe in the Oxford-Cambridge tradition. He The academic gown was part of the Holroyd legend. \"It is not a studied eccentricity,\" he once said. \"It works.\" He starled wearing it when he was leaching at La Salle's Broad and Stiles s( campus. decided on such attire soon after arriving at La Salle when he felt that students were giving him less re- spect than they were giving to other teachers. \"Almost all La Salle students at the time had been taught all their lives by priests, nuns, or Christian Brothers,\" he once explained. \"They associated a black robe with authority and they regarded a man in street clothes with tolerance rather than respect.\" The beloved professor frequently expressed dis- dain for many modern teaching methods. Although his classes tripled in size over the years, he always gave subjective (essay) type examinations and often warned students, \"Don't mistake the sideshow (ex- tracurricular activities) for the main event (studies).\" \"The art of teaching consists of making a student The President Reminisces : 88 Remarkable Years . . . Esmerelda . . . Thrillinj Any recollections of Dr. Holroyd must be jotted in full awareness of the competition, everyone who ever knew him. Many of the memories are one-liners that need enormous es- tablishment of context for their full effect: \"Whenever rain prevented their long walks, the Brothers revised the curriculum!\" (re- ferring to old, old customs in the community and simpler times generally). \"I knew that if I stayed in one place long enough, all you would come around, (the change to English in the Catholic Mass). \"We are not in the business of dispensing wisdom by the cubic yard.\" (in direct con- tradiction to his insistence on rigorous adherence to clock hours and calendar days). Like many other old-timers such as Brother Clementian, Dr. Holryd had evolved what could now be called genteel assertiveness. In the mid- sixties, I had some classes in \"his\" first floor lecture hall, for a double period. Since the Doc- tor followed me, he re-asserted eminent domain by rolling his charts in during the intermission between my classes. The charts were of course legendary in their own right, but his style of getting my \"permission\" and of communicating bis true feelings about such an invasion by the English department were far more memorable. want to learn,\" Dr. Holroyd once said. \"The familiar aphorism that you can lead a horse to water but you can't make him drink is untrue. You can make him drink if you salt him first. So, the student's interest must be salted. It takes time, patience, a love of the subject and of the student, too. But you must re- member not to go down to their level. You must bring them up to your level. \"When the students forget to take notes and sit with their mouths open, then you are teaching. Education begins on the inside. It is now something that goes in from the outside.\" The standards that Dr. Holroyd set for his own students were reflected in the widely-held belief that his recommendation alone was enough to get a stu- dent into any medical school in the country. Dr. Holroyd spent many hours with students in the cafeteria de- scribing his early experiences and lengthy trips. Once, reminiscing about the 1920s at La SaiJe, he said: \"We could not at that time afford expensive research equipment; consequent/)' ive had to speciaiize in teaching.\" \"His- recommendation is tantamount to accep- tance,\" said one of Dr. Holroyd's more prominent former students, the late distinguished psychiatrist Dr. Francis J. Braceland, '26. \"I remember when we were at Broad and Stiles. There were mostly Brothers on the faculty. Then word was out that this young professor from Penn was teaching and that he was really insistent on good work. You would see boys in the corridor who had been sent out of his classroom for not paying attention. Everyone knew that they were in the presence of an outstanding teacher — a man who was reallv an academician.\" ;ft Turns . . . Re-Asserting Eminent Domain The way to become 88 years of age with such good grace was surely to have so many interests: travel — by rail and sea, chiefly — , Welsh hymn tunes — played by himself — , the alumni, the Brothers individually and as an evolving group, St. Clement's and other Episcopal parishes, and on and on. * * * Dr. Holroyd also drove a succession of named cars. Esmereida transported the lab's contents from 1240 North Broad St. to 20th and Olney in 1930. That was probably the last time Dr. Holroyd got out of second gear. All the years on the Boulevard from Pilling Street were perilous because of his sedate pace. Dents were always in the rear of the car. The left turn at 20th Street, punctuated by impeccably polite greetings to Dr. Holroyd chats with Dr. Francis J. Braceland, '26 (/eft) and Brother James Conaghan. F.S.C.. during 1970 ceremonies when he was honored for 50 years of distinguished service. everyone in sight, was a daily thrill. Come to think of it, the attainment of so great an age was remarkable after all. —Brother Patrick Ellis, F.S.C., Ph.D. La Salle. Spring 1985 HOLROYD— continued \"He was a disciplinarian and he stood for excel- lence which is what we need, especially in medi- cine,\" says H. Blake Hayman. M.D.. LL.D., '41, an emeritus member of the university's Board of Trustees. \"He was fair in every way. He was con- structive, not destructive. He taught you to strive for the highest. He exemplified everything that goes with strong character.\" \"Your first exposure to Dr. Holroyd's class wasn't unlike Parris Island\" recalls John T. Magee, M.D., '53. \"We were warned repeatedly how tough it would be to get into medical school and reminded that most of us wouldn't make it. Because of this you were advised to 'change (your major) quickly if you can't hack it.' But if you made it and proved you were a student by the second year, there was an entirely different at- mosphere. In fact. I remember the great pleasure involved when you were finally invited to his inner sanctum.\" \"To enter Dr. Holroyd's office is to be in touch with both a teacher and a tradition,\" wrote John J. Keenan, '52. professor of English at the university, in a 1969 La Salle article. \"Holroyd is a legendary teacher. \\'o gathering of former biology majors at La Salle is without its galaxy of shared memories of Holroydian humor and affable imitations of 'the good doctor.' ' \"To someone coming out of a parochial high school,\" says Dr. Magee. \"he was a tremendously colorful man. He was also the most polished lecturer I had ever heard. I remember one year when we didn't have a botany course per se, but Dr. Holroyd offered an elective entitled 'Taxonomy of the Flower- ing Plants.' A Burpee Seed Catalogue was the text- book for the course. The four guys in the class just ate it up. Which proves that a good teacher can teach anything.\" \"He represents the old school,\" says Joseph F. Flubacher, Ed.D., '35, professor of economics at La Salle, a longtime friend and recipient along with Holroyd of the first \"Lindback Awards\" for dis- tinguished teaching in 1961. \"He held students to some standards and taught some real content. In the end they respected him for it. There were no bull sessions in his class, but afterwards he would spend as much time as necessary answering questions.\" Dr. Holroyd retired as chairman of La Salle's Biology Department in 1960 after suffering the first of two heart attacks. A bachelor, he traveled ex- tensively. His summer journeys down the Amazon, across Africa, the Orient, Egypt or around the world, invariablv included reunions with former students and provided many of the anecdotes that colored his classroom lectures. Dr. Holroyd was honored frequently. He received an honorary doctor of science degree from La Salle in 1927, a Lindback for \"distinguished teaching\" in 1961, and the university's third annual \"President's Medal,\" given to the person who had done the most for La Salle, in 1966. But the finest tribute to Dr. Holroyd, a vestryman in the Anglican Church, came on Jan. 11, 1970, when La Salle celebrated his 50th anniversary on campus by designating the science building the \"Roland Holroyd Science Center\" and conferring on him a diploma of affiliation as a member of the Institute of the Brothers of the Christian Schools. He thus became nauguralion ceremonies for Brother Daniel Burke, on Oct. 19. 1969 one of the few non-Roman Catholics in the world to become affiliated with the Christian Brothers. \"Dr. Holroyd always insisted that he was Catholic, not Roman but Anglican,\" recalls Brother F. Christopher, F.S.C., Ph.D., La Salle's retired director of admissions. \"Long before ecumenism was in fashion, he would take the young (Christian Brothers) Scholasticates to visit his (St. Clement's Anglican) church sanctuary. This wasn't part of his course but a living testament to his own personal convictions. One of his real joys, of course, was his Affiliation with the Christian Brothers.\" In 1980, La Salle initiated an annual Holroyd Lec- ture Series in honor of the beloved professor. Guest lecturers have included Drs. C. Everett Koop, surgeon general of the United States; Thomas E. Starzel, who is well-known for his pioneering efforts in liver trans- plantation; Michael E. DeBakey, the noted pioneer in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases; John Potts, chief of staff, Massachusetts General Hospital, and Edward Stemmler, '50, dean of the University of Pennsylvania Medical School. Dr. Holroyd served with the U.S. Army infantry and medical corps during World War I. He was one of the founders of La Salle's Alpha Epsilon Honor Society and an active lifelong member of St. Cle- ment's Episcopal Church. At the wish of the family, there was no viewing. A graveside prayer service was held at the Christian Brother's Provincialate, in Ammendale, Md. La Salle, Spring 1985 The Bishops and the Economy By Michael J. Kerlin, Ph.D., '57 ne day recently I had a conversation with a wise woman of my acquaint- ance from outside academe. She had been listening to me talk for some time about the studies of various friends when she observed, \"All the philosophers and theologians seem to be getting into economics these days. What are the economists into?\" To which I, being clever, answered, \"Why, despair, I think.\" She thought for a while and then said, \"Despair, no doubt, at all the philosophers and theologians getting into economics.\" Obviously she is more clever than I am. In fact, economists and businessmen may not de- spair at the sight of so many non-economists talking about the economy, but they have to be a little puzzled. After all, matters economic can be quite complex, even for them with years of intimate con- sideration; and here are people educated and ex- perienced in much different realms, speaking at great length outside these realms. Such puzzlement must have motivated a fair bit of the negative reaction, even derision, in the press and elsewhere to Catholic Social Teaching and the U.S. Economy, the book- length draft statement prepared by an ad hoc commit- tee of American bishops and released in November 1984. It is only fair to add, though, that most of the published comments pro and con have come from assorted humanists daring enough to brave these treacherous waters. The conference of bishops had formed the commit- tee of five under the chairmanship of Bishop Rembert Weakland, OSB, of Milwaukee, in 1980. Its assign- ment was to undertake a study of the economy and to prepare a statement for their November 11-15, 1984, national meeting. As the committee worked and inter- viewed scores of theologians, philosophers, econom- ists, businessmen and labor leaders, rumors circulated that the draft would involve a wide-rang- ing critique of the American economy with a direc- tion not likely to be welcomed by the Reagan adminis- tration or its supporters. The rumors were enough to bring a group of generally conservative lay Catholics together under the leadership of William Simon, for- mer Secretary of the Treasury, and Michael Novak, Resident Scholar at the American Enterprise In- stitute, in preparation of an alternative document. On their side, the bishops decided to delay publication until after the 1984 presidential election in order to avoid any appearance of partisanship in that contest. The rest of the bishops have had until February 15, 1985, to offer responses. The committee will develop a second draft over March-May, 1985, for a general discussion at their June meeting. A vote on the final document will take place in November. > »ta m VttU Stggj What's Ncw^r i< BISHOPS— continued N eedless to say, the bishops knew that in writing about the economy and in making specific economic suggestions, they would appear to have exceeded their competence and their mission. The New York Times surveyed the Catholics of Pawtucket, Rhode Island, and captured in the refrain, \"They should mind their own business,\" Most people could get similar soundings in their neighborhoods. A little his- tory reveals, however, that clergymen from curates to popes have been taking their theological education into economics for a long time. The encyclicals Rerum Novarum (1891), Quadragesimo Anno (1931) and Mater et Magister (1961) were notable instances of such excursions, and they all provoked controversy in their day. Protestant thinkers from Walter Rauschenbusch and Paul Tillich on the left to Carl Mclntyre and Jerry Falwell on the right have made similar efforts at varying levels of profundity. That modern clergymen should have turned to economic issues is not surprising. Many of the legal sections in the Hebrew bible concern the economy of the Israelites: the prophets challenged the com- mercial practices of their hearers; and Jesus himself, without benefit of degrees or notable personal ex- perience, based parables on business activities and criticized the behavior of his contemporaries. Admit- tedly, no one can find scripture passages about the business cycle, international debt or welfare systems in the twentieth century. Neither Moses nor the prophets, Jesus nor his disciples had to confront these problems. But we do. And, if these problems touch on the dignity and happiness of people, they must be open to and may demand specifically Jewish and Christian concern. The help that we find in our tra- dition is one of orientation instead of exact commen- tary. When the bishops write about the economy, they undertake a task incumbent on Christians univer- sally— to deal with the pain and strife of people as Jesus would have dealt with them. The bishops are different only inasmuch as they must do so as leaders in a religious community. Their situation here is much like their situation in speaking about abortion, an issue about which the bible has even less to say. I he economy is, then, the proper turf of bishops as much as abortion is. Yet saying this much isn't the same as saying that they have written well about it. Many commentators welcomed their intervention and wished it had arrived early enough to affect the presidential election and at the very least to coun- terbalance those episcopal pronouncements which seemed to invite a pro-life vote for Ronald Reagan and his congressional followers. My reading of the periodicals, colored naturally by the periodicals I read, revealed a preponderance of unfavorable re- ponses. Charles Krauthammer in The New Republic speaks about the bishops' narrowness of vision and profound naivete. George Will in the Philadelphia Inquirer says that they hurl cliches at intractable problems. Andrew Greeley in America describes the pastoral as an inept and inadequate document; and even Thomas Resse, SJ, its associate editor, speaks about the whipping the bishops have taken and the need for serious revision. I read almost all these com- ments before reading the whole draft through, and I approached it feeling sure that the editors of the Wall Street Journal must have been correct in inviting them to retake Economics 101. As I made my way through it, though, I discovered an essay which, while flawed in serious ways, was clearly written, inspiring in its vision, interesting in its details, and very dis- criminating about the distinct enterprises of theology and economics. What's more, it has an element of unusual and refreshing ecclesiastical self-criticism on matters like salary levels and union busting in churchly organizations. Most news and editorial summaries of the pastoral have focussed, as one would expect, on the bottom line, its policy recommendations in Part II. This focus has to be a major disappointment to the bishops since they stake their expertise and authority not there, but on the elaborate discussion of principles in Part I. Their starting-point is the assertion that all strategies must revolve around the question of human dignity. Anyone evaluating an economic system must ask, \"What does it do for people?\" What does it do to people?\" And, since poor people are particularly vul- nerable, they ask above all, what it does for and to the poor. They make their own an expression of Pope John Paul II which is much heard in Catholic litera- ture, \"the preferential option for the poor.\" It will not matter to have a booming economy for most people if the people at the bottom live in conditions incom- patible with human dignity. The bishops consciously adopt the idea of the American philosopher John Rawls that inequalities of wealth are just only to the extent that they improve life for those worst-off. They trace this notion beyond any particular modern philosophy to the nature of the Kingdom of God preached by Jesus and to the manner of his own action. The gospel was brought especially to and for the poor, and the Sermon on the Mount makes salva- tion dependent on how we treat them. The bishops elaborate their theology by the analysis of three key notions: creation, covenant and community. With the biblical theme of creation, they evoke the position of human beings in a world offered to them as a gift by God. Men and women, made in the image and likeness of the creator, have the joy and responsibility of forming this world with him. They do so under a convenant which begins with Adam and has its guarantee in Jesus and which can- not be broken by sin and evil. The covenant, in turn, establishes a community binding people of every sex, race , class and advantage together. An economy will have value insofar as it helps them in keeping the covenant and in developing the talents and resources given to them. \"It should enable persons to find a significant measure of self-realization in their labor; it should permit persons to fulfill their material needs through adequate renumeration; and it should make possible the enhancement of unity and solidarity with the family, the nation and the world community.\" These criteria allow the bishops to speak of eco- nomic rights no less than of civil rights. \"Everyone has a legitimate claim on economic benefits to at least the minimum level necessary for the social protection of human dignity.\" At the minimum, they have a claim on food, clothing, shelter, rest and medical care adequate for the protection of physical life as well as security in the face of sickness, widowhood, old age or unemployment. They must have free initiative in the economic field and the possibility of decent work, rights which get particularized in the institu- tions of private property and labor unions. The call, in the end, is not just for better wages and conditions, but for wider participation and power in society, in sum, for what has come to be known as economic democracy. Although such rights do not appear in the United States constitution, the bishops understand them to be rooted in the national tradition as well as in Jewish and Christian faith. M ow well has the American economy performed by these criteria? The bishops see an encouraging rec- ord. \"In its comparatively short history, the United States has made impressive strides in the effort to provide material necessities, employment, health care, education, and social services for its people. It has done this within a political system based on the precious value of freedom.\" Over against these ac- complishments, they note failures which are at times massive and ugly. Their list of short-comings includes abiding hunger, homelessness, unemployment, racial discrimination, urban decay, and the absence of space for leisure, prayer and comtemplation. They support their catalogue with references to formal studies and common experience alike. When they reach for explanations, they cite two factors in par- ticular: \"inadequate intellectual institutional re- sources for the protection of human rights and forms of individual and group selfishness undermining social solidarity.\" Any solution, then, will mean a reform of institutions as well as a transformation of sentiments. On the institutional level, it will require new structures which will handle the basic needs of the poor and bring people from the margins of society to the center of power, while, on the personal level it will require rejecting all those life-styles and at- titudes which put things before people, profit before justice, accumulation before life. Keading Part I, I am hard pressed to see how any- one with Christian conviction or simply moral sensitivity can be in deep disagreement about the basic principles. When the bishops talk of the Ameri- can economy, they hit on virtues and vices which must be apparent to anyone with eyes to see and a mind to think. So much is Part I on the mark that the Simon and Novak \"lay letter,\" published a little earlier as Toward the Future: Catholic Social Thought and the U.S. Economy, is in substantial agreement as to principles and problems. On these points, it differs from the pastoral only in nuances, albeit important nuances. It stresses, correctly in my view, a healthy economy as a field in which people have an op- portunity freely to do something for themselves and others rather than one in which they are, by and large, recipients to be acted for and on. And it puts a greater emphasis, again correctly, on the human- izing side of American political, cultural and eco- nomic institutions. For example, it makes much of the positive moral significance of free markets and profit incentives for individuals and corporations. The lay letter, furthermore, acknowledges all the suffering depicted by the bishops' draft. But it does so with less, indeed too little sense of urgency, and it underplays the linkage of our moral and material woes to the La Salle, Spring 1985 BISHOPS— continued The bishops propose defining full employment in the range of 3 to 4 per cent dark side of those very institutions which its authors, like the bishops and me, would foster and uphold. The major difference between the two letters is in the solutions the authors offer. The lay letter, while avoiding anything resembling a libertarian or Ja/ssez- faire approach, puts its main accent on economic growth, moral and material incentives, and personal responsibility. It invokes government only as a last resort since it fears statism, the concentration of ul- timate power in civil authority, as much if not more than any of the ills noted earlier. The bishops are much less sanguine about the power of people to lift themselves up from poverty and much more confi- dent of the benign agency of government. They are also far more specific about what they would like to have happen. The list is familiar enough to have prompted one of my colleagues in economics to say that it must have been the Roman Catholic episcopate which broke into Watergate in 1972. It is surely the platform of the George McGovern wing of the Demo- cratic Party which we get from them, not the ideology and strategies of Ronald Reagan. /\\ short article can only give the barest summary of the practical recommendations in Part II of the pastoral. The bishops find the present rate of un- employment at the height of the 1983-85 recovery mor- ally unjustified and propose defining full employ- ment in the range of 3 to 4 percent. Although they envisage a thriving private economy as the main cure, they give a large role to government in the creation of jobs and job training programs. Equally reprehen- sible for them is the concentration of income (49 per- cent for the top 20 percent of the population) and wealth (43 percent for the top 5 percent of the popu- lation) at the peaks. Their solutions include further steps to overcome racial and sexual discrimination, special help to disadvantaged groups like blacks and women, a more generous and less punitive welfare system, and more progressive tax rates. While decry- ing collectivism and praising private initiative, they also ask for planning at every level with wide partici- pation by the individuals and groups affected. In in- ternational relations, they advocate helping third world countries by bringing interest rates down, eas- ing debt repayment schedules, opening markets and basing aid on economic need instead of national se- curity. Some journalists such as Patrick Buchanan led me to expect them to come down on the side of com- parable worth legislation and propping up failing in- dustries, but happily I could find neither proposal in the text. None of the recommendations actually made in the pastoral are outlandish, and they come accompanied by intelligent arguments and valuable documenta- tion. Despite Jerry Falwell, they do not constitute a socialist agenda; and, contrary to Andrew Greeley, the bishops put them forward with considerable mod- esty. They seek to avoid the \"perils of prophecy,\" to use Charles Krauthammer's witty and mocking phrase, by distinguishing sharply between their theo- logical convictions and their policy positions. The two poles are separated by an epistemological divide — a divide made inevitable by different methods of con- sideration and different degrees of certainty. Still, tying so many items together in thesis form leaves the draft open to much fair criticism. No price tag is given, and even sympathetic commentators like Mario Cuomo, Joseph Califano and Morton Kon- dracke have wondered about the political and econ- omic wisdom of so large a package. Some proposals such as the opening of American markets and protec- tion of American jobs, the lowering of inflation and the move to full employment at 3 percent, the enlarge- ment of the welfare system and the encouragement of self-reliance, the cutting of interest rates and the increase of spending, are in conflict at least over the short-run. The general bent is towards regulation and redistribution no matter how much the bishops deny these orientations. They give too little attention to the indications that regulatory and redistributionist routes at some point worsen the situation of everyone, the poor included, morally as well as economically. Perhaps Thomas Reese is correct that the Ad Hoc Committee should have stuck to theology and general counsel for now and delayed the detailed appli- cations of Part II. The bishops would have been saved the embarrassment of having to make a notable re- treat or of having to reject sound advice. For myself, though, I think it was important for them to have tried their hand at the whole task whatever their vulner- ability. Otherwise the letter would have remained largely unnoticed and would have impressed its few readers as merely pious and vacuous. We should take the document at face-value — as a draft by a commit- tee admitting its limitations and inviting comment and disagreement not just by their colleagues but also by the rest of us, Catholic and non-Catholic alike.

And, try as he might, he could barely suppress a question-mark- like smile. He was here? Now? Why? And why now? (\"So many things this season were a struggle,\" he would confide several days later. \"And at the end I figured, 'Hey, we've carried our pain. It's all going to end up ok. It has to.' I figured it was going to start by beating Army, and then we'll win the semifinal, and we'll be in the final game. (\"You never project that you're going to win and go into the NCAA tournament, for sure. But you know you have a healthy chance. And you know that these particular three, four days will make up for all the hassles, all the havoc\") But it had ended, in the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference post-season tournament, in one day for La Salle. Wobbling after a 15-12 regular season that had concluded with losses to Holy Cross, Fairfield and DePaul, the Explorers were eliminated by an Army team which they had defeated twice earlier, and which they led by eleven points in the second La Salle, Spring 1985 11 BASKETBALL— continued \"Out of the clear blue we'd change right before your eyes\" half this afternoon before falling ungraciously, 76-64, in overtime. So much for healthy chances. Hassles and havoc returned. \"This La Salle team,\" veteran Philadelphia Daily News basketball maven Dick Weiss would comment the next day, \"unfortunately will be remembered for all the times it self-destructed.\" At the podium in Brendan Byrne Arena, Ervin ad- dressed the afternoon's failure. It developed into a revealing — and question-raising — critique of the season. \"Collectively, we got real tentative with the lead,\" the coach suggested. \"I think we've been 'injured' for about two or three weeks. We've stopped 'playing' when we've been going in a positive direction and started standing around. It was so much like playing not to lose. That was our inertia over the last several weeks.\" Ervin stopped, gazed around the room, seeking answers to his own and reporters' (unasked) ques- tions. \"We needed a win to get out of it. We're missing something. There have been times in every game over the last three or four weeks that we were involved, and too many times could not resolve the problems that we ourselves had presented to ourselves.\" Reporters drifted away, more puzzled than they had been before. \"It really ended up on a sour note, losing the last four games,\" junior guard Chip Greenberg would say a few days later. \"DePaul, I can see us losing to. But the other three teams? I felt we should have beaten them.\" Lefty Ervin had spent a weekend now, reviewing the season and trying to find answers to his own doubts. He sits in the basketball office in Hayman Hall, fiddling with a sharply ground pencil. \"A deli- cate point,\" he says — later noting \"how fragile\" a season's determining point can be. \"When it was over, I was in shock,\" the former Explorer player admitted. \"Not that a good Army team beat us ... as much as we never really put it together. We played some good games, did some good things. I don't think that the season was a real terrible season, but it went from a potentially real good one to. . .\" To what? \"Medicore,\" Ervin said. \"I'd say — you know how players are — pretty close to lousy,\" said Greenberg. \"It was a tough year. Dis- appointing. Frustrating. All that.\" There were some high points. The Explorers split in the Big Five (defeating Penn and St. Joseph's, losing to Temple and NCAA champion Villanova). They Honorable menlion All America Steve Black led the Explorers in scoring and finished his career with 2,032 points, a total exceeded only by Tom Gola and Michael Brooks. were 8-6 in the MCAA. They played a superb game in the consolation round of the Apple Stanford Invita- tion, edging Brigham Young. But La Salle also lost double-overtime games, coughed up 20-point leads, and had, generally, great difficulty maintaining com- posure as the clock ran down. \"We just weren't 'smart' in some way,\" Ervin said. \"We as coaches worked harder than we ever have; the kids worked real hard. I think the kids got along tremendously — one of our nicest bunch of kids. No ego problems. No in-fighting. No struggles about who gets the shots. The one thing that we didn't do: We didn't play smartly the last four, five minutes of enough games.\" Chip Greenberg, a point guard, bit his lip. He'd heard the comments before, but now the season was over. He too chose not to point fingers. \"What he (Ervin) says is true,\" Chip said. \"We can't do that, play 'dumb' and win.\" At the naggingly provocative press conference at season's end, Ervin had said that this club was in a sense tainted by a \"missing ingredient\" — something that he couldn't \"put a finger on.\" Now, at his desk, Lefty took a reflective stab. \"It was 'team play' — whatever that is,\" Lefty said. \"You can put five real short, slow guys out there. Or 12 Besides playing tenacious defense like this and finishing as the fourth highest career scorer (3,807 points) in La Salle's history, 6-7 Ralph Lewis shouldered most of the rebounding burden in the absence of \"Truck\" Bulls, averaging almost 10 rebounds a game for the undersized Explorers. Larry Koretz at 6-8 was the tallest Explorer in the starting lineup and finished second in rebounding with 5.3 rebounds a game. He also finished Ihird in scoring with 10.6 ppg. you can put five 6-9 jumping jets out there. But for the coach, it's the same process: Get them to play together. And we didn't do that consistently at both ends.\" Frequently, La Salle played admirable defense; and as often the Explorers played \"Oops, get him, I missed him.\" Tenacious protectors of the ball for long stretches, turnovers still popped out at key moments. Undersized, their sure-handed rebounders grasped only quicksilver when possession was imperative. \"Out of the clear blue,\" said Ervin, \"we'd change right before your eyes. Our level was erratic: five, six guys on an elevator pushing buttons at random. Up, down. Up, down. We never had a steady ride for an extended period.\" Of course, they never had a steady truck on which to ride, either. Albert (Truck) Butts was denied eligibility at season's outset because of an NCAA rule covering an athlete's age and participation at more than one post- high school institution. Butts attended Frederick Military Academy and played there after having reached the age of 20. The NCAA ruled, and appeal courts agreed, that the 6-9 center had exhausted his eligibility after three years at LaSalle. Butts became 24 on December 11, became a non-player, remained a student, and practiced daily against the varsity. \"I tried to forget we didn't really have Truck, which was just fooling yourself,\" said Chip Greenberg. \"The guy's like a part of you. How can you pretend he's not there? Plus, he's a 6-9, 220-pound guy. A school like this, we don't have the luxury of bringing two, three 6-9 guys off the bench to fill a spot.\" And, says Ervin, Truck Butts is no run-of-the- mill-6-9er. \"Selfishly, as a coach,\" said Ervin, \"I was crushed that we didn't have him. And for the young man himself, I think they (NCAA and courts) damaged him. Hurt the guy's name, diminished his chances of making a big (NBA) contract. He's a really fine play- er, much better than he was (in 1984). We played against him every day in practice, which in a way might have been a mistake on my part. Because every day he killed us. Beat the hell out of us. Every day we saw just how good he is, how much he would have meant for us on a game-to-game basis.\" Old line from a knocked-out contender: \"Anybody get the number of that truck?\" | Frank Brady covers the Lakers for the Los Angeles Herald Examiner. La Salle, Spring 1985 13 ecommended For Your Reading Pleasure Another sampling of observations and opinions offered by some of La Salle's faculty and administrators about their recent reading experiences. ARTHUR J. BANGS, F.S.C. Associate Professor, Education Material that recounts actual events or at least is firmly rooted in historical research heightens for me the interest, enjoyment and potential impact of reading. Hence, biographies and nar- ratives of the Michener mold are what I commend for consider- ation. Easily the most satisfying for me in recent months was Michael Mott's absorbing The Seven Mountains of Thomas Merton, an authoritative, well documented life of that re- markably fascinating man who, many alumni will recall, sur- faced into American conscious- ness in 1948 with his compelling autobiography. The Seven Storey Mountain. Generating from his base at Gethsemene's Cistercian monastery a meta-aggregate of literary force, Merton sensitized our society to changing monastic life, the meaning of prayer and spirituality and the mystery of war and peace. Beginning with life in France and England, the treatment of Merton's rich life necessarily embraces an arrest- ing amalgam of stimulation. It is the joyous saga of a brilliant indi- vidual struggling with freedom, integrity, friendship, truth, death, existence. It embodies his- tory, religion, psychology, poli- tics, philosophy, etc. — something for everyone. Another biography of some forceful appeal was Jack Rubin's life of Karen Homey, the Gentle Rebel of Psychoanalysis whose bio extends from medical train- ing and practice in pre-war Ber- lin to a leadership role in the psychoanalytic movement in America — an authentic 20th cen- tury heroine who contributed significantly to contemporary views on feminine psychology and the socio-cultural inter- pretation of human behavior. Finally I recommend Michener's Poland and The Covenant (South Africa) both of which afforded me a penetrating historical foundation for under- standing these tragically troubled areas of today's world. KEVIN J. HARTY Associate Professor. English & Communication Arts Because I have been busy over the past two years working on two business writing text- books— one published in Janu- ary, 1985, and one due out late in 1986 — I haven't had a great deal of time to do pleasure reading. These two textbook projects have, however, allowed me to read a number of worthwhile books on writing, four of which will be of interest to La Salle alumni and alumnae. Anyone needing a quick handy reference book should turn to two complementary books by Charles T. Brusaw, Gerald J. Aired, and Walter E. Oliu: The Business Writer's Handbook and The Handbook of Technical Writing. Both books contain more than 500 entries arranged alphabetically and carefully cross-referenced. The entries fall into three categories: quick answers to frequently asked questions (does this sentence re- quire \"affect\" or \"effect\"?), slightly longer discussions of more complicated grammatical issues (is there really one set of rules governing the use of com- mas?), and more sustained sec- tions dealing with the various forms of writing business and technical people must produce on a regular basis (is this the cor- rect format for a proposal directed at a hostile audience?). Both handbooks are available in paperback, and one or the other belongs on every working per- son's desk next to the dictionary. Anyone interested in under- taking a program of self-im- provement in writing should turn first to FeeJ Free to Write by La Salle's John Keenan. Keenan's book is — as computer folk like to say — \"user friendly.\" There are no long lists of rules — followed by longer lists of exceptions to rules. Instead, the reader gets practical, no nonsense advice, written with a sense of humor. Like most good writing books, Feel Free has its gimmick — a five part approach to writing that asks writers to consider purpose, audience, format, evidence, and organization before, while, and after writing. Once Keenan's advice has been digested, those wanting further suggestions should turn to David W. Ewing's Writing for Results in Business, Govern- ment, the Sciences and the Pro- fessions. Ewing, an editor for the prestigious Harvard Business Re- view and a member of the fac- ulty of the Harvard Business School, has written what one re- viewer called \"the Rolls Royce of business writing books.\" Writing for Results provides detailed dis- cussions, liberally supplemented by real-life examples, of how readers and writers need to in- teract to produce effective let- 14 ters, memos, proposals, and re- ports. A quick trip to the local book- store will show that there is no dirth of books on writing avail- able. These four books, however, bring special pleasure. Each is a rarity among books offering ad- vice on how to write. Each is a well-written book which prac- tices what it preaches. PATRICIA B. HABERSTROH Associate Professor, English & Communication Arts Several years ago, a friend rec- ommended that I read Paul Scott's The Raj Quartet, but it was only recently, when PBS first announced the Masterpiece Theater series, The Jewel in the Crown, that I read it. I can highly recommend the Quartet, particu- larly the first volume. The Jewel in the Crown. Those who have watched the television series will be interested in the dif- ference between the books and the film, since the four novels de- velop the basic story from many different points of view, some of them not presented in the film version. Since I teach Modern British Literature, I tend to read the con- temporary British novel, and there are several women writers now popular in England whose novels are appearing in the Unit- ed States. The works of Susan Hill, Doris Lessing, Margaret Drabble, and Barbara Pym are sometimes hard to find, but they do show up in better bookstores and most of these novels are worth looking for. Science fiction readers might like Doris Les- sing's \"space fiction,\" any one of the five novels in her Canopus in Argos: Archives series in which Lessing creates a space-age world, a unique and imaginative vision, in order to explore the problems of our world. Outside of novels, I am pres- ently reading Pierre Schneider's Matisse, a beautifully illustrated introduction to the painter, and Maida Heatter's Book of Great Chocolate Desserts. I do not cook any of these desserts; I just read about them and look at the pic- tures. Nevertheless, both of these would make my list of all- time great books. ARTHUR L. HENNESSY Associate Professor, History Having visited forty countries so far, I like travel books. Not travel guides like those of Fodor which I also find very useful, but books about travel. The best of this type today is Paul Theroux. Three of his works are: The Great Railway Bazaar, The Old Patagonian Express, and his most recent, The Kingdom by the Sea: A Journey Around Great Britain. The first involved getting on a train in London and taking it to Japan where he could come back on the Trans-Siberian Railroad through Europe to London. The second described leaving Med- Hennessy Lautz Clabaugh ford, Massachusetts via train where ever possible. The third involved walking around the sea coast of England and Northern Ireland. This trip took three months and it went from Margate to Margate. Why are these works popular? He talks to all kinds of people. For example on the Promenade at Blackpool he made conversa- tion with Mr. and Mrs. Ernie Fudge and later with Miss Murine Mudditch, typical Eng- lish people on a holiday and he makes them real people. On the Trans-Siberian Railway in De- cember you can feel the 30 below temperature and taste the awful Soviet meals. In India you feel sick along with him. As a frus- trated novelist he has excellent descriptive powers and a good narrative sense. Unlike most travel writers he puts it down as it is — like commenting that all the old people in England go to the shore and sit looking out to sea never back to the land. \"Even the dogs on the sea shore look old.\" I eagerly await his next travel book. Perhaps he will walk the Atlantic Coast from Maine to Florida. RICHARD LAUTZ Associate Professor, English & Communication Arts If you have never discovered E.F. Benson's \"Lucia\" novels, you are missing out on a lot of fun. I have just finished the third in the series, Miss Mapp, which is set in a provincial English town in the twenties. The inhabi- tants are familiar types, but they behave like Henry James charac- ters gone berserk. Incidentally, Benson lived in James' home in Rye, where Mapp also reputedly dwells. I don't read many current nov- els, but I have always kept up with prolific Iris Murdoch's latest. In this case, the title is ir- restible for academics: The La Salle, Spring 1985 15 RECOMMENDED FOR YOUR READING PLEASURE— continued Philosopher's Pupil. The setting is an English spa, where bathing is a communal ritual, and almost everyone's life is affected when a famous old philosopher returns home to die. His former student's involvement in his last days provides ironic counterpoint, es- pecially when you recall that Murdoch herself has professed philosophy at Oxford. My latest poetry find is a superb new voice, Sharon Olds, whose The Dead and the Living was the 1983 Lamont Poetry Selection. Her book commences with moving short poems based on photographs of political sub- jects, like the Tulsa Race Riot of 1921, and ends with memorable works about her family that re- sist sentimental cliches. Another book that I just read is also about a related subject I find immensely fascinating. Susan Sontag's On Photography is not a new work, but it's chatty and in- cisive, convincing me over and over that I have missed my real calling: ace photographer. GARY K. CLABAUGH Director, Graduate Program in Education Bag ladies, bums, grate people and winos are ever more visible. The sight of drunken, insane, homeless and destitute people sleeping on grates and rummag- ing through trash and garbage has become a fact of daily life. Recently, for example, my family and I were in Chinatown. As we were walking to our car we passed a filthy and ragged man who was sprawled on the pave- ment, mumbling to himself. My wife, son and I walked past with embarrassed civil inattention; but my four year old daughter stared in disbelief. Catching her stare the man suddenly extended his begrimed hand to her. She took it before I could say or do anything. Responding to his hu- manity rather than to his rags or his illness, she took his hand and shook it with the same smiling courtesy she would use with any other adult. The man responded with a wide and toothless smile, then resumed his incoherent mumblings. I was too taken aback to do much of anything at the time. I have, however, given it much thought since. IRONWEED by William Ken- nedy is a book about street people. Set in Albany in the 1930's it recounts the tale of one Francis Phelan, professional baseball player, wino and self- proclaimed bum. Along with his down and out girl friend Helen, Francis struggles to retain what is left of his dignity while trying to find a drink, a meal, a flop, and some sort of meaning for his life. At first one might react to such a book precisely as the editors of many publishing houses did: \"Who wants to read a book about a bum, particularly a bum in Albany?\" But when the book was finally published, due to the in- tervention of Saul Bellow, it won rave reviews and, ulimately, the Pulitzer Prize for literature. The bottom line reason for these kudos lies in Kennedy's technical skill as a writer and, far more importantly, his ability to pull out and display the humanity in even the most degraded of us. A fact which a four year old re- cognizes without prompting, but one we grownups need remind- ing of from time to time. JOHN J. McCANN Associate Professor, French It has been my good fortune to find, just when I need him or her the most, the right author, that indispensable companion who seems to be writing just for me. Such was the case last summer when in the quiet of my moun- tain retreat, I discovered the outrageous genius of Annie Dillard. I read first her Teaching a Stone to Talk, a collection of meditations, polished yet tough- mined, that probed the natural world and the mystery of man alike, the world of touch and the realm of spirit, helping me to hear more clearly the quiet at the center of my being. I turned next to her Holy the Firm and went with her into the pain of life, into the questions we ask about time and death, reality and sacrifice, and because of her, I now ask the questions more clearly, more honestly. But I must read fiction — there is nothing which better teaches me that life is not so much a puzzle to be resolved as a won- der to be experienced — and so I go on probing the rich vein of 20th Century Irish prose: Joyce MO Q> MFJ McCann Perfecky Quinn Seltzer 16 and O'Connor, Sean O'Faolain, Mary Levin and Edna O'Brien. It is William Trevor, however, that most holds my attention these days, most merits my envy, both in his novels, Other People's Worlds, Fools of Fortune, as well as, and perhaps even more so, in his short story collections, Lovers of Their Time and Beyond The Pale. In such devastatingly beautiful stories as \"The Bedroom Eyes of Mrs. Van- sittart,\" \"Downstairs at Fitz- gerald's\" and \"Beyond The Pole\" he exposes the rich reality of the familiar with a kindly precision, a gentlemanly truthfulness matched by few of his contem- poraries. I invite you, then, to go with him \"Downstairs at Fitzgerald's.\" GEORGE A. PERFECKY Associate Professor, Russian Aleksandr I. Solzhenitsyn, The Gulag Archipelago Three (Harper & Row Perennial Li- brary, 1979), a book I have just read with my students in Slavic 320: The Cultures of the Peoples of the USSR, is my choice for alumni reading. It is much more personal than the first two vol- umes bearing the same title and truly one of the most powerful books of the twentieth century describing the triumph of the human spirit over death and suf- fering in the Soviet concentra- tion camps, which, as Solzhenitsyn points out, preceded those of the Nazis by twenty years and still exist to this day! It is an exciting and at the same time very sobering book dealing with, besides Solzhenitsyn's own personal experience in the camps, escapes such as the one masterminded by the Estonian Georgi Tenno as well as with daring revolts by the concentra- tion camp prisoners such as the Ukrainian-inspired Forty Days of Kengir which was brutally crushed by the Soviet regime. Solzhenitsyn wrote the Gulag Archipelago because of his sense of duty toward those who died in the camps, and the book is truly a powerful memorial to them. WILLIAM QUINN, F.S.C. Associate Professor, Mathematical Sciences Philadelphia, in 1776, was the focal point of the American Rev- olution. All of us are familiar with the high oratory about George III, and the noble senti- ments concerning liberty, free- dom and tyranny. Thomas Jef- ferson, Patrick Henry and Ben- jamin Franklin passionately be- lieved in their cause and knew how to express their sentiments in moving language. But what about the viewpoint of the shop- owners, laborers, tavern-keepers and other 'little' people of Phila- delphia? A recent book The American Revolution: Exploration in the History of American Radicalism, edited by A.F. Young, discusses the Revolution from just this point of view. The chapter on Philadelphia shows that the com- mon man was a lukewarm patriot at best. Perhaps the only consola- tion we can take is the outright opposition to the cause of inde- pendence by people in some other areas, especially Delaware and North Carolina, where to be a Tory was both smart and safe. Quite a different kind of book Stagecoach East by Oliver W. Holmes & Peter T. Rohrbach, gives a fascinating insight of our town in this same period of his- tory. Stage-coaching was big business in the late 1700's, with many supporting services: tav- erns, ferries, road-builders, horse breeders, and the mails. Philadelphia was the hub of the network of routes, with de- partures for New York to the north, Baltimore to the south and York and Lancaster to the west. Over seventy coaches a dav rumbled into the city, only to leave the next day (usually at 4:00 A.M.) on the next stage. Many of the wayside inns that served as stage-stops still exist. Reading this very interesting book will alert us to their ex- istence and to their boisterous contribution to early American folk culture. JOSEPH SELTZER Associate Professor and Chair, Management Department Recently, a number of books on management have been on best seller lists. While In Search of Excellence (Peters and Water- man), The One Minute Manager (Blanchard and Johnson) and Theory Z each has limitations and oversimplifications, they are worth reading. I would like to comment on two other books that may not be best sellers, but are equally worthwhile. In my view, these should also be best sellers. In Managing for Excellence (Wiley, 1984) Bradford and Cohen describe a method for a middle level manager to create 'excellence' in his or her own de- partment. It is the clearest de- scription of how to really imple- ment participatory management that I have ever read. This is a practical approach to creating change, not in the organization as a whole (as Peters and Water- man describe), but in a man- ager's own workgroup. Kilmann's new book, Beyond the Quick Fix (Jossey-Bass, 1984), argues against 'fads' in manage- ment. He suggests that real change in organizations can only take place if five separate aspects of management are con- sidered: 1) organization culture 2) management skills 3) team- building 4) strategy/structure 5) reward systems. Attempting to change only one aspect (i.e. the quick fix) is too simplistic and is likely to be ineffective. Kilmann's suggestion is to use his integrated approach, instead. La Salle, Spring 1985 17 AROUND CAMPUS A Renewed Enthusiasm For Community Service When Vince De Felice, '84, fin- ished his course work a semester ahead of schedule, he decided to spend the spring of 1984 volunteering as a consultant to the Chelten Av- enue Business Association, a group of two dozen store owners who were in the midst of revitalizing a small commercial district not far from La Salle's campus. De Felice, a management major, helped the merchants get organized, polished some of their bookeeping, accounting, and marketing tech- niques, and assisted them in their efforts to become designated as a \"corridor\" which would qualify the area for city economic development funding. Before long, De Felice's ca- reer plans changed considerably. \"I always had been aware of the importance of community develop- ment work,\" he recalled recently. \"But this experience opened my eyes. My education at La Salle and exposure to the Christian Brothers had given me a good business back- ground. But they showed me that you also have to have a social conscious- ness. My volunteer work helped me see a new career path. I saw that I wanted to help people and found a way to use my business degree and management skills in community work.\" De Felice now works full-time in community development. He spends four days a week as assistant direc- tor of the Tolentine Community Center in South Philadelphia under the direction of Brother Joseph Cascerceri, O.S.A., 70, and another day assisting Cascerceri in his other position as director of community and ethnic concerns for the Cardinal's Commission on Human Relations. Much credit for De Felice's career 18 direction belongs to La Salle's Stu- dent Community Service Program, under the coordination of Ann M. Garrity. Now in its second year, the program operates under federal funding provided by the Young Vol- unteers in Action (ACTION) Pro- gram. An additional $5,000 grant was provided this year by the Raskob Foundation for Catholic Activities, Inc. A graduate of Chestnut Hill Col- lege, Garrity previously worked for the Jesuit Volunteer Corps, in Troy, N.Y., and taught seventh grade at the Gesu School, in Philadelphia. She joined La Salle's Urban Studies and Community Services Center in Octo- ber, 1983. Since then, enthusiasm for volunteer work at La Salle has in- creased significantly. Last semester, for example, some 80 students spent at least one day a week in some community service ac- tivity. Another 80 undergraduates volunteered for some individual pro- ject. All told, students donated more than 2,500 hours in community ser- vice during the semester. Some of them tutored elementary school stu- dents, prisoners at Philadelphia's House of Correction or Holmesburg Prison. Others worked with the homeless (see accompanying story). Some accounting majors provided income tax assistance to neigh- borhood residents. Honors Program students initiated a tutoring project with students from Germantown High School. Other students helped to run a \"Safety Day\" for 275 area youngsters. In one of their more ambitious pro- jects last March, a dozen under- graduates participated in an \"Urban Plunge Weekend.\" Living in the Ger- mantown area, they participated in a variety of community service endeavors including helping out in the St. Vincent's soup kitchen, visit- ing a nursing home, touring Ger- mantown with community activists, and helping to renovate houses in the community. \"This program is particularly ap- propriate to La Salle as a Catholic institution,\" says Garrity. \"It's in- timately tied to how we see our- selves as a Christian institution, an institution that speaks to the import- ance of educatingstudents in import- ant values. We've been able to offer students an opportunity to have another educational experience. One that develops a broader under- standing of people. Some students have really been affected by people with whom they worked.\" One such student is Theresa Cur- ran, a junior majoring in social work. She and ten other La Salle students spend a few hours every Thursday afternoon at the House of Correction in northeast Philadelphia. They tutor the men, ranging in ages from the 20s to the 40s, in reading and writing skills, math, and preparation for high school equivalency examinations. Theresa says that just getting worth- while books upstairs into the-prison serves a valuable purpose, but there are other, more important, benefits. \"They need some kind of a struc- ture in their lives, to be able to read and write,\" she says. \"And for us, it's a great experience. I wish everyone could walk through a prison. It's not as dangerous as you'd think. It gives us the opportunity to see lawyers, social workers and psychiatrists working. It's really interesting. And the inmates are really appreciative.\" One of Theresa's most gratifying moments occurred when one of the men said to her, \"Sometimes I forget that people care just for the sake of caring.\" Stanley Named Director of Planned Giving Arthur C. Stanley has been named director of planned giving at La Salle, it was announced by John L. McCloskey, the university's vice president for public affairs. A native of Tenfly, N.J., Stanley had been director of development of the Mid-Atlantic Division of Ameri- can National Red Cross since 1977. Previously, he had been director of development at Temple University's Health Sciences Center for 16 years, and a medical service representative at Parke Davis and Co. Stanley is a U.S. Navy veteran and a graduate of Temple University. He and his wife, Alice, have nine chil- dren. \"The office of planned giving has a two-fold mandate,\" explained Stanley. \"One, to help and en- courage friends and alumni of La Salle to do serious planning in order to better achieve their own financial goals, and two, to show how, through thoughtful planning. La Salle can be helped at the same time.\" The office of planned giving provides information by way of per- sonal contact, brochures, letters, tax and financial planning seminars (see advertisement), will clinics, etc., that are all designed to encourage your thoughtful financial planning for today, tomorrow and the years to come. Long is La Salle's 1st Women's Eastern Winner Kim Long became the first La Salle woman to win an Eastern cham- pionship when she swam to the 1650 yard title at the Eastern Cham- pionships at Harvard on March 3. Her winning time was another school record, 17:05.81, and included a time of 10:19.80 at the 1000 yard mark, which will be recogized as yet another school freestyle record for the freshman from Plymouth-White- marsh High School. Long's performance led the team to a 10th place finish, the best for a La Salle women's swimming team at the Eastern Championships. The men, without an individual champion, placed 6th overall at the Eastern Seaboard Championships at Brown on March 8-9-10. That is the best for the team since a 3rd place finish in 1981. The top individual finishes were 3rd places for sophomores Steve Wil- liams (1650 free, school record 15:42.00) and Chris Cummings (400 individual medley, school record 3:59.72). Junior diver Chris Bergere finished in 10th place off the 3-meter board, which qualified him to com- pete in qualifying competition for the NCAA Tournament. La Salle, Spring 1985 19 \"Coach of the Year\" John Lyons with outstanding swimmers Kim Long and RonaJd Karnaugh. Men Swimmers Win 2nd Metro-Atlantic Title La Salle's men's swimming team, behind Coach-of-the-Year John Lyons, easily won its second con- secutive Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference Championship at Holy Cross' Hart Center on Feb. 16-17. The men won every event but one individual race in swimming and the one-meter diving event, and outscored second-place Fordham, 260-105, while the women's team, which also won the team title last year, placed second to Army, 171-166. The Explorers were led by two freshmen, Ronald Karnaugh and Kim Long, who were the meet's outstanding male and female swim- mers with the highest individual point totals. Karnaugh (Seton Hall Prep, NJ) won three events, all in new MAAC Championship records. He took the 100-yard backstroke in 53.34 and the 200 individual medley in 1:53.94 on Saturday, then won the 200 backstroke in 1:55.55 Sunday, and also swam on the victorious 400 free- style relay on Sunday. Long (Plymouth-Whitemarsh High) has broken and reset every freestyle school record from 200 yards to the mile several times this season. She set a trio of MAAC marks in winning the 1650 free (17:30.92), 500 free (5:05.76), and the 200 free (winning time, 1:57.06: MAAC record of 1:56.74 in trials). Long also had a third place in the 100 freestyle and swam on the winning 400 and 200 freestyle relays. Other men winning two events were senior co-captain Craig Cum- mings (Clarkstown South, New City, NY), 100 (MAAC record 59.96) and 200 breaststroke (2:11.43). and sophomore Steve Williams (Wootton, Potomac, MD) in the 500 freestyle (MAAC record 4:40.07) and the 200 butterfly (1:55.85). Individual men winners included Paul Jarvis (Sr., Boston College Prep), 50 free (MAAC record 21.37): Michael Moore (fr., Manhiem Town- ship, Lancaster. PA), 1650 free (16:54.57); Micahel Cummings (so., Clarkstown South, New City, NY), 400 individual medley (MAAC re- cord 4:06.57); Mike Goerke (jr.. St. Joseph's, S. Amboy, NJ). 200 free (1:44.52); Joe Weindorfer (so., Lower Moreland H.S.), 100 free (MAAC re- cord 47.46); and Phil Bergere, named the meet's outstanding male diver, in the three-meter event. Other women individual winners in addition to Long's triple were senior co-captain Sue Fricker (Bensalem H.S.), 200 backstroke (2:14.90), and Val Selser (so., Council Rock H.S.), 50 free (MAAC record 24.99). Men's relay winners were in the 400 medley, senior co-captain Charlie Messa (Malvern Prep), C. Cummings, Chirs DiLuchio (fr., Salesianum, Wilmington), Jarvis (3:32.61): 800 freestyle. Williams, Jarvis. Goerke, M. Cummings (7:05.33); and the 400 freestyle, Messa, Weindorfer, DiLuchio, Karnaugh (3:12.84). Two women's relays were victors, 400 freestyle, Selser, Long, senior co- captain Anne Murphv (Archbishop Wood H.S.), Barb 'Leutner (fr.. Cardinal O'Hara, H.S.); and the 200 freestyle, Selser, Long, Fricker, Leutner. Although she did not win an indi- vidual event, Luetner was one of the meet's high scorers in the women's competition with three second-place finishes (100, 200, 500 free) and one third (100 butterfly). Lyons was voted Metro Atlantic Athletic Conferences Men's Coach- of-the-Year by his peers for leading his team to its second consecutive team title in two years in the con- ference. It is the first Coach-of-the- Year title for Lyons, who has had a men's conference champion in each of his three seasons at La Salle (1983 East Coast Conference, two MAACs). His men's team completed its dual meet season with an 11-1 re- cord this season, while the women were 7-5. The MAAC championship won by last year's women's team was the first swimming title ever for the Explorer women. 20 Preparing for another delivery of clothing for (he home/ess are (from /ef() Ann M.

La Salle Students Devise Unique Ways to Help The Homeless A number of La Salle University students and staff members have de- vised some unique ways to \"invest\" in the welfare of the homeless in Philadelphia. Their creativity, in fact, could ultimately raise more than $20,000 annually for the street people. In what is believed to be the first such attempt in the nation, members of La Salle's Investment Club are sol- iciting classmates for what they eventually hope will be an endow- ment of $50,000 which would gener- ate about $6,000 a year in interest for the homeless. Club officials hope to raise $3,000 of this amount by the end of the semester. In another innovative measure — also believed to be a campus \"first,\" students are being asked by the uni- versity's Committee for the Home- less to pledge any money left over from their weekly cafeteria meal tickets to a fund used to purchase food for the city's homeless. About 350 students have been donating part of their meal money since this program began. They've collected as much as $565 a week in surplus meal ticket revenue which has been converted into food for the homeless provided by La Salle's Food Services Department. \"We hope to be able to supply most of the food needed for the mobile outreach program sponsored by the Philadelphia Committee for the Homeless,\" said Lori Pompa. the associate director of La Salle Univer- sity's Campus Ministry who is mod- erating the various campus activities for the homeless. \"With such creative fund-raising, La Salle could be the prototype for other univer- sities in the nation, as far as helping the homeless is concerned.\" Ms. Pompa says that a group of La Salle students \"did an inspirational job\" in raising the consciousness of their classmates last October when they sponsored a \"Homelessness Week\" on campus. \"Since then,\" she says, \"interest and concern for the homeless has mushroomed at La Salle.\" Student volunteers come from all socio-economic levels and are majoring in such diverse fields as Accounting, Biology, English, Pol- itical Science, Psychology, and Social Work. Many of these students supported a \"Fast Day\" last fall which gener- ated almost $3,000 for the Catholic Relief Services effort in Ethiopia. One student fraternity recently raised $180 for the homeless by spon- soring a faculty-student soccer game. Coin jars strategically placed in the student cafeteria generate an aver- age of $25/week. About two dozen La Salle students spend two hours a night every week participating on the Philadelphia Committee for the Homeless Mobile Outreach Pro- gram, feeding, clothing, and consol- ing the homeless at various down- town locations. Others work at a Soup Kitchen sponsored by St. Vin- cent DePaul Roman Catholic Church, in Germantown, or help col- lect clothing and blankets to dis- tribute to the needy. According to its moderator, La Salle's Investment Club offers \"something for everyone\" interested in helping the homeless. \"A low overhead operation can do more for the homeless than a large federal department,\" says Doug McCann, who teaches in the univer- sity's Finance Department. \"If you're a liberal, this is the opportunity for social action to solve a problem. If you're a conservative, you can be as- sured that individual effort and the private sector is helping the prob- lem.\" McCann has enlisted the advice of such people as Dr. Stephen I. Meisel, assistant professor of management, to help insure that the endowment fund will be managed efficiently, similar to a trust department of a financial group. The money will be invested in a \"conservative portfolio of bonds and high grade preferred stock,\" he said. McCann explained that one-third of the money collected from partici- pants in the Investment Club pro- gram goes immediately into a Cam- pus Ministry Fund to provide clothing for the homeless. The other two-thirds is invested in the endow- ment. Ms. Pompa's concern for the homeless began in 1980 when she spent half the summer serving as a volunteer at the Dwelling Place, a women's shelter in New York City. In the fall of 1983 she learned about the Philadelphia Committee for the Homeless. Soon, about a dozen La Salle students were being trained to participate in the PCH's Mobile Outreach Program, helping to feed and clothe the homeless living in the streets within a mile of Phila- delphia's City Hall.

Braceland A World-Renowned Psychiatrist A Mass of Christian Burial was celebrated on February 28 at St. Joseph's Cathedral, in Hartford, Conn., for Francis J. Braceland, '26, M.D., Sc.D., FACP, one of the world's leading psychiatrists, who died of heart failure on Feb. 23 in Sarasota, Fla., while visiting relatives. He was 84. Known in professional circles as the \"Dean of American Psychiatry,\" Dr. Braceland had retired in 1983 from the Institute of Living, in Hart- ford, where he had served as presi- dent and psychiatrist-in-chief from 1951 to 1965, and then as senior con- sultant and chairman of planning and development. During his tenure, it became the largest private psy- chiatric hospital in the nation. To residents of Connecticut's capital city, Dr. Braceland was known as \"our friendly neigh- borhood psychiatrist,\" and that's just the way the genial, gray-haired phy- sician liked it even though he had risen to the top of his profession, been knighted by the Pope, and held the rank of Rear Admiral in the Navy. He made it a point to get to know as many of the patients at the state's largest and oldest private mental hospital personally and often expressed concern about the lack of public enlightenment about medi- cine in general. \"The image of the doctor has been changing,\" he once said. \"The doctor has slipped a notch in the affections of people, probably mostly because of being separated from the patient. The old family doctor was a 'Dutch uncle.' He visited in the home and advised them in all manner of things. Though they did not always pay him, they loved him, but this is not always true of the present-day, highly-train- ed specialist.\" Dr. Braceland grew up in Philadel- phia's Brewerytown. He was the oniy member of his graduating class at La Salle and loved to recall in later years how \"lonely\" he was at class reunions. He graduated from Jefferson Medical University in 1930, served a two year internship at Jef- Vith Warmth, Wit, and Charm ferson Hospital, then became an as- sistant physician at the Institute of the Pennsylvania Hospital because of his interest in the emotional aspects of physical disease. In 1935, Dr. Braceland went abroad on a Rockefeller fellowship to work at the Burgholzli Anstalt Psy- chiatric Hospital near Zurich. There he attended Carl Jung's lectures. Once when he visted the Swiss psy- chiatrist at his castle in the Alps, they spent half the night talking. Braceland also became friendly with Thomas Mann and visited him on a number of occasions. Dr. Braceland worked for a short time assisting neurologist Kinnier Wilson at London's Queen Square Hospital and then assumed the clinical directorship at the Institute of the Pennsylvania Hospital. He combined teaching at the University of Pennsylvania's Graduate School of Medicine and Medical College of Pennsylvania with private practice and research. He spent a year as dean at Loyola Unversity's School of Medicine, but was called into active duty by the Naval Reserve at the outset of World War II. Joining the Navy in June, 1942 (he would retire 20 years later with the rank of Rear Admiral), Dr. Braceland became a special assistant to the Surgeon General and chief of psychiatry of the Department of the Navy. Later, he testified at the Nuremberg Trials, and was assigned to examine Rudolf Hess and Julius Streicher, the publisher of Der Sturmer. Dr. Braceland was among the physicians in Washington assigned to monitor the health of President Franklin D. Roosevelt. He was one of the doctors scheduled to accompany FDR to the Yalta Conference in the Soviet Union in 1945, but White House officials cancelled that assign- ment because they feared that some observers would conclude that the president had a psychiatric problem. That was not so, said Braceland dis- cussing the incident a few years later. The president was in excellent health. After the war, Dr. Braceland es- tablished the first psychiatric section at the Mayo Clinic and began train- ing a group of resident students. Dur- ing this time (1946-61], he served as professor of psychiatry at the Uni- versity of Minnesota's Graduate School and chaired the governor's Mental Health Advisory Committee. His achievements in reorganizing the state's mental hospitals earned him a citation from Governor Luther Youngdahl that Dr. Braceland treasured as one of \"the most satisfying\" awards he has received. More than 60 of his former students at Mayo and the Institute of Living now head departments of psychiatry in universities and institutions throughout the country. A 1930 graduate of Jefferson Medi- cal University, Dr. Braceland was the former president of the Ameri- can Psychiatric Association, the As- sociation for Research in Nervous and Mental Diseases, and the Ameri- can Board of Psychiatry and Neu- rology. He was past vice president of the World Psychiatric Association. He was editor of American Journal of Psychiatry and was the author of three books and more than 300 schol- arly and professional papers. Of his many jobs, Dr. Braceland once said, only a few were dis- tasteful. He disliked rejecting manu- scripts submitted to the AJP and would return them saying. \"Your article is good and original. The trouble is that the part that is good is not original and the part that is original is not good.\" Dr. Braceland was the recipient of 12 honorary degrees — including a doctor of science degree conferred by La Salle University in 1941, as well as the Laetare Medal, the oldest award given annually to an outstand- ing American Catholic layman by the University of Notre Dame. He was named a Knight of St. Gregory the Great by Pope Pius XII in 1951. He also enjoyed the distinction of being the only La Salle alumnus to have received the two highest awards con- ferred by his university — the honor- ary degree and the Signum Fidei Medal in 1955, given by the Alumni Association for noteworthy contribu- tions to the advancement of human- itarian principles in keeping with Christian tradition. Dr. Braceland served as a member of La Salle University's Board of Trustees for 10 years before retiring in 1978. He remained very close to his alma mater throughout his pro- fessional career and often men- tioned how \"impressed\" he was with the dedication and devotion of the Christian Brothers and with the wis- dom of his teachers. \"There is no doubt in mv mind that I would not have gotten through school had it not been for the Brothers,\" he once wrote. \"Their help was invaluable. I feel that under their influence I learned things which are of in- calculable value to me in my present work.\" Dr. Braceland also lectured at Harvard University, served as clinical professor of psychiatry at Yale University, and as a medical visitor to the Duke University School of Medicine. In rare moments of leisure, he spent his time reading English literature with emphasis on the work of 19th century authors. \"If I weren't in medicine, I'd be teach- ing literature,\" he once said. Calling himself \"sentimentally inclined toward poetry and music,\" he added that he was \"organically incapable\" of either. Although his achievements as a physician, an educator, and naval of- ficer will long be a legendary part of the psychiatric profession, Dr. Braceland will also be remembered fondly by his many friends and as- sociates for his warmth, and his wit, and his charm. When he retired as editor of the American Journal of Psychiatry he wrote as part of his farewell message: \"There are three things said about men in this age group. One that your memory plays tricks on you. I forget the other two.\" Writing a few years ago in La Salle, he offered a brilliantly humor- ous insight into the psyche of a per- son anticipating what probably would be his last quarter-century. Said he: \". . . I've passed another hurdle. I'm 75 and I'm starting on the last quarter. This time they tell me that when the coach takes you out, they don't bench you, they plant you. As a precaution, therefore, when I put an envelope in the Sunday col- lection basket now, it is not a con- tribution— it's an investment. I'm anxious, of course, to end up in heaven, but I'm holding back waiting for a lower entrance require- ment. . . . Anyhow, my birthday cake looks like the Towering Inferno.\" He is survived by his wife, Hope, and two grown children, Mrs. Mary Faith Kerrigan and John Michael. A retired Rear Admiral in the Navy Reserve, Dr. Braceland was buried with full military honors at Arlington National Cemetery on March 5. —Robert S.

Nine class reunions, special workshops, a golf-outing and the induction of two of La Salle's super athletes — including the first woman — into the Alumni Hall of Athletes will be included in the activities of the annual Alumni Homecoming Weekend, May 17-18. On Friday, May 17 there will be a computer seminar offered on campus for interested alumni. The $10.00 registration fee in- cludes four sessions: computer literacy, word processing, spread sheets and statistics. The golf-outing will be held on Friday, the 17th, at Lu Lu Coun- try Club on Limekiln Pike in North Hills, Pa., the site of the outing two years ago. Greens fees, locker and cart for two are included in the $30.00 charge for the day. Starting times are avail- able through the Alumni Office (951-1535). The Hall of Athletes dinner will follow that evening at Lu Lu at 7:00 p.m. ($30.00 per person). Michael Brooks and Diane Moyer, both of the Class of '80, will be honored by induction into the Hall. The combination charge for golf and dinner is $55.00 per person. The highest scorer in Explorer basketball history with 2628 points, Brooks was a consensus All America player in his senior year. He received the prestigious Kodak award as the outstanding player in America in 1980. Michael had participated in the Pan-American games in 1979 and was chosen for the 1980 Olympic Team, but was disappointed when President Carter withdrew the U.S. from competition in the Moscow games that year over the Soviet Union's invasion of Af- ghanistan. Michael is a member of the Los Angeles Clippers, of the N.B.A., but has been side- lined for the past year with a leg injury. Also disappointed by her in- ability to compete in the 1980 games was All-America goalie Diane Moyer, whose outstanding play made her an early selection for the women's Olympic field hockey team. Diane, who dis- played her versatility by winning letters in Softball, basketball and diving as well as field hockey, continued her involvement in field hockey, made the 1984 team and won a bronze medal at the Olympic Games in Los Angeles. She is now coaching the sport at Yale University. Diane becomes the first woman athlete to be in- ducted into the Hall of Athletes.

Opened in the Fall of '83, this latter facility enabled us for the first time to conduct ten class reunions on the same evening last year and the largest group of alumni and guests in our history (653) celebrated fifth through fif- tieth anniversaries. After dinner the classes will continue their reunion parties at various locations where dance music of their particular eras will be provided by disc jockeys. This year the Class of '35 will take part in the Baccalaureate Mass at the Cathedral of Saints Peter and Paul on the previous Saturday, May 11, and will meet for a luncheon at the Four Seasons Hotel across from the Cathedral at 1:00 p.m. Dormitory Rooms again will be available for alumni and spouses on Friday and/or Saturday nights at moderate charges.
