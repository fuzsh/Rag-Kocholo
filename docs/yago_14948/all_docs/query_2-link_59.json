        "text": "Rodri predicted Phil Foden could go on to become England's greatest-ever player after he was crowned PFA Players' Player of the Year for the 2023-24 season on Tuesday.\n\nFoden added the top men's PFA prize to the Premier League Player of the Season award he won in May, having inspired Manchester City to their fourth straight league title last term.\n\nHe scored 19 league goals and added eight assists in 2023-24, including vital hat-tricks against Brentford and Aston Villa and a stunning final-day strike versus West Ham.\n\nRodri was also considered among the contenders for the PFA prize after going unbeaten through all 34 of his Premier League appearances last season (27 wins, seven draws), but the Spaniard believes his team-mate was a worthy victor.\n\n\"I'm so, so happy about Phil. To be honest he's a very good kid, a very shy kid. For me, he has the ability to be the best English player in history when he finishes his career,\" Rodri said at Tuesday's award ceremony.\n\n\"He needs to keep the level up in his game, already he's one of the best players in the league and in Europe.\n\n\"I think he could get even better. The quality, ambition and hard work he has every day listening to old people like me is very important.\n\n\"He was outstanding last season and it's the first season I saw him carrying the team on his back.\"\n\nFoden is the first Englishman to win the PFA Player's Player of the Year award since Wayne Rooney in 2010, and the first to do so in the same year as winning the Premier League title since John Terry in 2005.\n\nGolden Boot winner Erling Haaland, who joined Rodri and Foden in being voted into the PFA Premier League Team of the Year, was also effusive in his praise for the England man.\n\n\"He's a great guy, I really enjoy playing with him and joking with him,\" Haaland said.\n\n\"Phil is unbelievable, some of the stuff he does in training that no one sees is also incredible, I'm lucky to play with him.\"\n\nJuventus have revealed midfielder Khephren Thuram and winger Timothy Weah both suffered hamstring injuries in their season-opening victory over Como in Serie A.\n\nJuve began their first campaign under former Bologna coach Thiago Motta with a 3-0 win over Cesc Fabregas' newly promoted side in Turin.\n\nForward Samuel Mbangula put the Bianconeri ahead with a fine solo goal before Weah blasted home off the underside of the crossbar to make it 2-0 shortly before half-time.\n\nHowever, the United States wideman was substituted at the break after appearing to suffer a hamstring strain, while Thuram – signed from Nice last month – was also withdrawn before Andrea Cambiaso added a late third.\n\nThe Italian giants have now confirmed both players sustained hamstring issues and will be reassessed in around 10 days, ruling them out of Monday's trip to Verona and potentially the September 1 clash with Roma.\n\n\"Following muscular problems suffered during last night's match, Khephren Thuram and Timothy Weah underwent diagnostic tests this morning at the J Medical Centre,\" a club statement said.\n\n\"They revealed for the former a low-grade hamstring injury in his left thigh and for the latter a low-grade hamstring injury in his right thigh.\n\n\"New examinations are scheduled for both players in approximately 10 days' time.\"\n\nJonathan David and Edon Zhegrova again came up with potentially pivotal goals to put Lille in control of their Champions League play-off tie against Slavia Praha on Tuesday.\n\nBoth David and Zhegrova had netted against Fenerbahce in the previous round, with the Canada forward's extra-time penalty eliminating Jose Mourinho's men, and the pair were on target once more in a 2-0 win at Valenciennes' Stade du Hainaut.\n\nIt initially looked as though this might not be David's night, with last season's 19-goal Ligue 1 star passing up two very presentable openings in the first half.\n\nDavid would have been particularly disappointed with the second of those, firing over after Zhegrova's effort was blocked by Antonin Kinsky, but he made amends in the 52nd minute when a first-time finish from a Hakon Haraldsson pass crept past the goalkeeper into the bottom-right corner.\n\nThe scorer of the first turned provider for the second, albeit David's flick to Zhegrova left the winger with plenty to do as he shimmied into the box and calmly shot beyond Kinsky.\n\nIt was not all one-way traffic in the second period as Slavia twice had the ball in the net, but Igoh Ogbu's scrambled goal shortly after the opener was struck off for handball, then substitute Mojmír Chytil's response to Zhegrova's dazzling second was ruled out for offside.\n\nData Debrief: Slavia slowed\n\nLille have the stronger team on paper, but Slavia had form on their side, unbeaten in 14 matches, with seven of those coming since the start of their domestic season last month. The Czech side had won their previous six games.\n\nUltimately, however, Lille's quality told – particularly in the case of Zhegrova.\n\nHe accounted for six of Lille's 16 shots and three of seven on target, also creating two chances as he was eventually rewarded for his endeavour with a 77th-minute strike.\n\nSlavia will hope to recover their momentum in the return match in Czechia next Wednesday, with hopes of a place in the Champions League's new league phase waning."
