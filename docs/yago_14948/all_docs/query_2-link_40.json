        "text": "Dr. Robert R. Conte, \"Bob,\" 88, of Cranberry Township, formerly of Greensburg, PA, passed away April 3, 2024, peacefully surrounded by his six loving children at the Oak Grove Center, Sherwood Oaks, Cranberry Township. He was born Oct. 27, 1935, in Pittsburgh, PA, son of the late Frank and Linda Conte. Bob graduated from Pittsburgh Central Catholic High School. He then attended Washington and Jefferson College. Upon graduation, he went to Jefferson Medical School in Philadelphia, PA. It was during his second year of Medical School that he married the love of his life, Jean Mulvihill, in 1959. Upon graduation from Medical School, he became a captain in the United States Army and was stationed in Tacoma, Washington. Following his service in the military, he returned to the Pittsburgh area to pursue his residency at Magee Women's Hospital. In 1967, Bob and Jean moved to Greensburg, PA to raise their growing family. Bob began his OB/GYN practice in Latrobe, PA and was a physician at Latrobe Area Hospital, where he delivered countless babies during his career. Bob was steadfast in his loving devotion to Jean, his children, and grandchildren. He was known for his unique combination of being an excellent clinician, balanced with a bedside manner that his patients loved and cherished. He treasured spending time with his family and 17 grandchildren. His hobbies were gardening, flyfishing, and woodworking, which included building grandfather clocks that he proudly gifted to family and friends. He was also a longtime Steelers fan and spent many Sundays among friends cheering on his beloved team. Bob was a student of his faith in constant pursuit of a deeper understanding of Catholicism. He lived this legacy of faith every day and was an example to his children and grandchildren. There was nothing more precious to Bob than the sanctity of human life. Through his professional calling, he brought life into this world fulfilling God's work through his hands. Over the course of his career, he facilitated the private adoptions of numerous babies into the arms of loving parents. Bob was preceded in death by his parents, Frank and Linda; his wife, Jean, of 64 years; his sister-in-law, MaryAnn; and several other extended family members. Bob is survived by his six loving children, Gary Conte (Susan), Lisa Barngrover (Mark), Gregory Conte (Debra), Lori McStravick, Donna Biss (Joe) and Diana Rigby (Jim); 17 grandchildren, Tessa (Tyler), Natalia, Nick, Alex, Zac (Hannah), Jackson, Olivia, Adriana, Ava, Luke, Brenna, Lily, Connor, Maggie, Will, Dean and Mitchell; two great grandchildren, Savannah and Grayson; his beloved sister, Angela Conte; his brothers, Frank Conte and James Conte (Katie), and countless friends. Relatives and friends are invited to gather in the Our Lady of Grace Church, 1011 Mt. Pleasant Road, Greensburg, from noon to 1:30 p.m. Monday. Bob's funeral Mass will be celebrated at 1:30 p.m. in the Church. Entombment will follow in Mary, Mother of Mercy Mausoleum at St. Vincent, Latrobe.
