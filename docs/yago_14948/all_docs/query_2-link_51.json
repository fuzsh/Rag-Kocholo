        "text": "A comprehensive counseling system is what all schools need. In turn, administrators need to support their counseling departments as systems that integrate academic, social emotional, and personal interest into the everyday experience of students. Our counseling department is doing just that! Check out this short video below on the system we are using at Whitman-Hanson Regional High School to assist students in planning for their post-high school experience.\n\nOur Counseling Department is focused on making sure students are better prepared for any future by assisting them in discovering their interests and the careers with which they match. As I like to say, it isn't about college and career readiness; its about career readiness. Some careers require college while some require other training. The important point is that our counseling department works hard to ensure students are ready for and understanding of the path best suited for their success.\n\nDue to the quality of our Counseling Department, I am lucky enough to have been asked to represent Whitman-Hanson Regional High School by sitting on a panel discussion with the Massachusetts Commissioner of Education (Jeff Riley) about the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education's role in getting other schools across the state to implement this program.\n\nCommon App Thursdays – During the month of October, counselors will be available every Thursday on a drop in basis during the school day to provide help with the Common Application. Any seniors needing assistance with their Common Apps are welcome to stop by School Counseling Office during Academic Seminar or Lunch. If you need help after school, please check in with your counselor to make a plan.\n\nAP Exam Registration Deadline\n\nStudents enrolled in AP (Advanced Placement) classes who will be taking AP exams in May are reminded that AP exam registration forms and exam fees ($94 per exam) are due on October 15. Students that receive free or reduced priced lunch are eligible for a reduced exam fee of $40 per exam. Information on payment plans can be found on the AP Exam Registration Forms that were sent home with students enrolled in AP classes earlier in the month. If you have any questions, please contact Mrs. Carrigan at Ruth.Carrigan@whrsd.org\n\nPSAT Administration – The PSAT will be administered to all students in grade 10 and 11 during the school day on Wednesday, October 16th. The PSAT/NMSQT assesses the critical reading, mathematics, and writing skills students need for college and beyond. The PSAT is a great practice for the SAT and will help determine college and career readiness of students.\n\nCredit for Life Fair - - The Credit for Life Reality Fair will be held for members of the senior class on October 16 during the school day. The Credit for Life Fair is a nationally recognized program designed to help high school students develop personal financial management skills that they will use throughout their lives.\n\nGetting Ready for College - Early College Planning - Our annual Getting Ready for College - Early College Planning workshop will be held in the PAC from 6:30 - 8:00 PM on Thursday, October 24th. This program is geared toward grade 9 and 10 students and parents and will cover Mass State College/University Admissions Standards, making the most of the high school experience, choosing classes to enhance the college application, Naviance Family Connection for college and career planning, and college admissions and services for students with disabilities.\n\n​\n\nFAFSA Workshop for Seniors and Parents - Senior parents that would like assistance filling out the FAFSA (Free Application for Federal Student Aid) are invited to attend our FAFSA Workshop on October 30 at 5 PM. Parents attending will work in WH computer labs to complete their FAFSA applications with the help of representatives from American Student Assistance. Space is limited and pre-registration is necessary. Please follow this link to sign up for the program: https://forms.gle/rYvHYP64XJZSfL9j9\n\nIf you have any questions, please reach out to your child’s school counselor. Have a wonderful week!\n\nToo Sick For School ?\n\nSometimes it is a tough call as to when your child should stay home, so here are a few guidelines to help you make the decision whether or not you should keep your child home. We realize that many of you work outside the home and it is sometimes difficult to keep your child home. However keeping children at home when they are sick makes a tremendous difference in preventing the spread of illnesses throughout the classroom.\n\nFever:\n\nFevers are generally signs of infection. Your child’s temperature should be less than 100 degrees for 24 hours, without the use of fever reducing medications such as Tylenol or Motrin, before they can return to school. While your child is at home, encourage them to drink plenty of fluids and get rest, which will allow them to recover from their illness.\n\nStomach Ache, Vomiting, Diarrhea:\n\nA child with vomiting and or diarrhea should be kept at home until their symptoms have resolved for approximately 12 hours, and the child has demonstrated they can keep food and liquids down.\n\nCold Symptoms, Cough, Sore Throat :\n\nYour child may attend school if their symptoms are not associated with a fever. They should also be free from significant discomfort from their cold symptoms so they are able to participate in their schoolwork. If your child has symptoms of a persistent cough or thick, yellow/ green nasal discharge that lasts longer than a week or he/ she complains of an earache, you should consult your Doctor for possible treatment. If your child has been diagnosed with Strep throat, they may return to school after being on antibiotics for 24 hours to assure that their infection will not be contagious to others.\n\nRed Eye:\n\nRed, irritated, itchy eyes with drainage could be caused by a bacterial infection, allergies, or a virus. If the white part of the eye appears red and produces a yellow or green crusty discharge with matted lashes, your child may have conjunctivitis. Conjunctivitis or “pink eye”, as it is commonly referred, is a contagious infection, which needs to be treated by a Doctor. Your child may return to school after 24 hours of prescribed treatment.\n\nAbsences:\n\nPlease call the sick line when your child is going to be absent. Send in any physician notes when your child is seen by his/her MD. If your child is out for 5 consecutive days, they must return with a physician note clearing them to return to school.\n\nAssistive Devices:\n\nIn the school setting assistive devices are casts, crutches, orthopedic related boot and braces, wheelchairs, etc. Any student needing to utilize an assistive devise must have supporting physician documentation for such.\n\nDental:\n\nAny student returning to school after a dentist or orthodontic appointment where a local anesthesia, numbing medication is used must have physician documentation to return to school.\n\nMedication Administration:\n\nAny student requiring medication to be administered at school by the school nurse must have written physician documentation and signed parent consent. Please note that students are not permitted to transport medication to/from school per the Whitman-Hanson Regional School District Policy, therefore an adult must deliver the medication to the school nurse. Please deliver the medication to the school nurse in a pharmacy or manufacturer labeled container, bottle or box. Please ask your pharmacy to provide a separate container/bottle/inhaler/epi-pen/diastat for school and home. No more than a thirty day supply of the medication should be delivered to the school.\n\nIf you are called to pick up your child because of illness, he/she must be picked up swiftly. Please be sure that Infinite Campus has the most recent up-to-date emergency contact information, so that we have someone who can act on your behalf, if we are unable to reach you. This person should live locally.\n\nThank you in advance for helping us ALL stay healthy!\n\nWHRH School Nurses:\n\nMargaret and Kathy\n\nThe football team made it two straight wins with a dominating 35-14 win over Plymouth North. Nick Dolan had a huge game with a 40 yard td run and a blocked punt for another td. Will Stafford had 101 yards rushing on 8 carries and Jason Murphy threw two touchdown passes to Colby Garden. The defense lead by Joe McStravick and Hunter Baker stifled Plymouth North. The team is back in action Friday night at Marshfield.\n\nThe volleyball team is closing in on a post season berth as the team improved to 8-4 with a 3-0 win over Hanover. Junior Delaney Rowell led the team in kills with 7. Not too far behind Rowell was sophomore Abby Martin with 4 kills. Senior Brooke Beauregard continues to step up to the plate as libero with an impressive 15 digs and 1 kill. The girls are back in action on Monday when the face Marshfield.\n\nThe Whitman Hanson girls’ soccer team battled back from a 2-0 deficit Friday to tie Patriot league opponent Hanover. Hanover took a 2-0 lead early in the second half. The Panthers kept pressing and with about 9 minutes remaining Kelsey Wozniak took an Alexis Billings cross and snuck it into the corner. Billings then served a driven corner to the head of Erin Wood for the tying goal with about 5 minutes remaining. Whitman Hanson continued the pressure but could not get the winner. Sam Perkins and Ava Melia had strong games in the Panther defense. The Panthers travel to Marshfield tomorrow.\n\nThe boys soccer team won 2 of 3 this week beating East Bridgewater 7-1 and Hanover 4-1. Friday the Panthers fell behind 1-0 at the half but then carried the play in the second scoring 4 unanswered goals. Sophomore Jacob Donovan scored first for W-H to tie it. Junior Joel Arsenault scored twice on his birthday and Brendan Nehiley added 2 assists. Senior captain Jason Brodeur added one goal and sophomores Alex Chichlowski and Adam Sousa added assists. W-H is 6-5-1 overall 4-5 in the Patriot League. The team is back in action tomorrow at home against Marshfield.\n\nThe field hockey team is playing great defense and hasn’t given up a goal in the last 2 games. Unfortunately the team didn’t score so both games finished in a scoreless tie. Maddie Savicke posted both shutouts as the Panthers improves to 2-5-4.\n\nIn a tri-meet at Hingham Tuesday afternoon Whitman-Hanson boys cross country (3-2) fell to Hingham 25-30 while winning over Pembroke 15-50. Junior Theo Kamperides finished first overall for the Panthers in a time of 16:09 over the 2.98 mile course. Also scoring for the Panthers were Sophomore Nathan Tassey (5th, 16:42), Senior Brandon Hager (7th, 16:54), Junior Liam Cafferty (8th, 17:06) and Senior Adam Solari (9th, 17:08.)\n\nOn the girls side, Sophomore Myah Kamperides finished 1st overall in a tri-meet at Hingham Tuesday afternoon. Kamperides covered the 2.98 Mile course in 19:47. But Hingham placed the next 9 runners to win 20-43. Whitman-Hanson (2-3) downed Pembroke 15-50. Also running well for the Panthers were Anna Flynn (21:06), Niki Kamperides (21:07), Bryn Miller (21:24) and Victoria Boss (21:48.)\n\nThe WH golf team hung close to the undefeated Hingham Harbormen last week but lost by just 1 stroke 224-225 to fall to 3-9 overall. This was the best team effort of the season by the Panthers led by Capt. Brian Fox with his match low 1 over 35 - this earned him his 2nd Tiger ball honor! As far as the rest of the team:\n\n* Jr Aidan Miller shot a 3 over 37\n\n* Capt Matt Korzec carded a 4 over 38\n\n* Capt Ian Brown turned in a 5 over 39\n\n* Jr Graham Stewart and Soph Pat McBroom both scored a 6 over 40\n\nDespite the loss, the team competed to the very last stroke against the Goliath of the league. The team travels to Plymouth North tomorrow."
