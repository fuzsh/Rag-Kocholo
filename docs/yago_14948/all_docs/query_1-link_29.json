        "text": "Accreditation\n\nYCESA and its affiliated schools (Yavapai County Juvenile Detention School and Yavapai County Accommodation District) is the first Arizona education service agency to earn a systems-wide accreditation by Cognia and to embark on its continuous improvement plan. This blue ribbon seal of approval is the result of a rigorous internal self-examination and a 4-day evaluation by a professional Cognia external review team. The power of accreditation is as a conduit to a successful continual improvement model, strategic planning, empowerment of staff, and thoughtful data-based dialogue and decision-making.\n\nAccessibility Statement\n\nAt the Yavapai County Education Service Agency, we strive to make our website accessible to the widest possible audience.
