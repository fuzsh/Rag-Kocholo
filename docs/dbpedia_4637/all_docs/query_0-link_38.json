INTRODUCTION ============================================================================= \"It's like I'm assisting suicide. Hate not me, hate your weakness!\" - Iori Yagami This is a System & Combo FAQ for Garou: Mark of the Wolves (which btw got Best DC Fighting Game on DC if you didn't already know!). I'm writing this because there is no good Combo FAQ for the game. The System part has been added because while all the new features of the game are very important, I haven't seen any guide that deals with those exclusively and as the author of 2 character guides for the game (Butt and Terry -- along with a Kain Infinites FAQ which has been removed now), I received a lot of mails from people requesting help on the Feint Moves and the rest. So, here I am, writing this big FAQ in the hope that upon reading this, players will realize how complex Garou is and they will stop punching buttons without even knowing what's going on. I am also giving descriptions of all the Super Moves and Potential Powers since they are another important aspect of the game. I highly recommend that you read James Kuroki's FAQ too as it contains full movelists for each character along with move descriptions and tons of stuff. Well, what originally intended to be a S & C FAQ turns into a full FAQ / Movelist. There are quite a few mistakes in the lists in Kuroki's FAQ (no offense to him of course) and so, I decided to work on my own lists. I have done my own translations in most cases except a few ones which I directly took from his FAQ -- this explains why our move names differ but that doesn't really matter, right? :) I've only put movelists though -- again, Kuroki's FAQ is great because it has descriptions for every move, something which I can't be bothered with (tight schedules...). Finally, keep in mind that all the info contained in this FAQ was verified with the Neo-Geo version of the game which is just the same as the Arcade version. It also applies to the Dreamcast version of course but just to get things clear, don't mail me stuff that can only be found in the DC version (like the art galleries and I know how some things were seriously messed up during the conversion) because I won't bother to add those. This FAQ is written with the assumption that you have played a SNK fighter before and that you are quite familiar with the terms associated to all fighting games. If, however, this is your first fighting game (and you did well to start with MOTW!), there are a lot of terms in this FAQ that you probably will not understand and which will only confuse you. Should this be the case, I advise you to read Andrew Park's (aka EX Andy) Beginner's Guide which can be found under The King of Fighters '97 listing at GameFAQs. Even though MOTW is a different series, the same terms apply and will help you fully understand my FAQ.

All commands assume that you are facing right. ============================================================================= III. FEINT MOVES ============================================================================= \"The object of war is not to die for your country, but to make the opposite son-of-bitches die for theirs!\" - George Patton Feint moves are not new but they have undergone some changes to make this feature even better. A feint move is the opening animation of a special move (specific to each character). However, your character will only perform the opening animation (can be any number of frames) and will even cry out in some cases but he/she will not perform the whole move. Instead, your recovery time will decrease such that you will have time to attack your opponent again without the latter being able to block since he's still himself recovering from your previous attack. In fact, the feint moves even enable you to perform normally impossible combos like a standing C onto a crouching C cancelled into a special move. In some situations, you even have the possibility to include more than one feint move in a combo for a lot of damage. Basically, you are just recovering faster than your opponent and thus have the advantage of an unblockable attack. This is the primary utility of the feint moves but they also have other uses. The one I've described above can be used both against CPU opponents and characters. Another use is to confuse your opponent since you'll trick them into thinking you are really going to perform the move. What happens is that he'll think that you will soon have to recover from the special move or another case is that he'll hope to counter you before being hit himself. You then only need to attack him since you don't have to recover from anything and he'll very likely drop his guard. There are only 2 commands for the feint moves, regardless of the character: f + AC, & d + AC. As I've explained above, here is the easiest combo you may pull with a feint move: stand C -> feint move -> crouch C -> special move This is only the easiest example. There are a lot of combos you can pull for each character and you can use any special moves you want, Super Moves and Potential Powers too. You may even go up to 3 feint moves with certain characters and under certain conditions like this example -- one of Terry's combos. stand C -> feint move -> stand C -> feint move -> hop -> crouch C In some cases, you may feint a move and perform a normal move but on hitting the opponent, that hit won't register as a combo. It happens that the hits don't add but it _is_ a combo, so give it what you've got. Although there are only the 2 commands listed, each feint move represents an existing move for that character. In some cases, one holds for either version of the same move while in others, each feint move is different, i.e. the first one may be a special move and the second one a P.Power. Here is the list for what the feint moves represent for each character: |¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿|¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿|¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿| | CHARACTER | f + AC | d + AC | |__________________|_________________________|__________________________| | | | | | Rock Howard | Shine Knuckle | Reppu Ken | | | (qcf,qcf + K) | (qcf + A) | |__________________|_________________________|__________________________| | | | | | Terry Bogard | Weak Burn Knuckle | Strong Burn Knuckle | | | (qcb + A) | (qcb + C) | |__________________|_________________________|__________________________| | | | | | Kim Dong Hwan | Weak Shiden Kyaku | Strong Shiden Kyaku | | | (qcf + B) | (qcf + D) | |__________________|_________________________|__________________________| | | | | | Kim Jae Hoon | Shakka Shuu | Hou'ou Kyaku | | | (qcf + P) | (qcf,qcf + K) | |__________________|_________________________|__________________________| | | | | | Hotaru Futaba | Hakki Shou | Sou-Shou Shin | | | (qcf + P) | (qcb + P) | |__________________|_________________________|__________________________| | | | | | Gato | Shin-Ga | Rai-Ga | | | (qcf + P) | (f,d,df + K) | |__________________|_________________________|__________________________| | | | | | Bonne Jenet | Many Many Torpedoes | Aurora | | | (qcf,qcf + P) | (qcf,qcf + K) | |__________________|_________________________|__________________________| | | | | | Marco Rodriguez | Haou Shoukou Ken | Kyokugen Ko Hou | | | (qcf,qcf + P) | (qcf,qcf + K) | |__________________|_________________________|__________________________| | | | | | Hokutomaru | Karakusa-Giri | Shuriken | | | (qcb + P) | (qcf + P) | |__________________|_________________________|__________________________| | | | | | Freeman | Full Blast | Phobia | | | (qcf,qcf + P) | (f,d,df + P) | |__________________|_________________________|__________________________| | | | | | Tizoc | Hercule's Throw | Daedalus Attack | | | (close, hcf + B) | (qcf,qcf + K) | |__________________|_________________________|__________________________| | | | | | Kevin Rian | Hell Rotor | Hell Arrest | | | (qcb + P) | (close, hcf + P) | |__________________|_________________________|__________________________| | | | | | Grant | Kokuen-Ryuu | Majin Haten Dan | | | (qcb + P) | (qcf,qcf + P) | |__________________|_________________________|__________________________| | | | | | Kain | Schwarzer Panzer | Himmlisher Atem | | | (charge b,f + K) | (qcf,qcf + P) | |__________________|_________________________|__________________________| ============================================================================= IV. JUST DEFENSE ============================================================================= \"We seek the meaning of life because we are mortal.\" - Philosopher Minu This is another new feature in the game and, without doubt, the best and most important one. Just Defense occurs when you defend a move at the last second. As you do so, the words \"JUST DEFENDED\" will flash across the screen and if you play close attention, you'll notice how your character will have a new blocking pose where he'll seem to be repelling the attack with his bare hands. In fact, this is to enable Guard Cancel which is one of the advantages of Just Defense. Just Defense is, I'll say it again, one of the most important aspects of the game and this alone can decide the outcome of a match. Firstly, for each time you Just Defend a move, you'll recover some life. And this is made sweeter by the fact that you actually have the possibility to Just Defend multiple times against moves that cause multiple hits. That is, you can Just Defense Terry's Power Charge on the first hit and if you remain blocking for the other hits, you'll have performed it once and will gain back some life. However, if you are skilled enough to release the direction between each hit to press it again so as to achieve Just Defense 3 times in all, you'll have gained even more life back. In fact, most anti-air moves like the Rai-Ga and the Rising Tackle can be avoided this way as it is impossible to block such moves. You don't have the ability to block while you're in the air, this isn't MvC fOO!. So, it is essential to become familiar with the option. The amount of life you gain depends on the nature of the move and also how damaging the move is. For instance, you'll gain much more life back from a Just Defended Power Geyser than from a mere Power Wave. As you can see, anything can be Just Defended. The last advantage is that Just Defense gives you the ability to Guard Cancel out of it such that you'll recover before the opponent and thus attack them. This explains the weird stance of your character as he performs it. Once you have Just Defendeded a move, you can quickly counter-attack the surprised opponent with your most damaging combo. All you need to do is to perform whatever motion you intend while your character is still in the Just Defense stance and it'll come out more quickly. (Refer to subsection for more info on Guard Cancel). It is essential to master Just Defense or, at least, to become familiar with it because you'll need it a lot at the higher levels of MOTW. Some opponents take a lot of time to pull out their moves and if you have mastered the option, you'll easily be able to protect yourself while dealing damage at the same time. And vets will know that Kain can be easily defeated this way... :) --- GUARD CANCELLING -------------------------------------------------------- I have received a few e-mails requesting help on Guard c+Cancelling, so I'll try to give concise notes on it in this subsection. Guard Cancelling can only be achieved during a Just Defend. The name of the feature itself is relatively easy to figure out; it's jusr as if you were blocking and you then cancelled that block into a move. As you Just Defend any move, your character takes a blocking position but if you pay close attention, you'll notice how he/she seems ready to attack at the same time (okay, I know this doesn't make any sense but you've got to see it to understand :)). This is when you need to input the command of a special/super move and the latter will be a Guard Cancel. You need to be quite quick with the command and this isn't as easy as it sounds. Don't worry though, it becomes easy once you get the timing. When done right, the words 'GUARD CANCEL' will appear on the screen. The advantage of Guard Cancel is that it takes your opponent before he can block and thus, it's a sure hit. Anyway, if you're good at Just Defending close attacks, you would be wise to spend some time getting familiar with Guard Cancelling. It will be of a tremendous help and will allow you to win in close situations. (Note: For those familiar with Strret Fighter III: Third Strike, Guard Cancelling is just like Parry. After all, MOTW is SNK's response to SFIII.) ============================================================================= V. MOVELIST ============================================================================= \"Only a fool trusts his life to a weapon!\" - Gray Fox/Cyborg Ninja =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= Basically, this is a rewrite of Kuroki's FAQ because there are some quite important mistakes in it. All the credit goes to him for most move names since they aren't on SNK's page anymore. (But I changed some names though -- own knowledge.) =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= The movelist for each character is seperated like this: |------------- [Throws] ------------| |--------- [Command moves] ---------| -> Some chars. don't have command moves. |--------- [Special Moves] ---------| |---------- [Super Moves]-----------| |------- [Potential Powers] --------| (BR) next to special move indicates that it is a break move. (BR -- X) means that only a certain version of the move is a break; obviously, it will be either A / C or B / D. T.O.P. Attacks have been left out since I've spent a seperate section on those with all descriptions. Feint Moves are also in their own section. Quick notation: --------------- dir. : press the listed direction qcf : roll the joystick from d to f (d, df, f) qcb : roll the joystick from d to b (d, db, d) hcf : roll the joystick from b to f (b, db, d, df, f) hcb : roll the joystick from f to b (f, df, d, db, b) charge : hold listed direction for 2 seconds 360¿ : rotate joystick clockwise once 720¿ : rotate joystick clockwise twice P : press A or C K : press B or D (air) : ground move can be performed in air too hold : hold button to delay the move empower : hold down button to make move become more powerful / : either command or button can be used ?-? : indicates that the range between the first move and the second move may be used (eg. b-f means any direction among b,db,d,df and d can be used) -- range always anticlockwise * : indicates that move is a follow-up (the move cannot be pulled alone) Sources for move names and lists: --------------------------------- * James Kuroki's MOTW FAQ * My KOF 2001 FAQ +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ ROCK HOWARD +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ |--------------------------------- [Throws] --------------------------------| Koku Sen close to opponent, f / b + C |------------------------------ [Special Moves] ----------------------------| Reppu Ken qcf + A Double Reppu Ken qcf + C Hard Edge qcb + P Rising Tackle charge d,u + P Shinkuu Nage (BR) close to opponent, 360¿ + C Rassetsu* after breaking Shinkuu Nage, hold AB and release to perform Crack Counter Jou-Dan qcf + B Crack Counter Ge-Dan qcf + D Rage Run \"Dunk\" qcb + B Rage Run \"Shift\" qcb + D |------------------------------- [Super Moves] -----------------------------| Raging Storm qcf,qcf + A Shine Knuckle qcf,qcf + B |----------------------------- [Potential Powers] --------------------------| Raging Storm qcf,qcf + C Shine Knuckle qcf,qcf + D Deadly Rave \"Neo\" hcb,f + A, A, A, B, B, C, C, D, D, qcb + C +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ TERRY BOGARD +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ |--------------------------------- [Throws] --------------------------------| Buster Throw close to opponent, f / b + C |------------------------------ [Special Moves] ----------------------------| Power Wave qcf + P Burn Knuckle qcb + P Power Charge f,f + P (x3) Crack Shoot qcb + K Power Dunk (BR) f,d,df + K |------------------------------- [Super Moves] -----------------------------| Power Geyser qcf,qcf + A Buster Wolf qcf,qcf + B |----------------------------- [Potential Powers] --------------------------| Power Geyser qcf,qcf + C Buster Wolf qcf,qcf + D +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ KIM DONG HWAN +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ |--------------------------------- [Throws] --------------------------------| Tai-otoshi close to opponent, f / b + C Tai-hineri in air and close to opponent, any dir. except u + C |------------------------------ [Command Moves] ----------------------------| Big Jump d, ub-uf Sankaku-tobi in air and near corner, opposite dir.

============================================================================= VI. BREAK MOVES ============================================================================= \"Sorry, mister! You see, I'm strong!\" - Rai As you may have seen in the movelist section, some moves have been marked with (BR) and these have been referred to as Break Moves in the key. Break moves involves stopping some special moves before they stop by themselves and following with another attack if you want. This is achieved by pressing AB during the move and as you do so, your character will stop the motion and will recover faster. The break moves are another important aspect that is essential in beating the game and in mastering your favorite character. If you pull your breakable move and it's blocked, you can thus stop it and will recover faster. This will make it harder for the opponent to hit you as you'll be able to block his attack. Thus, you won't be so easily punished. Of course, you need to remember that only a couple of moves are breakable for each character. Another advantage is that if that move connects, you can break it and follow with another move, even Super Moves or P. Potentials. Breaking gives way to more damaging combos involving more moves and is thus very important. As you can see, you'll need to be able to break the moves quickly to take advantage of it and add more hits or simply to recover faster if your attack is blocked. Below is the list of the breakable moves for each character: |¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿|¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿| | CHARACTER | BREAKABLE MOVES | |_________________________|___________________________________| | | | | Rock Howard | Shinkuu Nage (close, 360¿ + C) | |_________________________|___________________________________| | | | | Terry Bogard | Power Dunk (f,d,df + K) | |_________________________|___________________________________| | | | | Kim Dong Hwan | KuuSaJin (f,d,df + P) | |_________________________|___________________________________| | | | | Kim Jae Hoon | Hien Zan (charge d,u + K) | |_________________________|___________________________________| | | | | Hotaru Futaba | Ko-bi Kyaku (qcb + K) | |_________________________|___________________________________| | | | | Gato | Rai-Ga (f,d,df + K) | |_________________________|___________________________________| | | | | Bonne Jenet | The Hind (qcf + K) | |_________________________|___________________________________| | | | | Marco Rodriguez | Kohou (f,d,df + P) | |_________________________|___________________________________| | | | | Hokutomaru | Kuuha Dan (qcf + K) | |_________________________|___________________________________| | | | | Freeman | Morbid Angel (hcf + K) | |_________________________|___________________________________| | | | | Tizoc | Strong Olympus Over (qcb + D) | | | Strong Poseidon Wave (b,d,db + C) | |_________________________|___________________________________| | | | | Kevin Rian | Hell Trap (qcf + K) | |_________________________|___________________________________| | | | | Grant | Kyou Chou-Jin (f,d,df + P) | |_________________________|___________________________________| | | | | Kain | Schwarze Lanze (charge d,u + K) | |_________________________|___________________________________| ============================================================================= VII. T.O.P. SYSTEM ============================================================================= \"You mess with BORO, you get SORRO\" - BORO T.O.P. stands for Tactical Offensive Position. Before the first match when the character pics pop up, your lifebar will appear along with a white bar. As you will then see, this causes your lifebar to de divided into 3 distinct parts. These are the beginning, middle and end parts. You now have to choose where you'll set the T.O.P. in one of those 3 places. The choice is actually up to you since each player may find it more useful in a certain part (I, myself, always place T.O.P. in the beginning part since I can use it to get Miracle wins). After having placed the T.O.P. gauge, you will logically fight. Once your lifebar reaches that part which is in the orange (thus T.O.P.) section, your character will start to flash as the words \"T.O.P. IN!\" appear. As long as your remain in the T.O.P. area (i.e. your character remains flashing), you'll be able to benefit from certain advantages. Firstly, you'll be able to use your T.O.P. attack. Each character has a different T.O.P. attack although the command is the same regardless of the fighter, i.e. CD. Your T.O.P. attacks can be used in combos for certain characters and in general, these are very useful. You will also recover some life slowly when you are not hit. The life gained is quite small but very helpful since you'll have recovered some substantial life back if you're not hit for a long time. A great thing to do is to Just Defense all your opponent's moves while in T.O.P., this is a great way to get SS+ wins. Also, while you are in T.O.P., your offensive power increases similar to the Counter Mode in KOF. All your attacks will be more powerful and you will thus have a great advantage as it will also enable you to cause guard crush on your opponent if you're playing aggressively. As you can see, T.O.P. is yet another important aspect of the game. Your character returns to normal once his lifebar falls out of the T.O.P. range after he's hit. Now, I'll move on to describing the T.O.P. Attack of each character. ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ Rock Howard ¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿ Overhead Kick Just like the name! Rock will do a cross-up and kick the opponent from high up. Of course, it isn't always a cross-up but that's how you should use it as it will enable you to then take your opponent by surprise. The Overhead Kick is a bit slow to come out and cannot be comboed. Moreover, the recovery time is lame and if it misses, you'll be open for anything. The Overhead Kick shouldn't be used often because it can get pretty predictable since the range is always the same. Actually, just use it a couple of time to cross-up and to fool the opponent. ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ Terry Bogard ¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿ Max Dunk Terry will ram into the opponent with his shoulder (the animation is like a low Power Charge) and will then continue with a 2-hit Power Dunk. The first attack needs to connect for Terry to do the whole move. Otherwise, he'll stop at the first hit and in this case, watch out for the recovery which is very lame! If the whole move is blocked, be even more afraid because the recovery is even bigger. The Max Dunk is quite powerful too and comboable. However, it is slow to come out and Terry can be easily thrown out during the first frames. So, use it exclusively in combos -- jump D -> stand C -> Max Dunk is very damaging and a sure winner! ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ Kim Dong Hwan ¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿ Kaiten Dong Hwan Dong Hwan will kick the opponent high once and will follow with a spinning attack. The whole move hit 5 times and is powerful enough. The Kaiten Dong Hwan is quite quick to come out but a well-timed projectile will easily stop him in his tracks and if you're unlucky enough, you'll be open for anything afterwards. It also has a nice recovery but if it misses against a close opponent, that won't change anything since Dong Hwan still needs to get up after charging forward like a mad bull. Comboable and you would be wise to take advantage of this instead of using it like a stupid masher. ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ Kim Jae Hoon ¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿ High-Angle Neri Chagi Jae Hoon will lift his foot up before bringing it down for an axe kick. The fact that he needs to turn around, raise his foot and turn towards the opponent to strike down again makes the High-Angle Neri-Chagi a sloooooooow move. However, the very good thing is that his T.O.P. attack has no lag whatsoever and it is amazing at causing guard crush. Since it is so slow to come out, there's no point in wondering whether it is comboable...There are drawbacks to using the High-Angle Neri-Chagi but if you are careful enough and time it well, pull it 3 or 4 times and you'll earn a helpful guard crush. Otherwise, I don't recommend using this at all because, even if the recovery is sweet (although you will now tell me that there is no recovery, so what the hell am I talking about? :)), any opponent will hit you even before the move comes out. ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ Hotaru Futaba ¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿ Sen-Kai En Hotaru will flip in the air as she hits the opponent once with a sommersault kick. The Sen-Kei En is quick to come out but it has no forward range and you should pull it only when you are quite close to the opponent. It is also comboable but be warned that in some cases, the T.O.P. will miss because the normal move has pushed the opponent away. And since the recovery sucks, you will be punished for your mistake. Also, don't let its look fool you, the Sen-Kai is not a good anti-air. Okay, it may work from time to time, specially against those big and slow characters but otherwise, don't use it against air-borne opponents. It is very easy to crush and besides, the fact that Hotaru flips only vertically and doesn't move forward at all makes it too predictable. Another thing is that the jump isn't that good either. Use her T.O.P. in combos but even then, be careful. Want something better? Don't use it at all! ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ Gato ¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿ Mou-Ko Kou Hakan Gato steps forward and strikes once with his palm (a bit like Jet Li would do in \"The One\" -- great movie which you should see). The attack is insanely powerful but also extremely slow to come out. Gato really takes too much time to step forward and the palm comes out as if the whole of it is glued to his body! :( And I haven't even talked of the recovery yet...Which is, do I really need to tell you, lame. There are truthfully no situations where you can safely use the Mou-Ko Kou Hazan because anybody can throw you out of it. More simply, don't use it! ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ Bonne Jenet ¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿ Rolling Thunder Jenet will so a sommersault and if that hits, she'll do a thrust attack. The Rolling Thunder is quick to come out and can be used in combos to ensure that it connects. Note though that the first hit (during the sommersault) must connect for Jenet to do the whole move. If it is blocked or completely misses, she will fall back again and won't perform the diving kick. In both cases, the recovery is quite lame and you'll quite easily be punished. The Rolling Thunder has no forward range and this means that she can be knocked out but luckily, the speed of the move still makes that difficult (which is great!). It is also an excellent anti-air against agressive opponents. ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ Marco Rodriguez ¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿ Zanretsu-Ken Although Marco's T.O.P. attack holds the infamous name of the Zanretsu-Ken, it is not exactly the same as that of Ryo. Marco will still punch the opponent repeatedly but he does so only 9 times and he always ends with a quick uppercut. The move is a bit slow to come out but it is surprisingly comboable after a stand C which makes it useful in such situations. The recovery is a big problem though. If it is blocked, you will still be in a difficult situation because Marco takes some time before he can resume his fighting stance again and if the opponent manages to hop back as you pull it, you're in for some damage once he finishes. It is also quite easy to Just Defense it and to Guard Cancel into an attack, so you shouldn't use it alone. Use it in a combo all the time (or don't use it). ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ Hokutomaru ¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿ Nin-Pou Baku-En A very funny move! Hokutomaru places a scroll in his mouth (I suppose he eventually eats it too :)) and the ground suddenly explodes to enable him to fly towards the opponent, hitting the latter with his hand. This part of the animation seems to be a rip-off from Strider Hiryuu's flying pose and it's very funny. The motion is in a diagonal direction and this makes the Nin-Pou Bakuen Jump a good anti-air. But you need to time it well though since it starts before and if you mess up, you'll be counter when you land. Comboable after a close C/D but you need to cancel on the first hit of the strong punch. If you let both hits connect, the T.O.P. may not connect since tbe second hit makes Hokutomaru retreat a few steps. ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ Freeman ¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿ Overkill Freeman swings his hand forward as a red slash appears above his body. This slash will cause a grey spark to appear by the enemy if it hits. The Overkill is a bit slow to come out but it is still comboable. Otherwise, the recovery time sucks which is why I'd advise to use it only in combos since you can do so. The times Freeman takes to resume his fighting stance gives your opponent the time to use practically any combo. The Overkill is also a quite good anti-air but opponents may be able to predict where it will hit and thus jump such that you cannot hit them. It has good priority though and can win in some close situations thanks to its range. ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ Tizoc ¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿ Gri-Dro Super Kick Tizoc (or The Griffon Mask if you wish) clasps his feet together and performs a drop kick. He moves forward as he does so and this gives the Gri-Dro Super Kick a great range. It is, however, slow to come out but even then, it has good chances of connecting against an opponent who has just messed up. The cool thing about this T.O.P. is that, instead of falling like he should normalyl do, Tizoc ends up crouching and immediately gets up upon doing so. Basically, this means that the attack has no recovery. Rather surprising considering Tizco's build but hey, I'm not going to refuse such an advantage either! Very powerful attack too and causes guard crush easily but it's always better to use it from far. There is a risk you'll be hit out of it if you pull it close to the opponent since it's so slow to come out. A good trick is to do a standing C and then, immediately whiff it into the T.O.P. Grant's far C can be easily cancelled. When you first perform it, your opponent will think you will really pull one and is bound to attack you as his far C has a lame recovery. If you cancel the far C into the Gri-Dro Super Kick, the move comes out faster and will connect. Anyway, even if they have the time to pull their own move, your friggin' damaging T.O.P. attack will suck their move in, so why bother! :) ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ Kevin Rian ¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿ Blast Charge Kevin does a quick shoulder charge followed by a spin attack, hitting 3 times in all. The Blast Charge comes out quite quickly but has a lame recovery time. As it is, use it only in combos because otherwise, you run the risk of being punished by a combo-maniac like me! :) Quite useful at times and being one of the quickest T.O.P. attacks, you can rely on it against opponents who mess up with their own moves. Quite powerful attack too! ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ Grant ¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿ Majin Gan-En Grant charges forward with a sliding kick and if the kick connects against the opponent (hits or blocked), he'll continue with a shoulder attack and end with a strong punch. The Majin Gan-En is rather slow to come out and this isn't a surprise because it is a powerful T.O.P. Attack. The move has a very nice recovery and can be abused from time to time against less skilled opponents. The range during the charge is quite good too but makes the move useless against opponent who are more than half a screen away. A good way of ensuring the Majin Gan is to combo it after Grant's Gou Retsu-Shou (f,b,f + P) but you need to be quick to perform the T.O.P. for the latter to connect. ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ Kain ¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿ Schwarzer Stob Kain performs a Slash Kick which causes the opponent to be engulfed in his cool purple flames upon hitting. This T.O.P. is a bit slow to come out but still comboable. Use it in combos most of the time to avoid being hit back after the attack is blocked. The recovery too is slow as Kain needs to resume his stance and quicker opponents will have no trouble taking advantage of that. The move's animation is quick though. Kain will move forward very quickly and the Schwarzer Sto¿ has a nice range too and you can use it against some far off opponents and it can still hit. ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ============================================================================= VIII. SUPER MOVES ============================================================================= \"Resistance is futile. It will only make things more painful.\" - Odin This section deals with the Super Moves which require 1 S. Power. Your gauge is filled as you perform attacks and once it's full, you can use your Super Move. When you pull out such moves, the background turns black and the animation freezes for about 1 1/2 seconds. Each character has 2 Super Moves. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- ROCK HOWARD ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ Move name: Raging Storm Command: qcf,qcf + A Description: Rock will concentrate for a fraction of a second before unleashing all his energy in the form of a shield that goes upwards. The Raging Storm is rather slow to come out but it is great against an air-borne opponent although Rock can be hit as he is about to perform the move since there are no invincible frames in it. Thus, a quicker opponent will have no trouble attacking you during that time which means the Raging Storm is quite unreliable and you will be easily punished if you are not careful with it. It is not even comboable, which makes it even more useless against human opponents. ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ Move name: Shine Knuckle Command: qcf,qcf + B Description: Rock will dash toward the opponent as he does a move similar to Terry's Burn Knuckles but he will be surrounded by a gold wave instead and it has more range. However, although the Shine Knuckle causes Rock to dash forward a lot, note that it won't hit the opponent when there is a full screen distance between you two. Instead, he will stop just in front of the opponent without even hitting him once which means you can be punished if you perform the Shine Knuckle in such situations. Although the Shine Knuckle also doesn't have any invincibility time, it is extremely quick to come out and the move's speed makes that it'll take the opponent by surprise a lot of times. You can combo into it from a normal move like a stand C or even a counter special move if you're feeling naughty! Try to pull it just as the opponent is about to land to make all the hits connect because it is quite difficult to Just Defense it since it is so quick. ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- TERRY BOGARD ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ Move name: Power Geyser Command: qcf,qcf + A Description: Terry will punch the ground (which didn't do anything to him by the way) and as he does so, a wave of energy will rise. The Power Geyser is orignally meant to be an anti-air but of course, that doesn't mean you need to use it in such situations exlusively. Still, use it whenever you can as anti-air. It is rather slow to come out though and Terry does take some time to recover, so it is easy for the opponent to attack you after a missed Power Geyser. It is comboable after a normal move too although this is relatively hard to achieve iin some cases. ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ Move name: Buster Wolf Command: qcf,qcf + B Description: Terry will perform a Burn Knuckle wanna-be to dash forward and upon connect with the opponent, all hell will break loose as the Lonesome Wolf releases a burst of energy which will hit the poor opponent. The Buster Wolf is a much better Super Move than the Power Geyser because it is very quick to come out and it is extremely easy to include it in combos. It can even be used off a counter such that it will be impossible for the opponent to Just Defend and you will be able to deal a lot of damage. When you want to pull it alone, do so just as the opponent is about to land and time it to prevent him from defending. ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- KIM DONG HWAN ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ Move name: Super Dong Hwan Kyaku Command: in air, qcf,qcf + A Description: Dong Hwan will charge down at the opponent with a dive kick and will continue with a a series of kicks, taking the opponent up at the same time. The S. Power Super Dong Hwan Kyaku does 6 hits in all for some nice damage. Since it is an air move, it may seem useless but since this is Dong Hwan, that is no longer a problem. Simply wait until your opponent is unsure of his next move while you happen to be up and pull it. Chances that it'll connect will be quite high. Otherwise, don't use it anywhen because of the recovery and you don't want to know what may happen in thsi case... :) Actually, Dong Hwan recovers quite quickly from it but since the opponent will very likely be near you when you land since the trajectory is predictable, it doesn't make any difference. If you manage to connect it, you can follow up with certain moves because Dong Hwan lands well before the opponent. So, it can be very useful and enables damaging combos. ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ Move name: Raimei Dan Command: qcf,qcf + B Description: The Raimei Dan isn't really useful as one would expect. Its animation is quite similar to the Raimei Zan but it does only 1 (although more damaging, of course) hit. The opening frames have invincibility but beyond that, it isn't that hard to knock Dong Hwan out of it and so, you'd better be careful. It isn't comboable after normal moves which is a pity because alone, it is predictable and can be Just Defended. Actually, the best way of pulling it is to do the following combo: qcf + D -> Raimei Dan. By doing so, you are first sending the opponent up and you may then use the Raimei Dan to combo in. Timing is required but it's not that hard. ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- KIM JAE HOON ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ Move name: Hou-yoku Ten-Shou Kyaku Command: qcf,qcf + A Description: Jae Hoon will hop towards the enemy with a Hangetsu Zan (sorta) and will continue with several Hien Zan. He'll take the enemy up (logically!) before finishing them off with another Hien Zan. This Super Move does 7 hits and is comboable after a close normal move. The most important thing you need to know about the Hou-yoku Ten-shou Kyaku is that the hop covers a very small distance. You need to be close to the opponent to pull if or the move will miss and since Jae Hoon goes up, you can just imagine what will happen if this occurs. This is why I recommend to use it in combos (best one: close C -> qcf,qcf + A). Of course, just pull it quickly when the opponent messes up since it is very fast to come out and it has a high chance of connecting. The hop is an overhead and this make it even better as some chars tend to crouch-block Super Moves. You'll thus surprise them with the overhead and every hit will connect. Otherwise, this move is a good anti-air but if you don't time it well, not all the hits will connect and besides, Jae Hoon has much better anti-airs. No need to use this one! ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ Move name: Hou'ou Kyaku Command: qcf,qcf + B Description: Jae Hoon will rush forward and if the first attack connects, he'll follow with a series of kicks for an 8-hit move until the opponent is literally burning. Like most rush Supers Moves, it won't connect when there is a full screen distance between you and the opponent. The Hou-ou Kyaku is very quick to come out and also has a good recovery. Rely on it when the opponent forgets to block and when you're confident your next attack will connect. It is also comboable and will deal good damage when you use it after a stand C. ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- HOTARU FUTABA ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ Move name: Sou-Shou Ten-Ren-Ge Command: qcf,qcf + A Description: Hotaru quicly dashes forward and starts pummeling the opponent. The Sou-Shou Ten-Ren-Ge has Hotaru starts hitting right from the beginning and it has an excellent range although it will not hit against an opponent if there is a full screen seperation. Logically, since she starts hitting even in missed form, the Super will do less hits if she \"meets\" the opponent some steps forward. The whole move does 17 hits and it can be used in combos but this is relatively hard to achieve. Try to get used to using it combos though and you'll find it very useful. If there is a full distance between you, Hotaru will land right in front of the opponent after she has gone up to finish it. So, you'd be better not pulling the Super in such situations. ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ Move name: Ten-Shou Ran-Ki Command: qcf,qcf + B Description: Hotaru does a flip (along with the usual energy beam, of course) and as the opponent falls down, she goes after him and sits on top of them to release a huge ball of energy in a very naughty animation. The opening frames have invincibility and will fool beginnners such that the Ten-Shou Ran-Ki will work. Moreover, since it starts with a flip, it can also be used as an anti-air. Okay, it's not a first-class anti-air but it's still useful. You must however be careful with the timing because if you mess up, you'll be wide open for anything. Even if the flip misses, Hotaru may still land on the opponent and do the last animation which is still quite damaging. Can be chained in combos. Use after breaking her Kobi-Kyaku and lie back! ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- GATO ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ Move name: Zero Kiba Command: qcf,qcf + A Description: Gato punches the opponent once (looks a lot like his stand C and does pretty much same damage) before jumping at him to twist his head with his legs. There are some cool light effects during the final part as he twists the opponent's head. The first punch needs to hit for Gato to perform the whole move since the other part is a grappling technique. This first part doesn't have too much range which makes the Zero Kiba useless when used alone. It can only be used close and is easy to Just Defend. The recovery after the first hit is somewhat crap too. Use this Super mainly in combos or after breaking the Rai-Ga but in this case, be careful with the timing! ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ Move name: Tatsu Kiba Command: qcf,qcf + B Description: Gato kicks straight up and goes up for 7 hits if the first one connects, his body surrounded by an aura of energy all the time. The Tatsu Kiba is, above all, an anti-air. In fact, because the move has no forward range, use it to punish airborne opponents. Also quick to come out and can be used in combos to ensure that it isn't a mere waste of your power gauge. Since Gato goes all the way up, the recovery is lame though. Never pull this if you're unsure whether it will connect because Gato takes some time to come down and recovery, making it possible for your opponent to pull anything. The Tatsu Kiba also has a nice invincibility time at the beginning, and this should make it hard for your opponent to kick Gato out of it. ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- BONNE JENET ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ Move name: Many Many Torpedoes Command: qcf,qcf + A Description: Jenet jumps forward and moves her feet so swiftly to hit her opponent that they look like torpedoes. The Many Many Torpedoes is quick to come out and can be used in combos, whether normal or chain. Moreover, it has invincibility at start and a frame rate of zero, which make it one of the best supers in the game. The recovery is good too but not much of a difference if you stop close to the opponent which is bound to happen since the move has 3/4 screen distance as range. It is bound to do block damage (excellent one too!) but prepare to take REAL damage in return! Use it in combos since these are not so hard to perform. ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ Move name: Aurora Command: qcf,qcf + B Description: Jenet jumps and spins, forming little waves with her robe which hit the opponent for good damage. She ends with a blown kiss. The Aurora does nice damage overall. The move needs to connect for her to perform the last animation (i.e. the blown kiss). Otherwise, she doesn't perform it and just lands down. Typical anti-air move made even better that the fact that the Aurora also has forward range which is quite surprising concerning Super Moves. Even if you miss an airborne opponent, you may still hit him afterwards if he foolishly attempts to follow you. Bad recovery though since she needs to resume her stance. As a matter of fact, Jenet actually resumes her stance quickly but she's slow to land. Good Super overall, just be on the safe side and use it in combos. ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- MARCO RODRIGUEZ ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ Move name: Haou Shoukou Ken Command: qcf,qcf + A Description: Super projectile as the name itself states. The Haou Shoukou Ken is a bit slow to come out but travels quickly. Moreover, it has full range too which makes it better than most other supers. Unluckily, it cannot be used in combos, even chain ones, since it so slow to come out. Maroc remains in the position he takes to release the projectile and this gives it a lame recovery. If the opponent is freakish enough to jump avoid it, be prepared for one sound kicking on your butt (no pun intended :)). Since this is a projectile, you'd be better using it when you are able to anticipate your opponent's next attack. ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ Move name: Kyokugen Ko Hou Command: qcf,qcf + B Description: By the breathtaking association of words, one can easily guess the nature of this move: a super uppercut! Thus, no forward range but instead, an extremely quick move and great anti-air. The opening frames also have invincibility to make it even better and it can be used in combos or after a breaked Ko Hou for maximum damage. The time for Marco to resume his stance upon landing is quick but would ya bet, that doesn't change anything! Use this exclusively in combos, off counters or as reversals due to the lame recovery. ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- HOKUTOMARU ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ Move name: Chou Hissatsu Shuriken Command: qcf, qcf + A (press AB to end) Description: Hokutomaru quickly throws several shurikens at the opponent. The last shuriken is bigger than the rest. If you press AB during the Chou Hissatsu Shuriken to finish it, Hokutomaru will throw the bigger one as you as you press the buttons. You may do this to reduce the recovery because the time for Hokutomaru to resume his stance normally is quite big because he turns around as he throws the last one. Besides, even though the move is quick to come out (use in combos), the opponent can attack you if they manage to jump over the shurikens. Since it can be used in combos, go for it. Or use it when the opponent screws up since it is fast to come out. ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ Move name: Ougi - Chou Hissatsu Tatsumaki Command: qcf, qcf + B Description: Hokutomaru holds a scroll and spins up as wind gathers around his body. The full move does 9 hits but if you include it in a chain combo, it will hit for less. Even when you perform it alone, it is kinda hard to get the full 9 hits because when it connects as a counter, it loses hit (and thus damage which makes everything really pointless since this is supposed to be an anti-air for god's sake!). You need to get the opponent really close or if they are airborne, get them to touch Hokutomaru's shoulder, to have the Ougi - Chou hit hard. It also has good priority and even if your opponent tries to get in with a cross-over attack, the Super will suck them in. You can also use it as a combo after breaking the Kuu Ha Dan but you will lose some damage along the way. This is still cool if your opponent is the turtler type because if the move misses, prepare for some punishment due to a crappy recovery! ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- FREEMAN ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ Move name: Full Blast Command: qcf,qcf + A (hold) Description: Freeman performs a giant red slash with his hands which has an excellent range. The Full Blast can be charged for 3 seconds but the damage doesn't increase. When uncharged, it is quite quick to come out and can be used in combos to ensure that it will hit. In any case, the recovery is lame, so use it in combos on ground situations if you can. Remember to release the A button immediately thoygh. Since the Full Blast can be held, it has various uses. You can use it as an anticipation move if you are sure your opponent will mess up. The good range means it can still hit even if there's some distance between you. Hold the button to trick the opponent into attacking you and release it as soon as they move and they'll very likely eat Freeman's first Super. It can also be used as anti-air but you need to time it well! ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ Move name: Creeping Death Command: qcf,qcf + B Description: Freeman walks (half a screen distance) as you can see his shadow in a very stylish manner. If the opponent attemps to hit Freeman while he is walking with the shadow, Freeman will stop his attack and will proceed to slash them thrice. The screen turns black as he does so and you can only see the shadows of the two characters along with the slashes. As you can see, the Creeping Death is a counter move and you need to be careful while using it. You can try pulling it as soon as the opponent messes up and you feel that he's going to attack but that's extremely hard to achieve. The best way yet remains to upll it immediately after a blocked combo since the opponent will attempt to hit you, thinking he may be able to use the recovery to his advantage. If the move misses, you'll be easily punished because Freeman does a stupid pose at the end. And it is extremely easy to avoid this move, all your opponent needs to do is to prevent from attacking and he just has to attack as soon as Freeman does the last animation (so, it is very different from Lin's desperation move - Lin rOxOrs by the wat! :)). The Creeping Death is a very good super but you need to be familiar with it and to know all its pros and cons. ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- TIZOC ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ Move name: Big Ball Griffon Command: when close, 720¿ + A Description: This is the standard grappler's super ¿ la Tizoc. Tizoc grabs the opponent and slams them onto the ceiling (or the top of the screen), before putting him under his feet and landing painfully on the poor opponent. As you wold expect, the Big Ball Griffon is very powerful but a drag to pull. Personally, I still cannot achieve the 720¿ without jumping and thus, don't get to pull it often. If you are skilled enough to perform the motion ON THE GROUND, good for you. If, however, you find it too difficult, you can still resort to the old trick of doing a jump attack and having the latter miss (weak punch works best here) before performing the move. This trick sure works but of course, you need some luck or the opponent will hit you and you won't be able to have the move connect. Another great thing about the Big Ball Griffon is that Tizoc jumps back after landing on the opponent and the latter cannot try wake-up techniques to take you by surprise. ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ Move name: Daedalus Attack Command: qcf,qcf + B Description: Tizoc raises his hand up and proceeds to punch the enemy hard 3 times. The Daedalus Attack is NOT a grappling technique and it's also not that damaging. A bit slow to come out and very bad recovery. Although it is not really comboable, you can try buffering a crouch/stand A into the Daedalus Attack. Some chars tend to be weak against that. The opening frames have good invincibility, you can try to make full use of that. Note that although Tizoc dashes forward as he lets loose with his huge fists, the move doesn't have a full screen distance. Instead, if the opponent is that far away, he'll do the last attack just in front of him but it will not connect. You can guess what should normally happen next... ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- KEVIN RIAN ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ Move name: Lucky Strike Command: qcf,qcf + A Description: Kevin rolls forward -- the roll is a bit like the one when he does his Abide Mine but the difference is that this one hits. He'll follow with a few punches and finish with an uppercut. The uppercut causes the opponent to be juggled and you can add another move at the end. Moves that work best as follow-up are the Gatling Freezer (although a bit pointless), the weak Hell Snipe and the Hell Rotor (good timing required here). The Lucky Strike is fast to come out and can therefore be used in combos. The first frames also have invincibility and this will force your opponent to block if they're aware of it. Of course, that can be bad for you but luckily, this super also has a quite good recovery. ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ Move name: Gattling Freezer Command: qcf,qcf + B Description: Kevin kicks up and a bunch of explosions (ripped off Leona?) are observed. The Gattling Freezer is a chain combo friendly move. If it connects against an opponent on the ground, that char will be frozen for a short period (he'll still be gold) and you have the possibility of comboing in another move, even the Lucky Strike if you satisfy the conditions. If it hits an airborne opponent, the latter will not really be frozen but he'll land very slowly and this gives you time to add another move in for more hits. But the Gattling Freezer is quite useless as anti-air because it's very quick to come out and chances that you'll miss are high. Even on the ground, it may not connect against crouching opponents. Although the move is quick to come out, Kevin can still be hit out of it as he takes a military pose before he kicks up. Crouching opponents will thus be able to counterhit him, so be careful. Use it in combos (normal ones or breakable ones) so that it'll hit at all times! ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- GRANT ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ Move name: Majin Haten Dan Command: qcf,qcf + A Description: Grant kicks up and forms a big projectile at an angle of 120¿ (as from his side) that covers the whole vertical distance (i.e. from the floor to the ceiling!). Obviously, the Majin Haten Dan is an anti-air. Quite quick to come out and can be comboed after Grant's f + C normal move. So, you can use it in such combos or even better, use it in chain combos since Grant can perform those quite easily. The opening frames have invincibility which makes that your opponent will have a hard time hitting Grant out of it and the Majin Haten Dan is not so easy to Just Defend. Lame recovery though since Grant turns around once after releasing the projectile. Use this super in combos, as anti-air or off a counter for maximum damage! ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ Move name: Majin Engetsu Rin Command: qcf,qcf + B Description: Grant spins forward and he forms a circular beam around his body as he does so. If the move does connect, he'll finish with a charge but if it misses, he doesn't perform the charge and just stops instead. The whole move does 14 hits and note that if he performs the charge, Grant teleports to the other side such that, in a sense, the Majin Engetsu Rin is a cross-over. In any case, just keep in mind that you'll switch side with the opponent if the move connects. The Majin Engetsu Rin also has full range and Grant will do tick damage even to a far-away scrub. Can be used in combos, normal or chain. Also use it off counters to have it connect but note that it does less hits off counters or if you're so desperate as to be using it as an anti-air. This super also has a surprisingly good recovery. ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- KAIN ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ Move name: Himmlischer Atem Command: qcf,qcf + A Description: Kain raises his hand and an arrow projectile lands just in front of him. The projectile comes down quickly and can be used as an anti-air. The Himmlischer Atem can be used just after the Himmlische Seele (as you will be able to see later) and you can have the 2 supers combo if you are close enough. The fact that the projectile lands just in front of Kain is somewhat bad since it will miss against far away opponent. The Himmlischer Atem is thus more useful in close situations. Pull it immediately when the opponent jumps with an attack as it is quite hard to Just Defense. ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ Move name: Himmlische Seele Command: qcf,qcf + B Description: Kain releases a blue ball of enery that has full range, i.e. the ball of enery will travel the whole screen if need be until it finally goes off-screen. Logically, the more it has travelled, the less hits it will do. If you pull it close to the opponent and it immediately connects, it will do 7 hits. Avoid pulling it against a cornered opponent since it will do at most only 3 hits as it is quick to get off-screen. You also have the ability to add in more hits as the ball hits multiple times and does so at a leasurely place. You can add Kain's regular projectile if you wish or even the Himmlishcer Atem if you have a power gauge. Freaks will want to pull 2 Himmlische Seele in quick succession but this is pointless because the second one will miss altogher as the opponent will be knocked out. It is also a juggle and you can even add more hits at the end if you're quick enough. The Himmlische Seele is his best super as I'll show in the combos and infinites sections! ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ============================================================================= IX. POTENTIAL POWERS ============================================================================= \"I'm a little monster who kicks big butt!\" - Choi Potential Powers are even more powerful than Super Moves. In most cases, the Potential Powers are just stronger versions than Super Moves but some characters have hidden Powers, some of which are harder to pull. In order to pull these, the gauge needs to be at P. Power. When you perform such moves, the background agains turn black and the animation freezes but you'll notice some absolutely beautiful light effects that are really worth it too. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- ROCK HOWARD ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ Move name: Raging Storm Command: qcf, qcf + C (hold to delay) Description: Similar to the S. Power, Rock will unleash his energy to form a shield which can also act as an anti-air. When not held, it takes more time to come out and if you charge it to the max (about 8 seconds), it is 2 times more damaging. The advantage with this one is that since it has so much charging time, you can pull it against a cornered opponent and they'll be so confused, trying to Just Defend that they'll eat the move when you release the button. In general, you can take your opponent by surprise using this and make the full 4 hits connect. ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ Move name: Shine Knuckle Command: qcf, qcf + D Description: The P. Potential Shine Knuckle is a real beauty. Rock will start just as he does during the S. Power but on hitting the opponent, he'll perform an elbow attack followed by an ultra-damaging Rising Tackle. The first hit must connect for Rock to perform the whole move. If it is blocked, Rock will stop right here. The P. Potential suffers from the same drawback as its weaker counterpart, i.e. it will not connect if there is a full screen distance between Rock and the opponent. Rock will end up close to the opponent and will be wide open for any attack. Again, this is made up by its comboability and for a P. Potential, the Shine Knuckle is very quick to come out. ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ Move name: Deadly Rave \"Neo\" Command: hcb,f + A, A, A, B, B, C, C, D, D, qcb + C Description: This is a \"younger\" version of Geese's Ryuuko Ranbu! :) Rock will hit the enemy joyfully with his fists and his legs and he'll finish by performing an energy blast DBZ-style if you get to perform the last command which is the qcb+C. The Deadly Rave \"Neo\" is quite hard to pull the first time but if you use Rock a lot, you'll have no problem performing it after some time as long as you are wise enough to practice. A trick you can do is to perform the hcb,f+A quickly and to tap A repeatedly until Rock performs all the hits. Then, quickly move on to B, tap until he performs the hits, etc...If you mess up when you reach C or D, it is possible to do another move quickly and the latter will combo in. Your best option in this case is the Hard Edge (hcb + P) because it is fairly quick to come out compared to his other moves. It also seems that if you pull the Deadly Neo \"Rave\" in a situation where only a couple of hits are needed to beat your opponent, just input those and once the words K.O. flash, Rock will perform everything else by himself (that's how I got to see the full move the first time :)). The Deadly Rave \"Neo\" is comboable too, abuse this sweet ability to batter all your silly opponents senseless. Like Geese's Ryuuko Ranbu, you can also stop on a given hit and instead of tapping the required buttons, perform other commands to have his special moves add up to the first hits of the Deadly Rave. I'll put an example in the combos section. ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- TERRY BOGARD ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ Move name: Power Geyser Command: qcf,qcf + C Description: Terry will punch te ground three times and each time, he'll form a Power Geyser, which makes the entire move hit thrice. The first two geysers come out in quick succession while a fraction of a section goes by between the second and third geyser. Because of this, when you use the P. Potential Power Geyser as an anti-air, it will net only 2 hits most of the time. The second geyser will miss since it comes out so quickly after the first one which will sent the opponent up. A nice thing is that the P. Potential version comes out quicker than its weak counterpart and it may hit the opponent by surprise if you time it well. It is possible to combo it after a normal move but good luck in doing so often... :) ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ Move name: Buster Wolf Command: qcf,qcf + D Description: Same animation as its weak version except that it comes out slower but it deals more hits upon connecting with the opponent. The Buster Wolf is comboable too -- and this is much easier to achieve -- and you can use it off a counter when the opponent is unable to block for breathtaking damage. The drawback is its recovery time but if you are quick enough, you may be able to Just Defend whatever your opponent decides to throw your way. However, better be safe than sorry, so use it most often in combos or off counters. ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- KIM DONG HWAN ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ Move name: Super Dong Hwan Kyaku Command: in air, qcf,qcf + C Description: This time, Dong Hwan will perform 7 hits and each time, he'll include cool lighting effects which cause each kick to be even more damaging. Again, your best bet to pull it is to wait for the opponent to mess up on the ground while you happen to be up and to immediately use it. The fact that Dong Hwan also travels forward while going towards the opponent is a bonus although the first kick can be Just Defended. A nice P. Potential but doesn't have many uses. Tizoc is weak against it, abuse it to beat him quickly. Just wait for him to jump (which he does often) and drool at the magnificency of the Super Don Hwan Kyaku. ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ Move name: Raimei Dan Command: qcf,qcf + D (hold) Description: Thankfully, the P. Potentail Raimei Dan is better than its weak version. There are 3 levels to this charge move! The basic one (Level 1) does only 2 hits. Level 2 will hit thrice and if you hold as much as possible, it will do 4 hits and this level is very damaging! Note that the first hit is an overhead and this can save your ass in a lot of your occasions (like your opponent not knowing about that :)). It is not comboable after a normal move but can be used in a chain combo in the same way as the S. Power, i.e. qcf + D -> Raimei Dan. You will need to time it though to have the P. Potential combo in. However, only one hit of the move will connect but you'll observe that the opponent will get up as Dong Hwan is performing the third hit and it may happen that the third and the fourth hit will connect as the silly newbie forgets to block. ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ Move name: Ore-sama Hou-ou Kyaku Command: qcf,qcf,qcf + C Description: The Ore-sama Hou-ou Kyaku is a hidden P. Potential. Dong Hwan will run towards the opponent in a weird way (like a clown!) and will hit him continuously just as his dad would do. The move does 16 hits and has Dong Hwan take the opponent up to finish with a Hien Zan like...er...his dad...:) The Ore-same etc... is extremely damaging and very fast to come out. Combo it after the standing C and laugh as your opponent eats kick after kick. When there is a full screen distance between Dong Hwan and the opponent, he'll end up just in front of the opponent without attacking and he takes some time before he is able to block again. So, don't use it in those situations if you don't want to die in a silly way! ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~~ ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- KIM JAE HOON ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ Move name: Hou-yoku Ten-Shou Kyaku Command: qcf,qcf + C (hold and let go to follow up) Description: This potential does 10 hits and like its weak counterpart, involves several Hien Zans. If you hold the C button and time it accordingly, Jae Hoon will dash forwad with a fire kick and will add another hit on the falling opponent. You need to keep holding the button all the time untl you let it go though. If you release it at some point during the move and press it again before letting go, he will not perform the extra kick. This potential is quick to come out and can be used in combos. In fact, have fun using it in combos because it has a lame recovery along with no forward range and you'll be easily punished if it is blocked or misses. ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ Move name: Hou'ou Kyaku Command: qcf,qcf + D Description: Jae Hoon rushes forward and kicks the opponent multiple times, finishing with a stylish Hien Zan. The first kick needs to connect for him to perform the whole move, otherwise he just stops (actually great since it lowers the recovery). Very quick to come out and can be used in ground or chain combos. You can also pull it quickly when the opponent messes up since, as I've already stated, it is a very fast move. This is one of the very few potential powers that have full range and this fact alone makes it very useful. Anyway, you shouldn't have problems getting it to connect and in addition, it is a very strong move. ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- HOTARU FUTABA ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ Move name: Sou-Shou Ten-Ren-Ge Command: qcf,qcf + C Description: Just the same as the Super Move except that it does one hit less and Hotaru finishes with a knee attack this one. The Sou-Shou Ten-Ren-Ge isn't really that damaging for a Potential Power. It is still quick to come out and can be used in combos to have all the hits connects. The recovery is exceedling crap though, specially due to the last knee attack. You can use this to cause guard damage, that's truthfully the only reason I find to it other than in ground combos. It also has a full range such that the knee attack may hit a far-away scrub. In any case, it can take the opponent by surprise. ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ Move name: Ten-Shou Ran-Ki Command: qcf,qcf + D Description: Same as Super, Hotaru does the sommersault, lands onto the happy opponent and unleashes all her energy in a huge ball. She uses more energy here though and believe me, the Ten-Shou Ran-Ki is one hell of a Potential...Warning, major damage indeed!! Even if the opening animation misses, she may still land onto the opponent for the naughty animation and that alone will deal a pack of damage. The sommersault is quick to come out and make the Ten-Shou Ran-Ki useful in ground combos and it is great as anti-air even though you need to be careful about the timing. The opening frames have invincibility and careless openents may thus still eat it. ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- GATO ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ Move name: Zero Kiba Command: qcf,qcf + C Description: Gato punches the opponent (same animation and strength as his stand C), and will then jump to twist the opponent's neck with his legs. He will end by slamming the opponent on the ground some distance away and punching down at the same time. The move does 3 hits and is very powerful, major damage coming your opponent's way if it connects. The first hit (i.e. the punch) needs to connect for Gato to perform the whole move. Otherwise, he just stops after the punch. Can be used in combos but actually, it is better off a counter or after juggles. ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ Move name: Tatsu Kiba Command: qcf,qcf + D Description: Gato kicks straight up as his body is surrounded by orange energy and he spins as he goes up. The Tatsu Kiba does 9 hits and has invincibility during the opening animation where Gato first does the small jump. Lame recovery since Gato needs to land and for this reason, use this Potential Power in combos or off a counter. It is also a good anti-air but note that the direction is straight up and you need to be careful with the timing or Gato will just fly past the airborne opponent. Nice move but wait, there's a third hidden one... ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ Move name: Ten-Ryuu Retsu-Kiba Command: f,d,df + AB (up to 3 times) Description: Can be hard to pull but if you want to be a good Gato player, mastering the Ten-Ryuu Retsu-Kiba in combos should be your first task. This is his strongest Potential Power by far if you get to pull it the 3 times. First hit is a shoulder attack, second is a palm attack (with a doubtful pose too) and the third is a strong punch with some cool energy effects surrounding it. If it is blocked, there is no need to pull the whole move because the recovery increases as you perform more hits. So, if the opponent is swift enough to block the move, stop after the shoulder attack and you might still make it through. :) Also quick to come out and can thus be used in combos. You can also pull it just as the opponent messes up but the shoulder attack doesn't have too much range and you need to be quite close to the opponent for it to connect. Anyway, you cannot go on if the shoulder attack doesn't touch the opponent. Also good at causing guard crush -- only 1 needed, next attack is good -- but truthfully, you'd have to be a complete scrub to use the Ten-Ryuu Retsu-Kiba solely for this purpose. Are you a scrub? ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- BONNE JENET ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ Move name: Many Many Torpedoes Command: qcf,qcf + C Description: Same as its weak counterpart except it does more hits and this time, the Many Many Torpedoes travels the whole screen. It will do a measly 3 hits if there is a full screen separation between Jenet and the opponent and the latter is dumb enough to eat it but hey, that will do! :) Still comboable and is great at causing guard crush if you are _that_ desperate. Try putting it in normal combos everytime because it hits for less in chain combos or off counters. Also, the opening frames have invincibility and Jenet cannot be hit out of the move at this instant. ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ Move name: Aurora Command: qcf,qcf + D Description: Jenet spins up-forward and hits multiple times before ending with a blown kiss (practically the same as when she hops back except that this one hits). The Aurora can be used as an anti- air but you need to be careful with the timing due to the angle at which Jenet jumps. If there is a full screen sepetation between her and the opponent, she'll land just in front of the latter and he'll be able to pull anything. Jenet takes a lot of time to land and punishment is bound to come your way! ;( Concerning the kiss, the move needs to be successful for Jenet to perform that part. If it is blocked, she will not perform it. (This actually is just as if the move missed since the opponent will be on the ground while Jenet will be taking herself for one of those mutants that can fly!) Use the Aurora in chain combos to have it fully connect without losing hits. ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- MARCO RODRIGUEZ ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ Move name: Haou Shoukou Ken Command: qcf,qcf + C Description: Marco will throw a huge projectile which does 4 hits. The move is slow to come out, so it cannot be comboed. However, there is some invincibility at the start of the move when Marco thrusts his hands forward such that he cannot be throw out of it at this instant. The Haou Shoukou Ken travels faster than its S. Power counterpart and similarly, it will travel the whole screen. Moreover, since it is so big, it can even negate certain projectiles and even pass through those. Basically, if you pull the Haou Shoukou Ken while the opponent throws his usual projectile (provided he has one), the Super Move will cut it and is bound to connect since the opponent is still recovering. Of course, this isn't as easy as it sounds since you need to time the Haou Shoukou Ken well because of the little delay which I've already mentioned. It will also take airborne opponents by surprise a lot of times since it is so fast. ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ Move name: Kyokugen Ko Hou Command: qcf,qcf + D Description: The Kyokugen Ko Hou is a strong uppercut move where Marco will go up as his hand is surrounded by energy. The move does 10 hits and is comboable. In fact, use it only in combos because it has a pretty lame recovery time and if it misses, you'll be severely punished. This is a typical anti-air but the weird this is that it'll be less damaging if it connects as one. Its other purpose is as a reversal though since all the hits will connect and like I mentioned earlier, the Kyokugen Ko Hou is very damaging. ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ Move name: Ryuuko Ranbu Command: qcf,qcf,qcf + C (tap C repeatedly) Level 1: 0 - 2 times Level 2: 3 - 6 times "
