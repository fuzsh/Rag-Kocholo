        "text": "Rebirth and Satan 666? No. They get blitzed.\n\nI don't think DBZ was proven to be above light speed yet so, no, the upper tier 666 Satan characters should be on par.\n\nAnd it's really only End Manga Jio w/ completed Shin that stands a chance. Shin's capacity for energy and matter absorption is universal, and it absorbed an entire planet in the past. This means that any energy blast from Buu would be ineffective, and Buu himself could be absorbed into Shin. Shin also has a soul sucking canon, and should be able to teleport by using two of the demon recipe's powers.\n\nThat's really the only way I see the 666 Satan verse standing a chance though.\n\nSephiroth cuts Majin Buu into tiny pieces and fries him. Dante time-stops and rapes.\n\n-I'm sorry good sir/madam, that is incorrect. Dante's timestop did'nt do jack in DMC1 against Nelo Angelo, he also still needed help to beat Arkham who was just a giant slug in DMC3. His timestop does'nt stop time just slows movement down but Majin is so fast compared to him even 60% decrease in speed does jack.\n\n- Sephiroth is'nt doing jack to a guy who could take Frieza and Cell at the same time. Planet Busting was something Vegeta could do at 18,000 with his Galick gun.Dabura stated somewhere that someone with at least 300 kilis can easily destroy the Earth,Goku's Super Saiyan level was counted by Babidi as 3,000 kilis as compared to his monster pet Yakon at a relatively measly 800 kilis, That means Super Saiyan Goku can give an Earth Shattering Kaboom to the said planet ten times over if you take it in that context.\n\nSo even if you add DMC+FF VII+OP+Naruto+Bleach ,this is still a godstomp in Buu's favor because he requires Goku to go SSJ3.\n\nThis is not obvious to me. I assume that you refer to the Godhand and the concept of evil.\n\nBut none in Berserk have shown feats remotely close to that of Majin Boo.\n\nControlling souls through mutual agreements, residing in a pocket universe. How would this stop Majin Boo? Who clearly broke himself out from the Room of Time and Spirit, destroyed earth with a casual blast, etc.\n\nThis is not obvious to me. I assume that you refer to the Godhand and the concept of evil..\n\nYes no one else in the verse stands a fucking chance.\n\nBut none in Berserk have shown feats remotely close to that of Majin Boo.\n\nControlling souls through mutual agreements, residing in a pocket universe. How would this stop Majin Boo? Who clearly broke himself out from the Room of Time and Spirit, destroyed earth with a casual blast, etc.\n\nThey control the laws of causality controlling the outcomes of events including whole fights, buu cannot strike them even if their in a mortal shell due to this power and can't win because of it.\n\nPlus Godhand still have reality warping to fuck Buu over, hell any strike's they land on him destroy the soul his regen means nothing in a fight with them.\n\nRight, cuz you said it, it's so true. No, Buu does his stupid shit that he does, while Dante stops time and crucifies him.\n\nHow long does it take Dante to do that? Can he do it faster than Buu can punch him into a orbit?\n\nAlso, even if he does stop time, what if gods name makes you think he can still hurt Buu? Feats plz kthxbai."
