        "text": "Post by Solus on\n\nBecause of the current fight in DBM people tend to theorize about Piccolo's actual power level - which is stupid since he himself stated in DBM that he hit his limit and never reached Perfect Cell's level. But I wonder how strong Piccolo was after the last time he really fought.\n\n1. Cell Games: In the Manga there is only one picture showing Piccolo interacting with a Cell Jr. at all. And that is a little panel in chapter 408.\n\nThen there is another image at the first pages of volume 34 which is not really connected to the story but still shows Piccolo, Trunks and Vegeta as the only ones standing. It definitely does refer to the fight against the Juniors but question is, how relevant it is, since it is no manga panel. I'm sorry, but I can't show it to you, since I don't find it anywhere in the internet.\n\nIt's clear that the Juniors are only toying with all of them since Cell orders them to kill the Z Warriors after realizing that this won't trigger Gohan enough. But the mere fact that Piccolo is still on his feet seems to me an indicator for a really huge power level in comparison to all others. Now you could argue, that he is of course way stronger than the humans. But at his base level after fusing with Kami would he really be stronger than an exhausted Goku? I mean, Goku had a hard fight against Cell, but he wasn't even injured in the least. He just was exhausted. That's all. Now given all my assumptions base on Piccolo standing and Goku being pummeled meaning that Piccolo was stronger than Goku at that Moment. Could Goku really fall so many tiers in power that he would be weaker than C17 without being severely injured? If we take it for granted that all the Juniors were equally strong and they all fought to not kill but still defeat and torture their opponents, how could Piccolo fare better against one of them then Goku?\n\nIt's a far stretch, since there is no real evidence for anything I claim, but I do think that Cell Games Piccolo is not that far behind Trunks and Vegeta. And even if you think they didn't make any progress in the second year they trained in the HTC (which is heavily implied in the manga and anime but actually bullshit) then that would be a huge jump for him. Do you agree with me up to this point?\n\nThen here is the next thing ... Despite Gohan no-one ever was portrayed as slacking of. Yet in the Budokai Tenkaichi Piccolo (who should have maintained the power level of the Cell Games or even improved) surrendered against Kaioshin. But not because he knew who that was, but because he thought, that Kaioshin was way stronger than him.\n\n(Sorry for the bad quality ...)\n\nThat scene never made any sense and I believe it was just to hype Kaioshin and not thought through to the end. But let's take it for canon (which it sadly is). For Kaioshin to be leagues above Piccolo Shin had to be at least as strong as Cell if Piccolo was at Super-Vegeta level. We know, Shin wasn't, so we have to scale that down. How strong could Shin be at maximum? He never had any real fight except against Buu and he was pummeled. But Majin Vegeta was, too, so that is no indication. We do know, that the realms of SSJ2 are far beyond Shins imagination, because he was so excited and surprised when Gohan went SSJ2 against Kibito. Also he thought, Dabra (who was said to be about as strong as Perfect Cell by Vegeta) would be invincible. This also means that Shin can't really sense energy levels because he witnessed Gohan's SSJ2 before he met Dabra. But that is on another note.\n\nSo we know that Shin is weaker than Dabra/Cell but Leagues stronger than Piccolo. Let's go with an easy calculation here and say Shin is at Cell Jr. level and Piccolo anywhere beneath that. Is that realistic? Could Piccolo really be beneath that level if he managed to climb from C17 level to Super-Vegeta level in just two years? There were seven years between Cell and Buu and Piccolo didn't get any stronger?\n\nIt also seems that he did not train at all, since he is much smaller than in the Cell Games (look at his arm in the second picture). But why would he? What do you all say? How strong was Piccolo in the buu saga?\n\nPost by Solus on\n\nThere is no proof for that, except one scene where Goku and Vegeta free all of them. But we don't know what actually happened to Gotenks after he was absorbed. Imagine him inside that bubble and splitting up. Shouldn't Goten and Trunks be in the same bubble then? Toriyama surely didn't think about all that. But I don't see why Buu shouldn't have access to Goten and Trunks's SSJ power even after fusion. When Gotenks SSJ3 defused against Buu, Trunks and Goten were also in SSJ, not in base.\n\nThe last time we saw Goten and Trunks defuse in their fight, They were in base, as they fused in base and want SSJ after fusing\n\nOh yeah, you're right. I checked it up and realized, that I mixed my memories up with this scene:\n\nBut ok, let's stay with the original manga. Actually Gotenks didn't defuse against Buu, but lost his SSJ3 and went back to base. Now we have to speculate about how Buu's absorption works again. The boys fused and went immediately SSJ3 before Buu absorbed them. That means, if their SSJ3 runs out after 5 minutes, they should have 25 minutes left as base Gotenks. Does that mean that Piccolo was stronger than Base Gotenks? That's hardly believable, is it? Or does it mean that for whatever reason they defuse directly after SSJ3 runs out? However there is still nothing that indicates that Buu could not access to their power as SSJ.\n\nSo either Piccolo > Base Gotenks (which I don't believe) or Piccolo > SSJ Trunks (which is highly probable). So my Point about Vegeta not being able to beat Piccolo without transforming is still valid.\n\nPost by Axalon on\n\nIt's really hard to tell how strong he was since he was such an underused character by then.\n\nRegarding Piccolo in Cell Games:\n\nI'm fairly sure that's because of said toying with them that was already mentioned. Cell's watching the entire thing and clearly states that only Vegeta and Trunks are really holding their own.\n\nBear in mind that at the exact moment he says this you can literally see Piccolo and a Cell Jr fighting each other in the bottom right corner, but Cell doesn't even count him as a factor. Piccolo's on his feet later on, yes, but that doesn't necessarily mean he's holding his own like Vegeta and Trunks were. It just means he hasn't collapsed like Goku and Krillin already had.\n\nRegarding Piccolo in the Buu Saga:\n\nShin need not be as strong as Cell if we also don't assume that Piccolo is equal to Super Vegeta. Remember, Cell is only brought up as a comparison when Dabura is fighting Gohan, and Shin started sweating bullets the instant he saw Dabura.\n\nFurthermore, if we take DBS into account regarding Dabura, we see how well SS1 Future Trunks and Shin do prior to Trunks unlocking SS2. AKA, not well.\n\nDabura isn't even winded while the trio of Trunks, Shin and Kibito are beat up. It thus stands to reason that placing Shin as being equals to Cell, whom Goku directly compared Dabura to, is a false equivalency. Shin therefore must logically be weaker than Cell using Dabura as our comparison and Cell stand-in.\n\nSo what does this mean for Piccolo?\n\nWell, it means that he's weaker than Shin for starters, though that wasn't really in question due to the forfeit. We also know that Piccolo is the strongest absorbed individual once Gotenks de-fuses into the base form of Goten and Trunks, which isn't saying much since Piccolo was also stronger than the base form of Goku or Vegeta and only became weaker than them when they went Super Saiyan anyway.\n\nBecause of this we can expect a scale to look something like this:\n\nSuper Saiyan 2 (Anybody)\n\nSuper Perfect Cell\n\nPerfect Cell/Dabura\n\nSupreme Kai\n\nPiccolo\n\nBase Goten/Trunks\n\nIf that scale looks incredibly unhelpful that's because it IS unhelpful.\n\nPiccolo is low enough on the scale that the specifics of his power level didn't even matter up until Buuccolo made him the most relevant person he had absorbed for a short time. He may well indeed be as strong as Super Vegeta by the time of the Buu Saga, but it's all a guessing game with incredibly limited information to work with aside from the fact that Shin is stronger than he is. Personally I'd put him at maybe Imperfect Cell levels just prior to absorbing #17. Semi-Perfect Cell at best, with Shin being more akin to Super Vegeta than Piccolo.\n\nAs for DBM Piccolo, he's clearly improved a bit despite not reaching Perfect Cell levels, given what he did to Majin #17.\n\nPost by Axalon on\n\nThat makes no sense since SS1 Gohan, even when slacking, is stronger than Piccolo.\n\nErgo, Goten/Trunks are stronger than Piccolo.\n\nIt makes sense if SSJ Gohan is still stronger than some kids, which most likely he is.\n\nYou know, \"adult body\" and stuff. Ergo, Goten/Trunks are still not stronger than Piccolo. I don't think Goten or Trunks individually could deal with A18, or Freeza for example.\n\nAnd no, I do not take daizenshuus into account. I never do.\n\nI don't like the Daizhenshuus either, but I simply provided it for those who might use it as a Devil's Advocate to \"the opposite wasn't stated either\" point.\n\nPersonally, I think it's absurd that Piccolo would be weaker than Goten, and have no idea where the writers of it pulled that from.\n\nThat said, I don't think the kids would have any problems dealing with Frieza, individually or not. #18 is a bit murky, but she had no qualms of throwing a freaking kienzan at them, quite possibly one of the most lethal attacks in her arsenal, in a bid to simply disqualify them rather than outright knock them out. If they were on par with, say, Android Saga SS1 Vegeta, it'd be an easy knockout victory. As easy as the way she broke his arm with a single kick. The fact she chose this potentially lethal option instead I feel is a bit telling, instead of simply smacking them on the head and being done with it.\n\nAs for Buu, I'm just gonna chalk up the DBM examples as author/artist discretion. Personally, I don't buy into the \"max potential\" thing as it stands in DBZ (DBM being it's own continuity) and think that Gotenks was SS3 the whole time he was absorbed. There's no real evidence either way though, so rather than just argue headcanons for the worst saga in DBZ I think we can all agree that Piccolo's strength is \"not much better\" than it was in the previous saga."
