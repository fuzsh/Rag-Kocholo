        "text": "Initially, we're introduced to Fat Buu. In a fit of rage, he separates himself into two: the good Mr. Buu and the evil grey Buu. This is something that we've seen before with the Nameless Namekian who split into Kami and Piccolo Daimao so no problem here.\n\nWhat I find weird however is that despite coming from the not so remarkably intelligent Fat Buu, the grey Evil Buu is not only capable of proper speech, but he's also pretty intelligent. Why is that? Then the Evil Buu absorbs the Good Buu and triggers a transformation that changes him into Super Buu, becoming massively stronger than the original Fat Buu but also less intelligent than the grey Evil Buu.\n\nSuper Buu's transformation tree is pretty straightforward and easy to understand. Whenever he absorbs someone his appearance changes to match that person and he also gains their strength and abilities.\n\nSuper Buu goes through Buutenks, Buuccolo and finally his Buuhan form. However, after Goku and Vegeta manage to infiltrate his body and rescue the others, Super Buu says that if they sever Good Buu's connection he'll cease to exist, as in he'll change to something different.\n\nLogically, severing Good Buu's connection would mean that he revers back to the grey Evil Buu that absorbed the former in the first place. However, that was not the case...\n\nSuper Buu first revers to Buff Buu (who is stronger than him) but then quickly changes to Kid Buu.\n\nNow Buff Buu and Kid Buu came out of nowhere and make no sense.\n\nWe later find out that Buff Buu is the result of Kid Buu absorbing the South Kaioshin. So that means that Buff Buu would become his permanent new form. Why is it that he changes back into Kid Buu? He should've stayed Buff.\n\nThen Kid Buu himself makes no sense either since he should've reverted back into the grey Evil Buu in the first place.\n\nkid buu was an asspull from toriyama.\n\nI can see toriyama thinking maybe i should make a small buu but also make him very powerfull becouse expectations and all that bullshit that isnt funny or cool since forever anymore.\n\ni can imagin toriyama gettin confused on who is the strongest buu himself.\n\nKid Buu does indeed seem like a last minute idea.\n\nThere are two problems with severing Good Buu's connection to Super Buu:\n\n1) He reverted into Buff Buu instead of the grey one, totally random form that was even stronger than Super Buu ironically.\n\n2) He then further reverted into Kid Buu (which should be impossible since the absorptions change Buu permanently unless temporary buffs like Gotenks), who is yet another random form instead of the grey one.\n\nMajin Buu is not a beast a monster like kid buu that can barely talk.\n\nEvil buu is more like kage to the ryuu bieng majin buu or now good buu, or like the diavolo to the vinegar doppio majin buu is an actuall sentient personality the combination of daio kaioshin and kid buu ,no different then u and I and evil buu is the evil part of majin buu the person. That created a physical body for himself.\n\nEvil buu is more like an alternate persona maby even schizoid in a sense. But nevertheless connected to majin buu.\n\nEvil buu eats majin buu and they are one again this time with evil personality in control.\n\nRemove the now good buu from super buu who is actually evil buu but a bit mellowed out, but evil buu could only exist because majin buu has an actual personality thanx to the grand supreme kai and the personality dissapears. If I kill the horde from the whole mr glass universe all his other personalities will die with him including the “beast”\n\nIn this merged super buu body’s case good buu was always the component that responsible for that sentience. Vegeta abrubtly removed good buu thus the part responsible for evil buu and thus super buu in the first place. Now the body is just evil without the “component” to give it a personality or asElder kai said paraphrased “ This majin buu has no soul”\n\nMajin buu shares a body with super buu this is different then the whole evil buu physical manifestation.\n\nthis pink body exist now solely on evil. That should answer the first problem.\n\nAs for why buff buu wasn’t a permanent form. I can only speculate that the south kai eventually dissolves, i mean dai kaioshin fused akin to a potara in the way that the personality is mixed like his literal soul is with in buu, but oddly enough his body is not chilling in a pod. maby south supreme kai was not so lucky that his soul still persists.\n\nUh......hhhhhhmmmmm.\n\nOk when Buu 1st split they were still more a mix of all of the things he had absorbed.(South and supreme Kai). That is why he was not Kid Buu when he split because technically Fat Buu was the main body.\n\nSince we know more peaceful and good people he absorbs make him weaker, his more evil side was in control now which meant more power could be used. He was like more south kai then supreme which I think Super Buu's body represented.\n\nNow why did he not revert back to gray Buu when Fat Buu was taken down? Maybe because by this time Evil Buu was now the main body and all of his goodness was now dumped into Fat Buu. When he was taken down I am thinking that everything that was Supreme Kai was taken out of him.\n\nRemember in the final fight Kid Buu still had to spit out Fat Buu so he would stop holding back against Herecule. Kid Buu did not re-absorb yet while still being inside was able to affect him.\n\nMajin Buu is not a beast a monster like kid buu that can barely talk.\n\nEvil buu is more like kage to the ryuu bieng majin buu or now good buu, or like the diavolo to the vinegar doppio majin buu is an actuall sentient personality the combination of daio kaioshin and kid buu ,no different then u and I and evil buu is the evil part of majin buu the person. That created a physical body for himself.\n\nEvil buu is more like an alternate persona maby even schizoid in a sense. But nevertheless connected to majin buu.\n\nEvil buu eats majin buu and they are one again this time with evil personality in control.\n\nRemove the now good buu from super buu who is actually evil buu but a bit mellowed out, but evil buu could only exist because majin buu has an actual personality thanx to the grand supreme kai and the personality dissapears. If I kill the horde from the whole mr glass universe all his other personalities will die with him including the “beast”\n\nIn this merged super buu body’s case good buu was always the component that responsible for that sentience.

It still had the Kaio influence, because it was still a part of Boo and\n\nI have no fucking idea.\n\nNo you are absolutely correct. Evil Buu was a personification of Fat Buu's rage as stated by the narrator. That's why he had the Dai Kaioshin outfit like him. He was simply the manifestation of the anger he couldn't contain anymore. Said anger took most of his power which is why it easily beat up the good half and when it merged them again, it resulted in the \"evil\" Fat Buu counterpart we know as Super Buu.\n\nKid Buu is simply the real, unaltered form of Buu. He's the essence of them all.\n\nAre Evil and Super Buu actually decidedly more intelligent than Fat Buu? They're less childish than Fat Buu, including in their speech patterns, but is there clear evidence that they're smarter? I don't even remember Evil Buu uttering a single word because his appearance was so brief, so I can't comment on his intelligence versus Super Buu.\n\nI think semi-reasonable explanations for the rest of this stuff have been offered up in the thread, though I'm pretty sure the real answer is summarized as\n\nSuper Boo is just as stupid as Fat Boo, he's just mean and more concerned about fighting. He falls for the same kind of juvenile tricks that would work on Fat Boo\n\nMuscular Boo:\n\nBecause the last fight was mean for Goku and Vegeta working together but any version of Boo with someone absorbed was too strong. Toriyama wrote himself into a corner by saying the South Kai was absorbed so Boo was given a limit of how many beings he can be fused with at any given time, Muscular Boo is the remains of the Kaioshin power that where still present somewhere in Boo.\n\nThe plot in the last part of the Boo arc repeatedly twists itself so it can end on the Genkidama.\n\nKid Boo:\n\nThe kid form is the real Boo, the original pure evil monster, Evil Boo is that evil part taking control of a little more than half of the power and body from the Boo that was already fused with a Kaioshin.\n\nFat buu is simply Kid buu absorbing Dai Kaioshin.\n\nSuper Buu is the same components of Fat Boo, he did not absorb anybody in addition to the current components. He is simply a manifestation of Buu's dominant demeanor shifting from being that of a kind-hearted entity to being evil. That is why many people refer to \"Super Buu\" as \"Evil Buu\", because it is Buu who's make up is the same, but which has become evil.(And this apparently makes him stronger somehow)\n\nThe grey \"Evil buu\" that we know is simply a tangible means for Toriyama to show Buu becoming evil. He isn't really a result of any particular mix like the others are:\n\nKid buu: Original\n\nFat Buu: Kid buu+Dai Kaioshin(Good)\n\nSuper Buu: Kid buu+Dai Kaioshin(Evil)\n\nThe Grey Boo exists solely for that scene, and does not need to represent anything further than that.\n\nOr at least that is how I interpet it with my head canon. The Buu arc is a bunch of convoluted trash."
