So... you're saying he scales to Young Beerus but he doesn't know how to tap into it? That makes no sense and wouldn't even warrant him a tier since he literally can't do it.\n\nWell you're trying to use it apart of this thread trying to upgrade the canon version of Buu so I would assume you're attempting to argue this canon.

Especially, DBS Moro arc is entirely written by Akira Toriyama (creator & writer of DB manga) so it's definitely canon, He simply retconed stuff.\n\nMajin Buu more specifically \"Evil version\" scales above Past Beerus, nerf Daikaioshin who are multi galaxy buster. I don’t see any issues with rating 3-B to Majin Buu with God Ki, him not knowing isn’t a major issue. Characters like Merus & the rest of Angels have weakness, if they were to fight between good & evil they'd be erased but in vs battles such shouldn’t a problem when different facilities can be given \"hypothetically\" just for the battles.\n\nRead the post, the OP specifically stated \"Majin Buu (Manga)\" which is a different continuity from anime & there’s a lot of manga profiles characters too.\n\n\"Canon\" is entirely a different argument here which has nothing to do with the topic & I was never arguing for it but since you bought it, I'll just say this both DBS anime & manga are canon in it’s own way, because it’s based on Toriyama's draft while both Toei & Toyotarou adds stuff with Tori's approval.

VBW's hypotheticals don't take into account \"if he mastered this\" type deals, note profiles for shounen characters that haven't mastered their abilities yet not getting that.\n\nThat sounds like the manga isn't an official canon\n\nHow does it not sound like official canon when he specifically stated that Toriyama is involved in manga as well?\n\nalready discussed the issue with that, he got bopped by Beerus and again literally nothing implies he got such a tremendous amp and suddenly lost it for innocent buu. VBW's hypotheticals don't take into account \"if he mastered this\" type deals, note profiles for shounen characters that haven't mastered their abilities yet not getting that.\n\nYour example is false,the Buu who got bopped by Beerus is first of all Good Buu(which was obtained by Fat Buu seperating into Good and Evil Buu) not Kid Buu which Elder Kai is talking about and second if all he didn't lose massive amp for Good Buu,some of the god ki power was transferred into Good Buu while most of the god ki power went to evil Buu.Its not about mastering abilites its about Kid Buu already having the power inside him which he never used which should definitely count for DBS manga continuity only.\n\nHow does it not sound like official canon when he specifically stated that Toriyama is involved in manga as well?\n\nYour example is false,the Buu who got bopped by Beerus is first of all Good Buu(which was obtained by Fat Buu seperating into Good and Evil Buu) not Kid Buu which Elder Kai is talking about and second if all he didn't lose massive amp for Good Buu,some of the god ki power was transferred into Good Buu while most of the god ki power went to evil Buu.Its not about mastering abilites its about Kid Buu already having the power inside him which he never used which should definitely count for DBS manga continuity only.\n\nCause it looks like it's split into two separate things thus there's no official canon\n\nI already elaborated on this point, so if you admit there wasn't a massive amp lost you also concede that Buu losing to Beerus kills the scaling. Since it directly requires Buu to be far higher in tier\n\nCause it looks like it's split into two separate things thus there's no official canon\n\nOr maybe that both DBS anime and manga is official canon?\n\nI already elaborated on this point, so if you admit there wasn't a massive amp lost you also concede that Buu losing to Beerus kills the scaling. Since it directly requires Buu to be far higher in tier\n\nI replied to that point so that doesn't matter.How does me admitting that massive amp wasn't lost from Kid Buu when it was transferred from Kid Buu to Good Buu means that I concede that Beerus killing Good Buu kills the scaling? Especially when Good Buu is irrelevant to power of Kid Buu in relation to Beerus? Also Good Buu doesn't know how to use that god ki power until Moro arc so Beerus stomping a weaker Good Buu doesn't disprove anything.\n\nOr maybe that both DBS anime and manga is official canon?\n\nI replied to that point so that doesn't matter.How does me admitting that massive amp wasn't lost from Kid Buu when it was transferred from Kid Buu to Fat Buu means I concede that Beerus killing Good Buu kills the scaling?

If you admit the amp isn't massive you therefore admit him being weakened is irrelevant and debunks nothing. Simple.\n\nAn \"official canon\" is arguing one of the two storylines is the definitive canon you use, so no you can't have both\n\nOfficial canon is simply canon series which is official which in this case is both DBS anime and manga.This wiki uses DBS anime as a definitive primary canon but both are by extension definitive canon so no your point doesn't make sense.\n\nYou replied and refuted absolutely nothing and repeated the same problem I brought out. If you admit the amp isn't massive you therefore admit him being weakened is irrelevant and debunks nothing. Simple.\n\nI replied and refuted your comment entirely which was trying to disprove Kid Buu scaling to Beerus 75 millions years back by bringing up Good Buu being beaten by Beerus and the portion of god ki boost which Good Buu got is small which admittedly doesn't debunk anything.\n\nOfficial canon is simply canon series which is official which in this case is both DBS anime and manga.This wiki uses DBS anime as a definitive primary canon but both are by extension definitive canon so no your point doesn't make sense.\n\nI replied and refuted your comment entirely which was trying to disprove Kid Buu scaling to Beerus 75 millions years back by bringing up Good Buu being beaten by Beerus and the portion of god ki boost which Good Buu got is small which admittedly doesn't debunk anything.\n\nOffical canon isn't simply canon to the series, that's just a canoncity. Two diff things.\n\nYou didn't as I already established above, just saying you did means nothing. 75 million years back for a character that sleeps alot isn't a compelling point, we see no feats of Buu at this level, the one time we see him and Beerus he gets clapped effortlessly and we're basing it off of a statement that Toriyama had to try and find an excuse to add Beerus into.\n\nOffical canon isn't simply canon to the series, that's just a canoncity. Two diff things.\n\nOfficial canon is basically canonical series which officially links with other installments of same series,thats a better definition than what I gave previously.Its basically same thing as canoncity.\n\nYou didn't as I already established above, just saying you did means nothing. 75 million years back for a character that sleeps alot isn't a compelling point, we see no feats of Buu at this level, the one time we see him and Beerus he gets clapped effortlessly and we're basing it off of a statement that Toriyama had to try and find an excuse to add Beerus into.\n\nYes I did,I will even quote it here again.\n\nYour example is false,the Buu who got bopped by Beerus is first of all Good Buu(which was obtained by Fat Buu seperating into Good and Evil Buu) not Kid Buu which Elder Kai is talking about and second if all he didn't lose massive amp for Good Buu,some of the god ki power was transferred into Good Buu while most of the god ki power went to evil Buu.Its not about mastering abilites its about Kid Buu already having the power inside him which he never used which should definitely count for DBS manga continuity only.\n\nYou made no attempts on countering anything I stated there.I can say the same to you ie just because you said I didn't debunk you doesn't mean I actually didn't debunk you.That is again using manga version of DBS where Good Buu(One which has less god ki inherited in him than Kid Buu which is even stronger) was able to outmatch a stronger Moro than Moro who was overpowering SSG Vegeta who is 3-B.Him sleeping alot doesn't mean anything.Also again it was Good Buu who was being clapped by Beerus not Kid Buu and Good Buu didn't use his god ki strength at all.Basically you didn't refute anything I stated but instead repeated the same thing again.\n\nAlso,I am still not sure about applying Elder Kai statement with Toriyama statement when 1 contradiction still exists but thats beside the point now.\n\nOfficial canon is basically canonical series which officially links with other installments of same series,thats a better definition than what I gave previously.Its basically same thing as canoncity.\n\nYes I did,I will even quote it here again.\n\nYou made no attempts on countering anything I stated there.I can say the same to you ie just because you said I didn't debunk you doesn't mean I actually didn't debunk you.That is again using manga version of DBS where Good Buu(One which has less god ki inherited in him than Kid Buu which is even stronger) was able to outmatch a stronger Moro than Moro who was overpowering SSG Vegeta who is 3-B.Him sleeping alot doesn't mean anything.Also again it was Good Buu who was being clapped by Beerus not Kid Buu and Good Buu didn't use his god ki strength at all.Basically you didn't refute anything I stated but instead repeated the same thing again.\n\nAlso,I am still not sure about applying Elder Kai statement with Toriyama statement when 1 contradiction still exists but thats beside the point now.\n\nOfficial canon is basically canonical series would not correlate to when you're attempting to use make two things the official canon, the exact problem.\n\nYou quoted what I already addressed. I really do not care what Moro did, him sleeping a lot means a lot tho cause it directly shows the issue. I repeated myself cause you didn't refute the premise.\n\nSo you're arguing for no reason then basically lol.\n\nOfficial canon is basically canonical series would not correlate to when you're attempting to use make two things the official canon, the exact problem.\n\nI am sorry but I didn't understand the bolded portion of your comment.Mind elaborating it again?\n\nYou quoted what I already addressed. I really do not care what Moro did, him sleeping a lot means a lot tho cause it directly shows the issue. I repeated myself cause you didn't refute the premise.\n\nYou didn't address that comment at all,you basically said the exact same points which I refuted in that quoted comment.You not caring for what Moro did isn't a argument.Saying you dont care for Moro feats just makes your argument of \"But Kid Buu has no 3-B feats\" null.Its a issue becuase he doesn't do his GoD job,how does this relate to here? You basically just repeated something which was refuted already meaning you didn't add anything to your \"rebuttal\".I did address all of your premise which you didn't counter back.\n\nSo you're arguing for no reason then basically lol.\n\nFalse.I am arguing with your arguments which are just wrong way of not scaling Elder Kai statement to Toriyama's interview.\n\nI am sorry but I didn't understand the bolded portion of your comment.Mind elaborating it again?\n\nYou didn't address that comment at all,you basically said the exact same points which I refuted in that quoted comment.You not caring for what Moro did isn't a argument.Saying you dont care for Moro feats just makes your argument of \"But Kid Buu has no 3-B feats\" null.Its a issue becuase he doesn't do his GoD job,how does this relate to here?

It's doesn't make it null at all. You never addressed my premise but I'll allow you to continune believing you did.\n\nIt's not the wrong way at all, not my problem you keep misrepresenting my point."
