        "text": "Dragon Ball Super's episode 118 focused on Piccolo and Gohan facing two of Piccolo's own race the Namekians, while Goku and the Androids battle the remaining Universe 2 warriors.\n\nLast week's episode saw the Androids finally knock out Ribrianne and Rozie, seemingly putting an end to the barrage of \"love\" combat.\n\nThe focus for this episode then went back to Gohan and Piccolo, who have been locked in dual combat with a pair of Namekians from Universe 6, surprised that they can't make a dent on the two.\n\nAs the two are wondering why their opponents are so strong, Piccolo senses the power of a large number of Namekians behind their enemies.\n\nPiccolo then realizes the two have performed \"Namekian Fusion\" repeatedly to increase their power, a process he previously took advantage of to combine with the warrior Nail and his own other half, Kami.\n\nGohan and Piccolo realize that because the two have fused with so many Namekians, they will have to resort to Gohan holding them off while Piccolo charges an old ace move, the Special Beam Cannon.\n\nPiccolo revealed the move back at the start of Dragon Ball Z as his plan to kill Goku, doing so when Goku sacrifices himself so his invading brother Raditz can be killed.\n\nGoku, meanwhile attempts to hold his own against the three remaining warriors of Universe 2, who have become fired up from their precious irritant Ribrianne being eliminated.\n\nThe trio's resolve to uphold their \"love\" views causes them to transform, finally achieving some more real comic relief as they don the same uniforms as Ribrianne's posse, skirts and all.\n\nThe androids arrive to help Goku, who is still pushing himself to go beyond his limits, and show they are more than a match for Universe 2.\n\nThe love warriors reveal a final attack that shocks all, as even Ribrianne's group was unable to achieve it, and Piccolo finds himself losing confidence as he and Gohan take hits.\n\nThis episode, like some others, does a good working off established parts of the show and making reference to other sections.\n\nUntil this point, Piccolo was the only character confirmed to have used \"Namekian Fusion,\" which until now had been nameless, and it was essentially unclear if there were restrictions on which Namekians could fuse.\n\nThe fusion shows how intense and serious these Namekians are, as we see and they state that many of their people volunteered to fuse, disappearing to give their power in an attempt to save their universe.\n\nâ€‹Piccolo's understanding of the technique causes him to doubt himself, and leads to an interesting moment where we see Nail and Kami again, in a sort of pocket of Piccolo's mind.\n\nIt was interesting enough to see these past characters, but a better Easter Egg comes from Piccolo's self-doubt.\n\nWhile Piccolo charges his attack, his doubt distracts him, though Gohan says he himself let his guard down, and the Namekians attack Piccolo with his beam failing.\n\nThis is when Piccolo sees Kami and Nail, and when he comes back to reality, Gohan is standing in front of him, having blocked the attack.\n\nThis mirrors a crucial moment in Dragon Ball history, when Piccolo sacrificed himself to save Gohan from the Saiyan Nappa, Vegeta's former partner.\n\nGohan was a turning point in Piccolo's life, being the first person to show him kindness and cause joy to enter his heart.\n\nPiccolo protecting him was a massive step in his character development from villain to hero, and established further what a close bond he and Gohan have.\n\nThroughout the series, the two have had a familial relationship, and Piccolo has often arrived in the nick of time to save Gohan again.\n\nTo have the situation reversed shows not only the doubt that even Piccolo can have, but also shows Gohan's growth as well as their continued friendship.\n\nThe other Universe 2 warriors finally attacking more and their sudden transformation finally add some good comedy to their group.\n\nWhile there were some entertaining moments with Ribrianne's group, like when Vegeta can't bring himself to touch her because he finds her hideous, they were mainly obvious fodder that only provided comedy by getting knocked around.\n\nThe attempts at comedy through the trio's personalities fell flat, but now it is more entertaining from the flip of having male characters in \"magical girl\" transformations.\n\nThis has been done in anime before, but a more typical thing would be to just have a macho man character be over emotional, whereas here the characters are ridiculous as well as wearing the same ridiculous outfits as their female counterparts.\n\nThere is quite a bit of tension throughout the episode for Universes 2 and 6, as they are on their final warriors.\n\nAs the angels point out, having the weight of their universes does lead to the characters in each fight pulling out all the stops against Universe 7, whose characters, aside from the Androids, are tiring from constant battle.\n\nPower revelations along coupled with this, especially since Goku is so exhausted for sure, leads to the possibility that at least one Universe 7 fighter will take a fall.\n\nAs the episode ends, there are knockouts that lead to some emotional moments, and the tournament gets closer to finishing.\n\nReleased pictures and things said by characters in previous episodes have shown that something strange will happen where an enemy no one can see will attack.\n\nIt will be interesting to finally get to the bottom of this mysterious warrior the characters have been mentioning, and see what he or she can do.\n\nAfter the massive climax of Goku and Kefla's battle in episode 116 of Dragon Ball Super, episode 117 took a step back and focused again on the brother and sister Androids 17 and 18, and Universe 2's warriors of love.\n\nWith Goku again weakened after achieving Ultra Instinct while fighting Kefla, the remaining Universe 2 fighters chose to use the opportunity to knock him out.\n\nThe androids stepped in, however, and led Ribrianne and Rozie away to leave Goku with still three warriors surrounding him.\n\nThe duos split up, with Rozie hoping to avenge Kakunsa by knocking out 17, and Ribrianne soon develops a grudge against 18.\n\nUpon learning that 18 is married to Krillin, she becomes enraged that 18 could love someone who \"isn't beautiful,\" and says she will teach 18 about love.\n\nThe love warriors are quickly outclassed, however, unable to keep up with the ever-serious androids and their combination attacks.\n\nThe two also continue to serve as comic relief even in such a big battle, with 18 occasionally nailing Ribrianne in the face and knocking her into rocks, or 17 and 18 knocking them into each other.\n\nWhen 17 decides he's had enough, he finishes a combination attack by knocking Rozie out of the ring, and 18 causes Ribrianne to revert to her normal Brianne appearance.\n\nBrianne is able, however, to trap 18 in a love-based attack, and the members of universe 2 help her achieve a more powerful version of her Ribrianne form, bringing into question how the fight will truly end.\n\nThe episode was previewed the week prior, and just had me groaning as I noticed the return of Ribrianne and Rozie, and for much of the episode this reaction remained.\n\nThough the writers try to make Ribrianne seem like a real threat, she only serves as annoying one-note comic relief that could have easily been knocked out episodes ago.\n\nShe is only able to do anything this episode due to 18 having an ankle injury, and even then she is constantly thrown around like a rag doll.\n\nIn representing the \"magical girl\" trope in manga, Ribrianne focuses on love, which became annoying soon after she was introduced.\n\nI wanted to bang my head against a wall after the number of times she said \"love\" throughout the episode, and her attitude only became more grating when she learned about 18 and Krillin.\n\nInitially saying she wanted to show everyone \"true love,\" Ribrianne became disgusted at 18 and Krillin, saying that since Krillin \"isn't beautiful,\" they're mocking love.\n\nThough likely intentional to satirize the magical girl trope, her hideous appearance doesn't support her statement, and her hypocrisy shows that she simply wants to be loved, not necessarily understanding it.\n\nThe androids, meanwhile, are always fun to watch, especially from their refreshing reaction to fighting characters where they don't wait for opponents to power up and go all out from the start.\n\nIn an earlier episode when Brianne and her friends first transformed, a highlight for many was when 17 interrupted their tedious sequence with an energy blasted, only to be chastised by everyone else.\n\nThis episode has 17 at his best, clearly not having to try hard while fighting Rozie, and effectively fighting so in sync with 18 that mere glances are enough to know what to do in combination with each other.\n\nMeanwhile, 18, hampered by her leg, still shows why she is one of the Z-Fighters' best, knowing when to strike and when her injury requires that she swap positions with 17.\n\nâ€‹The episode takes a break from focusing on Goku, and though he has been doing some amazing things as of late, it is good to see the others again.\n\nThe androids are two of Universe 7's greatest assets, as they have unlimited stamina and energy, and therefore can be injured, but cannot tire.\n\nFocusing on them was also a pleasing way to ensure that Ribrianne and Rozie would soon be gone, due to them not having the urge to see opponents at full strength.\n\nThough 17 had not been seen prior to the tournament since Cell was defeated, he has quickly become a more popular fan-favorite as he effortlessly demonstrates his strength, ability, and a willingness to knock out anyone who gets in his way.\n\nGoku, meanwhile, is still surrounded by the other Universe 2 fighters, setting up another coming episode where he will be defenseless and need to rely on the others.\n\nThis has some interesting potential to watch for, as the Saiyans benefit from the \"Zenkai,\" or Saiyan power, where recovery from near-death also causes their power to increase; a literal \"What doesn't kill you makes you stronger\" scenario.\n\nGoku needing assistance and the possibility of another power increase for him both have me excited for what is to come.\n\nImage from the Dragon Ball Super fandom Wikipedia.\n\nDragon Ball Super's episode 116 showcased the strengths of Ultra Instinct and the Potara earrings as Goku and Kefla's battle reached a conclusion.\n\nThe previous episode ended as Goku shocked everyone by again achieving Ultra Instinct, and showing that Kefla was once again no match for him.\n\nIn an attempt to rival Goku powering up in Ultra Instinct, Kefla rises to Super Saiyan 2, their combined energy tearing up the tournament even further.\n\nWhile the participants take notice and those watching say the two will destroy everything if they collide, Goku avoids danger by only dodging Kefla's attacks.\n\nWhis notes that the reason Goku is performing so well is because in Ultra Instinct, Goku's body is reacting to everything on its own.\n\nEventually, Goku does counter, but he, Whis, and Kefla notice that his strikes aren't doing much at all.\n\nWhis explains that while Goku's dodging is so effective because he's reacting without thinking, his blows are weak because he is considering each attack before he makes it.\n\nBecause of this and the extreme strain Ultra Instinct is causing, Goku realizes that, as Whis says, he will have to finish Kefla with one attack or he'll lose the form again.\n\nThis episode does a good job working off things previously established, in particular Goku's Ultra Instinct abilities.\n\nIn a previous episode, as Goku and Vegeta trained with Whis, he told them they weren't progressing was because they were thinking before reacting.\n\nVegeta remembers this, and realizes that Goku must be achieving what Whis was training them for, and determines that if Goku can, he can too.\n\nIn another interesting area, we get another peek at Frieza, who is watching nearby and says that he will need Goku to \"keep serving\" him.\n\nThroughout the tournament, Frieza's exact goal has been a mystery, though the one sure thing is that he is planning to betray the group.\n\nRecently he hinted that, like many fans have theorized, he is planning to use the super dragon balls to become more powerful than the angels, and likely the Omni Kings.\n\nFrom the beginning of the tournament, Frieza has taken a backseat, only occasionally choosing opponents to torture, and helping Gohan take out a fighter from Universe 2.\n\nIn terms of the tournament's long battle royale style, the best method would be to rely on others taking out the majority of enemies while saving energy.\n\nVegeta, while taking on his fair share of enemies due to his pride and love for fighting, has been using a similar technique, as opposed to Goku, who has been doing his usual method of letting his enemies reach their peak before going all-out.\n\nThis kind of thinking, combined with his previous fight with Jiren, has left Goku worn out and only able to come back due to Frieza giving him energy.\n\nVegeta's declaration of power possibility gives hope to the fans who has wanted him to have a time to shine.\n\nAt the moment, Vegeta is stuck playing second fiddle as Goku once again keeps the spotlight, but him reaching Ultra Instinct would be interesting.\n\nIf not because he deserves it, Vegeta's new power would be useful in case Goku finally takes a fall.\n\nDuring the fight against Kefla, Jiren again stops meditating, showing his continued interest in Goku's power.\n\nGiven Goku's worn-out state and that Ultra Instinct merely put him on par with Jiren before, it is possible that he could be eliminated.\n\nIf this were the case, Universe 7's strongest two would be Vegeta and Gohan, and while Gohan has been redeemed as of late, it's not safe to say he has returned to his former glory.\n\nIn the past, he was twice the strongest fighter in the universe, when he reached Super Saiyan 2 and when, after seven years of not training, Elder Kai unlocked his potential.\n\nSince then, he had again stopped training, even telling Master Roshi that he was just \"pretty sure\" he could still become Super Saiyan.\n\nVegeta, meanwhile, has not just continued training; he has, like Goku, achieved Super Saiyan Blue, a form with godly power.\n\nIn one of the best moments, we also witness a new variation of the Kamehameha, in one of Goku's most creative and visually stunning versions of his signature technique since he combined it with his Instantaneous Transmission while fighting Cell.\n\nWhile not everything else to come seems as exciting, considering the preview after the episode, the future of the Saiyans and the tournament becomes more interesting as time runs down.\n\nImage from the Dragon Ball Super fandom Wikipedia.\n\nThe newest Dragon Ball Super, 115, continued Goku's difficult battle against the newly born fusion of Caulifla and Kale, Kefla.\n\nDue to Goku still lacking stamina, he if occasionally caught off caught by how fast and strong Kefla is, though he thankfully holds his own.\n\nBeerus quickly declares that Kefla should be disqualified for using the Potara fusion, and states that he wouldn't have his warriors do the same.\n\nDespite the initial rule of no items during the tournament, the Omni Kings, Zen-Oh, then ask why Beerus wouldn't want to, because it's cool, allowing it for further use.\n\nWhile Beerus might not like it, the use of items isn't entirely unfair against Universe 7, as Master Roshi was required jars for his \"Mafuba,\" or \"Evil Containment Wave.\"\n\nThe technique sucks an enemy into a small jar, where they can then be contained unless the jar is opened, and the Zen-Ohs allowed it for being \"neat.\"\n\nThe Supreme Kai of Universe 2 then tossed his Potara earrings to two of his warriors, but a charging Kefla knocks them apart before they can fuse, causing the earrings to collide and shatter.\n\nSupreme Kai suggests a fusion between Androids 17 and 18, which they would then call Android 35, but Beerus decides fusion is too risky because one fusion being knocked out would cost them two warriors.\n\nMeanwhile, 17 saved 18 from Universe 3's police warrior Katopesla, who changes his sights from Frieza when he noticed 18's injured leg.\n\nThe focus soon returns to Goku and Kefla, however, as the remaining gods decide they don't need to use fusion to win the tournament.\n\nGoku is eventually forced to use his combination of Super Saiyan Blue and Kaioken x20, or King Kai Fist x20.\n\nGoku has used the technique since his first revival early in the series, having learned it from King Kai.\n\nThe Kaioken multiplies a fighter's power in a burst of strength, at the cost of extra strain on the user's body, working in multipliers the user can overcome with time.\n\nTypical for his style, Goku has pushed the technique too far in the past, when x3 almost left him crippled against Vegeta and he tried to finish Frieza with a x20.\n\nIn a filler episode, Goku attempted to combine his Super Saiyan form with Kaioken against the warrior Pikkon, stating afterward he wouldn't again because the strain of both Super Saiyan and Kaioken together was almost too much.\n\nDespite this proclamation, Goku revealed the Super Saiyan Blue Kaioken when he previously fought Toppo, saying it was his plan for fighting Beerus.\n\nDue to the power but Goku's lack of stamina, he is able to land a few good blows on Kefla, but is soon knocked down when the strain becomes too much.\n\nWith no energy left but his battle excitement pushing him to his limits, Goku again achieves \"Ultra Instinct,\" which Whis says he didn't think would happen again, and the battle between Goku and Kefla begins anew.\n\nThe episode serves as a good way to showcase both Kefla's new power along with Goku's existing power but obvious exhaustion.\n\nThe show continues to remind us that Goku is tired from fighting Jiren, as a way of explaining Kefla's ability to match the more seasoned warrior's most powerful forms.\n\nOne area of concern is Vegeta's current battle against Toppo, who has said it seems to be the second-most powerful warriors from their respective universes going at it.\n\nFans have been begging the writers to give Vegeta a moment to shine as he deserves, often disappointed when he seems to be doing something great, only for Goku or someone else to finish the job.\n\nThis happened previously in what I saw as one of the greatest moments thus far in Super: Vegeta fighting Goku Black.\n\nBlack, really the Kai Zamasu in Goku's body, had defeated the Z-Fighters multiple times with his partner, and alternate Zamasu in his own body, in their attempt to destroy all mortal lives.\n\nAfter training for a few days in the Hyperbolic Time Chamber, which compresses a year's worth of training into a day, Vegeta challenged Black with new resolve.\n\nBoth Black and Zamasu were shocked by Vegeta's sudden strength, as Vegeta overwhelms and pummels Black.\n\nIn an incredibly powerful moment, Vegeta states that Black isn't as good as them because he's merely a non-Saiyan who can't use Goku's body to its fullest, and lifts him by the hair to headbutt him.\n\nWhile it seemed Vegeta had found his moment, he is swiftly dispatched by a power boost from Black, and in the end it falls to Trunks to save everyone.\n\nWith the tournament, Vegeta has been taking out many enemies and doesn't seem too drained, but he continues to be distracted by Goku and Kefla's battle.\n\nThis leads to Toppo hitting him and, most recently, getting him in a bear grip, which Vegeta eventually gets out of.\n\nVegeta constantly not paying attention to his own battle seems out of character, regardless of Goku and Kefla's strength.\n\nHe seems foolish and his full abilities aren't showcased as they should be.\n\nWhile the main excitement for the moment is Goku's return to Ultra Instinct and Jiren stirring once more, Vegeta will hopefully get his own moments in future episodes.\n\nImage from the Dragon Ball Super fandom Wikipedia.\n\nIn Dragon Ball Super's latest episode, 114, Caulifla and Kale give Goku a beating and force him to power up, revealing their trump card to him along the way.\n\nIn the previous episode, Goku was caught off guard by how quickly Kale adapted to a martial arts style and Kale's ability to combo fight alongside her.\n\nIn the end, Kale's passion and desire to help Kale caused her to transform into her Berserk Super Saiyan form.\n\nAs this episode kicks off, Kale seems to not recognize Caulifla, but gains total control of her power after Caulifla reminds her of who she is.\n\nThe duo then takes on Goku again, quickly overwhelming him as he discovers that they are beginning to predict his movements.\n\nThis leaves Goku without his Instantaneous Transmission technique, and when he falls into a smokescreen trap they laid, he finds Kale grappling as Caulifla pummels him.\n\nWhile he is able to fight back at times with Super Saiyan 2, Goku decides to step things beyond what Caulifla wanted, and becomes Super Saiyan God rather than 3.\n\nAgain too much for the two to handle, Goku is able to consistently knock Kale away and hammer into Caulifla, who falls to her knees.\n\nGoku destroys the section of the ring the two are standing on, causing them to fall, but Caulifla decides it is time for them to use a secret item they brought with them.\n\nIn a flash of light, the two re-enter the ring as one after merging with the Potara earrings, becoming Kefla.\n\nDespite still being in his God form, Goku again has his hands full, as Kefla bursts past him faster than he can see, giving him a quick hit as well.\n\nThe episode continues with more power and skill issues as well as some interesting situations that haven't been presented before now.\n\nA main problem with the episode is how quickly Kale is able to take control of her full Berserk form, as well as her ability to fight in combination with Caulifla and overwhelm Goku.\n\nCaulifla's adaptation and ability have been explained already due to her fighting experience coupling with her ferocious prodigal nature.\n\nKale, on the other hand, had little, if any, real fighting experience, and was always too scared to take anyone on.\n\nBecause of this, the beautiful animation and fighting that takes place is questioned as Goku, a prodigy and tactical warrior himself who has trained with a god and an angel, is constantly caught off-guard.\n\nKefla's reveal presents an interesting situation, as previously there had only been five canon fusions with the Potara earrings in the series.\n\nThe earrings come from the Kais, the kings of different sections of their respective universes, and fuse two people when each puts on one earring of a pair.\n\nAccording to the angel Vados, the resulting fusion is more powerful than the sum of the two involved, with power increased by \"tens of times.\"\n\nIn the past, Goku learned of the earrings when he met Elder Kai, who unwillingly fused with a witch years before.\n\nAs a demonstration, the Supreme Kai and his assistant, Kibito, each took off one of their earrings, and fused into Kibito Kai.\n\nGoku took two earrings to fight Majin Buu, who had exterminated human life, planning to fuse with his son Gohan.\n\nWhen fell through after Buu absorbed Gohan, Goku instead fused with Vegeta, who had temporarily returned from the dead, creating Vegito.\n\nMore recently, the villainous Zamasu and his alternate universe counterpart, in Goku's body, fused, and Goku and Vegeta fused once more as a counter.\n\nPrior to Dragon Ball Super, it was believed that this fusion was permanent, with the mystery of why Vegito defused after he let himself be absorbed.\n\nWhen Goku and Vegeta fused again to fight Zamasu, however, the Kai Gowasu explained that if the fusion doesn't involve a Kai, it only lasts one hour, and this limit decreases if the fusion uses too much energy.\n\nThe earrings definitely present controversial situations, as their power will cause a massive boost to both Kale and Caulifla's massive strengths, with past use of the earrings caused characters to spring past enemies in power, and items are supposed to not be allowed in the tournament.\n\nThe use of Potara as an item breaks the rules initially set, but it would be unfair to immediately disqualify the characters as a result.\n\nUniverse 7's Master Roshi has been using small jars for his \"Mafuba,\" or Evil Containment Wave, and the Omni King declared that \"it's neat, so it's safe.\"\n\nAt the same time, Goku was in his God form when Kefla was created, a form which he previously used to be on par with Beerus, Universe 7's God of Destruction.\n\nEven this could be explained, however, as it took a lot out of Goku to fight Jiren, and he has said multiple times that he has not yet fully recovered from the battle.\n\nKefla's entry also has potential for at least one future battle, if Goku doesn't knock her or her components off the ring.\n\nPrior to fusing, Kale controlling her Berserk form got a reaction from Vegeta, and seemed to get one from Jiren, who has hardly moved throughout the tournament aside from when he fought Goku.\n\nWhen Kefla later charges Goku, Vegeta again reacts, this time becoming distracted and taking a hit from Jiren's ally Toppo.\n\nGoku also mentions as she is attacking that he can't sense a limit to her energy, despite the enemies and sparring partners he has had in the past.\n\nWith both Vegeta and Jiren noticing Kale and Kefla's power, there is a chance for another huge battle to come as long as Goku doesn't successfully eliminate Kale and Caulifla.\n\nCaulifla and Kale took center stage this week on Dragon Ball Super's episode 113 with a fight against an exhausted Goku.\n\nLast week's episode saw Cabba gain confidence after a speech from Vegeta and knock out Universe 4's Monna.\n\nDespite reaching Super Saiyan 2 to do so, however, Cabba found himself out of the ring when Frieza approached him.\n\nIn an effort to make up for Universe 6 losing both Hit and Cabba, Caulifla decides that she wants Goku to teach her how to achieve Super Saiyan 3.\n\nGoku says he hasn't yet built up the stamina to sustain Super Saiyan 3, and faces Caulifla's Super Saiyan 2 form without transforming.\n\nTaking Caulifla through some of the basics of martial arts and more common techniques like afterimage, Goku slowly teaches Caulifla how to be a martial artist rather than a straight brawler.\n\nCaulifla manages to get some hits in as they continue, but it becomes clear that, along with being weakened from his fight with Jiren, Goku is using the fight as an opportunity to train Caulifla.\n\nGoku eventually progresses to Super Saiyan 2, saying he still doesn't have the energy for his third form, and invites Kale to join the battle as well.\n\nKale joins in with her bulky Super Saiyan form, at first seemingly overwhelming Goku with dual-combat tactics, until Goku shows he hardly has to try to hold them off.\n\nUnlike the battles in some episodes, much of the fighting between the Saiyans is shown entirely, rather than just having the characters move too fast for the eye to see by showing blurs and occasional shapes.\n\nWith Goku clearly holding back to train the female Saiyans, the fight is impressive simply for how often the characters go blow for blow.\n\nThe negative aspects of the episode come from contradictions and the issue of quick powering up that has been a complaint since the new Saiyans were introduced.\n\nWhile Caulifla might be a prodigy, Whis calls her a street fighter early in the fight, as she lacks the intensive training of a true martial artist like Goku.\n\nWith less training and power than the Universe 7 Saiyans, it has been a source of irritations for some fans that Cabba, Caulifla and Kale were so qiuckly able to achieve Super Saiyan forms.\n\nThe first transformation was initially introduced as requiring a great warrior with an enraged heart, and has since become a plaything for Vegeta's son and Goku's youngest, and was unlocked for Caulifla when she simply focused her energy in her back.\n\nCaulifla has continued the trend of quickly reaching states that used to be a big deal, as she advances to the flawed muscular Super Saiyan form the Universe 7 characters achieved and abandoned during their battles against Cell.\n\nAfter learning of the problems with the form, Caulifla is immediately able to power up to Super Saiyan 2 after Goku shows her the form, which in the past was a terrifyingly emotional form Gohan reached that dwarfed everyone else.\n\nCaulifla's constant use of Super Saiyan 2 is a contradiction to the issue of stamina that characters have long pointed out for transformations, even as recently as with Frieza's golden form and Caulifla's muscular form.\n\nAs Vegeta and Goku pointed out in these instances, the respective characters had just achieved new power that quickly drained stamina and was bad for drawn out fights.\n\nThis issue has existed as far back as even the original form, which initially took great effort for each Saiyan to achieve and put incredible stress on the body.\n\nDespite this, Caulifla seems perfectly fine as she continues to use Super Saiyan 2, simply taking an occasional break but never seeming to truly tire.\n\nLikewise, Kale contradicts the issue of non-polished fighting skills being not enough to take on Goku.\n\nWhen Whis calls Caulifla a brawler, he states that Goku's martial arts skills allow him to predict his opponent and make appropriate reactions to every move in a way that a non-trained fighter wouldn't be able to.\n\nDue to her prodigal nature, Caulifla is quickly able to adapt her fighting experience as Goku trains her.\n\nKale, on the other hand, merely has raw power and little fighting experience due to her timid attitude, making it strange when she manages expert maneuvers not just alone, but in combination with Caulifla.\n\nThough the new Saiyans face issues with continuity in the world's rules, there is an interesting aspect to them training under Goku and Vegeta.\n\nCabba is similar to Gohan with his relaxed nature and reluctance to fight, which contrasts with Vegeta's hotheadedness.\n\nHaving Vegeta as his master is a good way for Cabba to get past the weaker aspects of his personality and learn to be a more ferocious fighter.\n\nOn the other hand, Caulifla is similar to Vegeta with her great temper, so she can learn to focus her natural talent and raw strength by training with the calm and happy Goku.\n\nAs Kale is so often scared and wants to follow Caulifla, it also makes sense for her to learn from Goku, who can potentially taunt and push her in the right ways to use her latent anger and strength to reach her full potential.\n\nThe episode can be slightly frustrating with inconsistencies and Caulifla and Kale matching Goku's power, but is overall entertaining.\n\nAt the very least, Caulifla and Kale's characterization and potential make them more interesting episode subjects than Ribrianne, who has yet to be knocked from the stage.\n\nAs the characters also get quite a bit of development in the episode, 113 works effectively like the previous one as a way to calm down from the bigger fights and flesh out some side characters.\n\nNext week's episode is teased with an image which appeared to be a fusion between Caulifla and Kale, which got me immediately excited for what is to come.\n\nImage from the Dragon Ball Super fandom Wikipedia.\n\nAs of October 20, Pokemon Go has been updated to have a \"Trick-or-Treat\" event that will last until November 2.\n\nThe event causes ghost-type Pokemon and others with spooky designs to appear more to players.\n\nAccording to an article on Gamespot's website, this includes Cubone and Houndour, ghosts Gastly and Misdreavus and the newly introduced Sableye, Shuppet and Duskull.\n\nOther event bonuses include doubled candy rewards, special items available in the shop, a Halloween Pikachu and a hat of the Pokemon Mimikyu.\n\nWith Sableye, Shuppet and Duskull involved, Niantic is also introducing the third generation of Pokemon from the series' Hoenn region and Ruby, Sapphire and Emerald games.\n\nThis update comes only months after the second generation was added back in February, which some might see as moving too quickly.\n\nIn an article on the Forbes website, writer Paul Tassi said the new Pokemon suffer from lack of popular awareness that even non-Pokemon fans had of the originals.\n\nWhile everyone knows Pikachu and Charizard, he said, those not as familiar with later Pokemon will not be as excited to raise a Nosepass or Zigzagoon.\n\nAt the same time, there are likely still other areas of the game that could be improved or aspects that could be added before a whole generation of Pokemon are needed.\n\nThe game's combat system is rather simplistic and suffers from lag issues and the possibility of stronger moves not working if the player's Pokemon is attacked while using them.\n\nThe Halloween event will also bring in the \"shiny\" forms of different Pokemon, called so because they differ in color from their usual forms.\n\nThis update likely could have raised excitement for the game without adding a whole new group of Pokemon, and adding not just these Pokemon, but also alternate forms of Pokemon, might cause bugs that need to be fixed later.\n\nWhile games have long had buggy problems, it's common for current games with massive multiplayer is recurring glitches and bugs that get little attention before creators move on to adding new content.\n\nOne such game is Dead by Daylight, where some players still come across glitches as they play that range from momentary goofiness to lobby breaking.\n\nThis includes getting stuck in objects, being launched into the air and leaving the map's boundaries rather than escaping in the end, which some YouTubers and streamers compile into videos, like player OchiDO.\n\nIf Niantic hopes to retain excitement for Pokemon Go, creators need to make sure they balance adding new things to the game with maintenance and improving existing content.\n\nWhile there might still be issues with the game, I for one am excited for the event, as it gives me the opportunity to catch Pokemon I don't see as often.\n\nThe chance to catch a special witch-hat-wearing Pikachu is also enticing, and possibly getting a new silly hat like my avatar's current Magikarp one is an entertaining idea.\n\nImage from the Pokemon Go Live website.\n\nDragon Ball Super took a break this week from the extreme action previously shown with Goku and Jiren to focus on the Saiyans of Universe 6.\n\nLast week's episode ended with Jiren knocking out Hit of Universe 6 and sitting to meditate, as without his new \"Ultra Instinct,\" even Goku stands no chance against Jiren.\n\nWithout Hit, Universe 6 now lacks its strongest fighter, with everything left to mild-mannered Cabba, angry Caulifla and timid Kale.\n\nThe trio has the potential to save their universe, being an alternate version of the race of warriors Goku and Vegeta come from, the Saiyans, but they each have problems standing in the way.\n\nThough bred for fighting, the Saiyans of Universe 6 are less aware of their full potential, with Vegeta and Goku serving as their introduction to the \"Super Saiyan\" transformation.\n\nWhile Caulifla has the same ferocity as Goku and Vegeta, her anger leads to her picking fights she can't win and wasting energy like when she fought Goku.\n\nOn the other hand, Cabba is too cautious, similar to Gohan, which leads to him falling behind from lack of confidence.\n\nKale has the raw power of an extreme Super Saiyan form, but is always afraid and has only occasional control over her strength.\n\nUniverse 6's Destroyer God Champa decides he wants his fighters to hide and last out the tournament, but Caulifla charges in to fight Universe 4's Monna.\n\nCaulifla intends to protect Kale, but Cabba flies in to stop her, saying he will fight because she needs to regain her stamina.\n\nThough he talks big, Cabba is quickly shown to be no match for Monna, who expands into a ball-like form and pummels him.\n\nCabba is soon blown off the tournament ring, but Vegeta steps in to save him and blasts Monna away.\n\nAfter punishing Cabba for his lack of Saiyan pride and almost being knocked off, Vegeta tells him to fight with all he has.\n\nVegeta says that if he wins, which would lead to the Omni-Kings, the most powerful beings in existence, erasing the losing Universes, he will use the Super Dragon Balls to bring back Universe 6.\n\nCabba again challenges Monna, and quickly becomes enraged as she taunts him, calling Vegeta a coward and saying she will defeat him, Caulifla and Kale.\n\nCabba's anger soon overflows and causes him to transform beyond Super Saiyan for the first time, into a Super Saiyan 2.\n\nWhile this goes on, Goku attempts to survive the sudden onslaught of Universe 4 that began when they noticed he is exhausted.\n\nEpisode 112 was a good way to calm things down from the the excitement of Ultra Instinct.\n\nIt is good to meter out the high action points, and as the tournament is only halfway done, viewers need the occasional break.\n\nCabba's battle against Monna is a good source of character development, with Cabba finding his inner strength and pride.\n\nSimilarly, fans will note the continued strong change in Vegeta from his initial villainous character to one of Earth's greatest heroes.\n\nVegeta's decision to revive Universe 6 if given the chance is a complete turnaround from when he arrived on Earth with the intent to kill all its inhabitants.\n\nAnother positive aspect of the episode is the complete lack of the irritant Ribrianne and her lackey Rozie, who would only drag things down with their attempted comedic relief.\n\nAs the tournament winds down, fans can be assured that weaker characters will be given their own progression before being taken out to make room for a massive final confrontation."
