        "text": "The \"first\" form we see of Buu's is when Babidi finally succeeds in resurrecting him. When Buu appears, Babidi is in complete shock, but Kaiôshin is fearful for his life. Why would Babidi be at such a loss, while Kaiôshin cannot seem to overcome his fear? Babidi seems to think that something went wrong during the resurrection process. That's not quite true, but there is more to the story of Majin Buu...\n\nIn this first \"fat\" form, Buu is really just an innocent child with an insane amount of power. Buu doesn't quite understand the concept of \"right\" and \"wrong,\" but instead just wants to have fun and have a friend! Death and destruction are his ways of having fun, until told to stop by Mr. Satan (because he is just a nice guy that honestly tried to befriend Majin Buu! *snicker*... yeah, right!).\n\nNOTES: FIRST APPEARS...\n\nDBZ Episode 232; Manga Chapter 460\n\n\"Fat\" Majin Buu; incredibly strong, easily persuaded, with a childlike innocence.\n\nWhen the \"Evil\" Buu eats the \"Fat\" Buu cookie, the result is a tall, skinny (but buff) \"Super\" Buu. This Buu speaks a lot more than the previous two forms, and seems to enjoy cracking his neck quite a bit. He is extremely impatient (even more so than \"Fat\" Buu was), and won't hesitate to not only let you know verbally, but let you know with violence.\n\n\"Super\" Buu desires to fight the strongest adversary that can be found. When he is promised such a fighter, he actually (willingly) chooses to wait and fight this person!\n\nThis fighter is actually the fusion of Goten and Trunks, Gotenks; the two boys are training / sleeping in the Room of Spirit and Time). Buu is unable to wait the full time necessary for the boys to prepare, and begins to go a little crazy. Wasting no time killing every single last human being on Earth (with the exception of Mr. Satan; the \"Fat\" Buu inside of him still seems to have some power over his mind), Buu demands Piccolo take him to the fighter. Piccolo leads Buu (the long way!) to the Room of Spirit and Time to fight Gotenks.\n\nBuu is much stronger than Gotenks in regular Super Saiyan form, but does make the mistake of allowing a few attacks to connect (such as the \"Super Ghost Kamikaze Attack\") that do quite a bit of damage to him. While SSJ3 Gotenks is clearly stronger than this \"Super\" Buu, Buu (unfortunately) comes up with a plan, and Gotenks becomes absorbed!\n\nNOTES: FIRST APPEARS...\n\nDBZ Episode 255; Manga Chapter 485\n\nWhen \"Evil\" Buu eats the \"Fat\" Buu cookie, the result is a tall, thin (but incredibly buff) \"Super\" Buu. \"Super\" Buu enjoys cracking his neck, is extremely impatient, and desires to fight the strongest foe, no matter what it takes in order to do so.\n\nWhen \"Super\" Buu is unable to defeat Gohan (and is, in fact, quite outclassed by Gohan's new \"Mystic\" power-up from Old Kaiôshin!), he takes matters into his own hands, and begins to absorb the other fighters. First on the list is Gotenks!\n\nBuu surrounds Gotenks with part of his body that has been ripped off, and brings it back to his main body, completely absorbing the fighter. In this new form, Majin Buu's power increases even more than before. In addition, the antenna on his head grows in length (due to Gotenks' SSJ3 form and its long hair). Buu even adapts some of Gotenks's moves in this form (such as the \"Super Ghost Kamikaze Attack\" that hit him, earlier, now featuring mini ghost Buus!). Buu doesn't stop with Gotenks, though...\n\nNOTES: FIRST APPEARS...\n\nDBZ Episode 265; Manga Chapter 499\n\nWhen \"Super\" Buu absorbs Gotenks, his antenna grows a great deal down his back, and he wears a fusion vest. Buu can also use Gotenks's attacks, including the \"Super Ghost Kamikaze Attack.\"\n\nFearful of Gohan and his new-found power, Buu opts to go after Piccolo, as well as Gohan. This is actually an interesting choice (not to mention a perfect one) on Buu's part; why not go after one of the most intelligent fighters in the entire series? Time after time, Piccolo had demonstrated that while he's not always the most powerful, his fighting techniques and incredible displays of intelligence during battles have allowed him to go head to head with even the toughest foes (IE - Cell Jr.).\n\nBuu actually remains the same as his Gotenks form, even after absorbing Piccolo, until the fusion time runs out. It is only here that the fusion vest disappears and he is left with Piccolo's outfit. Despite the physical form of Gotenks taking precedence, Buu does seem to exhibit traits of Piccolo immediately after absorbing him (such as a somewhat different, more \"noble\" way of speaking, and by the way he mentally toys with Gohan). Note that when Goku and Vegeta are absorbed by Buu, Goten and Trunks have their own individual pods within Buu (which is why this cannot be classified as a \"Gotenks\" absorption, per say). Buu's power does not necessary increase by much, but of course, his intelligence goes up a notch.\n\nNOTES: FIRST APPEARS...\n\nDBZ Episode 267; Manga Chapter 502\n\nNote that this absorption takes place in episode 265 / chapter 499, but this specific form of Buu (with Piccolo's outfit) appears in the numbers listed above. When \"Super\" Buu absorbs Piccolo, his looks remain the same until Gotenks's fusion time runs out. At this point, Buu wears Piccolo's cape. In this form, Buu now has the strength of Gotenks plus the fighting intelligence of Piccolo.\n\nWhen Goku arrives back on the scene, ready to fuse with Gohan to create an ultimate fighter, Buu knows he has to, again, take measures into his own hands. Buu absorbs Gohan, leaving Goku with only Mr. Satan and Dende to choose from!\n\nIn this form, Buu loses Piccolo's cape and the fusion vest, choosing to wear Gohan's orange gi, instead. The long antenna stays on his head, though. Power? Through the roof! With the \"Fat\" Majin Buu, Gotenks, Piccolo, and now Gohan as his disposable... Majin Buu almost seems like he would be an undefeatable foe! Goku's got something up his sleeve, though, when Vegeta returns to the battlefield... the fusion earrings are still good! Goku and Vegeta fuse into Vegetto, who is more than a match for Majin Buu, even with all his new strength. Majin Buu turns Vegetto into candy, but the world's strongest coffee candy still packs a wallop! Buu even tries to infect Vegetto, but it's no use... Vegetto is too strong. What's left to do? Try absorbing Vegetto, of course! Vegetto lets himself be absorbed, but puts up a barrier before completely going in.\n\nWhen Vegetto lands inside of Majin Buu, the fusion of Vegetto is torn apart back into Goku and Vegeta. Goku and Vegeta begin to tear apart the friends and family absorbed, when they come across... \"Fat\" Majin Buu! Once everyone is ripped out, and they all escape through a pore, Buu begins to undergo his strangest transformation, yet!\n\nNOTES: FIRST APPEARS...\n\nDBZ Episode 267; Manga Chapter 502\n\n\"Super\" Buu goes after Gohan, next. In this form, Buu completely has rid himself of the fusion vest and Piccolo's cape, keeping only the SSJ3 hair length antenna. He now wears Gohan's orange gi."
