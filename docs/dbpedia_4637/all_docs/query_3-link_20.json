        "text": "You're shitting me right? Please tell me you're joking here.\n\nMr. Buu managed to keep up with Kid Buu far better than Vegeta could.\n\nMr. Buu is easily as strong as a High Tier SSJ2 to Low Tier SSJ3, there's no denying that.\n\nNo he didn't. If you mean Buu took a better ass whooping than Vegeta, then maybe but that has more to do with his genetic make up than his raw power.\n\nHe is not \"low tier\" SSJ3. Kid Buu and Evil Buu aren't even as strong as someone in SSJ3, how the heck could Mr.Buu be near an SSJ3?\n\nguys we forget that there base power lvl also increase so base buu saga goku should be way stronger then base cell saga, lets say goku power lvl was 10 in cell saga then, ssj1 is x50 so 500 then ssj2 is times x2 or w/e which is 1000 then ssj3 is 4 which is 4000. lets say buu saga base goku has a power lvl of 15, ssj1=750, ssj2=1500, ssj3=6000 which is a big increase in power so goku ssj form is almost as powerful as his ssj 2 would be in the cell saga ( this is just an idea not a real estimate)\n\nWe can't use powerlevels to gauge strength because its too inconsistent and doesn't make sense.\n\nIf a one handed SSJ2 Gohan who was not even fresh could do it after releasing his full power then someone whose above SSJ2s even stronger ones like Goku and Vegeta would do far worse.\n\nNo they wouldn't. When in extreme situations(his Kamehameha-duel with Cell being one of them), Gohan was always able to perform feats of strength much greater than Goku's and Vegeta's(the power he used to hurt Raditz when he was a mere baby, or the power he used to kick Super Buu's ass, are two examples). Gohan allways had a hidden power and IIRC he used it against Cell(with the moral support of Goku's spirit).\n\nEven if Gohan had only one arm, his Kamehameha was still stronger than any SSJ2's Kamehameha, due to this hidden power contained inside him.\n\nThe fact he was able to destroy Cell(a SSJ2-level enemy) is proof of that.\n\nWe have no evidence that Mr. Buu, a SSJ2-level enemy, have the same power that Gohan demonstrated in that Kamehameha-duel.\n\nBesides, Cell can't put Buu down while Buu could candy beam him or absorb him as well.\n\nI agree.\n\nIn the end Buu will probably win, I know that. I just wanted to point out that Cell can grow stronger than Buu himself, if Buu doesn't end the fight quickly.\n\nNo they wouldn't. When in extreme situations(his Kamehameha-duel with Cell being one of them), Gohan was always able to perform feats of strength much greater than Goku's and Vegeta's(the power he used to hurt Raditz when he was a mere baby, or the power he used to kick Super Buu's ass, are two examples). Gohan allways had a hidden power and IIRC he used it against Cell(with the moral support of Goku's spirit)\n\nI already know Gohan has special potential but Vegeta pretty much says Goku is stronger than Gohan when he fought Cell, unless I'm confusing the anime version. Yes Gohan could have been stronger than any SSJ2 at that point, SSJ2 could have just been Gohan tapping into his potential before Toriyama decided to continue with Buu saga and depush Gohan as the hero. This really does just depend on Vegeta's statement whether you choose to believe him or not.\n\nEven if Gohan had only one arm, his Kamehameha was still stronger than any SSJ2's Kamehameha, due to this hidden power contained inside him.\n\nThe fact he was able to destroy Cell(a SSJ2-level enemy) is proof of that\n\nAnd all SSJ2s are equal? But I agree he did tap into some hidden power.\n\nWe have no evidence that Mr. Buu, a SSJ2-level enemy, have the same power that Gohan demonstrated in that Kamehameha-duel\n\nYou're right, there is no evidence just a statement from Vegeta about Goku's power when he goes SSJ2. Again this pretty much falls on a character statement, such arguments are usually easy to destroy if you can disprove the character as bluffing or not knowing what they're talking about. Vegeta knowing Gohan's power from experience and comparing it to his rival is not that easy to ignore.\n\nIn the end Buu will probably win, I know that. I just wanted to point out that Cell can grow stronger than Buu himself, if Buu doesn't end the fight quickly.\n\nCell won't get a Zenkai if he gets candy beamed or absorbed which are far more likely to happen."
