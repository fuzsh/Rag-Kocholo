        "text": "Akira Toriyama’s Dragon Ball inspired countless manga artists to create many of the series that would later become animes that we love today. Toriyama’s series had everything you could possibly need: action, romance, humor, and tragedy. Whether you are a fan of the original Dragon Ball series or you prefer the newer Dragon Ball Super series, there is no denying that he created some of the very best characters in all of manga and anime. In honor of his genius, let's take a look at five of the best Dragon Ball characters. WARNING!! Contains spoilers for the Dragon Ball universe!!\n\nThe Dragon Ball universe has some of the best villains in all of manga and anime. One of the best things about the villains is that many of them evolve and end up becoming part of the central group of characters. Buu is easily my favorite of the villains from the universe because of the juxtaposition of his character traits. He is the strongest villain they have faced up to that point, and is so powerful that even the Supreme Kai is afraid of him. Yet he is also one of the sweetest and most kind characters when he is in his innocent form. I also really enjoyed how his character literally evolved into different forms throughout his villain saga.\n\nRELATED:\n\nI don’t know what there isn't to love about King Kai! He is a super powerful being that also just wants to exist on his little planet at the end of Snake Way, drive his vintage car, and tell jokes. Watching King Kai train the different members of the Z Fighters as they die is pretty cool. Some of his best moments are when he is watching what is happening on Earth and different planets and doing his best to communicate with the fighters still alive to tell them what they need to do next. His kindness and willingness to help them is one of the best things about him. Also, how can you not love a character who will only agree to train you if you can make him laugh?\n\nPiccolo is an example of a Dragon Ball villain that is reformed and becomes a part of the central group. When he is first introduced in the original series, he is King Piccolo, an ancient evil villain that wants to rule the world and kills anyone that gets in his way. After he is defeated by young Goku, he reincarnates as Piccolo Jr., who ends up becoming the Master of Goku’s son Gohan after Goku is killed. He is easily one of the best characters because he takes on a father-style role before he and Goku have become friends, and he continues this role for Gohan through the rest of the series. Even after Gohan is grown and has a child, he still looks to Piccolo. I love the complexity of this character, especially when his past is revealed!\n\n2. Young Goku\n\nI have to specify that, while Goku is one of my favorite characters, I am only referring to Goku from the original series. In that setting, Goku is an innocent and naive kid/teenager who just wants to search for the Dragon Balls, train in martial arts, eat food, and help people. He is absolutely hysterical and has the purest heart of any character I have ever seen. Unfortunately, this all changes in Dragon Ball Z. He stays himself for part of the series and does his best to be a good dad to Gohan, but by the end of the series and into Dragon Ball Super, he sems to become a jerk who doesn’t care about his family at all. I love younger Goku, and I am hoping in the new Dragon Ball Daima we might get him back!\n\nThere is no argument that can change my mind about Bulma being the best character in all of anime and manga. She is sassy, smart, and absolutely hysterical. In the original series, Bulma is young and just wants to find the Dragon Balls so that she can wish for the perfect boyfriend. As the show evolves, we get to see her evolve into an absolute powerhouse who not only protects those she loves, but is also responsible for pretty much all of the tech that they use. She took a little bit of a backseat in Dragon Ball Super since she was pregnant, but I am hoping that we will get to see her attitude come out more in the next series!\n\nThe Dragon Ball series and many of the movies are available to stream on CrunchyRoll.\n\nREAD NEXT:"
