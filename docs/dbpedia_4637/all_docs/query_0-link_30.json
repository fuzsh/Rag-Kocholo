        "text": "Most of the time, anime fans tend to have one universal reaction to live action: vomit and fear. That hasn’t stopped the industry from trying – over and over again – to bring these outrageous stories to the big screen. Sadly, even with semi-successes like Ghost In The Shell and Nana fans still treat these announcements roughly the same.\n\nBut there’s also a part of us that, deep down, really want to see an anime live-action film do well. Sure, we have a backlog of horrendous titles that make hope rather slim, but we also have a handful of good examples that tell us there is gold to be found here. Maybe that’s why this particular year has been flush with announcements for live action versions of well-loved animes.\n\nI don’t have high hopes for this one\n\nSo with this giant rush of films that may or may not take a nosedive, I racked my brain and the internet for anime I think could become a successful live action movie or tv series. I do believe there’s gold to be had in the hills if you just find the right claim to strike. These were the four I could come up with.\n\nOutlaw Star\n\nHate to dig out an oldie that I drone on and on about, but I can’t stress enough how awesome this would be on the big screen. Of all the sci-fi anime to make live action, I cannot understand for the life of me why this underrated gem hasn’t been considered.\n\nIf you’ve avoided every mention of this anime I’ve ever made (impressive work) then all you really need to know is that it’s an old-school space western. Odd-job man, Gene Starwind, inherits a ship after helping space outlaw Ice Hilda and gets to travel the vast reaches of the cosmos for adventure. In words, they’re seeking the “Galactic Leyline” for the enigmatic crewmate, Melfina, but the show’s biggest focus has always been seeing what crazy smuggling adventure the crew could get into.\n\nI can’t understand for the life of me why this doesn’t exist yet. We’ve got shows like Firefly and all variations of Star Trek, so why not a red-headed crack shot that shoots magic, a space samurai, and an alien werewolf? I think the SCIFI crowd would really take to it if the right TLC were applied.\n\nSamurai Champloo\n\nWe drift from a Much Ado About Oldies to Oddball Mentions. I don’t talk about this anime as much as I should, After all, it’s one of the most unique titles you’re gonna find in a sea of weirdness.\n\nSamurai Champloo is Shinichirō Watanabe’s claim to Genius infamy. The framing plot of two wandering swordsmen being roped into helping a waitress find a man is really just the tour-guide, as the show’s main attraction comes from the smashing together of Chanbara Samurai films with hip-hop and gangsta culture. Mugen fights via breakdancing; the anime’s littered with hip-hop beats; people are wearing bad-ass chains and rings that shouldn’t exist for several hundreds of years. Even if you aren’t that into hip-hop and rap, you’ll get a kick from the visceral action and crack timing on the comedy.\n\nJapan has a long history of Chanbara – it’s basically their answer to the obsession we have with the Old West. Then, with Watanabe onboard with writing and directing, they could grind in those references to hip-hop culture and make lightning all over again.\n\nHellsing\n\nI’m not crazy. But I do think people, deep down, have a love of cartoony and gratuitous gore and destruction. How else would a series like this every get as popular as it did?\n\nHellsing and Hellsing Ultimate are rest stops for people like me who love both the tragedy of the vampire-type character and the massive amounts of violence one would find in the Mortal Kombat series. Both anime tell the tale of a secret sect of Her Majesty’s forces, the Hellsing Organization, who fight the awful monsters we all recognize: vampires, werewolves, ghouls, etc. When things get particularly bad, they send in their prized possession: Alucard, a vampire, soft-science nightmare who regenerates from anything and has lost his damn mind. You might recognize him from the Twilight memes that wanna challenge Edward’s dick status as a vampire.\n\nImage from Comic-Vine\n\nWhy do I want an anime so light on story and heavy on blood? It’s because we’ve already shown that we are willing to stomach a lot of horrendous special effects when it’s edgy vampires and lots of action scenes. If we can combine Hellsing’s crazy-awesome antics with the kind of movie magic that Blade had, we could see a cult-classic overnight.\n\nVampire Hunter D: Bloodlust\n\nOh yes, I did just go real old school.\n\nVampire Hunter D: Bloodlust is the second film based on the novels by writer Hideyuki Kikuchi of the same name. They tell the very long and very steampunk, very old school story of the enigmatic monster hunter, D, and his many adventures in the steampunk Wasteland that once was Earth. Overrun by the Nobility (nobles) and creatures originally thought to be extinct, D’s invincible hero status serves more or less as a way to explore this heavily atmospheric setting rather than tell a compelling story. Bloodlust is the second attempt at making a movie from the novels and of far greater success.\n\nI am picturing Mad Max with vampires when I think of this in live action. Mechanical horses, energy and moisture farms, werewolves and silk-cloaked vampires; it just sounds like delicious eye candy. Much like the source material, I see this film being more visually compelling, like the source material, but I dearly hope they would go with the movie version rather than the original book. Not unless they wanna depress half the nation.\n\nWhat anime do you think would survive translation? Feel free to comment below and don’t forget to like and follow!\n\nStrap in, Kiddies, it’s time to rant.\n\nPicture yourself watching a show that you’ve been glued to for ages. It’s had you gripping the edge of your seat for episode after episode, never let you down before. Then, out of nowhere, a moment happens. The moment is so wrong, so stupid, or just so poorly thought out that you can’t help but feel anger alongside your bitter disappointment.\n\nNo no no no no no–!\n\nThis post is dedicated to these moments, specifically the ones I felt. These are my let downs, my moments in anime that almost or succeeded in making me give up a show. These are my biggest anime letdown moments, meaning there will be spoilers. This is your only warning.\n\nThe point of a post like this is not to say any of these shows are bad, no. The point is to acknowledge that a “perfect” anime show is hard to find, probably impossible. In fact, the higher the pedestal we put it on, the more likely it may be to fall.\n\nNow, onto the spoilers\n\nNear The Copycat\n\nOf all the shows I’ll mention here, Death Note is one of the hardest you could possibly kill. It’s a reverse Sherlock Holmes, where the villain (Light Yagami) must outwit and kill our Sherlock (L Lawliet) over a killer notebook. A battle of two geniuses is always fun to watch, sitting in eager anticipation of the next chess move. This makes the introduction of a new character difficult as you’ve already attached your audience to two important figures.\n\nBut Death Note did so anyway, just like the manga, and tried to ingratiate their new character, Near, to the viewing audience.\n\nIt might have worked, had Near not been a cheap knockoff of L in almost every aspect. He’s got the same childish behavior, the same crouched posture; he even picks up objects the same way. When Near isn’t copying his mentor, he’s a stale character that doesn’t offer much originality beyond playing with toys and being a little less snarky. Since Near doesn’t have much of the charm L had, he didn’t go over well. He has a tiny following among Death Note fans, but not enough to save him.\n\nDante’s “Big Plan”\n\nThis one actually did kill the show in question for me, though it was already falling apart as it was. Whether it was Mustang killing the Rockbells, or Shou Tucker being allowed to live and continue his experiments, it’s safe to say that I was on my way to abandoning the original Fullmetal Alchemist show. But the kicker that finally made me abandon ship came from the show’s new main villain: the alchemist named Dante, the one without the pink hair in the picture beside. The spurned lover of Ed & Al’s dad, her goal was to use philosopher’s stones to hop from body to body and live forever.\n\nEven someone who hasn’t seen Brotherhood all the way through, or hasn’t read the manga completely, can see that Dante’s plan is a joke. It’s simple and stupid when compare to the big web of intrigue and deception Father weaves in the original story. Arakawa may have given the show permission to go their own way, but I seriously wish they’d put some more thought into it.\n\nBlack Butler Season 2\n\nNow I discussed Kuroshitsuji in a previous post as one wickedly successful anime. In short summary, the young Earl Ciel Phantomhive makes a deal with a demon, Sebastian, to track down his parents’ killers in exchange for his soul. It’s a brilliant concept and hilarious show that’s really only guilty of yaoi-baiting the audience. The ending of season one was amazing, tying up all the dangling plot threads and giving the audience closure.\n\nAh, but the story hadn’t ended in the manga. In fact, it had a widely different storyline. So a second season was slated, despite the fact that the first ending was just perfect.\n\nAnd I’d be lying if I thought it didn’t have anything to do with more money\n\nOne cannot simply call “the end” and “just kidding” in something like this. This big, powerful moment, in the end, is undone in an instant, losing its emotional value and becoming just another step in the time. That kind of bait-and-switch is frustrating and shows the dangers of an anime going too far ahead of the source material.\n\nFruit’s Basket “Non-Ending”\n\nThe last thing I can recall the most disappointment from is rather fitting as it was the last thing I saw of a series. Fruits Basket was my introduction to reverse-harem stories as a whole, along with some pretty heavy subjects. The story, in short, is all about Ms. Tohru Honda, a mildly thick but cute as a button high school student, giving a form of Pollyanna Therapy to the dysfunctional Sohma family. When they aren’t suffering from the family curse that turns them into creatures from the Zodiac, they tend to suffer from abusive relationships, social ostracization, and other problems. It’s thick stuff that’s far more dramatic in the manga. The anime gutted most of the juicy bits, but still had a nice story behind it.\n\nAnd then… it just stopped.\n\nIs that closure? NOOOO!\n\nGranted, after discovering Kyo’s big secret, and facing off against the terrifying family matriarch/patriarch that caused most of the trauma, there’s not much to do. But the fact that the family curse is never resolved that any lingering feelings between Kyo and Tohru aren’t addressed completely is still are cause for concern. The non-ending of the anime is sad when compared to the manga.\n\nIn a way, it illustrates how it feels when we run into these “let downs.” It feels like this great show we were watching has just given up; it dropped the ball and walked away. It’s frustrating, annoying, and here’s to hoping I never have to lengthen this list.\n\nBut something tells me I’ll be back\n\nIs there a moment in a show that let you down? Feel free to share in the angst and torment below. And don’t forget to like and follow for more content like this.\n\nWho said anime never makes an impact?\n\nChildren tend to idolize the characters they see in their favorite media: books, tv or otherwise. After all, to a five-year-old there is little more awesome and “heroic” than Superman lifting a train off the ground so that one of the normies can crawl out. They take up our entire lives when we’re young, and become people in and unto themselves.\n\nHow many of us cried from Pokemon The Firs Movie? Be honest…\n\nIt’s only later in life that we look back on the people we dressed up as on Halloween, and start to sort out the people we thought were “cool” and the people we carried with us for much deeper reasons. Since I dove head-first into anime at a pretty young age (thanks again, Toonami) most of the characters I really liked or really resonated with usually came from there. These are my childhood anime heroes: the characters who spoke to me on another level and still resonate with me to this day.\n\nUsagi/Serena Tsukino\n\nIf we’re going back in my anime experience, I’d be remiss not to start with she who started my love for it all. The grandmother of all magical girl anime, Usagi Tsukino, was the klutzy, scaredy-cat crybaby who transformed into the beautiful sailor soldier, Sailor Moon, to fight monsters in Tokyo. She was a very odd addition to the heroes pantheon as she lacked the confidence of most superheroes and tended to cry during fights. But she always pushed past her fears to save the day, proving that all you needed to be a hero was enough courage and enough heart.\n\nThis, above all things, is what draws me to Sailor Moon. I was always klutzy as a child; I cried at the drop of a hat, and it didn’t take much to scare me. Yet here was this hero who was just like me, breaking past her flaws to be a hero and save the day. Usagi taught me that anyone can be great, no matter what their weaknesses are. I can only hope the new generation picks that up from this unlikely hero.\n\nSakura Kinomoto\n\nOn the train of underdog heroes, Cardcaptors (the dub of Cardcaptor Sakura) became my new daily watch when Sailor Moon ran out of “safe” dubs. I was intrigued by the cute animation and magic, but even more so by lead: Sakura Kinomoto. She was much younger than Usagi and just as easily scared, but she was much better at running into the fight and finishing it. But what she had one extra thing that made all the difference: Leeway.\n\nI’d like to think that Sakura had far more stacked against her than Usagi. She was the one who accidentally scattered the Clow cards, thus it makes sense that she’s tasked with recollecting them. This is a scary prospect to have shoved onto you and yet she embraces it as best as she can. She’s allowed to have shortcomings in that she has to get help from Kero, her best friend, and other allies she meets. She taught me that it’s okay to reach out and ask for help, something I think more anime needs to stress in these “unlikely hero” scenarios.\n\nKenshin Himura\n\nSpeaking of mistakes, sometimes those mistakes can come back to haunt you. Coming to you live from the “I was too young for this” department, meet the girly-looking swordsman with the badass skills and soft heart: Kenshin Himura\n\nAs I said, I found Rurouni Kenshin at a point where I was too young to truly understand the plot. But I had a basic enough grasp of the characters to know that Kenshin was a former samurai that instigated most of the death in some big war of the time. He became a wandering samurai to atone for his deeds in the war and wound up staying at the Kamiya Dojo with a hot-tempered assistant master and her student. He vowed to never kill again, a vow difficult to keep when everything from the past is rushing back with swords drawn, ready to gut you and everyone you care about. And yet, through all this strife, Kenshin finds himself a new life, a place to put down roots, and a new will to live. It’s all about second chances, and I took that to heart.\n\nGene Starwind\n\nOnce again, this was someone I shouldn’t have known about at such a young age. Outlaw Star is not a kid’s anime at all, but it is an excellent anime if you like sci-fi and cyberpunk things. And part of the reason I love it so much is because of its protagonist, the jerkass with standards: Gene Starwind.\n\nGene is a perverted, sarcastic, foul-mouthed, space handyman. A Jack-Of-All-Trades that did a variety of jobs, he accidentally wound up helping a space outlaw and found himself in possession of an awesome ship. From there, the rest is a fun-filled search for the mythical Galactic Leyline. It’s a pretty fun, pretty chill anime that’s about cruising around space and meeting neat sci-fi things, and all to the most unlikely of people. Gene is not perfect by any definition but he can still get his rear in gear and be a true hero. You don’t have to be a paragon of morals to do the right thing; that’s a powerful lesson to take away at any age.\n\nMonkey D. Luffy\n\nOur last entry today is one that still endures and inspires to this day. When you have endless oodles of energy and a dream that cannot be shattered, how can you not inspire for years on end?\n\nMonkey D. Luffy is hardly the smartest pirate on the ocean or the most strategic. In fact, his only real leg up in this madness comes from his physical strength and his straight moral compass. But where Luffy cannot be defeated is his stubborn tenacity. When idiot meets determined, magic can happen, and almost nothing can break his spirit (and several will try). Luffy is my hero purely on strength of will and his battering-ram like chase after his dream. He’s gonna get that treasure someday, even if every building behind him has to fall.\n\nWho was (or is) your anime hero? Feel free to leave a comment below. And don’t forget to like the post and follow if you want more content just like this.\n\nAnime has a reputation for brawlers. Shonen has done a good job of making the genre a home for over-muscled beefcakes who can punch through steel, defeat legions of aliens, and then return home to consume a buffet table’s worth of food. But anime as we know it doesn’t just revel in the Goku’s and the Jojo characters, oh no. It also understands that intelligence is a weapon, especially when wielded by the unnaturally smart.\n\nOr by the unnaturally attractive\n\nFans love their genius characters. They not only make any combat far more interesting (spotting weaknesses and what not) but they also make less actiony plots more complex and interesting. In celebration of characters who put their big brains on the frontlines, these are my six favorite anime geniuses. As always, this is just my list, and they aren’t in any particular order this time.\n\nAmi Mizuno – Sailor Moon\n\nWe start with something childish and sweet. Sailor Moon was the five-man-band for girls, and Ami was “The Smart One.” But she wasn’t just smart, she was a quick-fire genius and a great sleuth.\n\nSailor Moon, the grandmama of all magical girl anime, featured five girls who magically transformed into sailor-suited warriors of justice. Ami was the smart but shy Sailor Mercury, who’s powers focused on water and ice, and worked in a more defensive manner: bubbles that froze the enemy, a mist that created illusions, etc. When Ami wasn’t weakening enemies, she was using her mini-computer to find an enemy weak spot or passing tests at Juuban High School at the top of her class. With big plans to be a doctor, she sure has to hit the books… or her baddies, whichever comes first.\n\nRadical Edward – Cowboy BeBop\n\nFor the rare specimens who never saw Cowboy Bebop, meet Edward Wong Hau Pepelu Tivrusky IV – Ed for short. She’s a great example of a fangirl gone crazy awesome, and what happens when an obsessive genius won’t stop until she’s a part of the team.\n\nCowboy Bebop introduced fans to a plethora of amazing characters, though it mainly focused on the space bounty hunters Spike Spiegel, Jett Black, and Faye Valentine. Ed, the daughter of a cartographer, was a huge fan of the Bebop Crew and set her sights on joining after escaping her childhood orphanage.\n\nShe grew quite skilled in computer science and earned herself the hacker nickname Radical Ed. She’s a master at bypassing security, cracking passwords, and just about the only person on the ship who understands little Eine the dog. Is she crazy? Quite possibly, but count your blessings she’s a good guy.\n\nKurama/ Shuichi Minamino – Yu Yu Hakusho\n\nLots of people mistake Kurama as the pretty boy who isn’t a threat. Those people are wrong and probably dead.\n\nYu Yu Hakusho follows the exploits of Yusuke Urameshi, high school thug turned spirit detective. He meets Kurama on one of his “Cases”, and notices right away that he’s not like the demons he’d met thus far. The former fox demon was reborn into human form after his death in the spirit world and grew empathy for the human world as a result. Thus he became one of Yusuke’s comrades against threats to the Spirit World and believe me, you want Kurama on your side. His battle strategies are brilliant; his logic quite impressive, and his calm demeanor almost intimidating.\n\nLt. Colonel Roy Mustang – Fullmetal Alchemist\n\nAlchemy is the magical science of equivalent exchange, breaking down and building back up with only the materials you have. No one understands this better than Edward Elric, who now must travel the world in search of the philosopher stone to undo a terrible mistake he made to his little brother, Al, and to himself. He has lots of people there to help, including the famed Flame Alchemist: Lt. Colonel Mustang.\n\nMustang is a high-ranking officer in the Amestrian army and a super powerful Alchemist. This soldier has dealt with fire of all types: be it flames at his fingertips or licking at his heels The enemies in this series, the homunculi and the ever enigmatic Father, constantly change things and work in increasingly underhanded ways of infiltrating the government and playing everyone like one giant chess game. But Mustang has not only survived their attempts to keep him pinned, but found several ways to ingeniously outmaneuver them and get what he wants. Mustang’s battle smarts and tactician skills make him absolutely brilliant and anyone who gets in his way will find themselves outgunned and outmatched.\n\nL Lawliet & Light Yagami – Death Note\n\nI’m cheating, I know. But picking between these two is almost impossible. The whole first half of the show is watching these two collide, after all, so they both deserve their due respect.\n\nIf you’ve managed to avoid the show up to this point, Death Note is the utterly amazing story about a boy getting a notebook from a God of Death, a notebook that can kill anyone if you have their name their face. Light decides to use it to kill international criminals and become the god of a new world. The show puts Light, arguably the villain, in the lead while L, the detective trying to catch him, becomes an antagonist. Light is the golden boy who thinks three steps ahead, coming up with genius strategies to hide his secret life and manipulating everyone around him. L, a pasty, scraggly, sunken-eyed insomniac, also seems to think three or even four steps ahead of everybody, and capable of genius logic chains that bring him to the right conclusions despite Light’s attempts at hiding.\n\nSure, characters like this cause sections of the plot to go over a few heads, but it also promises a story that’s as gripping as it is complex. Our anime Geniuses may not always be flashy in the physical department, but they know how to keep us spellbound and keep us guessing.\n\nHappy early Valentines Day everyone!\n\nWe’re in our first full week of February, meaning the stores are shilling chocolate and Hallmark like it’s going out of style. I’ll take this time to say how much I love my readers, you are my sugar-candy, and a thank you to She-Who-Will-Not-Be-Named who has helped me edit now since day one. She’s amazing, you’re all amazing, and I love you both.\n\nNow then – onto romantic feelings for ink and paper.\n\nTo crush on anime characters is a strange, alien concept to all outside the animesphere, but commonplace to those within. When internet quiz sites and fanfiction exploded back in the day, so too did the rise of InsertCharacterHere x OC stories, where fantasy became a badly written book. We all had our big lineup of anime crushes, the one we had custom-built Mary Sues for, and these just happen to be mine. These are my very first anime crushes, in all their embarrassing glory. Because if I can’t laugh at myself I can’t laugh at anyone else.\n\nTuxedo Mask – Sailor Moon\n\nThe girlies go crazy for a sharp-dressed man. Any girl from the 90’s can testify.\n\nOld School Tuxedo Mask was the favorite for a lot of girls in the original Moon Madness. The dashing hero who arrived with a single rose and the swish of a cape sounds like something straight out of a romance novel, capped with the knowledge that he may or may not be your enemy. The fact that Tuxy was the routine kidnappee of the show also brought him into focus as it allowed a fantasy of saving the man you loved as opposed to the opposite. The newer cartoon makes him a lot nicer to look at, but I have a soft spot for the man of yesteryears.\n\nFuture Trunks – Dragon Ball Z\n\nMy brothers were huge DBZ fans back in the day, which meant I ended up watching a lot of it to get to my own cartoons. But, sometimes, the reward could be sweet.\n\nI can distinctly recall the first time I saw Trunks visit from the future, and how much I liked him. He was an older kid with cute hair and cool clothes, and who couldn’t love a badass with a blade? Because I was only a child, it didn’t stretch any farther than that, but I do remember that I finally accepted around that time that it was okay to have a crush on a fictional character. Weird or not, it was gonna happen, and there was no point in beating myself up over it.\n\nDomon Kashu – G Gundam\n\nThis was another that came about because my brothers controlled the TV. My older brother was into G-Gundam for a very long time, long enough that the series grew on me and is still one of my guilty pleasures to this day. Because I’ve now seen far more of this series than any sane person really should, I developed a pretty superficial crush on the main character – Neo Japan’s champion and ironic King of Hearts, Domon Kashu.\n\nI’m not kidding when I say this came from a completely superficial base. I thought the hair and cape were cool; I liked his voice; He could fight and seemed protective of his love interest. But considering Domon’s also a hotheaded, pretty boring protagonist, it didn’t last very long.\n\nSesshomaru – Inuyasha\n\nYou, yes, you in the peanut gallery; I can hear you. I know I called Inuyasha a failure and ripped it a new one. But how else can I know exactly why it failed its one job unless I knew it from the inside. Yes, I was a fan – still am of a few characters – and I freaking loved Sesshomaru back in my high school days.\n\nIn all seriousness, I, like many other High School Anime Nerds, had a thing for pretty anime characters. The king of Bishounen, Sesshomaru, was one of my big favorites and likely where my love of The Cold Jerk in romance games came from. But any Sesshomaru fangirl secretly understands that this attraction to a killer is pretty skin-deep. They won’t admit it out loud, but they know it to be true.\n\nSanji – One Piece\n\nI’ve heard this show get called a lot of things. It’s been accused of being a cash0-cow, boring, predictable, and even stupid. And while the first and last complaint is valid taste-wise, One Piece will always be the show that made me the Shounen Soul I am today. And the face that sealed that for me was the smiling one you see to your left.\n\nThe resident “Mr. Prince” was a fun character: cooks like a master, fights like a badass, swoons over women like a dork. While he had a foul-mouth and quick temper, Sanji became a favorite for a lot of girls who fantasized about a four-course meal by candlelight, a fantasy many still probably hold. While these days I find myself gravitating toward far more different specimens (*cough FireFist, *cough/Sob*) I will always remember one of the best additions to the Strawhat crew.\n\nWho was your anime crush? Feel free to share below. And don’t forget to like and follow for more content just like this.\n\nAlola, fellow Otaku!\n\nThis was supposed to have been up last week, and it was last I checked, but somehow I found it again in my drafts. I don’t know why, but here it is… again.\n\nMerry Christmas indeed.\n\nAnyway, Pokemon has gone to Hawaii in its newest title, Pokemon Sun, and Pokemon Moon. This time Game Freak whisks away trainers to Alola, a beautiful group of islands based off Hawaii. Here trainers battle Captains and Kahunas for z-crystals, face off against the punk terrorist, Team Skull, and aim to be the new Island Champion.\n\nAnd of course, with a new region, comes a new Pokedex….\n\nYou could say I’m a happy camper\n\nJust like the Johto Region, Alola sports some reskinned classics and a crop of fresh Pokemon designs. And because I read way too much into flavor text in games, I of course found several of the new Pokedex entries accidentally disturbing. Because it wasn’t spooky enough that your Pokedex stares right at you the whole time; they had to splash in some accidental Nightmare Fuel.\n\nThese are the new Creepiest Pokedex entries, in their numerical order in the Pokedex.\n\nMagnezone — Magnet Phone Home\n\nMoon: “As it zooms through the sky, this Pokémon seems to be receiving signals of unknown origin, while transmitting signals of unknown purpose.”\n\nMagnets, man, how do they work? Pokemon clearly has no idea.\n\nMagnamite was already kinda creepy if you thought too hard about it, but now it’s wandered straight into the uncanny valley. Now those Magnemite who are forever stuck to each other melded together to form a UFO, forever zooming the skies as a legion-like entity. Given how the show straight up admitted that Clefairy were aliens, it wouldn’t surprise me if Magnezone just confirmed Magnemite is from Mars\n\nOh, and if anyone from Gamefreak is reading this, a new game that takes place on another planet would be a bucket of awesome.\n\nCrabomidable — True Grit and True Horror\n\nSun: “It aimed for the top but got lost and ended up on a snowy mountain. Being forced to endure the cold, this Pokémon evolved and grew fur.”\n\nHey kids, guess what? Your fighting/water type nearly died in the cold!\n\nCrabomidable, besides being a cute pun, scares players not on the grounds of appearance but on the implications. Because nothing says “kid friendly” like the image of a tiny little crab falling off a mountain, buried alive in a mound of snow, and turning into a crazy yeti. But speaking of classic nightmare fuel…\n\nMareanie/Toxapex — Dinner and a Murder, Anybody?\n\nSun (Mareanie): “It plunges the poison spike on its head into its prey. When the prey has weakened, Mareanie deals the finishing blow with its 10 tentacles.”\n\nSun (Toxapex): “Toxapex crawls along the ocean floor on its 12 legs. It leaves a trail of Corsola bits scattered in its wake.”\n\nOh goodie, it’s not just humans in this universe who eat Pokemon.\n\nMareanie and Toxapex are both based off the Crown-Of-Thorns starfish, a spiky little fella who likes to prey on coral polyps. So, the Pokemon Creation Team decided to stay as close to the source material as possible and made this little guy a Corsola Killer in both of his evolutionary stages. If you don’t find this creepy, just picture a Corsola minding its own business, and these things suddenly barrel towards it.\n\nAnd on that note…\n\nYungoos/Gumshoos — If Only I Could Keep My Eyes Open…\n\nSun (Yungoos): “It wanders around in a never-ending search for food. At dusk, it collapses from exhaustion and falls asleep on the spot.”\n\nMoon (Gumshoos): “It adores having Rattata and Raticate for dinner, but as it’s diurnal, it never encounters them. This Pokémon boasts incredible patience.”\n\nMeet your new Ratatta: a perpetually angry mongoose that hangs around everywhere and looks like the Love Machine from Summer Wars. But wait, kiddies, this thing also likes to eat those cute purple mice you’ve seen since you were kids, and it works so hard to find them that it literally faints every night.\n\nAraquanid — I Didn’t Mean to, George. It Was an Accident…\n\nSun: “It delivers headbutts with the water bubble on its head. Small Pokémon get sucked into the bubble, where they drown.”\n\nMoon: “Despite what its appearance suggests, it cares for others. If it finds vulnerable, weak Pokémon, it protectively brings them into its water bubble.”\n\nOh, the road to hell is most certainly paved with good intentions, as evident by this water-spider monstrosity with the adorable bubble on its head. Its want to save the tiny little Pokemon around it seems to make it forget that not every one of them is aquatic, and results in the accidental death of his/her new friends. At least that’s the romantic version of what happens. The real thing is probably far worse and less tragic.\n\nShiinotic — Come, Little Humans, I’ll Take Thee Away….\n\nSun: Forests where Shiinotic live are treacherous to enter at night. People confused by its strange lights can never find their way home again.\n\nMoon: It emits flickering spores that cause drowsiness. When its prey succumbs to sleep, this Pokémon feeds on them by sucking in their energy.\n\nWhat is it with Pokemon and evil mushrooms?\n\nSo if you read my previous entry on creepy Pokemon than you’ll probably recall my entry on Parasect, where the mushrooms growing on its back merge together, kill Paras, and control it like a zombie. Now we have that mushroom’s fairy cousin, which likes to use flashing lights to hypnotize humans and trap them forever in a forest, feeding on them once they fall asleep. This fairy type really puts the grim in Grimm’s fairy tales, proving that the little buggers are not above being little parasites.\n\nSandygast/Palosand — RKO’s Newest Mascot.\n\nMoon: (Sandygast) “It takes control of anyone who puts a hand in its mouth. And so it adds to the accumulation of its sand-mound body.”\n\nMoon: (Palosand) “Buried beneath the castle are masses of dried-up bones from those whose vitality it has drained.”\n\nOnly in Pokemon can you go from deadly and capricious fungus to possessed, evil sand. Sandygast feels like something out of a B-rated horror movie from the 80’s, with its soul-snatching mouth and utterly non-frightening appearance. Then it evolves to something twice as silly looking, but with a horrific Pokedex entry. Reading the flavor text for both of these guys, sometimes you have to remind yourself that Nintendo intended both of these games to be for children.\n\nMimikyu — I AM NOT AN ANIMA-Oh Wait.\n\nSun: “Its actual appearance is unknown. A scholar who saw what was under its rag was overwhelmed by terror and died from the shock.”\n\nMoon: “A lonely Pokémon, it conceals its terrifying appearance beneath an old rag so it can get closer to people and other Pokémon.”\n\nLastly, we have my new favorite entry, possibly a new favorite Pokemon.\n\nTaking inspiration from the old bed-sheet Halloween costume, Gamefreak presents a Pokemon who forever lives in shame, covering its ghastly appearance with the most adorable Pikachu costume ever. Now I know this one’s supposed to be like the elephant man, and I should be quaking in my boots about the fellow who died after seeing it, but I have the biggest urge to give this guy a gigantic bear hug. I’m a sucker for romanticized tragedy, and this one hits me right in the feels.\n\nWhat are your new favorites from the new generation? Do these guys strike terror into your hearts? Or do they fall flat? Feel free to comment below and don’t forget to like for more material just like this. Feel free to follow me to get updates on when I post!\n\nHappy Early Halloween, my Otaku-Ghouls, and Gals.\n\nFall has always been one of my favorite seasons, and Halloween contributes heavily to that: Delicious candy flows at cheap prices; horror movies are abundant, and the decorations pouring out of department stores burning money like hellfire.\n\nIt’s the most wonderful time of the year…\n\nNaturally, this is the time of year when fear becomes trendy. While I don’t dive into Horror anime as much as I’d like, I do adore when a character makes me shiver in my blanket burrito. Thus I present to you the top ten anime characters that, one time or another, made me shake in my fashion boots. As always, this is just my list, and I’m open to suggestions in the comments from what I haven’t seen.\n\n10. The Major — Hellsing (Spoilers: Minor)\n\nIn an unrelated project, I once asked “who wants to own a war?” in jest. Little did I know, there was an answer to that question.\n\nThe Major, lacking a real name, loves war. He doesn’t care if he’s on the winning or losing side of any war; he just wants to be a part of the whole bloody affair. This obsession not only leads him to fighting for the Nazi’s in WWII, but to forming a neo-nazi organization, Millennium, and plunging London into a bloody chaotic heap. Intelligent, ruthless, and usually in a jaunty mood, The Major has no qualms about sending his men to die at the hands of a monster, using them as bait to lure out other people, or anything that results in mass death. Worse yet, this soft-spoken, impeccably dressed man will do it all with a jaunty smile on his face.\n\n9. Majin Buu — Dragon Ball Z (Spoilers: Moderate)\n\nThe Major’s greatest strength is the power of an army. But what if one person had all that power? What if it was a toddler?\n\nFor all the Goofy Dragon Ball Z has ever done, Majin Buu was a stroke of genius. He looks like a joke villain, This pudgy pink ball of lard but Akira Toriyama made him just about the most dangerous thing his group of martial artists ever dealt with. He took all the power of several nuclear warheads and put it in the hands of a childish, easily angered creature, and what followed was utter, terrifying chaos. This funny-looking creature destroyed cities, Kami’s lookout, and nearly the whole planet, in one season. And that was just in this form — you don’t wanna see him in his second and third state.\n\n8. Sebastian Michaelis — Black Butler (Spoilers: None)\n\nWhen it comes to power, both Buu and Sebastian are forces to be reckoned with. But where Buu lacks in intelligence, Sebastian has in experience, cunning, and just sheer, cold cruelty. The only reason people don’t shake when they see him is the charming dandy candy wrapper on the outside.\n\nThe demonic butler of Kuroshitsuji is a near indestructible force under the command of Earl Ciel Phantomhive, revenge-seeking-child #524. Fast, strong, and immortal, Sebastian attacks every problem (or person) his masters points him too with precision and machine-like efficiency. This results in the Butler bringing hell to earth on several occasions for the Earl’s enemies, leaving one to question just what this ruthless creature would do if he wasn’t on a leash. And with the threat of his reward on the horizon, namely Ciel’s soul, the show always feels like a trap waiting to trigger.\n\n7. Orochimaru — Naruto (Spoilers: Minor)\n\nWhile Naruto doesn’t impress me as much as it used to, it’s hard to deny how utterly creepy and disturbing that is Orochimaru. Unlike Sebastian, the snake villain of Naruto is not bound by anyone, and thus free to be the disturbing bastard that he is.\n\nOne of the three greatest ninjas of Konohagakure, Orochimaru is described as “twisted”, while “creepy” is a better term. Besides conducting mass experiments on the village population to gain immortality, Orochimaru is no stranger to wearing other people’s skins like a suit, nor in testing the limits of human body modification. Orochimaru himself is body horror incarnate, especially when wielding a host of snake-jutsus that make his own body react in unnatural fashions. If there was ever a man who embodied hard-science horrors, it was Orochimaru.\n\n6. Akito — Fruits Basket (Spoilers: Minor)\n\nBut why I hear you ask? Akito doesn’t kill anyone, nor does he have any supernatural powers. But Akito has one thing that makes him terrifying: complete control over a whole family, and he abuses it to horrific extents.\n\nFor most of Fruits Basket, the head of the Sohma family tended to be a shadowy figure that never showed his face. But later episodes (and chapters) revealed that Akito was a cold creature, so afraid of being left alone that he’d do anything to keep the family close by. This, sadly, included physical abuse, gas-lighting, brainwashing, and any other trauma he could think of. The control Akito has over the minds of those in the Zodiac is terrifying to watch and will break your heart each time you get a tiny glimpse.\n\n5. Light Yagami — Death Note (Spoilers: None)\n\nAbused power is, indeed, a terrifying concept. None utilize this to greater effect than Light Yagami, the teen with the power to murder in just a few pen strokes.\n\nLight is the bored genius child in every classroom, the one who’s too smart and frustrated with all the wrongs he sees around him. But, unlike the others, Light stumbles upon the power to do something about it: a Notebook that can kill with a name and a face. Light’s goal seems like it would be the obvious solution, i.e use the Death Note to kill criminals, but Light takes it several steps too far. Believing himself to be a new God, Light’s ultimate goal is to murder anyone he deems as unworthy and start a new perfect society of justice. When challenged, he becomes an unhinged creature they call Kira, killing anyone he rationalized as dangerous and manipulating everyone around him for the greater good.\n\n4. Shishio Makoto — Rurouni Kenshin (Spoilers: Minimal)\n\nSpeaking of creating the perfect world, someone else beat Light to that punch a long time ago. But where Light has to hide for fear of being stopped, this fellow operates as a public terrorist.\n\nShishio Makoto was a former assassin for the government, the same government who tried to burn him alive when they had no more use for him. After surviving the flames Shisho has formed an anti-government militia and plans to take over all of Japan. But where Light plans to make a “perfect world” where crime is reason enough to be slaughtered, Shisho believes the weak exist to aid the strong (mostly by dying) and has no trouble at all crushing people under his heel. Intelligent and charismatic, it doesn’t take long for this sadistic samurai to gain a following, and for his burning passion to almost destroy an entire country.\n\n3. Fuhrer King Bradley — Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood (Spoilers: Minor)\n\nWe’ve played with a lot of beings now with unrestrained power, who are usually either apathetic or on a leash. Imagine what would happen if that endless power were released onto the world with little to no safeguards.\n\nThat is King Bradley, and that is terrifying\n\nThe “enigmatic” leader of Amestris makes only a few appearances early on, but these brief appearances usually resulted in someone being slaughtered before the audience could blink. He is ruthless against his enemies, blindly fast, and seems to be powered by an endless supply of cold, cruel, anger. There’s no mercy to be found when Bradley’s decided your fate, a feature that has lead to Mustang questioning his intentions, especially when this was the same man who kept the fires burning for the Ishvalan war. Even the audience isn’t exactly sure what side Bradley is really on.\n\n2. Lucy — Elfen Lied (Spoilers: Moderate)\n\nWhen Elfen Lied isn’t painting its story with buckets of blood, it shows some serious depth and Shakespearean characters. None more so than Lucy, whose traumatic past makes her a rage-fueled murderer who will leave you in sympathetic tears.\n\nLucy the Diclonius has experienced the best and the worst of humanity all at once and too fast. Her whole life has been defined by aggressive, over-cruel bullying, borderline on sadistic, resulting in her torturing and killing her tormentors in the most brutal fashion. But Lucy has also experienced love from a childhood friend and actually seeks to atone for her sins in the name of that love.\n\n1. Legato Bluesummers — Trigun (Spoilers: Mild)\n\nThe Gung-Ho guns were a very late addition to Trigun, but their leader more than makes up for it.\n\nThe manga shows Legato in a more sympathetic light, revealing him to be a former slave that was abused before being rescued by Vash’s nemesis. The anime leaves his background a mystery but makes his disturbing nature abundantly clear. Legato is a manipulative nihilist who’s bound and determined to torment a man who swears to never kill, strictly because that man causes him “undue irritation.”\n\nLegato’s talks of everything being pointless and empty, alongside his powers to control bodies through his mind (combined with, you guessed it, some sadistic intelligence) make him the most disturbing force to be reckoned with. Legato’s penchant for psychological warfare, and sheer obsession with breaking one man make him one of the scariest things to ever cross into anime.\n\nWho in anime terrifies you? Plan on dressing up as any of them for Halloween? Feel free to let us know all about it in the comments below. And don’t forget to like and follow for more content just like this.\n\nYour average Otaku should know one thing: art is never made in a vacuum.\n\nIt’s an old saying (you can tell by the dusty language) that basically means artists have to take their inspiration from everything and everyone, including cultures outside their own. The best artists will take make it their own, putting a unique spin on a well-loved thing, while a hack will just repackage it sloppily and hope no one notices.\n\nBut I do. It’s a sickness; I can’t help it.\n\nCan’t…. stop… watching!\n\nThankfully, today’s specimens are strokes of genius. For one of the favorite inspirational hotspots of anime and manga artists the world over is “The West”, or Western Culture as a whole. The morality of this cross-culturing aside, the results are some of the funniest, most interesting anime you can find, and these suckers deserve a spotlight.\n\nIn no particular order, here are my four favorite anime that successfully integrate some western candy into their Halloween bowl, and add their own personal stamp on it. As always, this is just my current list and can be updated at a later date. Should you know any better, or disagree with my reasoning, please feel free to comment.\n\nHonorable Mention: Avatar The Last Airbender\n\nThe only thing keeping this one from the list is that it’s not an anime, technically. But it’s so good at crossing cultural barriers, we have to at least give it the silver riceball or something.\n\nAvatar Aang, the peace-keeper between four elemental nations, returns after vanishing for over 100 years. In that time, the Fire Nation has declared war; the Air Nation has all been wiped out, and chaos seems imminent. But if Aang, the last of the airbenders, can master the other three elements, he and his friends have a shot at stopping the Fire Lord and restoring balance to the world.\n\nAs I said, the reason I insist on including this show is how many cues this western animation takes from anime. The art style alone is a nod to traditional anime, alongside its heavy dramatic themes, shonen-esque band of young heroes, and inspiration from both Chinese and Japanese culture. These guys did their research and brought the two mediums together into one beautiful piece. I tip my cat-ears to you, sirs and madams.\n\nThe Big O\n\nNow I’ve mentioned this one before, but she bears repeating. Because how often are you gonna find a show that’s Batman mixed with Giant Robots?\n\nAs I said in my Top Ten Toonami Shows, The Big O was a show from the 2000s that took place in post-apocalyptic Paradigm city, where the amnesiac population is under the protection of master negotiator and mech-pilot, Roger Smith. Together with android R. Dorothy Wayneright and his butler, Norman, his job is to protect the city and solve the mystery of why everyone lost their memories.\n\nBig O was inspired primarily off of shows like Batman: The Animated Series over in the states, adopting the same art aesthetic alongside the usual anime designs. There’s lots of film noir inspiration going around, and Roger’s name also aligns with the name of an American Actor/Writer who starred in an old Detective series in America, 77 Sunset Strip. It’s a very cool, very sophisticated action show that only suffered when the second season had less polish. There’s also an argument to be made about Roger being Anime Batman.\n\nSoul Eater\n\nSo what happens when anime and Tim Burton have a baby? You get an anime that bounces between spooky and crazy with gleeful abandon, and some genuinely moving storytelling.\n\nWelcome to the Death Weapon Meister Academy, run by Death himself, Shinigami-Sama. Here we follow three different groups of misfits, each consisting of a weapon master and a weapon (or two) that can change into a human. The goal is to capture 99 evil human souls, such as serial killers and sinners, and the soul of one witch. If they do this in order, the weapon becomes a “death scythe” to be wielded by Shinigami-Sama. If they fail or go out of order, they have to start all over again.\n\nSoul Eater always felt like the Japanese love-letter to Halloween and horror. When Maka isn’t swinging her scythe like a schoolgirl grim-reaper, or when you’re not wondering why that moon is giving you the crazy eyes, we’re chasing down pumpkin-throwing witches and famous serial killers. When we aren’t adoring the spooky things in life, we’re also making several nods to the Western pop culture at the time, such as the band Pink Floyd and the TV show Twin Peaks.\n\nSamurai Champloo\n\nMuch like how the west fantasized about the “good old days” with their western movies, the Japanese had a good old time with Samurai Cinema, otherwise known as Chanbara. These period pieces, which got more action-oriented after World War II, are insanely popular in Japan but never really got past B-movie, cult-classic status in the states. Thus, if you think about it, it makes perfect sense that they would mix so smoothly with underground hip-hop culture.\n\nDirected by Shinichirō Watanabe, Samurai Champloo is a Chanbara style anime infused with the soul of hip-hop and rap. Amidst an anachronistic version of Edo-Period Japan, Teahouse Waitress Fuu convinces two wandering samurai to help her: Jin, the traditionally stoic Ronin and Mugen, a free-roaming vagrant. Together this very unstable trio travel Japan in search of a man who, according to Fuu, “smells like sunflowers.”\n\nThis little gem loosened up the strict, historical standards and replaced it with a spectacular mesh of western hip-hop culture. It won’t be uncommon to see Edo-period folk walking around in sports kimonos, speaking in modern gangster slang, and sporting attitudes that bring the phrase “thug life” to mind in flashing Neon lights. It’s a grizzly, violent and yet funny piece that takes a tongue-in-cheek approach to its anachronisms, proving that all things are possible with good writing.\n\nCowboy BeBop\n\nYes, it’s the same guy. Obvious? Absolutely. Sorry? Not even close.\n\nEvery once and awhile you find a show that earns its praise, and BeBop earns every single accolade it gets. It takes us into yet another space dystopia where crime runs rampant, and police often pay bounty hunters to do their dirty work. Of these hunters, often called Cowboys, former Yazuka style outlaw Spike Spiegel is doing his best to make a living alongside his partner, Jett Black. As our story unfolds, their deep scars float to the surface; they begrudgingly pick up more misfits to join their merry band, and the setting around you becomes all the more consuming in its bleak, but stubborn atmosphere.\n\nThe references and homages in BeBop fill this show to bursting. It takes cues from American action movies, old westerns, John Woo Yakuza films, British pop music, Lupin III, Bruce Lee, and so much more. If you want a good chunk of what this show took tidbits from, check this website out here because, when it comes to crossing some cultures, these Space Cowboys will always deliver.\n\nAnd all it took was an almost dead cowboy…\n\nDo you have a favorite cross-culture anime? Is the very idea of cross-culture bad to you? Feel free to discuss or comment below, and don’t forget to like and follow for more content.\n\nI can still remember the day I went to my first anime convention. Stepping inside the hotel, opening my eyes to a room full of cosplayers, people in anime tees, and several people parked along the walls to play some new video game, I realized something: I had found my clan.\n\nBut being amongst my people also showed me that, for as large as anime is now, it’s still a small group of nerds who may or may not feel lost in the social cold. Anime is misunderstood often and can be difficult to get into in the first place. There’s so many titles to choose from and so many different niches to run into that it’s hard to get into it or introduce someone to it. For this reason, and to toot the horn of my favorite shows, I present to you my anime starter pack. These shows are to be shown one episode at a time, in order and allowed to sink in.\n\nThat moment when your friend asks you what anime is\n\n1.Dragon Ball Z\n\nMartial Artist and Super Saiyan Son Goku fights against evil to save the planet. All the while, he’s helped by his family, closest friends, and even some surprise alliances.\n\nThe first thing we have to do is gather all the stereotypes most outsiders have about anime. In this case, all the stereotypes of Shounen: the over-muscular, ridiculous haired man who fights and grunts a lot, I.E Goku, and all his predecessors.\n\nMost people at one point in their life saw Dragon Ball Z on Toonami, that television big-bang that ushered in the anime apocalypse in the west. They probably liked it because of the action, the aliens, or even the tiny ounce of drama it attempted to have. But they probably didn’t realize that they were watching anime.\n\nThat above all is why this and the next entry are our starter points. Much like a goldfish you want to ease the little guy/girl into the water, give them a taste of weird they were likely already familiar with.\n\n2. Sailor Moon\n\nClumsy Crybaby Usagi Tsukino is given magical powers by Luna, a talking cat. Her mission is to find her other sailor soldiers and find the Princess of the Moon.\n\nNext, we move onto Shoujo. Our first entry in should be the show that kickstarted the Magical Girl archetype, and a fresh crop of tropes.\n\nSailor Moon was the other show that some on when Toonami acquired an anime license, in hopes of drawing as many girls as boys. Both shows are familiar to people who grew up in the early days but, again, they may not have known this was anime. Sailor Moon is radically different from DBZ in terms of style, plot, and characters, and rounds out the traditional anime stereotypes.\n\n3. Death Note\n\nLight Yagami finds a notebook that lets him kill any person with a scribble of their name and an image of their face. Light decides to use his new treasure to create the perfect world, but one private detective is going to give him a hard ride for his life.\n\nSo hey, you know that wall of stereotypes and strawmen we’ve built up about anime that’s kept our newcomer from ever getting into it? Time to knock it down like a toddler’s block castle.\n\nI can hardly express the endless sea of affection I have for Death Note. It’s equal parts urban fantasy, horror, and thriller, with one of the most gripping plots I’ve ever seen. But, more importantly, it couldn’t be farther away from the normal stereotypes associated with anime (besides L’s wild hairstyle). It uses the medium to great dramatic effects, sure to impress our newcomer… if Ryuk doesn’t weird them out.\n\n4. Fruits Basket\n\nTohru Honda’s life changes when she meets the Sohmas, a powerful family with a dark secret. They all change into animals when they get too excited or get hugged by someone of the opposite sex. Not only does Tohru have to keep this twisted secret, she also has to unravel a daisy-chain of family drama.\n\nTime to pull back the theatrics for something the Rom-Com fans should love.\n\nFruits Basket is a pretty heavy Slice of Life that manages to combine real life-changing drama with huge belly laughs. The anime itself is a gutted version of a much heavier manga, but still retains the same charm and grace. Furthermore, we’ll finally step away from the action to something more bittersweet and complex.\n\n5. Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood\n\nEdward and Alphonse Elric, skilled Alchemists, committed the one sin of their craft: Human Transmutation. When their attempts to revive their mother goes awry, they set out to find the Philosopher’s Stone and undo the damage done to their bodies.\n\nIt’s time to step out of Japan and into the land of well-crafted fantasy.\n\nYou knew Fullmetal Alchemist would be here at some point because it’s the one anime that anime-haters tend to like. It’s a beast of a different color, well written and well acted, and often the favorite anime of longtime Otaku.\n\nBut if you’re going to show them any FMA, for the love of God show them Brotherhood. This is the story as it was meant to be told, with the ridiculous plot holes the first show had.\n\n6. Cowboy Bebop\n\nSpike Spiegel has a simple life: hunt bounties with his partner, Jett Black, collect the money, repeat. That changes when his crew picks up the three things he can’t stand the most: a dog, a child, and a lady with attitude. Now it seems his past is also gearing up to hunt him down and make him pay…\n\nAnd now, class, we end things in a neat little boy by putting everything we’ve learned together.\n\nCowboy BeBop was the game-changer for Toonami, for anime, and for sci-fi in general. The visuals are amazing, the action smooth, and the story is award-winning for a good reason. This show is a testament that anime can have all the cliches and still be art. Yes, we have over muscular men, scantily clad women and even some mindless action scenes. But we also have a damn good story, which best illustrates why I love the medium. Yes, it has its repeat players, but there’s no limit to where you can go and just how good you can be.\n\nWhat would your anime starter pack be? Feel free to comment below! Don’t forget to like and follow if you want more content.\n\nDon’t forget to check out my Fictionpress account for more.\n\nThe Second Coming of Pokemon has been a delicious spectacle. People who used to roll their eyes at the full-grown adults buried in their Gameboy are now out trouncing about for virtual monsters. The news is once again baffled at the popularity of these Japanese creatures, and can’t pump the articles out fast enough.\n\nBut, with a flood of any fad comes the backwash, the events that make you scratch your head and ask why just why? These are the Top 5 Pokemon Go fails, proving that humanity still has to work out a few kinks in the gene pool.\n\nPokemon Gone to China\n\nFor those of you who don’t play, you catch Pokemon in-game by flicking Pokeballs at it in hopes of hitting, and catching. This takes some practice and risks wasting several precious Pokeballs, so a game where you could practice would be gobbled up pretty quick. Chinese company Rejected Games: FPS Adventure & Sport SimulationAdventure figured that out, and produced a knock-off game that has you flick colored balls at weird Pokemon knock-offs. And if the company’s name doesn’t scare you off, the knockoffs will:\n\nImage property of thenextweb.com… they can keep it.\n\nNow obviously these, er, “Pocket Monsters” can’t look like actual Pokemon lest they incur the wrath of the Nintendo Gods, but this isn’t even close. If you need some Nightmare Fuel for the day click the link in the heading.\n\nThere’s a Time and a Place to Pokemon Go…\n\nNow, I believe Pokemon Games are for everybody. I’m not judging this guy for being an adult who plays Pokemon; I’m judging him because, as an adult, he should have known better.\n\nCanadian police got themselves a scare a few days ago. A York driver was seen by a chopper driving erratically on the road, so they naturally followed it under suspicions of drunk/drugged driving. But when they did pull the man over, they discovered he wasn’t anything of the sort…He was playing Pokemon Go.\n\nThe driver is fine and got little more than a scolding and a warning ticket. I’m sure he looks forward to the day when he gets to sit down and tell future generations that he almost got a ticket for Poke’Hunting and Driving.\n\nGotta fence’em all, Pokemon!\n\nPoor Canada, just can’t catch a break today, can you?\n\nIn the game, there are areas that are called “pokestops” where you can get free items. Pokestops are usually important cultural sights, like statues, city buildings, and landmarks. This gets a lot of people in trouble for wandering into areas they shouldn’t, like soldier graveyards and other people’s houses, but this good news is that you can get the item just by being kinda close to the landmark. Naturally, these stops attract a lot of attention…sometimes, maybe, too much.\n\nToronto’s Jack Layton Ferry Terminal is a Pokestop. It got so overcrowded with people, probably hoping for rare candies, that they’ve actually built a fence to heard the Go players away from the average person who just wants to use public transit.\n\nIt’s one of many crowding problems the game has created, and probably won’t be the last. Thankfully, there are groups of players coming together to clean up litter and keep the place clean. It’s a level of responsibility I think everyone playing the game should be using.\n\nDo not Pass Pokemon Go, do not collect 200 PokeDollars.\n\nBut you know, with all these stories of people being too crowded, too stupid to drive, and too scary to comprehend, one wonders if the game has done anything good for someone. Turns out, it helped the Detroit police catch a criminal.\n\nThe game lead Michigan Man William Wilcox directly into the Milford Police station, and directly into his arrest. Wilcox wandered into the building because the game marks it as a gym, but he seemed to forget that the Police were well aware of his criminal record and that he had a warrant on him. Naturally, he was arrested on the spot but was more angry about being torn away from the game than going to jail.\n\nNOOOOO! NOT MY POKEMANS!\n\nWe won’t talk about how he was riding a bike in his pajamas while on the game. But the mental illness award doesn’t go to him. It goes to…\n\nPokemon NO means NO!\n\nAn unnamed Russian woman who has a real problem.\n\nThis unnamed woman fell asleep while playing the game, then claims that she awoke to one of the monsters raping her. When she told her husband that a virtual monster had assaulted her, he gently suggested that she go see a therapist. Instead of getting the help she clearly needed, the woman filed a report with the police, who also told her that she needed some professional help.\n\nThis also wasn’t the first oddity this woman claimed. She also claimed that her dog would start barking whenever she played the game, leaving her to believe the creatures are real. Jokes aside, it’s hard to tell if this woman just doesn’t understand what augmented reality is or if there really is a mental illness at play here. Either way, we at the Otakudon are happy that she’s seeking help, and hope she gets better.\n\nRemember kiddies, love, and peace!\n\nWhat do you love/hate about Pokemon Go?
