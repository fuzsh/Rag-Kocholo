        "text": "Post by solidsnake on\n\nThe MothaF*ckin Mailman, Majin Buu stomps all rounds. Even discounting hax, every single one of these Buus are too strong for even Midora to harm him physically. Now regarding hax, how strong was Ichiryuu and was he at full power against him? These need to be answered because in Dragon Ball, hax generally doesn't work if you're too powerful, and if Midora's powers doesn't work on foes even more powerful than himself, then Buu wouldn't have to worry about it. Besides, Buu has magic as well and vast regeneration that's limitless so long as some form of him exist.\n\nBuu is likely a better fighter however, to the point even Goku and others gave him credit, and can too mimic energy attacks and abilities that he encounters, similarly like Midora.\n\nPost by solidsnake on\n\nZero, Correction, Kid Buu destroyed his own body with an attack so potent, Goku even with Super Saiyan 3 doubted he could repel it. Super Saiyan 3 Goku, and by virtue Majin Buu, is/are WELL above solar system level, let alone large star level or even planet level.\n\nAnd Buu is known to \"job\" against lesser known forms of harms (bullets, Ki blasts etc), so Buu \"destroying\" his body is not really good evidence that he can't withstand a certain level of attack that isn't too much for him.\n\nBuu not being able to heal depends on if Ichiryuu is much stronger than Midora or not.\n\nThe MothaF*ckin Mailman, The manga showed first form Frieza is casually a large star level to dwarf star level (destroyed planet Vegeta, which is stated to have gravity 10x greater than earth which makes it even larger than Jupiter). I admit its speculation during the Android to Cell Games sagas, but Buu is at bare minimal solar system level.\n\nPost by Zero on\n\nsolidsnake except there are literally zero feats above star in the entire manga. All you have is Cell's own statement that he can destroy the solar system. As you know, all DBZ villians love to brag, how do you know Cell is any different?\n\nMidora's feat flat out stomp Buu's. He literally has no way around Minority World. Every single attack just gets reverses.\n\nIf you wanna use statements then Midora is even strong as he was holding his own against Neo, a being said to have devoured countless galaxies and tanked countless supernovas. So even by character statements (Torikos is actually an author statement so it holds more credit then Cells personal statement) Midora is superior\n\nPost by The MothaF*ckin Mailman on\n\nThe MothaF*ckin Mailman , Is Acacia stronger than Midora after he absorbed Neo?\n\nAnd it does matter, I said it generally doesn't work. There are cases where simply being stronger negates a hax, (Goku resisting Porunga's wish, Shenron being unable to kill the Androids, Vegito semi resisting the transmuting of Buu,Goku powering through time skip, Future Trunks deflecting Future Dabura's stone spit etc).\n\nAcacia is stronger(and was getting stronger) while midora could hold his own he was ultimately not as strong(they collided punches and acacia blew off midora’s arm)\n\nand those would be considered resistances for those abilities. But the fact that characters stronger than others have shown to not resist hax from weaker characters shows that it’s not simply due to being stronger. Unless there’s an outright statement here that says power is what overcomes abilities then it wouldn’t apply. Especially against hax they haven’t fought against. But as mass said those abilities are due to having set limits in their verse\n\nPost by solidsnake on\n\nZero , Exactly, in Dragon Ball these hax are negated/lessened by being superior to the caster. Shenron can't kill the Androids but he can bring them back to life, I might be wrong but I think it was stated that they can't just wish anyone too powerful for the Shenron dead. The Androids haven't shown to resist reality warping so a reality warper who is at least able to harm them with large star level attack potency would be able to affect them too.\n\nThere are numerous characters out there that can utter slaughter the stronger DBZ character but only peak human in stats.\n\nThis is simply inaccurate if the hax user hasn't used their ability on someone superior to themselves as well or showcased an ability to surpass their level.\n\nExample: Super Buu can turn Android 18, who's multiple times stronger than 100% Final Form Frieza who is possibly star level via scaling, into chocolate and eat her... No resistance, no problem. Super Buu, Gohan absorbed, can turn Super Vegito, who's multiple times stronger than the listed Super Buu, into chocolate and can't even eat him cause Vegito retained his will and power still. Now... You can claim that the earrings protected Vegito, BUT Majin Buu was going to eat the Shin, the East Kaioshin apparently before Dabura interrupted him, and he had Protara earrings too. So yeah...\n\nEdit: The MothaF*ckin Mailman,\n\nAcacia is stronger(and was getting stronger) while midora could hold his own he was ultimately not as strong(they collided punches and acacia blew off midora’s arm)\n\nand those would be considered resistances for those abilities. But the fact that characters stronger than others have shown to not resist hax from weaker characters shows that it’s not simply due to being stronger. Unless there’s an outright statement here that says power is what overcomes abilities then it wouldn’t apply. Especially against hax they haven’t fought against. But as mass said those abilities are due to having set limits in their verse\n\nWell this means that they are comparable to each other then, in which case this kinda changes things. Now the only question needing to be answer now is if Neo is equal or stronger than Majin Buu in terms of power? I believe Zero, stated that Neo was able to destroy galaxies, so is he a multi solar system level, or galaxy level? If he's the former, than Majin Buu being able to negate his hax would be useless since he's comparable and therefore vulnerable without an innate resistance not relying on his superior power shielding against Midora's hax. If so I'll concede Round 1 to Midora.\n\nPost by Zero on\n\nsolidsnake, No Shenron's wish is reality warping, that's what wishing is. He is limited to the power of his creator, so if his creator doesn't have enough power to kill someone, then he doesn't.\n\nThat example shows exactly what I'm saying though. DBZ characters actually have a shown limit to this hax capacity. The Chocolate Beam failed to completely work on Vegito so anyone that level or above wouldn't be effected by it.\n\nLet me give you an example. This is Tyki Mikk from D.Gray-Man.\n\nHe is passively intangible to all creation on the conceptual level. He could walk right up to Vegito and rip his heart out regardless of Vegito being superior to his in every stat a thousand times over.\n\nSo even if a DBZ character is stronger, a hax character's ability will work just fine. You start to get into NLF terrority when you talking about abilities used on fodder or plain humans, or resistances to hax, but in general the durability ignoring stuff is fine.\n\nSomething like Minority World that is literally reversing events, is well beyond anything seen in the DBZ series. DBZ characters just have no way to counter it. Imagine Buu goes to punch Midora. That punch misses or the harm that punch would have caused, instead acts to heal Midora. Same with Buu's very life. What is keeping him alive under Minority World would actually start to kill him. Its just that powerful of an ability. Yes you can counter it, but Buu is WAY too stupid to think of a way around it like Acacia did.\n\nPost by solidsnake on\n\nZero, Oh okay but this doesn't change anything. Shenron's creator is weaker than the Androids, so it wouldn't work, so a weak reality warper wouldn't be able to make them goo if they wanted cause they aren't powerful enough.\n\nTyki wouldn't be able to though unless he showed feats of doing this to someone more powerful than himself or someone who has feats or statememts on various levels. For example if Tyki can rip out someone on Silver Surfer's level, then we'd know he can rip out anyone's heart even if they are powerful enough to destroy solar systems, so in this sense, he'd be able to kill a lot of DBZ. Buu wouldn't have to think if he's too strong but it's established that Midora is comparable to Neo, so Majin Buu might lose. But it isn't a NLF, its simple, if Dragon Ball is stronger than the user, they can resist the hax. If they are weaker, then they are vulnerable to it if they don't have a specific invulnerability to the hax."
