        "text": "Majin Boo (魔人ブウ Majin Bū), spelled \"Majin Buu\" in the Funimation anime dub and translated as \"Djinn-Boo\" in the Viz Media manga, is a fictional character and the final antagonist of the Dragon Ball manga series created by Akira Toriyama. He is introduced in chapter #460 Majin Boo Appears?! (魔人ブウ出現か!? Majin Bū Shutsugen ka!?) first published in Weekly Shōnen Jump on June 3, 1995. Majin Boo is a magical life form created by the evil warlock Bibbidi that terrorized galaxies by destroying entire planets, millions of years before the events of Dragon Ball take place. He was temporarily sealed away and brought to Earth, however, Bibbidi was killed and Boo hidden. During the series, he is revived by Bibbidi's son Bobbidi in order to carry on his father's plan to conquer the entire universe. Majin Boo was rated by Wizard magazine as the 40th greatest villain of all time, the only anime or manga character from Japan to make the list.\n\nMajin Boo has several different forms, each with a different appearance and personality, however, all are pink creatures with an antennae on their head and several holes/pores on both sides of their heads and on their arms. They have a rubbery body that can regenerate instantly from any wound, separate parts of it from themselves and control them independently, and can even completely restore themselves from vapor. Boo can also heal damaged beings, and can absorb other organisms by enveloping them with his body or eating them, the latter done by using his signature attack that turns people into food such as candy. When first introduced he is overweight and wears gloves, boots, a vest and a cape. He is very naive and childlike, taking joy in fighting and scaring people. Throughout the series, he is always referred to by either Majin Boo or simply Boo, no matter what form he is in. However, each form has been given their own names in guidebooks, video games or by fans, in order to distinguish between them. When Boo expels the evil inside him, it takes on a taller and much skinnier, frail form referred to as \"Pure Evil Majin Boo\" (魔人ブウ 純粋悪 Majin Bū Junsui Aku?), or \"Evil Buu\" in English fandom. When this Boo absorbs the fat one, they become what is referred to as \"Evil Majin Boo\" (魔人ブウ 悪 Majin Bū Aku), or \"Super Buu\". This form is much more muscular and stronger, and losses the vest and gloves, now but wears long-legged pants. Personality-wise, he is more intelligent than the other forms and is described as \"pure rage\". This intelligence allows him to plan ahead for the opportunity to absorb Gotenks and Piccolo, and later Gohan. After absorbing the first two, his antennae grows, he forms five full-fingers and wears the vest typical of all \"fused\" characters, when he absorbs Gohan, he wears his dōgi top and undershirt. The last form shown, referred to as \"Pure Majin Boo\" (魔人ブウ 純粋 Majin Bū Junsui) or \"Kid Buu\", is actually Boo's original, and appears when Gohan, Gotenks, Piccolo and the fat Boo are removed from his body. Appearance-wise, he is the same as the first Evil Majin Boo form only smaller, however he is the most reckless, living only to destroy. He is called \"evil incarnate\" and regarded \"most difficult\" by Lords of Lords. Even after Pure Majin Boo is killed, the fat Majin Boo lives on Earth now completely-kindhearted and known as Mr. Boo (ミスター・ブウ Misutā Bū). In the anime, Boo's \"Evil\" and \"Pure\" forms' designs differ from the manga in that they both always have five fingers. Boo, Bibbidi and Bobbidi take their names from the song \"Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo\" in the Walt Disney movie Cinderella. The Daizenshuu 2: Story Guide guidebook says that Majin Boo was modeled after Toriyama's editor at the time, Fuyuto Takeda."
