        "text": "——How did you end up getting hooked on Dragon Ball again as adults?\n\nTanabe: I ended up re-watching it because TOKYO MX began showing reruns of Dragon Ball Z on Tuesdays. I was about 27 at the time and I fell in love with it.\n\nSakayori: Tanabe and I had teamed up professionally around that time, and one day she asked me if I liked Gohan after saying something like, \"I actually can't forgive him for what he did.\" It was the first time I had ever met someone who didn't like Gohan. I never knew anyone like that existed. I had to know more, so I decided to re-read the manga by using the money I had saved from my part-time job at Hidakaya (a Japanese restaurant chain) and buying the entire Complete Edition. I read it from top to bottom and I was hooked.\n\n——I have to ask, Tanabe, what was your problem with Gohan?\n\nTanabe: It was the way he behaved in the Cell arc (referring to when Gohan had the chance to finish Cell off for good, but didn't do so, allowing Cell the opportunity to almost blow himself up, which forced Goku to sacrifice his life). Seeing that just got my blood boiling, and my anger led to a bit of a conflict with Sakayori, so I went around asking other comedians what they thought about Gohan. Even though I say I don't like him, I probably think about him more than anyone else (laughs).\n\n——Has your impression of Dragon Ball changed as an adult?\n\nTanabe: My impression of Dragon Ball as an adult is entirely different from when I was a kid. When I was a kid my takeaway was just, \"Goku's strong!\" and \"Only Goku can beat him!\" and the like. That's why I could hardly believe it when Gohan found a level of strength above his father's.\n\nAlso, I don't think I liked Vegeta and Piccolo as a kid either since they were both bad guys. I couldn't appreciate how their characters developed as the story progressed.\n\nBut revisiting it as an adult, I think all of the characters have their own unique appeal, not just Goku.\n\nAnd now I understand that it's only natural Gohan did what he did. He was only 10 years old after all, so of course he got carried away after gaining so much power all at once. But as a kid I just couldn't understand his state of mind at the time.\n\nSakayori: Tanabe's outlook on Gohan was so foreign to me. When I was a kid, Gohan was the closest to me in age, so I really identified with him while I watched. So the reason I ended up liking Piccolo was because he was nice to Gohan. Now as an adult it's the opposite; I find Gohan too strong and hard to relate to.\n\nTanabe: Our thoughts on the characters changed a lot.\n\nSakayori: The same goes for Krillin. I thought he was so awful for cheating in order to pass Kamesennin's test. But after watching the series as a whole, I don't think of him that way at all.\n\nSakayori: She refused to give up despite how much pain she was in and even with everyone, including Gohan, telling her to throw in the towel. Also, now that I'm an adult I picked up on the fact that she doesn't hate her dad, Mr. Satan, at all; she actually respects him. That must mean he's a good father in his own right, too.\n\nTanabe: True! You might be right. Especially considering she was in high school during the Majin Buu arc, and kids that age tend to resent their fathers a little.\n\nIn Dragon Ball, it's normal for the main cast to fly and shoot blasts of energy. But Videl is just an ordinary girl, so she can't do any of that at the start. Despite that monolithic gap in strength, she never quits, and that's one of the things that makes her strong. If it were me, I'd just accept that those people are in a different league and call it quits, but Videl always did her best. She's awesome. Toriyama creates female characters who are stylish, cool, and strong, but also feel realistic.\n\nSakayori: Videl is a character who, while very pretty and cute, isn't that different from normal women. She feels like someone that could be living somewhere not that far away from us. And after she married Gohan and had a kid, she became a great mom too.\n\nSakayori: I tend to daydream about Piccolo training me at my old job (laughs). When I heard about the trailer for the latest movie (Dragon Ball Super: SUPER HERO, which premiered 6/11/2022 in Japan), for some reason Tanabe was under the impression Vegeta was going to be working at a bread store. Ever since then we've had a lot of fun chats about what would happen if Piccolo ran a bakery! (laughs)\n\nTanabe: Like, what kind of bread Piccolo would bake and so on. No matter what we're talking about, at some point Dragon Ball ends up becoming the topic of discussion. (laughs)\n\nSakayori: I'd daydream like that by myself as a kid, but those fantasies became way more elaborate once I talked about them with Tanabe.\n\nTanabe: I'm usually not a fan of making up stories like that, but it's actually fun to do when Sakayori's around to talk to. I think our greatest work is our story about Piccolo and the others going to Disneyland. (laughs)\n\n——One of the most noteworthy aspects of the new movie is the large role that Gohan plays. Did that help change your thoughts about him, Tanabe?\n\nTanabe: Quite a lot, yes. I actually buried the hatchet with Gohan a little bit before I saw the movie. Tomohiro Kamiyama from Johnny's West is also a Dragon Ball fan, and any time we perform together that's all we talk about. But I realized I had never asked him which character he liked, so one time I tried asking, and he told me he liked Gohan from the Cell arc. I remember thinking about how he's my least favorite and I just blurted out, \"I don't like that version of Gohan.\" I always make it a point not to put down things other people like, so I must have been trying to sabotage myself or something when I said that. I've regretted it ever since.\n\nAfter that happened, I felt it was time to finally confront Gohan by watching the Cell arc one more time. When I did so, I came to realize that he made that mistake because he was so young. For me, the movie's premier couldn't have been timed any better, since it came out just after I made my peace with Gohan.\n\nSakayori: You finally learned to get along with him.\n\nTanabe: I felt a lot of anticipation after I saw the trailer when it showed Gohan in his glasses turning Super Saiyan. It was the first time I had ever felt that way towards him. I'm a sucker for blond guys with glasses (laughs).\n\nI came into the movie with the attitude that I was apologizing to Gohan for misunderstanding him and saying I didn't like him. Thanks to that, I really appreciated his relationship with Piccolo and how much he cherished his daughter, Pan. I always thought of Gohan as a child, but the movie made me realize how amazing he had become. I really enjoyed it.\n\nSakayori: When I heard Piccolo would be taking the lead in the story, all the thoughts and feelings I had towards Piccolo deep inside began to swell, almost to the point that I was a little scared to watch the movie. There's such a huge difference between Piccolo that I daydreamed about and the real character. I felt as though I owed him an apology or something. But when I watched the movie for myself, I felt like we became friends and that maybe he would go to Disneyland with me after all. He became my ideal Piccolo (laughs). I felt confident that even after I become an old woman, I'll always like Piccolo, and that put my mind at ease.\n\nTanabe: I also really loved the previous movie, Dragon Ball Super: Broly, but SUPER HERO exceeded all my expectations. It's my favorite of all the movies so far. I know they can't hold special screenings where the audience is allowed to participate through cheering due to current circumstances, but if they had one for this movie, I'm sure the audience would get fired up. Once it comes out on home video, I want to have a special screening with Sakayori and cheer with her. But in any case, I think it's amazing how Dragon Ball can continue to find new ways to be fun and exciting even though it's been around for so long.\n\n——Has Dragon Ball had any effect on the way you think or your outlook on life?\n\nSakayori: After realizing how amazing Krillin is, I find myself wanting to put all my effort into the things I'm able to do. And I really admire Videl's unwavering determination too.\n\nTanabe: It might have had the same effect on me too. No matter how desperate things get, the characters in Dragon Ball never give up. Even if it's the type of situation that anyone would want to run away from, they still push forward and never back down. I also feel like I learned a lot about cherishing those closest to me from Dragon Ball.\n\nSakayori: Before we all formed the Borujuku quartet, Tanabe and I used to be a duo known as Nekojuku, and our other two members, Haru and Anri, used to be a rival duo called Shinboru. Now we're all good friends who compete together as part of the same comedy group. That's a lot like Dragon Ball when you think about it.\n\n——Even the name Borujuku is like the fusion name of your two groups.\n\nTanabe: Now that you mention it, you're right! Also, I'm not comparing him to anyone else specifically, but to me, Goku is the greatest hero. There's other manga that I like too, but I don't think anyone is able to measure up to Goku in my mind.\n\nSakayori: Whenever Goku appears, you know things will work out.\n\nTanabe: But these days I find Vegeta really appealing.\n\nSakayori: When you grow up, you want someone who shows a little vulnerability over someone who's the absolute strongest.\n\nTanabe: Exactly. The flaws in a person show their humanity, which is appealing. Vegeta realizes when he's lost, and the strength he gains through that despair is attractive. Even Goten and the others talk to Vegeta like he's family. As time passed on, even Vegeta grew close with those around him. It's easy for us to miss details like that as readers, but it's deeply moving when you stop and think about it (laughs). It's hard to get a sense of the passage of time in most manga, but many Dragon Ball characters show signs of aging. Like how Goku hit that huge growth spurt before one of the Tenkaichi Budokai tournaments. I'll never get over how shocking it was when he first appeared like that. Even though he hadn't changed one bit on the inside (laughs).\n\nTanabe: We've also talked about dressing Mitarashi-chan up as a Dragon Ball character and doing a group cosplay together.\n\nSakayori: Anri would be Karin, Tanabe would be Yajirobe, and I'd be Kami. Haru (Haruka Kiriyu) would cosplay as Mr. Popo and her son would be a young Goku. The reason is because all those characters have spent at least some time in Kami's Palace high above Earth.\n\nTanabe: Having kids around means that there are more ways to enjoy Dragon Ball.\n\nSakayori: Since my son is interested in Dragon Ball, I'm starting to watch it with him. Of course there are newer movies to enjoy, but I'm sure I'll discover new things by re-watching the older works with him. I think the way I perceive things changes, not just because I'm getting older, but also because of my new lifestyle.\n\nTanabe: I can see a lot of little Pan in Mitarashi-chan when I watch Dragon Ball, so that creates all sorts of new emotions. I think that's one new discovery right there. Being able to share the things you watched as a child with the children of today is really something special.\n\n——Both of you seem to have found a lot of Dragon Ball's deeper aspects by re-reading it.\n\nSakayori: I urge anyone who never re-reads manga to reconsider. Of course I also want them to watch the recent anime too.\n\nTanabe: For anyone who doesn't know whether to read the manga or watch the anime because they're both so long, I say you can't go wrong with either. Once you start, you won't be able to stop!\n\nSakayori: For some reason I started with Volume 9 and read it all the way to the end, so I started re-reading it from Volume 1 (laughs). So it's fine if you don't necessarily start from the very beginning.\n\nTanabe: Just like how Goku and the others always seek out ways to become stronger, I want us to continue to grow as people. You should never be satisfied with things being \"good enough\". As a performer, I never want to compromise when it comes to my comedy. I'll always strive to improve."
