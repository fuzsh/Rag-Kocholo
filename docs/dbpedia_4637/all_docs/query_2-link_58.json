        "text": "DBZ is better because it knew what it was about from the start. I didn't watch Dragon ball for love themes and it didn't give them to me. Nor did I look to naruto for them, and it gave me half-ass shit that was Dragon-ball quality developments while trying to pretend it was more then that. Make up your mind Kishi.\n\nMind you if Dragon ball had any fault it is that Toriyama backpedaled on his goals for Gohan. Quite frankly I feel he sabotaged his work by doing so.\n\nHowever I've now got The God of High School as my modern DbZ, so I ain't even mad. I just read my badass moments and blow my load.\n\nDBZ wasn't going to be perfect it put itself out there and made its faults which other authors could look to avoid in their works. Frankly Kishi is on some shit and it seemed like he also had some good ideas he let himself get talked out of but god damn his execution was worse.\n\nFrankly I don't give a darn if you're trying to make a more \"complex\" environment when it's all done poorly.\n\nDBZ delivered on powering up and kicking ass which is what you wanted from it.\n\nIf you mean Naruto and Sasuke as Saiyans I suppose.\n\nIf you meant Toriyama, I don't really think that was a problem because he was phasing out the other races from basically the Saiyans arc slowly. Picollo lingered due to the Nail boost but he was falling out to to by the end of the Cell arc he was basically with the humans. That's a given though because he was trying to recenter the story around Gohan as he was ending Gokus story.\n\nThe goof is bringing Goku back and worst yet making Goku complete your story when you purposefully phasing him out. This kind of backpedaling hurt DBZ.\n\nNaruto backpedaled even more which is the real reason why the rookie abuse was terrible. Story constantly could not make up its mind on whether teams were important or not. It wanted to play an underdog story and yet made its underdog the chosen one. What the fuck. Then when its done the chosen one story...it tries to bring back in teams...\n\nEr because Z fighters are always sitting duck in DB er.... they are more involve in every fight unlike the rookies who only appeared in the war..\n\nKP - Faced Roshi and Tein and almost lost\n\nP Jr. - Face krillin and Krillin surprised him a lot of times.\n\nRaditz - P. Jr Killed him\n\nFrieza - Piccolo made him work in their fight that he needed to remove his power suppressor\n\nCell - Cell was getting owned by the Z fighter, Tien was beating the shit out of him until Vegeta allowed him to absorb the android...\n\nBwahahahahahhaha\n\nlol @ the shilling you're doing.\n\nRoshi did the Mafuba like a total amateur. He even notes this before he dies.\n\nTien couldn't do the Mafuba because he broke the pot which he was going to use to seal KP. Then he gets owned by one of KP's offspring.\n\nP Jr vs Krillin- quitted against that battle with him\n\nRaditz- Goku had to full nelson him for Piccolo to kill him. Surprisingly out all of Goku's rivals Piccolo is the only one who killed him. Though to the dismay of most readers he's shafted in the Buu arc. One of the shittiest arcs that comes close to being DBGT laden.\n\nFREEZA- (there's no \"I\" ) Yeah, Piccolo did do a pretty neat job until Freeza used his third form against him. That's the only arc in which the Saiyans weren't humping the hell out of the spotlight.\n\nCell- Only quality characters Piccolo and Tien got in a few shots before plot took over. Also Its Vegeta who was beating the shit out of Cell but got bored and said \"hey make it a challenge for me\" and stupidly lets him absorb the last android to become perfect. Cue Curbstomping\n\n@Cubey\n\nThe Rookie Nine had their moments of stardom in war arc. Shino's bug pirahna'ing the Juubi in Juubi revival arc was awesome.\n\nAlso even though it's \"filler\" Torune vs Shino was pretty fun. Moreover,adding in the bit with Torune joining Root in place of Shino (which is noted in the databook) is smart.\n\n@Unlosing Ranger\n\nlol so you're saying the Buu arc (the lowest point of DBZ) is better than Naruto.\n\n[YOUTUBE]FopyRHHlt3M[/YOUTUBE]\n\nOh, another one of these threads.\n\nVegeta's development severely trumps any character from Naruto.\n\nDragon Ball had a better and more likeable character cast by far. Just because Naruto had a more diverse range of characters doesn't mean shit when a majority of them were poorly designed and under-developed. Not to mention, a problem with Naruto's cast is certain characters only appealed to certain types of people. Which in the Shonen field, is pretty poor if mangaka are still pulling that off post 2005. Which they all are.\n\nDragonBall's plot was executed much better overall for what resources inside and out of the series it had to build from. Naruto on the other hand, not even close compared to Dragon Ball but still mediocre in itself. Yes DragonBall was a lot simpler and straight-forward although it was what the series and it's time demanded. Naruto on the other hand from the beginning forcibly kept pushing itself for the sake of it, losing merit over time.\n\nA lot of series nowadays in general outside of the manga medium try to fall back and rely on complexity, twist and jigsaw puzzle writing as an arch way and cheap method for good writing when really it's nothing but expected nowadays and no way at all captivating when concluded. I think Naruto can be considered one of those series which over time failed with even doing that right.\n\nNaruto obviously conveyed more messages and philosophical meaning with both it's dialogue and action. Although again means nothing since it wasn't consistent and it was way too forced onto the reader. DragonBall never tried to do or was about that, so that flaw and only thing going for Naruto in this comparison now is a meaningless point.\n\n-\n\nAlso, something that I don't understand is why people are going on about the Boo Arc. Is this an NF exclusive opinion? It was good and perfectly fine. I honestly don't remember people complaining about it on MFG or Daizex. It must be an NF thing because I only see people complain about it on here. Boo Arc single handedly destroys any Naruto Arc.\n\nHonestly I hate DBZ. It's easily one of the worst anime/manga I've seen. At least on the same level as fairy tail. arguably worse.\n\nDBZ only got the fame it did cause of the time it came out in. But even then it was never the best shit then. Sailor moon, cowboy bebop, inuyasha, and yuyu hakusho were WAY better. And that's just to name a few.\n\nIt has some of the worst characters I've ever seen in a fiction such as all the awful side/main characters like krillin, yamcha, bulma, chichi, gohan, master roshi, mr. hercule, videl, tien, etc. Let's also not forget about all of the horrible villians either like raddiz, nappa, the ginyu force and the rest of frieza's stooges, the androids minus 18, all forms of majin buu(Shudder), babidi, etc. The villians are so generic and often incredibly stupid and silly so you can't even take them seriously. Hell the same thing can be said for the non villians too. And goku is a huge mary sue. The author spent more time dick riding the main cast and so many of the other characters irrelevent.\n\nThe plot/premise/story to the series was also awful as well. It was basically just bad guy comes to take over/destroy earth and good guys have to stop him over and over. It's so repititive and predictable it's painful.\n\nThe fights in DBZ also sucked too. It was basically just characters punching and kicking at one another at really fast speed and lobing ki blasts at one another every now and then. 60% of the fights were that and one character was dominating another. They quickly became repititive and boring.\n\nThere was hardly any world building at all.\n\nMore than anything DBZ was just too simplistic which is never a good way to go when writting a story. It doesn't give the reader anything new or anything worthwhile to look forward to. If DBZ came out now it woulden't have been well recieved at all. If I had to rate it overall I'd give it a 2 out of 10 at best. Even my little pony is a better written series than DBZ as it has a better story and cast of characters as well as world building.\n\nAnd don't even get me started on dragonball GT. That shit was far worse than even twilight.\n\nDBZ is no where close to naruto in quality. Not even 0.002% of it's quality. I don't even need to compare the entirety of naruto to prove my point that it's better. The land of waves arc on it's own is far better over the entirety of DBZ. It had better plot, characters, fights, etc.\n\nDBZ and naruto should never be compared to one another because naruto is better than DBZ in every way possible. Better characters, better story, better world building, better art and character designs, and it actually went beyond the repetitive simplistic bullshit that DBZ constantly shoves down your throat. It actually made you think more and is very deep and philosophical. DBZ just sucks. Straight up. It would be better to compare it to fairy tail than naruto."
