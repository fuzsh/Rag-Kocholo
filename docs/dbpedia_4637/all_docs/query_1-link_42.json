        "text": "Buu is about SSJ3 Gotenks strength (was able to fly around the world a couple dozen times real fast, and is arguably FtL). He can absorb attacks, and regenerate from physical damage. He also has the ability to learn new techniques from simply watching someone else perform them. He can also breathe in space.\n\nSupes ahs all his regular stuff- speed, strength, tight spandex etc.\n\nWho'd win?\n\nDiscuss\n\nIn my opinion Super Buu takes this.\n\nEndless mike you went over board with the first part, every character includes being such as dragons the witches and demons of dbz, if you count the anime that includes garlic junior making this being imortal, shit just look at goku and vegeeta fusion then take every character in the universe. Or was it some far of exageration either way i can't backspace now\n\nAnycase i think superman prime would win i guess he could burn him to a crisp with his heat beam.\n\nAll of you are DBZ haters and also Fools!\n\nMajin Buu will beat the crap out of Supes Prime.'\n\nMajin Buu is Magic that is what he is, he has more power than SupermanPrime and he is his weakness. Super Buu will easily kill Superman, Buu is indestructible he will turn Supes Prime into a freakein Candy or milk, or stone!\n\nIT is over Buu has won this easily.\n\nPhenomenol said:\n\nAll of you are DBZ haters and also Fools!\n\nMajin Buu will beat the crap out of Supes Prime.'\n\nMajin Buu is Magic that is what he is, he has more power than SupermanPrime and he is his weakness. Super Buu will easily kill Superman, Buu is indestructible he will turn Supes Prime into a freakein Candy or milk, or stone!\n\nIT is over Buu has won this easily.\n\nAm I the only one that thinks this guy is a retard?\n\nObviously I meant every canon character.\n\nBesides, Garlic Junior's 'immortality' could likely be voided by a being more powerful than the dragon that granted it in the first place.\n\nNo, if you get imortality you are pretty much imortal, there is no voiding it, you could potentially trap someone, but look at the fusion between goku and vegita do that with every single being in dbz the power would be stupid. Superman prime would not deal with it, if you think so this can go in the bias of characters thread.\n\nAm I the only one that thinks this guy is a retard?\n\nMany say it but i think they jump on the bandwagon. give the guy a break after all we are supposed to argue who would win not all say ''this person would own''\n\nIn anycase i think superman prime would win this buus regen isn't as good and i think supermans heat vision or other random power could vapourtise buu into nothing.\n\nPhenomenol said:\n\nAll of you are DBZ haters and also Fools!\n\nMajin Buu will beat the crap out of Supes Prime.'\n\nMajin Buu is Magic that is what he is, he has more power than SupermanPrime and he is his weakness.

Supes Prime is practically invincible.\n\ngunners said:\n\nMany say it but i think they jump on the bandwagon. give the guy a break after all we are supposed to argue who would win not all say ''this person would own''\n\nIn anycase i think superman prime would win this buus regen isn't as good and i think supermans heat vision or other random power could vapourtise buu into nothing.\n\nI'd give the guy a break, but he's too much of a god damned DBZ fanboy. I read that Saint Seiyaa vs DBZ thread, and he spammed, atleast 5 times 'Guldo says STOP Game Over!'\n\nI mean, wtf? The BD is about debates, using logic. His posts go against all logic, he just makes thinks up and presents them as facts, expecting that everyone will follow him because 'DBZ is unbeatbabel!!!11'\n\nI lost respect for such fanboys a long time ago.\n\nAm I the only one that thinks this guy is a retard?\n\nNo all of you are DC/Marvel Fanboys.\n\nSo give me a logical reason why SMP will defeat Super Buu 3!\n\nDo not give me any Garbage because he will, Unless You show me a scan how he is going to do it. Otherwise you do not know what the Fuck you are talking about. All of you in here are controlled by Fanboyism.\n\nI think God would have difficulty with Superman Prime.\n\nThat said, Supes FTW!\n\nIs this a post form Cinder and Smoke, I believe it is. You are the damn retard and the Supes fanboy, I even know DBZ has no chance against Gods and yet you think SupesPrime can handle God. You are an idiot.\n\nPhenomenol said:\n\nNo all of you are DC/Marvel Fanboys.\n\nSo give me a logical reason why SMP will defeat Super Buu 3!\n\nDo not give me any Garbage because he will, Unless You show me a scan how he is going to do it. Otherwise you do not know what the Fuck you are talking about. All of you in here are controlled by Fanboyism.\n\nShow me a scan and tell me why Supes Prime will defeat Super Buu 3? Unless any of you damn Superman Fanboys can come up with Locial reasons then shut the heall up.\n\nAll of you guys claims are baseless, Also Do not Show me any Geek Feats about him jumping from the earth to the moon, or travelling so fast the liquor store.\n\nSHOW ME THIS OVERRATED BASTARD IN BATTLE!!! ACTUALLY FIGHTING SOMEONE! Not pushing a planet.\n\nAnyway, if you do not know Superman Prime's powers, then how the fuck can you prove that Super Buu can beat him?\n\nI know his fucking powers you geek! I just do not want too see the same images as before, No jumping to the moon in a single leap, no pushing planets, no fucking traveling so fast to the liquor store Feats!\n\nThese are All USELESS FEATS!!!\n\nI specifically want TO SEE SUPERMAN PRIME IN BATTLE! THAT ISWHEN YOU CAN REALLY TELL A CHARACTER\"S POWERS!\n\nP.S. Get Off SUPERMAN\"S NUTS, He is the most overatted character in all of history.\n\nI don't really like Superman yet I can understand that Prime will wipe the floor with Buu.\n\nAgain, Prime is basically invincible Buu has no chance of winning.\n\nHere is another ilogical post, Again escaflowne3 where the hell is your proof? do not make baseless claims when you do not even know what you re talking about. If you do not know just be quiet and learn.\n\nDamn this is a quote with no Logic!\n\nGet off DBZ, there are stronger universes out there, yet you blandly state that nothing can beat them, dipshit.\n\nUseless? I think not. Distance and weight can give an indication of his powers with out actually having to see them.\n\nBut then again, logic is not something you're familiar with, now is it\n\nGet off DBZ, there are stronger universes out there, yet you blandly state that nothing can beat them, dipshit.\n\nare you stupid, yeah you are. I said that DBZ is not even the strongest in the manga universe, I have stated dozens of times that plenty of worlds will destroy DBZ, but Sure as hell ain't Superman!\n\nUseless? I think not. Distance and weight can give an indication of his powers with out actually having to see them.\n\nWrong Tramp! None of hose hit back, Show me the calibur of opponents that Superman prime fights and how well he fights in battle. Because this is Super Buu 3 vs. Superman Prime! Not fucking Superman Prime vs. the moon Dipshit!\n\nBut then again, logic is not something you're familiar with, now is it\n\nVery familair with it. I post scans to back my claims up, but what do you do just make fanboyism claims.\n\nPhenomenol said:\n\nNo all of you are DC/Marvel Fanboys.\n\nSo give me a logical reason why SMP will defeat Super Buu 3!\n\nDo not give me any Garbage because he will, Unless You show me a scan how he is going to do it. Otherwise you do not know what the Fuck you are talking about. All of you in here are controlled by Fanboyism.\n\nOh, the familiarities!"
