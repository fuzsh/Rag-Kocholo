        "meta_description": "To say that the world lost a legend this month would be putting it lightly. Akira Toriyama, the renowned artist and creator of Dragon Ball Z and countless other works, passed away on March 1st, 2024. His most well-known work would have to be Dragon Ball and its many sequels, as well as Dr. Slump, Sand Land and his character design for the Dragon Quest games, Blue Dragon, and Chrono Trigger--considered by many to be the greatest game of all time. The impact of his loss is shown in comments made by fellow manga artists such as Eiichiro Oda, creator of One Piece, who stated: “May heaven be the joyous world he envisioned.” Toriyama’s work is celebrated not just in Japan, but in popular culture worldwide, transcending the anime and manga niche. The Dragon Ball character Goku has become such an icon that he is now part of the Macy's Thanksgiving parade alongside superhero icons like Spider-Man. With this list of his work, you can enjoy one of his many artistic creations and celebrate his life. In Toriyama’s own words: “Tackle Life with as much energy as Goku! I’ll try to do the same!”",
