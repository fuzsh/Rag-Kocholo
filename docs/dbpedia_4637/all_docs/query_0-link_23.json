        "text": "Dragon Ball Z and Pok√©mon are two franchises that have invaded the homes of many anime fans around the world with their memorable characters, breathtaking action scenes, and iconic soundtracks.\n\nWe would even agree that Dragon Ball and Pok√©mon are two of the most popular Japanese anime of all time. They are so ingrained in today's pop culture that even people who know absolutely nothing about them and/or don't watch anime are familiar with these two series and may even be big fans üòç\n\nThis has even become a fact. Whenever someone asks a fan about the animated series that had an impact on their childhood, one of these two franchises is very often announced in the discussion. If DBZ characters had access to Pok√©mon, it would be interesting to theorize which creatures each individual would choose to accompany them, don't you think?\n\nWhich Pok√©mon would a Dragon Ball Z character choose on their team? We are going to see that in this article because it is an analysis that you have asked us a lot by return emails! And we promise, Team Rocket won't come to bother us in our quest! üê±‚Äçüë§\n\nIf you like articles of this style, you can also find our comparison between Gogeta and Vegeto !\n\n10. GOKU & SIMIABRAZ\n\nLet's start with Goku's team with probably the most obvious choice: the 4th generation evolved starter, Simiabraz . It is the last evolution of Marmoset, one of the starter Pok√©mon of the Sinnoh region. A Fire and Fighting type Pok√©mon that makes it a perfect companion for Goku , as they both live to fight! But it wasn't just Simiabraz's guy that landed him on Goku's team. üî•\n\nWhenever someone contemplates Goku's worst character traits, many will point out his urge to fight his opponents and train excessively. Chichi will confirm it to you! Despite what some may say about these traits, Goku will always seek out powerful fighters who will help him achieve his goals and progress. And one such powerful fighter who could give Goku a daily workout would be Simiabraz . üí•\n\nIndeed, Simiabraz is a Pok√©mon who likes to fight as much as Goku and who will not hesitate to refuse if he is offered a match against the iconic Saiyan. Plus, Goku loves bringing out his opponent's full strength, and seeing his Simiabraz unleash its true power via the Blaze ability against him is worth watching! üëÄ\n\nFinally, Simiabraz is loosely based on Son Gok≈´, the \"Monkey King\" and main protagonist of Journey to the West. Dragon Ball's Son Goku is also based on the same character and the original Dragon Ball series was also loosely based on the Journey to the West story. Additionally, Simiabraz 's fiery hairstyle makes him look like a Super Saiyan. Like Goku, when Simiabraz 's health decreases, his attacks become stronger, awesome right?\n\n9. VEGETA & NIDOKING\n\nWhile many Saiyans fan questions still need answers, and hopefully we'll have some by the next few episodes of the new Dragon Ball Super anime series, understanding Vegeta's role as a Saiyan prince doesn't. is not something fans would like to hear again. Vegeta is a very proud fighter who does not like defeat, he is very haughty and has always liked to have the upper hand over his opponents, even over Goku, of whom he is intimately jealous of his power and his abilities to transform into Super. Saiyan God. üî•\n\nSo it would be obvious that having a king-like Pok√©mon at his side would be something Vegeta wouldn't mind accepting, as it would automatically highlight that pedestal he likes to place himself on. ü•á\n\nAfter much thought, we decided to award him the famous Nidoking! This Pok√©mon has been around since the very first versions of the franchise and is a powerful fighter at a high level. He is a poison and ground type, which fits well with Vegeta's cunning while mastering powerful skills rooted in his blood. He's quite rough around the edges, and has a hard head. üêó\n\nThe Nidoking's tails can break large combos and command respect in combat and are creatures known to lash out at their opponents , shattering the bones of their prey in a fraction of a second. The Pok√©mon's horns can crush diamonds, and although it is difficult to control when it goes on a rampage, Vegeta would have no problem sending sense back into his partner Nidoking's skull. ü¶¥\n\n8. TRUNKS OF THE FUTURE & EXAGID\n\nDespite his characteristics that differentiate him from his father Vegeta , Future Trunks has proven on numerous occasions why he is a Saiyan that anyone should underestimate on the battlefield. He also marked the DBZ saga from his first appearance on screen, when he came down to earth to warn the saiyans and fighters that an imminent threat was going to arrive soon to destroy the planet, the androids. When ranking Future Trunks ' best fights, many will also notice his excellent swordsmanship and hand-to-hand technicality. ‚öî\n\nGiven his attachment to his sword, it makes sense that Trunks would team up with a living, powerful sword and shield Pok√©mon like Exagis . Many Pok√©mon kings possessed Exagis because they could protect themselves from harm and reduce their opponent's attack power with its abilities. It is part of the 6th generation and is therefore quite recent in the series. His futuristic design will also match his saiyan counterpart. It is part of the Steel and Ghost type category and its concept is very special. It is said that this Pok√©mon is capable of discovering and analyzing the regal qualities of people. üëë\n\nAccording to legend, if he recognizes a character as worthy of holding him, then he would be destined to become king. Could this be a potential analogy to the succession of the Saiyan Prince? In any case, Exagide has long been the darling of generations of kings as noted above. His spectral powers and his presence also allow him to control and manipulate his colleagues and humans, a bit like Trunks from the Future! üõ°\n\n7. GOHAN & LUCARIO\n\nThere were several moments in DBZ where Gohan felt like a better protagonist than Goku, whether it was during his fight with Cell and his transformation into SSJ and his training with Piccolo. Although Gohan doesn't get the treatment some fans expect from his character, he can still hold his own against several very strong villains and opponents.\n\nAs with Piccolo, Lucario would be a great companion for Gohan. Lucario is a Dual Fighting/Steel-type Pok√©mon that is often mistaken for a Psychic-type due to the Psychic-type aura blasts it can unleash, and it's because of these aura blasts that we thought that Lucario would be perfect for Son Gohan's Pok√©mon team. üí•\n\nLucario is known as the Aura Pok√©mon, capable of feeling the emotions of others and using this strength in battle. Since both characters enjoy bringing peace to the world and are driven by emotion, Lucario would be a perfect Pok√©mon for Gohan. In addition, we will add to this Pok√©mon its scholarly characteristics, like our dear saiyan. It is a creature that appeared in the anime and video games with a very mysterious character trait, and its intelligence will be of great support to it during its fights to analyze the situation, which definitely makes it a very good ally and companion for Gohan. ü§ü\n\n6. PICCOLO & JUNGKO\n\nPiccolo is one of the main characters in the Dragon Ball series. He is the last child and reincarnation of Piccolo Daimao . However, starting from the first Dragon Ball Z saga, during the Raditz saga, he began to lose all villainous traits when he began training Goku's son Gohan during the Vegeta saga, leading to the two developing a strong bond between them, he became a permanent member of Team Dragon and ultimately one of Earth's greatest heroes.\n\nAlthough fans like to mock Goku by declaring Piccolo as Gohan's father since he was essentially the one who raised and trained him, there are many things about the Namekian that don't make sense regarding his appearance and other of these character traits. Besides that, many people enjoy seeing Piccolo get some screen time in the anime, whether he's a caregiver, a fighter, or just a loner training somewhere . üì∫\n\nIf Piccolo had the opportunity to choose a partner Pok√©mon, he would choose Jungko given her attitude to mesh well with his own. Jungko's species is known for caring about forest life and being serious when needed. With excellent agility and a habit of taking care of himself, Piccolo wouldn't hesitate to leave a place for Jungko in his team, that's obvious! üçÉ\n\n5. FREEZER & MEWTWO\n\nMewtwo is a Pok√©mon that has left its mark on all fans of the franchise. He even appeared as the main character in Pok√©mon the Movie: Mewtwo Strikes Back . Although Mewtwo has received a lot of spotlight in the Pok√©mon video games, in the anime, movies, and other media, it's a Pok√©mon from the Kanto region that shouldn't even exist due to its deadly powers. On the other hand, in the eyes of a villain like Frieza, Mewtwo would be a suitable companion for him to use for his army or as a right-hand man, given his incredible power and insane ability to analyze. üëÄ\n\nAdditionally, both Mewtwo and Frieza have a vendetta against humanity, in addition to the first Pok√©mon movie version of Mewtwo undergoing a profound change at the end. Each of these two characters have a strong aversion to humanity , or at least to what it has become. They both aspire to a perfect world, devoid of all flaws. This is why they agree on a lot of points. üí•\n\nDespite all this, Mewtwo would bring out the good side of Frieza because he is fundamentally good, despite all the destruction he has been able to carry out in the many media. Mewtwo has actually evolved alongside the likes of Ash. But if he was a random Mewtwo who never knew the good side of humanity, then he'll be just as cruel and menacing as Frieza. üëä\n\n4. CELL & GENESECT\n\nFor someone who thought he was the perfect being, getting defeated by a young Saiyan kid (Son Gohan) was not something Cell had considered in DBZ and would want to proudly display on his villain resume. Despite his crushing defeat in the Japanese anime, many argue that Cell was the best villain in Dragon Ball Z because he allowed Son Goku to sacrifice himself and used the Z-Fighters' attacks against themselves. üí®\n\nAnother creature that Cell would therefore logically not be afraid to have as a partner would be Genesect , given that it is also a man-made creature believed to be the most powerful Pok√©mon of all time. With Genesect's powerful cannon and agility, Cell can get more use out of it than with the Cell Juniors, that's obvious.\n\n3. AWESOME TURTLE & TORTANK\n\nWhether Master Roshi is relaxing in his home at Kam√© House or trying to stand out on a date with the ladies, many people have enjoyed their screen time with the Dragon Ball character so far , still zany but proving very powerful. Additionally, looking disheveled and old, Master Roshi still had tricks up his sleeve, as shown by his impressive combat prowess during the Tournament of Power arc in Dragon Ball Super. üèÜ\n\nHowever, if there is one good Pok√©mon that many could see accompanying Master Roshi, it would be Tortank . This Pok√©mon can hold its ground in battle with powerful water cannons and its explosive abilities that allow it to pierce through steel and concrete. In addition, Kam√© Sennin's school is called the turtle school. Coincidence? We don't believe! üê¢\n\nIf Master Roshi needed someone to defend his home while he was away, he could count on Tortank to do the job! üîê\n\n2. MAJIN BOO & ECTOPLASMA\n\nAlthough Majin Boo no longer has any evil intentions to kill innocent beings in the world of Dragon Ball, he still possesses Machiavellian and vicious traits, which would pair well with a specter or a small ghost, similar to the Pok√©mon Gengar . As shown in the movie Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Gods , Majin Boo had no problem irritating an opponent like Beerus. üí®\n\nIn the Pok√©mon world, Gengar has shown similar rude behavior towards humans and other Pok√©mon, as he always likes to play his pranks and jokes on others to satisfy his precious personal amusement. You should also know that Majin boo likes company, he has often been supported by Mr. Satan and always seeks his recognition. He would therefore not be unwilling to have a companion so that he no longer feels alone.\n\nMajin Boo also loves to laugh and be a playful character in the series, and having a prankster companion Pok√©mon such as Gengar would make his days a lot more fun! ü§£\n\n1. C-18 & GARDEVOIR\n\nAlthough Android 18 was first seen and characterized as a villain in the series, she later became a caring lover for Krillin . Whether on the battlefield or in a public place, she is always willing for her husband to come back when he needs help. The love and care she has for her family would fit really well with the Pok√©mon Gardevoir, which would help C-18 keep her family safe. üîê\n\nIn the Pok√©mon world, Gardevoir is a relatively powerful creature. It's also a strong opponent in the Pok√©mon league if you've played the different versions of Nintendo video games ! She can create mini black holes, warp entire dimensions and see into the future. The Gardevoir species is also known to be loyal to those who give them respect and will defend their masters to the end. üëä\n\nBONUS. SHENRON & RAYQUAZA\n\nFinally, we would like to end this article on Shenron, the legendary dragon and iconic character from Akira Toriyama's animated series. He is a key character in the series because he is summoned when the 7 crystal balls of planet Earth are reunited. After his appearance, the processor of the balls has the right to a wish, which the dragon will grant. üîÆ\n\nOn Nintendo's side, Rayquaza is a legendary dragon/flying type Pok√©mon present from the 3rd generation. It is one of the strongest Pok√©mon in the entire franchise, as it is capable of Mega Evolving without holding a Mega Gem and has one of the highest attack powers of any Pok√©mon. A Pok√©mon this powerful would be a perfect match for Shenron! üê≤\n\nWe also couldn't help but notice that Rayquaza looked a lot like Shenron in Dragon Ball, as both are green serpentine dragons. What better way to round out a legendary dragon's Pok√©mon team with another mystical dragon ? üêâ\n\nThe only difference is obviously that Rayquaza is not able to grant wishes, but he can still control the weather, which makes him extremely powerful and surely likely to win many Pok√©mon battles. So why not associate it with Shenron?\n\nPOKEMON OR DRAGON BALL?\n\nWe hope that this article will be of more interest to you, don't hesitate to ask us for others if you liked us to cover this exclusive Pok√©mon vs Dragon Ball category , where we compare and analyze the different events of each saga to make links! If you want to discover more crossovers between different Japanese manga and anime, don't hesitate to read our article on the subject: TOP 15 Crossovers between Dragon Ball Z and other Mangas .\n\nIn any case, apart from all the love we have for Pok√©mon in the Goku Shop team, we remain part of the Dragon Ball team to continue to support our favorite saiyans ! And you ? Which side do you choose? Needless to say, Goku would be a great Pok√©mon trainer who is difficult to beat. But would he compete with Sacha? Let us know in the comments!"
