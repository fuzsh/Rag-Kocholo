        "text": "Wikipedia This page uses content from Wikipedia. The original article was at Majin Buu. The list of authors can be seen in the page history. As with the Dragon Ball Wiki, the text of Wikipedia is available under the GNU Free Documentation License.\n\n\"Buu\" redirects here. For other uses, see Evil Buu, Super Buu and Kid Buu.\n\nMajin Buu (魔人ブウ Majin Buu) is a character in the anime and manga series Dragon Ball Z, based on the Dragon Ball manga by Akira Toriyama. He makes a reappearance in Dragon Ball GT by Toei Doga and appears briefly in Toriyama's self-parody manga Neko Majin Z. He is the final major villain to appear in the Dragon Ball Z series.\n\nLike most other characters, Majin Buu's name is part of a joke. When placed with his creator, Bibidi, and Bibidi's son, Babidi; it forms \"Bibbidi Bobbidi Buu\", the same phrase used in Disney's motion picture event, Cinderella,[1] which in turn was based on the story of the same name.\n\nPersonality[]\n\nAlthough he is one of the most powerful entities in Dragon Ball Z, Majin Buu is often playful and childish, revealing he destroys things for fun simply from old instructions from his master, stopping once told what he was doing was wrong. He literally struggles with the evil inside himself, with the evil winning and usurping near complete control, Majin Buu becoming far more dangerous as a result. Buu also possessed an enormous appetite for sweets, shown to far exceed even Goku's eating habits, as Buu was still hungry after he once turned a whole city of people into candy and ate them. He was extremely naive, as he was completely ignorant of Hercule's (inept) attempts to kill him, as well as the fact that Bibidi and Babidi were using him.\n\nThe Evil Buu was far more intelligent and mature then the original Majin Buu, showing a greater mastery of his abilities and proving more clever. Despite that, he retained some of the original Buu's traits. The most noticeable was his appetite, demonstrated by his going berserk in Hyperbolic Time Chamber at the thought of there being no sweets. Despite that, he was still somewhat gullible, since he was ignorant of the fact that Piccolo was stalling him when trying to reach the chamber, and he was tricked by Gotenks' Kamikaze Ghost's pretending to look at something on the ground.\n\nThe original personality, Kid Buu, was completely evil, and the only thing that seemed to drive him was a thirst for destruction. Kid Buu also seemed to be the least intelligent, barely possessing the ability to speak (though this may also stem from the fact that Kid Buu is also the most unstable of the Buu forms, as this same form also laughs maniacally most of the time).\n\nIn all cases, Buu seemed to enjoy fighting, though he didn't always take it seriously. Since both the Good Buu and Evil Buu liked the idea of a strong opponent, though the Good Buu seemed to lose interest in fighting when Hercule told him that killing was wrong. Kid Buu also seemed to enjoy his fight with Goku and Vegeta.\n\nBiography[]\n\nOrigin[]\n\nSpoiler warning!\n\nThis article contains plot details about an upcoming episode.\n\nKid Buu is over five million years old, created eons before the beginning of the story by the evil wizard Bibidi in an attempt for galactic domination. The resultant demon was extremely powerful, but because of its wild nature, it was uncontrollable even to Bibidi himself. In the anime, 12 Galaxies were destroyed by Kid Buu before he and Bibidi traveled to the Kai Planet, but in the manga, it was only 700 planets.\n\nPutting his plan into action, Bibidi and Kid Buu traveled to the Kai Planet, home of his sworn enemies, the Supreme Kai's. Kid Buu kills the Northern Supreme Kai and Western Supreme Kai; he manages to absorb the Southern Supreme Kai which transforms him into bulky version of himself: Ultra Buu.[2]\n\nUltra Buu attempted to kill Supreme Kai, but was halted by Grand Supreme Kai, who then proceeded to fight Ultra Buu. Ultra Buu retaliates and absorbs him. Rather than transform into an even deadlier monster, the absorption results in an obese, childlike Fat Majin Buu who can now speak and whose power and evilness have greatly decreased due to Grand Supreme Kai's good nature: Fat Majin Buu. Because of this, Bibidi was initially able to keep him under control.\n\nHowever, over the weeks, Majin Buu once again broke free of Bibidi's control, and Bibidi uses his magic to seal Majin Buu into a Magical Ball trapping the demon inside forever. Bibidi was killed by Supreme Kai soon thereafter.\n\nMajin Buu's resurface[]\n\nMain article: Majin Buu Saga Millions of years later, Majin Buu is once again unleashed thanks to a plan made by Bibidi's son, Babidi, who also seeks control of the universe. Despite attempts by Supreme Kai and Gohan, Buu is resurrected at full power.[3] But when Majin Buu seems more like a naughty child than a terrible villain, Dabura insults him repeatedly, and Majin Buu shows his power by quickly knocking out the villain.\n\nBabidi then commands Majin Buu to strike at Gohan and Supreme Kai next. Majin Buu quickly renders them harmless with one blow each. But just as Majin Buu moves in for the kill, Dabura intervenes and impales Majin Buu with a javelin, which does no harm. Majin Buu retaliates, turning Dabura into a cookie and devouring him.\n\nMajin Buu then challenges Majin Vegeta, who proved to be Buu's first real challenge. Majin Vegeta is shown to have the upper hand until Majin Buu turns serious and uses a piece of his own body to beat the Saiyan Prince. Trunks and Goten quickly intervene and kick Majin Buu into the distance. Majin Buu quickly recovers and returns to battle, as a last ditch effort Majin Vegeta performs a Final Explosion technique in order to completey obliterate Majin Buu, and succeeds, as only small pieces of Buu are left. However, the leftover pieces combine to reform the Majin, who reappears just as Piccolo escapes the battlefield, where he was examining the damage left by Vegeta.\n\nLater, Majin Buu and Babidi are confronted by Goku, who uses his Super Saiyan 3 technique to stall Majin Buu long enough for Trunks to retrieve the Dragon Radar from Capsule Corp. After an even fight (in which Majin Buu learns the Kamehameha), Goku then bids farewell to Majin Buu and a furious Babidi, after informing Majin Buu that in two days, he will be presented with an even greater challenge, much to Majin Buu's delight. Babidi, enraged, insults Majin Buu and orders him to find Goku, but unfortunately, Majin Buu proves to have had enough of Babidi, and shows his mutiny by decapitating him with a punch and blasting his body into smithereens.\n\nExcited to meet his new challenge, and free of Babidi, Majin Buu however, starts destroying cities and killing millions of humans faster than ever. Meanwhile in Kami's Lookout, Goten and Trunks finally perfected the fusion dance and became a powerful warrior named Gotenks. Gotenks challenges Majin Buu, and Majin Buu topples Gotenks with ease. Severely injured, Gotenks then retreats back to Kami's Lookout.\n\nLater on, Majin Buu finds a nice piece of land where he decides to build a small house. After returning from a killing spree, Majin Buu finds the world champion, Hercule, in his home, who claims to admire Majin Buu, and brings some gifts (All of which were meant to destroy Majin Buu). But Majin Buu likes them, and takes a liking to Hercule, naming him his new playfriend and servant.\n\nLater on, after Majin Buu returns from another killing spree with a hurt puppy, Hercule explains that the puppy didn't run away because he was injured. Majin Buu heals the puppy, but the puppy takes a liking to Majin Buu and refuses to stop following him. Hercule tells Majin Buu that the puppy likes him, which makes Majin Buu happy. Hercule then manages to get Majin Buu to reveal that he was only killing people because of orders from Bibidi and Babidi. Informed that what he was doing was wrong, Majin Buu agrees not to kill anymore, and settles down with Hercule and the puppy.\n\nAt that moment, two thugs make their appearance and shoot Bee. Majin Buu is shocked by this, and steam begins to blow out of the holes in his head. Hercule manages to defeat the thugs though, and Majin Buu is able to heal Bee, and their peaceful life continues.\n\nBut the thugs don't give up there, and shoot Hercule right in front of Majin Buu's eyes. Although Majin Buu is able to heal Hercule in time, he finds himself torn between his desire for revenge and his promise. The frustration is so intense that Majin Buu loses control and involuntarily excludes all the evil inside him in the form of a grey, skinny Majin Buu: Evil Buu. The good Majin Buu, now known as Fat Majin Buu, watches in horror as Evil Buu mercilessly kills one of the two thugs.\n\nFat Majin Buu engages Evil Buu in combat, but considering the majority of his power went to Evil Buu, Fat Majin Buu is outmatched. In a last ditch effort to destroy Evil 1, Fat Majin Buu fires a tentacle beam at him to turn him into an edible form. Unfortunately, Evil Buu simply blows it back, and Fat Majin Buu is then transformed into a piece of chocolate, which is devoured by Evil Buu. With this new power, Evil Buu undergoes a horrible transformation, which ends with a radically changed Majin Buu. The new Majin Buu that appears is a tall, pink humanoid with no top, and white trousers: Super Buu.\n\nSuper Buu destroys the remaining thug and then sees Hercule. He attempts to kill him, but his good side's (Fat Majin Buu) affection for Hercule doesn't let Super Buu do so. Super Buu merely speaks Hercule's name, and sensing some new power levels, flies off towards Kami's Lookout.\n\nSuper Buu[]\n\nMain article: Fusion Saga\n\nArriving at Kami's Lookout, Super Buu finds the leftover warriors, and remembers Piccolo from before. He then demands to be presented with the promised fighter, despite being a day early. Piccolo begs Super Buu to give them another day, and to go back to killing the leftover people on Earth. But Super Buu displays his ruthlessness, as well as his impatience by using a genocide attack that kills the remaining population except for Hercule, Tien, Chiaotzu, and those on the lookout. Piccolo then reduces the time to an hour, and convinces Super Buu to accept by using Videl, Hercule's daughter, as the one making the request. Super Buu reluctantly agrees, and sits impatiently by a giant hourglass. During this time, Chi-Chi slaps Super Buu, who then turns her into an egg and crushes her.\n\nHowever, after thirty minutes, Super Buu loses his patience and demands to be taken to the fighter. He is then led the long way to the Hyperbolic Time Chamber by Piccolo, where he finds Goten and Trunks, who fuse into Super Saiyan Gotenks via the Fusion dance. However, Super Buu proves to be too much for Gotenks, and Piccolo destroys the entrance to the Time Chamber, trapping himself, Super Buu and Gotenks inside forever.\n\nBut upon hearing that he will never be able to eat candy again, Super Buu releases all his anger in a mighty scream, which rips a hole through the two dimensions. Escaping back to the lookout, Super Buu wastes no time and turns everyone into chocolate, except Dende, who was thrown off by Mr. Popo in time. Later on, Super Buu is confronted by Piccolo and Super Saiyan 3 Gotenks, who also escaped from the Time Chamber. Super Buu is evenly matched with Gotenks at this stage, but Gotenks fails to finish Super Buu before the fusion wears off and he turns back into Goten and Trunks. Super Buu then moves in for the kill when he is interrupted thanks to the timely intervention of Gohan, who has unlocked his latent powers with Supreme Kai and Elder Kai and is ready to battle Super Buu. Super Buu and Gohan fight, with the tables heavily in favor of Gohan, who is too much for Super Buu to handle. But before Gohan can deliver the finishing blow, Super Buu flees for his life by self destructing, and then waits in hiding for one hour.\n\nAn hour later, Super Buu is confronted by Gohan, Goten, Trunks, Piccolo, Hercule, Dende, and Bee. Super Buu uses taunting language to provoke Goten and Trunks into fusing into Gotenks, which they do. Seeing his chance, Super Buu wastes no time and uses his absorption technique to absorb Gotenks and Piccolo, and transforms into a stronger and more intelligent version of himself wearing Gotenks' fusion vest.\n\nSuper Buu then resumes the battle against Gohan, and it becomes apparent that Super Buu's transformation has given him the upper hand as he fiercely battles Gohan. As Super Buu moves to finish off Gohan, Gohan is healed by Dende. Noticing this, Super Buu tries to kill Dende along with Hercule but is stopped by the intervention of Tien, who is also beaten unconscious. Super Buu then attempts to destroy Earth, but is stopped again by a Destructo Disk fired from behind him by the revived Goku, thanks to Elder Kai giving his life.\n\nGoku then reveals his plan of a Potara Earring Fusion with Gohan, and throws an earring to him. Unfortunately, Gohan misses, and Goku is forced to hold off Super Buu as a Super Saiyan 3. But just as Gohan finds the earring, the Gotenks fusion inside Super Buu wears off, and he reverts to a much weaker Piccolo-clothed version of himself.\n\nHowever, Super Buu plays a dirty trick and uses his severed tentacle from Goku's Destructo Disk to absorb Gohan from behind, transforming into the insanely powerful version of himself with Gohan's shirt. But just before Super Buu can kill Goku, Goku senses Vegeta's ki from afar, and both he and Super Buu go to investigate.\n\nAt first, Super Buu battles both Goku and Vegeta, since Vegeta's pride gets in the way of him fusing with Goku. But after some emotional blackmail, Vegeta finally accepts, and the two Saiyans fuse to create Super Buu's next opponent: Vegito, who easily overwhelms Super Buu until he allows himself to be absorbed in the hope of rescuing his friends.\n\nThe innards of Super Buu[]\n\nInside Super Buu, Vegito, who used an energy barrier to shield himself from being completely absorbed, somehow defuses back to Goku and Vegeta, and the two Saiyans then explore Super Buu's body in order to complete their goal: that of finding the absorbed bodies of Goten, Trunks, Gohan and Piccolo. Eventually, after many escapades with Super Buu's digestive juices, Goku and Vegeta finally manage to make it to Super Buu's brain thanks to directions given to them by a pack of friendly worms.\n\nInside Super Buu's brain, the Saiyans find what they were looking for and immediately proceed to rip the pods containing their friends from Super Buu's brain. However, back on the outside, Super Buu realizes that he is somehow reverting back to his normal Super Buu state. Sensing something is wrong, Super Buu uses his own molding of himself to create a form of a miniature Super Buu inside his own brain.\n\nMeanwhile, Goku and Vegeta find another pod containing Fat Majin Buu. Reading Fat Majin Buu's mind, Goku is able to learn of the events that occurred between Hercule, Fat Majin Buu, Bee and Evil Buu. Then, the thought form appears and engages the Saiyans in combat, they find themselves no match for the invincible thought form of Super Buu.\n\nJust before the thought form can kill Goku, Vegeta blackmails him into stopping by threatening to remove the pod containing Fat Majin Buu. The thought form begs him not to, claiming that he would no longer be himself without Fat Majin Buu. Vegeta pulls the Fat Majin Buu pod off anyway, and the thought form disintegrates while Super Buu undergoes one last transformation.\n\nGoku and Vegeta then grab the pods with Trunks, Piccolo, Gohan and Goten and eventually manage to escape from Super Buu's body to witness Super Buu's transformation, unaware that they have forgotten the Fat Majin Buu pod. Removing the Fat Majin Buu pod has cleansed Super Buu of everyone inside him, including Southern and Grand Supreme Kai's. Thus, Super Buu reverts to his original form, which seems to be a miniature version of the original Super Buu. Little did Goku and Vegeta know that this form of Super Buu was his most dangerous form-Kid Buu.\n\nKid Buu[]\n\nMain article: Kid Buu Saga After he comes to his senses, Kid Buu attempts to destroy the Earth with a small blast, but it is deflected by Vegeta. Kid Buu then creates a massive energy ball and flings it toward the Earth. Goku and Vegeta realize that they can't stop it and make an attempt to escape with Hercule, Bee, Dende, Gohan, Goten, Piccolo, and Trunks. However, the two are only able to grab Hercule, Bee, and Dende before Kibito Kai appears, grabs onto Goku and Vegeta, and teleports away with Instant Transmission. Gohan, Goten, Piccolo, and Trunks are left as the Earth and everyone else on it is completely destroyed.\n\nRegenerating after the explosion, Kid Buu goes off in search of Goku and Vegeta, teleporting to many planets as he goes and destroying them upon sensing the Saiyans' absence. Eventually, Kid Buu manages to sense the increasing combat powers of Goku and Vegeta, and teleports off to the Kai Planet for his desired rematch. Upon arriving, Kid Buu does battle with Super Saiyan 2 Goku, quickly gaining the upper hand, causing Goku to go Super Saiyan 3 and fight evenly with him. Kid Buu, having the advantage of perpetual strength,[4] wins over the battered Goku, who is quickly losing power from his Super Saiyan 3 transformation. Vegeta engages Kid Buu in an attempt to buy some time, but is quickly defeated as well. Hercule then steps in and attempts to fight Kid Buu, but is severely outmatched.\n\nKid Buu moves in to kill Hercule, but finds himself unable to do so due to having the memories of Fat Majin Buu. His frustration ultimately leads him to spit out a small stone which explodes into an unconscious Fat Majin Buu. Now with nothing to stop him, Kid Buu resumes the playfight with the enraged Hercule, and moves to kill him when Fat Majin Buu steps in. Fat Majin Buu angrily tells Kid Buu to leave Hercule alone and that his battle is with him. Fat Majin Buu and Kid Buu then engage one another in combat. The battle seems to be even at first, but Kid Buu ultimately dominates Fat Majin Buu, who refuses to give up.\n\nMeanwhile, Goku and Vegeta hatch a plan to have Dende and the Supreme Kai's use the Namekian Dragon Balls to restore the Earth and revive all the good people who were killed since the World Martial Arts Tournament. Goku then prepares to create a Spirit Bomb, while Vegeta uses King Kai's telepathy to ask for the Earthlings' help, to which only their friends and family respond.\n\nFat Majin Buu and Kid Buu continue their battle, until Fat Majin Buu is beaten so badly that he cannot fight any longer. Hercule then steps in to stop Kid Buu, and Vegeta once again battles Kid Buu to buy some time. Ultimately, Hercule manages to convince the people of Earth to give up their energy, and the Spirit Bomb reaches completion. Unfortunately, Kid Buu holds the battered Vegeta 'hostage', keeping him in the Spirit Bomb's path as well, therefore stopping Goku from throwing the attack. However, Fat Majin Buu wakes up, and smashes himself headfirst into Kid Buu, knocking him off Vegeta for Hercule to carry off to safety.\n\nNow with an obstacle-free path, Goku takes his chance and throws the Spirit Bomb straight at Kid Buu, but Kid Buu is able to stop it and slowly pushes it back towards the exhausted Goku. Dende then uses the third wish with the Namekian Dragon to have all of Goku's strength be restored. Goku then turns Super Saiyan and overpowers Kid Buu with the Spirit Bomb, and the evil half of Majin Buu is vanquished forever.\n\nWith Kid Buu gone, the healed Vegeta angrily prepares to finish off the unconscious Fat Majin Buu, not wanting to risk the creation of another Evil Buu through Fat Majin Buu's anger. But Goku believes that Fat Majin Buu has redeemed himself and deserves to live the life of peace that he craved, and asks Dende to heal Fat Majin Buu. Kibito Kai then uses his power to teleport Goku, Vegeta, Dende, Hercule, Fat Majin Buu, and Bee back to Earth, where they are given a warm welcome by their friends and family.\n\nIn order to settle things for good with Fat Majin Buu, Goku wishes for Shenron to erase all the Earthlings' memories of the Majin Buu. Hercule also gives Fat Majin Buu strict orders to refrain from getting angry, no matter what.\n\nThe new Majin Buu[]\n\nTen years later, now known as \"Mr.\" rather than \"Majin\" Buu, Majin Buu enters the World Martial Arts Tournament in order to continue his cheating with Hercule (he throws the final against Hercule). But he learns from Goku that a certain competitor, a dark-skinned boy named Uub is actually the human reincarnation of Kid Buu. Fat Majin Buu witnesses the fight between Goku and Uub, with Uub's power slowly increasing as the battle goes on. Eventually, Goku sees that Uub needs a trainer to teach him how to fly and to use his ki properly. Goku then bids farewell to all his friends, and departs with Uub to his poor village to train him.\n\nA number of years later, in Dragon Ball GT, Majin Buu is once again forced to spring into action when the Tuffle parasite, Baby, invades Earth in search of the Saiyans. Majin Buu uses his magical abilities to absorb Hercule and Pan (Goku's granddaughter) to protect them from Baby's mind control eggs. Infiltrating the line of hypnotized people who are preparing to depart Earth for the Planet Tuffle, Majin Buu is forced to intervene when Pan is confronted by her enslaved parents, Gohan and Videl. However, Uub returns at the last minute and knocks Gohan and Videl out while Majin Buu takes Pan and Hercule to safety.\n\nBut seeing Uub struggle against Baby Vegeta, Majin Buu bids farewell to Hercule and Pan, and flies off for the battlefield, where he saves Uub at the last minute by absorbing Baby's Revenge Death Ball and exploding into smithereens.\n\nHowever, still alive, Majin Buu shares a warm moment with the battered Uub, in which he reveals to him that they are the two halves of the original Kid Buu, and that it's time for them to unite once again. Liquifying himself, Majin Buu fuses with Uub and they permanently form a stronger version of Uub.\n\nMajin Buu is not seen again afterwards, except for flashbacks and parts in which he telepathically communicates with Uub, who is in control of the 'Majuub' persona.\n\nForms and transformations[]\n\nMajin Buu has the most transformations of any character in Dragon Ball. Due to his vast amount of forms each carries its own fan-given nickname, though the character remains the same. Regardless of appearance, Buu remains the same. While not in the original manga or anime, the fourth Daizenshuu and various video games and merchandise assign different titles to help fans distinguish between the changes Majin Buu undergoes throughout the series.\n\nThe following are the forms of Majin Buu in the order they are first seen:\n\nFat Buu[]\n\nThe first time viewers are introduced to Majin Buu he is in this corpulent form, created through the absorption of Grand Supreme Kai. Rarely do his eyes ever open, and his body is adorned with yellow Boots/gloves, a purple cape, a black vest, and white pants. He acts in a childish manner and is the most naive of all the forms, as he is shown to have little or no knowledge of anything around him, even by his own powers. Because he retains an element of evil, Majin Buu is still a danger, because he has almost no sense of an independent mind, so he is easily susceptible to doing whatever someone tells him to do. When Majin Buu struggles with keeping his promise with Hercule not to kill and a desire for revenge with those who wronged him, the internal conflict causes a second Majin Buu to emerge, taking most of Majin Buu's power with himself. That's how the weakest form of Majin Buu is born, known as \"Mr. Buu\". Deprived of all evil, this Majin Buu is only slightly stronger than a Super Saiyan 2 but is far more resilient. [citation needed]\n\nEvil Buu[]\n\nMain article: Evil Buu\n\nAfter Majin Buu dispelled the evil from his body, the vapor gained this tall, emaciated form. This Evil Buu represents the dark side of Fat Buu and has the bulk of the original Majin Buu's power, since Majin Buu was originally created through pure evil. This also explains why his reaction to the shooting of Hercule was so despicable, and even appalled the Fat Majin Buu. He is a polar opposite of the \"good\" Majin Buu in all aspects apart from apparel, (except for him having a dark blue cape where Fat Buu has a purple cape), including the color of his flesh (a drab grey), his incredibly thin body, and gravelly manner of speech. The two Majin Buus fight, with the evil incarnation gaining the upper hand and consuming \"Good Majin Buu\" after reflecting an attack meant to turn him into chocolate. By consuming the Good Majin Buu, the Evil Buu transformed into Super Buu.\n\nSuper Buu[]\n\nMain article: Super Buu\n\nIn this form Super Buu enjoys an immense increase in power, as the evil within him has almost completely suppressed the good, and he can be considered a fusion character, for the separate Majin Buus became two distinct entities. Both his height and musculature increase, with his eyes turning full black, save for the irises which are in turn red and white (white initially, then permanently red after Gotenks punches him). The gloves previous Majin Buus once wore are eliminated and replaced with black armbands, complimented by a new set of Boots that are black and gripped. He is easily irritated and impatient, entertaining himself by constantly cracking his neck and occasionally screeching in an inhuman manner, with an insatiable desire to prove himself as the strongest fighter in existence. He first battles Gotenks, who is on even terms with him at Super Saiyan 3 and even a little stronger. Gotenks eventually defuses, but before Super Buu can press his advantage he is attacked by Gohan. Overwhelmed, Super Buu successfully schemes to absorb the power of Gotenks and steal the mind of Piccolo.\n\nSuper Buu Piccolo/Gotenks[]\n\nIn addition to his strength increase from Gotenks, Super Buu's intelligence skyrockets and he now speaks with Piccolo's eloquence. He takes on more human facial features, though his head tentacle is far longer than before, mimicking the exaggerated hair acquired at Super Saiyan 3. His short, stubby fingers become long, full-sized fingers. Because Gotenks is his main power source, Super Buu is dressed in the black and yellow vest unique to the Fusion Dance. Super Buu is able to adapt and customize his victims' attacks and techniques, and has the battle well in hand until the fusion between Goten and Trunks wears off. In the manga and anime this is the first stage at which Buu calls himself \"Super Buu\".\n\nMajin Buu Piccolo/Goten/Trunks[]\n\nA sub-version of his previous form, Super Buu loses much in the way of power while retaining intelligence and the power of 2 super saiyans, now wearing Piccolo's cape (as the Namekian is now his primary absorption).Stronger than he was in his original \"Super\" form ( but much weaker than with Gotenks ), he became again inferior to Ultimate Gohan. To slip out of this situation, Super Buu uses a piece of tentacle that had been previously severed to absorb Gohan, adding another casualty to his dietary menu.\n\nSuper Buu Gohan/Piccolo/Goten/Trunks[]\n\nHis power shoots to an unprecedented level, with his body going through yet more physical changes. He now wears Gohan's familiar orange gi; appearing more human as the tentacle atop his head increases in size and width. Super Buu is more confident and boastful than ever before, belittling attempts at stopping him by Goku and the newly arrived Vegeta until they fuse into Vegito via the Potara earrings. Even by Super Buu's standards Vegito's power was astonishing, and an attempt at absorbing him only led to the Saiyans freeing Super Buu's previous victims, removing nearly all stolen mental/physical attributes and influences.\n\nUltra Buu[]\n\nSeen briefly in a few panels of the manga and an anime flashback, the original Kid Buu absorbs the Southern Supreme Kai, creating an incredibly muscular version of the creature. But after a second absorption of the plump and good-natured Grand Supreme Kai, Ultra Buu gains the deceptively harmless and child-like form first seen in the series. As no name is given for this short-lived Ultra Buu, it has been coined \"Majin Buu South Supreme Kai Absorbed\", \"Mega Buu\", \"Buff Buu\", \"Huge Buu\" and sometimes \"Super Kid Buu\" by fans.\n\nKid Buu[]\n\nMain article: Kid Buu\n\nThe original demon created by Bibidi.[5] He is the smallest of Majin Buu's forms. He is not only pure evil, but his rationality and sanity are practically non-existent, making him extremely dangerous to be around because of his destructively unpredictable nature. When Kid Buu finds out he cannot harm Hercule, Kid Buu clutches his head in agony before spitting out his last remnant of good, (Fat/Good Majin Buu), thus becoming what he originally was, pure evil. Reflecting his lack of sanity, Kid Buu's speech is very undeveloped, being able to speak only in chirps and gibberish (aside from exclaiming a few phrases like \"You've had it!\" on the Kai Planet) in the original Japanese version, though the English dub gives him a slightly wider vocabulary. He learns new techniques just by watching them, and destroys Earth and numerous other planets out of childish glee. He is able to fight on par with Goku even while Goku is at Super Saiyan 3, although in the anime, Goku states he held back power in order for Vegeta to fight as well. Kid Buu has many other feats of strength, such as being able to hold off a Spirit Bomb with energy from all of Earth's inhabitants powering it (until Goku got his energy restored and transformed into a Super Saiyan), his ability to destroy planet after planet with virtually no loss of energy, and his reputation for destroying entire galaxies with ease.\n\nUnlike his other forms, Kid Buu has no restraints on his power. While the variations of Super Buu were content with simply wiping out humanity and whatever else stood in his way, Kid Buu was more than willing to destroy the universe as well as the afterlife for fun, even gleefully obliterating himself and regenerating over and over as well.\n\nBuu's reincarnate[]\n\nMain article: Uub\n\nUub is the pure good, reincarnated version of Kid Buu.[6] Right when Goku defeated Kid Buu with his Super Spirit Bomb, he told Kid Buu that he hoped that he would come back someday as a good person, so that they could fight again. King Yemma overheard Goku's desire and had Kid Buu reincarnated into a human form named Uub. Goku fights him at the World Martial Arts Tournament ten years later. Goku then takes him away to train with him so that Goku would have an apprentice who could protect the Earth.\n\nMajuub[]\n\nMajuub is Funimation's name for the result of a fusion between the innocent Majin Buu and Uub in Dragon Ball GT, creating a much stronger and more muscular Uub wearing Majin Buu's black and yellow vest. Majuub retains many of Majin Buu's abilities, including the power to turn organic beings into chocolate. He appears several times throughout the series to help ward off the most powerful of foes: Baby, Super 17, and Syn Shenron. The name \"Majuub\" is not used in the original version of the anime or the Blue Water dub. Majuub is much like a human-form of Super Buu. (Note: \"Uub\" is \"Buu\" backwards)\n\nWhat-ifs[]\n\nIn the video game Dragon Ball Z: Budokai 2, Super Buu's unique ability to absorb and take on the characteristics of others was portrayed in exclusive absorptions never seen in the anime nor manga:\n\nSuper Buu (absorbed Frieza)[]\n\nSuper Buu gains Frieza's trademark patches of color on both his shoulders and forehead, inheriting the villain's hate for the Saiyans, speech and intelligence, and the attacks Death Beam and Death Ball. Seen as both a byproduct of the Absorption skill and in Dragon World story mode.\n\nSuper Buu (absorbed Cell)[]\n\nSuper Buu's body becomes speckled and lines of color form below his eyes, gaining Cell's speech patterns and intelligence as well as some of his attacks: Energy Field and the Spirit Bomb. Seen as both a byproduct of the Absorption skill and in the story mode.\n\nSuper Buu (absorbed Vegeta)[]\n\nAs with the above, Super Buu takes on Vegeta's characteristics and features, gaining a blue sleeveless shirt and the special techniques Galick Gun and Final Flash and Big Bang Attack.\n\nlink title\n\nSuper Buu (absorbed Yamcha and Tien)[]\n\nSuper Buu absorbs both Yamcha and Tien, taking attributes from both with a green top and scars, he is incredibly disappointed and even seems less confident in himself after the absorption, with his attack power decreasing greatly. However, he gains access to wider variety of attacks: Tien's Dodon Ray and Volleyball Fist and Yamcha's Wolf Fang Fist and Spirit Ball. A byproduct of the Absorption skill.\n\nSpecial abilities[]\n\nAbsorption[]\n\nMain article: Absorption\n\nMajin Buu fully engulfs and takes an opponent into his body to cause an increase in physical or mental prowess. Majin Buu usually has a severed body part liquify, or he has a piece of skin fall off of his body. The goo will then sneak up behind the person, and strech itself to be large enough to accomadate the target. The goo will then leap onto the person. The goo will try to smother as much of the target as it can on the first strike to make the capture easier. If Majin Buu is lucky, the goo will completely cover the target on the first leap. Once the goo is on the person, it will quickly cover up any part of the person that wasn't covered during when it first leaped. Once the target is completely covered, the goo will squeeze and solidify, trapping the person. It is seemingly impossible to escape the goo, no matter what the circumstances (such as Piccolo, who the goo took a long time to cover due to his armor).Then and the goo will then launch up into the air with the person inside of it. The goo will then fly straight into Majin Buu and cover him. During the transformation, Majin Buu will become liquid himself, meaning that he is basically takes over the the goo and has surrounded the person with his own liquified body. He then begins to meld back into solid form, making sure the person is in the center of the goo. The person is shrunken and is put inside Majin Buu's body in a pod. The transformation is long and usually accompanied by loud moans and groans, most prominently heard when Super Buu absorbs Gotenks and Piccolo. Unlike Cell, who took in life essence only through his tail, Majin Buu can perform this technique with any part of his body, even a severed limb, or he can simply liquify his whole body and cover the victim with himself. When absorbing another being, Majin Buu always takes qualities of their outward appearance as well. He also gains knowledge of their attacks, like Piccolo's Special Beam Cannon, Gotenks' Galactic Donut and Super Ghost Kamikaze Attack, and Gohan's Kamehameha. He also apparently possesses the ability to use attacks after seeing it done once, as he does so with the Kamehameha, as well as the Instant Transmission when in Kid Buu form.\n\nBody Manipulation and Regeneration[]\n\nMajin Buu has full control over every aspect of his physical make-up, able to stretch, shape-shift, liquefy, and otherwise manipulate his malleable body; useful as both an attack and defense and as a tool in absorption. He can also fully regenerate from the smallest of fragments, even vapor and can withstand explosions strong enough to destroy several planets, however he was unable to regenerate from Goku's Spirit Bomb since it destroyed every atom of Buu. His unrivaled regeneration plus his endless resilience and stamina granted him near-immortality. However, it is shown during the fight between Vegito and Super Buu that even his regeneration has its limits; after repeatedly being blow to bits and pounded into oblivion, Buu had to exert more and more effort to restore himself, at one point failing completely for a moment and leaving a gaping hole in his stomach.\n\nWrap Attack[]\n\nDue to Super Buu's ability to stretch very far, Super Buu can often detain a person by stretching and wrapping his body around them. He can do this with any part of his body, but most often he will usually do this by stretching the area from his chest to his feet around the target very quickly, then constricting before the person can react. Super Buu can also regenerate his body around a person in order for a suprise attack. If the target is particularly strong, Super Buu can stretch and wrap every inch of his body around the target. Super Buu can use this attack to his advantage in various ways.\n\nHe will usually just keep the target wrapped up in his body and squeeze the target, hurting them. He will only let go if the person is strong enough to break free (which no one could do but Vegito, due to Super Buu's very strong constriction.) If the target is not strong enough, they are at the mercy of Super Buu, and Super Buu will keep them wrapped up to squeeze until the target is dead or he decides to let go himself. Super Buu can also use this attack for other advantages, such as flying at high speeds with Gotenks wrapped up in his torso, then suddenly stopping and and releasing Gotenks, sending him flying into the ground.\n\nSkin Attack[]\n\nMajin Buu will grab his belly, and he will yank off a piece of it. He will then stretch the skin and make it long. Majin Buu will throw the skin at the target, and the skin will suddenly come alive and surround the target. The skin will then constrict the target. this attack is powerful enough to hold the strongest of enemies. It is devestating against regular humans, as they will be crushed to death in the coils of the skin within a matter of seconds. Even a powered up Majin Vegeta could not escape from it. The skin will continue to crush the target until someone pulls it off or the victim is strong enough to escape. Only Evil Buu was able to escape it.\n\nBelly Attack[]\n\nThis move is only performed by fat Majin Buu. Majin Buu can perform this attack if the person kicks him in the stomach. The person will be unable to take their foot out, and will slowly start to be sucked inward. Majin Buu will expand his belly so the person can fit inside, and then will continue to suck them inside of his belly. The person is being violently squeezed as this happens, violently enough that loud rubbery noises are heard. The person is sucked in very slowly, until they are completely engulfed. Even then, Majin Buu will continue to engulf the person, completely closing off the opening in his stomach. This was used in his battle against Super Saiyan 3 Goku.\n\nBuu Ball[]\n\nUsed in the battle against Gotenks and later on when battling Super Saiyan 3 Goku on the Kai Planet, Super Buu contorts his body vertically into a ball before launching himself at his opponent at great speed.\n\nPlanet Burst[]\n\nMain article: Planet Burst\n\nA massive ki ball created by Kid Buu by collecting energy in his right palm, enough to destroy a planet the size of Earth in a single shot. Used to not only destroy Earth but many other planets as Buu seeks out the place where Goku and Vegeta were hiding. This technique is called Vanishing Ball in the Budokai series of video games. It was named in the Budokai Tenkaichi series.\n\nChocolate Beam[]\n\nMain article: Chocolate Beam Majin Buu's unique ability to change objects and living beings around him into inanimate objects such as sweets and milk. Though he usually turns them into foods, Majin Buu has transformed a small population into clay for his house on one occasion during the Majin Buu Saga, and Super Buu once transformed a rock into a toilet. Vegito is the only entity that is shown to able to retain his will or move after being hit by the attack, fighting Super Buu as \"the world's strongest coffee candy\". Called Chocolate Beam in the Budokai Tenkaichi series.\n\nSpecial Human Genocide Attack[]\n\nKnown as Human Extinction Attack in the dub, Super Buu creates a vast amount of energy from his left palm that disperses to seek out and kill all human beings. Only those with a high-enough level to evade their path escaped from death, with Hercule spared due to the friendly Majin Buu's influence.\n\nHealing[]\n\nMain article: Healing Majin Buu can completely heal another being if he so chooses (proboly from the power of the Kias), even if they are blind or near death. So long as the recipient is still alive, Majin Buu can bring them back to health. He is unable to revive the dead, however.[7]\n\nKoukyuu Gata Kikou Ha[]\n\nMajin Buu puts his arms forth and launches a gigantic ball. Majin Buu had nearly killed Gohan with this technique. Energy Blast Wave, so this is basically Majin Buu's spin on the standard energy blast.\n\nChasing Destructo Disk (Continuous Kienzan)[]\n\nMain article: Chasing Destructo Disk Buu launches a great number of energy disks that slice through any inferior object or projectile, used by Super Buu w/Gohan. While not named in any English source, the English dub name for the Destructo Disk.\n\nZenshin kara no Shyougeki Ha[]\n\nMajin Buu rapidly powers up, creating a strong pink aura that grows exponentially in size and eventually explodes, causing massive damage. While not given in the manga or anime, the attack is named in the seventh daizenshuu. The technique is listed in the Budokai and Tenkaichi series of video games as Angry Explosion. Only Super Buu has also used this move, however.\n\nInstant Transmission[]\n\nMain article: Instant Transmission The user places their index and middle finger on their forehead, sensing a location that they teleport to.Buu learned this technique by watching Goku perform it.\n\nDimension Scream[]\n\nBuu lets out all of his energy in high pitched scream, ripping dimensions. It is said to possess enough power to destroy the whole universe. Used as a last resort against Vegito.\n\nAppearances in other media[]\n\nVideo games[]\n\nBuu has appeared in the following Dragon Ball related video games:\n\nDragon Ball Z: Budokai 2. Fat Buu, Super Buu and Kid Buu are playable\n\nDragon Ball Z: Budokai 3. Fat Buu, Super Buu and Kid Buu are playable\n\nDragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi.

Kid Buu is playable and Fat Buu is a support character\n\nDragon Ball Z: Shin Budokai. Fat Buu is a playable character\n\nDragon Ball Z: Shin Budokai - Another Road. Fat Buu, Super Buu (Base, Gotenks Absorbed and Gohan Absorbed) and Kid Buu are playable\n\nNeko Majin Z[]\n\nFat Buu has a cameo appearance in Neko Majin Z, a short series of one-shot manga chapters by Akira Toriyama. Neko Majin's friend finds Buu just wandering around after mistaking him for Neko Majin. Buu is surprised that Neko Majin's friend doesn't know who he is and breaks the fourth wall by mentioning that he's from the Dragon Ball manga. Buu displays his strength while Neko Majin's friend remains unsurprised and responds by saying that Neko Majin does stuff like that all the time (he also mentions how Neko Majin looks and acts similar to Buu). Buu leaves and tells Neko Majin's friend to call him to fight Neko Majin when he comes around. Later, Neko Majin's rival had stolen the source of his power, so Neko Majin's friend called Buu and told him that Neko Majin's rival was Neko Majin. Buu easily beats him and leaves very unfulfilled.\n\nSaga arcs[]\n\nGreat Saiyaman Saga\n\nWorld Tournament Saga\n\nBabidi Saga\n\nMajin Buu Saga\n\nFusion Saga\n\nKid Buu Saga\n\nVoice actors[]\n\nJapanese Dub: Kozo Shioya\n\nOcean Dub: Scott McNeil (Mr. Buu), Brian Dobson (Evil Buu and Super Buu), and Ward Perry (Kid Buu)\n\nFunimation Dub: Josh Martin (Mr. Buu and Kid Buu) and Justin Cook (Evil Buu and Super Buu)\n\nLatin American Dub: Mario Sauret\n\nTrivia[]\n\nBabidi wanted Goku to destroy Kid Buu as revenge for his own death. However, the original Majin Buu was also fighting Kid Buu and he survived the battle. Babidi didn't seem to notice, as an uncut-exclusive scene shows Goku about to destroy Kid Buu, and Babidi is in Hell saying \"This must be what joy feels like!\"\n\nSuper Buu after absorbing Gohan is the most powerful Dragon Ball Z villain.\n\nMajin Buu seems to be the only one eaten by one of Buu's various forms and survive as if he was absorbed. This might be because it was Evil Buu — a physical manifestation of Buu's evil — who consumed him.\n\nOver the course of the Fusion Sagas, until Majin Buu is seen inside Super Buu's head, the characters act as though Super Buu is the very same Majin Buu transformed (Though Piccolo and Dende seem to realize that Super Buu was not the same creature as Majin Buu due to having witnessed the fateful battle between Majin Buu and Evil Buu from the Lookout).\n\nStrangely enough, in the games, Evil Buu, Super Buu, and Kid Buu are their own separate characters, and are not transformations of each other. Though Super Buu does transform into his stronger forms after absorbing Gotenks and Gohan.\n\nEvil Buu's voice is high-pitched in Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi. This is fixed later on.\n\nEither Super Buu or Kid Buu kills Captain Ginyu the frog (by using Human Extinction Attack or else by blowing up the earth).\n\nBuu's blood isn't seen often, as he is rubbery and can be blown to bits and survive. However, there is a scene when Super Buu is losing to Vegito so he is \"forced\" to tear holes between all the dimensions, and clenches his fist so hard it begins to bleed. His blood is purple.\n\nFat Majin Buu's appearance is similar to Android 19.\n\nIt would appear that Buu has an aptitude for power mimicry. He was shown to be able to perform the Kamehameha and Instant Transmission techniques after having seen each one only once.\n\nOf the three main villains in Dragon Ball Z, Buu is the only one who doesn't have Frieza's cells inside him, the only one whom Vegeta doesn't help out (working for Frieza and letting Cell absorb Android 18), the least intelligent of the three (before absorbing Piccolo, that is), the only one without a tail (instead he has a head tentacle which he uses to smash/grab people with, not to mention turn people to food with it), and the only main villain to take orders from a weaker villain.\n\nReferences[]\n\n8.
