I could just change the proporsal of the OP to class G, but anyway, let's wait for more input.\n\nHe lifted a hill/mountain which should be class T.\n\nNo it wouldent, it says\n\n“The weight of the heaviest mountains”\n\nemphasis on the word heaviest, theyres a big difference between say a hill and Mount Everest. But in this specific case, and I’m just eyeballing it, I don’t think this qualifies for “heaviest of mountains”\n\nAlso, seems like the Calc wasn't made by an official Calc member.\n\nthat really doesn’t matter\n\nAnd besides for calcs to get approved they need to get accepted by a calc member\n\nAnd, in Dragon Ball, things are visually small, but in reality big, when we see a chunk of mountain ranges, for us could be small, but they are bigger than we thought.\n\nThat should be saved for an entirely different thread all together,\n\nisn't Moro already way past Cell is scaling in physicals? So whats the point of only giving it to TK?\n\nAlso question.....doesn't he use Magic to amp himself just like Ki? If so, the difference is only in name, mechanically they are same.\n\nYeah, his physicals should grant him way more lifting strenght than Cell.\n\n-To answer your question: No, he uses Magic to absorb Life energy from planets and living beings, and then boost himself, he does this through his Magical Life force drain ability.\n\nAnd, DB always treated Magic and Ki as separate entities.\n\nA good example was Babidi's \"Wizard Barrier\" which enabled him to withstand 4-B attacks from Majin Boo and Majin Vegeta IIRCC. A Ki barrier would've been destroyed instantly, as Babidi's Ki/Battle power was insignificant, Babidi by raw physicals would be hella weaker than Saiyan saga Vegeta, so there is that.\n\nYeah, his physicals should grant him way more lifting strenght than Cell.\n\n-To answer your question: No, he uses Magic to absorb Life energy from planets and living beings, and then boost himself, he does this through his Magical Life force drain ability.\n\nAnd, DB always treated Magic and Ki as separate entities.\n\nA good example was Babidi's \"Wizard Barrier\" which enabled him to withstand 4-B attacks from Majin Boo and Majin Vegeta IIRCC.

And his own body isn't strong enough to channel it, i.e Babibidi is an exception to the rule. i can name a few examples of such cases in other fiction. We know in DB ki strength and Biological/physiological strength are closely related.\n\nbut my point is as different entities as magic and Ki are, wouldn't amp mechanics be similar?\n\nfor analogy, like milk and water are different, but both are edible liquids.\n\nSince we see magic is amping various characters in Buu arc, like Vegeta, Dabura, those two grunts who drained Gohan in tournament, or Pui Pui etc.\n\nClearly their biology allows full usage of magical energies in their body.\n\nI don't see how you jump from \"18 tons + stress from extra gravity\", to casually 8,000,000 tons, and then back to \"4000 tons + stress from extra gravity + stress from flying\".\n\nDoes it matter tho? What they can output during a fight should be more important then something done during training.\n\nScans please\n\nI only remember instances from anime, cuz thats all i have seen. Gotta wait tho, need to sift through YT.\n\nWeight not being a factor in Gravity Training is a myth, it’s literally stated to be difficult because it makes characters weigh more.\n\nA strawman, nobody here has said that.\n\nThanks for the answer.\n\nbut heres another take, babidi is more proficient with Magic than with Ki, so obviously his Magic is more stronger.

As you may have seen, Magic focuses more on Hax, such as Mind control, Corruption, sealing, possesion, Soul manipulation, creation, etc...., Whenever you get a physical increase, such as Power bestobal or statistics amp is thanks to a Magical ability, but not from training or your own strenght.\n\nRather gaining power from absorbing or being granted by someone else though Hax.\n\n(AKA Dark Magic from DBH, which Towa uses to manipulate some villians, or the power bestobal from Moro, which he used to boost his goons).\n\nMagic was never shown to be applicable for destructive pruporses, unlike Ki, that with enough amounts you can blow up universes lol.\n\nAlso, what do you mean about Babidi not handeling It in his body? His Magic Power is heriously above his Ki levels, that's why he could handle Majin Vegeta's and Majin Buu's attacks.\n\nBabidi is not even Comparable to Saiyan saga Vegeta in terms of pure AP.\n\nWasn't telekinesis always treated as something different from ki, to the point that it if often called \"special power\"? (I remember them saying it to Chiaotzu and then to Moro).\n\nAlso, characters always affected stronger ones (to a certain extent) with their power, see Guldo and Moro (although the latter can be argued to be magic-based).\n\nKaioshins also have it, but it's once again a power of its own (divine powers, mentioned by Zamasu).\n\nFor this reason I think Cell's feat might be fine, but I'm iffy on scaling it to physicals as a byproduct of ki.\n\nWasn't telekinesis always treated as something different from ki, to the point that it if often called \"special power\"?

Same with freeza, also there was a scene with Goku holding water out of a cup with telekinesis all the way back in Z. I'm pretty sure it's a technique but it's done with regular ki, like how not everyone can use the kienzan but it's still just ki."
