René of Anjou (1409–1480) was a prominent figure of the House of Valois-Anjou during the 15th century. He held various titles throughout his lifetime, including Duke of Anjou, Count of Provence, King of Naples (from 1435 to 1442), Duke of Bar, and Duke of Lorraine.

Born on January 16, 1409, in the castle of Angers, René was the second son of Duke Louis II of Anjou, who was also the King of Naples, and Yolanda of Aragon. He was the brother of Marie of Anjou, who later married Charles VII of France and became Queen of France.

René himself was married at a young age to Isabella, the daughter of Charles II, Duke of Lorraine. He had a complex relationship with the Burgundians but initially showed loyalty to the French crown, joining the French army in 1429 and witnessing the consecration of Charles VII.

In 1434, he was confirmed as the Duke of Lorraine by the Holy Roman Emperor Sigismund. However, conflicts with the Burgundians led to his imprisonment, his release from which involved a heavy ransom.

René’s life was characterised by political turmoil, particularly the contestation of his claim to the Kingdom of Naples, by Alfonso V of Aragon. He returned to France in 1441, and never regained rule over Naples.

Throughout his life, René was involved in various diplomatic efforts, including negotiations with the English and the marriage of his daughter Margaret to Henry VI of England.

In his later years, René devoted himself to the arts, including painting, poetry, and theatre. He commissioned translations of classical works and wrote allegorical works, such as “Le Mortifiement de vaine plaisance” and “Le Livre du Cuer d’amours espris.”

He died on July 10, 1480, in Aix-en-Provence. René’s legacy encompasses both his artistic contributions and his broader role within the cultural and political ethos of his time.
