        "text": "Are you planning to visit the Château d'Angers? It's an excellent idea, we loved discovering this unique place!\n\nClassified as a historic monument since 1875, it houses the famous Apocalypse tapestry, listed inUNESCO's Memory of the World register. This national estate has had an incredible destiny, and we'll tell you all about it as we go along. First a medieval fortress, then the residence of the Dukes of Anjou, it became a prison between the 16th and 19th centuries.\n\nIn this article, you'll find all the practical tips and photos you need to prepare your visit to the château.\n\nWhy visit the Castle in Angers?\n\nIs the Château d'Angers worth it? Our opinion:\n\nThe Château d'Angers offers total immersion in the medieval history of the Pays de la Loire region. Its 17 imposing towers and well-preserved ramparts offer spectacular views of the city and its surroundings. Inside, the monumental tapestry of the Apocalypse transported us into a fantastic tale combining Christian mythology and 14th-century reality. As we wandered through the corridors of this fortress, we followed in the footsteps of the Dukes of Anjou and especially the Plantagenets, plunging into the royal history of France and the kings of England. This château is much more than a monument, it's a journey through time that will delight lovers of architecture, art and history.\n\nIt's one of the best-known Loire castles.\n\n>> Book your ticket\n\nWhy is the Château d'Angers famous?\n\nThis castle has achieved worldwide renown thanks to the tapestry of the Apocalypse, a medieval work of rare scope that fascinated us with its scale and artistic complexity. It has been listed onUNESCO 's Memory of the World register since May 2023. What's more, the monument's unique architecture and 17 impressive towers bear witness to its historical importance as a medieval royal fortress. Situated in the heart of the city of Angers, its location makes it an emblem of the Pays de la Loire region. We loved discovering this castle and its hidden treasures!\n\nIt's one of the best attractions in Angers.\n\nOur favorite moments\n\nLater in this article, we'll give you the details of our experience at the château, but we couldn't wait to share our favorite moments with you:\n\ncontemplation of the tapestry of the Apocalypse: a unique masterpiece that transported us into a story mixing historical reality and fiction!\n\nthe 360° panorama of Angers: a superb viewpoint awaited us at the top of the castle ramparts, and we were captivated by the view!\n\nthe hanging gardens: an island of greenery skilfully laid out within the walls of the national site, which won us over completely!\n\nPractical tips and map of Château d'Angers, France\n\nWhere is the Castle in Angers?\n\nThe château is located at 2 Promenade du Bout du Monde (49100) in Angers, Maine-et-Loire.\n\nDriving time from Nantes: 1h20,\n\nDriving time from Tours: 1h20,\n\nDriving time from Saumur: 45min,\n\nDriving time from Blois: 2h,\n\nDriving time from Orléans: 2h30.\n\nHere is a map to help you find your way:\n\nHow to get there?\n\nTo get to Angers, you can opt for the train. There are regular connections from nearby train stations, such as Saumur (20min) and Tours (50min), as well as from Paris (1h40). Once you've reached your destination, it's a 12-minute walk to the Château d'Angers. If you're looking for a 3-day train itinerary to discover the chateaux of the Loire Valley, we've put together a dedicated article for you.\n\nSee the available schedules and book your train tickets now.\n\nIf you're coming from further afield and have decided to fly, we recommend landing at Nantes airport rather than the huge Paris airports. The train journey to Angers will be shorter, and you'll bypass the hustle and bustle of the capital. However, you can also rent a car at Nantes airport. This is the fastest option.\n\nCompare available flights.\n\nYou can also come directly by car, as the town is well served by the A11 freeway and the N23 trunk road. If you're planning to visit several Loire castles, we advise you to bring your own vehicle. It's the most convenient way to get from one tourist attraction to the next without wasting too much time.\n\nParking\n\nThe château does not have its own parking lot. However, you will have access to a paid public parking lot on President Kennedy's Square, located at the foot of the monument. Relatively modest in size, it can quickly fill up during peak summer and weekend periods.\n\nParking is charged everywhere and relatively expensive, but you should be able to find a space in the Ralliement or station parking lots (less than a 10-minute walk away). More information will be available on the city's official website here.\n\nIf you've decided to come by bike, you'll find dedicated spaces right next to the President Kennedy parking lot.\n\nBest time to visit the castle\n\nA must-see when visiting the Pays de la Loire region, the Château d'Angers is the region's most visited historic monument during the summer months. No fewer than 246,000 visitors were registered throughout 2022. As you can see, if you want to avoid the busiest times of the year, we recommend avoiding the summer period and other school vacations.\n\nWhat's more, most of your visit will take place outdoors. There are very few interiors to visit at the château. You'll need to take weather conditions into account to get the most out of the experience. The 360° panorama over Angers is even more pleasant on a sunny day.\n\n>> Book your ticket\n\nLength of visit and main difficulties\n\nWe recommend that you allow at least 2 hours for your visit to the Château d'Angers.\n\nThe monument is not entirely suitable for people with reduced mobility or children in baby carriages. We noted several staircases and raised floors throughout our visit. As most of the walk takes place outdoors, you'll be confronted with a number of difficulties linked to the many steps and slopes required to access the ramparts. We suggest you consult the map of the castle's accessibility below.\n\nFor the visually impaired, you'll find tactile representations of certain works in the château. In our photo below, it's the bust of King René.\n\nAdvice on how to visit\n\nTo discover the castle, you don't necessarily need to follow a specific route. The main focus will be on exploring the exterior of the estate, as there will be few interiors to see. For our part, we started with lunch at the Monument Café, the castle's restaurant. After a gourmet break, we began our tour with the Governor's Dwelling and the Field Gate, as we were located right next door.\n\nAs you can see from the château plan below, we started with the west wing. We then climbed the ramparts of the monument to take in the view of Angers and its river. From this vantage point, the landscape was impressive, blending nature and city.\n\nAfterwards, we strolled through the château's gardens. This lovely green setting seemed to be suspended above the city. At the eastern end, we made our way to the mill tower, which offered a panoramic view of the river below. We continued our visit by passing under the châtelet to reach the royal dwelling and its chapel.\n\nOn leaving the dwelling, we discovered the archaeological zone of the castle directly opposite. We then walked to the wall of the Palais Comtal, which overlooked La Maine. Did you know? It's not the Loire that bypasses Angers to the south, but the Maine, one of its tributaries. To conclude our tour in style, we gazed in amazement at the tapestry of the Apocalypse.\n\nAngers castle with children\n\nThe castle is child-friendly. It offers a range of tools to help younger visitors discover the site in a fun way: a booklet-game (€2), audioguides (€3), guided tours, unusual tours, workshops and events. You'll have a great time with your family, even if the castle isn't exactly magical. For more information on these activities, please visit the château's official website here.\n\nSchedules and rates\n\nSchedules:\n\nopen from May 2 to September 4 between 10am and 6:30pm,\n\nopen from September 5 to April 30 between 10am and 5:30pm,\n\nclosed on January 1, May 1 and December 25.\n\nTicket price:\n\nadult full price: €9.50,\n\nfree for children under 18.\n\nBook your ticket to the Château d'Angers now.\n\nGuided tours\n\nThe château offers several types of visit: with an audioguide (€3), guided tours, events (such as medieval board games), unusual tours and workshops.\n\nCatering\n\nIn the castle: the Monument Café\n\nLocated in the grounds of the Château d'Angers, we had lunch at the Monument Café. This charming restaurant boasts a lovely outdoor terrace, which we were delighted to sit out on. In the shade of a tree, we enjoyed sweet and savory verrines, homemade from local, seasonal produce.\n\nThis restaurant has been awarded the Tables et Auberges de France label, and also offers daily specials in casseroles. Our photos give you an idea of the products on offer in their all-day tea room. We highly recommend a gourmet break during your visit to the château.\n\nOutside the château: other options\n\nPlease note that picnics are not permitted on site, so you'll have to leave the castle for lunch. You're sure to find a pleasant place to settle on the banks of the Maine.\n\nYou can also eat outside the castle. Angers has an excellent restaurant offer. With a breathtaking view of the monument, Restaurant Chez Pont-Pont offers a menu of meat and fish dishes, and pizzas, at reasonable prices.\n\nFor lovers of sweet and savoury dishes, we strongly recommend you try the Crêperie du Château, just a few metres from the national site. The menu features delicious galettes and crêpes made with local produce.\n\nThe great history of the Château d'Angers\n\nOver the centuries, the château has had many different destinies. Originally built as a medieval fortress, it successively became the residence of the Dukes of Anjou, a prison, and finally a historic monument open to the public. The national site is home to the forgotten palace of the famous Plantagenet family. Considered the last counts of Anjou, the Plantagenets became kings of England in the 12th century. Connected to the region, some members of the family are buried at the Royal Abbey of Fontevraud, not far from the Château d'Angers.\n\nFrom prehistory to the 13th century\n\nAlthough the castle is emblematic of medieval history, the site also contains traces dating back to the Neolithic period. The land on which it stands today was once inhabited by our prehistoric ancestors, as archaeological finds testify. Visiting this monument opened a window on a past even more distant than we had imagined.\n\nJump back in time to the heart of the 9th century, when Angers felt the Viking threat hanging over it. To confront him, Charles the Bald, King of France, officially gave birth to the castle, but it did not yet have its current scale and splendor.\n\nOnce a modest count's palace, home to the powerful Plantagenet family between the 11th and 14th centuries, the castle took on a whole new dimension. Under the impetus of Queen Blanche of Castile (mother of Louis IX), it became a huge royal fortress with 17 defensive towers from 1230 onwards. The aim was to protect the border of the kingdom of France.\n\nThe residence of the Dukes of Anjou\n\nBetween the 14th and 15th centuries, the château was home to influential members of the French royal family, the Dukes of Anjou. They renovated the site, overseeing the construction of magnificent flamboyant Gothic buildings at its heart. Passionate about art, they commission works such as the gigantic tapestry of the Apocalypse. We can salute their artistic legacy, which continues to dazzle us to this day.\n\nFrom castle to prison\n\nAt the end of the 16th century, the château was in danger following the departure of King René and the attachment of Anjou to the crown. The Huguenots (the name given to French Protestants during the Wars of Religion) seized the site twice, and the King of France (Henry III) decided to raze the fortress to the ground. Fortunately, its governor, Donadieu de Puycharic, eventually redesigned it to its current silhouette.\n\nUntil the 19th century, the château lost its royal dimension and was transformed into a prison. It was home to many prisoners, including Nicolas Fouquet, who was arrested by the famous D'Artagnan. During this dark period, the castle's walls served as an outlet for the prisoners, who left their mark on the walls.\n\nThe 17-tower fortress\n\nThe castle towers stand majestically in the heart of Angers, silent reminders of medieval times. Their robust architecture and imposing heights bear witness to their defensive role. We were impressed by their imposing silhouettes of schist and tufa stone. From their summit, some thirty meters above sea level, we enjoyed a magnificent panorama of the city and its surroundings.\n\nA royal castle full of surprises\n\nAfter this little historical contextualization, it's time to dive into the tour of the site!\n\nContemplating the 15th-century châtelet\n\nBefore discovering the royal dwelling and its chapel, we suggest you take a few minutes to contemplate the 15th-century châtelet. This majestic building marks the boundary between the 2 main parts of the site: the defensive fortress and the château residence of the Dukes of Anjou.\n\nAs we passed under the arch of the châtelet, we could make out the wall of the Palais Comtal against the blue sky. We were transported to another era for a few minutes.\n\nDiscover the royal dwelling and its chapel\n\nThe château has few interiors, but you'll be able to enter the royal dwelling and its adjoining chapel. We were curious to discover what was hidden in these buildings.\n\nBetween the miniature reconstructions of the castle in different eras, historical objects, sculptures and paintings, art and history lovers are sure to be satisfied! Beyond the collection, we were struck by the beauty of the place. We could easily imagine a royal family living here in the luxury of yesteryear.\n\nWe then discovered the chapel, which we admired for its elegance. Its high ceilings and magnificent vaulted ceilings charmed us. We were also captivated by its colorful stained glass windows, which seemed to bring the vast room to life. It was built by Louis II and Yolande d'Aragon around 1410.\n\nBut who was the good King René d'Anjou?\n\nThe Dukes of Anjou, and in particular the last of them, King René (1409-1480), had a profound influence on the château's development. In particular, he had the châtelet and the royal dwelling built in the flamboyant Gothic style. After visiting the château, we can assure you that it definitely had good taste!\n\nRené d'Anjou was a man of letters, a patron of the arts and a sovereign renowned for his passion for the arts and culture. He was also a monarch involved in the politics of his time. His reign is particularly linked to the Anjou region, where he encouraged the flourishing of the arts, literature and architecture. We thought this exhibition was a good idea, as it highlights a personality who played an important role in the château's development.\n\nObserve the wall of the Palais comtal\n\nLong before it became a real castle with a defensive purpose, the Counts of Anjou took up residence here in the 9th century. Taking advantage of the unique setting, perched on a rocky escarpment overlooking the river, they built an authentic palace. We were able to admire the wall of the old building, which is the remnant of the first version of the Plantagenet castle.\n\nWe were captivated by the view from the great gateway through the wall of the Count's palace. We could contemplate the Maine River flowing below us, and the barges that brought it to life.\n\nMust-sees on your visit\n\nWe've listed our favorite activities from our visit to the château. In our opinion, these are the must-haves for the national site.\n\nWhat's behind the field door?\n\nWe couldn't wait to discover the secrets of the Field Gate. But before talking about this monument to archaeology, we discovered the 4 Angers candlesticks. Commissioned from visual artist Sarkis in 1993, they reduce the stone volume of the château's rib-vaulted rooms to one-fifth. His work will be reworked in 2012, with the addition of colored neon. We were pleasantly surprised by this artistic experience built around colorful sensations. The confrontation between the bright color and the period walls made a lasting impression on us.\n\nWondering why the porte des champs is so famous? The oldest portcullis in France, it is made of wood, more specifically oak. Archaeologists have determined that the trees used to build the gate were cut down between 1373 and 1384. We were amazed by the robustness of the portcullis, which was the main entrance to the château at the time. In our photo below, you can see it from inside the site.\n\nYou may be wondering the same thing we are. How can this harrow be so well preserved? The answer surprised us, but in the end it was quite logical. The château has never really been attacked (with the exception of the Huguenots in the 16th century), so the gate has never been breached. We were extremely lucky to be able to observe an authentic vestige of the Middle Ages.\n\nAdmire the tapestry of the Apocalypse\n\nThis hanging is an exceptionally large-scale medieval work, depicting detailed scenes from the last book of the Bible. Measuring 103m long and 4.40m high, it is the oldest and longest surviving tapestry from the Middle Ages. We were impressed by the technical quality and finesse of its weaving. The room, bathed in half-light, honors the work and highlights its shimmering hues.\n\nWe have learned that it was commissioned by Louis I d'Anjou in 1375. It illustrates the Apocalypse according to Saint John, as well as contemporary events such as the Hundred Years' War. We tried to decipher some of the scenes. Its story reads like a giant comic book.\n\nOn your way out of the château, don't hesitate to cross the river Maine to discover the Musée Jean Lurçat, featuring a contemporary tapestry on the theme of the apocalypse, woven by the great French master a few years after Hiroshima.\n\nStroll through the château gardens\n\nEven before entering the château, we could appreciate the beauty of the gardens and its magnificent flowerbeds from Place Kennedy. The shapes carved into the vegetation were impressively precise and fine. We loved the contrast of colors, blending a pink gradient with the predominant green. Once we reached the top of a fortification, we didn't have the same perspective on the gardens, which slightly altered the vegetation patterns below.\n\nAngers is considered the garden of France, and is the country's main horticultural zone. Set on a rocky outcrop in the heart of the city, this natural paradise was a real delight. We have King René to thank for being the first to plant the monument. These gardens are contemporary creations influenced by medieval vegetation. In our opinion, this clash of eras is a successful gamble!\n\nEnjoy a unique panoramic view of Angers\n\nThere's more to come! Head for the \"chemin de la ronde\" along the castle ramparts. We first climbed a slope to reach the fortifications. Once we'd reached the top of the towers, we took our time to cover the 500m walk, immersing ourselves in the delightful scenery.\n\nPerched on a hill, the château offered spectacular views over Angers and its picturesque surroundings. The Maine River meandering through the city added a touch of tranquility to the scene, making it an unforgettable experience. Impressed by the view, we have precious memories of this escape through the ages.\n\nFrequently asked questions\n\nWhich châteaux to visit around Angers?\n\nIf you're looking for your next castle destination less than 1h40 away by car, we've written several articles dedicated to you:\n\nvisit the Château de Chenonceau,\n\nvisit the Château de Saumur,\n\nvisit the Royal Abbey of Fontevraud,\n\nvisit the Château d'Azay-le-Rideau,\n\nvisit Nantes castle,\n\nvisit the Château de Brissac,\n\nvisit Château du Rivau,\n\nvisit the royal château of Amboise.\n\nSee our article on the best châteaux around Angers.\n\nWhich Loire châteaux to visit in 3 days?"
