The families of the seigneurs de Braitel were studied in the later 19th century by Samuel Menjot dElbenne .\n\n1.GUILLAUME . His name is confirmed by the charter dated to [1064/76] under which his son \"Hugo de Braietello\" donated \"ecclesiam in Sanctæ Trinitatis in parochial Sancti Celerini\", now called \"ex nomine patris mei Capella Guillelmi\", to Marmoutier . m ---. The name of Guillaumes wife is not known. Guillaume & his wife had [two] children:\n\na)HUGUES (-1076). Seigneur de Braitel. \"Hugo castri Breietelli possessor in pago Cenomannensi\" donated \"ecclesiam in Dunensi pago Lazellam\", now called \"ex nomine patris mei Capella Guillelmi\", to Marmoutier, with the consent of \"conjugis mee Erme atque unice filie Hervise, nepotum quoque meorum filiorum Rotberti de Monte Boone, Gauffredi atque Guillelmi\" and with the permission of \"domine mee Mahildis filie Galterii de Aloia filiorumque ac filiarum eiusdem, quibus patres fuere Guillelmus cognomento Gugetus et Gauffredus de Medana Willelmi, Hildeburgis et Richildis, item Hamelini, Galterii et Hersendis\" by charter dated to [1050/60] . \"Hugo de Braietello\" donated \"ecclesiam in Sanctæ Trinitatis in parochial Sancti Celerini\", now called \"ex nomine patris mei Capella Guillelmi\", to Marmoutier, with the consent of \"uxore sua Erma\", by charter dated to [1064/76], which also records the donation by \"Gaufredus gener suus et Hervisa filia eiusdem Hugonis, uxor Gauffredi\" . m ERME, daughter of ---. \"Hugo castri Breietelli possessor in pago Cenomannensi\" donated \"ecclesiam in Dunensi pago Lazellam\" to Marmoutier, with the consent of \"conjugis mee Erme \" by charter dated to [1050/60] . \"Hugo de Braietello\" donated \"ecclesiam in Sanctæ Trinitatis in parochial Sancti Celerini\", now called \"ex nomine patris mei Capella Guillelmi\", to Marmoutier, with the consent of \"uxore sua Erma\", by charter dated to [1064/76] . Hugues & [his wife] had one child:\n\ni)HERVISE . \"Hugo castri Breietelli possessor in pago Cenomannensi\" donated \"ecclesiam in Dunensi pago Lazellam\" to Marmoutier, with the consent of \"conjugis mee Erme atque unice filie Hervise \" by charter dated to [1050/60] . As is usual with sources such as this, the document contains no indication that Hervise was the donors daughter by his marriage to Erme. \"Hugo de Braietello\" donated \"ecclesiam in Sanctæ Trinitatis in parochial Sancti Celerini\", now called \"ex nomine patris mei Capella Guillelmi\", to Marmoutier, with the consent of \"uxore sua Erma\", by charter dated to [1064/76], which also records the donation made by \"Gaufredus gener suus et Hervisa filia eiusdem Hugonis, uxor Gauffredi\" . m (before [1064/76]) GEOFFROY, son of ROSCELIN Vicomte du Maine & his wife --- (-after [1080/95], presumably before 1096).\n\nb) [daughter . Assuming that nepotum, in the source quoted below, can be interpreted in its strict sense of nephews, one of the parents of the two sons named below was the sibling of the donor. The naming of their father, without reference to any family relationship, suggests that it was their mother who was the donors relative.] m ROBERT de Mont Boon, son of ---. Robert & his wife had two children:\n\ni)GEOFFROY . \"Hugo castri Breietelli possessor in pago Cenomannensi\" donated \"ecclesiam in Dunensi pago Lazellam\" to Marmoutier, with the consent of \"conjugis mee Erme atque unice filie Hervise, nepotum quoque meorum filiorum Rotberti de Monte Boone, Gauffredi atque Guillelmi\" by charter dated to [1050/60] .\n\nii)GUILLAUME . \"Hugo castri Breietelli possessor in pago Cenomannensi\" donated \"ecclesiam in Dunensi pago Lazellam\" to Marmoutier, with the consent of \"conjugis mee Erme atque unice filie Hervise, nepotum quoque meorum filiorum Rotberti de Monte Boone, Gauffredi atque Guillelmi\" by charter dated to [1050/60] .\n\n2.HERVE de Braitel (-after [1065]). \"Herveus de Braitel\" donated a mill at \"Mesharenchio\" to Saint-Vincent du Mans by charter dated to [1065] . His relationship, if any, to Guillaume de Braitel has not been determined.\n\nB. SEIGNEURS de BRAITEL (BEAUMONT)\n\nGEOFFROY, son of ROSCELIN Vicomte du Maine & his wife --- (-after [1080/95])) . \"Gaufridus filius Roscelini vicecomitis\" sold \"ecclesias de Sogona\" to Saint-Vincent du Mans by charter dated to [1060] . \"Huberti vicecomitis, Gaufridi avunculi sui \" witnessed a charter dated to [1067/69] which records a donation by \"Willelmus cognomento Osoenus\" to Saint-Vincent du Mans . \"Hubertus vicecomes\" donated \"capellam Sancti Floscelli martiris in urbe Cenomannica\" to Saint-Vincent du Mans, for the souls of \"uxoris Ermengardis et filiorum suorum Radulfi, Huberti atque Guillelmi\", by charter dated to [1080/95], witnessed by \"uxor eius Armengardis et filii eorum Radulfus, Hubertus atque Willelmus, Goffridus suus patruus \" . [Vicomte: Geoffroy is called vicecomitis in the charter of his son dated 1096 quoted below, but no indication has been found in the sources so far consulted that he used the title himself.] Geoffroy presumably died before 1096, the date of the charter issued by his son.\n\nm (before [1064/76]) HERVISE de Braitel, daughter of HUGUES Seigneur de Braitel & his wife [Erme ---]. \"Hugo castri Breietelli possessor in pago Cenomannensi\" donated \"ecclesiam in Dunensi pago Lazellam\" to Marmoutier, with the consent of \"conjugis mee Erme atque unice filie Hervise \" by charter dated to [1050/60] . As is usual with sources such as this, the document contains no indication that Hervise was the donors daughter by his marriage to Erme. \"Hugo de Braietello\" donated \"ecclesiam in Sanctæ Trinitatis in parochial Sancti Celerini\", now called \"ex nomine patris mei Capella Guillelmi\", to Marmoutier, with the consent of \"uxore sua Erma\", by charter dated to [1064/76], which also records the donation by \"Gaufredus gener suus et Hervisa filia eiusdem Hugonis, uxor Gauffredi\" .\n\nGeoffroy & his wife had three children:\n\n1.GUILLAUME de Braitel (-[1116 or after]). \"Willelmus Braitellensis filius Gaufridi vicecomitis\" donated \"ecclesiam de villa Domnolium\" to Saint-Vincent du Mans, with the consent of \"fratres mei Hugo atque Gaufridus\" and \"Radulfus Rothroci filius et Godehilda uxor eius et Giroius eius filius, atque Gaufridus et Willelmus atque Helvisa et Margarita filii et filie eorum\", by charter dated 1096 . \" Willelmus de Braitello, Hugo, Gaufridus, fratres eius et Odo bastardus \" witnessed the charter dated 22 Jun 1096 which records the donation by \"Wido de Sarciaco cum fratribus suis Nicholao atque Pagano\" to Saint-Vincent du Mans, on joining the crusade . He joined the crusade in 1096 . \"Willelmus filius Gaufridi vicecomitis\" donated \"ecclesia Sancti Martini de Lunbrun\" to Saint-Vincent du Mans, after recovering \"honorem suum de Bruitello\", by undated charter dated to [1080/1102], witnessed by \"Odone fratre eius bastardo\" . The reference to Guillaume recovering his honour of Braitel indicates that he must have forfeited it at some point. No source has been found which sheds light on the circumstances of this forfeiture or concerning its recovery, whether involving the dukes of Normandy/kings of England or the comtes dAnjou. The source which names Geoffroy in 1116 has not yet been identified.\n\n2.HUGUES de Braitel (-after 21 Oct 1110). \"Willelmus Braitellensis filius Gaufridi vicecomitis\" donated \"ecclesiam de villa Domnolium\" to Saint-Vincent du Mans, with the consent of \"fratres mei Hugo atque Gaufridus\", by charter dated 1096 . \" Willelmus de Braitello, Hugo, Gaufridus, fratres eius et Odo bastardus \" witnessed the charter dated 22 Jun 1096 which records the donation by \"Wido de Sarciaco cum fratribus suis Nicholao atque Pagano\" to Saint-Vincent du Mans, on joining the crusade . \" Hugo de Braitel \" witnessed the charter dated 21 Oct 1110 which records that Hélie Comte du Maine renounced rights to revenue from the fair of St Thomas .\n\n3.GEOFFROY de Braitel (-after 22 Jun 1096). \"Willelmus Braitellensis filius Gaufridi vicecomitis\" donated \"ecclesiam de villa Domnolium\" to Saint-Vincent du Mans, with the consent of \"fratres mei Hugo atque Gaufridus\", by charter dated 1096 . \" Willelmus de Braitello, Hugo, Gaufridus, fratres eius et Odo bastardus \" witnessed the charter dated 22 Jun 1096 which records the donation by \"Wido de Sarciaco cum fratribus suis Nicholao atque Pagano\" to Saint-Vincent du Mans, on joining the crusade .\n\nGeoffroy had one illegitimate child by an unknown mistress:\n\n4.EUDES de Braitel . \"Willelmus filius Gaufridi vicecomitis\" donated \"ecclesia Sancti Martini de Lunbrun\" to Saint-Vincent du Mans, after recovering \"honorem suum de Bruitello\", by undated charter dated to [1080/1102], witnessed by \"Odone fratre eius bastardo\" . \" Willelmus de Braitello, Hugo, Gaufridus, fratres eius et Odo bastardus \" witnessed the charter dated 22 Jun 1096 which records the donation by \"Wido de Sarciaco cum fratribus suis Nicholao atque Pagano\" to Saint-Vincent du Mans, on joining the crusade .\n\nNo later source has yet been identified which indicates the subsequent ownership of the seigneurie de Braitel.\n\nChapter 2. SEIGNEURS de CHAOURCES (SOURCHES)\n\nThe castle of Sourches en Saint-Symphorien, previously known as Chaources, is situated in the canton of Conlie in the present-day French département of la Sarthe, north-west of Le Mans. Cars and Ledru note that in medieval times there existed two castles of the same name, located close to each other, held by different families of seigneurs whom they suggest were descended from the brothers Bouchard [I] and Hugues [I] who are shown below . The definitive reconstruction of this family is hampered by the number of references to individuals named Hugues. They have been separated for presentational purposes into six different persons. It is likely that there is considerable overlap, but it is not possible to ascertain with certainty the number of different persons named Hugues de Chaources who existed.\n\n1.ERNAUD de Brizay (-after 1045). Cars and Ledru name Simon de Brizay, présent en 1050 à la fondation du prieuré de Saint-André de Mirebeau, Bouchard seigneur de Sourches et Hugues seigneur de Marigné, tige des de Sourches seigneurs de Saint-Aignan, de Brûlon, de Malicorne et de Bernay as the sons of Ernauld de Brizay, vivant encore en 1045 . He does cite the primary sources which confirm the affiliation and it is possible that is speculative. Ernauds three supposed sons are therefore shown in square brackets below. m ---.

Hugues [IV] may have been the same person as Hugues [III] who is shown above. A charter dated to [1080/1120] records a donation by \"Hugo de Cadurciis\" to the church of Saint-Vincent du Mans, naming \"quodam suo milite Patricio\" . \"Hugo de Cadurciis\" consented to the donation of \"ecclesiam Sancti Martini de Bellofaio\" to Saint-Vincent du Mans by \"Teobaudus et Radulfus de Torciaco\", by charter dated to end-11th century .\n\n1.HUGUES [V] de Chaources (-after [1090/96]). The chronology suggests that Hugues [V] may have been the same person as Hugues [IV] who is named above. Hugo de Cadurciis, senioris Patricii pater donated vicum Sancti Medardi, justa castrum Baladonis to Saint-Pierre de la Couture by charter dated to [1090/96] . m ---. The name of Huguess wife is not known. Hugues [V] & his wife had one child:\n\na)PATRICE [II] de Chaources (-after [1095]).

It is uncertain whether \"Patricius de Cadurcis\" who made the earlier donation (undoubtedly Patrice [III]) was the same person as \"Patricius de Cadurcis filius Patricii\" who made the later donation. The latter could also have been the person who is called Patrick [II] in the corresponding UNTITLED ENGLISH NOBILITY document.

None of the recorded charters in which the sons of Robert, brother of Archbishop Gervais, are named record a son named Hugues. In addition, no record has been found that the archbishop's sister Rotrude had a son named Hugues. The archbishop's brother Guillaume appears to have survived later than the brother Avesgaud. It is therefore probable that Hugues was the son of Guillaume, although there is no proof that this is the case. The cartulary of Château-du-Loir refers to, but does not reproduce, an agreement between \"Hugues le Long Seigneur de Château-du-Loir neveu de Gervais et son héritier\" and the abbey of La Trinité de Vendôme under which Hugues settled his dispute with the abbey concerning the ponds of Villedieu . Although the original has not been checked, there must be some doubt about the accuracy of the document as there is no other record of \"Hugues\" being the successor of Gervais. \"Fulco de Matefelon\" recognised rights of the monks of Saint-Serge d'Angers by charter dated [1090], witnessed by \"Hugo de Castello Lidi\" . m (1072 or before) ALEXANDRIE de Bouloire, daughter of --- de Bouloire & his wife ---.

Her parentage is confirmed by a charter dated to [1100] under which the monks of Angers Saint-Aubin recall the history of \"ecclesiam de Comburniaco\", seized by \"Fulcho comes\" [Foulques III \"Nerra\" Comte dAnjou] and given to \"Hamelino de Castro Ledi\", who granted it to \"Widdoni de Valle cum filia sua in maritagio\" . If this report is correct, Rotrude must have married before [1030], the estimated date of death of her father.

The absence of Robert from the list of those consenting to the donation of his son Gervais dated [Sep 1067/23 Sep 1068] (see below) implies that he had predeceased the donation. On the other hand, his son Gervais is named \"Gervasium filium Roberti\" in a charter dated 8 Mar 1071 , which suggests that his father might then still have been alive.

SEIGNEURS de LAVAL\n\nA. SEIGNEURS de LAVAL\n\nThe castle of Laval was situated on the banks of the river Mayenne and was constructed by Guy [I] Seigneur de Laval, as shown by two charters which describe him as \"Guido, castri quod Vallis nuncupatur, in pago Cynnomennensi conditor atque possessor\" , who was a vassal of the comtes du Maine. No indication has been found about his parentage or origin. Broussillon suggests that he must have taken possession of Laval in [1020] .\n\nThe genealogy of the first dynasty of seigneurs de Laval has been the subject of much confusion over the years. The main problem in reconstructing the family is that six out of the seven early seigneurs de Laval were named Guy, five of whom succeeded in a direct line from father to son. This makes it harder to identify the specific person to whom undated primary sources relate. Some early secondary sources misinterpreted the sources and incorrectly concluded that there were seven seigneurs de Laval named Guy, instead of six. This introduced a hypothetical additional generation into the genealogy which caused a great deal of confusion. Broussillon appears to have been the first author to find his way accurately through the maze . His structure provides the basis for the reconstruction set out below, with some minor modifications and additions. The primary sources which Broussillon collected do provide sufficiently accurate information to assert that this reconstruction is definitive and that there were only six seigneurs de Laval named Guy. However, even Broussillon was confused about the numbering of the seigneurs de Laval. The difficulty is that Guy [IV] described himself as \"Guido quintus\" in a charter dated to [1150] under which he donated profits from a fair to the Knights Hospitallers of Jerusalem . At first sight this suggests that there must have been four earlier seigneurs de Laval named Guy. The solution to the difficulty is found in one of the charters of his son Guy [V] who is called \"Guido dominus sextus de Lavalle\" in his donation to Olivet priory dated to [1205] . The appropriate translation of this phrase is (adding punctuation) \"Guy, sixth lord of Laval\" not \"Guy the sixth, lord of Laval\". The former is an accurate description of him when we remember that Hamon Seigneur de Laval, son of Guy [I], was the second sire de Laval. It is reasonable therefore to assume that the reference to Guido quintus represents a contraction of the complete phrase Guido dominus quintus de Lavalle. It is suggested that the Laval family in England descended from Hugues, son of Hamon Seigneur de Laval.\n\nThe first dynasty of seigneurs de Laval became extinct in the male line on the death in 1211 of Guy [VI]. The castle passed to his sister Emma and to her children by her second husband Mathieu [II] Seigneur de Montmorency (who was constable of France).\n\n1.GUY [I] de Laval ([980/90]-before 26 Feb 1062) . Seigneur de Laval. \"Wido\" relinquished rights to the chapter of Le Mans, before leaving for Jerusalem, with the consent of \"Haimo, supra scripti Guidonis filius et uxor eius Hersendis filiique eorum Guido et Hugo\", by charter dated 11 Nov 1039 . The date of this charter is open to doubt, particularly because two of the known children of Guys grandson Guy [II] must have been born in the last decade of the 11th century. In addition, Guy [I] himself would have been unusually old when he died if he already had grandchildren in 1039. \" Guidonis de Valle filiorumque suorum Johannis et Hamonis\" consented to a donation by \"Fulcodius\" to Marmoutier by charter dated to [1040] . The monks of Marmoutier record a donation by \"Guido, castri quod Vallis nuncupatur, in pago Cynnomennensi conditor atque possessor\", at the request of \"Johannis filii sui monachi nostri\", with the consent of \"Haimone atque Guidone filiis suis Gervasium tres his sorores Hildesindem, Agnetem, Hildeburgem\", by charter dated to [1050] . The monks of Marmoutier record a donation by \"Guido, castri Vallis in pago Cenomannensi conditorem ac possessorem\", with the consent of \"suorumque filiorum Haimonis Gervasii atque Guidonis, simulque Agnetis\", by charter dated to [1050], witnessed by \" Rotrudis uxor predicti Widonis, Gualterius filius eius \" . The date of his death is set by the charter dated 26 Feb 1062, witnessed by \" Haimo de Lavalle \", which records an agreement of confraternity between Saint-Maurice dAngers and La Trinité de Vendôme . Guillaume II Duke of Normandy settled a claim in favour of the monks of Marmoutier relating to property donated by \"Guido de Valle\" by charter dated 1064, which names \"Iohannem monachum filium suum\" and is witnessed by \" Hamo de Valle filius Guidonis \" . This document does not state that Guy was alive at that date. m firstly ([1010/15]) BERTHE de Tosny, daughter of ---. Her marriage is confirmed by the charter dated [Sep/14 Oct] 1055 under which the monks of Marmoutier record the donations by \"quemdam militem Johannem pagi Cenomannensis indigenum, Widonis de Valle filium\" of property \"in Normannia, territorio Vilcassino ecclesiam in villa Guarniacus juxta fluvium Eptæ\" which \"Wido pater eorum\" accepted from \"uxore sua Berta, Johannis et Haimonis matre\" . Her connection with the Tosny family is confirmed by the charter dated 1063 which records the consent given by \"Rotbertum de Toeniaco, avunculum domni Johanni monachi nostri, filii Widonis de Valle\" to the donations by the latter to Marmoutier, authorised by \"Berengerius filius eius\" . The remaining question is the identity of her father. The date of her marriage is estimated from the charter dated 11 Nov 1039 in which her two grandsons are named (see above) . If this document is correctly dated (and this is open to doubt as discussed further above), Berthe could not have been the daughter of Roger [I] de Conches. There are two other possibilities. Either she was the daughter of Raoul [II] de Tosny or she was related to Robert de Tosny, who was Lord of Belvoir in 1086 and whose precise relationship with the main Tosny family has not been ascertained. m secondly (before [1030]) as her second husband, ROTRUDE de Château-du-Loir, widow of ---, daughter of HAMON Seigneur d'Argentré & his wife Hildeburge de Bellême (-after [1050]). The monks of Marmoutier record a donation by \"Guido, castri Vallis in pago Cenomannensi conditorem ac possessorem\", with the consent of \"suorumque filiorum Haimonis Gervasii atque Guidonis, simulque Agnetis\", by charter dated to [1050], witnessed by \" Rotrudis uxor predicti Widonis, Gualterius filius eius \" . Her parentage is confirmed by a charter dated to [1100] under which the monks of Angers Saint-Aubin recall the history of \"ecclesiam de Comburniaco\", seized by \"Fulcho comes\" [Foulques III \"Nerra\" Comte dAnjou] and given to \"Hamelino de Castro Ledi\", who granted it to \"Widdoni de Valle cum filia sua in maritagio\" . If this report is correct, Rotrude must have married before [1030], the estimated date of death of her father. The monks of Marmoutier record the division of Laval fair and market profits with \"Guido de Valle\", with the consent of \"filii eius Hamon, Hildelinda, Agnes, Hildeburgis et Guido et Gervasius\" by charter dated to [1050], witnessed by \" Rotrudis supradicti Guidonis uxor, Gualterius filius eius \" . These charters confirm Rotrudes first marriage, from which \"Gualterius filius eius\" was presumably born. Guy [I] & his first wife had five children:\n\na)JEAN de Laval (before [1025/26]-). \" Guidonis de Valle filiorumque suorum Johannis et Hamonis\" consented to a donation by \"Fulcodius\" to Marmoutier by charter dated to [1040] .

The monks of Marmoutier record the donations by \"quemdam militem Johannem pagi Cenomannensis indigenum, Widonis de Valle filium\" of property \"in Normannia, territorio Vilcassino ecclesiam in villa Guarniacus juxta fluvium Eptæ\" which \"Wido pater eorum\" accepted from \"uxore sua Berta, Johannis et Haimonis matre\", by charter dated [Sep/14 Oct] 1055, which also records that Jean became a monk at Marmoutier when aged 29 . [1070].\n\nb)HAMON de Laval (-[1076/85], bur Marmoutier). \"Wido\" relinquished rights to the chapter of Le Mans, before leaving for Jerusalem, with the consent of \"Haimo, supra scripti Guidonis filius et uxor eius Hersendis filiique eorum Guido et Hugo\", by charter dated 11 Nov 1039 . \" Guidonis de Valle filiorumque suorum Johannis et Hamonis\" consented to a donation by \"Fulcodius\" to Marmoutier by charter dated to [1040] .

His place of burial is confirmed by the charter dated 1090 which records that \"Guido junior\" succeeded \"in paternum honorem\" on the death of \"Haimonis senioris de Valle Guidonis\" and that when, after some time, \"supradicti domni Guidonis conjugem\" died, he granted further rights to Marmoutier when she was buried \"juxta patrem suum Haimonem\" .

The date of this charter is open to doubt. The brothers Guy [II] and Hugues are recorded well into the 12th century and two of the known children of Guy [II] must have been born in the last decade of the 11th century. If the date of the charter is correct, both Guy [II] and Hugues would have been unusually old when they died.

The naming of \"Guido et Gervasius\" in this last charter after their sisters suggests that they were not born from the same marriage of their father.\n\n1.HUGUES [II] de Laval (-before 1130) . The chronology suggests that there must have been two persons named Hugues de Laval in the late-11th and early 12th centuries. Hugues de Laval (named Hugues [I] de Laval, above), son of Hamon Seigneur de Laval, is named in a charter dated 11 Nov 1039. It is therefore extremely unlikely that he could have been the same person as Hugues [II] de Laval whose death is dated to before 1130. It is possible that Hugues [II] was the son of Hugues [I]. An undated charter, dated to the early 12th century, under which the nuns of Ronceray confirmed an agreement, is witnessed by \"Hugues de Laval, qui nunc dominium tenebat\" , which suggests that Hugues acted as regent during the minority of Guy [III] Seigneur de Laval. \"Juhellus Goualterii filius, dominus castelli Meduanæ matre mea Adelina et sorore Felicia\" organised the transfer of the monks of Saint-Martin to Mayenne castle, for the souls of \"Gaufredi avi mei et Gualterii patris mei Hamelini fratris mei\", by undated charter witnessed by \" milites ex parte Juhelli: Hugo de Lavalle \" . This charter is dated to 1144 in the compilation, although the date does not appear in the text. It is more likely dateable to the early 1120s. \"Hugo de la Val\" confirmed the donation by \"Robertus de Laceio tempore regis Willilmi secundi\" and added his own donation to Pontefract abbey, for the salvation of \"conjugis meæ et liberorum meorum\", by charter dated to [1121/29] . According to Dugdales Monasticon, Henry I King of England granted Pontefract castle to \"Hugo de la Val\" after Robert de Lacy was banished, and \"Empress\" Matilda restored the castle to Roberts son, so dated to the early 1140s . If Robert de Lacys death is correctly estimated to [1093/99] (see UNTITLED ENGLISH NOBILITY), his banishment must have occurred during the reign of King William II. The timing of King Henry Is granted to Hugues de Laval is therefore uncertain. m as her first husband, DAMETA, daughter of --- (-after 1130). The 1130 Pipe Roll names \"Wido de Laval\" followed immediately by \"Willo Maltverso\" in Northumberland, and in another passage records that \"Wills Maltvers\" owed money to the king for \"uxore Hug de Laval\" and for the latters land . The 1130 Pipe Roll names \"Damete\" in Oxfordshire . She married secondly (1129) William Maltravers. \"Willelmus Maltravers\" donated property to Pontefract abbey, with the consent of \"uxore mea Dalmeta\", by charter dated to [1130/36] . Hugues & his wife had [two or more] children:\n\n- ENGLISH UNTITLED NOBILITY - LAVAL.\n\nGUY [II] de Laval, son of HAMON Seigneur de Laval & his wife Hersende --- (before [1037/38]-after 1105, bur Marmoutier) . \"Wido\" relinquished rights to the chapter of Le Mans, before leaving for Jerusalem, with the consent of \"Haimo, supra scripti Guidonis filius et uxor eius Hersendis filiique eorum Guido et Hugo\", by charter dated 11 Nov 1039 . The date of this charter is open to doubt. The brothers Guy [II] and Hugues are recorded well into the 12th century and two of the known children of Guy [II] must have been born in the last decade of the 11th century. If the date of the charter is correct, both Guy [II] and Hugues would have been unusually old when they died. \"Hamon de Laval\" donated property to Ronceray, at the request of \"ses surs Agnès et Hildelinde\", for the souls of \"Guy son père et de Berthe sa mère\", with the approval of \"Guy son fils et de Hersende son épouse\", by charter dated to [1075] . He succeeded his father as Seigneur de Laval. An undated charter records that \"Guido de Lavalle\" succeeded to \"honore patris sui Hamonis post mortem eius\" and confirmed his fathers donations to the monastery of La Charité Sainte-Marie dAnjou, with the consent of \"uxor Dionisia Hugone fratre predicti Guidonis \" . \"Guy II et sa mère Hersende\" assented to the donation of property to Ronceray by \"Foulques du Bignon\", by charter dated to [1085] . A charter dated to [1080/90] records that \"Guidone de Valle\" sold \"boscum Monduluet\" to \"domnus Rivallonus monachus\" at Marmoutier, with the consent of \"Hugo frater eius et Dionisia uxor eius\" . A charter dated 1090 records that \"Guido junior\" succeeded \"in paternum honorem\" on the death of \"Haimonis senioris de Valle Guidonis\" and that when, after some time, \"supradicti domni Guidonis conjugem\" died, he granted further rights to Marmoutier when she was buried \"juxta patrem suum Haimonem\" . A charter dated [10/16] Mar 1095 recalls donations to Montmajour by \"Hamo dominus Latævallis\" amd that \"filius eius Guido, succedens patri suo in honorem\" refused to ratify these donations until Pope Urban II arrived \"ad concilium Turonense\" . Pope Urban is recorded in Tours in early Mar 1096 (N.S.) from where he addressed letters dated 4, 14, 20, 21 and 24 Mar 1096 . An undated charter records the lifting of the sentence of excommunication against \"Guy fils de Hamon\", imposed for the fire of the church of Gennes, in the presence among others of Renaud Bishop of Angers [appointed in 1102] . A charter dated to 1 Dec [1104/1111] records that \"Guy de Laval et Hugues son frère\" arbitered an agreement between the abbess of Ronceray and \"Guérin de Saint-Berthvin\" . \"Mauricius dominus castelli Credonum\" was condemned to repair the damage he caused to La Trinité de Vendôme \"uxor eius domna Mathildis\", by charter dated 1105, which names \"Goffridus Vindocinensis abbas consanguineus Mauricii\", and is signed by \"Mauricius dominus Credonis, Robertus frater eius Guido de Lavalle \" . \"Guido et Cecilia uxor eius et filius eorum Guido Gervasiusque alius filius\" donated property to the monastery of La Charité Sainte-Marie dAnjou, with the approval of \"Hugo de Lavalle\", by undated charter witnessed by \" Adelardus de Castro Gunterii, Hugo de Cretone, Hugo de Mathefelone \" . Assuming that the hypothesis concerning Guy [II]s supposed daughter, wife of Raoul [VII] Vicomte du Maine, is correct as shown below, it is probable that Guy [II] died before her marriage. The marriage is recorded as having taken place in 1095 and the bride described as \"sororem Widonis de Valle\", suggesting that her father was deceased at the time. However, the charter itself is undated and it is not clear from the text how much time may have passed between the marriage and the date the charter was written. It is possible, therefore, that her father was alive when she married, but died soon afterwards.\n\n[m firstly ---. No direct evidence has been found of this supposed first marriage of Guy [II]. However, Guys estimated birth date suggests that it is unlikely that Denise de Mortain, whose birth is most likely dated to [1065/70] considering the general chronology of her family, was his first wife.]\n\nm [secondly] ([1085]) DENISE de Mortain, daughter of ROBERT Comte de Mortain & his first wife Mathilde de Montgommery ([1065/70]-1090, bur Marmoutier). Robert of Torigny names \"unum filium Guillermum et tres filias\" as the children of \"Robertus comes Moritonii uterinus frater Willermi regis\", specifying that one unnamed daughter (mentioned second) married \"Guido de Laval\" . An undated charter records that \"Guido de Lavalle\" succeeded to \"honore patris sui Hamonis post mortem eius\" and confirmed his fathers donations to the monastery of La Charité Sainte-Marie dAnjou, with the consent of \"uxor Dionisia Hugone fratre predicti Guidonis \" . A charter dated to [1080/90] records that \"Guidone de Valle\" sold \"boscum Monduluet\" to \"domnus Rivallonus monachus\" at Marmoutier, with the consent of \"Hugo frater eius et Dionisia uxor eius\" . \"Guido de Lavalle\" donated the priory of Parné to the church of Saint-Nicholas d'Angers \"pro salute sua et uxoris sue Dionisie\" by charter dated [1080/90] . A charter dated 1090 records that \"Guido junior\" succeeded \"in paternum honorem\" on the death of \"Haimonis senioris de Valle Guidonis\" and that when, after some time, \"supradicti domni Guidonis conjugem\" died, he granted further rights to Marmoutier when she was buried \"juxta patrem suum Haimonem\" .\n\nm [thirdly] (after 1090) CECILE, daughter of ---. A charter dated to [1093/1110] records that \"Guido filius Hamonis et eius uxor Sicilia, filiusque eius Guido\" donated property to Marmoutier when \"fratrem suum Hugonem\" appeared to be dying, and a later donation by \"Guido filius eius et Secilia uxor illius et Hugo frater illius\" . \"Guido et Cecilia uxor eius et filius eorum Guido Gervasiusque alius filius\" donated property to the monastery of La Charité Sainte-Marie dAnjou, with the approval of \"Hugo de Lavalle\", by undated charter witnessed by \" Adelardus de Castro Gunterii, Hugo de Cretone, Hugo de Mathefelone \" . \"Cécile épouse de Guy\" witnessed the charter dated to [1093/1110] under which the nuns of Ronceray recorded a donation and the judgment of \"Guy\" which enabled them to retain possession .\n\nGuy [II] & his [first/second] wife had [one child]:\n\n1. [daughter . A charter of the monks of Saint-Vincent du Mans dated 24 May 1095 records the donation by \"bonæ memoriæ Huberti vicecomitis filius Radulfus\", adding that this was the year in which he married \"sororem Widonis de Valle\" . In that year Guy [II] is recorded as sire de Laval. However, he would then have been too old to have had a sister of marriageable age, assuming that the 11 Nov 1039 charter in which he is named is correctly dated. It is therefore more likely that the wife of Raoul [VII] Vicomte du Maine was the daughter not sister of Guy [II]. It is also possible that the charter in question was written later than 1095. If that is correct, Guy [III] may by then have been sire de Laval and Raouls wife could have been described as \"sororem Widonis de Valle\" to indicate the current sire de Laval rather than the sire de Laval when she married. If Raouls wife was the daughter of Guy [II], she must have been born from either his first or second marriage. m (1095) RAOUL [VI] Vicomte du Maine, son of HUBERT Vicomte du Maine et de Beaumont & his wife Ermengarde de Nevers (-14 Jan [1120/25], bur Etival).]\n\nGuy [II] & his [third] wife had [four] children:\n\n2.GUY [III] de Laval ([1092/1100]-[1130/42]) . A charter dated to [1093/1110] records that \"Guido filius Hamonis et eius uxor Sicilia, filiusque eius Guido\" donated property to Marmoutier when \"fratrem suum Hugonem\" appeared to be dying, and a later donation by \"Guido filius eius et Secilia uxor illius et Hugo frater illius\" . He succeeded his father as Seigneur de Laval.\n\n- see below.\n\n3.GERVAIS de Laval (-after 1142). \"Guido et Cecilia uxor eius et filius eorum Guido Gervasiusque alius filius\" donated property to the monastery of La Charité Sainte-Marie dAnjou, with the approval of \"Hugo de Lavalle\", by undated charter witnessed by \" Adelardus de Castro Gunterii, Hugo de Cretone, Hugo de Mathefelone \" . A charter dated 1142 confirms the foundation of the priory of Plessis-Milcent by \"Guido de Lavalle\" and completed after his death by \"filius eius Guido\", with the consent of \"matre sua Ama et Gervasio avunculo suo\" .\n\n4.AGNES de Laval (-[after 1140]) . Her parentage and marriage are confirmed by a letter from \"Hildebertus Turonum minister\" to Pope Honorius II, dated [14 Apr] 1129, relating to canonical difficulties relating to the marriage of \"Hugonis de Credone et Agnetis uxoris suæ\" which names \"ipsa Agnes et Guidonem de Lavalle fratrem suum\" . \"Guarino de Credone, Agnete matre eius\" consented to the donation by \"Gualeri de Bona et Aanor uxor eius\" to La Roë, by undated charter . Bodard de la Jacopière identifies the signatories in this charter with Agnes de Laval, first wife of Hugues Seigneur de Craon, and their supposed son Guérin. This raises an interesting question concerning the date of Agness death. If she died before her husbands second marriage, her son could have been no more than five years old at the time, bearing in mind that his father had five children by his second marriage before his death in [1140]. In that case, it is unlikely that Guérin would have been considered old enough to have consented to the donation in this charter. The other possibility is that Huguess first marriage was terminated not by his wifes death but by their separation, insisted on by the church because of the canonical difficulties referred to above. m ([1124], [separated]) HUGUES Seigneur de Craon, son of MAURICE [I] Seigneur de Craon & his wife Tiphaine --- (-[1140]).\n\n5.
