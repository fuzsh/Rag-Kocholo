        "text": "The abbey is north of the village but do not enter the village but rather remain on the D767 which leads from Noyant (south) to Le Lude (north); the abbey is then signposted on your right - if you are travelling north - shortly after passing DenezÃ©-sous-le-Lude. The abbey is on private property and only the chancel now remains, the rest of the buildings having being either demolished or converted into a private house. The abbey is open to visitors from 1st August to 15th September. There are no signs outside so it is not obvious on arrival where the actual entrance is to be found, so it may be better to telephone beforehand to ask for advice. Excellent English is spoken. Contact details may be found here. There is no charge for these individual visits. Parties of 20 to 80 persons may visit at anytime; but prebooking is required; there is a charge here of â¬5 per person. Park on the roadside outside. Ref: 47Â°33.2' N/0Â° 07.8'E This is a magnificent place to visit: the largest monastic complex in western Europe which originally housed five monasteries. There are actually three churches on the site but that shown here is that of le Grand Moutier. Old French for monastery)\n\nThe church houses the painted tuffeau effigies of the English Kings, Henry II, and his son, Richard the Lionheart, Henry's Queen, Eleanor of Aquitaine and the wooden effigy of King John's Queen, Isabella of AngoulÃªme. Why were they buried here? They were not only kings of England but rulers of an extensive area of what is now France: Dukes of Normandy, of Aquitaine, Counts of Anjou, Touraine and Maine and overlords of Brittany, often called the 'Angevin Empire', although this was not a contemporary term, being first used by Kate Norgate in the 19th century. Neither was it an empire and the expression would not have been recognised by those concerned. The kings died in France and the queens died in retirement in the Abbey.\n\nThe church has been extensively excavated but no trace of coffins or remains have been found. However the effigies, which have moved around over the years, are now thought to rest where the burials took place, at the eastermost part of the nave. Henry and Eleanor's daughter, Joanne, who died in childbirth, is also buried in the Abbey but no monument has been found. Her son, Raymond VII of Toulouse was also buried hereand an effigy thought to be his was excavated several years ago; however this is not yet on display in the Abbey. A wall painting, nearly complete, said to be that of Raymond, remains on a pillar of the crossing. Several other sculptures have also been excavated but whether these represent funerary monuments is not known. On display in the visitors' centre is the effigial head only (the rest of the monument having been lost) of the founder of the Abbey, Robert d'Arbrissel, but this is not contemporary.\n\nThe complex is no longer a working abbey nor a prison into which it was converted by Napoleon: it is run by the French state as a cultural centre and may be visited..\n\nThe photographs flanking the title show 1. The west end and entrance to the Abbey Church, 2. The east end of the Abbey Church, 3. The interior of the church looking east where the effigies can be just seen in the centre, and 4. The main cloister. This pre-revolutionary collection of drawings of the Fontevraud effigies, executed before 1700 - and about 100 years before the Stothard etchings - shows them in a relatively undamaged stage; particularly showing that Eleanor is still holding her book which had broken away with most of both her hands by the time Stothard visited Fontevraud.\n\nIn neither of these collections is Henry or Richard shown holding a scepter. If you visit the monuments today you will find that Henry is doing just that while Richard is not. It is quite possible that Henry did hold a scepter from the position of his hands and the fact that royal effigies usually did so. Richard does not hold a scepter today although one was added for a while and can be seen in early photographs of his effigy. The position of his hands makes it unlikely that he is holding a scepter in the manner of his father. The royal effigies in Saint-Denis are represented as holding a scepter with one hand only - as is Richard's effigy at Rouen - and often resting it on the shoulder with the other hand holding a garment; perhaps this was the case here.\n\nBecause the effigies of Henry and Richard are of similar appearance - note the relatively low relief and the folds of the garments - it is thought that they were both constructed around same time, probably on the orders of Eleanor; this would date them to the first years of the 13th century. That of Eleanor was constructed later - note the higher relief and the more realistic carving of the drapery folds - most likely later in the same century. That of Isabelle presents a problem: it is smaller and made of wallnut. Isabelle died at Fontevraud in 1246 and was originally buried in the nuns' cemetery. Her son King Henry III visited Fontevraud (Gascony was still in English hands) and ordered that his mother's remains be transferred to the church and a monument made. Perhaps the wooden effigy was carved at this time so that Henry III could see it, there being no stone carver nor sufficiently large stone block on site at that time. Perhaps this was a prototype and it was intended that a tuffeau effigy would be constructed later. This, however, is speculation as I have found no relevant references.\n\nIt is generally agreed that the tuffeau female effigy is that of Eleanor and the the two male effigies are those of Henry and Richard. But which is Henry and which is Richard? They are traditionally ascribed as above but foremost Plantagenet expert Professor John Gillingham expresses uncertainty. The authorities at the Abbey tell me that they have evidence for the identification but they have never presented it to me.\n\nThe late art historian Professor George Zarnecki stated that the wooden effigy cannot be that of Isabelle as she died more than forty years after the others and that the effigy was constructed at the same time as that of Eleanor. I believe that he bases the latter assertion on the fact that the design is similar to that of Eleanor's and that an effigy of a different style would have been constructed forty years later. This seems to me to be faulty reasoning as there is nothing to stop a later effigy being constructed in an earlier style, which is only forty years earlier anyway. Furthermore he does not indicate whom the effigy might possibly represent. The fact that the effigy is made of wood also contradicts his statement, which I think can be totally rejected.\n\nRobert d'Arbrissle did not die at Fontevraud but at another of his foundations, the Priory of Our Lady of Orsan at Maisonnais, Berry in 1116. The nuns and monks of Fontevraud who has arrived at Orsan a few days before Robert's death, carried his body back to their abbey and deposited them in the cloister for safe keeping. However a deputation arrived from Berry and carried the body by force back to Orsan and ordered a sarcophagus, totally ignoring Robert's last wishes to be buried in the mud of Fontevraud. The Abbess of Fontevraud, Petronille de ChamillÃ©, resisted, calling on the Pope, God and threatening a hunger strike of the community. Finally, after many negotiations, it was decided that his heart was to remain at Orsan while his unembalmed body was to be returned to Fontevraud.\n\nAbbess Petronille de ChemillÃ©, following the founder's wishes, did not particularly favour the veneration of Robert and by burying him in the choir of the abbey church, it was not possible for the public to visit his tomb. (see above) She did, however, submit papers to the then pope, Calixtus II, during his visit to Fontevraud in the summer of 1119, in an attempt to effect his canonization although this was in vain.\n\nIn 1621 Abbess Louise de Bourbon, one of the few abbesses who wished to maintain the cult of Robert, organized the construction of a memorial to his memory (see above). This necessitated opening of the original tomb and the bones found therein were enclosed in a lead casket and placed in the new tomb to which the public still did not have access. (right) She also submitted papers to the then pope, Clement IX, in a further attempt at Robert's canonization but this came to nothing following the death of both the Pope and the Abbess shortly afterwards."
