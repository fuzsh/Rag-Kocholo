        "text": "Origins of Angers Castle\n\nAngers Castle stands as a remarkable testament to feudal architecture, embodying the grandeur of its era. Constructed between 1228 and 1238 under the auspices of King Louis IX, it was erected upon the ancient foundations of a 9th-century stronghold.\n\nOriginally boasting 17 towers, each soaring to a height of 40 meters and adorned with distinctive pepper-pot roofs, the castle underwent alterations during the tumultuous Wars of Religion in the 16th century. These towers were deliberately reduced in height to afford defenders a clearer vantage point, a strategic adaptation during times of conflict.\n\nAt the same time, the fortress’s walkway was erected, facilitating movement and defense along the ramparts. The north tower’s terrace became home to a windmill, hence its designation as the Tour du Moulin.\n\nToday, visitors to the castle are treated to sweeping vistas of the cityscape and the picturesque valley below from atop the ramparts.\n\nThe eastern section has been transformed into a medieval garden, adding a touch of historical charm to the castle grounds.\n\nThe moats, initially excavated in 1485, have since been filled, giving way to meticulously manicured formal gardens that enhance the castle’s medieval allure.\n\nAll that is left of Angers Castle\n\nAngers Castle bears the scars of history, particularly from the ravages of World War II, which left much of its grandeur in ruins.\n\nHowever, amidst the remnants lie enduring vestiges of its former glory, including the Logis Royal, Galerie du Roi René, chapel, Great Hall of ceremonies, Logis du Gouverneur, and the Châtelet (gatehouse).\n\nThe castle’s enclosure was once divided into two distinct sections: the upper courtyard, or Cour Seigneuriale, housing structures such as the Logis Royal, Galerie du Roi René, and chapel, along with ancillary buildings like staff quarters and kitchens; while the lower courtyard accommodated the garrison.\n\nThe Great Hall, or Grande Salle, once the epitome of regal power, has weathered centuries of change. Originally constructed in the 9th century and expanded to an impressive 500m² in the 11th century, its grandeur now survives in remnants—a facade, a monumental fireplace, and the enduring 12th-century entrance.\n\nThe Chapelle St. Laud, serving the castle until the 14th century, was superseded by the current chapel commissioned by Yolande of Aragon. Though only its foundational traces remain, discovered during the construction of the Apocalypse Gallery in 1953, its legacy endures.\n\nA fragment of the Logis Royal, erected in 1410 by Louis I d’Anjou, still stands adjacent to the present chapel, a silent testament to bygone splendor.\n\nThe current chapel, commissioned by Yolande of Aragon in the early 15th century and dedicated to St. John the Baptist, embodies the exquisite Gothic Angevin architecture. Adorned with the heraldry of Yolande of Aragon and Louis II, its single rectangular nave and vaulted bays evoke a sense of timeless reverence.\n\nGalerie du Roi René, constructed between 1435 and 1453, stands as a masterpiece of architectural finesse. Its facade, marked by four gables and buttresses, encases a regal interior boasting a majestic staircase and fireplace, adorned with the emblems of the House of Anjou and the Cross of Lorraine,of Lorraine—a symbol steeped in the castle’s storied past. Legend holds that the Dukes of Anjou returned from the Crusades bearing a fragment of the Cross, entrusting it to the monks of a neighboring monastery. King René, journeying to eastern France to wed Isabelle de Lorraine, carried this relic, initially dubbed the Cross of Anjou. Following his victory over Charles the Bold at the Battle of Nancy, it acquired the moniker Cross of Lorraine.\n\nThe Logis du Gouverneur, comprising two 18th-century wings flanking a late 15th-century tower staircase, exudes an air of dignified elegance amidst the castle’s precincts.\n\nRené of Anjou’s fortified gatehouse, the Châtelet, erected in 1456, stands as a formidable sentinel. With its asymmetrical silhouette, buttressed walls, and pepper-pot-crowned towers, it commands respect as a bastion of medieval fortification.\n\nFinally, the Galerie de l’Apocalypse erected on the footprint of erstwhile kitchens, staff quarters, and Chapelle St. Laud, offering visitors a glimpse into its rich tapestry of history .\n\nCounts of Anjou, one of the great feudal dynasties\n\nThe formation of the great feudal dynasties traces back to the establishment of the Kingdom of France by Frankish king Clovis. Initially, the king rewarded loyal vassals with extensive territories in exchange for unwavering allegiance. Yet, over time, these vassals grew in power to the extent that their territories evolved into distinct feudal domains.\n\nThe incursions of the Normans in the 9th century spurred these vassals to seek permission from King Charles the Bald to construct their own fortifications, further solidifying their autonomy.\n\nRecognizing their own strength, these vassals then demanded the right to pass on their titles and lands to their descendants, withholding allegiance to the King of France until their demands were met.\n\nIn a strategic move, Charles the Bald conceded to their demands, leveraging their financial and military support against the Normans. The result was a fragmented France, characterized by numerous independent kingdoms and principalities.\n\nDespite their newfound autonomy, the great vassals remained embroiled in perpetual territorial conflicts amongst themselves, perpetuating a state of internal strife within the realm.\n\nAngers Castle – Dynasty of the Counts of Anjou\n\nFulk the Red, Viscount and Count of Anjou, established the inaugural Anjou dynasty in 898, residing within the walls of Angers Castle. This title was passed down through successive generations.\n\nHis son, Fulk II the Good, expanded his domain by acquiring Maine.\n\nFulk III (987-1040), renowned as Fulk Nerra due to his complexion, left an indelible mark on French history. An ambitious and cunning statesman, as well as a formidable warrior, he ruthlessly annexed territories including Blois, Touraine, and Saintonge.\n\nGeoffrey Martel, Fulk Nerra’s son, secured the County of Tours and reconquered Maine before his demise, leaving the succession contested among his nephews, resulting in territorial losses to the French monarchy.\n\nFulk IV saw further territorial setbacks, losing Maine, Saintonge, and Gâtinais.\n\nFulk V the Younger (1109-1131) adeptly exploited French-English rivalry, cementing alliances through strategic marriages. He personally acquired Maine and arranged marital unions with both the French and English monarchs.\n\nGeoffrey V (1131-1151), dubbed Plantagenêt for his distinctive headdress, laid the foundation for the Plantagenêt dynasty, reigning over Anjou, Maine, and Touraine. His descendants, kings of England from Henry II to Richard III, carried on this name.\n\nIn 1152, Henry Plantagenêt wed Eleanor of Aquitaine, inheriting vast territories including Aquitaine and Toulouse. Ascending to the English throne as Henry II, their combined holdings overshadowed the Kingdom of France, sparking conflict with Louis VII.\n\nHis descendants, the kings of England from Henry II (1154) until Richard III (1485) bore this name!\n\nAnjou and Touraine remained pivotal in the ongoing territorial strife between the Plantagenêts and the Capets (French kings) until Philip II seized control.\n\nFollowing Philip II’s death in 1223, English-backed rebellion saw Anjou briefly fall into English hands.\n\nIn response, the Regent Blanche of Castile and her son Louis (future Louis IX) fortified Angers Castle during a period of respite in hostilities.\n\nAngers Castle – Dynasty of the Dukes of Anjou\n\nIn 1346, Louis IX reclaimed Anjou and bestowed Angers Castle upon his younger brother, Charles of Anjou. By 1360, Anjou had risen to the status of a Duchy.\n\nDuring the Crusades, the Dukes of Anjou expanded their dominion, acquiring territories including Provence, Sicily, Naples, Albania, and even Jerusalem, leaving an indelible mark on French history.\n\nCharles I erected numerous castles throughout the valley.\n\nLouis I commissioned the famed Apocalypse Tapestry, now showcased in a dedicated chamber within Angers Castle.\n\nKing René, the son of Louis II and the final Duke of Anjou, was born at Angers Castle. Renowned for his multifaceted talents as an artist, poet, musician, and mathematician, he emerged as one of the most cultured minds of his era. His legacy endures through the ages, marked by his profound impact on the region.\n\nA master of communication, King René fostered a deep connection with his subjects, organizing elaborate festivities and reviving the traditions of chivalry. His botanical interests led to the introduction of the renowned Rose of Provins and the carnation, establishing Anjou as a hub for rose cultivation. King René enjoyed a blissful marriage with Isabelle de Lorraine for 33 years before her death. He later remarried Jeanne de Laval, finding happiness once again. Despite the annexation of Anjou by Louis XI, King René embraced his fate philosophically, retiring to his County of Toulouse, where he passed away at the age of 72.\n\nDepartment of Maine-et-Loire\n\nCoordinates Angers Castle: Lat 47.470000 – Long -0.560000"
