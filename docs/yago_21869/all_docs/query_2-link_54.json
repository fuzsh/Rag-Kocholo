        "text": "René of Anjou (1409–80) was a major figure in the French royal family in the fifteenth century. He inherited some of his titles and lands from his brother Louis III, held previously by his father Louis II and grandfather Louis I (the second son of John II, King of France). But marriage and politics had also increased the wealth and power of the Angevins, adding to the Dukedom of Anjou the Dukedoms of Lorraine and of Bar, the County of Provence, the Kingdoms of Sicily and of Naples, and the title of King of Jerusalem. In the later phases of the Anglo-French conflicts of the fifteenth century René initially supported the Anglo-Burgundian alliance, but later (by 16 July 1429) he transferred his allegiance to the French crown. Captured by the Burgundians at the Battle of Bulgneville on 2 July 1431, he was held prisoner at Dijon until 1437. He was granted provisional liberty between 1432 and 1434, and again in 1435, and was finally released in 1437 after payment of a large ransom.\n\n1 This work has been taken from my dissertation, ‘The Foundation and Early History of the Chapel of René, Duke of Anjou (c1440-c1460)', submitted in part fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Music (Historical Musicology), Royal Holloway and Bedford New College, University of London, September 1990. I would like to thank Dr Andrew Wathey for his support and suggestions both during the work towards my MMus and during the preparation of this work. Dr David Fallows of Manchester University and Dr Mike Routledge of Royal Holloway and Bedford New College both read the text and made valuable suggestions for which I am grateful. I would also like to thank Frazer-Nash NDT Limited of Radcliffe, Manchester for financial support during the period of study towards this work.Google Scholar\n\n38 This amount does not agree with the initial amount in the entry of 1237 florins. As this initial amount is written over an erasion it is probable that this second amount was the original figure entered and that only the initial amount was corrected.Google Scholar\n\n44 Several of the names in this entry are difficult to read and it has proved impossible to trace them in the published accounts. I have therefore transcribed the letters that can be read and have made no attempt to extend the names.Google Scholar"
