Monty Python funnyman John Cleese has tied the knot for a fourth time.

The 72 year old married jewellery designer Jennifer Wade, who’s 41, on the island of Mustique.

Cleese has previously been married to three American women, including Connie Booth – who he co-wrote the hit sitcom Fawlty Towers with.
