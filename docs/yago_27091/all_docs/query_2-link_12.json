        "text": "John Cleese has aimed a thinly-veiled dig at his exes while praising his current wife.\n\nIn an interview with My Weekly, the Fawlty Towers funnyman said his wife, Jennifer Wade, 52, a jewellery designer who previously worked as a model, is a \"wonderfully playful woman.\"\n\nCleese, who is famed for his work on the Monty Python films, said it \"changes you\" when you \"have someone who really loves you.\" The comedian, who married Wade in 2012, added: \"I haven't had that experience before.\"\n\nThe 84-year-old has been vocal about his three former marriages in the past, with reports he spent £25milllion on his divorce settlements.\n\nHe has also jokingly said his ex-wives \"cause most of the misery in the world\".\n\nIn a 2016 interview on the Conan O'Brien show in the US, he said: \"I have been married for 34 years. To four different wives.\" And, referring to his second wife, Barbara Threntham, followed up by saying:\"One of my ex-wives died. You know what? It was very sad because it was the wrong one.\"\n\nIn a recent interview, the comic revealed that his divorce from Alyce Faye Eichelberger, 79, in 2008, led to a $20million (£16million) payout.\n\nCleese said that when he met her, he had a \"beautiful house in Holland Park\" but when they broke up, he \"had a flat in Sloane Square.\"\n\nThey were married in 1992, two years after he split with his second wife, Barbara Trentham, who he'd been with for 10 years. He was married to his first wife, Connie Booth, from 1968 to 1978.\n\nNever one to shy away from controversy, Cleese previously launched a 10-part show for GB News, The Dinosaur Hour, in which he wanted to \"discuss woke issues\" with \"the unfashionable and out-of-touch.\"\n\nSome of the guests were set to include Stephen Fry, Caitlin Jenner, and Trevor McDonald."
