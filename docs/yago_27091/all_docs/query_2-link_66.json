        "text": "When John Cleese brought his one-man show to Sydney last year, we all had a good laugh at its subtitle: The Alimony Tour. Sure, the British national treasure famously had a fair amount to pay his third ex-wife, Alyce Eichelberger, but for a man who had been so regularly successful since his troupe Monty Python reinvented comedy in the 1960s, surely that was a drop in the ocean?\n\nMore recently, the surviving Pythons - Cleese, Eric Idle, Michael Palin, Terry Gilliam and Terry Jones (Graham Chapman died in 1989) - announced their reunion for a handful of London arena shows, again joking about mortgages and divorce settlements.\n\n\"People always think that people like us are sort of sitting there, surrounded by our wealth and sort of making lofty choices about which film we'll turn down,\" Cleese says from his London home in those distinctive, slightly posh tones. \"It's not really like that.\n\n\"I will have paid my ex-wife, I think it is $23 or $24 million. That's an awful lot of money. And when you have to pay it over a period of seven years, even if you sell a lot of properties - like I had five and I now have one - there's still a lot of simple, hard work to be done just to earn the rest of it.\n\n\"There's a choice, which is that you stop working and live on your royalties. But if that was the case then my ex-wife would get a third of those and I wouldn't have enough money to support my children and my wife in a way that I would like to support them - so that obligates me to earn all of the money that's been awarded by the courts.\"\n\nIt is why Cleese, at 74, seems to be working harder than ever. The day we speak, he has spent much of the day in a recording studio, first voicing ''an animated alien'' for Python buddy Jones' feature Absolutely Anything, then working on two characters for a new US animated TV series.\n\nHe is now in Australia, where he will be until April, working on his autobiography (''I've set myself a target of 40,000 words'') either side of dates for his latest tour, An Evening with John Cleese, as well as appearing in Australian director Josh Whiteman's Wedding of the Year alongside Colin Friels and Deborah Mailman.\n\nThe autobiography will be quite an undertaking, given Cleese last year celebrated 50 years in show business. His career started straight out of Cambridge University in 1963 as one of the writers and stars of a stage revue titled A Clump of Plinths, which went on to play in London's West End after being renamed Cambridge Circus and then toured the world. He then scored work writing for the BBC, which would lead to the extraordinarily influential Monty Python's Flying Circus.\n\nIf Cleese's participation in that show wasn't enough of a career achievement, in the 1970s he went on to co-write and star in Fawlty Towers, one of the most beloved television sitcoms of all time, and in the 1980s to conquer the international cinema box office with A Fish Called Wanda. More recently, he has appeared in the Harry Potter, Shrek and Pierce Brosnan-era James Bond franchises.\n\nBack in the present, though, what has everyone excited of late is July's sold-out-in-seconds series of Monty Python shows. Well, almost everyone. ''I don't think that we're particularly excited but we're just very pleased,'' Cleese says. ''It just should be fun to get out there in front of 16,000 people, 14,000 of whom know the script better than we do.\n\n''I think that what we're going to do is present something that's not really a theatrical entertainment because it's more of a festival, a celebration or something like that. That means we can play all sorts of in-jokes on the audience.\n\n''It's going to be a very steep learning curve because when 16,000 people laugh, well, I don't know what that sounds like. I don't know how slow the show'll have to be in order to allow the laughter. But, you know, it's a new experience and at my age that's what's interesting.''\n\nWhat I realised years ago, is that the hardest thing in comedy is to really make people laugh\n\nIt is unlikely the Python reunion will make it Down Under any time soon - ''because Michael Palin's got an impossible work schedule for about three years … I'm not joking'' - so for now we can make do with Cleese's solo show, which he says he enjoys ''surprisingly much, considering I don't normally like to say the same thing every night''.\n\n''All I do is I just sit there and I talk to the audience. Bit of narrative, a few good stories, a few jokes and then show them clips and tell them a little bit of the inside story about the clips and people seem to like that. It's a very simple form of entertainment.''\n\nHe says he has no insight into the longevity of the gags he helped create. ''There's something about Python that just seems to go on and on, winning converts. It's something to do with an attitude to life, just not taking it very seriously, I think, which is infectious. But it's kind of a mystery to me. All I know is that Fawlty Towers has not dated yet and neither has Python for some extraordinary reason and A Fish Called Wanda still feels pretty fresh. But the other movies I do feel are terribly dated now, like a thing I did called Privates on Parade [1983] - that just feels as though it was made about 50 years ago.''\n\nAs a famously well-educated group - all the Python members except New Yorker Gilliam studied at Oxford or Cambridge - did they ever theorise over what is funny?\n\n''I can't remember ever sitting with those guys and having a discussion about it. At the same time, it doesn't mean that I'm not interested in it … What I realised years ago, is that the hardest thing in comedy is to really make people laugh. It's much, much easier to do clever comedy. Really making an audience roar with laughter is very difficult and very few people can do it. That's what I've always tried to do.''\n\nIt is what he will continue to do on his Australian tour - especially if audiences give him something interesting to chew on during the Q&A session at the end of each show. ''I'd like to encourage them, this time, to be a little more mean-spirited with their questions,'' Cleese says. ''When people say, 'Why do you always play this kind of part?' or 'Why have you been married so many times?' that's more fun than when people say, 'What's your favourite sketch?'\n\n''When I was [touring] in South Africa, I got much stroppier questions. Somebody once said to me, 'Mr Cleese, do you hate your ex-wife?' I thought that was great!''\n\nWhat was the answer? ''My answer was, 'I don't hate her, I just wish she was dead,' ha ha ha! Not that I have anything against her, but it would be awfully nice if I didn't have to pay her the last million and a half, you know?''\n\nAn Evening with John Cleese, at the Concourse, Chatswood, April 8-12."
