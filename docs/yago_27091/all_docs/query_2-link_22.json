        "text": "John Cleese is very tall. All 6ft 4in of him looms up in the basement of a central London bookshop. Basil Fawlty is suddenly standing before me. So, too, is the neurotic headmaster in Clockwise, the Russian-speaking Englishman in A Fish Called Wanda and, arguably, the most famous Python of all. Cleese is a giant that juts out of the British comedy landscape. And now he's reaching out to shake my hand.\n\nCleese is about to turn 75. His moustache is, of course, greyer than when it was raised in exclamation at Manuel's mishaps in Fawlty Towers in the mid-Seventies. He is older, and stouter by far, than he was when he challenged Kevin Kline for Jamie Lee Curtis's affections in the BAFTA-winning Wanda of 1988. But he is still unmistakably Cleese.\n\nIt's been a busy year with the 10 Monty Python Live (Mostly) reunion events at London's O2 Arena in July (the first night sold out in 43.5 seconds) and the publication this month of his autobiography. The Pythons' regrouping made international news but, despite being well attended, won mixed reviews. \"I took great pleasure but the funny thing was there was no buzz of adrenalin,\" he says. \"I was just thinking, 'How nice this is, what fun it is - 16,000 people there!' I think it's because performing has never been my first love.\"\n\nInstead, it's always been writing. He used a yellow pencil to write with and read the lines out loud to himself. \"I think I use language very simply and I sometimes choose good words,\" he says. Some he dictated to his fourth wife, Jennifer, 42. Tall and blonde, she is the British jewellery designer he married in 2012.\n\nYou may catch Cleese speaking at future events - \"I learn so much from doing that\" - but he's unlikely to return to the stage. He admits to being a perfectionist, \"but it used to be much more harmful than it is now\". The perfectionism comes from the fear of making a mistake. \"People are frightened of making mistakes, of looking foolish. Mistakes are very interesting, and a lot of the time they lead to things.\"\n\nJohn Marwood Cleese was born in 1939 to Reg, an insurance salesman, and his wife Muriel in Weston-super-Mare. After prep school he won a scholarship to Clifton College, a public school in Bristol. With A-levels in maths, physics and chemistry, he went on to study law at Cambridge, where he met his future Pythons writing partner, Graham Chapman, and joined the famous Footlights.\n\nAt school, Cleese played a lot of sport. He was tall at a young age and remembers simply having to extend his arm to keep rival boxers at bay. When he demonstrates, by extending a long limb, it's immediately hilarious. He was, at one point, \"really quite good\" at cricket. \"If I could have played soccer for Bristol City and cricket for Somerset, I really would have died a happy man at the age of 36.\"\n\nHis physicality proved useful in the often energetic scenes in Fawlty Towers. \"I was good at that kind of comedy because I had good co-ordination.\" Later, when he was filming Clockwise in 1985, his knee collapsed. \"I went from a games player to someone who couldn't play games overnight, literally, and it was the biggest single change in my life.\"\n\nCleese experienced contrasting relationships with his parents. He accepts that his mother gave him stability, but has difficult memories of their relationship. \"By the time she died at 101, I was very, very glad she'd lived so long because I had resolved my issues with her. But when somebody said to me in my twenties that their best friend was their mother, I remember just thinking how wonderful that would be.\"\n\nBoth he and his father \"walked on eggshells\" because they never knew what was going to set her off. \"She was afraid of everything. She was always looking for the next thing that had to be negotiated, she could never relax and enjoy a moment - unless she was in company, when a very attractive side came out because she could be humorous and quite witty and good fun. But the moment the company went away she would relapse into a kind of anxious and depressed state.\"\n\nReginald, on the other hand, who changed his name from Cheese to Cleese to avoid being teased when he enlisted during the First World War, was a happier presence. \"My relationship with him was enormously strong. He really did the emotional mothering that I was not getting from my mother and we were very, very close. But as I got older - 19, 20, 21 - he seemed to be unwilling to let go of the father-child relationship. He would sit there giving me lots of advice, often about things that I knew more about than he did. But I don't remember his ever being mean to anyone. Whereas mother was completely self-centred in a way that was almost breathtaking.\"\n\nIn his mother's later years, Cleese \"became psychosomatically sick\" when he was around his mother. But, despite this, he was \"extraordinarily dutiful\". Did he love her? \"In the end I sometimes felt affection for her. But the great difficulty was I didn't really respect her.\" His sense of humour does, though, come partly from his mother - \"she had a very black one\".\n\nHis relationship with his mother \"vastly complicated my relationship with women for years. I was 35 before I was properly able to be myself with a woman of my own age. I went to a single-sex prep school, single-sex public school, there were three female students out of 200 in the law lectures at Cambridge. I just didn't know how to talk to them. Add to that there was a sort of unconscious fear that women seemed, because of my mother, to be these unpredictable people who could become very excited or angry about things that you didn't really understand.\"\n\nCleese has married four times. While performing on and off Broadway in New York, he met Connie Booth. They married in 1968 and she would become co-writer and co-star with him in Fawlty Towers. They're still great friends today. Next he wed the American actress Barbara Trentham, in 1981. A decade later he married the American psychotherapist Alyce Faye Eichelberger. They moved to Los Angeles in 1999, but divorced in 2008 and the financial settlement caused him to travel the world with a one-man Alimony Tour. When I ask if he would have done anything differently in his life he says, \"I would not have married Alyce Faye. Quite genuinely. Because that was not a love match. The results were disastrous.\"\n\nCleese has two daughters from his first two marriages; in 1971 Booth gave birth to Cynthia (who would later star as his fictional daughter in Wanda), while Camilla was born to Cleese and Trentham in 1984. \"I received a lot of my emotional nurture from my father and as a result of that I was probably lacking in firmness with my daughters. I was trying to be popular with them when it would have been better sometimes to have drawn a line very firmly.\"\n\nCamilla has spoken publicly about the battle she fought and overcame with cocaine and alcohol. She credits her father with forcing her towards sobriety. For about a year during the mid-2000s Cleese had refused to take Camilla's calls and withdrew his financial support. Then she committed to rehab. \"Now she's in great form,\" he says.\n\nAlthough Basil Fawlty was capable of extreme rage, Cleese himself doesn't enjoy being angry. \"I don't scream at people if there are mistakes. If it's on a film set and people are making the same mistake I can get pretty sarcy about it because it annoys me, but that never happens in England because the crews are so good.\"\n\nWhen I ask what else makes him angry, Cleese goes on a rather disorganised rant against a variety of targets. He begins with the police - \"It's very sad for me to realise that the police seem to be so corrupt\" - and moves on to the BBC, which \"was the greatest television organisation\" but is apparently \"now completely hopeless\". Then he broadens his attack to France and Italy - they're in \"a terrible mess. There is so much of this country now that is badly run and so much of the world that is badly run. The people who run the Republican Party in America are the most cynical, most disgracefully immoral people I've ever come across in a Western civilisation. Their one aim when Barack Obama became President was to deny him any kind of success.\"\n\nAs for Britain, \"All my friends who are lower middle class but quite well educated, we don't know who we would vote for. I would bring back Paddy Ashdown and make him Prime Minister and then I'd put David Attenborough and Bobby Charlton in the Cabinet.\" We both laugh.\n\nBut Cleese becomes serious again when I mention Ukip. \"I think they're enunciating something enormously important, which is that what really makes people happy is having a sense of identity and purpose, and the terrible thing about the European Union is that it is fundamentally a non-democratic organisation. There's a paralysis now with people not feeling that anything they do is going to change anything.\"\n\nWould he consider voting Ukip? \"I don't think so, but I will look very carefully.\" Where does he stand on immigration? \"I'm all for immigration because this has always been a country of immigrants. But when they go to America they put their hand over their heart when they become a citizen and they want to be Americans. If people come here they're most welcome, but when people come here who really don't like our culture, that worries me because I think, 'Well why are they here if they don't like us?'\"\n\nSo what next for Cleese? \"There's a lot of things I want to explore and understand better. Whereas from 65 onwards I probably should have been sitting around reading several hours a day, I had to earn money. So I would like to have those years back, please God.\" He believes in life after death - \"I think there's something going on but I have no idea what it is\" - but is not religious. \"Not in the sense of collective religion, no. I would love to do a series of programmes for television called, 'What religion would be if the churches hadn't f----- it up'.\"\n\nWhat he'd really like, he says, is an OBE. \"I'm talking about an 'out of body experience'\", he clarifies. Why did he turn down a CBE? \"I thought it was silly. I asked them, 'Am I allowed to call myself Commander Cleese?' and they said, 'No, you're not,' and I said, 'Well I don't want it'.\" He's also rejected an offer of a peerage by the Liberal Democrats, but would he turn down a knighthood? \"If Alyce Faye were still alive I'd probably accept it just to annoy her.\"\n\nIs Cleese happy? \"Enormously happy. Because I've finally found true love. Which is a fish and three cats. I call Jenny 'Fish' because of the way she swims. She's the most beautiful swimmer I've ever seen.\n\nHow important is sex? \"What was it Socrates said about his sexual drive? He said, 'I feel that I've been chained to a lunatic all my life and I'm finally free.' So it matters, but not as much as it used to.\"\n\nThe evening of our interview Cleese is due on The Graham Norton Show. He's planning to take along one of his two Maine Coon cats so that it can be filmed in the green room. \"I always seem to find something to do that interests people in case I'm really boring.\" That's one thing John Cleese is certainly not."
