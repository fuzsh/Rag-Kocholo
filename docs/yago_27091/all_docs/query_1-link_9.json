        "text": "Monty Python star John Cleese cuddled up with his fourth wife Jennifer as he attended the opening night of Fawlty Towers: The Play in London. The 84-year-old actor led the red carpet as celebrities attended the live version of the long-running TV show.\n\nThe stage show condenses three episodes of the TV series together. Fawlty Towers is a comedy series that aired over two seasons in 1975 and 1979, with John Cleese starring in both as Basil Fawlty.\n\nJohn cut a very dapper figure as he cosied up with his jewellery designer partner Jennifer, 52. The pair have been married since 2012 and she is John's fourth wife.\n\nThe actor was previously married to Alyce Faye Eichelberge until 2008. The couple went their seperate ways, with Alyce recieving Â£15.5 million in a divorce settlement, and John having a \"nervous breakdown\" as a result.\n\nSpeaking about his \"tsunami of debt\" to The Times, he previously shared: \"The reason I am working so hard is, mainly, the divorce.\n\n\"[The settlement] was $20 million. What I've been doing since then is to try to build a nest egg and it hasn't been easy.\" He also claimed to have had a \"nervous breakdown\" in 2012 and added: \"It just felt that there was this tsunami of debt coming my way.\"\n\nIt is reported that John and Alyce first met in 1990 when they attended a party together in London. At the time, John's second marriage to Barbara Trentham had just ended.\n\nTwo years later, Alyce and John married in a ceremony in Barbados and moved to the United States together. John is now happily married to Jennifer Wade - who is credited for having \"rescued\" the comedian from a \"tidal wave.\"\n\nJohn admitted: \"It was Fish who rescued me,\" as he reportedly calls Jennifer 'Fish' due to her being a keen swimmer.\n\nCleese's adaptation first hit the theatres in Australia in 2016.\n\nIn this version, John does not reprise his role as Basil and is instead replaced by the talented Adam Jackson-Smith.\n\nFawlty Towers: The Play is running until September 28 at the Apollo Theatre in London."
