        "text": "How old is John Cleese?\n\nJohn Cleese was born on October 27, 1939, and he celebrated his 84th birthday in 2023.\n\nHe was born in Weston-super-Mare, Somerset.\n\nHe was the only child of Reginald Francis Cleese, an insurance salesman, and Muriel Evelyn (n√©e Cross), who worked as a housewife.\n\nHis family's surname was originally Cheese, but his father thought it was embarrassing, and instead used the name Cleese when he enlisted in the Army during the First World War. He then changed it officially in 1923.\n\nHow did he get his start in comedy and when did he join Monty Python?\n\nJohn Cleese's journey into comedy began during his time at Cambridge University, where he became involved with the prestigious Cambridge Footlights drama club.\n\nIt was here that he honed his comedic skills and formed friendships with fellow future comedy legends such as Graham Chapman.\n\nAfter graduating, Cleese began his career as a comedy writer and performer, initially finding success at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe and later as a writer and performer on television shows like The Frost Report.\n\nCleese officially joined Monty Python, the groundbreaking comedy troupe, in the late 1960s. Alongside Terry Gilliam, Eric Idle, Terry Jones, Michael Palin, and Graham Chapman, Cleese helped create and starred in the influential sketch show Monty Python's Flying Circus, which aired from 1969 to 1974.\n\nWho is John Cleese's wife and does he have children?\n\nJohn Cleese has been married multiple times. His first wife was Connie Booth, with whom he co-wrote and co-starred in the acclaimed sitcom Fawlty Towers.\n\nCleese and Booth were married from 1968 to 1978 and have one daughter together named Cynthia Cleese, born in 1971.\n\nAfter his divorce from Connie Booth, Cleese was married to Barbara Trentham from 1981 to 1990, and they have one daughter named Camilla Cleese, born in 1984.\n\nFollowing his second divorce, Cleese married Alyce Faye Eichelberger in 1992. The marriage ended in divorce in 2008.\n\nIn 2012, Cleese married his fourth wife, Jennifer Wade."
