And with my record that's a remarkable thing to say.\"\n\nHis new wife is a jewellery designer from Bath. Cleese has previously been married to Connie Booth, Barbara Trentham and Alice Faye Eichelberger who are all from the US.\n\nCleese's divorce from Eichelberger was a famously expensive one, costing him £12 million. He subsequently launched his first solo comedy shows which he named the Alimony Tour.\n\nThe comic and actor, who starred in movies such as A Fish Called Wanda, told Hello!: \"I never felt there was anything wrong with the institution of marriage - it was my ability to choose the right person.\"\n\nHis bride said: \"We're kindred spirits. When people see is together, they immediately get it.\""
