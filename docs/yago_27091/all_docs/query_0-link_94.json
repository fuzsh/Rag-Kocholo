        "text": "The ex-wife of Fawlty Towers star John Cleese claims the actor did not tell her about the shows reboot - despite creating the show with her. The iconic TV sitcom is being revived after more than 40 years.\n\nOnce again, Cleese is set to star as the 83-year-old actor and writer will reprise his role as Basil Fawlty in the new programme. His daughter, Camilla, will star alongside him as the hotelier's recently returned long-lost daughter.\n\nThe new series will explore how the dramatic and cynical Basil navigates the modern world, while running a boutique hotel which was based on the Gleneagles Hotel in Torquay. Castle Rock Entertainment announced it had closed a deal with Cleese to bring back the hit series.\n\nREAD MORE: Fawlty Towers set for revival with John Cleese and his daughter\n\nHowever, Cleese's ex-wife Connie Booth - who played Basil Fawlty's chambermaid Polly in the sitcom - said the new series was a surprise to her. Ms Booth, who was married to the Monty Python comedian for 10 years, told The Times: \"I'd have appreciated learning about the project from John rather than reading about it in the papers.\n\n\"Because a previous American reboot of Fawlty Towers had failed some years ago, I was surprised that another was being planned. I was even more surprised to read that John intends to write and to perform in it together with his daughter Camilla.\"\n\nBut despite being surprised about the new series being devised, Booth still wished her ex-husband and Camilla well.\n\nCleese famously stayed at The Gleneagles while he and the rest of the Monty Python crew were filming in the early 1970s. The rest of the cast quickly moved out because of the rudeness of the hotel owner - but Cleese and Booth reportedly stayed on to observe the \"real\" Basil Fawlty - hotel owner Donald Sinclair.\n\nCleese said Sinclair was \"the rudest man I've ever come across in my life\". The real Basil Fawlty was a retired Naval officer who twice survived the sinking of his ship in World War II.
