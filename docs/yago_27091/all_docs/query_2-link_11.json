        "text": "At 84 years old, John Cleese is not eyeing up retirement any time soon as his divorce left him shortchanged.\n\nThe Fawlty Towers actor blasted his ‘absurd’ divorce settlement in his split from ex-wife Alyce Faye Eichelberger, 79, in 2008.\n\nAfterwards he embarked on his so called Alimony Tour but 16 years on the Monty Python legend is still ‘surprisingly poor’.\n\nIn a new interview he confessed the costly split, which resulted in a payout of $20million (£16million) to the American psychotherapist, still motivates him.\n\nWhen discussing Cleese’s decision to work into his 80s and beyond, he told SagaMagazine there was ‘only one person responsible for that.’\n\nHe said: ‘Can you believe when I met her, I had a beautiful house in Holland Park and no mortgage and when I broke up with her, I had a flat in Sloane Square and a full mortgage? How they figured out she was worth $20m, I have no idea.’\n\nDespite the huge sum, Cleese insists he’s moved on from the anger of the divorce, helped by how ‘absurd’ and ‘ridiculous’ the amount was.\n\nThe pair had married each other in 1992, two years after he divorced second wife of 10 years, Barbara Trentham.\n\nThe Fish Called Wanda actor remarried in 2012 to current wife Jennifer Wade, who he says he transferred his short lease of his flat to.\n\nApparently he doesn’t own a car or property now, despite his net worth being estimated at around £20 million.\n\n‘I’m surprisingly poor, never thought it was necessary to own a great deal,’ Cleese added. ‘The most important thing is to have enough money to have some really good food, buy clothes twice a year and have nice holidays.’\n\nMuch of his wealth came from being a founding member of Monty Python since 1969 with Graham Chapman, Terry Gilliam, Eric Idle, Terry Jones, and Michael Palin.\n\nHe is also leading a revival of the classic BBC comedy, Fawlty Towers in which he starred as rude and eccentric hotelier Basil Fawlty in Torquay.\n\nDespite speculation over a TV series, the reboot is actually hitting the West End, with Cleese’s daughter, Camilla, helping pen the two hour stage show.\n\nControversy struck when ex-wife Connie Booth, 82, claimed she wasn’t told about the project despite helping make the original.\n\nBooth married Cleese in 1968, with the pair welcoming daughter Cynthia together three years later but splitting before the second season of Fawlty was completed.\n\nGot a story?"
