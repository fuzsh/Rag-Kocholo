        "text": "Peter Sarstedt summed up what it was like to be wealthy in 1969‚Ä¶ A Londoner living the high life in Paris\n\n‚ÄúYou talk like Marlene Dietrich\n\nAnd you dance like Zizi Jeanmaire\n\nYour clothes are all made by Balmain\n\nAnd there's diamonds and pearls in your hair, yes, there are\n\nYou live in a fancy apartment\n\nOff the Boulevard St. Michel\n\nWhere you keep your Rolling Stones records\n\nAnd a friend of Sacha Distel, yes, you do\n\nBut where do you go to, my lovely\n\nWhen you're alone in your bed?\n\nTell me the thoughts that surround you\n\nI want to look inside your head, yes, I do\n\nI've seen all your qualifications\n\nYou got from the Sorbonne\n\nAnd the painting you stole from Picasso\n\nYour loveliness goes on and on, yes, it does\n\nWhen you go on your summer vacation\n\nYou go to Juan-les-Pins\n\nWith your carefully designed topless swimsuit\n\nYou get an even suntan on your back, and on your legs\n\nAnd when the snow falls you're found in St. Moritz\n\nWith the others of the jet set\n\nAnd you sip your Napoleon brandy\n\nBut you never get your lips wet, no, you don't\n\nBut where do you go to, my lovely\n\nWhen you're alone in your bed?\n\nWon't you tell me the thoughts that surround you?\n\nI want to look inside your head, yes, I do\n\nYour name it is heard in high places\n\nYou know the Aga Khan\n\nHe sent you a race horse for Christmas\n\nAnd you keep it just for fun, for a laugh, ha-ha-ha\n\nThey say that when you get married\n\nIt'll be to a millionaire\n\nBut they don't realize where you came from\n\nAnd I wonder if they really care, or give a damn\n\nWhere do you go to, my lovely\n\nWhen you're alone in your bed?\n\nTell me the thoughts that surround you\n\nI want to look inside your head, yes, I do\n\nI remember the back streets of Naples\n\nTwo children begging in rags\n\nBoth touched with a burning ambition\n\nTo shake off their lowly-born tags, they tried\n\nSo look into my face, Marie-Claire\n\nAnd remember just who you are\n\nThen go and forget me forever\n\nBut I know you still bear the scar, deep inside, yes, you do\n\nI know where you go to, my lovely\n\nWhen you're alone in your bed\n\nI know the thoughts that surround you\n\n'Cause I can look inside your head‚Äù\n\nLarge houses in leafy suburbs of Dublin.\n\nLived in architect-designed homes (newer money but also some old money).\n\nAll kids sent to private, fee-paying schools where their fellow students were all being channeled toward medicine, law, and stock brokering (boys). Expectation of becoming leading lights in their professions. Serious pressure to perform academically (boys).\n\nSchools: Clongowes, Belvedere, Loreto Stephen's Green, Mount Anville, Ursulines (various locations), Holy Child Killiney, Alexandra College, Catholic University School, St Louis Monaghan...\n\nRugby, hockey (no expectations of fantastic feats of athleticism for the girls).\n\nGirls sent to university (some with academic expectations (medicine, library/ archive studies, languages), some for their M.R.S.\n\nSailing - families had boats, went out often.\n\nRacing - families owned or part owned horses.\n\nHoliday homes in Cork, Kerry or Mayo; long holidays.\n\nOwned private beaches and lots of land around the holiday houses.\n\nFly fishing in private stretches of remote rivers.\n\nHolidays in the south of France, Cyprus, Morocco (for the more boho).\n\nSkiing in France and Switzerland.\n\nFamiliarity with 'exotic' cuisines, knew about wine, bought wine from a merchant, not an off license.\n\nHad studied or worked in the US, in many cases, and taste was influenced by 50s and 60s California (newer money).\n\nOld money - interested in architecture and conservation (swimming against the tide in 60s Dublin).\n\nLots of antique furniture, Persian rugs, portraits of ancestors, original art collections, old Waterford glass, silver. Biedermeier couches, Ming vases, etc.\n\nNewer money - post-war Scandi style furnishings and more avant garde taste in decor.\n\nBooks, books, books, books...\n\nDrove Saabs, Volvo station wagons, Mercedes, Jaguars, MGs, Triumphs, VW convertibles, Peugeot station wagons... Fun cars in general, and they had IRL stickers on the bumpers because they drove on 'the Continent'.\n\nMixed with certain 'sets' - old boys/ girls networks very strong.\n\nMembers of tennis clubs and golf clubs.\n\nClothes and shoes very sensible, long lasting, and expensive. Older generations never followed fashion, but younger generations born in the 60s and 70s very early adopters of American styles (denim jeans, frisbee-playing, etc).\n\nDo you mean the equivalent of ¬£500k today or actually ¬£500k? ¬£500k in 1970 was over ¬£6m in today‚Äôs money.\n\nI grew up fairly rich in the 80s (though more like ¬£500k now than ¬£6m!!) . Private school, ponies etc. Dogs, big 4wd cars. We went on holiday every year but not lots of holidays, and holidays might be eg a month in Scotland rather than two weeks AI in the Seychelles. I don‚Äôt think much would have been different 10 years earlier.. Think of the scene when John Cleese goes home to his family in the country in A Fish Called Wanda (I‚Äôm nothing like that daughter although my mum is a bit like that wife üòÇ) We didnt have a house in London but lots of my friends did and generally the wife and kids lived the country, the husband lived in London in the week and the country at weekends.\n\nGoing back, I suspect that would have been more normal including the cost of having a few staff at each house- and not like these days when a second home is often a holiday home you can Airbnb but two permanent establishments with wife and kids mainly in the country. Multiple children at boarding school. That‚Äôs just imagining one way of being fairly rich though- very middle class, banker or similar. I‚Äôm sure Liz Taylor was doing more exciting things with her money.\n\nRead something like the Cazalets to give you an idea of life for a wealthy (but not super-rich) upper middle class family in the 1940s."
