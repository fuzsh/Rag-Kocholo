        "text": "When it comes to his three divorces, John Cleese has never minced his words – even admitting he’s had to keep touring his comedy shows to pay for his exorbitant alimony.\n\nBut in a new interview on US chat show Conan O’Brien to promote his latest show Together Again at Last… For the First Time, the 77-year-old has taken it one step further saying that he wishes his ex-wives were dead and that he never had kids.\n\nWATCH: John’s bold interview in the player above.\n\n“I have been married for 34 years. To four different wives,” the famed funnyman explained to the host, before referencing the death of his second wife, Barbara Threntham, who passed away in 2013 from leukemia.\n\n“One of my ex-wives died. You know what? It was very sad because it was the wrong one,” the Monty Python star shockingly confessed.\n\n“Do you have any real anger or hatred towards your ex-wives?” Conan questioned.\n\n“No, I mean, I am quite happy if one or two of them would be dead. But I don’t have anything against them as people.”\n\n“I wish them dead in the nicest possible way. Not dead in a slow agonising death over a number of years. Something quick like a tree falling on them,” John added.\n\nThe actor is currently married to his fourth wife, 36-year-old Jennifer Wade and was previously wed to Connie Booth from 1968-1978, followed by Barbara Trentham from 1981-1990 and his third wife Alyce Cleese from 1992-2008.\n\nJohn’s divisive comments didn’t end there as he went on to reveal his regret in having children.\n\n“I think the secret is not to have children. Children are the cause of most of the misery in the world. They cost you a fortune, you worry yourself sick and then they grow up like their mothers. Cats are the answer. You can feed them twice a day,” the father-of-two explained.\n\nJohn has two daughters from two previous relationships, 45-year-old Cynthia Cleese, whose mother is Connie Booth, and 32-year-old Camilla Cleese, whose mother is Barbara Trentham."
