        "text": "MONTY Python star John Cleese says he wishes all his ex-wives \"dead\" and that children are the \"cause of most of the misery in the world\" in a tongue in cheek interview on US telly.\n\nThe ageing comedian, who has paid out more than £25million on three failed marriages, hit out at his his ex-wives during an appearance on the US chat show with Conan O'Brien.\n\nThe 77-year-old also told the host he is less than impressed by his two daughters, Camilla and Cynthia Cleese, as they've \"grown up like their mothers\", reports MailOnline.\n\nCleese, who is now married to fourth wife Jennifer Wade - 32 years his junior, appeared on the programme alongside comedy partner Eric Idle to promote their north American two-man comedy show 'Together Again at Last... For the First Time', and soon got chatting about what the secret is to a long lasting marriage.\n\nHe said: “I have been married for 34 years. To four different wives.\n\n“One of my ex-wives died. You know what? It was very sad because it was the wrong one.”\n\nHe was referring to his second wife Barbara Threntham, who died from complications with leukemia in 2013. Before that he was married to fellow Fawlty Towers actress Connie Booth. His third wife was Alyce Cleese.\n\nConan chuckled along with the actor and comedian before he asked: “Do you have any real anger or hatred towards your ex-wives?”\n\nThe actor responded: “No, I mean, I am quite happy if one or two of them would be dead. But I don't have anything against them as people.\n\n“I wish them dead in the nicest possible way. Not dead in a slow agonising death over a number of years. Something quick like a tree falling on them.”\n\nFollowing Cleese's dry comments, Idle, who has been married 40 years to his Californian wife Tania Kosevich, said his secret to a lasting marriage was \"two separate countries\".\n\nBut the digs didn't end there.\n\nCleese darkly added: “I think the secret is not to have children. Children are the cause of most of the misery in the world.\n\n“They cost you a fortune, you worry yourself sick and then they grow up like their mothers. Cats are the answer. You can feed them twice a day.\"\n\nCynthia Cleese is the child from her dad's first marriage to Connie Booth, while Camilla's mum was Barbara Threntham.\n\nThe Sun has contacted John Cleese's representative for comment."
