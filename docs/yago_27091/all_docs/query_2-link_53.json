But now it looks like Smiley, a marketing exec at Radar's parent company, is on track to become the fourth Mrs. Cleese, assuming living gossip museum Cindy Adams has stumbled upon some actual news:\n\nJOHN Cleese, approaching 70, seems also to be approaching a fourth wife. Currently in an unpretty divorce with No. 3, his newie is a marketer, 35, blond, and they met in New York, and she lives in the US, and he lives in the UK, and it's a big commute for the twain to meet\n\nMeh, the marriage sounds a bit hypothetical. But at least there's reason to believe the couple are still together!\n\n[ Post]\n\n(Photo via Daily Mail)"
