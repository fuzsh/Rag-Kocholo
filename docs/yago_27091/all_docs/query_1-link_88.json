        "text": "John Cleese is holding what appears to be his own personal auction of \"Monty Python\" paraphernalia in an effort to make alimony payments.\n\nThe actor and comedian divorced his third wife, American psychotherapist Alyce Faye Lichtenberger, in 2008. As part of the settlement, Cleese was required to make annual payments of nearly $1 million to Lichtenberger for a total of seven years.\n\nCleese, now 73, appears to be struggling to make payments however even after launching a 2009 comedy tour dubbed \"The Alimony Tour.\" To earn additional funds, the comedian has agreed to sell films props and signed photos that he has collected through the years. Amongst those items is a helmet that Cleese wore during two \"Monty Python\" films and two photo of himself alongside other Monty actors, both of which have been signed.\n\nGet Our Latest News for FREE\n\nSubscribe to get daily/weekly email with the top stories (plus special offers!) from The Christian Post. Be the first to know.\n\nThe merchandise has been listed on the Original Memorabilia website, the same site were Cleese previously listed his vintage 1987 Bentley.\n\nCleese was married to Lichtenberger for 16 years. Last year he married his fourth wife, Jennifer Wade, who is 31 years his junior. Cleese has admitted in the past that he has had difficulty choosing the right life partner.\n\n\"I never felt there was anything wrong with the institution of marriageâ€“ the only thing wrong was my ability to choose the right person,\" Cleese told Daily Mail just after marrying Wade. \"I couldn't imagine being with anyone other than Jenny now.\"\n\nCleese said that people may find it strange at first that he took a bride so much younger than himself, but that it makes more sense in person.\n\n\"We're kindred spirits. When people see us together, they immediately get it,\" he said.\n\nIn addition to appearing in the \"Monty Python\" films for which he is the most known, Cleese has also made appearances in other popular movies including two James Bond films, two Harry Potter films, and three \"Shrek\" films."
