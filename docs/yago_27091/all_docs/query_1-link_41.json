        "text": "Since John Cleese began courting Jennifer Wade last year, the jewellery designer has been at pains to emphasise that she is not a gold-digger.\n\n“After I divorced, my lawyer said to me he wanted to put up a photograph of me in his office with a sign above it saying, 'The woman who took nothing,’ ” Wade boasted recently.\n\nNow, however, her former husband, Richard Norris, has stepped forward to contradict her claims. “I would like to point out that Miss Wade’s assertion that, following her divorce, 'she walked away with nothing’ is completely untrue,” he tells Mandrake.\n\nGallantly, the Old Harrovian businessman declines to be drawn further. However, one of Wade’s friends backs him up: “She was treated very generously by Richard. She received a hefty settlement.”\n\nEarlier this month, the statuesque Wade, 40, told me that she was helping Cleese, 71, to make ends meet after his costly divorce from his third wife, the American psychotherapist Alyce Faye Eichelberger.\n\nIn 2008, the comedian agreed a £12 million settlement in finance and assets, including £600,000 a year for seven years.\n\nWade said she had been doing some nude modelling for the sculptor Jonathan Wylder and was paid a commission for each of his works that were sold. “I need that money to pay her alimony,” she said of Eichelberger."
