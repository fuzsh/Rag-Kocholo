        "text": "John Cleese and his wife, Jennifer Wade, married in 2012\n\nJohn Cleese and his wife, Jennifer Wade, married over a decade ago, and their love has been strong ever since.\n\nThe couple met through mutual friends in 2009, according to U.K. newspaper The Sun. Three years later, they married in an intimate ceremony on the Caribbean island of Mustique.\n\nThe couple share a similar playful personality, with Cleese telling the Daily Express that they enjoy catching each other off-guard.\n\n\"I'm married to the most wonderfully playful woman,\" he said during a 2020 interview. \"We spend all our time hiding in cupboards and trying to scare each other. I remember not long ago, I got back to the flat and I looked around and called and no sign.\"\n\nCleese recalled that he was looking around for his wife and was squeezing between the bed and the wall when Wade, who had been hiding under the bed, grabbed him by his ankle.\n\n\"It frightened the s--- out of me â€” she'd been lying under the bed for 10 minutes!\"\n\nSo who is John Cleese's wife? Here's everything to know about Jennifer Wade and her relationship with the Monty Python actor.\n\nShe and Cleese made their first public appearance in 2010\n\nWade and Cleese first stepped out as a couple in 2010 when they attended the ATP World Tour Finals at London's O2 Arena. The Shrek star and his then-girlfriend watched a men's single's match between David Ferrer and Robin Soderling.\n\nA few months later, the pair headed to a private exhibition at the Victoria & Albert Museum in London. A smiling Cleese wore a dark blue blazer, blue shirt and grey pants as he wrapped his arm around Wade's waist. She wore a chic white dress for the art event.\n\nShe's a jewelry designer\n\nWade is known for the beautiful and striking jewelry designs she produces for her brand, Jennifer Wade Jewellery and has showcased her pieces at contemporary jewelry shows.\n\nAccording to the brand's website, Wade's pieces are \"designed to be very imaginative while still complementing your individual style and taste.\" The site also adds that the latest collection includes, \"stylish yet understated pieces that reflect a modern interpretation of classic designs.\"\n\nThe designer has taken influence from her extensive travels. Speaking with Country & Townhouse magazine in 2016, Wade also explained that she loves classic designs.\n\n\"I have my own jewellery brand, so I have been working very hard with artisans and sourcing amazing materials for my new collection,\" she said. \"My ethos of understated interpretations of classic designs is certainly pushed to new levels with a very innovative new range of necklaces, bracelets and earrings.\"\n\nThey married in 2010\n\n\"She is an extraordinary one off,\" Cleese told Hello! magazine on his wedding day in August 2012. \"I knew from the first moment I met her that this could be something very serious.\"\n\nWade told the outlet that the couple's 31-year age difference is not a cause for concern, and it \"never bothers\" them.\n\n\"We're kindred spirits. When people see us together, they immediately get it,\" she explained. The comedy legend went on to add that he couldn't imagine being with anyone else but Wade.\n\nWade also revealed to Country & Townhouse magazine in 2016 that her hero is \"my husband John\" and detailed how due to their busy schedules, \"John and I really appreciate it when we can spend time together, as well as with friends.\"\n\nShe and Cleese hosted a fundraising event\n\nIn 2016, the couple hosted an event in aid of the Born Free Foundation, an animal welfare charity that campaigns to keep animals out of captivity and to protect wild animals living in their natural habitat.\n\nThe event took place at a La Perla lingerie store in London and resulted in many playful snaps from Cleese and Wade. Cleese placed a bra over his eyes for one series of photos, and others include the pair pulling fun faces and making gestures toward the camera.\n\nPosting on X (formerly Twitter) following the event, Wade shared that it had been a success.\n\n\"Great event last night. Proceeds all for @BFFoundation,\" she wrote on May 26, 2016, adding that the event had been sponsored by \"Jennifer Wade Jewellery & @LaPerlaLingerie.\"\n\nA frequent fundraiser, Wade also raised Â£7,041 (~$8720) in November 2013 during a sponsored swim in aid of Macmillan Cancer Support.\n\nShe and Cleese share several cats\n\nThe couple are pet parents to several cats. The felines are often proudly shown off across both Cleese and Wade's social media accounts, with Cleese often joking that his wife is worried that she has \"offended the cats.\"\n\n\"My wife Fish [Cleese's nickname for Wade] has gone to bed early this evening,\" he wrote on X (formerly Twitter) in October 2022. \"Apparently she has offended two of the cats, and they won't tell her what she did I think it'll blow over in a couple of days.\"\n\nFor more People news, make sure to sign up for our newsletter!"
