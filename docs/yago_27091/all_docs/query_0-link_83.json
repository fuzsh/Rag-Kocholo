        "text": "Monty Python legend John Cleese has revealed how he was paid only $12,000 for the first series of Fawlty Towers.\n\nIn a rare public reunion with his former wife and cast members of classic British sitcom, the 69-year-old, who co-wrote the comedy with Connie Booth when they were married in the 1970s, before making millions and moving to California, added that they would be mad to try to revive the show.\n\n\"We're too old and tired now,\" he said at the launch of a documentary about the series, which only ran for 12 episodes but made \"Don't mention the war\" a catchphrase among generations of fans.\n\nCleese, who started in Monty Python's Flying Circus and went via Fawlty Towers to success on the big screen including A Fish Called Wanda, recalled how, for the first series of Fawlty Towers he was paid only STG6,000 ($A12,135.92) for 43 weeks' work.\n\n\"I have to thank the advertising industry for making this possible. Connie and I used to spend six weeks writing each episode and we didn't make a lot of money out of it,'\" he said.\n\n\"It took six weeks to make each show, so that's 36 weeks, one week to film them - 37 weeks - and six weeks to actually tape them in the studio so that's 43 weeks' work, for which I was paid for writing and performing and filming, STG6,000 ($A12,000),'' he added.\n\n\"So that meant that I was able to subsidise my writing time by doing commercials.''\n\nCleese recalled submitting the first script to Jimmy Gilbert at the BBC. Gilbert responded that the script was \"full of cliched situations and stereotypical characters, and I cannot see it as being anything other than a disaster,'' Cleese said.\n\n\"And Jimmy himself said, 'You're going to have to get them out of the hotel, John, you can't do the whole thing in the hotel.' Whereas, of course, it's in the hotel that the whole pressure cooker builds up.''\n\nSounding rather like an inn keeper on a short fuse, Cleese was critical of the new generation of comedy writers.\n\n\"I don't think the writers work as hard as they used to, and I think they may lack experience because I don't think the writing is as good as it used to be,'' said Cleese.\n\n\"But I do proudly say that in the '60s, '70s and '80s we did have the least bad television in the world, and that's quite a claim. I think the main problem now is it's run on the basis of money.''\n\nAgencies"
