        "text": "Fawlty Towers may have only run for 12 episodes, but they catapulted the cast into superstardom, as the series quickly became a fan favourite during the seventies.\n\nJohn Cleese's portrayal of permanently frustrated hotelier Basil Fawlty ensured his status as a British TV icon after successful parts in Monty Python and The Frost Report.\n\nAfter creating the show with his first wife Connie Booth, the pair decided to end things on a high, ensuring the twelve episodes they made went down in history.\n\nREAD MORE: John Cleese's biggest controversies - Nazi jokes, Hitler impressions and slave comments\n\nAs Cleese celebrates turning 84, Daily Star is checking out that infamous Torquay hotel to discover where the staff and residents are now.\n\nJohn Cleese (Basil Fawlty)\n\nEvery episode saw Cleese’s rude hotel owner Basil explode in a fit of rage, whether it was directed at bumbling Spanish waiter Manuel, giving his car a “damn good thrashing” or goose-stepping around the room.\n\nAfter leaving the English Riviera, Cleese focused on films during the 1980s and 90s, starring in Clockwise, A Fish Called Wanda and its sequel, Fierce Creatures, plus two Bond films as Q’s assistant and Q.\n\nIn 2016, he revived Basil and his car thrashing for a Specsavers advert, with some speculating it was to help recover from an expensive divorce.\n\nFour-times married Cleese, 81, was ordered to pay third wife Alyce Eichelberger £12million, including £600,000 a year for seven years.\n\nThe dad of two, now lives with wife Jennifer on the Caribbean island of Nevis, where he emigrated after becoming disillusioned with British politics.\n\nHe is now set to front his own show on GB News alongside Andrew Doyle, which will focus on \"proper argument\". In October, he also dressed up as the iconic Basil to promote the show in a new advert.\n\nPrunella Scales (Sybil Fawlty)\n\nSarcastic Sybil was always on hand with a putdown and far more capable of handling the hotel than husband Basil.\n\nScales went on to star in a string of films, including The Boys From Brazil and Howard’s End, but she might be best remembered for the Tesco adverts she did as Dotty, alongside Jane Horrocks as her long-suffering daughter.\n\nShe is married to actor Timothy West and the pair have two sons. The eldest, actor Sam West, recently appeared in the All Creatures Great And Small remake.\n\nScales, now 88, and her husband filmed Great Canal Journeys together on Channel 4 from 2014 to 2019.\n\nWhen the show started they revealed she had Alzheimer’s and in 2020, she told how the condition had forced them to quit the much-loved travelogue and retire from screens.\n\nAndrew Sachs (Manuel)\n\nSachs’ hapless waiter often took the brunt of Basil’s bashings.\n\nBut did you know he recorded three singles in character, including Manuel’s Good Food Guide in 1977?\n\nOn the show Sachs suffered second-degree burns in a re stunt.\n\nAfter hanging up his apron, he did voiceover and radio work as well as TV, including a brief stint in Coronation Street.\n\nIn 2008, Sachs was in the headlines after Russell Brand and Jonathan Ross prank-called him, leaving messages about Brand having sex with his grand-daughter Georgina Baillie.\n\nIt sparked a huge scandal and the BBC apologised, with Brand resigning and Ross being suspended.\n\nSachs was also said to have cut off contact with his granddaughter following the scandal but managed to patch things up before he died.\n\nIn 2012 Sachs was diagnosed with vascular dementia, leaving him unable to speak and in a wheelchair. He died in 2016, with widow Melody dying the following year. They had three children.\n\nConnie Booth (Polly Sherman)\n\nBooth co-wrote Fawlty Towers with her then-husband Cleese and starred in the show as sensible chambermaid Polly.\n\nBooth and Cleese met in the 1960s, married in 1968 and had their daughter Cynthia three years later. By the time the second series of Fawlty Towers began filming, the two were divorced but still good friends.\n\nBooth went on to star in shows including The Tomorrow People and The Buccaneers but quit acting in 1995.\n\nShe then changed career and became a psychotherapist. Now 80, she lives in London with her author husband John Lahr.\n\nBallard Berkeley (Major Gowen)\n\nThe slightly senile major was a permanent resident at the hotel.\n\nBut the character’s racist and bigoted views have been censored, with his most offensive lines cut out of repeats.\n\nIn real life Berkeley appeared in several TV series including Hi-de-Hi! and To The Manor Born, and his last role was a voiceover in the animated film The BFG before his death in 1988.\n\nBernard Cribbins (Mr Hutchinson)\n\nCribbins played a spoons salesman whom Basil became convinced was a hotel inspector.\n\nThe beloved actor's impressive career spanned more than 70 years, with highlights including narrating The Wombles, starring in three Carry On films and appearing alongside David Tennant and Catherine Tate in Doctor Who.\n\nCribbins, was married to his wife Gillian McBarnet from 1955 to her death in 2021.\n\nHe passed away aged 93 on 27 July 2022, with tributes flooding in from both co-stars and fans when the news broke.\n\nCribbins' final TV performance will be reprising his role as Wilfred Mott on Doctor Who, as David Tennant said earlier this year: \"Can we get Wilfred back? Can grandad be back on set? He was getting old and a little bit infirm but he was still full of beans and full of energy\n\n\"And I am thrilled to say that – although very sadly he wasn't in those episodes as much as we hoped – he was on set with us and Wilfred lives on.\n\n\"Bernard is much missed and much grieved for, but I am so excited that his final screen performance will be [one] I had the great honour of being part of and you'll see it all on your screens.\"\n\nFor more of the latest showbiz news from Daily Star, make sure you sign up to one of our newsletters here.\n\nREAD NEXT:"
