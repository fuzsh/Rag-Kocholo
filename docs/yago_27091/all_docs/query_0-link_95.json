        "text": "For the businesswoman, see Connie Booth (business executive).\n\nConnie Booth (born December 2, 1940) is an American actress and writer. She has appeared in several British television programmes and films, including her role as Polly Sherman on BBC Two's Fawlty Towers, which she co-wrote with her then-husband John Cleese. In 1995, she quit acting and worked as a psychotherapist until her retirement.\n\nEarly life\n\nBooth was born in Indianapolis, Indiana, on December 2, 1940. Her father was a Wall Street stockbroker and her mother an actress. The family later moved to New York State. Booth entered acting and worked as a Broadway understudy and waitress. She met John Cleese while he was working in New York City; they married on February 20, 1968.\n\nActing career\n\nBooth secured parts in episodes of Monty Python's Flying Circus (1969–74) and in the Python films And Now for Something Completely Different (1971) and Monty Python and the Holy Grail (1975, as a woman accused of being a witch). She also appeared in How to Irritate People (1968), a pre-Monty Python film starring Cleese and other future Monty Python members; a short film titled Romance with a Double Bass (1974) which Cleese adapted from a short story by Anton Chekhov; and The Strange Case of the End of Civilization as We Know It (1977), Cleese's Sherlock Holmes spoof, as Mrs. Hudson.\n\nBooth and Cleese co-wrote and co-starred in Fawlty Towers (1975 and 1979), in which she played waitress and chambermaid Polly. For thirty years Booth declined to talk about the show until she agreed to participate in a documentary about the series for the digital channel Gold in 2009.\n\nBooth played various roles on British television, including Sophie in Dickens of London (1976), Mrs. Errol in a BBC adaptation of Little Lord Fauntleroy (1980) and Miss March in a dramatisation of Edith Wharton's The Buccaneers (1995). She also starred in the lead role of a drama called The Story of Ruth (1981), in which she played the role of the schizophrenic daughter of an abusive father. In 1994, she played a supporting role in \"The Culex Experiment\", an episode of the children's science fiction TV series The Tomorrow People.\n\nBooth also had a stage career, primarily in the London theatre, appearing in 10 productions from the mid-1970s through the mid-1990s, notably starring with John Mills in the 1983–1984 West End production of Little Lies at Wyndham's Theatre.\n\nPsychotherapy career\n\nBooth ended her acting career in 1995. After studying for five years at the University of London, she began a career as a psychotherapist, registered with the British Psychoanalytic Council.\n\nPersonal life\n\nIn 1971, Booth and Cleese had a daughter, Cynthia, who appeared alongside her father in the films A Fish Called Wanda and Fierce Creatures. Booth and Cleese divorced in 1978. With Cleese, Booth wrote the scripts for and co-starred in both series of Fawlty Towers, although the two were actually divorced before the second series was finished and aired. Their daughter Cynthia married screenwriter Ed Solomon in 1995.\n\nBooth married John Lahr, author and former New Yorker senior drama critic, in 2000. They live in North London.\n\nSelected filmography and theatrical appearances\n\nTelevision\n\nYear Show Role Notes 1968 How to Irritate People Various characters Television film 1969–1974 Monty Python's Flying Circus Various characters 1972 Dickens of London Sophie 1975, 1979 Fawlty Towers Polly Sherman Also co-creator and writer 1978 Off to Philadelphia in the Morning Jane Parry Television drama 1980 Why Didn't They Ask Evans Sylvia Bassington-ffrench Television film 1982 The Deadly Game Helen Trapp Television film 1983 The Hound of the Baskervilles Laura Lyons Television film 1985 Past Caring Linda Television film 1986 Bergerac Monica McLoed Episode: \"Winner Takes All\" 1987 The Return of Sherlock Holmes Violet Morstan Television film 1990 Wizadora Wizadora Pilot episode 1994 The Tomorrow People Doctor Lucy Connoe Episode: \"The Culex Experiment\" 1995 The Buccaneers Miss March\n\nFilm\n\nYear Show Role Notes 1971 And Now for Something Completely Different Various characters 1974 Romance with a Double Bass Princess Costanza 1975 Monty Python and the Holy Grail The Witch 1977 The Strange Case of the End of Civilization as We Know It Mrs Hudson / Francine Moriarty 1980 Little Lord Fauntleroy Mrs Errol 1981 The Story of Ruth Ruth 1987 84 Charing Cross Road the Lady from Delaware 1988 High Spirits Marge 1988 Hawks Nurse Jarvis 1991 American Friends Caroline Hartley 1992 Leon the Pig Farmer Yvonne Chadwick\n\nTheatre"
