        "text": "Public technical college system in Georgia, USA\n\nThe Technical College System of Georgia (TCSG), formerly known as the Department of Technical and Adult Education (DTAE), is the State of Georgia Government Agency which supervises the U.S. state of Georgia's 22 technical colleges, while also surveying the adult literacy program and economic and workforce development programs. The system operates the Georgia Virtual Technical Connection, a clearinghouse for online technical courses. The TCSG serves the people and the state by creating a system of technical education whose purpose is to use the latest technology and easy access for all adult Georgians and corporate citizens.\n\nThe Technical College System and the University System of Georgia (USG) are completely separate agencies and work entirely independently of each other, except for certain cooperative efforts. Some core courses are transferable between the two, though this was made more difficult when the USG moved to the semester system in 1997, while the TCSG remained on the quarter system. The TCSG changed to the semester system in Fall 2011. The TCSG worked with the state budget office to minimize the economic impact of the conversion, believing a move is in the best interests of TCSG students.\n\nIn 2008, the question of merging some schools arose. The first such merger was that of Georgia Aviation Technical College in Eastman into the USG's Middle Georgia College (now known as Middle Georgia State University) in 2007, effective July 1. In September 2008, the State Board of Technical and Adult Education voted to merge thirteen colleges into six. The board stated that the mergers only affect the administrative functions of the colleges.[1]\n\nWhen the University System of Georgia mandated semesters in 1998, enrollment fell by several thousand students, and those that remained took fewer courses, causing budget shortfalls which the state legislature had to make up for.[2]\n\nInstitution Location Albany Technical College Albany Athens Technical College Athens Atlanta Technical College Atlanta Augusta Technical College Augusta Central Georgia Technical College Macon Chattahoochee Technical College Marietta Coastal Pines Technical College Waycross Columbus Technical College Columbus Georgia Northwestern Technical College Rome Georgia Piedmont Technical College Clarkston Gwinnett Technical College Lawrenceville Lanier Technical College Gainesville North Georgia Technical College Clarkesville Oconee Fall Line Technical College Sandersville Ogeechee Technical College Statesboro Savannah Technical College Savannah South Georgia Technical College Americus Southeastern Technical College Vidalia Southern Crescent Technical College Griffin Southern Regional Technical College Thomasville West Georgia Technical College Waco Wiregrass Georgia Technical College Valdosta\n\nFormer units of the TCSG\n\n[edit]\n\nThese institutions were independent units of the TCSG; however, they were merged with other institutions, with most of the mergers occurring during the Technical College System consolidation of 2009.[4]\n\nAltamaha Technical College, Jesup: merged with Okefenokee Technical College and renamed Coastal Pines Technical College in July 2014.\n\nAppalachian Technical College, Jasper and Woodstock: merged with Chattahoochee Technical College in July 2009.\n\nEast Central Technical College, Fitzgerald and Ocilla: merged with Valdosta Technical College and renamed Wiregrass Georgia Technical College in July 2010.\n\nFlint River Technical College, Thomaston: merged with Griffin Technical College and renamed Southern Crescent Technical College in July 2010.\n\nGeorgia Aviation Technical College, Eastman: merged into Middle Georgia State University (then Middle Georgia College) as its aviation campus in July 2007.\n\nHeart of Georgia Technical College, Dublin: merged with Sandersville Technical College and renamed Oconee Fall Line Technical College in July 2011.\n\nMiddle Georgia Technical College, Warner Robins: merged with Central Georgia Technical College in July 2013.\n\nMoultrie Technical College, Moultrie: merged with Southwest Georgia Technical College and renamed Southern Regional Technical College in July 2016.\n\nNorth Metro Technical College, Acworth: merged with Chattahoochee Technical College in July 2009.\n\nNorthwestern Technical College, Rock Spring: merged with Coosa Valley Technical College and renamed Georgia Northwestern Technical College in July 2009.\n\nSwainsboro Technical College, Swainsboro: merged with Southeastern Technical College in July 2009.\n\nWest Central Technical College, Waco: merged with West Georgia Technical College (the Waco campus is designated as main campus of the merged schools) in July 2009.\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nOfficial website\n\nMap of the Service Areas of TCSG institutions (including Primary Campus locations)\n\nFormer and Inactive Campaigns\n\n[edit]"
