Rochelle White from Oconee Fall Line Technical College was named TCSG’s 2022 Adult Education Student of the Year. Devlynn Taylor from Augusta Technical College won the 2022 Outstanding Adult Education Teacher of the Year award.\n\nTCSG State Board Chairman, Trey Sheppard, TCSG Commissioner Greg Dozier, and TCSG Assistant Commissioner for Adult Education, Dr. Cayanna Good, presented the awards during the annual Dinah Culbreath Wayne EAGLE Institute at the Grand Hyatt in Buckhead on March 15.\n\n“Rochelle and Devlynn represent the absolute best that adult education has to offer here in Georgia,” said TCSG Commissioner Greg Dozier. “As the adult education student of the year and adult education teacher of the year, Rochelle and Devlynn are making positive impacts in their communities through education and are shining examples of what’s possible through hard work and perseverance.”\n\nTCSG’s Dinah Culbreath Wayne EAGLE Award recognizes and honors students from throughout the state who have demonstrated exceptional achievement in TCSG’s adult education programs. Each March, the local EAGLE winners are the guests of a three-day conference in Atlanta. Rochelle, who was selected by a panel of judges from business and education, will receive a full scholarship to the technical college of her choice. In addition, her fees and books will be paid for through a stipend from the Brenda Wise Scholarship Fund, established in 2014 in memory of Brenda Wise, a lifelong supporter of adult education.\n\n“We are so excited for Rochelle and all that she has overcome to be where she is today,” said Oconee Fall Line Technical College president, Erica Harden. “As a single mother of five children, Rochelle was determined to earn her High School Equivalency so she can enroll in a nursing program to better provide for herself and her family. She is truly an inspiration to us all.”\n\nOver the coming year, Rochelle will travel the state as Georgia’s Dinah Culbreath Wayne EAGLE ambassador for adult education, speaking to students, civic groups, legislators, and others about literacy and lifelong learning. The runner-up for the adult education student of the year is Natosha Banks-Nolley from Gwinnett Technical College. Twenty-five adult learners were celebrated at the event by hundreds of guests who applauded the students for overcoming obstacles that once stood in the way of their education.\n\nThis year also marked the inaugural Outstanding Adult Education Teacher of the Year Award, which was given to Devlynn Taylor from Augusta Technical College. “For anyone who knows her, it’s clear that teaching was Devlynn’s calling in life,” said Augusta Technical College president, Dr. Jermaine Whirl. “Her passion for education and for inspiring her students to be all that they can be is infectious. This is a well-deserved honor for her and for our college.”\n\n###\n\nAbout the Technical College System of Georgia\n\nThe 22 colleges of the Technical College System of Georgia (TCSG) are Georgia’s top resource for skilled workers.
