The building houses trades, industrial, and transportation programs, adult education, administrative services, and student affairs services for the OFTC Dublin Campus. The campus is adjacent to Interstate 16 midway between Macon and Savannah, Georgia. The expansion of the Savannah port will spur economic opportunities in Southeast Georgia as evidenced by the new Hyundai plant.
