This information is provided on the College Financing Plan.\n\nThe College Financing Plan (formerly known as the Financial Aid Shopping Sheet) is a standardized form developed by the U.S. Department of Education to simplify the information students receive from colleges and universities about educational costs and financial aid so they can easily compare institutions and make informed decisions about which institution to attend.\n\nThe College Financing Plan will be available to the student within 14 days of charges posting to the student’s account. Students will be mailed a copy of the college financing plan and/or may access it on Banner Web under the Financial Aid tab."
