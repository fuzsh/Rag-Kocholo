        "text": "The City of Cochran is located in an educational mecca that supports the educational and workforce needs of citizens in the Middle Georgia region. City residents have access to quality educational resources that extend from Pre-Kindergarten through College. Children within the City attend the Bleckley County Schools, where administrators, teachers, staff, parents, and the community have established a long term commitment to excellence. With a vision of \"Expect Excellence\" our schools are committed to providing students with the best education possible. Our System's mission of \"Providing Excellent Educational Experiences Today for Tomorrow's Success,\" demonstrates our schools' dedication to preparing our students for success at all levels. Our small rural school district enjoys strong parental and community support with an outstanding team that focuses on high standards and high expectations for all.\n\nThe Bleckley County School System received district accreditation by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS) in 2014. The Bleckley County School System and each school are \"Accredited with Quality\" by the Georgia Accrediting Commission.\n\nOn the College and Career Readiness Performance Index (CCRPI) scores released in the spring of 2013, the scores for all Bleckley County schools exceeded the state average. Bleckley County Primary School and Bleckley County Elementary School received scores of 95. Bleckley County Middle School earned an 88 and Bleckley County High School received a 75.\n\nSchoolDigger, a website designed to assist parents in locating the best schools in each state, named the Bleckley County Schools as one of the top ten school systems in Georgia for two consecutive years. U. S. News & World Report's Best High Schools recognized Bleckley County High School with a Bronze Award for two consecutive years. Bleckley County Middle School has been named a Georgia School of Excellence twice and recently received the GASSP Breakout School Award. Bleckley County Elementary School was named a Georgia Title I Reward School for High Performance for the second consecutive year and also holds the distinction of being a Georgia School of Excellence.\n\nAccording to scores released by the College Board, Bleckley County High School students in 2013 averaged 1476 points on the SAT. That average score was higher than all other high schools in central Georgia and 24 points higher than the state average.\n\nOur local schools not only exceed in academics, they also excel in extracurricular activities. During the 2012-2013 school year, the Royals brought home region championships in cheerleading, girls' basketball, literary, and boys and girls tennis, golf, and cross country. The boys' basketball team was runners-up for the state championship in 2013. The Royal Kingsmen band consistently receives superior ratings at festivals and in competition.\n\nResidents of the City of Cochran also have access to multiple institutions of higher education that provide for the needs of our region. Located within the City Limits, the University System of Georgia maintains a four-year residential branch campus (formerly Middle Georgia College) of Middle Georgia State University. The University offers degrees that enhance the educational, economic, and cultural lives of our residents. Additionally, the university offers a wide array of degrees that meet the educational interests of traditional and nontraditional students. With low tuition, robust financial aid, a commitment to the success of each student, and a vibrant residence life program, the University promises a challenging, affordable, and rewarding University experience leading to degrees of proven quality. The University is currently in the process of converting from a State College to a University that will deliver Master's degrees to our region.\n\nIn addition to the University System, Cochran has access to two technical colleges, Oconee Fall Line and Central Georgia Technical Colleges, within the Technical College System of Georgia. The mission of each of these Colleges is to contribute to the economic and workforce development of our region through quality technical and continuing education, adult education, and business and industry services. These Colleges offer associate degrees, diplomas, technical certificates of credit, and non-credit certificates in a student-centered learning environment through traditional and distance education modes of delivery. Their approach to learning is both academic and hands-on. Students examine the theories behind the material they are studying and have exciting opportunities to put what they learn into actual practice. All of the programs offered by these colleges give students a solid, up-to-date base of knowledge, skills, and experience. Each of these colleges provide a variety of academic tutoring and study-skills assistance to help students achieve, advance, and succeed. Oconee Fall Line and Central Georgia Technical College work closely with business and industry to provide customized training, to connect their graduates with employment opportunities and to ensure students are working with state-of-the-art equipment, technology, and processes.\n\nFor further information regarding the local educational institutions that support our City, please click on the links below.\n\nBleckley County School System\n\nHigh School\n\nMiddle School\n\nElementary School\n\nPrimary School\n\nPre-K Learning Center\n\nTechnical College System of Georgia\n\nOconee Fall Line Technical College\n\nCentral Georgia Technical College\n\nUniversity System of Geogia"
