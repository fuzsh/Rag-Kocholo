From the classroom instruction and hands-on labs, you will be ready to enter into the workplace prepared with the knowledge and skills to be the best you can be.\n\nAdditional Admissions Steps by Student Type\n\nSome students types have additional steps or requirements for admissions. Click on your student below:\n\nThe colleges listed on your GEORGIA MATCH letter are an academic match based on your HOPE GPA, and the colleges listed are holding a spot for you in their Fall 2024 Class. If you didn’t receive a letter, you can check your list on your GAfutures Student Dashboard.\n\nAnd while this gives you an initial idea of where you might be eligible to study, remember that you’ll still need to submit an official application to join our OFTC family or any other institution of your choice.\n\nDISCLAIMER: Being listed on your GEORGIA MATCH letter or Dashboard signifies a provisional acceptance. It doesn’t guarantee your admission to Oconee Fall Line Technical College or any other specific college, university, or particular major/program of study. The final call on admissions is made based on the college’s criteria, your final transcript, and your high school graduation status.\n\nOFTC’s Office of Admissions\n\nHours of Operation\n\nMonday – Thursday | 8:00 AM – 6:00 PM\n\nFriday | 8:00 AM – 1:00 PM\n\nAdditional information on Admissions is available in the online OFTC Catalog."
