        "text": "It would be easy to assume that it goes without saying Georgia is the nation’s top state for business and labor climate. After all, it’s been said and said often: proclaimed by Area Development Magazine every year since 2014, and by Site Selection Magazine every year since 2013. And Georgia’s internationally respected Quick Start training program (named the “#1 Workforce Training” program by CNBC in 2015) is an important asset in the calculation of the state’s top ranking.\n\nQuick Start experience is both broad and deep. For more than 40 years, the program has earned its name giving Georgia business and industry a head start on productivity and profitability by providing customized, free-of-charge training for new and existing operations. Quick Start delivers training when and where it’s needed, from classrooms to mobile labs to the shop floor. And as the world’s leading industry has flocked to Georgia, Quick Start has facilitated high performance across a comprehensive range of sectors, from biotech and healthcare to food and agribusiness, from service and warehouse/distribution to advanced manufacturing."
