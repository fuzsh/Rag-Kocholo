The Georgia Nonpublic Postsecondary Education Commission reviews applications from schools that offer postsecondary education, including private schools and out-of-state institutions that serve Georgia students with online instruction. Georgia participates in the State Authorization Reciprocity Agreement and recognizes accredited, degree-granting institutions from other member states.\n\nMany schools offer specific programs from state licensing agencies such as the Office of EMS or the Georgia Professional Standards Committee. If your chosen field requires a state license for employment, ensure that your prospective program meets your state’s minimum educational standards.\n\nAccreditation agencies review a school’s curriculum, student outcomes, instructor knowledge, and ongoing commitment to improvement. TCSG schools all hold accreditation from the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools. In addition, many schools seek programmatic accreditation from national accrediting agencies, such as the ASE Education Foundation, the Accreditation Commission for Education in Nursing, or the Commission on Accreditation of Allied Health Education Programs.\n\nSome schools also seek accreditation from the Distance Education Accrediting Commission (DEAC). DEAC evaluates all distance education activities offered from high school through professional doctoral degrees to ensure schools provide a rigorous educational experience.\n\nOnly properly accredited schools participate in federal student financial aid programs.
