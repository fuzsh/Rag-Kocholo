        "text": "Overview\n\nThe Respiratory Care associate degree program is a sequence of courses that prepares students for careers in the field of respiratory care. Learning opportunities develop academic and professional knowledge and skills required for job acquisition, retention, and advancement.\n\nThe program emphasizes specialized training in areas such as pulmonary and cardiac pharmacology, medical gases, humidity/aerosol therapy, positive pressure ventilation, incentive spirometry, patient assessment, postural drainage, percussion/vibration, assessment of diseases and conditions, critical respiratory care, advanced critical care monitoring, pulmonary function testing, and pediatric and neonatal respiratory care.\n\nProgram graduates receive a Respiratory Care Associate Degree of Applied Science which qualifies them to take the National Board for Respiratory Care (NBRC) examinations to become a Registered Respiratory Therapist. To work in the state of Georgia, all respiratory care practitioners must apply and be granted a license. The only way to obtain a license is to successfully pass NBRC board exams.\n\nStudents may enter the Respiratory Care degree program every semester.
