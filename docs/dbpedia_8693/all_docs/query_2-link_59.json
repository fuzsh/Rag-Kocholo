        "text": "LONG before they'd made the acquaintance of Warren Beatty and Mike Nichols, and long before they'd won enough Oscars and Golden Globes to play a nice game of chess, Gene Hackman and Dustin Hoffman were a mismatched pair of struggling, idealistic actors who found solace in each other's company -- first in classes at the Pasadena Playhouse in 1956, where they played bongos on the roof, and then later in a cold-water flat in Manhattan, where Mr. Hoffman crashed in Mr. Hackman's kitchen until he was banished to the couch of some unwitting dupe named Robert Duvall. Though Mr. Hackman and Mr. Hoffman (now 73 and 66, respectively) have been friends for nearly half a century, they never worked on a film together until ''Runaway Jury,'' the latest installment in the John Grisham franchise. On a recent publicity stop in New Orleans for the film, opening Friday, the two men met with the writer Jennifer Senior to reminisce, gossip and reveal Marlon Brando's secret weapon.\n\nJENNIFER SENIOR -- When you two met at the Pasadena Playhouse, there must have been something about each other you intuited immediately. What was it?\n\nGENE HACKMAN -- Yeah, I've thought about that. (Looking at Hoffman.) You were a little different. Most of the kids there were right out of high school. I was older. And you were 18 or 19, but the first time I saw you, you were in a, uh, a corduroy vest. And that's all.\n\nDUSTIN HOFFMAN -- Pants!\n\nHACKMAN -- But just a corduroy vest. No shirt or anything. And I thought, ''This is a weird looking little guy.''"
