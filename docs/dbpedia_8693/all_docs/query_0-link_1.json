        "text": "Gene Hackman\n\nGene Hackman became one of the most important actors of his generation in the 1970s. At that times, and really throughout his career, Gene Hackman movies were the sign of something artistically sound, films written and directed by some of the best in our business. Playing characters like Lex Luthor and Popeye Doyle, he became iconic, but it was his mastery of craft even in smaller, auteur-driven films that made him one of the most beloved actors of his generation. Gene Hackman films include some of the most acclaimed works of all time: “The French Connection,” “Unforgiven” “Bonnie and Clyde,” “The Royal Tenenbaums,” and so many more.\n\nGene Hackman Bio\n\nGene Hackman was born in San Bernardino, California on January 30, 1930, and his one brother. He moved a lot when he was a child, but grew up most in the Midwest, living in Danville, Illinois. Gene Hackman’s age when he decided he wanted to be an actor was only ten, but he entered the United States Marine Corps. first, serving four and a half years, stationed in China whan the Communist Revolution happened there in 1949. He joined the Pasadena Playhouse in 1956, where he became a close friend of another actor there, Dustin Hoffman. In fact, the two would also become friends with another struggling actor in the area, Robert Duvall. They even shared apartments after moving to New York in the ‘60s.\n\nGene Hackman Movies - Bonnie and Clyde\n\nGene Hackman Movies – The ‘60s\n\nA young Gene Hackman started his career in the early ‘60s with guest roles on TV and some stage work, but his first film role came in “Lilith,” co-starring Warren Beatty. The two would team again on one of the most famous Gene Hackman movies, 1967’s “Bonnie and Clyde,” which landed the young Gene Hackman his first Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor. He bounced around stage, film, and TV in this era, reportedly even being offered the role of Mike Brady in “The Brady Bunch,” which he nearly accepted.\n\nGene Hackman Movies - Superman\n\nGene Hackman Movies – The ‘70s\n\nThe 1970s were the most vital era for Gene Hackman films, starting with an Oscar nomination for “I Never Sang for My Father,” followed by arguably the role for which he will be most-remembered, Popeye Doyle. In William Friedkin’s “The French Connection,” he plays Jimmy “Popeye” Doyle, and it not only landed him his first lead actor Oscar nomination, but his first win. And he was just over forty, about to begin a lengthy stretch as one of the country’s most famous actors.\n\nFrom there, Gene Hackman movies could be anything. They could be an action film like “The Poseidon Adventure,” a great classic like “The Conversation,” often named on any list of the best spy movies, or even a comedy like “Young Frankenstein”.\n\nHe would reprise his role as Popeye Doyle in “French Connection II,” and who didn’t love Gene Hackman in “Superman”?
