        "text": "All of us live in an age where communication is an effortless task, and at the same time, we end up having misunderstandings and disagreements just because of the way something was said. Whatever you wish to convey, the kind of words you use and the way you put them decide how they would be perceived by the listener or reader. It is always difficult to communicate sad news or a negative opinion. The English language has a figure of speech called euphemism that will help you avoid this problem. In this article, you will learn what euphemism is, its definition, how to use euphemisms in a sentence and the points to remember when using euphemisms. The article also provides you with an extensive list of the most commonly used euphemisms for your reference.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat Is Euphemism? – Meaning and Definition\n\nUsing Euphemism in Sentences – Points to Remember\n\nExamples of Sentences Using Euphemism\n\nList of Most Commonly Used Euphemisms for Everyday Communication\n\nFrequently Asked Questions on the Usage of Euphemism\n\nWhat Is Euphemism? – Meaning and Definition\n\nThe term ‘euphemism’ refers to those words or a phrase that can be used to convey something unpleasant, sad or considered taboo. It is the art of communicating something in a less annoying and much lighter tone or in an indirect manner.\n\nTaking a look at how various dictionaries define euphemism can help you understand the term better. According to the Oxford Learner’s Dictionary, the term ‘euphemism’ is defined as “an indirect word or phrase that people often use to refer to something embarrassing or unpleasant, sometimes to make it seem more acceptable than it really is”. “A word or phrase used to avoid saying an unpleasant or offensive word” is the definition of euphemism, according to the Cambridge Dictionary.\n\nThe Collins Dictionary defines euphemism as “a polite word or expression that is used to refer to things which people may find upsetting or embarrassing to talk about”, and according to the Merriam-Webster Dictionary, euphemism is defined as “the substitution of an agreeable or inoffensive expression for one that may offend or suggest something unpleasant”.\n\nUsing Euphemism in Sentences – Points to Remember\n\nKnowing more than one way to communicate any piece of information is always a life-saver. Nobody gets to deal with just positive things all the time. Every now and then, there will be unpleasant events and not-so-great thoughts to be shared. Being able to put even an unpleasant idea in a pleasant and acceptable manner is a skill you should cultivate. Another reason for you to learn euphemisms is that they help you sound concerned about someone or some event that has taken place. One main point you should bear in mind when using euphemisms is that they are not meant to be sarcastic. Furthermore, you should also make it a point to learn and understand what each euphemism means before using it in your conversations.\n\nExamples of Sentences Using Euphemism\n\nGiven below are a few examples of sentences using euphemisms. Go through them and try to comprehend how it is used.\n\nHis great-grandfather passed away last week.\n\nIt is so unfortunate that we have to let you go.\n\nSandra seems to be between jobs.\n\nThe collateral damage that resulted from the war was saddening.\n\nWe have a differently-abled man working as security.\n\nWe got to know that the family was on the streets, and so we are trying to help them in every way possible.\n\nShankar belongs to a well-to-do family.\n\nThe company has been facing negative cash flow for the past few years.\n\nDevan’s grandmother seems to be enjoying her golden years happily and peacefully.\n\nRory was planning to go over to her parents’ house to break the news of the bun in the oven.\n\nList of Most Commonly Used Euphemisms for Everyday Communication\n\nHere is a table with the most common euphemisms, along with their meanings, that are used in day-to-day conversations for your reference.
