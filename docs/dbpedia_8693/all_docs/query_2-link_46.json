        "text": "Theoretically, I acknowledge that the acting legend deserves some hammock time. When he called it a day on his movie career, he was at the perfectly reasonable retirement age of 74. And he didn't even really retire, since he has written or co-written several novels since then. Still, call me selfish, but I miss seeing him on screen.\n\nHe gets a lot of attention for a guy who's been out of the public eye (although not its ear — for years, he was the voice of Lowe's and United Airlines commercials). Retired or not, he was identified as \"the greatest living American actor\" in a Grantland essay a few years back. Quite a few tributes popped up online when he turned 90 in January. And one of his best-loved performances, in \"Hoosiers,\" has been getting quite a bit of play as the nation's sportswriters, absent games to write about, compile lists of the greatest sports movies.\n\nOne fascinating thing about Hackman's enduring popularity — a Backstage.com story claims he's the actor everybody loves — is that he usually plays jerks. In roles ranging from a stubborn teacher/coach who arrives in a small town with no emotional baggage and very little back story (\"Hoosiers\") and a blind man in a sidesplitting comedy (\"Young Frankenstein\"), Hackman is almost always a friendless loner. This may have to do with Hackman's history — he has talked about his father deserting his family when he was young — but the actor can convey that quality of isolation in a variety of ways: as shyness, bravado, rage or self-deprecating humor.\n\nAs an actor, Hackman tends not to reveal a lot. His characters always seem to be keeping secrets, which may help draw us to him. Or maybe it's just Hackman's everyman magnetism that attracts us, since he doesn't even need good material to shine. \"Welcome to Mooseport,\" the lousy comedy that unfortunately capped his movie career, is distinguished by a line that must have resonated uncomfortably with Hackman: \"I had dignity once. Does anybody remember that?\" But even in the film's trailer, it's obvious that Hackman is giving it everything he has. That's also true of his work in \"The Poseidon Adventure,\" one of the all-time-best bad movies, and even his tiny role in \"Reds,\" a performance that chagrined director Warren Beatty years later when he learned Hackman (incorrectly) thought he hadn't done a good enough job to please Beatty.\n\nCertain characteristics travel from one Hackman role to another — a wry smile, a short fuse, that chuckle that indicates he doesn't think what he's laughing at is funny at all — but he showed enormous range across more than 100 TV and movie roles. And somehow, whether he was trying to take over the world in \"Superman,\" robbing banks with \"Bonnie and Clyde\" or dealing tough love to Meryl Streep in \"Postcards From the Edge,\" he always seemed like one of us.\n\nHackman's early-1970s imperial period began with him as a type of character he'd return to: lawmen who are just barely on the right side of the law (his Oscar-winning turn in \"Unforgiven,\" which just missed this list, is another). Still as electrifying as the day it was made and boasting maybe the best car chase in the history of film (give or take \"Bullitt\"), \"The French Connection\" earned Hackman just about every award, including the prestigious Kansas City Film Critics Circle best actor prize.\n\nThe white-savior aspect of this drama about racial tensions in the 1960s does not hold up well, but it boasts my favorite Hackman scene. He's an FBI agent trying to figure out what happened to civil rights activists who vanished. Near the end, he shares a charged moment with the Mississippi woman (Frances McDormand) whose courageous testimony led to justice. They've fallen in love, they want to express that, they know there's no way it can lead anywhere and they regret parting even before they do — all of which the Oscar-nominated pair conveys with barely a word.\n\nThere's something to be said about each of the three John Grisham adaptations that featured Hackman as menacing figures, but Gene's penultimate film is my favorite. In part, it's because it pairs him with the unknown actor he roomed with when both began their careers, Dustin Hoffman. Also, it's because Hackman seems to be having so much fun digging into the juicy improbability of Grisham's legal thriller."
