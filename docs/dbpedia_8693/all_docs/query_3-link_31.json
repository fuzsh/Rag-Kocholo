        "text": "Using short quotes\n\nIn UK academic culture, it is poor practice to use a lot of direct quotes from someone else's work. Your assignment should be mostly written in your own words, using evidence from your research to support or challenge your statements. When it is appropriate to use direct quotes, these should generally be kept as brief as possible and you should show how the quote relates to the argument you are making and the assignment question. It is good practice to include the page number.\n\nBelow are some examples of ways to build short quotes into your writing. Citations are all in Harvard style - check the style your department prefers.\n\nExamples:\n\nTurner (2007, p.14) argues that it is more effective to work \"better not longer\".\n\nIf your source has three or more authors, list the first followed by et al:\n\nThe results were described as \"disappointing\" (Jensen et al, 2011).\n\nIf you need to add a word or words to make the excerpted phrase make sense, put them in square brackets:\n\nHowever, identity may be expanded \"through [both] space and time\" (Wenger, 1998, p.181).\n\nIf you need to remove a word or words to shorten the excerpted phrase without changing the general sense, use an ellipsis:\n\nReferring to the work of black women photographers, Parmar (1990, p.122) observes that, \"The thematic concerns... are as varied as the women themselves\".\n\nUsing long quotes\n\nLong quotes (more than three or four lines) are set out in your text in a 'block' - started on a new line and indented at left and sometimes right. They are not placed in quotation marks, and the brief citation is placed on a separate line, on the right-hand side.\n\nExample (in Harvard):\n\nWhile students may feel that referencing is outdated, others have a different understanding:\n\nIs an insistence on referencing about supporting a system and a process of learning that is a legacy of a different time and society? Are universities enforcing upon you an arcane practice of referencing that you will probably never use again outside higher education? Or is there something deeper in the practice of referencing that connects with behaving ethically, properly, decently and respecting others - ageless societal values that universities should try to maintain?\n\nNeville, 2007, pp.27-8.\n\nLong quotes are often used in assignments which focus on analysing a particular text closely (for instance, a novel or poem, or an original document). In these cases, the analysis may need to refer to a large number of phrases within the text and some more than once. Long quotes should only be used if you are planning to analyse the text in some detail.\n\nPutting your understanding of what you have read into your own words is known as paraphrasing. A common mistake is to try to paraphrase a single sentence, which is very difficult and often ends in an inelegant and sometimes meaningless phrase. It is better to read the whole paragraph in which the idea lies, then try to write a sentence on your understanding of the idea. You may not need to include a page number here, as the idea may be argued throughout the source rather than just in one specific place.\n\nExample (in Harvard):\n\nOriginal: Set yourself a target - perhaps of writing 500 words per session - and make this a minmum target, regardless of how long it takes you to do. This method has that inbuilt incentive for you to finish the work as soon as possible. If you finish the work quickly then the rest of the day/evening or weekend is your own to do what you like with it.\n\nFrom (Hoult, E. (2006), Learning support for mature students. London: Sage, p.62).\n\nParaphrase including citation: Hoult (2006) argues that setting targets for achievement can be an effective way of managing study time, and may encourage task completion."
