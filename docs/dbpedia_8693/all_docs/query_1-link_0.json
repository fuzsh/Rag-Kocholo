        "text": "American actor (born 1930)\n\nEugene Allen Hackman[1][2][3] (born January 30, 1930) is an American retired actor. In a career that spanned more than six decades, he received two Academy Awards, two BAFTA Awards, four Golden Globes, a Screen Actors Guild Award, and the Silver Bear. Hackman's two Academy Award wins included one for Best Actor for his role as Jimmy \"Popeye\" Doyle in William Friedkin's acclaimed thriller The French Connection (1971) and the other for Best Supporting Actor for his role as \"Little\" Bill Daggett in Clint Eastwood's Western film Unforgiven (1992). His other Oscar-nominated roles were in Bonnie and Clyde (1967), I Never Sang for My Father (1970), and Mississippi Burning (1988).\n\nHackman gained further fame for his portrayal of Lex Luthor in Superman (1978) and its sequels Superman II (1980) and Superman IV: The Quest for Peace (1987). He also acted in The Poseidon Adventure (1972), The Conversation (1974), Reds (1981), Hoosiers (1986), No Way Out (1987), The Firm (1993), Get Shorty (1995), Crimson Tide (1995), The Birdcage (1996), Absolute Power (1997), and The Royal Tenenbaums (2001).\n\nEarly life and education\n\n[edit]\n\nEugene Allen Hackman was born in San Bernardino, California, United States, the son of Eugene Ezra Hackman and Anna Lyda Elizabeth (née Gray).[4] He has a brother named Richard. Hackman has Pennsylvania Dutch, English, and Scottish ancestry. His mother was born in Sarnia, Ontario, Canada.[5] Hackman's family moved frequently, finally settling in Danville, Illinois, where they lived in the house of his English-born maternal grandmother, Beatrice.[6] His father operated the printing press for the Commercial-News, a local newspaper. Hackman decided that he wanted to become an actor at age 10.[7] His parents divorced when he was 13 and his father subsequently left the family.[8][9]\n\nHackman lived briefly in Storm Lake, Iowa, and spent his sophomore year at Storm Lake High School.[10] He left home at age 16 and lied about his age to enlist in the United States Marine Corps. He served four and a half years as a field-radio operator. Hackman was stationed in China (Qingdao and later in Shanghai). When the Communist Revolution conquered the mainland in 1949, he was assigned to Hawaii and Japan. Following his discharge in 1951,[11] Hackman moved to New York City and had several jobs.[12] His mother died in 1962 as a result of a fire she accidentally started while smoking.[13] He began a study of journalism and television production at the University of Illinois under the G.I. Bill, but left and moved back to California.[14]\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nBeginnings to the 1960s\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1956, Hackman began pursuing an acting career. He joined the Pasadena Playhouse in California,[12] where he befriended another aspiring actor, Dustin Hoffman.[12] Already seen as outsiders by their classmates, Hackman and Hoffman were voted \"The Least Likely To Succeed\",[15][12] and Hackman got the lowest score the Pasadena Playhouse had yet given.[16] Determined to prove them wrong, Hackman moved to New York City. A 2004 article in Vanity Fair described Hackman, Hoffman, and Robert Duvall as struggling California-born actors and close friends, sharing NYC apartments in various two-person combinations in the 1960s.[17][18] To support himself between acting jobs, Hackman was working at a Howard Johnson's restaurant[19] when he encountered an instructor from the Pasadena Playhouse, who said that his job proved that Hackman \"wouldn't amount to anything\".[20] A Marine officer who saw him as a doorman said \"Hackman, you're a sorry son of a bitch\". Rejection motivated Hackman, who said:\n\nIt was more psychological warfare, because I wasn't going to let those fuckers get me down. I insisted with myself that I would continue to do whatever it took to get a job. It was like me against them, and in some way, unfortunately, I still feel that way. But I think if you're really interested in acting there is a part of you that relishes the struggle. It's a narcotic in the way that you are trained to do this work and nobody will let you do it, so you're a little bit nuts. You lie to people, you cheat, you do whatever it takes to get an audition, get a job.[19]\n\nHackman got various bit roles, for example in the film Mad Dog Coll and on the TV series Tallahassee 7000, The United States Steel Hour, Route 66, Naked City, The Defenders, The Dupont Show of the Week, East Side/West Side, and Brenner.\n\nHackman began performing in several Off-Broadway plays, starting with The Saintliness of Margery Kempe in 1959 and including Come to the Palace of Sin in 1963.\n\nIn 1963 he made his Broadway debut in Children From Their Games which only had a short run as did A Rainy Day in Newark. However Any Wednesday with actress Sandy Dennis was a huge Broadway success in 1964. This opened the door to film work. His first credited role was in Lilith, with Jean Seberg and Warren Beatty in the leading roles.\n\nHackman returned to Broadway in Poor Richard (1964–65) by Jean Kerr, which ran for over a hundred performances. He continued to do television - The Trials of O'Brien, Hawk, The F.B.I. - and had a small part as Dr. John Whipple in the epic film Hawaii. He had small roles in features like First to Fight (1967), A Covenant with Death (1967) and Banning (1967).\n\nHackman was originally cast as Mr. Robinson in the 1967 Mike Nichols film The Graduate, but Nichols fired him three weeks into rehearsal for being \"too young\" for the role; he was replaced by Murray Hamilton.[21]\n\nIn 1967 he appeared in an episode of the television series The Invaders entitled \"The Spores\".\n\nBonnie and Clyde\n\n[edit]\n\nAnother supporting role, Buck Barrow in 1967's Bonnie and Clyde,[12] earned him an Academy Award nomination as Best Supporting Actor.\n\nA return to Broadway, The Natural Look (1967) only ran for one performance. He did Fragments and The Basement Off Broadway the same year.\n\nHackman was in episodes of Iron Horse (\"Leopards Try, But Leopards Can't\") and Insight (\"Confrontation\"), In 1968, he appeared in an episode of I Spy, in the role of \"Hunter\", in the episode \"Happy Birthday... Everybody\". That same year he starred in the CBS Playhouse episode \"My Father and My Mother\" and the dystopian television film Shadow on the Land.[22]\n\nIn 1969 he played a ski coach in Downhill Racer and an astronaut in Marooned. Also that year, he played a member of a barnstorming skydiving team that entertained mostly at county fairs, a film which also inspired many to pursue skydiving and has a cult-like status amongst skydivers as a result: The Gypsy Moths. Hackman supported Jim Brown in two films, The Split (1968) and Riot (1969),\n\nHackman nearly accepted the role of Mike Brady for the TV series The Brady Bunch,[23] but his agent advised that he decline it in exchange for a more promising role, which he did.\n\n1970s and stardom\n\n[edit]\n\nHackman was nominated for a second Best Supporting Actor Academy Award for his role in I Never Sang for My Father (1970). He starred in Doctors' Wives (1971), The Hunting Party (1971) then won the Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance as New York City Detective Jimmy \"Popeye\" Doyle in The French Connection (1971), marking his graduation to stardom.[12]\n\nAfter The French Connection, Hackman starred in ten films (not including his cameo in Young Frankenstein) over the next three years, making him the most prolific actor in Hollywood during that time frame. He followed The French Connection with leading roles in Cisco Pike (1972), and Prime Cut (1972) then was in the disaster film The Poseidon Adventure (1972) and Francis Ford Coppola's The Conversation (1974), which was nominated for several Oscars, and won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival.[12] That same year, Hackman appeared in what would become one of his most famous comedic roles, as Harold the Blind Man in Young Frankenstein.[24] Hackman also appeared in Scarecrow (1973) alongside Al Pacino, Zandy's Bride (1974) and Night Moves (1975) for director Arthur Penn.\n\nHackman played one of Teddy Roosevelt's former Rough Riders in the Western horse-race saga Bite the Bullet (1975). He reprised his Oscar-winning role as Doyle in the sequel French Connection II (1975), and co-starred with Burt Reynolds and Liza Minnelli in Lucky Lady (1975), a notorious flop. After making The Domino Principle (1977) for Stanley Kramer, Hackman was part of an all-star cast in the war film A Bridge Too Far (1977), playing Polish General Stanisław Sosabowski, and was an officer in the French Foreign Legion in March or Die (1977.)\n\nHackman showed a talent for both comedy and the \"slow burn\" as criminal mastermind Lex Luthor in Superman: The Movie (1978), a role he would reprise in its 1980 and 1987 sequels.\n\n1980s\n\n[edit]\n\nHackman alternated between leading and supporting roles during the 1980s. He appeared opposite Barbra Streisand in All Night Long (1981) and supported Warren Beatty in Reds (1981). He played the lead in Eureka (1983) and a support in Under Fire (1983). Hackman provided the voice of God in Two of a Kind (1983) and starred in Uncommon Valor (1983), Misunderstood (1984), Twice in a Lifetime (1985), Target (1985) for Arthur Penn, and Power (1986). Between 1985 and 1988, he starred in nine films, making him the busiest actor, alongside Steve Guttenberg.[26]\n\nHackman played a high school basketball coach in Hoosiers (1986), which a 2008 American Film Institute poll named the fourth-greatest sports film of all time.[27] After Superman IV: The Quest for Peace (1987) where Hackman also voiced Nuclear Man (who was portrayed by Mark Pillow), Hackman was in No Way Out (1987), Split Decisions (1988), Bat*21 (1988), Full Moon in Blue Water (1988), and Another Woman (1988) from Woody Allen.\n\nHackman starred in Mississippi Burning (1988), where he was nominated for a second Best Actor Oscar.[28] After this he was in The Package (1989).\n\n1990s\n\n[edit]\n\nHackman starred in Loose Cannons (1990) with Dan Aykroyd, and he had a supporting role in Postcards from the Edge (1990). He appeared with Anne Archer in Narrow Margin (1990), a remake of the 1952 film The Narrow Margin.\n\nAfter Class Action (1991) and Company Business (1991) Hackman played the sadistic sheriff \"Little Bill\" Daggett in the Western Unforgiven directed by Clint Eastwood and written by David Webb Peoples. Hackman had pledged to avoid violent roles, but Eastwood convinced him to take the part, which earned him a second Oscar, this time for Best Supporting Actor. The film also won Best Picture.[12]\n\nIn 1993, he appeared in Geronimo: An American Legend as Brigadier General George Crook, and co-starred with Tom Cruise as a corrupt lawyer in The Firm, a legal thriller based on the John Grisham novel of the same name. Hackman would appear in two other films based on John Grisham novels, playing convict Sam Cayhall on death row in The Chamber (1996), and jury consultant Rankin Fitch in Runaway Jury (2003).\n\nOther notable films Hackman appeared in during the 1990s include Wyatt Earp (1994) (as Nicholas Porter Earp, Wyatt Earp's father), The Quick and the Dead (1995) opposite Sharon Stone, Leonardo DiCaprio and Russell Crowe, and as submarine Captain Frank Ramsey alongside Denzel Washington in Crimson Tide (1995).\n\nHackman played film director Harry Zimm with John Travolta in the comedy-drama Get Shorty (1995). In 1996, he took a comedic turn as conservative Senator Kevin Keeley in The Birdcage with Robin Williams and Nathan Lane.[29] He co-starred with Hugh Grant in Extreme Measures (1996) and reunited with Clint Eastwood in Absolute Power (1997). Hackman did Twilight (1998) with Paul Newman for director Robert Benton, did one of the voices for Antz (1998) and co-starred with Will Smith in Enemy of the State (1998), his character reminiscent of the one he had portrayed in The Conversation.\n\n2000s\n\n[edit]\n\nHackman co-starred with Morgan Freeman in Under Suspicion (2000), Keanu Reeves in The Replacements (2000), Owen Wilson in Behind Enemy Lines (2001), Sigourney Weaver in Heartbreakers (2001) and appeared in the David Mamet crime thriller Heist (2001),[30] as an aging professional thief of considerable skill who is forced into one final job. He made a cameo in The Mexican (2001).\n\nHackman gained much critical acclaim playing against type as the head of an eccentric family in Wes Anderson's comedy film The Royal Tenenbaums (2001), for which he received the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Motion Picture Musical or Comedy. In 2003, he also starred in another John Grisham legal drama, Runaway Jury, at long last getting to make a picture with his long-time friend Dustin Hoffman.\n\nIn 2004, Hackman appeared alongside Ray Romano in the comedy Welcome to Mooseport, his final film acting role to date.[31]\n\nHackman was honored with the Cecil B. DeMille Award from the Golden Globe Awards for his \"outstanding contribution to the entertainment field\" in 2003.[32]\n\nRetirement from acting\n\n[edit]\n\nOn July 7, 2004, Hackman gave a rare interview to Larry King, where he announced that he had no future film projects lined up and believed his acting career was over.[citation needed] In 2008, while promoting his third novel, he confirmed that he had retired from acting.[33]\n\nSpeaking on his retirement in 2020, Hackman said:\n\n\"The straw that broke the camel’s back was actually a stress test that I took in New York. The doctor advised me that my heart wasn’t in the kind of shape that I should be putting it under any stress\"[34]\n\nWhen asked during a GQ interview in 2011 if he would ever come out of retirement to do one more film, he said he might consider it \"if I could do it in my own house, maybe, without them disturbing anything and just one or two people.\"[35] He briefly came out of retirement to narrate two documentaries related to the Marine Corps: The Unknown Flag Raiser of Iwo Jima (2016)[36] and We, the Marines (2017).[37]\n\nWriting\n\n[edit]\n\nTogether with undersea archaeologist Daniel Lenihan, Hackman has written three historical fiction novels: Wake of the Perdido Star (1999),[38] a sea adventure of the 19th century; Justice for None (2004),[39] a Depression-era tale of murder; and Escape from Andersonville (2008) about a prison escape during the American Civil War.[40] His first solo effort, a story of love and revenge set in the Old West titled Payback at Morning Peak, was released in 2011.[41] His most recent novel Pursuit, a police thriller, followed in 2013.\n\nIn 2011, Hackman appeared on the Fox Sports Radio show The Loose Cannons, where he discussed his career and his novels with Pat O'Brien, Steve Hartman, and Vic \"The Brick\" Jacobs.\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nMarriages and family\n\n[edit]\n\nHackman has been married twice. He has three children from his first marriage.\n\nIn 1956, Hackman married Faye Maltese (1929–2017),[42][43] with whom he had one son and two daughters: Christopher Allen, Elizabeth Jean, and Leslie Anne Hackman.[44] He was often out on location making films while the children were growing up.[45] The couple divorced in 1986, after three decades of marriage.[46]\n\nIn 1991, he married classical pianist Betsy Arakawa (b. 1961).[47] They share a Santa Fe, New Mexico home,[48] which Architectural Digest featured in 1990. At the time, the home blended Southwestern styles and crested a twelve-acre hilltop, with a 360-degree view that stretched to the Colorado mountains. As of 2022 , Hackman continues to attend Santa Fe cultural events.[49]\n\nPolitical views\n\n[edit]\n\nHackman is a supporter of the Democratic Party, and was \"proud\" to be included on Nixon's Enemies List. However, he has spoken fondly of Republican president Ronald Reagan.[50]\n\nInterests\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the late 1970s, Hackman competed in Sports Car Club of America races, driving an open-wheeled Formula Ford.[51][52] In 1983, he drove a Dan Gurney Team Toyota in the 24 Hours of Daytona Endurance Race.[53] He also won the Long Beach Grand Prix Celebrity Race.[54]\n\nHackman is a fan of the Jacksonville Jaguars and regularly attended Jaguars games as a guest of former head coach Jack Del Rio.[55][56] Their friendship goes back to Del Rio's playing days at the University of Southern California.[57]\n\nArchitecture and design are another of Hackman's interests. As of 1990, he had created ten homes, two of which were featured in Architectural Digest. After a period of time, he moves onto another house restoration. \"I don't know what's wrong with me,\" he remarked, \"I guess I like the process, and when it's over, it's over.\"[48][58]\n\nAs of 2018, Hackman remains an active cyclist.[59]\n\nHealth\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1990, Hackman underwent an angioplasty.[60] In 2012, 82-year-old Hackman was struck by a pickup truck while bicycling in the Florida Keys. Although it was initially reported that he had suffered serious head trauma, his publicist stated that his injury was nothing more than \"bumps and bruises\".[61]\n\nFilmography\n\n[edit]\n\nFilm\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Title Role Notes 1961 Mad Dog Coll Policeman Uncredited 1964 Lilith Norman 1966 Hawaii John Whipple 1967 Banning Tommy Del Gaddo Community Shelter Planning Donald Ross, Regional Civil Defense Officer Short film Alfred Harmsworth First to Fight Sergeant Tweed Bonnie and Clyde Buck Barrow 1968 Lieutenant Walter Brill 1969 Riot 'Red' Fraker Joe Browdy Downhill Racer Eugene Claire Marooned 'Buzz' Lloyd 1970 I Never Sang for My Father Gene Garrison 1971 Doctors' Wives Dave Randolph Brandt Ruger NYPD Detective Jimmy 'Popeye' Doyle 1972 Prime Cut Mary Ann Reverend Frank Scott Cisco Pike Sergeant Leo Holland 1973 Scarecrow Max Millan 1974 Harry Caul Young Frankenstein Harold, The Blind Man Zandy's Bride Zandy Allan 1975 French Connection II NYPD Detective Jimmy 'Popeye' Doyle Lucky Lady Kibby Womack Night Moves Harry Moseby Bite the Bullet Sam Clayton 1977 Roy Tucker Major General Stanisław Sosabowski March or Die Major William Sherman Foster 1978 Superman Lex Luthor 1980 Superman II 1981 All Night Long George Dupler Reds Pete Van Wherry 1983 Under Fire Alex Grazier Two of a Kind God Voice, uncredited Uncommon Valor Colonel Jason Rhodes, USMC (Ret.)
