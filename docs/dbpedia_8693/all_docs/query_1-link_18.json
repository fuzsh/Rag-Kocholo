        "text": "An American actor and writer born in California on January 30, 1930, of German and Scottish descent. He grew up in a poor house and at the age of sixteen, he joined the United States Marine Corps. After leaving the army, he moved to New York where he worked a number of simple jobs before studying journalism and production. He worked in the theaters of New York since 1960, and in 1964 he was chosen to participate in the play Any Wednesday on Broadway, a role that allowed him to work in cinema in the movie Lilith. In the same year, he participated in many movies, most notably Unforgiven, and Extreme Measures. He decided to retire from acting in 2004, where his last movie was Welcome to Mooseport."
