        "text": "Bella Hadid, Dr. Oz and DJ Khaled. What do these celebrities all have in common? They're Muslim. There are more than 1 billion Muslims in the world including some of the most popular and successful actors, rappers, models, sports heroes, political activists and more. Keep reading to see what these celebrities had to say about being a part of the Islamic faith.\n\nDr. Oz\n\nDr. Mehmet Oz is a cardiothoracic surgeon at New York-Presbyterian Hospital, as well as an author and the host of the popular health and wellness TV series, \"The Dr. Oz Show.\" The Turkish-American doctor is also a Muslim.\n\nIn an interview with PBS, Dr. Oz explained that his father comes from Turkey's \"Quran Belt\" and his mother was a secular Turk.\n\n\"You know, I've struggled a lot with my Muslim identity,\" he explained. \"As a Turk, growing up in America with one parent from one side of the religious wall and one parent from the other side, and of course America clearly supporting the secular background, I found myself tugged more and more towards the spiritual side of the religion, rather than the legal side of the religion.\"\n\nZayn Malik\n\nThe former One Direction band member was raised Muslim by his mother, who converted to the religion, and his British-Pakistani father.\n\nIn 2018 the singer told Vogue that he no longer considers himself to be a follower of the Islamic faith. \"With my mum and dad, they were always there to educate us â€“ I did go to mosque, I did study Islam,\" Malik said. \"But they gave us the option so you could choose for yourself.\"\n\nBella Hadid\n\nIn 2017 the model marched in protest of President Trump's executive order seeking to halt refugees and visitors from seven predominantly Muslim countries. Hadid later told Porter magazine that she protested in honor of her heritage and her religion.\n\n\"My dad was a refugee when he first came to America, so it's actually very close to home for my sister and brother and me,\" Hadid said. \"He was always religious, and he always prayed with us. I am proud to be a Muslim.\"\n\nRamy Youssef\n\nYoussef is the creator and star of the Hulu series \"Ramy.\" The dark comedy is loosely based on Youssef's life as a first-generation Muslim American millennial and the struggles that come with balancing those identities.\n\n\"You sit in contradictions,\" he told NPR. \"That has been the space that I'm trying to navigate. And that's kind of the space that I bring to the work.\"\n\nHis acting performance on the show earned him a Golden Globe award in 2020.\n\nHasan Minhaj\n\nThe \"Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj\" host has said that he identifies as Muslim but that his identity is also informed by many things. \"Like, just 'cause I'm Muslim â€“ that doesn't mean I can't do yoga, even though that's, like, a Hindu practice, comes from Hinduism,\" he told NPR in 2020.\n\n\"Like, any of these things that have come from, you know, other cultures and religious practices or beliefs â€“ like, if it makes if it vibes with me. I'm with it, you know? I'm kind of like PlayStation 3. Like, you know how it's backwards compatible? I'll play the other games.\"\n\nRiz Ahmed\n\nAhmed has frequently spoken out about the realities of being Muslim in western countries. While leading a discussion during a diversity leadership event in California, Ahmed, who was born in Britain and has acted in TV series such as \"The OA,\" \"The Night Of\" and \"Girls,\" said \"I'm basically here to ask for your help, because it's really scary to be a Muslim right now, super scary.\"\n\n\"I've often wondered, is this going to be the year when they round us up, if this is going to be the year they put Trump's registry into action. If this is going to be the year they ship us all off.\"\n\nShohreh Aghdashloo\n\nThe Iranian-American actress was born into a Muslim family. In a 2013 interview with the Los Angeles Times, Aghdashloo speculated that her Muslim identity may have cost her a film role. Although director George Nolfi wanted her for the role of God in the 2011 thriller \"The Adjustment Bureau,\" she was let go.\n\n\"I say I was born a Muslim. I don't introduce myself as a Muslim woman, but I guess the distribution company put the dots together and felt it's too early for this,\" Aghdashloo said.\n\nDJ Khaled\n\nThe Grammy Award-winning music producer is proud to be Muslim. \"It's life for me. I was born Muslim, my family raised me Muslim. It's beautiful, it's amazing, it's incredible and it has put so many blessings upon me and my family,\" he told Esquire in 2018.\n\n\"My faith has helped make me the man I am right now, with the love and the respect that I put out there. I love anybody that loves God. That's what I am about.\"\n\nAasif Mandvi\n\nThe \"Evil\" star told The Hollywood Reporter, \"I grew up as a Muslim, but I've been in more bars than mosques in my life.\"\n\n\"I feel like there's a moment in the history of this country, and American Muslims do need to speak out. It's a privilege in a way to be an American Muslim speaking in whatever way I can at this time in history, when it's so crucial.\"\n\nRaekwon\n\nThe American rapper converted to Islam in 2009. Raekwon, born Corey Woods, was asked by GQ in 2017 if he was keeping up with news of the Trump administration's \"travel ban\" on refugees and visitors from seven predominantly Muslim countries.\n\n\"Allah... he's going to let it be what it be, and whenever he wants to fix it, he's going to fix it,\" the Wu-Tang Clan rapper said. \"Right now, I'm just focusing on my children, my career and really just letting it be what it's going to be, at the end of the day it'll work itself out.\"\n\nMahershala Ali\n\nAli converted to Islam in 2000. During the 2017 Screen Actors Guild Awards, the \"Moonlight\" star gave a passionate speech about the importance of loving each other despite our differences.\n\n\"My mother is an ordained minister, I'm a Muslim. She didn't do backflips when I called her to tell her I converted 17 years ago,\" he said. \"But I tell you now, we put things to the side, I'm able to see her, she's able to see me, we love each other, the love has grown. That stuff is minutiae. It's not that important.\"\n\nAli is also the first Muslim actor to win an Academy Award.\n\nIrrfan Khan\n\nIndian actor Sahabzade Irrfan Ali Khan, known professionally as Irrfan Khan or just Irrfan, appeared in a number of major Hollywood and Bollywood films. Khan was born in Jaipur, India, and raised a Muslim.\n\nKhan died in April 2020.\n\nIn 2016 Khan faced criticism for speaking out about the Islamic practice qurbani, which is the ritual sacrificing of animals.\n\n\"The meaning of qurbani is to sacrifice something which is close to you instead of any goat or sheep which you just buy to sacrifice,\" he told the Deccan Herald.\n\n\"Before sacrificing we should share a bond with that thing otherwise just killing of an animal will not serve the purpose. Nowadays we have lost the relevance behind such religious activities and perform these rituals without knowing the meaning.\"\n\nShaquille O'Neal\n\nShaquille O'Neal played for six different teams over the course of his 19-year NBA career, most notably the Orlando Magic, the L.A. Lakers and the Miami Heat. The talented 7-foot-1-inch center led his teams to four NBA Championships and was a 15-time NBA All-Star.\n\nWhen asked in a 2010 interview who he thought the best center of all time was, Shaq answered, \"Another Muslim brother, Hakeem Olajuwon.\" He then confirmed his plans to visit Turkey and one day undertake the Muslim pilgrimage, called the Hajj.\n\nThe video of the interview has since been removed from YouTube and it is not clear if O'Neal still practices the faith.\n\nMuhammad Ali\n\nLegendary heavyweight boxing champion Muhammad Ali â€“ born Cassius Clay in Louisville, Kentucky â€“ converted to Islam in the 1960s and was a devout Muslim.\n\nIn a December 2015 statement, he spoke out against extremism, saying: \"True Muslims know that the ruthless violence of so called Islamic Jihadists goes against the very tenets of our religion...
