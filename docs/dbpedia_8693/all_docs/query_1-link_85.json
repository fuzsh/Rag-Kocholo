Having many distant relatives in the same location suggests that you may all share common ancestry there. Locations with many distant relatives can also be places where people have migrated recently, such as large cities. If a large number of individuals who share your surname have distant relatives in a specific area, it could indicate a connection between your surname and that location, stemming from either recent ancestral ties or migration.\n\nBased on 23andMe data, people with last name Hackman have recent ancestry locations in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and Ireland.\n\nRECENT ANCESTRY LocationPercentageWest Midlands , United Kingdom67.00 %West Yorkshire , United Kingdom67.00 %Lancashire , United Kingdom67.00 %Merseyside , United Kingdom67.00 %Glasgow City , United Kingdom67.00 %\n\nWhat Hackman haplogroups can tell you\n\nHaplogroups are genetic population groups that share a common ancestor on either your paternal or maternal line. These paternal and maternal haplogroups shed light on your genetic ancestry and help tell the story of your family.\n\nThe top paternal haplogroup of people with the surname Hackman is O-F2415, which is predominantly found among people with East Asian & Indigenous American ancestry. Haplogroup O-F2415 is descended from haplogroup O-M1359. Other common haplogroups include E-M183 and O-F2859, which are predominantly found among people with European and East Asian & Indigenous American ancestry.\n\nThe most common maternal haplogroups of people with Hackman surname are: H1, H, T2. These most commonly trace back to individuals of European ancestry.\n\nYour paternal lineage may be linked to the Cham\n\nOne of the many populations harboring members of haplogroup O1b1a1a1a1 is the Cham ethnic group, a group of people who speak Austronesian languages in Mainland Southeast Asia. Austronesian languages make up a language family that is extremely large and widespread, comprising over 350 million people on islands such as Madagascar, Easter Island, and many others. However, Austronesian languages are less common on mainland Asia, with a notable exception being the Chamic language. Research suggests that ancestors of the Cham people migrated from Southeast Asian islands to the mainland around the year 500 BCE, and that early Cham populations quickly began mixing with indigenous southern Vietnamese populations. As a result, the Chamic language now has words that were borrowed from languages spoken by indigenous Vietnamese people. It is likely that an ancestral Kinh population was one of the populations that mixed with the Cham people shortly after their migration to mainland Asia.\n\nYour maternal lineage may be linked to Marie Antoinette\n\nBecause it is so dominant in the general European population, haplogroup H also appears quite frequently in the continent's royal houses. Marie Antoinette, an Austrian Hapsburg who married into the French royal family, inherited the haplogroup from her maternal ancestors. So did Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, whose recorded genealogy traces his female line to Bavaria. Scientists also discovered that famed 16th century astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus traced his maternal lineages to haplogroup H."
