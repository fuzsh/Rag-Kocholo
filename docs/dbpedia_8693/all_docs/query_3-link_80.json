        "text": "You want to leave the admissions tutor reading your personal statement with a strong lasting impression – one that will leave them no choice but to make you an offer (or invite you to an interview).\n\nThere are several ways you can do this.\n\nHE Careers Adviser Liz says:\n\nA good ending can link back to what you claim at the beginning or be a short summary as to what you’re looking forward to at university, new challenges etc… or even your commitment as to why you would be an ideal candidate (without bragging).\n\nRead more here about how to begin a personal statement. Then follow our tips on how to bring it all together at the end.\n\nA key academic skill at degree level is being able to form a structured written argument, including a conclusion that summarises the key points.\n\nAs Liverpool student Joseph says:\n\nYou don’t want a conclusion in the same way as you would for an essay, as that’s just taking away from your word count. Don’t draw it out.’\n\nIn other words, keep it to the point and punchy.\n\nThere’s no set way to end your statement. Instead, think about the following and how it might help you to stand out:\n\nTie it back to what you’ve written earlier\n\nRevisit the key points you’ve already spoken about in the main body of your personal statement and emphasise them again in your conclusion. This could be reiterating key skills, interests, and experiences you’ve already touched on, giving them one last chance to hit home (but don’t just regurgitate what you’ve already said).\n\nTalk about the future\n\nLooking to the future is an optimistic way to finish. It shows you’re goal-oriented, and you’ve carefully thought about how this course fits into your plans. You don’t need to have the next ten years mapped out, but if you’ve a broad sense of your career path – or any related life ambitions you want to fill – it’s worth mentioning them here, as well as how this course will help you achieve those.\n\nLearn more about career prospects for your subject (and more) in our subject guides.\n\nThink about your university experience\n\nYou could conclude by talking more generally about what you want to get from your overall university experience. For instance:\n\nWould you like to build your confidence meeting people from a variety of backgrounds?\n\nAre you hoping to engage with a local community through a mutual passion or vocation?\n\nAlso, talk about how you will be an asset to a university.\n\nRemember, all of your UCAS choices will see your personal statement, so it may be best to keep it general, rather than being specific about one university."
