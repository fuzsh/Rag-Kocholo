        "text": "The United States Capitol\n\n11:52 AM EST\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Chief Justice Roberts, Vice President Harris, Speaker Pelosi, Leader Schumer, Leader McConnell, Vice President Pence, distinguished guests, and my fellow Americans.\n\nThis is America’s day.\n\nThis is democracy’s day.\n\nA day of history and hope.\n\nOf renewal and resolve.\n\nThrough a crucible for the ages America has been tested anew and America has risen to the challenge.\n\nToday, we celebrate the triumph not of a candidate, but of a cause, the cause of democracy.\n\nThe will of the people has been heard and the will of the people has been heeded.\n\nWe have learned again that democracy is precious.\n\nDemocracy is fragile.\n\nAnd at this hour, my friends, democracy has prevailed.\n\nSo now, on this hallowed ground where just days ago violence sought to shake this Capitol’s very foundation, we come together as one nation, under God, indivisible, to carry out the peaceful transfer of power as we have for more than two centuries.\n\nWe look ahead in our uniquely American way – restless, bold, optimistic – and set our sights on the nation we know we can be and we must be.\n\nI thank my predecessors of both parties for their presence here.\n\nI thank them from the bottom of my heart.\n\nYou know the resilience of our Constitution and the strength of our nation.\n\nAs does President Carter, who I spoke to last night but who cannot be with us today, but whom we salute for his lifetime of service.\n\nI have just taken the sacred oath each of these patriots took — an oath first sworn by George Washington.\n\nBut the American story depends not on any one of us, not on some of us, but on all of us.\n\nOn “We the People” who seek a more perfect Union.\n\nThis is a great nation and we are a good people.\n\nOver the centuries through storm and strife, in peace and in war, we have come so far. But we still have far to go.\n\nWe will press forward with speed and urgency, for we have much to do in this winter of peril and possibility.\n\nMuch to repair.\n\nMuch to restore.\n\nMuch to heal.\n\nMuch to build.\n\nAnd much to gain.\n\nFew periods in our nation’s history have been more challenging or difficult than the one we’re in now.\n\nA once-in-a-century virus silently stalks the country.\n\nIt’s taken as many lives in one year as America lost in all of World War II.\n\nMillions of jobs have been lost.\n\nHundreds of thousands of businesses closed.\n\nA cry for racial justice some 400 years in the making moves us. The dream of justice for all will be deferred no longer.\n\nA cry for survival comes from the planet itself. A cry that can’t be any more desperate or any more clear.\n\nAnd now, a rise in political extremism, white supremacy, domestic terrorism that we must confront and we will defeat.\n\nTo overcome these challenges – to restore the soul and to secure the future of America – requires more than words.\n\nIt requires that most elusive of things in a democracy:\n\nUnity.\n\nUnity.\n\nIn another January in Washington, on New Year’s Day 1863, Abraham Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation.\n\nWhen he put pen to paper, the President said, “If my name ever goes down into history it will be for this act and my whole soul is in it.”\n\nMy whole soul is in it.\n\nToday, on this January day, my whole soul is in this:\n\nBringing America together.\n\nUniting our people.\n\nAnd uniting our nation.\n\nI ask every American to join me in this cause.\n\nUniting to fight the common foes we face:\n\nAnger, resentment, hatred.\n\nExtremism, lawlessness, violence.\n\nDisease, joblessness, hopelessness.\n\nWith unity we can do great things. Important things.\n\nWe can right wrongs.\n\nWe can put people to work in good jobs.\n\nWe can teach our children in safe schools.\n\nWe can overcome this deadly virus.\n\nWe can reward work, rebuild the middle class, and make health care\n\nsecure for all.\n\nWe can deliver racial justice.\n\nWe can make America, once again, the leading force for good in the world.\n\nI know speaking of unity can sound to some like a foolish fantasy.\n\nI know the forces that divide us are deep and they are real.\n\nBut I also know they are not new.\n\nOur history has been a constant struggle between the American ideal that we are all created equal and the harsh, ugly reality that racism, nativism, fear, and demonization have long torn us apart.\n\nThe battle is perennial.\n\nVictory is never assured.\n\nThrough the Civil War, the Great Depression, World War, 9/11, through struggle, sacrifice, and setbacks, our “better angels” have always prevailed.\n\nIn each of these moments, enough of us came together to carry all of us forward.\n\nAnd, we can do so now.\n\nHistory, faith, and reason show the way, the way of unity.\n\nWe can see each other not as adversaries but as neighbors.\n\nWe can treat each other with dignity and respect.\n\nWe can join forces, stop the shouting, and lower the temperature.\n\nFor without unity, there is no peace, only bitterness and fury.\n\nNo progress, only exhausting outrage.\n\nNo nation, only a state of chaos.\n\nThis is our historic moment of crisis and challenge, and unity is the path forward.\n\nAnd, we must meet this moment as the United States of America.\n\nIf we do that, I guarantee you, we will not fail.\n\nWe have never, ever, ever failed in America when we have acted together.\n\nAnd so today, at this time and in this place, let us start afresh.\n\nAll of us.\n\nLet us listen to one another.\n\nHear one another.\n\nSee one another.\n\nShow respect to one another.\n\nPolitics need not be a raging fire destroying everything in its path.\n\nEvery disagreement doesn’t have to be a cause for total war.\n\nAnd, we must reject a culture in which facts themselves are manipulated and even manufactured.\n\nMy fellow Americans, we have to be different than this.\n\nAmerica has to be better than this.\n\nAnd, I believe America is better than this.\n\nJust look around.\n\nHere we stand, in the shadow of a Capitol dome that was completed amid the Civil War, when the Union itself hung in the balance.\n\nYet we endured and we prevailed.\n\nHere we stand looking out to the great Mall where Dr. King spoke of his dream.\n\nHere we stand, where 108 years ago at another inaugural, thousands of protestors tried to block brave women from marching for the right to vote.\n\nToday, we mark the swearing-in of the first woman in American history elected to national office – Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nDon’t tell me things can’t change.\n\nHere we stand across the Potomac from Arlington National Cemetery, where heroes who gave the last full measure of devotion rest in eternal peace.\n\nAnd here we stand, just days after a riotous mob thought they could use violence to silence the will of the people, to stop the work of our democracy, and to drive us from this sacred ground.\n\nThat did not happen.\n\nIt will never happen.\n\nNot today.\n\nNot tomorrow.\n\nNot ever.\n\nTo all those who supported our campaign I am humbled by the faith you have placed in us.\n\nTo all those who did not support us, let me say this: Hear me out as we move forward. Take a measure of me and my heart.\n\nAnd if you still disagree, so be it.\n\nThat’s democracy. That’s America. The right to dissent peaceably, within the guardrails of our Republic, is perhaps our nation’s greatest strength.\n\nYet hear me clearly: Disagreement must not lead to disunion.\n\nAnd I pledge this to you: I will be a President for all Americans.\n\nI will fight as hard for those who did not support me as for those who did.\n\nMany centuries ago, Saint Augustine, a saint of my church, wrote that a people was a multitude defined by the common objects of their love.\n\nWhat are the common objects we love that define us as Americans?\n\nI think I know.\n\nOpportunity.\n\nSecurity.\n\nLiberty.\n\nDignity.\n\nRespect.\n\nHonor.\n\nAnd, yes, the truth.\n\nRecent weeks and months have taught us a painful lesson.\n\nThere is truth and there are lies.\n\nLies told for power and for profit.\n\nAnd each of us has a duty and responsibility, as citizens, as Americans, and especially as leaders – leaders who have pledged to honor our Constitution and protect our nation — to defend the truth and to defeat the lies.\n\nI understand that many Americans view the future with some fear and trepidation.\n\nI understand they worry about their jobs, about taking care of their families, about what comes next.\n\nI get it.\n\nBut the answer is not to turn inward, to retreat into competing factions, distrusting those who don’t look like you do, or worship the way you do, or don’t get their news from the same sources you do.\n\nWe must end this uncivil war that pits red against blue, rural versus urban, conservative versus liberal.\n\nWe can do this if we open our souls instead of hardening our hearts.\n\nIf we show a little tolerance and humility.\n\nIf we’re willing to stand in the other person’s shoes just for a moment.\n\nBecause here is the thing about life: There is no accounting for what fate will deal you.\n\nThere are some days when we need a hand.\n\nThere are other days when we’re called on to lend one.\n\nThat is how we must be with one another.\n\nAnd, if we are this way, our country will be stronger, more prosperous, more ready for the future.\n\nMy fellow Americans, in the work ahead of us, we will need each other.\n\nWe will need all our strength to persevere through this dark winter.\n\nWe are entering what may well be the toughest and deadliest period of the virus.\n\nWe must set aside the politics and finally face this pandemic as one nation.\n\nI promise you this: as the Bible says weeping may endure for a night but joy cometh in the morning.\n\nWe will get through this, together\n\nThe world is watching today.\n\nSo here is my message to those beyond our borders: America has been tested and we have come out stronger for it.\n\nWe will repair our alliances and engage with the world once again.\n\nNot to meet yesterday’s challenges, but today’s and tomorrow’s.\n\nWe will lead not merely by the example of our power but by the power of our example.\n\nWe will be a strong and trusted partner for peace, progress, and security.\n\nWe have been through so much in this nation.\n\nAnd, in my first act as President, I would like to ask you to join me in a moment of silent prayer to remember all those we lost this past year to the pandemic.\n\nTo those 400,000 fellow Americans – mothers and fathers, husbands and wives, sons and daughters, friends, neighbors, and co-workers.\n\nWe will honor them by becoming the people and nation we know we can and should be.\n\nLet us say a silent prayer for those who lost their lives, for those they left behind, and for our country.\n\nAmen.\n\nThis is a time of testing.\n\nWe face an attack on democracy and on truth.\n\nA raging virus.\n\nGrowing inequity.\n\nThe sting of systemic racism.\n\nA climate in crisis.\n\nAmerica’s role in the world.\n\nAny one of these would be enough to challenge us in profound ways.\n\nBut the fact is we face them all at once, presenting this nation with the gravest of responsibilities.\n\nNow we must step up.\n\nAll of us.\n\nIt is a time for boldness, for there is so much to do.\n\nAnd, this is certain.\n\nWe will be judged, you and I, for how we resolve the cascading crises of our era.\n\nWill we rise to the occasion?\n\nWill we master this rare and difficult hour?\n\nWill we meet our obligations and pass along a new and better world for our children?\n\nI believe we must and I believe we will.\n\nAnd when we do, we will write the next chapter in the American story.\n\nIt’s a story that might sound something like a song that means a lot to me.\n\nIt’s called “American Anthem” and there is one verse stands out for me:\n\n“The work and prayers\n\nof centuries have brought us to this day\n\nWhat shall be our legacy?\n\nWhat will our children say?…\n\nLet me know in my heart\n\nWhen my days are through\n\nAmerica\n\nAmerica\n\nI gave my best to you.”\n\nLet us add our own work and prayers to the unfolding story of our nation.\n\nIf we do this then when our days are through our children and our children’s children will say of us they gave their best.\n\nThey did their duty.\n\nThey healed a broken land.\n\nMy fellow Americans, I close today where I began, with a sacred oath.\n\nBefore God and all of you I give you my word.\n\nI will always level with you.\n\nI will defend the Constitution.\n\nI will defend our democracy.\n\nI will defend America.\n\nI will give my all in your service thinking not of power, but of possibilities.\n\nNot of personal interest, but of the public good.\n\nAnd together, we shall write an American story of hope, not fear.\n\nOf unity, not division.\n\nOf light, not darkness.\n\nAn American story of decency and dignity.\n\nOf love and of healing.\n\nOf greatness and of goodness.\n\nMay this be the story that guides us.\n\nThe story that inspires us.\n\nThe story that tells ages yet to come that we answered the call of history.\n\nWe met the moment.\n\nThat democracy and hope, truth and justice, did not die on our watch but thrived.\n\nThat our America secured liberty at home and stood once again as a beacon to the world.\n\nThat is what we owe our forebearers, one another, and generations to follow.\n\nSo, with purpose and resolve we turn to the tasks of our time.\n\nSustained by faith.\n\nDriven by conviction.\n\nAnd, devoted to one another and to this country we love with all our hearts.\n\nMay God bless America and may God protect our troops.\n\nThank you, America.\n\nEND\n\n12:13 pm EST"
