        "text": "Gene Hackman has been seen out in public for the first time in years and continues to sport a healthy look.\n\nThe reclusive actor, 93, hasn't starred in a film in almost two decades and is rarely spotted out and about.\n\nHowever, the Hollywood icon seemed in good health and spirits after being snapped near his home in Santa Fe, New Mexico, at the weekend.\n\nGene is a legend in the film industry with over 100 credits to the name, including huge hits such as Enemy of the State, Crimson Tide, No Way Out and The French Connection.\n\nIt appeared as thought he is still very much fit and active as he got to grips with the yard work on Sunday. He was photographed getting stuck into his chores with a shovel in hand.\n\nHe was also seen enjoying a bite to eat in his car after taking a trip to a Wendy's drive-thru, before his busy day saw him take to the petrol station to fill up his vehicle and grab an instant coffee.\n\nHe sported an active outfit as he dressed in a fleece sweater over a long grey shirt. He paired the look with blue jeans, a pair of black trainer and a khaki-coloured baseball cap.\n\nThe actor made sure he had his sunglasses ready to protect him from the sun and placed them casually on the top of his hat.\n\nHis wispy grey hairs could be seen coming out the back of his cap and tucked behind his ears, while he still sported his usual styled moustache.\n\nThe last time Gene was seen in front of the camera was in the 2004 comedy Welcome To Mooseport. He filmed alongside Ray Romano and Christine Baranski for the flick before later announcing his time in the industry appeared up.\n\nIn a chat with Larry King in July of the same year he confirmed he had no other projects lined up and didn't plan on changing that fact.\n\nHis retirement was confirmed four years later during the promotion of his third novel titled Escape From Andersonville.\n\nIt brought an end to his career which spanned over six decades, beginning in 1956 when he joined the Pasadena Playhouse and befriended Dustin Hoffman.\n\nIt wasn't until 1963 that he started landing small roles on TV and almost ten years later when he made a name for himself after his Oscar-nominated performance in I Never Sang For My Father.\n\nHe went on to win a number of accolades throughout his impressive career, including an Academy Award win for Best Actor for his role in The French Connection in 1971.\n\nOther hits he was known for include his role as super villain Lex Luthor in the 1978 version of Superman: The Movie.\n\nIn 2001 he also picked up a Golden Globe for the comedy The Royal Tenenbaums."
