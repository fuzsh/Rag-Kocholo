I just want to start at the beginning just for a second and say, sitting out there next to Barbara Harris reminds me of my first acting scene ever. It was in New York, and the gentlemen sitting in front of us when we were doing that scene was my acting teacher, and I just have to mention his name: George Morrison. I want to thank him. Also, Mr. Billy Friedkin, who has already received his prize tonight, but I have to thank him because he really brought me through this when I wanted to quit. And Eddie Egan, who you all know. Mr. Phil D'Antoni. Roy Scheider, Roy. And last, a young lady who I met in New York many years ago, Miss Felippa* Maltese, and she brought me uptown. Thank you.\n\n[Ed. note: Mr. Friedkin won the Oscar for directing \"The French Connection\" earlier in the evening.] [*Spelling not confirmed.]"
