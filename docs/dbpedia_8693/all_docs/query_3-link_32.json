The Red Cross shelters, feeds and provides comfort to people affected by disasters; supplies about 40% of the nation’s blood; teaches skills that save lives; distributes international humanitarian aid; and supports veterans, military members and their families.\n\nThe Red Cross is not a government agency. The Red Cross is a registered 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization that depends on volunteers and the generosity of the American public to deliver its mission.\n\nThe American Red Cross, through its strong network of volunteers, donors and partners, is always there in times of need.\n\nRed Cross supporters provide a beacon of hope. From helping during disasters and ensuring access to lifesaving blood, to providing training to save lives and supporting military communities, the Red Cross is there when help can’t wait.\n\nWe aspire to turn compassion into action so that...\n\nHumanity\n\nThe Red Cross, born of a desire to bring assistance without discrimination to the wounded on the battlefield, endeavors—in its international and national capacity—to prevent and alleviate human suffering wherever it may be found. Its purpose is to protect life and health and to ensure respect for the human being. It promotes mutual understanding, friendship, cooperation and lasting peace amongst all peoples.\n\nUnity\n\nThere can be only one Red Cross society in any one country. It must be open to all. It must carry on its humanitarian work throughout its territory."
