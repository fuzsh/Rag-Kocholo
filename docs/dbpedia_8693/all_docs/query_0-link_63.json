        "text": "After a legendary career spanning more than 50 years, Gene Hackman surprised everyone in the industry by effectively announcing his retirement in July 2004.\n\nThe actor had always maintained his privacy and rarely gave interviews outside of promotional duties, but after confirming to Larry King that he had no future projects on the horizon, the two-time Academy Award winner proved himself a man of his word and never again returned to the silver screen.\n\nHackman is far from retired, though, having pursued his literary interests and published four books since his final cinematic stand was released. In a rare moment of retrospection with Empire, the iconic star explained why he decided to call it quits.\n\n“The straw that broke the camel’s back was actually a stress test that I took in New York”, he said. “The doctor advised me that my heart wasn’t in the kind of shape that I should be putting it under any stress”.\n\nAfter discovering that the strenuous nature of being on set could have seriously adverse effects on his health, Hackman walked away from the world of cinema with his head held high.\n\nHow many movies has Gene Hackman been in?\n\nBetween 1961 and 2004, Hackman appeared in 79 feature films covering virtually everything cinema had to offer, winning an Oscar for ‘Best Actor’ in The French Connection and a ‘Best Supporting Actor’ trophy for Clint Eastwood’s Unforgiven, as well as three further nominations for Bonnie and Clyde, I Never Sang for My Father and Mississippi Burning.\n\nAs well as a myriad of memorable turns in the likes of The Poseidon Adventure, The Conversation, and Young Frankenstein, Hackman recurred as Lex Luthor in the original Superman series of films, before parlaying his veteran gravitas into supporting parts in The Firm, Crimson Tide, and Enemy of the State.\n\nA dab hand at comedy as proven in The Birdcage, Get Shorty, and The Royal Tenenbaums, to name but three, Hackman even dabbled in voiceover work by lending his talents to the uncredited role of God in 1983’s Two of a Kind and giving his grizzled best to General Mandible in 1998’s Antz.\n\nWhat was Gene Hackman’s first movie?\n\nHackman made his screen debut in Burt Balaban’s 1961 biographical drama Mad Dog Coll, starring John Davis Chandler as notorious mob hitman Vincent Coll, in what also marked the first screen credit for Telly Savalas. However, the actor wasn’t credited for his bit-part as a policeman.\n\nThe first time his name was listed in the credits didn’t come for another three years when he played Norman in Lilith, an adaptation of J.R. Salamanca’s novel of the same that served as the final feature from five-time Oscar-nominated All the King’s Men and The Hustler director Robert Rossen.\n\nWhat was Gene Hackman’s last movie?\n\nThe year after sparring opposite Dustin Hoffman in John Grisham-derived legal thriller Runaway Jury, the final movie of Hackman’s career came under less auspicious circumstances when he took second billing behind Ray Romano in 2004’s satirical political comedy Welcome to Mooseport.\n\nHackman stars as former president Monroe Cole, who retires to the titular town and agrees to run for mayor in what’s expected to be a landslide. Romano’s hardware store owner has different ideas, pitting them against each other in a race that sees both utilise underhanded tactics to gain an advantage.\n\nA box office disaster that failed to even recoup even half of its $30 million budget from cinemas, Welcome to Mooseport was also panned by critics and audiences alike, which unfortunately enshrined Hackman’s final film as one of the worst of his career."
