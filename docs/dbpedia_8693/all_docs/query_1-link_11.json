Recently, names have popped up for other reasons such as landmark moments or for no reason at all other than someone put up an “appreciation post” and it took off from there. So, this morning my heart sank a little when I saw the iconic Gene Hackman was trending on X (Twitter). He has played so many memorable roles as “Superman”, “The French Connection”, “Hoosiers”, “Mississippi Burning”, “The Bird Cage”, and “Unforgiven” just to name a few. He retired from acting in 2004. While I was relieved to see he was alive the reason he was trending was a little disappointing. Gene, now 94 years old and still getting around was spotted out getting gas by The New York Post. He has been basically unseen for several years so spotting him is kind of surprising. At first that was all it seemed like was a happy post about seeing him alive and well. Until they commented on his attire. It just happened to be the same outfit he was spotted in a few weeks ago and they made a point to type that. Fans and just EVERYONE went at them for pointing out the fact that people wear the same clothes from time to time. I’m just happy he’s alive still! Wear whatever you want Gene!"
