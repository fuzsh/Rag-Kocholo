        "text": "Mission statements vs. vision statements\n\nSometimes the terms “mission statement” and “vision statement” are used interchangeably or even combined into a single statement.\n\nBut they mean two very different things. Your mission statement is what your company is doing right now, while your vision statement is what you hope to achieve in the future – where you are in this moment versus where you’re going.\n\nLet’s bring this home: if someone asks you, “So, what do you do?” you might say, “I’m a software developer at a mid-size software company” or “I’m a circus clown.”\n\nBut, what if they asked you, “What do you want to be doing five or 10 years from now?” Your answer might be a bit different, right?\n\nMaybe you’d say, “My goal is to move into a management position where I oversee all of the company’s developers” or “Ultimately, I’d like to be a world-famous clown and the choice entertainer at birthday parties for celebrities’ kids.”\n\nWe’ve put together a mini list of inspiration to help you get started. Below are some winning mission statements from a few well-known companies. We know it’s tempting, but no, you cannot copy them.\n\nsweetgreen: “Our mission is to inspire healthier communities by connecting people to real food.”\n\nNike: “Bring inspiration and innovation to every athlete* in the world. *If you have a body, you are an athlete.”\n\nEtsy: “Our mission is to Keep Commerce Human.”\n\nLinkedIn: “Connect the world’s professionals to make them more productive and successful.”\n\nAlright, now the real work begins: rolling up your sleeves and pulling together your own mission statement.\n\nLet’s mention one more thing about what a mission is not – a slogan. A slogan (think “Just do it” or “Like a good neighbor, State Farm is there”) is a catchy marketing line that customers can immediately associate with a brand. Your mission statement is more than that. It captures the heart of your organization and explains why you do what you do and why you exist in the first place.\n\nA solid mission statement calls for you to dig deep, beyond just “Do a good job” or “Delight our customers”, which can make writing your mission statement tough. Fortunately, we’ve broken it down into three (kind of) easy steps.\n\nMission statements run the gamut from one sentence to several paragraphs, and there’s a lot that they can include. Some mission statements even go into detail about how a company not only serves their customers, but also their employees and communities.\n\nBut, let’s just keep this simple for now. In its most basic form, your mission statement should capture:\n\nWhat your company offers your customers (why do you exist?)\n\nWho your company serves (who are your target customers?)\n\nWhy your company stands out (what makes you different from your competitors?)\n\nGrab your favorite pen (we know you have one!) and a notepad and write a short (just a single sentence fragment will work) response to each of those prompts.\n\nFor example, imagine that you work for a software company that developed an app that uses highly tailored personality tests to match candidates with dream jobs. You might come up with something like this:\n\nWhat your company offers your customers\n\nAn easy solution to finding a dream job\n\nWho your company serves\n\nYoung professionals who feel lost about their next career steps\n\nWhy your company stands out\n\nYour personality assessments are patented and highly rated\n\nGot your own answers scribbled down? Great! Let’s move to the next step.\n\nYou have the nuts and bolts of your mission statement figured out, but, let’s be honest, it’s still a hot mess. It’s time to tape them together into a more readable statement.\n\nBegin rearranging the pieces, swapping in different words, and making other changes to come up with a few potential statements.\n\nDon’t feel like you’re married to the very first version you come up with. It’s all about trial and error here. Plus, the more options you come up with, the more flexibility you have to land on something that sings.\n\nSticking with our personality test company example, you might develop these potential mission statements:\n\nHelping young professionals find careers where they can thrive with patented and effective personality assessments.\n\nGrowing tomorrow’s leaders through targeted personality assessments that match young professionals with careers.\n\nForging career pathways for today’s professionals through effective personality assessments.\n\nUsing patented and customized personality assessments to help young professionals find their perfect careers.\n\nThey’re all pretty solid choices, right? Don’t worry. The next step will help us narrow these down.\n\n3. Collect feedback and refine\n\nYour mission statement captures your company as a whole, which means you can’t write it in a vacuum. Make sure it really does your organization justice by welcoming other viewpoints in the process.\n\nCollect feedback from your teammates, leaders, board of directors, and loyal customers. You can gather their thoughts through a formal survey, focus groups, or just casual one-on-one chats.\n\nPull together all of the mission statements that you came up with (that you think are good options, of course), and ask questions like:\n\nWhich of these statements do you like the most? Why?\n\nWhich of these statements do you like the least? Why?\n\nIs there anything that you think these statements are missing?\n\nDo you have any other ideas for mission statements?\n\nThe trick here is that you can’t just collect that feedback – you should actually think about and work with it.\n\nImagine that in response to the personality test mission statement options, most people agreed that they wanted to see something shorter and snappier. You take that in and end up with a final mission statement like this:\n\nBuilding better careers through customized personality assessments.\n\nBam! You have your mission statement. It seems easy peasy laid out like this, right? But don’t fret if it’s not done in a snap for you.\n\nIt might take some time and many rounds of revisions to nail it. That’s totally normal. Take it as a sign that you’re giving your mission statement the effort and consideration it deserves.\n\nForecasting the future of your company – and with such bravado – makes creating a vision statement a strange (and somewhat braggy and therefore slightly uncomfortable) task. But, seriously, that’s what a vision is all about. See below for examples of companies who have taken this task and owned it.\n\nHabitat for Humanity: “A world where everyone has a decent place to live.”\n\nFord: “To become the world’s most trusted company.”\n\nBen & Jerry’s: “We make the best possible ice cream in the best possible way.”\n\nDow: “We want to become the most innovative, customer-centric, inclusive, and sustainable materials science company in the world. Our goal is to deliver value growth and best-in-class performance.”\n\nYou’ll notice that nonprofits tend to describe an ideal world while for-profit companies describe their place in an ideal world.\n\nStart by understanding why your product or service matters. What does it help people do? How does it better their lives?\n\nThink about our career personality test example for a moment. What’s the end result there? Nope, it’s not the app itself. The ultimate result (and value!) is a match with a career that seems like a perfect fit.\n\nThink of it this way: Your company is the road on which your customers are running a race. Once they cross the finish line, what do they get? This can help you see how what you’re doing makes a difference for your customers, your community, or even the world.\n\nWhen you look five or 10 years down the road (let’s stop there for now), what fills out your win column? Jot down everything that comes to mind.\n\nTurning back to our personality test scenario, do you want to become the world’s most trusted resource for career exploration? Do you want to create a world where nobody hates their jobs? Do you want every person to have confidence in their next career step?\n\nRemember, this is your chance to be ambitious and be bold, so don’t be timid. Find your swagger and go big!\n\nOk, you’re almost there. You have two elements locked down:\n\nWhat you ultimately produce and why it matters\n\nHow you’ll know when you’re successful\n\nNow, similarly to what you did with your mission statement, it’s time to start piecing them together using different combinations and wording to see what you come up with.\n\nSticking with our running career test example, your vision statement could be any one of the following (among many other gazillion options you come up with, of course).\n\nPosition ourselves as the most trusted partner in career exploration.\n\nBuild a world where absolutely nobody dreads heading to work.\n\nCreate a career landscape where Monday is just as great as Friday.\n\nAgain, this is a game of trial and error until you’re happy with a near-final product that you can run by other people for feedback.\n\nAt the end of that, you’ll have a vision statement that sums up your goals for the future of your organization.\n\nWe won’t be offended if you’re wondering, “What’s the point of all this?”\n\nTrust us: creating these statements is worth the sweat. They’re far more than formalities and really can be useful for your organization.\n\nYour mission statement highlights your company’s core values and helps everybody – from your customers to your employees – immediately understand what your business is about and how you’re different from your competitors.\n\nYour vision statement serves as a roadmap of sorts. It’s an inspiring reminder of what you’re working toward, which is easy to lose sight of when you’re bombarded with the day to day.\n\nBut here’s the thing: you can’t stop at just creating them. In order for them to do their job, you need to actively promote and live them.\n\nThat doesn’t just mean slapping them up on your website or printing them on a poster that hangs in your break room. You need to integrate them as core parts of your culture by always acting and making decisions with those statements in mind.\n\nPlus, you need to educate your employees about what your mission and vision are, and what they really mean. One survey found that a whopping 61% of employees didn’t know their company’s mission statement. You can’t really expect your team to help you achieve your mission and vision if they don’t know what they are.\n\nSo, give new employees the message on day one. Make your company mission and vision part of the onboarding process for new hires, and return to these statements whenever you’re launching new projects, problem-solving, brainstorming, or making big decisions.\n\nDo that, and your mission and vision statements won’t be a formality. They’ll be fundamental to the way you do business."
