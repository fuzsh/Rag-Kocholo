        "text": "1: “Analysis of death is not for the sake of becoming fearful but to appreciate this precious lifetime.” - Dalai Lama\n\nAs a Buddhist (the most senior Buddhist on earth, no less), the Dalai Lama believes in reincarnation. He believes that his deeds in this life will directly affect what form he takes in the next. In this quote, he encourages us to talk about death and dying in order to give ourselves the perspective of seeing how fortunate we are to have lived.\n\nFor the Dalai Lama, it’s not just about appreciating life though; he’s quoted elsewhere as highlighting the practical benefit to a Buddhist of analysing and accepting death peacefully:\n\n“From a Buddhist point of view… our state of mind at the time of death can influence the quality of our next rebirth. So if we make a special effort to generate a virtuous state of mind, we may strengthen and activate a virtuous karma, and so bring about a happy rebirth.”\n\n2: “I have now decided that my death should be very precious. I really want to use it. I’d like my death to be as interesting as my life has been, and will be.” - David Bowie, Playboy Magazine interview, 1976\n\nIn this quote, David Bowie was setting a high bar indeed for his death, because his life was never less than eventful. Nonetheless, he succeeded. His death, in January 2016, was a surprise to the outside world because he’d carefully hidden the extent of his terminal cancer from all except his inner circle. He purposely released his final album, Blackstar, in his last week on earth. It became an instant classic, not to mention an astonishing, unique swansong. Full of dark brooding meditations, the album is as rich and artistically adventurous as anything else he created. Yet it’s not as depressing as you might think.\n\nOnce asked by an interviewer whether he practised a form of worship, Bowie responded: “Life. I love life very much indeed.” Even as he faced death, you can hear that love loud and clear throughout Blackstar.\n\n3: “It’s part of the privilege of being human that we have our moment when we have to say goodbye.” - Patti Smith\n\nPatti Smith said various eloquent things about death in this 2017 interview with Australian television . She’s had much to reflect on, having endured the deaths of both parents, her brother, her husband and her long-time collaborator and friend Robert Mapplethorpe (a legendary photographer in his own right).\n\nSmith is regarded as the “poet laureate of punk”, and it shows in how she speaks about death throughout the interview. When her husband Fred died, Patti’s father advised her that “time does not heal all wounds but it gives us the tools to endure them.” She explains that these “tools” are our experiences of bereavement, so each time we experience it afresh, it could help us in managing the next time. She also adds a note of optimism that every time someone close to us dies, they live on within us, becoming “part of our DNA”. She adds with a smile that “my mother’s been gone since 2001 and she’s still scolding me. Or she’s still helping me. She’s still counselling me.\"\n\n4: “The bitterest tears shed over graves are for words left unsaid and deeds left undone.” - Harriet Beecher Stowe\n\nThe celebrated nineteenth century American abolitionist and author Harriet Beecher Stowe is best remembered for her book Uncle Tom’s Cabin, which highlighted the plight of enslaved African Americans, and was a very influential novel of its time.\n\nAlthough this quote is sad, it’s also positive. It encourages us to make the most of our time with the people we love, and not hold back on saying the things we’d like to express , even if that’s just a simple “I love you”. The “deeds left undone” that Beecher Stowe warns against could be anything from a simple gift to show someone you appreciate them, to spending more quality time together.\n\n5: “In the midst of death, life persists. In the midst of untruth, truth persists. In the midst of darkness, light persists.” - Mahatma Gandhi\n\nAs a pacifist who walked a long, difficult road to help bring about an independent India, Mahatma Gandhi knew a lot about death, untruth and darkness. He faced down a torrent of violence, intimidation and propaganda, armed with little beyond his wits, his words and his legions of loyal followers.\n\nIn this quote, he acknowledges that we’ll all face difficult times, but encourages us to try and look for positive things to focus on, however hard it may seem.\n\n6: “Though lovers be lost, love shall not.” - Dylan Thomas\n\nThe Welsh writer Dylan Thomas was one of the finest of his, or any, generation, whose famous radio play Under Milk Wood remains one of the most inventive, playful explosions of writing in the English language. In a celebrated early poem, And Death Shall Have No Dominion , Thomas laments the fact that death is an inevitability, but reminds us defiantly that life goes on – thus death doesn’t have total dominion over us.\n\nIn the above passage, he writes that love is eternal, so even after lovers die, their love for each other will live on in some form. Dylan Thomas also wrote Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night, a poem pleading with his dying father to keep struggling against the inevitability of his death. To this day, both poems are often chosen for readings at funerals because although they’re sad, they’re also uplifting and defiant.\n\n7: “In life, we weep at the thought of death. In death, perhaps we weep at the thought of life.” - Marilyn Monroe\n\nMarilyn Monroe’s short, tragic life was nonetheless full of light and wonder. She didn’t just grace the screen, she owned it, and although often stereotyped as lacking intelligence, this was far from the truth. Monroe’s global success and stature was a beacon to women everywhere, and her wise, frequently very witty, quotes have been part of a wider re-evaluation of her as a lot more than “just a pretty face”. To many, she is now a feminist icon.\n\nThat said, her quotes are often tinged with sadness. In this quote, she is on the one hand optimistic about there being some sort of afterlife. But at the same time, the very notion of weeping at the thought of life illustrates how troubled she felt.\n\n8: “When you wake up from death, you will find yourself in my arms...” - Richard Brautigan\n\nThe cult writer Richard Brautigan produced a variety of books and poems from the 1960s to the 1980s, including the famous Trout Fishing in America.\n\nBrautigan’s writing is often very simple in its style, but he still covers very dark subject matter in this way.\n\nThe above quote is part of a short beautiful poem, presumably written for a loved one, consoling them that if he dies before they do, he will be waiting for them in the afterlife…\n\nIf I should die before you do\n\nWhen\n\nyou wake up\n\nfrom death,\n\nyou will find yourself\n\nin my arms,\n\nand\n\nI will be\n\nkissing you,\n\nand\n\nI\n\nwill be crying\n\n9: “I joyfully await the exit – and I hope never to return” - Frida Kahlo\n\nThe Mexican artist Frida Kahlo is one of the most influential painters of the twentieth century. Her works are reproduced today in great number, and are characterised by a bold, naïve style that celebrates the traditional arts of native Americans but also stands up as strikingly modern.\n\nSadly, Kahlo suffered ill health for much of her life and died aged 47. The above quote accompanied her final drawing, of a black angel, possibly death. Although in that context it’s easy to imagine it was meant as a morbid wish to die, it can also be interpreted more optimistically. Having lived a rich and colourful life, perhaps the artist was expressing the philosophy of “you only live once” to the full."
