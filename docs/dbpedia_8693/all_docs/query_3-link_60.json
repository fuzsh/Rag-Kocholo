        "text": "The first time I heard it I was jet-lagged. I’d flown 20 hours to Byron Bay in Australia from New York, and was sitting on a stage with other American authors under a tent in the rain. We were in that pocket of the world for a writers’ festival, and before our panel discussion began, a volunteer welcomed the soggy audience of more than 200 people and mentioned that the land was originally part of an indigenous nation. This, an outright mention of a displaced population, connecting the space to a time before colonialism, was something I’d never experienced before. In Australia, it’s called an “acknowledgment of country.”\n\nBy the time I flew home, after a month there, I’d witnessed at least a dozen of these acknowledgments, and one called a “welcome to country,” in which a member of the local indigenous community provided remarks. I learned that although the practice was relatively new in mainstream settings, the tradition itself had been an indigenous custom for centuries. In just a few weeks, I heard these remarks in places as modest as a classroom and as grand as the Sydney Opera House.\n\nMy mother accompanied me for this month Down Under and we got into the habit of doing real-time evaluations, all nonverbal, of these opening remarks. Were they heartfelt, or perfunctory? A smile, head shake or eyebrow raise might pass between us. Did we detect an extra layer of euphemism, or was our own American cynicism to blame? Some speakers used the phrase “traditional custodians of the land,” which was admirable for eschewing the concept of ownership, but also had a janitorial ring to it.\n\nOne statement, before an event at the end of a long day, was given in the same tone a flight attendant might employ when pointing out emergency exits. Another, at a community arts center in a working-class suburb of Melbourne, came closest to frank historical accuracy: The speaker described the land as stolen, and mentioned a continuing fight for restitution. This audience of about 60 people included the highest concentration of nonwhites I saw during my travels — indigenous, South and East Asian, African and Arab. Perhaps the speaker, who was white, spoke so plainly because she thought this audience could handle something closer to the truth."
