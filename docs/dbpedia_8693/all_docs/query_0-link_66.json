It was not until he was in his thirties that Gene Hackman decided to become an actor. He joined the Pasadena Playhouse, a prestigious Californian school which trained many great Hollywood actors but which, according to legend, defined him as “not inclined to success” . The sequel will largely prove the opposite…\n\nBack in New York in 1964, Gene Hackman played on Broadway in the play Any Wednesday . A performance that opened doors for him since the same year, he appeared at the cinema in Lilith , alongside Warren Beatty . Three years later, he obtained his first major role in Arthur Penn ‘s Bonnie and Clyde , on the advice of Warren Beatty, producer of the film. In 1971, a new turning point in Gene Hackman’s career with his role as Detective Doyle in William Friedkin ‘s French Connection . A performance which earned him the Oscar for Best Actor a year later. From then on, his career was marked by numerous strong works… In 1972, he starred in The Poseidon Adventure by Ronald Neame then starred in The Scarecrow by Jerry Schatzberg , and Secret Conversation by Francis Ford Coppola . In 1975, Gene Hackman reprized his role as Detective Doyle in French Connection 2 , this time directed by John Frankenheimer . The same year, he played under the direction of his accomplice Arthur Penn in The Fugue before distinguishing himself in The Domino Theory by Stanley Kramer (1978). Gene Hackman is still as active as ever and can be found in the credits of Superman I , directed by Richard Donner . After reprising his role two years later in Superman II and having played in Under Fire , he once again reunited with Arthur Penn in 1985 for the film Target then inherited an impressive role in Alan Parker ‘s Mississippi Burning , where he is nominated for an Oscar for Best Actor.\n\nAt the dawn of the 90s, Gene Hackman’s career has not aged a day and the actor tirelessly continues to shine in quality productions. He stars in two films directed by Clint Eastwood : Impitoyable and Les Pleins Pouvoirs . It is also seen at the top of the credits for The Firm , USS Alabama and Get Shorty .\n\nIn 1998, he returned to Enemy of the State in a role almost similar to the one he played in Secret Conversation.
