        "text": "GENE Hackman's filmography spans decades of movie and TV appearances.\n\nThe Oscar winner is known for Mississippi Burning, Superman, and The French Connection.\n\nWhat is Gene Hackman's net worth?\n\nAccording to Celebrity Net Worth, Gene Hackman has an estimated fortune of $80million.\n\nGene's net worth is attributed to his several years as a successful Hollywood actor and novelist.\n\nAfter years of landing bit parts in the late 1950s into the 1960s, he went on to achieve his career breakthrough in the latter part of the decade.\n\nDuring the late 1960s, Gene earned recognition for his roles in Lilith, Bonnie and Clyde, Hawaii, and Downhill Racer.\n\nThe Golden Globe winner's list of movie appearances also includes:\n\nI Never Sang for My Father\n\nThe French Connection\n\nPrime Cut\n\nThe Poseidon Adventure\n\nThe Conversation\n\nYoung Frankenstein\n\nFrench Connection II\n\nA Bridge Too Far\n\nSuperman\n\nSuperman II\n\nReds\n\nSuperman IV: The Quest for Peace\n\nMississippi Burning\n\nPostcards From the Edge\n\nUnforgiven\n\nGet Shorty\n\nThe Birdcage\n\nEnemy of the State\n\nThe Replacements\n\nHeartbreakers\n\nThe Royal Tenanbaums\n\nRunaway Jury\n\nAside from acting on screen, Hackman is an accomplished novelist.\n\nIn 1999, he and his writing partner Daniel Lenihan published their first novel Wake of the Perdido Star.\n\nWhat movie did Hackman win the Oscar for?\n\nAt the 1972 Academy Awards, Hackman won his first Oscar for The French Connection.\n\nAt the 1993 telecast, he took home the gold for his performance in the Clint Eastwood western Unforgiven.\n\nOver the course of his career, the Academy has nominated him a total of five times.\n\nHackman was recognized by the organization for his performances in Bonnie and Clyde, I Never Sang For My Father, and Mississippi Burning.\n\nWhen did Hackman retire?\n\nOn July 7, 2004, Hackman announced his plans to retire during an interview with Larry King.\n\nOn June 5, 2008, he officially revealed he was retiring from acting.\n\nThe award-winning star attributed his retirement to his doctor's advice regarding his heart's condition.\n\nHackman told EMPIRE: \"The straw that broke the camel’s back was actually a stress test that I took in New York.\n\n\"The doctor advised me that my heart wasn’t in the kind of shape that I should be putting it under any stress.\n\n\"When I’m actually on the set or on a stage, actually doing the work, I loved that process and I loved the creative process of trying to bring a character to life.\"\n\nHe further explained: \"Whereas the business part of show business is kinda wicked, it’s kind of a frying pan.\n\n\"It was jarring and at my age and with my health, I decided I didn’t want to do that any longer.\n\n\"The agents don’t want me to say it, in case something good comes along but I’m officially retired. No doubt about it.\"\n\nWhere does Hackman live?\n\nHackman resides on a large 12-acre property he and his wife Betsy remodeled and designed in Santa Fe, New Mexico.\n\nHe previously owned a 25-acre property in Montecito, California in the 1980s, which he sold for a cool $5.5 million in 1985.\n\nHe also had a home in Pebble Beach, California that he sold in 1993."
