        "text": "SEEN back to back to back, Gene Hackman's three leading roles in three current movies offer a clue to his nervy greatness: he seems energized by messing with his directors' expectations. In the comedy ''The Royal Tenenbaums,'' he plays the self-absorbed patriarch of a family of despondent geniuses, and his airy cunning is in dry counterpoint to Wes Anderson's arch, storybook compositions. In John Moore's ''Behind Enemy Lines,'' he's an admiral who mostly squints into monitors and assures a trapped young soldier that he won't be abandoned. But instead of John Wayne-like breast-beating, Mr. Hackman seems eaten up by the character's impotence, quietly riven by opposing inner forces of military discipline and rage. In ''Heist,'' he transcends the stifling universe of the writer and director David Mamet, in which spontaneous feeling tends to be trampled under a procession of double-, triple- and quadruple-crosses. Mr. Hackman supplies a strain of uncertainty: in a sea of duplicitous masks, his is the only human face.\n\nCalled ''the hardest-working thesp in showbiz'' in a recent issue of Variety, Mr. Hackman doesn't disappear into these hugely dissimilar roles, effecting dazzling transformations in the manner of Gary Oldman or Meryl Streep. He doesn't make his roles disappear into him, like those capacious eccentrics Marlon Brando and Jack Nicholson. He doesn't project any charismatic ease with himself, like Paul Newman. And he doesn't give off live-wire Method sparks like Al Pacino or Robert Duvall. At 71, Mr. Hackman continues to occupy a middle ground between character acting and movie stardom that has earned him, over the years, the bland appellation ''Everyman'' -- a strangely inapt description for an actor who claims to be comfortable only when he finds the edge. Even at their jauntiest, Mr. Hackman's performances have volcanic undercurrents. It might be that the secret of his uniqueness is that his comfort zone is such a scary and volatile place.\n\nConsider his most vivid scene in ''Unforgiven'' (1992), in which his character, a sheriff known as Little Bill, welcomes a hired gun played by Richard Harris to the town of Big Whiskey by kicking him to a bloody pulp up and down Main Street. Often Mr. Hackman prepares for a scene by doing an ''affective memory'' exercise, a Stanislavsky-derived technique that involves reliving a past experience, usually traumatic, to infuse a moment with emotional truth. But he prefers, in action scenes, to use whatever's in the air; and, in this case, Mr. Harris -- who had appeared with Mr. Hackman 26 years earlier, in ''Hawaii'' -- unwittingly provided a key.\n\n''We had a long conversation,'' Mr. Hackman recalls, ''and there was a moment where I could tell he didn't remember having worked with me -- but he said he did, he tried to fake his way through it, which all of us do at one time or another. Of course, I wasn't really angry with him; I love him, I think he's terrific. But I remember thinking, 'Oh, I can use this.' I just took that disappointment and did this kind of transference.''"
