        "text": "To promote Yeezus, West granted a Q&A to The New York Times. In the wide-ranging chat, West briefly discussed Taylor Swift, noting, in part, that he doesn’t regret the stage-crash and highlighting his complicated feelings about awards shows, race and fame. “[The Taylor VMA incident] only led me to complete awesomeness at all times. It’s only led me to awesome truth and awesomeness. Beauty, truth, awesomeness. That’s all it is,” he said, noting that it was a situation where he gave into peer pressure to apologize.\n\nWhen asked if he’d take back the original action or the apology, if given the choice, he replied, “You know what? I can answer that, but I’m — I’m just — not afraid, but I know that would be such a distraction. It’s such a strong thing, and people have such a strong feeling about it. My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy was my long, backhanded apology. You know how people give a backhanded compliment? It was a backhanded apology. It was like, all these raps, all these sonic acrobatics. I was like: ‘Let me show you guys what I can do, and please accept me back. You want to have me on your shelves.’”\n\nSwift graced the cover of Vanity Fair‘s September issue and gave her version of her slow march toward friendship with West. “I feel like I wasn’t ready to be friends with him until I felt like he had some sort of respect for me, and he wasn’t ready to be friends with me until he had some sort of respect for me — so it was the same issue, and we both reached the same place at the same time,” she explained. “I became friends with Jay-Z, and I think it was important, for Jay-Z, for Kanye and I to get along. … And then Kanye and I both reached a place where he would say really nice things about my music and what I’ve accomplished, and I could ask him how his kid’s doing.”\n\nAs for the rumored collaboration: “We haven’t planned [any collaboration] … But hey, I like him as a person. And that’s a really good, nice first step, a nice place for us to be.”\n\nIt became a full-circle moment at the 2015 VMAs when Swift presented West the prestigious Video Vanguard Award. While it would be the rapper’s remarks that ultimately generated the most chatter afterward, it was a big moment when a grinning Swift took the stage to give an award to her onetime foe.\n\n“I first met Kanye West six years ago — at this show, actually!” she joked at the beginning of her remarks. “It seemed like everyone in the world knew about our infamous encounter at the VMAs. But something that you may not know is that Kanye West’s album College Dropout was the very first album my brother and I bought on iTunes when I was 12 years old. … I have been a fan of his for as long as I can remember because Kanye defines what it means to be a creative force in music, fashion and, well, life. So I guess I have to say to all the other winners tonight: I’m really happy for you, and I’mma let you finish, but Kanye West has had one of the greatest careers of all time!”\n\nWest’s wife Kim Kardashian graced the cover of GQ and paired it with an in-depth interview where she discussed how Swift had “approved” the lyric, per a recorded phone conversation between the pop singer and ‘Ye. The excerpt read:\n\n“She totally approved that,” Kim says, shaking her head in annoyance. “She totally knew that that was coming out. She wanted to all of a sudden act like she didn’t. I swear, my husband gets so much shit for things [when] he really was doing proper protocol and even called to get it approved.” Kim is on a roll now, speaking faster and more animatedly than at any other point during our time together. “What rapper would call a girl that he was rapping a line about to get approval?”\n\nSwift, Kim insists, “totally gave the OK. Rick Rubin was there. So many respected people in the music business heard that [conversation] and knew. I mean, he’s called me a b—h in his songs. That’s just, like, what they say. I never once think, [gasping] ‘What a derogatory word! How dare he?’ Not in a million years. I don’t know why she just, you know, flipped all of a sudden. … It was funny because [on the call with Kanye, Taylor] said, ‘When I get on the Grammy red carpet, all the media is going to think that I’m so against this, and I’ll just laugh and say, ‘The joke’s on you, guys. I was in on it the whole time.’ And I’m like, wait, but [in] your Grammy speech, you completely dissed my husband just to play the victim again.”\n\nSwift’s rep then countered with another statement sent to Billboard. “Taylor does not hold anything against Kim Kardashian as she recognizes the pressure Kim must be under and that she is only repeating what she has been told by Kanye West,” the statement reads. “However, that does not change the fact that much of what Kim is saying is incorrect. Kanye West and Taylor only spoke once on the phone while she was on vacation with her family in January of 2016 and they have never spoken since. Taylor has never denied that conversation took place. It was on that phone call that Kanye West also asked her to release the song on her Twitter account, which she declined to do. Kanye West never told Taylor he was going to use the term ‘that b—h’ in referencing her. A song cannot be approved if it was never heard. Kanye West never played the song for Taylor Swift. Taylor heard it for the first time when everyone else did and was humiliated. Kim Kardashian’s claim that Taylor and her team were aware of being recorded is not true, and Taylor cannot understand why Kanye West, and now Kim Kardashian, will not just leave her alone.”\n\nKim Kardashian Snapchats footage of the recorded video where Kanye and Taylor appear to be on the phone, discussing the “Famous” lyric. While the two speak about the “I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex” line, there was no footage of the “I made that b—h famous” bit. Swift appears to perceive the former as a “compliment” in the tape but took to Twitter to explain her piece after the video leak.\n\n“Where is the video of Kanye telling me he was going to call me ‘that b—h’ in his song?” she wrote, per a screenshot of a note. “It doesn’t exist because it never happened.” She added, “While I wanted to be supportive of Kanye on the phone call, you cannot ‘approve’ a song you haven’t heard. Being falsely painted as a liar when I was never given the full story or played any part of the song is character assassination.”\n\nSwift was the subject of a wide-ranging profile in Rolling Stone, in which she discussed everything from her music to being a woman in the music industry and her well-known “girl group.” She also gave new details about “the events that led up” to the “Famous” phone call. “The world didn’t understand the context and the events that led up to it,” she explained. “Because nothing ever just happens like that without some lead-up. Some events took place to cause me to be pissed off when he called me a b—h. That was not just a singular event. Basically, I got really sick of the dynamic between he and I. And that wasn’t just based on what happened on that phone call and with that song — it was kind of a chain reaction of things.”\n\nShe also mentioned that she thought the two “reconnected” since the 2009 incident. “When someone doesn’t respect you so loudly and says you literally don’t deserve to be here — I just so badly wanted that respect from him, and I hate that about myself, that I was like, ‘This guy who’s antagonizing me, I just want his approval.’ But that’s where I was. And so we’d go to dinner and stuff.”\n\nSwift then said that ‘Ye called her up ahead of the 2015 VMAs to ask her to present his Video Vanguard Award. “He can be the sweetest. And I was so stoked that he asked me that. And so I wrote this speech up, and then we get to the VMAs and I make this speech and he screams, ‘MTV got Taylor Swift up here to present me this award for ratings!’ [His exact words: ‘You know how many times they announced Taylor was going to give me the award ’cause it got them more ratings?’] And I’m standing in the audience with my arm around his wife, and this chill ran through my body. I realized he is so two-faced. That he wants to be nice to me behind the scenes, but then he wants to look cool, get up in front of everyone and talk s–t. And I was so upset.”\n\nKanye then allegedly sent Swift a “big, big thing of flowers” as an apology, and the singer-songwriter decided to put their differences behind them. “So when he gets on the phone with me, and I was so touched that he would be respectful and, like, tell me about this one line in the song,” she continued. “And I was like, ‘OK, good. We’re back on good terms.’ And then when I heard the song, I was like, ‘I’m done with this. If you want to be on bad terms, let’s be on bad terms, but just be real about it.’”\n\nAfter the Swifties took over Twitter in a rage, the pop star finally tapped the mic to speak up. On her Instagram Story, Swift addressed the new videos but quickly turned the attention to the World Health Organization and Feeding America donation pages to aid coronavirus relief efforts.\n\n“Instead of answering those who are asking how I feel about the video footage that leaked, proving that I was telling the truth the whole time about that call (you know, the one that was illegally recorded, that somebody edited and manipulated in order to frame me and put me, my family, and fans through hell for 4 years)… SWIPE UP to see what really matters,” she posted, linking out to Feeding America and World Health Organization.\n\nLater that same night, Kim Kardashian West stepped in yet again, brewing the #KimKardashianIsOverParty storm. She crafted a long Twitter thread argument that tagged Swift’s account to directly call her out for choosing to “reignite an old exchange – that at this point in time feels very self-serving given the suffering millions of real victims are facing right now” regarding the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n“To be clear, the only issue I ever had around the situation was that Taylor lied through her publicist who stated that ‘Kanye never called to ask for permission…’ They clearly spoke so I let you all see that. Nobody ever denied the word ‘b—h’ was used without her permission,” Kardashian stated on social media before addressing what she considered to be the crux of the four-year-old controversy. “At the time when they spoke the song had not been fully written yet, but as everyone can see in the video, she manipulated the truth of their actual conversation in her statement when her team said she ‘declined and cautioned him about releasing a song with such a strong misogynistic message.’ The lie was never about the word b—h, It was always whether there was a call or not and the tone of the conversation.”\n\nThe reality TV star also denied claims that she edited her Snapchat footage from 2016 and defended her husband’s right to record his musical process as an artist.\n\nAfter Kardashian provoked Swift’s publicist Tree Paine by saying the “Reputation” artist used her to lie by saying West never called to ask for permission, Paine published an “unedited original statement” that read, “Kanye did not call for approval, but to ask Taylor to release his single ‘Famous’ on her Twitter account. She declined and cautioned him about releasing a song with such a strong misogynistic message. Taylor was never made aware of the actual lyric, ‘I made that b—h famous.’”\n\nAdditionally, Kardashian’s younger sister Khloé Kardashian weighed in on the matter, praising her sister’s lawyer-like instincts. “I was about to go take my a– to sleep but then I just saw my sister post a couple tweets. Kimberly you betta!!!!!!!!!!!” she tweeted. “Kim is my f—ing lawyer for life!!!!!! My sister AND my lawyer.”"
