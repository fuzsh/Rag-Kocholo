        "text": "He was initially reluctant to take the role of Lex Luthor in ''Superman: The Movie (1978)'' as he didn't want to shave off a mustache he had recently grown. Richard Donner made a deal with him that if he shaved it off, Donner would shave off his as well. After Hackman did so, Donner revealed that the mustache he was wearing was a fake. This made Hackman instantly respect and like Donner immensely.\n\nOne of the most sustaining actors of all time, he still averaged two films a year in his 70s, having starred in six in 2001 alone. This all changed however in 2004, when he last acted in Willkommen in Mooseport (2004). He has not appeared in anything since.\n\nDustin Hoffman asked for the part of Rankin Fitch in Das Urteil - Jeder ist k채uflich (2003), which had gone to Hackman. Hoffman admits to asking, \"Can't you get rid of Gene and give me the part?\".\n\nAfter flunking out of the Pasadena Playhouse and moving to New York City with fellow drop-out Dustin Hoffman, Hackman worked at the Howard Johnson's restaurant in Times Square as a doorman. One day, a Pasadena Playhouse acting teacher whom Hackman hated walked by him, stopped, and told him that he had been right, that Hackman would never amount to anything.\n\nWas admitted into the famed Pasadena Playhouse on the G.I. Bill. He failed out of it after 3 months and moved to New York to continue being a stage actor. Received one of the lowest grades the school had ever given (1.3 out of 10). He headed to New York with the intention of proving them wrong.\n\nHackman has said that the failure of Asphalt-Bl체ten (1973) turned him off of art films due to the disappointment of working hard on a film that was critically acclaimed, but that tanked at the box office and failed to garner any awards. After this flop, Hackman mainly concentrated on acting for money, turning down such films as Einer flog 체ber das Kuckucksnest (1975) and Network (1976) for roles in films like Marschier oder stirb (1977) and Abenteurer auf der Lucky Lady (1975) that offered him fatter paychecks.\n\nIn the Superman movies, he didn't like the idea of going bald for his role as Lex Luthor. He was allowed to wear wigs instead, and was convinced to wear a bald cap in only a few scenes.\n\nDustin Hoffman came to New York after finishing his training at the Pasadena Playhouse. The two of them roomed together in New York at Hackman's one-bedroom apartment on 2nd Ave. & 26th St. Hoffman slept on the kitchen floor. Originally, Hackman had offered to let him stay a few nights, but Hoffman would not leave. Hackman had to take him out to look for his own apartment.\n\nAlong with Margot Kidder, Hackman was appalled at the way Alexander Salkind and Ilya Salkind, the producers of the first three Superman films and 1984's Supergirl (1984) film, had treated director Richard Donner, who had directed the first Superman - Der Film (1978) and most of the second Superman film back-to-back before he was fired by the Salkinds over creative differences. Hackman, who said he only did the first two movies because of Donner's persuasion, was so angry with the Salkinds that he vehemently refused to reprise the role of Lex Luthor in Superman III - Der st채hlerne Blitz (1983), while Margot Kidder, who played Lois Lane, only appeared in a cameo role. Hackman was later persuaded to reprise the Luthor role in Superman IV - Die Welt am Abgrund (1987).\n\nAs a young man, Hackman attended a showing of the movie Endstation Sehnsucht (1951) and was impressed by the performance of Marlon Brando due to his naturalism and the fact that he didn't look like what a movie star typically looked like in the 1950s. After exiting the theater, he told his father that he wanted to be an actor.\n\n7/7/04: Appeared on Larry King Live (1985). Larry King was surprised to find out that Hackman had no movies lined up, and Hackman replied by saying that he thinks it is the end of his career.\n\nIs one of only a few actors to win an Oscar for a supporting role after winning an Oscar for a leading role. (Others to do so are Jack Nicholson, Maggie Smith and Helen Hayes).\n\nAfter he played Little Bill in Erbarmungslos (1992), Hackman vowed not to appear in any more violent films. After he had been in violent films dating back to Bonnie und Clyde (1967) and French Connection - Brennpunkt Brooklyn (1971) (in a role refused by Peter Boyle for the same reasons), he said he was fed up with them.\n\nAppeared on Richard Nixon's infamous \"List of Enemies\" during the 1972 presidential election, the only time Hackman was publicly involved in politics. During an interview on Larry King Live (1985) in July 2004, Hackman stated that although he is a Democrat, he liked President Ronald Reagan, who had died the previous month.\n\nAs roommates, Dustin Hoffman and Hackman would often go to the apartment rooftop and play the drums. Hoffman played the bongo drums while Hackman played the conga drums. They did it out of their love for Marlon Brando, who they had heard played music in clubs. They wanted to be like Brando and were big fans of his.\n\nIn a 2004 Vanity Fair story on him, Dustin Hoffman, and Robert Duvall, Hackman said one of the worst memories of being a struggling actor, was working as a doorman in New York City. He recalled having seen former Marine officers pass him by when opening the door for them, of which one had said \"Hackman, you're a sorry son of a bitch.\"\n\nBased his role, in Der Dialog (1974), on one of his uncles and a fellow Marine he had known well. He characterized the Marine as someone \"who probably became a serial killer\"."
