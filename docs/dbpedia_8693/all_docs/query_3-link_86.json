        "text": "What does I said what I said mean?\n\nI said what I said is a phrase used to indicate that one is unapologetically sticking to an opinion or statement even though it has been or is likely to be met with strong disagreement or controversy. The phrase often implies that the person does not regret or feel ashamed about their stance and that they have no intention to change their mind.\n\nThe phrase can be used immediately after making a statement or later, after disagreement has been voiced by others (in which case it functions as a way of reasserting the opinion or statement without actually repeating it).\n\nThe phrase is often (though not always) used to be humorous, especially in the context of an opinion that may be controversial but is not about a serious topic, such as a statement about disliking a popular movie or type of food (or liking an unpopular one).\n\nExample: Everyone loves it, but Knives Out is overrated. I said what I said.\n\nIn more serious contexts, the phrase is sometimes used as a way of acknowledging a controversial statement without apologizing for it.\n\nExample: I said what I said. People can take issue with it, but I feel my statement has merit."
