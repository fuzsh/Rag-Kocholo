        "text": "Gene Hackman a jerk? I think so. Remember in hoosiers where he's walking by the barber shop, and the barber asks in good faith if Gene wants a haircut.\n\nGene says, \"Who cut your hair?\"\n\nthe barber says, \"Yours truly,\"\n\nGene hackman says, \"heh, no thanks\"\n\nI realize he's just an actor, but he's a jerk in all his movies. So why should he be type cast as a jerk if in life he is a saint?\n\nbut of course, Gene Hackman's attitude is meant as a...I guess a literary device?... cause it makes some kind of point... like the author's trying to say \"Yeah, he's a jerk, but he gets results\" cause Hackman's characters are all resourceful jerks. There are so many examples of resourceful jerk characters by other actors as well, like House, Hawkeye, Jack Bower, Texas Walker Ranger, Matlock, Harpo\n\nWhat an actor is famous of and what he is in real life don't necessearily go together.\n\nThis is especially evident in a few comedy actors for example:\n\nRowan Atkinson always plays the silly, naive type (Mr. Bean), but in real life he is intelligent and quite a serious man, some would say even quite dull. I've seen many interviews with him always thinking I'll be seing a lot of goofing around and such, but he's quite the opposite: a calm and collective English gentleman.\n\nAnother example is Wayne Knight - the evil neighbour of Seinfeld, also playing \"evil\" comedic roles in numerous movies (first comes to mind Rat Race). He is infact also very nice guy in real life, I hear.\n\nThe actors themselves say it's a way to leave ones self behind and become your total opposite for a short while.\n\nYeah, well you never know with these people.\n\nJust my two cents on the issue.\n\nMaybe Hackman likes to play jerk roles, because he can't do it in real life. He's such a big name in Hollywood, if he wanted to get out and play in other kinds of roles, I bet the big executives wouldn't stop him.\n\nHas no one here had second thoughts about a hair cut on seeing the hairdresser's hair? Ever heard of 'hairdresser's friend'? I've refused haircuts myself based on the state of the stylist.\n\nAnd if I met Superman I'd probably want him dead. He has no sense of fashion and someone that holier than thou has to be a total bore at dinner parties.\n\nAnd wouldn't you want him on your side if you were stuck in an upside down ship? You might prefer a jet pack and an oxyacetylene torch, but beggars can't be choosers.\n\nhave you heard there is a Kryptonite brand bike lock. Isn't superman the last person who would steal a bike, since he's good?\n\nI know about the Kryptonite bike lock because there's been a Kryptonite bike lock on the bike rack at my college for as long as I can remember. There's no bike, just the lock, and I don't think anyone can get it off\n\nhelgi said:\n\nAll of Gene Hackman's characters are a jerk\n\nFixed your post.\n\nhelgi said:\n\nI also heard that sometimes, if he's wearing a modest brown suit, he runs off and abandons his obligations and goes around the town acting like Mr. Bean.\n\nMy mother used to tell me when I was younger, \"Never believe anything you hear and only half of what you see.\" It's the third best piece of advice I've ever been given.\n\nA woman marries a man expecting him to change and he never does.\n\nA man marries a woman expecting her not to change but she does.\n\nAt least I'm pretty sure that's #7. I will have to consult the Journal of Sound Advice when I get home.\n\nI once complained to my mum that she'd never given me that one piece of sage advice that I could trot out whenever I was in that particular scene of my life where it was my turn to say 'It's like my mum always told me...'\n\nSo she told me to say 'Well, there's nowt as queer as folk.'\n\nAnyway, many years later she actually did say something useful, though I'm not sure it counts as advice.\n\nIt's like my mum always told me. It's good to be confused. It gives you something to do."
