        "text": "Here are two late-70s pictures from Sir Lew Grade. Shout Factory is bringing the twin-bill Blu-Ray out in just a few days.\n\nEscape To Athena (1979)\n\nDirected by George P. Cosmatos\n\nStarring Roger Moore, Telly Savalas, David Niven, Stefanie Powers, Claudia Cardinale, Richard Roundtree, Sonny Bono, Elliott Gould, Paul Picerni\n\nEscape To Athena has a crazy cast (Sonny Bono?), gorgeous Greek locations, a terrific motorcycle chase and a cameo from William Holden.\n\nRoger Moore made some interesting pictures in-between his Bond films, and this is one of them — though I’m a bigger fan of Shout At The Devil (1976) and The Wild Geese (1978)\n\nMarch Or Die (1977)\n\nDirected by Dick Richards\n\nStarring Gene Hackman, Terence Hill, Catherine Deneuve, Max von Sydow, Sir Ian Holm\n\nThey tried to make Terence Hill a star in the US, and it didn’t work. Me, I much preferred the Trinity films. Anyway, this is a pretty lavish production, but it should be better than it is. Hackman is always good, of course.\n\nI’m so glad films like this are making their way to Blu-Ray. I’m looking forward to seeing Escape To Athena again.\n\nDirected by Arthur Penn\n\nWritten by Alan Sharp\n\nDirector Of Photography: Bruce Surtees\n\nFilm Editor: Dede Allen\n\nMusic by Michael Small\n\nCast: Gene Hackman (Harry Moseby), Jennifer Warren (Paula), Edward Binns (Joey Ziegler), Harris Yulin (Marty Heller), Kenneth Mars (Nick), Janet Ward (Arlene Iverson), James Woods (Quentin), Anthony Costello (Marv Ellman), John Crawford (Tom Iverson), Melanie Griffith (Delly Grastner), Susan Clark (Ellen Moseby)\n\n__________\n\nThe Seventies were an interesting time for film noir and private eye movies. Surprisingly, there were plenty of them — pictures like Robert Altman’s The Long Goodbye (1973), Roman Polanski’s Chinatown (1974), Stuart Rosenberg’s The Drowning Pool (1975) and Arthur Penn’s Night Moves (1975). They all seemed to drag the genres into a decade they seemed very much at odds with. By this time, both noir and PI movies had seen their conventions spoofed time and time again — and each director headed in a different direction.\n\nBut with the 70s a decade marked by cynicism, doesn’t it make sense that noir would emerge from the shadows?\n\nIn Penn’s case, with Night Moves, it looks like he decided to make his football-player-turned-detective (with a gorgeous 1967 Mustang), Harry Moseby (Gene Hackman), every bit as messed up as the dysfunctional family he’s hired to help sort out. He turns out to be just as lost as the young girl (Melanie Griffith) he’s trying to track down. And that’s what sets this one apart — Moseby’s investigation and introspection get all twisted together before it’s over with. Alan Sharp’s wonderful script juggles this effortlessly.\n\nHackman’s really terrific in this. His Moseby is a burned out guy you somehow can’t help but care about, even as you question a number of the choices he makes along the way. This is one of Hackman’s better performances, and he isn’t lacking for great performances.\n\nYou hear a lot about this being Melanie Griffith’s first movie (and that she’s naked quite a bit), but it’s Jennifer Warren that stands out to me. Paula’s a long way from the femme fatale we’re used to, but just as dangerous. Warren also played Paul Newman’s wife Francine in Slap Shot (1977). She didn’t have a tremendous amount of screen time in that one, but she was really good.\n\nIn a lot of PI movies, the plot sort of meanders along, often a bit incoherently, towards a conclusion that tries to wrap up (almost) everything. Night Moves weaves its lost girl/murder plot and character study together seamlessly, waiting for just the right moment to do so. Arthur Penn really amazes me sometimes. This is one of those times.\n\nNight Moves didn’t do well upon its original release. Something called Jaws opened about the same time. Maybe it was too downbeat, maybe it was just too good, to be successful. Feel good hit of the year it ain’t.\n\nBut there’s plenty to feel good about with the new Blu-Ray from Warner Archive. It’s splendid. Seventies movies have a look all their own, and that’s preserved here flawlessly. This one has the added benefit of having been photographed by the great Bruce Surtees (who shot a number of my favorite films, from Dirty Harry to The Shootist). The disc includes a trailer and a production short from back in the day.\n\nIt’s easy to recommend Night Moves. And for fans of the movie, I can’t imagine you not springing for this Blu-Ray."
