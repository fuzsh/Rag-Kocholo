        "text": "Which as a question word\n\nWe use which in questions as a determiner and interrogative pronoun to ask for specific information:\n\n‘Which car are we going in?’ he asked Alexander.\n\nWhich museums did you visit?\n\nWhich do you prefer? Lemon cake or carrot cake?\n\nWe use which in indirect questions and statements:\n\nIn the Young Cook of Britain competition, the finalists were asked which famous person they would like to cook for.\n\nFind out which way they’re going and we’ll follow.\n\nSee also:\n\nIndirect speech: reporting questions\n\nWhich or what?\n\nWe use both which and what to ask questions. We use which when there is a restricted range of answers. We use what more commonly when the range of answers is not restricted:\n\nWhich is the capital of Liberia? Monrovia or Greenville?\n\nWhat’s the capital of Liberia?\n\nWhich in relative clauses\n\nWe use which in relative clauses to refer to animals and to things:\n\nWe have seen a lot of changes which are good for business.\n\nThe cruise ship, which will depart from Liverpool for a fifteen-night Mediterranean cruise, returns to the Mersey on 29 September.\n\nWe also use which to introduce a relative clause when it refers to a whole clause or sentence:\n\nShe seemed more talkative than usual, which was because she was nervous.\n\nPeople think I sit around drinking coffee all day. Which, of course, I do.\n\nWe often use which with prepositions. Some formal styles prefer to use a preposition before which rather than to leave the preposition ‘hanging’ at the end of the sentence:\n\nThere are several small ponds in which a variety of fish live. (or There are several small ponds which a variety of fish live in.)\n\nSee also:\n\nPrepositions\n\nRelative pronouns: which"
