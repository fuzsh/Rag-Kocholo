        "text": "Every now and then I run into these small-minded types... \"Has your work or research ever been validated by peer-review?\" Like this notion IS the ABSOLUTE end-all/be-all of #innovation. No. Because if 'peers' approved of CTP - WE WOULD ALREADY BE TRAVELING THE #COSMOS. Some people do NOT have common sense. #newscience comes from the fringe: the outside; from persons such as Drazen (and myself, and others before us.) STRUCTURES OF SCIENTIFIC REVOLUTIONS For those in science today stuck in many of the 'crises in science' they find themselves in (including bound into their own group-think) THIS is 'when' #newscience, new #scienceparadigms emerge: from those outside of the crisis-think - proposing something new like CTP. (https://bit.ly/49wxtJK) (https://lnkd.in/guNjNEr3) #innovationinscience #paradigm #outsidethebox\n\nJohn Cutlers recently talk with Gene Kim reminded me of the great book; Wiring the winning organization and the earlier podcast; The Idealcast. So much inspiring content. This metaphor about Steve and Gene moving a couch is great in so many ways. (Transcript from their recent talk) Gene: And so you might think that this is all brawn work, no brain work allowed. And yet, you know, there's actually a whole bunch of problems that don't have obvious answers, like, you know, where's the center of gravity, to get through a narrow doorway around which axis do they rotate? And, you know, to get through a narrow winding staircase, who goes first, do they face forwards or backwards? And of course, they don't need consultants or focus groups, right? Just by picking up the couch, fast [00:02:00] trial and error, um, but most importantly, communication coordination, we can have some confidence that Steve and Gene will be able to achieve what they want to do. But there are all these things that we can do as leaders to make their work more difficult. We can turn off all the lights, right? Which makes the work take longer. They can actually, uh, hurt the furniture, hurt themselves. But there's another thing that leaders can do, um, you know, such as introducing a lot of, uh, noise, loud music, or even introducing an intermediary, where Steve and Gene can no longer talk directly with each other. They have to go through work orders, JIRA, tickets, you know, account managers, lawyers, so forth. Suddenly under those conditions, we can imagine scenarios where they will not be able to achieve their goal. So it's so interesting, right? We haven't changed the nature of the couch. We've actually changed what we call the Layer 3 wiring. And so I think the couch is such an interesting metaphor because it really embodies two very important concepts. Coherence. To what degree can Steve and Gene work as a coherent and unified whole? And coupling, right? They are inherently coupled to each other through the couch.\n\nThe party has just begun. Diamonds will be for everyone and not just for those who can afford an $8,000 engagement ring. Thanks to LGD, the market will widely open up for the huge chunk of population who can afford a $1,000 engagement ring. You wont have to take bank loans for it this time around. Instead of dreaming of buying a tennis bracelet of a smaller size diamonds, one will easily buy bigger size and maybe 3-4 in quantity for different occasions. There is going to be enough demand for the ‘unlimited supply’ and we can already sense it. Natural diamonds are affordable for roughly 13% of global population LGD are affordable for 47.5% of global population. This is a massive opportunity, get on this boat as an early bird and enjoy this ‘party’ until next evolution. #diamonds #jewelry #diamondsforeveryone #labgrowndiamonds"
