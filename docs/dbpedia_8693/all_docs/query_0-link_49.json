The retired film legend (born Eugene Allen Hackman on January 30, 1930) enjoyed a career that spanned over 6 decades until his retirement in 2004.\n\nAfter cutting his teeth in TV parts and off-Broadway shows, Gene earned an Oscar nomination for 1967’s Bonnie & Clyde, basically his first major screen role. He would receive widespread acclaim for 1971’s The French Connection. He won his first Oscar for the part, which premiered a sequel in 1975. He won again 20 years later for the Clint Eastwood movie Unforgiven (1992). His other accolades include four Golden Globes, one Screen Actors Guild Award, two BAFTAs, and one Silver Bear.\n\nOther major roles included A Bridge Too Far (1977), Superman (1978) and its sequels, Hoosiers (1986), Mississippi Burning (1988), The Firm (1993), Get Shorty (1995), Enemy of the State (1998), Antz (1998), Behind Enemy Lines (2001), The Royal Tenenbaums (2001), Runaway Jury (2003), and Welcome to Mooseport (2004), his final film role before retirement.\n\nReady for more Gene?
