'Cause you know what? I'm Angel. I beat the bad guys.”\n\n―Angel[src]\n\nAngel was one of the most well-known vampires in all of vampiric history, legendary for both his savage villainy[8] and his great heroism.[10] Born Liam in 1727 in Galway, Ireland,[11] he was sired by Darla in 1753,[12] taking the name Angelus, he earned notoriety as the worst vampire in history.[8] Both the Master[2] and the First Evil[13] recognized and appreciated how purely evil Angelus was. He was also known as the One with the Angelic Face because of his physical beauty.[2] However, in 1898, Angelus was cursed by the Kalderash people as vengeance for killing their favorite daughter. They returned his soul, forcing him to live eternally in guilt over the countless crimes he had committed.[14]\n\nIn the late 20th century, Angel, as he began calling himself, became an ally and lover of the current Slayer, Buffy Summers. After the two were forced to realize their limitations as a couple,[15] Angel left Buffy and moved to Los Angeles. Believing that even someone as damned as him possessed the potential to become a harbinger of good and redemption, he became a Champion[16] and dedicated himself to \"helping the hopeless\" with the Angel Investigations[3] in the hope of achieving atonement.[16]\n\nEventually, Angel adopted the identity of the masked Twilight and gathered a cabal of humans and demons who had become wary of the rise of multiple Slayers. As Twilight, Angel sought to keep these forces distracted as well as make Buffy grow more focused and stronger, and at the same time, try to keep the deaths as low as he could.[17] When Angel came to his senses and rebelled against the real Twilight, it possessed him[18] and fought Buffy in the ruins of Sunnydale, where she stopped Twilight by destroying the Seed of Wonder, causing the end of magic.[19] After being purged of Twilight, Angel fell into a catatonic state.[20]\n\nUpon awakening, Angel, along with Faith Lehane, once again dedicated himself to redemption, this time by resurrecting his most recent victim: Rupert Giles.[21] He eventually succeeded, and was soon after forced into conflict by the maddened Whistler, who wished to restore magic to the world by unleashing a mystical plague, even if it meant killing billions of people.[22] Angel managed to reason with him, causing Whistler to give up his life by sacrificing himself. Once the world was saved, Angel decided to stay in London and help the people in the newly created Magic Town.[23]\n\nBiography[]\n\nLiam[]\n\n“And what a man you were. A drunk, whoring layabout and a terrible disappointment to your parents.”\n\n―First Evil[src]\n\nAngel was born a human named Liam in Galway, Ireland in 1727[11] to a linen and silk merchant and his wife.[24] Angel would describe being disillusioned with the women of his era, and showed distaste for noblewomen in particular, describing them as \"incredibly dull, simpering morons.\" Above all, he sought to meet someone \"exciting\" and \"interesting.\"[25] By his twenties, Liam had become a drunken, whoring layabout,[13] whose only real ambition in life lay in someday seeing the world. Liam's father displayed near-constant disappointment in him, and was not reluctant to call him out on his shortcomings. Despite his strained relationship with his parents, he and his little sister, Kathy, had mutual affection for each other.[11]\n\nIn 1753, at the age of twenty-six, after a habitual night of drunken debauchery and failed attempts to seduce the family's only maidservant, Liam and his father got into a heated argument; enraged by his son's chronically reckless behavior, his father declared that Liam was wasting his life, and slapped him across the face. Liam argued that he was only what his father had made him, and voiced his decision to leave home. Though his father told him that he would only end up homeless and alone, Liam stormed out. He went to a tavern, where, drunk once more, he caught the eye of a seemingly affluent woman. After being kicked out of the bar for fighting,[11] he followed the woman — the vampire Darla — into an alleyway, where she promised to show him a whole new world then sired him.[12]\n\nAngelus[]\n\n“He was the most vicious creature I ever met... I miss him.”\n\n―Master[src]\n\nLiam's body was buried; at some point during the night, he rose again. Darla visited his grave, where he had his first taste of blood when a groundskeeper caught them and accused them of being grave robbers. In response to Darla's assertion, Liam set about slaughtering his entire village. First, he massacred his own family, whose blood he later described as the \"sweetest of all.\" Liam's little sister, Kathy, had believed her brother had returned to her as an angel, and ignorantly invited him inside the family home. He killed her first, and then murdered his mother. As he killed his father, Liam boasted that despite his father's disapproval, he had managed to make something of himself after all. Whilst gloating over his father's corpse, Darla cruelly deflated Liam, claiming that in the end, his father had claimed the victory because his condemnation would haunt Liam for the remainder of his existence, while his father's suffering, while painful, had been very brief.[11]\n\nLiam took the name \"Angelus,\" presumably inspired by his sister's mistaken belief that he was an angel.[11] He was later described in historical volumes as the \"one with the angelic face,\"[2] and the \"demon with the face of an angel.\"[26] After leaving Ireland behind, Angelus and Darla cut a bloody swath through Wales and Northern England before reaching London in 1760. During Angelus' first meeting with Darla's sire, the Master, he openly mocked the older vampire, despite the Master's greater age, power, and authority. Angelus expressed no interest in the Order of Aurelius' plan to destroy the human world and bring about the return of the Old Ones, as he preferred the hedonistic pleasures of the world above. The Master confronted Darla about her decision to remain underground, and she chose to leave with Angelus.[14]\n\nMay, 1764: Angelus and Darla killed the wife and infant son of vampire hunter Daniel Holtz. They turned Holtz's young daughter into a vampire, forcing him to destroy her.[27] Holtz then devoted himself to capturing Angelus and Darla, and chased them across Europe. He managed to kill almost four-hundred other vampires in the process.[7]\n\n1765: Angelus and Darla had a near miss with Holtz in Arles after making too much noise by ordering room service and then eating the waiters. Darla fled to Vienna, knocking out and abandoning Angelus in a burning barn and riding off on their only horse. After meeting again in Vienna and eating a troubadour in Madrid, Angelus and Darla became acquainted with the vampires James and Elisabeth.[28]\n\n1767: Holtz tracked them down in Marseilles and managed to put numerous arrows in Angelus. After voyaging to Morocco, Holtz briefly lost them in northern Africa.[28]\n\n1771: Holtz tracked Angelus to Rome and captured him. With the assistance of Monsignor Rivalli, Holtz tortured Angelus while trying to figure out how to get Angelus to help him to capture Darla. But instead, Darla came to the rescue with a horde of vampires. Darla declined to kill Holtz, telling Angelus that she was having too much fun tormenting him and he was then \"like family.\" With this, Holtz abandoned his hunt and retired to York until 1774, when a demon named Sahjhan offered to take him to the future in exchange for his promise to kill Angel and Darla in the future.[29]\n\n1786: Angelus sired a Puritan by the name of Penn, who mimicked Angelus by wreaking havoc on his father and killing his family. Over time, he began copying Angelus' \"signature\" of the time, carving a cross-shaped mark on the face of his victims in order to spite God. The two appear to have maintained a relationship throughout Angelus' time as a soulless vampire, as they were scheduled to meet in Italy before Angelus' soul was restored.[26]\n\n1789: A lone Angelus encountered the Beast in Prussia, standing in a field of bodies. The Beast sought Angelus' aid in killing the Svear Priestesses, a group who wished to banish the Beast, whom he could not kill himself. When Angelus declined to assist the Beast, he was violently attacked, but a group of Svear priestesses banished the Beast while Angelus was passing out.[30]\n\nDecember 25, 1838: Angelus won a card game in Dublin, Ireland, and when his opponent, a man named Daniel who was to be married the next day, could not pay, he took his winnings by killing him.[13]\n\n1860: a young woman named Drusilla from London caught the attention of Darla, who then presented her to Angelus as a gift. Drusilla was \"cursed\" with the \"sight.\" While posing as her priest in order to torment her, Angelus killed her family in front of her, which caused Drusilla to flee to a convent. On the day she was to take her holy orders, Angelus massacred the convent. After having sex with Darla on top of Drusilla, Angelus finally pushed her over the edge into complete insanity. It was at that point that he turned her into a vampire.[31] Drusilla was considered Angelus' \"masterpiece,\"[32] an everlasting testament of his finest cruelty, as her immortality meant that her torment would never end.[33] Drusilla joined Angelus and Darla, as the duo became a trio.[14]\n\n1880: Desiring a companion of her own, Drusilla sired the poet William Pratt, to whom Angelus served as a mentor and role model for a while.[34] William went so far as to consider the elder vampire his sire and \"Yoda.\"[35] Angelus taught William about the art of mass slaughter, including an incident during a wedding party where Angelus beat the groom to death with his own arm. When he realized how much William cared for Drusilla, Angelus had sex with her just to hurt him and teach him a lesson, an action William would never forgive.[36]\n\nWilliam got himself, Angelus, Darla, and Drusilla chased out of London and into an abandoned mine shaft in Yorkshire by an angry mob. Angelus and Darla outwardly wondered why they hadn't yet killed William, who had taken the alias \"Spike,\" for his dangerously rebellious behavior. Angelus made an attempt to threaten him with mention of the Slayer, but Spike, who had never heard of the Slayer before, became instantly intrigued, and went on to develop a long-lasting obsession with the idea of killing a Slayer. He would eventually fight and kill two Slayers, and Spike became a particularly renowned vampire as a result.[34]\n\n1883: Angelus killed a female servant named Margaret during a Christmas party in London. The woman had a young son, whom Angelus killed afterwards.[13]\n\n1890: Angelus attended a production of Giselle by the Blinnikov World Ballet Corps, a Russian ballet troupe run by Count Kurskov. Despite being soulless, he was moved to tears during the performance.[37] The same year, Angelus and Spike used a trick that involved them holding hands and beheading their enemies with a length of wire in St. Petersburg, Russia.[38]\n\n1894: Angelus and Spike were captured in Rome, Italy by henchmen of The Immortal, a mysterious and seductive being with whom they both had a fierce rivalry. The two male vampires were restrained while the Immortal had a threesome with Darla and Drusilla, something that, incidentally, the two female vampires had never allowed Angelus and/or Spike to do. Angelus and Spike attempted to take revenge on the Immortal more than once, but failed each time.[39]\n\nThe curse[]\n\n“You don't remember. Everything you've done. For a hundred years. In a moment, you will. The face of everyone you have killed — our daughter's face — they will haunt you and you will know what true suffering is.”\n\n―Kalderash man to Angelus[src]\n\n1898: Angelus' unlife took a pivotal turn when Darla kidnapped the favorite daughter of the Kalderash people in Borşa, Romania, as a \"birthday present' so she could watch.[40] To avenge her death, the Kalderash cursed him with the Ritual of Restoration, which restored his human soul, thus afflicting him with a conscience and condemning him to an eternity of remorse for the crimes and atrocities he had committed while soulless.[12] Bedraggled and dirty, looking like a beggar, he attacked and tried to feed on a woman, but was unable to, hampered by his restored conscience.[40]\n\n1900: In China, during the Boxer Rebellion, Angelus tried to resume his life with Darla, who had abandoned him after finding out that his soul had been restored, but found himself able to kill only animals, murderers, and rapists while protecting innocents from Darla. Darla noticed this, angry at his deception and inability to kill innocent humans while Spike had recently killed a Slayer. She confronted him about it gave him the chance to prove himself by feeding on a baby whose parents Darla had killed. He apologetically refused and fled with it through a window.[14]\n\n1902: Angelus lived in self-imposed isolation, controlling the temptation to feed by avoiding humans altogether. He traveled to the United States, and arrived in New York City via Ellis Island.[40]\n\n1920s: Angelus spent some time in Chicago, where he saved a little lap dog from being run over by a car; however, finding himself tempted to feed on the dog's owner, a young woman who tried to seduce Angel, he harshly rejected her.[41] In Ciudad Juárez, Mexico, Angel had a disagreement with a demon named Boone over a \"señorita,\" for which Boone called him out. Angel fought Boone for three-and-a-half hours until the sun came up and Boone honorably let him go.[42] Angel then spent time in Missoula, Montana during the Great Depression.[16]\n\n1943: During World War II, Angel was coerced into undertaking a secret mission by the Demon Research Initiative. When they called him \"Angelus,\" he informed them that he had shortened his name to \"Angel.\" They sank him to the bottom of the ocean to rescue an American submarine crew from three vampires the Nazis had captured as part of their paranormal research activities: Spike, Nostroyev, and the Prince of Lies. After the American crew had captured the German submarine, the vampires had escaped their bonds and murdered most of the crew; the few survivors sought refuge behind a locked hatch. After the submarine suffered damage from a depth charge, Angel was forced to sire a mortally wounded Ensign, Sam Lawson, as he was the only person who was able to repair the damage, and while Angel didn't care about the mission, he needed it to succeed to get the US government to leave him alone, and he needed the submarine so he would not get trapped on the ocean floor. After these events, Angel went underground until the war was over.[43]\n\n1940s: Angel spent some time in Las Vegas, where he gets acquainted with the gangster Bugsy Siegel.[44]\n\n1952: Angel was a resident of the Hyperion Hotel in Los Angeles. During this time, he drank bottled human blood and attempted to stay to himself, avoiding interaction with other residents and patrons. Despite the numerous strange incidents, murders and suicides running rampant throughout the hotel (caused by a demon), Angel looked the other way when his help would have made a difference. After finding a young woman named Judy Kovacs hiding in his room, Angel tried to preserve his isolation, first by disarming and removing the man chasing her, then by ejecting Judy. However, her repeated attempts to interact with him allowed the two to form a budding friendship, which was very surprising and rare for Angel at that time in his life. Meanwhile, hotel staff and residents, including Judy, continued to become warped and Angel decided to help. He discovered the presence of a Thesulac demon, a paranoia demon affecting the humans in the hotel, but by the time Angel learned how to defeat it and obtained the items required, the entire hotel was overcome with pathological paranoia. Mad with demon-induced hysteria, the hotel residents and staff turned on Judy after their suspicions were raised by a private detective. To save herself, Angel's new friend pointed the mob in his direction, saying he had been found with blood. With rabid fury, they ambushed Angel, beat him, and then hanged him. Embittered by the consequences of becoming close to a human, Angel abandoned Judy and everyone else. Instead of destroying Thesulac, as it was in his power to do, even when the demon gave him the opportunity, he personally gave the vicious demon free rein to prey upon and ravage the inhabitants of the hotel unhindered.[45]\n\n1960s: Angel met the Rat Pack multiple times in Las Vegas, giving advice to Sammy Davis, Jr.[44]\n\n1967: Angel attended Elvis and Priscilla's wedding reception in Las Vegas, since he attends the first taping of the Carol Burnett Show in Los Angeles.[44]\n\nLate 1970s: In New York, Angel witnessed a robbery at a doughnut shop. After the robber shot the employee and fled, Angel stayed with the man as he died. Unable to resist the sight and smell of the clerk's still-warm blood, Angel succumbed to his urges and fed on the body. Deeply disgusted by his own weakness and realizing he could never be a part of human society, Angel fled the shop, and then exiled himself to a life of homelessness, living in alleyways and feeding on rats.[41]\n\n1996: A half-demon named Whistler sought the reclusive Angel and persuaded him to join the fight against the evil that had corrupted him and help the newly-activated Slayer, 15-year-old, Buffy Summers. Angel traveled to Hemery High School in Los Angeles, where he witnessed Buffy being called as the Slayer and her initial training under her Watcher, Merrick, as well as her emotional turmoil caused by her new duties and her parents' deteriorating marriage. Filled with a new purpose in life, Angel resolved to help the Slayer,[12] with whom he had fallen in love.[46]\n\nSunnydale[]\n\n“A vampire in love with a Slayer. It's rather poetic... in a maudlin sort of way.”\n\n―Rupert Giles[src]\n\nAngel followed Buffy to Sunnydale, where he lived in an apartment and consumed bagged human blood.[2] Buffy caught him following her in an alley, at which time he warned her about the Harvest and gave her a silver cross.[47] Though they had a mutual attraction, Buffy was not aware of Angel's vampiric nature until several weeks after their first meeting. They kissed in the girl's bedroom, which caused Angel to unintentionally reveal his vampire face.[2]\n\nThough he fled, Buffy was privy to his secret, and sought to kill him after she mistakenly believed he had attacked her mother. In reality, Angel's sire, Darla, had tricked Joyce Summers into inviting her inside and then bit her. Angel fought with Darla and managed to kill her when Buffy involved herself in the fight. Afterward, he revealed that he was unique among his kind for possessing a soul, as a result of the curse placed upon him as a punishment for murdering the favorite daughter of a Romani tribe. Despite their initial decision to keep distance due to his nature,[2] Angel and Buffy eventually began dating in the following months.[25]\n\nIn 1998, Spike and Drusilla's arrival in Sunnydale created tension in her relationship with Angel. After she witnessed him talking to Drusilla in a park, Angel told Buffy and the Scoobies that he was Drusilla's sire.[33] He was subsequently kidnapped by Spike's minions for a ritual that would restore Drusilla to health. Though Buffy managed to rescue him and save his life, Drusilla still recovered.[48] Drusilla and Spike then sought to reawaken a demon called the Judge to bring an end to the human race. Angel was tasked with traveling abroad to hide one of the pieces of the Judge. Before leaving, he gave Buffy a Claddagh ring for her seventeenth birthday, a traditional courting gift in Ireland. The couple was then apprehended by Spike and his followers, who planned to have him watch Buffy die at the hands of the newly arisen demon.[49]\n\nBuffy and Angel escaped Spike's minions and fled to Angel's apartment, where they had sex.[49] Because Angel experienced a moment of pure happiness, his curse was lifted and Angel lost his soul. He quickly returned to his old ways of evil and began killing humans again. Disgusted that Buffy had caused him to feel love, he vowed to destroy her in a way similar to what he had done to Drusilla.[50]\n\nAngel allied himself once again with Spike and Drusilla and took residence in their factory. Resenting the humiliation he felt because Buffy had made him feel like a human being, Angel took pleasure in tormenting the Slayer and her friends. First, he helped Spike and Drusilla deploy the Judge to incinerate the human race.[50] After Buffy destroyed the Judge, Angel lurked in the shadows, preyed on Buffy's classmates,[51] sent her gruesome messages,[50] and left drawings in her bedroom of her sleeping. He also revealed to her mother that Buffy had sex with him, pretending to be an obsessed, love-struck boyfriend.[52]\n\nAngel then murdered Jenny, which served him in two ways. First, he eliminated an enemy and destroyed her work just as she had managed to successfully decipher the lost curse which could be used to restore his soul. Second, Angel used Jenny's death to torment Giles, who was Jenny's paramour and Buffy's Watcher. Giles went out and tried to kill Angel, though he only succeeded in burning down the factory the vampire lived in.[52]\n\nAlong with Spike and Drusilla, Angel moved to an abandoned mansion. Drusilla then drew his attention to the opportunity of awakening the demon Acathla and bring about the end of the world.[12] Not knowing how to perform the ritual, Angel kidnapped Giles and physically tortured him to interrogate on how to do it.[53]\n\nBuffy went to Angel and they had a sword fight while Spike escaped with Drusilla. With the knowledge extracted from Giles, Angel then activated the vortex to Acathla's dimension. Soon, Willow performed the ritual Jenny had rediscovered and preserved to restore his soul. Ensouled, Angel was at first confused and did not remember what had happened. Since Acathla could only be stopped by the blood of the individual who activated him, Buffy stabbed Angel with a blessed sword. Angel was then sucked into the closing vortex.[53]\n\nA few months later, Angel was released from this hell dimension,[54] reappearing in his mansion in a feral state. Because time flowed differently in other dimensions, he had experienced a century of torment while only a few months had passed on Earth. Buffy aided him in secret, fostering his rehabilitation. Angel was kept in chains, but he eventually broke out and to help Buffy against the violent Pete. Angel killed the boy and recognized Buffy, being able to then say her name again.[55]\n\nBuffy's friends were angry and disappointed when they discovered that Angel had returned and Buffy had not told them. Angel managed to win back some acceptance after he saved Willow from the corrupt former Watcher Gwendolyn Post.[56] Angel began to suspect that his return from hell was not accidental, that he must be meant to serve some unknown purpose. The fear that this purpose was not for the cause of good grew in Angel's mind at Christmastime, when he began to experience what he believed to be hallucinations. However, he was actually being haunted by the First Evil, who claimed to be the one that freed him from Acathla's hell. The First, able to adopt the appearances of Angel's past victims, lashed him with guilt and tempted him to end it all by losing his soul once again and killing Buffy. Instead, Angel chose to kill himself by waiting outside for the sun to rise. While he denied Buffy's pleas to continue living, it began to snow on Sunnydale for the first time, and the sun was blotted out all Christmas.[13]\n\nIn 1999, the latest Slayer, Faith, began to go rogue after accidentally killing the Deputy Mayor Allan Finch; Angel attempted to rehabilitate her, but his chances at redeeming her were ruined by the interference of Buffy's new Watcher, Wesley Wyndam-Pryce, and a special ops team sent by the Watchers Council.[57] Later, when Faith began working as a double agent for the Mayor Richard Wilkins, the duo attempted to remove Angel's soul once again and appeared to succeed; however, Angel only acted as if he was soulless as part of a plan that exposed Faith's new loyalties.[58]\n\nAngel and Buffy tried to date, going to the movies, more scenic patrols, and picnics in the cemetery. However, Angel worried about Buffy's future with him, with his inability to give her a family or a normal human life. After hearing this concerns as well from Mayor Wilkins and Joyce, Angel decided to leave Buffy and Sunnydale. He broke up with Buffy in the sewer when she told him about her prom being the next night, but he surprised her appearing in the dance.[15]\n\nBefore the Mayor's Ascension, Faith infected Angel with the Killer of the Dead, a poison that slowly killed vampires and could only be cured by the blood of a Slayer. Having failed to bring Faith to cure Angel, Buffy forced him to feed on her. He almost killed her, but, having quickly recovered from his poison, Angel rushed Buffy to the hospital. There, he stopped the Mayor from smothering Buffy.[59]\n\nAngel promised Buffy that he would stay until Sunnydale High School's graduation day, to help avert the Mayor's Ascension. He also warned her that, if they survived the ordeal, he would leave without saying goodbye. During the battle, Angel commanded a small number of fighters to surround the Mayor's vampire henchmen. After the destruction of Sunnydale High,[59] Angel departed for Los Angeles.[16]\n\nLos Angeles[]\n\nAngel Investigations[]\n\nIn Los Angeles, Angel again began to isolate himself from humanity, in order to combat the lust for human blood that had been awakened within him after feeding on Buffy. Soon enough, he received support in his attempts to redeem himself in the service of others. First, Doyle, a half-Brachen demon and fellow Irishman with visions sent by the Powers That Be to be Angel's guide. Doyle encouraged Angel not to shy away from human interaction, warning him that isolating himself from humanity would eventually lead to him forgetting why they need to be protected, and feeding on them. Almost immediately thereafter, Angel ran into Cordelia Chase, a former classmate of Buffy's who had moved to Los Angeles to find wealth and fame.[16] The trio formed Angel Investigations, a private detective agency whose mission statement was to \"help the hopeless.\"[3] Doing this, Angel attracted the attention of the evil law firm, Wolfram & Hart.[16]\n\nThe trio managed to do a lot of good,[60][3] but, when Doyle had a vision of Buffy in danger[61] at Thanksgiving, Angel immediately returned to Sunnydale to help against Hus, a Native American avenging spirit accidentally set free by Xander's construction crew. However, Angel made his presence known to all of the Scoobies except Buffy, under the belief that his presence would only distract and endanger her even more.[62]\n\nUpon discovering the truth, Buffy, hurt that Angel never revealed his presence to her, immediately traveled to Los Angeles to confront him, and the two agreed to stay away from one another for the time being. Just as she was about to leave, however, the two were attacked by a Mohra demon. Though the duo succeeded in wounding it, the Mohra escaped, and Buffy and Angel immediately tracked it down in the sewers. The two became separated, and Angel seemingly killed the demon, and in doing so, its blood mixed with his own and resurrected him, making him human again. Buffy and Angel reveled in finally being able to be happy together, but Angel soon discovered that the Powers That Be had not yet offered him forgiveness as he had not sufficiently atoned. When Angel was nearly killed by the regenerated Mohra, Buffy managed to slay it with his help. Realizing that he would only ever be a burden to Buffy, and would be unable to protect her as a human, Angel made the decision to have the Oracles rewind time to reverse his transformation into a human, leaving no one but himself with any memory of the incident.[63]\n\nEventually, Doyle, Angel's trusted friend and sole connection to the Powers That Be, sacrificed himself to save a group of innocents, leading Angel to become even more protective of those few he held dear. Wesley Wyndam-Pryce, who had briefly served as Watcher to both Buffy and Faith in Sunnydale, arrived in Los Angeles around that time, claiming to be a \"rogue demon hunter,\" a \"lone wolf sort\" who only worked solo. After their first case, however, Wesley was eager to stay and assist Angel and Cordelia, who had inherited the visions from the Powers that Be from Doyle, in their mission.[64] A few months later, they were joined by lifelong demon fighter Charles Gunn after Angel resolved a vampire-human street conflict that was turning in favor of the former.[65]\n\nIn 2000, three young Wolfram & Hart associates, Lindsey McDonald, Lee Mercer, and Lilah Morgan, attempted to have Faith assassinate Angel. After an intense duel in which the Slayer seemed to have the upper hand, Faith broke down and pleaded with Angel to kill her.[40] Even as Buffy, the Watchers Council, and the Los Angeles Police Department pursued Faith, Angel continued to help her. When Faith gave herself up to the police, he and Buffy got into an argument, during which Buffy used her relationship with her new boyfriend, Riley Finn, to attack him. In response, Angel launched a tirade against Buffy, reminding her that, while it was great that she had moved on, he himself could not and had no one with whom to share his pain, culminating in him telling Buffy that she didn't know him anymore and that she had no right to just show up with her \"great new life\" and tell him how to do things in \"his city\" before harshly ordering her to go back to Sunnydale.[66]\n\nImmediately afterward, Angel traveled to Sunnydale to make amends. Though he fought Riley and the Initiative in the process, he managed to get to Buffy and apologize, who also apologized for butting into his life, and Angel departed after informing Buffy that he didn't like Riley, much to Buffy's amusement.[67]\n\nLater, Angel and his teammates uncovered the Shanshu Prophecy. The prophecy revealed that the vampire with a soul would play a pivotal role in the apocalypse, and upon fulfilling his destiny, would be rewarded by being made human.[68]\n\nThe Angel Investigations team enlisted the help of demon karaoke bar-owner, Lorne, initially known only as the Host. Both prescient and empathic, Lorne could sense the futures of humans and demons when they sang.[69]\n\nAs Angel continued to help the hopeless in Los Angeles, his good deeds began seriously to disrupt the plans of Wolfram & Hart. In an attempt to control him, the firm resurrected his sire and former lover, Darla, though she came back as a human rather than as a vampire. Angel became obsessed with Darla on two fronts; at first, he wanted to prove that she was actually back and not just a figment of his imagination,[31] and, second, he desired to save her when it was revealed that she was dying from the same disease that was killing her before she had been sired by the Master. Wolfram & Hart then summoned Drusilla,[70] who turned Darla into a vampire again. Feeling anguish at his failure to save Darla and fury at Wolfram & Hart for their machinations, Angel fired his crew[71] and embarked on a vendetta against both the law firm and the newly reunited Darla and Drusilla.[72] His actions also included allowing Drusilla and Darla to slaughter a number of prominent Wolfram & Hart employees, even locking them in the room.[71]\n\nIn 2001, Holland Manners succeeded in breaking Angel's spirit by telling him that the power of Wolfram & Hart came from the evil within humanity itself and that nothing Angel did would ever amount to anything; depressed and tortured, Angel had sex with Darla in an attempt to shed his soul,[73] but he only found \"perfect despair.\" An epiphany followed, and Angel realized that his purpose was still to do all the good he could, even if he couldn't do all the good he wanted to. Having hoped to get Angel back, Darla was disgusted and infuriated by Angel's epiphany, and left Los Angeles. The group finally reconciled,[74] and Wesley was appointed the official leader. But Angel's relationship with his teammates, particularly Cordelia, was strained, though things improved rather quickly.[75]\n\nAfter the death of Buffy's mother, Angel returned to Sunnydale to comfort Buffy, and the two spent a night discussing how life would continue after Joyce's death. Angel assured Buffy that she was strong and would find her way over time, and offered to stay in Sunnydale as long as she needed him, though she knew that he could not stay for long. Nonetheless, Buffy appreciated that he came, and he remained with her until sunrise.[76]\n\nAfterward, Cordelia was sucked into Lorne's home dimension of Pylea, and the Angel Investigations team followed her. Eventually, after Angel defeated the undefeated Champion of Pylea, the Groosalugg, they returned with a new team member, Winifred \"Fred\" Burkle, in tow, and learned that Buffy had died.[77][78]\n\nFatherhood[]\n\nAngel spent several months mourning Buffy's death in a Tibetan monastery in Sri Lanka, returning despondent and believing that he had betrayed Buffy by continuing to live while she was dead. Once back in Los Angeles, Cordelia assured Angel that he was in fact honoring her memory by continuing to fight the good fight in Buffy's stead.[28] After Buffy was resurrected a few months later by Willow, Angel went to meet her between Sunnydale and Los Angeles.[79][80]\n\nDespite his still untarnished love for Buffy, Angel eventually realized his previously platonic love for Cordelia had grown romantic. Before he had a chance to confess his feelings, however, Darla returned, miraculously pregnant. The previous year, Angel had endured trials in order to win a new life for Darla as she was dying. However, Darla had already been given a second chance at life and Angel's prize seemingly went to waste.[70] However, Darla became pregnant thanks to the one night they had had sex, which was thought to be impossible for vampires. Influenced by the soul of the child growing inside her, because she was dead and therefore could not give birth to the child, Darla staked herself, leaving only a crying baby.[81] Angel was overcome with parental love, and named their child Connor,[7] in recognition of his Irish heritage.[82]\n\nIn 2002, false prophecies, time travelers, and betrayal led to Angel losing his infant son to an old enemy, Holtz, who abducted Connor soon after his birth, taking him to the dimension of Quor'toth,[83] where time passed differently.[84] Wesley unintentionally brought about the kidnapping due to uncovering a false prophecy that stated \"the father will kill the son,\"[83] and Angel attempted to kill Wesley in the hospital;[85] Wesley was subsequently fired from Angel Investigations,[86] while Angel resumed his position as the team's leader. Unexpectedly, Connor returned days later,[87] a young man of 18 years old[88] who had been raised by Holtz to be a warrior and to believe that Angel was a soulless monster. Holtz took his own life in such a way that Connor was led to believe he was killed by Angel,[84] making Connor hate his father and be determined to make him pay for the suffering he had caused Holtz and others.[89] Connor then sank his father to the bottom of the ocean in a steel coffin, while Cordelia ascended to a higher plane, the feelings shared between her and Angel still left unspoken.[90]\n\nRescued by Wesley from his watery prison, Angel's relationship with Connor was strained.[91] It was complicated further by the return of an amnesiac Cordelia, who preferred to stay with Connor because he told her the truth while the others hid the truth from her.[92]\n\nIn 2003, a very powerful demon known only as the Beast arrived in Los Angeles and began an attempt to bring forth an apocalypse.[93] After Cordelia had a vision of soulless Angel facing the Beast in the past which Angel did not recall, Angel's worst fears were realized when he had to strip himself of his soul and revert to his evil self in order to defeat it.[30] A spell had been cast before the Beast's arrival which erased all reference to it in this dimension, with Angelus being immune because he technically didn't exist anymore when the spell was cast.[94] While soulless, Angel did indeed overcome the Beast and realized that the Beast was a mere \"flunky\" serving an even more powerful evil; the Beast he knew was only interested in smashing and slaughter, and it was unlikely that it would have become smarter in the years since his initial encounter with him.[95]\n\nAlthough he was momentarily free to wreak a little havoc of his own while soulless, Angel was recaptured and re-ensouled after a fight with Faith. Faith defeated Angel but when she refused to kill him, he regained the upper hand and drank from the Slayer, who had injected herself with the Orpheus drug.[96] Faith (who had almost died in her quest to capture him) and Willow helped to accomplish Angel's restoration via a brief but violent internal mental duel between his soulless and ensouled states.[41]\n\nAfter his soul was restored, Angel, using information that he had acquired during his freedom, figured out that the enemy he had been battling was a little closer to home than the group had previously considered. He realized that, whatever the Beastmaster was, they were using Cordelia's body to carry out its plans, and they had seduced Angel's son Connor over to their side, warping the youth further and increasing the gap between Angel and his son.[97][98] After fighting and defeating the \"Beastmaster,\" the former Power That Be known as Jasmine,[99] Angel was offered the Los Angeles branch of Wolfram & Hart as their thanks for ending world peace by killing Jasmine. Angel acted against all of his instincts and made a deal with his sworn enemy in exchange for them erasing Connor's memories and giving him a normal life, and trying to find a way to cure Cordelia who had gone into a coma.[100]\n\nSoon after the events in Los Angeles, Angel traveled to Sunnydale to give Buffy an amulet he had obtained from Wolfram & Hart.[100] He was told that it would play a role in the upcoming battle against the First Evil and had to be worn by someone with a soul, but more than human — a champion.[101] He helped Buffy in her fight against Caleb, but she insisted that she finish it on her own. After the fight concluded, they shared a kiss while being unknowingly watched by Spike, along with the First Evil.[102] Angel offered to fight with her in the battle, but Buffy told him to go prepare his crew for a second front in case the Scoobies failed to stop the First. They discussed Spike and the return of his soul, along with Buffy's feelings for him. The conversation shifted to Buffy's future, and whether Angel would be a part of it romantically. She told him that it would be a long time, if ever, but she sometimes envisioned a future with him. Accepting this, Angel returned to Los Angeles to prepare the second front, hoping he would not have to use it, and told Buffy, \"I ain't getting any older.\"[101]\n\nCEO of Wolfram & Hart[]\n\nAngel's year spent running Wolfram & Hart was one marred with challenge and self-doubt. Trying to fight evil from within the belly of the beast proved to be more difficult than even he had imagined, with the lines of good and evil becoming ever more gray with every action taken,[103] and he soon discovered that his allies in the Scooby Gang, including Buffy, had deemed him untrustworthy.[104] Shortly after Angel assumed control of the law firm, matters were further complicated when Spike appeared as a ghost,[8] emerging from the amulet Angel had given Buffy and that was then sent back to Angel in the mail.[103] Then both possessed souls, and both were still in love with Buffy; they had evolved into very different heroes in the war against evil. Forced to co-exist, they waged a protracted, insidious duel of wills.[8]\n\nWhen Angel and Spike fought over the Cup of Perpetual Torment — supposedly the key that would determine which of them was the true vampire champion — Spike told Angel: \"You had a soul forced on you. As a curse. Make you suffer for all the horrible things you've done. Me, I fought for my soul, went through the demon trials, almost did me in a dozen times over, but I kept fighting. Because I knew it was the right thing to do. It's my destiny.\" Although Angel denied this claim at the time, the fight ended when Spike defeated Angel.[36] However, Spike's victory and subsequent role as a champion[105] was later revealed to be part of Lindsey's plans to undermine Angel's confidence and new position, allowing Angel to regain his focus and faith in himself after a final meeting with Cordelia. With Lindsey out of the way, Spike and Angel came to an understanding that let the two of them operate as a lethal team when the two ended up fighting side-by-side.[106]\n\nIn 2004, while investigating the sinister children's program Smile Time, Angel was turned into a puppet. Angel managed to stop the puppet demons' plans and save the children of Los Angeles. He remained a puppet for several days until the spell wore off. It was around this time that he realized werewolf Nina Ash was attracted to him, and the pair started dating.[107]\n\nDuring this time, Andrew let Angel know the Scooby Gang no longer trusted him due to his alliance with Wolfram & Hart.[104] Once Angel had the opportunity, he went to Rome with Spike in attempt to see Buffy, but they were unable to get close to the Slayer[39] they didn't know had been just a decoy.[108]\n\nAngel was elated when Cordelia finally awoke from her coma. Cordelia and Angel discussed how skewed he got from his path and how lost he was without her, Cordelia was shocked to learn that he and the others had taken over \"Evil Incorporated.\" Before Cordelia took her leave, she and Angel finally revealed their feelings for each other, culminating in a kiss.[106] The kiss was instrumental in Angel returning to his path; Cordelia passed onto Angel a single vision, which came later that night, and Angel realized what he had to do.[109]\n\nAngel was later reunited with his son, Connor, when the latter was forced to fulfill his destiny by killing the demon Sahjhan. As a result of this, Connor's memories were returned to him and he remembered that Angel was his father.[110]\n\nAngel finally understood that he would never be able to completely stop the forces of evil, but that he could temporarily sever the Senior Partners' hold on Earth and stop their apocalyptic plans. To this end, Angel pretended to delve deeper into the darkness and fooled the Senior Partners and his teammates into thinking that he desired to join the Circle of the Black Thorn, the Senior Partners' instruments on Earth.[109] He even went so far as to sign away his candidacy for the Shanshu Prophecy to prove his loyalty, exploiting the Circle's inability to realize that he would do good for its own sake rather than to receive a reward.[111]\n\nTogether with his comrades, Angel prepared to destroy the Circle of the Black Thorn, a battle that none of them expected to survive. He instructed his teammates to spend the day as if it was their last as he spent it by visiting Connor who revealed to his father that he regained his memories and appreciated what Angel did for him but wanted to keep it at that. Later that night, Team Angel assassinated the members of the Circle of the Black Thorn with Angel taking on Marcus Hamilton with the help of Connor. In this effort, Gunn was badly wounded, and Wesley was killed. Gunn manages to make it to the meeting point, the alley behind the Hyperion Hotel, where he, Angel, Spike, and Illyria engaged in battle with the dark armies that the Senior Partners had sent against them.[111]\n\nFall of Los Angeles[]\n\nDuring the battle, Angel was teleported away from Gunn and towards the dragon he later befriended, who had been tricked in fighting for Wolfram & Hart; Gunn was dragged away and subsequently turned into a vampire.[112] The Senior Partners sent all of Los Angeles to a hell dimension between moments of time, turning the city into an apocalyptic battlefield full of demons.[113][114]\n\nAt the same moment, they rendered Angel human to deprive him of his strength and immortality when he needed it most; unaware of the change, he leaped off a rooftop, breaking his legs and back. He was discovered by Wesley, who returned as a ghost to act as liaison between Angel and the Senior Partners.[115] The dragon took Angel back to W&H, where he relied on neo-primitive healing salves and incantations to repair his broken body. The process took months, and Angel spent every second awake and in agony; to endure the pain, he spoke to an imaginary Cordelia. Believing he was talking to him, the dragon came to believe its own name was Cordelia.[116]\n\nWith his body healed, Angel, using various spells and enchantments to provide himself with his vampiric abilities, began patrolling the hell-ridden city with the dragon Cordelia, rescuing citizens and sending them, anonymously, to a safe-house run by Connor, Nina, and Gwen Raiden. His mission was complicated by the deaths of the Demon Lords who had taken control over areas of Los Angeles.[113] Angel declared war on the Demon Lords, challenging them to a battle to liberate the city.[117] Initially alone in the fight, he was soon aided by his old friends, Spike, Illyria, Connor, Gwen, Nina, the Groosalugg, Lorne, and Wesley,[118] and successfully tricked the Lords into killing themselves with the Hagun shafts.[119]\n\nFollowing their victory, Team Angel returned to their old base, the Hyperion Hotel,[119] where Angel resumed his patrols of the city. After killing a nest of vampires, Illyria revealed to the group that Angel was no longer a vampire, leaving Connor feeling angry and betrayed. When he asked Illyria to seek out the most powerful vampire in \"Hell-A,\" Angel was horrified when she led him to Gunn.[120] Defeating Angel in a duel, Gunn undid the magicks keeping Angel alive, reopening every wound he had suffered since turning human.[121]\n\nAs he died, Angel was visited by the spirit of Cordelia to facilitate his passing, but Angel resigned himself to death after receiving a vision from the Senior Partners regarding his role in the Shanshu Prophecy; himself standing alone surrounded by corpses and destruction.[116] However, last-minute encouragement from Connor inspired him to keep fighting,[122] and Angel's friends healed his injuries, but at the same time, Gunn caused Illyria to revert to her true form.[123] As Illyria prepared to end all existence, Angel devised a plan to stop her; he had Betta George telepathically force Spike and Wesley's memories of Fred into Illyria's mind. The distracted Illyria was then taken down by the Senior Partners' forces. Meanwhile, Connor was mortally wounded by Gunn and died in his father's arms.[124]\n\nRealizing that the Senior Partners needed him alive for their plans, Angel provoked Gunn into beheading him with the flaming sword. As planned, the Senior Partners reset the timeline to the last point Angel was alive, the moment before Los Angeles was sent to Hell. This time, Angel rescued Gunn before he was sired and took him to a hospital, and tearfully reunited with a resurrected Connor. However, the Wolfram & Hart building had mysteriously vanished from existence, and everybody remembered their time in Hell, making Angel and his allies city-wide celebrities recognized for their heroism.[10] Giving Cordelia the dragon over to the Groosalugg to remain as inconspicuous as possible, Angel reopened Angel Investigations.[125]\n\nTwilight[]\n\n“Powerful people — governments — lining up to wipe out the 'terrorists' you created. Demons weren't thrilled either. I put on a mask, talk about 'Master Plans'... distract them. Keep the body count as low as I can while I push.”\n\n―Angel[src]\n\nAt some point, Angel gained new abilities after a meeting with a shape-shifting higher power, including flight and invulnerability, which he quickly used to save a damaged airplane.[126] With governments and demons fearful of the new Slayers created by Buffy and plotting to destroy them, Angel was approached by Whistler, the very same demon who originally put him on his heroic path, and the higher power itself, who presented him with numerous possible future scenarios, those of which that depict Angel fighting alongside Buffy, ending with both of them dying in battle, and insisted that the only way for Angel to save them both was to fight against Buffy,[127] stating that if Angel did not do so, the entire world would go to Hell like Los Angeles did.[21]\n\nThough initially reluctant to deceive Buffy,[127] Angel assumed the identity of \"Twilight\" and gathered a cabal of those most likely to oppose the Slayer Organization army,[126] consisting of several demons[128] and half-demons,[21] members of the United States military such as General Voll,[129] and Lieutenant Molter,[130] as well as Buffy's old enemies Warren Mears and Amy Madison[131] and her ex-boyfriend Agent Riley Finn, the latter of whom was acting as a double agent for Buffy, though \"Twilight\" was aware of this fact.[127] Angel's supposed goal was to bring about the end of magic and eliminate all Slayers. However, his true goal was to keep the anti-Slayer forces distracted with his supposed \"master plan,\" thus allowing him to coordinate the anti-Slayer movement and limit the potential damage that might result had these factions struck independently, while at the same time give Buffy a concrete threat to fight against, keeping her focused and ready for the challenges that lay ahead, while also guiding her into a position where she would somehow acquire powers similar to his.[126]\n\nAs Twilight, Angel orchestrated the training of rogue Slayer Genevieve Savidge by the warlock Roden[132] — which resulted in the deaths of both threats to Buffy[130] — a mystical missile attack on Slayer Organization command center,[131] and full scale siege on the Tibetan monastery where lived Oz and his wife Bayarmaa.[133] During the siege, Twilight left behind his \"seconds\" — Amy, Warren, and the General — to kidnap Giles, Faith, and Andrew.[134]\n\nHe took them to his headquarters, which was magically cloaked three seconds in the future, though Buffy tracked him down when the cloak was undone by Willow and Amy. Confronted by Buffy — then possessing strength, invulnerability, and flight like his own — Twilight chose to reveal his true identity to her. Though initially enraged by this, Buffy, under the influence of a glowing aura, was moved when Angel explained his plan, and kissed him. The two give in to their passions and engaged in airborne sex, subsequently finding themselves in a paradise dimension: Twilight. Giles explains to the others that the current events tie in to a prophecy of a supernatural upheaval where the world shall be recreated after a Slayer changes the world, with Buffy and Angel having been selected to serve as the catalysts of that change.[135]\n\nDespite the prospects of eternal happiness with Angel in the new paradise dimension, Buffy chooses to return upon witnessing her friends and family fighting the resulting demonic hordes. Angel agrees to join her, only for the fight to be interrupted when Spike appears claiming to have the answer to the current crisis.[136] Later, Buffy confesses to Angel that it was the \"weirdest best day\" of her life and tells him that he had her heart. However, given Angel's currently tense relationship with Spike, as well as the Scoobies' current hostility towards him, Buffy asked Angel to help protect the Slayers from the currently-attacking demons while she went with Spike to investigate his claims.[126]\n\nWhile in the midst of doing so, however, Angel encountered the same higher power who granted him his new powers, this time in the form of a winged lion. The power revealed itself to be the very dimension, itself called \"Twilight,\" that Buffy and Angel chose to abandon, and insisted that Angel and Buffy finish what they started. To this end, Twilight seemingly possessed Angel and sent him to the ruins of Sunnydale to stop the Scoobies and Spike.[18] Although Buffy was able to keep Angel occupied long enough to destroy the Seed of Wonder, Angel killed Giles before he was returned to normal.[19] Angel awoke to his senses, initially completely unaware of what he had done. Xander quickly jumped on him and started punching him, then grabbed the slayer scythe to stake him. Angel weakly defended himself, reminding him of his possession, yet barely put up a fight against Xander. However, Angel was spared when Buffy saved his life and prevented her friend from killing him.[137] Following this, Angel had been reduced to an apparently catatonic state, with Faith taking care of him in the London flat that Giles left to her as she feels that she was the only person who would not judge Angel for his actions as Twilight due to her past experience with redemption.[20]\n\nResurrecting Giles[]\n\n“Take his place? I could never take his place. I'm going to bring Giles back to life.”\n\n―Angel[src]\n\nIn London, Angel was confined to Giles' flat where he remained in a state of intense depression for a prolonged period of time. Faith cared for him and in an attempt to speed up his recovery, read him passages from Giles' old Watchers Diaries. After hearing about the time Giles bound a Plagiarus demon to temporarily save a little girl, Angel suddenly recuperated and went after the demon with Faith, freeing the child. Later, Angel told Faith he wanted to continue Giles' work where he'd left off and revealed his decision to bring Giles back to life.[21] Meanwhile, Angel kept in the shadows of London to avoid being seen by the local Slayer squad Faith mentored,[138] most of whom wanted him dead for his actions as Twilight, in special Nadira Kureishi.[21]\n\nWhile Giles had died a natural death, Angel intended to work on his soul rather than his body. Faith was skeptical of his plan but agreed to help Angel.[138] They tracked Morah Blood down at a demon auction, hoping of using it recover Giles' body once his soul had been restored. However, they had to face Angel's old associates Pearl and Nash, who also sought the Blood of Eternity and wanted vengeance against Angel for falsely leading them as Twilight.[139] However, Angel and Faith discovered that, in the new magicless world, Mohra blood did not regenerate dead flesh with stability but triggered perpetual tumorous regeneration.[140]\n\nFaith learned about the new \"it\" vampire, known as Mother Superior, who ran a cult in a nearby church. Angel quickly brought up the possibility a Lorophage demon was responsible for the bouts of psychosis blighting the city, as victims of Lorophage attacks oftentimes lost their sanity as a result of their trauma being brought to the surface too suddenly when the demon fed from them. With the help of an old associate of Giles, Alasdair Coames, Angel realized that a vampire might be controlling the Lorophage through hypnosis. Angel and Faith followed a lead to Mother Superior's church and found both the Lorophage demon and a completely sane Drusilla.[141]\n\nDrusilla revealed to Angel the Lorophage demon had consumed the traumatic memories that had caused her lunacy. She had chosen to help people with her newfound clarity, but, as Angel was aware, her efforts had gone in vain. He attempted to kill the Lorophage to prevent further problems, but it easily fought him off. Drusilla then offered to remove his suffering. He refused, and along with Faith, left the church. He met Faith's father back at the apartment and urged her to reconnect with him; he then went to the Easter End of London, to the old house where Drusilla had lived with her family as a human. Drusilla was already there waiting for him, and once again begged him to let her take away his pain. He refused again and apologized for what he had done to her; however, she declared that she no longer cared. She was able to see that he had attached a magical item known as the Tooth of Ammut to his body, which he intended to use to draw the fragments of Giles' soul trapped in demons and other mystical sources into his body.[32]\n\nWhen he arrived at the apartment again, he and Faith confronted her father, who revealed that he had come to ask his Slayer daughter to kill a mobster for him. She turned him down, but when the man showed up looking for him, she and Angel were forced to fight him off; in a moment of rage she cut off the man's hand, and in remorse, fled the scene.[142] Angel followed her to Drusilla's church, where she had hoped to have her pain alleviated by the Lorophage. Although they initially accepted Drusilla's gift, Angel convinced her to reject it with the justification that the loss of her pain would only deprive of her of the emotional strength she had gained through maturation. Angel then forced the Lorophage to feed on itself, releasing the torment it had consumed from Drusilla, Faith and its other victims. Drusilla begged Angel not to force her to take back her pain, but as it returned to her body she once again lost all sense. Before running away, she gave Angel a teary and foreboding message, foretelling his dark future involving the three \"voices\" that would soon come to inhabit his body. Having saved each other once more, Angel and Faith made an uneasy truce. Faith declared her appreciation to Angel for continuing to believe in her, and as they walked away together, they reflected about Drusilla's past as a saintly human. Faith proclaimed Drusilla to be a mess, and although Angel openly agreed with her, he made the closing statement: \"But before she met me, she was beautiful.\"[143]\n\nBack at the flat, they were surprised to find two young women: Giles' great aunts, Lavinia and Sophronia Fairweather, who had been powerful mystics before magic was removed from the world. After dealing with the unfortunate effects of the aunts magical deals, Angel and Faith were suddenly visited by Willow Rosenberg.[144] Having already deduced Angel's plan to bring Giles back, Willow dismissed him as he was selfish, stupid, reckless, and delusional to think that his attempts would not end in disaster, particularly after all of the pain and suffering she put Buffy and the rest of the gang through after Buffy's own resurrection. However, despite her misgivings, Willow decided to help Angel with his plans because she herself needed him, stating that she needed Connor to bring magic back to Earth; in order to regain her magic, she needed to travel to another dimension where magic still existed and \"soak up\" the energy from there, but the only dimension that could still be accessed from this world was Quor'toth as there were never any portals to Quor'toth in the first place. Having discovered a ritual that might allow her to access Quor'toth using the residual energy in the Scythe as a \"battery,\" Willow needed something from the target dimension to access it in the first place, requiring Connor due to the time he had spent in that world.[145]\n\nAngel was unsurprisingly furious with Willow for wanting to involve his son in her plans, at which point Willow snapped and blasted him for comparing her to him before breaking down in tears and insisting that the Earth was dying without magic and she needed to save it. Seeing Willow's inner turmoil, Angel was more sympathetic and agreed to take her to Connor and talk to him, but made it clear to Willow that it was Connor's choice to go along with her plan. Making their way to Los Angeles, the group reunited with Gunn and Connor, the latter of whom unhesitatingly agreed to Willow's plan because he had seen what was happening and knew that Willow was right. Using the Scythe to carve symbols into Connor's body, Willow managed to open an entrance to Quor'toth in the Hyperion Hotel.[145]\n\nWillow's plan proved successful. In Quor'toth, Connor served as a guide, while Willow reminded Angel about the possible consequences of being in another dimension. They eventually came across dog-like demons who worshiped Connor; wanting to help them, Connor decided to stay.[146] Once they rescued the imprisoned demons, Willow opened a portal to the world without shrimp, but they were attacked by the Old One called Quor'toth. Willow tried to fight him off, but was at first overcome. Angel encouraged her by prompting her to reflect on how weak she had become without magic. As Willow regained her confidence, the magic began to corrupt her.[147]\n\nIn an attempt to calm her, Angel convinced Willow that she was strong enough to fight both the darkness and the demon. Still, she could not control herself, and transformed into \"Dark Willow.\" She dropped a mountain on Quor'toth, and preached her desire to rule over the entire dimension. As she rampaged, Angel concocted a plan. Faith launched him into the sky, where he managed to sink his teeth into Willow's throat. His plan worked, and Willow returned to normal and fainted from fatigue. Angel struggled briefly with the urge to continue feeding on her; startled and frightened, he instructed that Faith kill him. She came close to doing so at his request, but was stopped by both Willow and Connor. In the wake of the battle, Angel and Willow managed to reconcile to a degree; she revealed that although she hadn't yet forgiven him, she couldn't hate him either. Willow allowed him to take the fragment of Giles' soul from the Scythe, and he, Faith, and Connor returned to Los Angeles while Willow and Connor's worshipers escaped to the world without shrimp.[148]\n\nBack in London, Angel met up with Whistler at a pizzeria on the anniversary of their first encounter in New York. Angel was furious with him when he realized that he was working with Pearl and Nash, and would have resorted to violence, had Whistler not broken his wrist and ordered him to sit down. After the two reminisced about the day they had met, Whistler criticized Angel for abandoning their plan before its completion. Unphased by Whistler's accusations, Angel justified that his friends had been in danger, and that he had simply wanted to help. He inculpated Whistler for allowing so many people to die for his cause, and for manipulating both him and Buffy in the past. Whistler did not deny this, but calmly revealed that Angel and Buffy's meeting had been predestined long before. He also told Angel about his parents, a pureblood demon and an agent of the Powers That Be, who had been eliminated as a result of their forbidden relationship.[149]\n\nSurprised by the revelation of Whistler's background, Angel became more sympathetic. Whistler then told him that before the Seed of Wonder had been destroyed, he had experienced one final vision, relaying a horrid possible future. Whistler told Angel that he wanted his help to prevent it, warranting that having some people die would be better than allowing the world end. Angel admitted his appreciation to Whistler for giving him a purpose, and for allowing him to meet Buffy, but expressed that he wouldn't participate in anything that would sacrifice the lives of innocent people, despite Whistler's fixation on \"balance.\" Angered, Whistler attacked Angel and nearly staked him before managing to stop himself, remarking that Angel was still his \"favorite kid\" and he didn't want to kill him. Regardless, Whistler warned Angel that he would not be so lucky should their paths cross again.[149]\n\nAngel and Faith then traveled to Peru and retrieved the Crown of Coils from a demons' lair, which granted regenerative abilities to both living creatures and corpses. Back to London, they put the Crown in Alasdair's care and went to the cemetery where Giles' had been buried to exhume his remains. However, upon digging up his coffin, they found his body missing and realized it had been taken before the coffin was ever buried.[150]\n\nNadira and her fellow Slayers arrived unexpectedly, carrying with them the body of a dead Slayer. She expressed to Angel that she was aware of his plan to bring Giles back to life, and ordered him to resurrect the young woman, Marianne, who had been murdered by his \"child,\" Drusilla. Angel refused, and told Nadira that resurrecting Giles was only possible because his life had been so deeply steeped in magic. Angry and stricken by grief, Nadira attacked Angel, and threatened him. She quickly left with her team when she received a text about a possible solution.[150]\n\nFed up with her problems with her Slayers, Faith lost patience and blamed Angel for her fellows' lack of trust in her. She made it clear that they were done working together after she finished helping him to bring Giles back. Understanding the truth of her statements, Angel complied without complaint. Together, they went to the funeral home where Giles' body had been brought to piece together that had happened to it. The Fairweather sisters informed them that Ethan Rayne had been on the guest book for the funeral, much to Angel and Faith's confusion, because he had been killed by General Voll during the Twilight crisis. Angel quickly surmised that Eyghon had possessed Ethan Rayne during the funeral, and had begun possessing Giles' body since. He also stated that the last fragment of Giles' soul rested within Eyghon.[151]\n\nSoon afterward, Angel and Faith came across Nadira and her fellows fighting against zombified Slayers and Giles' body possessed by Eyghon. Angel and Faith immediately joined the battle. When Faith was hit by Eyghon, Angel fought against him, but was injured in the process. Eyhgon then escaped through a broken window.[152]\n\nAt Alasdair's, Angel and Faith regrouped their forces. Angel admitted that he had known Eyghon was alive since his time as Twilight, and that the demon owned Giles' soul, which made his resurrection possible in theory. Faith then shared the fact that Eyghon had made a deal with Whistler, Pearl and Nash to create a perfect zombified world without magic. Consequently, this plan tied heavily into the new world revolutionized by Whistler. Angel then decided that he would be the one to attack Eyghon, as he believed that he would be immune to the demon's ability of possession.[152] Spike, who Angel had called earlier for assistance,[153] also appeared at Alasdair's residence.[152]\n\nDuring their reunion, Angel and Spike bickered — as usual — about both each other and Buffy, much to Faith's exasperation. Still, their vehemence was not as strong as it once had been, and they managed to focus on coming up with a strategy. They were interrupted by Eyghon, who had tracked them down at Alasdair's place. Spike and Angel worked together very effectively to defeat Eyghon, and almost succeeded in capturing him, but were hindered when Eyghon possessed Spike's body despite the fact that he already housed a demon. Ehygon attempted to overtake Angel as well, but was met with resistance by the three beings already inhabiting Angel's body. In the midst of battle, Angel became erratic; Angel, Angelus, and Giles in turn took over his body. When Giles briefly took control, he managed to decapitate Eyghon, which instantly killed him and ended his control over the dead — the final piece of Giles' soul was absorbed into the Tooth of Ammut.[154]\n\nIn the wake of the fight, Angel continued to shift between the three presences, much to Spike and Faith's concern. Because Angel was the only individual with detailed knowledge about Giles' resurrection, they were forced into an unlikely partnership to come up with a new plan to restore Angel's sanity.[154] As Angel suffered from his bout of insanity, he muttered about the death of Jenny Calendar from Giles' perspective. Observing this, Faith and Spike decided it was best to chain him to the wall in her basement. Together, they went to retrieve the Essuary, a magical item within which Giles' soul could be stored, from a den of soul-consuming demons called Enders.[155]\n\nWhen they returned, Spike was ordered to watch over Angel in the basement while Faith and the others performed the ritual. Spike ranted to a still deranged Angel about his own insecurities in regards to his relationship with Buffy. Angel regained consciousness at some point, but did not make it apparent until Spike admitted that he had always admired Angel for his ability to move on from Buffy. He spoke up, much to Spike's surprise, and sadly confessed that he hadn't moved on from her either. In gratitude for helping him, Angel gave Spike Harmony's phone number. The following morning, he and Faith caught Spike exiting the bathroom shower with Harmony. He jokingly expressed that if he had set anyone up but Harmony, he would have felt sleazy, and then left to get breakfast with Faith.[155]\n\nAngel prepared to set up Giles' resurrection with a special incantation he found, intending to use Alasdair's artifacts as well. While getting into another argument with Spike, it was interrupted when Faith received an unexpected call from Buffy back in San Francisco. Angel questioned her if Buffy was able to come and help them. Faith denied this, explaining that she was too busy helping \"some sick girl named Dawn.\" Spike was shocked at her phrasing and tried to remind her she knew Dawn. Angel was puzzled at his outburst along with Faith, expressing a lack of awareness of Buffy even having a sister. Both of them had lost their memories of her since she was losing her magical essence due to the loss of magic, so Angel and Faith would be the first to forget her since they interacted little with her.[22]\n\nAs a frustrated Spike left the two (being the only one who actually remembered Buffy's connection to Dawn), Angel forced his attention to return to bringing Giles back. As planned, he went to Alasdair to borrow his magical items only to have the archmage refuse him. Tense and becoming increasingly more impatient, he threatened him and then accused Alasdair of working for Whistler, acutely noticing how it was strange that his items have not been raided yet. After turning out wrong in his judgment and the archmage's criticism of Angel's selfish motivations, he somehow won him over and was able to use the magical artifacts. After a deep-to-heart with Faith, the plan was set in motion and the spell was chanted. However, complications arose due to appearances of Whistler, Pearl, and Nash, intending to steal Alasdair's collection. Wanting to buy time, Angel and Faith fought against their enemies fiercely. Eventually, the trio retreated when they got what they wanted. Sophronia, Lavina, and Alasdair successfully finished the incantation and Giles' body was struck with magical energy.[22]\n\nAs the others were ordered to focus on their memories of Giles to make sure they pulled it off, Angel expressed his desperate need to fix what he did as he thought about when he had killed him. Successfully, Giles was brought back alive, albeit trapped in the body of his twelve-year old self. Despite this setback and Giles' initial displeasure of being brought back by him under these circumstances, he was undeterred and insisted they would find a way to fix this as well. Angel was flippant of these consequences, too relieved and happy that he had brought Giles back in one piece (more or less) to measure it with the appropriate degree of seriousness recommended. As Giles used his knowledge and experience to pinpoint the location of Whistler, Pearl, and Nash, they set out to oppose them after coming to a consensus that not all of them would make it out alive in the battle.[156]\n\nAs Whistler began to distill magic into a ball, Angel immediately tried to stop him, only to be distracted when Nash fought against him instead. Eventually, Nadira arrived and while she was still in no way forgiving of Angel, she seemed to acknowledge that he was not the \"true\" bad guy, instead launching herself at Nash for her revenge. Angel again attempted to reason to Whistler over the wrongness of killing so many innocent people, not feeling any desire to kill him. Once again, he did not listen and remained fixed in his belief that he was \"saving\" the world. Angel fought against Whistler, only for him to transform into a blue-horned demon with very strong melting abilities. Nash had gained control of the plague ball, and prepared to drop it on the people below. Lavinia threw Angel another a sword, and he attempted to stop Nash, only for him to easily deflect it.[157]\n\nAfter Giles threw a magic fire ball, Nash dropped the plague ball. Angel and everyone else immediately tried to catch it, but ultimately could not stop it in time. The people below began to mutate into monsters, Angel and the others looking on in helpless horror.[157]\n\nAfter ordering Faith to retrieve the pure magic orb, Angel resumed his face-off against Whistler. He once again tried to talk him out of his obsession with releasing the plague across the world, the two conflicting heavily with their differing ideologies. Angel roughly grabbed Whistler's horns and forced his attention to the people transforming into monsters below them, giving a moving speech about how the \"necessary losses\" were people with lives and that it cost too much to sacrifice so many. While he appeared to somewhat doubt himself, Whistler did not change his mind and insisted it was the only way and that he had gone too far to stop. Shoving him away, he managed to escape Angel and prepared to launch the magic plague across the world. Angel acted quickly and grabbed his wrist. Giving up trying to reason with Whistler, Angel challenged his benefactor to a duel, declaring that, since Whistler had always said that it was always the \"big moments\" that defined a person, then it was time to find out.[158]\n\nThe two traded blows, each trying to seize control of the magic orb. Angel managed to get it and punctured it on one of Whistler's horns, trying to release the pressure to stop the explosion. Whistler somehow saved himself, but the act weakened him and reverted him back to his human form. Angel reiterated the damage he was causing and implored him to stop it. This time, Whistler was convinced and told him he wanted to help despite the cost. Whistler absorbed the magic into his own body so no one would get hurt, but the price was his death. Angel was sad by his passing and took a brief moment to grieve for him before rounding up his group to tend to the changed humans. He helped out with the people, but rejected Alasdair's implication of him becoming the next balance demon.[23]\n\nAfter Faith's choice to go on her own away from London, Giles informed Angel that he was also leaving for San Francisco to return to Buffy, something he had been expecting. The two share a friendly moment together, Angel telling him that he wanted to stay in London and help the mutated people who needed guiding.[23]\n\nMagic Town[]\n\nWith Giles and Faith having departed London, Angel initially did what he could to maintain control of the rising magical disturbances and help the local police detective Brandt. However, after meeting with Nadira — whose magical mutation had stabilized and who appeared to possess some insight into the workings of \"Magic Town\" — Angel began to work with her, her insights directing him to locations where he could do specific good,[159] such as preventing Pearl acquiring bottled magic.[160] While investigating recent murders with Sophia and Lavinia's aid, Angel witnessed a newly-turned vampire walking in sunlight and displaying a greater resistance to the usual anti-vampire weapons, confirming that the restoration of magic had changed the rules for new vampires.[161] When Amy Madison approached him for help to resurrect Warren, Angel initially contemplated accepting the request due to his role in Warren's death, but, after Amy revealed that her true plan was to lure Willow to London so that she could get revenge,[162] Angel instead confronted her with Nadira, whose innate sympathy with the magic of Magic Town allowed her to turn Amy's traps back on herself and turn Amy into a rat.[163]\n\nWhile walking along a street after this battle, Angel was shocked to encounter what appeared to be Fred.[163] With Nadira's help, Angel speculatively established that the new rules of magic had caused some old spells to \"reset,\" resulting in Illyria's resurrection being \"undone\" and allowing Fred to exist once again, although she retains memories of her time in Illyria. He was subsequently reunited with Faith when she returns to Magic Town as part of her new job with Zane Pharmaceuticals,[164] but the company's attempt to assist him in assessing Fred's condition results in Illyria taking control once again.[165] Angel and Faith were able to contain Illyria long enough for Fred to regain control, and Angel reflected that, despite the complications of Illyria's return, he was grateful that Fred had been restored.[166] To celebrate her return, Angel took Fred on a trip to Ireland when she expressed a wish to see more of the world, the two visiting Galway to see where Angel grew up. There, they became caught up in a plan by various witches to gain power through the fear generated by tours of Angelus's first murder spree and the blood of a Gachnar demon.[167]\n\nWhen the Scooby Gang found themselves facing the demon Archaeus — the demon lord who inhabited the Master's bloodline — they called Angel for help, during which he learned that Buffy and Spike had started dating again.[168] Although Angel assisted in defeating Archaeus and accepted Buffy and Spike's relationship, he noted to Willow as he left that he doubted that the relationship would last, recognizing over the years that Spike sought relationships that he believed would save him from himself, only to push his partners away and convince himself that his problems were simply unfixable.[169]\n\nHaving returned to Magic Town, Angel explained the situation to Faith and Fred after Archaeus managed to abduct Nadira. While searching for her, Archaeus and Drusilla confronted him and temporarily reverted him back to Angelus,[170] before he managed to collect himself.[171] Archaeus later attempted to call down the spirit of Magic Town itself to ally with him, attempting to present himself as open to debate where Angel just wanted to attack him.[172] Although, when the spirit witnessed Angel's allies running to join him despite the danger, where Archaeus' forces only obeyed him out of fear, it allied with Angel to trap Archaeus in the golem body Archaeus had intended to offer the spirit, sealing the demon away.[173]\n\nPersonality and traits[]\n\n“The greater scheme, the big picture. Nothing we do matters. There's no grand plan, no big win. If there's no great, glorious end to this, nothing we do matters. All that matters is what we do. 'Cause that's all there is. What we do. Today. I've fought for so long. For redemption, for a reward, finally just to beat the other guy but I never got it. [...] All I want to do is help. I wanna help because I don't think people should suffer as they do. Because if there's no bigger meaning, then the smallest act of kindness is the greatest thing in the world.”\n\n―Angel[src]\n\nAngel tended to be reserved and was often seen as more wounded up and uptight in contrast to others, sometimes even rivaling Wesley and Giles. His most prominent and mocked trait was his tendency to be overly gloomy and brooding. Before moving to Los Angeles, he was inclined to spend much of his time alone, and was never open with friends or allies, with the exception of Buffy to an extent, though he still kept quiet about his past from her, as he felt it would disgust her. The sins he committed when soulless were constantly at the back of his mind, to a degree where he felt for a very long time that he did not deserve happiness or redemption.[citation needed] He denied Whistler's wishes for him to help Buffy at first,[12] and, years later, when he was offered a chance to live without his vampiric weaknesses with the Gem of Amara, he chose to destroy it instead, justifying that he needed to continue living with his punishment.[174] He also refused Drusilla's offer to remove his pain with her Lorophage demon because he felt that his guilt drove him to do good and kept Angelus at bay.[143] While Angel's belief in his mission for redemption fluctuated frequently over being worth it, he still continued to help others as a champion.[citation needed]\n\nAngel was quite self-detrimental and was prone to long spells of doubt, depression and regret. He still felt that he was far from deserving of contentment, but worked tirelessly to prove himself to his peers and the Powers That Be. Still, for a long time he believed himself a lost cause. When he fed off the body of a shop keeper in a moment of weakness in the 1970s, he resigned himself to a life of homelessness, and was not stirred out of it until Whistler showed him Buffy Summers approximately twenty years later. Though this state of mind changed somewhat when he fell in love with Buffy, it wasn't until he learned about the Shanshu Prophecy that he truly began believing in himself and his actions. Angel was also established as detached from reality, and didn't find many things in his life he could look forward to. Unlike humans, who grow and learn as they age, Angel was frozen in time.[68] He had an obsession with his destiny; he would follow almost any metaphorical road as long as he believed it would help people (specifically Buffy or himself) to achieve what they were destined for. Because of this, he could easily make dangerous decisions. This was made most obvious when he allowed himself to be manipulated by Twilight for what he believed was the greater good. Under Twilight's influence, he was indirectly responsible for the death of two hundred slayers — defending it on the grounds that more would have died if he had done nothing —, created a dimension with Buffy that threatened to destroy Earth itself, and later murdered Giles under Twilight's influence.[citation needed]\n\nAngel was a quiet, private individual. He tended to keep up a stoic and brave face, similar to Oz in that regard. This personality trait partly contributed to his established dislike of parties, preferring to either not be at one or remain on the sidelines if he had to.[4][175] Despite this, he nonetheless displayed a tendency to throw taunts and insults to his enemies or just those he intensely disliked. Angel also possessed a sense of humor despite his serious personality, usually in the form of dark sarcasm. He was also very self-conscious, and worried what other people thought of him very often. He believed he had little talent with words, and disliked public speaking. During his first year in Los Angeles with Angel Investigations, he displayed an acute lack of people skills, and was very anti-social and reclusive. He worried constantly what people would think of him, and was reluctant to drink blood around his friends. Simply put, Angel had difficulty trusting others, and it took him a long time to feel comfortable around his companions. Eventually, Angel became more comfortable with himself and social interaction the more he connected with people in Los Angeles, noting after a few months that he had come to think of his new colleagues as his family. He could also be unintentionally blunt in his reasonings and manner of speech, though this eventually became less frequent over the years. Angel's speech patterns were also established as cryptic and sometimes abbreviated, much to Buffy and others' frequent irritation. He had a tendency to bottle up his emotions, feelings and problems behind stoicism, causing him to appear difficult to read and secretive. According to his friends and despite his constant objection, he rarely smiled and only openly cried on one occasion.[citation needed]\n\nAngel was also somewhat of a natural nurturing figure, easily sympathizing with the hardships of others and taking it upon himself to be the one to guide them through it. His chivalry and sensitivity frequently made him prone to seeing others as his complete responsibility, specifically \"damsels in distress.\"[176] Angel's protective instincts towards others were intensified towards those he loved, even to an extreme point. This was made most obvious through his interactions with Connor, Cordelia, and Buffy.[citation needed] Because of his borderline martyr complex, Angel repeatedly sacrificed his own happiness for the sake of the world or individual people who mean a lot to him, such as giving up his humanity to in an attempt to save Buffy from her prophesied death[63] and destroying the Gem of Amara.[174] However, while Angel enjoyed \"helping the hopeless,\" he was also especially motivated by the prospect of redemption in the form of Shanshu. The thought that he might someday be forgiven for his past and allowed to live on deeply affected him, causing him to latch on to it immediately. Over the years, Angel became increasingly disillusioned with the Shanshu Prophecy, eventually coming to believe that the prophecy was wholly unreliable, causing him to focus on doing good for the sake of it rather than for a reward.[citation needed] After having been possessed by Twilight he came to believe that redemption would be impossible because of all the damage he had caused with a soul and without.[138]\n\nFor most of his ensouled depression, Angel's opinion of people was mostly uncaring and negative despite his newfound guilt for his sins.[45] However, after meeting Buffy and seeing the well of inner strength she possessed, his outlook on humanity slowly changed. He naturally associated them with \"always trying,\" no matter the cost, and more than once made reference to their right to choose over others' attempts to impose their own will on them. Angel admitted on two separate occasions he admired that about people, citing it as one of aspects that drove him to atone,[176][57] a sharp contrast from his soulless counterpart, who did not have faith in the \"human condition\" and believed their only purpose was to suffer and die.[41] However, unlike Buffy, who adamantly refused to kill humans no matter how evil they were,[177] Angel had no such reservations and would kill a human easily if they murdered or threatened innocents; for example, he unhesitatingly killed the human assassin Vanessa Brewer, whom Wolfram & Hart repeatedly prevented from being brought to justice for her crimes, when she was hired by them to kill the Holy Triumvirate.[24]\n\nAngel admitted to hating the stereotype that vampires sleep in coffins during the day; when asked why he wasn't sleeping in a coffin, Angel explained that the idea of sleeping in coffins originated from \"ignorant media\" and that vampires were perfectly capable of operating during the day as long as they avoid exposure to direct sunlight.[64] Furthermore, he also had a dislike of churches, though this was due to the fact that he often preyed on nuns while soulless and they brought up bad memories rather than atheism or blasphemy.[citation needed]\n\nAngel's viewpoints on battling evil was often seen as mostly realistic and cynical. It never made much of a true difference in the end, good would never truly triumph over evil because it would always come back. However, Angel would also state that it was important to keep trying because things were important enough to fight for.[13] However, he would eventually convince himself that he could make a difference, redeem himself, and receive some sort of reward for it. This thought process eventually triggered Angel into a massive depression after being severely thwarted by several obstacles (Wolfram & Hart, Darla's resurrection), changing his outlook and attitude. For a few months, he became more hardened and emotionless to the point he had fired his entire crew from Angel Investigations. Angel would even indirectly kill several human lawyers of Wolfram & Hart by locking them in a room at the mercy of Drusilla and Darla in his obsession to take them down.[71] After a misguided one-night stand with Darla in a moment of weakness,[73] he snapped out of his depression and returned to himself for the most part. Angel would return to his \"never winning\" belief, but a more elaborated version: \"If nothing we do matters, than all that matters is what we do.\"[74] Following Whistler's self-sacrifice to save the world and the advice he parted with him, Angel gained a certain degree of peace with himself. He stated to Giles that \"helping the helpless\" was a redundant saying since everyone, including yourself, was at one point helpless and they would eventually need someone as well.[23]\n\nDespite his constant stoicism, Angel was more than capable of forming close bonds with others, particularly his Angel Investigations associates. He could be roused to anger when they were harmed or threatened in any way, and openly threatened to kill Lilah Morgan when she tortured Cordelia to force him to work for her,[178] and nearly smothered Wesley to death when his actions resulted in Connor being trapped in Quor'toth.[85] He was devoted to those he cared about, willing to do almost anything for their safety and well-being. Strong examples of this include him wiping an insane Connor's memory so he would live peacefully with new parents[100] and taking away his chance of being together with Buffy as a human under the believed notion that he was saving her from death.[179] Still, he would on occasion put them below the \"bigger picture,\" particularly the fate of the world. He came very close to ending Cordelia's life to prevent Jasmine from being born,[98] fought ferociously against an insane Connor,[100] lied to his friends and killed his longtime friend and ally Drogyn to trick the Circle of the Black Thorn into believing that he had been corrupted,[109] and tortured Buffy under the guise of Twilight for an entire year so she could be empowered.[17]\n\nAngel also had an obsessive streak in him, most prominently seen when Darla was resurrected by Wolfram & Hart[70] and later with his desire to bring Giles back from the dead.[138] Angel had been seen many times to be obsessively single-minded in his plans or goals, to the point that he occasionally disregarded his moral code and crossed a line; he could be impulsive, often running blindly down any path he believed would help redeem himself and not bothering to think about the consequences of his actions until it was too late,[citation needed] something that Willow criticized him over.[145] Because of this thought process, he often ended up causing more trouble than he prevented. Angel also believed for years that the ends justified the means up to a certain extent and had been seen doing morally wrong acts for the \"greater good,\" examples being instructing Lorne to kill Lindsey,[180] and his actions in his period as the masked Twilight.[17] However, Angel would say afterwards that Buffy had made him realize that condemning innocent people to die for the \"greater good\" to such an extreme was wrong and far too costly, and he told Whistler that he would not help him \"save the world\" if it meant killing innocents and causing any more collateral damage.[136][158][149]\n\nAngel described evil as an art and created \"masterpieces\" out of people through intense physical and emotional torture, as example of Drusilla.[citation needed] In a conversation with Spike about the natures of good and evil, Angel said: \"I couldn't take my eyes off [my victims]. I was only in it for the evil. That was everything to me. It was art... The destruction of a human being.\"[104]\n\nAngel was also an excellent sketch artist[citation needed] and possessed a photographic memory that he used to his advantage.[181][182] Angel's appreciation of arts and theater manifested into an enjoyment of ballet even when he was evil.[183] He would also once admit an interest in mysteries and detective work.[184]\n\nAngel often adopted a controlling persona around people, especially those he was closest too. Xander once took notice of this, and mockingly called him \"Bossy the Cow.\"[33] However, this also made him a natural leader towards others. He was always one of the first to come up with ideas and usually made quick, effective decisions.[citation needed]\n\nDespite his limited knowledge over most pop culture and educational attributes, Angel was usually fairly intelligent in other aspects.[citation needed] Another notable trait of Angel's was his tendency to make life-changing decisions for other people without their consent or knowledge, always believing he was only doing the right thing for others. With his loved ones, Angel was especially driven by a desire to make things better for them, even if the latter disagreed with what he wanted them to have.[citation needed]\n\nDespite his stubbornness, Angel could be impressionable and easily swayed by the thought of destiny. Such cases include his quick acceptance of the taking up the mantle of Twilight because of Whistler and his misguided period in Wolfram & Hart. Angel, while not exactly quick to anger, could become irritated at times. People who have annoyed him most include Spike, Xander, and Harmony.[citation needed]\n\nDespite being over two-centuries old, Angel was not the most mature individual. Buffy even compared his maturity to that of a twelve-year-old during one of their reunions.[101] He could be childish, petty and utterly proud. For example, he was annoyed and pretended to be unimpressed when he heard Lindsey singing at Caritas,[185] and showed intense displeasure at Spike for regaining his soul, as it caused him to feel less unique.[8] He also expressed a childish distaste of riding on the back of a motorcycle with other men on two occasions: first, with Wesley, who tried to make him wear a pink helmet,[186] and later, with Spike.[39] Spike also called Angel a \"drama queen\"[187] and Cordelia once noted that he was melodramatic.[188] He's particularly sensitive to criticism, usually trivial, such as ones about his looks or nit-picky comments about himself. Angel could also be braggy and sometimes pretentious, shown when he recounted stories of his battles to the people of Pylea (who had hailed him a hero) and was even smugly flattered by their continuous admiration of him, admitting to Lorne that it was nice to be not have to deal the moral ambiguity judgments he often got at home.[189]\n\nAngel was prone to unattractive and very obvious bouts of jealousy and possessiveness. Angel himself was very aware of this (though he rarely admitted it), but made little effort to hide it. The most frequent cases of him showing this side of himself stem from Buffy's other romantic relationships, most notably Riley[66][67] and Spike to a greater extent.[102][36][39]\n\nAngel was also a fan of pop culture to some degree, enjoying Barry Manilow's music[190] and being a fan of ice hockey;[191] indeed, part of the reason he originally founded Angel Investigations was because of his liking of old detective novels.[192]\n\nDuring his darker phases, Angel also smoked, such as his reversion to soulless state in 1998,[50] his ensouled depression pre-Buffy,[45] and his dark phase in Los Angeles in late 2000.[72]\n\nAngel vs. Angelus[]\n\n“Look, I'm weak. I've never been anything else. It's not the demon in me that needs killing, Buffy. It's the man.”\n\n―Angel[src]\n\nIn his past, Angel had been known as the man \"Liam\" and the vampire \"Angelus.\" With the exception of while amnesiac, Angel would not take back his birth name of Liam.[88] After he adopted the name \"Angel\" circa 1943, the name \"Angelus\" would be brought up in reference to the time when he was still called as such,[93][193][94] or to compare his present with his evil history.[50][85][109] Even so, he was also never called \"Angelus\" again, except by those who didn't know about his name change[35][26][43] or had known him from before,[71][194] who were often corrected.[14][194][83][43][109]\n\nIn 2003, when all reference to the Beast was erased from Earth, Angel was also affected, but his soulless past was not, for this identity technically did not exist anymore when the spell was cast. After he had his soul removed for a second time, Angel was exceptionally referred again by the Angel Investigations team as the historical \"Angelus,\" as he had memories of what didn't exist in the world anymore,[94][195] and \"Angel [was] gone.\"[95] In contrast, the time he had lost his soul in 1997, he kept his most recent name and reaffirmed his identity as \"Angel.\"[50]\n\nThe distinction between his states with and without a soul was sometimes referred as separate entities. For example, when taunted by the First Evil for his past crimes, Angel cried out: \"It wasn't me!\"[13] However, while he was soulless, Buffy's claimed that he was \"not Angel,\" so he responded: \"Wrong. I am Angel. At last.\"[50] In addition, in the two times he defeated Eyghon, Angel counted with the aid of his inner demon as a separate entity in the fight;[196] this evil persona was referred to as \"Angelus\" in the second time,[154] when Spike explained: \"Not sure you can call Angelus a 'being,' really. More of a demon, who's always there.\"[155]\n\nAngel also felt as if these two separate personas struggled within his mind for control.[41] Drusilla noted that \"Angelus\" was always whispering to \"Angel\" in the back of his mind to encourage him to submit to his vampiric instincts, although he rejected this idea and claimed that he was used to ignoring what people have to say to him.[32] Jasmine also described \"Angelus\" as forced to live inside Angel's head, being a powerless voice buried under his conscience.[96] Interestingly, Angel once reverted to his soulless personality without his curse being broken, due to having been secretly fed a happy pill that, while under its effects, made him experience perfect happiness.[197]\n\nIn reference to his actions without a soul, Angel once told Lindsey: \"I'm the greatest mass murderer you've ever met.\"[111] The Master once commented that Angel was \"the most vicious creature [he had] ever met.\"[2] By contrast, with a soul he was dedicated to help people and do what was right, explaining: \"All I want to do is help. I want to help because I don't think people should suffer as they do, because if there's no bigger meaning, then the smallest act of kindness is the greatest thing in the world.\"[74] Despite his efforts, Angel did not always believe it was possible for him to gain redemption for his evil actions, once telling Spike that he believed his escape from Acathla's dimension was not an escape, but only a \"short reprieve,\" and that he still believed he would go to hell when he die.[190]\n\nWhenever his curse took effect, it took a few moments for Angel to remember his actions,[12][53] but he soon became horrified at the memories.[40] The first time he was cursed, Angel spent some time trying to act like he used to, well enough to deceive Drusilla and Spike that he was still the same vampire during their brief encounter. However, Angel eventually accepted his new status as a vampire with a soul; initially only killing murderers and rapists, until Darla put him in a position where he would have to kill a baby to prove himself, when he instead took the child away from Darla.[14] By the 1950s, Angel reached a point where he was compared to \"Angelus without the sadism,\" possessing a cynical view of the world and generally uninterested in social"
