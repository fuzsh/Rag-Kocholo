        "text": "What immediately struck me about The Evil Divide is that it was a more clear return to the direction Death Angel was headed on their Frolic Through the Park and Act III records, back during their prime when they were becoming a household name among the thrash fans at the turn of the decade (1990). It's certainly a more advanced and involved record in terms of composition, and it also has a stronger sense of dynamic range than the album before it (The Dream Calls for Blood). The production isn't nearly so harsh and concrete, it feels 'modern' but not overly so, which I think turned a lot of cult thrash fans off that one a little. Stylistically, it's a bit of the same and then takes a few risks, not to an experimental level of weirdness like Frolic Through the Park, more in just how clinical and technical they can pack their riffing style.\n\nThe fact is that this lineup really gels here, and the rhythm guitars are fucking intense and like the album before it, just flooring you with the sheer number of riff patterns that are strewn about the 45 minutes. Probably a higher count than any other Death Angel disc, or most thrash records for that matter. The bass tone is nice and fat and given some air to breathe in a few tunes. The leads are quite good and superior to the previous album, and unlike a lot of peers that are spewing out modern thrash records after 30+ year careers, The Evil Divide seems capable of putting in some genuine emotion without getting too cheesy, as on the riffy, memorable \"Lost\" where Mark lets his cleaner, more sustained vocals and harmonies reign. On a lot of the material, he actually gets a little more grit to his voice than on The Dream Calls for Blood, although that album might have felt heavier in sum because of its more abrasive, crunchy guitar tone. I find the instrumentation just in general seems as if its more practiced and effortless, but also more inventive and melodically imbued to stick to the listener's brains long after the death's head moth has fluttered away. Speaking of that, it was a little strange that they dropped the horn-crowned wolves which they had been using on the two albums prior and then also on the follow-up to this.\n\nDeath Angel got a lot of good buzz off this one, and for an understandable reason. Re-evaluating my own feelings on it, and getting back into it, I feel like it's even better than its predecessor, although there was a time when I might have told you differently. Mature, intelligently written, about as far from the run of the mill pizza thrash that these guys and their Californian peers inspired throughout the early '00s as you can get. The Evil Divide is still a catchier album when I'm listening to it than when I'm not, but that said I do keep a couple of its hooks stored in the grey matter when I'm thinking about the band on the whole. Had this album come out in about 1992, even with a slightly less professional production, I think it would have been the stuff of legend and blown peoples' heads off, it certainly eviscerates The Art of Dying and Killing Season, to me the nadir of their career, those early 'comeback' albums that didn't wholly justify the return. At any rate, folks looking for detailed, dynamic thrash metal which isn't afraid to stretch its wings out will very likely appreciate this one.\n\n-autothrall\n\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n\nIn your face thrash metal galore!! These native Californian's put together one helluv a good release here. Be it the music, the production quality, the mixing, vocals, the whole deal Death Angel marks into their discography. Every song on here averages 4-5 minutes in length. Definitely worth checking this album out. You can always go on Spotify to check this out if you have an account. Pure thrash metal to the core. I think this is one of their top releases to date. If you have a contention regarding that, just listen to the whole album and you'll see what I'm talking about. I don't think there will be any arguments on how good this release is.\n\nThe guitars because of the production quality are a little bit muffled, but not enough to count this as one of their best releases. The energy is way high on here. You can feel the vibe of the album it's totally upbeat thrash and vocal destruction. I like every song on here. Things seem to fall into place. The rhythms, the leads, the vocals and the music overall is superb. I cannot get enough of this release. I can play it over and over and not get sick of it. It's one of those albums you can play and hear different things each time you play it. Kind of like Metallica's albums of the 80's. This one chalks up within the realm of 'Act III'.\n\nRiff-tastic album, if you're a guitar player then you can hear what I'm talking about. The vocals compliment the music. Not too harsh, just enough to emit cosmic energy to this. The background music is good as well. Every song on here with worth mentioning. So if you're a fan of thrash metal and you don't have this, get it! All I can say is just that they conquered in every aspect on here. Totally worth getting. I'm not sure of the new release it's coming out on May 31st. So we'll have to make a comparison as to which one has the best energy and music! For now, we have to focus on past releases.\n\nIn summation, Death Angel chalks up one heck of a good release here. All the songs are good and everything flows smoothly. I was taken aback when I hear this album. Totally rips in every sense of the word. The one thing that I'd take out though are the chronic leads. That's the only beef I have for the album. Otherwise, simply a masterpiece. They would score higher if it weren't for those annoying leads. So if you don't have Spotify, I'm sure they have this on YouTube. Probably better of choosing YouTube because not everyone has Spotify. So yeah, shout your opinion on this. I'm sure it'll be positive. Get this album ASAP!!\n\nThis, put simply, is what modern thrash metal should look like. Clear production, sharp guitars, good double-bass-heavy drums, and an awesome vocalist. Death Angel have done a good job here.\n\nThis album opens with a bang, namely \"The Moth\". This song has it all, a quality riff. great drumming, and an awesome vocal performance. It was good enough that I must have listened to it at least 10 times before I got around to the rest of the album. I figured the rest of it wouldn't measure up, and I was pleasantly surprised to find that it did, going into \"Cause For Alarm\", a fast, catchy, and heavy song that also turned out to be one of my favorites on the album. I commonly find that the second track of an album is a good indicator of how the rest of the album is. The first song is generally going to be one of the better ones on the album, and the second song cam be the first indication of the album's more average material. This material was definitely above average.\n\nThe rest of the tracks strike a nice balance between slow and fast, heavy and slightly less heavy, Stuff like \"Lost\" and \"It Can't Be This\" are slower, more melodic numbers, but with songs like \"Cause For Alarm\", they ratchet up the speed. The consistency of the album is also impressive. Most of the tracks stick in your head, especially the choruses. As I listened through the album, I couldn't help but wonder if the next track would live up to the current one, and I was rarely disappointed. Some tracks, like the comparatively formulaic \"Hatred United/United Hate\" weren't quite as amazing as stuff like The Moth, but even that was by no means bad.\n\nInstrumentally, this is fairly impressive. The guitar work is very good and is compelling for pretty much the whole album. Drums aren't the most creative, but they're very well-played, with lots of tight double bass work and generally well-executed fills. Singing-wise is just great. Mark Osegueda still sounds great, and puts on a really nice performance with lots of high notes.\n\nThis album does have some issues with the sameness of the faster tracks. The heavier stuff on here sort of blends together after being listened to in order. If they hadn't sounded so good, this would have been a much bigger problem.\n\nOverall, this was, as repeatedly mentioned, good stuff. It's not perfect, but all the tracks on it are competent at worst, and mind-blowing at best. I'd particularly single out \"The Moth\", \"Cause For Alarm\", \"Breakaway\", and \"The Electric Cell\" for praise, but it's all pretty well-done, These guys sound like they haven't aged since the 1980's, and with luck that'll continue for years to come.\n\nThree decades into their celebrated career, Bay Area thrash legends Death Angel remain as hungry as ever with an uncompromising urgency and unpredictability which has defined the group almost from the start of their illustrious career. With the reunion-era line-up continuing to sound as tight as possible and a maturity found in their years together, the quintet’s eighth full-length album was released May 27, 2016 on Nuclear Blast Records.\n\nWith the band firing on all cylinders in regards to their revival phase, there’s a deep, flowing hard-edged old-school attack prevalent on this one that takes their signature sound to great heights. Featuring their signature swirling speed metal patterns in ferocious tempos laying down plenty of hard-charging and dexterous rhythms that showcase plenty of fiery lead riff-work, tight patterns and furious rhythms that carry their frantic energy and relentless surging riff-work that make for a wholly impressive series of up-tempo work. Alongside these thrashers are efforts which drop that intensity for a more majestic, mid-tempo sprawling series of rhythms that go for a more atmospheric, melodic mood with a plodding energy and more pronounced melodic vocals than their more furious work, offering a strong and wholly dynamic variety that’s immensely appealing here. That charging, dynamic atmosphere here creates a truly ripping old-school feel as well with its multi-faceted tracks that range from the melodic epic intro that turns into the ripping thrasher to the melodic and straightforward mid-tempo breather which carries a strong old-school feel throughout here. This is certainly a case where the band is comfortable with this approach as there’s plenty of familiar moments within this one that brings to mind their past works with this approach, but for the most part it’s more of the same enjoyable elements that have always been part of their attack which makes this such a fun album.\n\nDespite a big reliance on continuing to offer up more of the same here that doesn’t really bring along much variety or innovation, it’s a rather moot point on the album as there’s just such a vibrant, energetic old-school feel to this one throughout here that it’s one of the top albums of the year in the genre and is of extreme interest to old-school thrashers or thrash fanatics in general.\n\nDeath Angel has always been one of those ever-changing bands that, to my ears, never quite manages to put out many great records in a row. The original three albums they did back in their early days were all different in sounds from each other, and it was only the debut that pretty much interested me from that batch. We have somewhat of the same scenario with their reunion albums, 2004's The Art Of Dying and 2008's Killing Season, both of which did not impress me at all. After that point, however, the band did some reorganization within the camp. What used to be an all-family story now became pretty much an ordinary band, with singer Mark Osegueda and guitarist Rob Cavestany being the only cousins left. A new line-up of Death Angel was born - something I think was most refreshing and fulfilling for the band and their sound.\n\nNow fast forward six years later and three albums in with the new line-up, and Death Angel has done something it never did before - releasing three truly killer albums in a row. As usual with their ever-changing style which I mentioned before, it hasn't come without minor changes, though. Where we saw the band adapting a somewhat \"modern metal meets classic thrash\"-sound on 2010's Relentless Retribution, only to go full-throttle on the thrash assault with 2013's The Dream Calls For Blood, we now see them turning towards a more hardcore influenced sound. Now, just to clarify for those thrash-purists out there, it does not mean that DA has turned into a metalcore band. There are certainly flavors of 2000's era bands like Chimaira and God Forbid in there, but I'd rather say it's groove-oriented influences. Think more early Machine Head rather than Whitechapel.\n\nKicking off the album is a track called \"The Moth\", obviously referring to the album's cover art. I'm gonna be straight forward and say that this song is without a doubt the most metalcore-esque track on the album, so it might get you worried, but don't be - there's a lot of sweet thrash waiting ahead. The track itself is very kick-ass despite not being the album's thrashiest piece by a stretch, and the chorus is very infectious. \"Cause For Alarm\" follows and is, once again, the album's most obvious \"hardcore song\". Expect some NYHC sounds from that one. \"Lost\" is the album's most mellow track with its ultra-melodic sound, which is clearly a playground for Mark Osegueda's excellent and still-in-great-shape vocals. You can really tell the guy loves Dio. The rest of the album provides a steady outlet of mostly thrashers, some with a few extra surprises thrown in as well. There's also an excellent cover of goth rockers The Mission's \"Wasteland\" to be found on the limited edition CD version.\n\nJust like this is the third album in a row with the same line-up, the band also chose to work with producer Jason Suecof once again. Jason has produced all the last three DA albums with the \"new\" line-up and I really think he brings out the best of them. While his production values sometimes might be a bit too clean for the band's aggressive sound, it's still a very suitable sound for the songs and everything is very well-balanced in the mix. What I especially like about Jason's production is how prominent he makes the bass. Considering what a beast Damien Sisson is at playing the thing, it's certainly a good thing. If compared to the previous two albums with Suecof, however, I actually think this one is the where he and the band really solidify their relationship. The production on this one is slightly better in pretty much all areas, with especially the drums coming to mind. This time around the drums have some more punch and groove to them, which I really like. It makes the music sound heavier in my opinion.\n\nThe final verdict...\n\nThis is a very good album and also a very pleasant surprise that DA once again managed to keep up with yet another great album. I don't know what happened to the guys, but they really seem to have found a new-born fire of sorts in latter years. I can only speak for myself, but apart from the band's awesome debut The Ultra-Violence back in 1987, I really think the previous three albums have been way better than anything else the band ever did. They now seem determined with where they're heading musically, and they bring it out with style as well. I almost didn't dare to hope that they would crank out a third album (by the current line-up) this good, but they have really shown that they're a force to be reckoned with these days.\n\nCheck-outs: The Moth, Father Of Lies, Hatred United / United Hatred, Let The Pieces Fall, Breakaway.\n\n2016 has proven itself to be the year of the thrash. Both Anthrax and Megadeth represented the big four with cracking releases; newcomers like Vektor have pushed the genre forward with prog-like additions; and we look forward to new material from newly reformed acts like Demolition Hammer and Evildead. However, another veteran - this time of the bay area - has stepped forward to stomp its stamp on 2016's already impressive arsenal of thrash. The mighty Death Angel return once again with another slice of monstrous speed metal to bang your head to like its 1986.\n\nWhen the first promotional track for \"The Evil Divide\" was released - I avoided listening to it, as I usually do when I pre-order an album. But the positive reactions from the thrash community hyped this track up in my mind, and it just had to deliver... So it fucking did, and then some! \"The Moth\" is one of the greatest opening tracks to any thrash album in my collection. The main riff is so simple yet so effective; the chorus is vicious and exhilarating to shout along with; and the stop/start guitar work after the chorus is absolutely to die for. If this song doesn't end up as a live staple, I'll be severely disappointed.\n\nSince their revival, and subsequent resurgence, in 2004 - these bay area stalwarts have been delivering pound after pound of reliable thrash goodness. Solid assaults like \"Hatred United/United Hate\" and \"Cause For Alarm\" are testament to their refusal to slow down, and their loyalty to the sub-genre. Saying that, they're by no means a one-trick pony. \"Lost\" is a slightly more mellow affair containing an impressive performance from Osegueda and some interesting chord progressions. \"It Can't Be This\" also explores different territory - this time of a more groovy ilk. The riffs are intricate, the lyrics memorable, the solos admirable...not what most thrash die-hards expect when you inform them a song is groove-based.\n\nThe performers are all bringing their A-game to \"The Evil Divide\". Osegueda's voice is probably the harshest it has sounded since the brutal \"Killing Season\" - this man ages like a fine wine. The duel guitar attack of Cavestany and Aguilar is quite ferocious - finely balancing when to let one player take the lead, and when to fuse together into a relentless riff machine. Damien Sisson's bass is remarkably prominent - even taking the lead in some sections! This man almost rivals D.D. Verni in his fight to be at the forefront of the music.\n\nTo ensure the elitists of the genre are happy, Death Angel chose to end the album with 3 absolute anthems, as a crashing finale. If the chorus of \"Breakaway\" doesn't have you ripping your throat out, you're listening wrong. Through all the dips and peaks in \"The Evil Divide\", you can tell the Californians are 100% in control. Death Angel made their mark on this year in confident, stylish fashion. If anyone tells you that thrash is dead in the 21st century...well, the first 30 seconds of \"Father of Lies\"...there ya go. Overkill? You're next - whatcha got?!\n\n\"I am the thorn in your side.\n\nYou are the evil divide.\n\nDrawn to the flame we die - we die together!!\n\nI am the spit in your eye.\n\nYou are the God I defy.\n\nDrawn to the flame we live - we live forever!!\"\n\nDeath Angel's eighth studio release and fifth output since its reformation fifteen years ago proves that American thrash metal is currently experiencing a high-quality revival. ''The Evil Divide'' isn't a far call from the quality of the last outputs of Anthrax, Megadeth and Over Kill. This authentic and refreshing effort would be considered a classic if it had been released three decades earlier and still sounds coherent and dynamic nowadays. The Bay Area quintet sounds as energetic and energizing, hungry and juvenile as they were when they started playing music as teenagers. Each of the ten homogeneous tracks comes around with pissed-off vocals, bumblebee bass guitar sounds, powerful drum patterns, technically well-executed sharp riffs and melodic mid- to up-tempo guitar solos. The only thing to criticize is that some tunes sound quite alike and that this release is lacking diversity and maybe one truly outstanding tune.\n\nOne of the few slightly different tunes on this record is the longing ''Lost'' where Mark Osegueda delivers one of his most diversified vocal performances ever. From soothing melodic parts in the key of classic heavy metal to passionate high-pitched passages that aren't a far call from power metal to his rawer signature style, he sounds spot on throughout the entire track. This tune is probably the softest and catchiest on the album but it still rocks steadily. This track would have been a perfect single choice and is one of the band's most harmonious compositions ever.\n\nOne of my personal highlights on this release is ''Father of Lies'' with its angry dynamics that shift to a more melodic style in the middle part and later on again in the coda where stunningly beautiful acoustic and electric guitar harmonies supported by a distinctive bass sound give a welcome break from the unchained high-speed base of the tune. This track is perfectly balanced and offers some of the greatest song writing in the band's impressive career.\n\nAnother personal favorite is ''The Electric Cell'' that meanders between heavy metal riffs with a slight extreme metal touch and faster thrash metal riffs in a quite epic way. This is probably the most technical, progressive and creative tune on the album. As a cherry on the top of the cake, the middle part introduces short psychedelic sound samples and weird folk chants that lead into one of the best guitar solo sections on the entire album.\n\nThe diversified and entertaining album closer ''Let the Pieces Fall'' that mixes straighter up-tempo parts and melodic mid-tempo passages with its outstanding guitar play and that also convinces with another enthusiastic vocal performance ends a great record on a high note.\n\nIt's interesting that the best tracks on the record are the ones where the band experiments a little bit more and either sounds more melodic or more progressive than usual. Their traditional thrash metal monsters are still vivid but sometimes exchangeable. The band definitely has the technical capacities to pull off a genre-transcending output which isn't the case for many of their colleagues such as Exodus, Megadeth or Slayer that fail when they try out something different. I hope that Death Angel's song writing will become even more courageous in the future.\n\nIf you need an authentic, powerful and refreshing dose of thrash metal without many distracting experiments, Death Angel's ''The Evil Divide'' is a truly excellent choice even though the band has the potential for more than that. The new songs are also promising enough to make the band's passionate live shows even more intense in the future, so make sure to catch this quintet on tour this autumn."
