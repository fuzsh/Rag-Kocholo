        "text": "The Death Angels are a hostile race of aliens who arrived on Earth via a meteorite and have since began killing off nearly all life on the planet.\n\nBiology\n\nThe Death Angels are emaciated, vaguely humanoid creatures whose entire bodies are covered by many plates of chitinous armor. They appear to have arms with prehensile digits but are only ever observed using their limbs for locomotion.\n\nDeath Angels hunt by sound, and are completely blind. They have sensitive plates lining the front of their faces that can extend and contract to help them gauge direction of where sound is coming from. The back of their heads are capable of unfolding into massive eardrum-like organ, further enhancing their hearing to detect even subtle changes in sound, but doing so also leaves the underside of the armor exposed, rendering them vulnerable.\n\nIntelligence\n\nIt is debated if they are sapient, as their only objective seems to be to hunt for prey, and they are never observed communicating with each other. However, these animals are very smart when it comes to the hunting, as they have been seen inside buildings they can't get into without opening a type of door, and they have the mental ability to attach themselves to an object (such as a boat) to get to a certain location. Rarely are they seen actually eating humans. They have also been seen to be able to easily rip through metal, steel, and other hard materials to get to their target.\n\nWeaknesses\n\nBecause of their super hearing abilities, high frequencies can disorient them. They can be used to immobilize them or drive them away. Extremely high frequencies can even cause them physical pain, distress, and render them temporarily unconscious. It also renders them vulnerable as they open their armored plates to expose their flesh, revealing a potential weak spot.\n\nWhile the outside of their body is heavily armored, their insides are soft and fleshy. Timing a shotgun blast with a Death Angel opening its sensory organs or mouth can instantly kill it. However, doing so risks attracting the attention of even more Death Angels. The best survival method is to remain as silent as possible.\n\nSince Death Angels are completely blind, one effective way to evade them is to remain as quiet as possible. Additionally, you can distract them by making a noise that is louder than your own movements. These tactics can help you avoid encountering Death Angels and stay safe in their presence.\n\nDue to the heavy weight of their armor, Death Angels will sink rapidly if they become submerged in water of considerable depth; however, they are adept at maneuvering through shallow waters. As a result of this characteristic, numerous survivors have chosen to establish settlements on islands in order to maintain a sense of normalcy amidst the chaos.\n\nHistory\n\nDeath Angels arrived on Earth on a meteorite that crashed in Mexico. The meteorite on which they held onto was a chunk of their destroyed home planet.\n\nInvasion of 2020\n\nIn the year 2020, a meteor landed in Mexico which contained dormant Death Angels. In the first hours of the invasion, military forces from around the globe began to fight back, but the creatures' armored shells proved too strong for bullets, bombs, and even bio-weapons. Over the span of the next 3 months, the Death Angels had become widespread and had wiped out a considerable portion of the Earth's population. A year later, the last remnants of humanity survive in small groups by making as little noise as possible.\n\nAppearances\n\nA Quiet Place (2018)\n\nA Quiet Place Part II (2021)\n\nA Quiet Place: Day One (2024)\n\nNotes"
