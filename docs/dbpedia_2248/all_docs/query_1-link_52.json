        "text": "Death Angel drummer Will Carroll is said to be ‚Äòvery ill‚Äô and was hospitalized and admitted to ICU this week. Exodus/ex-Slayer guitarist Gary Holt recently commented of Carroll‚Äòs health:\n\n‚ÄúI remained quiet on this earlier, not wanting to say anything until I was certain it had become public knowledge, but Will Carroll, @bleedingpriest , is in need of some massive positive vibes.\n\nMe, I appreciate all the warm wishes I‚Äôve gotten, but I‚Äôm sick, nothing more, Will is in the ICU. WAY worse that anything I‚Äôm dealing with, by a long shot. Not even close. He is very ill.\n\nThere are several of us that have symptoms and are waiting for test results. Will needs some healing vibes from everyone. Here we are recreating the Scorpions pyramid with @bonsloth Get well Willüëäüèª‚ù§Ô∏èüëäüèª‚Äù\n\nOn March 15th Death Angel postponed their worldwide touring after members of the band and crew took ill, they said in a statement at the time:\n\n‚ÄúWe regret to inform that due to recent worldwide health concerns and half of our band / crew being sick, Death Angel will not be performing at Heaven and Hell Fest in Mexico City this weekend. We apologize to our fans and everyone involved with the festival and look forward to rock with you all in the future. Health and safety first. Thank you for understanding.‚Äù"
