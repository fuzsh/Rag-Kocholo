        "text": "Description\n\nThe Founding of Chiang Mai\n\nChiang Mai was purposefully created by King Mangrai in AD.1296 to be the political, economic, social and cultural center of his newly expanded and integrated kingdom of the Tai people, called \"Lanna Kingdom\" (kingdom of a million rice fields). It was designed to be located in the landlocked heartland of Southeast Asia, north of modern-day Thailand.\n\nBy the 13th century, the earlier empires of Southeast Asia such as Dvaravadi, Champa, and Angkor, had declined or disintegrated. The Yuan (Mongol) Dynasty of China had begun to expand southward where some Buddhist states had become prosperous, as well as the various states and townships of the ethnic and linguistic Tai peoples which had established themselves independently or in clusters.\n\nMangrai, whose mother was a Tai Lue princess from Chiang Rung, SipsongPanna (now in Kunming, south China), was the 25th king of the Lawachakaraj(Lao Chok) dynasty. He had, since 1261, succeeded his father as Ruler of Ngeonyang located near Chiangsaen, and had rapidly consolidated his kingdom by unifying, through diplomacy as well as through military leadership, many of the Tai towns and other states in the region.\n\nIn 1292, after a long and cautious planning, he defeated, by ploys rather than force, the Mon kingdom of Haripunchai, a prosperous and ancient political center which included Lamphun and Lampang. Though he ruled from Lumphun only for 2 years, this civilized Mon kingdom, steeped in the Buddhist faith and rich in the Buddhist arts and architectural expressions, with a written code of legal system, seemed to have greatly inspired him in many ways.\n\nMangrai had frequently changed his capital before the founding of Chiang Mai, which literarily means \"the new city\". His previous administrative center had included Ngeonyang, Chiangrai, Fang, Lamphun, Chiang khong, Chiangtung or Kengtung (now in the Shan state, Myanmar), and finally Wiang Khumkham. Whenever he moved on to a new city, he appointed one of his sons and other trusted noblemen to rule the previous city for him.\n\nBy the time he discovered the site appropriate for Chiang Mai, he had already been living for 5 years at Wiang Khum Kham(see map below), a walled city he had built on the bank of the Ping River in the Chiang Mai valley, now an excavated and completely restored archaeological site located in Sarapee district, south of modern Chiang Mai.\n\nSite Surveys and Selection of the \"Chaiya Phum\"\n\nAt age 57 and having been an energetic ruler for almost 40 years, Mangrai oftentravelled around in the vast valley region, accompanied by his troops and advisors, searching for a perfect location to build his permanent capital. Whenever he found an attractive and peaceful site, he would stop to sleep overnight to make further survey and to look for what he called \"auspicious signs\" and \"good omens\", according to traditional concepts and beliefs, and according to his policy.\n\nOne day in 1291, he came across an ideal location at the foothills of Doi Suthep which sloped down from the west to the great river basin in the east. In the middle of this vast open valley, there was idyllic and picturesque grassland where he sighted some rare species of animals unafraid of his troops, and found some unique auspicious plants, especially a giant fig tree. He especially observed a crystal-clear waterfall, flowing from Doi Suthep into streams, surrounding the area; and on the eastern edge of this vast plain, there was a wide and long river called River Ping which meandered down from north to south.\n\nThis area had been inhabited for hundreds of years by many indigenous and ancient tribes, especially the people called \" Lua\" or \" Lawa\"who live at the foot of Doi Suthep they regarded as the sacred mountain of their ancestors' spirit as well as the abode of the revered and knowledgeable teacher, Sudeva.\n\nMangrai sought the advice of his noblemen and astrologists and they all agreed that everything they had seen at the site indicated a perpetual natural abundance and a sign of good omen for the founding of a \"Chaiyanakorn\" (a victorious city) in accordance with the ancient traditional beliefs. Convinced that this ravishingly bountiful location was exactly where his new city must be constructed, he moved in to occupy the site on Thursday 27 March 1292.\n\nThen Mangraiinvited his 2 sworn brothers: king Ngarmmuang of Payoa and King Ruang (Ramkamhaeng) of the celebrated Sukhothai kingdom (a world heritage site since 1991) to visit the site and consulted them on the suitability of the location and the city plan. The two kings meticulously surveyed the area; they observed 7 signs of good omen especially the signs that indicated the abundance of water such as the waterfalls, the reservoir, the streams and the river, all of which they considered to be a boon to the city (Nakorn Kun). They fully concurred that the new city should be established on that site.\n\nFor Mangrai, and to a great extent, for the two invited kings, it was vitally important that this permanent capital of Lanna would effectively function as a powerful defense stronghold in the north, as well as a commanding political base which would exercise a strong influence and control over other Tai states in the area. Agriculture and trade for the prosperity of the population were also of serious consideration.\n\nThe three kings had, since 1287, made a pact of strategic alliance against the threat of invasion of foreign enemies, particularly the Mongols of the Yuan Dynasty of China who in 1257 had taken control of Yunnan, capturing Chiangrung in Sipsong Panna, the hometown of Mangrai's mother. The historical allaince of the 3 kings was indeed unique and critically significant to the region at that time.(This act is immortalized by the 2.70m -tall bronze \"Monument of the Three Kings\" now standing in the central plaza of the renovated area of Chiang Mai).\n\nAccording to \"Zinme Yazawin\", written by Sithu Gamani Thingyam, (University of Yangon, 2003), there were 7 signs of good omens, described as follows:\n\n“First, a white mouse- deer family came to the area, and were unafraid of men. Second, the family of red- fur mouse deer, with the white patch on the head and along the spine and white four legs, came down from the forest and chased away the soldiers. Third, Doi Suthep Mountain located to the west, was regarded sacred not only to the native Lawa, but also revered by the Mon as the abode of Haripunchai’s legendary creator, the Sacred Rushi named Sudeva; the mountain thus ensured spiritual stability and physical protection in the west. Fourth, the water, cascaded down from the top of mountain and flowing north into a stream, turned east and flowed along the south side of the Chaiya Phume area, then turned west to form a natural defense for the area. Fifth, the topography was also of good omen as the land level was higher in the west and lower in the east. Sixth, the stream, flowing east, adjoined the Mae Ping River on the east of the auspicious area, and flowed along it, curving to the south. The Mae Ping river was also a good omen as it flowed from the \"Anotatt lake\" (Sra Anodat) on another mountain range in Chiangdoa, and flowed constantly in the east of the city. Seventh, there was a large lake to the northeast of the auspicious area, a lake that was mentioned in the \"treatise on Dreams\" and in Brahmanic treatise on omens, as a pleasure place and a lake of ambrosia”.\n\nIn terms of agriculture and trading connection, the selected site which was open green fields were suitable for agriculture, especially wet rice cultivation. The wide, long Mae Ping River offered an excellent communication for trade and for the control of other states. Indeed, the site was easily connected to the ancient caravan routes where traders from India, Burma and Yunnan traveled with tea horses and cattle caravans through the many mountain trails and tracks.\n\nThe Construction of the Fortified City\n\nThe immediate concern of Chiang Mai was defense and durability of the city both in time of peace and war. The three kings therefore designed the city of Chiang Mai to be the competent and operative defense post of the region and this concern alone dictated that the fortified city could not be too large or too small; for in time of war the city would have enough men and elephants to defend all the posts and ramparts of the city. Taking this into consideration, Mangrai had to reduce the size of the city by half of what he had wanted.\n\nThe city plan was unique because Mangrai mixed the traditional Tai beliefs and the indigenous Lawa's knowledge and technology together, combining them with the Hindu Buddhist concept of cosmology possibly influenced by the King of Sukhothai. The fortified city was rectangular in shape, almost a square, and was to symbolize a human figure with the head, the back, the stomach, the hands and the feet. The form was to represent a human living in complete harmony with nature, to be connected with it, to profit from the natural setting but not to change or overpower it.\n\nThe city plan thus symbolized a peaceful and a prosperous person, lying with the back turned to the west towards the strong and stable mountain, safeguarded by its sacred spirits; while the stomach facing the river on the east, full and round and hanging down from the northeast to the south, like that of a pregnant woman, was doubly protected by the outer walls and moats.\n\nThe construction work of the new city did not begin until the 19 April 1269, about 6 years after the site had been chosen. Prior to the commencement of the construction, Mangrai made 3 sets of offerings. The first set was presented to the guarding spirits of the site, whereas the second set was offered to the spirits of the giant white rats, the unique species of animals which he had seen entering into the Banyan tree, and regarded as a good omen. The third set was divided into 5 parts which were given each to the spirits of all the 5 places where the city gates would be constructed.\n\nA group of 50,000 men were recruited to construct the royal residence, the residence of the consorts, and the Throne Hall, as well as the storehouses and stables for elephants and horses which were used in times of warfare. Another group of 40,000 men were engaged to construct the city walls, observation towers, city gates, and city moats as well as the boat- sheds. The market of Chiang Mai was also opened at the same time in the central area of the city, called \" Khuang Luang\". Land use was planned following the natural topography of the area combined with the Lanna astrological beliefs.\n\nAfter 4 months, the construction works were completed, and the three founders blessed the new city with a very auspicious name: \" Noppa Buri Sri Nakorn Ping Chiang Mai\", commonly called \" Chiang Mai\" until today.\n\nOnce again, the three kings performed a big offering ceremony. They had 6 sets of offerings prepared, and together they invoked all the heavenly spirits to come down and reside as the guarding angels at the six important stations considered as the most venerable spots: --- at the city's navel, and at the 5 city gates. After the ceremonies, according to the Chiang Mai Chronicle, a huge festival was hosted for 3 days and 3 nights with plenty of food and drinks for all the officers and the workers who had constructed the city.\n\nThe Significance of the Ceremonies and the Celebration\n\nThe ceremonies performed by Mangrai at the commencement and at the completion of the construction were important parts of the city foundation. The ceremonies were conducted in accordance with the traditions of the Tai Yuan people who were the majority of the population of the towns and states consolidated under Mangrai's Lanna Kingdom.\n\nThe Tai Yuan and most other Tai people believed in the heavenly beings and they also worshipped the ancestors' spirits called \"Pi Pu Ya\", as well as the spirits of the forest which they called \"Pi Pa\" worshiped also by the Lua or lawa people. The Tai additionally believed that in each village or in any fortified important place, there was a spiritual center, or a heart and soul, called \"Jai Ban - Jai Muang\"; but in the case of the center of the city, it was called \"Sadue Muang\" or the city's navel. Though the Tai in general embraced Buddhism as their religion and a way of life, they mostly maintained their traditional beliefs as well.\n\nThe Tai people had a high level of administrative organization system, and a rich material and architectural civilization. They were more refined in their cultural expressions and more advanced in the linguistic traditions than the native Lawa and Kha peoples who, in spite of living closer to nature, were not at all uncivilized, as they had their own knowledge and technology systems. The Tai Yuan were generally rice farmers (glutinous rice) and had knowledge of horticulture, language and literature, and arts and crafts.\n\nThe Tai in Lanna and other Tai groups in all the neighboring towns enjoyed for a long time, close ethnic relations and a bond of kinship; they also shared a common linguistic and literary heritage, oral as well as in written forms.\n\nWhen Mangraiheld the ceremony to celebrate the completion of Chiang Mai, he significantly proclaimed the greatness of his new capital to other states and all the diverse sectors of his population. In the all the ceremonies, he showed great respect for the Tai and indigenous customs and beliefs, but also publicly demonstrated his devotion to Buddhism. According to an inscription (see photo) found at WatChiangman, Mangrai donated his temporary residence where he had lived and worked while planning and building the city to be the Temple named \"Wat Chiang Man\" meaning \"the temple of the city's stability\". His act of combining the traditions of the Tai, the Lua, and the Buddhist culture in this important public ceremony heralded a new cultural era of Lanna.\n\nThe Tai people had a high level of administrative organization system, and a rich material and architectural civilization.

However, he also publicly demonstrated his devotion to Buddhism, for example, according to an inscription found at Wat Chiangman, Mangrai donated his temporary residence where he had lived and worked while planning and building the city to be the first temple within the city wall and named it \"Wat Chiang Man\" meaning \"the temple of the city's stability\". His act of combining the traditions of the Tai, the Lua, and the Buddhist culture in this important public ceremony heralded a new cultural era of Lanna.\n\nChiang Maiafter the Death of Mangrai\n\nMangrai ruled Lanna from Chiang Mai for 20 years until his unexpected death, hit by a thunderbolt at the exact central spot of his city and was believed to become a guarding angel of the city residing at this spot where now stands \"the temple of the naval of the city\" (Wat Sadue Muang).\n\nSome versions of the Chiang Mai Chronicle, however, claimed that he became ill and moved to Wiang Kum Kam and died there. By the time of his death, Chiang Mai had already been widely accepted as the political and spiritual center of the Lanna region.\n\nHis descendants, though not always as strong, continued to rule Lanna for more than 200 years. Not all of them ruled from Chiang Mai, as some preferred to live in one of Mangrai's previous capitals.\n\nChiang Mai in the Golden Era\n\nThere were some greatly distinguished kings of the Mangrai dynasty, particularly the sixth king, Kuena (1355-1385) and the ninth King, Tilokraj (1441-1487) who developed the kingdom to its height of civilization. They built a great many Buddhist temples, stupas and other important public places with high technology in grand and glorious archaeological styles which were to be known later as the classic Lanna styles.\n\nThe Chiang Mai Chronicle praised Kuena as a ruler with \" justice and deep faith in the teaching of Buddha who built temples and Chediya in great splendor... and who was deeply versed in the knowledge of various disciplines, such as: “Dharmasastra”, “Rajasastra”, History and the ten arts\"...The splendidly gilded Stupa of Wat Pra That Doi Suthep was constructed on top of Doi Suthep by King Kuenato enshrine the Buddha's Sacred Relic presented to him from Sukhothai; this stupa and its temple compound has remained the spiritual symbol of Chiang Mai until today.\n\nDecline and Fragmentation\n\nSoon the Chiang Mai kings became entangled in a series of wars with Ayutthya and the Shan state, thus losing many of their able noblemen and their strong manpower. Chiang Mai subsequently became much weakened. It was finally taken under the control of Burma in 1558 by the expansive king, Bayinnaung, of the Toungoo dynasty. Chiang Mai remained under the Burmese administration for 200 years during which time it became impoverished and fractured, and its civilization stagnated and lay sadly dormant.\n\nBetween 1701 and 1733, the Burmese divided the Lanna Kingdom into East Lanna, centered at Chiangsaen, and West Lanna based at Chiang Mai.\n\nIn 1775, a group of Lanna princes based in Lampang rebelled against the Burmese and supported the Siamese military campaigns to drive away the Burmese from their territories. The Siamese had just lost their capital at Ayutthya to Burma in 1767, and immediately, the movements to reconsolidate the Siamese Kingdom had been vigorously launched by the King of Thonburi and the future Bangkok King. The military campaigns against the Burmese lasted almost 20 years and Chiang Mai, situated between Siam and Burma, was constantly on the front lines of the battlefields. While the princes and nobles had to fight in the battles, Chiang Mai's population fled to safer towns leaving the city of Chiang Mai practically deserted and almost in the state of disintegration. When the Burmese were finally driven away, Chiang Mai still had to revive its capital and regain the influence it previously had over the towns and states in the north.\n\nThe Rebirth of Lanna\n\nBy 1796, Prince Kawila( see photo), with the support from Bangkok, revived Chiang Mai so that it could serve as the center of Lanna. He mobilized the diverse groups of population from all the nearby villages and towns to resettle in Chiang Mai and restored and renovated the important buildings, especially all the important temples and places built in the Mangrai dynasty. He established the \"Choa Chet Ton\" (Seven Princes' Dynasty) to be the Lanna's new lineage for the righteous succession to the Chiang Mai throne. Though Chiang Mai was then, in status, a tributary kingdom of Bangkok, Kawila was well trusted and was able to govern his own kingdom quite freely.\n\nKawila also revived the ancient Lanna cultures and traditions, especially the Coronation Ceremony, and the traditional linguistic and literary traditions, as well as all the important Buddhist ceremonies performed in the Lanna styles. He promoted many lanna celebrations, Lanna music and dances, as well as craftsmanship.\n\nKing Kawila followed the ancient tradition by entering the city of Chiang Mai through the northern gate: the most auspicious \"Gate of the Head of the City\", (renamed \"Chang Phuek Gate\" (gate of the white elephant) since Kuena’s time.) He dressed in the full Lanna regalia as all kings of the Mangrai Dynasty had done in the past. His dynasty continually ruled Chiang Mai and Lanna for more than a hundred years with the blessing of Bangkok.\n\nInterchanges with Other Cultures in the Modern Era\n\nChiang Mai under the early kings of Choa Chet Ton became alive and prosperous once again through trades and through its diverse creative energies, as testified by the new waves of artistic and architectural restoration and new creation. As it grew and greatly expanded; its prosperity, its natural abundance and its beautiful natural and cultural environments caught the interest of the foreigner powers which appeared on the regional scene at the time. The British and the French had already gained control of Chiang Mai's neighboring kingdoms in the north and the northeast, and began to extend their influences into Chiang Mai.\n\nBritish rule in Burma began in 1824, and having subsequently won the Second Anglo-Burmese War, the British annexed Lower Burma in 1852. Siam also felt the pressure from the British and agreed to conclude in 1855 the Bowring Treaty between Great Britain and Siam. In 1874 and then in 1883, special treaties concerning northern cities of Siam were signed by Siam and the British government in India. A British Consul was appointed then to Chiang Mai, being the first diplomat in the North.\n\nChiang Mai, as Bangkok had led the way, began its new era of “open-door” and interchanges with foreign cultures, through the acceptance of modern sciences and medicine, western technology, and modern education. The city became home to a range of residential and professional communities which left a tangible mark upon the fabric and the architectural landscape of the city.\n\nFollowing the overall national reform policy of Siam, the reform of provincial administration came as a necessity. In 1884 the Northern Region Administration was put in place by King Chulalongkorn who sent his brother, KrommoenPhichitpreechakorn to serve as the first special commissioner to the North, centered at Chiang Mai.\n\nDuring the early reform period, Princess Dararassami(see photo) of Chiang Mai accepted the gifts of engagement from King Chulalongkorn, and soon after, she was given permission by her father, King Inthanon, to travel to Bangkok and become his royal consort, living in the Grand Palace.\n\nAs part of the reform policy and strategy, the communication system within the Siamese Kingdom was also improved. Traveling by boat and on elephants or horses was too slow and exhausting for administration and political purposes. In 1888, Bangkok established the first telegraph line with Chiang Mai. The northern railway was constructed and reached Phitsanulok in 1909, reaching Lampang and Chiang Mai in 1916 and 1919. Cars and buses were also introduced to Chiang Mai around the same time.\n\nThe reform of the Northern Administration continued until the advent of democracy in Siam in 1932. The monarchy in Chiang Mai ended then, replaced by a government appointed by the central Thai government.\n\nChiang Mai and the continued Lanna Civilization through the History\n\nBecause Chiang Mai has lived for 700 years, its civilization has, over the centuries, been developed, reached its peak, declined and revived in many successive eras. Chiang Mai's development however has never been in isolation, but has been tied to the events and developments of the Lanna’s history, the history of Siam or Thailand, and also the history of Asia and the world.\n\nThe numerous important historical and cultural monuments and sites of Chiang Mai which symbolize its identity and spirituality, including its cultural landscape, have naturally been subject to destruction and decay during the wars, and to necessary repair and modification after the wars, but the repair and modification were always carried out by the Lanna kings and communities, with the Lanna’s feeling and in the spirit of the Lanna cultures and traditions.\n\nIn modern era, technological and educational advancement particularly from the west have been accepted into the city as considered necessary at the time, and they contributed, to an important extent, to the survival and further prosperity of Chiang Mai and its population.\n\nToday, Chiang Mai is a city very much alive and exuberant, with a population of more than 1,600,000 (on official count), of whom 172,000 live in Chiang Mai city. About 80% are locals by birth, speak the Lanna’s \"kam muang\" language, and practice the Lanna style of Buddhism.\n\nThe city has been expanding rapidly, bustling with all modern facilities - first class hotels and restaurants, theatres and cinemas, sports complexes and golf courses, shopping malls and supermarkets and open markets, hospitals and condominiums. Yet the city and its people are conscious of this historical and cultural uniqueness and are trying rather successfully to preserve and maintain the city’s historic quarters, buildings and spaces, and its natural setting.\n\nAfter more than 700 years of growth and expansion, the physical and intangible evidences of the city as a masterpiece of the creative and visionary urban planning are still in evidence: the moats, the walls, the gates and the corners, the 40 ancient temples within the city walls, and hundreds more outside, together with the marketplaces, and the different communities of diverse ethnic groups and cultures.\n\nIn spite of rapid modern urbanization, the monuments, the sites and the cultural landscape of Chiang Mai, capital of Lanna which have been nominated under this nomination, all testify to the unique and creative genius in urban planning which enable it to endure and flourish until today. The interchanges of human values over the centuries and the long- lasting civilization of the multitude of populations who call themselves the Lanna people also continued throughout and are very much present today. The cultural landscape of the sacred Doi Suthep and its sloping plains as well as the Mae Ping River still provide tangible and spiritual significance to the city and people, and there are many festivals and traditions held annually in association with them.\n\nChiang Mai is today a seat of learning in many disciplines, and is home to five universities, Buddhist and Christian seminaries, technical colleges, four international English language schools and one German school, as well as a large university teaching hospital and several private ones, some with nursing schools. There are also many private language schools as well as the AUA, the British Council, Australian and New Zealand centers and the Alliance Francaise. Chiang Mai is also the home of many museums, galleries, archives and library, and of many heritage administrations located within the temples and communities.\n\nThere are many conservation groups in the Chiang Mai Communities; some of them are the elderly people, and many of them young students and active academics, who gather regularly at their community temples to do many kinds of social and cultural voluntary works and to organize traditional and religious events. These people form the core of the conservation group of the Chiang Mai, capital of Lanna.\n\nWith regards to the possibility of Chiang Mai being nominated as a world Heritage site, a number of consultations and hearings have been organized by the Chiang Mai University, with the participation of representatives from various occupations and age groups, including the abbots of all the temples in the Chiang Mai old town and the environs. The results have been positive and cooperation has been pledged.\n\nDescription of the nominated property\n\nAserial nomination\n\nThis is a serial nomination comprising six (6) groups, or 6 series, of selected monuments, sites, and cultural landscape of Chiang Mai. They are nominated together in a single nomination to represent a set of interconnected thematic value or values proposed to be accepted.\n\nThe 6 series of properties are all functionally linked and coherently interrelated. They collectively form the wholeness of the tangible evidences, as well as the associated intangible traditions. Collectively, they define and display the outstanding universal values of Chiang Mai as the capital of Lanna, built in the 13th century but survived its long and sometimes turbulent history and sustained significantly, in tangible forms as well as intangibly, until today.\n\nThe list of the Nominated Properties\n\nThe nominated properties are grouped into 6 groups as follows\n\nGroup 1: The cultural landcape of the old city of Chiang Mai.\n\nThe cultural landscape of old Chiang Mai are mixed between natural heritage and cultural heritage. Considered by the founder of Chiang Mai and his advisors to be the auspicious attributes to the ideal and victorious location according to the traditional beliefs and geomancy for city planning, and in accordance with the Lanna philosophy of \"Chaiya Phum\", today the cultural landscape of Chiang Mai is still of vital importance to the modern-day city, and generally embraced by the people as symbols of their spiritual identity.\n\nThe Chiang Mai cultural landscape is composed of:\n\n1.1.Doi Suthep-Pui National Park\n\nThe Doi Suthep-Pui Park, highly rich in biodiversity, is located 16km.northwest of old city of Chiang Mai, and has been designated and protected as the Suthep-Pui National Park since 1973. It covers an area of 261 square km of mountain evergreen pine mixed with deciduous forests, and lower- leveled dry dipterocarps. At the highest peak, it is about 1,658m above the sea level. This mountain, which is a multi- peaks complex system forming an important part of the western mountainous ranges in northern Thailand, is worshipped by the indigenous Lawa people as the abode of their ancestors' spirits, long before the arrival of Mangrai.\n\nThe Suthep- Pui national park is home to a great biodiversity, with over 300 birds species, many of them rare and endemic, including Banded Kingfisher, Green Longtailed Broadbill, Silver Pheasant, Giant Nuthatch, Mrs. Hume's Pheasant, Spot- Breasted Parrotbill, and Red- faced Riocichla. There are 5 waterfalls in the forest area, more than 300 bird species and nearly 2000 species of ferns and flowering plants, and in the rainy season, butterflies bloom as abundantly as the flowers.\n\nIn 1997, a large scale deforestation was reported in the upper Mae Sa valley resulted in the loss of about 17% of the Suthep -Pui National Park area (Thailand Development Research Foundation 1997), causing drying up of the major streams that supplied water for drinking and agriculture purposes. Such a situation left the villagers with a strong sense of the link between deforestation and loss of livelihoods sources. Faced with acute water shortage, the villagers moved down from 1300 m to its present location at 1000 m elevation about 40 years back.\n\nIn order to reverse the negative impacts of forest destruction; the villagers also initiated community efforts to restore the degraded areas which were later supported by the technical inputs from the Forest Restoration Research Unit of Chiang Mai University Currently there are many scientific studies done and published on the biodiversity in the Park area, especially bird diversity, and reforestation of Suthep -Pui.\n\nThere are also are many living local traditions, such as the annual offerings presented to the “Pu Sae-Ya-Sae”, the ancestors spirits, and the Annual Tradition of walking up on foot to pay homage to the Buddha's Relic by the students of Chiang Mai University.\n\nThe Park includes some very important built properties which are also included in the nominated series of Group1. As follows\n\n1.1.1. Wat Pra That Doi Suthep\n\nThe Temple of the Sacred Buddha's Relic Doi Suthep, situated at the top of one of the mountain peaks of Doi Suthep, and can be seen glittering in the sun on a fine day. It was originally built by King Kuena of the Mangrai Dynasty in 1419 AD to enshrine the Relic brought from Sukhothai by the learned great monk, Pra Sumana Thera.\n\nThere are many legends told and recorded about the history and development of the temple, especially about the selection of its special location. When Pra Sumana brought the Buddha's the Relic to Chiang Mai, there was only one Relic, and the King had planned to build a stupato enshrine at Wat Suan Dok just outside the Western Gate where the King 's Garden Palace was located,enclosed within the fortified walls. The Buddha's Relic then duplicated into two pieces. The King therefore kept one piece at Wat Suan Dok, very much associated with the King. The other piece therefore must be placed where the people in entire area could be associated with King Kuena placed the relic in a safe container and put it on the back of an elephant. Starting from the Gate of the Head of the City in the North, now called the Chang Puak Gate, the elephant was let loose, and it ran all the way up to the top of Doi Suthep where it moved around an area three times and collapsed on the spot. The King then decided that the spot was auspicious as the site for the Relic Stupa and its temple.\n\nWat Pra That Doi Suthep has been regarded,in the past as in the present, as the number one destination of Buddhist pilgrims from all area of Lanna. It has been expanded and further embellished by successive kings in the historic time, and the commoners made donation in whatever way they could as the Lanna people traditionally believed, and still do, that restoration and embellishment of the sacred temple would ensure the greatest merit not only for this life but also for the next life.\n\n1.1.2. The Road.\n\nThe road from the foot of Doi Suthep leading to the temple of Pra That Doi Suthep is a very important historical monument because it was built in 1935 under the leadership of a Lanna born and locally revered monk named Kuba Si Vichai (born 1878).Kuba Si Vichai spent part of his life, travelling to all parts in the Lanna area and restored so many old and deteriorated Buddhist temples by successfully raising funds and labor from the local communities.\n\nBecause of his leadership and the inspirational nature of his personality, at least 5000 people from all walks of life and from all the villages in Lanna came daily with their own hand tools to volunteer to work in the construction of the road at Doi Suthep. The construction was symbolically launched by King Kaewnavarut, the ruler of Chiang Mai at that time, on 9 November,1934, at 10.00 a.m. at the foot of Doi Suthep near Huay Kaew. It was completed in 5 months and 22 days, and was opened for public use on 30 April 1935.\n\nThe road represents the Lanna villagers' strong devotion to the Buddha's Relic, as well as their powerful sense of community participation to the spiritual and intangible cause for merit-making. The road was complete so rapidly that the leadership of Chiang Mai administration at that time could not believe it could be done.\n\n1.1.3. Wat Pa Lad.\n\nAlong the road leading to Wat Pra That Doi Suthep, Ku Ba Si Vichai also designed and built a few temples where there were waterfalls and stone caves and rock slopes that the monks and villagers who came to work could use for resting. Wat Pha Lad is one of these temples that has been preserved as restored for contemporary use as a meditation center.\n\n1.2) Chet Lin\n\nThis site, meaning 7 streams, is located at the foot of Doi Suthep only 5 km. from the Chiang Mai Old City, and was seen from an aerial photograph dated 1957 as a doubled walled circular area, with a diameter of 900 m. Its history and functions are still shrouded in mystery.\n\nThe area was surveyed by the Unit 6 of the Archaeological Office of the Fine Arts Department who identified it to be the fortified and moated township of the legendary Khun Wiranka, King of the Lawa who according to the chronicle, sent an envoy to ask for the hand of Queen Chamadevi of Haripunchai in the 8th century AD. When his proposition was rudely refused, he sent armies to wage war with the Kingdom and was humiliated and defeated by Chamadevi's 2 sons. The Township was later deserted and the fortified area was temporarily occupied by the Sukhothai armies during the war with King Samfangkaen(พ.ศ.1945 – 1985) of Chiang Mai.\n\nTraces of ancient Buddhist temples were also identified as evidences of Chiang Mai's expansion into the outer area.\n\nThe site has been divided into 2 parts by a public road from the city leading up to Doi Suthep. The part on the west which catches and stores the water flowing heavily in the rainy season from Doi Suthep is now preserved as a natural reservoir with the original high embankment made of mounded earth. The reservoir has been protected on this side because it is connected with the compound of the Animal Husbandry Office of the Forestry Department and the Chiang Mai Zoo, but is open and easily accessed from the road. It is marked by a sign post on the roadside explaining its significance. The eastern side of Chet Lin is the larger area of the site and lies within the compound of the Rajamankla University, Chet Lin Campus. It has been seriously surveyed and studied by the university academics who found traces and remnants indicating ancient settlements dated perhaps to more than 5000 years. The project for its preservation and further research has been recently given government’s support.\n\n1.3) Mae Ping River\n\nThis river has its origin at Chiangdoa, a part of Doi Intanon Mountain Range, protected by law as part of the Sri Lanna National Park and the Chiangdoa National Reserved Forest. The River, the largest in the region, runs along from North to south, forming a great river basin and plentiful area east of Chian Mai. Mae Ping River also served as the route of trade and communication between Chiang Mai and its controlled states in Lanna, as well as the outside world.\n\nLike most rivers in the world, Mae Ping now is being watched. It is being revitalized by the Upper Mae Ping Basin Management Project, undertaken by Wildlife Fund Thailand since 1997, and also joined by Mae Ping community network and Mae Ping Resuscitation Network involving more than 100 villages. In addition, an NGO group called \"Love Mae Ping\" was formed in 1992 (See Global Perspectives on Integrated Water Resources Management by Ganesh Pangare, VirajShah; and Rivers in Jeopardy and the Role of Civil Society in River Restoration: Thai Experience, by Wason Jompakdee, Chairman, The Coordinating Committee for the Protection of the Ping Rivers Basin and the Environment (CCPE), and Vice Dean, Faculty of Engineering, Chiang Mai University).\n\n1.4) Mae Kha\n\nMae Kha(see photo below) is a stream which runs from the north of the Chiang Mai old city and curves along the shape of the outer moat, forming an additional natural moat from the northeast to the southeast of the old city of Chiang Mai. Recently it has become badly polluted and the Chiang Mai community and the Municipality is trying to find the cause and solve the problem.\n\n2. Group 2.: Historically Important Monuments, sites, and Landscape which form the Inner Fortification of the city of Chiang Mai, comprising the following:\n\n2.1) The inner city walls on 4 sides, destroyed in certain parts, but restored in important sections and are in good restoration conditions.\n\n2.2) The inner moats on 4 sides, dug and cleaned regularly, now serve a new function as a city park and a city landscape.\n\n2.3) The 5 city gates,with the designated names, located on the 5 cardinal directions, restored in different historical periods, and last restored by the City Municipalities and the Fine Arts Department, based on archaeological studies and old photo.\n\na) Pratu Chang Puak (formerly Pratu Hua Kuang), in the north, considered the most important gate.\n\nb) Pratu Suan Dok, in the west, which opened into the forested c) Pratu Tha Pae, in the east, which led to the river.\n\nd) Pratu Tai Wiang, in the southeast, later renamed Pratu Chiang Mai,(see photo) which led to Wiang Kumkam and\n\ne) Pratu Saen Pung in the southwest, also known as Pratu Haiya leading to the Haiya Cemetery\n\n2.4) The 4 city corners (Jaeng) which form ramparts in the cardinal direction system, have historically designated names have been restored and now serve a contemporary function as the city’s landscape and park\n\na) Jaeng Sri Phum, in the northeast\n\nb) Jaeng Katam, in the southwest\n\nc) Jaeng Gu Huang in the southwest\n\nd) Jaeng Huo Lin, in the nortwest\n\nThe fortification of the City of Chiang Mai was unique in the sense that it was not only physical and technical in nature, but also spiritual. The core concept of the fortification of Chiang Mai signified the boundary of the Auspicious City (Sri Nakorn), whose fortified rectangular area, as well as the five gates, and the central spot or the naval, were believed to be blessed and protected by all of the sacred beings, petitioned through the offering ceremonies made by Mangrai himself before the commencement of the City's construction as well as at the completion of the construction. In Modern times, offering ceremonies to the guardian spirits of the city and all the inner gates are still regularly held by the Governor and the municipality chief as well as the people of Chiang Mai.\n\nDated back to Mangrai period, the original city moats, walls and gates were periodically cleaned and repaired as deemed necessary by successive kings of the Mangrai Dynasty. After the prolonged wars with Burma, the fortification of the city was completely overhauled by King Kawila of the Choa Chet Ton Dynasty, as the threats of war still continued.\n\nThe monuments and sites listed above collectively represent the physical boundary for defensive purpose and for the demarcation of the center of administration and political power, distinct and separate from the surrounding areas. They were restored most recently in 1985-86 by the Chiang Mai Municipality and the Fine Arts Department.\n\n3 Group 3: Important Monuments, Sites and Landscape which form the Outer Fortification\n\nThe outer city walls and the outer moats of Chiang Mai do not follow the plan and the lines of the inner fortification. They are constructed in an oblong shape that begins at the northeastern corner of the City, called \"Jaeng Sri Phum\" and extends out along the eastern front of the city, like a full stomach or the tummy of a pregnant woman, hanging down to the south, curving around it to reach the southwest corner of the city called \"Jaeng Ku Huang\". They are listed for the nomination as follows:\n\n3.1) The Outer Walls which are now called “Kampaeng Din” located on the eastern and southern sides\n\n3.2) The 4 Outer City Gates which are located along the curves of the Outer walls, with designated names.\n\n3.3) The Outer Moats curving along the outer city walls\n\n4. Group 4: The important monuments and sites within the city walls\n\nImportant monuments selected under this group mostly dated back to the MangraiDynasty. Although suffered from rapid urbanization, change of land ownership, and encroachment of new buildings, all the monuments and sites within the city walls have been relatively well preserved and maintained. Restoration was deemed by the kings of Chiang Mai and the communityas necessary, as most of them are Buddhist temples,to which donations for the repair and maintenances are given by the devotees because they do not want to see Buddhist temples in the state of decay and depreciation. Restoration of historically and archaeologically important monuments in modern days is designed and supervised by the Fine Arts Department, but often the community participation is allowed and welcomed.\n\nThe monuments and sites selected under this group are representatives of the primary evidences of the historical development of Chiang Mai. They were built by Mangrai and his descendants and bear testimony to the unique Lanna school of Buddhist architecture and art that continue to flourish until the present. They are listed in 5 subgroups following the 4 cardinal directions plus the concept of the naval of the city, as follows:\n\n4.1.

Group 5: Important Historical Monuments and Sites Outside the Inner Fortification\n\nThe monuments and sites located outside the inner fortification are also historically and culturally important. They represented primary evidences of the Chiang Mai 's development in Buddhist arts and architectures.\n\nThey are listed in 2 subgroups: 5.A representing the monuments located within the Chiang Mai city environs in the 4 cardinal directions; 5.B representing the monuments in the outer district in the Southern outskirt of Chiang Mai.\n\n5.A.

Monuments and sites in the outer area of Chiang Mai\n\n5.B.1.Wiang Kum Kam\n\nThis important archaeological site is, according to the Chiang Mai Chronicle, the former Capital of Mangrai, located in Saraphi District, South of Chiang Mai. Inundated by the floods and deserted for many centuries, Wiang Kumkam has been excavated and restored and is presently being revived as an archaeological and a historical Park. Its important monuments and sites are listed as follows.\n\n1) Wat Chedi Liam\n\n2)Wat Phra Chao Ong Dam-Phaya Mangrai:\n\n3) Wat ThatKhoa\n\n4) Wat pupia\n\n5) Wat Sri Bun Ruang\n\n6) Wat Soa Hin\n\n7) Wat Ku Ay Larn\n\n8 Wat Ku Makrua\n\n9) Wat Chok Bok\n\n10) Wat Bot.\n\n11) Wat Kan Tom (Chang Kam)\n\n12) Wat E Khang\n\n13) Wat Kum Kam\n\n14) Wat Noi\n\n15) Wat Kan Thom.\n\n16) Wat Hua Nong.\n\n17) Wat Mai Sang\n\n18) Wat Kua Nong.\n\n19) Wat Nong Phung.\n\n20) Wat Pan Soa.\n\n21) Wat Pra Ut.\n\n22) Wat Bo Nam Thip\n\n5.B.2. The old road from Lampun to Wiang Kum Kam. (See photo)\n\nThe road is 10 km long and is lined with majestic Dipterocarpus alatus trees planted when the road was constructed 100 years ago. There used to be as many as 5000 trees on both sides. During the past 2-3 decades, urbanization and growth in the area have resulted in the loss of so many of these trees, cut down to make way for intersections and modern housing. However, the conservation group of Chiang Mai and Lamphun has so far successfully campaigned for the preservation of this historic road and the trees.\n\n6.Group 6. Monuments and Sites of Modern Era. This group of monuments represent the important human interchanges in the modern era, comprising the following :\n\n1) The First Christian Mission in Chiang Mai\n\n2) The first school building of the Prince Royal College\n\n3) The first school building of Dara College\n\n4) The first hospital building of the McCormic Hospital\n\n5) The first Chinese community temple\n\n6) The first Sikh temple\n\n7) The first Muslim community and mosque\n\n2. The criteria to be met:\n\nAs indicated above, the criteria to be met for this serial nomination are: Criteria: 1,2, 3,and 6. The reasons are: that the monuments, sites and the cultural landscape nominated collectively form important attributes to the universal values based on criteria 1, 2, 3, and 6, (with the cultural landscape as part of the criteria), as described in the description of the nominated properties.\n\n3. Protection under national laws.\n\nAll the nominated properties have been studied, preserved and/or conserved, And have been registered as nationally important to be protected by laws. Important protection laws relevant to the nominated properties are:\n\na) The Suthep Pui National Park registered and protected under the laws of ministry of Environment,\n\nb) The archaeological monuments and sites are protected as archeological property under National Act for the protection of ancient monuments, ancient objects, art objects, and national museums, 2535.\n\nc) Chiang Mai Municipality's Law concerning the type, style, distance, and height of buildings and the prohibited area of construction, demolition, adaptation, or transporting of certain types of buildings in the Municipality area of Chiang Mai, ..)\n\n(See also Kana Kammakarn Chamra PrawattisatThai Lae Chad Pim Ekasarn Tang PrawattisatLae Borankadee, Muang Lae Lang Cumchon Boran Lanna, in Thai, BE 2539); Krom Silapakorn, Karn Kun Tabien Borannasathan Kong Pak Nua, in Thai, BE 2525; 3. Elliott and Cubit, the National Parks of Thailand 2001.)\n\nJustification of Outstanding Universal Value\n\nThe nominated properties, presented in 6 groups under the serial nomination, as described in the description of the nominated properties, are the tangible evidences which collectively exhibit theoutstanding universal values of Chiang Mai, Capital of Lanna, based on the following\n\nCriterion (i): Chiang Mai, the capital of Lanna, represents a masterpiece of human creative genius in the field of urban planning. It exhibits the essence of the traditional Tai people’s social, cultural, and spiritual values of living in harmony with nature respecting its invisible power of the mountains, the valleys, and the rivers. It also exhibits the founders' intelligence in harmoniously taking advantage of its protection and abundance in a sustainable way so that the city can thrive until today.\n\nChiang Mai city was designed to serve a multiple set of specific purposes, as follows:\n\na) Defense;\n\nb) Central administration to control and oversee the large number of states that were previously independent and, some of them rather distant, united under the suzerainty of his kingdom;\n\nc) Connectivity with nature and benefiting from the surrounding natural landscape;\n\nd) Prosperity through wet rice cultivation and production;\n\ne) Prosperity through trades, both via the ancient routes of transporting goods by tea- horse and ox cart caravans, connecting with the silk route in China, India and other areas, as well as through the river borne trading system using boats of all sizes and linking with other river- based;\n\nf) Development of a new Lanna civilization through tangible and intangible cultural expressions and exchanges with the rich diversity of population in the Chiang Mai valley and in the entire Lanna.\n\nThe design of the city plan is uniquely ingenious. The city is in the form of a human body, framed by the inner fortification which is now seen in the shape of a square (a rectangular originally).The outer fortification in the east and south is in an oblong shape symbolizing the human stomach. The city thus has the head, the hands, the feet, the back, the stomach, as well as the navel. The navel located in the central part of the city is where the soul or the spirit of the city resides.\n\nThe city plans takes into account the cardinal directions, calculated according to the knowledge of astrology and in accordance with the exact planned hour, date, month, and year, designated as the auspicious time of the \"birth\" of the city to ensure the success and victory of the city foundation. Each direction of Chiang Mai City is, according to some scholastic studies, designated with the “Taksa” calculated according to the astrological theories, and important temples are planned and constructed in accordance with the Taksa. (see the chart showing the cardinal directions and temples of Chiang Mai, studied and interpreted by Surasawadi Ongsakul and team).\n\nThe concept of the city plan representing the anatomy of the human being, which in the Tai beliefs, has a hierarchy, thus cleverly and logically determines the land use and the zoning, both within the city walls and immediately outside the city proper. Land use in and outside the walled city of Chiang Mai is also creative and visionary, as it takes advantage of the topography of the area, combined with the traditional knowledge and the local beliefs which in those days were widely accepted and thus avoiding the land use conflicts among the various groups of the population.\n\nCriterion (iii): The nominated serial properties collectively bear an exceptional testimony to a civilization that is still living and is known until today as the \"Lanna civilization\".\n\nThis civilization emerged in the 13th century with the independent establishment of the various Tai ethnic and linguistic kingdoms and townships in the northern region of Thailand and their subsequent consolidation and unification under the suzerainty of the Lanna kingdom led by King Mangrai.\n\nThe Lanna civilization manifests itself in various forms, layers and dimensions. It may be considered as being largely a Buddhist civilization, with over 300 Buddhist temples in Chiang Mai alone, but it also contains many significant elements of nature worships and spirit worships. It encompasses various traditions and cultures of many ethnic peoples who inhabit the region. In all consideration, connectivity with nature and living in harmony with all the natural and supernatural elements lie at the very core of Lanna civilization.\n\nAt the time of its height, Lanna civilization is represented not only by the religious arts and architecture, but also the sophisticated system of knowledge in natural sciences and medicine, and various fields of technology, especially the metal and gold technology used for architectural adornment called \" Thong Jung Go\" (see photo), the textile arts and crafts of the various ethnic peoples, wood and bamboo technology, law, as well as language and literature.\n\nLanna civilization developed and prospered in many stages in different historical periods. From its defining and rising era of Mangrai, the Lanna culture and technology combined the traditions and beliefs of the indigenous Lua or Lawa, with those of the diverse Tai groups, and also added some of the elements of the Mon civilization of Hariphunchai and the civilization of Sukhothai. The Lanna civilization encompassed the knowledge systems in various fields of tangible and intangible culture, practiced widely by the royalty and noblemen, monks and learned scholars, and well community leaders and community members.\n\nThe various aspects of cultures and traditions of Lanna were transmitted over many successive generations among various levels of communities within the geographical region known as the \"Lanna Region\" and were further developed until they reached their peak during the era known as the \"golden age of Lanna\". By that time, this civilization in its various elements, aspects and dimensions, had extended their influences over a greater area of Lanna region.\n\nThe Lanna civilization weakened, later stagnated, and declined for 200 years during the Burmese occupation and during the wars to drive them away. This period was followed by a dormant and fragmentation period when the population dispersed and migrated to escape the wars.\n\nThe civilization was revived by King Kawila of Choa Chet Ton House who reestablished Chiang Mai as the center of Lanna, mobilized peoples from various ethnic groups and tribes to live together in the old city area and the environs, and gradually regained its former influences over the neighboring states.\n\nToday, Lanna civilization is still a living civilization. It has been remarkably thriving in the modern era. Though the Lanna dynasty as the center of the ruling system has ceased to exist since the advent of democracy and constitutional monarchy in Siam or Thailand in 1932, yet the cultures, traditions and the lifestyles of Lanna still continued to be safeguarded and practiced by the communities and families both at the regional, local and village levels.\n\nAt present, Lanna civilization seemed to have suffered a setback from rapid and uncontrolled urbanization, encroachment by modern built structures, the deforestation and disconnectedness with nature, and the changing natural and cultural landscape of the old city of Chiang Mai and its environs.Recent emigrants and the increased number of tourists who invaded the city area and the cultural zones of Chiang Mai have also caused serious concern regarding the “carrying capacity” of Chiang Mai. In the face of this rapid globalization, however, there are many conservation efforts spearheaded by many small groups of people, young and old.Many of these groups are temple-based or community-based, such as \"Wat Ket Museum Community\" and \"Wat Prathat Doi Saket Cultural Community\", who are working rather quietly to maintain local museums, supporting community networks, and volunteering to organize cultural and religious festivals and creative events.\n\nChiang Mai has been the seat of learning in various fields from the ancient time. Today, schools and colleges are teaching local language and literature, Lanna music and dance, and other arts and crafts as part of the 30 percent local curriculum allowed by the ministry of culture, or as extracurricular activities and according to the interests of the learners. Many academics and university scholars have also conducted research, helped repair and restore art treasures in the temples, and published their work about many aspects of Chiang Mai and Lanna heritage, tangible and intangible. In addition, a number of the local and NGOs, such as the \" Love Chiang Mai Group\" and Love Mae Ping Group\" have been active and vocal about many conservation programs and in safeguarding cultural heritage.\n\nPublic social education and cultural exchanges have recently been promoted by the local municipalities, temples, schools, and communities. Walking streets, handicrafts bazaars, art galleries, which exhibit various elements of Lanna civilization, have become very fashionable and popular spaces for the various ethnic cultures and for international interchanges.\n\nCriterion (ii): The nominated serial properties collectively exhibit an important interchange of human values, over different periods covering a span of more than 700 years, within a particular cultural area known, since the 12-13th century, as Lanna region.\n\nThese interchanges of values are also extended to interchanging with the peoples and communities in the areas outside of Lanna, through migrations, trades, wars, and diplomacy, located in a particular area in Southeast Asia. The interchanges of values, made since ancient times through blood relations and kinship, linguistic roots, common oral and written traditions, political alliances, marriages, wars, and trades, also continued in similar ways in modern times while many new forms of interchanges also occurred.\n\nThe interchanges of values throughout the pre- modern history started with the mixing and combining the diverse elements of pluralism in cultures and traditions of Tai states and the indigenous groups. Later, the interchanges are significantly manifested in the numerous forms and styles of architecture and arts, particularly the splendidly glorious Lanna style Buddhist arts and architecture, with evidences and traces of influences from the Mon civilization of Haripunchai, the Sukhothai civilization which in turn received influences from The Lankan (Sri Lanka) school of Buddhism, the Burmese Buddhist architecture and arts, as well as the arts and architecture of the small Tai townships in the area, such as Chiangsaen, Chiangrai, Chiangtung.\n\nThe innumerable ancient Buddhist monuments of Chiang Mai, 37 temples within the fortified city, were built in different periods, and exhibit differentiated technical and artistic styles. They were to a large extent preserved and renovated by various Kings from the Mangrai dynasty and throughout the rebirth periods under Kawila and Choa Chet Ton Dynasty.\n\nIn modern period, especially in the reform period initiated by King Chulalongkorn of Bangkok, the city of Chiang Mai opened up to modernization, technological development, global trades and industry which led to many changes in the housing styles, modes of life, and dynamic urbanization. Cultural and religious diversity also took on another dimension with the 1878 Edict of Religious Toleration proclaimed by King Chulalongkorn paving the way to the migrations and settlements of the Chinese Muslim merchants from Yunnan, the Christian missionaries, and the Muslim communities from Pakistan and Bangladesh whose heritages have been preserved within their respective communities and now recognized as being part of the Chiang Mai’s overall heritage.\n\nThe Christian missionaries\n\nDr McGilvary and his wife were the first missionaries to arrive in Chiang Mai on a steamboat from Bangkok obtained an audience with Choa Kawilorot of Chiang Mai and soon were allowed to settle at a site given to them by the Kawilorot family which is today the location of Chiang Mai First Church. (See photos). They started dispensing medications, introducing quinine and vaccination against smallpox.\n\nThey were followed by other Presbyterian missionaries many of whom medical doctors. In the 1880’s, McCormick hospital was founded as a dispensary center providing medicines to the elderly with a small number of beds. In 1920, new buildings were built at the present location with funds donated by Mrs. Cyrus McCormick. Here, Prince Mahidol, the Father of the present King Bhumibol and the Father of Thai modern medicine, came to work as a residency physician, until he became ill and passed away untimely in Bangkok.\n\nOn March 19, 1887, \"Chiang Mai Boys’ School”, the first boys’ school in Northern Thailand was founded and soon outgrew its facilities. Funds were raised internationally to purchase the land and to construct the school buildings. On January 2, 1906, His Royal Highness, Crown Prince Maha Vajiravudh, Son of King Chulalongkorn, came to lay the cornerstone for the first building. The school was then renamed The Prince Royal’s College. In 1878, the first school for girl was established and later renamed \"Phra Racha Chaya Girls' School\" ( after Phra Racha Chaya, Princess Dara Rasmi, King Chulalongkorn's Chiang Mai- born consort ), now known as \"Dara Academy\".\n\nThe Muslim community\n\nDuring the course of the 19th century, Chiang Mai saw many waves of migration of the Bengali from India via Burma, the Hui Muslim refugees from Yunan, China known locally as \"Chin-Haw\", and resettlement of the Malay Muslim from the South.\n\nThe Muslim population of Chiang Mai, though not very large, is diverse and identifiable by their mosques, halal restaurants, and the people's styles of clothing. Two of these areas (Chang Pheuak and South Changklan) are predominantly Bengali, or South Asian in character. Cattle traders operating out of Moulmein had originally migrated to Burma from the Chittagong area of Bangladesh, and are first reported to have settled in Chiang Mai as early as 1830.\n\nThe two others (Baan Haw and Sanphakoi) are predominantly Yunnanese, known locally as \"Chin-Haw\", and settled in and around upper Changklan Road in an area still known as \"Ban Haw\". The Haw caravans coming to Thailand from Yunnan increased in number in the 19th century as recorded by Western travelers and missionaries who were also moving around the region during that time. In the latter half of the twentieth century, many Yunnanese Muslims fled to Chiang Mai and other nearby towns from China via Myanmar to escape the political turmoil, war and civil war and the community of the Baan Ho mosque increased rapidly.\n\nThe three groups mixed and intermarried with one another as well as with the local Thai community resulting in their adoption to a good extent of the Lanna Thai language and non religious cultural traditions. The Baan Haw mosque and market space, and the Chang Klan Muslim quarters are the oldest Muslim communities which not only offer glimpses into the Muslim ways of life but also cater Muslim food of a great variety.\n\nThe Chinese Community\n\nThe Chinese non muslim communities probably first came to settle in Chiang Mai during the Ayutthya period and increasingly in the Thonburi and early Bangkok periods. During King Chulalongkorn's reign, a new flux of Chinese migrants came. Some members of the Chinese emigrants soon played important role in trading and tax collection for the King of Chiang Mai and were granted land rights near the market resulting in the emergence of new architectural and artistic styles in some areas of the city. \"Pung Tao Gong Ancestral Temple\" is Chiang Mai's oldest Chinese temple. The original main building, built in 1876 in King Chulalongkorn's time, was badly deteriorated and was recently reconstructed with the funds donated by the Chinese community to celebrate the 700th anniversary of Chiang Mai as a city in 1998.\n\nCriterion (vi): The monuments and sites selected for the serial nomination are also tangibly associated with many ceremonies, celebrations, festivals and other traditions organized by temples and communities on a regular basis.\n\nMany of the ceremonies and celebrations are Buddhist traditions which have been practiced for more than 2000 years by the Buddhist communities all over the world and therefore testify to their outstanding universal values.\n\nMany of them however are traditional Lanna events rooted in the sense of humility in the face of the unseen power and force of nature, as well as the beliefs in the world after death. These beliefs are unique but also universal, and are held on a monthly basis all year round, for example:\n\n1. Ceremony of the 7th month (April). This is the New Year Festival according to the Lunar Calendar and is celebrated at home, in the family, as well as at the temple and the community.\n\n2. Ceremony of the 8th month (May). This is the time for ordination of monks and paying homage to the Sacred Buddha's Relic as well as giving offering to the guardian spirits of the city to extend the days of prosperity.\n\n3. Ceremony of the 9th month (June) to give offerings to the ancestors (on the mother's side), clean the streams and rivers, and prepare for paddy cultivation.\n\n4. Ceremony of the 10th month (July) to mark the beginning of the Buddhist Lent, observed since Buddha's time.\n\n5. Ceremony of the 11th month (August) to observe the 8 precepts, and to pay gratitude to the buffalos that have worked hard in the rice fields, and to pay respect to the Mae Posop, the Goddess of Rice.\n\n6. Ceremony of the 12th month (September), to give alms to the poor and the elderly and donation to the temples.\n\n7. Ceremony of the first month (October) to mark the end of the Buddhist Lent to present the yellow Kathincloth to the monks.\n\n8. Ceremony of the second month (November), held on the full moon, to float away the misfortune and to listen to the sermon on the ten lives of Buddha.\n\nConclusion\n\nChiang Mai is not an ancient urban city frozen in time. Its values do not stop at any epoch in the past centuries. Though a masterpiece product of human creative genius of the late 13th century, Chiang Mai thrives on, and today is a rare and unique city in the world that has been continuously inhabited by diverse groups of population whose traditions and cultures have been combined and blended into a rich living civilization for as long as 700 years.\n\nToday, many of Chiang Mai's ancient sites, monuments and Buddhist temples have been completely restored, some might have been \"made over\" in different historical periods and in modern time, so that they would not look like sad remnants of the past, but to function as a living heritage that continue to serve its people in many of the traditional ways of the past, but also in the context of the contemporary society.\n\nToday, the continuously restored city of Chiang Mai proudly exhibits its entire and unique fortification system of inner and outer walls and moats, the beautifully renovated temples located not only in the astrologically calculated cardinal directions, but dotting the city inside and outside supported by the surrounding communities, the spaces in the city center and in many the social and cultural areas have been recently cleaned up and reconstruct in respect of the old city plan. Though constrained and congested by modern urbanization and the influx of migrants and tourists, and overwhelmed by exuberant modern activities, the Chiang Mai historical monuments, sites, and cultural landscape are being safeguarded and still serve the multi purposes for the promotion of social and cultural identity, for educational and value transmission, and for the enhancement of the city's outstanding universal values."
