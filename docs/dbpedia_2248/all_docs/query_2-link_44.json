        "text": "The Filipino-American Thrash Metal band Death Angel performed a sold-out and energy-filled concert at The Zoo in Osborne Village on April 15. Despite its long absence in the music scene, Death Angel obviously still has many supporters, as evidensed by the considerable number of metalheads in the audience who sang along especially with songs from the band’s debut album, The Ultra-Violence. Death Angel hails from Concord, California, United States. The band was active from 1982 to 1991 and again since 2001. Current lineup are the remaining original member Rob Cavestany (guitars / backing vocals) and Mark Osegueda (vocals), Ted Aguilar (guitars), Damien Sisson (bass), and Will Carrol (drums). Death Angel has six studio albums to its credit: The Ultra-Violence (1987), Frolic through the Park (1988), Act III (1990), The Art of Dying (2004), Killing Season (2008), and Relentless Retribution (2010). The Winnipeg show was the last leg of Death Angel’s North American tour. The band was set to perform again in the Philippines; the last time the band played there was in 2007, when they headlined the 7th Pulp Summer Slam.
