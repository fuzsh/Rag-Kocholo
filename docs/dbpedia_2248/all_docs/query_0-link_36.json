'67, Posthumously, Aquinas College Historical Commission Hall of Fame\n\nIn 1974 Sister Phyllis was called to be director of eleven Sisters under final vows who were missioned in western Michigan. She was also guest-mistress at Marywood, artist in residence, and assistant with secretarial work in the central office. She enjoyed designing brochures, flyers, and holiday greeting cards. She continued taking classes in the evening and summers and earned an MA degree in religious studies in 1982. She also accompanied Sister Amata Fabbro on a trip to Israel. At the age of fifty-five, Sister Phyllis requested and received permission to study art at Aquinas College, which by then had a four-year BFA program. Her sculpture instructor, Ron Pederson, recognized her natural talent in sculpture and advised her to make that her major. In her third and fourth years, she was his assistant. Then she accepted a commission to sculpt a life-size image of St. Thomas Aquinas, which she completed in 1989. This beautiful sculpture graces the entry of the main Academic Building on the Aquinas College campus.\n\nSister Phyllis will be remembered for her prayerful life, her gentle demeanor, and her works of art which were both vibrant and clear; symbolic and abstract. In life, and now in her new life, she was, and is, truly God’s beautiful handiwork – as her favorite Scripture passage foretold.\n\nMichael C. Keller, Vice President Emeritus, Aquinas College Historical Commission Hall of Fame\n\nMichael Keller was born and raised in Maine, attending Erskine Academy where he was recognized with the Distinguished Alumni Award.

She attended the same one-room country school as her Dad followed by high school in Midland. She met the Grand Rapids Dominican Sisters during her time at Aquinas College. She thought she was doing something for God when she entered religious life but then came to realize God was doing something for her. Religious life has been God’s gift to her along with the precious gift of family. She loved her years of teaching both high school and college. She had the opportunity to teach for about 40 years in the mathematics department at Aquinas and continues to connect with college students as a mathematics tutor and share her faith through Advent and Lenten Retreats.

He chaired the Chemistry Department for more than a decade and established a reputation for producing qualified and motivated scientists.\n\nScience students, golf, and all things Notre Dame were three of the corner legs of Dick’s life.
