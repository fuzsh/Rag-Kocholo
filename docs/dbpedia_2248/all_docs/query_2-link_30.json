        "text": "Born and raised smack dab in the middle of one of the most exciting musical movements of the last 50 years, the Bay Area quintet known as Death Angel are a unique band in a very unique position. They’re a band with an entire history behind them, yet their present and future mirrors that of a new band just starting out. Death Angel formed in 1982 and instantly made waves with their ages and backgrounds. As with any band looking to make their mark, Death Angel had the blessing/curse of forming their band with several intangibles, a few of those being each member was of Filipino descent and were cousins by birth, adding to all of that, the average age of the band was about 14/15. After a few demo tapes, including the infamous “Kill As One” cassette produced by Metallica’s Kirk Hammett Death Angel released their 1987 debut, ‘The Ultra-Violence’ on Enigma Records and wrote, recorded and toured two more releases before going on hiatus in 1991. Ten years later, in 2001 the band reunited at the “Thrash of the Titans” benefit show and since then they have remained extremely active both recording and touring the World. Over the years there have been a few member changes but each move has only strengthened the band and their resolve. We caught up with the guys on the road in support of album number eight, 2016’s ‘The Evil Divide’ (Nuclear Blast).\n\nFret Twelve welcomes Death Angel Lead Guitarist/Co-Founder Rob Cavestany and Rhythm Guitarist Ted Aguilar to ‘The Sound and the Story.’"
