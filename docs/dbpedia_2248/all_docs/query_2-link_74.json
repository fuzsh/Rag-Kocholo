        "text": "NEW YORK — It’s been quite an eventful summer for Luis Rengifo.\n\nThe Angels announced after Tuesday’s game against the New York Yankees was rained out that Rengifo underwent right wrist surgery, ending his season. The Angels did not release the exact type of surgery, but Rengifo is expected to be ready to by the start of spring training.\n\nRengifo, 27, was in the midst of an All-Star-caliber season when he first hurt his right wrist on July 3 in Oakland.\n\nHe spent about three weeks on the injured list and then returned to action, without a rehab assignment, only to hit .188 in his next 35 plate appearances.\n\nThat included two times when Rengifo had to leave games because he aggravated the wrist injury. After the second time, on Friday night, the Angels placed him on the injured list again and sent him for more tests, which revealed that he needed surgery.\n\nAmid all of that, Rengifo was considered one of the Angels’ better trade chips, not only because of the strong season he was having but also because he is under team control for another season.\n\nGeneral Manager Perry Minasian, without speaking specifically about Rengifo, said last week the Angels were open to trading more players on the roster than the two relievers they ultimately moved, but the offers weren’t sufficient.\n\nIt is likely that the teams that would have had interest in Rengifo cooled on him because of questions about his wrist. Even after he was activated, he didn’t hit well, which raised the question of whether he was fully recovered.\n\nWhat happened subsequently certainly suggests that he might not have been.\n\nThe Angels could still trade Rengifo over the winter or even at next year’s deadline. Or they could sign him to an extension and make him part of the long-term solution.\n\nRengifo finished the season with a .300 batting average, six home runs and a .763 OPS.\n\nSILSETH TOO\n\nRight-hander Chase Silseth also underwent season-ending elbow surgery, although he’s expected to be ready for the start of spring training.\n\nThe Angels did not reveal details of Silseth’s surgery beyond a clarification that it will not interfere with next season, which rules out Tommy John surgery.\n\nSilseth, 24, began the season in the Angels’ rotation, but pitched just two games before suffering an elbow injury. He returned to action in late May and had pitched 28⅓ innings in seven games at Triple-A, with a 6.35 ERA.\n\nHe last pitched on July 28, going for tests on his elbow a few days later.\n\nRAINED OUT\n\nThe Angels’ game against the Yankees was postponed more than three hours before the scheduled first pitch. It will be made up on Wednesday as part of a traditional doubleheader, with the first game starting at 1:05 p.m. PT.\n\nRight-hander Davis Daniel will start the first game, followed by right-hander Carson Fulmer in the second game.\n\nAssuming the rest of the trip goes without further interruptions – not a certainty, considering Hurricane Debby’s impact on the East Coast – the Angels will need a sixth starter for the final game of the trip, on Sunday in Washington.\n\nNOTES\n\nThe Angels activated third baseman Anthony Rendon, who missed the minimum 10 days on the injured list because of back stiffness. Rendon replaced Taylor Ward, who was placed on the paternity list. …\n\nThe Angels will be able to add a 27th player for Wednesday’s doubleheader. …\n\nRight-hander José Cisnero, who has been out since April because of shoulder and back problems, began a rehab assignment at Triple-A Salt Lake on Tuesday. …\n\nMike Trout has not yet had his second meniscus surgery. The Angels announced last week that he would be having a second procedure, ending his season.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nAngels (RHP Davis Daniel, 1-2, 4.91 ERA and RHP Carson Fulmer, 0-2, 3.69) at Yankees (RHP Luis Gil, 11-5, 3.20 and RHP Will Warren, 0-0, 6.75), Wednesday, first game at 1:05 p.m. PT, Bally Sports West, 830 AM"
