        "text": "(Gray News) - Aerosmith is officially retiring from touring, the band announced on Friday.\n\nAccording to a statement released on social media, the group has decided to cancel the rest of their touring dates as Steven Tyler continues to try and recover from a vocal injury he suffered last year.\n\n“Steven’s voice is an instrument like no other. He has spent months tirelessly working on getting his voice to where it was before his injury,” the band shared. “We’ve seen him struggling despite having the best medical team by his side. Sadly, it is clear, that a full recovery from his vocal injury is not possible.”\n\nThe band members went on to say they had made the tough decision to retire from touring.\n\n“We have made a heartbreaking and difficult, but necessary, decision — as a band of brothers — to retire from the touring stage,” the statement read.\n\nThe band said fans who have purchased tickets for upcoming shows through Ticketmaster would be automatically refunded. Fans who purchased tickets through other sites are instructed to contact those companies directly.\n\nAerosmith began in 1970. The band was formed by frontman Tyler, guitarists Joe Perry and Ray Tabano, bassist Tom Hamilton and drummer Joey Kramer.\n\nAerosmith announced its latest tour -- Peace Out: The Farewell Tour -- in May of 2023 but has played just three shows before pushing dates back since Tyler’s injury.\n\nLast September, the band shared Tyler, now 76, had fractured his larynx, causing the band to postpone the rest of the year’s dates.\n\nIn April, the band announced rescheduled tour dates, which were scheduled to begin in September and run through February 2025.\n\n“We are grateful beyond words for everyone who was pumped to get on the road with us one last time,” Aerosmith shared. “A final thank you to you - the best fans on planet Earth. Play our music loud, now and always. Dream On. You’ve made our dreams come true.”"
