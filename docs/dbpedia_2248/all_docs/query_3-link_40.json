        "text": "Description\n\n2nd c.d. from this modern sounding band, that derives from the Thrash Metal band, Death Angel. Very good stuff, on Bulletproof / Music For Nations.\n\nExcellent! This group was very under appreciated! All they are is Death Angel without Mark!\n\nThe Organization – Savor the Flavor 1995\n\nLabel: Bullet Proof Records – CDVEST 50\n\nFormat: CD, Album\n\nCountry: UK\n\nReleased: 1995\n\nStyle: Funk Metal, Hard Rock\n\n1. “Savor the Flavor” (2:37)\n\n2. “So Full of Lies” (4:31)\n\n3. “Doomsday Eve” (3:37)\n\n4. “A Way Today” (3:50)\n\n5. “Had A Long Today” (4:18)\n\n6. “The Chase” (3:17)\n\n7. “War 25” (4:05)\n\n8. “Begin A Life” (2:35)\n\n9. “The Drought” (2:13)\n\n10. “Insomnia” (3:05)\n\n11. “Stupid Mood” (2:59)\n\n12. “By the Time” (9:41)\n\nThis video explains the story of the band:\n\nSurprisingly Obscure\n\noccasionally you get an obscure band that really deserves a lot more credit than they get. This is one of them.\n\nThis album sounds like a cross of 80s metal and the Red Hot Chili Peppers. It has great power chords, good lyrics, and at times, that funk-rock sound that the Red Hot Chili Peppers have.\n\nThere really isn’t a lot more for me to say about this album, except that it rocks. If you like Queensryche, Red Hot Chili Peppers, or other 80s heavy metal, then buy this album. You won’t be disappointed.\n\n———————————————————–"
