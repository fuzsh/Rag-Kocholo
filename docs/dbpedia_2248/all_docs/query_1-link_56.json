        "text": "Death Angel drummer Will Carroll has been hospitalized and is “very ill,” likely due to the coronavirus.\n\nExodus/ Slayer guitarist Gary Holt shared the news on social media:\n\n“I remained quiet on this earlier, not wanting to say anything until I was certain it had become public knowledge, but Will Carroll is in need of some massive positive vibes. Me, I appreciate all the warm wishes I’ve gotten, but I’m sick, nothing more, Will is in the ICU. WAY worse that anything I’m dealing with, by a long shot. Not even close. He is very ill. There are several of us that have symptoms and are waiting for test results. Will needs some healing vibes from everyone.”\n\nLambgoat reports that when one of Holt’s followers left a comment asking if Carroll was suffering from COVID-19, the guitarist replied, “Test results coming soon but pretty sure that’s what it is.”\n\nMetalSucks wishes Carroll a speedy recovery."
