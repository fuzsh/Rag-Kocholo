        "text": "Fan Reviews\n\nGeorge\n\nJune 19th 2023\n\nThe concert was a loud and great show even if all of the bands that were first showcased as the opening acts did not appear on this night. The 2 opening acts was ok but I still wanted to see Kreator.\n\nAlbuquerque, NM@\n\nLaunchpad\n\nShaun\n\nJune 15th 2023\n\nI am lucky enough to see Death Angel on a couple of occasions, only in the opening band designation, but they were always excellent and always motivating. The band has never wavered in adversity regarding their lyrical content and in sound. This show would be my second in a month in the Pittsburgh area. The first show they played as an opener, and I believe seven tunes and were simply great. In this show, they headlined, and I witnessed an effort that was simply phenominal. They played fourteen songs, and the end both the band and the fans were exhausted in mutual participation because expectations were easily surpassed as they finished the opening tune. I am still in awe of their stage presence and the ability to instantly motivate us. For me, personally, it was a bucket list type performance that one could only hope for because I do not think that it can be topped. Thank you, Death Angel.\n\nPittsburgh, PA@\n\nThe Crafthouse Stage & Grill\n\nJake B\n\nJune 4th 2023\n\nIt's a crime that Death Angel has such a short time on stage. Always a crowd favorite and amazing at turning the mosh pit up like crazy. All of the other bands were amazing too, especially Sepultura, but Death Angel will always be the reason me and my wife buy tickets to any show they are a part of.\n\nDenver, CO@\n\nOgden Theatre\n\nRita\n\nMay 30th 2023\n\nAll the bands gave an amazing show, full of energy, talent and sounded great. I also applaud the wonderful staff at the Regency Ballroom that made us feel welcome. Thank you for a great night we really appreciate it.\n\nSan Francisco, CA@\n\nThe Regency Ballroom\n\nVicky\n\nMay 30th 2023\n\nDeath Angel gave another GREAT performance , as ALWAYS. They’re ALL great musicians, natural born performers and are as exciting to watch as Led Zeppelin was. Their songs are also top-notch and I will catch them next time at the Great American Music Hall 12/21 and 12/22. They ROCKED the Regency’s RAFTERS to a packed house on fans!\n\nSan Francisco, CA@\n\nThe Regency Ballroom\n\nCharles\n\nMay 19th 2023\n\nAmazing. One of the best shows I've been to. Kreator never disappoints. My first time seeing Death Angel and I wasn't in any way let down. Sepultura was amazing, too. I missed Spiritbox, but that's okay.\n\nCharlotte, NC@\n\nThe Fillmore Charlotte\n\nShaun\n\nMay 18th 2023\n\nI went to this show primarily to see Death Angel and purchased a meet and greet package to see them personally. Every single band member (Rob, Mark, Ted, Damion, and Will) was all present and very receptive and cordial. The guys were very down to earth and talkative. The conversation was very casual, almost as if we had known each other for some time. I believe that it is due to the fact that they love to play heavy metal thrash music, and I love to listen to it. Sometimes, I think it is difficult to explain to the average person who is not familiar with particular music genres, but heavy metal fans and musicians have an admiration of each other due mainly to the fact that the genre has been vilified since its inception as being rude or violent and I believe that it is due to the fact that people do not understand the complexities that we have endured over the latter part of 80s, the 90s, and early 2000s as being of lesser intelligence and the lack of manners, but nothing could be further than the truth. The musicians are very talented and capable of playing fast, technically advanced music, that very few genres (if any) are capable of duplicating. They also have no problem writing lyrical content that may be controversial or rarely discussed, but at the same time are very surreal, real life instances for most and/or have the imaginative/fantasy aspect of song writing that some song writers like to do. The fan base is made up of various types of people from many walks of life and professions. I myself am a retired city police officer who attained a graduate degree in criminal justice administration and have been an associate professor for the past 15 years at a local college. Those of us who who have embraced the genre either realize this or it does not matter, because regardless, we are one in the same... people who have a passion for heavy metal music. I have been to literally around 100 shows or so and can count on one hand how many times that I witnessed violent behavior. Sure, we like to mosh, but to us it is just a sort of release that we all experience, but I can assure you that when one person goes down in the (mosh) pit, there are three to four hands reaching to pick that person up back to their feet. It is a camaraderie that no other genre (at least I believe) can lay claim to or even recognize. I realize that I was a bit long-winded for such a simple question, but it is not often addressed, and our bond comes from being stereotyped and being labeled as miscreatants at times, but that is not the case, but I felt the need to remind people outside the genre that we are fathers, mothers, daughters and sons who happen to be more normal than our true critiques make us out to be in an abnormal world/society. Death Angel and the other bands were excellent, and a good time was had by all. Especially for me meeting the men and women who create the music that I cherish so. Death Angel will be back in Pittsburgh on June 11th, and my tickets were purchased the minute they went on sale. I would like to thank the members of Death Angel for being such very kind hosts, so we could be simply ourselves who enjoyed each others company. Thank you for asking me. Shaun\n\nMcKees Rocks, PA@\n\nRoxian Theatre\n\nDylan\n\nFebruary 4th 2023\n\nDeath Angel was in top top form , band wise & vocally... passionate , creative , totally real , amazing performance , I was fully connected with this show ! one of the best shows ever. I definitively recommend seeing this band asap , wherever you can. Exodus & Testament were amazing as well , & thier performances were also in top form !! Definitely recommend seeing both of those bands asap as well - really amazing performances all around. Also , the venue was really cool.\n\nFort Lauderdale, FL@\n\nRevolution Live\n\nThor\n\nMay 18th 2022\n\nNicest and most down to earth guys. Great set and they nailed every song. Definitely left us wanting more. I was laughing when Mark encouraged the crowd to make security earn their money by crowd surfing! Can’t wait to see them again. 🤘🏻\n\nMinneapolis, MN@\n\nSkyway Theatre\n\nBryan\n\nMay 4th 2022\n\nHouse of Blues is a terrific venue for a show, especially a thrash metal show. All bands were flawless and connected immediately with their fans. Don't miss this show when it comes back to the area in September.\n\nBoston, MA@\n\nHouse Of Blues Boston\n\nMichelle\n\nApril 16th 2022\n\nI really enjoyed Exodus and Testament, however I missed Death Angel completely who started before 7:00 pm, thanks to the incompetence of the House of Blues website that listed 3 other opening bands that were on the original Bay Strikes Back tour, but no longer playing on the rescheduled dates. With everyone spending so much time online, it doesn't seem to be too much to ask that venues update their calendar. Death Angel is one of my favorite bands and I was very disappointed not to see them, but I'll definitely be at the next show! Thanks for nothing HOB.\n\nAnaheim, CA@\n\nHouse of Blues Anaheim\n\nApeontrack\n\nJanuary 25th 2022\n\nCould not wait till another Death Angel Christams show and had to see these guys asap. Very cool set of classic and new. Crowd did not match bands vigor. At one point, Mark asked us to \"stop being a bunch of bitches\". Haha, he was right. ✅\n\nSan Francisco, CA@\n\nGreat American Music Hall\n\nAsh\n\nMarch 16th 2020\n\nKiller show, my brother and I let loose and we actually started the first mosh pit, that was a first for us. I will definitely go see Death Angel again, one of the absolute best Thrash bands in my eyes.\n\nSaint Louis, MO@\n\nDelmar Hall\n\nOliver\n\nFebruary 28th 2020\n\nLlegue un poco tarde no vi casi nada de detah ángel pero lo poco que vi sonando fue bárbaro el mejor sonido de las 3 bandas testament sono bien pero mucho poder para una lugar cerrada.\n\nBarcelona, Spain@\n\nRazzmatazz\n\nCraig\n\nNovember 19th 2019\n\nAll three bands crushed it ! HellFire which I had never heard of was like a 80’s hair band remake. Strong, high pitched vocals and solid musicians. Exmortus shredded the guitars and a SICK rendition of Beethoven as well ! Death Angel is still crushing and sounded awesome !! I started listening to them in 1987.\n\nPortland, OR@\n\nHawthorne Theatre\n\nJustin\n\nMay 20th 2019\n\nMark was possessed by some sort of entity and gave it all like it was his last night on earth. Fucking insane. I haven’t seen energy and presence like that in ages, and I’ve seen them a few times. Amazing night!!\n\nSan Francisco, CA@\n\nDNA Lounge\n\nMike\n\nMay 6th 2019\n\nI love their music. They are so grateful for their loyal fan base. These guys have persevered and continue to be a powerhouse from the original Bay Area metal scene. Supreme performers, supreme show! Thank you for stopping in Milwaukee for all of your fans!\n\nMilwaukee, WI@\n\nThe Rave / Eagles Club\n\nJohn\n\nApril 23rd 2019\n\nDeath Angel was fantastic!!! They came out hard, heavy and fast and didn't let up for over 90 minutes. The new songs off the new album Humanicide take the band to a whole new level!! They are truly ONE of the BEST Thrash Metal band EVER!! Death Angel RULES!!!\n\nColorado Springs, CO@\n\nBlack Sheep\n\nGalen\n\nMay 17th 2017\n\nThe passion the band show, as well as the love for their fans, is unbelievable. Seen these guys twice, and there will be more. But for the love of God play River of Rapture next time will ya?! Warbringer were solid as well.\n\nRotterdam, Netherlands@\n\nBaroeg\n\nFrank\n\nDecember 21st 2016\n\nit was the best possible first show I could have been to!!! many funny and awesome moments such as when the tree branch broke over the mosh pit. overall amazing live sound! wish to see Devil Driver and Death Angel again soon\n\nMcallen, TX@\n\nSofie's Saloon\n\nView More Fan Reviews"
