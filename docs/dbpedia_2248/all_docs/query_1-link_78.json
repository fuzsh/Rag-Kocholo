No life is beyond His reach. Founded in 1976, Prison Fellowship® is the nation’s largest Christian nonprofit equipping the Church to serve currently and formerly incarcerated people and their families, and to advocate for justice and human dignity both inside and outside of prison.\n\nTRANSFORMING THE LIVES OF PRISONERS\n\nPrison Fellowship staff and volunteers run events and programs in correctional facilities across the country, sharing the Gospel and spreading hope to incarcerated men and women.\n\nCARING FOR CHILDREN AND FAMILIES\n\nThrough Prison Fellowship Angel Tree, churches help support the families of prisoners year-round through delivering Christmas gifts on behalf of incarcerated parents, sending kids to summer camp, facilitating one-day sports camps, and more.\n\nADVOCATING FOR JUSTICE THAT RESTORES\n\nPrison Fellowship advocates for a more restorative approach to justice that advances proportional punishment, constructive corrections culture, and second chances.\n\nRESTORING HOPE FOR MORE THAN FOUR DECADES\n\nMen and women behind bars, victims of crime, families torn apart by incarceration—all are loved by God and worthy of our attention. There is always hope. Together, we strive to make prisons safer and more rehabilitative, advance criminal justice reforms, and help all those affected by crime to heal and flourish.\n\nLET'S REPLACE THE CYCLE OF CRIME WITH A CYCLE OF RENEWAL\n\nPrison Fellowship's amazing volunteers and supporters are making this possible each and every day. Will you join us as we help prisoners find a new life path, care for families with incarcerated loved ones, and give former prisoners a second chance?"
