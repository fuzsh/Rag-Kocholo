        "text": "This answer may not be the traditional interpretation, but is forwarded for consideration. Some may think that a loving God would kill [innocent] first born, but, its mostly those who are persuaded by doctrine, particularly the doctrine of sovereignty, that could ‘see’ this, and then apologetically argue for it.\n\nWhat they fail to understand is the principle of the firstborn. I could provide clear argument for this, but it’s outside of what’s needed for this question. Briefly, Satan had a ‘claim’ [right over] on the firstborn. If you look, you can see this right from Genesis. For example, Isaac had to be the second born!. (Would love to exegete this, but not needed for this Q). And, here, when the children of Israel were about to be let go, Satan was claiming the firstborn - but - that judgement would be taken by Jesus, as symbolised by the Passover.\n\nThe issue is, these were Gods children, his nation, and the firstborn of his people were His, not the Egyptian gods, nor Satan’s, but, they needed to be reclaimed, which had not yet been put in place.\n\nThe destroyer angel was not from God. God [had to] allow it. In Hebrew ‘thinking’, if God allowed something, then it was as if God Himself did it - that is, their understanding of sovereignty! That’s how they articulate this.\n\nLeviticus (and in Exodus 34:20) outlines specifically how the firstborn was to be ‘reclaimed’ back to God. (Until the cross).\n\nAppreciate this answer may provoke some, but it had to be outlined in order to present an alternative view of God."
