        "text": "When David Vincent left Morbid Angel in 1996, the future of the band seemed shaky. David had been in the band since the release of \"Thy Kingdom Come\" in 1987, and was a vital member in the last four albums. What will the band do without him? Well, in 1997, Steve Tucker joined the band as the new vocalist, and the year after, they released a new album titled \"Formulas Fatal to the Flesh\". That's good and all, but how does this album stack up to the previous releases? And is it any good, even without Vincent's vocals?\n\nTo find that out, we'd have to check out the instrumentals first. The opening track \"Heaving Earth\" does seem like it's gonna continue right where Domination left off. The guitar still continue to play some technical riffs, though its composition is a lot more intense than on the last album. It's the same thing with the drums, as its blastbeats are more chaotic and extreme, and the beatings have a lot more power in them compared to the last record. Even the bass is fantastic, as its bass play follows the guitar riffs well and maintains a good foundation in the track. The overall atmosphere in this track is more intense and crazed than on the last album, and it works well on this first track. Other amazing instrumentals include \"Prayer of Hatred\", \"Nothing is Not\", and especially the nine minute epic \"Invocation of the Continual One\". That track in particular is nothing but technical and intense OSDM riffs that make you feel a bit spaced out. And that's not even counting those ambient tracks in the last portion of the album, which sound dark and ritualistic, fitting to the metal track's atmosphere. Instrumental-wise, it's still very good, as the guitar riffs and blastbeats and intensified to play some crazy moments.\n\nBut then we get to the instrumentals. With Steve Tucker leading the vocals, he does a decent job overall, but far from being on Vincent's level. To see what I mean, let's check out the track \"Umulamahri\". Steve goes for some similar growls, but he also incorporates some high-pitched demonic vocals as well. I guess he was going for more of a Deicide-influenced vocal performance, which does work in tracks like \"Heaving Earth\". In this track, however, the demonic vocals sounds more distorted and weird, which doesn't make the instrumentals any more intense. Not only that, but there are a couple of moments where Steve's vocals feel weaker and don't impact the instrumentals as much. Steve's vocals aren't terrible per say, and in some tracks, they're really good. However, in other tracks, they don't feel as good.\n\nRegardless of some occasional weak vocal performances, this album is still a beast overall. The guitar riffs are faster and more intense than before, the drumming beats crazy and sound maddening, and the ambient tracks on here are also not so bad either. It might not be the band's best album, but for an introduction to a new vocalist, I think this album is a fantastic start.\n\nGive everyone their due: this here is definitely intense. At least at first, before the initial effect and hopeful expectations wear off and the facade drops. The album is filled with furious blast beats and excellent drums overall, solid guitar work and real vocal presence from Tucker whose charismatic style fits the abrasive instrumentals. One could say it generally sounds mighty, however the problem seems to be more with the inspiration in song-writing. The band were definitely experimenting here after their previous seminal death metal records, where they might've felt like they needed to renew their sound and thus move on as artists. But it genuinely feels like they compromise the quality of the music by pulling in too many different directions and failing to capitalize on excelling in any one aspect. 'Covenant' was great, in part, by being utterly in control of its own destiny and by displaying great maturity in grasping fully what the musical concept was; to the point for example of producing an outrageously experimental and uniquely unorthodox piece of music like 'God of Emptiness', showing their command and confidence in their craft.\n\n'Formulas' here sounds like just solidly executed Morbid Angel death metal instead. And not a whole lot more. There are no bad riffs, or few at least, but conversely also few excellent riffs that stand out. It's consistent material, but not consistently great. Heads down, angry Morbid Angel death metal. It's better than the average death metal record as most fans would agree, but seems to lack an edge like all of its predecessors had. It feels like one more album added to the discography, like it's just the next chapter but it hasn't added enough novelty or quality, or perhaps even effort, to make it nearly as iconic. Some tracks like 'Nothing is Not' in particular are trademark Morbid Angel, or the instrumental 'Ascent through the Spheres' really adds shine to the album as well as the (other short instrumental) eerie-sounding 'Disturbance in the Great Slumber'.\n\nThere are also too many tracks on here, which only dilutes the quality overall. There's a feeling of filler content during quite a few moments as many of the sections past a certain point on the album feel innocuous, like too little is happening - again not bad just average semi-inspired Morbid Angel material. That special sort of magic that had set them apart from the rest of the scene is no longer there. It would be difficult to argue this album possesses much of a mystique to it the same way all the previous ones did. This could've easily been so much darker in attempting to explore the depths of their sound instead of tossing generic Morbid Angel death metal the fans' way. It really feels at times like many of the songs were conceived on one basic template with erratic blasts followed by a slower groove, and like the riffs are interchangeable between the tracks.\n\nMorbid Angel would never return to their form of their early days starting from this point on. It's unfortunate; this being one of the genre's all-time absolute heavy weights; but their best was so clearly behind them after their third album only. Azagthoth was as brilliant a death metal composer as the world has ever seen to this day, but what was once profuse creativity quickly turned into muddy, messy experimentation and the man seemed to have lost his genius and ultimately, the plot.\n\nAnnable Courts - http://antichristmagazine.com/review-morbid-angel-formulas-fatal-to-the-flesh-earache-records/\n\nFormulas Fatal to the Flesh is Morbid Angel’s fifth album, and for many, represents a significant drop off in quality. However, Morbid Angel (essentially just Trey Azagthoth and Pete Sandoval) actually managed to reach their musical peak on this album. Despite the loss of Rutan and Vincent, and the introduction of new vocalist Steve Tucker, Morbid Angel managed to push the boundaries of death metal into both faster and groovier territories.\n\nLet’s begin with the guitar. Morbid Angel, being a primarily guitar driven band, depends on their riffs to make their music any good. If they had a less competent guitarist, their band would be stuck in the gutter. Thankfully, they have Trey Azagthoth, who essentially commandeers the whole band to make what amounts to his solo album with this release. Boy does Trey deliver. The riffs and solos of this album are some of the best of their career, having both the signature tremolo picking that Trey is known for, while also having a choice selection of some of their most head-bangable riffs. The faster, more traditional tremolo riffs are dominant in songs such as “Heaving Earth”, “Chambers of Dis”, and “Hellspawn: The Rebirth” (a rerecording from Abominations of Desolation). Though these songs are wonderful listens, it is the songs with slower sections that truly shine. On this album, Morbid Angel finally masters the art of making mid-tempo riffs that start circle pits. Songs like “Prayer of Hatred”, “Nothing is Not”, “Umulamahri”, and “Covenant of Death” show these slow riffs in their finest form. In addition to the great riffs though, Formulas has some more mellow ambient guitar passages on their songs like on “Invocation of the Continual One” and “Covenant of Death” Moving on to solos, we find what is undoubtedly (along with Heretic) the best collection of Trey Azagthoth solos that metal has ever seen. There is no melodic Erik Rutan on this album to balance him out in any way, so Trey shreds away in his traditional, chromatic way with nothing to stop him, and, for as much as I love Rutan’s solos, that’s ok. Overall, the riffs are staggered in a way such that the tempo changes are jarring, which is impressive from a technical standpoint, but it also presents ample opportunities for headbanging.\n\nNext up for our analysis is drums. This is probably one of Pete Sandoval’s best drum performances (alongside Heretic). Not only does he blast away in the background as usual, he also puts in some pretty decent fills. Though they are pretty standard death metal fare, and only slightly above average, the fact that he is putting in more fills, along with his awesome blast beats is really raising the bar for Morbid Angel. The best example of this is the song “Umulamahri”, which is positively filled with fills.\n\nFinally, we have vocals and bass. Steve Tucker’s vocals are not David Vincent’s, but still hold their own. To put it bluntly, Steve Tucker (as far as we know) is not as good of a singer as Vincent, whose vocals are far more dynamic, and much less monotone. There are a couple places where Tucker uses some sort of filter to alter his voice (see “Prayer of Hatred” and “Umulamahri”), but other than that, Tucker’s voice hardly varies by one note. On the upside, Tucker’s voice doesn’t need to. I find Tuckers guttural vocals to be soothing, and I think the album benefits from his vocal consistency (though to some, it would border on monotony). The bass does almost nothing special but provide the low end for Azagthoth's riffs, except for some parts of “Invocation of the Continual One” where it is clearly audible.\n\nThis album isn’t perfect though. There is one problem with the album that prevents it from getting a 100%, and that is the instrumentals. As usual, Morbid Angel’s instrumentals come back to bite them in the ass. This time though, its particularly egregious. Of the last five tracks, four of them are instrumentals. Are they all bad? No, “Hym to a Gas Giant\" is a great ambient guitar segway from “Covenant of Death” to “Invocation of the Continual One”. However, the rest of the instrumentals are either synth, or exercises in percussion. The percussive instrumentals aren’t really bad by any means (they are one of the reasons I think that Formulas is a great Sandoval performance), but they continue the album past its logical ending point in a procrustean manner, and are just boring after thirty seconds or so. As for “Trooper”, I was expecting an Iron Maiden Cover, which would have been really interesting, but I was unpleasantly surprised with the vaguely warlike sound of what I think was supposed to be a helicopter, hence no doubt, the song name. Morbid Angel needs to either release the synth instrumentals on a separate EP, or ditch them altogether, as they ruin the continuity of otherwise perfect albums.\n\nIn summation, on this album, Morbid Angel fully and finally integrate the high and mid-tempo sections of their songs together to create the headbanging odyssey that is Formulas Fatal to the Flesh. This focus on guitar riffing is emphasized by the soothing monotone voice of Steve Tucker. The only things that drag the album down are, as usual, their album-disrupting instrumentals.\n\nI'm fed up. I woke up on the wrong side of the bed this morning and I'm sick of trying to deny it. This is, hands down, my favorite Morbid Angel album and I believe it to be the most powerful in the entire discography. Yup, you've heard that right folks - I believe it even surpasses the mighty 1989 classic Alters of Madness as well as other seminal works such as Covenant (1993) and the subsequent Domination (1995). Your rib-collecting songs such as \"Prayer of Hatred\" and \"Nothing is Not\" are brutal yet at the same time as uplifting as anything I've heard in the genre. Many songs on here remind me a lot of Behemoth's 2014 masterpiece The Satanist - not so much musically, but lyrically and in that same spirit which seems to cry out and reaffirm their love for Satan (although I believe in this case they were aimed more at the Sumerian gods and Lovecraft's Ancient Ones).\n\nAt the very least it's the group's most underrated performance. Take the opening track \"Heaving Earth\" - which comes off as more of a conjuration than an actual song. Trey Azagthoth begins the onslaught with an opening riff which digs right through to the depths of the ribbery. Around the 15 second mark there is a total collapse of sanity as Steve Tucker erupts into the guttural assault like an absolute demon of the shred. Trey, demented now, blitzkriegs into more signature tremolo riffage (52 seconds in) like a Buzz-saw straight out of the loony bin. The unquenchable savagery is matched only by Pete Sandoval's pulverizing blast beats.\n\nSlipping further and further past the brink of brutalization, they pummel onward into to what I believe to be the strongest track on the album. Crunching, squealing, and all out of fucks to give - \"Nothing is Not\" comes scraping in at only around 95 beats per minute. Like someone straight out of a sludge factory, Tucker displays complete command of the bash as he shifts, becoming a master of the dig. Meanwhile, Trey, delivering pinch harmonics like a twisted crank artist leaves the listener questioning reality: how can this many ribs be taken in one song? It's like they are saying fuck you the entire time and there is nothing you can do but lay there basking in the blood of the innocent.\n\nAt this point any thoughts of turning back are vanquished and they transcend space and time with the face melting \"Chambers of Dis\". The haunting instrumental \"Disturbance of the Great Slumber\" sets up another crusher in \"Umalamahri\" which is then followed by \"Hellspawn: the Rebirth\". Everything is coming together quite nicely now.\n\nSlaughtering it's way into the nether, the album reaches it's crescendo with one of the final riffs (around 7 minutes in) to \"Invocation of the Continual One\" (which i believe is just a mash up of a bunch of different ideas Trey had lying around). The record begins to fade out with two more masterful percussion instrumentals in \"Ascent through the Spheres\" and \"Hymno Rituales de Guerra\" from Mr. Sandoval.\n\nThis is essential listening. I find myself coming back time and time again to this album throughout the years and each time it sparks newfound inspiration. People are sleeping on Steve but I'm more than happy to have him back, and word is that he and Trey will go back to their old brutal ways after their disappointing last album. Anyways, I could go on and wallow in nostalgia for hours about this record and this moment in my life. I'm just excited that Steve is back and I hope to hear \"Nothing is Not\" live - see you in the fucking pit. Hail Satan and Stay Brutal Bitch! \\m/\n\nMany things in life are granted to us which we innocuously take for granted, things which we fail to fully appreciate or allow ourselves to be open and vulnerable to. The beauty of the sunset each night, a solar eclipse, the purring of a cat, the guitar solo in \"Another Brick In The Wall Pt. 2\", the cookies your grandmother baked... all of these things, in our engagement-with and reactions-to, are monumentally telling about the type of person we are, and our ability to appreciate the things in this world.\n\nThe genius collective mastermind of Trey Azagthoth and Pete Sandoval have graciously allowed us to engage in just such one of these cosmic wonders, and the way that metalheads speak of and react to, in my mind, speaks volumes about the prospect of death metal's future being vibrant, bright, varied, and fulfilling.\n\nMany people mistake this album for something standard, like Reign In Blood, or Legion, which are straight-forward journeys of simple-minded blasphemous violence. And they are great, they satisfy our need for intensity and our thirst for rage. However, death metal can only go so far in parameters and formats such as these, as the mid-to-late 90's downfall of death metal surely made abundantly clear.\n\nRather, this Morbid Angel album hs more in common with \"Dark Side of the Moon\", or \"Animals\" than it does with Covenant, Imperial Doom, or Effigy of the Forgotten. This album is about opening up to emotion, and allowing one to submit to the range of human experience that the cosmos has set up for us. In their own twisted, brilliant way, Trey and Pete have simply created the violent death metal equivalent to such transcendental and groovey moments as the harmonized twin-lead guitar majesty of Pink Floyd's \"Dogs\" or the breathtaking psychedelic serenity of Dead Can Dance's \"Nierika\" or Shpongle's \"Shpongle Falls\".\n\nThis record is a benchmark for death metal, a sign-post to how macrocosmic and transcendental death metal's fans will allow the genre to become. Sure, other bands incorporate non-metal elements into the music itself, with Nile's Egyptian melody, Mithras' psychedelic space journeys, Vital Remains' neo-classical shred, etc. But no band has ever crafted an album as such an artful statement as this, to be taken on a journey into uncomfortable territory, to force us to think outside the box and incorporate non-metal elements into the whole picture-flow.\n\nBecause with this record, Trey is posing the question: how open are you? How in touch with the spirit are you? He has written songs that are clearly barometers for the enlightenment of metal fans: do the solos in \"Prayer of Hatred\" generate feelings of inexpressable wonder? Does the climax to the solo \"Heaving Earth\" dissolve away your limitations, allowing you to feel the grace of infinity, if only for a moment? Does the 2nd half of \"Covenant of Death\" take your breath away? Do you pick up on the arcing spiritual journey that the 2nd half of the album takes you on, specifically the musical sequence of Hellspawn - Covenant of Death - Hymn to a Gas Giant - Invocation of the Continual One - Ascent Through The Spheres, and the way that your soul is lifted up by the outro solo of Invocation of the Continual One and gloriously released into blissful nirvana of Ascent Through The Spheres?\n\nSee, you're not supposed to pick up on the fact that this stuff isn't death metal. You're not supposed to care or think about there being clean guitar in the ending to \"Covenant of Death\". This music is supposed to transcend genre-identification and pidgeonholing, and to rather become something more... it is supposed to be recognized as simply \"great emotive, moving music\". You aren't supposed to care about the ending to \"Covenant of Death\" not being typical death metal; you are simply supposed to sit there, with your jaw hanging wide open with drool hanging out of the side of your mouth, stunned, and thinking \"Wow, holy fucking crap, that was INCREDIBLE.\" You're supposed to get goosebumps as the last sections of \"Invocation of the Continual One\" prepare you in anticipation of the climax release of the outro guitar solo's commencement.\n\nMany people don't understand this, and thats okay. There are great standard death metal and standard Morbid Angel songs. The violence of \"Chambers of Dis\" is ridiculous, and the churning, chewing stomp of \"Umulamahri\" is awesome. The slow acceleration at the beginning of \"Hellspawn: The Rebirth\" is downright diabolical and demonic.\n\nThis album is full of pure brilliance that is laughingly obvious. Its a shame that death metal as a whole can't see the magic, but such is the way of humanity... we are not equal, and some people do not have the same ability to see beyond their narrow stereotypes and ego-satisfaction needs.\n\nSo, this album showed exactly what death metal will experience from here on out: a struggle, a struggle to pave new path when most don't want it. The struggle to do something new, when people want to listen to Altars, Deicide, and Effigy forever, yet always proclaiming themselves to be accepting and open-minded. This album is the benchmark album for whether metalheads are indeed open-minded and sensitive to the human condition, and it is a barometer for how far death metal will go and how greatly it may or may not succeed.\n\nFor I can only hope that future generations will pick up on the brilliance contained herein, and how Morbid Angel shattered the mold and changed the world when everybody thought them to be dead in the water, following Dave's departure and a sterile, lifeless 4th album. Hopefully they won't be scared of being called a \"wuss\" for enjoying the vaulted melodies of \"Disturbance in the Great Slumber\" or afraid to let themselves enjoy the glistening sparkle of \"Hymn to a Gas Giant\" lest they forever be branded a \"pussy\".\n\nIn the meantime, I will content myself by letting the sublime tension-releasing climax of \"Covenant of Death\" warm my soul and expand my consciousness, allowing me to glimpse tranquil vistas of brilliant sunsets in worlds unknown and spectral wonders that have yet to be dreampt.\n\nRelax, open yourself up, disinhibit your social posturing, put on \"Formulas Fatal To The Flesh\", and let it blow your mind. It wants you to let it do so.\n\nMorbid Angel – Formulas Fatal to the Flesh\n\nYou can say that Covenant was the turning point, the sign of change for Florida veterans Morbid Angel when they boarded the ship bound for the shores of modern death metal. It was 1993 and death metal, though it had been around for a while, was for many achieving its apex and defining what would be called its modern form. For a lot of bands the early 90’s was the setting for the departure from thrash and the grasping of an identity they could truly call their own. Morbid Angel was just such a band and like it or not Covenant replaced the rapid-fire punky rhythms and raspy assault of the band's first two albums with a streamlined, down-tuned, and overall fuller and heavier sound that represented the trademarks of death metal to come.\n\nSome rejoiced at this development and others bemoaned it, upset by the more linear beats and riffs and not impressed by the gruffness the band adopted. But without getting into Covenant itself too much, it can be said that understanding that album can’t be done without a longer gaze, and whether Covenant was the beginning of something new or simply another step in a continuing path, Morbid Angel were both adopting the new death metal standards and adapting their signature sound. Proof of this came along with ‘95’s follow up, Domination, a divisive album characterized by great success and damning failures. The inconsistency of this album ushered in a tumultuous period for the band, a period defined by successes and failures. While Domination found itself on the wrong side of that line, Its successor did not.\n\nFormulas Fatal to the Flesh, on the surface, is a return to Covenant values: the mix is consistent and robust, the most dense and punishing of the band’s career – only Gateways to Annihilation was comparable, and it didn’t have the crunch of it’s predecessor. The guitar work is, structurally, also a return to Covenant, abandoning the large, epic and often pointless style from Domination and keeping things active throughout. New vocalist Steve Tucker also continues the rough baritone David Vincent had adopted since Covenant. Looking a little deeper, though, we see that Domination isn’t entirely forgotten: the riffing itself is much the same grinding, rolling affair that made the good moments of Domination so good, and the drumming is a similar barrage of blasts and double bass rolls, though not without the nuance Pete Sandoval has always managed to work in. Formulas, ultimately, corrected many of the mistakes of Domination while, at its core, staying true to that album’s essential musical traits. To see Formulas only in reference to Covenant, while tempting, makes it impossible to understand.\n\nIn the first place, Formulas was the heaviest material the band had put out to date. From the first devastating chord of “Heaving Earth” it is evident that this is not just an evolution but an overreaction. After the hollow sound of Domination, Formulas, employs an extremely crunchy, buzzy and distorted guitar tone that envelopes all the riffs, chords and harmonies. These songs have to be listened to actively and with diligence to be heard and understood. “Heaving Earth” is full of complex riffs that slip right under your nose if you’re not paying attention, and “Chamber of Dis” features some blistering finger work that employs the standard chug-chug as well as some truly painful discordant harmonies. Make no mistake, this is technical death metal, just not in the style of a Necrophagist or Spawn of Possession. The violence of the music is almost in direct opposition to Dominations attempt to thrive on pace and progression.\n\nThe riffs are not all fast and technical though – for every face melting, finger-burning section there is one that demonstrates the harmonic brilliance of the band. “Nothing is Not” is perhaps the best example of this – a slower song featuring extremely low chords and perfectly paced mid tempo riffing that brings out the sheer power of the material here. It’s that typical death metal style but with Trey Azagthoth’s soon-to-be-trademark sluggish- and sludginess. Songs like “Umulamahri” trudge along deliberately, as though resisted at every step but forging ever forward with unstoppable force. Here is the sonic precursor to the sludgefest that is Gateways to Annihilation, probably Morbid Angel’s most definitive statement of uniqueness and originality coupled with precise and controlled power. This is the legacy of Domination, what the album should have and tried to achieve with significantly stunted success.\n\nOne of the champions of that unsuccess was the vocal production. At times, we had good, powerful, if not overly guttural, growls, but at other times the ridiculous reverb and various effects rendered them totally silly. Even at their best, they lacked the fullness of the bellows on display throughout the genre. Steve Tucker’s delivery isn’t that different, but it’s utterly consistent, never varying from that harsh, rasping bark. The sort of flat quality to his delivery allows his outbursts to glide along the surface of the instrumental juggernaut that they accompany and complement the discordant, dissonant element of the sound. His barks are fast and his timing is excellent, allowing him to keep up with the faster sections, and he never falls into the sort of muddy, incoherent gurgling that, while enjoyable, would detract from the constrained madness that this album is. The vocals here are clearly meant to ruffle no feathers, to be a fitting accompaniment to the music that has been so refined.\n\nDepth is another quality that sets apart the music found here. Whereas Domination was overly transparent, with all the sounds too isolated and unable to cohere with the necessary power of a death metal offering, Formulas is immersive in the best way. All the sounds layer perfectly on top of one another in a decipherable yet synergistic fashion so that they individually overpower everything else and work together to form a massive whole. On the low end, Pete Sandoval’s drumming demonstrates how all metal drums should sound: the bass drum is deep and low, loud yet not triggered to death so that it covers everything else, with the sort of soft thud that makes it almost enchanting; tom hits are marked by a very percussive quality – they sound like a drum, not just like their actual tone; the snare is perfectly crisp, rising up above all the others with just the right amount of reverb – it pops when he blasts and yet flows smoothly when called upon repeatedly. Aside from the tone, the drumbeats are almost all great. His blasting is crazy fast, as on “Heaving Earth” and “Chambers of Dis” and his double bass beats are groovy and catchy as on “Nothing is Not” and “Prayer of Hatred.” Fills are fast and well placed but never overdone or overabundant. Pete, like the rest of the band, perfectly toes the line of technicality, mixing in just enough to impress and amaze without sacrificing the identity or functionality of any song.\n\nBut there’s a whole other side of this album that hasn’t even been mentioned – the genius and novelty of Trey Azagthoth. I could write this whole review about his riffs alone and that wouldn’t even do him justice. Aside from the fast, heavy, technical riffs and awesome harmonies there are the mind-bending solos, another vestige of Domination’s innovation but here allowed to shine. “Heaving Earth” gives the first taste, this one short but sweet, a lick ascending from utter darkness into magnificent splendor and then flaming out, like a solar flare erupting from the molten surface. “Chambers of Dis” has two, each featuring blazing shredding and whining, high strung chords that tear at the fibers of the mind. Trey passes seamlessly from high to low, at times dropping so far he can barely be heard and at others soaring so high the sounds are barely distinguishable as actual notes. “Covenant of Death” features some classic tapping and arpeggios with the typical overdose of gain out of which bursts forth a great melodic lead traveling at light speed. And there are many others. Throughout the album are the searing melodies of Azagthoth, dancing along the surface of the crunchy guitar tone, meandering into and out of the hellish miasma underneath. When he wants to he can be extremely melodic, such as the end of “Covenant of Death” and the incredible next song, “Hymn to a Gas Giant.” Trey’s guitar work here is at times like a caustic sludge, at others like an eruption into flame and at others like a cloud of nebular gases sublimely wafting through the void. He touches upon the greatest evils of the mortal world and the most supreme limits of existence just as this album traverses an equally vast and analogous region. Nothing could demonstrate this better than the final true song on the album, “Invocation to a Continual One,” a microcosm of the album itself, containing, within its nearly 10 minutes every feature of the album mentioned above packaged within the kind of punky beats of the band’s older material, as though to show you, all at once, where they were, where they are and, presumably, where they’re headed.\n\nThis album is everything Domination should have been: starting with a standard death metal formula it incorporates even heavier, sludgier tones, fast and pummeling drumming and rhythms, powerful and abrasive vocals, coherent songwriting and enchanting melodies. That said, it does suffer from a few shortcomings: for a 13 song endeavor, it’s a little short on material. The final three songs are all ambient interludes, which Morbid Angel do very well, but which here are thrown in at the end, separating nothing, leading to nothing, transitioning between nothing; further, true to its form as a response to the somewhat eclectic Domination, it can get tedious, especially with such a deluge of notes and strokes in the first 30 minutes. That said, it does what Domination could not, making the most of everything it has and making it seem like more, the opposite of its precursor.\n\nThat we view Formulas so heavily in terms of Domination is a testament to both the struggles and ambition of the band beginning with Covenant, traits that run right through to the following albums as well. Despite all its successes, Formulas was not the definitive statement for this adventurous outfit, a title that, if ever applicable, belongs to the subsequent offering, the demolishing Gateways to Annihilation. It’s as though it swung so hard in the opposite direction from Domination that it too missed the mark, and despite being a compelling and laudable album was perhaps mired a little too much in the conventional. Still, its merits, many of which are shared among the bands discography, are undeniable and its execution is a marvel, and if it is only one chapter in the story that is Morbid Angel we can only be thankful that such a saga exists for us listeners to parse.\n\nWritten for www.leprousgarden.com\n\nWhile I freely admit to loathing the shit out of this album for many years, I think it's important to take into account what transpired to lead into its creation. Long-time bassist/vocalist David Vincent had parted ways with Morbid Angel, moving on to help his wife out with the Genitorturers. This led to the search for a replacement, and thus Steve Tucker was brought on, leading to some derision and division among the fan base. Vincent left some huge shoes to fill, and through his three studio albums with the band, Tucker has done his best to do so. He's got a similar, deep vocal tone and four string acceleration suited well to their style, but I simply don't feel that he was given the most interesting material here to work with...\n\nSo I didn't have high expectations for what I'd be hearing, and after the insane deluge of hype and press surrounding its manifestation, it was a rather enormous disappointment. An even further experimental work than Domination, which received mixed responses (it happens to be one of my favorites in the band's discography, with a wealth of memorable content I still listen through on a normal basis). That said, after about a decade of numbness towards Formulas Fatal to the Flesh, I have so slightly warmed to its molten Mythos evocations. Not warmed to the point that I'd consider it a good album. I'll stand by the opinion that it's the worst they've ever recorded. But there are a handful of metallic tracks here with interesting components, and Sandoval seemed to set himself some new records for manic, inhuman blasting. \"Chambers of Dis\", anyone? Fucking ludicrous, in particular his ability to shift on and off these rhythms (i.e. \"Covenant of Death\").\n\nIt's honestly the most 'showy' Morbid Angel album, with extremely brazen, clean production values that surpass the swampy depths of Domination and the flat and average Covenant or Blessed Are the Sick. The guitar tone is fibrous and crunchy, yet loses nothing in the fits of sheer speed that populate the compositions. Admittedly, the bass lines are predictable and boring, rarely given the top billing, but then, so too were Vincent's. What really drags the album's flow under would be the ambient, instrumental vignettes which feel amateur and cheesy, and don't seem to mesh into the metallic onslaughts. I'm speaking of the forgettable \"Disturbance in the Great Slumber\" and its shoddy, uninteresting attempts at synthesized chaos, or the flighty and sporadic guitar instrumental \"Hymn to a Gas Giant\", or the VGM-like \"Ascent Through the Spheres\". About the only interlude of interest would be the \"Hymnos Rituals de Guerra\" and its warlike, programmed percussive sensations, but even this could have done with some better atmospheric accompaniment. In short, these all should have been snipped free of the album, and the metal left to do the talking.\n\nI've already mentioned \"Chambers of Dis\", and it's the one song I would take away from this album and include on a career highlight reel for its voracious swiftness and diabolic thundering urges. It's also one of the few points at which this album recaptures the sinister miasma of their legendary Altars of Madness, trumping it in sheer force, with bristling leads and a whirling muted barrage deep in the bridge that creates a sense of vertigo, of falling into the unknown. But for this, there are a number of faster, less intriguing pieces present. \"Hellspawn: the Rebirth\" is pure Morbid Angel, an old tune given official release at long last, but the majority of the riffs lack distinct character, and the same goes for \"Heaving Earth\". \"Covenant of Death\" is about half kick-ass, while the slower, crawling fare like \"Nothing is Not\" or the epic and bizarre \"Invocation of the Continual One\" are sure to lose a few minds in their labyrinthine corridors.\n\nMy own gray matter cannot be counted among the victims, I'm afraid. For all the variation the band have brought together, Formulas Fatal to the Flesh as a whole feels disheveled and rushed, as if a majority of random riffs and elements were packaged together with mildly conceptual libations to beings that don't exist, and some decent lyrics (\"Nothing is Not\", \"Prayer of Hatred\"). Punishing if you just want your eardrums kicked in like the pedals beneath Pete Sandoval's feet, but largely lacking in the malevolent dimensions that made their debut album (and Domination) so great. From a technical standpoint it bears its burden, and it seemed stifle the concerns over the band's new front man. But in the long run, I've found it nothing but an experiment in controlled chaos, a buffet of brutal scattershot urges with little cohesion. An opiate of atrocity with no lasting addiction. Mediocrity unbound, served with an ADD additive.\n\n-autothrall\n\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n\nThere was a time when Morbid Angel was arguably the most fearsome band on the planet. A time when their guitars oozed menace, their lyrics dripped with venom, and their overall effect was one of paradoxically elegant savagery. That year was somewhere around 1989, when they had just birthed an album called Altars of Madness and inspired fear and awe in those that heard it. However that year was not 1998, when they had just excreted the wasteful lump of potential that was FFttF, the subject of today’s review.\n\nHaving parted ways with both mastermind vocalist/bassist David Vincent and ill-fated Richard Brunelle-replacement Erik Rutan, remaining members Trey Azagthoth and Pete Sandoval chose to fill the bass/vocal lineup vacancy with a guy named Steve Tucker. This is a choice I would view as poor, as Tucker’s growl has little in the way of distinguishing qualities. But by itself this is not problematic; it is when his passionless growling is coupled with vapid death metal almost equally devoid of distinguishing qualities that the overall level of listener suffering is raised. Whether or not it was an attempt to return to the Covenant sound after the crippling misstep that was Dominashit I’m not entirely certain. But what is certain is that as far as Morbid Angel albums go, Formulas is remarkably formulaic. In small doses, tracks like “Chambers of Dis” and “Heaving Earth” are devastating, displaying about the same tonal carnage as a track like “Rapture” or “The Ancient Ones.” But in series with sludgy garbage like “Nothing Is Not” and the copious “ambient” tracks, the event is earaching. On one hand it’s because the tracks are severely uneven, but the guitars don’t sound particularly good either. Though Trey’s tone is immediately recognizable, it is a muddier incarnation that adds only to the overall wall of noise. There are glimmers of past brilliance, notably in the form of “Invocation of the Continual One,” which features Azagthoth himself on vocals and the most ambitious writing of their entire career to date. There’s also that mellow bit in the back half of “Covenant of Death” which easily ousts all the separate keyboard-laden segues, but considering the quality of ‘those’ tracks, it wasn’t a difficult task.\n\nIndeed, the instrumental tracks deserve a special segment of derision. A fifth of the album consists of that atmospheric crap that Morbid Angel is contractually obligated to have on their albums in order to stand out from their peers, despite the fact that the “pieces” serve only to further disrupt the flow of the album. Yes, they’re disrupting a somewhat monotonous album, but the sound of these distractions is far too jarring for them to act as an appropriate change of pace. They also awkwardly conclude the album: three consecutive ambient tracks are the grand finale. I’m certain that there are some dopes out there that would attribute this as a soggy misshapen puzzle piece in Trey’s master plan: to these I can only offer my opinion that perhaps his vision has gotten a little blurry over the years. Lyrically, he’s still wading through the same paganism/demonism fodder that he’s been trying to push since day one. And you cannot discuss this album without mentioning the fact that its title is so painfully alliterative that it’s almost Seussian in its absurdity. And the fact that it’s a veiled numerological reference to the number of the beast is so fucking cheesy that I can only imagine Trey twirling his mustache and cackling madly at the very thought, just like some Old West villain who just tied some unfortunate dame to the train tracks. Yes, the whole album can be thought of as a train wreck. Sure, the cargo holds were full of great ideas, but how many of them were salvageable after impact?\n\nThey still had the most original lead guitarwork in their field and one of the sturdiest drummers, but Morbid Angel really failed to deliver in the actual song department for this one. Consider it failed. Fallacious. Farcical. False. Fucked. For fans only. But don’t consider it good.\n\nAnd so the era was over. The impossible had occurred; David Vincent had left Morbid Angel. Certainly the question circa 1998 was how such a man could be replaced: indeed, his bass, vocals, and writings were a defining portion of the entity known as Morbid Angel. A replacement was found in the form of Steve Tucker, ex-bassist/vocalist of little known (and unproductive) death metal band Ceremony. However, could such an unknown figure possibly replace one of the most legendary frontmen in death metal history?\n\nTo be fair, such doubt was not only logical but a product of the era. After the near disintegration of death metal in the mid-90’s, the latter part of the decade, while the genre rose to its feet again, was shaky and doubtful. A severe brush with commerciality in the form of the attempted Earache/Giant deal left most metallers rather paranoid of mainstream influence afterwards. Although such incidences did not kill death metal, they certainly brought the genre to its knees, awaiting the executioner’s blade. If ‘Formulas Fatal To The Flesh’, the sixth LP by Morbid Angel, had failed, death metal would likely have collapsed under its own weight and today would be a mostly forgotten genre.\n\nLuckily, it was not to be the case. Perhaps ‘Formulas Fatal To The Flesh’ is not so much important on its own terms, but as to what it allowed from the future. By being so willingly anti-commercial and esoteric in nature, this LP proved that death metal wasn’t dead yet. And this is what the scene needed at that time: reassurance that the legends were still powerful. While a certain segment of the metal-listening population derided this release (most likely out of a rather self-fulfilling prophecy of theoretical failure), the vast majority saw it for what it was: not brilliant, but solid in a genre that had been anything but for a few years past.\n\nAesthetically, ‘Formulas Fatal To The Flesh’ is specifically designed to resemble ‘Covenant’. The music is sharp and very dark in tones, an element which is used to distance the music from morbid Angel’s previous LP, ‘Domination’, which was overly bright and clear. One of the most noticable examples of this is in timing: ‘Domination’ was done entirely with electronic metronomes, whereas ‘Formulas Fatal To The Flesh’ has no artificial timing mechanisms, giving it a rougher, more organic sound overall; this ‘back to basics’ aesthetic was another reassuring element of this album, eschewing popularly accepted modernity in order to appeal to a metal scene that wanted none such inclusion. Production, too, is murkier than that found on ‘Domination’; perhaps obvious, but still effective for its purposes.\n\nAnd it’s a fast, fast album, possibly the fastest and most frantic of any of Morbid Angel’s music since the chaotic frenzy of early tracks such as ‘Bleed For The Devil’. This (admittedly somewhat artificial) extremity combined with the rougher sound and instrumentation was precisely what death metal needed in 1998: a return to ‘Altars Of Madness’ and, in a way, ‘Seven Churches’. ‘Formulas Fatal To the Flesh’ matches the musical and ideological ideals of death metal in order to represent itself as the genre in its carnal state. Once again, precisely what death metal needed. There was no time or room for ‘progression’; dependability was needed above all.\n\nSteve Tucker is most importantly described as ‘capable’. He is deeper, more gravel-throated and less distinctive than David Vincent, but an attempt to replace the latter with someone as stylistically specific as he would have been to risky at such a phase. Tucker’s voice represents ‘Formulas Fatal To The Flesh’ as a whole: extreme, yet foundational in nature, without unnecessary departures or movements away from the commonly accepted formula. His basswork is, like Vincent’s, buried in the morass of Azagthoth’s guitars. Tucker is conceptually flexible to Azagthoth’s bidding, and it can be seen in the far higher than typical influence of H.P. Lovecraft’s work on the music and lyrics here. Azagthoth controls this album down to the last letter but shows admirable restraint in his music: it does not meander to much nor stray from its goals. Probably the only example of Azagthoth restraining his ego throughout his musical history. His guitarwork is intensely remniscient of previous Morbid Angel works (critical to the success of the album), but not entirely unoriginal: the riffing present here is not heard on other albums, though it does bear more than a passing resemblance to that found on ‘Covenant’.\n\nSandoval’s drumming is simpler than usual, with less obscure fills present than usual. It serves its purpose, like all things; the binary formula of blast/double bass forms the critical platform for the rest of the instruments to ride upon and does not distract from the melody-based nature of this album. One could almost call this Morbid Angel’s black metal album, as the general atmosphere and instrumentation could be said to match it in many ways, though the thicker sound does something to throw off such comparisons.\n\n‘Heaving Earth’, opener of ‘Formulas Fatal To the Flesh’ is tight and percussive, and begins on one of the major themes that is present in the album: that of ancient Sumeria. Frequently throughout the LP Tucker will use ancient Sumerian in his lyrics, alternating from typical English to further the archaic feel of the album. Such words are tight, percussive and guttural, composed almost exclusively of one or two-syllable words. It matches the music perfectly in these dimension, almost sounding like an additional drum of Pete Sandoval’s kit, where rhythms are used to carry the meaning of the melodies. This album is violently rhythmic, like ‘Covenant’, and particularly violent in this respect.\n\nThis album showcases the highest use of ambience in Morbid Angel’s work to date: a full five tracks are dedicated to such works, with a block of three composing the ending of the album. Such tracks are highly varied: ‘Hymn To A Gas Giant’ to a very strange, wafting guitar piece, ‘Hymnos Rituales De Guerra’ is entirely composed of percussion, and ‘Ascent Through The Spheres’ functions as a bridge in between. Closer ‘Trooper’ is pure synths and sound effects of warfare and is likely the most powerful ambient work that Morbid Angel has ever composed.\n\nHowever, ambient works, while more important here than on any previous Morbid Angel album, still take a back seat to death metal. Songs such as ‘Bil Ur-Sag’ and ‘Chambers Of Dis’ are savage in their intensity and conviction; a very, very appreciated return post-’Domination’. On the other end of the spectrum, ‘Nothing Is Not’ is the sole slow track that would set the pattern for their next album ‘Gateways To Annihilation’s devastating sludge. However, despite these mild departures, the emphasis is squarely on high-sped, ripping death metal exemplified by tracks such as ‘Hellspawn: The Rebirth’ (a redux of an ancient, demo-era track) and ‘Covenant Of Death’ (the name of which is no coincidence at all). Tracks such as these are fast, punishing, and strong. There is no impartiality or weakness on this album. It is a proud, strong album, fitting the otherworldly atmosphere and philosophical implications of this LP.\n\nOn its own terms, ‘Formulas Fatal To the Flesh’ is good, but not stunning. But when taken into account with the time of its release, this album can be appreciated much more for what it is: one of the albums that saved death metal."
