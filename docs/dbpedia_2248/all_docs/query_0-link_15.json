After several lineup changes in its early years, the band settled on nine members for more than a decade: Crahan, Jordison, Gray, Craig Jones, Mick Thomson, Corey Taylor, Sid Wilson, Chris Fehn, and Jim Root. Gray died on May 24, 2010, and was replaced during 2011–2014 by guitarist Donnie Steele. Jordison was dismissed from the band on December 12, 2013. Steele left during the recording sessions for .5: The Gray Chapter. The band found replacements in Alessandro Venturella on bass and Jay Weinberg on drums. After the departure of Jordison, as of December 2013 the only founding member in the current lineup is percussionist Crahan. Fehn was also dismissed from the band in March 2019 prior to the writing of We Are Not Your Kind. The band has sold 30 million records worldwide.\n\nGojira are a French heavy metal band from Ondres. Founded as Godzilla in 1996, the band's lineup—brothers Joe (lead vocals, rhythm guitar) and Mario Duplantier (drums), Christian Andreu (lead guitar), and Jean-Michel Labadie (bass)—has been the same since the band changed its name to Gojira in 2001. Gojira has been known for their progressive and technical death metal styles and their spiritual and environmentally-themed lyrics. The band has gone \"from the utmost obscurity during the first half of their career to widespread global recognition in the second\". Gojira's first two albums, Terra Incognita (2001) and The Link (2003), and powerful live performances established their reputation as a leading French metal band. Maciste All'Inferno was a silent film score composed and performed for a one-night show in Bordeaux. Their third album, the critically acclaimed From Mars to Sirius (2005) was covered in the British metal press. The band then signed with Prosthetic Records.\n\nRammstein, a German band, emerged onto the musical scene in 1994. The band was formed in Berlin and comprises six members - Till Lindemann, Richard Kruspe, Paul Landers, Oliver Riedel, Christoph Schneider, and Christian Lorenz. Known for their distinctive blend of metal, industrial, and techno music, they gained worldwide fame with hit songs such as \"Du Hast\" and \"Sonne.\" Their unique artistic expression is also reflected in their provocative lyrics, which often delve into controversial subjects, and their visually striking live shows, renowned for pyrotechnics and theatrical performances. Rammstein's first studio album, Herzeleid, was released in 1995, marking the start of a prolific career that spans over two decades. Their second album, Sehnsucht (1997), proved to be their breakthrough, especially with the success of the single \"Du Hast.\" By their third album, \"Mutter\" (2001), they had solidified their place in the world of hard rock and metal. The band has since produced several more successful albums, including \"Reise, Reise\" (2004) and \"Rosenrot\" (2005). The strength of their discography is demonstrated by their consistent chart-topping success and multi-platinum status in several countries. Aside from their music, Rammstein's reputation extends to their commitment to creative expression through their concerts and music videos. Their live performances are known for their extensive use of pyrotechnics and spectacular stage designs, setting them apart in the industry. Their music videos often portray elaborate and cinematic narratives that compliment their songs' themes, further enhancing their distinct identity. Despite facing occasional controversy due to their daring approach, Rammstein's innovative style and fearless artistry have contributed significantly to their enduring appeal.\n\nLamb of God known professionally as Lamb of God, is an American heavy metal band formed in 1994 in Richmond, Virginia. Originally formed as Burn the Priest, the group consists of bassist John Campbell, vocalist Randy Blythe, guitarists Mark Morton and Willie Adler, and drummer Art Cruz. The band is considered a significant member of the new wave of the American heavy metal movement. The band's cumulative sales equal almost two million in the United States, including two albums certified Gold by the RIAA. In 2010 and 2011 the band received Grammy nominations for songs from their 2009 album Wrath. The band's ninth studio album, Omens, was released on October 7, 2022.\n\nKorn (stylized as KoЯn) are an American nu metal band from Bakersfield, California, formed in 1993. The band is notable for pioneering the nu metal genre and bringing it into the mainstream. Originally formed in 1993 by three members of the band L.A.P.D., Korn's current lineup features founding members James \"Munky\" Shaffer (rhythm guitar), Reginald \"Fieldy\" Arvizu (bass), Brian \"Head\" Welch (lead guitar, backing vocals), and Jonathan Davis (lead vocals, bagpipes), with the addition of Ray Luzier (drums) in 2007, replacing the band's first drummer, David Silveria. Korn made a demo tape, Neidermayer's Mind, in 1993, which was distributed free to record companies and on request to members of the public. Their debut album, Korn, was released in 1994, followed by Life Is Peachy (1996). The band first experienced mainstream success with Follow the Leader (1998) and Issues (1999), both of which debuted at number one on the Billboard 200. The band's mainstream success continued with more LPs.\n\nMegadeth is an American thrash metal band from Los Angeles, California. The group was formed in 1983 by guitarist Dave Mustaine and bassist David Ellefson, shortly after Mustaine's dismissal from Metallica. A pioneer of the American thrash metal scene, the band is credited as one of the genre's \"big four\" with Anthrax, Metallica and Slayer, responsible for thrash metal's development and popularization. Megadeth plays in a technical style, featuring fast rhythm sections and complex arrangements; themes of death, war, politics and religion are prominent in the group's lyrics. In 1985, the band released its debut album on the independent label Combat Records. The album's moderate commercial success caught the attention of bigger labels, which led to Megadeth signing with Capitol Records. Their first major-label album, Peace Sells... but Who's Buying?, was released in 1986 and influenced the underground metal scene. Despite its prominence in thrash metal, frequent disputes between its members and substance abuse issues brought Megadeth negative publicity during this period."
