        "text": "Nothing provokes the artistic sensibility like grief. In the artist, events like those of Tuesday morning bring about a meeting of universal emotions and an individual will to unearth them, expose them, understand them and accept if not outlast them.\n\nIn grief is a myriad of human terrors: the visceral blow that brings rage and outrage, the insidious settling in of pain and sadness; the concentric waves of anguish that continue through time. All of these have been evoked through the centuries with the power of great imaginations.\n\nFrom Homer's tales of Troy to Picasso's \"Guernica,\" from Tchaikovksy's \"PatheÃÅtique\" to Bill T. Jones's \"Still/Here,\" from the bloody dramas of Sophocles and Shakespeare to Maya Lin's Vietnam Memorial, artists have always combated grave tragedy with grave beauty. Below, critics of The New York Times reflect on how art in all its forms has girded us to go on grieving and living.\n\nBRUCE WEBER\n\nTHEATER\n\nA Rending Scream That Spoke for All\n\nThose who were there when the scream was sounded offstage said they could still hear it decades later.\n\nThe voice belonged to Laurence Olivier, who was playing Oedipus at the Old Vic in London in 1946. He was crying out at the moment when Sophocles' mighty king of Thebes, undone by the last of too many blows of cruel revelation, tore out his own eyes, unwilling to look anymore on a world that for him was damaged beyond recognition and beyond repair.\n\nFor Londoners, who had prized their stoicism throughout the devastation of their city during the war, the noise must have been especially unsettling, giving voice to a primal grief and terror that had for so long been honored by silence. It was a cry that uttered the unutterable, reflecting the stunned, anguished wonder in the face of unfathomable human tragedy, first articulated by Sophocles thousands of years earlier.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
