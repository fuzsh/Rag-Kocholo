        "text": "The best Rick Rubin songs\n\n1. Run-DMC (With Aerosmith) – “Walk This Way”\n\nThe collaboration between Run-DMC and Aerosmith on “Walk This Way” is a landmark in music history, bridging the gap between rock and rap. A song that was held special by both bands, it was a fan favourite of Aerosmith but was also the beat that Run, Dee, and Jay of Run-DMC used to loop on turntables to rap over. The stars were aligned for this collaboration.\n\nWithout Rubin, this song simply wouldn’t have happened. Unifying the two bands and sounds together, the result was a dynamic, barrier-breaking hit that peaked at number 4 on the Billboard Hot 100, surpassing the original song’s success. This version of “Walk This Way” not only revitalised Aerosmith’s career but also marked a significant milestone for hip-hop, proving its mainstream potential.\n\n2. System of A Down – “Chop Suey!”\n\nThere aren’t many bigger metal bands or albums than Toxicity and the lead single, “Chop Suey!”, remains an anthem some 23 years later. Sonically, Rubin built on prior work with SOAD and added more grit, more aggression, and of course – in his signature style – more distortion to the mix, delivering a crushing sonic assault from start to finish.\n\nA musical dichotomy, “Chop Suey!” balances a powerful message with a playful composition that veers between a frenzied verse to a relaxed chorus, all while never relenting in its sound. Rubin’s fingerprints can be heard all over the Toxicity record, from the crunchingly heavy guitars, super-compressed drums, and vocals tinged with distortion. Toxicity sits atop the podium of the finest work Rubin has ever produced.\n\n3. Johnny Cash – “Hurt”\n\nThis Nine Inch Nails cover was suggested to Cash by Rubin because of the lyrical content. Haunting and emotional, the song has become Cash’s de facto elegy when he died shortly after its release. Taking on entirely new meaning, this acoustic, stripped back, and reworked version of the track brought the lyrical content to a new place then it was originally intended.\n\nA powerful rendition, the original author Reznor declared that the song no longer belongs to him.\n\nCash’s voice is naked, the guitar balances with the vocals, and the crescendo of instruments slowly blends into a distortion; it’s almost as if the song itself is a sonic recreation of the part of Cash’s life at that moment.\n\n4. Red Hot Chilli Peppers – “Californication”\n\nA pivotal moment in the band’s career, this anthemic rock song removed elements of their funk origins to a more melodic rock song. Recorded at Cello Studios in Los Angeles, Rubin’s production focuses on power blues guitar riffs and expansive choruses. The recording process was intensive yet swift, taking just over three weeks, with all band members playing together in the same room to capture a cohesive, live feel.\n\nRubin’s use of close-miking techniques through a Neve 8038 desk and Ampex 124 tape recorders resulted in a dry, punchy sound, allowing each member’s sound to be heard distinctly without distraction. This track not only redefined RHCP’s sound but also solidified their place in rock music history.\n\nCapture the sound of the vintage found and analog feel of Californication with the u-he Satin (tape machine) and Arturia 1973-Pre (Neve-style preamp and EQs).\n\n5. Beastie Boys – “(You Gotta) Fight For Your Right (To Party!)”\n\nA collaboration between artist and producer, “(You Gotta) Fight For Your Right (To Party!)” is a prime example of the genre-blending that Rubin became associated with in his early days. Featuring a simple yet powerful three-chord riff and a rebellious rally-cry, this track highlighted the Beastie’s innate and diverse sensibilities, which ran the gamut from punk to pop to hip-hop and back.\n\nThe track’s success transformed Def Jam from a boutique label into a major player in the industry. Its blend of punk, pop, and hip-hop elements, coupled with its tongue-in-cheek lyrics, showcased Rubin’s knack for creating catchy, impactful music. This song was pivotal in garnering mainstream attention for both the Beastie Boys and Rubin.\n\nYou can’t write a song like Beastie Boys without the Roland Cloud TR-808 Virtual Instrument to recreate the sound of the ’80s massive drum tones.\n\n6. Jazzy Jay – “Def Jam/Cold Chillin’ in the Spot”\n\nIf Def Jam’s first two singles can be thought of as launching pads for the label’s first two acts, “Def Jam/Cold Chillin’ in the Spot” by Jazzy Jay serves as an early promotional anthem for Def Jam Records.\n\nReleased in early 1985, the track features frosty beatbox funk reminiscent of Afrika Bambaataa’s style. Rubin’s production showcases Vocoderised vocals, vigorous scratching, and samples from classic breakbeats.\n\nThis song is more than just music; it’s an advertisement for Def Jam’s raw, energetic brand. Rubin’s innovative approach and Jay’s dynamic performance encapsulate the essence of early hip-hop, helping to establish Def Jam as a powerhouse in the music industry.\n\nThe standout aspect of the vocals, grab the Antares Auto-Tune Vocodist for a flexible and dynamic vocoder effect.\n\n7. Slayer – “Angel Of Death”\n\nA new venture for Rubin, Slayer marked his first “rock” album. Angel of Death is a blistering, double-bass-filled onslaught of guitar and vocalist Tom Araya’s signature yelled vocals, culminating in what is one of the most intense pieces of music ever written.\n\nRubin recalls, “They played so fast. If you listen to any of the really fast recordings before Slayer, they sounded like rock records. There are certain things you do to make a Rock record, but because Slayer played so fast, those things you would normally do didn’t work so well…That was my mission: How do you get a cross the clarity, articulation, speed and energy?”\n\nRubin started this mission by making the drums louder, making them hit harder than anything heard before and doing away with reverb, to capture the articulation and machine-like precision by removing the blurring that reverb creates. The result is the perfect canvas on which Slayer can blood-splatter their unrelenting aggression with machine-line precision. Metal at its finest.\n\nA signature aspect of Slayer’s sound is the dual assault of King and Hanneman’s Marshall stacks. Grab the IK Multimedia AmpliTube 5 MAX and virtually emulate their tone at respectable volumes.\n\n8. LL Cool J – “I Need a Beat”\n\nProduced while Rubin was still a university student using a DX drum machine, this seminal song marks their first collaboration, with Rubin helping LL organise his rhymes into a cohesive structure.\n\nRubin’s minimalist production, featuring stark beats and scratching, provides a gritty backdrop that amplifies LL’s youthful aggression and streetwise energy. The track’s raw, unpolished sound became a hallmark of Rubin’s style, coupled with his production credit as “REDUCED BY RICK RUBIN” earned him recognition in the hip-hop community.\n\nIts success helped establish Rubin’s reputation as a producer and set the stage for the future of hip-hop production.\n\nLooking to recreate the unmistakable sound of this beat? We recommend the GForce Oberheim DMX.\n\n9. T La Rock & Jazzy Jay – “It’s Yours”\n\n“It’s Yours” by T La Rock & Jazzy Jay is the track where Rick Rubin first established his distinct production style. Recorded during Rubin’s freshman year at NYU, this song captures the essence of live hip-hop energy he experienced in Manhattan’s clubs, contrasting sharply with the disco-influenced rap records of the time.\n\nRubin aimed to recreate the raw, exciting atmosphere of a hip-hop club. The track features hard-hitting beats, innovative scratching, and energetic vocal delivery, setting a new standard for authenticity in hip-hop production. “It’s Yours” is a pioneering effort that marked the beginning of Rubin’s influential career.\n\n10. Public Enemy – “You’re Gonna Get Yours”\n\nPublic Enemy’s “You’re Gonna Get Yours” kicks off their debut album with a bang. This track is all about making a statement and letting the world know they’re here to stay. Rubin’s production combines hard-hitting beats with Chuck D’s powerful voice, creating a track that demands attention. The lyrics and energy are all about strength and defiance, setting the tone for everything Public Enemy would go on to do.\n\nWhile they brought out more polished songs later on, “You’re Gonna Get Yours” is raw and full of impact. It’s the perfect example of Rubin’s knack for capturing a group’s true essence right from the start.\n\n11. Original Concept – “Can You Feel It?”\n\nThe epitome of Rick Rubin’s early hip-hop production style. The track’s grungy, punchy sound captures the raw energy of the genre’s formative years. Its infectious beat and rhythmic intensity made it a favourite in hip-hop circles, eventually becoming one of the most sampled tracks in the genre.\n\n12. The Cult – “Love Removal Machine”\n\nElectric marked a deliberate stylistic change in The Cult’s sound from gothic rock to more traditional hard rock. Rick Rubin had been specifically hired to remake the band’s sound to capitalize on the popularity of hard rock, glam metal, and heavy metal in the 1980s.\n\nThis rock-stomping anthemic track took inspiration from the sound of AC/DC, using them as a benchmark for what The Cult should aim for. Rubin aimed to emulate specific instrument tones from albums such as Highway To Hell and Back In Black, and even Led Zeppelin, to bring together to best of all instruments into one mix.\n\n13. Danzig – “Mother”\n\nThe track that Danzig had always wanted to write. So assured of his work, rumour has it he rang Rubin personally during the early hours of the night to share with him his breakthrough in writing his most recognised single.\n\n“Mother” is a track that fuses the sensibilities of southern rock with Danzig’s signature horror-punk, Elvis-inspired vocal delivery and range, culminating in an accessible rock anthem.\n\nThe album was the first release on producer Rick Rubin’s new label Def American Recordings. Def American’s successor, American Recordings, reissued the album in the United States and United Kingdom in 1998. It remains the band’s best-selling album having been certified gold in the U.S. in 1994, and has since been certified platinum.\n\n14. LL Cool J – “Going Back To Cali”\n\nBreaking the conventions of what Rubin set out at the inception of hip-hop, “Going Back To Cali” stands out from the rest of LL’s discography. Expanded with a horn section and a beat that fights itself, creating unique rhythms, is a stark contrast to most tracks in the genre that came before and after. LL’s smooth flow over this unique rhythm creates something truly special.\n\nThis song is a clear example of Rubin pushing boundaries and trying new things, making it a memorable part of LL Cool J’s discography.\n\n15. Red Hot Chilli Peppers – “Under The Bridge”\n\nA weighty, emotional song, “Under The Bridge” marked a turnover in RHCP’s sound. No longer was singer Anthony Kiedes hiding behind a vocal frenzy, but instead, he’s now the focal point, letting his vocals carry over each section. The track is musically built around a sublime progression by Frusciante, but words are what carry the track.\n\nUncovered by Rubin in Kiedes’ poems and diaries highlighting the difficulty of his substance abuse and his connection to the city, “Under The Bridge” became the band’s biggest song to date. Melancholy and atmospheric, this is one of Rubin’s finest credentials.\n\nA hallmark of BSSM is the authentic sound of analog recording equipment. Get the XLN Audio RC-20 to emulate this in your home recordings.\n\n16. Sir Mix-a-Lot – “Baby Got Back”\n\nWhat’s more to be said about one of the most iconic hip-hop songs ever? Whatever way you perceive the lyrics, or think about the track more in general, the fact remains you probably know the words. All of them. Word-for-word. Released under Def American, Rubin was enlisted as executive producer for this track.\n\nHow much input into the creation and mixing of it remains a bit of a mystery, but nevertheless, Baby Got Back is a musical enigma, one that divides opinion but never the dancefloor.\n\n17. Rage Against The Machine – “Renegades of Funk”\n\nIn my personal opinion, this is the best-sounding Rage Against The Machine track, helped by a clever reworking of a classic to truly make it their own. Engineered by the incredible Brendan O’Brien and produced by Rubin, “Renegades of Funk” distils everything Rage Against The Machine are about in a ferocious cover track.\n\nFat, crisp, and exceptionally punchy, the Renegades album is a masterclass in aggressive rock production. Little is known of the recording process, but it has the hallmarks of every other Rage Against the Machine album but turned up to 11 and it’s safe to assume that’s the combination of O’Brien and Rubin working together as has been the case with everything they’ve worked on together.\n\nIt’s quite well known that O’Brien uses NYC style parallel compression on his drums, typically with a Fatso, but injecting your tracks with the Universal Audio Empirical Labs Distressor will get you very close.\n\n18. Mr Hankey – “Mr. Hanky, The Christmas Poo”\n\nIt simply can’t be ignored. This is Rubin’s Magnum Opus.\n\nJoking aside, how much inclusion Rubin had in the process of South Park’s Christmas album isn’t important whatsoever. Even if in name only as executive producer, this entry had to be included. It’s a bizarre footnote on an otherwise flawless list of “who’s who” that he’s worked with and so for that reason, Mr. Hankey earns his spot.\n\n19. Eminem – “Bezerk”\n\nA nostalgic nod to old-school hip-hop, Bezerk hits the hallmarks of classic songs Eminem grew up with. Featuring samples from Billy Squier’s guitar riffs and utilising the classic 808 drum machine, the track channels the energy of early hip-hop icons like the Beastie Boys. Rubin’s production is punchy and raw, providing a perfect canvas for Eminem’s rapid-fire rhymes\n\nIf you’re going to make modern hip-hop beats, you’ll need a modern 808 drum machine. The D16 Group Nepheton 2 has got you covered.\n\n20. Run-DMC – “Can You Rock It Like This”\n\nAn undeniably quintessential hip-hop track that showcases the group’s pioneering sound. The song’s composition features a hard-hitting beat, driven by booming drums and a prominent bassline. Rubin’s production incorporates rock elements, with electric guitar riffs that add an edgy intensity to the track.\n\nThe sparse, powerful instrumentation allows Run-DMC’s energetic and confident vocals to shine. What makes this song special is its fusion of hip-hop and rock, a hallmark of Rubin’s innovative approach. Recorded with a raw, stripped-back aesthetic, the track captures the rebellious spirit and groundbreaking style that defined Run-DMC and Rubin’s early work.\n\n21. Wu-Tang Clan – “Ruckus In B Minor”\n\nThis song has a huge number of interesting beat changes, complemented perfectly with Rubin’s signature production style. It’s immediate, heavy, and has just a hair of distortion, enhancing the hard-hitting lyrics and beats that Wu-Tang Clan are known for.\n\nThough it’s a modern track, with modern production, “Ruckus In B Minor” feels like a song that has been in a vault for a while. A special mention must go to the Rhodes sample, though it sounds like something Pink Floyd would have been happy to write in the ‘70s, it matches Wu-Tang’s style perfectly.\n\n22. Audioslave – “Cochise”\n\nThe brainchild of Rubin, when Rage Against The Machine disbanded, the instrumental portion of the band were not finished yet. Consulting with Rubin, they listened to Soundgarden’s “Slaves and Bulldozers” and the next step became clear: get Chris Cornell involved.\n\n“Cochise” is a triumphant fanfare of hard rock, leaving you thinking that Cornell’s husky voice was born for this project. Sonically excellent, “Cochise” has the thumping drums, meaty guitar riffs, and absolutely thunderous bass you’d expect from Rage Against The Machine, with a melodic sense of singing that made it accessible to a vast audience.\n\nPersonally, when I think of the sonics of the Audioslave album, my mind goes straight to the fuzzy, thunderous bass tone, so why not pick up the best distortion plugin in the game to get that sound? I’m talking, of course, about the Soundtoys Decapitator 5.\n\n23. Jay-Z – “99 Problems”\n\nBorn from an Ice-T phrase, “99 Problems” sonically lands in the department of the old Def Jam sound, so it’s obvious that Rubin would have been there to lend his hand. The track features a stripped-down beat and a gritty guitar riff, reminiscent of Rubin’s classic 1980s style.\n\nJay-Z’s sharp lyrics and Rubin’s minimalist production create a powerful, raw sound that stands out in modern hip-hop. The track’s savage simplicity and use of classic samples provide a refreshing contrast to the more polished productions of the time.\n\n24. Slipknot – “Duality”\n\nAfter their 2001 release, Iowa, Slipknot were on a path of self-destruction.\n\nBrought back from the edge with a recluse stayaway in the infamous Houdini Mansion (The Mansion Studios), they picked themselves back to write their biggest song to date. Bouncy and more melodic than ever before, whilst still sounding as aggressive as ever, Slipknot’s sound evolved into a more organic version of themselves.\n\nContentious among bandmates, Rubin’s influence over Slipknot divided opinion, though it’s clear he gave them the tools and space they needed to redefine their sound. This was the moment Slipknot went from new kids on the block to headline contenders.\n\nA true metal icon, Joey Jordison’s drum tones should be everyone’s golden standard. If you’re not a drummer but want to get that for your tracks, consider Toontrack EZDrummer 3 as your new virtual drummer.\n\n25. Tom Petty – “Mary Jane’s Last Dance”\n\nAfter his work with Red Hot Chili Peppers, Rick Rubin turned his attention to a new partnership with an established rock icon, Tom Petty. This fruitful partnership produced a quintessential American rock classic. Recorded during their collaboration at Ocean Way Studios, “Mary Jane’s Last Dance” features an unforgettable opening guitar riff and a catchy hook.\n\nRubin’s production draws inspiration from the Beatles and CSNY, blending these influences into a timeless sound. “Mary Jane’s Last Dance” is certainly one of Petty’s best-loved tracks of the 1990s.\n\n26. Weezer – “Beverly Hills”\n\nWhat was meant to be a sincere love letter to the lavish lifestyles of luxurious celebrities became twisted into a sarcastic swipe at showy superstars. It’s a catchy song and falls right in line with other Weezer anthems.\n\nThough not the most musically complex, Rubin did what he does best with Beverly Hill and made it a chart-topper. Band leader Rivers Cuomo points to this song as the defining moment that brought them from their niche into the mainstream and while not as interesting or as celebrated as their work from Pinkerton, Beverly Hills achieved its goal of garnering a bigger audience for the band.\n\n27. Linkin Park – “What I’ve Done”\n\nA far departure from anything they’d done previously, Rubin’s influence on Linkin Park could mirror his worth with many other artists that came before. Giving them the direction and guidance they needed to reinvent themselves the way they wanted to.\n\nLead singer Chester Bennington described this track as a way to “say goodbye to how we used to be” noting the band sounds instantly different than previous records and this was in part due to Rubin’s influence. Whether it was the right or wrong decision from the band is a mute argument due to its massively popular performance, being certified six times platinum and is far and away their most popular single.\n\nFor your tracks, why not grab the Soundiron Emotional Piano and let your softer side out?\n\n28. Metallica – “The Day That Never Comes”\n\nA progressive, thrashy window to their previous selves, “The Day That Never Comes” reminded people that Metallica are still the biggest and best metal band on the planet. Addressing the elephant in the room, it’s a bad-sounding track from a production-marred album, but nonetheless, we move.\n\nWhen a Metallica song starts with Hetfield’s signature clean tone and the track length runs into 7+ minutes, you know you’re in for a wild ride and that’s exactly what this song delivers.\n\nThough production-wise, Rubin’s influence is criticised, he brought Metallica back to their roots, focusing on being a band again and writing songs together, away from the convenience of technology and for that, got them back to doing what they do best, writing blistering metal!\n\nWithout Rubin, we may have seen a world without Metallica. They might have exploded into oblivion making a St. Anger Part 2.\n\nIf you want to get the sound of Death Magnetic, you’ll need distortion. Use the SSL Native X-Saturator on your master bus, and don’t be afraid to turn it up.\n\n29. Adele – “He Won’t Go”\n\nA tumultuous recording session arranged between Rubin and his cherry-picked band of musicians led to Adele returning to her original demos of many tracks that appeared on this album. However, some recordings were too good to be kept in the vault, with tracks like the soulful and vibrant “He Won’t Go”.\n\nIn the classic Adele sense, the pop/jazz chord progressions are outlined on a stunning piano recording. Get the sound of that for yourself with the Garritan Abbey Road Studios CFX Concert Grand Plug-In.\n\n30. Beastie Boys – “Rock Hard”\n\nThis pivotal track blends punk rock energy with hip-hop beats. Rubin’s production is raw and aggressive, featuring distorted guitars, punchy drums, and the Beastie Boys’ raucous vocals. The song’s composition is a fusion of rock and rap, a signature style that Rubin helped pioneer.\n\nThe track’s special quality lies in its rebellious spirit and innovative sound, breaking new ground in the music scene. Rubin’s hands-on approach in the studio captured the band’s raw energy and creativity, making “Rock Hard” a groundbreaking hit.\n\n31. Dixie Chicks – “Not Ready To Make Nice”\n\nA song of defiance and resilience in the face of adversity, Dixie Chicks got it done. Rubin’s production is bold and dynamic, featuring strong vocals, rich strings, and driving percussion. The song’s composition is dramatic, with poignant lyrics and a soaring chorus that highlights the band’s vocal harmonies.\n\nRubin’s influence ensures the track’s emotional intensity is fully realised, balancing the delicate verses with the powerful choruses. The song stands out for its raw honesty and strength, reflecting the band’s personal and political struggles with clarity and conviction.\n\n32. Tom Petty – “Wildflowers”\n\nA timeless ballad with a warm, acoustic sound, Wildflowers as an album always ranks highly among Petty’s best works. Rubin’s production is understated, focusing on Petty’s soothing vocals, gentle guitar strumming, and subtle harmonies.\n\nThe song’s composition is simple yet beautiful, with lyrics that evoke a sense of peace and introspection. Rubin’s approach preserves the organic feel of the track, ensuring that the heartfelt emotion and sincerity come through. What makes “Wildflowers” special is its purity and simplicity, capturing the essence of Petty’s artistry in a way that feels both intimate and expansive.\n\n33. Eminem – “Love Game (Featuring Kendrick Lamar)”\n\nEminem’s “Love Game” featuring Kendrick Lamar is a playful yet intricate track that showcases both artists’ lyrical prowess. Rubin’s production features a vintage rock sample, complemented by a bouncy beat and catchy hook. The song’s composition is marked by its witty wordplay and dynamic vocal performances, with Eminem and Lamar trading verses seamlessly.\n\nRubin’s influence ensures the production is tight and engaging, allowing the clever lyrics and energetic delivery to shine.\n\n34. Black Sabbath – “God Is Dead?”\n\nDoom personified. Black Sabbath proved that even in their 4th decade as a band, they still know how to pummel their way through energetic guitar riffs, killer vocal melodies, and a pounding rhythm section, while delivering the marauding atmosphere that captivated audiences all the way back on their debut.\n\nA perfect distillation of what makes a Black Sabbath song, “God Is Dead?” benefits from modern production techniques that capture the sheer heaviness and weight of all band members firing on all cylinders.\n\nEven with the absence of original drummer, Bill Ward, you could immediately tell this was a true Black Sabbath song from the first eerie lick that guitar wizard Iommi plays.\n\nThe unmistakable sound of Sabbath is Geezer’s bass sound. Although not an Ashdown emulation, the Bogren Digital Bassknob STD emulation of an Ampeg SVT classic sounds absolutely huge for thunderous finger-picked players.\n\n35. Justin Timberlake – “Another Song All Over Again”\n\nThis soulful ballad showcases Timberlake’s vocal range and emotive delivery. Rubin’s production is minimalistic, featuring a simple piano melody and subtle orchestration that supports the vocals. The song’s composition is elegant, with heartfelt lyrics and a poignant melody that captures the essence of longing and reflection.\n\nRubin’s touch ensures the arrangement is uncluttered, allowing Timberlake’s voice to take centre stage. What makes this track special is its simplicity and emotional depth, creating a powerful and moving listening experience.\n\n36. AC/DC – “Hard as a Rock”\n\nAn underrated track and album in a catalogue of the world’s biggest and best rock and roll albums, AC/DC’s “Hard As A Rock” is a head-bobbing rock-o-thon from start to finish. As to be expected when you put the Young brothers together, you’re going to get three chords, a catchy chorus with obligatory crowd participation chant, and a blistering solo.\n\nSometimes the simplest things work. A four-to-the-floor beat, a stack of Marshalls, three chords, and a subtle amount of innuendo have been (and continue to be) the gold-standard potion to create a rocking track.\n\n37. The Strokes – “The Adults Are Talking”\n\nWhen you think of the Strokes, you probably think of jangly guitars, tight drumming, and Julian Casablancas’ trademark vocals. Boxes ticked for “The Adults Are Talking!”\n\nRubin’s production brings a modern polish to the band’s classic garage rock sound. The instrumentation is crisp, with interlocking guitar riffs and a pulsating bass line that creates a propulsive rhythm. The song’s special quality lies in its blend of nostalgic elements and fresh energy, capturing the band’s essence while pushing their sound forward.\n\nRubin’s expertise ensures that each element is finely balanced, resulting in a track that’s both compelling and catchy.\n\n38. Linkin Park – “Burn It Down”\n\n“Burn It Down” by Linkin Park is a high-energy track that combines electronic elements with rock instrumentation. Rubin’s production enhances the song’s dynamic range, with soaring synths, heavy guitars, and a driving beat.\n\nThe interplay between Chester Bennington’s powerful vocals and Mike Shinoda’s rap verses creates a compelling contrast, making the track stand out. Rubin’s influence is evident in the song’s polished sound and tight arrangement, ensuring that every element, from the electronic flourishes to the pounding drums, contributes to the overall intensity and impact.\n\nEmbracing the electronic elements in later Linkin Park recordings, if you want a virtual synth that could handle every part of the discography, the Cherry Audio GX-80 will be your best bet.\n\n39. Slayer – “Seasons In The Abyss”\n\nContinuing almost exactly where Slayer left off with Reign In Blood and South of Heaven, “Seasons In The Abyss” doesn’t pull any punches with the production or the tracks. A standout in their catalogue, “Seasons In The Abyss” moulds the more melodic ideas explored on South Of Heaven with the relentless brutality of Reign In Blood to become Slayer’s most accessible song of their catalogue, even to this date.\n\n40. Jake Bugg – “Messed Up Kids”\n\n“Messed Up Kids” by Jake Bugg showcases a poignant narrative about the struggles of youth.

The stripped-back instrumentation creates an intimate atmosphere, making listeners feel the weight of the story being told. Rubin’s touch ensures the authenticity of Bugg’s sound, preserving the gritty, folk-rock vibe that has come to define his music.\n\n41.

Rubin’s production enhances the song’s groove with crisp beats and layered vocals, creating a polished yet edgy feel.\n\nThe instrumentation is minimalistic, focusing on the rhythmic strumming of Sheeran’s guitar and a syncopated drum pattern that drives the song forward.

The Smashing Pumpkins – “Silvery Sometimes (Ghosts)”\n\n“Silvery Sometimes (Ghosts)” by The Smashing Pumpkins is a melodic alternative rock track that harkens back to the band’s earlier sound. Rubin’s production is lush, with shimmering guitars, driving bass, and a steady drum beat that supports Billy Corgan’s distinctive vocals.\n\nThe song has an anthemic chorus and nostalgic vibe, capturing the essence of The Smashing Pumpkins’ signature style. Rubin’s influence ensures a clean, powerful mix that highlights the band’s intricate instrumentation and emotive lyrics, making it a memorable addition to their discography."
