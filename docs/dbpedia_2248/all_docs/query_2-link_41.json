        "text": "Death Angel lead guitarist Rob Cavestany was more excited than a kid on Christmas morning when he heard that his band—who've endured impressive highs and commensurate lows—was nominated for a GRAMMY for Best Metal Performance for \"Humanicide,\" the title track of the quintet's ninth album.\n\nThat excitement has only grown for the Northern California-bred metallers as the 62nd GRAMMY Awards show draws closer. We caught up with Cavestany right before the 2019 holidays—Death Angel was on tour, right up until their annual San Francisco hometown Christmas gigs. But the nomination was always in his head: \"When you're a kid, this is like what you dream of in the back of your mind. I respect and love all kinds of music and so many of the people I worship in music have earned this achievement.\" Plus, he notes, \"to top it off, Alicia Keys is hosting the GRAMMYs, and my love for Alicia Keys is well known.\"\n\nCavestany, who co-founded Death Angel with his cousins as a teenager in 1982, co-produced Humanicide. Lead vocalist Mark Osegueda joined in 1984; rhythm guitarist Ted Aguilar in 2001; while the rhythm section of drummer Will Carroll and bassist Damien Sisson, have been members for 11 years. If Cavestany's cousins are no longer members, Death Angel circa 2020 is very much a strong brotherhood, united by friendship, their fans and a passion for metal that includes cementing both DA's legacy and future. As the ebullient guitarist states: \"We're not going to stop. This is what we do. This is what we live for.\"\n\n2020 GRAMMY Awards: Complete Nominees List\n\nHow did you first learn about Death Angel’s GRAMMY nomination for Best Metal Performance?\n\nI was in my bunk on our tour bus. It was literally like 5:30 in the morning and I was just starting to fall asleep because I’m quite the night owl and I also get insomnia. Mark, our singer, got the news from a friend. She texted him and said, \"In about 15 minutes, they're going to release the information, but I just want you to know you're nominated.\" He had woken up to go to the bathroom and he saw his texts blowing up, and was like, \"What the hell?!\"\n\nHe came right over to my bunk and just started shaking me, \"Rob, Rob, wake up!\" At the very first I thought something terrible had happened. I could just see his face with the glow of his phone. He's like, \"Look at this text. We're nominated for a GRAMMY!\" Then we shook each other and we’re shaking hands and laughing. Then I just laid there going, \"Am I dreaming?\"\n\n<style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style><div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/OVDEMDxNNrQ' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n\nThe song is \"Humanicide,\" which gives the album its title. Can you tell me about the writing process?\n\nThe song has this very epic intro, so that's why it's the first song; it’s got this \"saying hello\" vibe, a very metal start to a song or record. I wrote that part when we were on tour with Slayer—us and Anthrax—for nine and a half weeks for our previous album [2016's The Evil Divide]. Being on tour with Slayer, you're inspired by some pretty heavy stuff. I watched their show night after night, being really, really impressed with their set and just how on top of their game they were. One of the nights on the bus, I wrote the foundation of the intro, the main, underlying rhythm. When we started writing for this new album, I was like, \"Where is that thing I wrote on the Slayer tour?\" I couldn't find it. I was searching like a surgeon! I found the piece started the writing off that.\n\nAnd then Mark is the lyricist?\n\nThen Mark got a hold of it and started working on the lyrics; I didn't hear the lyrics for that song until we were actually in the recording studio. The day he showed me the lyrics, right when I saw the title of the song I immediately knew it was going to be the title of the whole record. I was like, \"What does that mean? 'Humanicide?' That's a great word, like, how metal does it get?!\" I fell in love with the title before I even read the lyrics. I came into the studio and listened to what he sang, and it was one of those times where I just turned around and all I could do was give Mark a huge hug. I was like \"Oh my God, YES!\" The music and his lyrics and melody were just one of those natural pairings… boom!\n\nOne of the definitions of \"humanicide\" is the extinction of the human race by the human race.\n\nAnd let it be known that we are a very, very, positive and positive spirit and energy kind of people and band. All the dark topics and brutal things happening in our lyrics or in our concepts are meant as a message or warning; a wake-up call kind of thing. We're not saying it should happen, but it's where we're going if we continue like this, so we need to do something about it, so that kind of thing does not happen.\n\nHave you seen an increase in sales, streams, etc., since the GRAMMY nom?\n\nI haven't looked at those stats yet, but somehow it just explodes in a whole network of promotion in and of itself. Tons of people are congratulating us and tagging us and it's given us this whole amazing push. We're on cloud nine every night. There's a great part in our set where Mark introduces a song off our album called \"The Pack.\" Our fan club is called The Pack, and The Pack means us, our fans, the whole metal community. It's real inclusive; a unity kind of situation. When he's talking to the crowd, everyone's feeling it and all uniting in the spirit of metal. Then, then he drops it and says, \"By the way, we got this amazing news that we've been nominated for GRAMMY!\" And the way the crowd just explodes cheering for that! It's unlike any other, because they're so proud and they include themselves in it; Mark makes them included.\n\nYou've done a lot of records since 1982. What do you think coalesced in the world to make this GRAMMY nod happen now?\n\nI guess it's a number of factors. I wouldn't say \"Humanicide\" is our best song, though it is one of my favorite of ours. But we also have a lot other f**king killer songs and killer records that could have been in this position. It was more of a combination of everything over the last year. This album came out about six months ago, but before that, as we were approaching the album, we ramped up everything; our work ethic, our whole strategy. We kind of had to clean house. We had a different booking agent; we got a new management team—and we're self-managed now, basically. Within the band, we've defined each person's strong points and their forte and what we handle between me and Mark and Ted, and the other secret weapon is Ted's wife [Tricia Aguilar]. She's the person who's not in the band that's helping us, she's an amazing, brilliant woman who is very, very well versed in marketing and promotion. Also, we started to up our [stage] production, we got a new light guy. We invested a lot of money and time into what we're doing here. We have a team that is studying social media and our visibility exploded massively, like by the thousands. We don’t do anything weird or conform into some thing that's not us, but we're trying to use the weapons of choice properly.\n\nA difficult part of the Death Angel story is your 1990 tour bus accident. In Arizona, en route to Vegas, the bus crashed, and drummer Andy Galeon was critically injured, needing more than a year to recover. At the time, DA were slated to be the opening act for the 1991 Clash of the Titans tour featuring Megadeth, Slayer and Anthrax, but were replaced by Alice In Chains. From 1991–2001, Death Angel were essentially broken up. I can’t even imagine the depression and anguish that must have caused.\n\nYeah, absolutely. That was definitely, definitely one of the darkest points of my life. The dark cloud that we were living under… you just kept going, \"Why did this happen to us?\" We were rising, at the highest peak of what we were doing. We got a real hardcore lesson about how the business is, where if you're not moving forward then you're falling backwards. We were trying to stand still and recover from the shock of the accident happening. Soon as we stood still, our record label [Geffen] dropped us because we didn't immediately replace our drummer and get right back on the road supporting our album.\n\nRead More: Alice In Chains' Jerry Cantrell Is Just Happy To Be Nominated (For The Ninth Time)\n\nI think ultimately the karma points you earned from doing that is a win, though I know it certainly didn't feel like it.\n\nI agree with you. I've thought of that a million times, trying to process it, going through my mind and my soul. The only thing is how badly Andy, our drummer, got injured. We're all totally recovered, but he's got permanent scars. I could say \"Yeah, everything happens for a reason,\" because who knows what would've happened had we continued on? I think we would've peaked out and faded and we would never have been able to come back together again. But because we were forced to stop too soon and broke up the band right in the middle of everything, it forced us apart from each other. It forced us to do other things in life that we wouldn't have done.\n\nWe were just starting to go crazy; looking back at that point, I was like a whole different person. I was definitely drinking a lot and running around and getting really crazy. Everything was becoming surreal. I was getting lost in the non-reality of being, you know, a \"rock star.\" We were being put on a pedestal. We were rolling with two tour buses and hotel rooms every night and I had just turned 21 on that tour. I mean, we were already drinking heavily under 20, underage. But at that point, I was a party monster, and I think I would have gone down a bad road. When that accident happened, it shocked me so hard. I stopped partying; I stopped doing all that crazy shit. I don't know if I would have even survived or what kind of guy I would have been had that not happened.\n\nBut now you're here, nominated alongside Tool, Killswitch Engage and your peers!\n\nOut of the five [bands] in there, I honestly have to say—and Mark says on stage every night—we're the ones that are truly representing the metal sound of the metal category. All these guys have a metal thing kind of going on. But when you put those five records together and listen to them, and our album is the f**king metal record in there, that's for sure!\n\nWith the GRAMMYs thing going on, this is the highest high and the best push forward we have had since we got signed to Geffen and we had that feeling that something was happening for us. It's hard for me to allow myself to feel happy because Geffen jaded me so bad, it made me have such a wall up to protect myself from being hurt. I'm so cynical; like I don't think something good could happen to us. I'm accepting our grind and like, \"Well, this is what we do. It's punk rock forever, but at least I get to play music.\" I mean, even now, yesterday I just had my first shower in five days. We still live like that. We grind hard, but now everyone's in a really good mood though!\n\nAnd if you win?\n\nAgain, we are so conditioned to learning how to deal with bad news and sh*t happening to us that none of us had even mentioned to each other the possibility that we would win. We're just happy to be nominated. However! When you're alone in your bunk, thinking about it, at some points I'm like, \"Sh*t, I better prepare a speech, and what do we do win?!\" Of course I've played it out in my mind. Like if our name gets called, I could just see us like f**king totally in shock staring at each other. We are going to be hilarious because we are such the underdogs that it would be amazing. But um, yeah, we'll prepare a speech and hope and pray.\n\nAnd a room full of big names there!\n\nF**king right. Barbra Streisand over here and Lady Gaga there and I'm just going to go crazy 'cause I love these artists. I'm definitely not a one-dimensional metaller. I just hope I can speak to actually say \"hi\" and not just sit there like freaked out so hard! To me it's all about catching mojo. Every person's hand I can touch that that has \"it.\" Someone I respect and admire like that, I just want to get, get the mojo off them and give me some of that for whatever I do. Let me collect a little of the magic dust that's going around in that room.\n\nSuits, tuxes, black jeans?\n\nMy wife is shopping for me right now. We've definitely discussed that amongst ourselves. We can't go in there like some damn chumps! This is the f**king night of our f**king lives and we're going to take it for all it's worth because we may never ever—probably ever—experience something like this again. This is a culmination of almost four decades of giving up my whole life to music and Goddamn if we're not going to enjoy the hell out of it!\n\nWatch the 62nd GRAMMY Awards, airing live from the STAPLES Center in Los Angeles on Sunday, Jan. 26 on CBS.\n\nIdol continues to reckon with his demons — they both grappled with addiction during the '80s — and the singer is open about those struggles on the record and the page. (Idol's 2014 memoir Dancing With Myself, details a 1990 motorcycle accident that nearly claimed a leg, and how becoming a father steered him to reject hard drugs. \"Bitter Taste,\" from his last EP, The Roadside, reflects on surviving the accident.)\n\nAlthough Idol and Stevens split in the late '80s — the skilled guitarist fronted Steve Stevens & The Atomic Playboys, and collaborated with Michael Jackson, Rick Ocasek, Vince Neil, and Harold Faltermeyer (on the GRAMMY-winning \"Top Gun Anthem\") — their common history and shared musical bond has been undeniable. The duo reunited in 2001 for an episode of \"VH1 Storytellers\" and have been back in the saddle for two decades. Their union remains one of the strongest collaborations in rock 'n roll history.\n\nWhile there is recognizable personnel and a distinguishable sound throughout a lot of his work, Billy Idol has always pushed himself to try different things. Idol discusses his musical journey, his desire to constantly move forward, and the strong connection that he shares with Stevens.\n\nSteve has said that you like to mix up a variety of styles, yet everyone assumes you're the \"Rebel Yell\"/\"White Wedding\" guy. But if they really listen to your catalog, it's vastly different.\n\nYeah, that's right. With someone like Steve Stevens, and then back in the day Keith Forsey producing... [Before that] Generation X actually did move around inside punk rock. We didn't stay doing just the Ramones two-minute music. We actually did a seven-minute song. [Laughs]. We did always mix things up.\n\nThen when I got into my solo career, that was the fun of it. With someone like Steve, I knew what he could do. I could see whatever we needed to do, we could nail it. The world was my oyster musically.\n\n\"Cage\" is a classic-sounding Billy Idol rocker, then \"Running From The Ghost\" is almost metal, like what the Devil's Playground album was like back in the mid-2000s. \"Miss Nobody\" comes out of nowhere with this pop/R&B flavor. What inspired that?\n\nWe really hadn't done anything like that since something like \"Flesh For Fantasy\" [which] had a bit of an R&B thing about it. Back in the early days of Billy Idol, \"Hot In The City\" and \"Mony Mony\" had girls [singing] on the backgrounds.\n\nWe always had a bit of R&B really, so it was actually fun to revisit that. We just hadn't done anything really quite like that for a long time. That was one of the reasons to work with someone like Sam Hollander [for the song \"Rita Hayworth\"] on The Roadside. We knew we could go [with him] into an R&B world, and he's a great songwriter and producer. That's the fun of music really, trying out these things and seeing if you can make them stick.\n\nI listen to new music by veteran artists and debate that with some people. I'm sure you have those fans that want their nostalgia, and then there are some people who will embrace the newer stuff. Do you find it’s a challenge to reach people with new songs?\n\nObviously, what we're looking for is, how do we somehow have one foot in the past and one foot into the future? We’ve got the best of all possible worlds because that has been the modus operandi of Billy Idol.\n\nYou want to do things that are true to you, and you don't just want to try and do things that you're seeing there in the charts today. I think that we're achieving it with things like \"Running From The Ghost\" and \"Cage\" on this new EP. I think we’re managing to do both in a way.\n\n**Obviously, \"Running From The Ghost\" is about addiction, all the stuff that you went through, and in \"Cage\" you’re talking about freeing yourself from a lot of personal shackles. Was there any one moment in your life that made you really thought I have to not let this weigh me down anymore?**\n\nI mean, things like the motorcycle accident I had, that was a bit of a wake up call way back. It was 32 years ago. But there were things like that, years ago, that gradually made me think about what I was doing with my life. I didn't want to ruin it, really. I didn't want to throw it away, and it made [me] be less cavalier.\n\nI had to say to myself, about the drugs and stuff, that I've been there and I've done it. There’s no point in carrying on doing it. You couldn't get any higher. You didn't want to throw your life away casually, and I was close to doing that. It took me a bit of time, but then gradually I was able to get control of myself to a certain extent [with] drugs and everything. And I think Steve's done the same thing. We're on a similar path really, which has been great because we're in the same boat in terms of lyrics and stuff.\n\nSo a lot of things like that were wake up calls. Even having grandchildren and just watching my daughter enlarging her family and everything; it just makes you really positive about things and want to show a positive side to how you're feeling, about where you're going. We've lived with the demons so long, we've found a way to live with them. We found a way to be at peace with our demons, in a way. Maybe not completely, but certainly to where we’re enjoying what we do and excited about it.\n\n[When writing] \"Running From The Ghost\" it was easy to go, what was the ghost for us? At one point, we were very drug addicted in the '80s. And Steve in particular is super sober [now]. I mean, I still vape pot and stuff. I don’t know how he’s doing it, but it’s incredible. All I want to be able to do is have a couple of glasses of wine at a restaurant or something. I can do that now.\n\nI think working with people that are super talented, you just feel confident. That is a big reason why you open up and express yourself more because you feel comfortable with what's around you.\n\nI remember when you went on \"Viva La Bam\" back in 2005 and decided to give Bam Margera’s Lamborghini a new sunroof by taking a power saw to it. Did he own that car? Was that a rental?\n\nI think it was his car.\n\nDid he get over it later on?\n\nHe loved it. [Laughs] He’s got a wacky sense of humor. He’s fantastic, actually. I’m really sorry to see what he's been going through just lately. He's going through a lot, and I wish him the best. He's a fantastic person, and it's a shame that he's struggling so much with his addictions. I know what it's like. It's not easy.\n\nMusically, what is the synergy like with you guys during the past 10 years, doing Kings and Queens of the Underground and this new stuff? What is your working relationship like now in this more sober, older, mature version of you two as opposed to what it was like back in the '80s?\n\nIn lots of ways it’s not so different because we always wrote the songs together, we always talked about what we're going to do together. It was just that we were getting high at the same time.We're just not getting [that way now] but we're doing all the same things.\n\nWe're still talking about things, still [planning] things:What are we going to do next? How are we going to find new people to work with? We want to find new producers. Let's be a little bit more timely about putting stuff out.That part of our relationship is the same, you know what I mean? That never got affected. We just happened to be overloading in the '80s.\n\nThe relationship’s… matured and it's carrying on being fruitful, and I think that's pretty amazing. Really, most people don't get to this place. Usually, they hate each other by now. [Laughs] We also give each other space. We're not stopping each other doing things outside of what we’re working on together. All of that enables us to carry on working together. I love and admire him. I respect him. He's been fantastic. I mean, just standing there on stage with him is always a treat. And he’s got an immensely great sense of humor. I think that's another reason why we can hang together after all this time because we've got the sense of humor to enable us to go forward.\n\nThere's a lot of fan reaction videos online, and I noticed a lot of younger women like \"Rebel Yell\" because, unlike a lot of other '80s alpha male rock tunes, you're talking about satisfying your lover.\n\nIt was about my girlfriend at the time, Perri Lister. It was about how great I thought she was, how much I was in love with her, and how great women are, how powerful they are.\n\nIt was a bit of a feminist anthem in a weird way. It was all about how relationships can free you and add a lot to your life. It was a cry of love, nothing to do with the Civil War or anything like that. Perri was a big part of my life, a big part of being Billy Idol. I wanted to write about it. I'm glad that's the effect.\n\nIs there something you hope people get out of the songs you've been doing over the last 10 years? Do you find yourself putting out a message that keeps repeating?\n\nWell, I suppose, if anything, is that you can come to terms with your life, you can keep a hold of it. You can work your dreams into reality in a way and, look, a million years later, still be enjoying it.\n\nThe only reason I'm singing about getting out of the cage is because I kicked out of the cage years ago. I joined Generation X when I said to my parents, \"I'm leaving university, and I'm joining a punk rock group.\" And they didn't even know what a punk rock group was. Years ago, I’d write things for myself that put me on this path, so that maybe in 2022 I could sing something like \"Cage\" and be owning this territory and really having a good time. This is the life I wanted.\n\nThe original UK punk movement challenged societal norms. Despite all the craziness going on throughout the world, it seems like a lot of modern rock bands are afraid to do what you guys were doing. Do you think we'll see a shift in that?\n\nYeah. Art usually reacts to things, so I would think eventually there will be a massive reaction to the pop music that’s taken over — the middle of the road music, and then this kind of right wing politics. There will be a massive reaction if there's not already one. I don’t know where it will come from exactly. You never know who's gonna do [it].\n\nLiving Legends: Nancy Sinatra Reflects On Creating \"Power And Magic\" In Studio, Developing A Legacy Beyond \"Boots\" & The Pop Stars She Wants To Work With"
