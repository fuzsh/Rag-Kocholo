As of June 1st, it is available for pre-order HERE.\n\nRaised By Rap is emblematic of Hip Hop history with hits from across all decades. The compilation showcases the legacy and footprint Sony Music Entertainment artists have had on the genre. Rob Base & DJ EZ Rock [“It Takes Two”] and RUN DMC [“It’s Tricky”] rep the eighties, while Wu-Tang Clan [“C.R.E.A.M. (Cash Rules Everything Around Me)”] and Nas [“NY State of Mind”] highlight the nineties. OutKast [“Ms. Jackson”] soundtracks the turn-of-the-century, and Lil Nas X [“Old Town Road” (feat. Billy Ray Cyrus) (Remix)] and BIA [“Whole Lotta Money”] signal the genre’s future right now.\n\nThe compilation spans eras of Hip Hop and illustrates its constant evolution with careful curation and expansive scope unlike anything else in the culture right now.\n\nIt arrives on the heels of a series of high-profile releases by Certified—the digital destination platform celebrating SME’s Hip Hop catalogs.
