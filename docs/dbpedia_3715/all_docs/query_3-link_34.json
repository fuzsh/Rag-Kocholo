        "text": "Back in 2018, Sony’s Paris-based CSL lab produced one of the first AI-generated songs that grabbed the attention – and stoked the fears – of songwriters everywhere: Daddy’s Car. Except that perhaps, with hindsight, that Beatles-y song didn’t quite help foster wider understanding both about AI music creation, or the artist-oriented ambitions of CSL (Daddy’s Car was, for instance, mostly human-created with limited AI input.)\n\nNow it’s launching a new AI model, called Diff-A-Riff, which is pitched as a “co-creator” and that generates instrumental accompaniments for artists’ music.\n\nSome of the functions will be of interest to songwriters – one functionality demonstrated in the launch video is where a songwriter uploads a vocal performance, and then suggests, via text prompt, musical accompaniments – which the AI model then interpolates.\n\nIt also demonstrates other useful tools, like turning a mono track into stereo, regenerating drum tracks into other forms of percussion, and more.\n\nWhile AI tools that spit out a whole song are making the headlines, it’s these kind of AI assistant tools that are fast becoming a major use-case of AI in the future creation of “human” music."
