        "text": "‘Glamorous Sky’ is probably among one of the most important songs in modern JRock to be honest. Which is a bit strange to say since it was created for a live action movie, by a manga artist, who collaborated with the JRock god HYDE. And since it’s initial release this is easily one of the most covered JRock tunes ever by professional singers and amateurs alike.\n\nReleased on August 31st, 2005 “Glamorous Sky” is a single by Mika Nakshima. She was the vocalist on the track which had been written by Ai Yazawa, the author of the manga NANA, for the feature live action film that would be released September 28th, 2005. HYDE of L’Arc-en-Ciel and VAMPS composed the music for the lyrics. The song would be featured on Nakashima’s album “The End” and again on the “Nana Movie: Original Soundtrack”.\n\nThe song rocketed to the #1 on the weekly Oricon charts, and ended the year at #10. This single stayed on the chart for 28 weeks, and the only single Mika Nakashima has had to debut at the #1 spot. The single in total sold 444,067 copies.\n\nThe song is iconic since it is the song from NANA that everyone knows. Even people who had never read the series, watched the anime or even the movie know about this track when it’s mentioned. Officially, it’s also been covered several times.\n\nOf course there is the original:\n\nThen by Acid Black Cherry\n\nOf course, then by Hyde the composer and this band VAMPS\n\nAnd most recently and why I decided to write about this, Shin’s version\n\nSome other notable musicians who have covered this track is ex-Kara member Goo Hara, Kim Jaejoong of JYJ, and even soloist GACKT. Of course, there are also hundreds of other covers available on Youtube.\n\nBut, WHY is this song so popular? What gives a song like this, created by a mangka for a live action film such power?\n\nThe first part is that Mika Nakashima, on top of singing the original version, was also NANA in the film. Having a vocalist cast as Nana was the best move the casting director made, since it makes everything more real. There’s no one ‘acting’ like they’re singing “Glamorous Sky”, she IS singing. However, it’s cast a shadow that Mika Nakshima has yet to get out of. While she has strong sales as a soloist, as herself, she’s never quite gotten as popular as she was during filming.\n\nSecondly it’s not a stretch for a few artists that they would eventually cover it. For HYDE it was only a matter of time that he got behind the mic and sang it himself since he composed it. With SHIN, he admitted that his long standing stage name from when he was part of ViViD, was a homage to the fictional bassist Shin in NANA.\n\nPart of the appeal, honestly is the nostalgia factor for many. NANA has not updated since 2009 and has remained on hiatus since. Yazawa Sensei has teased some art of the characters, but has not given any clues as to when the next update will come. Girls and guys alike still skim the pages of the manga fondly when they can be found. For the western audience, it’s a throwback to the magazine “Shoujo Beat” since NANA and Hachi both graced the cover several times, as well were a long standing staple. NANA has always been a source of happiness, of hope for reader’s globally. Hearing ‘Glamorous Sky’ is just the vocal embodiment of that hope.\n\nNot to mention, the song isn’t dated. When you look at both the Japanese and English lyrics, there’s a bunch of different emotions floating around in it. It’s a song of heartbreak and separation. It’s a song of daily life of Nana, that girls globally have coveted. It’s a song of hope. One day the glamorous sky will come, your life will change, the manga will update…\n\nGlamorous Sky, extends beyond the scope of the movies and beyond even Mika Nakashima. For many of us it’s a song of our generation, one where the world seemed a whole lot simpler. And for every new cover of the song to come out that message, heartbreak, daily life, hope and more gets a little strong."
