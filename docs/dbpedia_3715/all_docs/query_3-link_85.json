        "text": "KUALA LUMPUR, March 13, 2012: His songs are known for their ability to evoke powerful emotions amongst his listeners and his message of peace and tolerance has a lasting impact upon millions of his admirers.\n\nThe internationally renowned singer, songwriter, composer, multi-instrumentalist and UN Celebrity Partner for World Food Program, Sami Yusuf has released his latest album entitled, ‘Wherever You Are’ in Malaysia through Sony Music.\n\nCentering on the theme of hope, loss and betrayal, the songs in ‘Wherever You Are’ invoke the inherent good that lies within every heart. The album presents a further evolution of his self-coined genre, ‘Spiritique’. Sami defines Spiritique as “music that infuses oriental and occidental harmonics, underpinned with the essence of spirituality that celebrates not only every person’s individual spirit but also the collective spirit of mankind”.\n\nThe album, under exclusive license to Sony Music Malaysia was recorded in the United Kingdom, South Africa, Egypt, New York and the United Arab Emirates. Compared to his first two albums, the songs in ‘Wherever You Are’ were written, composed and recorded mostly in English in order to expand the album’s outreach.\n\n‘Wherever You Are’ is the third official album released by Sami, following a collective 10 million sales of his previous two albums – ‘Al-Mu`allim’ (2003) and ‘My Ummah’ (2005). ‘Wherever You Are’ comprises of 11 songs, composed and produced by Sami himself. He had also penned the lyrics of eight songs for the album.\n\n‘Wherever You Are’ gave Sami the opportunity to collaborate with a number of icons in the music world. The iconic rock legend, Ian Brown has penned the lyrics for ‘Give The Young A Chance’, a song about faith and hope for the younger generation. ‘In Every Tear, He Is There,’ and ‘Without You’ were written by UK singer-songwriter and producer Conner Reeves, who has worked with renowned artists such as Rod Stewart, Tina Turner and Joss Stone. ‘Wherever You Are’ also features the work of Turkish mega-star, Sezen Aksu, who wrote the lyrics for ‘Without You’. The album also features the South African choir, best known for their hauntingly hypnotic Oscar-winning performance for the soundtrack of Disney’s ‘The Lion King’.\n\nThe songs in ‘Wherever You Are’ are:\n\n1) Wherever You Are\n\n2) Salaam\n\n3) Without You\n\n4) You Came To Me\n\n5) Give the Young a Chance\n\n6) Trials of Life\n\n7) Worry Ends\n\n8- Fragile World\n\n9) In Every Tear, He Is There\n\n10) Make Me Strong\n\n11) No Word Is Worthy\n\n‘Wherever You Are’ is available in all music retail outlets.\n\nFor more information, please visit www.samiyusufofficial.com\n\nFor further information, kindly contact:\n\nETM INTERNATIONAL – ASIA PACIFIC REP OFFICE (MARKETING & COMMUNICATIONS)\n\nNabila Khan – Tel: +971 (0) 4 3132061/ marketing@etminternational.com\n\nSONY MUSIC ENTERTAINMENT MALAYSIA SDN BHD"
