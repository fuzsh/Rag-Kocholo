        "text": "Mika Nakashima was born on February 19th of the year 1983 in Kagoshima prefecture, Japan. Ever since she was a child, Mika loved to sing, and all she wanted to be when she grew up was a singer. Instead of going to college, Mika started competing in the music industry and modelling business at the age of 17 when she sent a demo tape to Sony records.\n\nMika was lucky enough to be chosen to sing the theme song of a new drama called &#8220;Kizu darake no Love Song&#8221;. The song was released as her first single STARS, which sold 60,000 copies and came in at third place on the Japanese Oricon charts.\n\nMika&#8217;s other singles all made the top ten of the charts, but on August 28th of 2002, Mika broke through to 1st place with her bebut alum TRUE. And since then, Mika Nakashima has been a top selling Japanese artist for Sony. Mika&#8217;s second album LOVE, released on November 6th of 2003, sold over a million copies, and maintained a nr. 1 spot on the charts for many weeks.\n\nMika did two Live Tours, one in 2003 and another one in 2004. Her Love tour actually sold out within two minutes! She toured 24 cities and went to 36 stages. Her final concert in the Tokyo International Forum was visited by 100,000 people! Mika became so popular that everything she made immediately sold out. Her limited edition single, Kiss, for example, sold out within the first day, which was 100,000 copies. Mika is known as one of the best live performers of Japan because of her natural voice and emotion.\n\nMika sang songs for the animes Mobile Suit Gundam SEED and Hi no Tori (Phoenix), and she is featured on many Jpop compilation songs. With her exquisite beauty, mature lyrics and unquestionable style, Mika has become a great pop idol in the last two years. The main focus of Mika&#8217;s music has become a Jazz/Pop style that has made her stand out from generic pop artists. This talented young woman is surely one of Japan&#8217;s fastest rising stars. For the past year, Mika has been the celebrity spokeswoman for Kanebo cosmetics&#8217; &#8220;KATE&#8221; products. Her music videos for Seven, Fake, and Kumo no Ito are all used in Kanebo KATE commericials.\n\nShe Currently released her 24th single"
