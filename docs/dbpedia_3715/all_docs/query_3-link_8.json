        "text": "NEW YORK, Oct. 4, 2012 /PRNewswire/ -- Columbia Records -- Following Adele's premiere of her latest recording \"Skyfall,\" the official theme song to the upcoming 007 adventure of the same name, globally via her official site (http://adele.tv) at 0:07 BST/London time October 5th, the track is now available to purchase as a download at iTunes (http://smarturl.it/AdeleSkyfall). October 5(th) marks the 50th anniversary of the release of Dr. No, and thus the James Bond film franchise, and will be celebrated as Global James Bond Day.\n\n(Photo: http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20121004/NY87566 )\n\nAfter a 90 second clip of the track leaked earlier this week, fans and critics have lined up to praise the \"Skyfall\" theme, with the Evening Standard calling Adele the \"Best Bond singer since Shirley Bassey,\" The Daily Telegraph describing it as \"A Bond song that stirs the heart\", and the LA Times saying, \"Though only about 90 seconds, what's available of Adele's 'Skyfall' seems to hint at the classic Bond themes of yore,\" whilst The Guardian called it \"A deliciously languid ballad.\"\n\nThe lyric video to \"Skyfall\" can also be seen at http://adele.tv.\n\nAfter reading the script for the film, Adele enlisted Paul Epworth to co-write and produce the theme song to \"Skyfall™.\" Adele admits, \"I was a little hesitant at first to be involved with the theme song for Skyfall. There's a lot of instant spotlight and pressure when it comes to a Bond song. But I fell in love with the script and Paul had some great ideas for the track and it ended up being a bit of a no brainer to do it in the end. It was also a lot of fun writing to a brief, something I've never done, which made it exciting. When we recorded the strings it was one of the proudest moments of my life. I'll be back combing my hair when I'm 60 telling people I was a Bond girl back in the day I'm sure!\" Recorded at Abbey Road Studios in London, \"Skyfall\" features the lush accompaniment of a 77-piece orchestra.\n\n\"Skyfall\" is the first recording by Adele since releasing her massively successful album 21 in early 2011. To date 21 has sold over 24 million albums worldwide and garnered Adele 6 Grammy Awards, 2 BRIT Awards and 2 Ivor Novello Awards.\n\n\"Skyfall™\" the movie will be released on October 26, 2012 in the UK and on November 9, 2012 in the U.S.\n\nAbout SKYFALL™\n\nDaniel Craig is back as Ian Fleming's James Bond 007 in SKYFALL™, the 23rd adventure in the longest-running film franchise of all time. In SKYFALL, Bond's loyalty to M is tested as her past comes back to haunt her. As MI6 comes under attack, 007 must track down and destroy the threat, no matter how personal the cost. The film is from Albert R. Broccoli's EON Productions, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios, and Sony Pictures Entertainment. Directed by Sam Mendes. Produced by Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli. Written by Neal Purvis & Robert Wade and John Logan.\n\nSOURCE Columbia Records\n\nPhoto:http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20121004/NY87566\n\nhttp://photoarchive.ap.org/\n\nSOURCE: Columbia Records\n\nAdele's \"Skyfall\", Official Theme Song To Latest James Bond 007 Feature SKYFALL™, Globally Available On iTunes Now\"SKYFALL\" RELEASE TO COINCIDE WITH 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF JAMES BOND 007\n\nPR Newswire\n\nCONTACT: Benny Tarantini, Columbia Records, Benny.Tarantini@SonyMusic.com, +1-212-833-5858"
