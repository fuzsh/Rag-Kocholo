        "text": "****\n\nIt’s been a while since I’ve last heard about Mika and news about her new single reminded me how much I used to fangirl her. I first discovered her music “Sunao no Mama” which was featured in an ad and I was blown away. Her voice has a distinct quality to it—it’s deep, melancholic yet she can reach high notes and can croon any type of songs, from reggae, ballad, RnB, to rock!\n\nA while back I made a post about J/KPOP album covers HERE and I noted how Mika always comes up with the most artistic images. This time she tries on a Moulin Rouge inspired concept. Very classy and vintage. It looks like something you’d see on the cover of Vanity Fair. Love it!\n\nFun Trivia:\n\n– From a young age, she wanted to become a singer, and decided not to attend high school or college. At the age of 17, she was chosen from 3,000 girls to be the heroine of the Fall 2001 Fuji TV drama, Kizudarake no Love Song (Tainted Love Song).\n\n– She made a debut with her single “Stars,” with a follow-up 80’s inspired song called “Crescent Moon,” which is a song that I highly recommend. It’s something that you wouldn’t expect from Mika, as she is known for more mellow songs. It has a really fun and upbeat tone!\n\n– Her debut album went on to become number one in Oricon Charts because she fused jazz, and contemporary pop—something fresh and unique in the candy cutesy pop infested JPOPdom.\n\n– If you watched Im Soo Jung and So Ji Sub’s drama “I’m Sorry I Love You,” Mika Nakashima’s song “Yuki no Hana” was sung by Park Hyo Shin and was made as the OST. Yes, it’s the heartbreaking song that blares every now and then in the drama. I swear, that drama is so hard to take just because it was so good! I’ve never felt so depressed after watching a drama ever before! So Ji Sup is an extremely amazing actor, and unexpectedly he and Im Soo Jung had a lovely chemistry together, but the ending was so damn sad!\n\nMika’s debut in the movie scene was in the live action version of the tremendous hit manga “Nana,” as a budding rock star who meets a girl extremely opposite from her, not knowing that she’d find a lifelong friend. She also sang one of the theme songs for the movie, which was released as a single under the name “Nana starring Mika Nakashima”. The single, titled Glamorous Sky,” was written by the manga’s author, Ai Yazawa, and composed by vocalist Hyde!\n\n***\n\nMika’s flair for fashion\n\nFrom glam to rock\n\n…. and sometimes grotesque fashion concepts\n\nClassic beauty\n\nOn a random note, who rocked this dress better? Mika Nakashima or Leighton Meester a.k.a. Blair Waldorf?\n\n****\n\nCredit: mikanakashima.com, jpopmusic.com"
