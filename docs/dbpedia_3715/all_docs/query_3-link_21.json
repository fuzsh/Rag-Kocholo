        "text": "Sony Music Entertainment is an American music company owned by Sony Entertainment. It was founded in 1929 as American Record Corporation, it was acquired by the Columbia Broadcasting System in 1938 and renamed Columbia Recording Corporation. In 1966, the company was reorganized to become CBS Records.\n\nMichael Jackson and the Jacksons signed to CBS Records in 1975 following their dissatisfaction with Motown. Sony bought CBS Records for $2 billion in January 1988, and renamed it to Sony Music Entertainment in 1991. It split into two separate labels, Epic Records and Columbia Records. Michael and his brothers stayed with Epic and are signed to it to this day. On March 21 of that year, Michael also signed a long-term contract with Sony to extend his Epic Records deal with six more albums, and an agreement to make feature films, shorts and more.[1]\n\nSony/ATV catalog[]\n\nFollowing what was initially a joke between Paul McCartney and Jackson, in 1985 Michael bought half of the Sony/ATV catalog with help of John Branca. This way Jackson owned rights to discographies of such as The Beatles.\n\nThe company bought back the half of their publishing from the Michael Jackson Estate in 2016.[2]\n\nConflict[]\n\nJackson's and Sony's first conflicts started in 1997, as the company started to try and control Michael and his work. The artist wanted the rights to his songs to revert back early in the new decade. The label however turned their back on him and extended the copyright.\n\nThis created a conflict of interest between the two parties, with Michael deciding it was time to leave the label, so he could manage everything by himself, without having to pay them a bigger part of the benefits. Following Tommy Mottola being notified of Jackson's requests, Branca helped Sony re-write contracts that tied Michael to them.[3] The company decided to butcher the promotion for Invincible, making it perform weaker compared to previous releases. Additionally, Michael couldn't release songs he wanted as singles and ideas for many music videos had to be shelved. As it also turned out, Jackson's lawyer who represented him in the case worked for Sony, having the singer unaware of such.[4]\n\nPublic statement[]\n\nNot even a year after its release, Sony Music suddenly stopped promoting the project. Michael concluded, that they're trying to sabotage his own album. In July of 2002, Michael Jackson made a public statement, protesting against the company.\n\nJackson also added, that Tommy Mottola used the N-Word on an unidentified black artist. Michael called Mottola \"mean, a racist and very, very, very devilish.\"[5] This became one of the biggest moments in the popculture history.\n\nAnyway, I first let me say, I really don’t like to talk that much. I really don’t. I prefer performing than talking. Let me just say this… The tradition of great performers… the tradition of great performers from — I really want you to know what I say! — from Sammy Davis Junior, to James Brown, to Jackie Wilson, to Fred Astaire, Gene Kelly. The story is usually the same though. These guys worked really hard at their craft, for the story ends the same. They are usually broken, torn and usually just sad, because the companies take advantage of them, they really do. And… Sony…Sony… Being the artist that I am, at Sony I’ve generated several billion dollars for Sony, several billon. They really thought that my mind is always on music and dancing. It usually is, but they never thought that this performer — myself — would out think them. So, we can’t let them get away with what they’re trying to do, because now I’m a free agent… I just owe Sony one more album. It’s just a box set, really, with two new songs which I’ve written ages ago. Because for every album that I record, I write — literally, I’m telling you the truth — I write at least 120 songs every album I do. So I can do the box set, just giving them any two songs. So I’m leaving Sony, a free agent,… owning half of Sony! I own half of Sony’s Publishing. I’m leaving them, and they’re very angry at me, because I just did good business, you know. So the way they get revenge is to try and destroy my album! But I’ve always said, you know, art — good art — never dies. …Thank you. And Tommy Mottola is a devil! I’m not supposed to say what I’m going to say right now, but I have let you know this. Please don’t videotape what I am going to say, ok? Turn that off please. Do it, do it, I don’t mind! Tape it! Mariah Carey, after divorcing Tommy, came to me crying. Crying. She was crying so badly I had to hold her. She said to me, “This is an evil man, and Michael, this man follows me.” He taps her phones, and he’s very, very evil. She doesn’t trust him. He’s a horrible human being. And we have to continue our drive until he is terminated. We can’t allow him to do this to great artists, we just can’t. I just wanted to let you know, I appreciate everything you’ve done, you’ve been amazing. You’re so loyal! Diana, everybody, Waldo, all the people here! I love you all. You’ve been amazing, I love you! But still, but still, I promise you, the best is yet to come!\n\nCredits for the transcription: truemichaeljackson.com[6]\n\nAt the time, Jackson also attended protests organized by fans, supporting the act and even holding fans' signs, like \"Sony Is Phoney\" or \"Sony Sucks\".\n\nAs the artist stated in his speech, he eventually left Sony Music while owning half of their publishing and a year later a compilation titled Number Ones was released.\n\nPost-death[]\n\nAfter Michael's death, Sony faced even more controversies, especially after the fiasco with three songs on Jackson's first posthumous album, Michael, clearly not being performed by the King of Pop but by an impersonator.\n\nPurchase of the MIJAC catalog[]\n\nIn February 2023, reports came out of Sony Music negotiating a possible purchase of half of Michael‘s publishing and recorded masters catalog from the Michael Jackson Estate.[7] The purchase was successful and closed on February 9, 2024, having paid $600 million. The catalog itself values $1.2 billion.[8] The future releases however will still be controlled by the Estate.\n\n\"As we have always maintained, we would never give up management or control of Michael Jackson’s assets.\"\n\n— John Branca on managing future releases, \"Sony Reaches Blockbuster Deal for Michael Jackson’s Catalog\" - The New York Times, February 9, 2024[9]\n\nThe deal also includes not only Jackson's songs, but other artists in the Mijac catalog; Sly & the Family Stone, Jackie Wilson, Ray Charles, Jerry Lee Lewis, Curtis Mayfield. Percy Sledge and Dion.[8]\n\nThe deal doesn't include royalties from MJ the Musical or other Michael Jackson-related productions.[8]\n\nIn the aftermath of the deal, Sony Music began to block use of Jackson's songs and music videos outside of U.S.[10]"
