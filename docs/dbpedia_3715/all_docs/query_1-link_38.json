        "text": "Popular vocalist Mika Nakashima announced that she will be releasing a brand new album, JOKER, October 7. To honor her twentieth year in the Japanese music industry, this will be her latest album release since TOUGH back in 2017 and will be her ninth album overall. The album will drop with fourteen tracks and include hit song “KISS OF DEATH” and “A or B” along with Nakashima’s self-composed rock number “Justice”. The album will drop with two editions including a CD-only standard edition and a CD+DVD limited edition. The DVD will include not only music videos of several tracks from the album but also a special acoustic studio live.\n\nNakashima commented about the album, stating, “It’s been about three and a half years since I released an original album, but thanks to that I got various amounts of different tunes and emotions that I want to tell. I feel that this has become a piece that I will never get tired of listening to as I look forward to sharing this with the fans. It's my 20th anniversary in the industry but I don't have many chances to meet fans directly due to the pandemic right now, but I'm looking forward to seeing them again, live with this album.”\n\nFor those who are not familiar with Nakashima’s work, check out her song “雪の華” (“Yuki no Hana”) along with the pre-order links for JOKER below!\n\nStandard edition"
