She has also starred in movies, most notably portraying 1 of the two characters named Nana in the Nana movies that are based on the manga of the same name. She played the role of a singer. She was born the 3rd of 3 girls in Hioki, Kagoshima & dreamed of working in the fashion industry, but not as a model. Earlier, she had imagined herself a nurse. She passed an audition at 17, leading to an acting-cum-vocalist role for Tainted Love Song. By this time, she had quit school. By 2002, she was awarded the New Artist Of the Year award at the Japan Gold Disc Awards. She was given roles in American films, namely 2 Resident Evils. The 1st was in 2010 , where she acted & sang the theme song. That year, she had a health scare involving her larynx, but was soon back & even went blonde by 2012. She married volleyball player Kunihiro Shimizu on December 25, 2014. She loves white rice & mayonnaise, but not necessarily together or at the same time."
