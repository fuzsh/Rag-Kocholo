Vocal deep fakes routinely take TikTok by storm, replicating the voices of artists like Taylor Swift, Post Malone and Olivia Rodrigo. Be that as it may, ever progressing AI programs can do more than just mirror performers - there are developing fears that they may start to replace musicians, producers and threaten an artist's career within the recording industry.\n\nOne case is the AI produced prediction of Taylor Swift's track \"Fortnight\" with Post Malone, which went viral before the release of The Tortured Poets Department album.\n\nThe track was met with endorsement by music lovers, having been made with no individual association from either artist. In later years, however, we have seen artists and major record labels within the music industry beginning to push back against AI produced music.\n\nSony Music Group's letter to over 700 software designers reveals a fear that AI technology now encroaches on the value of human artistry and copyright possession within the music business.\n\n+How to Navigate Copyright and Licensing in Today's Music Industry\n\nArtists push back against AI produced music\n\nEarlier in the year, we saw hundreds of artists, performing artists, and music creators, including Cardi B, Bonnie Raitt, and Elvis Costello, join the petition from the Human Artistry Campaign. The No AI Fraud Act promised to defend your essential human right to your voice and likeness, ensuring everybody is protected from non consensual deep fakes. While our digital environment is rapidly adjusting to a new market of AI produced music and craftsmanship, creatives are aiming to confine its impact in order to protect the initial value of their work.\n\nIn April, we saw artists including Nicki Minaj, Billie Eillish, and Billy Porter join the open letter from the Artist Rights Alliance, which called on AI developers to not create AI technology that undermines or replaces the human creativity of lyricists and artists. The letter addresses how AI unique melodies can sabotage creativity and weaken the work of lyricists, who are a fundamental part of the recording industry.\n\nThe current unsuitable wage of songwriters was brought to public consideration by six time BRIT award winner Raye, who contended that writers are already severely underpaid. Talking to Wired, the artist said,'songwriters you are benefiting from are broke, can't manage rent. On the off chance that music made by AI generators proceeds to gain the approval of the general public, are the careers of lyricists under threat of being further undermined - or even totally replaced?\n\n+Indie Musicians: 5 Reasons Why AI Is Not a Threat\n\nSony Music Group Restricts AI Developers\n\nSony Music Group said on May 16 that they believe in the importance of human artistry and announced a way for people to choose not to have their music used to train artificial intelligence. This has gone beyond open letters, saying that AI software can't use its catalogue and fighting for songwriters and artists to be protected from AI copying.\n\nThe letter said it's okay for artists to use new technology like AI, but they still have to respect the rights of songwriters and recording artists.\n\nThe letter says that AI companies cannot use Sony Music Group's music and videos to teach and make better AI technology. OpenAI, Microsoft, Google, Suno, and Audio can't use songs, music, and art from famous Sony artists like Beyonce, Celine Dion, and Harry Styles.\n\n+How Spotify is stealing from small indie artists, why it matters, and what to do about it\n\nWhat are the impacts on the music industry?\n\nIt seems that a large company putting a halt to software developers selling their products, has highlighted the potentially significant impact of AI technology on the music industry. As people like the songs made by AI on TikTok, technology might keep making good songs and music that anyone can use, which could make it harder for songwriters and producers to make money and have an impact. The artist's job is getting harder because songwriters have to compete with technology that can make good songs quickly in many different styles. In the end, artists are worried that AI-created art might become as good as or even better than art made by humans. AI music is still new - in the future, we might see more streaming platforms, organisations, and musicians opposing AI to protect the rights of musicians and songwriters and keep the value of human artistry. \"\n\nRelated Blog Posts:\n\n+How Artificial Intelligence Can Make You A Better & More Efficient Musician\n\n+PlaylistSupply and ChatGPT: How to Use AI to Supercharge Your Music Marketing"
