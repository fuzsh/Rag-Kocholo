She decided not to attend high school, and pursued her dream in a musical career.\n\nThe very first demo-tape she sent to a record company had given her the chance. She was chosen out of 3000 girls, as the heroine of the 2001 fall season drama, “Kizudarake no Love Song (Scarred Love Song)” of the Fuji TV station. In November, she made her sensational debut from Sony Music Associated Records, with the song “STARS”, which was also the theme song of the drama.\n\nHer second single “CRESCENT MOON”, a groovy track with an 80’s flavor, was the limited product of 100,000 copies only. Amazingly, it sold out the first day of its release.\n\nIn March of 2002 she released her third single “ONE SURVIVE” (which received great feedback) and her first video “FILM LOTUS”, in May her 4th single “HELPLESS RAIN”, in August her 5th single “WILL” was released, tying-up to the sales of over 200,000 and Top Ten hits.\n\nIn December of 2006, Mika released “Hitoiro” for the NANA 2 movie under the name “NANA starring MIKA NAKASHIMA,” as well as a NANA album titled “THE END,” marking the conclusion of her association with NANA.\n\nShe did cover version of English songs such as Amazing Grace, The Rose, and What a Wonderful World.\n\nMika Nakashima was also in Mica 3 Chu where she released the Mini-album I DON'T KNOW, with the songs SHUT UP and I DON'T KNOW.\n\nVoice Acting Roles\n\nNo voice acting roles have been added to this person.
