        "text": "MUSIC is the third album released by Nakashima Mika. The album was another success for the singer, although it didn’t quite reach the heights of her first two albums. It peaked at #1 and sold over 547,000 copies. All the singles were relatively successful, peaking within the top ten except for the re-cut single.\n\nReleased: March 9, 2005\n\n1. Sakurairo Maukoro (桜色舞うころ; When The Cherry Blossom Colours Dance)\n\n2. Oborozukiyo~Inori (朧月夜~祈り; Misty Moon-lit Night~Prayer)\n\n3. Hi no Tori (火の鳥; Phoenix)\n\n4. Kumo no Ito (蜘蛛の糸; Spider’s Thread)\n\n5. Rocking Horse\n\n6. Carrot & Whip\n\n7. Shadows of you\n\n8. LEGEND (Main)\n\n9. Hemlock (ヘムロック)\n\n10. SEVEN\n\n11. FAKE\n\n12. Fed up\n\n13. Hitori (ひとり; Alone)\n\nThe album opens on an interesting note with its fourth single, Sakurairo Maukoro (#5 / 105,000). This is the album’s biggest hit and is a pretty piano ballad. It’s a really gorgeous song though. The verses are nice and light and flow smoothly into the song’s touching chorus. The song gradually builds with strings and percussion and it really helps to give it a fuller, fleshed out sound in its final moments. The melody is quite beautiful and Nakashima’s voice works wonderfully with it.\n\nOborizukiyo~Inori was already released on the mini-album prior to this album’s release. It features a more melancholic arrangement that focuses on a stronger traditional Japanese sound and strings. It’s not the most energizing song, but it makes up for it with its sheer beauty. It’s really something from this era of J-Pop that I miss.\n\nI find Hi no Tori (#9 / 40,000) to bring something different. While it is on the slower side of things, it has a bit more punch to its arrangement and brings a bit of slick electronic elements in its foundation. Combined with the sparkling synths, subtle strings and dreamy background vocals, the song creates a dream-like quality. It’s a song that I’ve grown to love more over the years.\n\nThe first album track comes in the form of the darker Kumo no Ito. I love the overall energy and vibe that this song gives out. It’s arrangement goes for a dreamy, almost nightmare-ish feel that utilizes more soft electronic elements as well. I also feel like Nakashima’s voice fits wonderfully in this song and she is able to bring the right kind of emotion and tone to really emphasize the song’s energy. It’s haunting is cool.\n\nIt’s weird to think that we only get our first jazz song five tracks in. Rocking Horse is a bit change because it’s the first semi-upbeat tune and goes for a bit of a cheeky tone instead of the more serious ones that the other songs had. The music is a weird blend of jazz with some 70’s rock elements, but it works out here. It’s funky and cool.\n\nGoing for a more lighthearted vibe, Carrot & Whip comes sliding through with its light reggae vibes and jazzier elements. It feels like a song that would have fit perfectly on her last album because it really utilizes the brass sounds combined with a bouncy beat. I love its laid back nature and it keeps up the strong quality of the songs. I’m glad they included this B-side.\n\nThe third album track, we get into the more acoustic driven Shadows of you. It goes for a softer, light-rock sound which is an interesting change up, but to me, it’s the weakest song up to this point. It’s not bad, but the overall energy is a bit low and it doesn’t quite hit hard on either the arrangement nor the hooks.\n\nLuckily, the album’s third single comes right in. LEGEND (Main) (#5 / 67,000) is my favourite Nakashima song because it is absolutely stunning. The song opts for a light, electronic feel and always feels like it is just floating along. Its energy level isn’t very high, but there is something lovely about the way the music transitions into the chorus. It just glides in and brings out a beautiful melody. Things get even better at the end when the song gets a bit more punch in its beat and the gorgeous background vocals give the song an even dreamier quality. Even after fifteen years, it still holds up in its beauty.\n\nI never really paid attention to Hemlock before. I actually forgot the song existed, but I’m a bit upset that I did. It’s a really funky, pop tune that brings some of the jazzy disco elements from her first album. The song really gets driven by its cool percussion, groovy guitar and flashy strings. The melody isn’t particularly catchy, but the overall energy and quality of the chorus really brings an infectious feel. My only issue is that it is a tad bit too long.\n\nPushing things even further is the album’s first single, SEVEN (#3 / 53,000). This one really drives the jazzy elements, but steps up the energy levels and brings the song’s most upbeat song. The music is really fun and I love how it recalls some of the great moments from her last album. The melody is quite catchy as well, although it does suffer from a lack of power. The decision to have Nakashima use her falsetto to open the chorus doesn’t really bring much impact and causes the song to get carried by its arrangement. It’s still a great single and quite fun.\n\nThe only other B-side included, FAKE goes for a slow, loungy sound. These kinds of songs aren’t quite my cup of tea, but it’s clear that Nakashima does a great job with this style. Her voice is really expressive and despite the strained notes, her tone really fits the dramatic style of the melody. It’s not my favourite, but it’s still a solid offering.\n\nWhile she would later become known for her rock songs as well, Fed Up is probably her first real pop/rock offering. It starts off in a dark way that feels like your usual piano ballad. Things only really amp up when the chorus hits and the music just explodes with the strong percussion, strings and heavy guitars. I love this contrast and it still brings elements that tie it in with the rest of the album. One of the stronger album tracks on here.\n\nI love how things swing into the final song and the album’s re-cut single. Hitori (#15 / 26,000) feels like it goes in the other direction of the album’s first song, “Sakurairo Maukoro”. Despite both songs having rather sad lyrics, instead of a beautiful and lighthearted sounding ballad, we get one that goes for a darker and more melancholic tone. The arrangement also retains a gradual build up, but it feels more focused on the strings thing time to really bring that haunting edge. It’s a stunning way to end things off.\n\nOverall: This album was exactly as I was expecting. It’s a really great one. All the singles are great and I actually enjoy them a bit more than her last album’s set of singles. However, there were a few weaker album tracks here and there so it wasn’t as consistent. Still, the overall quality of the album is stellar and you can tell how detailed everything felt with the gorgeous arrangements throughout each song.\n\nA+\n\nOborozukiyo ~ Inori is the second mini-album released by Nakashima Mika. The title track used as the promotional track and was later included on her third album, MUSIC. The mini-album was successful, peaking at #3 and selling over 110,000 copies.\n\nReleased: September 15, 2004\n\n1. Oborozukiyo ~ Inori (朧月夜~祈り; Night With a Hazy Moon~Prayer)\n\n2. Sara (沙羅; Desert Rose)\n\n3. Tsuki no Sabaku (月の沙漠; Desert of the Moon)\n\n4. Yuki no Hana (Silent Version) (雪の華; Snow Flower)\n\n5. Oborozukiyo ~ Inori (Acoustic Mix)\n\n6. Sara (Jazztronik Mix)\n\n7. Oborozukiyo ~ Inori (Instrumental)\n\nOborozukiyo ~ Inori is one of Nakashima’s most stunning songs and one of the most beautiful tunes I’ve ever heard. It has a more traditional twist to it that combines a gentle percussion, guitar, synths and haunting strings. The song focuses more on the atmosphere and feeling it brings than the melody, although that is still beautiful and works wonderfully with Nakashima’s sadder vocal display. The song has this underlying melancholic tone to it that just drives the song. It’s absolutely gorgeous.\n\nI was expecting the mini to continue the slower pace, but instead we get Sara, a haunting upbeat tune. This one brings in a bit of sitar and the tempo is much faster. It’s a cool blend of different genres with its almost latin spin and the arrangement really brings this fuller sound out. It’s not the catchiest song, but like the last one, it really works on building the atmosphere. Another stellar tune.\n\nContinuing this experimental twist, Tsuki no Sabaku comes flowing in with its light jazz and bossa nova elements. It’s slower than the last song, but doesn’t quite have the same feeling of the first one. Instead, it feels much cleaner and feels more fitting for a late night. It doesn’t quite have intensity to it, but its relaxing nature is a welcome change.\n\nThe next few songs are all just remixes. The first is of her most famous tune, Yuki no Hana. Here we get a “Silent Version“, which doesn’t mean no sound, but instead gets rid focuses on the strings and piano. The original is already a beautiful tune and this just gives it an even sadder quality. Not as powerful as the original, but still a stunning rendition. Oborozukiyo ~ Inori (Acoustic Mix) does much the same and loses some of the underlying instruments with a focus on guitar and strings. Much like the last remix, this one just adds another air of sadness. I would actually say this one is even more haunting than the original and up to par. Wasn’t sure what to expect with Sara (Jazztronik Mix) and it’s weird. It stands out the most on the album since it loses its organic spin and brings some stronger synth elements. With that said, I like it’s more robotic take and it is a cool spin on the original.\n\nOverall: This is a pretty stellar mini-album. All the songs, remixes included, are amazing and they all bring some different sounds despite that more haunting quality that ties them all together. This is definitely a mini that should be listened to. It makes me a bit sad that “Sara” was not included on her third album though since it would fit perfectly.\n\nA+\n\nLØVE is the second album released by Nakashima Mika. While her first solidified her status as a rising star, this album’s success was on an even bigger scale. It positioned her as one of the top artists of the early 00’s as it peaked at number one and sold well over 1.4 million copies. The singles were also very successful with all five scoring in the top five and one becoming her signature song. The album also includes all the new songs from her first mini-album, RESISTANCE.\n\nReleased: November 6, 2003\n\n1. Venus in the Dark\n\n2. Love Addict\n\n3. aroma\n\n4. Yuki no Hana (雪の華; Snow Flower)\n\n5. RESISTANCE (album version)\n\n6. FIND THE WAY\n\n7. marionette\n\n8. Seppun (接吻; Kiss)\n\n9. You send me love\n\n10. Be in silence\n\n11. LOVE NO CRY\n\n12. Aishiteru (愛してる; I Love You)\n\n13. LAST WALTZ\n\nWhat a great way to blast off the album. Unlike her debut which opened with a cover of Amazing Grace, this one really showcases Nakashima’s subtle change in style with the jazz-infused pop tune, Venus in the Dark. This is one of my favourite songs from her because it has so many interesting sounds that pop up. I love how it has so much energy and really goes all out in its music with the funky bass and blaring brass. Her husky vocals also work gorgeously here.\n\nLove Addict (#5 / 69,000) is a great follow-up to because it continues that jazz-infused pop sound. Released as the album’s second single, this song is over seven minutes in length, but the whole song is such a trip and it never feels like it drags on too long. It really feels like something heard in a jazz club with it mix of strings, trumpets and light percussion. The best part of the song is that fast-paced chorus where things take a powerful turn.\n\naroma was originally put on her first mini album and it is a great calmer jazz tune. I love how it really ties with the other songs, but brings a different style that includes a bit of blues as well. The chorus isn’t as catchy, but I do like the use of falsetto to bring an airier quality to the song. It’s a solid listen.\n\nYuki no Hana (#3 / 248,000) is the juggernaut in Nakashima’s discography. The song has been covered numerous times throughout Asia and it is easily her most recognizable track. Instead of something jazzy, we are given the first ballad and its fifth single. Its focus is mostly on the piano, strings and her voice and it is absolutely gorgeous song. Although the lyrics are rather sweet, there is a sense of sadness that the music brings and Nakashima brings the right emotion into it especially with that final stretch from the bridge to the end. It’s one of her best.\n\nRESISTANCE was my favourite song from her first mini and I love how it is one of the more “pop” songs on the album with its sparkly synths. Although I’m not a big fan of songs that open with the chorus, it is really catchy and easy to get sucked into it again. That and the music has some great touches to it that help keep the energy up and interesting. It has grown on me a lot and I think it’s a stellar tune.\n\nFIND THE WAY (#4 / 124,000) was released as the album’s fourth single and used as an ending theme to the anime show, Gundam Seed. It’s a stunning ballad that focuses more on the slower and sweeter quality it brings. Musically, the song’s use of strings is quite heavy and really helps bring a sweeping quality into the song. There are times where the song comes off a bit dull or slow, but I do love the feeling it tries to build on. It’s a sweet ballad and fits Nakashima’s vocals wonderfully.\n\nmarionette was actually released on the first single as a B-side. It’s one of the more “pop” songs on the album and features some R&B elements as well. I don’t find the verses to be that interesting especially as Nakashima’s vocals seem rather monotone. However, I love the chorus as the music really pushes the song forward. The funky synths work really nicely with the easy-going melody. A decent tune.\n\nThe third single, Seppun (#4 / 38,000) is actually a cover of an ORIGINAL LOVE song from 1993 of the same name. It’s actually my favourite song on the album and it has been the song that has grown on me the most. I use to skip this song a lot, but the relaxing reggae sound really got to me and I love how the music is still infused with some other elements to keep it cohesive with the rest of the album. It’s not the most powerful song, but the melody just slowly seeps into you and I love the vibe it gives.\n\nYou send me love is the first new song since Venus in the dark and is one of the weaker songs on the album. It’s not bad, just forgettable as the melody isn’t as impactful and the music has been done better in other songs. I do like the funky vibe that the song has with the underlying bass though.\n\nBe in silence was released as the B-side from the album’s second single. It’s a bit different because it has a heavier guitar influence and a sultry beat that really gives some neo-soul vibes. I really love the music as it works great with the inclusion of strings. The chorus really brings everything together in a nice way while having a pretty catchy melody. I don’t think it’s A-side material, but it is definitely a great filler.\n\nLOVE NO CRY is a new song and is the first upbeat tune in a while. I love the blast of energy it has right from the start and the song has a great pop sound with some oldschool R&B elements. The song isn’t the catchiest for me, but it is nice to hear some more fun, uplifting tunes on here.\n\nAishiteru (#4 / 105,000) was the album’s first single and it is a pretty pop ballad. I love how sweet the melody is and Nakashima’s voice sounds especially beautiful here. The album version changes things up a bit bringing some more musical elements into the arrangement. It has a bit more brass and a bass that gives the song a bit more energy. I like the changes as it works well on the album, but it misses that simple sweetness the original had.\n\nLAST WALTZ finishes things off on a slower note. Originally released on her first mini, this was probably my least favourite of the new songs. However, I do still like this song. It has a great vibe to it and I enjoy the airiness of the chorus. It’s not the type to bring a lot of impact, but I love how the melody melds into the music. It’s a nice way to end things off.\n\nOverall: This is a stellar album and one of J-Pop’s finest. I love that there is a clear sound that the album wants to show off and that even though there is a variety of genres, they are all tied in through the similar elements in the instruments and atmosphere. I do believe the first half is much stronger, but the second half does have a few strong songs as well. This is a long album and it could have been cut down a few songs, but its overall delivery is fantastic. One of my favourite J-Pop albums.\n\nA+\n\nRESISTANCE is the first mini-album released by Nakashima Mika. The title track was used as the promotional song. All the new songs were later featured on her second album, LØVE. The mini-album peaked at #1 and sold close to 200,000 copies (it was limited to 200,000 copies).\n\nReleased: November 7, 2002\n\n1. RESISTANCE\n\n2. HEAVEN ON EARTH (EP Version)\n\n3. aroma\n\n4. LAST WALTZ\n\n5. STARS (Live Unplugged)\n\n6. RESISTANCE (Instrumental)\n\nRESISTANCE is a dramatic midtempo pop song. It’s a really cool track with its steady beat and splashes of synths. I actually prefer the verses over the chorus because they are calming and go well over the R&B beat and touches of piano. The chorus is still nice though and sounds better as the song progresses as the arrangement brings in some brass that really gives the song some energy. It’s a really good track and is the type of song that fits perfectly with Nakashima’s husky voice.\n\nHEAVEN ON EARTH (EP Version) was originally featured on her debut album and another version has popped up on. I’m not complaining because this was the best album track on her debut and is one of Nakashima’s best songs. It has a cool jazzy vibe to it and is insanely catchy. I think the differences between this and the original are subtle and is largely due to the different beat they use. Sounds even better than when I reviewed it on her debut.\n\naroma is a calm jazzy number and it comes in at over six minutes long. I love the smooth vibe of the song and Nakashima just sounds gorgeous here. The chorus largely focuses on her falsetto, which actually sounds nicely controlled and fits the gentle nature of the song. I do like the guitar solos that come up later in the song and I don’t feel like it drags the song out too much despite the length.\n\nLAST WALTZ brings something on the slower side of things. Even with that, the song does have some energy. Actually, what I love about Nakashima’s music at this time is that the arrangements are still so interesting and have some really clever inclusions like the strings, guitar and brass that really keep the song from getting too dull. It’s probably the weakest song on the mini-album, but it’s still a gorgeous tune.\n\nThe Live Unplugged version of STARS is an interesting addition, but it still keeps the magic of the original. Unlike the jazzier backdrop of the original, here we are only given a piano (and a bit of guitar later on). It’s just hard to hear Nakashima struggle during the end notes. Maybe she is crying, but it doesn’t lend as well on a recording.\n\nOverall: This was a good mini-album. There are some great songs on here and all three of the new songs are of high quality. I do love the inclusion of the different versions of “STARS” and “HEAVEN ON EARTH”, but I do wish the differences with the latter were a little more extravagant. It’s an amazing song, just feels like they added it again and it could have been a done differently.\n\nA-\n\nNakashima Mika hit it big right when she debuted. Her first single, “STARS”, was a big hit, scoring in the top three and selling close to 500,000 copies in total. Releasing four more singles before coming out with TRUE, Nakashima was able to score a moderate amount of hits. Her debut album topped the charts, sold over one million copies, and solidified her as one of the top newcomers.\n\nReleased: August 28, 2002\n\n1. AMAZING GRACE (album version) [MV]\n\n2. WILL (album version) [MV]\n\n3. ONE SURVIVE (album version) [MV]\n\n4. HEAVEN ON EARTH [MV]\n\n5. DESTINY’S LOTUS [MV]\n\n6. Helpless Rain [MV]\n\n7. I\n\n8. TEARS (Konayuki ga Mau You ni…) (粉雪が舞うように….; Like How Powder Snow Dances)\n\n9. TRUE EYES\n\n10. CRESCENT MOON [MV]\n\n11. JUST TRUST IN OUR LOVE (album version)\n\n12. STARS (album version) [MV]\n\n13. A MIRACLE FOR YOU\n\nThe album opens with AMAZING GRACE, which was actually released as a B-side to her second single. It’s an interesting way to open the album. Nakashima’s vocals are quite unique and her English isn’t too bad. There are times when her voice does sound a little awkward though and she gets an odd thickness to her voice that doesn’t quite match. The song itself is pretty simple and only features the piano. It isn’t that great, but it isn’t a total wreck. Not something I would play over though.\n\nFortunately, the album moves right into WILL (#3 / 145,000), her fifth and second most successful single from the album. I love this song. It’s a pretty standard sounding ballad from Nakashima that would be replicated in the future with its prominence of soaring strings, piano and percussion. The melody is excellent though. There are times when Nakashima’s voice sounds a bit stretched out, but she does a decent job. Her voice is quite unique and has a charm to it that fits these kind of songs well.\n\nONE SURVIVE (#8 / 87,000) was released as her third single and changes things up from the ballad style of the last two songs. Here we get a jazz-infused pop tune with some disco elements. I really like the fast-paced feel and the inclusion of the strings-like sound really makes the song funky. My favourite portion is the chorus opening as it just has so much energy. I don’t think the melody is exceptionally nice, but it is decent. There are a few buggy parts to it though. Not the strongest song, but a nice change.\n\nHEAVEN ON EARTH is the first song that wasn’t featured on a single prior to the release of the album. It isn’t as fast-paced as the last song, but it’s more of a midtempo pop tune. I really like it though. It’s a different kind of style and is quite cool to hear. I like the music with its nice blend of synths and beats. It’s very 2000s. I also think the melody is really catchy.\n\nDESTINY’S LOTUS definitely continues the funky disco-inspired sound heard in “ONE SURVIVE” but with a bit more dance elements to it and less jazz. I think this one is actually stronger though. The melody is definitely nicer and I find the bouncy musical arrangement to actually be quite fun. There are areas that could be fixed though as there are some odd notes in the chorus that could be fixed and the chorus just rushes by so quickly. I don’t think Nakashima’s voice really works with this kind of song and she does come off rather stuffy and not totally on top of the beat. It’s a catchy song, but could use some fine tuning.\n\nI know a lot of people don’t really like Helpless Rain (#8 / 83,000) that much, but I do like it to some extent. I love R&B, so this was a nice change to hear Nakashima sing and her voice is really beautiful in the lower registers of the verses. The problems come by the chorus as while the melody is decent, it causes Nakashima to hit some harsh high notes with her head tone. Beside those notes though, the song has some charm to it and would’ve worked really well with her had parts been fixed up.\n\nI absolutely adore I and it is probably my favourite of the album tracks. It is a laidback R&B-inspired pop tune. The thing I love most is how well the song works with Nakashima’s voice and how we get to hear her in a more comfortable range. It’s not particularly strong in terms of music, but I do like the blues elements that the song has as well. It’s really a nice change from her and fits well with the albums feel.\n\nTEARS (Konayuki ga Mau You ni…) swings us back to a little more of a traditional pop ballad sound. There isn’t much going on with the arrangement and it is largely filled with light touches of synths that give the song a heavenly quality to it. With that said, I think this song is boring. It might have been better if the melody was catchier, but it goes on for almost seven minutes and it doesn’t really change itself up. I do like songs like this, but this is a bit too dull for me.\n\nLuckily, TRUE EYES comes and saves the day with an explosive disco tune. I love the more lighthearted feel of the song compared to some of the other uptempo tunes as they seemed to have darker elements in their music. This one is just a lot of fun and the chorus is probably the catchiest of the uptempo tunes up to this point. Nakashima also sounds great and she isn’t straining for any notes.\n\nCRESCENT MOON (#4 / 99,000) continues the sound of the last song with its disco-inspired sound, although this one has a bit more funk to it. Probably my favourite of the upbeat songs, I just really adore the chorus on this one. With that said, it does lose some of its flare after being placed after “TRUE EYES”, as both have such similar sounds. It’s a fun listen though.\n\nJUST TRUST IN OUR LOVE (album version) switches things up from the original single version. Here, we switch from a slower ballad to an upbeat dance tune. While it is a fun listen and I like that things were changed up a bit, there are times when the song just feels so empty. There seems to be a disconnect from the vocals and music and they don’t really blend together all that well.\n\nThe most successful song on the album, STARS (album version) (#3 / 469,000), is my favourite song on the album and one of my favourite Nakashima songs. It’s a stunning pop ballad with some jazz influence to it. I love the musical arrangement and it’s clear that this was meant to be a big hit with its slick production and clean delivery. It’s just a powerhouse of a song. It works so well with Nakashima’s voice and she really shines during the chorus, especially when the sweeping strings, light percussion and brass instruments are added in the background. It’s just gorgeous.\n\nA MIRACLE FOR YOU ends the album on a positive note with a gospel inspired pop ballad. Nakashima sounds exceptional on the verses and her lower register is quite breathtaking. Luckily, she swings into her higher register during the choruses and she sounds more reassured and supported here than other instances on the album. The song does go on for quite a bit, but it’s just a strong ending and Nakashima gives it her all on this one.\n\nOverall: TRUE is a decent listen for a first album. It had a few blips and blops, but there are some really solid songs on here and the overall sound is rather cohesive. Most of the songs are still able to shine on an individual level as well. With that said, while I do think the album is good, I only think less than half of the songs are impressive. The ballads, for the most part, are quite stunning and mix so well with Nakashima’s vocals. However, while the uptempo songs are fun and help bring some variety, I don’t think they were particularly as clean in production and there are quite a few flaws in each. It’s still a fun listen in general.\n\nB-"
