It contains the music videos for all of Mika's first 18 singles – from 'Stars' to 'Glamorous Sky' – and the promotional videos for 'Amazing Grace (05)' and a previously unreleased live recording of the song 'Blood.'\n\nBest debuted at #1 in the Japan Oricon 200 Album Chart when it was released, selling 480,097 copies in its first week – bettering the first-week sales of her first album, True.
