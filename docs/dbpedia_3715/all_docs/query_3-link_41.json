        "text": "AVAILABLE FOR PRE-ORDER NOW\n\nhttps://davidgilmour.lnk.to/LuckandStrange\n\nLP, CD, BLU-RAY & DIGITAL\n\nNEW TRACK ‘THE PIPER’S CALL’ AVAILABLE THURSDAY 25th APRIL FROM DIGITAL PLATFORMS\n\nVIDEO PREMIERES FRIDAY 26th APRIL\n\nTHE PIPER’S CALL VIDEO\n\nWORLD EXCLUSIVE FIRST PLAY ON THE BBC RADIO 2 BREAKFAST SHOW\n\nTOMORROW AFTER 9am\n\nWATCH THE ALBUM TEASER\n\nDavid Gilmour today announced his new album ‘Luck and Strange’, to be released on 6th September on Sony Music. The first track from the album, ‘The Piper’s Call’, will be released this Thursday, 25th April, following a world exclusive first play on the BBC Radio 2 Breakfast Show.\n\n‘Luck and Strange’ was recorded over five months in Brighton and London and is Gilmour’s first album of new material in nine years. The record was produced by David and Charlie Andrew, best known for his work with ALT-J and Marika Hackman. Of this new working relationship, David says, “We invited Charlie to the house, so he came and listened to some demos, and said things like, “Well, why does there have to be a guitar solo there?” and “Do they all fade out? Can’t some of them just end?”. He has a wonderful lack of knowledge or respect for this past of mine. He’s very direct and not in any way overawed, and I love that. That is just so good for me because the last thing you want is people just deferring to you.”\n\nThe majority of the album’s lyrics have been composed by Polly Samson, Gilmour’s co-writer and collaborator for the past thirty years. Samson says of the lyrical themes covered on ‘Luck and Strange’, “It’s written from the point of view of being older; mortality is the constant.” Gilmour elaborates, “We spent a load of time during and after lockdown talking about and thinking about those kind of things.” Polly has also found the experience of working with Charlie Andrew liberating, “He wants to know what the songs are about, he wants everyone who’s playing on them to have the ideas that are in the lyric informing their playing. I have particularly loved it for that reason.”\n\nThe album features eight new tracks along with a beautiful reworking of The Montgolfier Brothers’ ‘Between Two Points’ and has artwork and photography by the renowned artist Anton Corbijn.\n\nMusicians contributing to the record include Guy Pratt & Tom Herbert on bass, Adam Betts, Steve Gadd and Steve DiStanislao on drums, Rob Gentry & Roger Eno on keyboards with string and choral arrangements by Will Gardner. The title track also features the late Pink Floyd keyboard player Richard Wright, recorded in 2007 at a jam in a barn at David’s house.\n\nSome contributions emerged from the live streams that Gilmour and family performed to a global audience during the lockdowns of 2020 and 2021; Romany Gilmour sings, plays the harp and appears on lead vocals on ‘Between Two Points’. Gabriel Gilmour also sings backing vocals.\n\nThe album’s cover image, photographed and designed by Anton Corbijn, is inspired by a lyric written by Charlie Gilmour for the album’s final song ‘Scattered’. Of working with his family on ‘Luck and Strange’, David says, “Polly and I have been writing together for over thirty years and the Von Trapped live streams showed the great blend of Romany’s voice and harp-playing and that led us into a feeling of discarding some of the past that I’d felt bound to and that I could throw those rules out and do whatever I felt like doing, and that has been such a joy.”\n\n‘Luck and Strange’ will be released on 6th September on Sony Music.\n\nDAVID GILMOUR\n\nLUCK AND STRANGE\n\nVINYL\n\nBlack vinyl, gatefold sleeve and booklet with photography and design by Anton Corbijn\n\nSIDE ONE\n\nBlack Cat*\n\nLuck and Strange\n\nThe Piper’s Call\n\nA Single Spark\n\nVita Brevis*\n\nBetween Two Points** – with Romany Gilmour\n\nSIDE TWO\n\nDark and Velvet Nights\n\nSings\n\nScattered***\n\nCD\n\nAlbum plus two bonus tracks.\n\nDigipak and booklet with photography and design by Anton Corbijn\n\nBlack Cat*\n\nLuck and Strange\n\nThe Piper’s Call\n\nA Single Spark\n\nVita Brevis*\n\nBetween Two Points** – with Romany Gilmour\n\nDark and Velvet Nights\n\nSings\n\nScattered***\n\nBONUS TRACKS\n\nYes, I Have Ghosts\n\nLuck and Strange (original Barn Jam)*\n\nBLU-RAY – AUDIO ONLY\n\nAlbum in Dolby Atmos and high-resolution stereo mixes plus four bonus tracks.\n\nDigipak and booklet with photography and design by Anton Corbijn\n\nBlack Cat*\n\nLuck and Strange\n\nThe Piper’s Call\n\nA Single Spark\n\nVita Brevis*\n\nBetween Two Points** – with Romany Gilmour\n\nDark and Velvet Nights\n\nSings\n\nScattered***\n\nBONUS TRACKS\n\nIn Dolby Atmos and Hi-Res stereo\n\nYes, I Have Ghosts\n\nLuck and Strange (original Barn Jam)*\n\nA Single Spark (Orchestral)*\n\nScattered (Orchestral)*\n\nDeluxe LP & CD boxsets will be announced in the coming weeks.\n\nDAVID GILMOUR\n\n‘LUCK AND STRANGE’\n\nAll songs Music: David Gilmour.
