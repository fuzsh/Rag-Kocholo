        "text": "Background\n\nIn 1991, The CBS Records Group, rebranded itself to Sony Music Entertainment, which led to the CBS Records label renaming itself to Columbia Records internationally, outside of Japan, which renamed to SMEJ, with the CBS Sony label renaming to Sony Records International.\n\n1st Logo (1991-2001?)\n\nVisuals: On a black background, a 3-D bottomless tricolor pyramid is shown spinning around, with the cut-out letters \"S\" on the red side, \"M\" on the green side, and \"V\" on the blue side. Then, two more pyramids just like the first one slide out of the bottom of it and they all spin. Then the pyramids get together, and as they do that, each of them turn into triangles, and the letters turn white. \"E N T E R P R I S E S\" fades in under \"SMV\".\n\nVariant: On the 1996 VHS of Street Fighter II: The Animated Movie, the logo is shortened to the last few seconds.\n\nTechnique: CGI.\n\nAudio: A modern-sounding synth theme with ticks throughout and 3 deep bangs as the pyramids turns into triangles. On the variant, only re-arranged drumbeats and the synth strum are heard.\n\nAvailability:\n\nIt can be seen on many Sony Music Video releases from the era such as the VHS/DVD releases of Celine Dion: Unison, Celine Dion: All the Way - A Decade of Song and Video, and Mariah Carey: #1's. The logo continued to be used internationally up into the early 2000's.\n\nIt can also be found on many 90's MTV Home Video releases from the era, such as early Beavis and Butt-Head and MTV Unplugged VHS releases.\n\nThe short variant appeared on the 1996 VHS of Street Fighter II: The Animated Movie.\n\n2nd Logo (1996-2004)\n\nVisuals: On a black background, a gold ball moves upward. Then, two blue balls move downward, left and right of the gold ball. These move away, as it fades into 3 black smoking circles with the left and right circle with blue outlining and the middle circle with gold outlining. These outlines then spin around, as the smoke disappears and the letters \"S\" on the left circle in white, \"M\" on the middle circle in blue, and \"V\" on the right circle in white appear. The circles turn to the colors of the outlines of the circle, then the words \"s o n y m u s i c entertainment\" appear one-by-one in sync with the three drum hits. \"sony music\" is spaced out more to fit the width of \"entertainment\" below.\n\nTechnique: CGI.\n\nAudio: The music from the previous logo.\n\nAvailability:\n\nSeen on many Sony Music Entertainment VHS and DVD releases from the era, including Computer Animation Festival, Alice in Chains: Music Bank - The Videos, Jennifer Lopez: Feelin So Good, and Kathy Smith re-releases from the company.\n\nIt also appears on many late 1990's-early 2000's MTV Home Video releases such as MTV Gamebrain, Beavis and Butt-Head and The Real World video tapes.\n\nThis logo appeared on the packaging of the 2006 Shout! Factory DVD sets The Super Mario Bros. Super Show and The Best of the Electric Company, as well as all four seasons of Home Movies, but this logo never appeared on the DVDs themselves."
