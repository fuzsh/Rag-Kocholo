        "text": "WRAPS OPENING STINT ON SWITCHFOOT’S “THE BEAUTIFUL LETDOWN TOUR” THIS WEEKEND\n\nPop, genre-bending singer-songwriter Ben Goldsmith released his latest song today, “Hold On To Me.” Written and produced by Goldsmith, the song provides a message of encouragement for when life gets tough. Goldsmith performed all the instruments on the track as well. Listen here.\n\n“I’m choosing to release ‘Hold On To Me’ because now more than ever, I feel that the world needs positivity, love, and light. This song is about letting people you love know that you’ll be there for them in challenging times,” Goldsmith said. “On a personal note, I want to dedicate the song to my twin little sisters. My mom has been ill on and off for two years and they have endured a lot for a young age. We leaned on one another to get though a lot of her illness. I love them so much. I hope everyone has someone they can hold on to during tough times.”\n\n“Hold On To Me” arrives on the heels of the 17-year-old songsmith’s debut album, The World Between My Ears, which was released in September. Goldsmith co-wrote each of the 15 tracks on the album. The project includes his recently released song “Blown Away,” which is impacting Adult Album Alternative radio now. The World Between My Ears is a result of the singer traveling back and forth to Nashville during the Covid years to write songs, create his own sound, and woodshed in the studio with Brad Jones (Hayes Carll, Chuck Prophet, Ron Sexsmith), who he co-produced the project with. The album illustrates Goldsmith’s broad, melody driven and soulful musical palette.\n\n2023 is shaping up to be a breakout year for Goldsmith, who was named to The Hollywood Reporter’s “Emerging Artists 18 and Under” club for music this year. In June, just after Goldsmith graduated from high school (a year early), he announced his signing to Sony Music Nashville. He was offered a record deal on the spot after he performed for several executives last year. At the time, he was only 16 years old and without any major social media following. On the same day he announced his label signing, he shared that he penned deals with UTA and Universal Music Publishing Group Nashville as well.\n\nThe following week, the singer-songwriter took the stage at the iconic music festival, Bonnaroo. Goldsmith recently wrapped his opening stint on Jack Botts’s “Sucker for Sunsets North American Tour.” He appeared on several tour dates with Patty Griffin this fall, and is currently touring alongside Switchfoot.\n\nGoldsmith’s musical journey started at four years old (where his violin teacher discovered he had perfect pitch) and has included jazz guitar studies at The Manhattan School of Music and Mannes College of Music in NY. Ben recorded an EP of original music at 11 years old and played all of the instruments. He developed a commanding onstage presence performing live in School of Rock programs, local community events, fairs and clubs by the time he was 12 years old. At 13 he perfected his guitar skills with Tomo Fujita, whose teaching résumé includes Berklee College of Music and John Mayer.\n\nWith a natural yet extraordinary gift for singing and songwriting and a passion for performing, Ben is blazing his own Converse-paved trail.
