        "text": "Young Pop and R&B singer from Kagoshima (born February 19, 1983). Since her debut in 2001 one of the most succesful artist of the japanese music industry. Her first three albums »True« (2002), »Love« (2003) and »Music« (2005) reached number one on the japanese album charts.\n\nShe released her first single »Stars«, the theme song for the TV drama »Kizudarake no Love Song«, starring herself, in November 2001. Received the »Japan Gold Disc Award« for »Best new Artist of the Year« in 2002 and the »Japan Gold Disc Award« for »Rock and Pop Album of the Year« for her debut album »True« in 2003.\n\nMore about Mika Nakashima at:\n\nMika Nakashima Official Website (Japanese)\n\nMika Nakashima at Sony Music Japan (English)\n\nNumber one again\n\nWith her new album »Music«, released on March 9, young singer Mika Nakashima has maintained her status as one of the top artists of Sony Music Japan. Like her first two albums »True« and »Love« her new album stormed to the top of the japanese album charts.\n\nOn »Music« Sony Music Japan and Mika Nakashima stuck with the succesful recipe of the first two albums. »Music« contains primarily slow and mid-tempo pop songs with excursions into R&B, Jazz and Reggae.\n\nPeople who bought last year's five single releases »Seven«, »Sakurairo maukoro«, »Oborodukiyo-Inori«, »Hinotori« and »Legend« already own more than half of the songs on »Music« (seven out of 13). But the six new tracks, with the slow songs »Kumo no ito« and »Hitori« as well as »Hemlock« (R&B track with a late 70's appeal) as highlights, make this album worth buying.\n\nMore about Mika Nakashima"
