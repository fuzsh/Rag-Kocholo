        "text": "Mika Nakashima was born on February 19th, 1983 in Kagoshima prefecture, Japan. Ever since she was a child, Nakashima loved to sing instead of going to high school or college, pursued her dream in a musical career. She started competing in the music industry and modelling business at the age of 17 when she sent a demo tape to Sony records. She was chosen out of 3,000 girls, as the heroine of the 2001 fall season drama, \"KIZUDARAKE NO LOVE SONG (Scarred Love Song)\" of the Fuji TV station. Mika Nakashima was chosen to sing the theme song of a new drama called “Kizu darake no Love Song”. The song was released as her first single STARS, which sold 60,000 copies and came in at third place on the Japanese Oricon Charts.\n\nIn November, she made her sensational debut from Sony Music Associated Records, with the song \"STARS\", which was also the theme song of the drama. Her second single \"CRESCENT MOON\", a track with an 80's flavor, was the limited product of 100,000 copies only. Amazingly, it sold out the first day of its release. In March of 2002 she released her third single \"ONE SURVIVE\" (which received great feedback) and her first video \"FILM LOTUS\", in May her 4th single \"HELPLESS RAIN\", in August her 5th single \"WILL\" was released, tying-up to the sales of over 200,000 and Top Ten hits. Her first album \"TRUE\" released in August 2002 was a #1 HIT in the Oricon charts. In only 3 weeks, \"TRUE\" became a million seller. Then as commemoration of one year since her debut, Mika released a Premium EP \"Resistance\", which hit the charts #1 spot two weeks in a row.\n\nOn December 18, a documentary video \"KISEKI the document of a start\" was released.Mika did two Live Tours, one in 2003 and another one in 2004. The Love tour sold out within two minutes, touring 24 cities and 36 stages. Her concert final in the Tokyo International Forum was visited by 100,000 people! Mika became so popular that everything she made immediately sold out. Her limited edition single, Kiss sold out the first 100,000 copies. She is known as one of the best live performers of Japan with her natural voice and emotion.Mika has won her a vivid public recognition and aroused the excitement in many listeners of her generation. It was not a surprise that 2002 was a great year for Mika as she received \"New Artist of the Year\" from THE JAPAN GOLD DISC AWARD, \"Best New Artist of the Year\" from ALL JAPAN REQUEST AWARD 2002, and \"New Artist of the Year\" from THE 44th JAPANESE RECORD AWARD.\n\nMika Nakashima has been featured in animes such as Mobile Suit Gundam SEED and Hi no Tori (Phoenix) with opening and closing songs. With her exquisite beauty, mature lyrics and unquestionable style, Mika Nakashima has become a great pop idol in the last two years.
