        "text": "December 22, 2023 — Today, the ever-imaginative Still Woozy releases his infectious new song “Anyone But You,” via Interscope Records. The dreamy anthem arrives in conjunction with Sony Pictures’ forthcoming romantic comedy Anyone But You, starring Sydney Sweeney (Euphoria) and Glen Powell (Top Gun: Maverick). “Anyone But You” marks Still Woozy’s first new release in two years. Listen HERE.\n\n“Anyone but you couldn’t get it, you’re gonna back up off it for a minute,” he croons over gentle organ, slide guitar, and bluesy drumming. “You owe me peace of mind — just take your time, just take your time.” On the track’s blissed-out chorus, Still Woozy adds: “It’s just us in bed and I can’t go back.” Coy and clever, the soundtrack song captures the spark of new romance with timeless freshness.\n\nIn Anyone But You, Bea (Sweeney) and Ben (Powell) go on one picture-perfect date, but their romance quickly fizzles. However, they are unexpectedly reunited on a destination wedding in Australia, where they pretend to be a couple in a half-baked scheme to win the hearts of the people they really want to be with. Of course, nothing goes as planned — and Still Woozy’s new song underlines an integral moment in the film.\n\n“Anyone But You” is Still Woozy’s first new release since dropping the acclaimed project If This Isn’t Nice, I Don’t Know What Is in 2021. Since then, he has remixed The Marias’ “Hush,” collaborated with Remi Wolf, and co-produced and co-wrote a song for SZA. His contribution to the year’s most-anticipated rom com doubles as a welcome return from the one-man band.\n\n​​About Still Woozy: Under the moniker Still Woozy, Portland-based singer-songwriter/producer Sven Gamsky makes psychedelic alternative music with a homespun mix of acoustic and electronic instruments. On his debut album released in 2021, If This Isn’t Nice, I Don’t Know What Is, Gamsky ultimately redefines the limits of modern pop, introducing elements of soul, folk, and psychedelia into a wildly infectious sound that immediately leaves a lasting impact. He shared an ingeniously detailed body of work, including beloved singles “Window,” “That’s Life,” and “Woof,” and graces each song with the uplifting energy he brought to the stage at major festivals like Coachella and Lollapalooza and a sold out If This Isn’t Nice tour across North America and Europe. With his distinctive blend of dreamy melodies and innovative soundscapes, Still Woozy continues to captivate audiences, solidifying his place as a unique and influential force in the contemporary music landscape."
