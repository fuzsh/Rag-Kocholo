Ashita Sekai ga Owaru Nara\n\n4. PASSION\n\n5. You Knocked Me Out\n\n6. LOVE IS ECSTASY\n\n7. BE REAL\n\n8. SUPER WOMAN\n\n9. SUPREME\n\n10. Pierce\n\n11. Kioku\n\n12. Epilogue\n\n13. LETTER\n\n♦ ♦ ♦\n\nREAL is the seventh studio album by Japanese singer Mika Nakashima, released on January 30, 2013. The album debuted at #1 on the Oricon Charts.\n\nAlmost the entire first half of the album is either A-side or B-side songs we already know from the single she released in this era, but there are some new songs as well. The first song on the album is the latest A-side Hatsukoi, which I think has breathtaking piano music and a very good long introduction. Even though it’s tricky to start an album with a ballad, it’s not a bad one if you look past the slightly pitchy vocals in the chorus. Most of the song is all verses, and those are the best parts (where Mika controls her vocals very well). Once I got used to this song, I started to like it a little bit more.\n\nNext is the first A-side of the era, DEAR, which had one of the most original arrangements of all the songs in the REAL era. The acoustic guitar and saxophone actually work well together in a song and it’s exactly what made this A-side more memorable for me (and also a bit more enjoyable). Mika’s vocals are actually good here, especially when compared to her vocals in Hatsukoi for example.\n\nThird ballad in a row, hmm, that’s a minor issue. Ashita Sekai ga Owaru Nara wasn’t exactly my favorite ballad A-side either, so to me personally this is a bit bigger of an issue. I like the fact that the music fits the Resident Evil branch with its dark and mysterious sound, but Mika overuses her vobrato in almost every line and that’s already getting on my nerves at the end of the first verse. Don’t get me started on the chorus. If this song featured better vocals, I would have been stunned by its epic ambience.\n\nAhh, the first uptempo song and it’s a rock song as well. PASSION caught my attention from the introduction with the loud electric guitars, brass instruments and the chants by Mika and her background chorus. This song has everything the previous songs didn’t have: tempo, good vocals and catchy melodies. Not to burn track 1 through 3 though, but this one just totally caught me off guard and I found myself liking it very much. This is some edgy stuff.\n\nYou Knocked Me Out continues the uptempo part of the first half, and although this B-side to LOVE IS ECSTASY was a little less impressive than said song and Mika’s English isn’t that good, this track really is catchy and has Mika explore rock in a funky style. Although some may disagree, this song is the perfect example of Mika being more in her comfort zone when it comes to the vocals. Simple track, but very effective.\n\nImmediately moving on to the A-side of the previous song, LOVE IS ECSTASY. I’m already convinced that this is the best song on the entire album and maybe even the most impressive Mika song I’ve ever heard (makes me think about trying her NANA albums sometime). This song is very heavy and fierce when compared to everything else on this album, one reason for me to love it so much. The ‘lalalala‘ chants in the chorus are actually very catchy so this is THE standout song for me.\n\nSo, Mika can do some dance/pop songs as well? BE REAL surprised me by having a distinct disco sound with a drum machine, lots of synths and a regular clubbing song tempo. The little piano/keyboard notes in the hooks are a little unexpected but they made this track a nice experience altogether. If this was a song by any other artist it would’ve been a regular song, but coming from Mika it impressed me.\n\nThe B-side to Ashita Sekai ga Owaru Nara, SUPER WOMAN, is a complete 180 from everything that came before it on the tracklist, including its A-side. Still, this showgirl tune is quite a funny track that can easily remind you of songs like ‘EYES SMOKE MAGIC’ (Ayumi Hamasaki) and ‘show girl’ (Koda Kumi). The vocals could’ve been a bit more dosed, but still I enjoy the fun and quircky ambience of this track.\n\nThe background melody in SUPREME reminds me sooo much of ‘Stand By Me’, so it instantly caught my attention. The song is like a combination of BE REAL and SUPER WOMAN, combining tempo and just a hint of dance/pop with quircky jazz elements and brass instruments. It’s nothing you must take too seriously, like the previous song, you just gotta enjoy this and everything that comes with it (and that includes most of the vocals too).\n\nI was afraid of encountering a ballad here, but Pierce is more of a midtempo song with some soft tribal drums, an acoustic guitar and piano contrasting with the loud saxophone notes in the background. Original, I admit it, but maybe they needed to tone down the saxophone a little. Even though it’s the frst midtempo song after some ballads and a lot of different types of uptempo song, the chorus of this song reminded me a bit too much of songs like Hatsukoi (because of some pitchy notes). Still, not bad.\n\nThe ‘Christmas song that accompanied Hatsukoi on its single’ is next: Kioku. I only call this a ‘Christmas song’ because of its piano music and bells accompanying it in the background, but other than that it’s just a normal ballad. My opinion on this song is that it kicks Hatuskoi‘s ass any day, but now compared to the rest of the tracks on this album this track comes out a bit iffy. It’s cute and not your everyday ballad, but it’s also not a big standout song to get attached to or anything.\n\nNow Epilogue has a nice twist on the original ballad concepts on this album; it’s more of a blues ballad that instantly distances itsself from all the other musical styles I’ve encountered until now. The typical blues tempo and brass instruments work perfectly with the funky notes from a soft electric guitar and even a gospel background choir to really mix things up. For a simple blues ballad, it’s very effective and it’s one of the better tracks on the album.\n\nAs the last track on the album, we have LETTER, another ballad. It’s the simplest one on the album with just a piano and acoustic guitar accompanying Mika’s soft, high pitched vocals. As long as she doesn’t sing ‘killer high notes’, everything is fine. Besides the very good vocals most of the time, this song doesn’t leave a big impression on me because there are a lot of other songs that offer a bit more excitement. Still she gave it a very good try.\n\nI was so reluctant to review this album, just look at the comments I gave the singles. And let’s be honest, it’s a well known fatc that I’m not exactly in love with Mika’s vocals either. What surprised me was that, as soon as the first three ballad tracks were over, tracks 4 through 9 were all uptempo and I instantly bombed them as album favorites (all of my album favorites are uptempo tracks for that matter). Mika needs to do songs like that a bit more often, it suits her more than those emotional ballads in which she has such pitchy vocals. If she can also balance the tracklisting a bit more, I’m gonna have my hopes up for next time.\n\nFavorite tracks: DEAR | PASSION | You Knocked Me Out | LOVE IS ECSTASY | BE REAL | SUPER WOMAN | SUPREME | Epilogue\n\nOVERALL RATING\n\n3½ stars\n\nMika Nakashima – Hatsukoi\n\nJanuary 30, 2013 at 4:39 PM | Posted in Mika Nakashima | Leave a comment\n\nSINGLE REVIEW\n\nMika Nakashima – Hatsukoi\n\n1. Hatsukoi\n\n2. Kioku\n\n3. Ashita Sekai ga Owaru Nara ~World’s End Ver.~\n\n4. Hatsukoi (Instrumental)\n\nHatsukoi is the thirty-sixth single by Japanese singer Mika Nakashima, released on December 5, 2012. The title track was used as the theme song for the movie Kyou, Koi wo Hajimemasu. The single debuted at #14 on the Oricon Weekly Charts and has sold 12,126 copies to date.\n\nMoving into another Mika ballad, the musical composition of Hatsukoi actually gives me goosebumps with its beautiful piano melody and strings arrangement. I love how Mika controls her vocals in the verses, she actually sounds better than usual, but then in the chorus she’s singing in her higher register and it’s just pitchy, almost makes me go haywire. Thank god most of the song is a little less pitchy and icky, I think I have to listen to the instrumental if I want the music.\n\nKioku apparently is the holiday inspired song of the two major tracks on this single, and even though it’s January, bring it on. Her vocals are a bit better than in the previous track and there is nothing wrong with the cute piano/bells arrangement of the song so I guess I instantly prefer this one over that icky A-side. The melodies aren’t that special, but this B-side still kicks the A-side’s ass any day.\n\nAshita Sekai ga Owaru Nara ~World’s End Ver.~ is just like its original, not my favorite, they just made it a little creepier with some sound effects on the background. Trying to scare everyone for 2012.12.21 or what..? WE’RE STILL HERE. Conclusion: the song loses some of its impact, haha. It succeeds in making the original scarier, but that’s it.\n\nI wasn’t impressed by this single, I just said I’d prefer the B-side because I had to pick one song that I actually liked a little bit on this single. Mika’s vocals ruin almost every good song, I had hoped she started to sound better throughout the years but I really would like her to take some singing lessons (which she probably won’t). But because I just dislike her vocals and her music is very pretty, I won’t be too severe. If you like Mika’s ballad, than this is the single for you. If you dont, KEEP OUT.\n\nOVERALL RATING\n\n3 stars\n\nMika Nakashima – Ashita Sekai ga Owaru Nara\n\nJanuary 30, 2013 at 4:20 PM | Posted in Mika Nakashima | Leave a comment\n\nSINGLE REVIEW\n\nMika Nakashima – Ashita Sekai ga Owaru Nara\n\n1. Ashita Sekai ga Owaru Nara\n\n2. SUPER WOMAN\n\n3. Dear -DJ AMIGA REMIX-\n\n4. Ashita Sekai ga Owaru Nara (Instrumental)\n\nAshita Sekai ga Owaru Nara is the thirty-fifth single by Mika Nakashima, released on September 19, 2012. The title track was used as the theme song for the movie Resident Evil: Retribution. The single debuted at #9 on the Oricon Weekly Charts and has sold 16,714 copies to date.\n\nWow, Resident Evil, that’s pretty awesome. Ashita Sekai ga Owaru Nara really sounds like this ending theme song to a movie like that, since it is fairly dark and mysterious. It eventually builds from being small, with just a piano accompanying Mika, into something stronger and more foreboding. I have to say that I’m really on the edge with Mika’s vocals here, and now I know what’s wrong: she overuses her vibrato and sounds like she has a lot of difficulty singing this song. But alright, if I have to judge this song by the music only, then it’s a good song.\n\nEhrm, I really didn’t expect SUPER WOMAN to be this showgirl kind of track with a jazzy piano melody, brass instruments and background singers. Thank god Mika herself sounds way better here, exept for her pronunciation of the title words (‘My name is ‘super wuman’). I think it’s good how they tried to contrast the A-side with the B-side when it comes to the sounds, and if I have to choose I’d pick this one over the A-side anytime. Even though this isn’t the best song ever either.\n\nDear -DJ AMIGA REMIX- luckily isn’t some kind of dance remix, they actually retained the original acoustic guitar sound! All they did was mixing in some more beats, and I think they even turned up the tempo of the song. It definitely has more of a kick now, I love what they did to it.\n\nI’m not sure whether I will ever like the A-side, and Mika herself screwed up half of the B-side, but still I have to give this single some points for its balanced concept and musical styles. The music for all three tracks was very good, Mika tackled about every musical style there is with this single, but I’m sorry I just can’t stand her vocals sometimes. It’s like she has difficulty singing both lower and higher notes and long notes. Apart from that, I guess she did alright again, with the remix being the best song on this single.\n\nOVERALL RATING\n\n3½ stars\n\nMika Nakashima – LOVE IS ECSTASY\n\nJanuary 30, 2013 at 4:04 PM | Posted in Mika Nakashima | Leave a comment\n\nSINGLE REVIEW\n\nMika Nakashima – LOVE IS ECSTASY\n\n1. LOVE IS ECSTASY\n\n2. You Knocked Me Out\n\n3. LOVE IS ECSTASY (Instrumental)\n\n4. You Knocked Me Out (Instrumental)\n\nLOVE IS ECSTASY is the thirty-fourth single by Japanese singer Mika Nakashima, released on September 14, 2011. The title track was used as the theme song for the movie Unfair the answer featuring actress Shinohara Ryoko. The single reached #9 on the Oricon weekly charts and charted for 7 weeks.\n\nWow, LOVE IS ECSTASY is sooo different from the previous song, it’s like she used her NANA character for this one. From the very first electric guitar note, this song was all over the place with its energetic rock atmosphere, and I totally loved it. Mika herself is performing so much better now, rock songs fit her very well and this way her lower and longer notes come out better as well. The chorus is as simple as it gets with some chanting, but it’s very uplifting and catchy. It’s the best Mika song I’ve heard yet.\n\nYou Knocked Me Out fits the overall ambience of the single, but it takes the rock style down a notch with a more funky pop/rock approach. Even though Mika’s vocals weren’t bad on the A-side, she sounds like she’s more in her comfy zone with this track and it puts me at ease as well. I really don’t like her Engrish, but besides that this is an alright B-side.\n\nMika ‘knocked me out’ with this single by delivering something she rarely tackles these days. LOVE IS ECSTASY woke me up from the very first second and let me make a jaw drop because I was both surprised by the sound and I loved the style combined with her vocals. Yep, those vocals keep bugging me, but as soon as Mika does rock, apparently something changes in her performance. I’m curious about the other two singles of this era, and if it gets any better than this.\n\nOVERALL RATING\n\n4½ stars\n\nMika Nakashima – Dear\n\nJanuary 30, 2013 at 3:51 PM | Posted in Mika Nakashima | Leave a comment\n\nSINGLE REVIEW\n\nMika Nakashima – Dear\n\n1. Dear\n\n2. A MIRACLE FOR YOU (2011)\n\n3. Dear (Instrumental)\n\n4. A MIRACLE FOR YOU (2011) (Instrumental)\n\nDear is the thirty-third single by Japanese singer Mika Nakashima, released on April 27, 2011. The title track was used as the theme song for the movie Youkame no Semi. This single includes a new recorded version of her 2002 song “A MIRACLE FOR YOU” and it was used as the CASIO “Sheen” commercial song. The single reached #8 on the Oricon weekly charts and charted for 8 weeks.\n\nDear opens with a lovely acoustic guitar melody after which more instruments like strings and even a cute little saxophone melody comes in every now and then. It’s a ballad, obviously, but when it comes to the music it’s a very pleasant and, if you ask me, original ballad. I just hoped that Mika’s vocals would’ve progressed throughout the years, but when she sings full out I find her vocals borderline annoying (it’s bearable in the verses). She gets better as the song develops more and eventually it’s an alright ballad with enough for me to enjoy it.\n\nApparently they revamped the original track into A MIRACLE FOR YOU (2011), and at the time I’m writing this I don’t know the 2002 version yet so no comparisons here. The strings opening and overall composition reminds me of stuff Ayu would do on her classical albums, but nonetheless it’s beautiful even though it’s the second ballad on this single. It’s a lovely piano driven ballad with some extra strings to make it a little more dramatic every now and then, and even Mika’s vocals are a bit better than on the A-side (except when she tries to sustain long notes but w/e). Lovely track, and as soon as I heard the original I’ll make a comparison haha.\n\nI think I’ll never appreciate Mika’s vocals for the full 100% since she isn’t good at singing long notes clearly enough, which I usually dislike. Nevertheless, when she controls her vocals she does have the power to deliver a song in the right way, and she did well with this ballad-only single. Both songs differed in approach, with the title track being the acoustic guitar track with some minor experimental touches (such as the saxophone) and the B-side contrasting with that by using a classical composition. That’s how you keep a single interesting enough, Mika!\n\nOVERALL RATING\n\n4 stars\n\nMika Nakashima – TRUE\n\nAugust 28, 2012 at 10:09 PM | Posted in Mika Nakashima | Leave a comment\n\nALBUM REVIEW\n\nMika Nakashima – TRUE\n\n1.

A MIRACLE FOR YOU\n\n♦ ♦ ♦\n\nTRUE is the debut album by Japanese singer Mika Nakashima, released on February 28, 2002. It reached #1 on the Oricon charts, selling 451,230 copies in its first week. Because it sold 996,680 copies in 2002, it became the #8 album of that year. Overall, this album charted for 80 weeks and sold a total of 1,173,534 units.\n\nMika, you can’t find a worse song than AMAZING GRACE (album version) to open the album. Then again, you can’t find a worse song in her entire discography as far as I know. After the sound of some waves, beautiful but simple strings come in. After a shorter time than on the single Mika starts singing and it’s just plain awful. ‘Amazing glase‘? Her English is just bad and she sounds off all the time. Good thing we got rid of it already. Terrible opener.\n\nLuckily the song that is my favorite A-side from the first era comes in to save the first couple of tracks. WILL (album version) is an extremely pretty ballad, almost like a power ballad actually because Mika is sometimes belting out her lyrics and she finally doesn’t suck at it. The album version is slightly different than the original, for here the jazzy elements are replaced by a more dominant piano arrangement together with some more strings. I must say, I like this version more.\n\nI’m glad ONE SURVIVE (album version) didn’t get rid of that amazing hybrid of disco and jazz, they did with the remix on the single and I wasn’t very happy about it because it took away some of the originality of the track. But here we are with the first uptempo track on the album, complete with the disco beat, strings accents and the additional brassy elements to make it ~jazz disco~! I’ve come to love this one.\n\nHEAVEN ON EARTH strangely enough incorporates some R&B in the overall poppy arrangement, and I said ‘strangely’ because most of the time Mika + R&B = meh. Still she managed to create a catchy song with some good R&B beats, nice harp accents, bells and she shows off some good vocals herself as well. Her English isn’t that good though, but I knew that from hearing AMAZING GRACE.\n\nDESTINY’S LOTUS is one of the more funkier songs on the album for its use of the bass and electric guitar, which was extremely infectuous. The beat is fast, the strings accents are a nice addition as well, in short I have gotten more used to this song and I really like it now for its cool arrangement. Mika’s vocals are a little iffy but not bad, and the random rap section was pretty awesome this time too.\n\nIt’s such a shame this next song has a very nice sound when it comes to the music, but vocally, it’s the same story as AMAZING GRACE had. Helpless Rain is the song that when I see the title, it almost makes me cry. The music is very smooth, R&B influenced, but the vocals… Mika is really stressing her vocals in the chorus and she totally sucks at singing the high notes. Probably her worst song ever and it could’ve been so much more.\n\nFrom just three new tracks on the album, I is the second. It’s another R&B influenced song, pretty smooth arranged with a not too heavy beat, soft bass en electric guitar riffs, some scratches and a pretty cool harmonica solo in the bridge. Mika’s vocals are still high in the chorus, maybe still a little too high for her own comfort but at least she’s not almost choking on her own pitch. The entire song has a feeling of peace, nice to tone things down for a moment.\n\nWhich takes us to another ballad and in fact the oldest on the album: TEARS (粉雪が舞うように…). This ballad still reminds me of nighttime, a lullaby, since it’s so peaceful and harmonious. The arrangement is minimal, with just some strings and later a very soft background beat. That beat is what makes it more ethereal and magical thanks to the echoed sound. A long track, but it’s the equivalent of ‘beautiful’.\n\nAh, TRUE EYES, my dear unorthodox song. This uptempo disco influenced track includes an amazing additional arrangement with a flute and sitar, next to the usual strings and beats. The flute makes it a little more freestyle jazz at some points, which works very cool. ONE SURVIVE is the sister song, but when I think of the arrangements this is definitely my fav of the siblings.\n\nI remember loving CRESCENT MOON for its amazing use of the strings arrangement, especially since it’s another disco beat driven song and it still reminds me so much of the Spice Girls song ‘Never Give Up On The Good Times’ when the strings start playing. The strings are also what makes this song a little funkier, and it’s pretty catchy. Mika has a good vocal performance here, even with the higher notes. Good job.\n\nOkay, what happened to that beautiful R&B ballad we had on the single??! Apparently, JUST TRUST IN OUR LOVE (album version) is a DANCE TRACK. Guess that’s why the title’s suddenly written with caps lock. Anywayz, it still works very well and if there is any ballad song that you can turn into an uptempo track, it’s this one. They gave it the same kind of flavor as tracks like TRUE EYES and CRESCENT MOON, but I really like that style. Works fine if you ask me. Good ‘remix’.\n\nSTARS (album version) doesn’t differ much from the original, other than being a little bit jazzier. It’s still the same enjoyable ballad song with a soft beat in the choruses, many strings and some brass instruments. I know I said before that Mika sounds a little insecure singing this song, but now I must say she sounds a lot better on this track than on some others. Her vocals are actually very good here so this is definitely one of my favorite tracks on the album.\n\nThe last track on the album is also the last new track, making everything come full circle. A MIRACLE FOR YOU opens beautifully with a piano and strings, after which a background choir and some fingersnaps join in. I think this is the only Mika song that is a little bit gospel inspired and it’s simply breathtaking. Beautiful melodies, music, vocals… Perfect album closer and a good long track as well.\n\nI’m glad I took the time to listen to Mika’s singles first before reviewing this album, otherwise I would’ve never gotten used to her voice and style and I would actually tune out after hearing AMAZING GRACE (please ban that crap). I’m even happier now to know there’s so much more to this girl and she made quite an enjoyable album. With many recognizeable tracks, that’s true, but at least she releases some quality material and her new tracks fit perfectly between the already existing songs. I’m beginning to understand why this album sold far over a million units.\n\nFavorite tracks: WILL (album version) | ONE SURVIVE (album version) | HEAVEN ON EARTH | DESTINY’S LOTUS | TEARS (粉雪が舞うように…) | TRUE EYES | CRESCENT MOON | STARS (album version) | A MIRACLE FOR YOU\n\nOVERALL RATING\n\n4½ stars\n\nMika Nakashima – WILL\n\nAugust 28, 2012 at 4:52 PM | Posted in Mika Nakashima | Leave a comment\n\nSINGLE REVIEW\n\nMika Nakashima – WILL\n\n1. WILL\n\n2. Just trust in our love\n\n3. WILL (Instrumental)\n\n4. Just trust in our love (Instrumental)\n\nWILL is the fifth single by Japanese singer Mika Nakashima, released on August 7, 2002. This single reached #3 on Oricon and sold a total of 144,771 units.\n\nNow I know for sure ballads are definitely Mika’s thing, since I haven’t heard anything so beautiful from hers since ‘STARS’. WILL is a beautiful, emotional and yet simple piano ballad with some additional strings. It’s a pop ballad with a little bit of jazz somewhere too, and since Mika’s not stressing any high notes it’s such a pretty song and nice to listen to.\n\nJust trust our love surprisingly has an R&B touch, just like her previous single but then again this works out way better since it’s another ballad. Again her vocals are way better, and I have the strange feeling she might have taken some classes by now to improve them. Her voice is perfect for these songs, soft ballads, although this one has a smoother edge because of the nice R&B beats.\n\nWILL is a breath of fresh air in her early discography, and Mika should just stick to doing ballads. Releasing another all-ballad single like her debut was a good idea, and this is now my favorite single of the entire first era together with ‘STARS’ (okay I like this one more). Both tracks on this single were gorgeous, they were easy to tell apart because of the different influences (pop/jazz vs R&B), so both stand out. Recommended single if you don’t know her music and want to try out some of her earlier works!\n\nOVERALL RATING\n\n5 stars\n\nMika Nakashima – Helpless Rain\n\nAugust 28, 2012 at 4:06 PM | Posted in Mika Nakashima | Leave a comment\n\nSINGLE REVIEW\n\nMika Nakashima – Helpless Rain\n\n1. Helpless Rain\n\n2. Helpless Rain (But I’m fallin’ too deep)\n\n3. Destiny’s Lotus (Version)\n\n4. Helpless Rain (Instrumental)\n\nHelpless Rain is the fourth single by Japanese singer Mika Nakashima, released on May 15, 2002. This single reached #8 on Oricon charts and charted for six weeks. It sold 82,830 units.\n\nHelpless Rain isn’t like anything Mika has done before, with the song following a clear R&B style with heavier beats. Other instruments include a piano, strings and an acoustic guitar. It works pretty well, even for her, but my god… the vocals. Mika is singing these really high notes in the chorus and she’s just stressing them, failing epically at singing them with a clear voice. Too bad, since the rest of the song is actually very good!\n\nHelpless Rain (But I’m fallin’ too deep) actually has the same sound as the original version, minus the strings (so the arrangement is kinda spread thin) and adding a rapping section which was fine. I’m getting used to Mika’s vocals here, except for that one extreme high note which was still hideous. Okay, good track, but still not loving it all that much because of that issue. The rapping sections by Heartsdales made it more interesting though.\n\nAt first I thought Destiny’s Lotus (Version) was not only lacking a proper title but an arrangement as well, with Mika singing her first verse with minimal instruments accompanying her. Then the entire thing turned around and luckily a good fast beat, synths and guitars were added, kinda like in the original version. The rapping sections by (I believe) VERBAL were pretty good too, spiced up the track a bit.\n\nSo we all know Helpless Rain isn’t Mika’s best single, and she probably knows it too. The A-side was vocally her worst track yet, but ONLY because of that one notte she screw up big time throughout the entire track. So that was quite a bummer, but luckily the rest of the track was good enough for me to like it. The other version also appealed to me, perhaps because Heartsdales gave it a little more oomph than the original had. Destiny’s Lotus (Version) still has a weird title.\n\nOVERALL RATING\n\n3½ stars\n\nMika Nakashima – ONE SURIVE\n\nAugust 28, 2012 at 3:46 PM | Posted in Mika Nakashima | Leave a comment\n\nSINGLE REVIEW\n\nMika Nakashima – ONE SURVIVE\n\n1. ONE SURVIVE\n\n2. TRUE EYES\n\n3. CRESCENT MOON (Gonga Massive Version)\n\n4. ONE SURVIVE (Blaze Shelter Remix)\n\n5. ONE SURVIVE (Instrumental)\n\n6. TRUE EYES (Instrumental)\n\nONE SURVIVE is the third single by Japanese singer Mika Nakashima, released on March 6, 2002. This single reached #8 on Oricon charts and charted for seven weeks. It sold 86,600 units.\n\nONE SURVIVE has a very nice style, being a kind of jazz/disco hybrid. It has the beats and strings accents of a typical 70s disco song, but the brass instruments are what provide the little hint of jazz, just like the little freestyle part in the bridge. Mika’s vocals are a little more pleasant to listen to, she’s going full out with her voice but she’s doing a really good job maintaining control over her voice. Definitely better than what the previous single had to offer.\n\nThe B-side is a bit of the same genre, it has the same uptempo dance sound but there are some differences too. TRUE EYES is slightly slower and I love how the arrangement includes a flute and even a soft sitar in the background, with the beats, synths and strings playing the biggest parts of all. Even though it shows similarities to the A-side, I can see the differences enough to make me love this track as well.\n\nCRESCENT MOON (Gonga Massive Version) is basically the original song with a more extensive arrangement, but I barely noticed it. I had to listen to the original first again to look for the differences, so that’s a bit of a bummer. So apart from some extra percussion and guitars, this version isn’t that ‘massive’. Still good though.\n\nNow ONE SURVIVE (Blaze Shelter Remix) does in fact sound different from its original version (but then again we can’t all have Ayu’s remixers who can almost alter a song beyond recognition). This remix is less jazzy than the original, still maintaining the disco sound with the beats and strings accents, but the brassy instruments are gone so the only jazz feel comes from the piano. Apart from being not much of a remix but more like an alternate version, it’s still a good track.\n\nFour uptempo tracks on one single can’t be bad all the time, this single actually proved it could work. Some say all the tracks sound alike. The only issue I noticed was that the remixes sounded a little too much like their original songs, but I eventually was okay with that. ONE SURVIVE was a good track for being the third single, it was definitely better than the previous A-side if you ask me. TRUE EYES was a fun song too with the sitar and flute, pretty original. Yup, good single.\n\nOVERALL RATING\n\n4½ stars\n\nMika Nakashima – CRESCENT MOON\n\nAugust 27, 2012 at 8:06 PM | Posted in Mika Nakashima | Leave a comment\n\nSINGLE REVIEW\n\nMika Nakashima – CRESCENT MOON\n\n1. CRESCENT MOON\n\n2. DESTINY’S LOTUS\n\n3. AMAZING GRACE\n\n4. CRESCENT MOON (Instrumental)\n\n5. DESTINY’S LOTUS (Instrumental)\n\nCRESCENT MOON is the second single by Japanese singer Mika Nakashima, released on February 6, 2002. It was limited to 100,000 copies. The single reached #4 on the Oricon charts and sold all copies in just four weeks.\n\nCRESCENT MOON surprises me for having such a dance driven sound, kinda like ‘Never Give Up On The Good Times’ by the Spice Girls, you know. It has some really good beats and the strings have the perfect arrangement here, being not only the background group but providing some nice accents here and there as well. It makes the song a little funkier. Mika’s vocals are very good in this song, and they reach their best in the bridge when she sings some high notes too.\n\nDid I say CRESCENT MOON was funky? That’s probably because I hadn’t heard DESTINY’S LOTUS at that time, the B-side. This song is even more uptempo than the A-side, the beats are a lot catchier, the strings accents come back stronger and I love the funky guitar riffs that make this song so memorable. In fact, I think I like this song even more than the A-side (yes, even that male rap in the bridge was pretty infectuous), so I’m very glad this is on the album!\n\nThe sound of waves opening AMAZING GRACE is pretty soothing, then it tends to get a little more mysterious when it comes to the music. When Mika herself starts singing, she sounds a little off key at the beginning, in my opinion. It gets a little bit better after that, but her entire performance remains iffy. I don’t know, it just doesn’t sound that good. Too bad.\n\n‘STARS’ was a better single, period. CRESCENT MOON was a nice song, but the B-side was even better and a lot funkier and more danceable. AMAZING GRACE should be banned, I was pretty close to hating her off vocals on that one. I know, she does a lot better than some other artists, but even her English was bad so I’m gonna stick to my honest opinion. Still, this single didn’t disappoint me too much since the first two songs were very good individual tracks with good music and already a sound switch for Mika after two ballads. I’ll forget about the third track, I’ll just take the first two and stop right there.\n\nOVERALL RATING\n\n3½ stars\n\nNext Page »"
