        "text": "Sony Music is reportedly in talks to buy the music catalogue of the rock band Queen, including hits like Bohemian Rhapsody, Radio Ga Ga and Another One Bites The Dust.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, Sony is working with another investor on the transaction, which \"could potentially total $1 billion\" (£790 million).\n\nThe BBC understands that negotiations are still under way and may not result in a sale.\n\nIf it goes ahead, the deal would cover Queen's songs and all related intellectual property - including the rights to logos, music videos, merchandise, publishing and other business opportunities.\n\nDiscussions over the sale have been taking place since last year.\n\nUniversal Music is also said to have been involved, owing to the company’s longstanding relationship with the band, who signed with the British label EMI in 1972 and remained with the company after it was bought by Universal in 2011.\n\nIf the group achieve the $1 billion price tag, it will be the biggest deal of its kind, surpassing the $500 million (£393 million) that Sony paid to acquire Bruce Springsteen’s catalogue in late 2021.\n\nEarlier this year, Sony also acquired a 50% interest in Michael Jackson’s music from the late singer’s estate - at a cost of at least $600 million (£472 million).\n\nQueen are more popular than either of those artists, with 52 million monthly listeners on Spotify - compared to 41 million for Jackson and 20 million for Springsteen.\n\nThat's partly thanks to the success of the biopic Bohemian Rhapsody and the band's ongoing tours with singer Adam Lambert, but mainly because songs like Crazy Little Thing Called Love and We Will Rock You remain globally popular and extremely lucrative.\n\nIn the UK, the first volume of Queen's Greatest Hits is the most popular album of all time, with sales in excess of 7 million copies.\n\nIt was even the 20th-biggest seller of 2023, beating new releases by Ed Sheeran and the Rolling Stones.\n\nAccording to its most recent financial statements, Queen Productions Ltd made $52 million (£42 million) in the year ending September 2022.\n\nThe proceeds are shared equally between guitarist Brian May, drummer Roger Taylor, bass player John Deacon and the estate of late singer Freddie Mercury.\n\nThe sale of music catalogues has become a big business over the last eight years, with record labels and private equity companies snapping up the rights to music by David Bowie, Bob Dylan, Justin Bieber, Shakira, Neil Young, Blondie and Fleetwood Mac for multi-million dollar sums.\n\nThe deals provide immediate financial security to the artists and their estates, while the rights holders hope to profit by building new revenue streams for the music via film and TV licensing, merchandise, cover versions and performance royalties.\n\nMusic rights are seen as an attractive investment because songs continue to generate money for decades.\n\nHowever, the business has seen some turmoil as rising interest rates undercut the long-term valuation of hit songs.\n\nThe investment fund Hipgnosis, which owns the rights to music by artists from Beyoncé to Barry Manilow, recently agreed to a $1.6bn takeover by the private equity firm Blackstone, after months of turmoil over the company’s governance and management structure."
