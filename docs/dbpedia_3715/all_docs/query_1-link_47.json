        "text": "Mika Nakashima releases ‚ÄúWish‚Äù, the ending theme song for the re-release of the anime movie adaptation of Berserk\n\nMika ‚ÄòBury me in contact lenses‚Äô Nakashima is getting that anime money with her song ‚ÄúWish‚Äù, which acts as the ending theme song for the TV adaptation for Berserk: The Golden Age Arc.\n\nBerserk: The Golden Age Arc is a trilogy of films which were released theatrically in 2012 and 2013 - adapted from the Berserk manga series. This TV adaptation isn‚Äôt even really an adaptation. It‚Äôs just a remastered and re-edited version of the films, which features a new song from Mika and some additional pieces of music for the score itself from the original composers Shir≈ç Sagisu and Susumu Hirasawa.\n\n‚ÄúWish‚Äù is a really nice song, and one which I feel suits Mika. I *Turns and looks in the camera* WISH that these types of songs made a comeback in J-pop for the holiday season, and bitches would bring out the white fur and the snow. So shout-outs to Mika for giving me some of what I‚Äôve been needing.\n\nBUT...the thing with Mika is that every song she does, I think of about four other artists who could have done it better. Kumi Koda woulda handled this business. Ayaka woulda handled this business. Sayuri Sugawara has handled this business. Crystal Kay woulda handled this business. Even Miliyah Kato woulda handled this business.\n\nMika Nakashima - Wish | ¬© 2022 Sony Music Labels Inc.\n\nMika just doesn‚Äôt put enough of a stamp on her songs. Songs like ‚ÄúWish‚Äù are a yen a dozen in Japanese music, so it can be difficult to release a song like this and have it stand out unless it‚Äôs tied to something, which Mika‚Äôs fortunately is. But just taking the song on its own, Mika sounds good, but doesn't push the song to the heights feel it should have gone. Even in the music video it feels like she‚Äôs not giving as much as she could to sell the song. The set and the styling is doing all of the work.\n\nMika is just such an empty vessel to me. I don‚Äôt get what her style is. What her angle is. What space in music she occupies. As much as I‚Äôve dragged the likes of Ayumi Hamasaki and Kumi Koda over the years, at least they have that x-factor and a discernible style - even if they often forget what their own style is and squander it on garbage material. The only thing about Mika Nakahsima that stands out to me is the consistency of her album covers, using the same typefaces and iconography. But the music? It‚Äôs anybody music. But good on her for still being here, selling albums and remaining of relevance to still get high profile tie-ins. Not every bitch is able to say the same. Even some of my faves.\n\nüíø Album review: Joker"
