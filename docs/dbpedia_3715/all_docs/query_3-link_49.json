        "text": "Sony Music Publishing Nashville and CAM Creative have signed Ryan Larkins to a global publishing deal.\n\nLarkins has written with the likes of Tony Lane, Tom Douglas, Lee Thomas Miller, Craig Wiseman, Tim Nichols, Rhett Akins, Ben Hayslip and Bill Anderson. Notably, Larkins co-wrote Anderson and Dolly Parton’s Grammy-nominated song “Someday It’ll All Make Sense.” He recently achieved chart success with his work on Cody Johnson’s “The Painter,” which reached No. 1 on Billboard’s Country Airplay chart. The song also earned a Song of the Year nomination at this year’s ACM Awards, marking Larkins’ first-ever nomination. In addition to making a name for himself as a country music songwriter, the Red Street Records artist released his debut EP, Meet Ryan Larkins, in October.\n\n“From the moment I first met Ryan, it was obvious he had the heart of a true American storyteller. His songs carry the spirit, emotions and images that make country music special,” says Rusty Gaston, Sony Music Publishing Nashville CEO. “It has been amazing to watch him celebrate his first No. 1 single and now his first major-award nomination, and we look forward to many more of his successes in the future.”\n\nLarkins has also expanded his team by signing with Huskins-Harris for business management and McClanahan Management for artist management.\n\n“From the first time I saw Ryan play four years ago at a writers night I knew I wanted to be a part of his career. Not often does an artist come along with such deep integrity, authenticity and talent,” says Carole-Ann Mobley, CAM Creative Founder. “I am lucky to be a part of his journey with my longtime friends at Sony Music Publishing. Rusty Gaston and his team share the vision, as do Trisha McClanahan and Becky Harris, of how special Ryan Larkins is and we are watching it come to fruition together.”"
