"Black & Blue" was used in CMs that aired in early 2006 by KATE. This single reached #8 on Oricon charts.

The music of the song was written by Lensei, an Australian musician, who also wrote the music for Nakashima Mika's song "Rocking Horse", which was released as an album track on her album 'Music'.
