A Tamil newspaper editor and former member of the Sri Lanka parliament has been murdered. Sinnathamby Sivamaharajah, 68, the managing director of the Tamil-language Namathu Eelanadu, was shot dead outside his home on the besieged Jaffna Peninsula. Joel Simon, executive director of the Committee to Protect Journalists, said: "We are concerned that the killing could be part of a pattern of violence against Tamil journalists and media workers covering this conflict."
