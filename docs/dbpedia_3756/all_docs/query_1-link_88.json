        "text": "A Tamil newspaper editor and former member of the Sri Lanka parliament has been murdered. Sinnathamby Sivamaharajah, 68, the managing director of the Tamil-language Namathu Eelanadu, was shot dead outside his home on the besieged Jaffna Peninsula. Joel Simon, executive director of the Committee to Protect Journalists, said: \"We are concerned that the killing could be part of a pattern of violence against Tamil journalists and media workers covering this conflict.\" (Via cpj.org)\n\nThe Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation has widened the definition of charity by helping a company to acquire newspapers. It was one of a syndicate of lenders that provided finance for MediaNews to buy four California newspapers, including the San Jose Mercury News, from McClatchy. It is not known how much the Gates Foundation paid towards the $350m (£185m) total raised by the syndicate. The privately-owned MediaNews already owns the Oakland Tribune, the Denver Post, the Salt Lake Tribune and the Detroit News. (Via USA Today)\n\nFurther to my posting yesterday about the marginalising of film critics comes this broadside from Jeff Jarvis. He refers to the \"snotty, isolated, egotistical, haughty uselessness\" of critics and refers to one of his previous claims that critics are in danger of extinction. I'm not minded to generalise - intelligent critics can open one's eyes wider - but I share the view that, as a form, film criticism is being challenged to death by the democratic, bottom-up criticism unleashed by the net. (Via BuzzMachine)\n\nConrad Black is facing new charges of tax evasion. US prosecutors have added indictments which allege that the former owner of the Telegraph group \"wilfully caused\" Hollinger International Inc to file false corporate income tax returns by approximately $13m (£6.9m) and $16m (£8.5m) in 1999 and 2000. Black's lawyer, Edward Greenspan, scorned the new charges, saying: \"It has been our position from the very outset that the prosecutor has a weak case... Adding even more unfounded charges doesn't make the prosecutor's case any better.\" (Via CBC)\n\nIt would be foolish to claim that Manchester's experience with a giveaway newspaper will soon be reproduced in London. Foolish, but tempting all the same. It appears that the free edition published by the Manchester Evening News has outstripped expectations. Daily circulation of the free city centre edition has risen to 60,000 copies since its May launch, significantly higher than the planned 50,000 copies. Meanwhile, the paper's paid-for editions are slipping downwards. The next set of officially audited figures are likely to show a 10,000 drop to 120,000. Most of that fall can be attributed to the fact that 7,000 copies previously sold in the city centre are now given away free. Nor have price rises helped.\n\nTime magazine has bowed to the communications revolution by shifting its weekly on-sale date from Monday to Friday. It is also planning both a magazine revamp and an overhaul of its time.com website from next January. In a statement today by Richard Stengel, the managing editor and Ed McCarrick, the company's president and worldwide publisher, they say the magazine is aiming to \"redefine the relationship between the reader, the magazine and time.com as a continuous 24/7 experience.\" It is argued that the new on-sale timing will be a boon to advertisers and readers. Well, they would say that, wouldn't they? But it surely indicates that the magazine is finding competition from the net very tough indeed.

From October, the county's over 60s and its disabled - some 140,000 people - will be able to travel far and wide for free on buses. The new deal has been agreed with bus operators by county, district and city council chiefs after pressure from the paper. As part of its campaign, the News presented a petition to 10 Downing Street. (Via Cambridge News)\n\nInteresting piece from the Daily Telegraph's correspondent in Los Angeles, Catherine Elsworth, on \"the demise of the film critic\". She points out that a record number of movies have opened this year without press screenings, thereby \"demoting the critic to the average Joe with no head start to pronounce on a new release.\" Elsworth says critics are furious that the much-hyped thriller Snakes on a Plane will open tomorrow without offering them a preview. They wonder whether it's a punishment for their scathing reviews of films that did well at the box office, such as The Da Vinci Code and Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest. But she has much more to say. (Via Telegraph Blogs)"
