        "text": "So LTTE is the sole representative of the Tamil people? Can those who say so explain why LTTE and its leader have killed the following Tamil people? If the LTTE, the TNA, the LTTE Diaspora and Tamils on foreign payroll as NGO activists are all making virtually the same demands using the ‘discrimination’ ‘minority rights’ placards as smokescreen, shouldn’t people be wondering whether they are being taken for a ride? How can you anyone agree to a separate mono-ethnic enclave via a new constitution & devolution when clearly all these entities espousing for it have not only been killing Sinhalese, Muslims, foreigners but also killing the very people they say they are fighting for? Does the UNSG, UNHRC head, foreign envoys and all other nosy-parkers understand this! Isnt it strange that the present TNA leaders together with all elements that have been supporting the LTTE underground are demanding to mourn the dead LTTE instead of mourning the Tamil victims of LTTE terror? Are Tamils actually elated that these Tamils are dead and happy that LTTE killed them?\n\nBelow is a very inconclusive list of Tamils killed by LTTE either because they didn’t tow LTTE line or simply because they wanted to live harmoniously with the Sinhalese & Muslims?\n\nThis list is inconclusive though with over 200 names because there are many many Tamils killed by LTTE whose names are not known. These genocide killings will never get any honourable mention even in any UN report.\n\nHowever, no UN, current government or any of the reconciliation bogeys can divide our nation on ethnic lines as was done in Yugoslavia (Kosovo) and South Sudan because LTTE and other militant groups were initially created by India and these groups were formed of low caste Tamils who were happy to take the gun because it gave them power over their own high caste/class people who were degrading them and taking no notice of them because of their caste.\n\nIn holding the gun they had a power over their own people that they never had because of their caste. The upper caste/class quickly turned this around to their own benefit pretending to outsource eelam quest to Prabakaran until such time they could politically capture control knowing that any man who lives by the sword, dies by the sword. Prabakaran was never ready for any political settlement because he knew it would be his end and that is why he vetoed every peace attempt and paper placed before him but used it cunningly to re-group and strategize his next kill. The only time he got caught was when he was frisked off to India and he had to agree to the Indo-Lanka Accord otherwise he would not have been allowed to return to Sri Lanka.\n\nOur leaders have been fooled in not studying not just one enemy but all facets of the enemy in particular the caste reality that prevails still.\n\nWe do not know how many of the many Tamil militant groups that India created were killed by LTTE. We do know the names of their leaders killed by LTTE, but we do not know how many of their members were also cold-bloodedly killed by LTTE.\n\nWe do not know how many LTTE child soldiers were killed by LTTE – during the gruesome training, shot and killed when attempting to flee the training ‘orphanages’ in the thick of the jungle, died from severe training or lack of adequate food or even as a result of diseases or snake bites,\n\nWe do not know how many adult LTTE cadres – men and women faced the same fate either as a result of not following orders, wanting to leave\n\nWe also do not know how many LTTE injured cadres were killed by LTTE during the final stages of the conflict – we know they were put into buses and the buses blown off but we do not have their names or details.\n\nWe do not know how many civilians were also killed by LTTE when trying to flee – we know some of them have horrifying stories to tell. How asking to be freed to give milk to one’s baby ended up in the mother getting a bullet to her head….none of these deaths have had UN tears except attempt to credit the deaths into the Tribunal against our soldiers\n\nWe also do not know the many Tamils who LTTE Diaspora have killed overseas – some for not agreeing to pay monthly ‘tax’, others because they were not agreeable to LTTE philosophy. Many Tamils live in fear still and some Tamils live with injuries as a result of the LTTE sword gangs that prevail in particular throughout UK and EU nations. Most of these Tamils are staying illegally so they cannot even report their state to the police or take hospital treatment lest these incidents are investigated.\n\nThe only Tamil that had cats lives has been EPDP head Douglas Devananda who has managed to survive 10 attempts by LTTE to murder him.\n\nNote the killings of Tamils before 1983 were specifically targeting Tamil policemen to scare them from joining the police and Tamil candidates of the UNP to also scare them from joining political parties that were not only catering to Tamil sentiment.\n\nLTTE have killed\n\nTamil Mayors\n\nTamil policemen\n\nTamil politicians\n\nTamil Academics\n\nTamil public servants\n\nTamil civil servants\n\nTamil religious leaders\n\nTamil Judges\n\nTamil social service workers\n\nTamil students\n\nTamil children\n\nTamil low caste child soldiers\n\nTamil civilians fleeing for safety\n\nTamil engineers\n\nTamil lawyers\n\nTamil journalists/peace activists and other moderates\n\nTamil rival groups & their leaders\n\nTamil businessmen who did not tow the line\n\nIn so doing LTTE made Tamils fear moving with other communities, in TNA and LTTE Diaspora following that same mantra they are also now responsible for the racism that prevails. In UN, foreign governments and other nosy parkers allowing that racism to continue they are not helping people to live in peace but devising ways to piece out island nation and destroy it forever.\n\nDate Killed The Victims 27 July 1975\n\nPrabakaran’s first victim was a Tamil\n\n1. Alfred Duraiappah, Tamil Christian Mayor of Jaffna. Killed by Prabakaran with own gun as he came out of the Vishnu Kovil. The Mayor was just 49 years at the time of his death. He was a lawyer. Amirthalingam’s response was that Duraiapah was killed because he betrayed the ‘cause’. Amirthalingam was also killed by LTTE probably for the same reason! 14 February 1977\n\nPrabakaran’s second victims were Tamil policemen on duty\n\n2. Kandiah Karunanithy PC3164 CID, Kankesanthurai policeHe is the first police officer to be murdered by Tamil militants 7 April 1978\n\nPrabakaran’s second victims were Tamil policemen on duty\n\n3.

Tamils fleeing LTTE for safety –“a young couple who were trying to flee with their child to the government administered area of the North. The LTTE shot had broken a part of the man’s arm but it had also blown out the brains of the little child. Yet he did not want to show the mother that the child had died. He took a piece of mat and wrapped the corpse in it, and in anguish and desperation took a jungle route to freedom. By the time he had met the Army after many days fleeing, hiding from the terrorists there were maggots in his hand but he was still clinging on to the remains of his child when he met the Army men”. (quoting Vijitha Nakkawita)We do not know how many more Tamils the LTTE killed when fleeing. All of these deaths the UN is trying to pin on the Sri Lanka Army as no mention of these firings get into any UN report. The double standards are making a mockery of the UN system and officials.\n\nNo freedom fighters kill their own people. Terrorists have no religion, no ethnicity and no love for their nation. They are motivated by killing and the profits they make from it. All those who held guns are still better than the Tigers in suits who are now openly moving around us preaching peace when they were always part of the murderous cult to divide the nation.\n\nDon’t you wonder why TNA, Northern Chief Minister Wigneswaran, academics and students of the Jaffna University et al wish to commemorate LTTE dead (as seen by the drama they made out of LTTE Thileepan) and why none of them has so much as lit a candle for any of the above killed by LTTE. Doesn’t this expose all of the culprits and their lies about ‘looking after their own people’\n\nShenali D Waduge\n\n“Tamils who escaped terror still praising SL Army” www.priu.gov.lk"
