        "text": "Prageeth Ekneliyagoda ! We are with you though you are gone for the last 6 years !! Attend the ‘Reminiscences’ Day on 26 th\n\n(Lanka-e-News -24.Jan.2016, 8.20PM) It is six years ago today, Lanka e news journalist Prageeth Ekneliyagoda was abducted , and subsequently murdered. He left Lanka e news office at Rajagiriya on 24 th January 2010 at about 7.30 in the night , and that was the last we saw of him. Today, exactly six years have elapsed since his disappearance.\n\nIt has by now come to light that he was abducted by murderous army officers of the Girithale army camp , and that he was taken for questioning pertaining to a book written by him about the Rajapakse family. The army murderers are now in remand custody but the investigations are still not concluded.\n\nThe reason for this undue delay is because the army had not furnishe 14 documents relating to the investigation requested by the CID . These are documents that are connected with the exposures made by the army officers (suspects) during the interrogations. Despite the court too having ordered to furnish these documents ,regrettably those have still not been given.\n\nPresident Maithripala Sirisena who came to power after making solemn promises and pledges that the criminals involved in the abduction and disappearance of Ekneliyagoda will be brought before the law , must hold himself responsible when the army is holding back the documents requested, and on top of that providing legal assistance to the army officers who are suspects in this crime , because as the chief of the commanding forces the president is duty bound to give an explanation why army criminals are so protected.\n\nThe president seems to be cherishing his favorite trait of not matching word with deed . As is always the case with him - promising one thing and doing the wrong thing , in this instance too he is enslaved by this habit obviously. This lukewarm attitude of Maithripala is demonstrative that his conduct is tantamount to a betrayal worse than that of Ruwan Ferdinands the villainous scoundrel who handed over the draft of Ekneliyagoda’s book to the Rajapakses- the president is hence guilty of the worst betrayal ever of this century.\n\nMeanwhile ,the National intellectual Board which was pioneered by Ekneliyagoda in 2010 , is taking measures to conduct a program under the name of ‘Reminiscences of Ekneliyagoda’ at the German Cultural center , Gregory’s road , Colombo 07 on 26 th January at 3.00 p.m. The organizers are inviting all Prageeth’s friends and associates to be present on the occasion.\n\nPrageeth ! Even though you are not in our midst , we are always with you. Lanka e news staff , viewers , friends and well wishers hereby solemnly and sincerely vow that we shall not give up on our campaign until the last criminal responsible for your death and despair of your family is punished duly !!\n\n---------------------------\n\nby (2016-01-24 14:54:07)\n\nRead 48612 Times"
