Sivamaharajah, managing director of the Tamil-language Namathu Eelanadu, was shot dead in Vellippalai. The motive was unclear.\n\nSivamaharajah, 68, was a former MP of the Tamil United Liberation Front, and a member of the Tamil National Alliance, a pro-separatist party thought to be the political wing of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) rebels. Namathu Eelanadu was considered sympathetic to the Tamil nationalist cause."
