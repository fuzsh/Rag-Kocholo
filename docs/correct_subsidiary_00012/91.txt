History

Norfolk Southern is the product of the June 1, 1982 merger of Norfolk & Western and Southern Railway. The two railroads operated as separate subsidiaries under parent company Norfolk Southern Corporation until December 31, 1990, when Norfolk & Western became a subsidiary of the Southern Railway, and the Southern Railway changed its name to Norfolk Southern Railway.

Norfolk & Western, whose name dates from 1881, ran west from its namesake Virginia port to Detroit; Chicago; Des Moines, Iowa; St. Louis; and Kansas City, Missouri; places reached in N&W’s 1964 consolidation of its Norfolk — Cincinnati/Columbus system with the Nickel Plate Road and Wabash railroads.

Southern, whose first predecessor dates from 1833, blanketed the Southeast from Washington to New Orleans, and from Cincinnati, Louisville, St. Louis, and Memphis through Birmingham, Alabama, and Atlanta to Savannah, Georgia, and Jacksonville, Florida. One of the dozens of Southern’s predecessors was the original Norfolk Southern Railway, from Norfolk, to Charlotte, North Carolina, absorbed in 1974.

On August 22, 1998, Norfolk Southern, along with CSX Transportation, purchased and divided the assets of the 10,797-mile Consolidated Rail Corporation, better known as Conrail, giving NS its long sought-after gateway to the lucrative consumer markets of the northeast United States.
