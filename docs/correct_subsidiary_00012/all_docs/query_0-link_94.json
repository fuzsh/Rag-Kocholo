        "text": "Conrail (officially the Consolidated Rail Corporation) was a major railroad in the Northeast U.S. from 1976 to 1999. It was set up by the Federal Government to take over the bankrupt railroads in the Northeast, and eventually became profitable and was split between two competing systems (CSX Transportation and the Norfolk Southern Railway).\n\nPublic Law 93-236 signed January 2, 1974\n\n(a) Findings\n\nThe Congress finds and declares that—\n\nEssential rail service in the midwest and northeast region of the United States is provided by railroads which are today insolvent and attempting to undergo reorganization under the Bankruptcy Act.\n\nThis essential rail service is threatened with cessation or significant curtailment because of the inability of the trustees of such railroads to formulate acceptable plans for reorganization. This rail service is operated over rail properties which were acquired for a public use, but which have been permitted to deteriorate and now require extensive rehabilitation and modernization.\n\nThe public convenience and necessity require adequate and efficient rail service in this region and throughout the Nation to meet the needs of commerce, the national defense, the environment, and the service requirements of passengers, United States mail, shippers, States and their political subdivisions, and consumers.\n\nContinuation and improvement of essential rail service in this region is also necessary to preserve and maintain adequate national rail services and an efficient national rail transportation system.\n\nRail service and rail transportation offer economic and environmental advantages with respect to land use, air pollution, noise levels, energy efficiency and conservation, resource allocation, safety, and cost per ton-mile of movement to such extent that the preservation and maintenance of adequate and efficient rail service is in the national interest.\n\nThese needs cannot be met without substantial action by the Federal Government.\n\nThe rail system in the Northeast was dying. All the major railroads in the region, most notably Penn Central Transportation, had filed for bankruptcy, and it was likely that there would be no fix without the Federal Government playing a major role.\n\n(b) Purposes\n\nIt is therefore declared to be the purpose of Congress in this chapter to provide for—\n\nthe identification of a rail service system in the midwest and northeast region which is adequate to meet the needs and service requirements of this region and of the national rail transportation system;\n\nthe reorganization of railroads in this region into an economically viable system capable of providing adequate and efficient rail service to the region;\n\nthe establishment of the United States Railway Association, with enumerated powers and responsibilities;\n\nthe establishment of the Consolidated Rail Corporation, with enumerated powers and responsibilities;\n\nassistance to States and local and regional transportation authorities for continuation of local rail services threatened with cessation; and\n\nnecessary Federal financial assistance at the lowest possible cost to the general tax­payer\n\nThus the United States Railway Association and Conrail will be established.\n\nAs used in this chapter, unless the context otherwise requires—\n\n\"Association\" means the United States Railway Association, established under section 711 of this title;\n\n\"Commission\" means the Interstate Commerce Commission;\n\n\"Commuter authority\" means any State, local, or regional authority, corporation, or other entity established for purposes of providing commuter service, and includes the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the Connecticut Department of Transportation, the Maryland Department of Transportation, the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority, the New Jersey Transit Corporation, the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority, the Port Authority Trans-Hudson Corporation, any successor agencies, and any entity created by one or more such agencies for the purpose of operating, or contracting for the operation of, commuter service;\n\n\"Commuter service\" means short-haul rail passenger service operated in metropolitan and suburban areas, whether within or across the geographical boundaries of a State, usually characterized by reduced fare, multiple-ride, and commutation tickets, and by morning and evening peak period operations;\n\n\"Corporation\" means the Consolidated Rail Corporation required to be established under section 741 of this title or its successor by merger, consolidation or other form of succession carried out under applicable law for the purpose of changing the State of its incorporation;\n\n\"effective date of the final system plan\" means the date on which the final system plan or any revised final system plan is deemed approved by Congress, in accordance with section 718 of this title;\n\n\"employee stock ownership plan\" means a technique of corporate finance that uses a stock bonus trust or a company stock money purchase pension trust which qualifies under section 401 (a) of title 26 in connection with the financing of corporate improvements, transfers in the ownership of corporate assets, and other capital requirements of a corporation and which is designed to build beneficial equity ownership of shares in the employer corporation into its employees substantially in proportion to their relative incomes, without requiring any cash outlay, any reduction in pay or other employee benefits, or the surrender of any other rights on the part of such employees;\n\n\"final system plan\" means the plan of reorganization for the restructure, rehabilitation, and modernization of railroads in reorganization prepared pursuant to section 716 of this title and approved pursuant to section 718 of this title;\n\n\"Finance Committee\" means the Finance Committee of the Board of Directors of the Association established under section 711 (i) of this title;\n\n\"includes\" and variants thereof should be read as if the phrase \"but is not limited to\" were also set forth;\n\n\"local or regional transportation authority\" includes a political subdivision of a State.\n\n\"Office\" means the Rail Services Planning Office established under section 10361 of title 49;\n\n\"profitable railroad\" means a railroad which is not a railroad in reorganization.

Congressional findings and declarations\n\nThe Congress finds and declares that - (1) the processes set in motion by the Regional Rail Reorganization Act of 1973 [45 U.S.C. 701 et seq.] have failed to create a self-sustaining railroad system in the Northeast region of the United States and have cost United States taxpayers many billions of dollars over original estimates; (2) current arrangements for the provision of rail freight and commuter service in the Northeast and Midwest regions of the United States are inadequate to meet the transportation needs of the public and the needs of national security; (3) although the Federal Government has provided billions of dollars in assistance for Conrail and its employees, the Federal interest in ensuring the flow of interstate commerce through rail service in the private sector has not been achieved, and the protection of interstate commerce requires Federal intervention to preserve essential rail service in the private sector; (4) the provisions for protection of employees of bankrupt railroads contained in the Regional Rail Reorganization Act of 1973 [45 U.S.C. 701 et seq.] have resulted in the payment of benefits far in excess of levels anticipated at the time of enactment, have imposed an excessive fiscal burden on the Federal taxpayer, and are now an obstacle to the establishment of improved rail service and continued rail employment in the Northeast region of the United States; and (5) since holding Conrail liable for employee protection payments would destroy its prospects of becoming a profitable carrier and further injure its employees, an alternative employee protection system must be developed and funded.\n\nSec. 1102. Statement of purpose\n\nIt is therefore declared to be the purpose of the Congress in this subtitle to provide for - (1) the removal by a date certain of the Federal Government's obligation to subsidize the freight operations of Conrail; (2) transfer of Conrail commuter service responsibilities to one or more entities whose principal purpose is the provision of commuter service; and (3) an orderly return of Conrail freight service to the private sector.\n\nSec. 1103. Goals and objectives\n\nIt is the goal of this subtitle to provide Conrail the opportunity to become profitable through the achievement of the following objectives: (1) Nonagreement personnel (A) Employees who are not subject to collective bargaining agreements (hereafter in this section referred to as \"nonagreement personnel\") should forego wage increases and benefits in an amount proportionately equivalent to the amount foregone by agreement employees pursuant to paragraph (4) of this section, adjusted annually to reflect inflation. (B) After May 1, 1981, the number of nonagreement personnel should be reduced proportionately to any reduction in agreement employees (excluding reductions pursuant to the termination program under section 797a of this title). (2) Suppliers To facilitate the orderly movement of goods in interstate commerce, materials and services should continue to be available to Conrail, under normal business practices, including the provision of credit and normal financing arrangements. (3) Shippers Conrail should utilize the revenue opportunities available to it under the Staggers Rail Act of 1980 and subtitle IV of title 49. (4) Agreement employees (A) Conrail should enter into collective bargaining agreements with its employees which would reduce Conrail's costs in an amount equal to $200,000,000 a year, beginning April 1, 1981, adjusted annually to reflect inflation. (B) Agreements under this subparagraph may provide for reductions in wage increases and for changes in fringe benefits common to agreement employees, including vacations and holidays. (C) The cost reductions required under this subparagraph in the first year of the agreement may be deferred, but the aggregate cost reductions should be no less than an average of $200,000,000 per year for each of the first three one-year periods beginning April 1, 1981. (D) The amount of cost reductions provided under this paragraph shall be calculated by subtracting the cost of an agreement entered into under this paragraph from (i) the cost that would otherwise result from the application of the national agreement reached by railroad industry and its employees, or (ii) until such national agreement is reached, the cost which the United States Railway Association estimates would result from the application of such a national agreement.\n\nSec. 1104. Definitions\n\nAs used in this subtitle, unless the context otherwise requires, the term: (1) \"Amtrak\" means the National Railroad Passenger Corporation created under chapter 243 of title 49. (2) \"Commission\" means the Interstate Commerce Commission.

Conrail shall cooperate in effecting the timely preparation, execution, and proffering for recordation of such deeds and other instruments.\n\nSec. 1107. Repealed.\n\nPub. L. 99-509, title IV, Sec. 4033(c)(1)(C)(i)(I), Oct. 21, 1986, 100 Stat. 1908\n\nSec. 1108.

(b) Final decisions involving profitable railroads Notwithstanding any other provision of subtitle IV of title 49, in any proceeding before the Commission under section 11324 or 11325 of title 49 involving a profitable railroad in the Region, as defined in section 702 of this title, which received a loan under section 721(a) of this title, the Commission shall, with or without a hearing, issue a final decision within a period not to exceed 180 days after receipt of an application under either such section.

If agreement is not reached within 360 days, such matter shall be submitted to binding arbitration. (b) Eligibility of employees for employee protection benefits Conrail employees who are deprived of employment by an assumption or discontinuance of intercity passenger service by Amtrak shall be eligible for employee protection benefits under section 797 (!1) of this title, notwithstanding any other provision of law, agreement, or arrangement, and notwithstanding the inability of such employees otherwise to meet the eligibility requirements of such section.
