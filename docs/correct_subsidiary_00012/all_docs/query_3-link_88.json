        "text": "PART I\n\nNORFOLK SOUTHERN CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES (NS)\n\nItem 1. Business. and Item 2. Properties ..\n\nGENERAL - Norfolk Southern Corporation (Norfolk Southern) was incorporated on July 23, 1980, under the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia. On June l, 1982, Norfolk Southern acquired control of two major operating railroads, Norfolk and Western Railway Company (NW) and Southern Railway Company (Southern) in accordance with an Agreement of Merger and Reorganization dated as of July 31, 1980, and with the approval of the transaction by the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) (now the Surface Transportation Board [STB]).\n\nEffective Dec. 31, 1990, Norfolk Southern transferred all the common stock of NW to Southern, and Southern's name was changed to Norfolk Southern Railway Company (Norfolk Southern Railway or NSR). Effective Sept. 1, 1998, NW was merged with and into Norfolk Southern Railway. As of Dec. 31, 2003, all the common stock of Norfolk Southern Railway was owned directly by Norfolk Southern.\n\nThrough a jointly owned entity, Norfolk Southern and CSX Corporation (CSX) own the stock of Conrail Inc., which owns the major freight railroad in the Northeast. Norfolk Southern has a 58% economic and 50% voting interest in the jointly owned entity. See also the discussion concerning operation of a portion of Conrail's rail assets, below.\n\nOn March 28, 1998, Norfolk Southern closed the sale of its motor carrier company, North American Van Lines, Inc. (NAVL) (see “Discontinued Operations” and Note 17). NAVL's results are presented as “Discontinued operations” in the accompanying financial information.\n\nNorfolk Southern makes available free of charge through its website, www.nscorp.com, its annual report on Form 10‑K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and all amendments to those reports as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Additionally, Norfolk Southern’s corporate governance guidelines, board committee charters, code of ethics and code of ethical conduct for senior financial officers are available on the company’s website and in print to any shareholder who requests them.\n\nUnless indicated otherwise, Norfolk Southern and its subsidiaries are referred to collectively as NS.\n\nOPERATION OF A PORTION OF THE CONRAIL RAIL ASSETS - On June 1, 1999, Norfolk Southern and CSX, through their respective railroad subsidiaries, began operating separate portions of Conrail's rail routes and assets. Substantially all such assets are owned by two wholly owned subsidiaries of Consolidated Rail Corporation (CRC); one of those subsidiaries, Pennsylvania Lines LLC (PRR), has entered into various operating and leasing arrangements, more particularly described in Note 2, with Norfolk Southern Railway. The other subsidiary, New York Central Lines LLC (NYC) has entered into similar arrangements with CSX Transportation, Inc. (CSXT). Certain rail assets (Shared Assets Areas) still are owned by CRC, which operates them for joint and exclusive use by Norfolk Southern Railway and CSXT.\n\nOperation of the PRR routes and assets increased the size of the system over which Norfolk Southern Railway provides service by nearly 50% and afforded access to the New York metropolitan area, to much of the Northeast and to most of the major East Coast ports north of Norfolk, Virginia. Also, leasing\n\nK3\n\narrangements with PRR augmented Norfolk Southern Railway's locomotive, freight car and intermodal fleet.\n\nConrail Corporate Reorganization\n\nNS, CSX and Conrail are jointly seeking to reorganize Conrail and establish direct ownership and control by NSR and CSXT of PRR and NYC, respectively. The proposed reorganization would replace the operating agreements described above and allow NSR and CSXT to directly own and operate PRR and NYC, respectively. Consummation of the reorganization requires a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the approval of the STB and filings with the SEC. In addition, NS, CSX and Conrail must obtain the consent of Conrail’s debt holders to carry out the transaction and will obtain a valuation of PRR and of NYC.\n\nIn 2003, the IRS issued a ruling that the reorganization would qualify as a tax-free distribution. Also in 2003, the STB granted its authorization to carry out the reorganization, subject to a condition requiring NS, CSX and Conrail to either: (i) obtain the voluntary consent of the Conrail debt holders; or (ii) propose further proceedings to determine whether the terms offered to the Conrail debt holders are fair, just and reasonable. In 2004, NS, CSX and Conrail intend to file registration statements on Form S-4 with the SEC to allow a proposed exchange offer relating to Conrail’s unsecured debt (see below). In order to implement the reorganization approved by the IRS, the companies have engaged an investment banking firm to provide a valuation. The results of the valuation could impact NS’ carrying amount of its investment in Conrail and the recording of the corporate reorganization.\n\nAs a part of the proposed reorganization, Conrail would undertake a restructuring of its existing unsecured and secured public indebtedness. There are currently two series of unsecured public debentures with an outstanding principal amount of $800 million and 13 series of secured debt with an outstanding principal amount of approximately $321 million. It is currently contemplated that guaranteed debt securities of two newly formed corporate subsidiaries of NSR and CSXT would be offered in a 58%/42% ratio in exchange for Conrail’s unsecured debentures. Upon completion of the proposed transaction, the new debt securities would become direct unsecured obligations of NSR and CSXT, respectively, and would rank equally with all existing and future senior unsecured debt obligations, if any, of NSR and CSXT. These new debt securities will have maturity dates, interest rates and principal and interest payment dates identical to those of the respective series of Conrail’s unsecured debentures. In addition, these new debt securities will have covenants substantially similar to those of the publicly traded debt securities of NS and CSX, respectively.\n\nConrail’s secured debt and lease obligations will remain obligations of Conrail and are expected to be supported by new leases and subleases which, upon completion of the proposed transaction, would be the direct lease and sublease obligations of NSR or CSXT.\n\nNS, CSX and Conrail are diligently working to complete all steps necessary to consummate the Conrail corporate reorganization in 2004. Upon consummation of the proposed transaction, NS’ investment in Conrail will no longer include amounts related to PRR and NYC. Instead, the assets and liabilities of PRR will be reflected in their respective line items in NS’ Consolidated Balance Sheet, and any amounts owed to PRR would be extinguished.\n\nRAILROAD OPERATIONS - As of Dec. 31, 2003, NS' railroads operated approximately 21,500 miles of road in the states of Alabama, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia, the District of Columbia and in the Province of Ontario, Canada. The miles operated were as follows:\n\nK4\n\nIn addition to the lines leased from Conrail previously discussed, NS' railroads have major leased lines between Cincinnati, Ohio, and Chattanooga, Tennessee, and operate over trackage owned by North Carolina Railway Company (NCRR). The Cincinnati-Chattanooga lease, covering about 335 miles of road, expires in 2026, and is subject to an option to extend the lease for an additional 25 years, at terms to be agreed upon. The trackage rights over NCRR cover approximately 315 miles of road under an agreement through 2014 with the right to renew for two additional 15-year periods.\n\nNS' railroads carry raw materials, intermediate products and finished goods primarily in the Southeast, East and Midwest, and via interchange with other rail carriers, to and from the rest of the United States and parts of Canada. They also transport overseas freight through several Atlantic and Gulf Coast ports. Atlantic ports served by NS include: Norfolk, Virginia; Morehead City, North Carolina; Charleston, South Carolina; Savannah and Brunswick, Georgia; Jacksonville, Florida; Baltimore, Maryland; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania/Camden, New Jersey; Wilmington, Delaware; and the Ports of New York/New Jersey. Gulf Coast ports served include Mobile, Alabama and New Orleans, Louisiana.\n\nThe lines of NS' railroads reach most of the larger industrial and trading centers of the Southeast, Northeast, Mid-Atlantic region and Midwest. Chicago, Norfolk, Detroit, Atlanta, Metropolitan New York City, Jacksonville, Kansas City (Missouri), Baltimore, Buffalo, Charleston, Cleveland, Columbus, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Toledo, Greensboro, Charlotte and Savannah are among the leading centers originating and terminating freight traffic on the system. In addition, haulage arrangements with connecting carriers allow NS' railroads to provide single-line service to and from additional markets, including haulage provided by Florida East Coast Railway Company to serve southern and eastern Florida, including the port cities of Miami, West Palm Beach and Fort Lauderdale; and haulage provided by The Kansas City Southern Railway Company to provide transcontinental intermodal service via a connection with the Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railway Company. Service is provided to New England, including the Port of Boston, via haulage, trackage rights and interline arrangements with Canadian Pacific Railway Company and Guilford Transportation Industries. The system's lines also reach many individual industries, electric generating facilities, mines (in western Virginia, eastern Kentucky, southern and northern West Virginia and western Pennsylvania), distribution centers, transload facilities and other businesses located in smaller communities in its service area. The traffic corridors carrying the heaviest volumes of freight include those from the New York City area to Chicago (via Allentown and Pittsburgh); Chicago to Jacksonville (via Cincinnati, Chattanooga and Atlanta); Appalachian coal fields of Virginia, West Virginia and Kentucky to Norfolk, Virginia and Sandusky, Ohio; Cleveland to Kansas City; and Knoxville to Chattanooga. Chicago, Memphis, Sidney/Salem, New Orleans, Kansas City, Buffalo, St. Louis and Meridian are major gateways for interterritorial system traffic.\n\nK5\n\nTriple Crown Operations - Until April 1993, NS' intermodal subsidiary, Triple Crown Services, Inc. (TCS), offered intermodal service using RoadRailer® equipment and domestic containers. RoadRailer® units are enclosed vans that can be pulled over highways in tractor-trailer configuration and over the rails by locomotives. On April 1, 1993, the business, name and operations of TCS were transferred to Triple Crown Services Company (TCSC), a partnership in which subsidiaries of NS and Conrail are equal partners. From April 1, 1993, to June 1, 1999, the revenues of TCSC were not consolidated with the results of NS; however, effective June 1, 1999, NS gained control of TCSC and, therefore, now includes TCSC's results in its consolidated financial statements. TCSC offers door-to-door intermodal service using RoadRailer® equipment in major traffic corridors, including those between the Midwest and the Northeast, the Midwest and the Southeast and the Midwest and Texas/Mexico.\n\nThe following table sets forth certain statistics relating to NS railroads' operations for the past 5 years, including operations in the Northern Region that commenced June 1, 1999:\n\n1 Includes $107 million of costs for a voluntary separation program, which added 1.6 percentage points to the ratio.\n\n2 Includes $165 million of costs for early retirement and separation programs, which added 2.7 percentage points to the ratio.\n\nRAILWAY OPERATING REVENUES - NS' total railway operating revenues were $6.5 billion in 2003. Revenue, shipments and revenue yield by principal railway operating revenue sources for the past five years are set forth in the following table (prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current market groupings).\n\nK6\n\nK7\n\nCOAL TRAFFIC - Coal, coke and iron ore -- most of which is bituminous coal -- is NS' railroads' largest commodity group as measured by revenues. The railroads handled a total of 172 million tons in 2003, most of which originated on NS' lines in West Virginia, Virginia, Pennsylvania and Kentucky. Revenues from coal, coke and iron ore accounted for about 23% of NS' total railway operating revenues in 2003.\n\nCoal, coke and iron ore tonnage by market for the past five years are set forth in the following table.\n\nTotal coal handled through all system ports in 2003 was 35 million tons. Of this total, 11 million tons (including coastwise traffic) moved through Norfolk, Virginia, 2 million tons moved through the Baltimore Terminal, 13 million tons moved to various docks on the Ohio River, and 9 million tons moved to various Lake Erie ports. Other than coal for export, virtually all coal handled by NS' railroads was terminated in states east of the Mississippi River.\n\nSee the discussion of coal traffic, by type of coal, in Part II, Item 7, “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”\n\nGENERAL MERCHANDISE TRAFFIC - General merchandise traffic is composed of five major commodity groupings: automotive; chemicals; metals and construction; agriculture, consumer products and government; and paper, clay and forest products. The automotive group includes finished vehicles for BMW, DaimlerChrysler, Ford Motor Company, General Motors, Honda, Isuzu, Jaguar, Land Rover, Mazda, Mercedes-Benz, Mitsubishi, Nissan, Saab, Subaru, Suzuki, Toyota and Volkswagen, and auto parts for Ford Motor Company, General Motors, Mercedes-Benz and Toyota. The chemicals group includes sulfur and related chemicals, petroleum products, chlorine and bleaching compounds, plastics, rubber, industrial chemicals, chemical wastes and municipal wastes. The metals and construction group includes steel, aluminum products, machinery, scrap metals, cement, aggregates, bricks and minerals. The agriculture, consumer products and government group includes soybeans, wheat, corn, fertilizer, animal and poultry feed, food oils, flour, beverages, canned goods, sweeteners, consumer products, ethanol and items for the military. The paper, clay and forest products group includes lumber and wood products, pulpboard and paper products, woodfibers, woodpulp, scrap paper and clay. General merchandise carloads handled in 2003 were 2.78 million, compared with 2.76 million handled in 2002, an increase of 1%.\n\nIn 2003, 134 million tons of general merchandise freight, or approximately 66% of total general merchandise tonnage handled by NS, originated online. The balance of general merchandise traffic was received from connecting carriers at interterritorial gateways. The principal interchange points for NS-received traffic included Chicago, Memphis, New Orleans, Cincinnati, Kansas City, Detroit, Hagerstown, St. Louis/East St. Louis and Louisville.\n\nK8\n\nSee the discussion of general merchandise rail traffic by commodity group in Part II, Item 7, “Management's Discussion and Analysis.”\n\nINTERMODAL TRAFFIC - The intermodal market consists of shipments moving in trailers, domestic and international containers, and Roadrailer® equipment. These shipments are handled on behalf of intermodal marketing companies, international steamship lines, truckers and other shippers. Intermodal units handled in 2003 were 2.47 million, compared with 2.35 million handled in 2002, an increase of 5%.\n\nSee the discussion of intermodal traffic in Part II, Item 7, “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations.”\n\nFREIGHT RATES - In 2003, NS' railroads continued their reliance on private contracts and exempt price quotes as their predominant pricing mechanisms. Thus, a major portion of NS' railroads' freight business is not currently economically regulated by the government. In general, market forces have been substituted for government regulation and now are the primary determinant of rail service prices. However, in 2003 there were significant coal movements moving under common carrier (tariff) rates that had previously moved under rates contained in transportation contracts. Beginning Jan. 1, 2002, coal moving to Duke Energy's (Duke) Belew's Creek, Allen, Buck and Dan River generating stations moved under common carrier rates and beginning April 1, 2002, coal moving to Carolina Power and Light's (CP&L) Hyco and Mayo plants moved under common carrier rates. In 2002, Duke and CP&L filed rate reasonableness complaints at the STB alleging that NS’ tariff rates for the transportation of coal were unreasonable. In the Duke proceeding the STB initially found NS’ rates to be reasonable in November 2003, but subsequently issued technical corrections in February 2004 finding that in certain years some portion of the rates was unreasonable. The case is currently stayed because both parties have indicated that they intend to file petitions for reconsideration, and the STB has not yet ordered any rate relief. In the CP&L proceeding the STB found NS’ rates to be unreasonable in December 2003, but upheld a significant portion of NS’ tariff increase. Both of the STB’s rate decisions remain subject to petitions for rehearing and appeals. Future developments in the two cases could result in additional adjustments, and could have a significant impact on results of operations in a particular quarter.\n\nIn 2003, NS' railroads were found by the STB not to be “revenue adequate” based on results for the year 2002. A railroad is “revenue adequate” under the applicable law when its return on net investment exceeds the rail industry's composite cost of capital. This determination is made pursuant to a statutory requirement and does not adversely impact NS' liquidity or capital resources.\n\nPASSENGER OPERATIONS - Regularly scheduled passenger trains are operated by Amtrak on NS' lines between Alexandria and New Orleans, and between Greensboro and Selma, North Carolina. Commuter trains are operated on the NS line between Manassas and Alexandria in accordance with contracts with two transportation commissions of the Commonwealth of Virginia. NS also leases the Chicago to Manhattan, Illinois, line to the Commuter Rail Division of the Regional Transportation Authority of Northeast Illinois. Since June 1, 1999, Norfolk Southern Railway has operated former Conrail lines on which Amtrak conducts regularly scheduled passenger operations between Chicago, Illinois, and Detroit, Michigan, and between Chicago and Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.\n\nAlso since June 1, 1999, through its operation of PRR's routes, Norfolk Southern Railway has been providing freight service over former Conrail lines with significant ongoing Amtrak and commuter passenger operations, and is conducting freight operations over some trackage owned by Amtrak or by New Jersey Transit, the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority, Metro-North Commuter Railroad Company and Maryland DOT. Finally, passenger operations are conducted either by Amtrak or by the commuter agencies over trackage owned by Pennsylvania Lines LLC, or by Conrail in the Shared Assets Areas.\n\nK9\n\nNONCARRIER OPERATIONS - NS' noncarrier subsidiaries engage principally in the acquisition, leasing and management of coal, oil, gas and minerals; the development of commercial real estate; telecommunications; and the leasing or sale of rail property and equipment. In 2003, no such noncarrier subsidiary or industry segment grouping of noncarrier subsidiaries met the requirements for a reportable business segment set forth in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 131.\n\nRAILWAY PROPERTY\n\nThe NS railroad system extends across 22 states, the District of Columbia and portions of Canada. The railroad infrastructure makes the company very capital intensive with total property of approximately $12 billion and investment in Conrail of approximately $6 billion.\n\nCapital Expenditures - Capital expenditures for road, equipment and other property for the past five years were as follows (including capitalized leases):\n\nCapital spending and maintenance programs are and have been designed to assure the ability to provide safe, efficient and reliable transportation services. For 2004, NS has budgeted $810 million of capital spending. See the discussion following “Cash used for investing activities,” in Part II, Item 7, “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”\n\nK10\n\nEquipment - As of Dec. 31, 2003, NS owned or leased the following units of equipment:\n\nThe following table indicates the number and year built for locomotives and freight cars owned at Dec. 31, 2003.\n\n* Fifty of the locomotives built in 2001 were purchased in 2002.\n\nK11\n\nAs of Dec. 31, 2003, the average age of the locomotive fleet was 15.3 years. During 2003, 91 locomotives, the average age of which was 28.7 years, were retired. The average age of the freight car fleet at Dec. 31, 2003, was 26.6 years. During 2003, 4,855 freight cars were retired.\n\nSince 1988, about 29,000 coal cars have been rebodied. As a result, the remaining serviceability of the freight car fleet is greater than may be inferred from the high percentage of freight cars built in earlier years.\n\nOngoing freight car and locomotive maintenance programs are intended to ensure the highest standards of safety, reliability, customer satisfaction and equipment marketability. In past years, the freight car bad order ratio reflected the storage of certain types of cars that were not in high demand. The ratio rose in 2000, 2001 and 2002 as a result of decreased maintenance activity. The decline in 2003 reflected an increase in maintenance activity as well as the retirement of unserviceable units. The locomotive bad order ratio includes units out of service for required inspections every 92 days and program work such as overhauls. The ratio rose slightly in 2000 as maintenance activities were curtailed in response to a slowing economy. The elevated ratio through 2003 reflected units out of service related to the resumption of maintenance and modification activities.\n\nTrack Maintenance - Of the approximately 38,500 total miles of track operated, NS had responsibility for maintaining about 31,000 miles of track with the remainder being operated under trackage rights. Over 75% of the main line trackage (including first, second, third and branch main tracks, all excluding trackage rights) has rail ranging from 131 to 155 pounds per yard with the standard installation currently at 141 pounds per yard. Approximately 40% of NS lines carried 20 million or more gross tons per track mile.\n\nThe following table summarizes several measurements regarding NS' track roadway additions and replacements during the past five years:\n\nMicrowave System - The NS microwave system, consisting of approximately 7,400 radio route miles, 424 core stations, 14 secondary stations and 5 passive repeater stations, provides communications between most operating locations. The microwave system is used primarily for voice communications, VHF radio control circuits, data and facsimile transmissions, traffic control operations and AEI data transmissions.\n\nTraffic Control - Of a total of 21,500 route miles operated by NS, excluding trackage rights over foreign lines, 10,978 miles are signalized, including 8,091 miles of centralized traffic control (CTC) and 2,887\n\nK12\n\nmiles of automatic block signals. Of the 8,091 miles of CTC, 2,487 miles are controlled by data radio originating at 183 base station radio sites.\n\nComputers - A computer network consisting of a centralized data center in Atlanta, Georgia, and various distributed computers throughout the company connects the yards, terminals, transportation offices, rolling stock repair points, sales offices and other key system locations. Operating and traffic data are processed and stored to provide customers with information on their shipments throughout the system. Computer systems provide current information on the location of every train and each car on line, as well as related waybill and other train and car movement data. In addition, the computer systems are utilized to assist management in the performance of a variety of functions and services including payroll, car and revenue accounting, billing, material management activities and controls, and special studies.\n\nOther - The railroads have extensive facilities for support of operations, including freight depots, car construction shops, maintenance shops, office buildings, and signals and communications facilities.\n\nEncumbrances - Certain railroad equipment is subject to the prior lien of equipment financing obligations amounting to approximately $910 million as of Dec. 31, 2003, and $864 million at Dec. 31, 2002.\n\nEnvironmental Matters - Compliance with federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment is a principal NS goal. To date, such compliance has not affected materially NS' capital additions, earnings, liquidity or competitive position. See the discussion of “Environmental Matters” in Part II, Item 7, “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” and in Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nEMPLOYEES - NS employed an average of 28,753 employees in 2003, compared with an average of 28,970 in 2002. The approximate average cost per employee during 2003 was $58,000 in wages and $28,000 in employee benefits.\n\nApproximately 85% of NS' railroad employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with 14 different labor unions. See the discussion of “Labor Agreements” in Part II, Item 7, “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”\n\nGOVERNMENT REGULATION - In addition to environmental, safety, securities and other regulations generally applicable to all businesses, NS' railroads are subject to regulation by the STB. The STB has jurisdiction over some rates, routes, conditions of service and the extension or abandonment of rail lines. The STB also has jurisdiction over the consolidation, merger or acquisition of control of and by rail common carriers. The Department of Transportation regulates certain track and mechanical equipment standards.\n\nThe relaxation of economic regulation of railroads, begun over two decades ago under the Staggers Rail Act of 1980, has continued. Significant exemptions are TOFC/COFC (i.e., “piggyback”) business, rail boxcar traffic, lumber, manufactured steel, automobiles and certain bulk commodities such as sand, gravel, pulpwood and wood chips for paper manufacturing. Transportation contracts on regulated shipments effectively remove those shipments from regulation as well. About 80% of NS' freight revenues come from either exempt traffic or traffic moving under transportation contracts.\n\nEfforts may be made in 2004 to re-subject the rail industry to unwarranted federal economic regulation. The Staggers Rail Act of 1980, which substantially reduced such regulation, encouraged and enabled rail carriers to innovate and to compete for business, thereby contributing to the economic health of the nation\n\nK13\n\nand to the revitalization of the industry. Accordingly, NS will oppose efforts to reimpose unwarranted economic regulation.\n\nCOMPETITION - There is continuing strong competition among rail, water and highway carriers. Price is usually only one factor of importance as shippers and receivers choose a transport mode and specific hauling company. Inventory carrying costs, service reliability, ease of handling and the desire to avoid loss and damage during transit are also important considerations, especially for higher-valued finished goods, machinery and consumer products. Even for raw materials, semifinished goods and work-in-process, users are increasingly sensitive to transport arrangements that minimize problems at successive production stages.\n\nNS' primary rail competitor is the CSX system; both operate throughout much of the same territory. Other railroads also operate in parts of the territory. NS also competes with motor carriers, water carriers and with shippers who have the additional option of handling their own goods in private carriage.\n\nCertain marketing strategies among railroads and between railroads and motor carriers enable carriers to compete more effectively in specific markets.\n\nItem 3. Legal Proceedings ..\n\nNone.\n\nItem 4. Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders ..\n\nThere were no matters submitted to a vote of security holders during the fourth quarter of 2003.\n\nExecutive Officers of the Registrant.\n\nNorfolk Southern's executive officers generally are elected and designated annually by the Board of Directors at its first meeting held after the annual meeting of stockholders, and they hold office until their successors are elected. Executive officers also may be elected and designated throughout the year as the Board of Directors considers appropriate. There are no family relationships among the officers, nor any arrangement or understanding between any officer and any other person pursuant to which the officer was selected. The following table sets forth certain information, as of February 1, 2004, relating to the executive officers.\n\nK14\n\nK15\n\nPART II\n\nItem 5. Market for Registrant's Common Stock and Related Stockholder Matters ..\n\nNORFOLK SOUTHERN CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nSTOCK PRICE AND DIVIDEND INFORMATION\n\nThe Common Stock of Norfolk Southern Corporation, owned by 52,091 stockholders of record as of Dec. 31, 2003, is traded on the New York Stock Exchange with the symbol NSC. The following table shows the high and low sales prices as reported by Bloomberg L.P. on its internet-based service and dividends per share, by quarter, for 2003 and 2002.\n\nK16\n\nItem 6. Selected Financial Data ..\n\nNORFOLK SOUTHERN CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nFIVE-YEAR FINANCIAL REVIEW 1999-2003\n\nK17\n\nK18\n\nItem 7 .. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\n\nNORFOLK SOUTHERN CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of\n\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations\n\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes and the Five-Year Financial Review.\n\nSUMMARIZED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\n2003 Compared with 2002\n\nNet income was $535 million, or $1.37 per diluted share, in 2003, up $75 million, or 16%. Results in 2003 included a $10 million, or 3 cents per share, gain from discontinued operations (see Note 17) and a $114 million, or 29 cents per share, benefit related to the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles (see Note 1). Income from continuing operations before accounting changes, which excludes these items, was $411 million, or $1.05 per diluted share, down $49 million, or 11%, compared with 2002, reflecting higher compensation and benefits costs, which included the costs of a voluntary separation program (see Note 11), and lower nonoperating income that reflected the impairment of certain telecommunications assets (see Note 6). The costs of the voluntary separation program and the asset impairment combined to reduce income by $119 million, or 30 cents per share.\n\n2002 Compared with 2001\n\nNet income was $460 million, or $1.18 per diluted share, in 2002, up $85 million, or 23%. Net income in 2001 was $375 million and included a $13 million, or 3 cents per share, gain from discontinued operations (see Note 17); accordingly, income from continuing operations was $362 million, or 94 cents per diluted share. Results in 2002 were $98 million, or 27%, above 2001’s income from continuing operations. The improvement was primarily the result of a $151 million, or 15%, increase in income from railway operations.\n\nDETAILED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\nRailway Operating Revenues\n\nRailway operating revenues were $6.5 billion in 2003, $6.3 billion in 2002 and $6.2 billion in 2001. The following table presents a three-year comparison of revenues by market group (prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current market groupings).\n\nK19\n\nIn 2003, revenues increased 3%, reflecting a 2% rise in general merchandise revenues, a 4% improvement in coal revenues, and a 5% increase in intermodal revenues. All but automotive within the general merchandise market group posted increases over 2002. As shown in the following table, most of the revenue improvement was the result of higher traffic volumes. The favorable revenue per unit/mix variance was driven by higher average revenue per unit, offset in part by the effects of unfavorable changes in the mix of traffic, particularly a 5% increase in lower-priced intermodal traffic volume.\n\nIn 2002, revenues increased 2%, as a 3% rise in general merchandise revenues coupled with a 5% improvement in intermodal revenues offset a 5% decline in coal revenues. All but one of the general merchandise market groups (paper, clay and forest products) posted increases over 2001.\n\nBeginning March 1, 2004, NS will modify its fuel surcharge program for its merchandise and coal traffic. The fuel surcharge program in effect until that time applies a 2% fuel surcharge to line haul freight charges when the WTI crude oil price, as published in the Wall Street Journal, exceeds $28.00 per barrel for 30 consecutive business days. For each $5.00 per barrel increase, an additional 2% fuel surcharge applies. The revised fuel surcharge will be based on the monthly average price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil. Line haul freight charges will be adjusted by 0.4% for every dollar the average price exceeds $23 per barrel in the second calendar month prior to the month in which the fuel surcharge is applied. The modification in the fuel surcharge program will cause the amount charged to more closely reflect fuel price fluctuations in today’s volatile market.\n\nCOAL tonnage increased 1% in 2003 and revenues increased 4% versus 2002. Revenue per unit increased 4%, reflecting favorable developments in the coal rate reasonableness proceedings before the STB, as discussed below, as well as increases resulting from more longer haul business and loading\n\nK20\n\nproductivity improvements that led to more tons per car. Coal, coke and iron ore revenues represented 23% of total railway operating revenues in 2003, and 86% of NS' coal shipments originated on lines it operates.\n\nIn 2002, two of NS’ utility customers, Duke Energy (Duke) and Carolina Power & Light (CP&L), filed rate reasonableness complaints at the STB alleging that NS’ tariff rates for the transportation of coal were unreasonable. In the Duke proceeding the STB initially found NS’ rates to be reasonable in November 2003, but subsequently issued technical corrections in February 2004 finding that in certain years some portion of the rates was unreasonable. The case is currently stayed because both parties have indicated that they intend to file petitions for reconsideration, and the STB has not yet ordered any rate relief. In the CP&L proceeding the STB found NS’ rates to be unreasonable in December 2003, but upheld a significant portion of NS’ tariff increase. Both of the STB’s rate decisions remain subject to petitions for rehearing and appeals. Future developments in the two cases could result in additional adjustments and could have a significant impact on results of operations in a particular quarter. Over the long term, Management believes the STB decisions in the Duke and CP&L proceedings will help support improved pricing for coal transportation services.\n\nIn 2002, coal tonnage decreased 4% and revenues declined 5%. Revenue per unit declined slightly, reflecting unfavorable changes in the mix of traffic (more shorter-haul business) that offset the effects of rate increases and gains in tonnage per car.\n\nUtility coal tonnage increased 2%, compared to 2002, primarily due to a 6% gain in tonnage moving to the Northeast. These gains were led by a full year’s operation of two projects completed in 2002 that captured traffic from truck and barge.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2003, higher natural gas prices and colder temperatures caused coal-fired generating stations to run at near capacity in the Northeast, reducing the high stockpiles that were carried forward from 2002. However, the mild temperatures through the remainder of the year diminished seasonal demand for coal. Volumes to utilities in the South decreased 4% due to milder weather and extended power plant outages for the installation of environmental emission-control technology.\n\nIn 2002, utility coal tonnage decreased 3%, a result of lower demand that reflected the weak economy, high coal stockpile levels entering the year, mild temperatures in the first quarter, reduced stockpile targets set by utility companies and increased generation from new natural gas-fired plants. Licensing requirements for these new plants resulted in additional generation that temporarily displaced coal-fired generation.\n\nThe outlook for utility coal remains positive. Coal-fired generation continues to be the lowest-cost source for electric generation that has additional growth capacity above current levels. Management expects\n\nK21\n\nutilities to use coal-fired plants to meet increased electricity demand because of coal’s low generating cost and the strengthening economy. As always, demand will be influenced by the weather.\n\nThere remain a number of evolving environmental issues that have the potential to increase or ease cost pressures on the utility coal market, depending upon their outcome. These include a new national energy policy, proposed multi-emissions legislation, mercury emissions standard, new source review and the fate of the United States participation in the Kyoto Protocol. Although developments with these environmental issues could potentially increase cost pressures on coal-fired generation, the outlook remains positive for maintaining coal’s position in the power generation mix for regions served by NS. Favorable developments with these issues could actually ease cost pressures on coal-fired generation, further strengthening coal’s position.\n\nExport coal tonnage increased 9% in 2003, compared to 2002. Export coal through Norfolk, primarily metallurgical coal, increased by 24% in 2003, benefiting from a decline in exports from China. Strong steel production in China increased demand for metallurgical coal and coke and shifted Chinese exports of these commodities to domestic consumption. Also, ocean freight rates are at an all time high. Spot vessel rates from Australia to Europe have more than tripled, while transatlantic rates have increased less dramatically. The combination of the resulting gap in ocean freight rates and the shorter sailing times has given the United States a competitive advantage in European markets. Last, the decline in the value of the dollar against the Euro and Australian Dollar also increased demand for United States metallurgical coal abroad. Coal exported through Baltimore, primarily steam coal, declined 41% due to strong domestic demand for utility coal, as discussed above.\n\nIn 2002, export coal tonnage declined 18% compared to 2001. Steam coal exports through Baltimore declined 4%, and export metallurgical coals through Norfolk declined 22%. During the first half of 2002, demand for U.S. coal was soft as international buyers focused their purchases toward other, lower-priced sources. Market uncertainty resulted in late contract settlements and delayed shipments. Late in 2002, demand for U.S. coking coals increased, reflecting a shift in the market as exports from China, Australia and Poland declined. As a result, shipments through Norfolk increased in the fourth quarter of 2002.\n\nStrong domestic steam coal prices and reduced metallurgical coal production have limited export growth in the United States. The stage is set for further recovery in export volumes in 2004. Export growth will depend, however, upon the availability of coal supply from key metallurgical mines on NS. Pricing is also expected to strengthen.\n\nDomestic metallurgical coal, coke and iron ore volumes decreased 5% in 2003, when compared to 2002, due to the temporary closing of a large mine that produced low-volatile coal, the continuing consolidation of the steel industry, and fewer blast furnaces operating than in the past.\n\nIn 2002, domestic metallurgical coal, coke and iron ore tonnage increased 5%, reflecting higher U.S. steel production, aided by the imported steel tariff program implemented in 2002. In addition, continued strong vehicle production resulted in demand for steel.\n\nFuture demand for domestic metallurgical coal, coke and iron ore is uncertain but may increase in 2004 due to the shortage that exists in the world market. Continuation of the anticipated rationalization of the steel industry is expected, resulting in fewer blast furnaces in operation; however, the furnaces that remain are expected to run near capacity. Growth may be limited by the availability of coal supply from a key metallurgical mine on NS that was idled in 2003 but is expected to reopen sometime in the second half of 2004. In addition, the end of the steel tariff in December 2003 could mean lower steel prices worldwide and may lead to further consolidations in the industry.\n\nK22\n\nOther coal volumes, principally steam coal shipped to manufacturing plants, finished the year down 1%, when compared to 2002. In 2002, other coal traffic decreased 14%, a result of the weak economy.\n\nGENERAL MERCHANDISE traffic volume (carloads) increased 1% in 2003, and revenues increased 2%, principally due to higher average revenues in most business groups and higher agriculture traffic volume. In 2002, traffic volume increased 2%, and revenues increased 3%, reflecting a 9% improvement in automotive revenues.\n\nAutomotive traffic volume and revenues decreased 3% in 2003, principally due to reduced vehicle production.\n\nIn 2002, automotive traffic volume increased 7%, and revenues increased 9%, principally due to a rise in vehicle production and new business. Revenue per unit increased 2%, reflecting some pricing improvements, extended length of haul, special ancillary services and the settlement of a disputed charge.\n\nAutomotive revenues in 2004 are expected to be somewhat higher than those of 2003, due to several factors: light vehicle production is predicted to be slightly above the 2003 level, NS has increased rail service to a major customer with a second plant opening towards the end of 2004, and the addition of several new products.\n\nChemicals traffic volume increased 1% and revenue increased 2% compared to 2002. Traffic volume benefited from higher shipments of industrial intermediates, petroleum and environmental products, and plastics. Also contributing to 2003 growth, approximately 2,000 annual carloads of new traffic were diverted from the waterways and highways. Revenue per unit reflected improved pricing to meet market conditions, as well as favorable changes in mix.\n\nIn 2002, chemicals traffic volume increased slightly and revenues increased 2%. Higher traffic volume for plastics and a small increase for miscellaneous chemicals offset a decline for petroleum products. Demand for plastics was supported by increases in light vehicle production and housing starts. Traffic volume also benefited from increased shipments through NS' Thoroughbred Bulk Transfer (TBT) facilities that handle chemicals and bulk commodities for customers not located on NS-served lines. Revenue per unit increased as a result of a favorable change in the mix of traffic (more higher-rated business) and market-driven rate increases.\n\nChemical volume is expected to improve in 2004, primarily due to expectations for a stronger economy and growth from new or expanded plastics plants. However, volume could be adversely affected by the price of energy in North America, particularly that of natural gas and crude oil. Both of these commodities account for more than 50% of the cost of most chemical products, and high North American prices are causing chemical producers increasingly to look off shore for production.\n\nMetals and construction traffic volume decreased 1%, but revenues increased 1% in 2003 compared with 2002. The decline in volume resulted from reduced metals volume (mostly iron and steel), offset in part by higher construction traffic. Revenue per unit improved 2%, reflecting favorable pricing and traffic mix changes.\n\nIn 2002, metals and construction traffic volume increased 2%, and revenues improved 3%, reflecting improvement in the steel industry, aided by the two-year imported steel tariff program. Metals volume benefited from resumption of production at some mills that closed in 2001 and increased volume from new mills. Construction traffic declined, primarily as a result of reductions in highway projects due to state government budget pressures.\n\nK23\n\nMetals and construction revenues in 2004 are expected to benefit from an improved economic environment and converting motor carrier traffic to rail, although further consolidation in the steel industry is expected. New stone terminals on NS lines in Florida, Georgia and Tennessee will generate additional aggregate business, and new access to existing cement facilities will increase traffic.\n\nAgriculture, consumer products and government traffic volume increased 7% and revenues increased 8% compared with 2002. Commodities contributing most to these increases were corn, fertilizer, military, sweeteners and wheat. Only feed, food products and beverages showed a slight decrease. Corn shipments increased 4% in 2003 and revenue was up 8%. Due to the drought of 2002, which caused a depletion of inventories, there was a significant increase in demand for corn to Southeast feed mill customers and poultry producers in eastern Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Delaware, resulting in long haul rail movements from Midwest suppliers to these areas. Higher fertilizer traffic resulted from the re-opening of a large phosphate fertilizer plant. Shipments of military vehicles and military equipment increased 36% over 2002 levels due to the war in Iraq.\n\nIn 2002, agriculture, consumer products and government traffic volume decreased slightly compared to 2001, but revenues increased 3%. Traffic volume increases for corn, food products and beverages largely offset declines for soybeans and feed. Corn volume benefited from increased shipments from the Midwest to drought-stricken areas in the East. The increase for food products was primarily the result of new business. Soybean and feed volumes were adversely affected by lower domestic and export demand. Revenue per unit increased because of higher rates, increased length of haul and favorable changes in the mix of traffic.\n\nAgriculture, consumer products and government revenues in 2004 are expected to remain steady, reflecting a more normalized 2003 crop, and the overall strong performance of the other commodities. Traffic levels should benefit from new southeastern feed mills that are expected to come on line by late 2004, as well as more shipments of corn, ethanol and transcontinental shipments of fresh and frozen foods.\n\nPaper, clay and forest products traffic increased 1% and revenues increased 5% compared to 2002, principally due to improved domestic demand for paper products. Paper traffic benefited from increased domestic orders for consumer products packaging and from the advertising sector, as well as new business. Newsprint shipments continued to remain soft, largely due to a prolonged decline in demand. Woodchip volume increased significantly as NS-served paper mills experienced shortages and were forced to source wood fiber from more distant suppliers due to wet weather in the Southeast. NS clay revenue was up compared to 2002 due to a strong increase in revenue per carload and a more positive mix as NS handled more long-haul domestic traffic. Lumber business was soft in early 2003 despite strong demand due in part to wet weather and several mill closures. Lumber business was up in the fourth quarter as weather in the Southeast and commodity prices improved.\n\nIn 2002, paper, clay and forest products traffic volume declined 3%, and revenues decreased 1%, primarily due to continued weakness in the paper market, especially in the first half of the year. Traffic volume improved later in the year as the paper market strengthened. In addition, NS gained business from conversion of truck shipments to rail and from continued strength in housing starts. Revenue per unit benefited from rate increases and a decline in shorter-haul business.\n\nIn 2004, paper, clay and forest product revenues are expected to experience modest growth consistent with the general outlook for the domestic economy. NS revenue growth initiatives will focus on converting motor carrier traffic to rail and offering more transload or rail/truck bundled services to non-rail served customers.\n\nK24\n\nINTERMODAL volume increased 5% and revenues increased 5% compared to 2002. Volume growth was driven by improved service performance that enabled the conversion of truck business to rail. Shipments for asset-based truckload carriers increased 14% as these trucking companies used intermodal to reduce their exposure to driver shortages and the need for larger fleets. International volume, which represents 45% of intermodal’s volume, grew 9%, primarily a result of strong import trade and new business driven by enhanced service. Triple Crown Services Company (TCS) grew 1% in 2003, hampered by a fleet at full capacity. NS is expanding this fleet in 2004.\n\nIn 2002, intermodal traffic volume increased 6%, and revenues increased 5%, compared to 2001. Volume growth was principally the result of new and improved services that resulted in new business, including the conversion of truck business to rail. International traffic, which accounts for about half of intermodal volume, increased 10%, supported by growth in trade activity and new business. Domestic shipments grew 6%, primarily because of new business gained from the conversion of truck shipments. TCS volume increased 4%. Revenue per unit declined as a result of an increase in shorter-haul business and the absence of fuel surcharges that were in place in 2001, which were partially offset by some rate increases.\n\nIn 2004, intermodal revenues are expected to benefit from unfavorable forces affecting trucking companies, including changes to the highway hours of service laws, driver shortages, new truck emission standards and, accordingly, higher truck prices. These forces are expected to accelerate truck to rail conversion in addition to creating an environment conducive to rail price increases.\n\nRailway Operating Expenses\n\nRailway operating expenses increased 6% in 2003, while carloads increased 2%. Expenses in 2003 included $107 million of costs related to a voluntary separation program to reduce the size of the work force, which resulted in 2% of the 6% expense increase. In 2002, railway operating expenses declined 1%, while carloads increased 1%.\n\nThe railway operating ratio, which measures the percentage of railway operating revenues consumed by railway operating expenses, was 83.5% in 2003, compared with 81.5% in 2002 and 83.7% in 2001. The voluntary separation costs added 1.6 percentage points to the 2003 ratio.\n\nThe following table shows the changes in railway operating expenses summarized by major classifications.\n\n* Includes $107 million of voluntary separation costs in 2003.\n\nK25\n\nCompensation and benefits represented 42% of total railway operating expenses and increased 13% in 2003. Almost half of the increase was the result of the $107 million voluntary separation program. The remaining increase was principally due to higher wage rates (including the BLE bonus in lieu of wage increases), which added $45 million, increased health and welfare benefits costs, which were up $44 million, and reduced pension income down $34 million (see Note 11). Approximately $25 million of the increase in health and welfare benefit costs was attributable to retirees, reflecting a higher estimated medical inflation rate. NS expects these costs to be down slightly in 2004, a result of a recent plan amendment and changes in Medicare coverage (see Note 11). However, NS anticipates that this reduction will largely be offset by lower pension income. Therefore, total pension and postretirement expenses in 2004 are expected to be comparable to 2003.\n\nIn 2002, compensation and benefits increased slightly and represented 40% of total railway operating expenses. Higher wage rates, reduced pension income (see Note 11) and increased health and welfare benefits costs more than offset savings from reduced employment levels and lower payroll taxes (see the discussion of the Railroad Retirement and Survivors' Improvement Act, below).\n\nThe Railroad Retirement and Survivors' Improvement Act, which took effect on Jan. 1, 2002, provides for a phased reduction of the employers' portions of Tier II Railroad Retirement payroll taxes. The phase-in calls for a reduction from 14.2% in 2003 to 13.1% in 2004 and thereafter. In addition, the supplemental annuity tax was eliminated. These changes resulted in an estimated $21 million reduction in payroll taxes in 2003 and are expected to result in savings of $16 million in 2004, compared with 2003. However, these savings are expected to continue to be offset by an increase in the railroad unemployment tax rate, higher payroll taxes on increased wages and a higher wage base. The new law allows for investment of Tier II assets in a diversified portfolio through the newly established National Railroad Retirement Investment Trust. The law also provides a mechanism for automatic adjustment of future Tier II payroll taxes should the trust assets fall below a four-year reserve or exceed a six-year reserve.\n\nMaterials, services and rents includes items used for the maintenance of the railroad's lines, structures and equipment; the costs of services purchased from outside contractors, including the net costs of operating joint (or leased) facilities with other railroads; and the net cost of equipment rentals. This category of expenses decreased 2% in 2003 and increased 1% in 2002.\n\nThe 2003 decline reflected lower equipment rents costs, down $26 million, and reduced purchased services, down $20 million, including lower expenses for intermodal, automotive and bulk transfer services, and professional and legal fees.\n\nThe increase in 2002 was the result of higher volume-related expenses for automotive and intermodal traffic, increased material costs for locomotives, higher expenses for roadway and bridge repairs and increased derailment costs. These higher costs were largely offset by a significant reduction in equipment rents.\n\nEquipment rents, which includes the cost to NS of using equipment (mostly freight cars) owned by other railroads or private owners, less the rent paid to NS for the use of its equipment, decreased 7% in 2003 and 14% in 2002. The decline in 2003 was principally the result of lower automotive traffic volume in addition to adjustments relating to periodic studies of equipment rents and favorable settlements of recent bills. In addition, the change in accounting related to certain leased locomotives (see Notes 1 and 6) also reduced equipment rents. The decline in 2002 was principally the result of continued improvement in cycle times, reflecting efficiency gains and, for intermodal equipment, service design and process changes implemented during the year.\n\nK26\n\nLocomotive repair costs increased in 2003 and 2002, due to more maintenance activity. Locomotive and freight car maintenance costs are expected to increase further in 2004.\n\nConrail rents and services increased 2% in 2003 and decreased 2% in 2002. This item includes amounts due to PRR and CRC for use of their operating properties and equipment and CRC's operation of the Shared Assets Areas. Also included is NS' equity in Conrail's net earnings, plus the additional amortization related to the difference between NS' investment in Conrail and its underlying equity (see Note 2). The increase in 2003 reflects lower Conrail earnings and higher expenses in the Shared Assets Areas, whereas the decline in 2002 reflected higher Conrail earnings and lower expenses in the Shared Assets Areas (see “Conrail's Results of Operations, Financial Condition and Liquidity,” below).\n\nDepreciation expense was down slightly in 2003 and up slightly in 2002. Substantial levels of capital spending affected both years; however, expense in 2003 benefited from a change in accounting for the cost to remove crossties (see Note 1), and expenses in 2002 benefited from lower rates implemented early in the year following completion of a periodic study (see Note 1, “Properties,” for NS' depreciation policy).\n\nDiesel fuel expenses increased 11% in 2003 and decreased 17% in 2002. The increase in 2003 reflects an 11% rise in the average price per gallon and essentially flat consumption. The decline in 2002 reflected a 16% drop in the average price per gallon and slightly lower consumption. Expenses in 2003 and 2002 included benefits of $59 million and $10 million, respectively, from the diesel fuel hedging program (see “Market Risks and Hedging Activities,” below and Note 16). NS has hedged approximately 63% of expected 2004 diesel fuel requirements as of December 31, 2003, at an average price of 78 cents per gallon. Accordingly, if diesel fuel prices are volatile during 2004 it is unlikely that NS will experience the same degree of volatility in its diesel fuel expense.\n\nCasualties and other claims expenses (including the estimates of costs related to personal injury, property damage and environmental matters) increased 6% in 2003 and 20% in 2002. The higher expense in 2003 was due to adverse personal injury claims development and derailments earlier in the year as well as higher insurance costs. The increase in 2002 reflected adverse personal injury claims development and higher expenses for loss and damage to lading, as well as higher insurance and environmental remediation costs.\n\nThe largest component of casualties and other claims expense is personal injury costs. In 2003, cases involving occupational injuries comprised about 40% of the total employee injury cases settled and 31% of the total settlement payments made. Injuries of this type are often not caused by a specific accident or event, but rather, result from a claimed exposure over time. Many such claims are being asserted by former or retired employees, some of whom have not been actively employed in the rail industry for decades. NS continues to work actively to eliminate all employee injuries and to reduce the associated costs.\n\nThe rail industry remains uniquely susceptible to litigation involving job-related accidental injury and occupational claims because of the Federal Employers' Liability Act (FELA), which is applicable only to railroads. FELA, which covers employee claims for job-related injuries, produces results that are unpredictable and inconsistent as compared with a no-fault workers' compensation system.\n\nNS, like many other businesses in the U.S., has experienced difficulty obtaining property and casualty insurance on reasonable terms after the September 11 terrorist attacks. NS has been successful in maintaining a substantial amount of commercial insurance for third-party personal injury, property damage and FELA claims, although both the cost of this insurance and the amount of risk that NS retains\n\nK27\n\nthrough self-insurance have more than doubled since the attacks. The magnitude of the premium increases that NS experienced in 2002 began to subside in 2003, however.\n\nOther expenses increased 8% in 2003 but decreased 10% in 2002. The increase in 2003 was primarily attributable to higher state franchise and sales and use taxes, the absence of a favorable bad debt settlement that benefited 2002 and higher union employee travel expenses. The decline in 2002 reflected lower expenses for property and sales and use taxes.\n\nOther Income – Net\n\nOther income – net was $19 million in 2003, $66 million in 2002 and $99 million in 2001 (see Note 3). The decline in 2003 was primarily due to the $84 million telecommunications assets impairment charge that offset increased gains from the sale of properties, higher corporate-owned life insurance returns and lower interest accruals related to tax liabilities. The decline in 2002 was primarily the result of higher interest accruals on federal income tax liabilities, lower gains from the sale of properties and investments, and the absence of a $13 million gain from a nonrecurring settlement that benefited 2001. These reductions were partially offset by reduced discount from the sales of receivables (due to a lower amount of receivables sold and a lower interest rate environment, which favorably affects the amount of discount).\n\nIncome Taxes\n\nIncome tax expense in 2003 was $175 million for an effective rate of 30%, compared with effective rates of 35% in 2002 and 2001. Excluding NS’ equity in Conrail's after-tax earnings, the effective rate was 33% in 2003, and 38% in 2002 and 2001.\n\nIn 2003, the effective rate was reduced by the favorable resolution of prior years’ tax audits. The effective rates in all three years benefited from favorable adjustments upon filing the prior year tax returns and favorable adjustments to state tax liabilities (see Note 4).\n\nIn May 2003, the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003 was signed into law. The law increased from 30% to 50% the additional first-year depreciation allowance for property acquired after May 5, 2003, and before January 1, 2005. The 30% additional first-year depreciation allowance was an element of earlier tax legislation. The acceleration of tax depreciation deductions allowed by these laws reduces current taxes and increases deferred tax levels by significant amounts.\n\nDiscontinued Operations\n\nIncome from discontinued operations in 2003 consisted of a $10 million after-tax gain related to the resolution of tax issues arising from the sale of NS' motor carrier subsidiary. Income from discontinued operations in 2001 consisted of a $13 million after-tax gain resulting from the expiration of certain indemnities contained in the sales agreement (see Note 17).\n\nFINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\n\nCash provided by operating activities, NS' principal source of liquidity, was $1,054 million in 2003, compared with $803 million in 2002 and $654 million in 2001. The increase in 2003 reflected a smaller change in the amount of accounts receivables sold; declines in receivables sold amounted to $30 million in 2003 and $270 million in 2002 (see Note 5). In 2002, the improvement was the result of higher income\n\nK28\n\nfrom railway operations and favorable changes in working capital, which were offset, in part, by fewer accounts receivable sold (see Note 5).\n\nPayments made to PRR (which are included in “Conrail Rents and Services” and, therefore, are a use of cash in “Cash provided by operating activities”) are largely cash neutral because a significant portion are borrowed back from a PRR subsidiary and, therefore, are a source of cash in “Proceeds from borrowings.” NS' net cash flow from these borrowings amounted to $203 million in 2003, $212 million in 2002 and $250 million in 2001.\n\nNS' working capital deficit was $376 million at Dec. 31, 2003, compared with $554 million at Dec. 31, 2002. The improvement resulted principally from an increase in cash flow from operations and a reduction in federal income taxes due within one year. Debt due in 2004 is expected to be paid using cash generated from operations (including sales of accounts receivable) and cash on hand.\n\nNS currently has the capability to increase the amount of accounts receivable being sold under the revolving sale program to meet its more immediate working capital needs. During 2003, the amount of receivables NS could sell under this program ranged from $358 million to $433 million, and the amount of receivables NS sold ranged from zero to $150 million. Moreover, NS has a $1 billion credit facility, which expires in 2006, that it can borrow under or use to support commercial paper debt; however, reductions in its credit rating could limit NS' ability to access the commercial paper markets (see also the discussion of financing activities, below).\n\nNS expects to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to meet its ongoing obligations. This expectation is based on a view that the economy will continue a moderate growth rate through 2004.\n\nContractual obligations at Dec. 31, 2003, related to NS' long-term debt (including capital leases) (see Note 8), operating leases (see Note 9), agreements with CRC (see Note 2), unconditional purchase obligations (see Note 18) and other long-term obligations (see Note 18), are as follows:\n\nNS also has a contractual obligation related to a lease covering 140 locomotives. The lessor is a special-purpose entity formed to enter into this transaction, but it is not related to NS and its owner has a substantive residual equity capital investment at risk in the entity. The lessor owns the locomotives and issued debt to finance their purchase; however, NS has no obligation related to the debt. NS has the option to purchase the locomotives, but also can return them to the lessor. If NS does not purchase the locomotives at the end of the maximum lease term, it is liable for any shortfall in the then fair value of the locomotives and a specified residual value. NS does not expect to be required to make any payments under this provision (see Note 9). As the primary beneficiary of the business of the lessor, effective\n\nK29\n\nJan. 1, 2003, NS consolidated the assets (locomotives) and liabilities (debt) of this special-purpose entity when it implemented Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 46 (see Note 1, “New Accounting Pronouncements”).\n\nIn addition, NS has contractual obligations to PRR as disclosed in Note 2. However, NS has the ability to borrow back funds from PRR to the extent they are not needed to fund contractual obligations at Conrail. As an indirect owner of Conrail, NS may need to make capital contributions, loans or advances to Conrail to fund its contractual obligations. The following table presents 58% of Conrail's contractual obligations for long-term debt (including capital leases) and operating leases. Conrail has no unconditional purchase or other long-term obligations.\n\nOff balance sheet arrangements consist of an accounts receivable sale program (see Note 5). Under the program, NS sells without recourse undivided ownership interests in a pool of accounts receivable to two unrelated buyers. NS has no ownership interest in the buyers. The buyers issued debt to fund their initial purchase, and NS used the proceeds it received from the initial purchase primarily to pay down its outstanding debt. NS has no obligation related to the buyers' debt, and there is no existing obligation to repurchase sold receivables. Upon termination of the program, the buyers would cease purchasing new receivables and would retain collections related to the previously sold receivables (see Note 5). As of Dec. 31, 2003, there were no accounts receivable sold, however, NS has the capability to increase the amounts sold, as discussed above.\n\nCash used for investing activities decreased 5% in 2003 and increased 12% in 2002. Property additions, which account for most of the recurring spending in this category, were up 4% in 2003 and down 8% in 2002. Property sales were higher in 2003, which resulted in the net decrease in cash used for investing activities. The following tables show capital spending (including capital leases) and track and equipment statistics for the past five years.\n\nCapital expenditures increased 4% in 2003 and decreased 7% in 2002 (which included $6 million of capitalized leases). The increase in 2003 reflects higher locomotive purchases offset, in part, by lower spending on signal and electrical projects and computers. The decline in 2002 reflected higher spending\n\nK30\n\non track program work that was offset by fewer locomotive purchases (50 in 2002 compared with 100 in 2001) and lower spending for intermodal facilities.\n\nNS and six other railroads (five Class I railroads and a commuter railroad) have agreed to participate in the Chicago Region Environmental and Transportation Efficiency (CREATE) project in Chicago. The project is a proposed public-private partnership between the railroads and city, state and federal governments to design and implement a comprehensive plan to keep passenger and freight trains moving on schedule through the metropolitan Chicago area, the largest rail transportation hub in the U.S. The intent is to reduce rail and highway congestion and add freight and passenger capacity. The project is estimated to cost $1.5 billion with city, state and federal support. The railroads’ financial contribution to the project is contingent upon a binding commitment that establishes the availability, on terms and conditions satisfactory to the railroads, of all required public funding and of third-party properties necessary to complete the entire project. If public funding is secured, the railroads will contribute a total of $232 million towards the project with NS’ share slated to be $34 million over an estimated six-year period.\n\nThe table above excludes equipment leased from PRR (see Note 2), which comprises 17% of the freight car fleet and 22% of the locomotive fleet.\n\nThrough its coal car rebody program, which was suspended in 2000, NS converted about 29,000 hopper cars into high-capacity steel gondolas or hoppers. As a result, the remaining service life of the freight-car fleet is greater than may be inferred from the increasing average age shown in the table above.\n\nFor 2004, NS has budgeted $810 million for capital expenditures. The anticipated spending includes $517 million for roadway projects, of which $384 million is for track and bridge program work. Also included are projects for communications, signal and electrical systems, as well as projects for environmental and public improvements such as grade crossing separations and signal upgrades. Other roadway projects include marketing and industrial development initiatives, including increasing track capacity and access to coal receivers and vehicle production and distribution facilities, and continuing investments in intermodal infrastructure. Equipment spending of $220 million includes the purchase of 100 locomotives and upgrades to existing units, improvements to multilevel automobile racks, and projects related to computers and information technology, including additional security and backup systems.\n\nK31\n\nCash used for financing activities was $314 million in 2003 and $150 million in 2002. Financing activities provided cash of $151 million in 2001. The comparisons reflect net reductions of debt in 2003 and 2002 and a net increase in 2001. Financing activities include loan transactions with a subsidiary of PRR that resulted in net borrowings of $203 million in 2003, $212 million in 2002 and $250 million in 2001 (see Note 2). Excluding these borrowings, debt was reduced $370 million in 2003, $303 million in 2002 and $20 million in 2001. NS' debt-to-total capitalization ratio (excluding notes payable to the PRR subsidiary) at year end was 50.7% in 2003 and 53.1% in 2002.\n\nIn 2003, NS redeemed all publicly held shares of Norfolk Southern Railway’s $2.60 Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series A for a redemption price of $50 per share plus accrued and unpaid dividends, for an aggregate redemption price of $50.2066. The total use of cash was $43 million.\n\nNS currently has in place and available a $1 billion, five-year credit agreement, which provides for borrowings at prevailing rates and includes financial covenants (see Note 8).\n\nNS has outstanding $717 million of its 7.05% notes due May 1, 2037. Each holder of a 2037 note may require NS to redeem all or part of the note at face value, plus accrued and unpaid interest, on May 1, 2004. NS will not know the amount of 2037 notes that it may be required to redeem until April 1, 2004. Should it be necessary, NS has the ability and intent to refinance such notes properly presented.\n\nAPPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates and assumptions may require significant judgment about matters that are inherently uncertain, and future events are likely to occur that may require management to change them. Accordingly, management regularly reviews these estimates and assumptions based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Management discusses the development, selection and disclosures concerning critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of its Board of Directors.\n\nPensions and Other Postretirement Benefits\n\nAccounting for pensions and other postretirement benefit plans requires management to make several estimates and assumptions (see Note 11). These include the expected rate of return from investment of the plans' assets, projected increases in medical costs and the expected retirement age of employees as well as their projected earnings and mortality. In addition, the amounts recorded are affected by changes in the interest rate environment because the associated liabilities are discounted to their present value. Management makes these estimates based on the company's historical experience and other information that it deems pertinent under the circumstances (for example, expectations of future stock market performance). Management engages an independent consulting actuarial firm to aid it in selecting appropriate assumptions and valuing its related liabilities.\n\nNS' net pension benefit, which is included in “Compensation and benefits” on its Consolidated Income Statement, was $25 million for the year ended Dec. 31, 2003, including $19 million related to the voluntary separation program. In recording this amount, NS assumed a long-term investment rate of return of 9%. Investment experience of the pension fund over the past 10-, 15- and 20-year periods has\n\nK32\n\nbeen in excess of 10%. A one percentage point change to this rate of return assumption would result in a $17 million change to the pension credit and, as a result, an equal change in “Compensation and benefits” expense. Changes that are reasonably likely to occur in assumptions concerning retirement age, projected earnings and mortality would not be expected to have a material effect on NS' net pension benefit or net pension asset in the future. The net pension asset is recorded at its net present value using a discount rate that is based on the current interest rate environment; therefore, management has little discretion in this assumption.\n\nNS' net cost for other postretirement benefits, which is also included in “Compensation and benefits,” was $80 million for the year ended Dec. 31, 2003, which included $22 million related to the voluntary separation program. In recording this expense and valuing the net liability for other postretirement benefits, which is included in “Other benefits” as disclosed in Note 11, management estimated future increases in health-care costs. These assumptions, along with the effect of a one percentage point change in them, are described in Note 11. Additionally, as discussed in Note 11, recent changes to Medicare are expected to reduce NS’ postretirement benefit costs.\n\nProperties and Depreciation\n\nMost of NS' total assets are comprised of long-lived railway properties (see Note 6) and its investment in Conrail (see Note 2). Most of Conrail's assets are long-lived railway properties. As disclosed in Note 1, NS' properties are depreciated using group depreciation. Rail is depreciated primarily on the basis of use measured by gross-ton miles. Other properties are depreciated generally using the straight-line method over the lesser of estimated service or lease lives. NS reviews the carrying amount of properties whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such carrying amount may not be recoverable based on future undiscounted cash flows or estimated net realizable value. Assets that are deemed impaired as a result of such review are recorded at the lesser of carrying amount or fair value. NS is amortizing the excess of the purchase price paid for its investment in Conrail over its share of Conrail's net equity using the principles of purchase accounting, based primarily on the estimated remaining useful lives of Conrail's properties.\n\nNS' depreciation expense is based on management's assumptions concerning service lives of its properties as well as the expected net salvage that will be received upon their retirement. These assumptions are the product of periodic depreciation studies that are performed by a firm of consulting engineers. These studies analyze NS' historical patterns of asset use and retirement and take into account any expected change in operation or maintenance practices. NS' recent experience with these studies has been that while they do result in changes in the rates used to depreciate its properties, these changes have not caused a significant effect to its annual depreciation expense. The studies may also indicate that the recorded amount of accumulated depreciation is deficient (or in excess) of the amount indicated by the study. Any such deficiency (or excess) is amortized as a component of depreciation expense over the remaining service lives of the affected class of property. NS' “Depreciation expense” for the year ended Dec. 31, 2003, amounted to $513 million. NS' weighted-average depreciation rates for 2003 are disclosed in Note 6; a one-tenth percentage point increase (or decrease) in these rates would result in a $18 million increase (or decrease) to NS' depreciation expense.\n\nPersonal Injury, Environmental and Legal Liabilities\n\nNS' expense for “Casualties and other claims” amounted to $181 million for the year ended Dec. 31, 2003. Most of this expense was composed of NS' accrual related to personal injury liabilities (see discussion of FELA in the discussion captioned “Casualties and other claims” on page K27). NS engages an independent consulting actuarial firm to aid in valuing its personal injury liability and determining the amount to accrue during the year. The actuarial firm studies NS' historical patterns of reserving for\n\nK33\n\nclaims and subsequent settlements. The actuary also takes into account outside influences considered pertinent. The study uses the results of these analyses to estimate the ultimate amount of the liability, which includes amounts for incurred but unasserted claims. NS has recorded this actuarially determined liability. The liability is dependent upon many individual judgments made as to the specific case reserves as well as the judgments of the consulting actuary and management in the periodic studies. Accordingly, there could be significant changes in the liability, which NS would recognize when such a change became known. The most recent actuarial study was performed as of Sept. 30, 2003, and resulted in a slight decrease to NS' personal injury liability during the fourth quarter. While the liability recorded is supported by the most recent study, it is reasonably possible that the liability could be higher or lower.\n\nNS is subject to various jurisdictions' environmental laws and regulations. It is NS' policy to record a liability where such liability or loss is probable and its amount can be estimated reasonably (see Note 18). Environmental engineers regularly participate in ongoing evaluations of all known sites and in determining any necessary adjustments to liability estimates. NS also has established an Environmental Policy Council, composed of senior managers, to oversee and interpret its environmental policy.\n\nOperating expenses for environmental matters totaled approximately $9 million in 2003, $15 million in 2002 and $12 million in 2001, and capital expenditures totaled approximately $9 million in 2003, and $10 million in both 2002 and 2001. Capital expenditures in 2004 are expected to be comparable to those in 2003.\n\nNS' balance sheets included liabilities for environmental exposures in the amount of $25 million at Dec. 31, 2003, and $29 million at Dec. 31, 2002, (of which $8 million was accounted for as a current liability in each year). At Dec. 31, 2003, the liability represented NS' estimate of the probable cleanup and remediation costs based on available information at 113 identified locations. On that date, 10 sites accounted for $12 million of the liability, and no individual site was considered to be material. NS anticipates that much of this liability will be paid out over five years; however, some costs will be paid out over a longer period.\n\nAt some of the 113 locations, certain NS subsidiaries, usually in conjunction with a number of other parties, have been identified as potentially responsible parties by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or similar state authorities under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, or comparable state statutes, which often impose joint and several liability for cleanup costs.\n\nWith respect to known environmental sites (whether identified by NS or by the EPA or comparable state authorities), estimates of NS' ultimate potential financial exposure for a given site or in the aggregate for all such sites are necessarily imprecise because of the widely varying costs of currently available cleanup techniques, the likely development of new cleanup technologies, the difficulty of determining in advance the nature and full extent of contamination and each potential participant's share of any estimated loss (and that participant's ability to bear it), and evolving statutory and regulatory standards governing liability. NS estimates its environmental remediation liability on a site-by-site basis, using assumptions and judgments that management deems appropriate for each site. As a result, it is not practical to quantitatively describe the effects of changes in these many assumptions and judgments. NS has consistently applied its methodology of estimating its environmental liabilities.\n\nThe risk of incurring environmental liability is inherent in the railroad business. Some of the commodities in NS' traffic mix, particularly those classified as hazardous materials, can pose special risks that NS and its subsidiaries work diligently to minimize. In addition, several NS subsidiaries own, or have owned, land used as operating property, or which is leased and operated by others, or held for sale. Because environmental problems may exist on these properties that are latent or undisclosed, there can be\n\nK34\n\nno assurance that NS will not incur environmentally related liabilities or costs with respect to one or more of them, the amount and materiality of which cannot be estimated reliably at this time. Moreover, lawsuits and claims involving these and potentially other unidentified environmental sites and matters are likely to arise from time to time. The resulting liabilities could have a significant effect on financial condition, results of operations or liquidity in a particular year or quarter.\n\nHowever, based on its assessment of the facts and circumstances now known, management believes that it has recorded the probable costs for dealing with those environmental matters of which the Corporation is aware. Further, management believes that it is unlikely that any known matters, either individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on NS' financial position, results of operations or liquidity.\n\nNorfolk Southern and certain subsidiaries are defendants in numerous lawsuits and other claims relating principally to railroad operations. When management concludes that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated, it is accrued through a charge to expenses. While the ultimate amount of liability incurred in any of these lawsuits and claims is dependent on future developments, in management's opinion the recorded liability, if any, is adequate to cover the future payment of such liability and claims. However, the final outcome of any of these lawsuits and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, and unfavorable or unexpected outcomes could result in additional accruals that could be significant to results of operations in a particular year or quarter. Any adjustments to recorded liabilities will be reflected in expenses in the periods in which such adjustments are known.\n\nIncome Taxes\n\nNS' net long-term deferred tax liability totaled $3,223 million at Dec. 31, 2003 (see Note 4). This liability is estimated based on the expected future tax consequences of items recognized in the financial statements. After application of the federal statutory tax rate to book income, judgment is required with respect to the timing and deductibility of expenses in the corporate income tax returns. For state income and other taxes, judgment is also required with respect to the apportionment among the various jurisdictions. A valuation allowance is recorded if management expects that it is more likely than not that its deferred tax assets will not be realized. NS has a $22 million valuation allowance on $628 million of deferred tax assets as of Dec. 31, 2003, reflecting the expectation that most of these assets will be realized. For 2003, 2002 and 2001, the effective tax rates, excluding NS' equity in Conrail's earnings, were 33%, 38% and 38%, respectively. For every one half percent change in the 2003 effective tax rate, net income would have changed by $3 million.\n\nCONRAIL'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY\n\nConrail's net income was $203 million in 2003, compared with $180 million in 2002 and $174 million in 2001 (see Note 2). Results in 2003 included $40 million for the cumulative effect on years prior to 2003 of a change in accounting principles as required by Conrail’s adoption of SFAS No. 143. NS excluded this amount from its determination of equity in earnings of Conrail because an amount related to Conrail is included in NS’ cumulative effect adjustment for SFAS No. 143. Conrail’s income before the accounting change was $163 million, $17 million below 2002, reflecting lower income from operations.\n\nConrail's operating revenues were $918 million in 2003, $893 million in 2002 and $903 million in 2001. The 2003 increase was primarily attributable to higher operating fees related to PRR and NYC. The decrease in 2002 resulted from the expiration of certain equipment leases and lower operating fees, largely because of reduced operating costs in the Shared Assets Areas.\n\nK35\n\nConrail's operating expenses were $659 million in 2003, $623 million in 2002 and $639 million in 2001. The increase in 2003 was primarily the result of higher expenses for compensation and benefits, and casualties and insurance. The decrease in 2002 reflected lower expenses for materials, services and rents and compensation and benefits, which were offset, in part, by higher costs for casualties and other claims.\n\nConrail's cash provided by operations decreased $11 million, or 3%, in 2003, and $79 million, or 16%, in 2002. The decrease in 2003 reflects the absence of an IRS refund received in 2002 that was partially offset by a decreased use of cash for casualty payments. The decline in 2002 was primarily the result of the absence of two items that benefited 2001: a $50 million cash payment for transferring to a third party certain rights to license, manage and market signboard advertising on Conrail's property for 25 years and proceeds from a favorable insurance settlement. This was offset, in part, by favorable changes in working capital. Cash generated from operations is Conrail's principal source of liquidity and is primarily used for debt repayments and capital expenditures. Debt repayments totaled $57 million in 2003 and $59 million in 2002. Capital expenditures totaled $35 million in 2003 and $23 million in 2002.\n\nConrail had a working capital deficit of $22 million at Dec. 31, 2003, and $29 million at Dec. 31, 2002. Conrail is not an SEC registrant and, therefore, presently cannot issue any publicly traded securities. Conrail is expected to have sufficient cash flow to meet its ongoing obligations.\n\nNS' equity in earnings of Conrail, net of amortization, was $58 million in 2003, $54 million in 2002 and $44 million in 2001. NS' other comprehensive income (loss) for 2003, 2002 and 2001, as shown in the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Stockholders' Equity, included a $14 million gain, a $34 million loss and a $41 million loss, respectively, for its portion of Conrail's other comprehensive loss (see Note 13).\n\nOTHER MATTERS\n\nLabor Agreements\n\nApproximately 24,000 of NS' railroad employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with 14 different labor unions. These agreements remain in effect until changed pursuant to the Railway Labor Act. Moratorium provisions in these agreements permitted NS and the unions to propose such changes in late 1999; negotiations at the national level commenced shortly thereafter.\n\nAgreements have been reached with the Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employes (BMWE), which represents about 4,200 NS employees; the United Transportation Union (UTU), which represents about 6,700 NS employees; the International Brotherhood of Boilermakers and Blacksmiths (IBB), which represents about 100 NS employees; the Transportation Communications International Union (TCU), which represents about 4,400 NS employees; the American Train Dispatchers Department (ATDD), which represents about 400 NS employees; the Brotherhood of Railroad Signalmen (BRS), which represents about 1,100 NS employees; and the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers (BLE), which represents about 4,500 NS employees. The agreement with the BLE was through 2004; NS recently reached a further contract extension with BLE through 2009. A tentative agreement with the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW), which represents about 900 NS employees, failed ratification.\n\nHealth and welfare issues have been resolved with BMWE, TCU, BRS, BLE and UTU. Health and welfare issues with the other organizations have not yet been resolved.\n\nK36\n\nMarket Risks and Hedging Activities\n\nNS uses derivative financial instruments to reduce the risk of volatility in its diesel fuel costs and to manage its overall exposure to fluctuations in interest rates.\n\nIn 2001, NS began a program to hedge a portion of its diesel fuel consumption. The intent of the program is to assist in the management of NS' aggregate risk exposure to fuel price fluctuations, which can significantly affect NS' operating margins and profitability, through the use of one or more types of derivative instruments.\n\nDiesel fuel costs represented 7% of NS' operating expenses for 2003. The program provides that NS will not enter into any fuel hedges with a duration of more than 36 months, and that no more than 80% of NS' average monthly fuel consumption will be hedged for any month within any 36-month period.\n\nAs of Dec. 31, 2003, through swap transactions, NS has hedged approximately 63% of expected 2004 diesel fuel requirements. The effect of the hedges is to yield an average cost of 78 cents per hedged gallon, including federal taxes and transportation. A 10% decrease in diesel fuel prices would reduce NS' asset related to the swaps by approximately $38 million as of Dec. 31, 2003.\n\nNS manages its overall exposure to fluctuations in interest rates by issuing both fixed- and floating-rate debt instruments and by entering into interest-rate hedging transactions to achieve an appropriate mix within its debt portfolio.\n\nAt Dec. 31, 2003, NS' debt subject to interest rate fluctuations totaled $636 million (excluding debt due to the PRR subsidiary). A 1% increase in interest rates would increase NS' total annual interest expense related to all its variable debt by approximately $6 million. Management considers it unlikely that interest rate fluctuations applicable to these instruments will result in a material adverse effect on NS' financial position, results of operations or liquidity.\n\nSome of NS' capital leases, which carry an average fixed rate of 7%, were effectively converted to variable rate obligations using interest rate swap agreements. On Dec. 31, 2003, the average pay rate under these agreements was 1.6%, and the average receive rate was 7%. During 2003, the effect of the swaps was to reduce interest expense by $10 million. A portion of the lease obligations is payable in Japanese yen. NS eliminated the associated exchange rate risk at the inception of each lease with a yen deposit sufficient to fund the yen-denominated obligation. Most of these deposits are held by foreign banks, primarily Japanese. As a result, NS is exposed to financial market risk relative to Japan. Counterparties to the interest rate swaps and Japanese banks holding yen deposits are major financial institutions believed by management to be creditworthy.\n\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\n\nAs discussed in Note 1, effective Jan. 1, 2003, NS adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement No. 143, “Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations,” (SFAS No. 143) and FASB Interpretation No. 46, “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities,” (FIN No. 46).\n\nInflation\n\nIn preparing financial statements, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America require the use of historical cost that disregards the effects of inflation on the replacement cost of property. NS, a capital-intensive company, has most of its capital invested in such assets. The\n\nK37\n\nreplacement cost of these assets, as well as the related depreciation expense, would be substantially greater than the amounts reported on the basis of historical cost.\n\nTrends\n\nFederal Economic Regulation -- Efforts may be made in 2004 to reimpose unwarranted federal economic regulation on the rail industry. The Staggers Rail Act of 1980, which substantially reduced such regulation, encouraged and enabled rail carriers to innovate and to compete for business. NS and other rail carriers will oppose any efforts to reimpose unwarranted economic regulation.\n\nUtility Deregulation -- Deregulation of the electrical utility industry is expected to increase competition among electric power generators; deregulation over time would permit wholesalers and possibly retailers of electric power to sell or purchase increasing quantities of power to or from distant parties. The effects of deregulation on NS and on its customers cannot be predicted with certainty; however, NS serves a number of efficient power producers who are expected to remain competitive in this evolving environment.\n\nCarbon-Based Fuel -- There is growing concern in some quarters that emissions resulting from burning carbon-based fuel, including coal, are contributing to global warming and causing other environmental changes. To the extent that these concerns evolve into a consensus among policy-makers, the impact could be either a reduction in the demand for coal or imposition of more stringent regulations on emissions, which might result in making coal a less economical source of power generation or make permitting of coal-fired facilities even more difficult. The revenues and net income of NSR and other railroads that move large quantities of coal could be affected adversely.\n\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\n\nThis Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains forward-looking statements that may be identified by the use of words like “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate” and “project.” Forward-looking statements reflect management's good-faith evaluation of information currently available. However, such statements are dependent on and, therefore, can be influenced by, a number of external variables over which management has little or no control, including: domestic and international economic conditions; the business environment in industries that produce and consume rail freight; competition and consolidation within the transportation industry; fluctuation in prices of key materials, in particular diesel fuel; labor difficulties, including strikes and work stoppages; legislative and regulatory developments; changes in securities and capital markets; and natural events such as severe weather, floods and earthquakes. Forward-looking statements are not, and should not be relied upon as, a guaranty of future performance or results. Nor will they necessarily prove to be accurate indications of the times at or by which any such performance or results will be achieved. As a result, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements. The Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise forward-looking statements.\n\nItem 7A .. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.\n\nThe information required by this item is included in Part II, Item 7, “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” under the heading “Market Risks and Hedging Activities.”\n\nK38\n\nItem 8 .. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\n\nK39\n\nReport of Management\n\nJanuary 27, 2004\n\nTo the Stockholders\n\nNorfolk Southern Corporation\n\nManagement is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements included in this annual report. The financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and reflect management's judgments and estimates concerning effects of events and transactions that are accounted for or disclosed.\n\nManagement is also responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. The Corporation's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that pertain to the Corporation's ability to record, process, summarize and report reliable financial data. Management recognizes that there are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of internal control. Accordingly, even effective internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement pre"
