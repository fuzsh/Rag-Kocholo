The subcommittee met at 10:05 a.m., in room SD-192, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Hon. Richard C. Shelby (chairman) presiding. Present: Senators Shelby, Specter, Lautenberg, and Mikulski. Also present: Senator Warner. Panel 1 NONDEPARTMENTAL WITNESSES STATEMENT OF HON. PARRIS GLENDENING, GOVERNOR, STATE OF MARYLAND Opening Remarks of Senator Shelby Senator Shelby. The committee will come to order. At today's hearing we will explore some of the issues likely to be raised by the proposed acquisition of the Consolidated Rail Corporation, better known as Conrail, by the CSX Corp. and the Norfolk Southern Corp. I scheduled this hearing at the request of Senator Specter, who has strong concerns about the possible impact of this proposal on the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Several other States represented on this subcommittee might be affected as well, such as my State of Alabama, Maryland, Missouri, North Carolina, West Virginia, and so forth, and I expect that our ranking member, Senator Lautenberg, will discuss his views on the proposal's possible implications for New Jersey. Congress created Conrail in 1973, following the bankruptcies of seven private railroads. The Federal Government began operating Conrail on April 1, 1976, and invested over $7 billion in taxpayers' funds to cover Conrail's capital and operating needs. In 1986, Congress voted to authorize a public stock offering of the Federal Government's holdings of Conrail stock. Ten years ago, in the spring of 1987, Conrail was privatized in a process that produced $1.95 billion for the Federal Government, $1.65 billion from a stock sale, and $300 million from the Conrail excess cash. It is interesting to note that the current asking price for Conrail is about $10.5 billion, an increase in value of 438 percent over the past 10 years. Conrail is now the largest freight railroad in the Northeast, operating an 11,000-mile rail freight network that serves 12 States, the District of Columbia, and the Province of Quebec. Conrail's 1995 revenue was $3.7 billion. On October 15, 1996, Conrail and CSX announced a merger of equals, that would have created a powerful strategic alliance between the two railroads. The agreement called for Conrail's shareholders to receive a combination of cash and CSX stock value of $8.4 billion, or $92.50 per Conrail share. Norfolk Southern then made a competing all-cash offer to buy Conrail at a higher price, and Conrail shareholders supported this approach. This month, on March 3, Conrail's board approved a revised agreement with CSX that would enable shareholders to receive about $10.5 billion, or $115 per Conrail share, and permit CSX and Norfolk Southern to negotiate a splitting up of the Conrail system. I understand that CSX and Norfolk Southern are now working out the framework of a joint acquisition deal that will basically partition the Conrail system. Once completed, the details of this agreement will have to be approved by the Surface Transportation Board [STB], which is the successor agency to the Interstate Commerce Commission. We will hear from Linda Morgan, Chairman of STB, later this morning. The subcommittee will also be interested in hearing how the STB reviews applications to approve railroad mergers, both in terms of policy and in procedure. At this point in time, none of us know the details of how this merger proposal will be structured, when it will be filed with the STB, or what a final package might contain in order to satisfy the STB. Hopefully, once it is finalized and submitted to STB, the end product will be an improved freight rail system for the entire eastern and southeastern region. I understand that significant rail service improvements are possible by a streamlined, single-line service from the South into Eastern markets. In my State of Alabama, and other States in the South, this may present a unique opportunity to access new markets faster, more efficiently, and without adding congestion to all overcrowded interstate highways. More competition and better quality service should enhance rail traffic moving through the region and provide valuable benefit to consumers. I look forward to hearing from our witnesses today, and at this time I am going to recognize Senator Lautenberg, the ranking member. STATEMENT OF SENATOR LAUTENBERG Senator Lautenberg. Thanks very much, Mr. Chairman. The issue of rail competition in the Eastern United States is critical to the economy of New Jersey and the entire mid- Atlantic and northeast region, so I look forward to hearing from our witnesses this morning. I want to hear them discuss their views on the possible purchase of Conrail by CSX, and the division of Conrail's assets between CSX and Norfolk Southern. As we hear this testimony, however, it must be remembered that the precise impacts of this proposed purchase of Conrail will very much depend on how its assets are divided. Negotiations on this issue, I understand, are still ongoing. To date, no applications or operating plans have been filed with the Surface Transportation Board. As such, the testimony today may lack some details, and in this deal, the devil is obviously going to be in the details, so we cannot rush to judgment. There is a great deal of enthusiasm in my State regarding the potential reintroduction of real rail competition into the region, as well as the Ports of New York and New Jersey. Our Newark, NJ, Port is the largest container port in the Eastern United States, and it is one of the largest container ports in the world; however, it has been served almost exclusively by only one railroad, Conrail, since that railroad was created in 1976. While the Federal Government sought to create a competitive environment in the port at that time, these efforts went unfulfilled. I have followed the issue closely. Since that time I have been very active on the issue, not only as a Senator, but I was formerly a commissioner of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. Back in 1984, 1985, I strenuously opposed efforts by Norfolk Southern to purchase Conrail at that time. Not only was the railroad being sold I thought too cheaply, but coming from the corporate world, I was thinking of the public market place, and thank goodness we did it. The proposed arrangement appeared to encourage, at that time, the bleeding of cargo and jobs away from the ports of New York and New Jersey, and the arrangement did nothing to encourage competition within the port. Thirteen years later we find that our long-awaited goal of competition in the port may finally be fulfilled. Competition in the port holds the promise of more jobs, due to greater rail traffic at more competitive grades. But in order for that to happen, we must have serious competition that provides shippers with a real choice. CSX and Norfolk Southern are discussing a bold plan, with the intention of going toe to toe in very promising markets, and I want to encourage the division of Conrail's assets to maximize competition. As a highway safety advocate, I am also encouraged by the prospect of moving some of our truck traffic off of our interstates and major highways. It will cut congestion, reduce pollution, and save lives; however, our railroads do not have unlimited capacity. More than any other State, New Jersey's commuter rail system is integrally linked with our existing freight network. Currently, just under 14,000 commuters a day travel over lines owned and operated by Conrail. Conrail also operates over lines owned by New Jersey Transit, that serve 11,500 commuters a day. New Jersey Transit is conducting studies and preliminary design work on several new potential commuter rail lines, and many of these new lines would be required to operate over freight-owned railroad lines. So I am interested in the impact of expanded freight traffic on New Jersey's mass transit system, its commuters, and its environment. In planning the division of Conrail's assets, transit opportunities must be fully viewed. We accomplish very little by moving truck traffic onto the rails, only to force transit commuters back on the highways. Finally, I want to raise the issue of rail safety. Recent press reports indicate that there are plans being developed to dramatically increase freight operations over Amtrak's Northeast corridor. In 1987, I visited Chase, MD, the scene of a crash between a Conrail freight train and an Amtrak passenger train. That gruesome sight was one that no one could easily forget. The Rail Safety Act of 1988 included provisions that I advocated, that were intended to minimize freight traffic on the Northeast corridor. Now, many of the Nation's freight railroads argue that high-speed passenger rail and freight traffic do not mix. If that is true, then the question has to be asked: How can we expand freight operations over the Northeast corridor at the same time that Amtrak is procuring new high-speed train sets for 150-mile-an-hour service over the corridor? Moreover, Amtrak and the commuter railroads expect to increase use of the corridor in future years. Train services cannot be expanded over our Nation's busiest passenger rail corridor if it will risk lives. I feel that I must say that we can make the accommodations that are necessary, and, again, it very much depends on how committed the freight rail service is to participating fully with passenger service. I am told by experts that they can coexist, and I hope that is the case. I thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, for the opportunity. Senator Shelby. Senator Specter. STATEMENT OF SENATOR SPECTER Senator Specter. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, and thank you for convening this hearing so promptly, within 2 weeks of the renegotiation of the Conrail-CSX merger, with the new arrangement between CSX and Norfolk Southern. I have been in this hearing room on many occasions in the past one and one-half decades, and I have never seen it standing-room-only, with so many corporate executives and so many corporate counsel here. This is a unique hearing in this Appropriations Committee hearing room. I think that it is very important for the Congress to take a very close look as part of our oversight function as to what is happening in this transaction. The Congress has been intimately familiar with Conrail, with the events of the seventies, and the efforts of the administration to sell Conrail to Norfolk Southern, which was a hard-fought battle, involving very detailed hearings of the Antitrust Subcommittee of the Judiciary. We finally stopped that sale. They said Conrail could not survive as an independent entity, and it did, and it flourished. The issues here are of enormous importance nationally, in terms of access to competitive shipping rates, and of extreme importance to my own State, Pennsylvania. When we take a look at just a few of the statistics, they are sort of overwhelming. More than 8,100 Pennsylvania residents are employed by Conrail. Conrail employees live in 64 of Pennsylvania's 67 counties, a tremendous economic impact on the State as a whole, and especially heavy in Pittsburgh, Altoona, Harrisburg, and Philadelphia. When you take a look at the $31 million in State and local taxes paid in Pennsylvania, it is obviously a major, major impact, and $7 million in the Philadelphia wage tax alone, a figure that makes our distinguished Mayor Rendell sit up and take notice. What I am looking for here is to monitor very closely to see what the impact will be. When you have a contract between Conrail and CSX, and then there is a new arrangement, there is no one left that might appear to enforce Conrail's rights under the original agreement. The shareholders were delighted with the very high price, $115 a share paid, but I think it is important to know that under the applicable law there are other parties and interests with standing. The employees of Conrail have standing because under the Federal law, the employees have to be considered by the Surface Transportation Board, and under the Pennsylvania Takeover Act, the Pennsylvania communities have standing. It may well be that this transaction will work out to the benefit of the Nation and to Pennsylvania, and I think that has to be determined. But we have to note that these rail mergers, in the entire history of Conrail, in the entire history of the industry, have been very rough and tumble, and if we play by the Marquis of Queensberry rules, that is fine, but I think it is very important that the Congress and the Senators, whose States have vital interests here, be very much on top of it, as it moves through the process. I have had a chance to discuss this matter at length with David Levan, the CEO of Conrail, and John Snow, the CEO of CSX, and David Goode, the CEO of Norfolk Southern, and it may be that there will be increased facilities in many parts of Pennsylvania, in a terminal in Harrisburg, or in competition in Philadelphia. And it may be that part of Conrail will be maintained, that there may be some joint operations, and if that were to follow, that would be a very, very good signal. So I welcome these hearings, Mr. Chairman, and I thank you for the suggestion which you made yesterday of field hearings in Pennsylvania, which I would like to see move forward perhaps as early as April 7, consistent with the schedules that the subcommittee has. Thank you very much. Senator Shelby. Senator Mikulski, I know you just arrived. Do you have an opening statement? Senator Mikulski. I sure do, Mr. Chairman. Senator Shelby. OK. Sure. You will be recognized. STATEMENT OF SENATOR MIKULSKI Senator Mikulski. I like to think of myself as the little engine that could, for Maryland, and so, therefore, I am delighted to be at this hearing, and I would---- Senator Shelby. Senator, the little engine that has done so many things, not just could. Senator Mikulski. Well, you are very kind, Mr. Chairman. First of all, I am going to thank you personally for conducting this hearing, and allowing it to go forth. For those of us in the Northeast corridor, particularly, the Boston to Carolina, going through New York, New Jersey, Maryland, and Virginia, there is nothing more important than railroads. Railroads built our communities, we are railroad-dependent communities, and, of course, in my own State, we are very much concerned about the entire job issue. Know this, that ultimately we, in Maryland, are very much concerned about certain basic issues, the first and foremost is jobs, and we want to know what this merger means in terms of jobs, what does it mean to the great Port of Baltimore, to be able to have competitive railroads, so that our port is thriving, and we are just not the largest barge port or pond in the corridor. Second, we are concerned about jobs in western Maryland, up in the Cumberland area, where really, the railroads are so crucial to the viability of that community. We are interested in what the railroad means to the Delmarva Peninsula, so that we have rail service, to be able to bring our grain in, so that we can have our vibrant poultry industry. In addition to that, we are, of course, very much concerned about what this rail merger could have as an impact on passenger line, the so-called Marc train, which allows people to live in Maryland and commute to jobs primarily here in the District of Columbia. And last, but not at all least, we are concerned about what type of infrastructure improvements need to be made. So, Mr. Chairman, as the hearing goes forth, I will look forward to discussing this with my Governor, who has led the way in a task force with his secretary of transportation, Mr. Winstead, on analyzing these issues and what we need, and I look forward to hearing from our railroad tycoons what their responses are to how we are going to generate jobs, keep jobs in Maryland, while they are trying to sort out how they can generate profits for shareholders. We would hope that those two would be mutually compatible, and then if that occurs, I will be very happy to be the little engine that could. Thank you very much. Senator Shelby. We are joined today by our colleague, Senator Warner. If you have any statement you want to make, your written statement will be made part of the record in its entirety. You may proceed. STATEMENT OF SENATOR WARNER Senator Warner. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and members of the committee. I agree that there is a role for the Congress to review these proposals, but it is the depth and the time that will be consumed in that review which really, I think, is at issue. I strongly support the efforts by these two private sector entities and others to make this happen. I support the proposal, because I believe that by opening the Northeast to rail competition, for the first time in several decades, it will yield substantial benefits to American business and consumers throughout our country, not just here in the East. Ensuring a strong rail network through the East has been a long-sought goal, and a matter that I know, Mr. Chairman, has been of interest to you and other members of this panel. The fact that a solution is being developed through the private sector initiative, without governmental intervention, I think is most notable. Today, CSX and Norfolk Southern are engaged in negotiation to divide Conrail's operation, giving both rail systems access to the Northeast. The final plan is not yet completed, but I believe the negotiations will produce and enhance competition, especially in the area north of my State, Virginia. Two strong railroads serving industry and agriculture east of the Mississippi ultimately will benefit shippers and consumers alike throughout the region and the Nation. I say to you, my good friend, Senator Specter, I keenly share your concern for the long history of rail in your State, but as you said, in reference to the Marquis of Queensberry, this is a one-rail market that this group behind us are involved in every day, and those marketplaces beyond our shares do not play with the Marquis of Queensberry rules. It is tough, and I think it is incumbent upon us as a Congress to do everything we can to encourage the private sector and industry in their ability to meet that competition. In Virginia we have a particular interest in the process, and have paid great attention to the unfolding events in the last 5 months involving Conrail, which, as you know, is the overwhelming rail presence in the Northeast. CSX and Norfolk Southern provide service throughout the Mid-Atlantic and Southeast. Both Norfolk Southern and CSX are corporate citizens of the Commonwealth, combined, 8,000 employees, 3,300 miles of rails in our State. The thousands of businesses and industries in my State that depend on our railroads, including coal, paper, chemicals, and, indeed, I must say, critically, national defense, are looking for faster, more efficient, direct service to the vast consumer markets in the Northeast. Our ports want to strengthen the global reach through improved north-south intermodal networks. The solution that is being devised, I believe, promises to satisfy these goals. I would hope that we in Congress would allow these discussions to come to completion. Congress must not attempt, I say to my distinguished colleagues, to write this operating plan. Mr. Chairman, I would like to call attention to the fact that Congress wisely has created an independent quasi-judicial agency to evaluate the public interest and transactions of this nature, the Surface Transportation Board. The STB must provide a forum for all interests, including employees, communities, and shippers, affected by this transaction, to be heard. With that venue available to us, I believe there is an appropriate process in place to address the valid concerns of the many in this Northeast corridor, and elsewhere in the country. That concludes my statement, it's short and to the point. Prepared Statement Senator Shelby. Thank you, Senator Warner. We will insert your complete statement in the record. [The statement follows:] Prepared Statement of Senator Warner Mr. Chairman, thank you for permitting me to appear before the Subcommittee today to address an issue which is very important to the Commonwealth of Virginia. The economic and public policy considerations posed by pending changes in the nation's rail system certainly warrant review, and I welcome the opportunity to share my thoughts with you on these important matters. I am pleased to be here to endorse the restructuring of the Northeast rail system that is underway. I support the proposal because I believe that, by opening the Northeast to rail competition for the first time in several decades, it will yield substantial benefits to American businesses and consumers. Ensuring a strong rail network throughout the East has been a long-sought goal and a matter that I know, Mr. Chairman, has been of interest to you. The fact that a solution is being developed through a private sector initiative, without government intervention, I find particularly noteworthy. Today, CSX and Norfolk Southern are engaged in talks to divide Conrail's operations giving both rail systems access into the Northeast. While the final plan is not yet completed, I believe that the negotiations will produce enhanced competition--especially in the area north of Virginia. Two strong railroads serving industry and agriculture East of the Mississippi ultimately will benefit shippers and consumers alike throughout the region and the nation. We, in Virginia, have a particular interest in this process and have paid great attention to the unfolding events of the last five months involving Conrail, which, as you know, is the overwhelming rail presence in the Northeast; and CSX and Norfolk Southern which provide service throughout the mid- Atlantic and Southeast. Both Norfolk Southern and CSX are corporate citizens of the Commonwealth, with 8,000 employees and 3,300 miles of rail lines in the state. The thousands of businesses and industries in Virginia that depend on our railroads--including coal, paper and chemicals--are looking for faster, more efficient, direct rail service into the vast consumer markets of the Northeast. Our ports want to strengthen their global reach through improved north-south intermodal networks. The solution that is being devised, I believe, promises to satisfy those goals. I would hope that we in Congress would allow those discussions to come to completion, and not attempt to write the operating plan ourselves. Mr. Chairman, I would like to call attention to the fact that Congress wisely has created an independent, quasi-judicial agency to evaluate the public interest in transactions of this nature, the Surface Transportation Board. The STB must provide a forum for all interests--including employees, communities and shippers--affected by this transaction to be heard. With that venue available to us, I believe that there is an appropriate process in place to address the valid concerns that can be expected from an undertaking of this magnitude. NEXTEA Program Senator Shelby. Senator Warner, we appreciate you taking your time to testify today, we know it is very important to you, as it is to us. I know how busy you are working on the reauthorization of the bill for the ISTEA, or as the administration has called it, NEXTEA program. While you are here, do you have any comments for us on how the NEXTEA program might affect rail freight and intermodal shipments? Do you anticipate that the new legislation will cover these areas? Senator Warner. Mr. Chairman, the anticipated legislation will cover these areas, but I assure you, time does not permit me the opportunity to cover that together with your colleagues. I assure you that I will work carefully. The distinguished Senator to your right is on our committee, takes a very active interest, and we have gone toe to toe, and I hope on this one we go arm and arm. Thank you very much. Senator Shelby. Any other questions? Senator Lautenberg. Senator Lautenberg. I have no questions of our colleague. We share a common interest. We are linked together by the rails, and we want to make sure that it is operating. We are willing to compete on a fair and equitable basis, we need the tools to do it with, and this could very well provide it. Senator Shelby. Senator Specter. Senator Specter. I do not know if I have any questions, but a comment or two. On the Marquis of Queensberry rules, I quite agree with you that they do not play that way overseas, but I just want to be sure that domestically we do serve the Marquis of Queensberry rules. I do not want to get into the ring with these contestants or pugilists, but there may be some appropriate stance for a referee. A kind of microscope, which I think is appropriate for us to put on here may have some impact as to how it will all be worked out, but it has to be worked out between the parties, I agree with you totally. And it is very much a national picture; it is a matter for America's consumers, principally, as they benefit from reduced shipping rates, but the employees and the communities also have standing. I am fascinated to know that Norfolk Southern has worked out an arrangement with Pennsylvania Power & Light Co., which benefits the upstate coal producers of Pennsylvania, and that was worked out in the context of the litigation, which was underway, so that the parties here are very sensitive to the communities, and to the employees, and to the consumers, and I would like to keep that sensitivity at a high level. Thank you. Senator Shelby. Senator Mikulski. Senator Mikulski. I have no questions of Senator Warner. I do not know about the Marquis of Queensberry rules, but I do know that I will not throw in the towel when it comes to competing with Norfolk. Senator Shelby. Senator Warner, thank you. Senator Warner. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Senator Shelby. Our next panel, we will have the Honorable Parris Glendening, Governor of the State of Maryland, the Honorable Ed Rendell, Mayor of the city of Philadelphia, the Honorable Brad Mallory, Secretary of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania Department of Transportation, and the Honorable John Haley, Secretary of the State of New Jersey Department of Transportation, if all of you would come to the table. Governor, if you would start the panel, your complete written statement, all of you, will be made part of the record in its entirety, and if you will sum up in 5 minutes or less what you want to tell us, it gives us some time to get in. Thank you, Governor. Statement of Governor Glendening Mr. Glendening. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I am Parris Glendening, the Governor of the State of Maryland, and I appreciate your efforts and the committee members' efforts. Let me give special appreciation to Senator Mikulski, who has been doing such a wonderful job for us, overall, and particularly on this issue, where she has brought our entire congressional delegation together on a bipartisan basis, so that we speak with one voice. I appreciate the opportunity to speak briefly about the current situation regarding Conrail, CSX, and Norfolk Southern. We have introduced a detailed statement. For just about one-half of a year we have worked together to protect our State's interest. Many people came together early in the process, we identified clear objectives, and spoke with one voice for the common good of our State. I am very proud of the efforts of Maryland's business community, and rail community, commuters, businesses throughout the State, the coal mining industry, all to work with elected officials so that we could make sure that all the issues were addressed. From early indications it seems that this merger is, indeed, getting on the right track for Maryland, but I must tell you, we are not at the station yet. Let me speak just briefly about three issues here today that we identified, the implications for the rail merger, what these implications are for our State, and where we stand in light of recent events. In terms of identifying the issues, we understood that this merger is clearly a private business decision, but it was up to our team to protect the railworkers in Maryland who were concerned about the loss of jobs, to speak out on behalf of the commuters who depend on our commuter system, as is the case in New Jersey, to get to and from work, to ensure that businesses across the State would have the railroads to get their products to market, to be kept at competitive rates, and this ranged from our concern about the Port of Baltimore, to the coal fields in western Maryland. The merger is about real people, that is why Senator Mikulski and I, and others, are so concerned and involved about this. After the merger was announced we convened forums of business leaders and labor leaders throughout the State, we held dozens of meetings that involved hundreds of people, and briefed leaders from across Maryland, we appointed a railway merger advisory council, and we initiated repeated personal communications with the CEO's and other representatives of all three railroads. For Maryland, the primary issues were to preserve competitive service by two class I railroads, to assure class I carriers give access to a full customer base, to secure commitments to competitive rates and services, it would have no significant job reductions for Maryland, and would secure commitments to infrastructure improvements, and preserve and enhance our commuter rail service. Again, we recognize that this merger is a business decision, but the public good must not be overlooked. The railroads and services that they offer are critical elements of our State's economic health. Everyone, business, labor, and all levels of elected officials, agreed that we must unite and speak with one clear voice about these goals. With regard to the current situation, Maryland has had a long relationship with CSX, and we are ready to welcome Norfolk Southern to Maryland. We are excited about the prospect of building a dynamic partnership with Norfolk Southern. We are optimistic, but there are still some concerns that must be met. It appears that two successful class I railroads will continue to serve our State. We are pleased to announce, in fact, that in Cumberland, and elsewhere in Maryland, it appears that our jobs will be protected, and commitments to infrastructure improvements are being presented, but it is important to note that this is not a full endorsement. Until all the details of the proposals are on the table, and can be reviewed, critical questions remain, questions regarding freight service, congestion, regional competition, job protection, and other issues. We are interested, for example, in having a level playing field for our business community. We are concerned with our coal fields in western Maryland, that if they continue to operate only with one class I railroad, and two class I railroads are open for other fields, will we be at a competitive disadvantage. In closing I would note, Mr. Chairman, that Maryland's approach to this merger has been somewhat unprecedented and unparalleled. We organized very early, we clearly defined our objectives, and we presented a unified front of elected officials, business, labor, and community leaders. The final decision is up to the Surface Transportation Board, but I will remind everyone, as we know well, that it will impact literally thousands of citizens in Maryland alone, and tens of thousands of citizens throughout the corridor. We have been fair and forthcoming with all three railroads, we have worked hard to speak for our citizens, and we will continue to speak for Maryland until the last I is dotted and the last T is crossed. What we are seeking is an enforceable agreement that incorporates into the final surface transportation approval document of the issues that we have raised, and the preliminary consensus that we have reached with Norfolk Southern and CSX. Prepared Statement I thank you for the opportunity to share our approach to this issue before the committee here, and appreciate your time. Senator Shelby. Thank you, Governor. [The statement follows:] Prepared Statement of Parris N. Glendening Thank you Mr. Chairman, members of the Committee, and of course, my Senator, Barbara Mikulski, for giving me the opportunity to testify before the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation regarding the implications of the proposed acquisition of the Consolidated Rail Corporation by CSX Corporation, and the associated agreements with Norfolk Southern Corporation. First, I personally thank Senator Barbara Mikulski who has been a tireless advocate for Maryland on this merger. I appreciate all that you, Senator Sarbanes, and the Maryland Congressional Delegation have done for our State, on this and so many issues that affect the lives of our citizens. Mr. Chairman, I very much wanted to be here today to talk about this merger because of what it means for the future of railroads in Maryland. Additionally, I will speak of the pursuit of Maryland's leadership in advancing the state's interests and objectives concerning the merger. For the past six months, we have worked tirelessly to protect our State's interests. We are here today because so many people, many of whom are here today--business owners, community leaders, union officials and the transportation community--came together early, identified clear, achievable objectives and spoke with one voice for the common good of our State. I know that the reason that we are here today is because of the unparalleled, early, intense and unified effort we began nearly six months ago. Although the Surface Transportation Board has the final say, we hope that Maryland's leadership on this rail merger will be seen as a model of how one state can make a difference. From early indications, it seems that this merger is heading down the right track for Maryland but we are not in the station yet. I will speak briefly about three issues today: First, how Maryland identified the implications of the rail merger for our State; second, what those implications are; and third, where I think we stand in light of recent events. process for identifying the issues When we first learned of the proposed merger, we immediately contacted the railroads to express our concerns about the possible loss of competition for Maryland businesses and customers, as well as effects on commuter rail service in Maryland. We knew that we had to act quickly and decisively because Maryland is now served primarily by CSX and Conrail. Therefore, any straight forward merger of these two corporations would have left our State and the Port of Baltimore at a competitive disadvantage by being served only by one major Class I railroad. We were also concerned about the future of Maryland's successful commuter rail system which operates on tracks owned by CSX as well as on the Amtrak Northeast Corridor. Early on, we decided that while the ultimate decision about whether to complete this merger was a private business decision, it was up to our team to protect the rail workers in Maryland, who told us that they were worried about whether they would still have jobs. It was up to us to speak out on behalf of the commuters in the Washington metro area who depend on the MARC commuter rail system to get to work, and it was up to us to ensure that the small produce shippers in Anne Arundel County, the sand and gravel operators in Southern Maryland, manufacturers in Baltimore and Montgomery Counties and poultry growers on the Eastern Shore, all of whom rely on the railroads to get their products to market, did not lose competitive rates or suffer declines in service. As you know, Mr. Chairman, this merger is not simply about rails and box cars, it is about real people and real businesses whose survival depends upon the outcome of this merger. That is why I got involved in this process. That is why we reached out to railworkers, to the business community and to affected rail customers to develop a package that reflected their interests and concerns. And, Mr. Chairman, that is why I am here today. We knew that we only had two real opportunities to affect the outcome of this merger: First, we had to negotiate directly with the railroads in hopes of influencing the development of their operating plans; second, we had to prepare to participate in the federal Surface Transportation Board proceedings. We believed that Maryland had to pursue both avenues in order to protect the State's interests. In doing so, we used a three-pronged strategy: --First, we initiated direct and ongoing negotiations with the railroads to seek mutually acceptable goals and conditions; --Second, we worked to focus public attention on Maryland's concerns about the proposed merger; and --Third, we prepared for proceedings at the Surface Transportation Board by collecting information to make our case. Just two weeks after the merger was announced, on October 30, 1996, we convened a forum for business and labor leaders from across the State. Representatives from many sectors of business and industry in Maryland participated in the forum, including port shippers, freight handlers, aggregates, rail labor, longshoremen, coal, poultry, commuter rail citizen groups, business organizations as well as federal, state and local elected officials. The turnout was an obvious indication of how serious and far reaching the merger issue was for Maryland. In this, and literally dozens of other meetings, we briefed leaders from across Maryland on what we knew at the time, as well as on the process for the merger proposals to move forward. Most importantly, we were able to begin a dialogue to identify the most critical issues of concern to Maryland. We did not stop at the forum. We reached out to more than 800 business and community leaders in Maryland, as well as to shippers located outside of Maryland who send rail traffic through our State, to seek their views and concerns regarding the proposed merger. In November 1996, I appointed a fourteen member private sector Railroad Merger Advisory Council to work closely with the me in identifying the key issues, developing our negotiating strategy, and providing information. All of this information was used to identify our primary concerns about the merger. At the same time, we initiated repeated personal communications with the CEO's and other representatives of all three railroads, and I talked to Senator Mikulski and other members of our Congressional Delegation regularly about the merger. We also established an interagency merger team of outside experts in freight and commuter rail issues, and senior level officials from our Departments of Transportation and Business and Economic Development. This team still meets regularly to coordinate information obtained from discussions with the railroads together with that provided by Maryland businesses, elected officials, and citizens. Throughout this process, we have remained in constant and close contact with members of our Congressional Delegation as well. I am convinced that the fact that the State, our Congressional Delegation, the General Assembly, business, labor and community leaders came together with one voice for Maryland made a difference in the future of our State, and I am grateful for the efforts of everyone involved. implications and concerns of the merger proposals By speaking with one voice, Maryland has sent a clear message to all three railroads. This comprehensive outreach process also enabled the Maryland team to share our key concerns with the railroads early in the process--by December. For Maryland, the primary issues were: Preserve competitive service by two class I railroads.--In order to preserve the value of competition in the both the Port of Baltimore and Maryland overall, our State must have comparable rail service available from a true competitor to a merged CSX/Conrail--that is, another Class I railroad with similar market reach. Assure that Class I carriers give access to a full customer base.-- We understand that for two major carriers to have a real presence, they must have access to an adequate base of customers to make business worth while. Secure commitments to competitive rates and service.--Any rail service must offer rates and service that are competitive. Businesses were concerned that changes in pricing policy could have negative impacts on their success. No significant job reductions for Maryland.--Maryland currently has over 2,000 employees directly employed by the railroads. As in every state, we were very concerned that consolidation could lead to a loss of employment. We were also concerned about the loss of collateral jobs. Secure commitments to infrastructure improvements.--The various merger proposals have described benefits that would occur due to additional service. In most cases, this will necessitate improvements to tracks, bridges or clearances, such as double-stack improvements at Perryville, Maryland. We needed to be sure that each railroad is committed to providing funds for these improvements. Preserve and enhance MARC Commuter Rail Service.--As mentioned, Maryland has a very successful commuter rail service to both the Washington and Baltimore metropolitan areas. We currently operate 80 commuter trains a day. This service involves rails owned by CSX as well as Amtrak. We wanted assurances that any changes in freight traffic will not have a negative effect on the hours of service to our commuters or on the safety of such operations. We pursued these issues with the railroads at every step of the way. After the three railroads began to work together in January, I contacted all three CEO's and the Surface Transportation Board and urged them to enter into equitable discussions of the competitive issues at stake. We believed that a more balanced solution existed. While we understand this merger is primarily a business decision, the public good must not be overlooked. The railroads and the services they can offer are a critical element of each state's economic health. In Maryland, we are proud of the choices we offer businesses that come to our State. This merger held the potential of taking that valuable asset--a choice between competitors--away from us. Everyone--business, labor, and all levels of elected officials--agreed we must unite and speak with one clear voice about what had to result from the merger from Maryland's perspective. current situation Mr. Chairman, nearly six months after the merger was announced, we are excited about the future of railroading in Maryland. Our State has enjoyed a rich railroad tradition. The United States' first railroad, the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, was started in Baltimore in 1828 and we understand the vital importance of having good rail service. Maryland has had a long relationship with CSX, which grew out of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, and we look forward to continuing and strengthening that relationship. We now are ready to welcome Norfolk Southern to Maryland. Norfolk Southern has worked closely with us throughout this process to address our concerns and needs. We are excited about the prospect of building a dynamic partnership with Norfolk Southern, which has a well-deserved reputation for safety, service and satisfaction throughout the railroad industry. While we are optimistic about the future, my presence here today should not be interpreted as an endorsement for the current proposals under discussion. Because the railroad operating plans are still not available for review, we truly do not know if our issues have been adequately and explicitly addressed. The old adage is true--``the devil is in the details.'' We are pleased that the railroads are working together to devise a solution. We strongly agree with the Surface Transportation Board's Chairperson, Linda Morgan; it is best if the industry can sort most of these issues out before coming to the Board. Based on the limited information available so far, we are encouraged that most of our concerns were met: --It appears that two successful Class I railroads will continue to serve our Maryland; --We are pleased to announce that jobs in Cumberland and elsewhere in Maryland will be protected; and --Commitments to funding infrastructure improvements are being presented. Until all of the details of the proposals are on the table and can be reviewed, however, critical questions remain. --For example, how will Norfolk Southern operate its freight service on the Northeast Corridor? The congested Corridor has presented problems to Conrail in the past--we hope that Norfolk Southern will do better. Is there a better solution on which the railroads can agree? --Will these operating plans present a new imbalance of competition between regions by providing for new open access in some areas but not in others? For example, we understand that there will be open access to all customers to the Port of New York and New Jersey, but not to Baltimore. We also understand that coal mines in Pennsylvania will be open to competition, but that coal mines in Maryland will not have the same access. These inadequacies must be addressed. Will those decisions put Maryland or others at a new competitive disadvantage? --What jobs will be protected and what jobs will not? Clearly, this is an evolutionary process. The effect of restructuring the railroads serving our country will extend far into the next century. The issues are complex and the committee is correct in calling attention to this transaction. To date, Maryland has had reasonably good experiences with all three railroads. We have not favored one over the other. The process and outcomes have taken many unexpected turns and twists along the way. We look forward to seeing Maryland's concerns--especially the need for competition--addressed in the operating plans submitted to the Surface Transportation Board. No decision is final until there is an enforceable final document reviewed by the Board, and the Board renders its decision. Based on input from literally hundreds of people in Maryland, I know that this decision is critical. Mr. Chairman, the message I am bringing today is one I have heard repeatedly over the last six months. This decision will affect the lives, the well being and the health of hundreds of businesses and thousands of individuals across Maryland and across the nation. Unfortunately, corporate restructurings in order to achieve the desired efficiencies and cost reductions often result in consolidation and job loss. We must work to see to it that this pain is minimized in Maryland and elsewhere. closing remarks Mr. Chairman, Maryland's approach to this merger has been unprecedented and unparalleled. It appears that our strategy of getting organized early, defining clear objectives and creating a unified front of elected officials, businesses, labor and community leaders to advance Maryland's interests has made the railroads recognize and address our concerns. We have been fair and forthcoming with all three railroads. We have worked hard to speak for our citizens, and we will continue to speak up for Maryland until the last ``I'' is dotted and the last ``T'' is crossed. I again thank Senator Barbara Mikulski and the Maryland delegation for its support of all our endeavors in this area. Thank you for the opportunity to share our approach to this issue and Maryland's concerns with the Committee. STATEMENT OF HON. ED RENDELL, MAYOR, CITY OF PHILADELPHIA Senator Shelby. Mayor Rendell. Mr. Rendell. Thank you, Senator, and we would like to start off by thanking Senator Specter for asking for these hearings. He is dogged in the protection of Pennsylvania's interest and Philadelphia's interests, and we view these hearings as an important step in that direction. I would like to start out by telling you briefly what the city of Philadelphia stands to lose if this merger is not conducted in a proper and appropriate fashion. The city of Philadelphia right now has 2,300 Conrail employees. As was stated earlier, they produce $7 million in wage taxes, and nearly $12 million from Conrail in overall direct taxes to the city of Philadelphia's treasury. Indirectly, Conrail produces well over $100 million in economic impact for the city of Philadelphia. Conrail is one of our leading corporate presences. It delivers as a great corporate citizen, and it has delivered over the last decade between $2 million and $2.5 million to charitable and civic organizations in the city of Philadelphia on an annual basis. It is one of the largest land holders, property holders, in the city of Philadelphia. Conrail had made a commitment, which was as yet unrealized, to develop an intermodal transportation center, taking advantage of the confluence of our port, I-95, and our western highway hookups, which we believe would be one of the outstanding intermodal transportation facilities in the eastern half of the country. So all of those things we stand to lose if this merger is not done in an appropriate fashion. We also need to maintain many of these things, and I would suggest, and I do not mean to in any way denigrate Maryland's interests, or Virginia's interests, or any other State's interests, certainly New Jersey's, or any other State's interests, but the city of Philadelphia has, as you know, a historical special relationship with Conrail. When the Congress enacted the original legislation, Conrail legislation in 1973, Philadelphia was written into that legislation for a guarantee that the corporate headquarters of Conrail would remain there. Senator Vance Hartke, back in 1973, said this was done so its headquarters in Philadelphia would guarantee maximum reemployment opportunities for office workers of the two defunct carriers. In 1986, when the effort was made, and successfully made to privatize Conrail, again, this Congress not only held that subsection when it amended out many other provisions of the 1973 act, this Congress not only held that subsection, but actually passed another subsection, making clear that that subsection 741(b) would remain in effect. So we have a historical relationship to this whole chain, recognizing Philadelphia and Pennsylvania's importance as a great railroad State and a great railroad city. We need to maintain strong operating commitments of both major facilities, Norfolk Southern and CSX, and I was heartened to read in John Snow's letter to Senator Specter a commitment to have a major operating presence in the city of Philadelphia, and I would emphasize the word, major. It is my understanding that the negotiations which, of course, are not finalized, it is my understanding that those negotiations will give Norfolk Southern almost all of the existing Conrail property in the city of Philadelphia. It is our strong belief that that justifies a significant major operating presence in Philadelphia of Norfolk Southern. With Norfolk Southern coming into the North, we strongly believe that Philadelphia should receive the same treatment as Atlanta, as an operating headquarters for Norfolk Southern. Between those two strong operating presences, the jobs that the Congress sought to protect in 1973, and reprotect in 1986, will, in fact, be maintained or even grow. We also believe that both Norfolk Southern and Conrail working together should take steps to ensure the economic development of our region by fulfilling Conrail's promise to develop that intermodal facility. The city of Philadelphia knows that it has to participate and incentivize those efforts with land and other economic development incentives, and we stand ready to do so, and most of all, we need competition. As Governor Glendening said about western Maryland, we need competition. Today, outside of our port area and some intermodal facilities in south Philadelphia, there is no head-to-head class I rail competition in southeastern Pennsylvania, and that has a definite damaging effect on southeastern Pennsylvania companies. When this is done, it is crucial that that type of head-to- head competition be maintained, either by the establishment of a neutral terminal railroad, or by an agreement of the parties, a holding company, to do some form of--holding company that ensures equal access and head-to-head competition. Last, we would like to see, of course, the corporate presence, some trust fund established to keep the corporate presence, and a real estate task force to look at the real estate. Let me close by saying that this past Monday, Governor Ridge, in Harrisburg, myself, and Secretary Mallory met with John Snow and David Goode, and I think it was a terrific meeting. It was a terrific meeting. We agreed to set up a working group, a small working group, with the governments of Pennsylvania and Philadelphia, the Port of Philadelphia represented, with all three railroads, counting Conrail as well. That working group is going to move quickly in the next 2 weeks to begin the process of sorting out all of these issues, and it is our availability, obviously, and our intention to be available to share our progress with the Congress, and, of course, eventually with the Surface Transportation Board. Mr. Snow's and Mr. Goode's attitude toward our needs as a State, I think, was extraordinarily positive, and we are looking forward to a great working relationship. Senator Shelby. Thank you, Mayor. Mr. Brad Mallory, Secretary of the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation. STATEMENT OF HON. BRAD MALLORY, SECRETARY, COMMONWEALTH OF PENNSYLVANIA DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Mr. Mallory. Thank you, sir, and thank you all for the opportunity to share the views of the administration of Gov. Tom Ridge concerning the proposal to divide Conrail between CSX and Norfolk Southern, obviously a matter of utmost importance, not only to Pennsylvania, but to the rail industry and the economy of the Northeast and the Nation beyond. We must all work together to ensure that our employers, our communities, our workers, and for that matter, our thriving rail industry in Pennsylvania, can all find a way to benefit and prosper out of this transaction. The Governor said it clearly on Monday, in Pennsylvania, we in government can be helpful allies or formidable adversaries, depending on whether or not our legitimate interests are met. Pennsylvania, with 70 railroads, ranks first in the Nation in the number of operating railroads, and with 5,400 miles of track, fifth in the Nation in terms of mileage of railroads. One-third of all the U.S. rail traffic in the Nation moves through the Keystone State, not incoincidentally. Railroad employment in the State totals nearly 13,000 workers, the third highest totals in the Nation. Obviously, we take the rail industry in Pennsylvania very seriously. The latest developments, obviously, would indicate that CSX and Norfolk Southern will be dividing up Conrail's lines. We know that rail service will change dramatically in the area, and the Ridge administration is working diligently to ensure that the needs of Pennsylvania are, in fact, protected. As Mayor Rendell mentioned, on Monday of this week, the Governor, Mayor Rendell, and I, and others met with the CEO's of CSX and Norfolk Southern to formally establish a working group, as to the disposition of the old Conrail freight lines, and the operation of them. Now, I stress formally established a working group, because the Governor and I have met individually with Messrs. Levan, Goode, and Snow, as early as November and December of last year, and we, of course, had been working aggressively with rail shipping interests, rail unions, communities, and I might add, and stressed the port communities throughout Pennsylvania, Deep Water, in Philadelphia, Inland, in Pittsburgh, and Great Lakes Port, in Lake Erie, from the onset of this issue. CSX and Norfolk Southern believe that within 1 to 2 weeks they will have put a little more ink on their arrangement, and will be able to join with us in aggressively pursuing a menu of issues that the Governor, and the mayor, and others in Pennsylvania believe must be addressed. First and foremost, employment, a major concern. Current employment levels and rail facility operations must be protected to the maximum extent possible. The indications are very promising, based on our discussions to date, concerning the railroad repair shops in Altoona and Hollidaysburg, the National Regional Customer Center and regional headquarters in Pittsburgh, and the intermodal facilities in Pittsburgh, Harrisburg, Philadelphia, and Allentown, as well. As the mayor mentioned, Philadelphia has a historic role as a rail corporate headquarters for more than a century, and consideration must be given to the maximum ongoing corporate presence in that city. Conrail has made a great economic impact in our State, especially in Philadelphia. Over 2,400 people are employed just there, 8,000 people throughout the State, $31 million in State and local taxes, as Senator Specter mentioned. They also purchase more than 439 million dollars' worth of goods and services from Pennsylvania vendors, and I might add, contributed more than $2 million to over 200 charities, community groups, and other deserving nonprofit corporations of Pennsylvania. This is a presence that matters. The second major issue, competitive access. It is imperative that all 2-to-1 locations be maintained. For example, where Conrail is currently permitting another major carrier to use one of its lines, the successor owner must continue to afford access. At least three major carriers must be granted access to the Port of Philadelphia, as we enjoy today, and in the case of Pittsburgh, we must maintain the level of two major railroads having access. We need to retain our two competitive east-west routes and two competitive north-south routes. Major rail carriers must provide competitive access to our large regional and shortline railroad industry, the largest in the Nation, I might add. Passenger service is of a particular interest to us, obviously. It must be addressed in the merger, and we will be seeking a commitment from all the involved class I's to work with us on expanding rail passenger service, where it makes sense to do so. Obviously, the dollars are important, and fair and competitive transportation rates and charges are going to have to be addressed. If transportation efficiencies are realized as part of this deal, we must have some passed through to the customers. Finally, plans to dispose of rail lines should be made known to the Commonwealth as soon as possible. We need about 60 to 90 days prior notice, and the rationalized lines, if you will, must be offered at a reasonable minimum cost. If this merger is structured correctly, that is a big if, but if it is, Pennsylvania could have good connections and good routes to Chicago, St. Louis, Memphis, New Orleans, and give Pennsylvania products a new and more competitive market reach to the south, and ultimately to the west. Our goal, our task, is to ensure that through face-to-face hard bargaining, that we achieve that, and we greatly appreciate the interest of you gentlemen, and the chance that you can help us provide the leverage to make sure that that process works in that fashion. Thank you. Prepared Statement Senator Shelby. Thank you, Mr. Mallory. We have your complete statement and it will be inserted in the record. [The statement follows:] Prepared Statement of Bradley L. Mallory Good morning and thank you for allowing me to share the views of the administration of Gov. Tom Ridge on the proposal to divide Conrail between CSX and Norfolk Southern. It is a matter of utmost importance that we are discussing here today. The impact of this proposed restructuring of Conrail will determine how railroads will operate well into the 21st century--not just in Pennsylvania, but ultimately in the entire country as well. Those of us in government must join with those in the private sector to ensure that a merger will be in the best interest of our economy, our workers, and all of our railroads. We in government can be helpful allies or formidable adversaries depending on whether our legitimate needs are met. Railroads have a rich heritage in leading the growth and development of the Commonwealth. In February 1854, the Pennsylvania Railroad began operating a through route between Philadelphia and Pittsburgh--opening a new chapter in the nation's and Commonwealth's transportation history. Those cross-state ribbons of iron allowed trains to transport coal, lumber, other raw materials and finished products to factories and the marketplace. Towns sprang up around the railroad. Businesses emerged. Jobs were created. Railroads were the economic lifeblood of the Commonwealth. While the ``glory days'' of railroading may be gone--the ``working days'' of trains are not. Railroads will continue to play a key role in the economic well-being of Pennsylvania. That is why the Ridge Administration and those of us in the Department of Transportation are committed to working with the merger partners to protect Pennsylvania's interests in this latest transformation of the eastern rail industry. Maintaining a viable rail system serving Pennsylvania and beyond is important. My vision is to create--as Governor Ridge has directed--a multi-modal transportation system throughout the state . . . one that combines the use of our highways and waterways, airways and bikeways and, of course, our railways. This is the only way to move people and goods efficiently and effectively. Highways cannot serve as our sole means of transportation. To be prepared for tomorrow's global demands, a blend of all transportation modes must be developed . . . and rail must be a part of the total transportation mix. In fact, many of our shippers, including coal, chemicals and lumber, are dependent on our rail network to move their commodities. The state recognized the importance of rail by investing $35 million in infrastructure improvements to permit doublestack container shipments across the Commonwealth, a crucial development to keep Pennsylvania and its employers competitive in the world marketplace. Today, with 70 railroads, Pennsylvania ranks first in the nation in the number of operating railroads and, with 5,400 miles of track, the state ranks fifth in track mileage. One- third of all U.S. rail traffic moves through Pennsylvania-- befitting our status as the Keystone State. Railroad employment in the state totals nearly 13,000 workers, the third highest in the nation. These numbers tell the story of railroads' role in Pennsylvania. And any plan that would restructure rail freight service from the Northeast to the deep South is going to affect the Commonwealth, its other railroads and those in business and industry who rely on trains to deliver raw materials or move completed products to market. The latest developments indicate CSX and Norfolk Southern will be dividing up Conrail's lines. We also know that rail transportation in Conrail's service area will change, perhaps dramatically. At the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation, we are working diligently to ensure that the needs of Pennsylvania and its employers are protected. On Monday of this week (March 17), Governor Ridge, Philadelphia Mayor Edward Rendell and I met with the CEO's of CSX and Norfolk Southern to formally open lines of communications between Pennsylvania and the new owners of the old Conrail freight lines. Substantive issues cannot be resolved with one meeting. We have been talking with the railroads all along. But now we have agreed to establish a formal working group--one that will convene within the next two weeks to sit down and hammer out the tough issues facing our state's economy, worried Conrail workers and the railroads. On behalf of the Ridge Administration, I am anxious to open discussions with the other members of the working group which includes a representative from the City of Philadelphia, the chairman of the Delaware River Port Authority, the governor's general counsel, a member of Conrail's interim management team, and a representative from both CSX and Norfolk Southern. This small group of individuals has the monumental task of coming to terms, reaching agreement and compromising, where necessary, on the key issues and concerns facing the Commonwealth, so that we can all support the operational plan that the railroads will submit to the Surface Transportation Board for final approval. Since the issue first arose last October, the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation has been assessing the impact of the sale of Conrail. I would like to outline for you those concerns that I will bring to our working group. Employment. Employment is a major concern. Current employment levels and rail facilities' operations must be protected to the maximum extent possible. I'm referring to the railroad repair shops in Altoona and Hollidaysburg, the national regional customer center and regional headquarters in Pittsburgh and the intermodal facilities in Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Harrisburg and Allentown. In addition, Philadelphia has served as a rail corporate headquarters for more than a century and consideration must be given to an ongoing corporate presence in the state's largest city. Conrail has made a great economic impact in our state and especially in the Philadelphia region where approximately 2,400 people are employed. Conrail employed approximately 8,000 people in Pennsylvania last year. In 1995, Conrail paid more than $31 million in state and local taxes in Pennsylvania and purchased more than $439 million in goods and services from Pennsylvania vendors. Conrail also contributed more than $2 million to over 200 charities, community groups and other deserving non-profit organizations in the state in 1995. All told, Conrail's presence has mattered in Pennsylvania. Competitive access is critical for our rail users. It is imperative that all ``two-to-one'' locations be maintained. For example, where Conrail is currently permitting another major carrier to use one of its lines, the successor owner must continue to afford access to that rail line to the other major carrier. At least three major carriers must he granted access to the Port of Philadelphia, and in the case of Pittsburgh's port operations, a minimum of two major railroads must be maintained. The Commonwealth will need to retain two, competitive east- west routes and two, competitive north-south routes within the State. Major rail carriers must provide competitive access to the regional and shortline railroads. This can be attained through trackage rights agreements or through reciprocal switch/local access. Passenger service is another area that should be addressed with this merger. We will be seeking a commitment from all the involved Class I lines to work with us on expanding rail passenger service onto existing freight lines where it makes sense to do so. Fair and competitive transportation rates and charges in some cases should be frozen or guaranteed to rail users, such as coal companies and bulk chemical producers who are solely dependent on railroads for moving their products. If transportation efficiencies are realized as a result of any merger, consideration must be given to passing some cost savings on to the customers. We have done much to keep Pennsylvania businesses more competitive. We need to keep transportation rates low to assist in this effort. Recognized customer service standards and good corporate citizenry are essential to ensure reliable and efficient freight service. Rail users and major carriers should meet on a regular basis to assess service. And the railroads should commit to local and state officials to properly dispose of bridges, facilities and land parcels when rail lines and yards are abandoned. And finally, plans to dispose of rail lines, including associated real estate and parcels of land, should be made known to the Commonwealth as soon as possible. This notification should come at least 60 to 90 days prior to the railroad's filing for abandonment. Also, the major carriers should offer future ``rationalized'' lines to our regional and shortline railroads at a reasonable, minimum cost. Pennsylvania has a healthy rail network today . . . a network that is vital to the Commonwealth's economic growth. For five months, my staff has talked with shippers, shortline and regional railroad operators, representatives of our ports and officials from the city of Philadelphia and our major Metropolitan Planning Organizations. The Ridge Administration also has maintained positive relations with all parties to this proposed merger, and we believe we are well- positioned to be a player in the merger's final design. If the merger is structured correctly, Pennsylvania could have good connections and good routes to Chicago, St. Louis, Memphis and New Orleans. This could give Pennsylvania products a ``new'' and more competitive market reach to the south and ultimately to the west. But we must emphasize that the Ridge administration will work hard to represent the state's interests as this merger develops. We have been and will continue to work together in designing a rail network for the future--a system that will be part of the world class transportation network that is vital for Pennsylvania. Thank you. STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN J. HALEY, JR., SECRETARY, STATE OF NEW JERSEY DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Senator Shelby. Next will be the Honorable John Haley, Secretary of the Department of Transportation, the State of New Jersey. Mr. Haley. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Senator Lautenberg, Senator Specter. I will enter into the record my formal testimony as well as a tactical study that was prepared at our direction on the impact. And I will briefly comment to say that with New Jersey located literally in the heart of the largest market in the United States, 100 million customers are within 1 day's travel of New Jersey, and really it is one of the largest markets in the world, and to stress simply that this proposed merger is of critical importance for New Jersey, not just as a transportation merger, but as an economy, because our economy and the State, to a great extent, is organized around the distribution and movements of goods, both in and out of the States. As many of our other speakers have said, at Governor Whitman's direction we have developed a series of principles against which any merger must be measured, and I would like to share with you those principles this morning. First of all, as you have heard the prior speakers indicate, we need assurance that New Jersey will have competitive rail access by at least two class I rail carriers, each with access to their own viable terminals, and access via a reciprocal switching or terminal railroad operation to all industries in the State. As I do not have to tell anybody here, it appears that the monopoly that Conrail has enjoyed over the last 20 years will be going away, and we need to make sure that we have real and viable competitive access. The second principle is that we need access for all 12 New Jersey shortline rail carriers. Like Pennsylvania, small railroads provide a critical need and service to the economy in New Jersey, they have literally picked up and grown over the last several years, areas and businesses that are not served for a number of legitimate business reasons by Conrail, and they are in lumber, in warehousing, all sorts of industries, so it is very important to us to see that the 12 shortline railroads throughout the State of New Jersey have access to a new arrangement. Third, we are faced with literally, in parts of New Jersey, a traffic jam on the existing rail system. Senator Lautenberg laid out the importance of mass transits in New Jersey, he talked about the need for coexistence, and suffice it to say that we need to underscore that coexistence, not only with commuter and freight in New Jersey, but also with the Northeast corridor, and the intercity system, which is so important to the State of New Jersey, and to the entire region. Any business arrangement must have the ability to deal with the capacity constraint that exists on the railroads throughout New Jersey. Fourth, and this one is particularly important to us as a State with a number of intermodal systems in the North, is that we have improved shipper access to intermodal and carload freight options. A percentage of traffic moving on rail has increased from 2 to 10 percent at the Port Authority of New York, New Jersey, in the last few years. We would like to see continued growth of rail, because not only would it provide for better movement, and open up additional markets, but also will take some trucks off the road, and we need to have a good, compatible system. The fifth principle is that we have reasonable accommodation for workers who may be displaced by this arrangement. We have a number of facilities and employees located throughout the Northeast, and let me add, this is an issue on which we should think regionally, and New Jersey would support the mayor's contention that we should have a very strong corporate presence in Philadelphia. This is important not only to Pennsylvania, but by accidents of geography, we should not let that stand in the way of a joint effort in bringing this important--we have had a similar experience to what Pennsylvania has had in dealing with the two railroads in the proposed merger. Our feeling is that based on the information we have seen, we can feel pretty good about it, but as was indicated earlier, the devil is in the details, and we need to see the specifics, and we will weigh them strongly against our five principles. With that, Mr. Chairman, I would conclude my testimony to say that New Jersey and Governor Whitman intend to remain active, and we will work with the committee and the Surface Transportation Board, and our colleagues on the panel to make sure that we have an effective and smooth transition, and it is in the best interests of all of the economies of our States. Thank you. Prepared Statement Senator Shelby. Thank you, Mr. Haley. We will insert your complete statement in the record. [The statement follows:] Prepared Statement of John J. Haley Chairman Shelby, Senator Lautenberg, Members of the Committee: Mr. Chairman, with your permission I would like to submit for the record a report prepared for the New Jersey Department of Transportation and the North Jersey Transportation Planning Authority with regard to the Conrail/CSX/Norfolk Southern merger. Good morning and thank you for this opportunity to appear and discuss an issue which is of extreme importance to the future economic health of New Jersey. I applaud your initiative in holding these hearings, and assembling all interested parties to discuss what this merger will mean to the States, and to the many industries that rely on rail transportation. First, let me begin with a word as to why this issue is so important to New Jersey. The State is located in the heart of the largest market in the United States (100 million consumers are within 1 day's travel), and one of the largest markets in the world. As a result, a sizable portion of our economy is centered around the distribution of huge quantities of goods within this market, and the transshipment of manufactured and imported goods beyond our Region. The following facts are indicative of the importance of this industry to the State's economy: --Taken as a whole, goods movement employment in New Jersey (rail, truck, port, warehousing, freight forwarding, customs, etc.) makes it our fourth largest industry. --22 percent of New Jersey's work force (600,000 people) are employed in industries which are either directly, or indirectly, impacted by the costs and quality of rail service to the State. --Our geographic position as a corridor State means that 850 million tons of freight, 10 percent of the total annual freight tonnage moved nationwide, originates, terminates or passes through New Jersey. --25 percent of the total revenues earned by Conrail throughout their 11,000 mile system are earned on traffic that originates or terminates right here in New Jersey. Put simply, the Conrail System is very important to New Jersey, but, New Jersey is equally important to the Conrail System. With this in mind, we entered into the process of evaluating the impacts of the Conrail/CSX merger when it was announced in October of last year. We developed a set of principles that we felt served as the basis for any approval by the Surface Transportation Board (STB) of any proposed merger. The principles we insisted serve as the basis for any agreement were: (1) Assurance that New Jersey will have competitive rail access by at least two Class 1 rail carriers, each with access to their own viable terminals, and access via reciprocal switching or terminal railroad operation to all industries in the state. As most of you are aware, Conrail has held a virtual monopoly over rail transportation in NJ and much of the northeast for over 20 years. Competitive rights granted by Congress to the Delaware & Hudson Railroad at that time have never yielded viable competition due to restrictions imposed on the D&H by the trackage rights agreement with Conrail. (2) Access to the competing Class 1 railroads by all of NJ's 12 short line rail carriers. (3) Co-development of intercity, commuter and freight services where shared trackage is necessary. This issue is of vital importance to NJ. Much of our transportation infrastructure, especially in the northeastern part of the State, is at or near capacity. Yet, Conrail freight service operates over every passenger line in New Jersey. In parts of the State our excellent mass transit system, operated by NJ Transit, is all that stands between us and a total breakdown in transportation. Development of new transit services, and expansion of existing services, are critical to our efforts to assure the continued mobility of our citizens, and to our efforts to meet Federal clean air standards. It is largely an issue of capacity constraint. There are areas of shared trackage between NJ Transit and Conrail that even now are straining under the amount of traffic handled daily. This does not take into account the increased levels of traffic projected under the merger scenario. (4) Improved shipper access to intermodal and carload freight options. This includes correction of capacity constraints at NJ rail yard and terminal facilities to avoid the termination of intermodal shipments at the State's border, with subsequent movement of the freight into NJ by motor carrier. Such moves negate the clean air and infrastructure advantages of intermodalism to the State. (5) Reasonable accommodation for workers displaced by merging of facilities and services between carriers, and would further maintain a headquarters presence in the Northeast, particularly Philadelphia. It appears that the revised merger proposal which includes Norfolk Southern as a merger partner with CSX Corporation and Conrail appears to achieve most, if not all, of these points . . . but only in general terms. We need to take the next steps to ensure that the principles will be adhered to and implemented in a satisfactory manner. As one writer put it, ``the devil is in the details''. --Competitive access means different things to different people. We must ensure that all industries have competitive access to the merger partners, and continued access to already existing competitors, such as Canadian Pacific and the New York, Susquehanna & Western Railroads in New Jersey. This will require the creation of neutral terminal carriers in markets where they do not currently exist, or the expansion of rights by short line railroads to interchange with the competitors at central terminal locations. --Southern New Jersey, especially, requires close scrutiny. One of the options suggested to provide competitive access to the short line carriers in this part of the State would extend the existing Philadelphia Belt Line Railway across the Delaware River to Camden. Here it would interchange with yet another short line, RDC, recently selected by Conrail to purchase several lines in New Jersey. This short line, in turn, would interchange with the existing short lines. In this particular case, our zeal to provide competitive access could place as many as two intervening carriers between the short lines and the Class 1's serving the Philadelphia area. --Capacity concerns need to be addressed up front. We must make clear the need to expand lines to accommodate both freight and passenger operations. Rationalization of the system over the years by the railroads has led to decreased capacity at a time when we're seeing a resurgence in rail use by industry, and a demand for many new transit starts. The proposed increases in rail freight as a result of this merger will only serve to increase pressures on available transit assets. --Finally, we need to establish a meaningful corporate headquarters presence in the northeast by both competitors. The Philadelphia headquarters of Conrail must continue to exist as the focal point for marketing and operational activities throughout the northeast. By their own admission, our markets are not markets that have been cultivated in the past by CSX or Norfolk Southern. The most effective marketing is done by people who know their territories intimately. Likewise, customer relations suffer if accounts are serviced by ``absentee'' account representatives who do not know or understand the unique requirements of each customer. In summary, the Northeast's rail freight services must emerge from this process with an improved ability to compete for, and serve, the manufacturing and distribution systems that are vital to our future prosperity. We believe this merger, as proposed, largely furnishes us with this ability. We must, however, see to it that the STB process leaves in place a truly competitive rail system, and positions us for the next round of transcontinental mergers that cannot be far in the future. Thank you Mr. Chairman, Subcommittee Members, ladies and gentlemen. ______ Conrail Merger why this issue is important to new jersey The Conrail merger is the ``window of opportunity'' for NJ to ensure future rail competitive access throughout the State to key strategic markets. NJ, through its maritime and aviation facilities, is a crucial gateway to the global marketplace for U.S. industry. Global is good for NJ. The trick is keeping manufacturing in the U.S. We need transportation logistics to help offset cheap labor overseas. Within this framework, rail freight is critical for the cost- effective movement of goods between the maritime terminals in NJ and business locations throughout the U.S., particularly the midwestern markets. Without effective pricing in rail freight, truck/rail intermodal, and maritime/rail intermodal (``hub port''), key industries in NJ will be at a significant competitive disadvantage compared to other locations in the U.S. and the world. NJ is the heart of the nation's (and one of the world's) largest markets. It is within one day's travel of 100 million consumers. Railroads play a key role in supporting both NJ's industrial base and its consumers. nj's goods movement facts Ten percent of the total annual freight tonnage moved nationwide originates, terminates, or passes through NJ (850 million tons). Goods movement represents NJ's fourth largest industry. Twenty-two percent of NJ's work force are employed in industries which either directly or indirectly are impacted by the cost and quality of rail service to NJ. Twenty-five percent of Conrail's total revenues come from traffic that begins or ends in NJ. Shortlines in NJ often serve shippers previously abandoned by Conrail. Rail moves 11 percent of all containers at the Port Authority of New York & New Jersey, up from just 2 percent five years ago. nj's merger principles Competitive rail access by at least two Class 1 carriers to all key NJ markets. Access to competing Class 1 railroads by 12 shortline carriers. Compatibility of intercity, commuter and freight services for shared track. Improved shipper access to all modes. Reasonable accommodation for displaced workers. Headquarters presence in the Northeast, particularly Philadelphia. Additional capacity to address future rail freight and passenger needs. Intention of Two Carriers to Provide Competition Senator Shelby. Senator Lautenberg, any questions? Senator Lautenberg. Yes. Welcome, Mr. Haley, I am glad to see you here. You have had experience with the port authority as well as now commissioner of transportation. In your opening comments, you suggest that one of the key principles of genuine rail competition is the assurance that each of the class I carriers will have access to their own viable terminals. The question I raised this morning with my staff, at this point, what are your impressions regarding these two carriers, and whether or not they might be able to truly provide that, and from what you have learned so far, is that your intention? Mr. Haley. I will tell you, without question, that both of the carriers that I have talked to understand the problem, and have listened and stated it is their intention to provide competition, particularly in the ports in Elizabeth and Newark. We made clear to them some of our specific concerns regarding capacity and intermodal transfers, both of them understand the need for a terminal facility, and real access, because as you know, and the committee knows, previously, when Conrail was created, part of what was intended was to have competition with lines like Delaware & Hudson; however, as a practical matter, as these business arrangements evolved, the access that Delaware & Hudson had was rather limited, so we ended up with the situation that we have all talked about, which is a Conrail monopoly over the last several years. So in answer to your question, I think that in our discussions with both CSX and Norfolk Southern, they have indicated that they understand the problem for competition, and are working very specifically on it in the ports in Elizabeth and Newark. I will tell you, though, one of the issues that we put on the table, and we have not seen any of the details yet, is we and Governor Whitman are very concerned about what it means for the Port of Camden. In the connections with the important lines in Philadelphia, we have yet to see very much information, and I understand and accept that they are in a negotiating posture, but we are concerned about how the ports in south Jersey and in the Philadelphia area are treated, and how we come out of this. So we are, I guess, Senators, statewide, overall, guardedly optimistic, but we will need some additional information on how exactly the agreements will roll out, and how the lines will shape up before we could give you much more certainty than that. Mr. Rendell. Senator---- Senator Lautenberg. Yes. Mr. Rendell. I am sorry, if I could just reinforce---- Senator Lautenberg. I know, as soon as he said Camden, I saw you twitch there. Mr. Rendell. If I could reinforce what the secretary said, there is no doubt, from our conversations with the two CEO's, there is no doubt that the marketplace and the need for both to be competitive will ensure some type of operation among themselves. The question is, in New Jersey, with the shortlines, and Pennsylvania, with the shortlines, and CP, and the Delaware & Hudson, what access they will have to competitive switching in terminals. That is where the rub is. I think we are absolutely assured that we will have at least two open and head-to-head competitors in Pennsylvania, but there are a lot of other railroads to consider as we go through the details. Senator Lautenberg. Yes; I am encouraged by reports I get from each of the railroads, and I think that this is going to be a net gain for all of us, including, obviously, the carriers. They are not interested in this to spread their responsibilities. They think that is a good investment, and I like to think of things as good investments, they can benefit the communities that are connected or involved with them. So I think that this is a positive thing, but I think it is very important at this early stage to highlight those things which we regard as kind of bedrock importance, so even though I know the leaders of the CSX in Norfolk have been hearing it frequently, I think it is important to get it clearly on the table. Mr. Haley, in your capacity as transportation commissioner, you also serve as chairman of the board of the New Jersey Transit. Now, have you had discussions to date with CSX and Norfolk Southern regarding your requirements for current and expanded computer rail, in connection with the Conrail-owned track in the State of New Jersey? Mr. Haley. We have had, actually, several months of discussions, starting back in October, with the first proposed deal, and talked about specific corridors. In the last 2 weeks I have had discussions with both of the railroads as well, on the needs, particularly on the, I used the term earlier that we have a traffic jam on the rails, but those of us who lived in the Northeast during the phaseout or transition of passenger service at Conrail, when they became entirely a freight railroad, I think will have very long memories, and most of them are not very pleasant about experiences that many of us went through on the passenger rail side, with delays. It is an issue that both of the railroads have been very forthcoming on, and understand the need for this. We have identified particular corridors, such as the Valley Line, such as the Port Service Line that runs between a couple of towns in the New York State border, into Hoboken Terminal, as some key corridors. We have also put on the table the issue of the development of the, further development, I should say, of the Hudson-Bergen line, which needs to be completed on the Hudson part of it, and moved very quickly, and Senator, with your help, again, as you have done with the Hudson part of it, the Hudson-Bergen light rail system as well. That will have many interfaces in the operating area. We have been very frank about the history of troubles, if you will, between passenger and freight railroads operating over the same corridor, and we are looking both for a detailed plan that identifies open windows for freight, and how it will coexist with passengers, as well as some commitment and coordination on the capacity side, because I think, simply, better management of the existing physical plant is one way that will make the railroads coexist more effectively, but there needs to be a well thought out and prudent plan, not only plan, but finances for capacity expansion, because ultimately, if this arrangement leads to what all of us in the Northeast hope it will lead to, there is going to be a need for additional capacity. Senator Shelby. OK. Senator Specter. Senator Specter. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Secretary Mallory, I appreciated your comment quoting Governor Ridge to the effect that the Governor and Pennsylvania could either be helpful allies or formidable adversaries, and I think that is a good division to make. I was referred to in the press recently as threatening lawsuits, which I have not done yet. What I have tried to do is make a point that the new arrangement could have some very beneficial effects to Pennsylvania, as well as the country, but we have to see exactly how it is worked out. The unusual circumstances here, when you have a contract between Conrail and CSX, when a new contract is formed, the initial impression might be, as a matter of law, that there would be nobody to enforce the contract, because Conrail shareholders are delighted with the price that they receive. That is why I made the point that there could be standing as to employees under the Federal law, where the Surface Transportation Board must consider employees, or communities which must be considered under the Pennsylvania takeover statute. When you have characterized the question here as this committee, you used gentlemen, could provide leverage, I think that is really what we are looking toward. Have you been aware of the arrangement which was worked out by Norfolk Southern with Pennsylvania Power & Light, during the course of the last litigation, which was, in effect, a bargaining tool to try to present a good reason for Pennsylvania to be happy with the new arrangement? Mr. Mallory. I believe I became aware of that on or about Monday of this week. Various representatives of the railroad had mentioned to us that we had been working with several Pennsylvania industries, we think we have some good news coming in the near future, and so yes, I became aware of it, I guess, Monday of this week. Senator Specter. Was it your impression that that arrangement had been made, Norfolk Southern with Pennsylvania Power & Light, as a result of the pressure to try to have Norfolk Southern put the best face possible on what it could do for Pennsylvania? Mr. Mallory. I really do not know what the motivation was. Clearly, it was good news, and received as such in many corridors in Pennsylvania. Senator Specter. Well, we will reserve that question for Mr. Goode. I gave him a little advance notice of a question. Mayor Rendell, I congratulate you on your work generally for the city, and for your stance taken here on this proposed arrangement. You have cited accurately the statutory backgr"
