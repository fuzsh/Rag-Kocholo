        "text": "RAILROAD-OWNED BUS COMPANIES\n\nToday's transportation fans may think of intercity trains and intercity buses as rivals, sometimes bitter. In 1971, the privately operated money losing intercity passenger train network was finally nationalized as Amtrak, receiving subsidies and cutting certain fares in its first several months of existence. Greyhound protested, calling it \"un-American\" to run in the red. While ignoring the fact that Greyhound buses operate over subsidized roads.\n\nWhat is generally not known to today's transportation fans, is that many of the private railroads were active in the marketing of intercity bus services, mainly during the 1930's and 1940's. Some railroads formed bus subsidiaries, and operated buses to replace certain lightly used trains, along with buses along the railroad routes to thwart off bus lines competing with their passenger trains. While some railroads acquired stock in existing bus companies, which would complement the passenger trains.\n\nMeanwhile, more intercity bus companies were getting together, forming the Greyhound and Trailways systems. Eventually Greyhound consisted of a number of regional companies with varying degrees of ownership by the main Greyhound corporation. While Trailways consisted of many separate companies working together as \"members\" of the Trailways system.\n\nAnd many of these railroad owned bus companies eventually became part of Greyhound or Trailways. Some Greyhound regional companies became jointly owned by a railroad and Greyhound, identified with a Greyhound name. Or some railroad bus companies became members of the Trailways system, adding \"Trailways\" to their operating names. A few bus companies remained independent.\n\nBut by the 1950's, the railroads generally gave up all interest in the bus operations, with the routes becoming entirely owned by Greyhound or Continental Trailways. And despite Greyhound's early objections to Amtrak subsidies, Greyhound now recognizes the value of added passengers connecting to and from Amtrak trains. Both Greyhound and Amtrak benefit by working together, competing against the automobile.\n\nMany of these subsidiaries also operated trucks for freight service. Not listed are motor subsidiaries which only operated trucks.\n\nSanta Fe Railway\n\nBus Subsidiary:\n\nSanta Fe Trail Transportation/Santa Fe Trailways\n\nBaltimore & Ohio Railroad\n\nBus Subsidiary:\n\nWest Virginia Transportation Co.\n\nBangor & Aroostook Railroad\n\nBus Subsidiary:\n\nBangor & Aroostook Highway Division\n\nFormed 1936, sold 1984 to Cyr Bus Line.\n\nBoston & Maine Railroad\n\nBus Subsidiary:\n\nBoston & Maine Transportation Co.\n\nCentral of Georgia Railway\n\nBus Subsidiary:\n\nCentral of Georgia Motor Transport Co.\n\nSold 1940 to Southeastern Stages.\n\nCentral Railroad of New Jersey\n\nBus Subsidiary:\n\nJersey Central Transportation Co.\n\nFormed 1927, sold 1957 to Somerset Bus Co.\n\nCentral Vermont Railway\n\nBus Subsidiary:\n\nCentral Vermont Transit Co.\n\nFormed 1931, ceased operations in 1956.\n\nChicago & Alton Railroad\n\nBus Subsidiary:\n\nAlton Transportation Co.\n\nFormed 1927, sold 1930 to Jacksonville Bus Line.\n\nChicago Burlington & Quincy Railroad\n\nBus Subsidiary:\n\nBurlington Transportation Co./Burlington Trailways\n\nChicago & North Western Railroad\n\nPartial Ownership:\n\nOverland Greyhound Lines\n\nRock Island Lines\n\nBus Subsidiary:\n\nRock Island Motor Transit Co.\n\nFormed 1927 as primarily a truck subsidiary.\n\nOperated supplemental buses between Bureau and Peoria IL 1941-1963.\n\nDenver & Rio Grande Western Railroad\n\nBus Subsidiaries:\n\nRio Grande Motor Way/Rio Grande Trailways\n\nDenver-Colorado Springs-Pueblo Motor Way/Trailways\n\nDenver-Salt Lake-Pacific Stages/Trailways\n\nGreat Northern Railroad\n\nPartial Ownership:\n\nNorthland Greyhound Lines\n\nGulf Mobile & Northern Railroad/Gulf Mobile & Ohio Railroad\n\nBus Subsidiary:\n\nGulf Transport Co.\n\nIllinois Central Railroad\n\nBus Subsidiary:\n\nCentral Transportation Co.\n\nFormed 1929, ceased operations in 1933.\n\nMaine Central Railroad\n\nBus Subsidiary:\n\nMaine Central Transportation Co.\n\nMissouri Pacific Railroad\n\nBus Subsidiary:\n\nMissouri Pacific Bus Lines/Missouri Pacific Trailways\n\nMobile & Ohio Railroad\n\nBus Subsidiary:\n\nMobile & Ohio Transportation Co.\n\nFormed 1939, merged 1940 into Gulf Transport Co.\n\nNevada Northern Railway\n\nOperated bus service replacing passenger trains, until 1968.\n\nNew York Central Railroad\n\nPartial Ownership:\n\nCentral Greyhound Lines\n\nNew York New Haven & Hartford Railroad\n\nPartial Ownership:\n\nNew England Greyhound Lines\n\nBus Subsidiary:\n\nNew England Transportation Co.\n\nFormed 1925, ceased operations in 1958.\n\nNorfolk Southern Railroad\n\nBus Subsidiary:\n\nNorfolk Southern Bus Co.\n\nFormed 1926, sold 1954 to Carolina Coach Co.\n\nNorthern Pacific Railroad\n\nBus Subsidiary:\n\nNorthern Pacific Transportation Co.\n\nFormed 1931, sold 1969.\n\nPennsylvania Railroad\n\nPartial Ownership:\n\nPennsylvania Greyhound Lines\n\nReading Railroad\n\nBus Subsidiary:\n\nReading Transportation Co./Reading Trailways\n\nFormed 1927, in 1955 joined Trailways, sold 1964 to various Trailways companies.\n\nRichmond Fredericksburg & Potomac Railroad\n\nPartial Ownership:\n\nRichmond Greyhound Lines\n\nSt. Louis San Francisco Railroad\n\nBus Subsidiary:\n\nFrisco Transportation Co.\n\nFormed 1937 as truck and bus subsidiary, in 1938 introduced bus service, from 1945 to 1960 was Trailways member, sold 1961.\n\nSt. Louis Southwestern Railroad\n\nPartial Ownership:\n\nSouthwestern Greyhound Lines\n\nSouthern Pacific Railroad\n\nPartial Ownership:\n\nPacific Greyhound Lines\n\nSpokane Portland & Seattle Railroad\n\nBus Subsidiary:\n\nSpokane Portland & Seattle Transportation Co.\n\nFormed 1924, sold 1953 to Pacific Greyhound Lines.\n\nUnion Pacific Railroad\n\nPartial Ownership:\n\nOverland Greyhound Lines"
