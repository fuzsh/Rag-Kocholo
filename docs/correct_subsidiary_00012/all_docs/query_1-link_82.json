        "text": "Norfolk Southern Corp., which took over sections of the Conrail system in 1999, including many of the railroad‘s tracks and facilities in Pennsylvania, is immersed in improvement work that reflects the importance of Harrisburg to the company as a rail hub.\n\nHarrisburg anchors one corner of the roughly triangular-shaped Norfolk Southern rail network. The other corners are in Atlanta and Chicago. From Harrisburg, much like an airline hub, trains arriving from the South fan out like wheel spokes to northern New Jersey, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Binghamton, N.Y., New England, Cleveland and Chicago. Or vice versa. About 970 mid-state residents work for Norfolk Southern in Harrisburg.\n\nThe work is focused now on the historic Enola Yard, which has been a railcar classification facility since 1905 for the former Pennsylvania Railroad, Conrail and now Norfolk Southern. Conrail severely downgraded Enola in the 1990s, and the current work won‘t restore it to its former glory, but it will be bigger than it was.\n\nThe project grew out of a computer-modeling study of how to integrate Conrail with Norfolk Southern that was conducted shortly after the acquisition, according to David A. Brown II, general manager for Norfolk Southern‘s Northern Region, which is headquartered near Linglestown.\n\nThat study showed that more car sorting needed to be done at Harrisburg than could be done without the Enola Yard in operation, so Norfolk Southern set up a 15-track classification yard at Enola. That increased the number of cars that could be handled daily from 125 to 725.\n\nThe Enola Yard will again become a “hump“ operation, where inclined tracks use gravity to help sort cars. Previously, it had been a flat-switching operation that used paper lists and human intervention to get the cars where they needed to go. Brown hopes the yard will be able to handle 1,200 rail cars daily when the work is done.\n\n“Under the new system, the computer will look at where the car goes and route it by changing switches,“ Brown said. “And the human part of it is to oversee that. They‘ll still separate the cars. They‘ll be involved in slowing the cars down as they automatically roll. … It‘s more of an automated process.“\n\nHe said “not a whole lot“ will change in terms of the number of jobs in the Enola Yard as a result of the classification work, and conceded that there might be a “slight reduction.“ About 380 employees work at Enola in all categories. Overall, Norfolk Southern is hiring workers – a lot of them – for some of the best-paid blue-collar union jobs in the region.\n\nRemote control, as automated freight classification is known, is controversial among the rail unions because it enables one or two workers to do what a crew of several employees did previously. Ken Kertesz, chairman of the Pennsylvania Legislative Board of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers, said the union lost an arbitration with the United Transportation Union – the conductors and trainmen – over jurisdiction over remote control.\n\nKertesz said remote control has been used in Canada for 10 years and argued that it has not been as big a money-saver as the railroads hoped. Remote control is used by Norfolk Southern at Reading and Philadelphia as well as Enola.\n\nThe other big project that is getting under way is the $5 million Lemoyne Connector, a new track that will allow Norfolk Southern trains from Hagerstown, Md., to avoid a circuitous, congested route through Harrisburg to get to Enola Yard. Those trains now must make a right turn onto the distinctive old Reading Railroad bridge across the Susquehanna River, then proceed through Harrisburg and up to the Rockville Bridge, where they cross the river again and proceed south to Enola.\n\n“Lemoyne is one of the linkages (we need) to make an efficient network,“ Brown said. “Especially with Enola back in operation.“\n\nUnder Conrail, a connector was less important because of the location of its network main lines and the decision to phase out Enola in the 1990s.\n\nThe boroughs of Lemoyne and Wormleysburg have expressed concern about the connector project because a small piece of Memorial Park would be needed for the half-mile rail line and because of noise concerns. Most of the line would go across undeveloped land on the edge of the park. Norfolk Southern is seeking an easement of 1.65 acres."
