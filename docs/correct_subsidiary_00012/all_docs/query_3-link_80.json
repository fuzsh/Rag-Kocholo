        "text": "(Norfolk Southern issued the following news release on March 1.)\n\nNORFOLK, Va. — Norfolk Southern Railway Company today announced the opening of a new Thoroughbred Bulk Transfer (TBT) terminal in Greer, S.C. Transplastics, a division of Quality Carriers Inc., and a major provider of dry and liquid bulk transportation services in North America, will operate the terminal.\n\nTBT facilities handle the transfer of bulk products, such as plastic pellets, dry and liquid chemicals, construction materials and food products from one mode of transportation to another. Bulk transfer permits off-rail shippers and receivers of varied commodities to combine rail’s long-haul efficiencies with truck’s convenient door-to-door delivery.\n\n“Transplastics is excited to increase the number of TBTs it operates for Norfolk Southern from three to four,” said David Swann, vice president and general manager. “The Greer TBT will complement and increase the flexibility of the TBT that we operate for NS in Spartanburg, S.C. Our relationship with NS will improve our ability to serve customers in North Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia, and offer them additional value-added services.”\n\n“The Greer facility will enhance Norfolk Southern’s network of 28 existing TBT terminals in 16 states and extend distribution and terminal options for plastics, chemicals, agricultural and construction shippers in the South,” said Mike Webb, manager of MODALGISTICS(SM), Norfolk Southern’s supply chain and distribution services group. “The new terminal also will allow NS to expand its participation in handling construction materials and food-grade products, such as flour, sugar and starch, in the Spartanburg area.”\n\nThe new Greer TBT terminal has 50 car spots with separate tracks for food products and can handle both dry and liquid bulk products. The facility features paving, security, full fencing, steam boiler for product heating, lighting, and 24-hour access and truck scales. All TBT terminals are open facilities and provide access to any qualified motor carrier.\n\nLocated at 1813 Hood Road in Greer, S.C., the terminal has convenient access to Interstate 85.\n\nNorfolk Southern’s other TBT facilities are located in Atlanta; Augusta, Ga.; Baltimore; Bethlehem, Pa.; Buffalo, N.Y.; Charlotte, N.C.; Chattanooga, Tenn.; Chicago; Cincinnati (2); Cleveland; Columbus, Ohio (2); Dalton, Ga.; Edgemoor, Del.; Elizabeth, N.J.; Fayetteville, N.C.; Jacksonville, Fla.; Louisville, Ky.; Miami, Fla.; Mobile, Ala.; Paterson, N.J.; Petersburg, Va.; Pittsburgh; Spartanburg, S.C.; Whiting, Ind.; Willis, Mich.; and Winston- Salem, N.C.\n\nFor more information about doing business at TBT facilities, contact Mike Webb at 757-823-5423.\n\nNorfolk Southern Corporation (NYSE: NSC – News) is one of the nation’s premier transportation companies. Its Norfolk Southern Railway subsidiary operates 21,500 route miles in 22 states, the District of Columbia and Ontario, serving every major container port in the eastern United States and providing superior connections to western rail carriers. NS operates the most extensive intermodal network in the East and is the nation’s largest rail carrier of automotive parts and finished vehicles."
