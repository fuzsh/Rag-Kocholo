        "text": "NORFOLK, Va., Jan. 27, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Norfolk Southern Corporation (NYSE: NSC) today reported fourth-quarter and 2015 financial results.\n\nFourth-quarter net income was $361 million, or $1.20 per diluted share, compared with $511 million, or $1.64 per diluted share, in fourth-quarter 2014. For 2015, net income was $1.6 billion, or $5.10 per diluted share, compared with $2.0 billion, or $6.39 per diluted share, in 2014.\n\nResults included expenses related to restructuring the company's Triple Crown Services subsidiary and closing its Roanoke, Va., office, which together reduced fourth-quarter net income by $31 million, or $0.10 per diluted share, and lowered 2015 net income by $58 million, or $0.19 per diluted share.\n\nFOURTH-QUARTER 2015 RESULTS\n\nRailway operating revenues totaled $2.5 billion.\n\nIncome from railway operations was $642 million.\n\nNet income was $361 million.\n\nDiluted earnings per share were $1.20.\n\nThe railway operating ratio was 74.5 percent.\n\n2015 RESULTS\n\nRailway operating revenues reached $10.5 billion.\n\nIncome from railway operations was $2.9 billion.\n\nNet income totaled $1.6 billion.\n\nDiluted earnings per share were $5.10.\n\nThe railway operating ratio was 72.6 percent.\n\nIn a separate press release issued today, Norfolk Southern provided additional detail regarding its strategic plan to streamline operations and drive profitability and growth. The plan includes cost reductions across the organization and improved operational efficiencies. As a result of this plan, the Company expects to achieve annual productivity savings of more than $650 million by 2020, with approximately $130 million to be realized in 2016. Through the initiatives announced today, Norfolk Southern is confident in its ability to achieve an operating ratio below 65 percent by 2020.\n\n\"We are implementing a plan to reduce costs and enhance profitable growth,\" said James A. Squires, Norfolk Southern's chairman, president and CEO. \"This plan will enable us to achieve significant annual expense savings beginning in 2016 without compromising the company's ability to capitalize on volume and revenue growth opportunities. We are making progress despite a challenging operating environment, including successfully restoring our rail service to previous high levels, realigning resources, and completing strategic capacity investments to improve efficiency and productivity.\n\n\"Through these actions, we are positioning Norfolk Southern for improved performance and value creation in 2016 and beyond. We are confident in our ability to deliver superior shareholder value through our strategic plan, which is built on exceptional customer service, growth through pricing and new business, cost reduction and control, and increasing returns on capital. Our fourth-quarter results reflect current challenges in domestic and global markets.\"\n\nFOURTH-QUARTER SUMMARY\n\nRailway operating revenues declined 12 percent compared with fourth-quarter 2014, to $2.5 billion. Traffic volume declined 6 percent, a result of lower coal volumes and the effects of low commodity prices. Average revenue per unit decreased 6 percent as the effects of higher rates were more than offset by a $226 million, or 73 percent, decline in fuel surcharge revenues.\n\nGeneral merchandise revenues were $1.5 billion, 9 percent lower than the same period last year. Volume declined 4 percent, as a 9 percent gain in automotive traffic was more than offset by decreases in the other four commodity groups.\n\nIntermodal revenues declined to $563 million, 13 percent below fourth-quarter 2014. The Triple Crown restructuring and fewer domestic shipments combined to reduce traffic volume by 5 percent.\n\nCoal revenues were $433 million, 20 percent lower compared with fourth quarter of 2014. A weak global export market, record high temperatures in the East, and low natural gas prices combined to decrease volume by 18 percent.\n\nRailway operating expenses decreased $103 million, or 5 percent, to $1.9 billion compared with same period of 2014, notwithstanding $49 million of expenses related to the Triple Crown restructuring and Roanoke office closure.\n\nIncome from railway operations was $642 million, 28 percent lower compared with fourth-quarter 2014.\n\nThe operating ratio, or operating expenses as a percentage of revenues, was 74.5 percent, compared with 69 percent during the same quarter in 2014. Triple Crown restructuring and Roanoke office closure expenses added 2.0 percentage points to the operating ratio.\n\n2015 SUMMARY\n\nRailway operating revenues were $10.5 billion, 10 percent lower compared with 2014, reflecting an $852 million, or 64 percent, reduction in fuel surcharge revenues. Traffic volume was down 3 percent, driven by a sharp decline in coal.\n\nGeneral merchandise revenues declined 6 percent to $6.3 billion, while traffic volume was about even compared with the prior year.\n\nIntermodal revenues totaled $2.4 billion, 6 percent lower compared with 2014. Traffic volume was up slightly for 2015.\n\nCoal revenues were $1.8 billion, down 23 percent, due to a 16 percent decline in traffic volume compared with 2014.\n\nRailway operating expenses of $7.6 billion declined $422 million, or 5 percent, compared with 2014, despite $93 million of additional expenses related to the Triple Crown restructuring and Roanoke office closure.\n\nIncome from railway operations was $2.9 billion, 19 percent lower compared with 2014.\n\nThe operating ratio for the year was 72.6 percent compared with 69.2 percent the prior year. The Triple Crown restructuring and Roanoke office closure costs added 0.9 percentage points to the operating ratio.\n\nFor 2016, Norfolk Southern plans to invest $2.1 billion to maintain the safety of its rail network, enhance service, improve operational efficiency, and support growth opportunities.\n\nAbout Norfolk Southern\n\nNorfolk Southern Corporation (NYSE: NSC) is one of the nation's premier transportation companies.

Restructuring Costs\n\nFourth quarter 2015 results include $49 million of costs associated with the restructuring of our Triple Crown Services subsidiary and the closure of our Roanoke, Virginia, office, which reduced net income by $31 million, or $0.10 per diluted share. For 2015, results include $93 million of such costs, which reduced net income by $58 million, or $0.19 per diluted share.\n\n2. Stock Repurchase Program\n\nWe repurchased 11.3 million and 3.1 million shares of common stock in 2015 and 2014, respectively, at a cost of $1.1 billion and $318 million, respectively. We have remaining authorization from our Board of Directors to repurchase up to 23.9 million shares through December 31, 2017. The timing and volume of purchases is guided by our assessment of market conditions and other pertinent factors. Any near-term share repurchases are expected to be made with internally generated cash, cash on hand, or proceeds from borrowings. Since the beginning of 2006, we have repurchased and retired 151.1 million shares at a total cost of $9.5 billion.\n\n3. New Accounting Pronouncement\n\nIn April 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2015-03, \"Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs.\" This update requires that debt issuance costs be presented in the balance sheet as a reduction from the related debt liability rather than as an asset, consistent with debt discounts. The recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs are not affected by the amendments in this update. We early adopted the provisions of this ASU during the second quarter of 2015 and applied it retrospectively. The adoption of ASU 2015-03 resulted in the presentation of $47 million of debt issuance costs as a reduction of \"Long-term debt\" at December 31, 2015. We retrospectively adjusted the December 31, 2014 consolidated balance sheet and related disclosures to reflect the reclassification of $41 million of debt issuance costs from \"Other assets\" to \"Long-term debt.\" There was no other impact on our consolidated financial statements from the adoption of ASU 2015-03.\n\nTo view the original version on PR Newswire, visit:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/norfolk-southern-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2015-results-300210318.html\n\nSOURCE Norfolk Southern Corporation"
