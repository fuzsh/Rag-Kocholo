        "text": "the Chesapeake and Albemarle Railroad is a short-line railroad connecting Hampton Roads with Albemarle/Pamlico Sound in North Carolina\n\nSource: Genesee & Wyoming, Chesapeake and Albemarle Railroad\n\nThe Chesapeake and Albemarle Railroad started as the Elizabeth City & Norfolk Railroad Company in 1870, but a decade passed before construction started. When the North Carolina General Assembly changed its name to \"Norfolk Southern\" in 1883, it had track connecting Norfolk with Edenton, North Carolina.1\n\nthe \"original\" Norfolk Southern connected Edenton to Norfolk in the 1880's\n\nSource: University of North Carolina, New railroad and county map of North Carolina (by George Franklin Cram, 1880's)\n\nThe \"original\" Norfolk Southern operated 1883-1974, when the Norfolk and Western Railroad acquired it. The Norfolk and Western merged with the Southern Railway in 1982, and the new railroad has been called the Norfolk Southern since then.\n\nthe original Norfolk Southern built a terminal on the Elizabeth River, near the modern portal of the Downtown Tunnel\n\nSource: Norfolk Public Library, Panorama of Norfolk and Surroundings, 1892\n\nThe original Norfolk Southern started as the Elizabeth City & Norfolk Railroad, completed in 1881. The line paralleled the Dismal Swamp Canal, allowing freight to go by railroad rather than canal boat between Edenton and the Chesapeake Bay port of Norfolk. The Albemarle & Chesapeake Canal was another competitor for freight and passengers.\n\nthe Elizabeth City & Norfolk Railroad competed with the Dismal Swamp Canal and the Albemarle & Chesapeake Canal\n\nSource: Library of Congress, Sanborn Fire Insurance Map from Norfolk, Independent Cities, Virginia (Sanborn Map Company, 1887)\n\nThe railroad was renamed the Norfolk Southern Railroad in 1883, then the Norfolk & Southern Railroad in 1891, and back to Norfolk Southern Railroad in 1900.\n\nthe Elizabeth City & Norfolk Railroad (later Norfolk & Southern) built its northern terminal on the Southern Branch of the Elizabeth River in Berkley\n\nSource: Library of Congress, Sanborn Fire Insurance Map from Norfolk, Independent Cities, Virginia (Sanborn Map Company, 1887)\n\nAs part of the corporate changes in 1900, it acquired the Norfolk, Virginia Beach and Southern Railroad. That gave the railroad a connection to the oceanfront resort area of Princess Anne County. The corporate headquarters was located in Norfolk until 1961, when it moved to Raleigh.2\n\nthe Norfolk Southern transported passengers to the oceanfront for almost 50 years\n\nSource: Norfolk Public Library, Chesapeake Park Land Development Plan, Princess Anne County, Virginia (1910)\n\nVarious types of passengers rode the Munden line, which had been built by the Norfolk, Virginia Beach and Southern Railroad in 1898. It was called the \"Currituck Branch\" and \"The Sportsmenï¿½s Special\" because it carried the wealthy to their hunting clubs near Back Bay and the Atlantic Ocean coastline. Prince Anne residents also called it the \"Lawyerï¿½s Special,\" because it passed by the county courthouse (now city hall).\n\nin 1902, the Norfolk Southern had two tracks headed south from the line connecting Norfolk-Virginia Beach\n\nSource: US Geological Survey (USGS), Norfolk, VA 1:25,000 scale topographic quadrangle (1902)\n\nStudents used the twice-daily trains to get to the three high schools at Oceana, Creeds and Kempsville. During World War II, the military used that line to transport men and horses to Munden Point. From the end of the line, they would ride to Sandbridge and patrol the shoreline.\n\nin 1946, a Norfolk Southern branch connected the Norfolk-Virginia Beach line with Munden Point\n\nSource: US Geological Survey (USGS), Moyock VA 1:62,500 scale topographic quadrangle (1946)\n\nthe former end of the railroad is now Munden Point Park\n\nSource: ESRI, ArcGIS Online\n\nAcquisition of the the Norfolk, Virginia Beach and Southern Railroad by the original Norfolk Southern in 1900 did not give the railroad a monopoly on the \"carry tourists from Norfolk to the waterfront\" business. The Norfolk and Ocean View Railroad took people to the vacation destination of Ocean View on Willoughby Spit, a resort area on the Chesapeake Bay that competed successfully with the struggling \"Virginia Beach\" hotels on the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nIn addition, the Chesapeake Transit Company became a serious competitor to carry vacationers from Norfolk to the Atlantic Ocean waterfront. It aimed to develop alternative vacation resort properties at Cape Henry, north of Virginia Beach. At Cape Henry, extensive forests in \"The Desert\" offered revenue-generating feight cargo in addition to the tourist business.\n\nBy 1902, the Chesapeake Transit Company had built a drawbridge at Lynnhaven Inlet and completed an electrified, standard gauge line to Cape Henry. The brick passenger station opened there in 1904. William J. O'Keefe's casino and a dance pavilion at Cape Henry provided entertainment for Norfolk residents making a day trip, while cottages and a hotel provided an overnight option.\n\nThe Norfolk Southern line ending at the Virginia Beach oceanfront was extended north to Cape Henry in 1902, the same year the Chesapeake Transit Company completed its electric traction line from Norfolk to Cape Henry. The Chesapeake Transit Company advertised that vacationers should use its route to the oceanfront because its electricity-powered trains were \"smokeless,\" in contrast to the coal-fired locomotives of the Norfolk Southern.\n\nthe Norfolk Southern extended its track to Cape Henry in 1902\n\nSource: Library of Congress, Railway mail map of Virginia (Earl P. Hopkins, c.1910)\n\nAfter reaching Cape Henry, the Chesapeake Transit Company built track south to the resort at Virginia Beach. Instead of connecting, however, the Norfolk Southern started to lay new track next to the Chesapeake Transit Company line and build its own line north towards Cape Henry. The old Norfolk, Virginia Beach and Southern Railroad track to the Oceanfront was electrified, leveling the playing field for \"smokeless\" trips.\n\nRather than complete duplicative lines, the Chesapeake Transit Company investors in Pittsburgh purchased the original Norfolk Southern. Its ownership had shifted from the Vanderbilts to George Gould, son of the legendary financial speculator Jay Gould. The railroads in Princess Anne County were owned by Northern investors, not by Virginia-based capitalists. Their decisions were based on maximizing profits, not on local pride.\n\nThe Chesapeake Transit Company and Norfolk Southern merged in 1904. The new railroad used the \"Norfolk Southern\" name.\n\nUsing the electrified lines, vacationers could travel in a loop from Norfolk to Cape Henry, then along the shoreline of the Atlantic Ocean almost to Rudee Inlet before heading west back to Norfolk.3\n\nAfter the US Army built Fort Story in 1914, the original Norfolk Southern transported military passengers and freight to the sand dunes at the Cape Henry lighthouse.4\n\nIn 1913, the Norfolk Southern built a spur to the State Rifle Range (now Camp Pendleton). Train carried National Guardsmen from Rifle Range Junction to the camp for training. Another spur on the western edge of Oceana Naval Air Station is now remembered by a local road, Railroad Drive.5\n\nthe Norfolk Southern spur on the west side of Oceana is memorialized by Railroad Drive\n\nSource: US Geological Survey (USGS), Princess Anne 1:24,000 topographic quadrangle (1965)\n\nThe original Norfolk Southern carried passengers through World War II. Only freight was carried east of Norfolk after 1947. The tracks built to Cape Henry by the Norfolk, Virginia Beach and Southern Railroad were removed in the early 1950's.\n\nThe Norfolk Southern Railroad expanded primarily in North Carolina. It acquired other rail systems, including the Suffolk & Carolina Railway. A five-mile wooden trestle spanned Albemarle Sound south of Edenton to Mackeys, replacing the ferry service in 1910. The original Norfolk Southern Railroad stretched from Norfolk to Charlotte.\n\nA 25-mile line between Elizabeth City and the old Suffolk & Carolina Railway at Beckford Junction was built in 1904. It operated for four decades, until being removed during World War II.\n\nThe original Norfolk Southern was acquired by the Southern Railway in 1974. It operated as a separate company until being merged into the modern Norfolk Southern railroad and becoming a \"fallen flag\" railroad in 1982.6\n\nIn 1990, the modern Norfolk Southern leased the track of the original Norfolk Southern between Chesapeake and Edenton, naming it the Chesapeake and Albemarle Railroad. RailTex, an independent operator, was the first company to operate trains on that stretch under the modern Norfolk Southern's Thoroughbred Shortline Program.\n\nThe bridge over the Chowan River from Edenton to Mackeys was removed in the 1990's, blocking any potential for the Chesapeake and Albemarle Railroad to go past Edenton.\n\n|RailAmerica acquired the lease in 2000. Genesee & Wyoming acquired it in 2012.7\n\nToday the Chesapeake and Albemarle Railroad links the City of Chesapeake to Edendon, North Carolina. Of its 69 miles, 18 are in Virginia. The short line services primarily industrial customers located along the Elizabeth River, including readymix plants and agricultural customers shipping soybeans and grain.8\n\nthe first Norfolk Southern Railway was built between Norfolk and Edenton, and ultimately reached Charlotte, North Carolina\n\nSource: University of North Carolina Libraries, Railroad map of North Carolina 1900 (bt Henry C. Brown, 1900)\n\nAll freight service on the original Norfolk, Virginia Beach and Southern tracks to Virginia Beach stopped in 2002.\n\nthe modern Norfolk Southern painted locomotives of its predecessor railroads in 2012 to honor its 30th anniversary\n\nSource: Norfolk Southern, Our Colorful Heritage\n\nThe modern Norfolk Southern negotiated for years with the cities of Norfolk and Virginia Beach to sell the Norfolk, Virginia Beach and Southern right-of-way, where the cities intended to build a light rail line.\n\nVirginia Beach voters rejected the light rail proposal in 1999, but Norfolk proceeded to build The Tide transit system. Despite the voter rejection, the Virginia Beach City Council revived the proposal to extend the light rail and planned for transit-oriented development at Town Center. The state of Virginia provided $20 million for purchase of the old freight railroad's right-of-way, and the city contributed another $20 million to complete the purchase.\n\nIn the long term, city planners envisioned recreating a passenger connection by rail between Norfolk and Virginia Beach. Tourists could come by Amtrak to Norfolk, and catch The Tide to the hotels along the Atlantic Ocean shoreline.\n\nThose planned died in 2016, when Virginia Beach voters again rejected the light rail project. That vote blocked extension of The Tide to Town Center and later the Oceanfront on the old Norfolk, Virginia Beach and Southern right-of-way.\n\nAfter the vote, the city sought permission from the state to retain the $20 million used to purchase the right-of-way and create pedestrian or bike trail. State officials made clear that the funding was for a transit system, so the city repaid the state its $20 million share of acquisition costs in 2017.9\n\nToday, the right-of-way sits unused east of the Tide's Newtown Station.\n\nThe Tide ends at Newtown Road, and the old Norfolk and Virginia Beach/Norfolk Southern Railroad right-of-way remains unused east of that point\n\nSource: ESRI, ArcGIS Online\n\nNorfolk, Virginia Beach and Southern Railroad\n\nRailroad Access and Hampton Roads Shipping Terminals\n\nLinks\n\nAmerican-Rails.com\n\nOriginal Norfolk Southern Railway, \"East Carolina Dispatch\"\n\nChesapeake and Albemarle\n\nGenesee & Wyoming\n\nNorfolk Southern Railway (by Richard C.
