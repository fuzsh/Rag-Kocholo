Customers located along Conrail’s lines in these shared asset areas have access to the nation’s rail network through either NS or CSX.\n\nAlthough Conrail no longer handles commercial matters for customers, we continue to play a critical role in serving shippers and receivers as an agent for our owners. As a local rail service provider, it is Conrail’s job to make sure that customers’ freight shipments are safely and efficiently moved between their rail sidings and the long distance freight trains operated by CSX and Norfolk Southern."
