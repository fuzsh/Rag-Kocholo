        "text": "Connecting South Florida and Western North Carolina markets\n\nATLANTA, March 5, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Norfolk Southern Corporation (NYSE: NSC) and Florida East Coast Railway (FEC) announced Tuesday an expansion of their international and domestic interline services. The Florida Express service, which is already being leveraged by anchor customer, Crowley, creates a two-way transportation solution for customers moving goods between South Florida and Charlotte, North Carolina.\n\n\"We are focused on providing reliable service and generating smart, sustainable growth opportunities for our customers,\" said Norfolk Southern Chief Marketing Officer Ed Elkins. \"This new, two-way transportation solution between Western North Carolina and South Florida accomplishes both goals, and we look forward to helping our domestic and international customers unlock the value of this service.\"\n\nThe new service offering builds upon the strong partnership between the two railroads, which continues to allow customers to unlock new supply chain pathways. The partnership relies on a steel wheel interchange in Jacksonville, operating in both directions and expanding services for customers accessing global markets through South Florida.\n\n\"For us in FEC, reaching additional markets and providing customers with options to ship into the primary markets in Florida is key to our development,\" said Luis Hernandez, VP Intermodal for FEC. \"We are committed to providing a fast, reliable and top of class service into the ports and partnering with Norfolk Southern provides a consistent and most efficient solution.\"\n\nCrowley, a US-based logistics, marine, and energy solutions company, will engage the Florida Express to help customers in the US, Central America, and the Caribbean Basin expand their options to move textile goods to and from Charlotte for garment and apparel manufacturing. North Carolina currently leads the nation with nearly 20 percent of all US textile exports, the largest textile mill industry, and more than 395 textile manufacturers.\n\n\"Through Florida Express, textile industry customers can receive enhanced supply chain efficiency, connecting our growing Central America market with US manufacturing centers such as North Carolina,\" said Crowley's Vice President, North American Transportation Bob Weist. \"Coupled with our regular ocean transportation service in South Florida, the industry will benefit with even more options to ensure fast, reliable solutions.\"\n\nIn the future, the Florida Express will accommodate customers moving goods like produce, poultry, and other commodities in the agriculture industry.
