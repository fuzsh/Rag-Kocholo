        "text": "The Cincinnati voters approved the sale of the city-owned Cincinnati Southern Railway (CSR) to Norfolk Southern on November 7, 2023. The Cincinnati Southern Railway, one of the biggest freight operators in the U.S., was created by an Ohio law enacted in 1869. In November 2022, Norfolk Southern agreed to acquire CSR, a 337-mile freight railroad that runs between Cincinnati and Chattanooga, Tennessee for $ 1.62 billion. The agreement provides Norfolk ownership of approximately 9,500 acres of land that sits under infrastructure maintained and operated by Norfolk Southern. Norfolk Southern Railway currently operates the railroad under a lease agreement.\n\nCincinnati officials plan to use the proceeds of the transaction to form an infrastructure trust fund that will benefit the citizens of Cincinnati for generations to come. The Build our Future Infrastructure Trust, managed by the CSR Board, would solely fund the rehabilitation, modernization, or replacement of existing infrastructure such as streets, bridges, municipal buildings, parks, and green space. Cincinnati officials would not be able to use the funds received for payment of debt service or for the construction of new infrastructure improvements.\n\nThe CSR is currently owned by the city of Cincinnati and operated by the Cincinnati, New Orleans, and Texas Pacific Railway Company (CNOTP), a wholly owned subsidiary of Norfolk Southern Railway, under a lease agreement expiring in 2026. The city makes roughly $25 million annually from leasing the railway. Cincinnati officials plan to use the proceeds of the sale to establish an infrastructure trust fund that will benefit the citizens of Cincinnati for generations to come. Norfolk Southern will work with the city to finalize the sale, which is expected to close in the first quarter of next year, the spokesperson said.\n\nCSR History\n\n“Before the Civil War, Cincinnati was a major destination for steamboats,” according to the city of Cincinnati. “After the war, it was more economical to ship to the south via Louisville instead of Cincinnati because of the newly built L&N Railroad. Since no rail line existed connecting Cincinnati to the deep south, the city fathers decided to build one” and expand the Cincinnati economy. An Ohio law enabling the creation of CSR was enacted on May 4, 1869, with a resolution adopted a month later designating Chattanooga as the southern terminus.\n\nCSR was built through rugged terrain, which included 27 tunnels and 105 bridges, according to the city. In October 1881, an operating lease was awarded to CNO&TP, which in 1893 came under the control of Southern Railway, an NS predecessor."
