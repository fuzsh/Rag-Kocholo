        "text": "This article pertains to the rail company that has existed since 1982. For other uses of the term \"the historical railway\", see Norfolk Southern Railway (1942–1982).\n\nThe Norfolk Southern Railway (Reporting Mark: NS) is a Class I freight railroad in the United States, formed in 1982 by the merger of the Norfolk and Western Railway and the Southern Railway. With headquarters in Atlanta, the company operates 19,420 route miles (31,250 km) in 22 eastern states, the District of Columbia, and has rights in Canada over the Albany to Montréal route of the Canadian Pacific Railway, and previously on CN from Buffalo to St. Thomas. NS is responsible for maintaining 28,400 miles, with the remainder being operated under trackage rights from other parties responsible for maintenance. Intermodal containers and trailers are the most common commodity type carried by NS, which have grown as coal business has declined throughout the 21st century; coal was formerly the largest source of traffic. The railway offers the largest intermodal rail network in eastern North America. NS was also the pioneer of Roadrailer service. Norfolk Southern and its chief competitor, CSX Transportation, have a duopoly on the transcontinental freight rail lines in the Eastern United States.\n\nNS has long been a major transporter of domestic and export coal, though this business has declined in the 21st century in favor of intermodal traffic. The railway's major sources of the mineral are located in Pennsylvania's Cambria and Indiana counties, as well as the Monongahela Valley; West Virginia; and the Appalachia regions of Virginia, Kentucky, and Tennessee. Coal transported by NS is then exported to steel mills and power plants around the world.\n\nNorfolk Southern is the namesake and leading subsidiary of the Norfolk Southern Corporation, based in Atlanta, Georgia; it was headquartered in Norfolk, Virginia until 2021. Norfolk Southern Corporation was incorporated in Virginia on July 23, 1980, and is publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the symbol NSC. The primary business function of Norfolk Southern Corporation is the rail transportation of raw materials, intermediate products, and finished goods across the Southeast, East, and Midwest United States. The corporation further facilitates transport to the remainder of the United States through interchange with other rail carriers while also serving overseas transport needs by serving several Atlantic and Gulf Coast ports. As of April 10, 2019, Norfolk Southern Corporation's total public stock value was slightly over $51.6 billion.\n\nHistory[]\n\nPredecessors[]\n\nNorfolk Southern's predecessor railroads date to the early 19th century.\n\nThe SOU's earliest predecessor line was the South Carolina Canal & Rail Road. Chartered in 1827, the South Carolina Canal & Rail Road Company became the first to offer regularly scheduled passenger train service with the inaugural run of the Best Friend of Charleston in 1830. Another early predecessor, the Richmond & Danville Railroad (R&D), was formed in 1847 and expanded into a large system after the American Civil War under Algernon S. Buford. The R&D ultimately fell on hard times and in 1894, it became a major portion of the new Southern Railway (SOU). Financier J. P. Morgan selected veteran railroader Samuel Spencer as president. Profitable and innovative, Southern became, in 1953, the first major U.S. railroad to completely switch to diesel-electric locomotives from steam.\n\nThe City Point Railroad, established in 1838, was a Template:Convert railroad in Virginia that started south of Richmond — specifically, City Point on the navigable portion of the James River, now part of the independent city of Hopewell — and ran to Petersburg. It was acquired by the South Side Railroad in 1854. After the Civil War, it became part of the Atlantic, Mississippi & Ohio Railroad (AM&O), a trunk line across Virginia's southern tier formed by mergers in 1870 by William Mahone, who had built the Norfolk & Petersburg Railroad in the 1850s. The AM&O was the oldest portion of the Norfolk & Western (N&W) when it was formed in 1881, under new owners with a keen interest and financial investments in the coal fields of Western Virginia and West Virginia, a product which came to define and enrich the railroad. In the second half of the 20th century, the N&W acquired the Virginian Railway (1959), the Wabash Railway, and the Nickel Plate Road, among others.\n\nFormation[]\n\nIn 1980, the Norfolk Southern Corporation was created as a holding company for the Southern Railway (SOU, formed in 1894) and Norfolk & Western Railway (N&W, formed in 1881). In 1982, the Southern Railroad was given the new name of the Norfolk Southern Railway, an older line acquired by SOU in 1974, that primarily served North Carolina and the southeastern tip of Virginia; following this, Norfolk and Western was merged into the company, forming one, united, railroad. Headquarters for the new NS were established in Norfolk, Virginia. The company suffered a slight embarrassment when the marble headpiece at the building's entrance was unveiled, which read \"Norfork Southern Railway\". A new headpiece replaced the erroneous one several weeks later. NS aimed to compete in the eastern United States with CSX Transportation, formed after the Interstate Commerce Commission's 1980 approval of the merger of the Chessie System and the Seaboard System.\n\nConrail purchase[]\n\nThe system grew with the acquisition of over half of Conrail. The Consolidated Rail Corporation (Conrail) was an 11,000-mile system formed in 1976 from the Penn Central Railroad (1968–1976), and five other ailing northeastern railroads that were conveyed into it, forming a government-financed corporation. Conrail was perhaps the most controversial conglomerate in corporate history. Penn Central itself was created by merging three venerable rivals — the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR, 1846), the New York Central Railroad (NYC, 1831), and the New York, New Haven & Hartford Railroad (NYNH&H, 1872) — as well as some smaller competitors. In 1980, Conrail had become profitable after the Staggers Act largely deregulated the U.S. railroad industry. In 1996, CSX bid to buy Conrail; Norfolk Southern, fearing that CSX would come to dominate rail traffic in the eastern U.S., responded with a bid of its own. On June 23, 1997, NS and CSX filed a joint application with the Surface Transportation Board (STB) for authority to purchase, divide, and operate the assets of Conrail. On June 6, 1998, the STB approved the NS-CSX application, effective August 22, 1998. NS acquired 58% of Conrail assets, including about 7200 Miles of track, most of which was part of the former Pennsylvania Railroad. CSX got the remaining 42%. NS began operating its trains on its portion of the former Conrail network on June 1, 1999, closing out the 1990s merger era.\n\n21st century[]\n\nIn 2016, a proposed merger that had been months in the pipeline with Canadian Pacific was abandoned abruptly. The proposed merger would have seen the joining of two companies worth over $20 billion each.\n\nAccording to NS's 2018 Annual Report to Investors, at the end of 2018, NS had more than 26,000 employees, 4,100 locomotives, and 54,400 freight cars. At the end of 2018, the transport of coal made up 16% of the total operating revenue of NS, general merchandise (automotive, chemicals, metals, construction materials, agriculture commodities, consumer products, paper, clay, and forest products) made up 59%, and intermodal made up 25% of the total. Norfolk Southern has since slimmed its fleet to roughly 3,950 locomotives.\n\nOn December 12, 2018, Norfolk Southern announced that it would be relocating its headquarters to Atlanta, Georgia; leaving its hometown of Norfolk after 38 years. The new headquarters building was opened on November 10, 2021.\n\nCompany officers[]\n\nJohn P. Fishwick, Sr.\n\nCEO and President of Norfolk Western Railroad: 1970-1980\n\nCEO and President of Norfolk Southern Railroad: 1980-1981\n\nRobert B. Claytor\n\nCEO: 1982 – 1987\n\nArnold B. McKinnon\n\nCEO and President: 1987 – 1992\n\nDavid R. Goode:\n\nCEO: 1992 – 2005\n\nPresident: 1991 – 2004\n\nCharles \"Wick\" Moorman:\n\nCEO: 2005 – 2015\n\nPresident: 2004 – 2013\n\nJames A.

Shaw\n\nPresident: December 2021 – Present\n\nCurrent trackage[]\n\nMain article: List of Norfolk Southern Railway lines\n\nRegional divisions[]\n\nNorfolk Southern is divided into 3 operation regions, each containing 2 divisions.\n\nSouthern Region\n\nGulf Division\n\nCoastal Division\n\nCentral Region\n\nMidwest Division\n\nBlue Ridge Division\n\nNorthern Region\n\nGreat Lakes Division\n\nKeystone Division\n\nPremier Corridor[]\n\nThe Premier Corridor is Norfolk Southern's principal east–west line from the East Coast to the Midwest. An average day sees 40-60 trains of all types. The main (New York to Chicago) segment of the corridor consists of the Lehigh Line, Reading Line, Harrisburg Line, Pittsburgh Line, Fort Wayne Line, Cleveland Line, and Chicago Line.\n\nChicago Bypass[]\n\nMain article: Kankakee Belt Route\n\nMeridian Speedway[]\n\nMain article: Meridian Speedway\n\nPan Am Southern/Patriot Corridor[]\n\nOn May 15, 2008, NS announced that it would join with Pan Am Railways to create the \"Patriot Corridor\", an improved rail route between Albany, New York, and the greater Boston, Massachusetts, area. On March 12, 2009, STB approved the deal. Each of the two companies now owns 50% of a new company known as Pan Am Southern (PAS). PAR's trackage between Ayer, Massachusetts, and Mechanicville, New York, was transferred to PAS, and continues to be operated and maintained by PAR's Springfield Terminal Railway Company subsidiary. NS transferred to PAS cash and property valued at $140 million. The railroad operates 22K and 23K from Mechanicville, NY to Ayer, MA. Due to the unique ACSES PTC system used on Keolis-operated trackage, which the 22K and 23K runs on between Wachusett and Ayer, only specific SD60E locomotives equipped with ACSES can lead trains.\n\nIn 2021, CSX announced its intention to purchase Pan Am Railways. Norfolk Southern protested, arguing that CSX, which would own 50% of Pan Am Southern, would be able to block Norfolk Southern out of the northeast. As part of the Surface Transportation Board merger requirements, CSX will give NS limited trackage rights to run intermodal trains, and Pan Am Southern will be operated by the Pittsburg and Shawmut Railroad, under the name Berkshire and Eastern Railroad.\n\nYards and facilities[]\n\nMain article: List of Norfolk Southern Railway lines\n\nLargely an eastern U.S. railway, NS directly owns and operates 35600 miles of track in 22 states. It operates four primary hubs in its system: Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, Chicago, and Atlanta and maintains facilities across the Eastern US to facilitate operations, including rail classification yards, intermodal yards, and locomotive shops\n\nNS has rights to operate its trains with its own crews on competing railroads' tracks. These trackage rights permit NS to operate as far west as Dallas, Texas, on BNSF Railway tracks, as far north as Waterville, Maine, and as far south as Miami, Florida, on the Florida East Coast Railway tracks. NS locomotives also occasionally operate on competitors' tracks throughout the U.S. and Canada due to the practice of locomotive leasing and sharing undertaken by the Class I railroads. Not including second, third, and fourth main line trackage, yards, and sidings, NS directly operates 19420 miles of track. In addition, NS has direct control over approximately 35600 miles.\n\nGeneral freight classification yards[]\n\nAtlanta, GA - Inman Yard\n\nAllentown, PA\n\nAltoona, PA - Rose Yard\n\nChamblee, GA\n\nBaltimore, MD - Bayview Yard, Dundalk Yard and Sparrows Point Yard\n\nBellevue, OH - Moorman Yard\n\nBinghamton, NY - East Binghamton Yard\n\nBirmingham, AL\n\nBuffalo, NY - Bison Yard, SK Yard\n\nChattanooga, TN - Debutts Yard\n\nChicago, IL\n\nCincinnati, OH - Gest St. Yard\n\nCleveland, OH - Rockport Yard\n\nColumbus, OH\n\nConway, PA – Conway Yard\n\nDayton, OH\n\nDecatur, IL\n\nDetroit, MI\n\nElrama, PA - Shire Oaks Yard\n\nElkhart, IN\n\nHarrisburg, PA - Enola Yard\n\nKansas City, MO\n\nLinwood, NC - Spencer Yard\n\nLouisville, KY\n\nMacon, GA - Brosnan Yard\n\nNewark, NJ - Oak Island Yard\n\nNorfolk, VA\n\nRoanoke, VA\n\nSheffield, AL\n\nSt. Louis, MO - Luther Yard\n\nSavannah, GA - Dillard Yard\n\nIntermodal classification yards[]\n\nAtlanta, GA - Inman Yard\n\nAustell, GA (Whitaker)\n\nAyer, MA (Pan Am Southern)\n\nBaltimore, MD\n\nBethlehem, PA\n\nBuffalo, NY - Bison Yard\n\nBluefield, WV\n\nCharlotte, NC\n\nChesapeake, VA – Portlock\n\nChicago, IL – 47th Street\n\nChicago, IL – 63rd Street\n\nChicago, IL – Calumet\n\nChicago, IL – Landers\n\nCincinnati, OH – Gest Street\n\nCleveland, OH – Maple Heights\n\nColumbus, OH\n\nDallas, TX – KCS\n\nDecatur, IL\n\nDetroit, MI – Delray\n\nDetroit, MI – Livernois\n\nElizabeth, NJ – Elizabeth Marine Terminal\n\nElizabeth, NJ – E-Rail\n\nFront Royal, VA\n\nGarden City, GA – Garden City Marine Terminal (Savannah)\n\nGeorgetown, KY\n\nGreencastle, PA – Franklin County Regional Intermodal Facility\n\nGreensboro, NC\n\nGreer, SC – South Carolina Inland Port\n\nHarrisburg, PA – Harrisburg Intermodal Yard\n\nHarrisburg, PA – Rutherford Intermodal Yard\n\nHuntsville, AL\n\nJacksonville, FL - Simpson Yard\n\nJersey City, NJ - Croxton Yard\n\nKansas City, MO\n\nLanghorne, PA - Morrisville Yard\n\nLouisville, KY – Appliance Park\n\nLouisville, KY – Buechel\n\nMaple Heights, OH (Cleveland)\n\nMcCalla, AL (Birmingham)\n\nMechanicville, NY (Albany)\n\nMemphis, TN – Harris Yard\n\nNorfolk, VA – Norfolk International Terminals\n\nNorth Charleston, SC (Charleston)\n\nNew Orleans, LA - Oliver Yard\n\nPortsmouth, VA – APM Terminal\n\nRossville, TN - Rossville Intermodal Facility\n\nSavannah, GA – Mason Yard (connection to Savannah Port Terminal Railroad)\n\nSharonville, OH (Cincinnati)\n\nSt. Louis, MO\n\nTaylor, PA (Scranton)\n\nToledo, OH - Airline Yard\n\nWall, PA (Pittsburgh)\n\nLocomotive shops[]\n\nAtlanta, GA - Inman Yard\n\nAltoona, PA – Altoona Works\n\nBellevue, OH (Closed in 2020 due to PSR changes)\n\nChattanooga, TN\n\nConway, PA – Conway Yard\n\nElkhart, IN\n\nHarrisburg, PA – Enola Yard\n\nRoanoke, VA – Shaffer's Crossing Locomotive Shop\n\nRoanoke, VA – Roanoke Locomotive Shop (Closed in 2020 due to PSR changes)\n\nNS also shares interest with CSX in the Oak Island Yard, managed by Conrail Shared Assets Operations in Newark, New Jersey.\n\nEnvironmental record[]\n\nOn January 6, 2005, a NS derailment resulted in a large amount of chlorine and diesel fuel being released into nearby waterways in Graniteville, South Carolina. In addition, a toxic cloud covered the city resulting in the town being evacuated. Federal common carrier laws prevent railroads from refusing to transport chlorine and similar Toxic Inhalation Hazard (TIH) commodities. Local wildlife was killed, many of the local crops and vegetation were contaminated or killed, nine human deaths were reported, and thousands were injured. The company was taken to court and fined for violating the Clean Water Act and the Federal Superfund law. NS spent a total of $26 million for the cleanup.\n\nIn early spring of 2008, the state program manager for air quality planning in Georgia, Jimmy Johnston, had been talking to NS about voluntary upgrades to reduce the company's environmental impact. NS is upgrading 3,800 of its locomotives with new technology that is 73 percent more efficient than previous models. The new technology being put into the locomotives is making the ride more fuel efficient and reducing idle time.\n\nNS has also introduced an experimental battery-electric switcher locomotive, NS 999. This prototype locomotive was developed by Norfolk Southern, in collaboration with the United States Department of Energy, the Federal Railroad Administration and the Pennsylvania State University.\n\nLabor relations[]\n\nIn 2019, Norfolk Southern made a plan to lay off over 3,500 workers as a result of precision railroading.\n\nLocomotives and rolling stock[]\n\nPaint and colors[]\n\nNS's locomotives are often called \"catfish\" by railfans, as the stripes are said to look like catfish whiskers.\n\nThe current \"Horsehead\" paint scheme for NS locomotives is black and white, with yellow grab irons and step-edge highlights. Locomotives feature a rearing horse decal enclosed in the \"catfish\" stripes on both the nose and rear, which is consistent with marketing campaigns where NS has billed itself as \"The Thoroughbred of Transportation\".\n\nThe first few AC44C6Ms features a special version of the Horsehead scheme, which is painted for the D.C. To A.C. Project. The others retain the regular paint job. The GE AC44C6Ms are rebuilt from GE Dash 9-40Cs.\n\nIn 1994, EMD GP59 No. 4610 was painted in predecessor Southern colors of green and white with gold trim and was a favorite of railfans. The locomotive was repainted in the Norfolk Southern \"Operation Lifesaver\" paint in February 2012 because of ES44AC #8099 also being in Southern paint.\n\nNorfolk Southern painted 20 new-order ES44ACs and SD70ACes in commemorative heritage paint schemes as part of NS's 30th anniversary celebration in 2012 (more info below in the \"Heritage Schemes\" section).\n\nNorfolk Southern also has many locomotives painted in various versions of the Operation Lifesaver scheme.\n\nIn February 2015, Norfolk Southern unveiled restored NS 3170 in the Southern Railway \"Tuxedo\" paint scheme. The 3170 is a SD40, the first ordered by the Southern Railway and was retired by Norfolk Southern in 2007. In September 2015, SD45-2 1700 was unveiled wearing its original Erie Lackawanna paint. Another SD40, NS 1580, was set aside for repaint into its original Norfolk and Western paint scheme. On 3/8/24, NS 1580 left the Norfolk Southern Juanita Shops and is (allegedly) heading to the Tennessee Valley Railroad Museum.\n\nIn January 2015, the first of the state-funded \"ECO Class\" units – painted in a two-tone green, white, and black paint scheme – was completed. \"ECO\" locomotives thus far (January 2017) include GP33ECO and SD33ECO; additionally, these units come with 'slug' types: RP-M4C (GP33ECO) and RPU6D (SD33ECO).\n\nIn November 2011, Norfolk Southern unveiled SD60E 6920 – painted in a blue, red, white and black \"Honoring our Veterans\" paint scheme. In March 2013, Norfolk Southern released NS SD60E 6963, which was painted in a special paint scheme for \"GORAIL.\" In May 2015, Norfolk Southern unveiled another SD60E, number 911 – painted in a red, white, and gold, \"Honoring First Responders\" paint scheme.\n\nLocomotives[]\n\nA large majority of Norfolk Southern's locomotives come from the company's many predecessors, which include but are not limited to Norfolk and Western, Southern Railway, and Conrail. Of the engines from Norfolk and Western (NW) and Southern, many were equipped with high short hoods. Although these locomotives are aging, some 'high hoods' still remain on the roster as of April 2020. Norfolk Southern has drastically reduced the number of them by scrapping, rebuilding, or selling them.\n\nHistorically, NS has only purchased DC traction diesel locomotives, and was one of the last North American AC-traction hold-outs aside from Canadian National Railway. In September 2008, however, NS placed its first order for new AC traction locomotives: 23 GE ES44ACs, numbered 8000-8023. In the years since, NS has purchased several more ES44ACs as well as over 150 EMD SD70ACes.\n\nBeginning in 2012, Norfolk Southern began to take delivery of several types of older EMD locomotives from various railroads and leasing companies, including 9 ex-BNSF \"tri-clops\" SD60Ms, 6 ex-ATSF (BNSF) SD75Ms, the remaining 12 ex-Conrail SD80MACs owned by CSX, a majority of Union Pacific's SD9043MACs, and more than 130 SD40-2's from First Union Rail, CIT Group, and Helm Leasing.\n\nNorfolk Southern is the only railroad ever to own SD80MACs and SD90MACs simultaneously. Norfolk Southern owned all of the SD80MACs and 110 of the SD90MACs from Union Pacific. Norfolk Southern also acquired 10 SD90MACs from CIT Group in exchange for 15 MP15DCs. The SD90MACs have been rebuilt into SD70ACUs. By late 2021, the SD80MACs were been sold (most scrapped), and most of the EMD SD70ACus were sold.\n\nNorfolk Southern has a very large program for re-cabbing locomotives. NS has its own designed \"Admiral Cab,\" which they use on their 'standard cab' rebuilds. NS has rebuilt GP38-2s, SD40-2s, ECO units, and many more with the Admiral Cab.\n\nIn 2015, Norfolk Southern began a program to convert their reliable, but aging GE Dash 8-40Cs into Dash 8.5-40CW units (NS calls them D8.5-40CW). The few units that were upgraded included new cabs, rebuilt and modified engine, electrical upgrades and more. Due to repeated failures, the program was deemed unsuccessful in 2016, and ET44AC units were ordered to replace the un-rebuildable 8-40Cs. The Dash 8.5s have since been sold.\n\nIn 2016, NS bought 46 GE ET44AC Locomotives, also known as Tier 4 Locomotives, numbered 3600-3646. These are the first Tier 4 road engines purchased, and not immediately stored, by NS. Norfolk Southern purchased 34 more units, delivered in 2017. The ET44ACs were purchased as the replacement for the Dash 8-40C units, all of which were sold shortly after the ET44ACs entered service. They were the first order of new locomotives from NS since late 2014, when EPA Tier 4 requirements were put in place.\n\nIn 2016, Norfolk Southern began a rebuild program on the Dash 9-40C units. The rebuild involved overhaul of the engine, emissions upgrades, a new cab (featuring GE Trip Optimizer, PTC, and NS Cab Signals / Locomotive Speed Limiter), new electronics, DPU and ECP capabilities, increased weight, and an electric parking brake. Norfolk Southern has rebuilt all the C40-9 \"Top Hats\" and some of the Dash 9-44CWs. The new locomotives are being classified as GE AC44C6M.\n\nHeritage fleet[]\n\nIn the first half of 2012, Norfolk Southern painted 10 EMD SD70ACes and 10 GE ES44ACs as special heritage units, each bearing the paint schemes and markings of the various predecessor railroads of Norfolk Southern and Conrail. On July 1–3, 2012, all 20 units gathered together at the North Carolina Transportation Museum at Spencer, North Carolina, as the highlight of NS's 30th-anniversary celebration. The locomotives have since traveled throughout the United States on various Class I railroads as run-through pool power, attracting much attention from railfans.\n\nThe Heritage Units include:\n\nCentral of Georgia (GE ES44AC) #8101\n\nCentral Railroad of New Jersey (EMD SD70ACe) #1071\n\nConrail (\"Big Blue\") (GE ES44AC) #8098 (Storage)\n\nDelaware, Lackawanna, & Western (EMD SD70ACe) #1074\n\nErie (EMD SD70ACe) #1068\n\nLehigh Valley Railroad (Red) (GE ES44AC) #8104\n\nIllinois Terminal Railroad (EMD SD70ACe) #1072\n\nInterstate Railroad (GE ES44AC) #8105\n\nMonongahela Railway (GE ES44AC) #8025\n\nNew York Central Railroad (EMD SD70ACe) #1066\n\nNickel Plate Road (GE ES44AC) #8100\n\nNorfolk & Western (Blue \"Hamburger\" Logo) (GE ES44AC) #8103\n\nNorfolk Southern (Original) (GE ES44AC) #8114\n\nPenn Central (EMD SD70ACe) #1073\n\nPennsylvania Railroad (Tuscan Red) (GE ES44AC) #8102\n\nReading Company (Bee Line) (EMD SD70ACe) #1067\n\nSavannah & Atlanta (Tuxedo Black scheme) (EMD SD70ACe) #1065\n\nSouthern (Crescent Green scheme) (GE ES44AC) #8099\n\nVirginian (EMD SD70ACe) #1069\n\nWabash Railroad (EMD SD70ACe) #1070\n\nErie Lackawanna (EMD SD45-2) #1700\n\nSteam excursion programs[]\n\nMain article: 21st Century Steam\n\nAfter the 1982 merger, NS President Robert Claytor retained the Southern Railway's steam excursion program begun in the 1960s by his brother, SOU president W. Graham Claytor. NS initially used former Chesapeake and Ohio 2716, which had been modified and decorated as a Southern locomotive for the steam program; however the engine developed with mechanical problems in her fire box after less than a year in excursion service and was replaced by Nickel Plate 765.\n\nMerging with the Norfolk & Western Railway prompted the steam program to acquire and overhaul Norfolk & Western 611 in 1982, and Norfolk & Western 1218 in 1987. These two locomotives and 765 joined the steam program veterans – Southern Railway 4501, Savannah and Atlanta Railway 750, Nickel Plate 587, Louisville & Nashville 152, Atlanta and West Point 290, Tennessee Valley Railroad 610, and Frisco 1522 – for an extensive series of excursions throughout the late 1980s and early 1990s.\n\nNorfolk Southern's management under David R. Goode was forced to end the program in late 1994 citing safety concerns, rising insurance costs, the expense of maintaining the steam locomotives, and decreasing rail network availability due to a surge in freight traffic. On December 3, 1994, the 611 became the last steam locomotive running on Norfolk Southern's trackage, running her last steam-powered excursion round-trip between Birmingham, Alabama, and Chattanooga, Tennessee. After that, the 611 went on a three-day ferry move from Birmingham to Roanoke, Virginia. She stopped at Atlanta, Georgia, for the night on December 5 and next to Salisbury, NC the next day on December 6. Finally, the 611 departed Salisbury and continued her final trip. When the locomotive arrived back in Roanoke, 611 had its fire put out for the last time.\n\nIn June 2010, Norfolk Southern CEO Wick Moorman announced that NS would run excursions with Southern Railway 4501, Southern Railway 630, and U.S. Army 610 with their new 21st Century Steam program.\n\nThe program began in 2011 with excursions in the south powered by 630 and in the north by 765. On February 22, 2013, the Virginia Museum of Transportation (611's owner) formed a campaign called \"Fire Up 611!\" to conduct a feasibility study with the goal of returning the 611 to active service and have it join the program. The locomotive was removed from her static display from the Virginia Museum of Transportation to the North Carolina Transportation Museum in 2014 to be overhauled. That same year, TVRM completed their restoration of Southern Railway 4501 – joining the 21st Century Steam program for the 2015 season and pulling excursions in Tennessee, Virginia, and Georgia. The restoration of 611 was completed in May 2015 and celebrated with a run to Roanoke, Virginia, where it was originally built. The 611 pulled several excursions in Virginia and was featured in special events at the North Carolina Transportation Museum. In December 2015, Norfolk Southern had concluded their program; however, the 611 continued to run various excursions, hosted by the Virginia Museum of Transportation and the North Carolina Transportation Museum instead of Norfolk Southern across the NS system in Virginia and North Carolina. Norfolk Southern currently limits the steam locomotives up to Template:Convert on their system.\n\nRolling stock[]\n\n2018 NS Rolling Stock Type Owned Leased Total Total Capacity (Tons) Gondola 24,768 4,048 28,816 3,205,609 Hopper 11,001 0 11,001 1,244,016 Covered hopper 8,323 85 8,408 932,767 Box 7,125 1,251 8,376 726,694 Flat 1,685 1,608 3,293 312,537 Other 1,597 4 1,601 73,203 Total 54,499 6,996 61,495 6,494,826\n\nReporting marks[]\n\nAlthough it has been widely known as simply \"Norfolk Southern\" since 1982, the corporate structure and reporting marks are more complicated. In 1999, when most of Conrail's former PRR trackage was sold to the Norfolk Southern Railway, the Pennsylvania Railway Lines was created and PRR reporting marks used on the former Conrail motive power and rolling stock.\n\nAGS - Alabama Great Southern Railroad\n\nCG sometimes CofG - Central of Georgia Railway\n\nCNTP - Cincinnati, New Orleans and Texas Pacific Railway (CNO&TP)\n\nCR - Conrail\n\nGANO - Georgia Northern Railway\n\nNKP - Nickel Plate Road\n\nPRR - Pennsylvania Lines LLC (used on ex-Conrail locomotives)\n\nNS - Norfolk Southern\n\nNW - Norfolk and Western Railway\n\nSOU - Southern Railway\n\nTAG - Tennessee, Alabama and Georgia Railway\n\nVGN - Virginian Railway\n\nWAB - Wabash Railroad\n\nTelevision commercials[]\n\nOn September 3, 2007, NS launched a television ad featuring a family of gas cans trekking to meet a NS train, meant to underscore the railroad's role in reducing highway congestion. Shot in Virginia's Shenandoah Valley, it features the song \"You Don't Need Me\" written and performed for NS by Ravi Krishnaswami of New York and Steve Kolander of Atlanta. On National Train Day in May 2013, NS premiered a new ad series, using music adapted from \"Conjunction Junction\" from ABC's School House Rock series, and showing an overhead view of Inman Rail Yard in Atlanta.\n\nAwards and recognition[]\n\nFrom 1989 to 2012, NS won the Gold (first-place) E.H. Harriman Award in Group A (line-haul railroads whose employees worked 15 million employee-hours or more) every single year. The award, which recognized the railroads with the lowest casualty rates per 200,000 employee-hours, was discontinued in 2012.\n\nIn January 2011, NS Chairman and CEO Wick Moorman was named Railroader of the Year by Railway Age magazine.\n\nGeorge Vandergriff, along with Wick Moorman, were two of the honorary inductees of the inaugural NS Hall of Fame class.\n\nSee also[]\n\nHistory of railroads in Michigan\n\nSouthern Railway's Spencer Shops (now a museum in Salisbury, North Carolina)\n\nList of Norfolk Southern predecessor railroads\n\nThoroughbred Shortline Program\n\nImprovement projects[]\n\nCrescent Corridor - Louisiana to New Jersey\n\nHeartland Corridor - Midwest to Norfolk\n\n[]"
