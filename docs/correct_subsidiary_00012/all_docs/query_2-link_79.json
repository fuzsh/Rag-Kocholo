        "text": "This article is about the rail company that has existed since 1982. For the historical railway, see Norfolk Southern Railway (1942–1982).\n\nThe Norfolk Southern Railway (reporting mark NS) is a Class I freight railroad operating in the Eastern United States. Headquartered in Atlanta, the company was formed in 1982 with the merger of the Norfolk and Western Railway and Southern Railway.[4] The company operates 19,420 route miles (31,250 km) in 22 eastern states, the District of Columbia,[5] and has rights in Canada over the Albany to Montreal route of the Canadian Pacific Kansas City.[6][7] Norfolk Southern Railway is the leading subsidiary of the Norfolk Southern Corporation.\n\nQuick Facts Company type, Traded as ...\n\nClose\n\nNorfolk Southern is responsible for maintaining 28,400 miles (45,700 km), with the remainder being operated under trackage rights from other parties responsible for maintenance work.[8] Intermodal containers and trailers are the most common commodity type carried by NS, which have grown as the coal business has declined throughout the 21st century; coal was formerly the largest traffic source. The railway offers the largest intermodal rail network in eastern North America.[9] NS was also the pioneer of Roadrailer service. Norfolk Southern and its chief competitor, CSX Transportation, have a duopoly on the transcontinental freight rail lines in the Eastern United States."
