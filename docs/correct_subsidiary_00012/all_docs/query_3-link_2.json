        "text": "Thanks to the dedication and hard work of our railroaders, the Keystone Division has made significant improvements in safety, service, and performance. 👏 Spanning across Delaware, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, parts of Ohio, Virginia, and West Virginia, the Keystone Division has achieved across-the-board gains so far in 2024, including: 🦺 Maintaining longstanding injury free records in Keystone’s local districts, including Lake Erie District (11 years), Buffalo Line District (10 years), Mingo Junction (4 years), and Crestline District (over 1,000 days). 🚂 Origin performance stands at 81%, reflecting the on-time departure of scheduled trains from their originating terminal. 🛤️ The division’s AAR Dwell time average is at 21.0 hours, which is at goal while train speed is at 24.11. 📊 Connection performance, which measures arrivals and departures of the right car on the right train on the right date, is at 89%. Our Transportation, Mechanical, Engineering, and Dispatch teams are enhancing cohesion and achieving even more, together. 🔗 Learn more at https://lnkd.in/eX9Bcw3z. Pictured here: A mixed-freight train crossing the Tunkhannock Creek Viaduct in Nicholson, Pennsylvania.\n\nHave you ever wanted to see inside the tunnel at Natural Tunnel State Park in Duffield, Virginia? This Saturday, July 20, from 9am to 3pm, is your chance! For one day only, all train traffic will stop, allowing you to walk through the tunnel and see our equipment on display. Explore the park and enjoy the views our crews have as they roll through the tunnel. At the event, you can also learn about Norfolk Southern's history in the area and how to stay safe around railroads. 🔗 Visit https://bit.ly/3WqN75E for more details.\n\nTeam NS is always innovating and making operational improvements across our network. 🚂 Superintendent of Mechanical Operations Joe Wick had an idea to increase efficiency at Conway Terminal in Pennsylvania. By repurposing under-utilized tracks, the team could streamline our repair process and get bad order cars back into service faster. (In case you didn't know, a “bad order\" is when a car inspector finds a car that needs to be repaired before it can leave the facility.) Our Transportation, Mechanical, and Engineering teams came together to turn Joe's vision into a reality! The results? ✅ Reduced dwell time ✅ Improved cycle time by 30 percent ✅ Increased shop throughput for car repairs At NS, we're working every day to provide even better, safer, and more reliable service for our customers.\n\nWe love to see the impact of our Safety First and Thriving Communities grants in communities across our 22-state network. In Cleveland, Tennessee, grant recipient CITY FIELDS is empowering residents with career and job-readiness training for individuals facing barriers to employment. With their grant, City Fields was able to provide three scholarships for their welding bootcamp, allowing students to earn an American Welding Society (AWS) certification through their workforce development training program. 🔗 Learn more at https://lnkd.in/eXMxPvjB.\n\nWe're excited to announce the release of our 2024 Forging A Better Tomorrow Report! 🚂📙 In our report, you’ll find the progress we’ve made to advance environmental stewardship, improve safety, invest in our employees and communities, drive economic growth, and more. 🔗 Read the full report at https://lnkd.in/epKGpdg8. Together, all 20,000 of us on Team NS are dedicated to forging A Better Way – for our planet, our people, and our communities.\n\nOur railroaders make a difference that extends beyond the freight we move. At NS, we know the service we provide our customers affects their operations, employees, and communities across our network. For Locomotive Engineer Chris Shirley, that reality motivates him every day – and his dedication to providing outstanding service caught the attention of our customer, Scruggs Blending & Packaging LLC, in Villa Rica, Georgia. “We do business with dozens of vendors on a daily, real-time basis, and it is extraordinarily rare that we run across an employee of another company that shows the commitment and caring that Chris does in supporting our business,” said Tom Adams, Chief Operating Officer of Scruggs Blending and Packaging. “Literally speaking, it gives us comfort knowing Chris is on the job and cares about the outcomes that affect our business.” Thank you, Chris, for leading by example, always going above and beyond for our customers, and inspiring us all to “be good today and better tomorrow!” #ThankARailroader"
