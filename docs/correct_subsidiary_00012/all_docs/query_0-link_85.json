        "text": "Tag Archives: Conrail\n\nConrail Local on the Franklin Branch\n\nFollowing up on Saturday’s post of the MBTA at Norfolk, Massachusetts, I thought I’d post this photo that I made of a Conrail local working at Franklin, Massachusetts in November 1984.\n\nThis is looking west where the tracks run parallel with East Street, at the junction between former New Haven Railroad’s New York & New England route running west toward Willimantic, Connecticut and the New Haven Branch to Milford, Massachusetts (since upgraded for MBTA service to Forge Park/495.)\n\nI’d exposed this photograph on black & white film using a Leica 3A rangefinder fitted with a Canon screw mount 50mm f1.8 lens. For a few months, I used the Canon lens as a replacment for my Leica 50mm f2.0 Summitar that I’d damaged.\n\nThe Canon lens was faster than the Summitar but lacked the critical sharpness of the Leica lens. As a result, this period of photography has great interest to me in regards to subject matter, but suffers from inferior technical quality than some of my earlier work.\n\nIt took a few years, but ultimately I made significant changes in the equipment that I was using that greatly improved the technical quality of my photograhy.\n\nTracking the Light Posts Daily!\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nBrief Visit to a Familiar Place\n\nOver the years, I’ve exposed thousands of railroad photos in Palmer, Massachusetts. I started photographing there in 1977.\n\nKris and I paid a brief visit to Palmer on our trip to Massachusetts in mid-June. This was primarily a social call, and we had limited time to look at the railroad, but we made a few photos in Palmer at familiar places.\n\nFor me, Palmer was in its heyday in the mid-1990s, when Conrail was at its zenith running about 15 freights daily in each direction, and Central Vermont/New England Central could be found working the yards here at any hour of the day or night; when Amtrak operated 6-8 trains daily through Palmer, and the Mass-Central had a busy intermodal container facility in town.\n\nIt is much quieter these days. We didn’t see a wheel turn, although Genesee & Wyoming’s New England Central had several locomotives at the ready in its yard.\n\nThe undergrowth has encroached and there are leafy vines getting ever closer to the tracks. Yet, I was happy to see a set of new CSX gondolas in the NECR yard carrying large pieces of stone.\n\nPhotos exposed using my Nikon Z7-II with 24-70mm lens.\n\n(For old time sake, I also took a couple of color slides).\n\nTracking the Light Posts Daily!\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nA Different Lancaster\n\n8:50 am, October 3, 1987.\n\nI was following the old Erie Railroad toward Buffalo and overtook a freight that had stopped a red signal.\n\nThis was Conrail’s OIBU and the location was East Lancaster, New York. I made a single Kodachrome 25 slide with my Leica M2 fitted with a 200mm Leitz Telyt lens mounted via a Visoflex and positioned on a tripod. My exposure was f4 at 1/15th of a second.\n\nNot long after the slide came back from processing, I labled it. However at some point there after, I deemed this image unworthy and tucked it back into one of the many Kodak yellow slide boxes labled ‘2nds,’ where it resided for the last 36+ years in my parents attic.\n\nI scanned it the other day, then imported the scan into Lightroom to correct for level, exposure and excessive cyan tint. The photograph has aged well! However the pole to the immediate left of the locomotive cab has always annoyed me.\n\nTracking the Light Posts Daily!\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nStacks on the old Erie Railroad—36 Years ago\n\n3:36pm, May 14, 1988; milepost 309 (as measured west from Jersey City) near Cameron Mills, N.Y., Conrail intermodal train TV-301.\n\nI exposed this photo in the reverse curves along Conrail’s former Erie Railroad mainline in New York’s scenic Canisteo River Valley east of Cameron Mills.\n\nIn the late 1980s, this valley was a favorite place of mine for photographing trains, and I made dozens of trips along the old Erie Railroad during those years.\n\nThis image was exposed on Professional Kodachrome 25 using my Leica M2 rangefinder fitted with a Leitz Wetzlar Elmarit 135mm lens.\n\nMy exposure was f4.5 1.250th second. While this was my standard ‘full sun’ daylight setting, the resulting slide was about 1/2 stop too dark. This was in part because of the reduced reflective light within the confines of the valley combined with slight backlighting of the train.\n\nAfter scanning using a Nikon LS-5000 (Supe Coolscan5000) slide scanner, I made a variety of small adjustments to TIF file in regards to color balance/color temperature, exposure and constrast using Lightroom to produce a more pleasing photograph.\n\nOne element of this image that’s always annoyed me is the automobile peaking out on the left side of the leading locomotive. It would be a better photo if the automobile was further ahead of the train or totally conceiled by it.\n\nThis is a small defect, considering that Conrail (as a class 1 railroad) has been gone nearly 25 years.\n\nTracking the Light Posts Daily!\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nCorrecting a Camel Crossing the Connecticut\n\nAt 11:35am on August 18, 1988, I photographed Conrail C32-8 6616 leading MBSE (Middleboro to Selkirk, otherwise known as ‘The Queen’) across the former Boston & Albany bridge over the Connecticut River.\n\nThe C32-8s were among the GE’s known as ‘Camels’ because of their humpback appearance.\n\nThese were called ‘Classics’ by the folks at GE to distinguish them from the more Spartan DASH-8s produced later.\n\nI’d parked my Dodge Dart in the riverside lot off Route 5, and made my way down to water level, where I exposed this Professional Kodachrome 25 slides.\n\nHowever, in trying to get as close to the water as possible (without falling in), I managed to lose my sense of level, and the resulting image was several degrees off-axis.\n\nFor many years this slide was relegated to binder of my ‘seconds’.\n\nThe other night I scanned the slide, corrected the level and improved the color balance. (Professional Kodachrome had a tendency to shift toward the red).\n\nTracking the Light Posts Daily!\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nConrail Evolution Surprise!\n\nI was surprised to hear a whistle to the west, when we were exploring the Shikellamy State Park along the Susquehanna River near Sunbury, Pa.\n\nThen when the train came into view on the far side of the river, I had vivid sense of Conrail-blue deja vu.\n\nThe last time, I’d visited this bridge, photographer Mike Gardner and I had caught the eastward Norfolk Southern freight symbol 13W led by a former Conrail GE C40-8 still in the classic Conrail paint, and then a little while later, we photographed the westward NS 41T with Canadian National locomotives. But that was back in November 2001!\n\nFast forward: Conrail’s days as an independant Class I carrier are now a quarter century behind us, so what was this modern GE in blue paint Kris and I saw last week?\n\nAs the unit coal train (NS 632) rolled across the multiple-span truss bridge, I realized what I was looking at:\n\nNorfolk Southern’s specially painted Conrail heritage locomotive! This is a General Electric ES44AC, engine number 8098, an Evolution-series 4,400 hp low-emissions diesel-electric.\n\nConrail never owned anything quite so advanced.\n\nI made my photos and then Kris and I decided to follow the train back down NS’s Buffalo Line. This was a rare find! It was our lucky day! Lucky!\n\nI had a couple of prime locations in mind, if we could only stay ahead of the train!\n\nTracking the Light Posts Daily!\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nSolving a Plus-X Mystery\n\nAmong my thousands of black & white negatives is a three-ring binder that is largely filled with film exposed for class projects and related photographic studies when I was a student at the Rochester Institute of Technology.\n\nThe other night I located a processed, sleeved and completely unlabled roll of Kodak Plus-X. Most of the film was of Conrail trains on the former Erie Railroad in the vicinity of Hornell, NY.\n\nIn the late 1980s, I regularly frequented New York’s Southern Tier to make photos. Over the course of about five years I made dozens of trips.\n\nI have detailed photo notes from many of these trips, so while scanning the negatives with my Epson V600 scanner, I started to solve the mystery.\n\nI recalled the day in question, but couldn’t remember exactly when it was. The sky was gray and the landscape bare, so I surmised it was early 1989. The challenge was figuring out which day, since between November 1988 and early May 1989, I made more than a dozen trips through this area.\n\nKey to the mystery were the trains. I typically logged passing trains by leading locomotive and train symbol, while keeping track of film type, exposure notes, the time, along with other relevant details.\n\nConrail SD50 6746 was a clue. This was leading a westward freight. Another clue were the semaphores at milepost 337, located just west of the village of Arkport, NY. Conrail 3171 led an eastward freight and these details helped me locate the correct log sheet.\n\nMy notes from January 14, 1989 put most of the remaining pieces together and I labled both the original negative sheet with date and locations, while scanning and labeling the negatives.\n\nAlthough it wasn’t noted, I recall that the black & white photos on that day were made with my father’s Leica double-stroke M3 rangefinder. I used my own Leica M2 to expose color slides.\n\nTracking the Light Posts Daily!\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nSunny Morning at Creek Hill Road\n\nA ten minute drive will take me to the Creek Hill Road crossing of Norfolk Southern’s New Holland Branch.\n\nI’d been eyeing this location for a few months. Finally on a bright morning, I timed it right to catch the New Holland local freight with a pair of SD40E (former SD50) diesels in classic three-quarter sunlight.\n\nI exposed a couple of Provia 100F color slides, which I am waiting to be returned from the lab. Then I used my Nikon Z7-II to make a series of images of the passing train.\n\nThese are part of my ongoing Conrail SD50 retrospective. These locomotives were built between 1983 and 1986, the first of which were delivered during my senior year at Monson Jr-Sr High School. I think it’s really neat that these familiar aged beasts regularly pass near my new home.\n\nNothing lasts forever, and I wonder how much longer I’ll have the opportunity to catch the old Conrail locomotives on the move!\n\nTracking the Light Posts Every Day!\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nThe SD50—my first glimpse\n\nIn January 1984, I’d driven my parent’s 1978 gray Ford Grenada to Palmer, Massachusetts.\n\nA set of Conrail light engines blitzed past me, and I chased after them.\n\nIn consist was a couple of brand-new EMD SD50s and a few new GE B36-7s.\n\nThis was pretty exciting stuff! I was 17 at the time.\n\nI chased east on Routes 20 and 67. At Kings Bridge Road east of Palmer I turned toward Conrail’s Boston & Albany line, but the Conrail engines were too close for me to get a lineside photo. So, I stopped the car in the middle of the road, raised my 1930s-era Leica IIIA and shot through the windshield of the Ford.\n\nMy camera was loaded with Kodak Tri-X— film that I later processed in Kodak Microdol-X developer.\n\nTracking the Light Looks Back 40 years!\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nClassic Kodachrome—Conrail 6717 leads TV9 at milepost 123.\n\nIf I wrote: ‘6717 WB w TV9 mp123 11-13-92’ would it mean anything to anyone but me?\n\nIt was a clear morning in November 1992. I’d set up west of Huntington, Massachusetts on Conrail’s Boston Line—the former Boston & Albany mainline grade over Washington Hill.\n\nAt that time, intermodal freight TV9 (Beacon Park, Boston to Chicago) routinely made its westward passage through the Berkshires in the morning.\n\nOn this particular day, the train was led by SD50 6717. While not unheard of, this was uncommon power for TV9, as in the early 1990s Conrail typically assigned sets of three and four GE C30-7A, C32-8 and C36-7 diesels to most of its Boston Line road freights.\n\nKodachrome 25 was my standard film. This traditional emulsion made it possible to expose dramatic backlit photos such this one. The nature of the grain structure and Kodachrome process, allowed the film to retain a degree of highlight detail while maintaining a clean edge between light and dark, even in high contrast situations such as this one.\n\nWorking with the locomotive exhaust and headlight, I made this dramatic silhouette of the train ascending the grade against a stark autumnal background.\n\nI was working with my Nikon F3T with Nikkor 200mm lens set to f5.6 at 1/125th of second. To minimize flare, I shaded the front element of the lens with my notebook.\n\nToday, the lack of ditchlights really dates the image. By the mid-1990s, ditch lights were standard on most locomotives.\n\nThe time was 8:10am. Conrail’s westbound TV9 met the eastbound SEFR near CP123 (just around the bend from my location). The eastbound passed me nine minutes later.\n\nTracking the Light Posts Every Day!\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nAmtrak 448 at the Warren Crossovers—1983.\n\nThis was a just a routine scene from 40 years ago: Amtrak’s eastward Lake Shore Limited (Boston section) train 448 at the Warren Crossovers.\n\nBack in the days when Conrail’s former Boston & Albany was still operated as a traditional directional double-track mainline (under rule 251), there were manual cross-overs at strategic locations, including Warren, Mass.\n\nHistorically (pre-1960), the Warren Crossovers also served the Warren Yard and the long unsignaled eastward running track from West Warren that had allowed slow moving freights to keep out of the way of faster eastward trains.\n\nThese crossovers were removed after Conrail installed TCS signals and single-tracked the B&A east of Palmer in 1986.\n\nI made these photos on Kodachrome using my Leica 3A during the second week of October 1983.\n\nTracking the Light Posts Daily!\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nClassic Chrome—Cass Street Hornell\n\nHere’s another classic K25 slide from that wonderfully perfect autumn day on October 14, 1988.\n\nI’d been following Delaware & Hudson PLMT (Pittsburgh & Lake Erie-Mount Tom) unit coal train that was rolling east on Conrail’s Southern Tier (former Erie Railroad) main line.\n\nThe old Cass Street Tower had controlled the Junction where the original Erie Maine Line that went west via Andover, New York diverged from Erie’s Buffalo Line that went via River Junction and Attica, New York. By 1988, the Buffalo Line was the preferred route for most freights.\n\nDelaware & Hudson had trackage rights on Conrail between Buffalo and Binghamton, NY. By mid-1988, Guilford Transportation Industries had relinquished control of the D&H, and New York, Susquehanna & Western was the court appointed operator of the line.\n\nNY&W had acquired a fleet of former Burlington Northern SD45/F45s that it assigned to road freights.\n\nI was fan of the SD45, and when I caught this coal train slogging east on the old Erie, I did my best to keep up with it, making photographs with my old Leica M2 along the way. This view at Cass Street was one of just 16 places I photographed the train that morning.\n\nTracking the Light Posts Every Day!\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nNS Local at Horseshoe Road\n\nLeaving the supermarket, I heard an engine sounding for Greenfield Road.\n\nIt was about the time I normally hear Norfolk Southern’s New Holland Branch local heads toward its Pennsylvania namesake.\n\nI drove via Hartman Station Road and spotted the train with an NS SD40E running long-hood first.\n\nTurning onto Horseshoe Road, I continued in the direction of the local freight’s eastward path.\n\nI arrived at the Horseshoe Road grade crossing with enough time to set up a shot looking across freshly mowed grass.\n\nTracking the Light Posts Daily!\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nAmtrak 915 in Delaware\n\nIn the fading of sun of December 22, 1992, I made this Kodachrome slide of Amtrak AEM-7 915 slowing for its Newark, Delaware station stop on its way toward Philadelphia and New York’s Penn-Station.

Finally, in my Erie box, I had my Eureka! moment when found what I’ve seeking:\n\nConrail SD50 6753 (now NS 6342) leading a freight in nice light. (See recent posts).\n\nThis was exposed at the grade crossing at East Hornell, New York. Conrail 6753 was leading BUOI-4X on January 14, 1989. The train had made a pick-up at M-K in Hornell consisting of recently rebuilt New York City subway cars and was about to make its move to go through the cross-overs and then reverse back onto its train.\n\nConrail’s BUOI was a daily symbol freight connecting Buffalo’s Frontier Yard with the former Lehigh Valley Railroad Oak Island Yard near Newark, New Jersey. On this day, traffic was sufficient to warrant two sections, thus ‘BUOI-4X’ (X for eXtra).\n\nSo why ‘ZY?’ That was the old Erie two-letter telegraph code for CP East Hornell. My friends and I continued to refer to CP East Hornell as ‘ZY’ even though this designation had been discontinued years earlier.\n\nInterestingly, if you locate this place on Google Maps, you’ll find on Magee Road a marker for ‘ZY Crossing Station.’ Someone at Google respects Erie history!\n\nSomeday I’ll tell another story about this day, but not today .\n\nTracking the Light Posts Daily!\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nMain Street Attica—March 23, 1989\n\nMarch 23, 1989 was a busy day on the old Erie Railroad.\n\nBetween Conrail and the Delaware & Hudson, the railroad was alive with trains.\n\nI’d spent much of the day around Attica, New York, where the line snaked around on its climb over Attica Hill.\n\nIn the afternoon, I caught Conrail’s BUOI (Buffalo to Oak Island, NJ), the daily mixed freight. This was often a huge train and some days in ran in two sections.\n\nIn this view, BUOI has just crossed Main Street in Attica, and has begun to bog down on its eastward climb. In the lead are two Conrail SD50s. These are numbers 6773 and 6763. I found this slide looking for the elusive 6753, which appeared on Tracking the Light a few days ago as Norfolk Southern 6342.\n\nConrail’s 135 SD50s spanned the number series from 6700 to 6834. Over the course of my years photographing Conrail trains, I’m sure I saw nearly all of them. At the time they seemed so common.\n\nThe quest for SD50 6753 continues!\n\nTracking the Light Posts Daily!\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nElephant Style at School Road\n\nAt 7:11 am on May 4, 1989, I parked my 1981 Toyota Corolla on School Road in Batavia, NY.\n\nI was moments ahead of a Conrail westbound freight symbol SENF-X (Extra section of the Selkirk to Niagara Falls train). I’d heard this on my scanner and knew that the fill on Byron Hill at School Road offered a nice broadside view of the tracks.\n\nWith my Leica M2, I made this Kodachrome view of a pair of Conrail SD50s rolling west. I located this image the other night while searching for a suitable photo of Conrail 6753, and thought it was a pretty neat photo.\n\nWhile the pair of SD50s ‘elephant style’ (tail to trunk) is cool, what catches my eye today is the freshly painted Conrail 50ft box car. I wish that I’d made a photo full frame of that car. Today, any clean railroad-owned boxcar is worthy of attention. Back then, I just wasn’t all that impressed. And there’s a lesson for you!\n\nA year earlier, I photographed the same leading SD50 (6793) on May 1st at CP402 in Batavia. I’ll need to find that photo.

Typically, I filed photos by railroad, division, and location, usually grouped by era.\n\nI have countless thousands of slides from the 1980s depicting Conrail all around the system. Some show locomotives, others focus on other elements of the railroad. These were organized by historic routes. I have boxes of Boston & Albany, New York Central Water Level Route, Erie Railroad, PRR, etc.\n\nFor the SD50 search, I’ve started with my Conrail-New York (state) box from 1987-1989 that largely covers the Water Level Route from about Utica, NY to roughly Westfield, NY, with various forays elsewhere. Mixed in with the Conrail photos are some of Delaware & Hudson, Norfolk Southern, and New York, Susquehanna & Western.\n\nOn March 10, 1989, I visited Dunkirk and photographed a parade of freights rolling along the Waterlevel Route. At 10:39am, I made a sequence of images of a westward mixed freight led by a Conrail SD50 using my Leica M2 loaded with on Kodachrome 25.\n\nThis was Conrail 6777, not 6753. But (hopefully) we’ll find the elusive locomotive eventually.\n\nTracking the Light Posts Every Day!\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nMore Classic Conrail-‘Look Ma No Ditchlights!’\n\nRecently I retrieved several cartons of slides long stored out of sight.\n\nMost of these were in their original yellow Kodak boxes. By-in-large these are the slides that didn’t meet my exacting standards at the time of exposure.\n\nAs I’ve illustrated in previous episodes of Tracking the Light, today these boxes contain lost gems.\n\nA photograph that I rejected 30 years ago for a minor defect may look pretty good today.\n\nThis view of Conrail C30-7A No. 6550 eastbound at Palmer, Massachusetts caught my attention. Not only is this the class-leader for one of my favorite Conrail locomotives, but it was exposed in bright October sun in a style much the way I’d like to photograph the train today.\n\nSo what was wrong with this photo? Why did this sit in the dark for 33 years? Three points come mind.\n\nOne: the photo is ever so slightly off level, probably about 1 degree. Back in the 1990s I was very sensitive about maintaining level. I typically carried a line-level with me at all times and almost always used a tripod to help ensure level. This is less of a problem today because my Nikon Z series and Lumix LX7 both feature a level in the heads up display.\n\nTwo: My composition is ever so slightly ‘off’. All things being equal, I should have positioned the camera slightly lower to the ground so that I could see a gap above the top of the rail to more clearly show the wheels better. Also this may have minimized the trees behind the locomotives.\n\nThree: I was a film snob in 1990. Normally, I used Kodachrome 25. But for some season I loaded my camera with Kodachrome 64. I found this film did a poor job of rendering the sky which tended to appear as a greenish blue ‘aqua’ shade rather than the bluer ‘azure’ that was common with K25.\n\nWhile I can’t do much about problem No. two, fixing the level and adjusting the color profile are easily accomplished in post processing. The top photo is my unaltered original; the bottom is my adjusted version, and I altered the sky to appear more like it would with K25.\n\nTracking the Light Posts Daily!\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nWanamaker, Kempton & Southern\n\nIn 2007, I’d made several trips to the Wanamaker, Kempton & Southern while I was working on my book Railroads of Pennsylvania.\n\nI thought it was time to revisit this classic all-American tourist railroad This is a little more than an hour’s drive from our new home, so on our way to the Philadelphia suburbs last Sunday, Kris and I made a wee detour.\n\nIt also of special interst to me now.

We had started before dawn, and picked up a westward Conrail OIBU rolling though the Canisteo toward Hornell, New York.\n\nTrains moved right along on the former Erie Railroad mainline and racing ahead of it in a Dodge Dart, I parked and leaped out of the car at a preselected location at milepost 320 (measured from Jersey City) and began to set up my photograph.\n\nI was working with equipment I borrowed from my father. The Leica M2 loaded with PKM (Kodachrome 25 professional) was mine, but the 200mm Telyt mounted with a bellows on a Leica Visoflex viewfinder and positioned on a antique Linhof tripod were his.\n\nIn our hasty chase, I’d cut my set up time too fine. It was lashing rain and I was struggling to set up and level the tripod, while trying to focus the camera using the Rube Goldburg Visoflex arrangement. My exposure was about f4 1/8 of a second.\n\nConrail’s BUOI came into view before I had time to refine my composition: this imperfect photo was the result. I recall the frustration of fighting with the equipment as the roar of the train intensified and the rain obscured my vision.\n\nLet’s just say, that at the time I wasn’t impressed with my image. I’d cropped too much of the foreground and the whole image is off level. So for 30 years, it sat in the Kodak yellow cardboard slide box that it had been returned to me from lab in.\n\nLast year, I scanned it. Ironically, this damp-day silhouette closely captures the spirit of Conrail’s Canisteo Valley that had captivated my photographic interest.
