Having a CN Bluebird up front is somewhat rare. CSX Q217 is a Philadelphia, PA to Connellsville, PA Daily with empty auto racks.\n\nDennis Weber shot these photos at Santa Fe Junction In Kansas City, Kansas, February 23rd. The top bridge is called The Flyover, and the middle one is called the High Line, a very Hot spot, where Dennis caught 12 Trains in his first hour.\n\nAt Bangor WI on CPs Tomah Sub March 14th.

The train departed Selkirk Yard, NY eastbound for the River Sub, with the EMDs overhauled at MPI in Boise, Idaho.\n\nD&H Vignettes\n\nIn November 1974 James Gillin captured D&H RS11 5008 wearing Extra white flags at Windsor Station in Montreal, QC. A steam generator equipped RS3 provides the heat for the short Adirondack.\n\nThe dome car at the left is a CP Rail Park car and is likely on No. 41 the Atlantic Limited arriving from Saint John, NB. In the background is the 40 storey CP hotel the Chateau Champlain.\n\nThe train ran as an extra for a short period because the CP timetable had not yet been updated. The Adirondack would depart westbound towards Glen Yard and at Montreal West, will turn southward across the St. Lawrence River on the Adirondack Sub. After passing Delson, the train will veer onto the (Napierville Junction - D&H) Lacolle Sub, to the border stop at Rouses Point, NY. Once arriving at destination in Albany, NY, the D&H power would be replaced with Penn Central locomotives to bring the train to Penn Station in New York City.\n\n(Thanks to Wayne Koch and Ray Kennedy-Old Time Trains)\n\nJohn Eull recorded famed Delaware & Hudson Alco PA's #18 and #19 leading a mix of equipment including a leased AMTRAK Dome down the grade through South Junction at Montreal West on December 30, 1975. During Winter months, D&H paired the their four PAs back to back to create more steam heat for the cars. As this arrangement also tied up their Passenger power, D&H short term leased a quartet of Erie-Lackawanna steam generator equipped E8s, paired up for the D&H (Montreal-Albany) trains as well. In Johns photo, you can clearly see the rotating Mars Light in the nose, with one white and small red lens. The Mars Signal Light Company developed this safety Technology in the 1940s and were implemented in the brand new Santa Fe Alco PAs."
