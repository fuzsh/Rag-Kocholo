The company has continued to survive as a separate operational unit and a subsidiary of the Norfolk Southern.  I even heard a voice on the radio identify themselves as the \"CW Dispatcher\".  Although I think they are more like a trainmaster/agent type as track authority was issued by the NS Shenandoah DS.  Power is run of the mill NS junk with plenty of catfish.  However this standard cab Dash-9 was a nice find on the job that ran north to Broadway.  This track here is actually part of the former Southern Railway \"Manassas to Harrisonburg \" branch line and runs through a nice valley with plenty of red clay soil and bluestone rock outcroppings.",
