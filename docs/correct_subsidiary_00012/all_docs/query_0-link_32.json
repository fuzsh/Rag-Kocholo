        "text": "Norfolk Southern Heritage: Lionel continues its tribute to the rich heritage of modern railroads with an all-new series honoring the Norfolk Southern Railway. Operating currently in 22 eastern states, Norfolk Southern was originally created from a 1982 merger of major railways. In 1998, the railway also acquired a large portion of Conrail, which included the former Pennsylvania Railroad network including the famous Horseshoe Curve.\n\nThe Heritage line is beautifully and uniquely decorated to pay special tribute to the Norfolk Southern Railway and the fallen flag railroads it was built from.\n\nFour important railroads that were ultimately absorbed into modern day Norfolk Southern are being honored in the 2010 catalog, including Southern, Virginian, Norfolk & Western, and Conrail.\n\nLighting\n\nSmoke Unit\n\nSKU: 6-29735\n\nDimensions: Length: 10&rdquo;\n\nGauge: Standard O Scale\n\nprice: 94.99\n\nyear: 0\n\nrail line: Conrail\n\nMinimum Radius: O-31\n\nCatalog Year: 2010\n\nCatalog Title: Lionel Signature Edition Volume One 2010\n\nRoad Number: None\n\nHidden uncoupling tabs\n\nDie-cast metal trucks\n\nSeparately applied metal underframe details\n\nSmoke unit with ON/OFF control\n\nInterior illumination\n\nTrain crew figures"
