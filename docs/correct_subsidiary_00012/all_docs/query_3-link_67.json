        "text": "(Received the following via email.)\n\nPicked this off trainorders today, it happened in Dec 2007 but the link to the story is still active.\n\nEggs scrambled after crash of train, truck near Barrett (MN)\n\nBy Susan Larson (Contact)\n\nThe Daily Journal\n\nPublished Monday, December 17, 2007\n\nThousands of eggs were casualties when a Canadian Pacific Train collided with a semi around 8:15 a.m. Friday about 1 mile north of Barrett.\n\nThe north-bound train struck the egg-filled semi, driven by Timothy Joseph Nager, 28, Danvers, at the intersection of Grant County Road 21 and State Highway 55.\n\nNager crossed the train track from the south after turning off Highway 55 when the train struck the rear of the semi, tearing off the back portion, Grant County Sheriff Dwight Walvatne said. Debris was scattered throughout the intersection and down the tracks but no rail cars derailed. Neither Nager nor his passenger were hurt.\n\nTraffic was rerouted off County Road 21 to allow for clean-up. Nager was cited for failure to stop.\n\nBarrett and Elbow Lake fire departments, ELEAH Ambulance and Grant County Sheriff’s Department responded to the scene.\n\nReceived the following via email from Kermit Geary, Jr. on Saturday, 9-20-08. Photos, captions, and text are his.\n\nToday the Reading & Northern celebrated its 25th Anniversary. Founded in 1983, the railroad grew from a small shortline running from Hamburg, PA to Temple, PA. Today it is a major player with over 300 route miles of trackage covering most of Eastern Pennsylvania. Serving the Anthracite Region over former Reading RR trackage...and Wyoming Valley over former Lehigh Valley rails, Andy Mueller has built an empire that most people thought could never be achieved. Today the Railroad celebrated its 25th birthday with a party for guests, employees, and friends of the railroad. Happy Birthday, Reading & Northern, and here is to at least a hundred more!\n\na sight to behold The R&N 2102 & 425 side by side\n\nR&N 425 leaves Port Clinton, PA on 25th Anniversary trip\n\nR&N 425 crosses Millers Road in Molino, PA\n\nR&N 425 teams up with R&N 2102 at Port Clinton, PA\n\nNorth American Railcar Corporation's 25th Saskatchewan Grain Car is Born\n\nAttention all N Modelers: since the first announcement of the Hawker Siddeley Saskatchewan Grain Car, North American Railcar Corporation (NAR Corp) has said that there would be 12 CN-assigned road numbers and 12 CP-assigned road numbers. In addition to these cars, there would be a Special 25th Car which would be made available to those customers who ordered a minimum of 12 cars.\n\nWell, that 25th car is now traveling the rails somewhere in North America.\n\nHere is the story: \"How Car SKNX #397199 Came to be the 25th Car\"\n\n(A story that could be titled: \"Should Art Imitate Life...Or Should Life Imitate Art?\")\n\nPacific Western Rail Systems (PWRS), the parent company of North American Railcar Corp., was offered an exclusive arrangement with the Saskatchewan Grain Car Corporation that we felt we couldn’t pass up. If PWRS produced an accurate model of the Hawker Siddeley Cylindrical Hopper car, we would have exclusive rights to the current paint scheme, as well as any new schemes. This gave us the opportunity and incentive to produce a very accurate, highly detailed model of the HS version of the “Canadian” 4550 Cu Ft 4-bay covered hopper.\n\nWe at PWRS are very proud of our new SGCC Four Bay 4550 cu ft Cylindrical Hopper car due for release in early December and rightly so. It represents the most colorful paint schemes on any 4 bay cylindrical hopper car anywhere.\n\nOn September 27th NAR Corp got word that one of these beautiful cars was spotted in Abbotsford, British Columbia - not far from our warehouse and it was looking a little worse for wear (it had been ridden hard and put away dirty). So what else would a company with pride in their product (or model there of) do but go out and give it some TLC to spruce it up.\n\nWe contacted the Southern Railway of British Columbia, and they were kind enough to move this particular hopper to a location where we could clean up this soon to be Special 25th Car.\n\nThe first thing that we had to do was to clean several thousands of miles of dirt off the car.\n\nFortunately we came prepared to do the job!\n\nA couple of very dedicated employees with the help of alot of Windex got the job done.\n\nNow that looks a whole lot better!\n\nWith a clean palette, we could now create the Special 25th Car saluting the Model Railroading Industry.\n\n(To make sure the job got done right, we flew in a person from Regina who professionally applies graphics to railcars and other media and she applied our special graphics to this car)\n\nJust in case you can't see it clearly...\n\nOn both sides of the car, we have added...\n\nOn one side of the car, we have added...\n\nand on the other side of the car, we have added...\n\nNorth American Railcar Corporation, with our commitment to \"Accuracy and Detail in Scale\", firmly believes that art should accurately imitate life.\n\nWith our Special 25th Car, we wanted to make life accurately imitate art.\n\nN.B., All the graphics that were added to this car had the full permission and blessing of Kadee, Micro-Trains and the Saskatchewan Grain Car Corporation.\n\nWe hope you will join with us in thanking Kadee, Micro-Trains, SGCC and Southern Railway of BC for their help and support in making this Special 25th Car a reality.\n\n(By the way, if any of you see this car and photograph it, we would love to see your photos.)"
