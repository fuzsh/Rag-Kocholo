        "text": "Less than three blocks from the Scheller College of Business resides the new headquarters of Norfolk Southern, home to 3,000 employees working in operations, technology, and corporate teams in two towers. Upon entering the expansive, 13-foot lobby, one canâ€™t miss the massive white circular staircase connecting workspaces on different floors, suggesting the importance of movement to the company. The Norfolk Southern logo with its galloping horse is also prominently displayed.\n\nA large open room filled with dark blue light occupies the fourth floor, home to the Network Operations Center. Here, network operators watch large computer screens intently and monitor train activity across the U.S. in real time, often communicating with conductors and other personnel in the field. On the same floor, a fitness center containing workout equipment provides employees 24-hour access to state-of-the-art equipment.\n\nTaking the elevator to the fifth floor opens to The Commons, a food hall providing a variety of cuisine from sushi to pizza. Open rooftop terraces on both sides of The Commons provide outdoor seating to diners, while a game room on the same floor allows employees to take a break for a game of ping pong or foosball. Most floors contain floor-to-ceiling windows, allowing light to filter softly into work and play areas.\n\nThe top floors of each building provide access to outdoor terraces with greenery, sitting areas, and breathtaking views of the Georgia Tech campus and Midtown Atlanta."
