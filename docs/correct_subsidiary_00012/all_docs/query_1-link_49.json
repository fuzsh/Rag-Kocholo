        "text": "In 2002, GE released the first GEVO, a new series of locomotives that would replace the AC4400CW and Dash 9-44CW. The first two models were the ES44DC and ES44AC. The ES44C4 followed a few years later.\n\nThe new models were designed to meet the stricter diesel locomotive emissions standards imposed by Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations. The EPA “Tier” emissions standards are a series, or Tiers, of allowable emissions levels based upon a locomotive’s date of manufacture. In 2005, Tier 2 took effect followed by Tier 3 in 2010 and Tier 4 took in 2015.\n\nGE developed a new diesel engine, the 12-cylinder GEVO 12, to meet the new emission standards. Both the bore and stroke were increased to produce the same 4,400 horsepower as the older 7FDL16 16-cylinder engine.\n\nThe new prime mover drives an alternator producing AC current that is rectified to DC current. On the ES44DC, this powers the traction motors. On the ES44AC and ES44C4, the DC current is “chopped” back into AC to power the traction motors. The two models share a common 73’ 2” frame and external appearance.\n\nThe external appearance is similar to the AC4400CW. In fact, the cab on early ES44s is almost identical. In 2009, GE changed the cab and nose, moving the nose door from the left side to the right side and replacing the curve seams with more square seams.\n\nUnlike their predecessors, both the AC and DC versions of the ES44 have the large box behind the cab. The biggest visual difference is the larger “wing” structure over the radiator cab. The thicker radiators and related equipment in the radiator cab work to cool the exhaust, which reduces emissions.\n\nCustomer options and design changes have resulted in seven different dynamic brake configurations. The grilles on the sides of the radiator cab have also gone through seven configurations. The most recent units have changed the latches on the engine cab doors to match the ET44 units.\n\nAlthough EPA Tier 4 standards went into effect in 2015, the ES44-series continue to be built. This is due to the Tier 4 Credits, a complicated system that allows GE to continue to build and various railroads to buy the ES44 based on the number of Tier 4 units built.\n\nAfter 2 testbed units and 35 pre-production units, over 7,600 additional ES44s have been built. All of the major railroads including BNSF, Canadian National, Canadian Pacific, CSX, Norfolk Southern, and Union Pacific have fleets with 100s of units. Florida East Coast, Ferromex, Iowa Interstate, and Kansas City Southern also operate ES44s. In addition, 131 were built as lease units for Citirail.\n\nThe ES44 has become the best-selling diesel locomotive of all time.\n\nIn 2012, Norfolk Southern Corp. celebrated its 30th Anniversary in a big way. Under the direction of then-CEO Wick Moorman, Norfolk Southern painted a total of twenty (20) Heritage Units with each wearing a special scheme commemorating a predecessor railroad. Ten (10) brand new GE ES44ACs were selected to be part of the heritage fleet. Five (5) were painted at Juniata Shops in Altoona, Pennsylvania while the other five were painted in Chattanooga, Tennessee at the former Southern Railway paint shop.\n\nIn July of that year, Norfolk Southern gathered all twenty (20) Heritage Units for a railfan event at the North Carolina Transportation Museum in Spencer. There, the locomotives were positioned around the turntable at the former Southern Railway roundhouse for an iconic company photo. After the event, which was attended by over 2,000 railroad enthusiasts, the locomotives were placed into revenue freight service across Norfolk Southern’s 19,500-mile, 22-state network.\n\nBeginning in 2016, Norfolk Southern started adding Positive Train Control (or “PTC”) antenna arrays to its heritage fleet. Today, all ten (10) of the heritage ES44AC wear roof mounted JEM Communications PTC antenna farms with a single large Sinclair antenna. For the first time in HO Scale, our Rivet Counter models come equipped with PTC array - making them the most-modern examples of the Norfolk Southern heritage fleet.\n\nFounding: Formed in 1976 from bankrupt railroads in the Northeast.\n\nOperating Territory: Northeastern United States, primarily in Pennsylvania, New York, and New Jersey.\n\nPrimary Commodities: General freight, including automotive and steel products.\n\nPassenger Services: Limited involvement in passenger services, focusing more on freight.\n\nAbsorption into Norfolk Southern: Acquired by Norfolk Southern and CSX in 1999; NS obtained the majority of Conrail's routes."
