Why not share that journey with you guys? Until this COVID-19 crisis has (relatively) passed, I'll be writing these smaller, random blurbs to keep you updated on what I'm watching. It's one of the biggest comedy franchises of all-time. Let's briefly review all of the Austin Powers movies.\n\nMovie Bio: Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery/Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me/Austin Powers in Goldmember\n\nRelease Date: 5/2/97, 6/11/99, 7/26/02\n\nDirector: Jay Roach\n\nStars: Mike Myers, Seth Green, Elizabeth Hurley, Heather Graham, Verne Troyer, Will Ferrell, Rob Lowe, Robert Wagner, Mindy Sterling, Beyonce, Michael Caine\n\nPlot: Austin Powers (Myers) is a 60's spy who is cryogenically frozen and released in the 1990's. The world is a very different place for Powers. Although he may be in a different decade, his mission is still the same. He has teamed up with Vanessa Kensington (Hurley) to stop the evil Dr. Evil (Myers), who was also frozen in the past. Dr. Evil stole a nuclear weapon and is demanding a payment of 100 billion dollars.\n\nIn \"The Spy Who Shagged Me,\" Dr. Evil uses a device he calls a \"Time Machine\" to travel back to 1969 and remove Austin Powers' mojo. The wounded swinger must travel back in time and, with the help of agent Felicity Shagwell (Graham), recover his vitality. Meanwhile, Dr. Evil's personal life runs amok as he discovers love, continues to shun his son (Green) and develops a close relationship with himself. Well, actually, a clone 1/8 his size whom he dubs \"Mini-Me\" (Troyer).\n\nIn \"Goldmember,\" Dr. Evil and Mini-Me join forces with the superfreaky Goldmember (Myers), kidnapping Austin's father, the master spy Nigel Powers (Caine), in a dastardly time-travel scheme to take over the world. Before you can say \"Shake Your Booty\", Austin cruises to 1975 and teams up with sexy Foxxy Cleopatra (Beyonce) to stop Dr. Evil and Goldmember from their mischievous mayhem.\n\nI thought revisiting the Austin Powers trilogy would be a nice post-script for my four month long James Bond binge. To be honest, this movie really doesn't directly parody Bond as much as I remember, though I would have never understood the Oddjob jokes had I never watched Goldfinger. International Man of Mystery is more making fun of the campy elements of the spy genre as a whole, particularly exaggerating all things British. It's absolutely ridiculous and mostly one-note, but it's a fairly funny one-note to hit.\n\nI don't have the script for this movie in front of me so I can't say for sure, but I can wager a guess that 90 percent of this movie's jokes are sex-related in some way. A good number of them fall flat, but others are funny, particularly the creative ways that it circumnavigates a PG-13 rating with various fruits, balloons and other items obscuring private parts. Austin's pretty much just a late 90's SNL horndog, which is fine because Myers is so energetically bananas in the role.\n\nHowever, I can't be alone in thinking that all of the Dr. Evil scenes run laps around the actual Austin Powers material. If we're talking in contemporary terms, the Dr. Evil memes outpace the Austin Powers memes by at least a 3:1 ratio. Obviously a take on Bond's Blofeld, Myers perfectly captures the absurdity of this character, a 5 foot nothing pipsqueak, bossing people around and demanding absurd things of world governments in order to support his own inferiority complex. All of the scenes between Myers and Seth Green hit so hard (RIP Carrie Fisher in a fantastic cameo as their therapist).\n\nBigger and slightly better, The Spy Who Shagged Me gets a leg up on the original because it's a more confident and crazy adventure, adding a great new character in Mini-Me and some hilariously out-there concepts. Dr. Evil grabbing the hood off a KKK member on Jerry Springer will never not be funny The sex jokes and gross-out humor is still a little tired, but some of it still lands. Once again, Dr. Evil stands ahead of the actual Austin Powers character, and both of them are wayyy better than Fat Bastard. Heather Graham is a step down from Elizabeth Hurley, but she still holds her own.\n\nIt's probably a good thing that they stopped with Goldmember. You can feel the jokes running on fumes in Goldmember, repeating scenarios and gags that were funny on initial revisit. Still, there's plenty of chuckles here, particularly from Doctor Evil and from Michael Caine as Austin Power's charismatic dad. The Goldmember character is a bridge too far for Myers, not very funny and mostly just gross. Eating skin is where I draw a line. Fat Bastard is even more gross in this one too. It's pretty hilarious how much this movie has in common with Spectre, the latest James Bond movie. They both have the same twist, only here it's rightfully played for laughs.\n\nRATING: International Man of Mystery: 7/10\n\nSpy Who Shagged Me: 7/10\n\nGoldmember: 6.5/10"
