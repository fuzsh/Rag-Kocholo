        "text": "A movie industry panel has officially granted James Bond a license to kill the title of the next Austin Powers movie.\n\nIn a decision handed down Thursday, the Motion Picture Association of America pointedly rejected New Line Cinema's appeal to overturn an earlier arbitration ruling barring the studio from using the title Austin Powers in Goldmember for the third installment of Mike Myers' shagadelic spy series.\n\nThe unanimous decision from the MPAA (with love) effectively eliminates New Line's existing marketing campaign for its dentally challenged International Man of Mystery. Last week, the studio scrambled to recall all promo materials--including movie posters and trailers--and the final ruling now renders them obsolete. (That means eBay entrepreneurs are already auctioning off Goldmember posters as instant collector's items.)\n\nBut the battle of Bond and Powers didn't have to end that way.\n\nNew Line went to MGM, the studio behind Bond, and asked if they could work things out to salvage the Goldmember name. According to initial trade reports, MGM responded with a plot worthy of Dr. Evil: New Line could keep the Goldmember title, but in return, New Line would have to reschedule the February 15 release of the Denzel Washington drama John Q. That would leave MGM's Bruce Willis WWII POW flick Hart's War without any major competition for the long Presidents' Day weekend. The trades said New Line ultimately balked at moving John Q.\n\nHowever, MGM disputes that account. In a press release Friday, the studio says it was New Line that proposed to move John Q and MGM turned it down.\n\n\"At all times, MGM maintained that it would not resolve its dispute with New Line in the absence of a substantial cash license payment by New Line at levels comparable to what the Bond films customarily command from promotional partners, whether or not New Line wanted to fulfill its offer to move John Q as part any settlement,\" MGM's statement reads.\n\nThe studio also says the only other offer New Line brought to the table was having Mike Myers host the ABC telecast of Goldfinger later this year and having trailers for the next Bond film attached to prints of New Line's The Lord of the Rings and Austin Powers 3.\n\nEven if the two sides had reached an agreement, it wouldn't have made much difference. The MPAA would have prevented New Line from reapplying for the Goldmember moniker until \"on or after June 14, 2002\"--a little more than a month before the movie's scheduled opening on July 26, which would have been utterly impractical in terms of marketing the third Austin Powers spoof.\n\nReps for MGM also said they were groovy with the verdict. \"We are gratified that the title issue has been resolved in our favor and we intend to vigorously protect our intellectual property rights in this matter,\" a studio statement says.\n\nAdditionally, Jay Rakow, senior v.p. and general counsel for MGM, said in a separate statement, \"MGM will seek monetary penalties pursuant to the terms of the MPAA award, and will take all other appropriate action to continue to protect its intellectual property and its filmmakers.\"\n\nThe dispute between the rival studios came to a head a week ago when MGM protested New Line's use of the Goldmember moniker to the MPAA, alleging it infringed on the studio's copyright for the 1964 classic Goldfinger. The MPAA agreed and ordered New Line to lose Goldmember after finding the studio failed to follow proper regulations in registering the title.\n\nThe ruling is directed only at the spoof's moniker and does not affect any of the characters or the plot of the movie, which is a good thing since Austin Powers' main villain in the third installment is named Goldmember. It is possible, however, that if MGM finds any of the film's plot too close for comfort, the MPAA's decision could open the door for further action.\n\nWhile it would seem that Goldmember is simply a parody of the 007 title and therefore protected under the First Amendment, New Line says it accepts the MPAA decision and will not pursue the matter in court.\n\n\"The appeal process has come to a close, and though New Line is disappointed by the MPAA's decision, we will abide by it,\" says a statement from the studio. \"We remain committed to our filmmaker's vision and are moving forward.\"\n\nFor the time being, New Line is simply referring to the film as Austin Powers 3.\n\nIronically, the decision could come back to haunt MGM. The studio is thinking of reviving its Pink Panther and has been actively trying to lure Myers to take over for Peter Sellers in the role of bumbling Chief Inspector Clouseau. The ill will created by the Goldmember fiasco could sour Myers on MGM."
