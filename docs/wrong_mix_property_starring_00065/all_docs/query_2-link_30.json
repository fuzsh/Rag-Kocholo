        "text": "It's been a long time since Mike Myers took us on a groovy journey of slapstick espionage action with his \"Austin Powers\" franchise. Throughout three films, we were treated to a star-studded cast of past and future celebrities, including acting legends, R&B icons, and former child stars.\n\nLet's cryogenically freeze ourselves, hop in the way-back machine, and take a look at what the cast of all three comedies looked like back then and what they're up to now. And when you thaw yourself out, please do your best to control the VOLUME OF YOUR VOICE!\n\nEveryone knows Mike Myers from his six-year run on \"Saturday Night Live,\" where he played a slew of memorable characters, including metalhead Wayne Campbell on the recurring sketch \"Wayne's World\"—which, of course, spawned a pair of feature-length movies. Staying true to form, Myers also wrote, produced and played multiple characters in all three \"Austin Powers\" films, including Powers, Dr. Evil, and the endlessly hungry Fat Bastard.\n\nAfter the \"Austin Powers\" trilogy ended, Myers continued his work as the voice of the title character in the \"Shrek\" franchise, returning for \"Shrek 2,\" \"Shrek the Third,\" and \"Shrek Forever After.\" Myers also played the title character in 2003's \"The Cat in the Hat,\" which earned him nominations for both a Kids' Choice Award for Favorite Movie Actor and a pair of Razzie Awards for Worst Actor and Worst Screen Couple. Sadly, the Razzies didn't stop there. 2008's \"The Love Guru\" won a terrible trifecta of Razzie Awards for Worst Actor, Worst Screenplay, and Worst Picture—and they even went so far as to nominate Myers for Worst Actor of the Decade. Oh, behave!\n\nIn 2002, Myers' Hollywood Walk of Fame star was unveiled, followed by his induction into Canada's Walk of Fame a year later. Canada also honored the comedian by putting his face on a limited-edition series of stamps alongside Martin Short, Jim Carrey, Catherine O'Hara and Olivier Guimond. Most recently, in 2017, Myers was appointed as an Officer of the Order of Canada, officially honoring his status as a homegrown comedic legend.\n\nOn the screen, English actress Elizabeth Hurley is known primarily for her role as Vanessa Kensington in the first two \"Austin Powers\" films, though those are just a pair of entries in a lengthy filmography that includes \"Rowing with the Wind,\" \"The Long Winter,\" \"Passenger 57,\" \"Mad Dogs and Englishmen,\" and others.\n\nOff the screen, Hurley is a very well-known model and celebrity. She garnered major tabloid attention in 1990s for her 13-year relationship with Hugh Grant, whom she famously accompanied to the premiere of \"Four Weddings and a Funeral\" in the instantly-legendary black Versace dress held together by gold safety pins. Soon after, she became the face of cosmetics company Estée Lauder, whom she has represented in some capacity for most of her modeling career.\n\nThese days, Hurley owns her own beachwear company, Elizabeth Hurley Beach, and played Queen Helena on the E! television series \"The Royals.\" You can keep up with her on Twitter and Instagram.\n\nWell before \"Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery\" arrived in theaters, English actor Michael York had been all over both the big and small screen, as well as the stage.\n\nYork, who's been acting since the mid-1960s, starred in \"The Taming of the Shrew,\" \"Romeo and Juliet,\" \"Jesus of Nazareth,\" \"Logan's Run,\" and too many other quality films to list here. He's also an accomplished Broadway actor, having starred in \"Bent,\" \"The Crucible,\" \"Someone Who'll Watch Over Me,\" and the original production of Tennessee William's \"Out Cry.\" And don't even get us started on his television credits.\n\nIn 2009, York noticed dark circles under his eyes; three years later, the actor was diagnosed with amyloidosis, an extremely rare and difficult to detect condition caused by the abnormal production of insoluble proteins, which stick together in different parts of the body and eventually cause vital organs to shut down. Luckily, he's been undergoing treatment, which has helped alleviate many of the symptoms, and—with York's help—an increased awareness of the disease has led to more medical research and development.\n\n\"Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery\" is merely a side note on actress, producer and competitive poker player Mimi Rogers' résumé.\n\nRogers starred in such noteworthy films as \"Gung Ho,\" \"Someone to Watch Over Me,\" and \"Desperate Hours,\" though 1991's religious drama \"The Rapture\" is arguably the highlight of her career. After the first \"Austin Powers\" movie, Rogers went on to appear in \"Reflections on a Crime,\" \"The Mirror Has Two Faces,\" \"Lost in Space,\" \"Ginger Snaps,\" \"The Door in the Floor,\" and \"For a Good Time, Call...\" Her most recent work has revolved around popular television shows, including \"The X-Files,\" \"Two and a Half Men,\" \"Wilfred,\" and \"Mad Men.\"\n\nIn addition to his appearance as the \"Austin Powers\" series' Number Two, Robert Wagner is also known for his starring roles on \"It Takes a Thief,\" \"Switch,\" and \"Hart to Hart,\" in addition to his recurring roles on \"Two and a Half Men\" and \"NCIS.\" He has also notably starred in \"A Kiss Before Dying,\" \"The Pink Panther,\" \"Harper,\" and \"The Towering Inferno,\" among many, many others.\n\nTragedy struck Wagner when his late wife, Natalie Wood, drowned while sailing off the coast of California's Catalina Island with both Wagner and actor Christopher Walken, on November 29, 1981. Wood's death was originally ruled an accident, but a new investigation was opened in 2013, resulting in the Los Angeles coroner's office amending the actress' death certificate to claim \"drowning and undetermined factors\" as the cause of death. What those \"undetermined factors\" are, we may never know, but it's worth noting that Wagner openly supported reopening the investigation.\n\nIf you'd like to know more about the distinguished actor, you can read his 2008 autobiography, \"Pieces of My Heart: A Life.\"\n\nSeth Green's professional fortunes have only improved since his days as Dr. Evil's son Scott in all three \"Austin Powers\" movies.\n\nGreen is definitely a jack of all trades in the entertainment business. The creator, executive producer, writer, director, and main vocal talent of Adult Swim's stop-motion sketch comedy show \"Robot Chicken,\" he's directed loads of the show's specials — including everyone's favorite, \"Robot Chicken: Star Wars.\" In addition to the \"Austin Powers\" series, Green has also starred in \"Airborne,\" \"The Italian Job,\" \"Party Monster,\" \"Can't Hardly Wait,\" and \"Without a Paddle,\" while also lending his vocal talents to \"Family Guy\" as Chris Griffin. Fans of the video game series \"Mass Effect\" will also recognize him as pilot Jeff \"Joker\" Moreau. He's been nominated, and has won, various Primetime Emmy Awards and Annie Awards for his \"Robot Chicken\" specials, and you can keep up with the well-rounded entertainer on Twitter @SethGreen.\n\nMindy Lee Sterling got her start on the syndicated children's series \"Dusty's Treehouse,\" but it was her role as of Dr. Evil's stern, loud Germanic associate Frau Farbissina that's her true claim to fame. In fact, you probably won't recognize Sterling from anywhere else — unless you watch TV with your kids.\n\nSterling is a popular figure on Disney, Nickelodeon, and other children's networks, having appeared on \"Sister, Sister,\" \"The Wild Thornberrys,\" \"Even Stevens,\" \"Invader ZIM,\" \"That's So Raven,\" \"Justice League Unlimited,\" \"The Suite Life of Zack & Cody,\" \"iCarly,\" \"Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated,\" \"The Legend of Korra,\" \"Kung Fu Panda: Legends of Awesomeness,\" \"The Adventures of Puss in Boots,\" \"School of Rock,\" and many, many more. Her warm smile, expressive nature and comedy credentials definitely make her well-suited for family-friendly roles on children's shows.\n\nAfter notching his big-screen breakthrough in \"Austin Powers,\" Myers' fellow \"SNL\" vet Will Ferrell went on to star in a slew of ever-quotable films, including \"Old School,\" \"Elf,\" \"Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy,\" \"Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby,\" \"Step Brothers,\" and a ton of others.\n\nDuring his seven-year tenure on \"SNL,\" Ferrell assembled a highlight reel that could make any cast member, past or present, green with envy. He impersonated George W. Bush, Cubs announcer Harry Caray, the crooning Robert Goulet, \"Inside the Actors' Studio\" host James Lipton, and \"Jeopardy!\" host Alex Trebek, among others.\n\nFerrell also played professional baseball for ten Major League teams, and although he couldn't ever make solid contact in the batters box, he did retire one batter. Of course, the whole thing was a goof for HBO and his website Funny or Die; proceeds were donated to Cancer for College and Stand Up to Cancer.\n\nEleven years before she played Felicity Shagwell in \"Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me,\" Heather Graham started picking up leading roles in major films. She first starred in 1988's \"License to Drive\" before making waves in the award-winning \"Drugstore Cowboy,\" one of the rare films with a 100% on Rotten Tomatoes, the following year. Graham made supporting appearances in \"Shout,\" \"Diggstown,\" \"Six Degrees of Separation,\" and \"Swingers,\" and also played Annie Blackburn on \"Twin Peaks\" and in \"Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me.\" She really hit the big time as porn star and rollergirl Brandy in \"Boogie Nights\" — and all of that was before Austin Powers.\n\nAfter playing Felicity Shagwell, Graham went on to star in \"Committed,\" \"Say It Isn't So,\" \"Mary,\" \"Gray Matters,\" and the first and third entries in \"The Hangover\" series. She also notably appeared on the popular TV medical dramedy \"Scrubs\" in 2004. More recently, she's been featured in recurring roles on Showtime's \"Californication\" and Netflix's \"Flaked.\" You can keep up with the \"actress, filmmaker and big nerd\" on Twitter @imheathergraham.\n\nBeyoncé Knowles is one superstar who certainly doesn't need an introduction.\n\nShe has won 22 Grammy Awards out of a staggering 62 nominations, and in 2016, she broke Madonna's record for the most MTV Video Music Awards. Her net worth in 2017 was $350 million, making her one of America's Top 50 Richest Self-Made Women. In 2010, she had already sold 118 million records worldwide—a number that seems likely to grow for decades to come.\n\nThe majority of Beyoncé's success came after she played leading lady Foxxy Cleopatra in \"Austin Powers in Goldmember,\" though she was already well on her way to superstardom before that. She initially gained fame as the lead singer of Destiny's Child, and following her starring role in \"Goldmember,\" she released \"Dangerously in Love,\" the first in a growing collection of critically and commercially successful solo albums. You can keep up with the Queen B on Instagram @beyonce—or anywhere celebrity news is covered.\n\nKnown by most as Mini-Me, the miniature clone of Dr. Evil in \"Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me\" and \"Austin Powers in Goldmember,\" Verne Troyer had the rare genetic disorder Cartilage–hair hypoplasia (CHH), and stood only 2 feet 8 inches (or 0.81 meters) tall.\n\nThough most widely known for his role in the second and third \"Austin Powers\" movies, Troyer actually appeared in quite a few other films, both before and after. He played Pinocchio in \"Pinocchio's Revenge,\" the Alien Son in \"Men in Black,\" Baby Joe in \"Mighty Joe Young,\" a band member in \"How the Grinch Stole Christmas,\" Griphook in \"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,\" and Coach Punch Cherkov in \"The Love Guru.\" He later played himself in the TV movie \"Trailer Park Boys: Drunk, High & Unemployed.\"\n\nIn April 2017, he openly admitted to battling alcohol addiction in a Facebook post, thanking fans for their support. According to TMZ, Troyer was hospitalized for more than two weeks, and has gone to rehab for alcohol abuse multiple times, including when he almost died in 2002 from alcohol poisoning. He died in 2018 at age 49.\n\nSir Michael Caine is an absolute icon of the British big screen. Long before he played Austin Powers' father Nigel in \"Austin Powers in Goldmember,\" Caine starred in classics such as \"Zulu,\" \"The Ipcress File,\" \"Alfie\" — which scored him an Academy Award nomination — \"The Italian Job,\" and \"Battle of Britain.\" His filmography also includes acclaimed features from the '70s and '80s such as \"Get Carter,\" \"The Last Valley,\" \"Sleuth,\" \"The Man Who Would Be King,\" \"A Bridge Too Far,\" \"Educating Rita,\" and Woody Allen's \"Hannah and Her Sisters,\" for which he earned a Best Supporting Actor Oscar.\n\nAfter showing the world where Austin got his groove, Caine continued the prolific hard-working streak that's helped make him one of the highest-grossing stars at the box office. He had supporting roles in \"Children of Men\" and Pixar's \"Cars 2\" and he's also become director Christopher Nolan's good luck charm, playing Alfred Pennyworth in Nolan's \"Dark Knight\" trilogy and appearing in \"The Prestige,\" \"Inception,\" and \"Interstellar.\" He even logged a hidden cameo in 2017's \"Dunkirk\" because, as Nolan put it, \"It's Michael. He has to be in all my films, after all.\"\n\nEvery \"Austin Powers\" movie is loaded with references to and jokes about the James Bond franchise. One of the most blatant is in how it gives female characters suggestive wordplay-oriented names. As James Bond had Pussy Galore and Holly Goodhead, \"Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery\" features a femme fatale working for Dr. Evil named Alotta Fagina. She flirts with Austin at a casino and successfully seduces him with a nude hot tub romp, a dalliance Austin regrets.\n\nBorn in Argentina but raised in Italy, Fabiana Udenio was named Miss Teen Italy and shortly thereafter started acting. She played an Italian exchange student in \"Summer School\" and Giulietta on \"One Life to Live,\" and after her featured work in \"Austin Powers,\" settled into building a resume of short stints on TV shows, appearing in an episode or two of \"Babylon 5,\" \"Suddenly Susan,\" \"CSI: Miami,\" and \"Mistresses.\" Udenio landed the recurring role of Elena Di Nola on \"Jane the Virgin,\" and she's set to costar in an upcoming Netflix action series with Arnold Schwarzenegger, per TV Insider.\n\nNumber 2 is Dr. Evil's long-suffering chief lieutenant, literally his second-in-command. In the first \"Austin Powers\" movie, set in 1997, the role is occupied by Robert Wagner. The sequel, \"Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me,\" is set in the past, so filmmakers had to find a younger actor to portray the 1967 version of the character.\n\n\"Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me\" reunited Rob Lowe with his \"Wayne's World\" costar Mike Myers, who cast him as the younger version of Robert Wagner's character because of his strong physical resemblance to the actor and ability to uncannily impersonate him. Lowe was a big star before \"Austin Powers\" and he was a big star after, moving from roles in youth-oriented \"Brat Pack\" films in the '80s into a thriving career as a television mainstay in the 21st century. He starred on the first four seasons of the Emmy-winning \"The West Wing,\" headlined the short-lived \"Dr. Vegas,\" then joined the cast of \"Brothers and Sisters\" and \"Parks and Recreation,\" portraying relentlessly positive health nut and city manager Chris Traeger. After a few more series TV offerings — \"The Grinder,\" \"Code Black,\" and the still-running \"9-1-1: Lone Star\" — Lowe got into the podcasting game with a show named for his \"Parks and Rec\" character's catchphrase: \"Literally!\"\n\nA mole is an agent who infiltrates enemy territory, and in 2002's \"Austin Powers in Goldmember,\" that mole is literally a guy with a humongous mole on his face, one that Austin Powers can't help but point out constantly. He makes his way into Dr. Evil's inner circle, appointed Number Three (assistant to Number Two), where the bad guys tease him about his mole, too.\n\nThe brief but memorable butt-of-the-joke role of the memorably skin-tagged Number Three in \"Austin Powers in Goldmember\" came during a transitional time for Fred Savage. Best known for his child acting work in \"The Princess Bride,\" \"Little Monsters,\" and \"The Wonder Years,\" by the early 2000s, the adult Savage had started acting less and directing more. He's since helmed episodes of more than 70 TV shows, primarily situation comedies, starting with cable kids' shows like \"That's So Raven\" and \"Wizards of Waverly Place,\" and moving up to \"Party Down,\" \"It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia,\" \"Modern Family,\" \"The Conners,\" and \"The Wonder Years,\" the reboot/remake of the series that made him famous in the late '80s. (Per EW, Savage was also an executive producer on the show, but was fired after accusations of inappropriate conduct.)\n\nPatrick \"Paddy\" O'Brien appears briefly in a couple of pivotal scenes in just the first \"Austin Powers\" movie. Serving as one of Dr. Evil's henchmen (and a walking collection of Irish stereotypes), he's known for leaving trinkets on his dead victims — as he puts it, \"They're always after me lucky charms.\" Frau Farbissina compares him to Lucky the Leprechaun from the Lucky Charms commercials, but he's still dangerous enough to sneak into a casino bathroom and nearly strangle Austin Powers to death.\n\nThe role of vanquished Paddy O'Brien is one of the most notable in the career of Paul Dillon, a high-end theatrical performer who moonlights with small and supporting gigs in movies and TV shows. Apart from a recurring part as Angelo over three seasons of the late '90s NBC drama \"The Pretender,\" Dillon has popped up in episodes of \"CSI,\" \"CSI: Miami,\" \"Law and Order,\" \"The Shield,\" and \"Chicago Fire.\""
