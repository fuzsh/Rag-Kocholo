        "text": "In the turbulent months that followed the terrorist attacks of 9/11, domestic audiences needed some escapism at the box office. In the Christmas season of 2001, they found it with Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone and Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring.\n\nBy summer 2002, moviegoers turned out in record-setting droves for the first big screen treatment of an iconic superhero.\n\n20 years later, that’s one thing that hasn’t changed as Spidey continues to dominate the charts. It all started with a memorable upside down kiss. Before we go there, there’s plenty more to discuss for the cinematic summer of two decades past.\n\nAs I do every season on the blog, I’m recounting the top 10 hits, other notable features, and flops from 30, 20, and 10 years ago. If you missed my post covering 1992, it’s right here:\n\nSummer 1992: The Top 10 Hits and More\n\nLet’s begin with that top 10!\n\n10. Mr. Deeds\n\nDomestic Gross: $126 million\n\nWhen Adam Sandler remade Frank Capra, the result was another blockbuster for the star and a needed one after his previous pic Little Nicky was a rare commercial flop.\n\n9. Minority Report\n\nDomestic Gross: $132 million\n\nThe first and still only collaboration between Tom Cruise and Steven Spielberg is a prescient sci-fi tale and its reputation has grown since its release. It’s my personal favorite film of 2002.\n\n8. xXx\n\nDomestic Gross: 142 million\n\nRiding high off the success of the previous summer’s The Fast and the Furious, Rob Cohen and Vin Diesel reunited for this over the top action flick. A sequel would follow three years later without Diesel’s involvement (Ice Cube starred instead), but Vin would return to the role in 2017.\n\n7. Lilo & Stitch\n\nDomestic Gross: $145 million\n\nThis Disney animated effort performed just fine (if not in the stratosphere of some 90s gems) and spawned numerous direct-to-video follow-ups. A live-action version is being planned.\n\n6. Scooby-Doo\n\nDomestic Gross: $153 million\n\nCritics might have thought it was a dog, but crowds lapped up this live-action/animated hybrid based on the very 1970s cartoon. Scoob and the gang would return two years later for part 2. Fun fact: James Gunn of Guardians of the Galaxy fame wrote the script.\n\n5. Men in Black II\n\nDomestic Gross: $190 million\n\nWill Smith and Tommy Lee Jones teamed up again for the sci-fi comedic spectacle from Barry Sonnenfeld. This fell short of the original’s $250 million domestic haul and the reviewers weren’t impressed, but that didn’t prevent a third offering that will be discussed in my summer of 2012 post.\n\n4. Austin Powers in Goldmember\n\nDomestic Gross: $213 million\n\nMike Myers continued to flex his box office mojo alongside Beyonce, Michael Caine, and Mini-Me in this threequel that I believe surpassed the quality of predecessor The Spy Who Shagged Me.\n\n3. Signs\n\nDomestic Gross: $227 million\n\nAfter the more mixed reaction that Unbreakable garnered, M. Night Shyamalan’s Signs with Mel Gibson and Joaquin Phoenix was more of a return to crowd favorite status. What followed was several pics from him that drew considerably more ambivalent to negative vibes.\n\n2. Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones\n\nDomestic Gross: $302 million\n\n$302 million is just dandy for nearly any movie, but this second prequel from George Lucas fell well short of the $431 million achieved by The Phantom Menace three summers prior. Many consider this the worst of the nine officials episodes. I’m one of them.\n\nSpider-Man\n\nDomestic Gross: $403 million\n\nWhen Sam Raimi’s spin on the webslinger kicked off the summer, it did so with the largest opening weekend of all time at $114 million (breaking a record that had just been set by the first Potter). Two sequels followed for the Tobey Maguire/Kirsten Dunst trilogy and, as we all know, the character has never left us. Spider-Man: No Way Home recently brought all 3 Spideys (Maguire, Andrew Garfield, Tom Holland) into its MCU Multiverse.\n\nNow let’s move to some other notable titles from the season:\n\nThe Bourne Identity\n\nDomestic Gross: $121 million\n\nWhile outside the top ten, Paul Greengrass’s action thriller with Matt Damon as an amnesiac spy is more influential than the bulk of the flicks above it. Damon would return to the role three times.\n\nThe Sum of All Fears\n\nDomestic Gross: $118 million\n\nRight behind Damon is his buddy Ben Affleck who took over the role of Jack Ryan (previously played by Alec Baldwin and Harrison Ford) in the Tom Clancy adapted hit.\n\nRoad to Perdition\n\nDomestic Gross: $104 million\n\nHis follow-up to Best Picture winner American Beauty, the Depression era crime drama from Sam Mendes cast Tom Hanks against type as a hitman with Paul Newman as his underworld boss. This only nabbed a Cinematography Oscar, but reviews were mostly strong. It also provides a juicy role for pre-007 Daniel Craig.\n\nInsomnia\n\nDomestic Gross: $67 million\n\nHanks wasn’t the only legend stretching in a villainous turn. Robin Williams memorably did the same as he was pitted against Al Pacino’s detective in this chilly thriller from Christopher Nolan (three years before Batman Begins).\n\nUnfaithful\n\nDomestic Gross: $52 million\n\nAdrian Lyne made a movie about another fatal attraction and Unfaithful earned Diane Lane an Oscar nomination as the cheating wife of Richard Gere.\n\nAnd now for some movies that didn’t perform so well…\n\nReign of Fire\n\nDomestic Gross: $43 million\n\nThis dragon centered fantasy arrived before Matthew McConaughey and Christian Bale would be Oscar winners a few years later. Critics weren’t kind and the box office failed to generate much fire.\n\nWindtalkers\n\nDomestic Gross: $40 million\n\nJohn Woo’s financial win streak blew over with this World War II action drama headlined by Nicolas Cage that only managed 32% on Rotten Tomatoes.\n\nK-19: The Widowmaker\n\nDomestic Gross: $35 million\n\nSeven years before her Oscar winning The Hurt Locker, Kathryn Bigelow’s 1960s set submarine thriller with Harrison Ford was a pricey disappointment.\n\nHalloween: Resurrection\n\nDomestic Gross: $30 million\n\nMichael Myers and Jamie Lee Curtis’s Laurie Strode are about to team up for the final (?) time in Halloween Ends in October. In 2002, this was the sequel to the successful Halloween H20 from 1998. This one was not so successful and it’s considered by many aficionados as the weakest of the whole franchise.\n\nBad Company\n\nDomestic Gross: $30 million\n\nOne is a double Oscar winner and the other is one of greatest stand-ups of all time, but this cinematic pairing of Anthony Hopkins and Chris Rock in Joel Schumacher’s action comedy was met with a shrug.\n\nBlood Work\n\nDomestic Gross: $26 million\n\nTen years after Unforgiven won Best Picture after its summer release, Clint Eastwood’s mystery didn’t work for critics or crowds.\n\nThe Adventures of Pluto Nash\n\nDomestic Gross: $4 million\n\nSpeaking of legendary stand-ups, Eddie Murphy reached a career low point as sci-fi comedy Nash stands as one of cinema’s most notorious flops. Its budget was a reported $100 million and that’s not a misprint above… it made an embarrassing $4 million.\n\n2012 is up next!\n\nRate this:\n\nWhat time is it?\n\nIt’s an often asked question that usually elicits a clear and simple answer. Not in Christopher Nolan’s movies. The answers in his movies are complicated, often maddening, and frequently grandly entertaining. We’ve seen it in Memento, Inception, and Interstellar with the latter being a mixed bag and the first two being pretty great. His latest is Tenet and it definitely falls more into the maddening territory with big and loud moments of thrills. You may wish you had a physics degree during it, but this is mostly an excuse for Nolan to play in the super spy genre with a bunch of quantum related gobbledygook thrown in. The director’s most ardent admirers may study it endlessly for Easter eggs and clues as to its true meaning. Upon first watch, I’m not so sure Tenet is worth the scrutiny. Yet there’s some car chases and battle scenes played to Nigel Tufnel levels of volume that land pleasingly on screens big and small. Weird science and hundreds of millions of dollars worth of action set pieces… this is Nolan’s rap and he frequently goes to eleven in this one.\n\nJohn David Washington is (rather annoyingly) known only as The Protagonist. Let’s call him “Pro” for the duration of this review. A government agent who proves his bonafides to his superiors, he’s allowed into a secret organization known as the picture’s title. Pro’s new assignment tasks him with preventing something “worse” than nuclear holocaust in one example of some clunky dialogue. This is where the physics lessons are useful. You see, Russian oligarch Andrei Sator (Kenneth Branagh) is hellbent on destroying the past and future through the concept of “inversion”. Essentially this means playing with time travel concepts that can wipe out what occurred before or after. I’m not sure Doc Brown could properly provide sufficient exposition without multiple viewings and neither can Pro or his partner Neil (Robert Pattinson). You may want to look up “temporal pincer movements” before you watch.\n\nIn addition to Pro’s teaming with Neil, his mission to stop Sator also involves the villain’s estranged wife Kat (Elizabeth Debicki). She’s quite good here and she’s really the only heroic figure that’s written with any layers. Washington and Pattinson are just fine, though their characters are quite dull on the page and screen. For Branagh, this is his chance to ham it up in true Bond baddie style and he relishes it. We have also get a bit of Michael Caine (common for a Nolan experience) and internationally known Hindi actress Dimple Kapadia as an arms trafficker.\n\nTenet does feature the aforementioned action set pieces that are impressive in scope and tech wizardry. The director doesn’t handle these sequences with half measures. If the scene calls for a 747 to be demolished, you best believe that plane was actually destroyed. The inversion concept lends to eye candy moments with backwards cars screeching on the highway and seagulls (!) even flying in reverse.\n\nVery early on, a scientist is explaining the science behind Tenet to Pro with the following dialogue: “Don’t try to understand it. Feel it.” I wrote that piece of advice down immediately. I had a notion these words might aptly describe the next two hours plus. And they do. I certainly felt the decibel levels of Nolan and his crew choreographing expensive battles. They take place all over the globe in Norway, Italy, and Siberia. I did not, on the other hand, feel too invested in the complicated narrative mechanics that cause them. In fact, I wrote down something else I didn’t expect to while watching – “Austin Powers”. In that super spy’s second outing, The Spy Who Shagged Me, Austin attempts to understand the highly confusing time travel plot in a conversation with his colleague Basil. After twisting his brain into a knot discussing it, Basil smartly replies “I suggest you don’t worry about those things and just enjoy yourself.” He then turns to the camera and says to us – “That goes for all of you, too.” It’s a funnier way of asking us to feel it whether we understand it or not. That request succeeds only intermittently with Tenet.\n\n**1/2 (out of four)\n\nRate this:\n\nThe list of my personal top 25 cinematic performances from the many alumni at Saturday Night Live reaches the top 5 today! If you missed my previous entries covering numbers 25-6, you can find them all at the following links:\n\nhttps://toddmthatcher.com/2020/06/21/top-25-snl-alumni-movie-performances-numbers-25-21/\n\nhttps://toddmthatcher.com/2020/06/22/top-25-snl-alumni-movie-performances-numbers-20-16/\n\nhttps://toddmthatcher.com/2020/06/24/top-25-snl-alumni-performances-numbers-15-11/\n\nhttps://toddmthatcher.com/2020/06/25/top-25-snl-alumni-performances-numbers-10-6/\n\nLet’s get to my overall favorites, shall we?\n\n5. Chevy Chase, National Lampoon’s Vacation (1983)\n\nChase’s finest and funniest work belongs to his doofus dad role as Clark Griswold in this classic that spawned three sequels, including the cherished Christmas Vacation. This is one of the pictures that can be rewatched endlessly and much of that is due to Chase’s signature performance.\n\n4. Mike Myers, Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery (1997)\n\nMyers successfully translated his SNL character Wayne Campbell to the silver screen in 1992’s blockbuster Wayne’s World alongside his costar Dana Carvey (who nearly made the list for his work in that film). Yet the most hilarious work from Myers comes here as both the title character and (especially) nemesis Dr. Evil. Two sequels would give Myers an opportunity to play even more deliriously over the top parts.\n\n3. Will Ferrell, Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy (2004)\n\nAfter the back to back hits of Old School and Elf, Ferrell developed his most iconic character with his arrogant and clueless news anchor. Anchorman has deservedly became an all-time comedy classic.\n\n2. Eddie Murphy, Coming to America (1988)\n\nLet’s face it – this list could have been dominated by Eddie. I had Trading Places and The Nutty Professor in the top 25, but could have included 48 Hrs., Beverly Hills Cop, Bowfinger, Shrek, Dreamgirls, or Dolemite Is My Name as well. However, my personal favorite is this 1988 humorous fairy tale when Murphy was at the peak of his power. This is the first pic that gave him the opportunity to portray multiple characters and he certainly makes the most of it.\n\n1. Bill Murray, Groundhog Day (1993)\n\nJust as with Murphy, many movies from Murray could have made the cut. You already saw Ghostbusters and Lost in Translation on here and other contenders included Caddyshack, Scrooged, What About Bob?, Kingpin, Rushmore, and Zombieland. Overall, I go with Groundhog Day as his finest hour and #1 on the whole list. Simply put, I find Groundhog Day to be perfection and the quintessential vehicle for its versatile star.\n\nAnd there you have it, folks! It’s been fun putting together the list and I hope you enjoyed reading it…\n\nRate this:\n\nMy recap of the summer seasons from 30, 20, and 10 years ago continues with 1999. It was a banner year for film in general with many acclaimed features hitting theaters at the turn of the century.\n\nIf you missed my previous post recounting 1989, you can find it here:\n\nhttps://toddmthatcher.com/2019/07/10/summer-1989-the-top-10-hits-and-more/\n\nAs with other look backs, I’ll give the top 10 highest earners along with other notable pics and some flops. Interestingly, the list begins at #10 with probably the most high profile misfire:\n\n10. Wild Wild West\n\nDomestic Gross: $113 million\n\nThe July 4th holiday weekend had literally become reserved space for Will Smith. Independence Day in 1996 and Men in Black the following year both came out in that frame and ended up as their summer’s biggest blockbusters. This update of a 1960s TV series cast the Fresh Prince with Kevin Kline and reunited him with MIB director Barry Sonnenfeld. Critics and audiences weren’t impressed.\n\n9. Notting Hill\n\nDomestic Gross: $116 million\n\nJulia Roberts and Hugh Grant were a rom com match in heaven with this well reviewed pic from the writer of Four Weddings and a Funeral. Our lead actress isn’t finished yet…\n\n8. The Blair Witch Project\n\nDomestic Gross: $140 million\n\nTruly a phenomenon upon release, this handheld camera indie supernatural horror tale was made for a reported $60,000. Many audience members thought it was a real documentary and it scared up nearly $250 million worldwide and spawned two lesser regarded follow-ups.\n\n7. Runaway Bride\n\nDomestic Gross: $152 million\n\nI told you we weren’t done with Julia Roberts. This rom com reunited her with her Pretty Woman director Garry Marshall and costar Richard Gere. It might not have captured the acclaim of that flick, but it made plenty of cash.\n\n6. The Mummy\n\nDomestic Gross: $155 million\n\nLoosely updating the 1932 classic, The Mummy managed to turn Brendan Fraser into a temporary action star. Two sequels followed and a spin-off (The Scorpion King) that turned Dwayne Johnson into an action hero.\n\n5. Big Daddy\n\nDomestic Gross: $163 million\n\n20 summers ago marked the height of Adam Sandler’s box office potency. Big Daddy remains his biggest live action grosser of all time.\n\n4. Tarzan\n\nDomestic Gross: $171 million\n\nDisney was still knocking traditional animated hits out summer after summer. Tarzan managed to nab Phil Collins an Oscar for a song contribution.\n\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=FajOWorHwZg\n\n3. Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me\n\nDomestic Gross: $206 million\n\nThe original Powers came out two summers prior. While it performed decently in theaters, it became a massive hit with its home video release. Due to that, this sequel made more in its opening weekend than part 1 achieved in its entire theatrical run. A third edition arrived in 2002.\n\n2. The Sixth Sense\n\nDomestic Gross: $293 million\n\nAn unexpected smash, this is the movie that introduced the world to M. Night Shyamalan and the line “I see dead people”. Bruce Willis didn’t get an Oscar nod, but the picture itself did. So too did Shyamalan’s direction, screenplay, and the supporting performances of Haley Joel Osment and Toni Collette.\n\n1. Star Wars: Episode 1 – The Phantom Menace\n\nDomestic Gross: $431 million\n\nIts reputation certainly hasn’t grown through the years, but George Lucas’s return to the cherished franchise after 16 years easily ruled the summer. We’re still haunted by Jar Jar two decades later.\n\nAnd now more some other notable titles from the ‘99 season:\n\nAmerican Pie\n\nDomestic Gross: $102 million\n\nThe raunchy teen comedy was a surprise smash that introduced us to a new group of young actors and spawned three theatrical sequels and four direct to DVD sequels.\n\nThe Haunting\n\nDomestic Gross: $91 million\n\nJan de Bont followed up mega hits Speed and Twister with this critically unappreciated remake of The Haunting of Hill House. It didn’t reach the heights of those blockbusters, but came close to the century mark domestically.\n\nDeep Blue Sea\n\nDomestic Gross: $73 million\n\nRenny Harlin’s tale involving sharks that could potentially cure Alzheimer’s (yes it’s absurd), Sea is best known for a killer death scene involving Samuel L. Jackson.\n\nThe Thomas Crown Affair\n\nDomestic Gross: $69 million\n\nArriving smack dab in the middle of his Bond run, this remake of Steve McQueen’s heist film was a solid midsize performer.\n\nBowfinger\n\nDomestic Gross: $66 million\n\nThe box office grosses were decent, but Bowfinger gave us a satisfying pairing of two comedic legends in Eddie Murphy and Steve Martin.\n\nEyes Wide Shut\n\nDomestic Gross: $55 million\n\nThe swan song of Stanley Kubrick (who died shortly before release), this dreamlike sexual drama with then married Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman polarized audiences and critics.\n\nSouth Park – Bigger, Longer and Uncut\n\nDomestic Gross: $52 million\n\nThe landmark Comedy Central show from Trey Parker and Matt Stone got the big screen treatment and translated well to the multiplex, even nabbing an Oscar nod for Best Original Song (“Blame Canada”).\n\nThe Iron Giant\n\nDomestic Gross: $23 million\n\nA commercial failure at the time, this animated pic marked the debut of Brad Bird who went onto helm Pixar classics. Its reputation has grown significantly in time.\n\nNow… let’s recount some flops:\n\nMickey Blue Eyes\n\nDomestic Gross: $33 million\n\nHugh Grant had a $100 million plus earner with Notting Hill, but this mob themed comedy was not a hit.\n\nMystery Men\n\nDomestic Gross: $29 million\n\nBen Stiller had the previous summer’s largest comedy with There’s Something About Mary. This failed superhero spoof didn’t even make half its budget back stateside.\n\nThe Astronaut’s Wife\n\nDomestic Gross: $10 million\n\nThis Johnny Depp sci fi thriller is not a title discussed often in his filmography or Charlize Theron’s. There’s a reason.\n\nDudley Do–Right\n\nDomestic Gross: $9 million\n\nThe Mummy provided Brendan Fraser with a franchise. This cartoon remake couldn’t hit double digits.\n\nAnd that wraps my recap! Look for 2009 on the blog shortly…\n\nRate this:\n\nPut on your nostalgia goggles (or maybe the sunglasses that make you forget stuff if Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones flash a light at you) because I’m recounting the summer of 1997 on the blog today!\n\nThis has become a seasonal tradition around here and I gave you the top 10 summer hits of 1987 and more earlier this week. If you missed that post, you can find it here:\n\nhttps://toddmthatcher.com/2017/08/01/summer-1987-the-top-10-hits-and-more/\n\nThis time around, we’re going back 20 years when Nicolas Cage accounted for 25% of the top 8 moneymakers and Batman crashed and burned.\n\nWe’ll begin with the top ten and then get to some other notable pics and flops:\n\n10. Hercules\n\nDomestic Gross: $99 million\n\nDisney’s ‘toon couldn’t reach the century mark and that was considered a disappointment after early and mid 90s smashes like Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, and The Lion King.\n\n9. Contact\n\nDomestic Gross: $100 million\n\nRobert Zemeckis’s follow-up to Forrest Gump (which ruled summer 1994) was a well-regarded science fiction drama with Jodie Foster and an emerging Matthew McConaughey.\n\n8. Con Air\n\nDomestic Gross: $101 million\n\nThis action thriller from the Bruckheimer factory is our first to feature Mr. Nicolas Cage (who was coming off a recent Oscar win), along with an all-star cast including John Cusack, John Malkovich, Steve Buscemi, and Ving Rhames.\n\n7. George of the Jungle\n\nDomestic Gross: $105 million\n\nDisney probably didn’t anticipate this remake of the cartoon starring Brendan Fraser would manage to out perform Hercules, but that it did.\n\n6. Batman and Robin\n\nDomestic Gross: $107 million\n\nThis may have placed sixth for the summer, but Batman and Robin came in well below its three predecessors and director Joel Schumacher and new Caped Crusader George Clooney have been apologizing about it for the last 20 years. We’re still trying to block out those Arnold/Mr. Freeze bad puns.\n\n5. Face/Off\n\nDomestic Gross: $112 million\n\nMr. Cage teamed up for Mr. John Travolta for John Woo’s entertainingly over-the-top sci-fi and action mash-up.\n\n4. My Best Friend’s Wedding\n\nDomestic Gross: $127 million\n\nJulia Roberts made a return to box office dominance in this rom com which featured stolen scenes from costar Rupert Everett.\n\n3. Air Force One\n\nDomestic Gross: $172 million\n\n“Get off my plane!” became one of the season’s catchphrases with Harrison Ford as the butt kicking POTUS battling Russian terrorist Gary Oldman in the skies.\n\n2. The Lost World: Jurassic Park\n\nDomestic Gross: $229 million\n\nSteven Spielberg’s eagerly anticipated follow-up to 1993’s Jurassic Park kicked off with the biggest opening weekend of all time (at that time). However, in the end, it couldn’t manage to top the gross of its predecessor. If you’d polled probably any box office analyst at the beginning of the year, they likely would have said it’d be #1 for the summer. Yet that honor ended up belonging to…\n\n1. Men in Black\n\nDomestic Gross: $250 million\n\nA franchise was born and Will Smith made it two summers in a row with the top grossing picture (the previous year being Independence Day) with Barry Sonnenfeld’s megahit sci-fi action comedy.\n\nAnd now for some other notable pics:\n\nThe Fifth Element\n\nDomestic Gross: $63 million\n\nAudiences and critics didn’t quite know what to make of Luc Besson’s visual feast featuring Bruce Willis, Gary Oldman, and Chris Tucker. Sound familiar? Same thing is happening 20 years later with Besson’s Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets.\n\nAustin Powers: International Man of Mystery\n\nDomestic Gross: $53 million\n\nThe Mike Myers 007 spoof performed well, but it wasn’t until home video that Powers turned into a genuine phenomenon spawning countless catchphrases. Its sequel two summers later would earn more in its opening weekend that part 1 did in its domestic total.\n\nThe Full Monty\n\nDomestic Gross: $45 million\n\nThis British import about unconventional male strippers was the summer’s true sleeper and went on to earn a host of Oscar nominations, including Best Picture. Monty would earn over $250 million worldwide compared to its tiny $3.5 million budget.\n\nCop Land\n\nDomestic Gross: $44 million\n\nAfter appearing in a string of high-octane action flicks, Sylvester Stallone changed it up with this crime drama featuring an impressive supporting cast that included Robert De Niro, Ray Liotta, and Harvey Keitel.\n\nAnd now for some of the season’s large belly flops:\n\nSpeed 2: Cruise Control\n\nDomestic Gross: $48 million\n\nKeanu Reeves didn’t want to touch it, but Sandra Bullock came back for this ridiculed sequel where Jason Patric was the new lead. Considered by many to be one of the worst follow-ups of all time.\n\nOut to Sea\n\nDomestic Gross: $29 million\n\nJack Lemmon and Walter Matthau created comedic gold with The Fortune Cookie and The Odd Couple and reunited years later to box office fortune with the Grumpy Old Men movies. This one? Not so much.\n\nFather’s Day\n\nDomestic Gross: $28 million\n\nIvan Reitman directing Robin Williams and Billy Crystal in a high-profile comedy? Sounds like a good recipe, but the product was mediocre at best and audiences didn’t turn out.\n\nExcess Baggage\n\nDomestic Gross: $14 million\n\nTwo summers earlier, Alicia Silverstone had broken out with Clueless. The summer of 1997 was a breakdown. In addition to appearing as Batgirl in the already discussed Batman and Robin, this action comedy with Benicio del Toro bombed big time.\n\nSteel\n\nDomestic Gross: $1.7 million\n\nPeople may have wanted to watch Shaquille O’Neal on the basketball court, but they had zero interest in watching him as the title superhero in this disaster.\n\nAnd that does it for now, folks, but I’ll be back soon recounting 2007!\n\nRate this:\n\n“In the spring, we’d make meat helmets.” – Dr. Evil\n\nIn this week’s example of “Where has the time gone?”, Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery celebrated its 20 year anniversary. In May of 1997, this creation of Mike Myers wasn’t expected to be the cultural milestone it turned out to be and spawn endless catchphrases. The SNL alum had not capitalized on the wild success five years earlier of Wayne’s World. Myers experienced two box office disappointments in his follow-ups – So I Married An Axe Murderer (which would achieve minor cult status later) and the Wayne’s World sequel.\n\nNot much was expected from Powers, but the James Bond spoof immediately achieved its cult status and over performed expectations by grossing $53 million domestically. That was a pleasing number, but not a total runaway hit. It took home video to expand its audience and expand its audience it did. By the time Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me was released two summers later, it made $54 million… in its first weekend. Goldmember, the third installment, would make $73 million out of the gate in 2002.\n\nYet it’s the original from two decades past that remains the best. And in this edition of Movie Perfection, I focus on what was my favorite scene 20 years ago and remains so today. That would be the therapy session between Myers’ Dr. Evil and his son Scott (Seth Green).\n\nThis sequence finds the late Carrie Fisher as a shrink offering advice to fathers and their teenage boys. The group quickly finds the bald mastermind and nemesis of the title character has the strangest relationship with his estranged offspring. Dr. Evil is, in fact, actually trying to kill him. And Scott’s aspirations of working with animals doesn’t gel with Dad’s idea of it.\n\nThe entire scene is hilarious but it builds to an epic climax with Dr. Evil’s description of his own bizarre childhood. Burlap bags, luge lessons, webbed feet, and the laziness of chestnuts are all incorporated into an uproarious monologue that solidifies why Dr. Evil was always the greatest character in the franchise.\n\nCarrie Fisher is pitch perfect in her cameo. It’s crazy to think her work here arrived almost exactly 20 years after her first appearance as Princess Leia and now it’s been 20 years since her participation in this fantastic sequence.\n\nSo, as we celebrate two decades since this memorable series, today’s Movie Perfection honors its best scene.\n\nRate this:"
