Austin talks of \"shagging,\" talks of having a \"menage a trois,\" makes a joke concerning whether a woman \"spits or swallows.\" Spaceship made to look like a penis and testicles, two extended sequences link scenes of people around the world finishing the sentences of the person who spoke before them by making a phallic allusion. Lead female character's last name is \"Shagwell.\" Outside the tent where Austin and Felicity are working to stop Dr. Evil outside of his compound, Dr. Evil's guards observe their shadows and it appears as if Felicity is sticking in and pulling out various objects (including a gerbil) from Austin's rectum as they moan and make comments that could be interpreted as sexual. Austin is in bed talking with his wife about the sexual positions in the Kama Sutra they haven't attempted yet. Female droid has the barrels of two machine guns poking out of her breasts. A game of chess is sexualized as the two players touch and stroke phallic or nipple-like chess pieces. A Russian spy's name is \"Ivana Humpalot.\"\n\nDid you know you can flag iffy content? Adjust limits for Sex, Romance & Nudity in your kid's entertainment guide.\n\nGet started\n\nParents need to know that Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me is a 1999 sequel that's very, very, very raunchy, with incessant and prolonged sexual humor. Because it's a comedy, the rating system gives it a PG-13, but the material would clearly get an R if it appeared in a drama. Do not kid yourself that some of these jokes are \"over their heads.\" Those kids who do not see it -- or who do see it and miss some of the jokes -- will hear detailed explanations from those who do of references like Powers asking one woman \"Which is it, spits or swallows?\" and pretty much every woman \"Do I make you horny?\" In addition, the movie features character names Felicity Shagwell, Fat Bastard, and Ivana Humpalot, a rocket shaped like a penis (described by a series of characters with every imaginable euphemism), references to a one-night stand \"getting weird,\" an extended sequence in which it appears that a number of objects are removed from Powers' rectum, and Powers' inability to perform in bed due to his missing \"mojo.\" There is also a good deal of potty humor, including Powers mistaking a stool sample for coffee. There is also a joke referencing a lesbian character who met her girlfriend on the \"LPGA tour.\" Profanity includes \"s--t,\" \"bitch,\" and \"nuts.\" To stay in the loop on more movies like this, you can sign up for weekly Family Movie Night emails."
