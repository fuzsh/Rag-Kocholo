        "text": "American actor (born 1974)\n\nThis article is about the American actor. For other people named Seth Green, see Seth Green (disambiguation).\n\nSeth Benjamin Green (né Gesshel-Green; born February 8, 1974) is an American actor. His film debut came with a role in the comedy-drama film The Hotel New Hampshire (1984), and he went on to have supporting roles in comedy films throughout the 1980s, including Radio Days (1987) and Big Business (1988).\n\nDuring the 1990s and 2000s, Green began starring in comedy films such as Idle Hands (1999), Rat Race (2001), Without a Paddle (2004) and Be Cool (2005). He also became known for his portrayal of Scott Evil, Dr. Evil's son, in the Austin Powers film series (1997–2002). Green has also taken serious roles in films, including The Attic Expeditions (2001) and Party Monster (2003). He has provided the voice for Howard the Duck in a number of Marvel Cinematic Universe films and series, including Guardians of the Galaxy (2014), Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (2017), and Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) and in the animated series What If...? (2021–present). In 2019, he wrote, directed, and starred in the comedy-drama film Changeland.\n\nGreen's first lead role on television was on the ABC sitcom Good & Evil in 1991, for which he won a Young Artist Award. Green later gained attention for his supporting roles as Oz, a teenage guitarist and the boyfriend of Willow Rosenberg, on the fantasy television series Buffy the Vampire Slayer (1997–2000), and as the voice of Chris Griffin on the Fox adult animated comedy series Family Guy (1999–present). He also voiced Leonardo in the Nickelodeon animated series Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2014–2017) and Joker in the Mass Effect video game series (2007–2012). Green created, directed, wrote, and produced the adult animated comedy series Robot Chicken and its spinoffs (2005–present), which have earned him three Primetime Emmy Awards and five Annie Awards.\n\nEarly life\n\nSeth Benjamin Gesshel-Green was born in Overbrook Park, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania,[1] the son of Barbara (née Gesshel) and Herbert Green. He has one sister, Kaela. Green later legally changed his name to Seth Benjamin Green.[2][3] He was raised Jewish and had a bar mitzvah ceremony.[4] His ancestors were from Russia, Poland, and Scotland.[5] Green started acting at the age of 7.[6] His early comic influences included Monty Python, Blackadder, Saturday Night Live, Richard Pryor, Bill Cosby, Porky's, and Caddyshack.[7][8]\n\nCareer\n\nEarly work\n\nGreen's first movie roles were in the 1984 films Billions for Boris and The Hotel New Hampshire; the second film cast him alongside Jodie Foster and Rob Lowe. He appeared in the 1987 film Can't Buy Me Love, playing Patrick Dempsey's character's little brother, Chuckie Miller. He starred in Woody Allen's Radio Days (1987) as Joe (a 1930s–1940s boy based on Allen) and appeared in Big Business (1988) and, in the same year, My Stepmother Is an Alien, which also starred Buffy the Vampire Slayer co-star Alyson Hannigan.[citation needed]\n\nIn 1984, Green portrayed Carl \"Alfalfa\" Switzer in the Jell-O Gelatin Pops commercials featuring The Little Rascals. In 1991, Green rose to fame in a Rally's \"Cha Ching\" commercial,[9][10] which earned him an appearance at a New Orleans Saints game. Green was given a key to New Orleans in honor of his role in the popular commercial.[11]\n\nGreen appeared in the horror TV series It (as Richie Tozier, age 12) and Ticks, all three Austin Powers movies (as Dr. Evil's son, Scott), and Enemy of the State and The Italian Job (as a computer specialist in both). He was also in the films Can't Hardly Wait, Rat Race, Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed, Without a Paddle (alongside Matthew Lillard), Idle Hands, Party Monster, Airborne, and Old Dogs.\n\nIn 1994, he starred alongside Jennifer Love Hewitt in the short-lived series The Byrds of Paradise. The two additionally appeared in 1998's Can't Hardly Wait. Green also had a role in the series Buffy the Vampire Slayer. He played Daniel \"Oz\" Osbourne, a calm, mild-mannered member of the band Dingoes Ate My Baby who gets turned into a werewolf. The character was very popular among fans of the series. Green is not related to Bruce Seth Green, who directed some episodes of Buffy the Vampire Slayer. On occasion, some sources confuse the two and have credited Seth as the director. As an actor in the series, he was close to co-star Alyson Hannigan because they were lovers in the show. Green has starred on Fox's Greg the Bunny and guest-starred on The X-Files, That '70s Show, Will & Grace, MADtv, Reno 911!, Entourage, Grey's Anatomy, The Wonder Years, Heroes, The Facts of Life, The Drew Carey Show, and My Name Is Earl.\n\nOn the animated television comedy Family Guy, Green primarily voices Chris Griffin, the teenage son, who is overweight, unintelligent and, in many respects, a younger version of his father Peter Griffin. He also voices Neil Goldman, a neighbor of the Griffins.[12] Green did an impression of the Buffalo Bill character from the thriller film The Silence of the Lambs during his audition.[13] He has stated that his main inspiration for Chris' voice came from envisioning how \"Buffalo Bill\" would sound when speaking through a public address system at a McDonald's.[14]\n\nHoward the Duck\n\nGreen provides the voice of Howard the Duck for the live-action Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) films Guardians of the Galaxy (2014) and Vol. 2 (2017) and the Disney+ animated series What If...?, as well as the Disney XD animated series Guardians of the Galaxy (2015–2019) and Ultimate Spider-Man (2016).[15][16][17][18]\n\nDeveloping the character with James Gunn, Green did an impression of Danny DeVito, \"being sort of a gruff and cynical sarcastic character [who] doesn't know what the Earth species of duck even is and doesn't think of himself that way and is offended by that generalization.\"[19][20][21][22]\n\nLater work\n\nGreen is a co-creator, co-producer, writer, director, and most frequent voice of the Emmy-winning stop-motion sketch parody comedy TV series Robot Chicken, for which he does many voices and has appeared in animated form. Green is friends with the band Fall Out Boy, making a cameo in their music video, \"This Ain't a Scene, It's an Arms Race\". He also appeared in \"Weird Al\" Yankovic's \"White & Nerdy\" music video. He made two appearances on The Soup in 2007 and 2008, using his first appearance to lampoon Internet celebrity Chris Crocker.[23] He voiced the character Jeff \"Joker\" Moreau, pilot of the Normandy-SR starship series in the video games Mass Effect, Mass Effect 2, and Mass Effect 3.[24][25] He is a producer of The 1 Second Film and appears in the \"making of\" documentary that accompanies its feature-length credits. Green is also the co-creator (with Hugh Sterbakov) of the comic Freshmen, published by Top Cow Productions.\n\nGreen, along with Robot Chicken co-producer Breckin Meyer, appeared in the NBC show Heroes during the 2008–09 season.[26] In January 2009, Green worked with David Faustino (Bud Bundy from Married... with Children) for an episode of Faustino's show Star-ving – Faustino is often mistaken for Green.[27] Later in the same year, he worked with one of his idols, Robin Williams in comedy film Old Dogs, which also starred John Travolta. On July 13, World Wrestling Entertainment's official website announced Green as the special guest host for the July 13 episode of WWE Raw, and on that night, Green competed in the main event, a six-man tag team match, which his team won by disqualification.[28][29] He was also in attendance for WWE's biggest event of the year, WrestleMania XXVI on March 28, 2010. Green guest-starred in the third season of the acclaimed sitcom Husbands.[30] Green became the new voice of Leonardo in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles following Jason Biggs' departure from the role.[31]\n\nIn 2019, he wrote and directed his first film named Changeland, starring Brenda Song and Macaulay Culkin. The movie was released on June 7, 2019.[32]\n\nIn 2021, Green reprised the role of Todo 360 in Star Wars: The Bad Batch.[33] The following year, Green voiced Thunderbolt in season three of Stargirl where the character was previously voiced by Jim Gaffigan.[34]\n\nPersonal life\n\nAfter getting engaged on New Year's Eve in 2009, Green married actress Clare Grant on May 1, 2010, in Northern California.[35] They worked together on Robot Chicken, Warren the Ape, Changeland, Holidays, Star Wars: The Clone Wars, Hulk and the Agents of S.M.A.S.H., and her Saber and \"Geek and Gamer Girls Song\" viral videos.[36][37]\n\nGreen is very good friends with fellow actor Macaulay Culkin, who he co-starred with in the film Party Monster, as well as in Changeland, and on various episodes of Robot Chicken.[38]\n\nFilmography\n\nFilm\n\nYear Title Role Notes 1984 Billions for Boris Benjamin \"Ape-Face\" Andrews 1984 The Hotel New Hampshire \"Egg\" Berry 1986 Willy/Milly Malcolm 1987 Radio Days Joe 1987 Can't Buy Me Love Chuckie Miller 1988 Big Business Jason 1988 My Stepmother Is an Alien Fred Glass 1990 Missing Parents Leo 1990 Pump Up the Volume Joey 1991 Our Shining Moment Wheels 1992 The Double 0 Kid Chip 1992 Buffy the Vampire Slayer Vampire 1993 Ticks Tyler Burns 1993 Arcade Stilts 1993 Airborne Wiley 1993 The Day My Parents Ran Away Leo 1995 Notes from Underground Punk Neighbor 1995 White Man's Burden 3rd Youth at Hot Dog Stand 1996 To Gillian on Her 37th Birthday Danny Green 1997 Boys Life 2 Homophobe #2 Segment: \"Nunzio's Second Cousin\" 1997 Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery Scott Evil 1998 Can't Hardly Wait Kenny Fisher 1998 Enemy of the State Selby Uncredited[39] 1999 Idle Hands Mick 1999 Stonebrook Cornelius 1999 Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me Scott Evil 2001 Rock Star 101 Le'Von Short film 2001 The Trumpet of the Swan Boyd (voice) [40] 2001 The Attic Expeditions Douglas 2001 Josie and the Pussycats Travis 2001 America's Sweethearts Danny Wax 2001 Rat Race Duane Cody 2001 Knockaround Guys Johnny Marbles 2002 Austin Powers in Goldmember Scott Evil 2003 Party Monster James St. James 2003 The Italian Job Lyle / \"Napster\" 2004 Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed Patrick Wisely 2004 Without a Paddle Dan Mott 2005 Be Cool Shotgun Uncredited 2005 Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story Chris Griffin, Various (voices) Direct-to-video 2005 The Best Man Murray 2006 Electric Apricot: Quest for Festeroo Jonah \"the Taper Guy\" 2006 The TV Set Slut Wars Host 2008 Sex Drive Ezekiel 2009 Old Dogs Craig White 2010 Iron Man 2 Expo Fan Cameo[41] 2011 Mars Needs Moms Milo Motion capture only, was also the original voice of Milo during production, voice-over work cut.[42] 2011 The Story of Luke Zack 2013 Sexy Evil Genius Zachary Newman 2013 Dear Mr. Watterson Himself Documentary 2013 I Know That Voice Himself Documentary 2014 Guardians of the Galaxy Howard the Duck (voice) Uncredited cameo[43] 2014 The Identical Dino 2014 Yellowbird Yellowbird (voice) [40] 2015 Wrestling Isn't Wrestling DX Fan Short film 2015 Krampus Lumpy (voice) [40] 2016 Holidays Pete Gunderson 2017 The Lego Batman Movie King Kong (voice) [44] 2017 Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 Howard the Duck (voice) [40] 2018 A Futile and Stupid Gesture Christopher Guest 2018 Dear Dictator Dr. Charles Seaver 2019 Shazam!
