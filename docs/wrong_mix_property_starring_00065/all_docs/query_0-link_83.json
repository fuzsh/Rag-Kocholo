        "text": "By Peter M. Nichols\n\nlued to the Jerry Springer show on their surveillance screens, NATO early-warning team members notice something truly alarming. That bullet-headed nut case in the fistfight with the Ku Klux Klan Grand Dragon looks suspiciously like Dr. Evil (Mr. Myers). Come to think of it, bullet head's son, Scott Evil (Mr. Green), said it all when he introduced the Springer segment: ''My Father Is Evil, and He Wants to Take Over the World.''\n\nUnaware of Evil's escape from outer space (don't ask), Austin Powers (Mr. Myers), the manic yellow-toothed international man of mystery from the original Powers adventure (1997), parties on with his bride, Vanessa (Ms. Hurley). Suddenly she reveals herself to be Evil's robot, sprays him with bullets from her breasts, which turn into machine guns, and detonates.\n\nThat frees Austin to resume womanizing, which he celebrates with a romp through a hotel wearing nothing but the simian hairdo blanketing his chest. Charged with reapprehending Evil, he then goes time traveling to 1969, where the Carnaby Street scene is enlivened by the agent Felicity Shagwell (Ms. Graham).\n\nAll the while, Evil schemes to destroy Washington with a laser beam. ''Great plan, Einstein,'' says Scott Evil, a sarcastic Generation X-er who accuses his father of a ''Star Wars'' rip-off. The doctor also robs Austin of his ''mojo'' (this movie's version of the Force), which fuels sexual appetite. Now there's a crisis.\n\nMike Myers, Heather Graham, Seth Green, Verne J. Troyer, Michael York, Robert Wagner, Mindy Sterling, Will Ferrell, Elizabeth Hurley, Rob Lowe\n\nDirected by Jay Roach\n\nPG-13 95 minutes About the Family Movie Guide."
