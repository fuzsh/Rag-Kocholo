I've long considered this one the best in the franchise and there are a couple slanted factors at play here. I still stand by my original assessment, even ruling these out, but I, once again, can't say I enjoyed it quite as much as I did at the time of its release.\nFirst and foremost of the factors skewing both 1999's and 2024's assessments is Heather f*cking Graham. The absolute foxwork at play here is timeless and both Grunge Holdover Ryan and Arctic Blond Ryan are in absolute agreement and will full on admit that Ms. Graham utterly ruined the chance of a 100% fair comparison to other entries. The screencap rabbit hole was real here and you can venture most of it with me past slide 2. Caramba.\nSecondly, this was one of the last movies I ever took in at the drive-in -- certainly the last good one. The end of an era that I enjoyed very very much. It was a blast to see in the car, free to party it up and laugh balls. This made the film something of a monument to me.\nSeparated from these factors, yeah, I'll still say this one pops the first. While it follows a similar formula, the experience is expanded. More action, more exploitation, more gags, more memorable characters (Mini Me and Fat Bastard yo!!!) and TWO excellent, Bond-inspired evil lairs. Furthermore, the time travel mechanic (hilariously pointed out on screen as extremely dubious at best) allows for a cool flip to the original concept.\nThe music's still groovy, even if a bit more contemporary is thrown in this round.\nAgain, tho, I found MUCH of the humour extremely dated and cringe. It still favours the repetitive buzzword slogs that ain't gonna get funnier by being drawn-out. Your mileage may again vary, but I don't know how it'd play to an audience that wasn't around at the time.\nFave bits: Shadow show and Independence Day.\nMoral of the story: \"You don't give a man a shot in the pills. It's just not cricket.\" âœŒ\n#austinpowersthespywhoshaggedme #austinpowers\".",
