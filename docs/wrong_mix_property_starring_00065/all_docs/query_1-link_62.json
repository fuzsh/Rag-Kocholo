        "text": "READER RATING:\n\nPlot Summary\n\nDr. Evil is back and has invented a new time machine that allows him to go back to the 1960s and steal Austin Powers' mojo, inadvertently leaving him \"shagless\". (from IMDb)\n\nFilm Review\n\nAustin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me is one of those movies where part of you wants to see, but another part knows you probably shouldn't. So, since I went with a friend who wanted to see it, for their birthday, I decided to go along so I can see for myself what the movie would be like and to be able to write about it. So, well, it was better than I thought it would be... and worse than I thought it would be...\n\nLike I heard one reviewer on TV say, the first half-hour or so was really funny, with minor innuendo and vulgarity, till the crudity ramped up to a greater degree as the film progressed, thus ruining a great deal of the movie for me. From constant references to \"shagging\" and sex, to Dr. Evil's space ship being shaped like male genitalia, this film is loaded with innuendo. In two scenes showing people spotting Dr. Evil's space ship in the sky, a long slew of rather painful \"nicknames\" for the male reproductive organs spew forth as people describe what it looks like. They're two scenes that truly could have been left out of the movie.\n\nOne plus would be the character Mini-Me, Dr. Evil's mini-clone. Although he bites and gives the middle finger to people three times during the film, his relationship with Dr. Evil always conjures up a ton of laughs. And Austin Powers himself is as funny as ever, especially when he's not being overly crude.\n\nThe language in the film is pretty bad. The worst is in the beginning when Scott Evil and Dr. Evil appear on the Jerry Springer Show, and they all get into a fight. During the commotion, you hear people cursing, but the words are bleeped out. You clearly can read the \"F\" word on people's lips, too, including Dr. Evil's. Also, the name of one of the villains is \"Fat B*stard.\" The \"S\" word is used several times, and as I mentioned earlier, a slew of male slang words are used to the point where you want to fast forward the movie (which unfortunately isn't possible in a theater).\n\nThe violence is high, but mostly of the of slapstick variety. In one scene, Robin Swallows is shot and stabbed and blown up repeatedly without blood, and she still lives. Another guy is thrown into a lava pit and there are yet several other instances.\n\nThe movie was very very crude (Fat B's stool sample/coffee scene, Dr. Evil's spaceship, as well as many others) and at times, very very funny (The \"zip it\" skit, the Crybaby bit and the \"Just the 2 of us\" song spoof). But, overall, while the movie was entertaining, it is by NO means a family or kids' movie. Also, it isn't exactly a movie for Christians to see; some may be able to look past the crude humor and innuendo and laugh at the clean stuff (however rare it does show up), but I wouldn't recommend it.\n\nSo, due to all the above-mentioned stuff and the below-mentioned content breakdown, and how it put a damper on the overall film, I can't give it a high score. - John DiBiase (reviewed: 6/14/99; edited for readability: 5/22/24)\n\nParental Guide: Content Summary\n\nSex/Nudity: Endless amounts of innuendo like with character names like \"Felicity Shagwell,\" and \"Ivana Humpalot.\" A lot of the conversations between Powers and women are suggestive and have double-meanings, although unseen (except for being in bed together), there are several sexual encounters: Dr. Evil with Frau; Austin with Vanessa, Ivana, and Shagwell; Shagwell with Fat B. During the opening sequence, Austin dances around nude and there is either writing cover his crotch or various objects around him (some, disgustingly suggesting what's really there, like various foods on a table, etc...); we see several shots of the cryogenically frozen Powers standing nude in a large glass case with only his hands covering his crotch; Shagwell flashes her bare chest at a guard to distract him (but we don't see it). Again, tons of innuendo as well.\n\nVulgarity/Language: 4 \"s\" words, at least 11 slang words for the male genitals, 1 t*t, 2 h*lls, 4 d*mns, 5 uses of \"shag\" sexually, multiple uses of b*stard (especially with a character named \"Fat B*stard), several uses of b*tch, many uses of \"fr*cken,\" 4 cr*ps, 4 \"a\" words, 1 \"a-h*le\", 5 \"Oh my G-d,\" 4 \"G-d,\" 1 \"g*dd*mn,\" 1 \"J-sus,\" 1 \"Oh G-d,\" 1 \"Chr-st,\" 1 \"J-sus Chr-st,\" 2 \"Lord.\" Also, many curse words including many \"f\" words are bleeped out during a brawl on Jerry Springer.\n\nAlcohol/Drugs: Various instances of alcohol used among the characters.\n\nBlood/Gore: A severed, bloodless fembot hand; A woman is shot with a machine gun in the back, but there is no blood (just gun shot holes in the clothes), she's stabbed with no blood, and then later has small bloody scratches on her face; Tiny bloody scratches on a bandage on Number Two's hand; A little bit of blood on a man's leg that was just shot.\n\nViolence: Lots of shooting, kicking, punching, fighting, biting... slap-stick humor mainly.
