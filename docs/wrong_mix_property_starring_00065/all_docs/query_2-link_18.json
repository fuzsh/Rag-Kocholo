        "text": "In the late ‘90s and early 2000s, the Austin Powers franchise was at full strength. From the popular catch phrases (“Oh, behave!”) to action figures and video games, the franchise had deeply embedded itself in pop-culture.\n\nAt the box office, the three-movie series broke numerous records, and stands as one of the highest grossing comedy franchises in history. But things weren’t always so great. In this article, we’ll look at how Austin Powers turned a slow start into a record-breaking success.\n\nThe Beginning\n\nBefore we dig into the movies, let’s first touch on the origin of the Austin Powers character.\n\nIt all started with Mike Myers and the Burt Bacharach song, “The Look of Love”. One day Myers was listening to the song, and got an idea for a character who was, “a sexy swinger”. For several days after, he joked with his then wife, Robin Ruzan, saying things to her in this new character like, “let’s go in back and shag.”\n\nMyers’ wife soon grew tired of her husband stuck in this character but she did find it funny. She encouraged Myers to write down the idea. From there, Myers wrote the initial screenplay for a movie based around Austin Powers.\n\n“Austin Powers was a tribute to my father, who [introduced me to] James Bond, Peter Sellers, The Beatles, The Goodies, Peter Cook and Dudley Moore.” — Mike Myers\n\nAround this time, the Austin Powers character was making his first public appearance off the screen. In the mid-nineties, Mike Myers formed the band, Ming Tea. The band included frontwoman of The Bangles, Susanna Hoffs, and bassist, Matthew Sweet.\n\nEach member took on a 1960s-inspired persona and performed under pseudonyms. The group performed shows around the Los Angeles area. Later on, two additional members were added, and the band makes an appearance in two of the three Austin Powers movies.\n\nLet’s go back to the Austin Powers script. Myers said the first draft took only two weeks to write but it still needed improvement. Myers showed the script to his friend, Jay Roach. Roach would go on to direct very popular and lucrative comedies, such as Meet the Parents, but at the time he was a mostly unknown director.\n\nRoach read the script and came back with ten pages of typewritten notes. The two then worked together to tighten the script and polish it into a finished product.\n\nThe script was then shopped around Hollywood, but continued to be rejected by studios. At some point, it found its way into the hands of Mike De Luca, who was the president of production at New Line Cinema. De Luca invited Myers to come meet the team at New Line to discuss the movie.\n\nDe Luca felt the script was a wonderfully original concept, and he didn’t want Myers to change a thing about it. Eventually the movie was optioned by the studio but was slow to be greenlit as they searched for the right director.\n\nMyers suggested that Jay Roach should direct, but at first New Line was hesitant to trust Roach. They didn’t just want to hand the job to Myers’ friend, plus, they had concerns about Roach’s previous work.\n\n“ His directing reel was bizarre. It just wasn’t a good reel. It was very low-rent. But he came in and spoke about the movie and looked us in the eye and gave us his vision. And that is what got him the job.” — Mike De Luca\n\nFinally, with all the pieces in place, the studio greenlit Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery for $16.5 million dollars.\n\nThe movie was released in theaters on May 2nd, 1997. Opening weekend numbers were a bit weak, bringing in just $9.5 million. It wasn’t too bad though considering the production budget was conservative. The opening covered over 55% of the budget, and put the film in a strong position to turn a profit.\n\nDuring its run, Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery grossed over $67 million at the worldwide box office. The movie was the sixth-best performing comedy in the US in 1997.\n\nInternational Man of Mystery has been received moderately well by both audiences and critics.\n\nA Smashing Sequel\n\nAustin Powers: International Man of Mystery performed well enough at the box office, but you couldn’t quite call it a smashing success. New Line netted over $50 million from the movie at the worldwide box office, but it still lagged far behind top comedies like, Liar Liar, which netted Universal Pictures over $250 million at the box office in 1997.\n\nHowever, something was coming that would set the stage for the future of Austin Powers. In late October of 1997, International Man of Mystery hit the shelves on VHS and DVD. At the time, DVDs were a new market channel for home releases, and it helped get more eyes on movie. With the combination of VHS and DVDs on the market, the movie quietly grew a significant cult following.\n\nThe successful home release proved to New Line that there was growing demand for more Austin Powers, so the studio approached Myers and Roach for a sequel. Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me was greenlit for a budget of $33 million, double the amount of the first movie.\n\nThis time around, Mike Myers teamed up with Michael McCullers, who had been a writer for Saturday Night Live, and the two co-wrote the screenplay for the sequel.\n\nThe sequel also included some changes to the characters and cast. Myers went from his two main characters in the first film (Austin Powers and Dr. Evil), to three, with the addition of Fat Bastard. Heather Graham was cast to replace Elizabeth Hurley as the female lead, Verne Troyer was added as Dr. Evil’s clone, Mini-Me, and Rob Lowe took the role as a young Number Two.\n\nWhen it came to marketing, New Line was ready to go all-in to make the sequel a success. In the build-up to the release, the studio:\n\n“carefully laid groundwork for the “Powers” sequel, with an almost unprecedented barrage of marketing tie-ins and promotions. Awareness for the film reached stratospheric levels. It was the second-most-anticipated title of the summer after “Phantom Menace.” — June 14, 1999|RICHARD NATALE. L.A Times\n\nThere was no reason to expect the sequel wouldn’t outperform the original, but the actual results were stunning.\n\nThe Spy Who Shagged Me released on June 10th, 1999. Opening weekend crushed it, grossing $54.9 million. It made more in the first weekend than the entire first film alone (domestically).\n\nThe opening even stunned New Line, as their highest estimate projected the film to pull in somewhere around $40 million if everything went well.\n\nThe PG-13 rating of the Austin Powers franchise also provided the advantage of reaching a broader range of viewers.\n\n“We hit every audience. Kids laughed at the slapstick and adults at the jokes.” — Al Shapiro (former Head of Distribution at New Line)\n\nDuring its run, The Spy Who Shagged Me grossed just over $312 million at the worldwide box office. Worldwide, the sequel grossed 365% more than the original movie. An incredible improvement.\n\nThe sequel was far-and-away the top performing comedy in the US in 1999, beating out second place, Big Daddy, by more than $40 million.\n\nAt the time, The Spy Who Shagged Me also broke a couple box office records. It took the top spot for the highest opening during the month of June (all genres), and claimed the title of best comedy opening ever. (Note: These records have since been broken.)\n\nThe Spy Who Shagged Me currently ranks 12th on the all-time list of domestic box office comedies. A massive improvement over the first movie, which currently ranks 296th.\n\nWhile the sequel was no doubt much sillier and more over-the-top, the reception for it was relatively in line with the first movie.\n\nYou might be surprised to know the movie actually received an Oscar nomination in the category of Best Makeup, although it ultimately lost to British film, Topsy-Turvy.\n\nThe Golden Cherry On Top\n\nThe ending of The Spy Who Shagged Me teased a third Austin Powers movie, leaving fans of the franchise excited for more. But not as excited as New Line. The studio hit the jackpot with the movie, and they were eager to do it again.\n\nAustin Powers in Goldmember was greenlit for $63 million, nearly double the budget of the previous movie.\n\nMike Myers once again teamed up with Michael McCullers to co-write the screenplay. Myers also returned his three roles from The Spy Who Shagged Me (Austin Powers, Dr. Evil and Fat Bastard) but this time added a fourth character with the addition of Goldmember.\n\nKeeping in the style of James Bond and Bond girls, Goldmember added a new leading lady. Heather Graham was replaced by Beyoncé.\n\nNow I’m sure you’re familiar with Beyoncé. She’s arguably one of the most famous celebrities in the world. But in case you’re unfamiliar with her early career, Beyoncé had risen to fame in the late ‘90s with her popular group, Destiny’s Child. In the wake of the September 11th attacks in 2001, Destiny’s Child was forced to cancel their international tour, which led to the band taking a hiatus to focus on solo projects. This opened the door for Beyoncé to pursue acting.\n\nShe hadn’t done a big-screen picture before and didn’t have much acting experience. Still, New Line had to be excited to cast someone with such a high level of mainstream popularity. Casting Beyoncé would attract fans of her music, helping draw new viewers to the theater.\n\nBeyoncé wasn’t the only new addition to the cast. Michael Caine joined as Austin’s father and Fred Savage was added as Number Three, or better known as, Mole.\n\nThe movie featured a lengthy list of cameo appearances, including some of the biggest stars at the time.\n\nAustin Powers in Goldmember released on July 26th, 2002. Remember how strongly The Spy Who Shagged Me performed on its opening weekend? Well, Goldmember absolutely smashed those numbers. On opening weekend it pulled in over $73 million.\n\nThe movie set a record for the biggest comedy opening ever, beating out Rush Hour 2, and it also took the top spot for the best July opening ever (all genres), overtaking Planet of the Apes. (Note: These records have since been broken.)\n\nThe strong opening still ranks 2nd on the all-time list of comedy openings, beaten only by The Hangover Part II.\n\nI was surprised to learn that, at the time, only three movies in history had opened better than Goldmember:\n\nSpider-Man\n\nHarry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone\n\nStar Wars: Episode II — Attack of the Clones\n\nDuring its run, Goldmember grossed $296 million at the worldwide box office. The movie destroyed all other comedies in 2002, beating out 2nd place Mr. Deeds by over $86 million.\n\nThe reception for Goldmember was mostly in line with the other two movies, except for the audience score on Rotten Tomatoes.\n\nBefore we wrap up, let’s look at the numbers for all three Austin Powers movies.\n\nOn a total production budget of $112.5 million, the three-movie franchise grossed $676 million at the worldwide box office. Adjust this number for inflation and it easily crosses over a billion dollars.\n\nOf all three movies, The Spy Who Shagged Me performed the best, netting a total profit of $279.3 million.\n\nGoldmember wasn’t terribly far behind, but a higher budget and lower international success held the movie to a net profit of $233.3 million.\n\nBoth Goldmember and The Spy Who Shagged Me rank 10th and 12th on the all-time US comedy list, settling in the top 15 among some iconic names.\n\nThe Future of Austin Powers\n\nThe Austin Powers franchise has left quite the legacy among comedies. New Line took a gamble on the series, expecting modest numbers and likely only one film. The result was a nearly $700 million dollar powerhouse that’s still relevant in pop culture today.\n\nBut the question remains: will there be more Austin Powers in the future?\n\nThe end of Goldmember hinted at another possible sequel, one where Scott takes the evil reins from Dr. Evil, but that fourth movie has never arrived.\n\nThe prospect of another Austin Powers movie has floated around for, more-or-less, the last 20 years. Yet, fans are still waiting.\n\nOver the years, Myers has made some appearances with the Dr. Evil character, and some of the cast recently reunited for a 2022 Super Bowl commercial.\n\nMyers and Roach have repeatedly expressed interest in doing a fourth movie, and no doubt it would be profitable, quite possibly even another big hit. If I had to guess, it seems more likely than not that we’ll see another Austin Powers at some point in the future.\n\nFor now you’ll have to settle for Myers’s new show Netflix show, The Pentaverate."
