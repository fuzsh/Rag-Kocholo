This scholarship was established in 1967 in memory of Cole Porter and his mother Kate Cole Porter. The funds for the scholarships have been provided by Cole’s cousins, the late Jules and Josephine Cole, the late James O. and Alice F. Cole, and Joey Cole Kubesch and her late husband Sidney J Kubesch.\n\nThis scholarship is awarded each year for any graduating senior from Miami County who will major in the fine arts, which includes all phases of music, fine and commercial art, performing art or teaching in any of these fields.\n\nThere are 2 scholarships awarded and are given for 4 years. The first is for $10,000 and the second for $7,500, are to be divided into 4 yearly payments for tuition and expenses.\n\nThis year in 2023, there were 5 applicants from Peru, Maconaquah and North Miami High Schools.
