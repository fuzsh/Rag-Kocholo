        "text": "The Sagamore of the Wabash is an honorary award in the state of Indiana. It is given by the Governor of Indiana under their own criteria, and there is no official record kept of all previous recipients.[1]\n\nThe award was first created by Governor Ralph F. Gates to compete with the Kentucky Colonel title, with the first two Sagamores being Robert A. Taft and Simeon Willis.

Other recipients have included astronauts (Gus Grissom), athletes (Michael Brinegar, Ray LeBlanc), comedians (David Letterman), musicians (Willie Nelson), and presidents (George H. W.
