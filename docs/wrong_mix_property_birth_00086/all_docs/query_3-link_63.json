        "text": "Tony DeSare performs with infectious joy, wry playfulness and robust musicality. Named a Rising Star Male Vocalist in Downbeat Magazine, DeSare has lived up to this distinction by winning critical and popular acclaim for his concert performances throughout North America and abroad. From jazz clubs to Carnegie Hall to Las Vegas headlining with Don Rickles and major symphony orchestras, DeSare has brought his fresh take on old school class around the globe. DeSare has four top ten Billboard jazz albums under his belt and has been featured on the CBS Early Show, NPR , A Prairie Home Companion, the Today Show, and his music has been posted by social media celebrity juggernaut, George Takei. DeSare has also collaborated with Youtube icons Postmodern Jukebox. DeSare's “Lush Life” recording debuted at No. 3 on the Billboard Traditional Jazz Chart and he released Song Diaries Vol. 2 in early 2022, now streaming on all platforms.\n\nNotwithstanding his critically acclaimed turns as a singer/pianist, DeSare is also an accomplished award-winning composer. He not only won first place in the USA Songwriting Contest, but has written the theme song for the motion picture,My Date With Drew, several broadcast commercials and has composed the full soundtracks for the Hallmark Channel's Love Always,Santa, Lifetime's Nanny Nightmare , and Lifetime's new A Welcome Home Christmas. His sound is romantic, swinging and sensual, but what sets DeSare apart is his ability to write original material that sounds fresh and contemporary, yet pays homage to the Great American Songbook. His compositions include a wide-range of romantic, funny, and soulful sounds that can be found on his top-selling recordings.\n\nDeSare’s forthcoming appearances include the Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra, the Houston Symphony, the Nashville Symphony, the Virginia Symphony, and the Artis-Naples/Naples Philharmonic.\n\nDeSare releases new recordings, videos of standards and new originals regularly on his YouTube channel, Apple Music, and Spotify. Follow Tony on Facebook and Instagram, and subscribe on YouTube to stay connected.\n\nDeSare is a Yamaha Artist.\n\nJazz is the great leveler as an art form, and one of today’s most brilliant contemporary jazz artists to bless us with her story is Aubrey Logan.\n\nA singer, trombone player, and a songwriter, her body of work is underscored by the integrity of a performer that is able to stretch herself emotionally across a musical landscape that defies description. Complex and still retaining the intimacy of stories that are both personal and inspiring, Logan is able to bring a wealth of experience to her song writing that touches the deepest part of the human experience.\n\nJohn Manzari is an Ovation Award and Helen Hayes Award nominated dancer, singer, actor, choreographer, and teacher.\n\nStage credits include the Broadway revival of Funny Girl, Bessie Award winning production Ayodele Casel: Chasing Magic, 42ND Street, Maurice Hines: Tappin’ Thru Life, The Wiz is 40: A Celebration in Dance and Music, and Duke Ellington’s Sophisticated Ladies.\n\nTelevision credits include Law & Order SVU, the PBS specials Black Broadway and The Kennedy Center at 50, Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade, Good Morning America, The View, Michael Feinstein at the Rainbow Room, The Jerry Lewis Telethon and So You Think You Can Dance.\n\nConcerts include NYPopsUp, Spoleto Festival,, Fall for Dance, Fall for Dance North (Canada), Amelia Island Dance Festival, and Gold Coast Dance Festival. John can be seen in the documentary about his mentor Maurice Hines: Bring Them Back, the award winning short film Slip, and Leonard Soloway’s Broadway.\n\nJohn partners with the Luther S. Allison trio at venues such as Dizzy’s Jazz Club, Birdland Jazz Club, Little Island NYC, and many others."
