        "text": "At Dukes Memorial Hospital, we're here for your all-around health — and that includes your comfort and convenience while you stay with us, visit patients or stop by for an appointment or procedure. Here's what we have to offer and how and where to find it.\n\nLocation Information:\n\nDukes Memorial Hospital\n\n275 W. 12th Street\n\nPeru, IN 46970\n\n(765) 472-8000\n\nWe are located on the corner of Logan Street/12th Street and Grant Street.\n\nVisiting Policies & Hours\n\nNext to patients, patients' friends and family members are the most important people we know. Spending time with someone who cares during a hospital stay stimulates smiles and lifts spirits — on both sides of the hospital bed. That's why we encourage visitors to come see us, sit, and stay awhile; it's a healthy experience for everyone.\n\nVisiting Hours\n\nVisiting hours may be restricted for short periods during the day for doctor rounding, nurse reports or a change in the patient's health status. We ask that visitors be respectful of patient needs and the comfort and privacy needs of others during their visit.\n\nWash your hands often while visiting our facility. It prevents the spread of germs that can cause infection.\n\nIf you've got a fever, cold or any infection symptoms, please stay home.\n\nDukes Memorial Hospital is a smoking- and tobacco-free campus. Smoking, including the use of e-cigarettes, vaping devices and other similar products, along with the use of any other tobacco products, is not allowed anywhere on the grounds.\n\nDon't bring patients food or candies unless your attending doctor gives permission.\n\nCafeteria\n\nFor the safety of all, only employees, medical staff members, authorized visitors (with wristbands) and first responders (EMS, police, fire) can be served in the cafeteria. Service is carryout only, with no seating permitted and using only disposable items. Questions? (765) 472-8000, ext. 2273.\n\nGift Shop\n\nThe gift shop is a great place to find all kinds of gifts to tell loved ones \"I care.\" Call (765) 472-8000, ext. 1164 for current hours.\n\nAdvance Directives\n\nEach individual has the right to direct his or her own care. Current information about Advanced Directives and Indiana state forms can be found on the Indiana State Department of Health website.\n\nForms included, but not limited to, include:\n\nHealth Care Representative Appointment\n\nLife Prolonging Procedures Declaration\n\nLiving Will Declaration (English and Spanish versions)\n\nOut-of-hospital Do Not Resuscitate Declaration and Order\n\nLearn more at the Indiana State Department of Health website.\n\nParental Consent\n\nIf you're traveling and have to leave your children in the care of someone else, be sure they're protected. Always leave written authorization so your children can receive medical treatment, if needed.\n\nSimply download the form below, fill it out, and leave it with your children's caregiver. An authorized form is valid for one year following the signature date unless the form has been withdrawn with written consent."
