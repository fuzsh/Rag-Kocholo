Hear the story behind their history-making win, and why Trumpet requires the fine-tuned nutrition Purina Pro Plan Sport.\n\nWhat a grand win for “Winston,” a 3-year-old fawn French Bulldog who became the first of his breed to be awarded Best in Show at the 21st annual “National Dog Show Presented\n\nQualified for the 2021 National Open Retriever Championship, Mickey was No. 2 in the Purina High Point Open Retriever standings – an outcome that would play out at the National Open.\n\nA show-off with natural bird sense and spot-on ability, a 4 ½-year-old ticked liver-and-white male English Cocker named “Ike” delivered a perfect balance of independence and teamwork to win the National Open Cocker Championship.\n\nConsistent, quality bird hunting, determination and endurance in multiple National Shoot to Retrieve Association (NSTRA) field trials gave a 4 ½-year-old orange-and-white female English Setter named “Jill” the most points ever recorded.\n\nNatural ability, quick brainwork and a lot of desire pushed a 7 ½-year-old red tick male Beagle to the front to win the National Hunting Beagle Association (NBHA) Sectional Series.\n\nA gorgeous 4 ½-year-old brown brindle female Plott Hound named “Legs” continued her streak of consistency in a truly outstanding year of coonhound bench shows to win the 2021 UKC World Championship in September in Peru, Indiana.\n\nWinning the 2021 Meeker Classic was the crown jewel for “Alice,” a 9 ½-year-old rough black-ticked tricolor Border Collie. One of the toughest sheepdog competitions in North America, arguably the world, drew a large entry of 170 teams.\n\nNatural-born bird sense, keen desire and youthful athleticism came together for a 1 ½-year-old white-and-liver Pointer named “Ivy” who won the New England Open Grouse Championship in her derby career."
