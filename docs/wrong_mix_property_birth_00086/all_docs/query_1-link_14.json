Exemplary Governance Awards for Program Year 2023\n\nList of Individual Awards\n\nList of Board Awards\n\nExemplary Governance Awards\n\nThe purpose of the Exemplary Governance Awards program is to encourage school boards and school board members to engage in continuous learning in their role as school governance leaders for public education.\n\nSchool board membership represents an important responsibility because of the vital role that public schools play for our communities and for the State of Indiana. ISBA is proud to recognize school boards and their members who exhibit a commitment to student success and good governance by engaging in regular and ongoing professional learning and development.\n\nIndividual Awards\n\nIndividual awards are based on points accumulated through attendance at ISBA seminars, workshops, conferences, and other learning events.\n\n​There are four levels of EGA distinction – Commendable, Advanced, Distinguished, and Exemplary. Each award level builds on the foundations of the prior level.\n\n​The point requirements for each award level are as follows:\n\n​Commendable (Level 1) – 75 points\n\nAdvanced (Level 2) – 125 points\n\nDistinguished (Level 3) – 175 points\n\nExemplary (Level 4) - 225 points\n\nBoard Awards\n\nBoard awards are based on the points earned by the individual board members, as well as the completion of certain additional criteria as a unit.\n\n​The requirements for the board-level awards are:\n\nCommendable (Level 1) – A majority of board members attain Commendable individual status (75 points or more)\n\nAdvanced (Level 2) – All board members attain Commendable individual status (75 points or more)\n\nDistinguished (Level 3) – Distinguished boards are second year Advanced boards. Each board member must earn a minimum of 25 additional EGA points. The board must also show evidence of a board retreat with an outside facilitator and complete an annual self-assessment with ISBA\n\n​Exemplary (Level 4) – The highest award a school board can earn from ISBA is the Exemplary Board Award. Click here for details on the criteria for earning the Exemplary Board Award.\n\nFirst Year & Partial Year Board Members\n\nIn order for a board to maintain its status when inducting a new member, that first year or partial year board member is subject to different criteria. Click here for a first-year board member criteria flyer.\n\n​Board members taking office before July 1 :\n\nEarn a minimum of 55 individual EGA points\n\nAttend at least 1 ISBA core meeting\n\n​Board members taking office on or after July 1:\n\nAttend at least 1 ISBA core meeting\n\nAttend at least 1 other educational event (this can be through ISBA or outside of ISBA)\n\nIf a first year board member fails to meet these criteria, but the rest of the board members meet the standard criteria, the board they serve will only drop down 1 EGA level from the previous year.\n\nFirst year board members must follow all standard criteria in order to obtain an individual award.\n\nUp to 10 EGA points per year are possible from outside functions. To request EGA points for non-ISBA meetings/activities, please complete and return the application below. Please note that EGA points for ISBA events and activities are always automatically applied.\n\nEGA Photo Gallery for Program Year 2023\n\nEGA Photo Gallery for Program Year 2022\n\nContact:\n\nHaley Crnarich\n\n​Events and Promotions Specialist\n\n​Phone: 317-639-3590\n\nEmail: [email protected]\n\nOur Sponsors"
