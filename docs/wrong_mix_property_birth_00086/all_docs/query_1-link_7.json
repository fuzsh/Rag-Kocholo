        "text": "Honoring Indiana's Traffic Safety All-stars\n\nEvery day, almost 30 people in the U.S. die in drunk-driving crashes. That's an average of one person approximately every 50 minutes, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Established in 2020, the Traffic Safety All-Star awards program was created by ICJI as a way to recognize law enforcement officers who are going above and beyond to keep road users and their communities safe by working to combat impaired driving.\n\nTo qualify for the award, an officer must have made at least 20 operating while intoxicated arrests and participated in one of the stateâ€™s enhanced enforcement campaigns in the previous year."
