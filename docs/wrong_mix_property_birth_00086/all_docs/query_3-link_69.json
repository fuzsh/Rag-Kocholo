        "text": "Cole Porter’s hilarious musical comedy Anything Goes debuted nearly 90 years ago and was last seen on our stage in 1999. In this tap-dancing romp on the high seas, two unlikely pairs on the S.S. American set sail for true love and a boatload of comedic chaos. Unforgettable songs include “I Get a Kick Out of You,” “You’re the Top” and the showstopping title tune, “Anything Goes.” Come aboard for some good old-fashioned fun!\n\nSet to a timeless and ebullient score by Cole Porter, Anything Goes depicts a comedy of errors aboard the S.S. American, an ocean liner en route to England from New York. At the center of many farcical encounters is the hapless Billy Crocker, a Wall Street broker who hopped aboard in pursuit of Hope Harcourt, a classic ingenue unhappily engaged to a wealthy Englishman, also a passenger. Rounding out the crew are Billy’s pal and nightclub singer Reno Sweeney and a few gangsters and their sidekicks.\n\nRatings and age restrictions are not issued for The Muny’s professionally licensed shows, but we offer the following notes regarding content that may have a bearing on patron comfort.\n\nLanguage • The word hell is used 18 times; damn, five times; and ass, once.\n\nSexual Innuendo • Many scenes contain general references to sexual situations.\n\nDrugs and Alcohol • Characters drink and smoke in multiple scenes.\n\nViolence • A gun is fired several times.\n\nMature Content • The show makes a dated reference to “gypsies” and “an old Australian bush song.” A line of dialogue mentions death by suicide."
