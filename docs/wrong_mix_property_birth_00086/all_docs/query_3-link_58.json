        "text": "Awarded the Jazz Album of the Year at the San Diego 2018 Music Awards\n\nOkay, so get this, Rebecca Jade, Peter Sprague, and Cole Porter. Can you think of anything better? You can't, can you? This is one of those great events when the gods take notice of us mortals. How could anything get any better?\n\nThe obvious dilemma for musicians is how to mine and honor this rich legacy and still make a new and credible musical mark upon Cole Porter's body of work. Here, Sprague succeeds with inventive and fresh arrangements. Rebecca sings with ease and grace and is masterful in developing phrasing that renews these classic tunes. All the performers are tops.\n\nIt is such a joy to review CDs as good as this one. Planet Cole Porter receives my highest recommendation.\n\nSan Diego Troubadour CD Review\n\nJune, 2017 by Paul Hormic\n\nClick here to read the complete review.\n\nPlanet Cole Porter! That’s the name I gave concert curator Ann Chase when she asked me what the “theme” was for an upcoming performance. I wasn’t totally sure what it meant and how the music would sound but as I began selecting songs written by the great Cole Porter, a concept starting coming into focus. My idea was to infuse musical styles that I like — swing, funk, bossa nova, samba, and ballads into music that Cole Porter composed in the 1930’s. His lyrics are beyond clever and his melodies travel to new places, still sounding fresh even though they were written over 75 years ago. I rallied the troupes including the beautiful sound of Rebecca’s voice, we played the concert and the response was stellar. A resounding “you’ve got to record it” chant ensued and we took in that inspiration and in record time pulled together this recording that you now hold in your hand. We’re thrilled to inhabit Planet Cole Porter!\n\nThanks for listening…\n\nPeter Sprague\n\nApril, 2017\n\nTo sing and record tunes that were also sung by many of my jazz inspirations, like Ella and Billie just to name two, is nothing short of a dream come true. Although I sing many styles of music, jazz is my foundation and I have always wanted to record a jazz album, but I didn't want to pick just any songs. A theme was desired, but I didn't know in which direction to go. When this opportunity came to sing and record Peter's amazing arrangements of Cole Porter tunes, it matched up beautifully with what I envisioned for myself and I am so proud to now have a record of jazz classics, written by one of America's great composers, done in a fun and unique way. I hope you enjoy listening as much as we enjoyed making this record!\n\nRebecca Jade\n\nApril, 2017\n\n1) Planet Cole Porter\n\n2) Just One of Those Things\n\n3) Night and Day\n\n4) All Of You\n\n5) Ev'ry Time We Say Goodbye\n\n6) Love For Sale\n\n7) Let’s Do It\n\n8) I Get a Kick Out of You\n\nAll tunes composed by Cole Porter except\n\n“Planet Cole Porter” composed by\n\nPeter Sprague © Satyam Music / BMI\n\nAll arrangements by Peter Sprague\n\nIn the band:\n\nRebecca Jade — vocals\n\nPeter Sprague — guitar and organ\n\nTripp Sprague — sax, flute, and harmonica\n\nGunnar Biggs — acoustic bass\n\nDuncan Moore — drums\n\nwith special guests\n\nScott Kyle — trombone on “Just One of Those Things” and “Love For Sale”\n\nTommy Aros — percussion on \"Night and Day\", \"All Of You\", and \"Love For Sale\".\n\nProduced by Peter Sprague\n\nRecorded at SpragueLand Studios, Encinitas, CA / 2017\n\nRecorded, mixed, and mastered by Peter Sprague at SpragueLand Studios\n\nArt direction and design by RixGraphix\n\nSpecial thanks to Ann and David Chase and Iron Horse Amps."
