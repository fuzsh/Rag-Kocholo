For more than two decades Susan Veatch Cantrell honored Wabash men and their families by telling their stories with her words: feature articles in Wabash Magazine, official citations and tributes, stories about students, and even regular newsletters to parents. They were eloquent essays, sometimes touching or leavened with a sense of humor, that captured the essence of a person. Susan's love affair with Wabash started early. She grew up in Crawfordsville with a singing voice so fine and clear that it was often likened to the sound of a bell. She even had the lead in the Wabash College production of Guys and Dolls when she was in high school. Later, as a sophomore music major at Indiana University, she decided she didn't want a career in music. Her voice teacher reportedly cried when she told him. A determined individual, Susan left Bloomington for Washington, D.C., with no job and no connections. She started as a librarian in a mobile library truck, then joined the staff of Republican Charles Percy of Illinois and worked her way up to writing his speeches. She went on to have her own broadcasting career at WCBS radio in New York City and WBBM in Chicago. Through it all, Susan's genuine interest in people, their lives, and the things that mattered to them earned her many, many friends-from farmers to judges, from prominent politicians such as New York Governor Mario Cuomo and CEOs, to the woman who lived next door. Susan's love for Wabash is clearly demonstrated and anchored in her philanthropy as she knew that Wabash men will go on to shape and change the world for the better, something she cared deeply about.\n\nMartha A.

Kip and Nicole's belief in the power of philanthropy and a liberal arts education to transform young people's lives inspired them to take a giant step for future generations of Wabash students and establish the Chase Family Scholarship. The purpose of the Fund shall be to provide scholarship support for Wabash students with demonstrated financial need, who are enrolled full-time at the College, and who are in their sophomore, junior, or senior years of study.
