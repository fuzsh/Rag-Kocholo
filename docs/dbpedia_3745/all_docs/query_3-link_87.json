        "text": "Sunday, May 31, 1998 - Christopher Gardner of Bloomingburg, 3 years old.\n\nChristopher Gardner, tortured.\n\nBattered. Burned with cigarettes. Sexually abused.\n\nPunched. Head slammed.\n\nLeft to die.\n\nWe agreed the cops at the scene, the ambulance corps who carried the boy's body, the reporters who wrote about it, the readers who read it in horror.\n\nWe all vowed we would not forget.\n\nWhen we learned that Christopher's abuse had twice been reported to the state registry and was never investigated, we said never again. At long last, enough madness. Fix the damn system so we can save the children.\n\nThat's exactly what people said in 1995 after Elisa Izquierdo was murdered. She was the 6-year-old who was chained to a bed in a dark room all day long. She was hung from a shower rod.\n\nHer parents were initially charged with a misdemeanor. The girl was dead.\n\nThe governor appointed a commission to be headed by state Attorney General Dennis Vacco. The Legislature passed a quick law about family court. They called it Elisa's Law.\n\nIt was good for a press conference. A spot on TV news. But the commission recommended so much more be done.\n\nYes, yes, said legislative leaders. That was a year and a half ago.\n\nSince then, the Legislature has done virtually nothing. Oh, they've introduced bills, mostly languishing in committee. Bills that would make hunting down child abuse easier, make penalties swifter and sterner.\n\nBut each party, each house, passes its own bills that go nowhere. Listen, when the Legislature wants to get something accomplished, it's done in three hours. Beaten children just don't have lobbyists throwing these guys cocktail parties.\n\nWhile the Legislature achieved nothing, children died. In 1996 alone, 84 New York children were murdered by child abusers.\n\nWhile the Legislature achieved nothing, Nadine Lockwood, four years old, was starved to death.\n\nWhile the Legislature achieved nothing, Christopher Gardner was burned and battered and bludgeoned.\n\nWhen the bloody dying boy was discovered, hardened cops wept. Strangers still pass by his grave to place flowers. The outrage here is so great, a third of all daily letters to the editor have been about Christopher Gardner.\n\nNever again, say the letter writers, we must take action.\n\nThe Legislature has met our outrage with stone silence.\n\nAnd so the cruel death of Christopher Gardner is the horror to end all horrors. Until the next time. Until another child is ripped, beaten and murdered.\n\nAnother session of the state Legislature is about to end. By the end of next month, the Legislature will be on paid vacation for the rest of the year. The child protection bills aren't even on their radar screen.\n\nState Sen. Charles Cook represents Christopher Gardner's district.\n\nThe Senator said Friday he has never heard of Christopher Gardner.\n\nShould the Legislature be allowed to go on vacation before they take action on vital child protection bills? Yes or No? Tell us what you think and we'll pass on your comments to your state legislator.\n\nCall us at 343-2181, Ext. 1459. Outside the Middletown calling area, dial 1-800-295-2181, Ext. 1459."
