        "text": "Studying to be an elementary teacher, you are supposed to know the different types of child abuse, how to recognize it and what to do. Child abuse is a sore subject but more complex than one would think.\n\n\"There are over 3 million reports of child abuse are made every year in the United States and almost five children die everyday as a result of child abuse. More than three out of four are under the age of 4. Ninety percent of child sexual abuse victims know the perpetrator in some way; 68% are abused by family members. Child abuse occurs at every socio-economic level, across ethnic and cultural lines, within all religions and at all levels of education.\"\n\nPhysical abuse is not simply spanking your child when they do wrong, but taking the punishment to the extent. It is the easiest to spot because physical abuse can leave marks such as burns, bruises, welts or cuts. The child also may be subjected to death threats, having objects thrown at him/her and starvation or denying water.\n\nSexual abuse is a little harder to diagnose as the child may not always say something. If the child is young enough they may say something about being touched where they did not want to, but a general amount of the time the child is either threatened by the assailant or bribed by treats and toys. It is considered sexual abuse if someone has viewed the child nude or touched them in ways that are illegal. Effects can include depression, post-traumatic stress, anxiety and much more. Most of the time a child knows their assailant.\n\nVerbal abuse may lead to emotional abuse. Examples of verbal abuse are submitting the child to ridicule, sending them mixed messages, yelling and putting them down.\n\nExample: \"You are so worthless, can't you do anything right? You are so stupid, I don't even know why I bother with you.\"\n\nNeglect is not providing the child with the proper means to live such as education, medical means and food. If a child is subjected to starvation and dehydration, then it is neglect. As it is if the child breaks their arm and are not taken to a doctor.\n\nMyths about child abuse:\n\nMyth Only bad people abuse their children.\n\nFact: While it's easy to say that only \"bad people\" abuse their children, it's not always so black and white. Not all abusers are intentionally harming their children. Many have been victims of abuse themselves, and don’t know any other way to parent. Others may be struggling with mental health issues or a substance abuse problem.\n\nMyth: Child abuse doesn't happen in “good” families.\n\nFact: Child abuse doesn't only happen in poor families or bad neighborhoods. It crosses all racial, economic and cultural lines. Sometimes, families who seem to have it all from the outside are hiding a different story behind closed doors.\n\nMore myths/facts and information\n\nSome cases on child abuse:\n\nUrsula Sunshine Assaid was five years old when she died. She lived with her mother and her mother's boyfriend. She was tortured by him for 55 hours, starved, denied water, forced to eat soap and stand naked while reciting the alphabet. After her death she was dumped into a retention pond. She even has a book about her out called \"Death From Child Abuse... And No One Heard.\"\n\nCharnae Wise was five years old when she died. Charnae was forced to live in the basement of her house where she was left with little food and forced to use the bathroom in a bucket. Her remains were found in the garbage. Her body weighed in at 12 pounds, with the head detatched from the body.\n\nNadine Lockwood was just barely five and weighed almost sixteen pounds.\n\nElisa Izquierdo's mother believed she was possessed by the devil. She'd had her head slammed into the wall and used as a mop.\n\nAnd of course, we all know of the most recent case, TheCasey Anthony trial. Her daughter Caylee had been missing for a month before the police finally stepped in and her remains found months later buried not far from the Anthony home.\n\nSee more child abuse cases as well as what their murderers were sentenced to"
