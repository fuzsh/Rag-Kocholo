        "text": "Over the recent years, child abuse has become a very common and extremely dangerous thing.\n\nThere are so many forms of child abuse: whether sexually, physically, emotionally and or mentally.\n\nEvery year more than 3 million reports of child abuse are made in the United States. It's a terrible epidemic we need to put a stop to.\n\nThere are different types of child abuse:\n\nPhysical abuse of a child is when a parent or caregiver causes any non-accidental physical injury to a child. There are many signs of physical abuse. If you see any of the following signs, please get help right away.\n\n28.3% of adults report being physically abused as a child.\n\nSexual abuse occurs when an adult uses a child for sexual purposes or involves a child in sexual acts. It also includes when a child who is older or more powerful uses another child for sexual gratification or excitement.\n\n20.7% of adults report being sexually abused as a child.\n\nWhen a parent or caregiver harms a child's mental and social development, or causes severe emotional harm, it is considered emotional abuse. While a single incident may be abuse, most often emotional abuse is a pattern of behavior that causes damage over time.\n\n10.6% of adults report being emotionally abused as a child.\n\nChild neglect is when a parent or caregiver does not give the care, supervision, affection and support needed for a child's health, safety and well-being. Child neglect includes:\n\nPhysical neglect and inadequate supervisionEmotional neglectMedical neglectEducational neglect\n\nAn example of someone who died due to child abuse is Elisa Izquierdo(February 11, 1989 – November 22, 1995) she was a six-year-old – girl who was beaten to death by her mother Awilda Lopez, a drug addict, in 1995. The life and death of Elisa Izquierdo first made city and then national headlines when it became clear that New York City's Child Welfare System (now the ) missed numerous opportunities to intervene with her family and to save her life. In November 1991, Awilda Lopez secured the right to obtain unsupervised visitation rights to Elisa: this ruling awarded her custody of the child every second weekend. Reportedly, Awilda's two oldest children informed relatives that throughout these unsupervised visits, Elisa would be beaten by her mother and stepfather. These relatives did not inform authorities of these revelations.\n\nBoth Elisa's father and her teachers noted the child bore bruising and other signs of physical mistreatment when she returned from these unsupervised visits. One of the locations of these injuries was Elisa's genitalia and the child did divulge that her mother had repeatedly hit her, adding that she had no desire to see her (her mother) again. Her father also noted that Elisa had begun in addition to losing control of her bowels. Another family acquaintance noted that Elisa would always vomit upon her return from these visits to her mother, and refused to enter bathrooms.\n\nBoth Gustavo Izquierdo and Elisa's teachers did inform authorities of the abuse Elisa was enduring. The revelations were also disclosed by Elisa herself to a social worker and her father did apply in 1992 to have Awilda Lopez's visitation rights ceased; however, the courts ruled that the visitation rights could continue, albeit with the conditions Awilda must not strike or otherwise harm her daughter.\n\nIn 1993, Gustavo Izquierdo formed plans to relocate with Elisa to his native Cuba. He is known to have purchased airline tickets for himself and his daughter for May 26, 1994. However, Gustavo was admitted to hospital with (subsequently diagnosed as ). Gustavo Izquierdo died on May 26; the same date he had planned to travel to with his daughter . This caused Awilda, her mother, to gain full custody.\n\nUpon being awarded full custody of her daughter, Awilda moved her daughter from the school she had been attending, and enrolled her in a local public school, where Elisa was observed to be and uncommunicative. The principal of the school also noted that Elisa bore bruises and walked with apparent difficulty. Neighbors also reported hearing sounds of Elisa being beaten and otherwise abused; later reporting hearing Elisa's repeatedly pleading with her mother to stop hitting her and stating such pleas as: \"Mommy, Mommy, please stop! No more! I'm sorry.\" Some neighbors did report their suspicions of child abuse to child welfare authorities; however, no effective action was taken. Other indignities and abuse inflicted by Awilda upon her daughter (some of which were witnessed by Elisa's siblings) included repeated punching; forcing the child to eat her own feces; mopping the floor with Elisa's hair; inflicting burns upon the child's head, face and body and sexually violating her with a hairbrush. Awilda's partner, Carlos Lopez (himself also a regular user of drugs) is also known to have repeatedly physically abused Elisa.\n\nOn November 15, Carlos Lopez was jailed in relation to a violation of parole. Seven days later, on the evening of November 22, Awilda phoned one of her sisters, Mercy Torres, to report that Elisa was \"like on the bed\", with fluid (later determined to be brain fluid) leaking from her nose and mouth. In addition, Lopez informed her sister that Elisa would not eat or drink. When Mrs. Torres insisted Awilda take Elisa to the hospital, Awilda replied she would \"think about it\" after she had finished cleaning the dishes. The following morning, Awilda contacted a neighbor, whom she invited to view Elisa's lifeless body. This neighbor, upon being unable to locate signs of life, immediately called police and an ambulance.\n\nIn custody, Awilda initially confessed to having thrown Elisa head-first into a concrete wall two days prior to her contacting her neighbor, adding that Elisa neither talked nor walked after this incident. A subsequent autopsy revealed numerous injuries including broken fingers (one bone of which was protruding through the skin), damage to internal organs, deep and burns across her head, face and body. In addition, her genitalia and rectum also bore evidence of trauma, including tearing. Forensically, it was proven that the injuries had been sustained over a prolonged period of time.\n\nElisa Izquierdo's funeral was held on November 29, 1995. Prior to her burial, a was held, with an estimated 300 mourners in attendance. Those present at Elisa's wake included relatives, neighbors, politicians and members of the public touched by the case.\n\nElisa's casket was open throughout this ceremony. A single red rose was placed in her hand, and her coffin adorned with white flowers. Many mourners placed additional flowers, toys, stuffed animals and notes of sympathy in and upon her coffin prior to her casket being closed and her burial at . Elisa's gravestone bears a plaque, with the inscription reading: \"World please watch over the children.\"\n\nOn June 25, 1996, Awilda Lopez pleaded guilty to the of her daughter. The following month, she was sentenced to a term of 15 years to . Although Lopez initially became eligible for parole in 2010, she has remained incarcerated since August 1996. As of January 2017, she was serving her sentence at the maximum security , with her next parole hearing scheduled for July 2018.\n\nLopez was most recently denied parole in July 2018; her next scheduled parole hearing being is in July 2020.\n\nMany people have died, just because they were abused one way or another. But we can help put a stop to this; whether we are five years old or 20 years of age, we can make change in our own little way. The first thing we can do to help stop the abuse of children is to create the awareness of this issue through school speeches, local campaigns, or even talking about child abuse with your friends because together we can make a difference.\n\nIf you are out there and you have been abused, I want you to know that you should not live in silence but rather, contact any child care services, talk to a family member or a trusted adult. You are not alone and you won't be alone.\n\nA/N\n\ndon't know why but I am just passionate about this topic and that is why I decided to write about it today"
