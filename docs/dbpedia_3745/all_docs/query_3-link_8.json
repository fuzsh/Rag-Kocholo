        "text": "The five children watched helplessly as their parents forced Elisa Izquierdo to drink ammonia and eat her own feces. They watched as their parents sexually assaulted her and beat her until the white bones gleamed through her brown fingers. The children survived the violence that killed their sister, Elisa, but they landed in foster care with shattered lives and damaged psyches.\n\nChild welfare officials, who investigated 6-year-old Elisa's death in November 1995, suggested that the city sever ties between the abusive parents and their surviving children, and have the children adopted so they could begin to recover from the severe psychological trauma in stable, nurturing homes.\n\nBut nearly three years after the killing, the woman imprisoned for Elisa's murder still retains the legal rights to her five surviving children, who are 5 to 13 years old. Four of the five siblings have bounced through more than four foster homes as city officials have fallen months behind their own timetable in setting the children on the road to adoption.\n\nIn death, Elisa Izquierdo became a national symbol of all that was wrong with child welfare in New York City, exposing the sloppy investigations that allowed her to suffer and die while under the city's watch. And in some ways, her siblings' long journey through the child welfare system highlights a less sensational but far more common problem: the experience of thousands of children who languish in foster care for years without finding permanent homes.\n\nThe median stay in foster care has declined from four years to three years since 1996, which both city officials and advocates for children say is still too long for many children to wait for stability. The city wants to reduce it further, to below 2.4 years.\n\nBut the story of Elisa's siblings also reflects the legal and bureaucratic barriers that often prevent child welfare officials from quickly severing the bonds between parents and their children, even when a parent has killed a child.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
