        "text": "Prosecutors laid out the details of their charges in a clinical, 30-second presentation yesterday in State Supreme Court in Manhattan: Awilda Lopez had badly beaten Elisa Izquierdo, her 6-year-old daughter, and then allowed her to lie, dying and unaided, for nearly two days. The judge, loudly and bluntly, then asked the only question left: \"Ms. Lopez, is that what happened?\"\n\nMs. Lopez, who had entered the courtroom limping and fighting for breath, rocked slightly in her chair, spoke with her lawyer, cried quietly. Prosecutors had offered the 29-year-old Ms. Lopez a sentence of 15 years to life in exchange for pleading guilty to her daughter's murder. Ms. Lopez's first, mumbled response of \"O.K.\" only angered the judge.\n\nDon't O.K. me,\" thundered Justice Alvin Schlesinger. \"You are not making a bargain. Is that what happened?\"\n\nMs. Lopez, barely audible, at last said, \"Yes, it happened.\"\n\nThat three-word answer ended a chapter in the case of Elisa Izquierdo, an example of child abuse that has produced outrage, legislation and the Mayor's promise to overhaul New York City's child welfare agency.\n\n\"She is horrified by her own actions,\" Daniel J. Ollen, Ms. Lopez's lawyer, said after her court appearance. \"But it is hard for her to acknowledge what she did. It is hard for her to say the words.\"\n\nUnder the arrangement, Ms. Lopez, who officially pleaded guilty to second-degree murder, is to serve at least 15 years in prison before she is eligible for parole. Had she been convicted at trial, she could have been sentenced to 25 years to life.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
