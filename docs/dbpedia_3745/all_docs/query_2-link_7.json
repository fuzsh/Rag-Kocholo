        "text": "This thread might be a bit too long, but it's important for you to read most of what I have to say here because I am going to include some examples relating to my argument that women can be perpetrators of abuse against children. Also, this is going to be a story that is going to be very difficult to read and it might trigger some people, so if you don't want to read about a child getting beaten to death, then skip this thread.\n\nNow we all hear stories about how men shouldn't be working around with kids because it's assumed that \"all men are potential child molesters and pedophiles\". Keep in mind that male pedophiles only account for 1%-5% of all men. It is true that most people who are caught sexually abusing children are men, although I'm not denying that women can't also be sexual abusers or that most men are child molesters.\n\nBut most people don't talk about females abusing children. People like to think that women are benevolent with children and can't do nor harm against them, given most people who hold jobs involving children such as teaching and daycare workers are often women and mothers often winning custody of their kids at court. But we can't deny or ignore the fact that women do abuse kids, especially given the fact that women often have more access to children and can hide the fact that they are abusing kids.\n\nI was thinking about this after watching a video on Death Addict of a female maid in Uganda repeatedly slapping an 18 month-old girl for refusing to eat food and then slamming her to the ground and beating the toddler with an object as well as stomping and kicking her on the floor after vomiting. Watching that video made me very pissed off and disgusted as I DO NOT tolerate abuse against ANY CHILD, being the victim of physical child abuse myself. And it got me thinking given the fact that this is a woman physically abusing an infant who was under her care, but yet men are often seen as perpetrators of child abuse on the media.\n\nAnd then I came across the case of Elisa Izquierdo:\n\nShe was born on 1989 in New York City by her father Gustavo Izquierdo, a Cuban immigrant who was an aspiring dance teacher and worked at the homeless shelter where he met her mother Awilda Lopez, a Puerto Rican-American who was a drug addict having had two children prior and regularly used crack cocaine during her pregnancy. After she was born, the mother lost custody of her daughter due to her drug addiction and was under the full care of her father.\n\nGustavo was a devout Christian and a loving father to Elisa and wished the best for her, having enrolled her daughter to a private Montessori school and later enrolled in the prestigious Brooklyn Friends School which was paid for by Prince Michael of Greece and Denmark. Eventually Awilda married Carlos Lopez who was also a drug addict and had three more children together, and claimed that she has become clean and ended her addiction, and was awarded partial unsupervised custody for Elisa as well as custody of of her two oldest children.\n\nRelatives reported that Elisa was neglected and beaten by her mother and step-father during these visits although initially these incidents went unreported to the police, and was discovered by her father and teaches that she had bruises and injuries, including on her genitals and that she started bedwetting, refusing to enter bathrooms, and frequently vomiting every time she visited her mother.\n\nGustavo as well as her teachers eventually reported this abuse the Child Welfare Administration with Elisa even reporting her abuse by her own mother to a social worker. However, the court rejected her father's requests to have Awilda's visitation revoked.\n\nEventually, Gustavo bought a plane ticket for himself and his daughter to go back to Cuba in order to escape her mother's abuse in 1994, but unfortunately he died the same day he was due to leave for Cuba.\n\nAfter her father's death, Awilda applied for full custody of her daughter Elisa, which was challenged by the cousin of Elisa's father, Elisa Canizares, who had knowledge of the extensive abuse and also applied for custody. Whereas Canizares did not had legal representation in this case, Awilda was backed by a lawyer provided by the Legal Aid Society and a federally-funded parenting program. Two head teachers from Elisa's private school as well as Prince Michael of Greece wrote letters supporting awarding custody to Canizares. In addition Awilda lied on court that she was free from drug abuse and that Elisa wanted to be with her mom Unfortunately, Awilda and Carlos Lopez was awarded full custody of Elisa by Judge Phoebe Greenbaum.\n\nAfter the death her father Gustavo and now under the custody of her mother and step-father, the abuse has gotten far worse. She was withdrawn from her previous private school and placed on PS 126 public school. She was locked in a dark room, had sections of her hair ripped out, had difficulty walking properly, was forced to use a chamber pot instead of the bathroom, was deprived of food forced to consume her own waste, was penetrated using a hair brush and toothbrush, and her hair was used to mop the floors resulting in burns to her scalp, all in front of her other siblings and believing that Elisa was possessed by the devil. Her neighbors could even hear the child screaming in pain. The public school and her neighbors alerted Child Welfare Administration, also rejecting the claim of child abuse because \"there was not enough evidence to support the claim\". Elisa was eventually withdrawn from school.\n\nOn November 1995, Elisa was beaten so badly to the point that she suffered severe brain damage and leaking cerebrospinal fluid out of her nose and mouth. She contacted her sister who insisted to call an ambulance, however Awilda refused to called an ambulance and the next day she invited her neighbor to inspect her daughter who was unconscious. The neighbor eventually called for help, but it was already too late, and the 6-year-old was already found dead at the scene.\n\nHer autopsy reveals that she had broken bones including one protruding out of one of her fingers, damage to internal organs, burns on her skin, and damage to her genitals and bowels.\n\nThis bitch got 15 years to life in prison. Hope she never leaves and rots in her prison cell. Her husband Carlos was sentenced to only one-and-a-half to three years in prison.\n\nThis is a tragic and disturbing example of child abuse inflicted by women, and women often gaining custody over the children giving them unfair advantage because they are women and not taking to account if the mother was abusive and the father was actually a good parent. Not all fathers are neglectful and careless deadbeats who leave their child behind, and not all mothers are protective and loving over their children. And often these women take advantage of the fact that they are seen as the caregivers to hide their abuse.\n\nAnd there are many more examples on the news and elsewhere of mothers abusing and even murdering their own children. Remembered the 1994 case of Susan Smith, who drowned her two young sons inside her car into a lake and claimed that Black man kidnapped them?\n\nAccording to the Mark Rosenthal's Breaking the Silence, around 71% of children murdered by a family member in the US was killed by their own mother between 2001 and 2006, and according to the Washington Post, when fathers alleged that the child has been physically abused by the mother, the mother is more likely to win custody over the child, often seen as an excuse by the father to deny her custody.\n\nNow, I'm not trying to say that men can't be neglectful or abusive over their own child, not just sexually but also physically and psychologically. I have absolutely NO TOLERANCE for child abuse, whether it be physical or psychological trauma or sexual molestation. But people also have to start thinking about women as perpetrators as well and stop claiming that \"men are evil\" and that we are always the perpetrators. And by including these examples I am not trying to glorify or diminish these instances of abuse.\n\nAnd seeing any case of child abuse makes me realize that this world is over and fucked up, and that sometimes it's best to rope than to know about such cruelty.\n\nSources and External Links:\n\nhttps://forum.deathaddict.co/threads/extreme-abuse-maid-charged-for-stomping-baby.14004/ There are other examples of child abuse on Death Addict\n\nThe Shameful Death of Elisa Izquierdo • Morbidology\n\nThe tragic case of Elisa Izquierdo is an all-too-familiar tale of bureaucratic ineptitude. She was known by New York's Child Welfare Administration but their inaction led to her being murdered by her abusive mother.\n\nMaternal Child Abuse and its Association with Maternal Anxiety in the Socio-Cultural Context of Iran\n\nThe prevalence of parental violence has been an area of major public concern. There are few available data detailing the ways parents and other caregivers discipline children, particularly in low and middle income countries. This study focuses on the ...\n\nit is what it is, and yea according to the law foids determines who has the right to procreate and who does not, they have the monopoly of sex. It's really shocking, cuse society is gynocentrist, everything in favor of foids doesn't matter who dies, men or children, look at the titanic the ones that were saved was most foids. HH\n\nYeah, I know. It kinda explains why women have abortions.\n\nTbh, I'm not sure if I would like to have biological kids or not. If I was looking for a woman that I want to marry and start a family with I would make sure that she isn't crazy and shares my values. And it's things like divorce and custody that kinda scare me if I'm having kids.\n\nBut maybe if I'm just looking for a woman to have casual sex with or an escort I would make sure to wear a condom, but if something should happened and I accidentally got her pregnant, then I have to accept my responsibilities of being a father and raising that potential child. I'm not just gonna throw in the towel and, if the child doesn't get aborted, be raised by a single mom under that type of environment. If I was man enough to have consensual sex with a woman then I should be man enough to raise it. Ultimately if the woman wants to abort it or not is not going to be my choice, and if she does abort I would feel very bad because my own child was killed just for my own 15 minutes of pleasure with some whore.\n\nSome people might hate on me for saying this, but if you got a woman pregnant, it's your responsibility to raise it if it's your seed. I don't like deadbeat parents and I wouldn't abandoned my own flesh and blood even if it was conceived with some ugly thot. Same with women. I find it pretty selfish for a woman to abort her pregnancy knowing that she had unprotected consensual sex because she doesn't want to put up with the responsibility of a child. Ultimately both parties are at fault because each consented knowing the consequence. If you don't want to get pregnant, then don't have sex at all or at least use birth control beforehand.\n\nWomen are primitive creatures and can't do basic tasks properly\n\nRemembered the victim in this case was a girl"
