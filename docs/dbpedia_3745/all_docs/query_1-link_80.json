        "text": "Cityside Archive\n\nJuly 16, 2001\n\nTales Out of School\n\nHarlem-bred, Harvard-educated Irving Hamer -- the only African-American on the school board -- is an unpredictable loner. But a vote this spring made him everybody's favorite target.\n\nFebruary 19, 2001\n\nSigns of the Times\n\nA world away from Mylar building \"wraps\" and dot-com neon, Brooklyn billboards still trumpet by-gone businesses like Eagle Clothes.\n\nMay 15, 2000\n\nThe Laptop Nomads\n\nThey're in every Starbucks and coffee shop; even sometimes in churches. Who are they? What are they typing? Don't they have a job? For the first time, one of these strangers speaks.\n\nMarch 13, 2000\n\nThe Roots of Outrage\n\nThe Diallo case is making even moderate black leaders like Calvin Butts sound like radicals. How the mayor could mend fences -- and why he must.\n\nJanuary 24, 2000\n\nSword and Shield\n\nWhen does protection for the victim become a weapon against the defendant? Ask Oliver Jovanovic, whose overturned conviction tests the limits of the so-called Rape Shield.\n\nJanuary 3, 2000\n\nHappy Ending\n\nEven in the new Times Square, signs of the possibly imminent apocalypse are everywhere. But thanks to Rudy and Hollywood, we may not recognize it when it comes.\n\nNovember 29, 1999\n\nDeath Be Not Proud\n\nThe murder of Elisa Izquierdo spurred a barrage of stories, and improvements at the agency charged with protecting kids -- until the press grew weary of all that misery.\n\nMay 3, 1999\n\nMatt Shipp's Out\n\nWhat happens when a great piano player makes music and no one's there to record it? That's what Lower East Side free-jazz legend Matt Shipp intends to find out.\n\nApril 26, 1999\n\nLife in the Clouds\n\nIn a Chelsea storefront, the good life comes down to essentials: a hand-rolled cigar, a drop of Scotch, and a spot on the most comfortable couch in the whole world.\n\nApril 19, 1999\n\nDon Cry for Me\n\nWhat John Gotti didn't screw up, his crude son John Jr. did. No more the obedient scion, however, Junior cut a deal including hard time -- a brazen declaration of independence."
