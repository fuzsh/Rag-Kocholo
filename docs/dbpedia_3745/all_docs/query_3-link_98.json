You were merely viewing your own artwork and that of your husband. Shayna’s small body became your canvas, and your cigarettes, curling iron, hands and belts, your etching instruments.”There was virtually no part of that tiny body you did not invade and defile and no organ you did not damage. Why should you be emotionally moved? You were long accustomed and apparently addicted to the sight and sound of burning flesh.”\n\nElisa Izquierdo was a little girl who was immensely loved by her father Gus. When he passed away suddenly, his little girl Elisa was at the mercy of her mother Awilda Lopez. However, Awilda showed her daughter no mercy.
