        "text": "How T he System Failed Elisa Izquierdo\n\nOn November 22, 1995, the life of an innocent six year old child was wrongfully taken.\n\nElisa Izquierdo was a victim of abuse, not only from her mother , who was found guilty with\n\nsecond degree murder , but she was also a victim of the system. Throughout her short life, she had\n\na father who loved her very much and tried his best to raise her in the best way possible, such a s\n\ngiving her a good education and surrounding her with people who supported both of them.\n\nUnfortunately , Elisa’ s mother did not feel the same towards her .\n\nDuring her pregnancy , A wilda Lopez was a strong drug addict, resulting in Elisa being\n\naddicted to crack cocaine as soon as she was born. This worried her father , Gustavo Izquierdo, as\n\nit would worry any other parent who cared about their child. Due to A wilda’ s drug abuse,\n\nGustavo petitioned the court to gain full custody of Elisa, and the courts grante d his petition.\n\nNow , as a single father , Gustavo had much help from the community and friends in raising Elisa,\n\nand she became enrolled in a preschool. When Elisa was just a year old, A wilda claimed to now\n\nbe drug-free and had found permanent residence, and went to the courts to sign an af fidavit in\n\nhopes of gaining back custody of her daughter . She petitioned the court and was granted\n\nunsupervised visits with Elisa by 1991. This was just the first time that the system fai led her .\n\nDuring the week, Elisa would be with Gustavo, and would then spend the weekends with A wilda,\n\nher husband, and two siblings.\n\nA wilda would repeatedly beat Elisa during her weekend visits because she claimed Elisa was\n\npossessed by the devil. At such a young age, this would mentally and physically affect Eli sa in so\n\nmany ways. She began to become withdrawn, when she was once such a happy and sociable\n\nchild. Many around her , such as her father , teachers, and neighbors, began to notice the changes\n\nin her , as well as bruises when she would return from her mother ’ s unsupervised visits. Gustavo\n\nhad even noticed bruising in Elisa’ s private area, and the huge change in her demeanor . He\n\nimmediately came in contact with New Y ork’ s Child W elfare Administration and reported all of\n\nhis findings, as well as one of Elisa’ s teachers reporting her findings to the case worker , and Elisa\n\ntelling the social worker herself about the beatings she was enduring. This all resulted in the\n\nvisits coming to a stop for a period of time, where the system made the correct choice of not\n\nallowing A wilda to see Elisa any longer .\n\nWhen she was just five years old, her father unfortunately passed away due to respiratory is sues\n\nfrom lung cancer . A custody battle immediately broke out between Elsa and A wilda, both\n\nfighting to have full custody of Elisa. Once again, the system completel y failed her , and she was\n\nsent to live with A wilda and her husband, who had full custody of her . T he beatings started again,\n\nand this time were worse than before. Elisa was treated dif ferently than the other two siblings, as\n\nA wilda was still convinced that Elisa was the child of the devil. A wilda removed her from school\n\ncompletely , and kept her trapped in a room, where she was given very little portions of food and\n\nhad to use the bathroom on the bed because she was not allowed out to use the bathroom. The\n\nbeatings continued until A wilda tortured her till she was found deceased in that room.\n\nIn my personal opinion, every single person involved could have prevented the wrongful death\n\nof such an innocent child. Social workers, lawyers, judges, and many more people continued to\n\nallow A wilda to gain custody of Elisa, despite t he clear signs of the abuse she was enduring from\n\nsuch a young age. It took her death to prove how much the system failed in protecting this chil d,\n\nnot only after Gustavo’ s death, but from the time she was born, to having unsupervised visits\n\nwith her mother , to then living full-time with A wilda. T he system, unfortunately , failed Elisa\n\nIzquierdo from the time she was born, resulting in her death."
