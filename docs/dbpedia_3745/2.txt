Hi, to our lovely True Crimer's, thanks for listening and please help us spread the word by telling your friends and family about us.

this is going to be another horrific one, thanks to Kim.

trigger warning this is horrible as usual, and there is a little child involved, so if you can not stomach child abuse, please tune in next week for a more laid back episode.

Elisa Izquierdo (Feb 11, 1989 – Nov 22, 1995) was a precious, innocent six-year-old Puerto Rican–Cuban-American little girl who died of a brain hemorrhage inflicted by her dreadful mother, Awilda Lopez.

This all occurred at the height of a prolonged & increasing rampage of physical, mental, emotional, and sexual child abuse that took place between 1994 and 1995.

It was described by authorities in NYC as the "worst case of child abuse they had ever seen."

The life and death of Elisa Izquierdo first made national headlines when it became clear that the city's child welfare system, had missed many chances to intervene with her family and save her life.

These failures to protect Elisa, became the inspiration for Elisa's Law, and increased accountability of all parties involved in child welfare within the city

Elisa's Law was implemented in February 1996.

Elisa has been referred to as a modern-day Cinderella because she had at first been under the protection of a loving father and had befriended Prince Michael of Greece, who had offered to pay for her private tuition until 12th grade—before being placed into the permanent custody of her mother.

This terrible tale is unfortunately a true one.

Please take care and stay safe, Love Steph and Kim xx
