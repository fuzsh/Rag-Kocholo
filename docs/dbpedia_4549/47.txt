Formed in 1996 by Chris van der Kuyl and Peter Baillie, VIS entertainment plc was a game design and development company located in Scotland.

The company also provided interactive content for Interactive Digital Television ("iTV") and broadband. VIS entertainment plc consisted of VIS Games and associated companies Axis Animation and VIS iTV. The company had over 100 employees.

The company worked closely with BAM! Entertainment, acquiring (and later closing) BAM's London Studio.

On April 7, 2005, VIS filed for bankruptcy. Later in the month, all development work was cancelled and assets were sold to other developing companies.
