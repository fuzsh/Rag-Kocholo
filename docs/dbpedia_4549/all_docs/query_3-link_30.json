        "text": "Sony Interactive Entertainment (SIE), formerly known as Sony Computer Entertainment (SCE), is a Japanese-American multinational game publisher, console manufacturer and digital entertainment company. It is a subsidiary of Japanese business company Sony Group Corporation.\n\nThe company was founded in 1993 following a fallout between Sony and fellow console making company Nintendo which resulted in the former's formal entry into the gaming industry in 1994, with the release of the original PlayStation. Since then, the PlayStation brand has grown to include several successor consoles, handheld platforms and related accessories, as well as presence in mobile and personal computer markets. In 2016, the company was reorganized as Sony Interactive Entertainment following a merger with Sony Network Entertainment International, with headquarters based in San Mateo, California.\n\nSince its inception, SIE has founded and acquired several game development studios while relinquishing or closing others. Beginning with 2005, the majority of those studios operate under PlayStation Studios (formerly Worldwide Studios), which oversees the development of video game titles and cooperation between various teams within and outside the company. SIE also manages other subsidiaries and divisions including PlayStation Studios Creative Arts, PlayStation PC publisher unit, PlayStation Studios Mobile Division for mobile game development, PlayStation Productions for film and television adaptations, the Evolution Championship Series and multiplatform developer-publisher Bungie.\n\nSIE is the world's biggest video game publisher in terms of revenue as of 2021, and one of the major platform holders and console manufactures of the gaming industry since the launch of the original PlayStation console in 1994. Among its most prominent franchises are Astro Bot, God of War, Gran Turismo, Horizon, The Last of Us, Ratchet & Clank and Uncharted, as well as licensed properties such as MLB: The Show and Marvel Games franchises Spider-Man and Wolverine.\n\nHistory\n\nEstablishment\n\nSony Computer Entertainment was founded on November 16, 1993, by Sony and its subsidiary Sony Music Entertainment of Japan. The new division's creation was meant to help Sony's venture into the video game industry, following a publicized fallout with fellow game company and platform holder Nintendo. Ken Kutaragi, who was a prominent part of the Sony-Nintendo deal and previously designed the sound chip for Nintendo's Super NES, became the primary designer of the division's first major product, the PlayStation.\n\nPlayStation 1 era\n\nPlayStation 2 era\n\nPlayStation 3 era\n\nPlayStation 4 era\n\nPlayStation 5 era\n\nPersonnel\n\nCEOs and Presidents\n\nKen Kutaragi: 1993 - 2007\n\nKez Hirai: 2007 - 2012\n\nAndrew House: 2012 - 2017\n\nJohn Kodera: 2017 - 2019\n\nJim Ryan: 2019 - 2024\n\nHiroki Totoki: 2024 (interim)\n\nHermen Hulst and Hideaki Nishino: 2024 - current\n\nSCE America\n\nKaz Hirai: until 2006\n\nJack Tretton: 2006 - 2014\n\nShawn Layden: 2014 - 2018\n\nSCE Japan\n\nShawn Layden: 2007 - 2010\n\nSIE Worldwide Studios\n\nHeads of Worldwide Studios\n\nPresidents\n\nPhil Harrison: 2005 - 2008\n\nShuhei Yoshida: 2008 - 2019\n\nHermen Hulst: 2019 - current\n\nChairmen\n\nShawn Layden: 2018 - 2019\n\nDivisions and subsidiaries\n\nStudio Location Founded Acquired Notable products Additional notes Bend Studio Bend, Oregon, US 1993 2000 Syphon Filter, Resistance: Retribution, Uncharted: Golden Abyss, Days Gone Originally called Eidetic prior to acquisition Bluepoint Games Austin, Texas, US 2006 2001 Shadow of the Colossus remake, Demon's Souls remake Primarily focuses on remasters and remakes Firesprite Liverpool, UK 2012 2021 Horizon Call of the Mountain Founded by former Studio Liverpool veterans Guerrilla Games Amsterdam, Netherlands 2000 2005 Games: Killzone, Horizon\n\nTechnology: Decima engine Biggest European studio in PlayStation Studios Housemarque Helsinki, Finland 1995 2021 Super Stardust, Resogun, Returnal n / a Insomniac Games Burbank, California, US 1994 2019 Spyro the Dragon, Ratchet & Clank, Resistance, Marvel's Spider-Man Includes satellite studio Insomniac North Carolina London Studio London, UK 2002 n / a Games: SingStar, Blood & Truth\n\nTechnology: EyeToy, PlayStation VR Formed from the merger of Studio Liverpool's Camden studio and Team Soho Media Molecule Guildford, Surrey, UK 2006 2010 LittleBigPlanet, Tearaway, Dreams n / a Naughty Dog Santa Monica, California, US 1984 2001 Crash Bandicoot, Jak and Daxter, Uncharted, The Last of Us Oldest studio at PlayStation Studios PixelOpus San Mateo, California, US 2014 n / a Concrete Genie Formed within San Mateo Studio Polyphony Digital Tokyo, Japan 1998 n / a Gran Turismo, Tourist Trophy Informally organized in 1994 as Polys Entertainment; has additional satellite studios in Japan, the United States and the Netherlands San Diego Studio San Diego, US 2001 n / a MLB: The Show Formed from the merger of Red Zone Interactive and 989 Sports Santa Monica Studio Los Angeles, US 1998 n / a God of War, Kinetica engine Had an incubation team between 2000 and 2016 Sucker Punch Productions Bellevue, Washington, US 1997 2011 Sly Cooper, Infamous, Ghost of Tsushima n / a Team Asobi Tokyo, Japan 2021 n / a Astro Bot Founded as an internal team at Japan Studio in 2012 before spinning-off into an independent studio in 2021\n\nSupport teams\n\nICE Team - technology group within Naughty Dog\n\nMalaysia Studio\n\nNixxes Software\n\nSan Mateo Studio - founded in 1998, collaborator team\n\nValkyrie Entertainment\n\nXDev Europe - founded in 2000, collaborator team\n\nFormer studios\n\nFormer divisions\n\nSCE Liverpool Studio - founded in 1984, acquired in 1993, closed in 2012\n\nSIE Manchester Studio - founded in 2015, closed in 2020\n\nSony Online Entertainment - founded in 1995, sold off in 2015\n\nFormer subsidiaries\n\n989 Studios - founded in 1995, relaunched in 2001, closed in 2005\n\nBigbig Studios - founded in 2001, acquired in 2007, closed in 2012\n\nEvolution Studios - founded in 1999, acquired in 2007, closed in 2016\n\nIcognito Entertainment - founded in 1999, acquired in 2002, closed in 2009\n\nTeam Soho - founded in 1994, merged into SCE Liverpool Studio in 2002\n\nZipper Interactive - founded in 1995, acquired in 2006, closed in 2012\n\nFranchises owned by Sony\n\nApe Escape (1999-2011)\n\nAstro Bot (2018-current)\n\nDark Cloud (2001-2002)\n\nEverybody's Golf (1997-current)\n\nGod of War (2005-current)\n\nGran Turismo (1997-current)\n\nGravity Rush (2012-2017)\n\nHorizon (2017-current)\n\nInfamous (2009-2014)\n\nJak and Daxter (2001-2009)\n\nKillzone (2004-2013)\n\nKnack (2013-2017)\n\nThe Last of Us (2013-current)\n\nLittleBigPlanet (2008-current)\n\nMediEvil (1998-2019)\n\nMotorStorm (2006-2012)\n\nPaRappa the Rapper (1996-2001\\0\n\nRatchet & Clank (2002-current)\n\nResistance (2006-2012)\n\nSly Cooper (2002-2013)\n\nSOCOM (2002-2011)\n\nSyphon Filter (1999-2007)\n\nTwisted Metal (1995-2012)\n\nUncharted (2007-current)\n\nWarhawk (1995-2012)\n\nWhite Knight Chronicles (2010-2012)\n\nWipeout (1995-2017)\n\nFormerly\n\nReception\n\nMetacritic ranked Sony Interactive Entertainment as 2022's Publisher of the Year with a mean score of 85.6%.[1]"
