        "text": "Course Name Number Cr. Prerequisites Description Accounting and Financial Concepts for Lawyers 169 2\n\nThis course introduces you to accounting issues that arise in the normal practice of law. An understanding of some of the fundamentals of accounting and financial statements is useful in many respects. For example, a labor lawyer representing the Union who understands the company's accounting and financial statements can do a better job than one who is ignorant about finance. A business lawyer negotiating a deal sometimes can change a few technical words and save or gain the client triple digit thousands. Lawyers also need to understand accounting concepts and their embodiment in the various documents which represent the client's income, tax position, net worth, liabilities, liquidity, and general financial position. A lawyer with solid legal expertise whose conversation with the client can range over these topics is a huge asset both for the client and for the firm.\n\nAdministrative Law 116 3\n\nAn inquiry into the powers and processes of federal administrative agencies, and the control of agency action through judicial review and other means.\n\nAdministrative Law Clinic 364 2 Administrative Law\n\nThe Administrative Law Clinic will involve students in all aspects of the administrative process, including monitoring agency activity, participating in ongoing matters, analyzing relevant legislative proposals, and writing briefs on important administrative-law issues.

At times we will look at specific legal doctrines, including stare decisis, standing, qualified immunity, nationwide injunctions, political questions, and severability. At other times, we’ll look at more general legal topics like departmentalism, court packing, and the Supreme Court’s emergency docket. The common theme will be the limits of federal courts: What should federal judges have the power to do, what should they not be allowed to do, and why? The course assumes no previous knowledge of the topics, and the standard Federal Courts course is not a prerequisite.\n\nAdvanced Legal Research 118 2\n\nThis class aims to develop students’ knowledge of research resources and hone research methods in topics both familiar and previously unknown. We will take an in-depth look at areas introduced in LRWA I and II, and explore topical subjects such as foreign & international law, intellectual property, administrative law, and historical sources.

We will consider the way changes in American social and political life helped drive legal change, and also how changes in legal doctrine and legal thought helped shape American history. The seminar will rely on primary sources and secondary materials that help highlight different historical interpretations and schools of thought. Students will write a seminar paper, and the course will rely on extensive class discussion.\n\nAmerican Legal History Survey 379 1-3\n\nThis is a profession-specific civics course for aspiring lawyers. It is about the evolution of American law and legal institutions from colonial times to the end of the 19th century. By the end of the course you should have anecdotal knowledge of, and a comprehensive appreciation for, the development of courts and their relations with legislatures, executives, interest groups, and the general public; of legislation, regulation, and doctrine; of legal education; and of the organized bar — up to about the year 1900.This course is not an introduction to modern American law or government; rather, students are expected to have an understanding of those subjects sufficiently deep and current to enable them to understand analogical and passing references to modern topics.\n\nAnimal Law 177 2 An exploration and discussion of the treatment of captive and wild animals under state, federal, and international law.

The first part of the course will explore different schools of constitutional thought (e.g., living constitutionalism and originalism), asking how each of them justifies judicial review and how those justifications inform their approaches to constitutional interpretation. The second part of the course will explore the actual practice of judicial review by different courts around the world, asking which, if any, of the normative theories can justify judicial review as practiced. (One of the most important and yet largely unknown developments in global government over the last thirty or eighty years, depending on how one counts, is the global spread of judicial review.) The goal is to see whether any of the normative theories has descriptive uptake and, if not, to ask anew whether judicial review can be justified, not in the abstract, but as practiced.\n\nConsumer Financial Protection 193 2\n\nThis class will examine the law, economics, history, and policy of consumer financial protection. The course will study evolving cultural and economic understanding of consumer finance and financial protection and the influence of technological evolution on consumer financial protection policy. Particular topics of analysis will cover the legal and economic aspects of state regulation (such as usury laws and debt collection), developments of interstate markets in consumer finance and financial protection regulation in the post-World War II era, the 2008 financial crisis and the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and the emergence of fintech as a disruptive economic and regulatory technology.\n\nConsumer Protection Law 332 3\n\nThis course (formerly Unfair Trade Practices) examines several areas of consumer protection law, including entry into the market, unfair and deceptive practices, interference with business relations, trade secrets, and misappropriation.

This course will examine how the law can most effectively combat global corruption and human rights violations, with a focus on violations in business conducted around the world and product supply chains. We will also consider the relationship between corruption and the global rule of law, explore the impact of multinational corporate behavior on corruption and human rights, and examine the current and emerging individual and corporate legal initiatives aimed at ending these practices. The causes, incidence, and impact of violations will be addressed, as well as the effectiveness of expanding tools to address violations, including the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, disclosure and certification regimes, private rights of action, and other individual and corporate compliance requirements.\n\nCounterterrorism Law Seminar 654 2\n\nThis seminar course will provide students with exposure to the laws and policies relating to U.S. government counterterrorism efforts and will survey the wide range of legal issues implicated by such efforts at home and overseas. Issues to be addressed will include international and domestic law applicable to counterterrorism activities, the authorities for the use of force, offensive operations overseas, domestic counterterrorism efforts, surveillance of terrorists, capture, detention, and interrogation of terrorism suspects, prosecutions in military commissions and domestic courts, immigration matters, and other legal authorities for addressing terrorism issues.\n\nCovert Action, Clandestine, and Special Operations Law 148 2\n\nThis course will introduce students to the domestic and international authorities, laws, and policies applicable to the use of covert action authorities abroad and the use of clandestine and military special operations forces. The course will cover the core separation of powers related issues regarding oversight of such activities by Congress, including specifically in the areas of counterterrorism operations and cyber activities. The course will review both the historical legal constraints and policies applicable to such activities as well as ongoing debates over the appropriate nature and scope of such activities and the relevant reporting and disclosure of such activities. The course will teach the law in this area in part by examining declassified examples of such activities and focusing on the laws applied in such cases, the oversight conducted both before and after the activities, as well as the potential applicability of other laws and policies.\n\nCriminal Law 106 3 General principles of the substantive criminal law and its major processes are derived from study of its common law origins and the effects of such variables as societal values, legislation, and judicial activity.

The course will also explore the legislative and technology landscape in this dynamic area and will provide students with opportunities to discuss cutting-edge issues at the intersection of law, technology, and policy.\n\nDeath Penalty in America: Law, History, and Policy 138 2\n\nThe use of the death penalty as the ultimate punishment upon a conviction for a capital crime continues to spark heated debate in our courts, within legislatures and among the public. This course will analyze the law and history of the death penalty in the context of the Eighth Amendment’s prohibition against cruel and unusual punishments, in addition to the due process rights and jury trial rights afforded to all citizens. After the Supreme Court’s decision in Gregg v. Georgia (1976), Congress and state legislatures created death penalty laws and procedures seeking to limit the class of murders eligible for the death penalty to the “worst of the worst.” The Supreme Court has also revised the death penalty in several cases since Gregg with the effect of limiting the application of the death penalty: e.g., for juveniles; for those with low mental capacities; and by limiting how the death penalty may be imposed (juries only) and the manner in which the death penalty can be carried out. But the Supreme Court has not (yet) revisited the notion of abolishing the death penalty as unconstitutional under the Eighth Amendment. Is the answer that the imposition of the death penalty in the appropriate case is lawful, constitutional and just? Or, will the Supreme Court abolish the death penalty? If so, why?\n\nDeath Penalty in Virginia 707 1\n\nVirginia’s recent enactment of a law abolishing the death penalty—the first Southern state to do so—is a remarkable development. Over the course of American history, no state has executed more people than Virginia. And between 1976 and 2020 only one state (Texas) has more frequently resorted to capital punishment. Is Virginia’s decision to abolish the death penalty simply evidence of a politically and culturally changing Commonwealth or does it portend abolitionist developments throughout the country and the world? This course will be graded CR/NC.\n\nDerivatives Law & Policy 730 1-2 credits\n\nModern capital and financial markets rely on a wide variety of complex instruments, including Treasury securities, structured debt and equity instruments, and derivatives of various kinds. Public awareness regarding these instruments has grown since the Financial Crisis of 2008 because they are thought to have played an important role in both the rapid growth of financial markets (“financialization”) and their destabilization. These instruments and the role they play in modern markets are often not well understood. Yet a basic understanding of these instruments has now become important in modern financial law practice and any discussions on financial policy and regulation.\n\nThis course will review the workings of derivative instruments in the capital markets and how such instruments themselves are used. The relationship between banking and capital markets, and between government and the private markets, will be explored, as will the most important legal and fiduciary responsibilities involved. While not highly technical, the various principal types of derivatives will be examined. We will therefore also consider the numerous public policy issues relating to derivatives, their role in the Crisis of 2008, the history of attempts to regulate these instruments, and the current regulatory structure.\n\nDisability Law Seminar 639 2 This course surveys American law as it relates to people with disabilities.

Students will not become expert in these technical areas but will be exposed to both the mechanics and subtleties of these tools. The goal is to educate and train students so that they will be better prepared to understand a dispute, craft an argument, or prepare a witness.\n\neDiscovery 204 3\n\nIncreasingly, attorneys are becoming “general contractors” when it comes to certain highly technical areas of the law. This is certainly true of the practice of eDiscovery. Unless you have chosen to make eDiscovery the focus of your practice, you will most likely instead be charged with assembling – and then managing – the right team of attorney specialists, technologists, and allied professionals who will conduct the eDiscovery components of cases on your behalf and under your direction. Any attorney serving in such a capacity will need to know enough about the law and technical aspects of eDiscovery to assemble the right team, keep costs under control, and ensure that legal and ethical obligations to clients, the court, and opponents are met and discharged. This course endeavors to impart such “general contractor” knowledge and expertise.\n\nEducation Law 165 2\n\nIn Fall 2023, this course will cover select topics in Education Law in a half-semester format.

Students will survey the historical, policy and technological bases of privacy and information governance. Particular attention will be paid to notions of \"relationship dependent context\" as it relates to the collection, use and disclosure of information. Leading legal academic scholarship in the field of information privacy will be discussed and students will apply knowledge of the law of privacy and technology to current legal and policy problems. Each student will apply their acquired knowledge both in class as well as through the preparation of a scholarly student paper. Issues such as Do-Not-Track and Online Advertising, Security Breaches, Workplace Monitoring, Comparative International Approaches, Ownership of Facts and Information, Health and Financial Privacy and more will be covered.\n\nEmployment Law 365 2\n\nSurveys the law governing the employment relationship in the absence of a collective bargaining agreement.

We will conclude with a brief survey of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act.\n\nEnergy Law 746 2\n\nThis course will cover the basic law and policy surrounding the extraction and use of energy resources in the United States. Energy production is central to our economy, and we use energy in practically every activity we engage in, often without even knowing it or thinking about it. As you will see, managing the U.S. energy system is an incredibly complex physical, commercial, and legal challenge. Thus, the overarching goal in this two-credit survey course is to provide foundational knowledge about these aspects of managing the energy system.\n\nWe will focus on building an understanding of the basic physical constraints under which energy systems operate, the fundamental legal principles and statutory regimes at play in U.S. energy law and policy, and the enduring themes that have emerged in over a century of modern energy law and policy development. We will also explore the ways that energy law and policy is changing in response to market forces, technological development, and policy innovation.\n\nEntertainment Law 209 3\n\nThis course will focus on legal issues of particular salience to the “entertainment industry,” defined for this purpose as those individuals and firms concerned with the commercial creation and distribution of fixed expressive content marketed for its entertainment value. The course will survey several areas of legal doctrine that are common to the entire industry: domestic and international copyright law, trademark and right of publicity, industry organization, expressive torts and their First Amendment limitations, and contracts pertaining to credit and control. Grades will be based on a final paper which will be targeted for submission to one of several recognized IP & entertainment law writing competitions, and in-class discussion of casebook problems.\n\nEnvironmental Law 218 3\n\nA complex set of laws and regulations, developed over the past five decades, manages various environmental risks, ranging from risks to water, air, and land, among others. This course is designed to provide a general introduction to the theory and practice of environmental law, with an emphasis on the major pollution control statutes. Some of the recurring themes of the course will be the balance between federal and state authority, the economic justifications for environmental regulation, the distributional effects of environmental policy, the choice of regulatory instruments, and the role of agencies, legislatures, and courts. We will also discuss the political backdrop for the development of environmental policy, especially the role of interest groups and public perceptions.\n\nERISA Law 352 2\n\nThis course introduces students to the laws governing employee benefits, principally the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, or ERISA.

The course will also examine the various ethical challenges associated with highly classified or sensitive operations, including those that may involve the use of techniques and capabilities that may approach the boundaries of the law, as well as those that require limited disclosure even within the confines of the executive branch.\n\nEuropean Union Competition Law 259 2 Antitrust I: Principles\n\nEuropean Union Competition Law impacts significantly on the ways in which companies, both large multinational corporations, and small and medium-sized enterprises, conduct themselves in the competitive environment. The primary focus of this course will be on the control of multi-lateral and unilateral anti-competitive conduct. The course will focus on the operation of the EU Competition Law regime, based on articles 101 and 102 of the TFEU, and procedural and implementing legislation. The course will also consider the main provisions of American Antitrust Law, as enshrined in Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act 1890, and Section 5 of the FTC Act. In both cases the outline of the institutional processes, and the relationship between public and private enforcement will be considered.

The final segment, after spring break, covers data privacy law and migration issues, the basics of the EU internal market and competition (antitrust) framework, and the EU’s increasingly prominent and ambitious role as an international actor in its own right. The course offers a compressed survey of the constitutional, administrative, human rights, justice and home affairs, economic and foreign relations law of the European Union. The emphasis throughout is on institutional aspects and on the relationship between the EU and its member states, with comparisons to U.S. law as appropriate. In addition to the assigned reading in preparation for each week’s meeting, the instructors will provide brief topical primary and other documents during each class period for reading and discussion. The course will also give attention to EU law research methods and sources, and students will write a 20- to 25-page research paper.\n\nEvidence 222 3-4 Civil Procedure\n\nExamines legal rules governing the proof of disputed issues of fact during adversary proceedings.

Should new lawyers be trained primarily by practicing lawyers? As undergraduates? Or should there be law schools as part of a separate three-year training after college? Should students learn primarily how to practice law or how to “think like a lawyer?” From the 17th to the 21st century, American lawyers have been trained in an astonishing variety of ways. This course will study how lawyers became lawyers over the centuries and up until the present. The training of lawyers is particularly important given the central role of law and lawyers in American social, political, and economic life. Particular attention will be paid to the creation of the American law school in the 19th century, to the codification movement of the 19th century, to comparative ways of training lawyers around the world, and to modern controversies over law school admissions, how students pay for law school, and entrance requirements to join the profession.\n\nHomeland Security Law 388 3\n\nThis course provides an introduction to the policy, strategy and practical application of homeland security through an understanding of the authorizing laws, regulations, and polices that established DHS.

The main point is to develop a strong understanding of the establishment and evolution of the IC’s legal authorities, how the IC agencies interact with one another and the other branches of government, the respective oversight roles and responsibilities of the executive, legislative, and judicial branches of the federal government, and the role of the private sector in the IC. The course will conclude with a written exam.\n\nIntelligence Law Seminar 492 2\n\nThis seminar will provide students with an overview of the U.S. Intelligence Community (IC) and its sources of legal authority.
