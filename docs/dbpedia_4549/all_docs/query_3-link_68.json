The studio is currently working on State of Decay 3 for Xbox Series X, which will be its first release since becoming a first-party Xbox studio in 2018. The game is thought to still be early in development, so we'll likely be waiting a little while before we see any more of it in action.\n\nWorld's Edge\n\nNotable releases: Age of Empires 4 (PC, 2021)\n\nWorking on: TBC\n\nFounded in: 2019\n\nWhile World's Edge isn't directly responsible for making new games, it has been positioned as a caretaker for one of Microsoft's biggest franchises.
