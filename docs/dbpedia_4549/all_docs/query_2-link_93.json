        "text": "Background\n\nVirgin Games was a British game developer and publisher formed in 1981 as Virgin Games, as part of Richard Branson's brand empire Virgin. The company focused on video games for computers and also held their own development teams.\n\nIn 1987, the company purchased Mastertronic and renamed themselves as Virgin Mastertronic. After this division was sold off to Sega in 1991 after the intense success of the Sega Master System in the country (which they distributed), the publishing side was renamed back to Virgin Games, which in 1993 was renamed as Virgin Interactive Entertainment to expand on just video games in general. The company's US division purchased developer Westwood Studios in 1992, and formed another development team Burst Studios in 1995. By this point, ownership had transitioned from the Virgin Group over to Spelling Entertainment Inc. That same year, its London-based division formed a development team that would be later named Crimson Studios.\n\nIn 1997, Spelling announced they would divest their ownership in Virgin Interactive. With this, the assets were split up and sold off. The North American division was sold to Electronic Arts as part of their purchase of Westwood, while the European division was purchased by its management. Interplay Entertainment and Titus Interactive soon purchased stakes in the business in 1999, with Titus acquiring 100% ownership in 2001.\n\nAt the end of 2002, Virgin downgraded to becoming a distributor only and was soon renamed as Avalon Interactive in August 2003. In January 2005, Titus filed for bankruptcy which led to Avalon Interactive eventually ceasing operations at the end of the year. The Spanish branch of Virgin Interactive was spun-off in October 2002 under the name Virgin PLAY.\n\n1st Logo (1983-1990)\n\nVisuals: There is a red triangle with the Virgin logo inside, while below, a yellow parallelogram with a Pac-Man like shape that forms the big \"G\". Next to it, there is the text \"ames\" and below, there is a line with a black circle inside.\n\nVariants:\n\nSometimes, the logo is shown in-credit.\n\nSometimes, only the Virgin triangle and the circle is used.\n\nTechnique: A still, sprite-based graphic.\n\nAudio: None.\n\nAvailability: Seen on Angler and Ghost Town for ZX Spectrum, World Trophy Soccer for Amstrad CPC, MSX, and ZX Spectrum and How to Be a Complete Bastard for Amstrad CPC.\n\n2nd Logo (1983-1996)\n\nVisuals: This is just the corporate Virgin logo on a black background.\n\nVariants:\n\nAn earlier version exists where the logo is shown on the game's title screen.\n\nSometimes, \"GAMES\" is shown on the bottom right of the logo.\n\nOn Super Slap Shot for the Super NES, the logo is inside a gray circle with a white background. The word \"PRESENTS\" appears below in rainbow colors.\n\nOn the Nintendo 64 prototype of Freak Boy, the logo is wobbling over a rainbow background.\n\nOn the Amiga version of Cool Spot, Spot can be seen walking below the logo.\n\nOn the intro of M.C. Kids for NES, the logo is shown over a plane.\n\nTechnique: None unless one counts the variants.\n\nAudio: None.\n\nAvailability: First seen on Bitmania for Commodore 64, and later seen on Microbe for BBC Micro, Them: A Paranoid Fantasy for Oric, Gates of Dawn for Commodore 64, Dan Dare: Pilot of the Future for Amstrad CPC, Erebu for Commodore 64, Action Force for Amstrad CPC, Rebel for Commodore 64, Trans-Atlantic Balloon Challenge for ZX Spectrum, Jimmy White's 'Whirlwind' Snooker, Super Slap Shot, the Nintendo 64 prototype of Freak Boy, Krusty's Fun House for PC, Alien 3, Cool Spot for Amiga, and Lost Vikings for Sega Genesis/Mega Drive.\n\n3rd Logo (1990-1999)\n\nLater variant of the logo as used on various games.
