With origins spanning the globe - from Brazil to Poland to small town USA, we are home to over 250 world class developers who strive to push the medium forward with every creative decision. Every team has a story and, at the heart of our story, we are committed to greatness and steadfast in our craft of developing unforgettable in-game experiences that inspire our players. Beyond that, though, we are driven by something much larger…by a desire to develop “stories” of greatness for each and every team member. Making a game is a massive undertaking. Between QA, Art, Design, Programming, Production, Sound and every department in between, we are all responsible for connecting with each other's greatest skills, while working towards a common vision. Together, we sow seeds of possibility. Whether you are an intern or an industry veteran, creativity rules here. At our studio we recognize that great ideas can come from anyone. Traversing a new mythological world on a boat. A single camera shot for an entire game. A powerful recalling axe. A companion AI known as “boy” fighting like a god. These are just some of the bold ideas that were not simply lit by an individual light bulb...they were forged from idea, to paper, to code in a collaborative effort by creatives of all disciplines on a journey to reinvent a franchise.\n\nWebsite\n\nhttp://sms.playstation.com\n\nExternal link for Santa Monica Studio\n\nIndustry\n\nEntertainment Providers\n\nCompany size\n\n201-500 employees\n\nHeadquarters\n\nLos Angeles, California\n\nType\n\nPublic Company\n\nSpecialties\n\nvideo games, entertainment, creativity, programming, art, technology, playstation, design, production, collaboration, animation, and audio"
