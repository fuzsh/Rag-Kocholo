        "text": "Developer and publisher BAM! Entertainment announced today that it will acquire VIS Entertainment, the Scottish developer best known for the State of Emergency series. The agreement also includes purchase of SOE Development Limited, a company established to fund development of State of Emergency 2.\n\nThe newly combined company will be led by executives from both BAM! and VIS. As you might expect, the first joint project of the new company will be State of Emergency 2, the follow-up to 2002's riot-ridden action title. It appears at this time that existing publisher agreements will continue after the acquisition.\n\n\"This is an exciting combination of two dynamic businesses whose activities and experience span the globe,\" said Raymond C. Musci, Chief Executive Officer of BAM! \"We believe this deal will position our combined businesses strongly in a highly-competitive market, and achieve significant synergies in our operations. We are bringing together some of the most talented and knowledgeable people in our industry. There is little or no overlap between the businesses and we intend that the new combined company will operate in an efficient and rigorous manner, involving both development and publishing of games.\"\n\nVIS Chairman Ken Lewandowski commented, \"Our agreement with BAM!, which represents a significant development for VIS, would enable our company to participate in a new enterprise with the scope to both develop and publish its own properties.\"\n\nWe'll have more news on the newly combined company, as well as State of Emergency 2, as it comes in."
