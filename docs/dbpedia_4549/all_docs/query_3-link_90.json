        "text": "Posted on\n\nThe GameStop Business Model focuses on selling games and entertainment products in multiple eCommerce stores across the United States of America and other countries such as Australia and Canada. The company’s history started in 1984 in Dallas, Texas, USA. Today, it has grown to become a global brand.\n\nThe company’s goal reflects its marketing strategy: sell video games and accessories. These accessories include collectibles, video consoles, electronic products, etc. Asides from selling in e-commerce stores, GameStop has a brick-and-mortar location customers can easily walk into to pick up products of their choice.\n\nContents\n\nToggle\n\nA brief history of GameStop\n\nRegarded as the largest merchandise retailer of video games across the world, GameStop evolved from a company founded in 1984 in Dallas, Texas, with Leonard Riggio, Daniel DeMatteo, and Richard Fontaine as the current owners. The company started as Babbage’s, a software merchandise retailer founded in 1984 by James McCurry and Gary M. Kusin. Babbage’s, named after Charles Babbage, started selling video games and went public in 1988 through an initial public offering.\n\nHowever, in 1994, Software Etc. merged with Babbage’s to become NeoStar Retail Group. James McCurry became NeoStar’s chairman, while Gary Kusin resigned in 1995 to establish a cosmetics company. However, sales began to decline, and NeoStar couldn’t meet its financial responsibilities. In 1996, Leonard Riggio, a major stockholder at Barnes & Noble, purchased NeoStar for $58.5 million.\n\nRiggio renamed the company Babbage’s Etc. and made Richard Fontaine chief executive, while Daniel DeMatteo, the former president of NeoStar and Software Etc. became the president of Babbage’s Etc. In 1999, Babbage’s Etc launched gamestop.com, a website for selling video games. In the same year, the company was acquired by Barnes & Noble for $215 million. In 2000, Barnes & Noble bought Funco, a video game retailer, for $160 million. Finally, Funco was renamed GameStop in December 2000 and went public again in February 2002. Today, the company has over 5000 stores in different countries.\n\nWho Owns GameStop\n\nPresently, 25.74% of the company belongs to institutional shareholders, 10.63% belongs to insiders, and 63.63 % belongs to retail investors. However, Ryan Cohen is the largest individual shareholder of GameStop, with about 13% of the company.

Today, it has become the largest retailer of consumer electronics;\n\nNintendo: Regarded as the oldest video-game company in the world, Nintendo was founded in 1889 by Fusajiro Yamauchi in Kyoto, Japan, as a company producing hand-drawn Hanafuda cards.

It is easy for consumers to navigate the platform and find what they want, whether gamers, freaks, or collectors;\n\nTrade-in program: Another strength of the company lies in its trade-in program, where customers can exchange their video game and game accessories for cash or trade credits.

For example, consumers could easily go to competitors who offer less prices;\n\nNo local promotion services: GameStop’s local marketing services are weak to compete with other video game providers. Also, it focuses more on online marketing than local physical promotion;\n\nLimited parking in physical stores: The parking spaces available in its physical stores are few, discouraging many people from patronizing the brand;\n\nSupplier-contracted: GameStop mainly relies on others to supply its products and services, which it retails. It doesn’t produce anything, and this can affect the company if the suppliers’ contract fails.\n\nGameStop Opportunities\n\nBelow, there are GameStop’s opportunities\n\nFew competitors: Not many players have GameStop’s product mix. As such, there are only a few competitors in GameStop’s league. This is leverage for the company to dominate the market;\n\nGrowing location: Some of GameStop’s physical stores are in growing locations, thereby increasing the commercial quality of such places and opening up a bigger market to GameStop;\n\nEstablished online marketplace: One of GameStop’s greatest assets is its online marketplace, which retails video games and accessories worldwide. GameStop can expand its product range to make more money online;\n\nProgressive technology: GameStop is powered on high technology, which helps make its operations smoother. It can take advantage of this opportunity to acquire other video game companies and partner with smartphone manufacturers.\n\nGameStop Threats\n\nHere, there are GameStop’s threats\n\nMore competitors entering the market: Unfortunately, more video game retail competitors are entering the market, making it difficult for consumers to decide whether to stick to their old brands or try new options;\n\nFixed pricing: GameStop’s fixed pricing threatens its survival as its consumers will leave them for cheaper options in the market;\n\nGlobal economic problem: The global economy is experiencing a downturn as major companies are crashing. For example, the pandemic dealt most companies a heavy blow, and not all recovered. The worse the economic problems, the more difficult it might be for companies like GameStop to meet their margins;\n\nIndustry threat: GameStop faces threats from people who illegally use other businesses’ assets to build theirs, such as software.\n\nConclusion\n\nDespite the heavy blow the pandemic dealt GameStop, the company’s resilience hasn’t reduced, as it is still regarded as the largest merchandise retailer of video games in the world. However, the company needs to expand its product range, adjust its pricing system in light of the economic problems in the world and innovate to ensure it stays on top of its game.\n\nWho is Daniel Pereira ?\n\nI love understanding strategy and innovation using the business model canvas tool so much that I decided to share my analysis by creating a website focused on this topic.\n\nMore About Me"
