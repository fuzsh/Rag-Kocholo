        "text": "I’ve got some good news and some bad news for you.\n\nLet’s start with the good one first: YouTube users watch 1 billion (!) hours of content daily. Meaning: there’s a vast audience pool you can tap into.\n\nThe bad news? 500 hours of new content is uploaded on YouTube every hour. Read: you’ve got a lot of competition.\n\nSo, what's the one thing can you do to beat the competition and gain your audience’s attention?\n\nShake up the types of YouTube videos you create. This way, your viewers can get a variety of content from your channel.\n\nIn this post, we’ve put together a list of the 24 most popular types of YouTube videos you should be creating. We've also included examples and templates to get you inspired.\n\nLet’s get on with it.\n\n1 Video Tutorials\n\nAlso known as how-to videos, tutorial videos are effective formats to educate people — ones that viewers love to consume too.\n\nYou can create how-to videos that solve questions or problems your audience has. Tasty’s how-to videos, such as the one below, are good examples of this type of video content:\n\nOr, you can create bite-sized product tutorials that explain how your tool works.\n\nFor instance, Notion has tons of tutorials that dig into one feature in one video and another one in another short video to help people use their product.\n\n2 Ask Me Anything (AMA) Videos\n\nAMA videos are a fun way to engage your community. They also bring a fresh voice with unique perspectives to the table.\n\nCase in point: Todoist, a to-do list-making tool, invited a productivity expert for an AMA session.\n\n3 Whiteboard Videos\n\nThese are pretty popular for their simplicity.\n\nAll you have to do is record yourself explaining a concept or your tool — even a product feature.\n\nOf course, for whiteboard videos to be a success, it’s essential you give a confident vibe. So, if you’re new to this video type, you’ll want to record a couple of times before you get the vibe right.\n\nRand Fishkin’s whiteboard videos are a good inspiration here:\n\n4 Listicle Videos\n\nMuch like listicle blog posts, list videos like \"X best\" or \"X top\" are another popular YouTube video type you can try out for your brand.\n\nSimply put together a strong video script and start recording.\n\nBut you don’t need to record yourself — in case you need a break from all the shooting. Instead, you can use a DIY video maker like Visme to create a top list video like this one:\n\nCustomize this template and make it your own!Edit and Download\n\n5 Product Reviews\n\nPairing with influencers for learning their take on your product? Ask them to create a product review for your YouTube channel.\n\nVideos like this bring social proof into the picture — subtly convincing viewers to buy from you since others like them (or influencers they trust) have good things to say about your product.\n\nHere’s an example of a product review video:\n\n6 Educational Videos\n\nThese types of YouTube videos help you gain your audience’s trust by providing them free value.\n\nIn fact, when it comes to learning about a service or product, 69% of folks prefer watching videos over text.\n\nThe takeaway? Educational videos, whether product- or topic-related, are an effective way to win your audience.\n\nThe best part? Using Visme, you can easily knock together educational videos in less than an hour. To speed things up, you can pick from video templates, customize them and you’re done.\n\nCustomize this template and make it your own!Edit and Download\n\n7 Challenge Videos\n\nThese videos show your business’s human side — whether you’re an independent contractor or a medium to larger business taking on a challenge.\n\nDifferent types of YouTubers make the most of challenge videos to get their channel in front of a wider audience.\n\nHere’s Microsoft’s research team taking on the ice bucket challenge, for instance:\n\n8 Unboxing Videos\n\nWondering what type of videos are most watched on YouTube?YouTube points out unboxing videos attract a lot of watch time. Meaning: you need to start creating these types of YouTube videos if you already haven’t.\n\nTake this as an example unboxing video for your inspiration:\n\n9 Behind the Scenes (BTS) Videos\n\nLike challenge videos, BTS videos are other YouTube video ideas that show your brand’s human side.\n\nIn fact, these videos not only show your company culture but also help with hiring and onboarding new employees by giving them an inside look at how things work at your end.\n\nYour BTS videos don’t have to be limited to team behind-the-scenes content. Instead, you can dive into product or project BTS content — giving viewers a peep into the work that goes behind your products.\n\nInterestingly, there’s a whole YouTube channel dedicated to going into the movie industry’s BTS. Watch a couple of these videos to get to grips with how you can create a BTS video:\n\n10 Explainer Videos\n\nThis is a popular pick among the different categories of YouTube videos.\n\n96% of potential buyers have watched explainer videos to learn about a product or service. This number alone is enough to say that you need explainer videos in your video content gallery.\n\nAgain, the good news is that you can put together explainer videos easily using templates. Or, create one from scratch using Visme.\n\nCustomize this template and make it your own!Edit and Download\n\n11 Product Demo Videos\n\nConsidering people love watching product videos to learn about products, demo videos are another type of YouTube video you need to be creating.\n\nFor demo videos to wow viewers and win them over with a solid first impression, it’s essential you add character to your videos.\n\nOne effective way to do this is by leveraging storytelling. How? Use this framework: the PAS or Problem-Agitate-Solution formula. Here’s how it works:\n\nIntroduce a problem your target audience has\n\nThen rub or agitate that problem\n\nFinally, offer a solution in the form of your product/tool\n\nHere's an example of a product demo video from Airtable:\n\n12 Video Testimonials\n\nIf you're looking for popular content on YouTube, this is a perfect pick.\n\nSame as product reviews, video case studies or testimonial videos bring social proof to the table.\n\nYour viewer sees the results others like them are driving and think they can achieve the same results.\n\nCase in point: Slack has an entire category of partner and customer testimonial videos on their YouTube channel.\n\nHere’s just one example:\n\n13 Reaction Videos\n\nThese videos are fodder for entertaining content.\n\nIf you’re a business that plans to leverage these types of YouTube videos, you can drive another benefit from them: showing your human side. And to reiterate, this helps you gain your audience’s trust.\n\n14 Webinar Teasers\n\nWhile you can certainly post teasers to get more people to watch your gated webinars, you can also post or host webinars on YouTube.\n\nThis way, you can build an educational webinar content library on your channel over time as Clearscope is doing:\n\n15 Community-Based Videos\n\nThese videos are much like educational videos but with a twist. How? You don’t do the teaching. Instead, your users or community members do it for you.\n\nBy creating these videos, you pair the educational approach with social proof, therefore, doubling the odds of engaging viewers.\n\nMiro does this best — recording videos under their “Tips and Tutorials from Miro Users” category:\n\nYou can also invite experts to your webinar videos and then post them on your YouTube channel. BuzzSumo collaborated with industry-influencer and content marketing expert, Ross Simmonds, for the same:\n\nRemember: you can structure these types of YouTube videos any way you like.\n\nThree ideas to try are:\n\nInterview experts or community members\n\nAsk your guest(s) to present on the topic\n\nHost a live Q&A where you source questions from the community\n\n16 Business Results Videos\n\nThis kind of video is great for wrapping your quarter or year — showcasing your results to impress your audience, investors and potential employees.\n\nAt Visme, for instance, we created a Year in Review video to walk our viewers through our achievements in 2020:\n\nKeep in mind: this 2020-results-video we created was in addition to our usual educational video content and tutorial videos.\n\nWe also share webinars on our channel and create fresh product promotion videos as needed:\n\nThis way, we practice what we preach—creating different types of YouTube content to engage viewers.\n\nThis way, we practice what we preach — creating different types of YouTube videos to engage viewers.\n\nMake video production easier than ever with Visme.\n\nChoose from our fully customizable templates\n\nCustomize fonts and colors to match your brand\n\nAccess animated design elements that tell your story\n\nSign up. It's free.\n\n17 Meet the Team Videos\n\nThese are a type of BTS video. Their objective? To spotlight employees for gaining the audience's trust and onboarding new employees.\n\nHere’s an example:\n\n18 Employee Spotlight Videos\n\nAgain, these types of YouTube videos showcase company culture.\n\nYou can always create one Meet The Team video as Wild Frontiers did in the example above.\n\nOr, take Sprout Social’s approach and highlight each employee’s contribution as part of your internal comms videos:\n\n19 Company Values Videos\n\nAgain, these videos are perfect for telling your audience more about you — giving people reasons to buy from you.\n\nIn fact, 83% of millennials want companies to align with their values. It’s only then that they plan to buy from companies. And, it’s how you can grow brand advocates and loyal customers.\n\nPlus, if you’re looking to collaborate with influencers or find investment partners, a company values video can help you make a compelling introduction.\n\n20 Q&A Videos\n\nQ&A videos are crucial for engaging your audience and showcasing your authority.\n\nFor businesses, these types of YouTube content are perfect for establishing yourself as a thought leader.\n\nHere’s an example:\n\nFor sourcing questions for these videos, you can always collect questions live — people share their struggles and you answer them on the spot. Or, you can gather questions beforehand using social media and email. You can also blend both options together.\n\n21 Company Culture Videos\n\nThese videos are essential for hiring the right talent for your company. There are two creative angles to creating company culture videos.\n\nOne, create a graphics-based video that features reasons that make your company culture outstanding as this example video featuring DocuSign’s culture does:\n\nTwo, show your team members at work — capturing the work culture in the process. Zendesk does this well:\n\nWant to create such a video? Record clips of your team at work and pair them with visually engaging graphics while adding interesting transitions using Visme.\n\n22 Video Blogs (Vlogs)\n\nVlogs are video-based blog posts talking about anything from productivity to making passive income.\n\nYou’ll need to feature yourself for vlogs, though, and edit them by adding text, images and other visual elements — find these easily in your Visme dashboard. In fact, you can add animated characters to your vlog content using our tool.\n\nWondering how to start vlogging? Explore vloggers like Ali Abdaal and Holly Gabrielle for an idea of what it is to create vlogs consistently. Meanwhile, we’ll leave you with an example video:\n\n23 Product Launch Videos\n\nBuild hype around your new product or anticipated feature launch by creating a product launch YouTube video.\n\nAnd keep the aim simple: drilling your key feature/message into your viewers’ minds. This example does so incredibly well:\n\nAs for a new feature promotion video, here’s a template to help you get started on the right foot:\n\nCustomize this template and make it your own!Edit and Download\n\nFor online stores, this would translate to launching new collection videos like this:\n\nCustomize this template and make it your own!Edit and Download\n\n24 Video Podcasts\n\nThese types of videos don’t take much work.\n\nAll you’ve to do is capture yourself and the guest recording the podcast. And there you go — you get the same content out to both audio lovers and video consumers.\n\nThe Joe Rogan Experience podcast repurposes content in this way:\n\nHow to Make YouTube Videos with Visme\n\nNow that you’ve got great YouTube video ideas, it’s time to create your own.
