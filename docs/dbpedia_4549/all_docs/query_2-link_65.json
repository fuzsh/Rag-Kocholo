Gaming has become a highly popular form of entertainment that has transformed into a billion-dollar industry today. That is why many want to convert their gaming passion into a real career. Game artists, developers, and designers are the coveted positions in the field. In this article, we look closely at the difference between video game designer and developer.\n\nVideo Game Designer vs Developer\n\nA video game designer works on the creative side of things and focuses on what the game’s aesthetic should be. Game developers, on the other hand, oversee the technical aspect of games by writing code that helps bring the designer’s vision to life.\n\nWhat is Game Design?\n\nEvery game has certain design aesthetics, rules, and a plot that defines the gameplay. Game design is the creative process that visually lays out these gameplay elements. It involves developing creative aspects like conceptualizing the story, creating characters, and making the game fun and engaging for players.\n\nALSO READ: Game Design: Step Into a Fun, Exciting Career for the Future\n\nWhat is Video Game Development?\n\nGame development is a technical application of game design that converts ideas and concepts into an actual game using programming languages. It is a multi-step process that involves coding, sound engineering, rendering, and game testing, among others, to get a game up and running successfully.\n\nALSO READ: How to Become a Game Developer and Create Great Gaming Experiences\n\nKey Differences Between Game Development and Game Design\n\nThe function of game design and game development is to create a real-world video game. However, the two roles are quite distinct. For example, we know that game design focuses on the creative aspect of a game while game development revolves around technical elements. Let’s look at some more differences between video game designers vs developers in greater detail.\n\nCurriculum\n\nThese are the foundational subjects that fall within the purview of game design:\n\n3D modeling\n\nConcept art\n\nScriptwriting\n\nAdvanced animation\n\nGame engines and analytics\n\nA game development curriculum includes the following subjects:\n\nAdvanced algorithm\n\n2D and 3D console programming\n\nVirtual reality development\n\nAdvanced simulation and tool development\n\nSoftware testing\n\nSkills\n\nApart from having a strong passion for video games, a game designer should be equipped with the following:\n\nCreative and artistic vision\n\nEffective communication\n\nAbility to work with multiple teams\n\nProblem-solving and analytical skills\n\nExcellent 3D modeling and drawing skills\n\nOn the other hand, a few essential skills that a game developer should have are:\n\nImpeccable coding and programming skills\n\nProficiency in advanced algebra and C++\n\nDatabase design and software development\n\nUser interface (UI) design\n\nQualifications\n\nGame design aspirants can pursue a degree in game design, graphic design, multimedia design, or any other related field. In addition, game developers generally hold a degree in simulation programming, computer science, or software engineering.\n\nJob Roles and Responsibilities\n\nThe primary responsibilities within the game design industry are as follows:\n\nCreate and plan new game ideas\n\nDevelop the outline, plot, and characters\n\nIdentify the target audience\n\nCollaborate with other team members and game developers\n\nThe primary responsibilities of a game developer are:\n\nCommunicating with game designers to review layouts\n\nGenerating game storyboards\n\nWriting effective codes\n\nCreating prototypes of features\n\nTesting and improving an existing game\n\nSalary\n\nAccording to Payscale, the average base salary of a game designer in the U.S. is $67,317, whereas the salary of a game developer is $69,343. When it comes to employment, jobs for web developers and digital designers are estimated to grow by 23% between 2021 and 2031, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor and Statistics.\n\nCareers with a Game Design Degree\n\nIt is important to note that there is a considerable difference between the career prospects for a video game designer vs developer roles. Game design careers involve several job roles that help build a fascinating world in a game to ensure that users have a fun experience. After pursuing an undergraduate degree in game design or a related field, candidates can expect to work within the following career disciplines:\n\nVideo game designer\n\nGraphic designer\n\nGame animator\n\n2D/3D artist\n\nCharacter designer\n\nCareers with a Video Game Developer Degree\n\nThose with the required technical expertise, skills, and a degree in game development or a related field can build successful careers as game developers. Since it is a broad field that covers multiple aspects of game production, aspirants can choose from a broad scope of job roles. Some popular careers in game development are:\n\nGame programmer\n\nGameplay engineer\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) programmer\n\nQuality assurance (QA) game tester\n\nSystems designer\n\nCan You be a Game Designer and a Game Developer?\n\nNow that we know the key differences vis-à-vis a video game designer vs a developer, it’s time to find out if one person can take on these two job roles. The short answer is yes. There are various job roles in the gaming industry, like coding, designing, user experience, art, etc., and coding is the most useful of all these skills. Here’s why.\n\nCoding powers everything. Creative concepts, characters, and music all come to life only when programmers write effective codes. Therefore, learning the fundamentals of programming and the creative aspect of game design will help you better understand the technicalities of game development, which can be a decisive advantage. So, game designers can advance in their field of work and take on the role of a game developer.\n\nALSO READ: Top 10 Inexpensive Ways to Learn How to Code\n\nShould Game Developers Know Game Design and/or Game Programming?\n\nGame design acts as the stepping stone toward creating a video game. Once the aesthetics, characters, rules, and world of the game have been established, it’s up to the game developers to turn this vision into reality. While it isn’t mandatory, it is a good idea for game developers to have a working knowledge of game design.\n\nNot only does the added design insight offer more reference points and a deeper understanding of the vision, but it also helps ease the integration process. After all, game designers are a game’s heart and soul. Game developers must also have basic coding knowledge and object-oriented programming (OOP) skills.\n\nWhich is Better: Game Designer or Game Developer?\n\nBoth game design and game development are integral aspects of game production, and the two roles go hand in hand. The goal of a game designer is to brainstorm and develop the best vision for a game that effectively describes its overall concept in detail. A game developer’s primary goal is to write codes and deliver programs to implement the designer’s vision while considering technical limitations.\n\nTherefore, when we talk about the video game designer vs developer difference, it is essential to note that these professionals are not competitors but collaborators. They work together to deliver interesting results. And regardless of the role you choose, the prospects in the industry are plenty.\n\nIf you are passionate about video games and want to get a head start in this billion-dollar industry, upskill with online technology courses at Emeritus and embark on an exciting career in the video gaming industry!\n\nBy Neha Menon"
