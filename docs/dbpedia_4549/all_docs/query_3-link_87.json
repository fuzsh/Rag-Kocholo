        "text": "This article is about the series itself, click here to see other uses for \"Crash Bandicoot\"\n\nCrash Bandicoot is a multi-million dollar video game series starring Crash Bandicoot as he battles his enemy and creator: the evil Neo Cortex. It was originally developed by Naughty Dog as an exclusive for Sony's PlayStation console and has seen numerous installments created by numerous developers and published on multiple platforms. The series consists predominantly of platform games, but also includes spin-offs in the kart racing and party game genres. The series was originally produced by Universal Interactive, which later became known as Vivendi Games. In 2007, Vivendi merged with Activision, which currently owns and publishes the franchise.\n\nThe Crash Bandicoot series has been a major international success, selling over 160 million in dollars and is the 25th best-selling series as of March 31, 2011 with around 40 million copies sold since its debut in 1996. In September of 2011, the series celebrated its 15th anniversary. On June 13, 2016, it was announced that the first three Crash games would be remade from the ground up. [1] The series celebrated its 20th anniversary on September 9th, 2016.\n\nMain characters[]\n\nCrash Bandicoot: The main protagonist of the series. He is a bandicoot who often foils Cortex's plans. In the earlier games, despite himself not being so strong, he can use Aku Aku to defend himself and also uses the spin attack along with a range of other moves to destroy enemies. In the later games, he is considerably stronger as he can beat up titans using his bare fists and scale certain walls.\n\nAku Aku: Once a human, his soul was absorbed inside a mask and now he acts as Crash's sidekick. He often protects Crash from hazards such as enemies. He also acts as a shield for Crash in the later games. He's the brother of Uka Uka.\n\nNeo Cortex: The main antagonist of the series. He is an evil scientist with a passion for mutating animals to create an army. Crash often foils his diabolical plans. However, Cortex has made many attempts to kill the bandicoot, but has always failed.\n\nCoco Bandicoot: Crash's smarter, younger sister. She is very good with technology and has created numerous inventions to help Crash and Aku Aku out on their adventures. She is the only female major protagonist. She is also good at fighting.\n\nUka Uka: Like Aku Aku, he was human until his soul was absorbed into his mask. He was then imprisoned by Aku Aku and the Ancients before meeting and teaming up with Cortex. He acts as an overarching antagonist.\n\nCrunch Bandicoot: A super-warrior of unbelievable strength, he was initially created to be General of the \"Cortex Commandos\" after Crash defied Cortex. However, Crash freed Crunch and the Super-Bandicoot had defected to the good side.\n\nOverview[]\n\nThe plot arc of the Crash Bandicoot franchise mainly focuses on Crash, an Eastern barred bandicoot who was captured and evolved by the mad scientist, Dr. Neo Cortex who plans to take over the world. During his adventures, Crash vows to stop Cortex or any other evil threat while maintaining peace around the island, with the help of his friends.\n\nThe gameplay in most of the Crash Bandicoot games is that of a 3D platformer game. The player controls Crash as he navigates through various obstacles like deep holes in the ground, moving platforms, enemies, and more. Crash's main form of attack is usually either a jump or a spin that can break crates and defeat most enemies. Some of the common collectibles in the games include crystals, gems and Wumpa Fruit. Collecting 100 Wumpa Fruit will earn the player an extra life. In certain sequences, the player would experience different challenges, such as 2D-based platforming, escaping a giant boulder or having to ride a tiger or a polar bear to navigate through a level. In some instances, the player also took control of Coco, Crunch, Cortex, and Nina.\n\nIn some multiplayer or party-style games, such as Crash Team Racing or Crash Nitro Kart, the main gameplay is racing-based or in other games, such as Crash Bash, consists of minigames for multiple players to enjoy in short sessions.\n\nIn Crash of the Titans and Crash: Mind Over Mutant, the player controls Crash going through levels collecting mojo, defeating enemies, and jacking titans.\n\nGames[]\n\nHome consoles[]\n\nGame Developer Release year Platform Crash Bandicoot Naughty Dog 1996 PlayStation Crash Bandicoot 2: Cortex Strikes Back 1997 Crash Bandicoot: Warped 1998 CTR: Crash Team Racing 1999 Crash Bash Eurocom 2000 Crash Bandicoot: The Wrath of Cortex Traveller's Tales 2001 PlayStation 2/Xbox/GameCube/Xbox 360 Crash Nitro Kart Vicarious Visions 2003 PlayStation 2/Xbox/GameCube Crash Twinsanity Traveller's Tales 2004 PlayStation 2/Xbox Crash Tag Team Racing Radical Entertainment 2005 PlayStation 2/Xbox/GameCube/PlayStation Portable Crash of the Titans 2007 PlayStation 2/Xbox 360/Wii/PlayStation Portable Crash: Mind Over Mutant 2008 PlayStation 2/Xbox 360/Wii/PlayStation Portable Crash Bandicoot N.
