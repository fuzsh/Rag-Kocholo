        "text": "History\n\nVIS Entertainment was founded as VIS Interactive in 1996 by Chris van der Kuyl, alongside Peter Baillie and some former staff from DMA Design, as well as \"other techy people\" from outside the video game industry.[1][2] A Dundee native, van der Kuyl headed the company as president and chief executive officer.[1] In 2000, VIS Interactive was renamed VIS Entertainment.[2]\n\nIn April 2003, the company acquired BAM! Entertainment's London-based development studio,[3] however, following several delays and cancellations to that studio's projects, it was announced in September that year that the studio would close following the completion of its remaining projects.[4] Another studio, located on the Isle of Wight, was closed in August 2003.[5] VIS iTV, a Dundee-based joint venture between VIS Entertainment and cable operator Telewest, laid off 75% of its staff in November 2003.[6] Following these layoffs, Jane Karowoski, chief operating officer for VIS Entertainment, announced that she would be resigning from the company.[7] The following the December, VIS iTV announced that their ongoing \"interactive virtual horseracing\" project, I-Race, was to debut on the newly established iSports TV.[8] That plan never materialised, and the venture was placed into administration in December 2004.[9] California-based Bellwether Group acquired VIS iTV and I-Race in January 2005 and hired five of its previous staff.[9]\n\nOn 18 February 2004, BAM! Entertainment announced that they were to acquire VIS Entertainment and State of Emergency Development, a subsidiary set up to fund development for State of Emergency 2, in exchange for shares valued around US$7 million .[10][11] The acquisition was completed on 25 May 2004.[12][13]"
