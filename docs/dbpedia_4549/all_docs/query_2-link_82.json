        "text": "Brian Gomez has been in game development for 16 years, starting with the unreleased but widely-pirated PlayStation fighter Thrill Kill. Since then, he has worked on a number of original and licensed game properties, including Full Spectrum Warrior, State of Emergency, and Brave: The Search for Spirit Dancer.\n\nAfter nearly five years in Scotland (as a designer, then Creative Director for VIS Entertainment plc) he returned to his native Los Angeles to work with Pandemic Studios on the urban combat sim, Full Spectrum Warrior. Afterwards, he formed an IP creation, management and production company, Alchemic Productions with two colleagues from Pandemic and Neversoft. Alchemic's first major project, Clive Barker's Jericho, was released in October 2007 by Codemasters. Gomez and Alchemic went on to develop other original game concepts with authors Larry Niven, Grant Morrison, and Jhonen Vasquez, but none of these projects found publishing partners."
