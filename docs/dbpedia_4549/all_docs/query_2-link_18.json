        "text": "Thank you so much for doing this with us! Our readers would love to “get to know you” a bit better. Can you share the “backstory” behind what brought you to this particular career path?\n\nOur merchant banking firm, The Bellwether Group, worked with many of the leading independent video game companies during the incredible boom of the video gaming industry from 2001–2010. This period covered the launch of the PS2 and Xbox, followed by the step function increase in performance of the PS3 and Xbox 360. Budgets for games were growing to astronomical levels, and so was innovation, both in terms of graphical quality and in more immersive and new types of gameplay. This is also when we saw the convergence of game genres into new categories. Many of the most popular games today are extensions of the trends that began then, like adding platform game mechanics into 3rd person action titles or utilizing RPG gameplay in first-person shooters. We had the pleasure of working with innovative and visionary studios like Bioware, Naughty Dog, Factor 5, and a very cool company in Dundee, Scotland called VIS Entertainment, famous for a game called “State of Emergency” (published by Rockstar). State of Emergencies’ open sandbox innovative gameplay and their Intelligent platform allowed hundreds of intelligent NPC “maniacs” to create a truly unique, manic, and enjoyable gaming experience.\n\nVis Entertainment had a side project they were working on to utilize simulation technology (typically seen in EA Sports games) and their NPC “intelligence” models but for horse racing. They were beta-testing a virtual racing game (VISiTV) made for Telewest’s Interactive TV platform in the UK. But, it was a situation of incredible technology (patented) that was well ahead of its time but needed a different distribution model to make it viable. It was not core to their business, and they were struggling. So, we acquired the company, and I made the career shift from consultant/merchant banker to running a video gaming company.\n\nIt has taken many years, a lot of technology, patents, and regulatory approvals to get to where we are today and finally deliver on our vision when we acquired the assets from VIS.\n\nCan you share the most interesting story that happened to you since you started your career? Can you tell us what lesson you learned from that?\n\nThis may be one of the toughest questions someone has asked me. I have had an incredibly exciting career that has taken me to most corners of the globe. My experiences at GE Capital, McKinsey & Company, and in forming several diverse companies have left indelible marks on me regarding how I think about business. I truly enjoyed my time at McKinsey and Company and got to work on some incredible projects with visionary CEOs, executives, and colleagues. I worked on new venture strategies in Oil and Gas in Southeast Asia, the FSU, and all over Latin America. In Germany, I helped launch mySAP.com and got to work directly with Hasso Plattner and his team’s complete transformation of SAP’s market-leading Enterprise Management Software to a web-based platform. I helped major mobile telecom technology companies take India and Brazil to mobile.\n\nBut definitely, the most interesting period of my career was when I worked directly with the President of a major Oil company to strategize and advise on the business and political negotiations of a gas pipeline from Kazakhstan to India, passing through Turkmenistan, Afghanistan, and Pakistan. It was a project with incredible potential, releasing huge deposits of land-locked gas from a region that couldn’t use it and moving it to a country that desperately needed energy to support its unprecedented growth. I worked in the shadow of the Chief Commercial Officer, and we held negotiations with Nazarbayev, “Turkmenbasi,” the Taliban, and the Pakistan and Indian governments. In the end, the project failed due to the impossibility of the political negotiations and the inability of the constituents to rise above their differences for the collective economic good. This failure taught me a lot about the challenges of getting historically competitive parties to work together and that even the most logical, economically sound projects are a “pipe dream” if this Tribalism cannot be resolved.”\n\nNone of us are able to achieve success without some help along the way. Is there a particular person who you are grateful towards who helped get you to where you are? Can you share a story about that?\n\nSure, I have been blessed with having countless mentors in my career. But one person, a partner at McKinsey named Tim Ling, who was the partner in charge of my client work in Oil and Gas, was the one who I reflect on almost daily. Tim taught me countless lessons about managing myself, making decisions, focusing on the highest value priorities, and how to work with senior-level executives and, for the first time in my life, politicians. But he also taught me how businesses achieve long-term sustainable growth. Tim was the guy that pushed me to punch above my weight. When he left McKinsey to become the CFO of our client, he asked the firm not to replace him on the engagement but to leave me in charge. His belief in me gave me the confidence to propel my career.\n\nUnfortunately, Tim passed away quite young while doing something he loved: playing hokey. But even that loss is something I have taken as a lesson to keep competing, stay healthy, and know your limits.\n\nHow have you used your success to bring goodness to the world?\n\nAs we say in gambling, “My chips are still on the table.” My success has been more experiential and potential building versus financial realization. So the “goodness” I bring, I suppose, comes from the time I commit to my community. I am also a sports fanatic, and there is little I like more than competing in, watching, analyzing, and coaching sports. I still play in a competitive soccer league and am one of a handful of players over the age of 40. I have dedicated much of my free time in the last 20 years to coaching young kids in soccer and basketball. I always view a coach’s role as a special one because you can influence a kid’s potential in so many ways, both off the court. I would like to believe that all my players have received at least a few morsels from me that have carried them in challenging times. I have the great joy now of actually playing summer league with some of my former players when they return home each summer from college.\n\nOk fantastic. Let’s now move to the main focus of our discussion. Can you tell us about the technological innovations in gaming that you are working on?\n\nThe convergence of competitive skill gaming with virtual sports. Supported by the utilization of AI and blockchain technologies. AI and blockchain represent a revolutionary fusion of two cutting-edge technologies, each contributing unique strengths to our gaming ecosystem and, we believe, the future of competitive interactive gaming. Virtual sports wagering is a billion-dollar-plus global industry; integrating player participation and skill gaming elements into these live contests allows for an entirely new competitive gaming and wagering experience.\n\nThe decentralized nature of blockchain technology brings a new dimension to gaming economies. It enables players to earn, trade, and utilize digital assets securely and transparently within the gaming ecosystem. This financial layer incentivizes players and introduces real-world value to in-game achievements.\n\nOn the other hand, AI-powered entities, such as those found in our lifelike virtual horse racing, introduce a dynamic layer of intelligence and unpredictability to the gaming experience. During a race, our autonomous AI-powered entities make thousands of decisions based on the tactics their owner has set. They adapt to various in-game scenarios and make real-time decisions to improve their chances of winning the race. This enhances gameplay depth and creates a more immersive, lifelike environment.\n\nPlayers enter a world where their strategic decisions directly impact their in-game success and rewards. This technology enhances competition and secures valuable rewards with blockchain management.\n\nHow do you think this might disrupt the status quo?\n\nOur venture into virtual horse racing represents a significant disruption to the status quo of the traditional sport. Horse racing has long been an exclusive and often inaccessible domain, primarily limited to those directly involved in the industry or the financial means to attend events.\n\nOur AI-powered virtual horse racing experiences are democratizing access to this sport. Our technology allows players from diverse backgrounds and locations to participate in horse racing without needing physical proximity to a racecourse. This broadens the horizons for horse racing enthusiasts and introduces the sport to new audiences.\n\nWe’re disrupting the traditional exclusivity of horse racing and making it accessible to a global audience. It becomes not just a pastime for a select few but an engaging and potentially profitable experience for enthusiasts and newcomers. We’re taking a step forward to preserve and evolve the legacy of horse racing for generations to come.\n\nYou, of course, know that games and toys are not simply entertainment, but they can be used for important purposes. What is the “purpose” or mission behind your company? How do you think you are helping people or society?\n\nAt Invincible GG, our mission is to usher in a new era of sports entertainment and competitive gaming through our patented innovations in video games, legal wagering, and artificial intelligence. We aspire to lead the world in interactive competitive sports and entertainment, offering a comprehensive ecosystem of accessible mass-market mobile and casino-based products.\n\nOur vision extends beyond business; it’s about building enduring, trust-based relationships with all our stakeholders and consumers. We’re not just redefining the gaming sector; we’re transforming virtual sports into an engaging and immersive experience that connects people socially. We aim to make gaming and gambling more inclusive, secure, and entertaining, benefiting individuals and society.\n\nI’m very interested in the interface between games and education. How do you think more people (parents, teachers etc.) or institutions (work, school etc.) can leverage games and gamification to enhance education?\n\nThe fusion of gaming and education offers an exciting opportunity for transformative learning, especially as it engages children with games they are passionate about. To realize its full potential, we encourage parents, educators, and institutions to wholeheartedly embrace educational gaming as a core part of the curriculum. This fosters engagement and nurtures critical thinking and strategic skills, all within the context of games that captivate young learners. Acknowledging the pivotal roles of parents and institutions, their active engagement will amplify the impact of this innovative approach, ultimately shaping an educational landscape that’s both captivating and profoundly effective.\n\nHow would you define a “successful” game? Can you share an example of a game or toy that you hold up as an aspiration?\n\nThe great thing about gaming is that players look for and take different things from games. For me, a game is about immersion, a great story, challenging problem-solving, competition, and the likely possibility of failure, which results in a fantastic feeling of accomplishment upon success. A successful game finds an audience of people who want to immerse themselves in the experience or, in IGG’s case, the competition. A successful game is when people think about how they will succeed, even when they are not playing.\n\nMy favorite game series is The Legend of Zelda, created by the legendary Japanese video game designer Shigeru Miyamoto (though I am also a fan of everything Naughty Dog and Bioware). The game has a protagonist, Link, who is the manifestation of the hero in us. Each game involves Link saving the kingdom from evil by learning to use new weapons and tools, solving ever-increasingly challenging puzzles, and defeating evil opponents. It is a game that does not require incredible tactile or fast twitch skills but leans heavily on your gaming IQ. Every time a new game comes out, they achieve the impossible — improve on a perfect game.\n\nWhat are the “5 Things You Need to Know To Create a Successful Game” and why.\n\nI don’t think I can give you five. But, one of the people I served as an advisor and learned the most from was Ray Muzyka, the co-founder of Bioware, who said: “Don’t build everything for everyone; focus on what is important.” We have taken this to heart in focusing on developing a game for skilled gamers and horse gaming enthusiasts. The game is about racing and competing using your intellect.\n\nHe also said, “It is as much about the social interaction of the people playing the game together as it is about the interaction of the game.” This is why, unlike all our competitors, we thought it was critical to create an entire part of our gaming ecosystem where players could compete in self-organized events or participate in self-formed race clubs and organized race leagues.\n\nFinally, Ray (and his co-founder Greg Zeschuk) held a session at BAFTA where they pondered the question, “If games are art, and if so, how?” They pointed to Tolstoy’s definition and made the point that the ability to create critical choices and moments within games that evoke emotion is what they consider art. To me, that also equates to a successful game. The lucky thing for us is that thoroughbred racing is a sport that inherently evokes emotion. But, in our game, the ability to properly train a horse to compete and develop the skills that, when combined with the right tactics, will make all the difference in a horse’s ability to succeed, especially when real money is involved, we believe makes the sport of kings, the sport of every competitive gamer.\n\nYou are a person of great influence. If you could inspire a movement that would bring the most amount of good to the most amount of people, what would that be? You never know what your idea can trigger. :-)\n\nHa, I hope to be in a position of significant influence due to this venture. There are a lot of people I respect greatly for turning their success and influence into global good. Certainly, Bill Gates is one. But the person I am most impressed and inspired by is Bono. Bono has created four massive charitable organizations: RED (to fight AIDS), ONE (fights extreme poverty), DATA (Debt, Aids, Trade, Africa), and EDUN (Fashion brand to fight 3rd World poverty by stimulating commerce). His Elevate PE fund invested hundreds of millions into disruptive startups and expansion-stage capital companies. He began doing African charitable work in 1986 when he was barely a star. The man is seriously committed to making a difference where it is needed most, where people have the least. I would ask people to get behind his initiatives — they all deserve endless support.\n\nCan you please give us your favorite “Life Lesson Quote”? Can you share how that was relevant to you in your life?\n\nSure: “Never put your shoes in the overhead luggage bin.”. I was in a 737 that crashed during takeoff over two decades ago (one of three close calls I have been in). I was working for McKinsey and heading to Mexico with my parents. I settled into my seat. I was on vacation, so I took off my shoes and put them in the overhead bin. The flight was half-full, and when a call came from my boss, I moved to the empty back of the plane to take the call in private. I stayed there for takeoff, but we never made it. As the plane’s nose rose, the left engine exploded, and the aircraft lurched back down and off the runway. Since I was at the back, I was the first one down the back slide responsible for catching all the other passengers as they came down in my t-shirt, jeans, and bare feet. I didn’t get my shoes back for six hours.\n\nThe lesson is “Don’t make decisions that remove your ability to deal with the unexpected.” It can still be my Achilles heel.\n\nHow can our readers follow you on social media?\n\nYou can find me on LinkedIn at https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathan-strause-6363172/\n\nThank you so much for joining us. This was very inspirational."
