        "text": "Beginning in the 1970s, video games ushered in a new phase in the long history of game playing, as they differed from traditional table games, board games, and children's games. Video games were the first type of game derived from information technology (IT). As such, the video game industry experienced major technological shifts as IT advanced over time, and its boundaries evolved rapidly with changes in platforms. For example, video game developers had to adapt to changes in hardware and IT infrastructure across arcade games, personal computer (PC) games, online games, console games, and smartphone/tablet games.\n\nAlthough video games evolved alongside the IT industry, the challenges facing game developers differed from those facing other companies in IT industries. Unlike other IT products and services, video games did not create value for consumers if they simply functioned; instead, they needed to entertain and to generate a sense of “fun.” Hence, companies that invested in video game development projects met with an inherently challenging form of business risk: how to forecast the continuously changing perception of what game players found entertaining.Footnote 1 The global video game industry grew exponentially in the decades following its origins and into the twenty-first century. By 2019, approximately one-third of the world's population was reportedly playing video games. The combined spending on video game products and services in that year was estimated to be worth US$152 billion.Footnote 2 The industry was also remarkably resilient and was only marginally impacted by the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.Footnote 3\n\nA striking feature of the video game industry is that, despite the global interest in games, developers became concentrated in certain locations in a small number of countries. This level of concentration is hardly unusual in business history, and much has been written about historical clusters of innovation in information technology (Silicon Valley, Bangalore, and Shenzhen), finance (New York and London), and fashion (New York, Milan, and Paris). There is also well-established historical evidence on the economic significance of geographical clusters and their tendency to foster innovation, whether in manufacturing or the creative industries.Footnote 4 In the case of the video game industry, the United States was the first mover and has remained the single largest market. In 2020, the overall U.S. market size as measured in revenue was US$42 billion.Footnote 5 There is an extensive historical literature on the American industry.Footnote 6 It began in the 1970s in Silicon Valley, California. Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney founded Atari in 1972 and launched the popular table tennis arcade game Pong the following year.Footnote 7 Around this time, Magnavox introduced an early video game console, the Odyssey, though it was short lived. As the industry grew, many other pioneering firms were based in California.Footnote 8 The American video game industry has been responsible for some of the most popular franchises, including The Sims, Halo, Madden NFL, Call of Duty, Half-Life, and Fortnite. Additionally, U.S. companies such as Atari, Apple, Valve, and Roblox have been instrumental in redefining the way video games are played on rapidly changing, innovative technology.\n\nStarting in the 1980s, Japan also became a major center of the video game industry. The Japanese market was worth US$21 billion in 2020.Footnote 9 In addition to the early launch of gaming consoles, the industry in Japan became associated with highly successful franchised characters such as Mario, Sonic, Pokémon, and Zelda. Japanese companies Nintendo, Sony, Square Enix, Sega, Bandai Namco, Capcom, and Konami have maintained unrivaled positions in their home market, and the industry has remained heavily clustered in Tokyo.\n\nBritain long held third place in the world industry, with innovative game design and cutting-edge skill sets in game production. The British market was estimated at US$6 billion in 2020.Footnote 10 Over the years, British-based companies produced such noteworthy games as Lemmings, Elite, Grand Theft Auto, Tomb Raider, Football Manager, Grid, Monument Valley, and Fall Guys. As this article will show, the British video game industry was in its development more fluid and geographically dispersed than its American and Japanese counterparts. It can be considered as a “dispersed cluster,” or rather, as multiple mini-clusters with porous boundaries. The small size of the country and efficient communications links between its regions enabled an easy transfer of knowledge from, for example, Scotland to the English Midlands and South East. “Mini-clusters” of game development companies grew, over the decades, in London, Glasgow, Dundee, Newcastle, Leeds, Sheffield, Nottingham, Cambridge, Manchester, Birmingham, Coventry, Bristol, Oxford, and Brighton.Footnote 11 There was considerable mobility between these mini-clusters by game professionals, and the industry was characterized by a high level of labor mobility involving project-based work across all regions.\n\nThis article focuses on game development companies in Britain. The broad outlines of the evolution of this industry are known, although the literature remains less extensive than in the American case.Footnote 12 It is argued here that British companies benefited from a geographic proximity that facilitated knowledge sharing among talents, suppliers, and customers. In other words, British games developers formed a quasi-cluster, even though companies of various sizes were dispersed throughout the nation.Footnote 13 The central argument is that between 1978 and 2020, game development companies benefited from the building of a nationwide talent pool and the transfer of knowledge via work, business, and institutional relationships across the United Kingdom.Footnote 14\n\nThe article proceeds by analyzing the historical evolution of the British video gaming industry. It identifies three distinct historical periods and explores the relationship between prevailing technologies and industry evolutions. The first period, from 1982 to 1993, saw the emergence of a flourishing “bedroom coding” community that benefited in part from the institutional support of the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) through its Computer Literacy Program. In the second period, from 1994 to 2006, much of Britain's fragmented industry was acquired by multinationals based in the United States and Japan, which had developed consoles for game playing. During the third period, from 2007 to 2020, independent domestic start-ups began to reappear with the rise of mobile gaming and digital distribution.\n\nBecause it was and remains populated by innovative organizations in constant flux, the video game industry is a challenging area to write about. There are few formal archives to consult. As a result, it was necessary to employ more unconventional sources and to build a picture of what was happening by triangulating different sources. Much of the raw data was found in gaming publications, which are a cross between fan magazines and trade journals. This article has relied heavily on end-user magazines (Computer and Video Games between 1981 and 2004, and Retro Gamer from 2004 onward) and trade magazines (Develop between 1996 and 2017, and MCV between 1998 and 2017). Company websites were consulted extensively and were a useful resource to track the creation, growth, closure, and acquisition of companies. As the magazine publication sector consolidated and moved online in the 1990s, data became available from new websites devoted to gaming, including Eurogamer. With the globalization of the video game industry over the past two decades, major developments in Britain were also reported in U.S.-based magazines such as Fortune, Business Week, IGN, and GameSpot. Industry publications from TIGA (The Independent Game Developers’ Association), the nonprofit trade association representing Britain's game industry, and Nesta (formerly the National Endowment for Science, Technology, and the Arts [NESTA]), a British-based innovation foundation, were also helpful. Finally, the author conducted extensive interviews with practitioners in the industry in Britain and elsewhere."
