        "text": "Introduction\n\nContents\n\nDedication\n\nOctober 1992: The Christmas Job\n\nSometimes life is circular. Even after moving away for a while, my first house ended up being only 1 mile away from the same mall, my current house about 5. I still go there often. My wife taught at the same high school I went to which sounds creepier than it actually is. Tell someone you married a teacher from your high school and see their reaction (of course she was not teaching there in 1992). Anyway, we decided it made sense to live nearby her work since mine was more likely to change (and it did in 2001). I'm sure when I was 17 I swore I'd leave town and never come back. I'd love to see the look on my pimply face when I heard that I'd still be in town 13 years later and be happy about it.\n\nOver the years Elbo would wisely transform into a gaming store, eventually re-branding as EBGames. Customers looking for productivity software increasingly turned to office stores or the internet for their needs. The Windows 95 Upgrade was the last application I can recall us regularly stocking. We kept that around because it was a requirement for most games made in 1996 and beyond.\n\nThe Super Nintendo would eventually build-up a solid library backed by a superior RPG selection. It sold more consoles worldwide in its lifetime but (at the store I worked at) the Genesis always sold more games. I'm hard-pressed to say which system I prefer. I've definitely played the Genesis more of the two. However, the Super Nintendo has some outstanding titles like Zelda: A Link to the Past, Super Metroid, and Super Mario RPG that can't be recreated on the Genesis.\n\nOver time the return policy would be slowly chipped away at. The addition of preowned games ultimately led to the death of the return policy. If you didn't like a game it could be traded-in for a fraction of the original price but full refunds would vanish. The old return policy made sense in a world with few rental stores and cartridge-based games, with wide access to rentals and demo discs it doesn't anymore.\n\nNovember 1992: Sega CD Launch\n\nDecember 1992: The First Noel\n\nOf course when you're selling items at a furious rate you have to restock at an equally furious rate. Roughly 10 boxes of fresh merchandise came into our tiny store every day in December. It was pretty much always left for the night shift (AKA \"me\") to unpack and stock. Some days the boxes would just be left open for customers to pick through.\n\nI bought the Nintendo GameCube the day it was released (the only time I've ever done that). It came with AV cables and s-video adapters were nowhere to be found, ditto for controller extension chords. I had it sitting in the box for 2-3 weeks waiting for these to show up in stores. Sure, I could just connect it to the regular AV ports and sit three feet from the TV but I preferred to wait.\n\nBy the end of the day on the 26th we were cleaned out of accessories and popular games. Controllers, even those shoddily made generic ones, went quickly. Kids who received Mike Ditka's Action Football exchanged it for John Madden. Nearly everyone who got a gift certificate redeemed it. When the gate closed at 9:00 the shelves inside were nearly bare.\n\nRelated\n\nAll source code and software on this site is distributed under The MIT License (copyright 2000-2024 Hugues Johnson) unless otherwise noted.\n\nAll other content on this site is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License unless otherwise noted.\n\nAll opinions on this site reflect my personal views and do not represent views of my current, or any former, employer.\n\nSite theme is based on Bootstrap licensed under The MIT License.
