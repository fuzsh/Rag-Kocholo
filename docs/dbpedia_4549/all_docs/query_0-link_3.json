        "text": "Part of a series onAction games\n\nThis is a dynamic list and may never be able to satisfy particular standards for completeness. You can help by adding missing items with reliable sources.\n\nFighting games are characterized by close combat between two fighters or groups of fighters of comparable strength, often broken into rounds or stocks. If multiple players are involved, players generally fight against each other.\n\nNote: Games are listed in a \"common English title/alternate title – developer\" format, where applicable.\n\nFighting games that use 2D sprites.

These often emphasize sidestepping.\n\nWhile traditional 2D/3D fighting game mechanics are more or less descendants of Street Fighter II, platform fighters tend to blend fighting with elements taken from platform games. A typical match is arranged as a battle royal. Compared to traditional fighting games, attack inputs are simpler and emphasis is put on dynamic maneuvering in the arena, using the level design to get an advantage. Another major gameplay element involves using items, which may randomly spawn anywhere in the arena. Other terms which were used to refer to this sub-genre included \"Smash Clones\", \"Party Brawler\", \"Party Fighter\", and \"Arena Fighter\" (that is also being used to define another style of 3D fighting game).\n\nFighting games that use 2D sprites.

Such games are usually based on boxing, mixed martial arts, and wrestling, and each sport seen as their own separate subgenres. Often the combat is far more realistic than combat in fighting games (though the amount of realism can vary greatly), and many feature real-world athletes and franchises.\n\nBoxing games go back farther than any other kind of fighting game, starting with Sega's Heavyweight Champ in 1976, the game often called the first video game to feature hand-to-hand fighting. Fighters wear boxing gloves and fight in rings, and fighters can range from actual professional boxers to aliens to Michael Jackson.\n\nBoxing games where combat is not directly human-controlled in the ring. Instead, a boxer is trained via a resource management game scheme, and bouts are directed via instructions given prior to each round.\n\nWhile most versus fighting games could be considered mixed martial arts games, listed here are games that are based on actual MMA franchises or tournaments.\n\nAstral Bout / Sougou Kakutougi Astral Bout – King Records\n\nAstral Bout 2 / Sougou Kakutougi Astral Bout 2 The Total Fighters – King Records\n\nAstral Bout 3 / Fighting Network Rings: Astral Bout 3 / Sougou Kakutougi Astral Bout 3 – King Records\n\nBuriki One – SNK\n\nDef Jam: Fight for NY – Aki / EA Canada\n\nEA Sports MMA – EA Sports\n\nEA Sports UFC – EA Sports\n\nEA Sports UFC 2 – EA Sports\n\nEA Sports UFC 3 – EA Sports\n\nEA Sports UFC 4 – EA Sports\n\nEA Sports UFC 5 – EA Sports\n\nFighting Network RINGS: PS one 1997\n\nGrappler Baki Baki Sadai no Tournament / Fighting Fury PS2 2000\n\nGarouden Breakblow PS2 2005\n\nGarouden Breakblow Fist or Twist PS2 2007\n\nK-1 PREMIUM 2004 Dynamite PS2 2004\n\nK-1 PREMIUM 2005 Dynamite PS2 2005\n\nMMA Tycoon – Browser 2009\n\nPRIDE FC: Fighting Championships PS2 2003\n\nPrideGP Grand Prix 2003\n\nTDT-Online – TDT\n\nTheFlyingKnee – Browser/Animated 2011\n\nThe Ishu Kakutougi/World Fighting PS2 2003\n\nThe Wild Rings Xbox 2003\n\nUltimate Fighting Championship – Anchor Inc.\n\nUFC: Sudden Impact – Opus\n\nUFC: Tapout – DreamFactory\n\nUFC: Throwdown – Opus\n\nUFC 2009 Undisputed – Yuke's\n\nUFC Undisputed 2010 – Yuke's\n\nUFC Undisputed 3 – Yuke's\n\nUFC Personal Trainer (video game) – Yuke's\n\nSaikyō: Takada Nobuhiko Super Famicom 1995\n\nSupremacy MMA – Kung Fu Factory\n\nK-1 World GP\n\nK-1 World GP 2006\n\nK-1 Premium 2005 Dynamite!!\n\nK-1 World GP 2005\n\nK-1 World Max 2005\n\nK-1 Premium 2004 Dynamite!!\n\nK-1 World Grand Prix 2003\n\nK-1 World Grand Prix: The Beast Attack!\n\nK-1 World Grand Prix\n\nK-1 Pocket Grand Prix 2\n\nK-1 Pocket Grand Prix\n\nK-1 World Grand Prix 2001\n\nK-1 World Grand Prix 2001 Kaimakuden\n\nK-1 Oujya ni Narou!\n\nK-1 Grand Prix\n\nK-1 Revenge\n\nLegend of K-1 Grand Prix '96\n\nK-1 The Arena Fighters\n\nFighting Illusion K-1 Grand Prix Sho\n\nLegend of K-1 The Best Collection\n\nWrestling games are either based on or have elements of wrestling, such as professional wrestling, grappling, or the wrestling ring itself.\n\nWrestling video games based on WWE/WWF properties.\n\nGames involving flying objects that can include balls and discs, where the players can only interact with each other through the object, and may or may not include goalposts.\n\nGames based on popular anime series and 3D variants often feature cell shading. \"Anime fighters\" also usually have very fast-paced action and put emphasis on offense over defense.
