This included drawing of detailed architectural plans and full inventory of stone slabs and their fragments, which had been left in place after the 19th-century excavations, and also identification of hundreds of known fragments of low reliefs which had been taken away from Nimrud in the past. As a result, it was possible to reconstruct whole relief compositions, taking into account also the presumed location of the fragments which had become scattered all over the world.\n\nExcavations were also conducted in the central part of the nearby citadel. The relics of another building from the time of Ashurnasirpal II, probably one of the eight temples built by him on the citadel in Nimrud, were discovered there. Other important finds included a pair of lamassu sculptures from the building of Shalmaneser III (the successor of Ashurnasirpal II) and a deposit of reliefs from the time of one of the later rulers, Tiglath-pileser III.\n\nThe palace was destroyed in 2015.\n\nGallery:"
