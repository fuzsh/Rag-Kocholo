        "text": "The scale of the damage done by Islamic State militants to the ancient city of Nimrud is beginning to emerge, two days after it was retaken by Iraqi forces.\n\nMuch of the area lies in rubble, with shattered statues and a ziggurat reduced to a fraction of its size.\n\nIS circulated video footage showing militants blowing up or smashing up monuments and artefacts last year.\n\nGovernment forces recaptured Nimrud as part of a wider assault on Mosul, the last major IS stronghold in Iraq.\n\nA senior source in the Iraqi military's Nineveh Operations command reported significant advances around the city on Tuesday.\n\nThe UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (Unesco) described the destruction of Nimrud last year as a \"war crime\", saying IS was \"clearly determined to wipe out all traces of the history of Iraq's people\".\n\nThe jihadist group has denounced pre-Islamic art and architecture as idolatrous, and has destroyed several other ancient sites in Iraq and neighbouring Syria."
