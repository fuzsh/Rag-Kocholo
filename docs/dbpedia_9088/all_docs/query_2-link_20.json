He is accompanied by a parasol-bearer and is watched over by a winged deity. He holds a bow and a pair of raised arrows, symbolizing victory in battle. This is a typical depiction of Assyrian kings during the Neo-Assyrian period (ca. 912-609 BCE), showing the king as an imposing figure with long beard, tall headdress, and implements of battle. The relief is from the North-West Palace at Nimrud (ancient Kalhu), which Ashurnasirpal II made the capital of Assyria. Nimrud remained the capital until the reign of Sargon II."
