        "text": "JUDY WOODRUFF:\n\nThe ISIS campaign of terror, murder and conquest has been well-documented, but the group has also used its particular interpretation of Islam to justify the destruction of historical treasures in what is known as the Fertile Crescent, the area in Mesopotamia between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, where the earliest recorded civilizations began.\n\nFrom the ancient ruins of Nimrud in Northern Iraq, special correspondent Marcia Biggs reports.\n\nIt's part of our ongoing coverage of Culture at Risk.\n\nMARCIA BIGGS:\n\nThe road to the cradle of civilization is finally accessible. We're making our way there to see what's left of a 3,000-year-old city after only 2.5 years under ISIS.\n\nWith us, two archaeologists, Leila Salih, originally from nearby Mosul, and Tobin Hartnell, an Australian teaching at a local Kurdish university.\n\nIt takes us four hours to travel the roughly 35 miles, through checkpoint after checkpoint controlled by Kurdish Peshmerga and Iraqi Shia militias.\n\nSheik Khalid Al-Sabah Al-Jabbouri commands the Shia militia controlling the area. He grew up in this village, and treasures memories of picnics at Nimrud and the buses full of tourists.\n\nMARCIA BIGGS:\n\nNimrud is the ancient city known as Calah in the Bible, capital of the Assyrian empire, known for its famous lamassu, winged bulls guarding the gates of the palace. It was destroyed in the seventh century B.C.\n\nIts ruins buried in time, archaeologists unearthed it 2,500 years later. When the Islamic State captured parts of Northern Iraq in 2014, it declared war on the ruins of Nimrud, releasing this video of ISIS militants taking sledgehammers to the ancient site, drilling holes in its carvings, and finally blowing the entire place up.\n\nWhen ISIS took the town, they also destroyed Sheik Khalid's home and killed 40 of his family members, including two brothers. But he says he rarely cried, until he saw this ISIS video.\n\nKHALID AL-JABBOURI (through interpreter):\n\nI lost something priceless. My sorrow lies in the fact that we lost something that we were so proud of when tourists came to our country. The pride we felt for them and our civilization, what our forefathers made for our country, it's a subject that's part of our soul.\n\nWhen the Saddam regime fell in 2003, we and our clans protected those monuments because there was no central Iraqi government. We were able to protect the palace from looting. But ISIS, ISIS did something we were not expecting.\n\nMARCIA BIGGS:\n\nThe area was taken back by Iraqi forces last November, but it was forever changed. When we arrived, the first thing we noticed was that the pyramid-like structure, the famous ziggurat of the Ishtar Temple, was erased from its skyline, and the temple once at its feet the victim of a massive explosion.\n\nTOBIN HARTNELL, Archaeologist:\n\nEvery photograph, every view I have ever seen of Nimrud has that temple, that ziggurat. And it's gone. That's the thing that is the most devastating, is to see it just bulldozed, just â€” it's gone. The iconic image of Nimrud is with the ziggurat.\n\nMARCIA BIGGS:\n\nFor Tobin Hartnell, this was an experience he'd waited for. He studied Assyria and its ancient capital for 15 years, yet he had never seen it.\n\nHe took a job teaching at the American University of Iraq in 2014 and was just about to move his family when ISIS swept through the region.\n\nTOBIN HARTNELL:\n\nWe got basically the e-mail or a call, in my case, an e-mail, saying, well, you don't have to accept the job because ISIS has just taken Mosul.\n\nMy wife and I, we talked about it, we're going, because, as archaeologists, this is where the work needs to be.\n\nTOBIN HARTNELL:\n\nI mean, it's bittersweet. This is an incredible site that I have been looking forward to going to for over 20 years. And look at it. I mean, walking over rubble, the destruction that ISIS has left has turned one of the most magnificent palaces of Assyria into a disaster zone.\n\nLEILA SALIH:\n\nTo be honest with you, at that time, we didn't care about historical things or ancient civilization things. We just would like to escape out of school. But what I can remember, the huge figure of lamassu and the facade of that palace.\n\nMARCIA BIGGS:\n\nSalih is from nearby Mosul, much of it still controlled by ISIS. She fled in 2014 with only a handbag. She was the curator for the Mosul Museum, which ISIS was seen destroying in these videos.\n\nYet, even with the widespread damage, both she and Hartnell say there is still hope for Nimrud.\n\nMARCIA BIGGS:\n\nOne source of hope, large chunks of the rubble still exist, which makes restoration easier. And several of the original lamassu bulls excavated in the 19th century have been living for decades in museums in London and New York.\n\nWhile the displaying of Iraq's antiquities abroad may have been controversial, for the man whose childhood was spent among the ruins, this actually provides some comfort.\n\nKHALID AL-JABBOURI (through interpreter):\n\nMaybe we Iraqis felt hurt when we saw our monuments displayed outside of Iraq. We get hurt because it's our civilization.\n\nBut when ISIS occupied the city, I felt relieved that Nimrud monuments had been transported outside of Iraq and remain protected. And we are proud of them wherever they are.\n\nTOBIN HARTNELL:\n\nIf, when we're doing our cleanup and restoration, we take some more time to dig down, we will find many more discoveries from what happened before the empire, what happened in the 10th, 11th, 12th centuries, which are also great periods in Mesopotamian history. And yet we know almost nothing.\n\nTOBIN HARTNELL:\n\nYou have to see, be there, see the destruction to start to formulate a plan. Archaeologists need to be on the ground.\n\nSo, I won't say a dream comes true, but it was on my dream list before it was destroyed, and for very good reason. This is a fantastic place, and I think it will be again."
