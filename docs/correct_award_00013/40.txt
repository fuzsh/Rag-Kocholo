In 1909 Guglielmo Marconi and Ferdinand Braun of Germany were jointly awarded the Nobel Prize in physics in recognition of their services in the development of wireless telegraphy. This wording suggests that Marconi did not invent radio, as is so often thought, but helped to develop it. This in a sense is true. When Marconi was a boy at school the brilliant German scientist, Heinrich Hertz, first demonstrated conclusively the existence of radio waves, and Marconi's own early work in radio was to a certain extent paralleled by Popov in Russia and by Braun himself as well as others. Yet it is to Marconi almost entirely that we owe the present world-wide importance of radio. There can be no question that Marconi was indeed "the father of radio."
