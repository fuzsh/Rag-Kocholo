        "text": "Guglielmo Marconi’s name is synonymous with the invention of radio. Where others had failed, the famous Italian entrepreneur found a way to transmit signals without the help of wires, culminating with the first transatlantic wireless message in 1901 and the first transatlantic radio message a year later. Marconi went on to share the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1909. He helped make a commercial success of wireless telegraphy – a system that has evolved into the global wireless transmission network many of us now take for granted.\n\nThe daughter of radio pioneer Guglielmo Marconi, Princess Elettra Marconi Giovanellli of Italy visited Ontario Tech University in 2014 as part of her tour of North America to celebrate her father’s entrepreneurial legacy and promote science and technology endeavours by young people.\n\nInvestment revenue from a $250,000 endowment will be used to provide annual awards to students in physics, computer science and mathematics through the Guglielmo Marconi Endowed Scholarship. These scholarships were made possible by a donation from the Canadian Italian Heritage Foundation (CIHF), in co-operation with the National Congress of Italian Canadians – Toronto District and Amici Museum.\n\n\"Guglielmo Marconi was a dreamer who was not afraid to challenge limits,\" said Michael Tibollo, Chair, CIHF. \"He was an inventor, someone who inspired and continues to act as a role model for students of the sciences.‎ This scholarship is dedicated to him and those who dare to dream beyond limits.\""
