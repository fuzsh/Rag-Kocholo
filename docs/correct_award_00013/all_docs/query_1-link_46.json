        "text": "The University of Notre Dame’s Wireless Institute (WI), a prominent research organization dedicated to advancing wireless technologies, has recently become a member of the esteemed Marconi Society. This membership is a clear indication of WI’s unwavering commitment to excellence in wireless communications.\n\nEstablished in 1974, the Marconi Society is a non-profit organization that recognizes and celebrates the achievements of individuals and organizations who have significantly contributed to communications. Named after Guglielmo Marconi, who invented wireless telegraphy and was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1909, the society has an elite group of Fellows.\n\nBy being a member of the Marconi Society, the Wireless Institute can leverage the expertise of a global network of communication experts and thought leaders. This community comprises policymakers, technologists, and advocates for digital inclusion who are committed to shaping the future of digital equity.\n\nOn April 19, 2024, the Wireless Institute will celebrate 125 Years of Wireless at Notre Dame by highlighting past, present, and future wireless research and accomplishments. A notable past achievement is Professor Jerome Green’s successful wireless radio transmission in 1899, which occurred from Notre Dame to the Saint Mary’s College campus, covering one and a half miles. Professor Green’s research was significantly influenced by Marconi, who developed and broadcasted the first successful wireless transatlantic radio signal in 1901.\n\nThe Marconi Society will also participate in the celebration at Notre Dame. Further details about this historic event will be announced closer to the date."
