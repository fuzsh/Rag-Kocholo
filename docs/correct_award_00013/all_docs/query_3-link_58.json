        "text": "On April 25, 1874, an Italian physicist and inventor Guglielmo Marconi was born. He went on to become a Nobel Prize laureate as well as a pioneer in the field of telecommunications. His revolutionary work laid the foundations for modern telecommunication technologies, which we are still using today.\n\nMarconi´s vision of connecting a world without wire also inspired TTC MARCONI. The company was founded in 1993 as a result of the partnership between the Czech company TESLA TELEKOMUNIKACE and the Italian company MARCONI. In the TTC Group, we carry on the legacy of Marconi´s innovative spirit and continue in his effort to shift the boundaries of telecommunications.\n\nFoto: Shutterstock"
