        "text": "Guglielmo Marconi (1874-1937)\n\nGuglielmo Marconi was born in Bologna, Italy in 1874. His mother was Annie Jameson of Daphne Castle in County Wexford and his first wife was the daughter of Baron Inchiquin. He was educated privately at Bologna, Florence and Leghorn where he was interested in physics. On his father's estate, he sent wireless signals over two kilometres and became the inventor of the first practical system of wireless telegraphy.\n\nMarconi came to England in 1896 and demonstrated his system of wireless telegraphy and formed The Wireless Telegraph and Signal Company in 1897. In the next few years the distance over which wireless could operate increased and by 1901 they could cross the Atlantic Ocean, between Cornwall and St. John's, Newfoundland. In 1907 the first transatlantic commercial service was established between Clifden in County Galway and Glace Bay in Nova Scotia. He went on to develop other communication systems including radar.\n\nMarconi received many honours in his lifetime and was awarded many honorary doctorates. He shared the Nobel Prize in 1909. He was given the freedom of Rome and was honoured by Russia, England and Italy. He received the heredity title of Marchese in 1929 and died in Rome in 1937."
