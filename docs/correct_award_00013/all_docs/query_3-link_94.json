        "text": "The Genius Minds\n\nIn July 1897, Guglielmo Marconi formed the first wireless communication company in the world — 137 years ago this month!\n\nIn my engineering school, a dorm was named Marconi Hall. I didn’t know much about Marconi at the time. Later, I pursued research in electromagnetic fields, the same area as Marconi, and presented a paper on Microstrip Antennas at the International Union of Radio Science.\n\nMarconi never attended formal school but received an honorary doctorate and Nobel prize in 1909 for his work in physics.\n\nMarconi was very interested in physics and electricity. Marconi studied the works of other scientists and began experimenting with wireless communication in the 1890s. In 1896, at 22, he demonstrated wireless radio and filed for a patent.\n\nAlthough there are claims that Bose and Tesla demonstrated wireless communication before Marconi, the first ever patent on Radio Wave communication was issued to Marconi in 1896!"
