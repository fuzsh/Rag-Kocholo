        "text": "Born in Italy, this celebrated inventor who won the Nobel Prize for his “contribution to the development of wireless technology” came to New Jersey in 1899 and did much of his pioneering work here in our state. Marconi stands out among some of the greatest pioneers of radio communication who called New Jersey home, including Thomas Edison, Lee De Forest and David Sarnoff. Over a 15-year period, Marconi pursued his experiments in several locations from Highlands to New Brunswick, making Hoboken his American home. He shared the 1909 Nobel Prize in Physics with Karl Ferdinand Braun. In 1912, his wireless was renowned for saving those who got into the Titanic lifeboats and made the world realize the value of his wireless system. Finally in 1914, he established a brand of the Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company in Wall Township, where he built his lab, dormitories and home. It is now the site of the Info Age Science/History Center, which seeks to preserve Marconi’s memory and excite young people about the field of science."
