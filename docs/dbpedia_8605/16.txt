Tribalistas is a Brazilian musical trio consisting of Marisa Monte, Arnaldo Antunes, and Carlinhos Brown. Formed in 2002, they quickly gained popularity with their unique blend of MPB (Música Popular Brasileira), samba, and pop influences. Their harmonious vocals and poetic lyrics have made them a significant presence in the Brazilian music scene, with hits like 'Já Sei Namorar' and 'Velha Infância' becoming anthems.

Their songs often explore themes of human connection and emotions, reflecting a desire for companionship and the joy found in social and cultural inclusivity. Recent works continue to celebrate the richness of Brazilian culture, capturing the vibrant spirit of carnival and the anticipation and longing that come with deep personal relationships.
