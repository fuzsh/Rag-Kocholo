        "text": "If you ever set foot in Calgary, you probably realized that one of the things that make the city stand out is its great diversity. According to Canada’s 2016 census, Calgary is home to more than 240 ethnic origins, making it the third most diverse city in the country. Unsurprisingly, over 120 languages are spoken in the city, which makes perfect sense if you take into consideration that almost 30% of Calgarians are immigrants. What you might not know, though, is that, among this wide range of languages, Portuguese is one of the most commonly used.\n\nOne of the fastest-spreading languages in the world, Portuguese can be heard in most major cities. Although it originated in Portugal, nowadays only 5% of its native speakers can be found there, while the rest reside in countries as varied as Brazil, Guinea-Bissau, and Angola. As you might have heard, there are two main Portuguese variants you can learn, the original European variety and the warm Brazilian one. When it comes to choosing which one to learn, the decision is entirely yours, but don’t overthink it! Both of them will expand your horizons just as much and fill your life with many incredible experiences.\n\nWhy Study Portuguese in Calgary?\n\nLearn Portuguese for Work and Travel\n\nWas it the musical sounds of Portuguese that sparked your attention? You will be happy to learn that this captivating language also happens to be the key to advancing in your career. It is no secret that, as the world becomes more global, the demand for professionals who can communicate in multiple languages grows more and more every day. Nowadays speaking more than one language is not only necessary to communicate with people from other countries, but also to connect with the part of the local community who speak a different language than English. This is especially true if you live in Calgary, which has one of the highest levels of net migration in Canada. For this reason, companies in the area are constantly looking for applicants who are fluent in languages like Portuguese for job positions that include Customer Service Representative, Solution Architect, and Dedicated Services Engineer.\n\nAdditionally, if you’re interested in working abroad, learning Portuguese will open the doors to many wonderful destinations. Brazil, for example, has the seventh-largest economy in the world, and it also happens to be one of the most beautiful countries out there. Its idyllic beaches and incredible landscapes are a huge draw for anyone looking to experience a tropical paradise where many great job opportunities can be found, especially in areas like IT, finance, and engineering.\n\nLearn Portuguese for Social\n\nDo you want to immerse yourself in Brazilian culture without leaving Calgary? Thanks to\n\nThe Brazilian Community Association of Alberta, you can do just that! This non-profit organization has been promoting Brazilian art and culture in the entire province since 2003. Throughout the year, they organize many festivals inspired by Brazilian traditions. The first one, in January, is Réveillon, held at the Scandinavian Hall, located at 739 20 Ave NW, a celebration where people gather to welcome the new year. It’s a great way to listen to traditional Brazilian music while you engage in a good luck ritual that will make the first day of the year extra special.\n\nAnother fascinating festival you can attend is Carnaval, inspired by one of the greatest cultural celebrations in Brazil. Held at Acadia Hall at 240 90 Ave SE, this festival has many activities for the whole family that include face painting, costume contests for kids, and percussion workshops. What’s more, you’ll be able to enjoy international musicians and dance groups who especially come to Calgary for this Event.\n\nLearn Portuguese for Culture\n\nAlthough learning a language by yourself is all right, there’s nothing quite like meeting other language enthusiasts along the way. In Calgary, you can attend one of the events held by Calgary Portuguese Language, a free language group that meets regularly at Mazaj Lounge & Restaurant South, located at 9223 Macleod Trail SW. Just get a language poster that says “Portuguese” from one of the waiters and put it on your table as you wait for others to arrive. Once you find your language partner, you can choose one of the many ice breakers suggested by the group and start practicing your language skills.\n\nWhere to learn Portuguese in and around Calgary?"
