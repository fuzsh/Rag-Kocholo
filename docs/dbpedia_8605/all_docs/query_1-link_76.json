        "text": "Brazil is famous for its contagious energy. Whether it be the music, the culture, or the colorful traditions, there is something about Brazilian creativity that exhibits a certain flair. We see this extraordinary ability of Brazilian people to astonish the world in many different ways. Some see it on the football pitch or in the sea on a wave; however, it is undeniable that over the course of time, Brazilian music has ignited the emotions of millions across the globe. Reflective of the melting pot of culture that is Brazil, Brazilian music has been influenced by everything from African and European traditions to Indigenous cries and North American pop. Compositions in Brazil take the form of original and authentic Brazilian musical genres such as the famous Samba, Bossa Nova, and Forró, and lesser-known styles such as Sertanejo, Pagode, and Frevo. Here, we have handpicked the top 10 most beautiful Brazilian songs that will give you a taste of Brazilian musical style. From the most romantic Bossa Nova to the liveliest Samba, add these to your playlist and enjoy the sounds of Brazil!\n\n1)”Mas que nada” (1966) – Sergio Mendes and Brasil ’66\n\nOriginally written by Jorge Ben in 1963 for his album “Samba Esquema Novo,” this beautiful composition experienced real success when it was covered by Sergio Mendes, especially in the USA. It is now famous all over the world and has been covered several more times including by “The Black Eyed Peas.”\n\n2) “Domingos no parque” (1967) –Gilberto Gil and Os Mutantes\n\nBorn in Salvador de Bahia in 1942, Gilberto Gil became known worldwide as one of the legends of Bossa Nova. He was also Minister of Culture under the Lula government. This song tells the story of a friendship between José and João, two boys who fall in love with the same girl Juliana. Eventually, José sees João with his beloved and, overcome by jealousy and grief, kills them both. An anticlimactic ending to a beautiful song! The song is notable for its innovative blend of traditional Brazilian music with modern rock influences, thanks to the collaboration with Os Mutantes. Its narrative style and dramatic conclusion make it a poignant and memorable piece in Brazilian music history.\n\n3) “Água de Beber” (1963) – Antônio Carlos Jobim\n\nIt is said that “Água de Beber” (drinking water) was written by Jobim when he was invited by the then-president of Brazil to Brasilia, the new capital which was under construction. On a walk with Vinicius de Moraes close to the workplace of the president, they asked a guard “que barulho de água é esse aqui?” (what is this sound of water?) to which he replied “É aqui que tem água de beber, camará.” (Here there is water to drink, my friends). The song captures the essence of Bossa Nova with its smooth melodies and poetic lyrics. Jobim’s mastery in combining sophisticated harmonies with simple yet profound lyrics makes “Água de Beber” a quintessential Brazilian classic, evoking the serene beauty of Brazil’s natural landscapes.\n\n4)”Carolina Bela” (1970) – Jorge Ben and Toquinho\n\nOne of the major successes of both Jorge Ben and Toquinho, this song has been covered many times since its inception in 1970. The technical guitar intro is reflective of the protagonist’s mixed feelings towards “Carolina Bela.” His love for her makes him speak, lie, cry, and smile– all at the same time. The flair and technical ability required to play this song really show in this live version! The song’s intricate guitar work and heartfelt lyrics showcase the deep emotional connections and complex feelings often explored in Brazilian music. It remains a beloved piece, celebrated for its lyrical beauty and musical complexity.\n\n5)”Sorte Grande (Poeira)” (2003) – Ivete Sangalo\n\nA lively classic “Axé” song, this one is certain to get you moving your feet.
