Since then, he has co-led the group Trio Da Paz for over 25 years. Having recorded over 200 albums, he has brilliantly combined American jazz and the heart of Brazilian music, shining bright light on what is most uplifting and heartwarming in both cultures: abiding love and friendship.\n\nDa Fonseca and The All-Stars are comprised of world-class soloists, including Maucha Adnet, vocals, Anat Cohen, saxophone and clarinet, Helio Alves, piano, and Martin Wind, acoustic bass. Together, they redefine America jazz and represent the jazz of the Americas.\n\nTickets for the Duduka Da Fonseca concert are $35 general admission, $33 seniors and BMA members, and $10 students. Tickets can be purchased in advance at http://www.baltimorechamberjazz.org, or at the door.

        "text": "Music is one of the things that can have the most intense effect on us. For me, this is especially the case when it comes to Brazilian music. It reminds me of my childhood and some of the moments I’ve enjoyed most – it has the power to leave me completely home-sick and longing to go back to Brazil, or to bring me happiness and remind me of my origins and the reasons Brazil is such a special place. The Tribalistas, a Brazilian group composed of Marisa Monte, Arnaldo Antunes, and Carlinhos Brown – on and off over the past two decades – are no exception to this.\n\nThis past Tuesday, February fifth, the Tribalistas preformed at the Hammesrtein Ballroom, located on West 34th Street in Manhattan. Although the organization of the concert itself was lacking – disregarded seat placement and the show beginning too early – (I suppose at least some of the organizers were Brazilians after all) it was an incredible experience. The three artists, along with their other band members have an unparalleled stage presence. The venue was packed with Brazilians and people who enjoy this style of alternative, experimental, Brazilian rock music. The group preformed their most classic hits from their first album (2002), such as “Já Sei Namorar” and “Velha Infância,” as well as newer songs from their most recent album (2017), both of which are titled, “Tribalistas.” Additionally, they played a couple of songs from Marisa Monte albums, like “Amor, I Love You” and “Não É Fácil” – the crowd went wild.\n\nNow the group, who does not often go on tours, will continue this one throughout the U.S. If you have the chance, get tickets to see them! Otherwise, make sure to explore or re-explore the Tribalistas’ music – you won’t be sorry.\n\nTwitter: @TheHammerstein\n\nHARTFORD — A renewed effort to bring professional soccer to the old Dillon Stadium in Hartford. A new group of investors, led by Bruce Mandell, has been selected to put together a team for the United Soccer League (USL), and have them ready to play next April. Mandell said he will pay rent to use the stadium, but, unlike the previous group, will have nothing to do with the necessary reconstruction of the stadium. The earlier project folded, after the city complained that it was being overbilled for expenses, and subcontractors were not being paid. Ultimately, the two men behind that deal were convicted of fraud.\n\nhttp://fox61.com/2018/01/23/the-real-story-pro-soccer-in-hartford/\n\nAND THE BRAZILIAN JAZZ ALL-STARS TO BALTIMORE\n\nConcert by Legendary Drummer To Be Held at Baltimore Museum of Art January 31\n\nBALTIMORE, MD – January 8, 2016 – The Baltimore Chamber Jazz Society (BCJS) continues its 2015-2016 season at the Baltimore Museum of Art, on Sunday, January 31, 2016, at 5 p.m., with a performance by the legendary, Grammy nominated Brazilian drummer Duduka Da Fonseca and The Brazilian Jazz All-Stars.
