        "text": "Brand Identity, Graphic Design, Communication Campaign and Merchandising\n\nTribalistas is a Project of encounters. Encounters between Marisa, Brown and Arnaldo, as well as an encounter between Vik and Leo, which was suggested by a close friend, Fabio Ghivelder. In our case, says Leo, a distant encounter, once we worked without meeting each other, exchanging ideas in a digital way. Nevertheless, we were able to develop a very consistent project, where the main concept was the translation of the integration and complementarity of the three artists around music."
