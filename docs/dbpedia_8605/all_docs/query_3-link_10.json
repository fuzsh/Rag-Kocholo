        "text": "Even though I am not fluent in Portuguese I still wanted to see Marisa Monte live based on the fact that I had listened to her album and I thought that she has a very beautiful voice.\n\nThe first thing I noticed when I first saw her from the front row was her long flowing black hair and her pretty smile as she waved to all of us in the crowd and I assumed she was thanking us for coming to her concert. She was wearing a beautiful dress and said that the first song she would play would be 'Diaramente' one that I had recognized off of her album that she had been promoting.\n\nEveryone in the crowd cheered loudly as she finished her first song and made the transition to the next one and all of the people around me were clapping and I joined in. Marisa did a wonderful job on all of the songs that she sung and I felt that her voice very closely matched what you hear on the album. The dark atmosphere of the venue set the perfect mood for the songs sung by Marisa.\n\nThere were not many lights that were going on and off but the same amount of lighting that focused on Marisa during her set. These lights really brought her center stage and highlighted the performance.\n\nRead more"
