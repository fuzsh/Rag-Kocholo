        "text": "Deemed “one of the most exquisite voices in Brazilian music” by The New York Times, Marisa Monte returns to North America by popular demand. After the triumphant kickoff to her world tour in March 2022, the Brazilian diva took her spectacular Portas tour to sold-out venues across Europe and Brazil and returns to the U.S. in the fall of 2023.\n\nReleasing one wildly successful album after another, Marisa Monte is recognized as the greatest Brazilian singer of her generation. Her music blends samba, pop, jazz, and soul, all featuring her exquisite voice. The five-time Latin Grammy winner will perform songs from her latest release, Portas, and many of her classic hits. With direction and visual design by Marisa Monte, Cláudio Torres, and Batman Zavareze, onstage Marisa is accompanied by Dadi (bass, keyboard, and guitar), Davi Moraes (guitars), Pupillo (drums), Pretinho da Serrinha (percussion, cavaquinho, and vocals), Chico Brown (keyboard, guitar, bass, and vocals), Antonio Neves (trombone, brass adaptations, and arrangements), Eduardo Santanna (trumpet and flugelhorn), and Lessa (flute and sax). In addition to the songs from the new album, the show highlights important moments in the singer-songwriter’s career spanning more than three decades."
