        "text": "Sometimes the best records come together by happy accident, or as a natural consequence of artists unselfconsciously living out their creative lives. When Rio-based singer Marisa Monte decided to go to Salvador de Bahia for a week to participate in an album being made by the poet Arnaldo Antunes, with percussionist Carlinhos Brown as producer, the three musicians' familiarity and rapport soon generated its own creative outpouring. They found themselves spontaneously writing songs together in a very organic way.\n\n\"This was not a project, it was a dream,\" recalls Monte, whose home studio became the base for recording the album that resulted from a two week session exactly one year later, this time with her as producer.\n\nTribalistas is an inspired, understated song cycle of great delicacy - largely acoustic, but also a hugely accessible pop record, judging by the five Latin Grammy nominations it received. The CD idles though Brazilian waltz, samba, bossa nova, rock and soul, with even a Christmas song and a lullaby thrown in for good measure. Antunes' gravely baritone sticks like a shadow to Monte's velvet croon, and Brown's usual rhythmic pyrotechnics are on hold for the entire 40-minute duration. Instead, he rummages around imaginatively in a varied bag of tricks that includes a bucket, a pipe, an emery board and an ashtray. He occasionally takes Antunes' place as a singer, but always projects his colleagues' musical mannerisms through an empathetic percussive approach, which works wonders.\n\n\"Despite the fact that it was me playing, I tried to imagine how Arnaldo would play if he was in my place,\" Brown explains. \"One thing that's for sure is the communion amongst us,\" observes Monte. \"I believe that in life, some of the most interesting results that we get come from a collective work.\"\n\nAnd whether their busy respective solo careers permit them to explore the Tribalistas 'anti-movement' further as a live unit or on future recordings, this is one hell of an act to follow.\n\nJon Lusk, November 2003\n\nRead other peoples comments\n\nI love OS Tribalistas. when I hear them songs I dream about Brazil(my favourite cauntry)\n\nOla- Poland\n\nI first saw them on Link TV's World Music, and fell absolutely with Marisa's voice. They are great, very visual, evoking warm breezes and poignant memories.\n\nRicardo\n\nThe more I listen to this CD the more I love it. Velha Infancia is one of the most beautiful songs I've ever heard both musically and lyrically. I first heard the song while attending my sisters wedding in Rio...how appropriate. \"EU QUERO MAIS MÚSICA DO TRIBALISTAS\". I hope they continue to collaborate thier talents!\n\nTommy C\n\ni am an african american jazz lover but when i listened to this cd i was completley taken by there sound. i love this band.hope they wiil due a u.s.tour soon thanks\n\ndavid\n\nTry Kotoko / Jpop ;)\n\nzobar\n\nWTF is wrong with u all just one band and u all are ready to go to hell for them damm they are cool but they are not the only one´s :!\n\nzobar\n\ni think that Tribalistas are the best in the world. their music take you in another planet.their songs can express what i'm feeling in this particular moment of my life.\n\nLiliana\n\nI´m a new \"member\" at your page and I love it (I am a regular listener of Radio-3 Spain)and I have noticed that fortunately there are more Portuguese and Brasilian music lately. I really think that Brasiliam musicians have a special talent and their lyrics are very interesting. I love the kind of music you support in some way.\n\nMiguel\n\nTribalistas - Ja Sei Namorar IS THE BEST SONG IVE EVER HEARD. I FIRST NOTICED IT ON THE PS2 GAME FIFA 2004\n\nPaul\n\nIt's amazing to see how so many people enjoy this CD without even understanding the lyrics. All I have to say is, once you understand the poem, it gets even better! Congratulations, Tribalistas.\n\nMaristela\n\nI lived in Brazil for 3 months...I fell in love with the song 'Velha Infancia'. I have not been there for 2 years, and the song still plays in my head.\n\njennifer\n\nI'm from Brazil and I really love Tribalista's songs! They are the best ones I've ever listened. With them I'm proud of being brazilian. I really love my country..\n\nSoraya\n\nAWESOME!!!!\n\nSERGIO BORREGO\n\nThis is some of the best music I know of. Uplifting, soothing, rythmic in a laid back kind of way. It just fits.\n\nRineke Brouwer\n\nTribalistas are the best band ever.They made me think about music in other way. THE MUSIC THAT THEY PLAY IS THE BEST AND I HOPE THEY DONT STOP MAKING MUSIC LIKE THAT.THANK YOU FOR YOUR MUSIC TRIBALISTAS.\n\nCarlos Vargas\n\nAn excellent song from an excellent album. It is a great combination of brazilian moods, modern acoustic sounds and, above all, beautiful soft voices of Marisa Monte and Arnaldo Antunhes. This album surely deserves more publicity worldwide. I am looking forward to listening to their new album if there will be one.\n\nPredrag\n\nThe mellow tone of the portuguese accent, light-heartedness of the songs and overall calm produced make the tribalistas and their album fantastic. Although from time to time the album's music gets a little \"iffy\" and dare i say \"cheesy\", most of their music is absolutely brilliant and awesome- to say the least.\n\nNíck\n\nsimply awesome.they must play everywhere!\n\narmando\n\ni lived in brazil 4 months thats where i know their music and now i cant take it of my head they are great\n\nmiriam\n\nTribalistas enlighten my day! It is an amazing project that bring happiness to many lives through their music. Brasilian music is just easy to listen to !\n\nTiago L\n\nat times there's a trifle too much of saccharine...yet, in all a very enjoyable album which can lift your spirit.\n\nLucas\n\nOverall the album is both suprising and entertaining.It was hard to find a copy of it in New Zealand as its popularity was underestimated with inital orders.A brilliant mix which provides songs for every mood and mindset;from celebratory rhythms to the reality of life, this album has it all and more.\n\nReinhardt von Faülkenhausen III\n\nMarisa Monte is wonderfull, Arnaldo is great and Brown is pure rhythm. It seems like he is burning inside when he is thinking and playing. With Marisa - one of the best Brasilian's voices, it couldn't be better. Brazilian's music is just wonderfull! Still together, guys!\n\nAlicia F.\n\nVery good music. Tribalistas is an life\n\nSuzana Cândido\n\nWhen you lisen to Tribalistas it gives you a great feeling of happyness and i have to pick up the guitar and play with them.\n\nMastros Arvidos\n\nI find it a very uneven piece of music. While \"Ja Sei Namorar\" is arguably the best song of the year and the first three tunes of the cd are close, the rest is incredibly cheesy. Knowing what these people are able to do with certain songs, the album on the whole is a disappointment.\n\nJoan\n\nFirst time of listening, a cold damp Yorkshire morning, cars thundering down the valley, kids fratching in their bedrooms a day of washing, working, cooking and cursing ahead and I'm mesmerised by the gentle weave of voices and percussion. Who needs prozac?\n\nHester Dunlop\n\nVery good song and very good CD!!! The Tribalistas is an excellent example of the contemporary Brazilian music. Enjoy them! And vote for them!!\n\nMarina"
