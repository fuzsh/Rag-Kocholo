        "text": "Too old? They're all 60s or 70s. I wouldn't play much 60s or 70s music to, say, a typical British audience, but to a salsa crowd, at a Latin night or for that matter at a reggae night, I could definitely get away with music from those decades (albeit mixed with a lot of modern stuff). I thought perhaps Brasilians like a few old school classics. Or is it the choice of tunes, rather than the era they were made?\n\nYes , it was more the choice of tunes..sergio mendes is not known here and i really cant remember other song from him except mas que nada, which is a Jorge ben jor song..from you selection people llike djavan toda menina baiana but jorge ben and gilberto gil people wont know the songs you chose..people love chico buarque,caetano, tim maia RIP and some of their songs are known by everyone and they were made before I was born.\n\nDjavan- eu te devoro, se, oceano, Tanta saudade, fato consumado, Samurai, meu bem querer, lilas\n\nJorge ben jor - Chove chuva, pais tropical, fio maravilha, Mas que nada, taj mahal, Cade tereza, a banda do ze pretinho, Por cause de voce menina\n\nGilberto gil - Vamos fugir, aquele abraco, Andar com fe, Nao chore mais, toda menina baiana, xote das meninas\n\nThey are so good that i cant choose the best songs..\n\nI am afraid no..in fact,when someone mention the 'olg school' ladies clara nunes is not easily remembered..most people would remember gal costa, maria bethania\n\nInteresting... I do have several Gal Costa albums that are marvelous. I have the one she did with Caetano Veloso, \"Domingo\", when they were both very very young. That is my Sunday morning music ritual. I play it every Sunday morning with my coffee. It's the most relaxing music I have ever heard.\n\nHow about Elis Regina?\n\nInteresting... I do have several Gal Costa albums that are marvelous. I have the one she did with Caetano Veloso, \"Domingo\", when they were both very very young. That is my Sunday morning music ritual. I play it every Sunday morning with my coffee.\n\nHow about Elis Regina?\n\nYeah, everyone knows elis songs..her daughter brought back some elis fans, alwasy comparing both etc ( as you love maria rita, people love to dance samba to ' ta perdoado and cara valente' ). The 'new' ladies voices includ her, ana carolina, marisa monte.. I bet you know marisa from the project os tribalistas, with the arrangements of carlinhso brown.. And fo course you know this song with bebo valdes http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wb2fHIUOuTQ\n\nCaetano for me is a god..he brings tears to my ears every show i had the pleasure to watch..he make some good arrangements that really match his not so ' strong' voice. I am sorry dylan but caetano's jokermank is better than yours rsrs\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nT5xwiYneWU&feature=youtube_gdata_player\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n777E104Vns&feature=youtube_gdata_player\n\nAnd yes, his two cds ' circulado' are a must have .\n\nYes , it was more the choice of tunes..sergio mendes is not known here and i really cant remember other song from him except mas que nada, which is a Jorge ben jor song..from you selection people llike djavan toda menina baiana but jorge ben and gilberto gil people wont know the songs you chose..people love chico buarque,caetano, tim maia RIP and some of their songs are known by everyone and they were made before I was born.\n\nDjavan- eu te devoro, se, oceano, Tanta saudade, fato consumado, Samurai, meu bem querer, lilas\n\nJorge ben jor - Chove chuva, pais tropical, fio maravilha, Mas que nada, taj mahal, Cade tereza, a banda do ze pretinho, Por cause de voce menina\n\nGilberto gil - Vamos fugir, aquele abraco, Andar com fe, Nao chore mais, toda menina baiana, xote das meninas\n\nThey are so good that i cant choose the best songs..\n\nThat's a relief - I thought you were going to tell me that Brasilians don't dance to Jorge Ben, in which case I would really be wondering what the world is coming to. I also have and love the songs you have listed by him; as far as I'm concerned he's one of the very best singer songwriters of the 20th century. Chove Chuva is possibly my favourite Jorge Ben, although I had thought it might be too slow for dancing.\n\nIsn't Upa Neguinho one of the most famous Brasilian songs ever? There's certainly 1000s of covers. The version I listed (the original, by Edu Lobo) is a classic. Brasilians won't dance to it?\n\nI'll check the other tunes you have listed.\n\nits slow but he released a live album with that song singed a little faster and since then every band did it that way http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8JwGUBF33I..and there are some slow songs we like, like tim maia gostava tanto de voce that no matters how one sing it, everybody like it!\n\nmonobloco http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zr1RmCoFe10\n\nwe are latin crowd so sometimes is more about feelings and energ than \"slow or fast\"..i went to a live show from sambo, i didnt know the band work before the show, and they did an amazing show besides all the haters haha..its a band who get rock, pop, mpb songs and play them as samba\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NK1YY9l8vDQ&feature=related\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ue9eOhM6AU&feature=relmfu\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4r2HU3h2b4Q&feature=related\n\nsoo, time to report back\n\ni played the brazilian gig the other day and some of your song recommendations came in very handy, thankyou\n\napart from attracting some brazilians we were also raided by a group of about 25 spanish students who asked me for regueton and then went completely nuts on the dancefloor which set the pace fairly high , i was worried that i was going to upset the brasilians but\n\nreports from the brazilians were that they like that kind of thing, so i guess there is a middle ground after all between brazilian dancefloor culture and hispanic\n\ni did manage to wind it around again to forro and stuff after that\n\nespecially thankyou to each contributer for giving me a good start on a journey of getting to know brazilian music , will take me a while to get there but im on the way"
