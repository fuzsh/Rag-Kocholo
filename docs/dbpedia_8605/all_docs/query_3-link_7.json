        "text": "published on 2012-08-27T03:01:10Z\n\nArnaldo Antunes, Carlinhos Brown, Marisa Monte. Here's a rough translation: Love is ugly. It's got the mug of a vice. It walks along the road With no sense of obligation. This is what love is. It's got the mug of a beast. It left my darling Lying in the trash. Love is dirty. It smells like piss. It's scary. I'm getting you out of this mess. Love is beautiful... Love is beautiful. It does the impossible. Love is grace. It gives and moves on. Love is free...\n\nGenre\n\nUke Cover"
