        "text": "We are proceeding in the exploration of the elements in my Thursday yoga class. Moving upwards in the human body, last week‚Äôs theme was FIRE üî• in Sanscrit called agni.\n\nIn its natural settings, fire stands for warmth, light, and transformation. Fire generates heat and has been used for cooking and warming; however, as nice as it can be, one needs to be extra cautious with this element. It can easily get out of control and grows faster in proportions than any other element. In excess, it can be very harmful for its environment. At worst, it can cause devastation, leaving only ashes.\n\nEastern traditions locate fire in the core of the body, especially in the stomach ‚Äì affecting digestion, and in the heart ‚Äì affecting our feelings and emotions.\n\nEmotions like love, compassion and appreciation, and behaviours like being enthusiastic, caring, nurturing and decisive are positive expressions of the element of fire in humans. These are also the qualities we aspire in a yoga class.\n\nIn Taoism, which is the philosophy behind most martial arts, fire stands for action and transformation. In an earlier blog entry, I mentioned Kung Fu when introducing the element of water. The flowing movements of water are used to avoid attacks throughout a fight; and also, as a way to observe and test the skills and abilities of the opponent. However, when it is time to move over to action phase, the warrior performs swift and strong kicks and arm movements, using the energy of fire to surprise the opponent and break down its deffence.\n\nIn Vedic philosphy, fire is connected to our ability to take action. A person we would call ‚Äúa doer‚Äù in the West is often called a fire-type in the East. These kinds of people make warm friends and good leaders, often perceived as enthusiastic and inspiring. They are great at holding firy speaches that motivate others to do their best. However, when put under pressure, these same people get easily agitated. If the pressure continues for a longer time, some might turn hostile or even aggressive, acting out and hurting others verbally and/or physically. Other people might react in a different way, and especially in a state of chronic stress turn their fire inwards. In this case they will hurt themselves and the fire will slowly consume their vitality and might lead to a mental break down. In Western terminology this state is called a burn-out. I n the West, we also treat these two types of reactions of firy people differently. We punish the first type of behavior (agitation and aggression) and medicate the other (burn-out). However, in an Eastern perspective, both states, aggressivity as well as a burn-out, are viewed as a result of too much fire that got out of control. The Eastern solution in both cases is to ‚Äútame the fire‚Äù, that is balancing up the elements in the body through different physical and mental practices.\n\nIn a Western medical perspective, burn out and depression are considered as forms of mental illness caused by an unbalanced life style involving too much action with little time for rest. In this sense, the increasing cases of depression in our society might be seen as mirroring our fast, unbalanced Western life style. What we reward is doing, doing, barely ever being and observing. No wonder it leads to a mental breakdown.\n\nAnd still, if we observe the consequences of fire in its natural settings, we realize, that a complete destruction of an old structure may also give rise to something new and fresh. If we look at a field after a big, devastating forest fire, we see no signs of life. Nevertheless, after some rain (life giving water), we can see how the previously empty field starts to revive and small green sprouts pop up from the earth, amidst the ashes. So fire, especially in its most devastating form, can be a start for a new beginning ‚Äì thus the association with transformation.\n\nSeen from the Earth, the Sun is the closest star of the universe, and as such, the largest embodiment of fire in our vicinity. In many ancient cultures it has been honored in different rituals as a source of life. The most known sequence in yoga, the sun salutation, or Surya Namaskar is also connected to the element of fire. In the Vedic culture, sun salutations have traditionally been performed early in the morning, at sunrise, as a devotional practice to greet and honor the Sun deity; in this way people of the Indus valley were expressing gratitude for the light, the warmth, and the rise of a new day (symbolizing new beginning), honoring the Sun as a fuel of change, a vehicle for life itself. Today, sun salutations are practiced all over the world as a part of yoga practice, preferably still in the morning.\n\nSome other known forms of fire are the bonfire, the candle and the fire place in old houses. The picture I chose to illustrate this blog entry, originates from the Japanese anime ‚ÄúHowl¬¥s moving castle‚Äú, directed by Hayao Miyazaki. In this movie, which a highly recommend for all ages, there is a fire spirit called Calcifer. At the start, he does what fires often do: gives warmth and cooks food for the people living in the house. However, as the story unfolds, the cute little fire spirit turns out to have a quite important role, having a major impact on several characters in the story. Without revealing too much, we get to see many different ‚Äúfaces‚Äù of fire in the story, and get also to the heart of the matter about love. To give you an impression of what I mean, here are some more pictures from in the movie:\n\nDespite of yoga, there are many ways you can evoke the feeling of fire in your everyday life, inviting its positive qualities into your life. By choosing music with care, decorating the room with warm colors and soft, cuddly materials, or why not making up a real bonfire with friends next time you are together outdoors?\n\nI made a special flower mandala for the same purpose: to evoke the feeling of fire in the participants. It looks advanced, but actually it isn‚Äôt. You can do it too! All I needed was three roses and two kinds of autumn leafes. By placing the darker colours at the core, and the lighter ones towards the margins, finally adding a swirl to the whole arrangement, it gave the impression of a fireball.\n\nFinally, click on the link below if you want to get access to the playlist I created for the fire class. It is 90 minutes long playlist, and in the picture displayed here you only see the first part of it. The list includes a mix of different styles, you¬¥ll hear drums and strokes, guitars, violins, sometimes a whole orchestra ‚Äì these instuments make us feel warm inside and help us through some tough yang style sequences. I hope you find the music inspiring even outside a yoga class.\n\nAccording to the Vedic teachings the qualities we admire in others, we also become. So bring some awareness on who you admire and why. And don¬¥t be shy to tell people when you appreciate something they offer to you or do for the benefit of others. Seing and appreciating those qualities will help you grow into those qualities as well.\n\nTo sum it all up, yang style yoga classes help us to enhance fire in our being, and sometimes this is exactly what we need. In a balanced manner, fire helps us to focus, be decisive and creative, so we can shine bright like a star, being more effective in our pursuits in life. However, be cautious for what you call for. If you have been ‚Äúon‚Äù both physically and mentally for the whole day, a yang-style class is not exactly what you need. What you need is rest and relaxation to balance up the excess heat in your sytems. In this case a more yin-based approach or one of the two breathing techniques described above might be more beneficial for you.\n\nNext time you feel the need for transformation, go get a yang class ‚Äì Ashtanga, a fast Vinyasa flow, or try martial arts!"
