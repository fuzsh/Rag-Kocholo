        "text": "Singer, songwriter, poet and avant-garde artist, Arnaldo Antunes’ work has had a major impact on Brazilian pop culture over the last 40 years. He first rose to stardom in the 1980s as a founding member of the ground-breaking group Titãs, that mixed punk with pop and Tropicalia. He then embarked on a successful solo career and had his songs recorded by legends Caetano Veloso, Gilberto Gil, and Marisa Monte. With Monte and Carlinhos Brown he formed the Latin GRAMMY winning supergroup Tribalistas, which released two blockbuster albums containing several timeless compositions. For this tour entitled “Lágrimas no Mar”, Antunes will perform in a voice and piano format for the first time, accompanied by young piano prodigy Vitor Araújo. This special concert featuresnew arrangements of hits from Antunes’ entire career as well as some new songs. This is a rare US tour by one of Brazil’s great artists."
