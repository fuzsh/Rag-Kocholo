        "text": "It's safe to say that we all need a little bit of calm right now. A safe harbor, a cozy nook, a place to go to get away from it all (at least for a little while). Before you brew a cup of tea, grab a book, or light an aromatherapy-tinged candle, make sure you have a calming, soothing playlist to serve as the perfect backdrop for your preferred form of self-care. Maybe the music is a bit jazzy, with a soft beat to it, or piano-centered, or of the Spanish coffeehouse variety — whatever floats your boat, as long as it's relaxing AF and quickly gets you to the aforementioned safe harbor.\n\nThe playlists included here are great for doing yoga, stretching, or even some slow functional training, but they can also work for any moment when you need some calm. We can't make outside problems go away, but we can take some time for ourselves to recharge and come back renewed and refreshed. So, the next time you show yourself some TLC, put on one of these playlists and feel your stressed-out thoughts slip away."
