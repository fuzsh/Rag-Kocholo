        "text": "The music business has a few ironclad rules, and topping the list is the imperative to make hay quickly while the sun shines. When an artist scores a major hit, everyone with a stake in his or her success works to get them out on the road to support the project and then back in the studio to release more music before the next hot young thing comes along.\n\nBut the rules never seemed to apply to the Brazilian supergroup Tribalistas. Bringing together São Paulo poet and rocker Arnaldo Antunes, Salvador da Bahia percussionist-producer-composer Carlinhos Brown and Rio de Janeiro vocalist and musica popular brasileira (MPB) standard bearer Marisa Monte, the triumvirate released one international hit album in 2002 and refused to play the music biz game.\n\nThe trio completely shunned Brazil’s hyperactive music media, never giving radio interviews or performing on television, which has played a central role in minting pop stars since the 1960s. Tribalistas never even performed a concert. And instead of following up with a sequel, they went on releasing various solo projects, albums that often featured songs they’d worked on together.\n\nSo it came as something of a shock when Tribalistas resurfaced in the summer of 2017, releasing a second self-named album that promptly topped the Brazilian charts. Not only that, the band hit the road in 2018, and they’ve been performing ever since, including a brief U.S. tour that hits The Fillmore Feb. 16-17.\n\nIn a recent phone conversation with Monte, she explained why Tribalistas defied the pressures and expectations that they’d support the original album with an international tour. It seems she had bigger, or rather, smaller things on her mind. “When the album was released, I’d just had my first baby, and it was impossible to go on the road,” said Monte, 51. “With its huge success, a tour would have been global, and I was 35 at that point. I figured I had the right to live my maternity moment without pressure.”\n\nIt’s hard to overstate the 2002 album’s impact. Arriving at a moment when the MPB movement seemed to be exhausted, “Tribalistas” (EMI) embodied everything that made Brazil’s post-bossa nova popular music so pervasively influential. With a name riffing on the Tropicalistas – the Caetano Veloso, Gilberto Gil, Tom Zé and Gal Costa-led movement that gleefully mashed together regional Brazilian styles, rock, art music and psychedelia— the Tribalistas extended that tuneful legacy, collectively generating a stream of melodically charged songs.\n\nThey’re so productive as a songwriting team that Tribalistas is a vehicle for not quite half of the material they’ve created together. While the band’s repertoire features 23 original songs, nearly three dozen other songs they’ve written have been recorded in other contexts. On Monte’s 2011 chart-topping album “O Que Você Quer Saber de Verdade” (EMI), just about every song is a collaboration with Antunes and/or Brown.\n\n“Before composing as a trio we were three songwriting duos,” Monte said. “We all write music and lyrics, and we are very open in our work. We are very collaborative and good partners, with other people as well. For us, it’s like playing to try to write a song. Some people play soccer, some play cards. We like to do songs. But I live in Rio, Carlinhos is in Salvador, and Arnaldo is in São Paulo. It’s not that easy to meet.”\n\nSo why now? What led to the second Tribalistas album, when they’ve all been thriving recording on their own? “We had nothing that would be an obstruction,” Monte said. “It was a celebration of 25 years of partnership, because we started working together long before the first album. Now, all these songs are not ours anymore. We’re doing these huge concerts in Brazil, and people are singing all the songs from beginning to end. It’s a celebration, something in our common history.”\n\nAnyone who’s attended a concert by a Brazilian star can attest that the artist’s fellow citizens aren’t shy about joining in. The concerts are truly communal celebrations. For this tour, the trio’s party also includes stellar musicians such as guitarist Pedro Baby; drummer Marcelo Costa; Pretinho da Serrinha on the ukulele-like cavaquinho and Dadi Carvalho on bass, guitar, mandolin and keyboards.\n\nAs the junior member of the Tribalistas trio, Monte continues to flourish amid what she calls the group’s “mysterious chemistry.”\n\n“Carlinhos is an amazing creator who was the most widely admired musician when I was coming up,” she says. “And Arnaldo is a super solid guy, a poet who was already famous. As a teen, it was a dream to become their partner.” She adds that they were whom she wanted to compose with when she was 20. And now she’s on the road with them, too.\n\nContact Andrew Gilbert at jazzscribe@aol.com\n\nTRIBALISTAS\n\nWhen: 9 p.m. Feb. 16, 8 p.m. Feb. 17\n\nWhere: The Fillmore, 1805 Geary St., San Francisco\n\nTickets: $63; thefillmore.com"
