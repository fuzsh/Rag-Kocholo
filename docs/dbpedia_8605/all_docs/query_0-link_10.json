        "text": "Tribalistas, the trio formed by the popular Brazilian artists Marisa Monte, Arnaldo Antunes and Carlinhos Brown have made a surprise comeback with four songs released today (April 10).\n\nThe artists announced their reunion on social media, publishing clips of the trio recording the tracks, which will be included on their second album, which comes 15 years after their first. The new recording will be released later this month, followed by a TV special to air on Brazil’s Globo Network.\n\nMonte, Antunes and Carlinhos Brown were all well-established artists in their own right when they released the instantly appealing and intensely groovy Tribalistas in 2002 as a one-off project.\n\nThe easy chemistry between the three artists quickly resulted in a hit record in Brazil and in Europe. Tribalistas were nominated for five Latin Grammys in 2003, and received the award for Best Brazilian Contemporary Pop Album."
