IBM Corp. won stockholder approval of a buyout bid and closed another acquisition deal in two recent developments that will bolster its product and service offerings.

Internet Security Systems Inc. (ISS) will become an IBM subsidiary after shareholders Monday approved a US$1.3 billion cash offer. IBM announced on Aug. 23 that it was buying the Atlanta company. ISS’ security services aim to protect networks, servers and desktop and laptop PCs by pre-emptively blocking Web threats, such as spam and viruses. When announcing the potential purchase, IBM said that ISS will become part of IBM Global Technology Services division and that it plans to keep ISS’ 1,300 employees.

IBM completed its $1.6 billion bid for FileNet on Thursday, a move that adds to the company’s enterprise content management (ECM) portfolio. FileNet’s content management and business process applications have been used by 4,300 businesses. Although IBM runs its own ECM division and FileNet’s software will be added to that business, the company will support both platforms. FileNet’s applications will be integrated with IBM’s business process management and SOA (service-oriented architecture) wares, IBM said when it announced the acquisition.
