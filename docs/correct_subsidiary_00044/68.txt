Embellishing its security lineup for Internet businesses, IBM today said it plans to acquire DASCOM, a developer of network security software that helps businesses connect their systems to the Web.

DASCOM, based in Santa Cruz, Calif., makes software for managing access to network resources. DASCOM's software lets network administrators centrally manage and secure multiple Web servers as a single entity.

DASCOM, which has about 100 employees, will become a subsidiary of IBM. The companies did not disclose financial terms of the deal.

IBM and DASCOM had a pre-existing partnership: Technology from DASCOM's IntraVerse product is offered as part of IBM SecureWay Policy Director and SecureWay FirstSecure.
