        "text": "Internet Security Systems, Inc., often known simply as ISS or ISSX (after its former NASDAQ ticker symbol), was a provider of security software and managed security services. It provided software and services for computers, servers, networks, and remote locations that involve preemptive security against threats before they affect a business.[1] Founded in 1994, the company was acquired by IBM in 2006.\n\nIn 1992, while attending the Georgia Institute of Technology, Christopher Klaus developed the first version of Internet Security Scanner. In 1994, Klaus founded Internet Security Systems (ISS) to further develop and market Internet Security Scanner, which later became Internet Scanner. Although the larger shareholder, Klaus took the role of chief technology officer (CTO), while Tom Noonan was recruited as chief executive officer in 1995. In 1996 David Strohm from Greylock Ventures and Bob Davoli, from Sigma Partners, led the first round of venture capital investment in ISS. In 1997, Ted Schlein from Kleiner Perkins and ATT Ventures invested in the next round. The initial public offering of the company on NASDAQ was on March 23, 1998.[2][3]\n\nFurther products in security software space followed, including Network Sensor and Server Sensor which were both developed in-house. In 1998, ISS acquired the UK company March Information Systems, and rebranded their Security Manager product as System Scanner. About the same time, ISS acquired the company DbSecure, founded by Eric Gonzales and Aaron C. Newman, to add database security to their products. The DbSecure product was rebranded as Database Scanner. Subsequently, ISS acquired Network ICE and integrated their BlackICE technology into the ISS product range.[3]\n\nIn 2004 Klaus stepped down as CTO, although he remained a significant shareholder and chief security advisor. His role as CTO was taken by Chris Rouland.[4]\n\nOn August 23, 2006, IBM announced its intention to acquire Internet Security Systems for $1.36 billion and its Japanese subsidiary, ISS KK, for additional $570M.[5] Total acquisition transaction size was $1.93 billion. On October 16, 2006, the deal was approved by ISS shareholders.[6]\n\nBy 2011, IBM accumulated more than 10 security-related startups and these, including ISS, were integrated with the security intelligence software company Q1 Labs to form the Security Systems Division.[7] The new unit was headed by Brendan Hannigan, who was Q1 Labs' previous CEO.[8]\n\nIBM has since discontinued ISS' signature product, the Proventia multifunction security appliance. This occurred after a long decline in tech support and licensing renewal service associated with the product.[9]\n\nProduct families of ISS include:[10]\n\nBlackICE\n\nInternet Scanner[11]\n\nNetwork Sensor[12]\n\nProventia\n\nRealSecure\n\nSecure Log Manager\n\nServer Sensor\n\nSite Protector\n\nSystem Scanner\n\nManaged Security Services\n\nSupported products include:\n\nEndpoint Secure Control\n\nEnterprise Scanner\n\nInternet Scanner\n\nIBM Open Signatures\n\nIBM Security Network Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)[13]\n\nProventia Desktop\n\nProventia Management SiteProtector[14]\n\nProventia Management SiteProtector Web Console\n\nProventia Network Mail Security\n\nProventia Network Multi-Function Security\n\nProventia Server Intrusion Prevention System for Linux[15]\n\nProventia Server Intrusion Prevention System for Windows\n\nProventia Web Application Security\n\nProventia Web Filter\n\nVirtual Server Protection for VMWare[16]\n\nIBM Internet Security Systems is headquartered in Sandy Springs, near Atlanta (Georgia, United States). Until late 2003 the company had significant development activities in Mountain View (California, United States), Kassel (Germany), Reading (UK) and Sydney (Australia), but all development has since been relocated to Atlanta. The company also maintains sales offices.[17]\n\nThere were many support centers.[18][19]\n\nIBM Internet Security Systems corporate website\n\narchive of technical papers and utilities for RealSecure"
