IBM Z users benefit from a high availability of their applications with over 99.99%. Compliance with service levels is simplified by a very fast recovery of the operations thanks to a special instant system restore function. Moreover, up to 500 unalterable data copies can be stored for analyzing and restoring production systems. And IBM continues to develop IBM Z further to always offer its users a state-of-the-art solution.\n\nApplication areas of the IBM® Z platform\n\nIBM Z is primarily used by msg customers in high-regulated industries such as the financial sector to ensure the continuous operation of large, sensitive and critical IT systems.
