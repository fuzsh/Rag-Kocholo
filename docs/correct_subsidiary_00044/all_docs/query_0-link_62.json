        "text": "Current state assessment\n\nIBM starts with an assessment of your current states. Using IBM diagnostic tools and Celonis for process mining, we perform an assessment through data-driven analysis and industry benchmarks – that highlights both the inhibitors and enablers within your current state systems and processes.\n\nTarget state definition\n\nNext, IBM identifies business process and system improvement opportunities in addition to transition risks. This is performed through both business measures (efficiency, quality, and cycle time) and system measures.\n\nA roadmap is outlined highlighting the best “target state” to achieve top quartile business performance, associated with quantified business benefits.\n\nScope\n\nThe IBM Cloud Impact Assessment is designed for all existing Oracle on-premises customers, including Oracle E-Business Suite, PeopleSoft, Hyperion, Siebel CRM, and JD Edwards EnterpriseOne. It focuses on all process domains across customer experience (CX), enterprise performance management (EPM), enterprise resource planning (ERP), human capital management (HCM), and supply chain management (SCM).\n\nIn addition, IBM can identify the need for Oracle infrastructure as a service (IaaS) for your business by analyzing non-Oracle workloads across multiple apps and web servers, databases, and operating systems, including mainframes.\n\nDuration\n\nThe assessment takes about four weeks for the initial assessment report and requires minimal input from your business. It requires around 10 to 16 hours of IT and business time per participant.\n\nLearn more:\n\nDownload the IBM Cloud Impact Assessment ebook\n\nWatch a video of a client’s Journey through IBM's Cloud Impact Assessment\n\nFinance transformation\n\nIBM delivers the future of finance, combining integrated processes to enable finance teams to lead enterprise digital transformation, become true business partners, improve agility across organizational boundaries, and focus on data-centric enablers to support automation.\n\nSupply chain transformation\n\nIBM delivers SCM 4.0 outcomes in order to create resilience, be more responsive and interconnected – to ecosystems and partners and to deliver sustainability by optimizing logistics networks and carbon footprints.\n\nTalent transformation\n\nIBM delivers the HR 3.0 target state turning HR into an agile consulting organization, including deeply personalized experience-centric design, data-driven decision-making powered by AI, skills placed at the core of the enterprise, and transparency to preserve trust and reduce reputational risk.\n\nCustomer transformation\n\nIBM drives transformation through the power of digital experience platforms (DXPs) to improve customer experience and loyalty, accelerate speed to market, and increase revenue and profit.\n\nHow does IBM implement the change?\n\nIBM implements through IBM RapidMove for Oracle Cloud which combines best practices with automation and assets, delivering a fast implementation while unlocking the full value through business transformation.\n\nIBM RapidMove is applied to all phases and workstreams of the implementation lifecycle resulting in typical time savings of 30%.\n\nLearn more:\n\nWatch the Cognitive Enterprise video\n\nRead the Cognitive Enterprise flyer\n\nRead the IBM RapidMove for Oracle Cloud flyer\n\nWatch the IBM RapidMove for Oracle Cloud video\n\nCognitive Enterprise for Oracle Cloud (by industry)\n\nIBM’s preconfigured Oracle SaaS platform delivers industry-tailored solutions that recognize the differentiation within your business segment.
