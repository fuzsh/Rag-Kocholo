        "text": "It’s been a while since I put together one of these “In Their Own Words” interviews, and this one breaks tradition in some ways. The previous interviews have focused on founders and CEOs, but this time I am diving in to learn more about Brendan Hannigan, a general manager with IBM Security Systems.\n\nWhat’s the catch? Well, Hannigan was a CEO, and brings that same perspective to the table. The reason Brendan is with IBM now is that Big Blue bought his security intelligence firm, Q1 Labs, in 2011.\n\nAbout IBM Security Systems\n\nWhen IBM acquired Q1 Labs, it asked Hannigan to lead a new division dedicated to helping clients address security challenges. According to Gartner, that division has established itself as the third largest security software company, and IDC lists Hannigan’s group as a world leader in security services.\n\nHannigan explained the vision for IBM Security Services to me. “IBM's technology and services vision can be summed up in two words: security intelligence. IBM delivers a broad portfolio of products that aim to provide remarkable insight into all aspects of a business’s activity so that unusual activity is detected and loss prevented. We are also delivering the necessary services to help customers assess their security posture, and build/operate their protections.”\n\nI asked Hannigan if—or how—this vision reflects the mission he started out with at Q1 Labs. He told me that Q1 was built around the idea of security intelligence. “I'm an Irish guy and there are lots of castles dotting the landscape – their walled defenses are nice tourist attractions but militarily irrelevant. Our ideas are based on the simple realization that the perimeter protection paradigm that companies have relied on doesn't work in a world where the bad actors are so sophisticated. Built upon a foundation of intelligence, we must bring security closer to the data, person and transaction.”\n\nThat actually was a core element of the inspiration for Q1 Labs. “Great innovations often come from simple ideas. In the case of Q1 Labs, the initial seed was planted when our founders were working at a university that was hacked and all the perimeter protections could not help them understand what had happened.”\n\nThe scope of IBM security acquisitions positions IBM Security Services to deliver a comprehensive range of security services. In addition to Q1 Labs, IBM has also recently acquired Trusteer that specializes in malware and fraud intelligence; CyberTap that specializes in network intelligence; Lighthouse and CrossIdeas that specialize in identity intelligence.\n\nAll of this meshes nicely together to give Hannigan the confidence that his group can do it better than competitors, and provide a unique value proposition for customers. “I think we have a nice convergence at IBM of the right strategy (security intelligence) with the right backing—and that doesn’t happen often in our market. IBM has immense resources and capital that it can apply to big problems our clients are facing. IBM has decided that security is one of those big problems.”\n\nGetting to Know Brendan Hannigan\n\nAs a teenager, Hannigan intended to be a scientist, but got derailed by reality. “When I got to college I realized how hard chemistry is. Thank goodness, my university mandated all science kids to take computer programming in their first year. I became addicted to FORTRAN programming on a VAX. I could not get to computer science as my major fast enough.”\n\nThat makes even more sense when you consider that Brendan’s biggest idol—or obsession as he puts it—growing up was the Six Million Dollar Man. Perhaps there was some foreshadowing there that his real interests lied somewhere at the crossroads between science, technology, and security.\n\nAfter graduating from University College Dublin in Ireland with a degree in computer science, Hannigan worked for a few years writing terminal server and routing code for Digital Equipment Corporation. He had an itch to get involved in the US tech market, though, so he relocated to Boston and worked for a number of years for Motorola and Wellfleet Communications. After bouncing around a bit more, he eventually took on the role as CEO of Q1 Labs until it was acquired by IBM in 2011.\n\nBrendan told me he prefers to be engaged in diverse platforms and ecosystems. That’s why he uses a Windows laptop, an iPad, and an Android smartphone. He told me that he find he is using the laptop less and less, though, in favor of the iPad. “This is a beautiful product. IBM really has excellent collaboration tools for the iPad which allows me to access everything I need securely for work. IBM supports BYOD very nicely too. I also use it for all my personal apps and reading.”\n\nHe side-stepped my question about Star Wars vs. Star Trek by choosing neither. He prefers Dr. Who. His favorite band is U2, and his favorite sport is golf. His love of golf and his Irish heritage combine in his favorite athlete—professional golfer Rory McIlroy.\n\nHannigan believes that GPS navigation is the single greatest invention in his lifetime. He hates to ask for directions, so GPS comes in handy. He says that the hardest thing he has done in his life was to leave his large family in Ireland to pursue his dreams in the United States.\n\nI asked Brendan to name two companies he would want to work for if he wasn’t working with IBM. “SpaceX or iRobot. Rockets and robots, what could be more fun than that?”\n\nThe Future of IBM Security Systems\n\nThe team is a crucial element of success according to Brendan. “I believe there are three elements of success. Firstly, a vision and a big idea. Secondly, an amazing team. Any new innovation or big idea will have many false starts and major hurdles to overcome. These challenges are impossible to foresee. An incredible team that has bought into a shared vision, will always find a way, always. The final element is to have a good handle on your business to know where you are. If you have a grand vision, a spectacular team and you know where you are, there is nothing that cannot be accomplished.”\n\nWhere will we be five years from now? Brendan believes that cloud computing will dominate the underpinnings of the technology world. He suggests that new applications will be developed in the cloud, for the cloud, and that businesses will follow the consumer trend to embrace mobile platforms as a primary means of engaging employees and customers.\n\n“The most exciting changes in the world of technology will occur in other industries as the combination of cloud, mobile and ubiquitous connectivity enables amazing technology to be built into countless products,” proclaimed Hannigan. “There will be an explosion of innovation in every industry as technology infuses everything and products we cannot dream of today are imagined and delivered at lightning speed by people in those industries. Naturally, security will continue to be important but in a totally different manner than today—and that’s an opportunity.”\n\nWhere does Hannigan think IBM Security Services fits into that vision? He boldly predicted that IBM will be the number one provider of enterprise security five years from now.\n\nThe biggest obstacle to reaching that goal according to Hannigan is available skills. “We have the ideas and the resources. To achieve our goals we must attract and retain amazing skills at scale.”\n\nBrendan has some words of wisdom for other would-be entrepreneurs. “Make your idea big and put the right team together. A bet on the right people will pay off.”"
