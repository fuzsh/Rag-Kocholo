        "text": "Consumers and regulators are more focused than ever on companies’ data privacy and security practices. There has been a surge in government investigations, enforcement actions, class action lawsuits, and mass arbitration campaigns, challenging those practices under existing laws, and that surge will continue with the passage of new laws, such as California’s Privacy Rights Act (CPRA), Washington’s My Health My Data Act, state biometrics statutes (similar to Illinois’s Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA)) adopted in California, Texas, Washington, and New York City and being considered in other jurisdictions. These laws regulate what personal and biometric information companies can maintain and how it can be gathered, stored, and protected.\n\nOur market-leading Data Privacy and Security Practice is your solution for data privacy and security challenges. The Practice has received numerous awards, including Law360’s 2024 Practice Group of the Year. The Practice co-chair was Law360’s 2024 “MVP” for Cybersecurity and Privacy Litigation, recognized by Legal 500 as one of the top lawyers in the United States for Cyber Law (Data Privacy and Data Protection), and recognized by the Daily Journal as one of the nation’s “Leading Commercial Litigators” for the results achieved by our Data Privacy and Security team.\n\nWe represent some of the world’s largest companies—in a broad array of industries including technology, mobile app development, digital advertising, telecommunications, finance, healthcare, media and insurance—in investigations and lawsuits challenging the collection, use, storage, profiting from, and/or dissemination of customer and user data. Our Data Privacy and Security litigators’ in-depth understanding of this fast-changing area of the law, combined with Quinn Emanuel’s unrivaled litigation prowess and global scope, makes us uniquely positioned to handle these matters. Clients hire us to handle their most difficult and cutting edge Data Privacy and Security cases when substantial penalties or damages are on the line. We are particularly adept at procedurally and strategically complex privacy matters—for example, when plaintiffs firms pursue mass arbitration, or class or mass actions on behalf of users who consented to arbitration.\n\nWe also advise clients seeking to use their data to enhance the customer experience and develop new business opportunities minimize litigation risk and maintain compliance with recently-enacted privacy legislation, such as the CPRA and biometric information privacy laws.\n\nOur Data Privacy and Security lawyers include former government officials who bring a unique perspective to these cases, particularly when dealing with state and federal agencies. One of our partners, for example, served as the Executive Deputy Attorney General of the Economic Justice Division in the New York Attorney General’s office and supervised every data privacy and security investigation and enforcement action for New York State. Another of our partners recently served as Deputy Chief of Staff of the SEC, where he was responsible for assisting the SEC Chair in developing the agency’s policies on cybersecurity disclosure and data protection for registered entities and public companies, and was involved in both inter-agency and public-private efforts to plan for and coordinate responses to cybersecurity events. Another of our partners was formerly the head of the SEC’s Asset Management Unit, during which time she (among other things) contributed to the SEC’s proposed rule regarding cybersecurity for asset managers.\n\nOur Data Privacy and Security lawyers are located in the United States, Europe, Asia and Australia, and we regularly coordinate in order to stay abreast of data privacy and security laws that affect our international clients in multiple jurisdictions.\n\nWith respect to Data Security in particular, we have successfully represented numerous companies faced with data security breaches. We understand that threats to your cyber security can create significant operational and legal problems. They require an aggressive, fast-paced, multi-disciplinary plan to control and even prevent potential damage. Quinn Emanuel can work with you to design such a plan—one you can activate immediately in the event of a breach. We can work with you to update your current strategy or rapidly design and implement an entirely new plan if you do not already have one in place.\n\nWe can quickly activate an experienced team that will address all aspects of the matter that are likely to arise, including regulatory, state, and federal government investigations, class actions, and public relations. We have nationally recognized experts in each of these fields who can help your company navigate the thicket of issues that accompany a data security incident. We have nine offices in the U.S. and thirteen more located in Europe, Asia, and Australia. Thus, we have the resources in place, poised to act on a moment’s notice, no matter when or where the incident occurs.\n\nAs soon as a security breach becomes public or customers receive notice, multiple class actions are filed and continue to be filed over the succeeding weeks and even months. These suits are now commonly filed within hours of an event being public. Such suits are faring better in courts. In addition, a wide array of regulators commence their own investigations. Quinn Emanuel’s experience with these cases, and its preceding reputation as a litigation powerhouse, gives our clients an edge in disposing of these cases as quickly as possible."
