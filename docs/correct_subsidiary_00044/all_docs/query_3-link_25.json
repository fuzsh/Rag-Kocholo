        "text": "IBM Corp. announced plans today to acquire Cambridge, Mass. based Resilient Systems, Inc., a privately held cybersecurity firm with 100 employees.\n\nResilient specializes in incident response, which helps IT security teams bolster their defenses against data breaches. The Resilient incident response platform is deployed in more than 100 of the Fortune 500 corporations - which is IBM's sweet spot.\n\n\"We are thrilled with our plans to have the Resilient team join IBM Security\" said Marc van Zadelhoff, general manager, IBM Security. \"The Resilient team includes some of the best security talent in the industry, along with leading products that enable clients to automate and consistently manage all aspects of responding to a security incident.\"\n\nBruce Schneier, Chief Technology Officer at Resilient, is an internationally renowned security expert, cryptographer, and author of numerous books covering security. With Schneier, IBM Security adds one of the top minds in cyber to its team.\n\nAs part of today's announcement, IBM Security also launched the new IBM X-Force Incident Response Services, further expanding IBM’s capabilities by helping clients plan for, manage and respond to cyber attacks, tapping the knowledge of 3,000 consultants and security researchers globally.\n\nWith the Resilient technology and its new X-Force team, IBM Security brings security analytics, forensics and vulnerability management along with incident response into a coordinated approach for enterprise threat protection, detection and response. The Resilient customer base should be a good starting point for rolling out the new strategy.\n\nIBM Security is on an upward trajectory after posting $2 billion in revenues and hiring 1,000 employees in 2015. \"We are excited to be joining IBM Security, the industry's fastest-growing enterprise security company,” said John Bruce, Resilient Systems Co-Founder and CEO.\n\nThe incident response market is dotted with many small niche players who are focused exclusively on planning for and managing data breaches at corporations and governments. Dario Forte, CEO at DFLabs, a leading incident response provider based in Crema, Italy, says that chief information security officers (CISOs) appreciate working with smaller firms who are very customer and quality oriented. While that may be true, DFlabs and other experienced incident response firms may also be on the short list of potential acquisitions for other security industry consolidators.\n\nIBM Security has not disclosed terms of the Resilient Systems deal.\n\nVisit SteveOnCyber.com to read all of my blogs and articles covering cybersecurity."
