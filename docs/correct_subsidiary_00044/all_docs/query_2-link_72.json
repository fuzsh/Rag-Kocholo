Vuzix's high-resolution Video Eyewear Family of consumer products solves the main challenge in viewing video and digital information via portable and mobile devices - the small screen. Vuzix iWear and Wrap Video Eyewear are worn like regular glasses and provide the effect of a big screen experience, ranging from 44” to 75”, as seen from 10 feet (~ 3m). They are ideal for use with media players, portable DVD players, gaming consoles, and mobile phones.

Vuzix is a leading name in Virtual Reality (VR), immersing users in computer-generated worlds. Vuzix VR eyewear enables users to view the world outside their flight simulation cockpit and look around like sitting in the real plane. Look down and to the left to see your landing approach and your view changes automatically. VR software and Vuzix VR eyewear are used in a variety of applications ranging from game and flight simulations to medical applications such as pain and phobia management. Vuzix Augmented Reality (AR) eyewear provides a first-person view of the real world, overlaid with computer-generated data and content.

Saffron fuses the power of computing with brain-like intelligence to help organizations quickly focus on the knowledge that matters most, anticipate what will happen next, and optimize decisions based on this intelligence. Saffron's Natural Intelligence Platform mimics our brain's ability to associate people, places and things at the entity level, learn how these entities are connected to every “thing” else, and the context behind these connections. The platform ingests data from disparate sources and automatically connects the dots to illuminate the intelligence in large complex data sets. Every time new data arrives, Saffron learns its associations with existing memories to find new patterns, similarities, anomalies or sequences, revealing new information and enabling organizations to see specific events and patterns that otherwise would not have been detected. Saffron incrementally learns and adapts in real-time from new incoming data and human feedback. Saffron integrates with an organization's existing analytics architecture to not only enhance the speed and volumes at which data can be converted to actionable knowledge, but also critically improve the accuracy of results. Our customers have applied the Natural Intelligence Platform to a number of operational risk intelligence solutions and decision support, including model-free fraud detection, personalized anticipatory maintenance, country risk assessment and personalized customer experience. With the advent of the Internet of Things and the avalanche of smart devices and sensors capturing data everywhere, Saffron's Natural Intelligence platform is well poised to scale up to this massive data distribution and make every “thing” more intelligent.\n\nShow More"
