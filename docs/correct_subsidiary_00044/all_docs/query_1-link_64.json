Our projects include comprehensive drawings, a clear, detailed scope, and a thorough bill of materials.\n\nWe were looking at who could provide the best quality experience, who could we trust, and who has the reputation that stands true as we looked at things. It was a simple decision. We knew we’d not only have a partner [in Pavion] to stand up our architecture, but a long-term partner for the ongoing, day-to-day operations.\n\nWe wanted to create a best-in-class, world-class center where doctors can come learn hands on. A project never ends, and we know that if there’s a problem, there’s a powerful team [at Pavion] that can come in and execute any changes or modifications that are required.\n\nHaving a strategic partner [like Pavion] made an incredible difference for us. They helped us in making sure we were operational day one, and we have not had one hiccup, it has been flawless."
