        "text": "Explore the incredible story of IBM, a pioneer in computing. This article traces IBM’s impact on the world, from its humble beginnings to its cutting-edge work in AI and quantum computing.\n\nThe Beginning\n\nIBM is, perhaps, the best-known computer company across the globe. It began as the Computing, Tabulating & Recording Company (CTR), founded by Herman Hollerith in the late 1800s. The Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company, the forerunner to IBM, was founded on June 16, 1911. In the beginning, it was a merger of three manufacturing businesses. The company has changed ideas about how corporations should operate over the years.\n\nIBM has also contributed cultural touchstones like THINK signs, punched cards, the IBM Selectric typewriter, the IBM PC, and the Watson computer, which won the Jeopardy TV game show in 2011.\n\nIBM – International Business Machines Corporation is an American multinational technology company headquartered in Armonk, New York, with operations in over 170 countries. It produces and sells computer hardware, middleware, and software. It also provides hosting and consulting services in areas ranging from mainframe computers to nanotechnology. The research organization holds the most recent patents generated by a business in the US. IBM has given multiple inventions to the world, like the automated teller machine (ATM), floppy disk, hard disk drive, magnetic stripe card, the relational database, the SQL programming language, the UPC barcode, and dynamic random access memory (DRAM).\n\nThe Growth Story\n\nThe IBM mainframe, exemplified by the System/360, was the dominant computing platform during the 1960s and 1970s. IBM has continually shifted business operations to focus on higher-value, more profitable markets. Let’s understand IBM’s growth story and achieved milestones.\n\n1928: The Punch Card and the US Census\n\nIBM punch cards became the industry standard for 50 years, holding nearly all of the world’s available information and enabling large-scale projects like the US Census.\n\n1936: Social Security\n\nIBM worked with the government on the US Social Security Act of 1935, tabulating employment records for 26 million Americans – the largest and most significant accounting project of its time.\n\n1937: Fill in the Bubble\n\nThe IBM Type 805 International Test Scoring Machine uses the conductivity of graphite marks to sense fill-in-the-bubble test answers, saving millions of test-scoring hours.\n\n1952: The Inception of Digital Storage\n\nIBM introduced the world to digital storage via magnetic tape data, transitioning from punched-card calculators to electronic computers.\n\n1953: The First Heart-Lung Machine\n\nA heart-lung machine built by IBM enables the world’s first successful open-heart surgery on a human.

You can categorize them into multiple categories like cloud computing, artificial intelligence (AI), commerce, data and analytics, Internet of Things (IoT), IT infrastructure, mobile, digital workplace and cybersecurity.\n\nIBM Cloud consists of infrastructure as a service (IaaS), software as a service (SaaS), and platform as a service (PaaS) offered through public, private, and hybrid cloud delivery models. For example, the IBM Bluemix PaaS enables developers to quickly create a complex website on a pay-as-you-go model. IBM SoftLayer is a dedicated server managed to host and cloud computing provider, which in 2011 reported hosting more than 81,000 servers for more than 26,000 customers. IBM also provides Cloud Data Encryption Services (ICDES), using cryptographic splitting to secure customer data.\n\nIBM hosts the industry-wide cloud computing and mobile technologies conference InterConnect every year. IBM has also designed hardware for these categories, including IBM’s POWER microprocessors – which are employed inside many console gaming systems like Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, Nintendo’s Wii U.\n\nIn fact, 2014, the company revealed TrueNorth, a neuromorphic CMOS integrated circuit. It announced a USD 3 billion investment over the following five years to design a neural chip that mimics the human brain, with 10 billion neurons and 100 trillion synapses, but that uses just 1 kilowatt of power.\n\nLater, IBM developed Smarter Planet’s initiative to achieve economic growth, near-term efficiency, sustainable development, and societal progress. It targets intelligent grids, water management systems, solutions to traffic congestion, and greener buildings.\n\nAlso, IBM provides infrastructure for the New York City Police Department through their IBM Cognos Analytics to visualize CompStat crime data.\n\nAcquisition Spree\n\nIBM has gained leadership through its inventions, innovations, and acquisitions.

Low costs are possible through factors like high economies of scale. It is one of the strengths identifiable in the SWOT Analysis of IBM.\n\nFor instance, the company can minimize costs by providing cloud platform products and technology services because of its large-scale operations. As a cost leader, IBM can implement competitive pricing for these products and services. Besides, the cost leadership generic strategy supports competitive advantage through expertise in production processes and materials management.\n\nIn this case, IBM’s more than 100 years of business experience equates to expertise and high efficiencies in various processes in developing, producing, and providing information technologies and related services.\n\nFinancial Results\n\n‘We made progress in 2020 growing our hybrid cloud platform as the foundation for our clients’ digital transformations while dealing with the broader uncertainty of the macro environment’, said Arvind Krishna, IBM chairman and chief executive officer.\n\nIn the fourth quarter, the company generated net cash from operating activities of USD 5.9 billion or USD 6.8 billion, excluding Global Financing receivables. IBM’s free cash flow was USD 6.1 billion. Also, the company returned USD 1.5 billion to shareholders in dividends.\n\nFor the full year, the company generated net cash from operating activities of USD 18.2 billion or USD 13.8 billion, excluding Global Financing receivables. Net capital expenditures of USD 3 billion increased by USD 0.7 billion, primarily for cloud infrastructure. Free cash flow was USD 10.8 billion. IBM returned USD 5.8 billion to shareholders in dividends.\n\nThe company expects to grow revenue for 2021 based on the current foreign exchange rates. The company expects an adjusted free cash flow of USD 11 billion to USD 12 billion in 2021. Adjusted free cash flow excludes approximately USD 3 billion of cash impacts from the company’s structural actions initiated in the fourth quarter of 2020 and the transaction costs of separating the managed infrastructure services business."
