and\n\nComplying with laws and regulations and to comply with other legal process and law enforcement requirements (including any internal policy based on or reflecting legal or regulatory guidance, codes or opinions).\n\nHow Long We Retain Personal Information\n\nThe length of time that we intend to retain each category of Personal Information will depend on several criteria, including (i) the length of time we are required to retain Personal Information in order to comply with applicable legal and regulatory requirements, (ii) the length of time we may need to retain Personal Information in order to accomplish the business or commercial purpose(s) for which such Personal Information is collected, used or disclosed (as indicated in this Notice), and (iii) whether you choose to exercise your right, subject to certain exceptions, to request deletion of your Personal Information.\n\nSale or Sharing of Personal Information\n\nIn the 12 months preceding the date of this Notice, we have not âsoldâ or âsharedâ Personal Information or Sensitive Personal Information subject to the CCPA nor have we âsoldâ or âsharedâ Personal Information or Sensitive Personal Information of minors under the age of 16.\n\nFor purposes of this Notice:\n\nâsoldâ means the disclosure of Personal Information or Sensitive Personal Information to a third party for monetary or other valuable consideration; and\n\nâsharedâ means the disclosure of Personal Information or Sensitive Personal Information to a third party for cross-context behavioral advertising.\n\nHow We Use Sensitive Personal Information\n\nWe only use or disclose Sensitive Personal Information for the following purposes consistent with CCPA Regulations:\n\nTo perform the services or provide the goods reasonably expected by an average California resident who requests those goods or services. For example, a California resident's precise geolocation may be used by a mobile application that is providing them with directions on how to get to a specific location.\n\nTo detect security incidents that compromise the availability, authenticity, integrity, and confidentiality of stored or transmitted Personal Information, provided that the use of a California resident's Personal Information is reasonably necessary and proportionate for this purpose. For example, we may disclose a California resident's log-in information to a data security company that it has hired to investigate and remediate a data breach that involved that individual's account.\n\nTo resist malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal actions directed at the business and to prosecute those responsible for those actions, provided that the use of a California resident's Personal Information is reasonably necessary and proportionate for this purpose. For example, we may use information about a California resident's ethnicity and/or the contents of email and text messages to investigate claims of racial discrimination or hate speech.\n\nTo ensure the physical safety of natural persons, provided that the use of a California resident's Personal Information is reasonably necessary and proportionate for this purpose. For example, we may disclose a California resident's geolocation information to law enforcement to investigate an alleged kidnapping.\n\nFor short-term, transient use, including, but not limited to, nonpersonalized advertising shown as part of a California resident's current interaction with us.\n\nTo perform services such as maintaining or servicing accounts, providing customer service, processing or fulfilling orders and transactions, verifying a California resident's information, processing payments, providing financing, providing analytic services, providing storage.\n\nTo verify or maintain the quality or safety of a service or device that is owned, manufactured, manufactured for, or controlled by us, and to improve, upgrade, or enhance the service or device that is owned, manufactured by, manufactured for, or controlled by us.\n\nRights under the CCPA\n\nIf you are a California resident covered by the CCPA, you have the right to:\n\n(1) Receive this Notice at or before the point of collection of your Personal Information.\n\n(2) Request we disclose to you free of charge the following information covering the 12 months preceding your request:\n\na. the categories of Personal Information about you that we collected;\n\nb. the categories of sources from which the Personal Information was collected;\n\nc. the purpose for collecting Personal Information about you;\n\nd. the categories of third parties to whom we disclosed Personal Information about you and the categories of Personal Information that were disclosed (if applicable) and the purpose for disclosing the Personal Information about you; and\n\ne. the specific pieces of Personal Information we collected about you;\n\n(3) Request we correct inaccurate Personal Information that we maintain about you.\n\n(4) Request we delete Personal Information we collected from you, unless the CCPA recognizes an exception.\n\n(5) Be free from unlawful discrimination for exercising your rights under the CCPA.\n\nPlease see the section below entitled, âHow to Exercise Your Rights,â for instructions explaining how you can exercise these rights described above.\n\nRequests for specific pieces of Personal Information will require additional information to verify your identity.\n\nFor individuals submitting a request on behalf of another person, we may require proof of authorization and verification of identity directly from the person for whom the request is made.\n\nFor a company or organization submitting a request on behalf of another person, we may require proof of authorization from the individual such as a Power of Attorney and verification of identity directly from the person for whom the request is made.\n\nIn some instances, we may not be able to honor your request. For example, we will not honor your request if we cannot verify your identity or if we cannot verify that you have the authority to make a request on behalf of another individual. Additionally, we will not honor your request where an exception applies, such as where the disclosure of Personal Information would adversely affect the rights and freedoms of another California resident or where the Personal Information that we maintain about you is not subject to the CCPA's access or deletion rights.\n\nWe will advise you in our response if we are not able to honor your request. We will not provide Social Security numbers, driver's license numbers or government-issued identification numbers, financial account numbers, unique biometric data, health care or medical identification numbers, account passwords or security questions and answers, or any specific pieces of information if the disclosure presents the possibility of unauthorized access that could result in identity theft or fraud or unreasonable risk to data or systems and network security.\n\nWe will work to process all verified requests within 45 days pursuant to the CCPA. If we need an extension for up to an additional 45 days in order to process your request, we will provide you with an explanation for the delay.\n\nHow We Process Opt-Out Preferences\n\nBank of America permits California residents to automatically exercise their right to opt-out of sale/sharing through opt-out preference signals without having to make individualized opt-out requests. Bank of America treats opt-out preference signals as valid requests to opt-out of sale/sharing for the browser.
