        "text": "Over the last six years, the global cost of cybercrime increased by 1,237%.¹ As the rate and impact of cybercrime steadily increases, so does the complexity of the tactics used by cyber criminals. The frequency of cybercrimes is now so common, people and organizations have become desensitized to the impact. Adversaries have long held the advantage in cyberspace. Designing an attack takes minutes, while defending takes much longer. This forces organizations to play an asymmetric battle for control of their data. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is closing the gap between cyber criminals and organizations, which has existed for years in a traditional perimeter-based security approach. The playing field is becoming more balanced as organizations continue to implement AI across their security environments.\n\nAI empowers organizations to capitalize on all available data to drive near real-time decision-making to monitor, detect, analyze and react to cyber threats. By leveraging large language models, coupled with machine learning, AI can detect anomalies in behavior—improving threat detection and response time. Additionally, AI improves an organization’s understanding of the threat landscape and reduces cyber criminals’ attack surface.\n\nThe growing demand for AI across all facets of an organization is a powerful story, but that story is only as valuable as the data used to write it. Protecting data is at the core of Zero Trust. By adopting Zero Trust principles, organizations can capitalize on all the benefits AI offers while ensuring data quality.\n\nAnnounced at Dell Technologies World 2023, Project Fort Zero (PFZ) provides an end-to-end greenfield solution with ready-to-use capabilities. Adhering to the guidelines provided in the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) Zero Trust Reference Architecture (ZTRA), PFZ simplifies and accelerates the adoption of Zero Trust. PFZ is designed in alignment with the U.S. DoD ZTRA to provide advanced-level Zero Trust capability, with a best-in-class vendor ecosystem. The PFZ solution applies all 45 capabilities and 152 activities of the U.S. DoD ZTRA into a sovereign on-premises enterprise private cloud. The U.S. DoD is scheduled to assess PFZ’s adherence to the advanced-level requirements outlined during the summer of 2024.\n\nClick here to learn more about Project Fort Zero and the intersection of Zero Trust and AI. I will be hosting a session at Dell Technologies World on A Zero Trust checklist for your business, and how Project Fort Zero delivers. If you’re attending and would like to meet with the Project Fort Zero team, please reach out here."
