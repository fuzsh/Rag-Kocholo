        "text": "Turning Big Blue Elephant into a Horse\n\nIn 2021, IBM divested its ~ $18B worth of Global Technology Services (GTS) division under the new brand name Kyndryl, which mainly delivered managed infrastructure services to its more than 4,000 customers.\n\nThe idea behind divesting Kyndryl‚Äôs business from IBM was to focus on its software and consulting business and go after a $1 Trillion Hybrid Cloud and AI opportunity to achieve growth, which was seeing drag due to its services business. RedHat acquisition in 2018 sits right at the centre of this strategy. RedHat‚Äôs OpenShift acquisition expanded IBM‚Äôs cloud capabilities to help clients run their workloads across the on-premises, private, public, and multi-cloud environments, committing to support fundamental tenets of Opensource technologies - flexibility, freedom, and choice. In FY22, 100% of Fortune Global 500 companies rely on RedHat.\n\nPer IBM‚Äôs annual report, in FY22, it witnessed 5.5% revenue growth touching $60.5 billion with $9.3 billion of free cash flow. Software segment revenue saw 6.9% growth (led by Hybrid platform and solutions; double-digit solid growth for RedHat), Consulting segment revenue saw 7.1% growth (led by digital transformation), and Infrastructure segment revenue saw 7.8% growth (led by double-digit growth through their z16 program).\n\nOn Nov 4, 2021, Arvind Krishna, Chairman and CEO, of IBM, said in an open letter that ‚ÄúOur goal is to break down today‚Äôs most common barriers to innovation: closed systems, proprietary technologies, untrustworthy AI, and insufficient security.‚Äù This statement indicates that IBM focuses more than ever on the cybersecurity market and taps into its automation and AI (through Watson) expertise to drive a proactive approach towards cyber threats and reduce human error.\n\nIBM Security would have been of high interest for both IBM and Kyndryl to protect their customer‚Äôs hybrid cloud environments, infrastructure, and data.\n\nIBM Security - MSSP Business is Conflict of Interest\n\nIBM Security is part of IBM‚Äôs Software division, which also entails a Hybrid Cloud Platform, Data and AI, and Automation. IBM Security focuses on Zero Trust (ZT) framework to help enterprises become risk aware, gather real-time visibility and analysis into the threat landscape, and respond automatically to threats across expanding attack surfaces. IBM Security includes security software and security services (MSSP business) for threat management, data security, identity, and access management (IAM), and SecOps.\n\nThrough multiple acquisitions, IBM is continuously modernizing and expanding its security software portfolio to stay competitive in the ever-evolving cybersecurity space. According to various secondary research sources, the global XDR software market is expected to grow at a CAGR of ~20% till 2028. In the past three years, IBM has acquired four security software companies, of which two companies have expanded its QRadar XDR (extended detection and response) solution.\n\nOverall IBM Security is worth more than $3 billion business globally, with more than 8,000 cybersecurity professionals spread globally. IBM Security has 7 global delivery locations with regional SoCs in 5 locations. To expand its cybersecurity operations, in 2022, IBM established a new cybersecurity hub in India (first in Boston), which includes a cyber range, an operational command centre, and development security to cater to the growing cybersecurity demand from the APAC region. IBM is already working on quantum computing security, considering their long-standing contribution to Quantum computing development since 2015.\n\nIn FY22, the IBM Security (software + MSSP) business witnessed 2.2% growth globally (which indicates a slowdown at IBM Security compared to the 6.8% growth witnessed in 2021 post-Kyndryl spin-off) for its threat management and identity software solutions (while data security showed poor growth), indicating the shrinking business where the global and regional markets for the security software and services (advisory, implementation, and managed services) market are growing at a double-digit growth rate.\n\nThe slowdown in IBM Security growth can be attributed to the conflicting business models ‚Äì Software and MSSP under the single roof of IBM Security (despite spinning off their managed services business as ‚ÄúKyndryl‚Äù and keeping MSSP business with itself). Having said that, even after spinning off its managed infrastructure services business, IBM remained in the shackles by keeping the security services business (despite the growth MSSP market is experiencing), which would impact its overall growth.\n\nThe IBM Security software team leverages the IBM MSSP team to consult, sell, implement, and support the security solutions like Verify Access, QRadar product line, etc. In contrast, the IBM MSSP team‚Äôs value proposition lies in offering best-in-class security solutions and threat insights from its broad partner ecosystem (which includes IBM Security Software üòä; IBM X-force offers threat intelligence services to the IBM MSSP). Enterprise customers evaluating security solutions may be less inclined to engage with the IBM Security MSSP team, especially where IBM Security solutions are part of the evaluation. Customers may not receive unbiased advice and can get enticed by bundled offerings, discounted pricing, and many more sales tactics to drive IBM Security software sales.\n\nDuring Kyndryl spin-off, IBM always kept ambiguity around divesting its security services business. Eventually, IBM kept security services business with itself considering the opportunity within managed security services industry (growing at double-digit growth).\n\nKyndryl‚Äôs first acquisition - its Own parent's business (MSSP division)\n\nIn my humble opinion, as Kyndryl is slowly expanding its managed security services portfolio and establishing SoCs to cater to its clients, it would be best bet for them to acquire IBM‚Äôs Security services business. IBM Security services division will return to its rightful owner and IBM can continue to focus on ‚Äúsoftware‚Äù where they really wanted to restart their accelerated journey.\n\nDISCLAIMER: Opinions expressed are solely my own and do not express the views or opinions of my current or previous employer.\n\nPlease feel free to share your thoughts."
