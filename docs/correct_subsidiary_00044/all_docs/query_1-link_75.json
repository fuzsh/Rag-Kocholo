Gillis, Technical Writer and Editor\n\nLinda Rosencrance\n\nSecurity information and event management (SIEM) is an approach to security management that combines security information management (SIM) and security event management (SEM) functions into one security management system. The acronym SIEM is pronounced \"sim\" with a silent e.\n\nThe underlying principles of every SIEM system are to aggregate relevant data from multiple sources, identify deviations from the norm and take appropriate action. For example, when a potential issue is detected, a SIEM system might log additional information, generate an alert and instruct other security controls to stop an activity's progress.\n\nPayment Card Industry Data Security Standard compliance originally drove SIEM adoption in large enterprises, but concerns over advanced persistent threats have led smaller organizations to look at the benefits SIEM tools can offer as well. Being able to look at all security-related data from a single point of view makes it easier for organizations of all sizes to spot unusual patterns.\n\nAt the most basic level, a SIEM system can be rules-based or employ a statistical correlation engine to make connections between event log entries. Advanced SIEM systems have evolved to include user and entity behavior analytics, as well as security orchestration, automation and response (SOAR).\n\nSIEM systems work by deploying multiple collection agents in a hierarchical manner to gather security-related events from end-user devices, servers and network equipment, as well as specialized security equipment, such as firewalls, antivirus programs or intrusion prevention systems (IPSes). The collectors forward events to a centralized management console, where security analysts sift through the noise, connecting the dots and prioritizing security incidents.\n\nIn some systems, pre-processing can happen at edge collectors, with only certain events being passed through to a centralized management node. In this way, the volume of information being communicated and stored can be reduced. Although advancements in machine learning are helping systems flag anomalies more accurately, analysts must still provide feedback, continuously educating the system about the environment.\n\nHow does SIEM work?\n\nSIEM tools gather event and log data created by host systems throughout a company's infrastructure and bring that data together on a centralized platform. Host systems include applications, security devices, antivirus filters and firewalls. SIEM tools identify and sort the data into categories such as successful and failed logins, malware activity and other likely malicious activity.\n\nThe SIEM software generates security alerts when it identifies potential security issues. Using a set of predefined rules, organizations can set these alerts as a low or high priority.\n\nFor instance, a user account that generates 25 failed login attempts in 25 minutes could be flagged as suspicious but still be set at a lower priority because the login attempts were probably made by a user who had forgotten their login information.\n\nHowever, a user account that generates 130 failed login attempts in five minutes would be flagged as a high-priority event because it's most likely a brute-force attack in progress.\n\nWhy is SIEM important?\n\nSIEM makes it easier for enterprises to manage security by filtering massive amounts of security data and prioritizing the security alerts the software generates.\n\nSIEM software enables organizations to detect incidents that may otherwise go undetected. The software analyzes the log entries to identify signs of malicious activity. In addition, since the system gathers events from different sources across the network, it can re-create the timeline of an attack, enabling an organization to determine the nature of the attack and its effect on the business.\n\nA SIEM system can also help an organization meet compliance requirements by automatically generating reports that include all the logged security events among these sources. Without SIEM software, the company would have to gather log data and compile the reports manually.\n\nA SIEM system also enhances incident management by helping the company's security team to uncover the route an attack takes across the network, identify the sources that were compromised and provide the automated tools to prevent the attacks in progress.\n\nBenefits of SIEM\n\nBenefits of SIEM include the following:\n\nIt shortens the time it takes to identify threats significantly, minimizing the damage from those threats.\n\nSIEM offers a holistic view of an organization's information security environment, making it easier to gather and analyze security information to keep systems safe. All an organization's data goes into a centralized repository where it's stored and easily accessible.\n\nCompanies can use SIEM for a variety of use cases that revolve around data or logs, including security programs, audit and compliance reporting, help desk and network troubleshooting.\n\nSIEM supports large amounts of data so organizations can continue to scale out and add more data.\n\nSIEM provides threat detection and security alerts.\n\nIt can perform detailed forensic analysis in the event of major security breaches.\n\nLimitations of SIEM\n\nDespite its benefits, SIEM also has the following limitations:\n\nIt can take a long time to implement SIEM because it requires support to ensure successful integration with an organization's security controls and the many hosts in its infrastructure. It typically takes 90 days or more to install SIEM before it starts to work.\n\nIt's expensive. The initial investment in SIEM can be in the hundreds of thousands of dollars. And the associated costs can add up, including the costs of personnel to manage and monitor a SIEM implementation, annual support and software or agents to collect data.\n\nAnalyzing, configuring and integrating reports require the talent of experts. That's why some SIEM systems are managed directly within a security operations center, a centralized unit staffed by an information security team that deals with an organization's security issues.\n\nSIEM tools usually depend on rules to analyze all the recorded data. The problem is that a company's network could generate thousands of alerts per day. It's difficult to identify potential attacks because of the number of irrelevant logs.\n\nA misconfigured SIEM tool might miss important security events, making information risk management less effective.\n\nSIEM features and capabilities\n\nImportant features to consider when evaluating SIEM products include the following:\n\nData aggregation. Data is collected and monitored from applications, networks, servers and databases.\n\nCorrelation. Typically a part of SEM in a SIEM tool, correlation refers to the tool finding similar attributes between different events.\n\nDashboards. Data is collected and aggregated from applications, databases, networks and servers and is displayed in charts to help find patterns and to avoid missing critical events.\n\nAlerting. If a security incident is detected, SIEM tools can notify users.\n\nAutomation. Some SIEM software might also include automated functions, such as automated security incident analysis and automated incident responses.\n\nUsers should also ask the following questions about SIEM product capabilities:\n\nIntegration with other controls. Can the system give commands to other enterprise security controls to prevent or stop attacks in progress?\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI). Can the system improve its own accuracy through machine learning and deep learning?\n\nThreat intelligence feeds. Can the system support threat intelligence feeds of the organization's choosing, or is it mandated to use a particular feed?\n\nExtensive compliance reporting. Does the system include built-in reports for common compliance needs and provide the organization with the ability to customize or create new compliance reports?\n\nForensic capabilities. Can the system capture additional information about security events by recording the headers and contents of packets of interest?\n\nSIEM tools and software\n\nThere are a wide variety of SIEM tools on market, but the following is just a sample:\n\nSplunk. Splunk is an on-premises SIEM system that supports security monitoring and offers continuous security monitoring, advanced threat detection, incident investigation and incident response.\n\nIBM QRadar. The IBM QRadar SIEM platform provides security monitoring for IT infrastructures. It features log data collection, threat detection and event correlation.\n\nLogRhythm. LogRhythm is a SIEM system for smaller organizations. It unifies Log Management, network monitoring and endpoint monitoring, as well as forensics and security analytics.\n\nExabeam. Exabeam Inc.'s SIEM portfolio offers a data lake, advanced analytics and a threat hunter.\n\nNetWitness. The RSA NetWitness platform is a threat detection and response tool that includes data acquisition, forwarding, storage and analysis.\n\nDatadog Cloud SIEM. Datadog Cloud SIEM from Datadog Security is a cloud-native network and management system. The tool features both real-time security monitoring and log management.\n\nLog360. The Log360 SIEM tool offers threat intelligence, incident management and SOAR features. Log collection, analysis, correlation, alerting and archiving features are available in real time.\n\nSolarWinds Security Event Manager. The SolarWinds Security Event Manager SIEM tool automatically detects threats, monitors security policies and protects networks. The tool offers features such as integrity monitoring, compliance reporting and centralized log collection.\n\nHow to choose the right SIEM product\n\nThe key to selecting the right SIEM tool varies depending on a number of factors, including an organization's budget and security posture. However, companies should look for SIEM tools that offer the following capabilities:\n\ncompliance reporting;\n\nincident response and forensics;\n\ndatabase and server access monitoring;\n\ninternal and external threat detection;\n\nreal-time threat monitoring, correlation and analysis across a variety of applications and systems;\n\nan intrusion detection system, IPS, firewall, event application log, and other application and system integrations;\n\nthreat intelligence; and\n\nuser activity monitoring.\n\nBest practices to implementing SIEM\n\nFollow these best practices while implementing SIEM:\n\nSet understandable goals. The SIEM tool should be chosen and implemented based on security goals, compliance and the potential threat landscape of the organization.\n\nApply data correlation rules. Data correlation rules should be implemented across all systems, networks and cloud deployments so data with errors in it can be more easily found.\n\nIdentify compliance requirements. This helps ensure the chosen SIEM software is configured to audit and report on correct compliance standards.\n\nList digital assets. Listing all digitally stored data across an IT infrastructure aids in managing log data and monitoring network activity.\n\nRecord incident response plans and workflows. This helps ensure teams can respond to security incidents rapidly.\n\nAssign a SIEM administrator. A SIEM administrator ensures the proper maintenance of a SIEM implementation.\n\nHistory of SIEM\n\nSIEM technology, which has existed since the mid-2000s, initially evolved from log management, which is the collective processes and policies used to administer the generation, transmission, analysis, storage, archiving and disposal of large volumes of log data created within an information system.\n\nGartner Inc. analysts coined the term SIEM in the 2005 Gartner report, \"Improve IT Security with Vulnerability Management.\" In the report, the analysts proposed a new security information system based on SIM and SEM.\n\nBuilt on legacy log collection management systems, SIM introduced long-term storage analysis and reporting on log data. SIM also integrated logs with threat intelligence. SEM addressed identifying, collecting, monitoring and reporting security-related events in software, systems or IT infrastructure.\n\nVendors created SIEM by combining SEM, which analyzes log and event data in real time, providing threat monitoring, event correlation and incident response, with SIM, which collects, analyzes and reports on log data.\n\nSIEM is now a more comprehensive and advanced tool. New tools were introduced for reducing risk in an organization, such as the use of machine learning and AI to help systems flag anomalies accurately. Eventually, SIEM products with these advanced features started being called next-generation SIEM.\n\nThe future of SIEM\n\nFuture SIEM trends include the following:\n\nImproved orchestration. Currently, SIEM only provides companies with basic workflow automation. However, as these organizations continue to grow, SIEM must offer additional capabilities. For example, with AI and machine learning, SIEM tools must offer faster orchestration to provide the different departments within a company the same level of protection. Additionally, the security protocols and the execution of those protocols will be faster, more effective and more efficient.\n\nBetter collaboration with managed detection and response (MDR) tools. As threats of hacking and unauthorized access continue to increase, it's important that organizations implement a two-tier approach to detect and analyze security threats. A company's IT team can implement SIEM in-house, while a managed service provider can implement the MDR tool.\n\nEnhanced cloud management and monitoring. SIEM vendors will improve the cloud management and monitoring capabilities of their tools to better meet the security needs of organizations that use the cloud.\n\nSIEM and SOAR will evolve into one tool. Look for traditional SIEM products to take on the benefits of SOAR; however, SOAR vendors will likely respond by expanding the capabilities of their products.\n\nAccording to a recent Forbes article, the future of SIEM may involve the following five possible outcomes:\n\nUsage-based pricing models for SIEM will become common.\n\nAnalysis tools will be built on universal SIEM data platforms.\n\nOrganizations will partner to provide more integrations.\n\nThe cost of SIEM will drop, making SIEM more affordable for smaller security teams.\n\nStartups will address more of the multifaceted challenges of managing security.\n\nLearn more about SIEM products, including product architectures and the cost of adopting, deploying and managing SIEM systems.\n\nContinue Reading About What is security information and event management (SIEM)?\n\nA comprehensive guide to SIEM products\n\nSOAR vs. SIEM: What's the difference?\n\nHow to get the most out of your SIEM system\n\nHow cloud-based SIEM tools benefit SOC teams\n\nHow can SIEM and SOAR software work together?\n\nRelated Terms\n\ncyber attack\n\nA cyber attack is any malicious attempt to gain unauthorized access to a computer, computing system or computer network with the ...
