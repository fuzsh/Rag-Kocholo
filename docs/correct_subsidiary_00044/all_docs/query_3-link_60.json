        "text": "For Kyndryl CIO Michael Bradshaw, the clock started ticking in November 2021 when the former managed infrastructure services division of IBM was spun out as a separate entity and given two years to disentangle its IT systems from IBM’s.\n\n“We had a 24-month transition services agreement,” he says.\n\nWith that deadline came a dilemma: “Do we just focus on transition, then start thinking about what transformation looks like,” he says, “or do we use this as an opportunity and compress the cycle to drive transition and transformation, using the platforms as the driver for that.”\n\nWith the rest of the Kyndryl leadership team, Bradshaw opted for the latter.\n\nAs a result, some other processes were compressed too, including the choice of the key platforms on which Kyndryl’s new infrastructure would be built.\n\n“What typically happens is, you get these long drawn-out RFP processes and all the balancing and waiting, and the reality is, it doesn’t really matter,” he says.\n\nBradshaw recounts how Kyndryl’s HR management platfrom was selected.\n\n“I sat with my CHRO in her first week on the job, and said, ‘If I asked you to choose between SuccessFactors and Workday, what would you choose?’ And she said, ‘Well, the past two jobs I’ve implemented Workday, so my answer would be Workday.’ And that was pretty much our decision.”\n\nFor the ERP, Kyndryl went with SAP, the same platform used by IBM, although it’s possible that Bradshaw’s 30 years of experience with SAP weighed as heavily as IBM’s history with it.\n\nHe defends what might at first seem like a frivolous selection process, pointing to the predictability of traditional methods and their failure to facilitate change.\n\n“We didn’t do fit-gap analysis workshops because 95% of the time, the solution looks exactly like what the teams have today,” he says. “We weren’t going to go down that path.”\n\nThat may seem odd, given that two key platform choices were dictated, at least in part, by their familiarity. But there’s more to it than that.\n\n“One vendor versus the other isn’t really that important,” Bradshaw says. “It’s about living in that platform.”\n\nIn any case, he says, only 13% of Kyndryl’s revenue flowed through those legacy SAP systems in IBM, with the rest going through custom mainframe applications. Kyndryl was not given a clone of those IBM systems as part of the transition services agreement, he says, so they had to start afresh with the SAP installation.\n\nKyndryl is now running a clean version of S/4HANA Cloud private edition on Microsoft Azure.\n\nThat’s had its advantages: “We’ve been able to leverage these platforms to do so much, more rapidly, and with much more agility than we would have if we had taken the more brownfield approach,” he says.\n\nLiving in the platform\n\nThe move to a greenfield SAP system illustrates what Bradshaw means by “living in the platform.” Rather than customize a system to fit exactly what had gone before, he wants to get the most out of a platform’s innate capabilities.\n\n“It’s what is differentiating for the business that really matters,” he says. “For those non-differentiating capabilities, you shouldn’t spend a lot of energy; you should do the base configuration and then shift the business toward the different solutions.”\n\nAnother example: Kyndryl — or the IBM business unit that eventually became Kyndryl — already used Workday before Bradshaw arrived, but only in a limited way, alongside dozens of other HR applications. “The choice to expand on Workday was to double down and make that the platform, collapsing all of those 60-plus different applications and leveraging that platform,” he says.\n\nFor some aspects of those migrations, including configuration and test management, he brought in external systems integrators: KPMG to help with Workday, and Deloitte for SAP applications such as Ariba and Fieldglass. For other aspects, such as setting up application environments in Azure, he had help from Kyndryl’s own consulting staff.\n\nOne advantage Bradshaw has that CIOs in other kinds of business don’t is he can turn learning experiences from costs into profit centers for Kyndryl if a task turns out to be something the consulting team can sell to other companies as a service.\n\n“We now have no mainframe applications,” Bradshaw says. “We’re completely running in Azure or are software-as-a-service based.”\n\nOther CIOs are moving their applications off mainframes as well, perhaps in part because they’re concerned they may not be able to find skilled employees to maintain them in the future. This can become a self-fulfilling prophecy as new IT graduates shy away from mainframes and turn to cloud technologies instead to avoid finding themselves in a career dead-end.\n\nBut Bradshaw sees a way forward for both existing mainframe experts and those learning about them today.\n\n“Folks who have a mainframe background are perfectly suited to manage hyperscaler environments and even across multiple hyperscale environments,” he says. “The core disciplines you use to run and manage a mainframe well are the same disciplines you have to exercise to manage those hyperscaler environments.”\n\nThat equivalence, however, didn’t become apparent to Bradshaw and his colleagues as early as it could have.\n\n“We could have brought more people along on that journey,” he says, a move that might have enabled Kyndryl to complete some of its application migrations sooner.\n\nThe surprise for Bradshaw was that staff were typically able to pick up the skills necessary to transfer from mainframe to hyperscaler management in four to six months, with the best making the switch in just two or three months.\n\n“I didn’t think we could go up the scale that quickly,” he says.\n\nSupport calls\n\nBradshaw has one other regret, besides overlooking the transferrable skills of his mainframe staff: not kicking off the organizational change management process sooner to better communicate the notion of living in the platform.\n\nAs it was, he communicated through the business leaders, with each of them relaying the message in a language their teams would understand. The focus was on the most important use cases, and on making the change without disrupting customers’ activities.\n\nThe process was successful in that staff knew where to go for help, he says, noting that it’s not enough to give them 20 hours of classroom training and then leave them to it: you have to give them a help line to call and let them know they’ve got support.\n\nEven if they call to say, “’I know we covered this and I feel really silly to have to ask,’” he says, “Don’t make them feel silly.”"
