Defense organizations are well advised to get ahead of the quantum-safe encryption curve, starting with understanding what data might be at risk from future threats.\n\nIBM Edge Application Manager AI and edge autonomous\n\nAct on insights closer to where data is created. How do you manage and promote security across thousands of edge servers and hundreds of thousands of edge devices cost-effectively? The answer: IBM Edge Application Manager.\n\nRed Hat Modernization\n\nAccelerating the modernization of applications for rapid cloud migration is an effective way in which defense agencies can implement digital transformation and address business imperatives. See how Red Hat’s open and flexible hybrid approach can help the DoD connect clouds, teams and processes.\n\nIBM Maximo Asset maintenance\n\nAI-based predictive maintenance solutions go beyond time-scheduled maintenance to condition-based action to predict the likelihood of future failures, improving asset reliability and enabling cost reduction."
