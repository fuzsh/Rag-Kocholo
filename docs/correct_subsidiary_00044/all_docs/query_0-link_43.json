        "text": "IBM, International Business Machines Corporation, is an American multinational technology corporation, one of the world’s largest and oldest computer and IT companies. The company has two fully-owned Israeli subsidiaries, IBM Israel Ltd., and Red Hat Israel.\n\nServices to the Israeli Population, Immigration and Borders Authority\n\nManaging the Israeli Population Registry – the Aviv and Eitan Systems\n\nIBM is the operator of the Israeli Population Registry computing system, which stores information on Palestinians living in the oPt.\n\nIn 2017, IBM was selected to design and operate the “Eitan” System for the Israeli Population, Immigration and Borders Authority’s (PIBA) Population Registry database, to gradually replace the “Aviv” System, which was previously operated and managed by HP and later by HPE and DXC Technologies.\n\nIn 2018, IBM was contracted by the Authority to develop a computerized system for the management of the national Population Registry for approximately NIS 840 million. The contract includes the integration of new technologies to expand and implement additional systems for managing the Population Registry.\n\nAccording to a response to a Freedom of Information request from May 2021 submitted by Who Profits, since 2019, IBM has been responsible for operating the Eitan System, used for managing the Population Registry, and for storing the system’s data. The system also interfaces with other government authorities.\n\nThe Israeli Population Registry includes information on non-citizens Palestinian residents of occupied East Jerusalem, Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and Gaza, and Syrians in the occupied Syrian Golan. Through this registry, the Israeli authorities control the permits required for Palestinian workers who work within Israel and in Israeli settlements, as well as permits needed for Palestinians to cross the Green Line for medical needs, family visits, travel abroad, etc., as part of Israel's repressive permit regime. Since the Oslo Accords, the Israeli Civil Administration (ICA) keeps a copy of the Palestinian Population registry from the Palestinian Authority (PA), which includes personal information and addresses of all West Bank and Gaza residents. The registry is constantly updated by the Population and Immigration Authority’s unit in the Israeli Civil Administration (ICA), located in the settlement of Beit El in the occupied West Bank. The data on the Registry is systematically used by Israel for the implementation of discriminatory policies against Palestinians who are eligible for different rights under Israeli control, including discrimination in relation to freedom of movement, voting, family reunification and access to services. The Authority is also in charge of issuing permits for all international visitors to the West Bank.\n\nIBM provides maintenance for the Aviv and Eitan systems, and as of December 31, 2023, the remaining contract is approximately NIS 383 million, and it is expected to end in 2035.\n\nDocumenting Crossings for the Israeli Borders Authority\n\nThe Eitan System is also used in all of the crossings under Israeli control in the occupied West Bank and Jerusalem Envelope, including Allenby Bridge Crossing which is the only access for West Bank Palestinian residents to travel abroad; and Erez checkpoint, which is the only crossing for the movement of people between the besieged Gaza and Israel and the West Bank - both controlled by and subjected to Israeli authorities.\n\nComputing services for PIBA\n\nIn September 2023, IBM Israel Ltd. was contracted, with an exemption from tender, for the purchases of Informatics licensing for the “Information Avenue” project, a secure system for sharing and transferring information between the various ministries and authorities, until September 2025 for NIS 579,999.\n\nIn August 2023, IBM Israel Ltd. was contracted, with an exemption from tender, to establish an organizational Security Operation Center (SOC) for the core systems of the Population and Immigration Authority until August 2026 for NIS 4,648,363.\n\nIn 2020, IBM was contracted to provide maintenance and upgrading services for all computer systems for the issuing of biometric passports by the Authority as part of the Eitan System. In 2021, IBM was contracted to provide services for a remote biometric identification system as part of the biometric identification project of PIBA for NIS 5.6 million. In June 2023, IBM Israel Ltd. was contracted, as part of a contract increase, for upgrading the computer systems of the biometric site’s mailing machine until July 2023 for NIS 560,720.\n\nE-Visa project\n\nAs part of the Israeli government's “digital acceleration” plan outlined in Resolution No. 260, IBM along with Elbit Systems has been awarded several contracts to digitalize services and data storing for the Israeli Borders Authority. These include a NIS 18 million contract awarded to the companies in December 2020 for the development of the E-VISA project (Marom in Hebrew). E-Visa is an online platform for entrance visa applications. The project includes a “pre-passenger arrival data” collection system.\n\nServices to the Israeli military\n\nRed Hat Israel\n\nIBM’s fully owned Israeli subsidiary, Red Hat Israel, works extensively with the Israeli military, providing edge computing and software-based storage data centers to multiple units of the Israeli military.\n\nThe company's employees work in close partnership with many units in the Israeli military and are integrated into the day-to-day processes of the various technological units in the Israeli military. In addition, the company's Research & Development body collaborates on several projects with the development bodies in the various military units.\n\nThe Red Hat OpenShift platform, deployed with applications and data, is currently used by most units in the military as a vital part of their daily operations. Red Hat OpenShift enables the development and automated run-up of applications and cloud-oriented Artificial Intelligence models in the central cloud and at the edge in order to simplify the development and deployment phases from an operational point of view.\n\nMilitary Cloud\n\nRed Hat provides its OpenShift platform for the Israeli military Operational Cloud and Data Center. The Israeli military widely uses Red Hat's software OpenShift as its cloud platform and performs extensive activities with it.\n\nRed Hat works in collaboration with the Israeli military Mamram Unit (abbreviation for Center of Computing and Information Systems) which provides cloud service and data processing services to all military units and general military staff. In 2018, the Mamram unit launched its own operational cloud based on Red Hat infrastructure as part of a military cloud platform used by thousands of operational users. The project was estimated at millions of NIS. The cloud is part of the Israeli Military Network Program to establish an operational Internet infrastructure with significant operational value based on the Software Defined Data Center (SDDC) on Red Hats’ OpenShift platform infrastructure. The cloud is used for the development of multi-armed operational systems that allow information sharing between military divisions, including the Military Intelligence Directorate, the Israeli Air Force, the Ground Forces and the Navy.\n\nMamram also uses the company’s Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management and Red Hat Anxible Automation Platform for automation and accelerate endpoint deployment.\n\nIn addition, the company has Joint projects with Israeli military Computer Service and Cyber Defense divisions in the fields of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.\n\nIn 2022, Red Hat awarded Mamram Unit its 2022 technological innovation award at the company’s Global Summit event for its customers around the world.\n\nIBM Israel\n\nIBM’s history with the Israeli military dates back to 1969, when the Israeli military installed its first IBM computer outside the military computing center.\n\nIn 2020, IBM was contracted by the Israeli Ministry of Defense (IMOD) and the Israeli military to be the main IT provider for three new military regional logistics centers for the period of 25 years. The new centers will provide all the military’s logistical needs using an advanced technology. The entire operation is expected to be civilian, and based largely on robotics and sophisticated equipment. The contract, shared by IBM and Malam Team (a public Israeli IT Company) is valued at $1B for both companies.\n\nIn 2017, IBM was contracted by the IMOD for the operation and maintenance of the Israeli military computing centers in the amount of more than $ 20 million.\n\nIn 2011, IBM was contracted by the IMOD for hundreds of millions of USD to supply the Israeli military with storage and central servers.\n\nThroughout the early 2000s dozens of IBM Israel employees were outsourced by the Israeli military’s Computer and IT unit and worked alongside soldiers and officers.\n\nJoint projects with the Israeli Ministry of Defense (IMOD)\n\nIn March 2024, IBM Israel hosted in its offices a conference for about 100 participants from the Israeli military, the hi-tech industry and other organizations. The conference was held in cooperation with the military ICT and Cyber Defense Directorate and the Cyber Education Center, founded by the Israeli Ministry of Defense. Among the lecturers were the commander of the Israeli Military School of Computer and Cyber ​​Defense and a software engineer at Microsoft.\n\nIn December 2023, Red Hat hosted 100 students from the pre-military preparatory of the Israeli military's Computer and Cyber Defense School for a three-day technology hackathon on \"Operation Swords of Iron\", the name given by the State of Israel to the Israeli military operation launched against Gaza in October 2023. The collaboration was designed to provide the students with tools for developing technological solutions, adapted to the Israeli military.\n\nRed Hat Israel takes part in a joint venture with the military's Computer Service Directorate, the “Nitzanim” program, a three-year training program for high school students. The program is designed to detect and train teens with potential and technological orientation in software and cyber to integrate them into military units. In 2023 and 2022, company personnel held a technology summer camp together with Israeli military officers.\n\nIBM is part of a joint venture with the Israeli military in a program designed to qualify combatants who have been discharged from service in the Israeli military (8200 Unit) to work in the Israeli cyber and high-tech industry.\n\nIBM is part of The Israel Innovation Authority committee, which operates joint ventures with the Administration of the Ministry of Defense and the National Cyber Directorate in the Prime Minister's Office to support Israeli technology companies in the fields of cyber defense for the defense and commercial markets.\n\nIBM takes part in a project of business companies, in cooperation with the Israeli military and the Israeli Ministry of Education, meant to encourage high school students to excel in computer science and technology as a way to “preserve and improve Israel's technological excellence” and “defense abilities”. Engineers from the company lecture at schools alongside military officers who give preparatory lectures for military service.\n\nIBM has been a participator in iHLS INNOTECH, the International Conference and Exhibition in Israel for Cyber and Homeland Security, which is organized in cooperation with the IMOD and the Israeli Administration for the Development of Weapons and Technological Infrastructure. The conference hosts senior officials from the defense establishment, police, security and intelligence agencies and senior executives from the defense industries.\n\nIBM has been a participator, sponsor and speaker in Cybertech exhibitions in Israel organized by and sponsored by Israel National Cyber Security Authority, Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Israel Ministry of Economy.\n\nServices to Settlements - Ariel University\n\nIBM cooperates with Ariel University located in the settlement of Ariel in the West Bank. In 2019, the company hosted a mentoring event of the University in its compound, and participated in another event for top students of the University.\n\nCyber Research Center in the Naqab\n\nIn 2018, IBM launched a new cyber research center in the high-tech park “Gav-Yam” in the city of Be'er Sheva in the Naqab. The industrial park is located next to the Israeli military telecommunication base and Computer Service Directorate campus, and was built as part of a Southern Relocation plan led by the Israeli Ministry of Defense. This military and industrial development plan was designed to relocate technology companies alongside military elite tech units to the Naqab in order to enhance the integration of soldiers from Cyber units in work in high-tech companies at the end of their service. This project is part of a greater attempt to strengthen Jewish settlement and development in the Naqab while Palestinian Bedouin communities in the region face forced displacement and de-development by Israeli authorities.\n\nFor more on Development & Military Projects in the Naqab see Who Profits’ interactive map: Tools of Dispossession in the Naqab.\n\nServices to the Israel Police\n\nSince 1975, IBM has provided the Israel Police with computer and software equipment, including a central computer, backup libraries and Operating System software, and a great part of its computer systems depend solely on IBM hardware and software. Over the years, many of those systems have been developed based on IBM’s hardware and software.\n\nIn 2016, the company was contracted with an exemption from tender by Israel Police to be the sole supplier for Software maintenance for NIS 3 million and to be the Israel Police sole supplier for hardware maintenance in an additional contract. In 2014, the company was contracted for maintenance of central computer and software licensing for two years for NIS 2.8 million.\n\nNimbus Project\n\nAs part of the tender for the \"Nimbus Project\" for public cloud services as part of the computing system of government ministries, Red Hat was selected as one of the companies authorized to provide services for the government cloud. The company offers its hybrid cloud application platform Red Hat OpenShift services to government ministries that will choose to purchase its platform. The Nimbus tender includes the provision of cloud computing services to the Israeli Ministry of Defense and the state-owned companies Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) and Rafael Advanced Defense Systems which supply weapon systems to the Israeli military.\n\nIBM, International Business Machines Corporation, is an American multinational technology corporation, one of the world’s largest and oldest computer and IT companies. The company has two fully-owned Israeli subsidiaries, IBM Israel Ltd., and Red Hat Israel.\n\nServices to the Israeli Population, Immigration and Borders Authority\n\nManaging the Israeli Population Registry – the Aviv and Eitan Systems\n\nIBM is the operator of the Israeli Population Registry computing system, which stores information on Palestinians living in the oPt.\n\nIn 2017, IBM was selected to design and operate the “Eitan” System for the Israeli Population, Immigration and Borders Authority’s (PIBA) Population Registry database, to gradually replace the “Aviv” System, which was previously operated and managed by HP and later by HPE and DXC Technologies.\n\nIn 2018, IBM was contracted by the Authority to develop a computerized system for the management of the national Population Registry for approximately NIS 840 million.
