The categories of sources from which we collect such information are from you and from third party business partners. For more details about the Personal Information we have collected over the last 12 months, including the categories of sources, please see the Personal Information We May Collect or Receive (Section 2) above.\n\nWe collect this information for the following business and commercial purposes (described in more detail in the “How We May Use Personal Information” section of this Policy): providing the Website and Software Services; performing marketing and advertising; conducting analytics and Website/Software Services improvement; and for security/compliance. We share this information with the categories of third parties described in the How We May Share Personal Information (Section 4) above. In particular, we have shared information as follows:\n\nCategory of Personal InformationCategories of RecipientsIdentifiersAffiliates; Service Providers; Professional Advisors; Advertising Partners.Commercial InformationAffiliates; Service Providers; Professional Advisors; Advertising Partners.Internet Activity InformationAffiliates; Service Providers; Advertising Partners.Professional InformationAffiliates; Service Providers; Professional Advisors; Advertising Partners.InferencesAffiliates; Service Providers; Professional Advisors; Advertising Partners.\n\nApptio does not knowingly sell or share (as those terms are defined in the CCPA) the Personal Information of individuals younger than 16.\n\nPrivacy Rights\n\nSubject to certain limitations, the CCPA provides California consumers a number of rights, specifically:\n\nthe right to request to know more details about the categories Personal Information we collect (including how we use and disclose this information) or access specific pieces of Personal Information we have about them;\n\nto delete their Personal Information;\n\nto correct inaccurate Personal Information;\n\nto opt out of any “sales” or “sharing” that may be occurring through our use of third-party cookies for advertising as described in section 15 below by disabling targeting and social media cookies through the cookie settings portal [(you can also opt out by visiting our Website while using a legally-recognized universal choice signal (such as the Global Privacy Control) enabled but please note that our processing of the signal may be limited to the specific browser or device you are using)]; and\n\nto not be discriminated against you for exercising these rights.\n\nCalifornia consumers may make a request to know, access, correct, or delete pursuant to their rights under the CCPA by contacting us as set out in the How to Contact Us section below or via our CPRA consumer access request form.

Authorized agents can submit requests in the same manner as consumers but must include proof of authorization to make the request.\n\nWe retain Personal Information as long as necessary to carry out the purposes for which we originally collected it and for other business purposes explained in this Policy.\n\n8. Data Security\n\nWe take reasonable steps given the context of the engagement in which data is provided to protect your Personal Information from loss, misuse, interference, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. However, the security of information transmitted through the Internet can never be guaranteed and is not entirely within our control. Where you receive a password for access to certain parts of our Website or the Software Services, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share your password with anyone.\n\n9. Cross-Border Data Transfers\n\nWe may transfer your Personal Information to countries other than the country in which the data was originally collected. Those countries may not have the same data protection laws as the country in which you initially provided that information. When we transfer your Personal Information to other countries, we will protect it as described in this Privacy Policy. To offer our services, we may need to transfer your personal information among several countries where we have employees, facilities or service providers, including the United Sates, where we are headquartered.

We also recognize Switzerland’s announcement that the Swiss-US Privacy Shield Framework does not provide an adequate level of protection to transfer personal data from Switzerland to the U.S. We now rely on Standard Contractual Clauses or other lawful transfer mechanisms approved by the European Commission (or other relevant governmental authority) to transfer personal data from the EEA, the UK, and Switzerland.\n\n10.

IBM may process your Personal Information on the basis of its legitimate interests in overseeing the recruitment process and, if applicable, your employment relationship with Apptio.\n\n11.

For example, we may use required cookies to authenticate your access to various secure areas of our Website that may contain content for registered users.\n\nOther cookies allow us to enhance your browsing experience, tailor content to your preferences, and make your interactions with our Website more meaningful. We refer to these as “performance” cookies. For example, performance cookies may be used to determine whether you have visited our Website before and inform us about site features in which you have interest, thereby permitting us to better tailor the site to our users.\n\nIn addition to required and performance cookies, some third parties issue cookies through our Website to serve ads that are relevant to your interests based on your browsing activities. Targeting cookies also allow us to analyze Website traffic so we can measure and improve performance. These third parties may also collect your browser history or other information to determine how you reached our Website and the pages you visit when you leave our Website.

They are capable of tracking your browser across other sites and building up a profile of your interests.\n\nWeb Beacons\n\nWeb beacons (also known as internet tags, pixel tags, and clear GIFs) are clear electronic images that can recognize certain types of information on your computer, such as the type of browser used to view a website page, when you viewed a particular site linked to the Web beacon, and a description of a site tied to the Web beacon. Certain pages on our Website may contain such Web beacons, which Apptio uses to operate and improve the Website.\n\nHow to Control Cookies?\n\nApptio complies with privacy laws that control cookies for users throughout the world, including the EU & California. Those users can modify their cookie settings when they first visit our website, or by accessing their cookie settings.

However, you can stop cookies being downloaded to your computer by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser. Most browsers will allow you to see what cookies you have and delete them on an individual basis or block cookies from particular or all websites. Be aware that any preference you have set will be lost if you delete all cookies, including your preference to opt-out from cookies as this itself requires an opt-out cookie to have been set. For more information on how to modify your browser settings to block or filter cookies, see http://www.aboutcookies.org/ or http://www.cookiecentral.com/faq/. Please bear in mind that removing or blocking cookies can affect your user experience and without cookies, you may not be able to take full advantage of our Website features. We may modify or amend this Cookie information from time to time at our discretion.
