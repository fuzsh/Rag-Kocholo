        "text": "NEW YORK (CNN/Money) - Signaling a comprehensive collaboration on Web technology, infrastructure and security, IBM and VeriSign Inc. have teamed up in a partnership to provide enhanced network security services to their customers.\n\nUnder the terms of a multi-year agreement to be announced Tuesday, the two companies will work to combine their network security technologies and jointly market them.\n\nVeriSign also has named IBM its technology provider of choice to supply the server, storage and software products and systems integration services to deliver network authorization services as it builds out its network infrastructure, which the company claims currently manages more than five billion network connections and transactions a day.\n\nThe two companies say the new business relationship aims to provide customers with a powerful combination of computer security technology, software and services in options ranging from stand-alone software to managed software services delivered as a utility service over the Internet.\n\nFor its part, IBM gets to add VeriSign's security technology to its portfolio of information technology, or IT, services as well as the potential for additional hardware and software sales. Meanwhile, the partnership significantly expands VeriSign's marketing reach to a broader range of customers.\n\nVeriSign (VRSN: Research, Estimates) is a leading supplier of what it calls \"digital trust services.\" It provides encrypted software IDs, called digital certificates, and security services to safeguard data and transactions sent over the Internet and corporate networks. Its products incorporate such certification technologies as public key infrastructure, or PKI, and virtual private networks.\n\nThrough its Network Solutions subsidiary, VeriSign also is the largest supplier of Internet domain-name registration services.\n\nIBM (IBM: down $5.65 to $114.25, Research, Estimates) is the world's largest maker of computer hardware and, through its IBM Global services division, is the top provider of IT services. The company in recent years has sharpened its focus on networking technology, hoping to lock in the burgeoning market for hardware and services companies will need as they move their businesses onto the Internet.\n\n\"This is a very important deal for both companies and it's one that affects a number of different groups throughout IBM,\" said Michael Nelson, director for Internet technology and strategy at IBM.\n\n\"We're combining IBM's reputation for providing secure and reliable hardware and software with VeriSign's proven record in the marketplace for providing digital trust services. I think this is a very strong combination,\" Nelson added.\n\nAs part of their agreement, the two companies will create and jointly market new services, including an \"entitlements management service\" that combines IBM's software technology with VeriSign's PKI authentication and security technology.\n\nIBM Global Services and VeriSign's Consulting Services Group also will work together to provide managed services and support for companies deploying PKI technology.\n\nThe two companies also will collaborate on the development of secure Web services that combine their respective strengths.\n\nBy combining VeriSign's secure infrastructure capabilities and authentication services with IBM's security products, the two companies are hoping to attract new customers who want the benefit of identity, authentication and authorization services but cannot afford to deploy the secure infrastructure required to deliver them.\n\nFinancial terms of the partnership were not disclosed."
