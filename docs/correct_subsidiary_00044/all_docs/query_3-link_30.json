        "text": "IBM and Palo Alto Networks announced a wide-reaching partnership to mix and match security technology between the vendors. The deal includes the sale of Big Blue’s QRadar security intelligence platform to Palo Alto.\n\nIBM and Palo Alto aim to help streamline and transform security operations, stop threats at scale, and accelerate incident remediation for their customers with the complete AI-powered approach the vendors say is needed to address current threat levels across the enterprise.\n\nThe partnership will include a variety of integrations between IBM’s watsonx AI and data platform and Palo Alto’s Cortex Extended Security Intelligence and Analytics Management (XSIAM) security system. For example, IBM said it intends to expand its use of Palo Alto’s AI-powered security platforms internally, adopting Cortex for next-gen security operations and Prisma SASE 3.0 for zero-trust network security to safeguard more than 250,000 of its global workforce. In addition, IBM said it will build industry-vertical capabilities on top of Cortex XSIAM using its watsonx technology.\n\nFor its part, Palo Alto said it intends to integrate watsonx LLMs into Cortex to drive additional automation capabilities. And watsonx will help Palo Alto address known technical issues, create tailored self-service solutions, and boost overall agent productivity within Palo Alto customer support operations. In addition, Palo Alto plans to deploy other IBM cloud and automation software, the company stated.\n\nAfter the deal closes, which is expected to happen by September, Palo Alto and IBM will facilitate the migration of QRadar SaaS clients to Cortex XSIAM.\n\n“On-premise QRadar clients who wish to remain on QRadar on-prem will continue to receive IBM features and support including security, usability, and critical bug fixes, as well as updates to existing connectors and the ability to expand consumption,” IBM stated.\n\n“For both QRadar SaaS and on-prem clients who chose to migrate to Cortex XSIAM, the companies, along with their ecosystem of business partners, will closely collaborate to enable a smooth transfer, with IBM and Palo Alto Networks offering no-cost migration services to qualified customers,” IBM stated.\n\nThe partnership also includes the following features:\n\nIBM Consulting will become a preferred Managed Security Services Provider (MSSP) for Palo Alto customers.\n\nA joint Security Operations Center will feature a managed SOC, and the companies will also establish a joint Cyber Range.\n\nIBM will expand its relationship with Palo Alto Prisma Cloud. Prisma Cloud will expand its existing integrations with current and future IBM DevOps offerings, including cloud-native security built for Red Hat OpenShift and Ansible.\n\nIBM will also train more than 1,000 of its security consultants on the migration, adoption, and deployment of Palo Alto products.\n\n“Advanced threat protection and automation, underpinned by Cortex XSIAM and watsonx, and coupled with IBM Consulting, will speed client and partner adoption of next-generation security operations,” Arvind Krishna, Chairman and CEO, IBM said in a statement. “We’ll deliver these capabilities with Palo Alto Networks, and accelerate our security investments and innovation in areas like data security and identity and access management. These are critical offerings that our clients need when protecting their data, hybrid cloud environments, AI models, and applications.”\n\nIBM and Palo Alto have had a strategic partnership for cybersecurity developments for several years. For example, the companies jointly offer security offerings through IBM Consulting Cybersecurity Services, integrating Palo Alto Networks security technologies. The partnership will focus on helping companies modernize their security operations and secure cloud transformations."
