        "text": "The System x3650 M5 supports TruDDR4 memory. TruDDR4 memory uses the highest-quality components sourced from Tier 1 DRAM suppliers and only memory that meets strict requirements is selected. It is compatibility tested and tuned on every System x server to maximize performance and reliability.\n\nTruDDR4 memory has a unique signature programmed into the DIMM, which enables System x servers to verify whether the memory installed is qualified and supported. Because TruDDR4 memory is authenticated, certain extended memory performance features can be enabled to extend performance over industry standards. From a service and support standpoint, System x memory automatically assumes the system's warranty, and service and support provided worldwide.\n\nThe System x3650 M5 supports up to 12 DIMMs with one processor and up to 24 DIMMs when two processors are installed. Each processor has four memory channels, and there are three DIMMs per channel.\n\nThe following rules apply when selecting the memory configuration:\n\nThe server supports RDIMMs and LRDIMMs.\n\nMixing different types of memory (RDIMMs and LRDIMMs) is not supported.\n\nAll DIMMs in the server operate at the same speed, which is determined as the lowest value of:\n\nMemory speed that is supported by the specific processor.\n\nMemory speed for selected quantity of DIMMs per channel.\n\nNote: Maximum memory speed can be achieved when Max performance mode is enabled in UEFI.\n\nThe following memory protection technologies are supported:\n\nECC\n\nChipkill (for x4-based memory DIMMs)\n\nMemory mirroring\n\nMemory rank sparing\n\nChipkill works only in independent channel mode (the default operational mode) and supports only x4-based memory DIMMs.\n\nIf memory mirroring is used, then DIMMs must be installed in pairs (a minimum of one pair per each processor), and both DIMMs in a pair must be identical in type and size.\n\nIf memory rank sparing is used, then a minimum of one quad-rank DIMM or two single-rank or dual-rank DIMMs must be installed per populated channel (the DIMMs do not need being identical). In rank sparing mode, one rank of a DIMM in each populated channel is reserved as spare memory. The size of a rank varies depending on the DIMMs installed.\n\nChipkill, memory mirroring, and memory rank sparing modes are mutually exclusive. Only one operational memory mode can be enabled on a server, and it is a system-wide setting.\n\nSystem x engineering tested and validated system designs that support memory speeds beyond Intel memory specifications, which provides benefits for workloads that require memory speed and density. System x TruDDR4 memory is fully supported up to the rated speeds that are shown in the following table. Table cells highlighted with a gray background indicate when the DIMMs are allowed to operate at a higher speed than Intel specifications define.\n\nTable 7.

If an environmental condition exceeds a threshold or if a system component fails, the IMM2.1 lights LEDs to help you diagnose the problem, records the error in the event log, and alerts you to the problem. Optionally, the IMM2.1 also provides a virtual presence capability for remote server management capabilities.\n\nThe IMM2.1 provides remote server management through industry-standard interfaces:\n\nIntelligent Platform Management Interface (IPMI) Version 2.0\n\nSimple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) Version 3\n\nCommon Information Model (CIM)\n\nWeb browser\n\nThe optional Integrated Management Module Advanced Upgrade is required to enable the remote presence and blue-screen capture features. The remote presence feature provides the following functions:\n\nRemotely viewing video with graphics resolutions up to 1600x1200 at 75 Hz with up to 23 bits per pixel\n\nRemotely accessing the server using the keyboard and mouse from a remote client\n\nMapping the CD or DVD drive, diskette drive, and USB flash drive on a remote client, and mapping ISO and diskette image files as virtual drives that are available for use by the server\n\nUploading a diskette image to the IMM memory and mapping it to the server as a virtual drive\n\nThe blue-screen capture feature captures the video display contents before the IMM2.1 restarts the server when the IMM2.1 detects an operating system hang condition. A system administrator can use the blue-screen capture to assist in determining the cause of the hang condition.\n\nThe following table lists the remote management option.\n\nTable 38. Remote management option Description Part number Feature code Maximum supported Integrated Management Module Advanced Upgrade 90Y3901 A1ML 1\n\nLight path diagnostics\n\nAll System x3650 M5 server models include basic light path diagnostics, which provides the system LEDs on the front of the server (see Components and connectors) and the LEDs near the monitored components (for example, the DIMM error LED on the system board).\n\nServer models with 8x 3.5-inch or 8x or 16x 2.5-inch front drive bays support a next-gen light path diagnostics LCD display panel (standard on 8x 3.5-inch models; available as an option for 8x or 16x 2.5-inch models). With LCD display, you have quick access to system status, firmware, network, and health information.\n\nStorage dense server models (models with USB ports and system LEDs that are located on the right EIA bracket) with 8x or 16x 2.5-inch front drive bays that are upgradeable to 24x 2.5-inch front drive bays and models with 12x 3.5-inch front drive bays do not support an LCD display panel.\n\nThe following table shows the LCD display panel ordering information.\n\nTable 39.
