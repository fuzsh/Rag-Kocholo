        "text": "Acquisition reports prompted open source buzz\n\nIn the initial wake of reported talks this week, industry watchers predicted HashiCorp's open source stance might change following such a deal.\n\nIBM historically was not a supporter of open source, but since its $34 billion acquisition of open source software bellwether Red Hat in 2019 has continued its subsidiary's open source commitments. IBM has also integrated OpenTofu with its IBM Cloud Pak for AIOps, and IBM engineers working on its Open Horizon edge computing product founded the OpenBao project to fork Vault.\n\n\"If IBM goes through with this deal, it will be a massive win for the open source community,\" said Larry Carvalho, an independent analyst at RobustCloud, before the acquisition was confirmed. \"IBM should combine HashiCorp with Red Hat and immediately remove copyright infringement claims. The community's combined efforts will improve Terraform much better than HashiCorp's current direction.\"\n\nHashiCorp's Terraform and Red Hat's Ansible IT automation software are already frequently associated in the infrastructure management market, said Rob Strechay, lead analyst at enterprise tech media company TheCube. Other HashiCorp products, such as Vault and Vagrant for portable developer environments, would be a natural fit with Red Hat's OpenShift portfolio, he said.\n\n\"I believe this is a lifeline for HashiCorp and Terraform that could bring it back together with OpenTofu, as the two are not that far apart code-wise yet,\" Strechay said. \"Overall, this would be a win-win for both companies and probably the best outcome.\"\n\nOther analysts, while seeing the potential for a beneficial combination of the companies, disagreed that IBM would change HashiCorp's open source course.\n\n\"The BSL thing is a red herring that needs to go away,\" Crawford said. \"Nobody cares about it except for the companies that were building businesses on top of it to the detriment of HashiCorp.\"\n\nStill, IBM would be among the most neutral possible acquirers of HashiCorp, which has staked its value on compatibility with multiple major cloud computing providers, according to Crawford.\n\n\"If IBM were to purchase HashiCorp, they could round out the offering, introduce it to a broader base and scale it in new ways,\" without returning it to open source, he said. \"HashiCorp would be a solid complement to Red Hat and provide mutual value to both companies for different reasons. For IBM, it provides an alternative foundation for applications to Broadcom's VMware while complementing Red Hat's OpenShift Kubernetes platform.\"\n\nOne HashiCorp customer took a more pessimistic view of the potential acquisition.\n\n\"IBM being a second-tier cloud player buying HashiCorp would be worse than a software-only house buying them,\" said Rob Lazzurs, CTO at Amach Software, a digital transformation consultancy in Dublin. \"This puts the future direction of a set of cross-platform tools in the hands of a single player.\"\n\nLazzurs was also not enthusiastic about the idea of HashiCorp's open source direction under IBM.\n\n\"What we have seen with Red Hat is [that] over time, IBM culture has taken over, and I expect the same to happen to HashiCorp,\" he said. \"This is a great example of why foundational tools in our computing landscape should be managed by foundations rather than corporations.\"\n\nUpdated following initial publication."
