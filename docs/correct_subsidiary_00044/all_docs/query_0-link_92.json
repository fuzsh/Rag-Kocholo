        "text": "Threat actors are always looking for security gaps to find a way into an organization’s networks and infrastructure. Reactive cybersecurity strategies are not enough to protect your business-critical systems and data.\n\nWith the Offensive Security bundles, you can assemble your proactive security portfolio all in one place, choosing the combination that best fits the needs and security stance of your organization. Each one of our bundle offerings provides centralization and reduced console fatigue that will enhance and accelerate your security. By consolidating vendors, you’ll also benefit from the efficiency of having the same best-in-class sales and technical support that Fortra offers across solutions — all at a discounted price.\n\nLEARN MORE >\n\nMany organizations need to share files among customers and trading partners quickly and securely. But with collaboration comes the threat of embedded malware and data loss.\n\nThanks to a seamless integration with Fortra's Secure ICAP Gateway, this bundle allows you to inspect content transferred with either Fortra's GoAnywhere MFT or Fortra's Globalscape EFT for threats as well as leakage. Without the risk of malware or data loss, organizations can be confident data will be shared and received securely.\n\nLEARN MORE >\n\nZero trust is about more than network segmentation. Fortra can help you securely share and encrypt sensitive data with authorized individuals while protecting it from viruses and malware. Our Zero Trust Transfer bundle enables automatic file sharing, scanning for malware or viruses, and encryption to give you total control over your files — wherever they travel.\n\nThis bundle combines the power of Fortra’s Secure File Transfer, Secure ICAP Gateway, Secure Collaboration, File Access Control, and Encryption solutions to deliver portable, persistent data security for files of all sizes and sensitivity levels, as well as helps organizations make meaningful progress towards zero trust goals.\n\nLEARN MORE >\n\nMany IT teams don’t have any experience migrating IBM Power workloads to the cloud, which can be difficult. These workloads are often mission critical, and hiccups in their migration process can frequently result in costly outages. Our Cloud Migration bundle includes the technology necessary to plan for and perform a successful migration — including analysis of collection services, sizing, local and remote journaling, and more. You’ll also receive ongoing support from our experts from installation to operation — so that all you’ll have to worry about is leveraging the bundle to create a more secure and efficient IBM i for your organization.\n\nLEARN MORE >"
