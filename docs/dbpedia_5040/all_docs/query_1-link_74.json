        "text": "The Automatic are a Welsh four-piece band who met in Cowbridge, Glamorgan, but are now based in Cardiff. They describe their music as \"electro-disco-metal-rock\". They are influenced heavily by acts such as Jarcrew, Muse, Blur and The Blood Brothers, among others. In the USA and Canada, the band is promoted as The Automatic Automatic.\n\nThe Automatic are:\n\nRobin Hawkins (Rob)- Lead Vocals / Bass Guitar / keys\n\nJames Frost - Guitars / Vocals / keys\n\nIwan Griffiths (Wang) - Drums\n\nPaul Mullen - Guitar / Vocals / keys\n\nIn November 2005, the band released their first single, Recover, prior to the release of their debut Not Accepted Anywhere, this single however was not chart eligible since only 1,500 copies were released on vinyl and only 3,500 on CD. Also in 2005, The Automatic won The Pop Factory award for \"Best New Act\".\n\nOn March 27, 2006, the band's next single, Raoul, was released, reaching #32 in the UK Singles Chart. The third single, Monster, was released on June 5, 2006 and reached #4, but entered the UK Singles Chart at #23 the week before based on download sales alone. Monster has also been re-mixed into a dance track by Fatboy Slim, and some football teams use the song as an anthem. When sung at sporting events, the chorus is sometimes changed to \"What's that coming over the hill - is it your sister? Is it your sister?\" Keyboardist Alex Pennie has expressed his thoughts on football fans singing their song Monster, and does not see it as a good thing, nor does he get any thrill out of them singing it, also stating \"I'm not the biggest fan of football, I class it a waste of time,\" in an interview with MTV.co.uk\n\nNot Accepted Anywhere, was released on 19 June, 2006, which they celebrated with a signing and performance in Oxford Street's HMV.\n\nOn July 17, 2006 shortly after the UK release of Not Accepted Anywhere, the Raoul EP was released, containing a number of early songs and b-sides to Not Accepted Anywhere. The EP also included the original versions of Recover and Raoul.\n\nThe fourth single was a full release of Recover, and is actually a re-recorded version of the song which the record label felt to be a more fully-realised performance. Generally it is heavier in sound, features more synths from Pennie and a sharper guitar sound for Frost's solo.\n\n16 August 2006 saw the band's second EP, titled Live at the 100 Club, the EP was recorded at the 100 Club, in London and made exclusive to iTunes.\n\nThe fifth single, a re-release of Raoul, was released on January 8, 2007. The single fared worse than its original release, however received higher plays on MTV, Kerrang and other music stations.\n\nOn June 26, 2007 the band released Not Accepted Anywhere in the USA and Canada, this comes prior to their Vans Warped Tour. Their first US single, Monster, was released on April 24, 2007.\n\nThe difference between the version they released in the USA and Canada and the version you find in the rest of the world is the colour of the cover: it's fawn, instead of brown.\n\nAlex Pennie (Penge) (keyboard/vocals) left the band on 18th September 2007.\n\nOn October 19 2007 it was reported by Rock Sound's website that former Yourcodenameis:milo vocalist Paul Mullen would be replacing Pennie.\n\nShow More"
