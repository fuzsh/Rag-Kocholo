        "text": "It’s a brand new start for The Automatic. Back with a new album after a two year hiatus that saw them leave their record label and go it alone, the band tell Dave Owens why they’re happy with the DIY approach\n\nWE’RE trying to prove ourselves again by doing it on our own terms this time.”\n\nThe Automatic have settled themselves into a roomy, four-seater brown sofa that dominates the Media Wales studio and which comfortably accommodates these fashionably skinny indie boys.\n\nRob Hawkins, Paul Mullen, James Frost and Iwan Griffiths have spent an enjoyable afternoon entertaining us with stripped down versions of songs from new album Tear The Signs Down for an exclusive WalesOnline session.\n\nFrontman Rob is now candidly opening up on what it feels like to return to action, shorn of a major label deal, but with their destiny firmly in their own hands.\n\nThe Cowbridge band are set to release their third album on their own Armoured Records label. Recorded in Cardiff with regular producer Richard Jackson, it’s a landmark moment in their eventful career.\n\n“We spent the whole of 2009 writing the album and working out how we were going to release it,” says Rob. “In the end, it made sense just to release it ourselves, because that’s how we wanted to do it.\n\n“It’s definitely a new beginning, we’re in total control, we can do exactly what we want.”\n\n“We could have gone with other labels,” adds guitarist Paul, “but as Rob said, we just wanted to be in control, make the mistakes ourselves. After the last album, we want to put it on our shoulders. We actually care about it and we are going to do our best with it.”\n\nThat last album, It’s A Fix, was the tipping point for the band.\n\nAfter original member Alex Pennie left over musical differences in 2007, to be replaced by Paul – a former member of North East electro rock outfit Yourcodenameis:Milo, hopes were high the following year for their second album. However, things didn’t quite go according to plan.\n\nThe album peaked at a disappointing No 44. Despite containing a top-20 hit in the form of the thrilling Steve McQueen, the promotion of the album by label B-Unique was dogged by record company unrest and political in-fighting, resulting in The Automatic leaving the label after being caught in the crossfire.\n\nTheirs is a salutary tale of the potential pitfalls of being on a major label.\n\nThe band say they don’t look back at the upheaval with any great regret or bitterness.\n\nTime is a great healer. However they are still baffled at the way their last album was handled.\n\n“They (B-Unique) kind of pulled out all the drive behind the project before it had even been released,” explains Rob.\n\n“Steve McQueen was A listed on Radio 1 and was everywhere, the video was everywhere so it made no sense to pull out at when everything was going fine.\n\n“Everything up until then was great, the album sounded fantastic then they (the record label) lost all interest. When they don’t put anything behind you, it’s not going to go anywhere.\n\n“It’s heartbreaking you know,” adds Paul. “You put years of your life into it then it’s just taken away by someone at the top who’s decided not to push this forward.\n\n“Despite the single entering the chart at No 16, it was released half a week late, so we only had half a week’s sales. Looking back now it sounds crazy.”\n\n“However, we’re in a better position now, so it’s a blessing in disguise,” adds guitarist Frost. “Back at the time it was tough.”\n\nThe band are about to embark on a UK tour that will climax in a gig at The Barfly in Cardiff on March 31. To say they are champing at the bit would be an understatement.\n\nA series of universally sold out, low-key gigs in London prior to the tour saw the band preview material from Tear The Signs Down to an ecstatic response from a loyal legion of fans who have stuck with the band, despite two years spent in a state of flux.\n\n“We were surprised, we didn’t expect it to be honest,” says Paul.\n\n“We thought it would be a chance to sneak into London and play a few songs, and the gigs were packed out. It was a good gauge to see how we would be received.\n\n“The first time you play live, you ask that question, are the fans going to like it, but the reaction we’ve had has been great.”\n\nTear The Signs Down is out on Monday, March 8. The band begins a UK tour this week that climaxes with a gig at The Barfly, Cardiff, on March 31. Call 0844 8472424."
