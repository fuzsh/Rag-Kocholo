        "text": "Allow me to introduce my friend and mentor, cloud and silver lining, and quite aptly code-named companion, Milo.\n\nOn The Fallout Trust: \"That was a bit of a Shakespeare moment. Arty.\" Translation: The intense, and thoroughly polite, Joe Winter of said Fallout Trust raises a clenched palm aloft and squints at something in the distance. It may be an epiphany, a painful recollection of love lost, or just someone he’s spotted in the crowd.\n\nAnyway, I didn’t notice because the ghostly slither of an Interpol-esque melody was crawling up his trouser leg and thrashing around in his intestines, forcing its way out in the ragged, lovelorn melodies of a band who know what they're about and have a fistful of euphoric choruses to prove it.\n\nResplendent in moments of existential glory, The Fallout Trust write weblogs that place poetry and meaning in the fickle hands of fans desperate for something more than music.\n\nBut Milo’s meandering again. What was that? \"It’s kind of stadium rock in a tank top, isn’t it?\" Right you are, my dear. The Modey Lemon don’t so much wear their influences on their sleeve, as cheekily hide them behind a garage-rock façade of second-hand knitwear. This is Alice Cooper doing The Datsuns. Bombastic, grimy and dark enough to entice a bit of Monday-night-moshing.\n\n\"The Fallout Trust are resplendent in moments of existential glory.\"\n\nYourcodenameis:milo, though. This is what we’re here for. Right? \"I can’t be doing with all that nine minutes of instrumental bits.\" Oh dear. Even the most raw, pure, energetic mass of guitar-induced post-punk isn't enough for our Milo."
