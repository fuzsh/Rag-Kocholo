        "text": "Yourcodenameis:milo were an English alternative rock/experimental/post-hardcore band from Washington, Tyne and Wear. Their mini album, All Roads to Fault, was released in 2004, followed in 2005 by the full length album Ignoto, both on Fiction/Polydor Records. In 2006, the band left their Polydor contract and within a month signed a new record deal with V2 Records. In November 2006, the band released Print Is Dead Vol 1, a side project album featuring collaborations with other bands. Their second full-length album, They Came from the Sun, was released in 2007. The band reformed in 2020 to perform a set of charity concerts in aid of The Cluny in Newcastle.\n\n[]\n\nIn a 2020 interview with Soundsphere, singer Paul Mullen, described how the band got Peel's attention:\n\n\"He heard a demo – well actually, he didn’t hear a demo – because we sent him a CD and it didn’t work. He ended up calling Justin [Lockey, guitarist] and saying, ‘I’m going to make it my life’s work to listen to your CD!’ We didn’t even think it was actually John Peel on the phone, but it was. It was insane. From there, it all happened so fast.” [1]\n\nIn February 2003, the group did a session for Peel and the band's attention on his show led to the group's first mini album, All Roads to Fault, being produced by Steve Albini and released in 2004. This album was nominated by Peel as one of his records of the month for May 2004 (Peel's Record Box).\n\nSessions[]\n\n1. Recorded: 2003-02-28.
