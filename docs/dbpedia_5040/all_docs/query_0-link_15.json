        "text": "Collaborations are a hit and miss affair: when record companies try to capitalise on celebrity kudos, the product is usually an aural mutant, disowned by both parties. But you only have to hear the Seventies couplings of Iggy Pop and Bowie, or Andrew Weatherall and Primal Scream's euphoric mix of indie and dance, to know that artists can often coax the best from each other.\n\nThis 12-song dispatch from posthardcore Geordies Yourcodenameis: Milo, the follow-up to last year's Ignoto, is a shining example of the latter. If you're familiar with their usual brutal palette - bruising guitar workouts that nip off on unpredictable tangents - then this is a startlingly diverse set. Friends were invited to their studio under the Byker Bridge in Newcastle and each track was written and laid down in a day. In addition to local acts Field Music, Maximo Park and the Futureheads, there are a handful of unexpected names: Bloc Party's Gordon Moakes, garage supremo Lethal Bizzle and Welsh pop-punks the Automatic.\n\nPrint is Dead's immediacy, in an age where obsessive perfectionism sees bands wallow in creative paralysis, is enormously appealing. The Automatic track, 'The Trapeze Artist', with its riff-heavy guitar squalls and incantatory vocals, is a standout. Ditto Lukas Wooller of Maximo Park's bleepy 'Noah', which brings to mind Four Tet's eclectic skits, while Lethal Bizzle contributes 'Ordinary Day', a gruff diatribe on yob culture ('Yo Blair, Cameron, you doughnuts, wake up and open your eyes'). It is a plaudit to YCNIM that such disparate individuals can produce an album of engaging consistency without smothering those involved.\n\nThey're already working on volume two, apparently. Good thing too: this is a cross-pollination that has borne fruit."
