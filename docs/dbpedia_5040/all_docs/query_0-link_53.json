        "text": "Migraine-inducing, nerve-shattering and with barely a Sabbath-inspired guitar riff between them, YourCodeNameIs:Milo aren't your average British rock band. They hail from Newcastle and are in thrall to US punk rock, channelling the shrieking spirits of At the Drive-In and the Pixies. Listening to them is a little like getting beaten up by a drunk. First the grinding guitars hit you, with heavy drums pounding against the dense wall of noise. Singer Paul Mullen's emo warbling bounces between languid chants and phrases that are ripped to pieces with a scream. Then the attack stops. Gentle melodies suddenly stir and Mullen turns contrite choirboy. But the next assault is just around the corner, and the band's talent for stringing out the quiet moments makes the next shower of blows rain down even harder. \"I've never walked so far to clear a headache,\" Mullen sings numbly in Yesterday's Head as the sound of the world's worst hangover spins around him, a stream of tinny guitar notes etching out his pain."
