        "text": "CODES IN THE CLOUDS - PAPER CANYON\n\nPrice: €4.99\n\nFormat: Compact Disc\n\nAvailability: Immediate Dispatch\n\nInstrumental music is experiencing a new peak in England. Codes In The Clouds, the cinematic post-rock pop quintet of Morahan, Peeling, Smith, Major and Power from Greater London/Kent have found a firm place in this vast growing scene. With their harmonious and blissful sound they weave guitar melodies, liable to explode any minute. If you still can't imagine intense music without vocals then you will be surprised how easily these boys will let you forget this prejudice. Energetic and charming at once, surprising and unpredictable at all times. Completed under the experienced eye of Justin Lockey (Bloc Party, Yourcodenameis: Milo, Enter Shakari), and supported by a promotional video captured by US film-maker Mike Hedge (Burning Man - As the Dust Settles), CITC's long-awaited debut album âPaper Canyon' will see the light of day on May 18, 2009. This summer will also see Codes In The Clouds release a download remix album entitled âPaper Canyon Recycled' with contributions from Paul Mullen (The Automatic), who has been a fan of the band since he saw them live in '07, Maybeshewill, Worriedaboutsatan and many other friends of the band. The CD comes in a Deluxe Digisleeve containing a Free DDC* Download Voucher for the 11-track Erased Tapes Collection I label compilation.\n\nAfter receiving critical acclaim on both domestic (repeat plays by legendary BBC Radio 1 DJ Huw Stephens) and international stations for their first double A-side âDistant Street Lights / Fractures', and successful tours throughout the UK and Europe, Rock Sound counts Codes In The Clouds amongst the new discoveries of the past year and have hailed them as âOnes to Watch in 2009'. The birth of this formation didn't remain unnoticed in the US for long either. Online magazine The Silent Ballet crowned CITC the new pioneers of instrumental rock: Im running out of excuses to explain rather lackluster releases from recent powerhouses as Mono, Explosions In The Sky and Do Make Say Think. If they werent already wrapped up in their own music, theyd probably know better. Codes In The Clouds does.' Having finished 2007 supporting The Boxer Rebellion at Islington Academy in front of 800 people and a sold out label showcase at London's Roundhouse; 2008 finished no less dramatically, with a string of sold out shows with This Will Destroy You in Germany as well as on home soil, and true to form, 2009 will be no different starting with a few Jeniferever and Amusement Parks On Fire support shows in the UK. In autumn they will embark on an extensive EU tour with pg.lost from Sweden.\n\nCategories"
