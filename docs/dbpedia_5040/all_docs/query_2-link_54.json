        "text": "Named after a Joseph Heller character from Catch 22, Your Code Name Is: Milo, hail from Newcastle, ready to rock out on the UK shores.\n\nPlaying to a pretty busy Basement, the lads really thrashed out a selection of tracks from the recently released ‘Ignoto’ and other releases including EP, ‘Rapt. Dept.’, to a crowd ready to mosh their hearts out.\n\nYCNI:M are not your typical new band of the moment and certainly aren’t trying to rehash the eighties - as everyone else seems to be - well not quite everyone, but a damned lot of them. The music is full of dirty guitar riffs, interesting structures, with a whole lot of depth, found within the likes of masters Pearl Jam and current rockers Queens of the Stone Age.\n\nBut the sound is something quite different, with some tracks more in the style of Mars Volta, but even the odd hint of Rocket from The Crypt. The vocals from front man Paul Mullen (a pint sized chap), are quite piercing, but really complement the rather angular and quirky guitars.\n\nBasically the package works. The instruments don’t drown out the melodies and the melodies don’t swallow up the music. They have a balanced and effective style that seemed to go down stonkily with the crowd- an excitable bunch to say the least!\n\nThey already seem to have secured a fan base, with lots of people singing along to tracks released on previous EP’s and elated at hearing some of the new tracks from ‘Ignoto,’ this certainly isn’t a band to shy away from."
