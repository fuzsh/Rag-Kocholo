        "text": "But now the iconic Battersea Power Station will be cooled down as it’s transformed into a real life ski resort for the Freeze Festival on 23-26th October.\n\nCardiff four piece ‘The Automatic’ will play at the event alongside Hip/Hop funk outfit, ‘The Cuban Brothers’ and international superstars ‘Cypress Hill’.\n\n“We’re really looking forward to playing at Battersea Power Station,” says Paul Mullen, who is celebrating his one year anniversary with The Automatic having replaced founding keyboard player Alex Pennie.\n\n“We’ve played some other unusual venues like an old church and a boat in Bristol, and we played at the Royal Albert Hall which is amazing in itself, but nothing as vast or interesting as the Power Station.”\n\nBattersea is of course also famous for its dog's home and Paul is a canine fan; \"I am a big dog lover. I have a Pomeranian which featured in the We Are Scientists 'Chick Lit' video - they play cowboys rounding up a heard of the tiny little dogs. As I am touring a lot my girlfriend looks after them.\"\n\nPaul joined ‘The Automatic’ after his former band ‘Yourcodenameis:milo’ went on a hiatus last summer. He was faced with the decision to either go solo or look for a new band. “I knew The Automatic already as I had done a collaboration with them when I was in my old band and I’d seen them at festivals. When a mutual friend got in touch with me about joining, it seemed like the right thing to do. I had continued to write when I was on the break so I came into their studio and we made the album.”\n\nSo was he forced to drink ‘The Rollins’ (a mixture of Red Bull, Jaeger and Magners) - the band’s lethal cocktail concoction when he joined? “No I’ve never had one”, laughs Paul. “I thought they were going to make me drink one as an initiation and I don’t drink Jaeger so it would have been horrible!”\n\n‘The Automatic’ do like to party however and like any other band on the road there’s plenty of time for fun. “We have a good time, there’s always lots going on. Its good to meet up with friends from the cities that you visit on tour - sometimes its the only chance you get to see them in a while.”\n\nIf they play hard, they certainly work hard with an impressive festival route this summer which took in Glastonbury, Reading, Leeds and abroad to Spain and Switzerland. “Glastonbury was really special because the weather held out. It was great to wander around without needing a kayak or a canoe to get back to your tent!”\n\nAs well as some of the best bands around, the Freeze Festival will feature the world’s top snowboarders and skiers and an attempt on the biggest real snow jump ever made in the UK.\n\nDo The Automatic ski? “Some of the lads snowboard and I have skied a bit in the French Alps. Although last time I went I got injured. It was snowing and I got separated from the rest of the group, I went straight on, went flying and cut my cheek on the snow. I picked myself up, gave myself a pat on the back and got back on the skis!”\n\nInjury-prone Paul has also sustained on-stage wounds: “I was trying to be rock and roll at the end of a gig and jump off the stage leaving the rest of the guys there. However my foot got stuck on the monitor and I got my leg caught and tripped right into it.”\n\nThe Automatic are looking forward to playing alongside the all-star line-up at Freeze: “The length of the set will be determined by the other bands but I hope we get to do around five songs. The audience seem to love our cover of Usher’s ‘Love in This Club’ which we did for Radio One’s Live Lounge so we might try and put that in.”\n\nTickets for the FSO4 Freeze can be bought from www.londonfreeze.com or by calling Ticketmaster on 0844 847 2358. The Automatic play on Friday 24th October and the band’s website is http://www.theautomatic.co.uk/"
