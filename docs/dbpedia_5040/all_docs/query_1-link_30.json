        "text": "The band's new album is out on 25 August after a few delays caused by touring\n\nWelsh rockers The Automatic say the first single to be taken from their new album is all about the pains of adulthood.\n\nZane Lowe had the first play of Steve McQueen on his show on Monday but it is not due for release for another few weeks.\n\nGuitarist James Frost told Newsbeat the title was connected to the movie legend.\n\nHe said: \"It's not about him but it relates to him.\"\n\nSinger Rob Hawkins added: \"He's a metaphor rather than a direct reference.\n\n\"A lot of the first album was about leaving home because we were really young when we wrote it.\n\n\"It's a bit more about coming back to everything after travelling the world.\n\n\"It puts to bed a lot of the themes of growing up in the first album.\"\n\nPennie's departure\n\nIt has been two years since the band's breakout hit single Monster which reached number four in the UK charts.\n\nFollowing singles, by comparison, did not chart as well and opened them up to accusations of being one-hit wonders.\n\nThe new single showcases a much harder sound to the band, with the departure of shrieking keyboardist Alex Pennie and the recruiting of former Yourcodenameis:milo frontman Paul Mullen.\n\nThe band say the departure of Pennie happened over a period of about a year, during which it became clear that his musical ambitions were very different.\n\nFrost, though, insisted it wasn't too painful.\n\nThe band appeared on Top of the Pops back in 2006\n\nHe said: \"We're still sweet and we talk to him now and again.\"\n\nMany meanings\n\nAfter a few delays caused by a tour in early 2008, the new album, titled This Is A Fix, is due out on 25 August, just after the band's appearances at the Reading and Leeds festivals on 22-24 August.\n\nHawkins insisted the name has multiple meanings.\n\nHe said: \"It could mean, a drugs fix, it could mean a solution to something or a fix, as in a set-up.\n\n\"I think we all have days when we hear things in the news and wonder if it's all for real.\"\n\nFrost said: \"There's a track called Magazines that is totally different to anything we've ever done before.\n\n\"I think it could be a sign of what we might do on the next album. It's this kind of dirty, sexy thing."
