The Maronite Church is named for St. Maroun, who lived in northern Syria at the end of the 4th century. During the 7th century the Maronites suffered from persecution, due to differences in their beliefs, from the Byzantine emperor and the Muslims. In the 9th century the community moved to Mt. Lebanon and kept their distance from both the Christian and Muslim communities.

In the 18th century the Maronites joined the Catholic Church but maintained a certain degree of independence, including their own AramaicSyriac prayer liturgy. According to the Lebanese constitution the president of Lebanon must be Maronite.

In Israel, most of the Maronites live in the Galilee.

The Maronite compound has a hostel in addition to the church.
