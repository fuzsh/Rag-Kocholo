The Maronite Church is an Arabic-speaking sect of the Catholic Church that traces its roots to St. Maroun in the early 5th century and today is a principle religious group in Lebanon. The church’s center in the Old City consists of a two-story building that houses a chapel (the only Maronite place of worship in Jerusalem), the archbishop’s residence, priests’ living quarters and a guest house, Foyer Mar Maroun. The complex, which served as a hospital for German Protestants in the 19th Century, is maintained by the nuns of the Order of St. Therese. The Jerusalem Foundation supported renovations and the purchase of furnishings for the facility.
