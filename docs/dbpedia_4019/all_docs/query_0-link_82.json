        "text": "CV NEWS FEED // The head of the Catholic Maronite Church is calling for an end to military engagements with Israel in southern Lebanon before the country becomes further implicated with the war in Gaza.\n\n“The Gaza war has spread to southern Lebanon against the will of the Lebanese and friendly countries,” said Maronite Patriarch Behara al-Rahi on World Day of Peace last Sunday.\n\nAccording to reports, the Patriarch, who heads one of the largest Eastern Catholic rites, emphatically called for diplomatic peace negotiations in the region, citing the August 2006 Security Council Resolution 1701, which formerly negotiated a “permanent ceasefire” between Israeli and Hezbollah forces, as protection from a conflict with Israel.\n\nPatriarch Behara al-Rahi’s remarks come amidst heightened tensions between the two countries following the death of Hezbollah Radwan Force Commander Wissam al-Tawil by Israeli airstrike on Monday.\n\nAccording to AP News reports, the strike occurred six miles from the southern border, where the two countries have been engaged in military conflict for the past three months.\n\nAl-Tawil is the highest-ranking Hezbollah militant to be killed since October 7, and has been identified as a member of the special Hezbollah unit that triggered the summer 2006 war between Israel and Lebanon.\n\nThe late Hezbollah commander also fought in the 2013 civil war in Syria alongside Bashar al-Assad’s Syrian Armed Forces.\n\nThe information screens at Rafik Hariri International Airport in Beirut echoed the sentiments of Patriarch Al-Rahi’s statement on Sunday after unidentified hackers used them to project a hostile message towards Hezbollah’s leader:\n\nHassan Nasrallah, you will no longer have supporters if you curse Lebanon with a war for which you will bear responsibility and consequences.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Senator Blinkin recently made his fourth trip to Israel since the start of the war, as a part of joint efforts by U.S., European, and Arab partners such as Qatar and Jordan to prevent Lebanon from becoming embroiled in the Gaza war."
