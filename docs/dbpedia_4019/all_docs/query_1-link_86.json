        "text": "The first church was erected around 350 AD by Joseph of Tiberias and was mentioned by Egeria in 380 AD. A second Byzantine church was build in the 5th century and the church was significantly enlarged around the year 480, with floor mosaics also added at this time. In 614 AD the Persians destroyed this Byzantine church and after this destruction, the exact site of the shrine was lost for some 1,300 years. In 1888 the site was acquired by the German Catholic Society for Palestine (Palästina-Verein der Katholiken Deutschlands) which was associated with the Archdiocese of Cologne. An initial archaeological survey was conducted in 1892, with full excavations beginning in 1932. These excavations resulted in the discovery of mosaic floors from the 5th-century church, which was also found to be built on the foundations of a much smaller 4th-century chapel. The current church, inaugurated in 1984, was built to the same floor plan as the 5th-century Byzantine church, and in a simple neo-byzantine style. On 17 June 2015, an auxiliary building next to the church was significantly damaged by an arson attack committed by Jewish extremists. in what Israeli officials have labeled as \"terror attack'.\n\nThe Cathedral of St. James lies in the Armenian Quarter of the Old City of Jerusalem. The Cathedral still has two chapels dating to 420 AD but the main part is a 12th-century cathedral compound that houses the seat of the Armenian Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem. It is a unique building and one of the few intact Crusader churches in Israel and it is decorated with the famous Armenian style tiles (blue and white). The church is dedicated to Saint James the Apostle (one of the Twelve Apostles) whose head is believed to be buried in the church but also to James the Just, the brother of Jesus who probably became the first Bishop of Jerusalem.\n\nOne of the oldest inhabited monasteries in the world is the beautiful Saint Sabbas monestery founded in 483 AD bij Saint Sabbas. Saint Sabbas the Sanctified (439–532) was a cappadocian-syrian monk and priest who founded several monasteries, The saint's name is derived from Aramaic: סַבָּא‎ Sabbāʾ meaning \"old man\". At the age of 27, Sabbas moved to Jerusalem and joined the monastery of Saint Euthymius, the great who later sent Sabbas to a monastery headed by Theoctistus, where Sabbas lived for three years. After the death of Euthymius (c 473), Sabbas left the monastery and moved to live in a cave nearby. Followed by other disciples he started a Laura-style monastery. A 'laura' is a type of monastery consisting of a cluster of cells or caves where each monk lives in seclusion but contains a central church and a dining room. One of the works of St Sabbas that he wrote at the monastery is the 'Typikon'. During the Persian invasion in 614 AD, the Mar Saba monastery was damaged and restored in 629 AD. Then it was raided several times during the Ottoman era and heavily damaged in an earthquake during the 19th century but finally rebuilt with the donation from Russia. Today, the Mar Saba monastery is considered one of the oldest inhabited monasteries in the world.\n\nThe very old Church is located in the so called Muristan area in the Christian Quarter. This part of the city dates back thousands of years. It gets its name from the Persian word for “hospital” as the area was built over the ruins of the Crusader headquarters and hospital. The most visible parts of the church dates to the 11th century although the crypt dates to the Late Roman or Byzantine period (between ca. 324 and 500 CE). During the time of the Crusaders the church was used as the centre of the Knights Hospitallers (which named their order the 'Knights Hospitallers of St. John'). During the Mameluk and Ottoman periods, the church returned to the hands of the Greek Orthodox church and was renovated in 1839.\n\nThe Franciscans they first came to the Holy Land in 1217 and for 800 years they are the custodians of holy shrines, churches and they are part of daily life in Israel. St. Francis decided that the friars of his order should go out to all four corners of the world and in a short period the friars established 11 Franciscan regions, including one covering the Holy Land. Brother Elias of Cortona, one of St Francis’ earliest followers, and a small group of missionaries settled first in Israel.\n\nThe St. Louis the King Cathedral or the Maronite Church of St. Louis, is located in Haifa, It is the headquarter of the Maronite Catholic Patriarchate of Haifa and the Holy Land (Archieparchia Ptolemaidensis Maronitarum in Terra Sancta). It was built by Ibrahim Nasrallah and Salim Khoury and was dedicated to St. Louis IX of France (1214-1270). The construction of the church began 1883 and after interuptions it was completed in November 1889.\n\nBaram has an beautiful ancient synagogue but also an old church that belongs to the eastern Catholic Maronite community dating from the beginning of the 19th century. Due to the sites proximity to the Lebanese border, the community was evacuated during the 1948 War of Independence. Present day members of the community today live in the nearby village of Gush Halav, Haifa and other Christian Galilean villages in the area. The church is used on Sundays and other Christian holidays as well as for special occasions such as weddings. The community has petitioned the courts for a return to the area, but their case has yet to be resolved.\n\nThe Church of Mary Magdalene is an Orthodox Christian church on the Mount of Olives and near the Garden of Getsemane in Jerusalem. A beautiful traditional \"Muscovite\" style was used in the onion-domed design of this Russian church. It was build in 1888 by Tsar Alexander III and his brothers to honour their mother, Empress Maria Alexandrovna of Russia. The church is part of the Convent of St. Mary Magdalene, a sisterhood established in 1936 by an English convert, and since 2007 part of the Moscow Based Russian Orthodox Church.\n\nThis Catholic nunnery houses a church, an hospice and an international learning center and was completed in 1862. The convent Óur lady of Zion' was founded in 1857 by Marie-Alphonse Ratisbonne, He was a French Jew and former atheist who converted and became a Catholic priest. The altar of the church of Ecce Homo was build over the left and lower part of the Roman 'Ecce Homo' Arch. The higher part of this (in the middle of this drawing) is still part of the Via Dolorosa. The Convent now houses a pilgrims guesthouse and a library.\n\nConvent of the Lady of Zion originally was aimed at converting Jews to Christianity (although without using much force of pressure and with more respect for other faiths than what was common in the 19th century). During WWII some members of the Lady of Zion congregation in France and Italy helped to save many Jews (and are mentioned in the 'Rightious amongs the nations' records) and after WWII peacefull coexistence en mutual understanding of Christians and Jews became a main goal even before the 'Nostra Aetate' was declared by the Catholic Church.\n\nThis site that started as a place for pilgrims travelling to Jerusalem is an important symbol for Christians and it serves as a open interfaith meeting place. 1882 large groups of pilgrims began coming to the Holy Land under the direction of the French Assumptionists. The experience gained from there pilgrimages prompted the religious to build a center to host French pilgrims. The building would be known as Notre Dame de France. ​When its first cornerstone was laid on June 10, 1885 by French Catholic Assumptionist priests, it was one of the first buildings to be built outside of the Old City walls. In 1888, Notre Dame received its first pilgrims. The cornerstone of the Chapel was laid during the Eucharistic World Congress of 1893. The Chapel was consecrated the following year. In 1904, after twenty years of ongoing construction, the guest house was completed and crowned with the great statue of the Virgin Mary, a replica of Our Lady of Salvation in Paris. The Notre Dame wants to be neutral place of openness and respect of all faiths and religions within Jerusalem.\n\n​\n\nA Byzantine monastery was built here by the Empress Eudocia between 431 to 438 to house the relics of the first christian martyr Stephen. According to the Acts of Apostles, Stephen was once a Hellenistic Jew who started to preach the teachings of Jesus to the people of Jerusalem and Hellenistic Jews. A renowned evangelist, he was tried for blasphemy against God and the Jewish laws around 34 AD and was stoned to death by an angry mob. The monastery was destroyed by the Persians, rebuild by St. Sophronius and then restored and enlarged by the Crusaders. They however destroyed the church themselves to prevent it to fall into the hands of Saladin. In the nineteenth century the French Dominicans acquired the site of the ancient ruins of the Crusaders, and after archaeological excavations built the convent and current basilica, which was consecrated in 1900. Tombs dating back from the 8th to 7th century BC have been found under the ruins. When the French Dominicans bought the site they uncovered a crypt. To date, over 15,000 human bones and fragments have been found here, many dating from the 5th to 6th century when the Byzantine Monastery stood. Some beautiful mosaics from this structure can still be seen on the floor of the modern basilica.\n\nThe architect Antonio Barluzzi (1884-1960), Italian by birth, had holy architecture in his blood. His maternal grandfather was the architect responsible for the maintenance of St. Peter’s Basilica. For many years he considered entering a seminary. On the advice of his spiritual mentor and encouragement of his older brother Giulio, already an architect, he entered the engineering school to study to become an architect. Barluzzi designed an Italian hospital in Ottoman Jerusalem. In 1918 as a sergeant in the Italian army took part in the allied entry into Jerusalem. Barluzzi was asked by the Franciscans to design and build churches atop the ruins of Byzantine and Crusader churches that had been destroyed or fallen into disrepair during the Ottoman period. Thanks to the genius of the architect Barluzzi most of the Franciscan sanctuaries were rebuilt. His first designs were on Mount Tabor and in the Garden of Gethsemane. Barluzzi dedicated his life to the Holy Land, designing nine new Sanctuaries on behalf of the Franciscan Custody of the Holy Land. In total Barluzzi built or restored 24 churches, hospitals and schools between 1912 and 1955.\n\n​"
