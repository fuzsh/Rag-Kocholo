        "text": "Maronites in Palestine are a mix of indigenous people who lived in the country and converted, and people who moved to the holy land from Lebanon in the past centuries. Maronites today live in several towns and cities in the holy land, says Lora Tannous from Palestine.\n\nNAZARETH\n\nMaronites in Nazareth exist since 1630s when Latin priests asked Maronite construction workers from Mount Lebanon to help building churches and renovate old houses in Nazareth.\n\nIn the 1700s, Daher ElOmar, A Palestinian leader that fought Ottomans and took independence in the Galilee, encouraged Christians to move to his rule area to empower the Christian presence especially in towns that are important in Christianity such as Nazareth.\n\nMany Christians including Maronites moved and settled in Nazareth. They built their first Church in 1774 and named it St. Anthony. A new bigger church was built lately to serve the 1k+ maronites in the in the city.\n\nHAIFA\n\nPresence of Maronites in Haifa date back to the 1600s after the majority of them moving from Lebanon. The current maronite church in Haifa dates back to 1890, and it is the Maronite Patriarchate of the holy land, named after St. Louis.\n\nIn 1945, number of maronites in Haifa was 4193. In 1948 more than 3/4 of them had to flee war, tensions and zionist attacks and move outside the country. Today around 3-3.5k maronites live in Haifa, many of them are from other villages I will talk about them later.\n\nAKKA\n\nMaronites in Akka exist since the beginnings of the 16th century. They established a church in 1751 and still using it till now under the name of “Our Lady of the Rosary” church.\n\nKFAR BIRIIM\n\nKafr Biriim was a town in the northern Galilee that had a population 98% maronites before it was depopulated and demolished by zionists in 1948. The town today has more than 3k descendants living in Haifa, galilean towns & Lebanon. They always visit and advocate for their return.\n\nISFIYA\n\nIsfiya, a town in mount Carmel has a Maronite population of 250 Maronites, the majority of them moved from Sarba, Lebanon in the 1800s. They have a Church named after Saint Charbel and the church has one of his relics.\n\nJERUSALEM\n\nJerusalem has a minority of around 30 maronite families. They worship in the Maronite convent in the old city.\n\nAL-MANSOURA\n\nSt. John the baptist Maronite church in Al-Mansoura village after it was depopulated and destroyed by the Hagana in 1948. Mansoura was a small Maronite town in Acre near the Lebanese borders, many of the residents were from Matar family.\n\nJISH\n\nThe town of Jish has around 2k maronites, some of them are from town and others are refugees from Kfarburum. First Maronite family that settled the town was Lahoud that came from Lebanon. They worship in 2 churches, our lady church (an ancient one) and Mar Maroun church (new one).\n\nJAFFA\n\nThe Maronite Church of Jaffa. Not sure how many maronites live in the city but what I know is that they’re a tiny minority.\n\nBETHLEHEM\n\nDespite the fact that there is no history maronite population in Bethlehem, Saint Charbel maronite monastery is one of the most active churches in the city and the fastest growing!"
