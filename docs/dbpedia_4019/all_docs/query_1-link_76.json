        "text": "This week’s News from the Orient:\n\nDiscovery of a Byzantine Church in the Negev\n\nThe remains of a 1,500-year-old Byzantine church have been uncovered during archaeological excavations in the Negev desert, in southern Israel.\n\nConducted by the Israel Antiquities Authority, the excavations have also led to a second discovery: the remains of ships carved into the church walls.\n\nThe engravings were made by pilgrims visiting the holy sites to tell the story of their arrival.\n\nThese discoveries offer a glimpse into the world of Christian pilgrims who traveled to the Holy Land 15 centuries ago.\n\nThe Christian presence in the Negev continued until the 8th century, at which point mosques began to be constructed.\n\nArmenia recognizes State of Palestine\n\nOn Friday, June 21, the Armenian Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced the recognition of the State of Palestine.\n\nWhile this decision was applauded by Türkiye, it also affects relations with Israel, which have been strained since 2020.\n\nArmenia criticizes the Israeli state for its arms sales to Azerbaijan, which reportedly played a major role in the September 2023 offensive against Nagorno-Karabakh.\n\nThe Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs reacted strongly to Armenia’s decision, summoning the Armenian ambassador for a reprimand, without providing further details.\n\nCardinal Pietro Parolin’s visit to Lebanon\n\nThe Vatican Secretary of State, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, attended a \"spiritual summit\" at the Maronite Church headquarters in Bkerké, Lebanon, on Tuesday, June 25.\n\nLebanese representatives of Christian and Muslim communities responded to the call of the Maronite Patriarch, Cardinal Bechara Rai, to emphasize the importance of coexistence and interfaith cohesion.\n\nWhile many Christian and Sunni religious leaders were present, representatives of the Shia community were absent, highlighting the increasingly strained relations between Maronites and Shias."
