        "text": "There are so many layers to unpack from this visit as we met with Christians, Jews, Muslims, government officials, Church leaders and journalists who are working on the local ground with the Philos Project to help promote dialogue, positive engagement and peace in the Middle East. One of the things I observed firsthand was the pluralistic landscape of Israel and the intricate and complex situation and dialogue that is occurring between Christians, Muslims, Jews, Palestinians and Israelis as they “strive” to peacefully co-exist.\n\nIn addition to visiting the holy sites of Bethlehem, Jerusalem, Nazareth, and Magdala to name a few, our focus for this trip was to learn more about the Christians and their role in the Middle East. Unfortunately, due to the lack of political stability, persecution, ongoing discrimination, and poor job opportunities, thousands of Christians are leaving Israel and other places in the Middle East to seek security and stability. Today, Christians are a minority of less than 2% of the population in Israel. After hearing from Christians in their own villages about their daily struggles, I have come to see even more why we need to materially and spiritually support Christian families. Their impact and presence in the Middle East are a much needed witness, especially in the areas of education and healthcare.\n\nEach day, I found myself switching gears from a tourist visiting the holy sites to a servant visiting various places such as Saint Rachel’s Center for refugee children. Also, being present in attentively listening to the difficulties of Christians who seek to be free, to be seen, to be heard, to be accepted and to have their human dignity and rights recognized and respected. In these vulnerable and raw moments, the group bonded, as various people expressed their heart-breaking stories.\n\nOn a final note, it was such a privilege to take your intentions with us as we remembered each of you in our liturgies, and especially in Bethlehem. We were blessed to celebrate Mass at the Field of the Shepherds and to venerate the actual place where Jesus the Christ was born. As a group we joyfully praised God and sang Christmas carols to remember the gift of Jesus’ birth. “Joy to the World” and “Away in a Manger” will have a special meaning for me this Christmas and for the rest of my life.\n\nSr. Therese is a member of the Congregation of the Maronite Servants of Christ the Light"
