        "text": "Jish (AsiaNews) - On 10 October, the town of Jish celebrated a historic and happy event, something not seen for 100 years: the ordination of one of its children, belonging to the Maronite Catholic rite: Fr. Sandy Habib. The solemn liturgical service of ordination took place at four in the afternoon, the large parish church was full, and many people had to stand outside. Many priests concelebrated the Mass, presided by Maronite Bishop of Haifa, accompanied by two other bishops, one of Greek Catholic -rite and one of the Latin rite.\n\nFr. Sandy Habib completed his theological training at the Studium Theologicum Salesianum, in the monastery of Ratisbonne in Jerusalem, where the Salesian Pontifical University has its campus. He was an excellent student and seminarian and earned his bachelor's degree in theology. Fr. Sandy lived with the Salesians, not having a diocesan community nearby, becoming part of our community.\n\nJish is a thriving town in the Upper Galilee. Its name in Roman times was \"Giscala\", it was home to one of the most fanatical and radical organizers of Jewish revolution against Rome (66-70 d. C.): John of Giscala. Hebrew historian Josephus wrote of his life and his activities in Giscala and Jerusalem during the revolution. Captured by the Romans, John was taken to Rome and died in prison.\n\nJish has a long history of more than 3 thousand years, which began with the settlements Canaanites. Its location atop a hill, the fertility of the fields around and the good climate it enjoys much of the year make it an ideal place to dwell for different peoples and religions (Canaanites, Jews, Christians, Muslims and Druze). Jish survives on agriculture, especially the production of oil, wine and fruit. John of Giscala was a rich oil merchant.\n\nPresently its population (3,000) is predominantly Maronite Catholic and Greek Catholic Christians (55% and 10% respectively), with a Muslim Arab minority (about 35%). Maronites are the Catholic Christians named after St. Maroun, a Syrian monk who died in 415. They are largely present in Lebanon with most being of Lebanese-origin.\n\nThe melodious choir filled the air with its religious songs, and the Salesian seminarians of Ratisbonne also sang at communion. The entire town participated in the event. It was a feast for everyone and many guests came to join this wonderful ceremony. Among them were members of the Salesian Community of Ratisbonne (Jerusalem) where the Salesian Pontifical University of Rome has it's Jerusalem Campus.\n\nThe service lasted two hours, with the presentation and appropriate commentaries of the parish priest and the homily of the bishop. Several members of deacon Sandy's family took an active part in the celebration as readers and acolytes. The parents, brothers and sisters of Sandy were in the first pew to the left, accompanied by the rest of his large family. To the right of the altar was the place for the priests and the Salesian students.\n\nOne could sense the presence of the Holy Spirit in the long, beautiful and solemn celebration. At the end of the celebration the people came forward to greet the newly ordained priest. There were scenes of great cordiality and faith.\n\nFollowing the service, outside the church there were a series of felicitations for Fr. Sandy, which included: music, songs, tambours, the lifting of plastic globes, a cappella choir... An atmosphere of joy and excitement prevailed among all those present: children, young people and adults. It was the feast of all.\n\nA refreshment was prepared for all those present and people passed in a long file to greet Sandy and his family for more than an hour. Finally the guests had an abundant dinner in the large venue around the church. Songs, music, congratulations and good cheer was the climate that everyone breathed in a general expression of joy and satisfaction.\n\nMay the Lord be blessed for this grace that has descended upon Fr. Sandy, upon the town of Jish, upon all those present and upon the entire Maronite community.\n\n* Spanish Salesian Priest, professor of Scripture and Biblical Archaeology at the Studium Salesianum Theologicum Ratisbonne, Jerusalem, and author of several books."
