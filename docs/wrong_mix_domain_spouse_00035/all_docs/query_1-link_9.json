        "text": "The former Blue Peter host and beauty queen broke the news of her pregnancy on Twitter after she and husband Will Corrie shared it with their families.\n\nThe Bangor woman, who married Will five years ago, said they had decided the time was right to start a family but that she hadn’t expected to fall pregnant so quickly.\n\nAnd Zoe (41), who lost her mum Priscilla in 2016, described the moment she told her dad Joe as “bittersweet”, but said she felt her mum’s presence with her all the time and drew comfort from that.\n\nSpeaking to the Belfast Telegraph, a delighted Zoe said: “I’m still a bit overwhelmed about it all.\n\n“It feels quite surreal. Every day I wake up feeling so happy and content.\n\n“Will and I have been together for 10 years and married for five.\n\n“We’ve done a lot of things together; we’ve had career highlights in that time and we’ve travelled the world.\n\n“We talked about starting a family and agreed the time was right, but I didn’t think it would happen straight away.\n\n“We know how fortunate we are to be in this position and feel so grateful and blessed.\n\n“It feels really good to be able to share the news with everyone.\n\n“I’ve always been good at keeping secrets, but this is one special secret I’ve been dying to share.”\n\nZoe and Will, who both come from four-children families, told their parents first before talking to their siblings. Their loved ones were thrilled for them and Zoe says there were plenty of tears.\n\n“We told my dad first and he said he was very pleased but to be honest, I think he was quite surprised too,” she said.\n\n“As a family, we never talked about having children or mum and dad becoming grandparents. There was no pressure or conversations like that.\n\n“They just let us live our lives and do what we felt was the right thing for us.\n\n“I know my dad was thinking of my mum when I told him.\n\n“My brother has a little girl, Lucy, who’s two years old and who was born after my mum passed away, so this will be my dad’s second grandchild.\n\n“Of course mum was on my mind when I told dad.\n\n“She loved children; she had four of us under the age of five. She would’ve been an amazing granny and it would’ve been lovely to share this experience with her. But I feel her presence all the time. Throughout the first few days, when I was feeling a bit sick, I kept seeing butterflies and other little signs. That gave me great comfort.”\n\nZoe’s baby will be born next spring and although she and Will don’t know the gender yet, the couple are already making lists of potential names.\n\n“We have a boys’ list and a girls’ list and I’m loving being able to work on that and think about the nursery and things like that,” said Zoe.\n\n“I’m feeling great at the moment and can’t wait for my bump to get bigger. I want it to be a big bump.\n\n“We are both so excited at the thought of this magical new addition to our family. It’s a real fairytale moment for us after such a crazy year and a half and we are so pleased we can share this lovely news with our families and friends.\n\n“We see this pregnancy as a lovely gift and the timing is just perfect for us.\n\n“I really couldn’t be any happier.”\n\nAmong those passing on their congratulations on Twitter was fellow TV presenter Pamela Ballentine.\n\n“What lovely news. I’m absolutely delighted for you both. Many congratulations,” she said.\n\nThe DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson added: “Congratulations to both of you. Fab news.”"
