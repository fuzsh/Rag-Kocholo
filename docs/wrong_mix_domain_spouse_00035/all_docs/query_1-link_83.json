        "text": "Sarah Lancashire and her husband Peter Salmon have set up their own production company, Via Pictures, to develop their own TV shows. After more than 35 years as an actress, the 59-year-old will now have a more prominent role behind the scenes in her new career move.\n\nDiscussing the company with Express.co.uk and other press, the Happy Valley actress said: “We’re developing drama, purely drama, nothing else at the moment.”\n\nWhen asked whether fans can expect shows similar to the award-winning BBC series, Sarah replied: “No, we have a few things in development which is nice.”\n\nAs for whether it’s easy working with her spouse, Sarah said gleefully at the Rose D’Or Awards: “Yes, it is actually,” and agreed that “chemistry” and knowing what “each other likes” helps to make the process a success.\n\nLast year, Sarah became a producer on the explosive third and final series of Happy Valley.\n\nA source told The Sun in February 2023: “She is going to be in huge demand, but it's important to remember she has also had a lot of creative say behind the scenes on the plot and the way Happy Valley was filmed.\n\n“Sarah's husband, Peter, is one of the most respected and well-liked TV executives in the industry. By setting up a company together they are going to not only be in big demand, but also hugely successful.”\n\nPeter, 67, has been in the television industry for more than 40 years and his credits include Crimewatch, Cold Feet (1997) and BBC Sport.\n\nThe pair met when Sarah was starring in Coronation Street as Raquel Watts while Peter worked for the show’s producers.\n\nThe Julia star previously claimed that the only reason she wed Gary was because she fell pregnant.\n\nShe told The Telegraph in 2001: “I got married only because I was pregnant. Simple as that.\n\n“I am a very traditional girl and was horrified at the thought of having a child out of wedlock. I didn't want a child of mine to be different or have fingers pointed at.\n\n\"It all seems ridiculous. Now, I just tell people to get lost, and it feels great. But my marriage lasted for 10 years, which was 10 years longer than it should have done. It was tough.”"
