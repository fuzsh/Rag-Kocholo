        "text": "With her good looks, successful television career and handsome new husband, Zöe Salmon appears to lead a charmed life.\n\nYet for more than half her life the 36-year-old, best known for presenting the children’s show Blue Peter and winning hearts on Dancing On Ice, has struggled to cope with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), an unpleasant condition which affects the digestive system.\n\nOfficially, IBS is a list of symptoms rather than a disease in itself and typically it is associated with abdominal pain and spasms, erratic bowel movements, bloating and wind.\n\nIBS is twice as common in women, although this may in part be because they are more likely to seek help, and is usually diagnosed between the ages of 20 and 30.\n\nIn Zöe’s case it causes violent stomach upsets that strike without warning, agonising abdominal cramps, fever, uncontrollable diarrhoea and sometimes vomiting.\n\n“Nobody wants to talk about this condition. It’s embarrassing. There is certainly nothing glamorous about IBS,” says Zöe, who grew up in Bangor, Northern Ireland. “Toilet habits are taboo, yet when you have IBS they are a constant worry.”\n\nZöe’s problems started when she was 17 and working in a shop after school, while studying for A-levels.\n\n“Towards the end of one of my shifts I got these horrendous stomach cramps,” she recalls. “They were so bad I couldn’t breathe properly. I started getting hot sweats, then I went cold and collapsed in the toilet.\n\n“The manager phoned for my parents, who were about three miles away, and they came to get me. By then I was in too much pain to be embarrassed.”\n\nAfter that first time, Zöe had similar attacks every few months. Her GP suspected food poisoning or a food allergy and suggested she stopped eating spicy foods. Yet even though she took the advice the attacks kept coming, lasting for up to 12 hours on each occasion.\n\nShe says: “I know everyone is different but for me it feels as if there’s some sort of blockage in my bowel and my body has to release it. It takes hours to flush everything out but once the attack is over I feel as if a new day has come. It’s such a sense of relief.”\n\nIt was only when she was in her 20s that Zöe realised that it might be IBS. “I’d read about IBS over the years and then one day the penny dropped.\n\n“I realised the symptoms I read about were happening to me. People think IBS is constant but it can come and go.”\n\nDuring her time as a regular host on Blue Peter between 2004 and 2008 and taking part in Dancing On Ice in 2009, Zöe was fearful her tummy troubles could strike while she was live on TV.\n\nInvalid email\n\nWe use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

There’s no question.\n\n“For that reason I was always careful about what I ate before a show. I’d have a banana and a drink of water. My diet was very plain and healthy. I was extremely lucky it never happened to me at work. It tended to happen more on holiday when I was eating and drinking what I liked.”\n\nIronically her last attack occurred on her way home after participating in Celebrity Island With Bear Grylls in February this year, to raise funds for the charity campaign Stand Up To Cancer.\n\nThe show, filmed on a remote Pacific island, saw Zöe lose a stone in weight, dropping to 7st 8lb (she’s 5ft 7in tall), after the presenter survived two weeks.\n\nSo when she and the rest of the cast made it to a hotel when the fortnight was up, she devoured everything in sight, from fizzy drinks to club sandwiches, burgers, chocolate and crisps.\n\nShe says: “I hadn’t eaten for so long and I was so skinny. I ate everything and then I got on a flight from Panama to Amsterdam. I was at the airport in Amsterdam, waiting for my flight to Belfast, when the pains started.\n\n“I made it to the toilets but if you had offered me a million pounds, I couldn’t have crawled out of there. I thought I’d miss the flight. Ninety per cent of the time I just get diarrhoea but every now and then I get sickness as well. In Amsterdam I got both. “\n\nAfter three hours I got a reprieve and managed to get on the plane but as we took off, my stomach went crazy again and I had to race to the toilet.\n\n“I was scared that I’d be arrested because I couldn’t return to my seat for landing and I was worried I wouldn’t be able to get off at the other end. Yet I managed to get off and get home. The whole episode lasted 14 hours.”\n\nJust before she’d left for the island, Zöe had been asked to try a natural, over-the-counter probiotic called Alflorex, made by Irish firm Alimentary Health.\n\nAs Celebrity Island programme makers stipulated participants couldn’t take anything with them, she left the supplement at home. However on her return she started taking it before her wedding to fiancé William Corrie.\n\n“I liked the fact it was natural but I was sceptical,” says Zöe. “I’d taken probiotics over the years because I’d believed that if my gut was healthy my IBS would ease, but it never did. I was getting married in six weeks and I was dreading my wedding day and honeymoon being spoilt by IBS so I thought anything was worth a try.”\n\nAlflorex contains elite bacterial strains which have been clinically proven to relieve symptoms such as stomach cramps, bloating and irregular bowel habits.\n\n“It’s a tiny tube of powder that I can mix with water or put in a smoothie,” explains Zöe. “On my wedding day I ate whatever I wanted without any nasty consequences.\n\n“And on honeymoon I had pizza, ice cream and prosecco just about every day and I still didn’t have any problems.\n\n“At first I thought it was too good to be true but I have now gone seven months without an IBS attack. “That’s the longest I’ve ever been free of it since I was 17.\n\n“It has given me a new lease of life because the constant worry of having to be near a toilet has gone.\n\n“I know the pain, the worry, the embarrassment and the fear that goes with IBS but now I’ve found something that works for me.”\n\nA month’s supply of Alflorex costs from £29.95.
