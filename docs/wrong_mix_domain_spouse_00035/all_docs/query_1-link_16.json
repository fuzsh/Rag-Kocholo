        "text": "FORMER Blue Peter presenter Zoe Salmon has married in a secret ceremony in Barbados.\n\nThe former Miss Northern Ireland tied the knot with William Corrie after eloping.\n\nMr Corrie (30) is a popular Co-Down butcher who asked the 36-year-old model and actress to marry him while they holidayed in Barbados last November.\n\nThe new Mrs Corrie was one of Northern Ireland's most eligible bachelorettes until her surprise wedding.\n\nShe recently turned the DUP down when the party invited her to stand in the East Belfast constituency for this week's Assembly elections.\n\nHowever, she has not ruled out a politicial career in the future.\n\nThe 36-year-old told Hello! about her private nuptials at the exclusive Sandy Lane beach resort, which boasts A-listers like Rihanna and Oprah Winfrey as fans.\n\nIt is also the resort where golfer Tiger Woods got married in 2004.\n\nShe said: \"I can't wait to get home and tell everyone. I didn't even tell my mum and dad, although running off to get married does run in the family so they will be thrilled for us.\n\n\"We'll have a big party when we get home, I'm sure of that.\"\n\nShe added: \"I want an excuse to wear my dress and feel the magic again.\"\n\nRevealing her wedding details exclusively to Hello!, she disclosed her dress of choice was a beaded gown with a long train from wedding designer, Berta.\n\n\"When I saw Zoe arrive I thought, 'Wow!'\", Corrie said, of seeing his bride in her dress.\n\nSalmon added: \"What was so lovely was that every single conversation we had that day was with each other. It was really intimate and we had so much space to breathe and take in every special moment.\""
