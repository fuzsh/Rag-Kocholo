        "text": "The former Miss Northern Ireland and her son were visiting Knotts Bakery to support Zoe’s husband, William Corrie, while Queen Camilla visited the bakery.\n\nBut the Belfast toddler quickly stole the show on the day, after being featured across the front pages of some of the world’s press.\n\n“It’s really lovely, he’s just the nation’s wee sweetheart for the day,” Zoe explained.\n\n“It’s been a great, nice positive experience, we really went down to support Fitz’s daddy.\n\n“As a family we were delighted to be there and see the Queen Consort but we didn’t anticipate any of the media attention for Fitz.\n\n“We really can’t believe the attention he is getting.\n\n“He’s been on the front cover in the papers, it’s just been brilliant and if he isn’t on the cover, he is in the next few pages.\n\n“And it’s across the range of papers too, it was the cover of The Times and The Mirror so it’s across both broadsheets and tabloids.”\n\nZoe thinks Fitz was so sociable as a result of how warmly Queen Camilla greeted the toddler.\n\n“She was so lovely. She asked his name and commented on his wee tux and I think he just automatically felt really at ease around her.”\n\nZoe said she wasn’t surprised by how sociable Fitz was during the visit.\n\n“He was loving the environment, he is such a wee boy, he loves exploring and being in the thick of everything, so he really loved it,” she said.\n\n“I think it was the Queen that said ‘oh he’s a natural’ and then someone else said ‘we have got a future royal correspondent here’ so everyone was really lovely and it was just a lovely atmosphere for everyone.”\n\nZoe’s main hope is that the videos and photos from the bakery can help brighten everyone’s day.\n\n“We just take it as a bit of fun, during a time when the news is full of such sad and serious things.\n\n“It’s just a wee bit of fun, a toddler in a tux.”\n\nAt Knotts Bakery, the Queen learned how a team of skilled bakers continue to use traditional baking methods with no machinery involved.\n\nIn 2022, the Corrie family, a third-generation family of butchers and farmers, purchased the business, which now employs 120 people.\n\nHowever, William isn’t even slightly jealous that his son stole the spotlight away from the achievements of his bakery, according to his wife.\n\n“We went down to support Knotts, to support the business but we are just delighted with everyone’s response to Fitz, we are proud parents,” Zoe added.\n\n“We are just so mad that everyone is getting to see a little bit of what we see on a day to day basis so we are just sitting back and smiling like proud parents.”\n\nZoe admits though that sometimes even she is surprised by Fitz’s sociable nature.\n\n“He loves it all, he loves going out and about, he is very sociable and very chatty, even though he is not even two and he doesn’t have many phrases yet.\n\n“I often think ‘where do you get this from?’ and people will laugh and say ‘it’s obviously you’ but I don’t think it is. I just think it’s our Fitz, he’s got his own wee personality.”\n\nWhen asked if she thinks Fitz will follow in her presenting footsteps, Zoe admitted she wasn’t quite so sure.\n\n“Fitz can do whatever he wants to do, we will fully support anything that he wants to do.\n\n“I have done a mixed bag of things and I have so many happy memories from it all, so if he wanted to go along the way of presenting then we would fully support that. Even during my law days, I always saw law as a performance, so I could see him performing in a court.”\n\nWhatever industry he goes into, Zoe is excited to tell him all about the time he stole the spotlight from the Queen while she was visiting Belfast.\n\n“In years to come, we will be able to show him all the footage,” Zoe added."
