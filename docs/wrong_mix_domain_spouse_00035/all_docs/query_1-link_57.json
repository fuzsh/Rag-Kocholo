        "text": "Restaurants are inherently local affairs. Want proof? Seattle is just a few hours away, but despite covering food and drink for a living, I can count the number of Emerald City chefs I know by name on two hands.\n\nThere’s Matt Dillon, the former Sitka & Spruce chef (not the “Singles” actor), who spends most of his time farming these days anyway. And Shota Nakajima, whose Taku I visited in 2021, but whom I mostly know because I profiled Portland’s Sara Hauman during her “Top Chef” run, and the two are buds. And Renee Erickson, whose restaurants (especially steakhouse Bateau, doughnut shop General Porpoise and oyster bar The Walrus and the Carpenter) have been quietly influential in Portland."
