        "text": "Yesterday the former Miss Northern Ireland and Blue Peter star revealed online that she was engaged to Co Down butcher William Corrie.\n\nThe 35-year-old posted a photograph of her hand in that of her fiancé's- complete with diamond engagement ring - taken on a beach in Barbados at the start of the month.\n\n\"I would like to share this wonderful surprise news with you all...\" she wrote on Twitter and Facebook.\n\nLast night Zoe told the Belfast Telegraph: \"I am on cloud nine. I have had so many texts and messages of congratulations.\n\n\"We had kept it to ourselves until now to give us a chance to tell all our relatives and close friends.\n\n\"But we were bursting to tell everyone.\"\n\nZoe met William (30), a butcher from a farming family in Newtownards, at a friend's wedding at Castle Leslie in April, 2011. They fell in love and on November 1, William's birthday, he asked Zoe to be his wife while on a romantic holiday on the Caribbean island.\n\n\"He got down on one knee at our favourite beachfront hotel, Sandy Lane,\" Zoe explained. \"I am a really private person, even though I am in the public eye, so William, knowing me, knew I would like it that way.\n\n\"We ordered a beautiful three-course meal and dined out on the balcony. He lifted the silver cover of the plate to reveal the ring and a single red rose surrounded by rose petals. It was lovely.\"\n\nZoe said the square cut diamond on a platinum band, designed by William, was \"the most beautiful piece of jewellery I have ever seen\" and goes well with her \"gorgeous husband-to-be\".\n\n\"We hadn't talked about marriage, so when he proposed I was really surprised, and when he presented the ring I was doubly surprised,\" she added. \"It looks amazing. I am in awe of the fact he wanted to be traditional and asked my parents - Joe and Priscilla - in advance. I am a traditional girl.\"\n\nThe couple want to marry soon but no details have been confirmed as yet, except that the wedding will be in Northern Ireland next year.\n\n\"There are so many beautiful places I have been fortunate to travel to, but I am such a home bird, it has to be at home,\" Zoe said.\n\n\"I love it. One of the things I love most about William is that he is Northern Irish. He is a local boy, so it is important for us to get married at home.\"\n\nOn top of wedding planning, Zoe has a busy work schedule.\n\nShe is in London this week, hosting Penguin publishing house events with authors and then she will be appearing in pantomime next month in Windsor.\n\nZoe is a huge fan of the monarchy and hopes some of the royal family might pop in to see her as Cinderella at the Theatre Royal in the town from December 2.\n\n\"It is right beside Windsor Castle,\" she said.\n\n\"I am delighted to spend the festive season in such a beautiful part of England. It is a beautiful part of the world.\n\n\"I hear that if any of the royals are going to watch a panto, that is where they go.
