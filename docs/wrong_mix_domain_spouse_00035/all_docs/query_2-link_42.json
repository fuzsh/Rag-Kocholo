        "text": "A woman who was mentally and physically abused by her partner for two years has told the BBC she is trying to rebuild her life after he was jailed.\n\nZoe Castle's former boyfriend Marc Masterton, 26, pleaded guilty to coercive and controlling behaviour against her.\n\nHe had already been sent to prison for 41 months last year for the same offence against another partner.\n\nChloe Holland died in hospital after trying to take her own life.\n\nZoe said it was hearing about Chloe's experience that finally gave her the confidence to officially report Masterton to police.\n\nThe 24-year-old said she wished she had known \"what she was going through because I definitely would have tried to help in any way I could\".\n\nShe said: \"I think it would have helped her if she knew she wasn't the only one that was going through that, and that there is light at the end of the tunnel, you can get away from it.\"\n\nZoe met Masterton when they were at school and they began dating in 2017, when she was 18.\n\nShe said there had been a honeymoon period when he moved in to her flat in Southsea, Hampshire, where she was living with her young daughter.\n\n\"He just became very violent, very quickly,\" she said.\n\n\"One of the first times he slapped me, he was crying and he was really apologetic that he didn't mean to do it and I forgave it - but since that time it didn't stop.\"\n\nShe explained that she believed \"that was my normal\", adding: \"I believed it was my fault, I was the one that made him do those things.\n\n\"He would always make me feel like I was the one to be blamed and that if I just didn't say anything, he wouldn't have done it.\"\n\nZoe called the police several times after being assaulted by Masterton and body-worn camera footage from attending officers showed some of the injuries she suffered.\n\nBut she said she was too afraid to ever make a formal complaint against him.\n\nTheir relationship ended in 2019 when Masterton was sent to prison for an unrelated offence.\n\nIt was not until 2023 that she found out Chloe had also been abused by him.\n\nZoe said: \"I went so hot and all my body hairs just flew up and that's when I realised that it's not just me.\"\n\nChloe's mother Sharon previously told the BBC that her daughter, from Portsmouth, had taken her own life after a year of torment from Masterton.\n\nSince then, she has been campaigning for perpetrators of coercive control to face manslaughter charges if their victims take their own life.\n\nZoe said she contacted Sharon after hearing about her daughter's death and they have been able to offer each other emotional support.\n\nShe said she was gradually rebuilding her life and seeing a psychiatrist to support her mental health but said the damage caused by Masterton was long lasting.\n\n\"I have good days but I also have a lot of bad days,\" she said.\n\n\"It sticks with you when that is all you know. Mentally, you don't know anything but violence and abuse, you don't know anything else.\"\n\nKnowing Masterton has been jailed has given Zoe some comfort, she said, but she believes he would be a danger to other women if he was released."
