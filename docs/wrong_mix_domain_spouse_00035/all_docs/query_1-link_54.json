        "text": "Gethin Jones is a Welsh television presenter, best known for Blue Peter, The One Show and most recently Morning Live on BBC One. Scroll down to find out more about the presenter including all the details on his love life and what shows he has previously appeared in.\n\nHow old is Gethin Jones?\n\nGethin was born on 12 February 1978 in Cardiff, making him currently 45 years old.\n\nHe is the son of Sylvia (née Groskop), a violin teacher, and Goronwy Jones, headteacher of Baden Powell Primary School.\n\nAre Gethin and Steve Jones related?\n\nA lot of people assume that Gethin and fellow Welsh presenter Steve Jones are related in some way, however this is untrue.\n\nGethin does have an older sister called Mereid though who works for the NHS.\n\n\"My sister is my hero. She works for the NHS at a hospital and if you try to imagine the worst possible scenario - well she has seen it daily for the last year,\" says Gethin. \"She is always there for people and also there for when people pass away. She does everything with such grace and hard work.\"\n\nIs Gethin Jones married?\n\nGethin was previously engaged to Welsh singer Katherine Jenkins, but the pair split in December 2011 after getting together in 2007.\n\nThe opera singer is now married to American painter Andrew Levitas, and have two kids; Aaliyah and Xander.\n\n\"I have never given up finding the right partner for me,\" says Gethin. \"I am currently single but can you tell me how you are supposed to have dated over the last year? I have, however, never made a secret of the fact I would love to get married one day.\"\n\nWho are Gethin Jones’ exes?\n\nAlthough the Welsh presenter is currently single he’s previously dated some very high profile celebrities. Here’s who Gethin Jones has dated in the past…\n\nKatherine Jenkins\n\nGethin first began dating Welsh opera singer Katherine Jenkins back in 2007.

It was so far from the truth.\"\n\nShe is now married to American painter, Andrew Levitas, and they have two children together.\n\nLucy Mecklenburgh\n\nGethin also had a brief relationship with former TOWIE star Lucy Mecklenburgh. The pair dated back in 2014 for a few months before deciding to part ways due to busy work schedules.\n\nSpeaking to New! Magazine, Lucy said the timing just wasn’t right: “We went out a few times a while ago but it was bad timing for both of us.”\n\nShe is now married to Ryan Thomas and the pair have two children together.\n\nKatja Zwara\n\nGerman underwear model, Katja, is Gethin’s most recent romance. The pair began dating in 2017, but after just a year they decided to call time on their relationship due to their busy work schedules.\n\nWhat TV shows has Gethin Jones been in?\n\nMorning Live\n\nCurrently airing on weekday mornings on BBC One, Morning Live first aired in October 2020 as a 40-part series and is currently in its fifth series.

I mean that in the respect of not just saying, ‘Hey good show’, I mean that viewers say, ‘What about this? Have you considered that?’ We cover so much in 45 minutes and people have really jumped onto it and I feel very lucky to go to work every day on it.\"\n\nGethin Jones on Blue Peter\n\nGethin is most recognised for presenting the children's television series, Blue Peter from 2005 to 2008.
