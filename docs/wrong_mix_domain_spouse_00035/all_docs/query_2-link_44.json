        "text": "Zoe Salmon has revealed she used to drink up to eight litres of water a day.\n\nThe former Blue Peter presenter, 40, described her excessive consumption as an “addiction” and “massive episode in her life”.\n\nRead more: Drinking too much water put one woman’s life in danger\n\nSalmon thought she was giving her skin a youthful glow until she mentioned her intake to a masseuse in October, who convinced her to see a GP.\n\nThe doctor reportedly told her to “act right away”, gradually bringing her consumption down to the generally-recommended two litres.\n\nAfter doing blood and urine tests, medics do not think Salmon’s extreme water intake caused any lasting damage.\n\n“Each day I’d begin with a litre to kick-start my digestive system; I’d have another after my first coffee to balance out the effect of the caffeine and another after a smoothie,” Salmon told The Mirror.\n\n“I’d drink a litre at the gym, fill up my water bottle with another litre for the drive home and if I went for a night out and had three or four glasses of wine, I’d have three or four glasses of water to counteract it.\n\n“It’s been a massive episode in my life and I’ve felt really deflated knowing I was working so hard for my health, but what I was doing was counterproductive”.\n\nHow much water should you drink?\n\nThe government’s Eatwell Guide recommends people drink six to eight glasses of fluids a day. This can include water, milk, tea, coffee and low-sugar options.\n\nAlthough two litres of water is often touted as the go-to amount, scientific evidence does not actually back this up.\n\nThe NHS describes water as a “healthy and cheap choice for quenching your thirst”.\n\n“It has no calories and contains no sugars that can damage teeth.”\n\nRead more: Chemicals in tap water may trigger thousands of bladder cancer cases in Europe\n\nWater consumption should increase in hot weather or when exercising, which both cause people to lose more H2O via sweat.\n\nNHS Inform Scotland recommends using your urine as a guide, with a well-hydrated person producing clear or pale-yellow liquid waste.\n\nOthers advise trusting your thirst.\n\n“The control of hydration is some of most sophisticated things we’ve developed in evolution, ever since ancestors crawled out of sea onto land,” Dr Irwin Rosenberg from Tufts University in Massachusetts told the BBC.\n\n“We have a huge number of sophisticated techniques we use to maintain adequate hydration.”\n\nNote our sense of thirst becomes less sensitive with age, with elderly people often having to be more conscious of their water intake.\n\nThe risks of drinking too much water\n\nAlthough rare, life-threatening water intoxication can occur if people drink too much.\n\nThis occurs when the excessive intake disturbs the balance of electrolytes, like sodium, potassium and calcium.\n\nSodium concentrations in the serum, which makes up the liquid part of blood, then rapidly reduce.\n\nDrinking too much water in too short a space of time means the kidneys cannot filter it fast enough.\n\nThe excess water then moves via osmosis to regions where sodium levels are higher and H2O concentrations lower.\n\nOnce in cells, the vast water intake causes them to swell.\n\nBrain cells, however, are incased by the skull – with little room to stretch.\n\nRead more: Coronavirus cannot be cured by drinking 'garlic water', experts say\n\nEarly symptoms tend to be vague, like vomiting, nausea, confusion and disorientation.\n\nLeft untreated, the patient may have a seizure, go into a coma or even die.\n\nIn 2007, 28-year-old Jennifer Strange passed away after competing in a Californian radio station’s on-air water-drinking contest.\n\nAfter downing around six litres in three hours to win an Nintendo game console, Strange started vomiting, developed a severe headache and later died.\n\nIn 2005, a fraternity initiation at California State University, Chico, left a 21-year-old man dead after he was forced to drink excessive amounts of water between push-ups.\n\nMarathon runners have also been shown to have milder cases of water intoxication, with most recovering.\n\n“Exercise-associated hyponatraemia is the most common type [of water intoxication] but there are other occasions when over drinking can occur,” pharmacist Linda Antwi-Ahima told the NHS’ St Mary’s Treatment Centre.\n\n“Some people drink water in excessive quantities in an effort to feel full and to speed weight loss.\n\n“This is not a healthy approach to weight reduction and could potentially be harmful”."
