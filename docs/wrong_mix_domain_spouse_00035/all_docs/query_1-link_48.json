        "text": "Enid Pepper, aged 97, departed peacefully on February 28, 2024, at the Lethbridge Regional Hospital. She was born on September 20, 1926, in Woolford, Alberta, the daughter of Merriett Dewey Dowdle and Alice Ada Webster.\n\nEnid was the beloved spouse of Raemer England Gardner Pepper and a cherished mother to Jodie Rae (Ron Ortlieb) and Darren Raemer Pepper (LeiLian Chen). She was predeceaced in death by her sister, Alice LaRue Neilson, and brother Lloyd Rulon “Bud” Dowdle. Enid is survived by eight grandchildren: Amber, Jason (Russet Thomson), Leslie and Ashley Ortlieb and Jesse (Tara Shaw), Jordan, Katie (Eric Garner) and Zoe Pepper, as well as six great-grandchildren.\n\nBest known in Southern Alberta for her fervor for and participation in competitive sports spanning five decades, Enid engaged in track and field, softball, singles and doubles tennis, five and ten-pin bowling, curling, and golf. In recognition of her many athletic achievements across Lethbridge and Southern Alberta, she was inducted into the Cardston, Lethbridge, and Alberta Sports Halls of Fame. In the community of Cardston, where she was raised, she received the accolade of Outstanding Female Athlete of the Century for Cardston and District (1887 - 1987).\n\nFollowing the birth of their children, Enid and Rae enjoyed numerous idyllic summer vacations at Apgar Village in Montana. Eventually acquiring a cabin in West Glacier, Montana, she delighted in hosting family and friends. A devoted Los Angeles Lakers and Toronto Raptors fan, Enid never missed a Blue Jays game, a tennis match or curling bonspiel. She maintained enduring friendships spanning almost eight decades and resided in her own home until a mere week before her passing.\n\nThe family expresses gratitude to the many healthcare providers, from her homecare nurses of AHS and CBI Health to the compassionate nurses and doctors at the Lethbridge Regional Hospital. A funeral service for Enid is scheduled for Thursday, March 7th at 11:00am, at the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints at 2410 28 St. S., Lethbridge, AB. You may meet with the family prior to the funeral service between 10:00-10:45am.\n\nLive stream will be available, and a link will appear beneath the obituary 15 minutes before service time."
