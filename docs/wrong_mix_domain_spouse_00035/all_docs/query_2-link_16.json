I didn't even tell my mum and dad, although running off to get married does run in the family so they will be thrilled for us.\n\n\"We'll have a big party when we get home, I'm sure of that.\"\n\nShe added: \"I want an excuse to wear my dress and feel the magic again.\"\n\nRevealing her wedding details exclusively to Hello!, she disclosed her dress of choice was a beaded gown with a long train from wedding designer, Berta.\n\n\"When I saw Zoe arrive I thought, 'Wow!\"'William said of seeing his bride in her dress.\n\nShe added: \"What was so lovely was that every single conversation we had that day was with each other.\n\n\"It was really intimate and we had so much space to breathe and take in every special moment.\""
