She is known for her starring role as Robin Scherbatsky in the CBS sitcom How I Met Your Mother (2005–2014) and as S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Maria Hill in the Marvel Cinematic Universe superhero franchise, starting with the film The Avengers (2012).\n\nSmulders' other films include Safe Haven (2013), The Lego Movie franchise (2014–2019), Results (2015), The Intervention (2016), and Jack Reacher: Never Go Back (2016).

She then made her Broadway debut in the revival of the Noël Coward comedy Present Laughter (2017) earning a Theater World Award.\n\nSmulders was born in Vancouver, British Columbia, to a Dutch father and a British mother. She was raised in White Rock, British Columbia, and later moved to the affluent West Point Grey neighbourhood to attend high school at Lord Byng Secondary School. She was named after her great-aunt, from whom she gained the nickname \"Cobie\".[3] Smulders describes herself as \"a fluent listener\" of French.[4] She has four sisters.[5] Smulders was also a member of the Girl Guides of Canada as a child, participating as a Brownie (Girl Guide program for 7- to 10-year-olds).[6] In her youth, Smulders aspired to be a marine biologist.[4] She took an interest in theatre throughout high school and briefly studied at the University of Victoria before returning to acting.[4]\n\nSmulders worked in modeling, which she later said she \"kind of hated\", adding that the experience made her hesitant about pursuing acting as a career: \"You know, you go into these rooms, and I've had the experience of people judging you physically for so long and I was over that but, then it was like... 'Oh no, I have to actually perform. I have to do well, and I have to have a voice... and I have to have thoughts now.'\"[7]\n\nSmulders made her professional acting debut in 2002, with guest appearances in the UPN science fiction comedy series Special Unit 2 and the Showtime science fiction drama series Jeremiah. She subsequently made multiple appearances on television, including in the Fox supernatural drama series Tru Calling (2003), the WB superhero series Smallville (2003), and the Global space opera series Andromeda (2005). Smulders' first role as a series regular was in the short-lived 2003 ABC adventure drama series Veritas: The Quest, which ran for one season.

She received training from a Los Angeles SWAT team trainer to handle guns to portray the character.[11] Smulders reprised the role in three episodes of the ABC superhero television series Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.

Marilyn Stasio of Variety praised Smulders in the role writing, \"Smulders has a graceful, Cowardian air in the role, and makes Susan Hilferty’s costumes look even more fabulous.\"[18] David Rooney of The Hollywood Reporter wrote, \"Smulders looks sensational; she’s the epitome of late-’30s elegance...she carries herself with poise and assurance\".[19] For her performance she was honored with a Theatre World Award for Outstanding Broadway debut. Her performance was filmed with Great Performances and shown on PBS.[20]\n\nAlso in 2017, she portrayed the recurring character of \"Mother\", also known as Mrs. Quagmire, in the Netflix black comedy drama series A Series of Unfortunate Events, based on the book series of the same name.[21] That same year, she appeared in the comedy films Literally, Right Before Aaron and Killing Gunther.
