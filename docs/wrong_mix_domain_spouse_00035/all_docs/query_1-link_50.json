She was well known for her love of gardening, especially growing prized tomatoes, raspberries and lima beans. Nancy and Bill were also very involved in helping establish and support Urban Promise, a Christian-based charter school in Camden, NJ, where they not only volunteered their time, but were honored with the establishment of the Bill & Nancy Hall Scholarship Fund to foster education for youth in the community.\n\nNancy was extremely proud of her Swiss Heritage, obtaining her Swiss Citizenship in 2015, and loved her regular trips to her home there where she especially enjoyed hosting family and friends to share with them the beauty of the alps she so loved.

His service to the country he loved was exemplary, marking the beginning of a life devoted to both patriotism and community.\n\nAfter his military service, Lee embarked on an entrepreneurial path, demonstrating his resilience and determination. Beyond his professional pursuits, Lee devoted nearly five decades to Rotary International, embodying the organization’s motto of “service above self.” His commitment was further recognized as he served as a District Governor for Rotary, representing the greater good, even traveling to Australia in the name of service.\n\nLee was a family man at heart, finding joy in spending time with his loved ones. He is survived by his loving wife, Deborah Braddock, four sons Steven Braddock, Jon Braddock, John Leighty, Michael Vest Braddock, one daughter Kathleen Braddock, 17 grandchildren, 10 great-grandchildren, and his brother, Robert Braddock.

His love for these sports mirrored the teamwork, camaraderie, and dedication he brought to every aspect of his life.\n\nAs we bid farewell to Lee, let us remember him for his selfless service, love for family and friends, and the indelible mark he left on both his community and Rotary International. May his memory inspire us to live with the same commitment to service above self, as he did throughout his remarkable life.\n\nGertrude Betts Entwistle ’54\n\nGertrude Betts Entwistle born May 30, 1936 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, passed away peacefully on November 8, 2023, in Morristown, Tennessee at the age of 87. Affectionately known to all as Trudy, she spent her life touching the hearts of those in and around her home town of Medford, New Jersey.\n\nTrudy was preceded in death by her parents, Richard Winfield Betts and Helen Cleaver Betts, her brother Richard Van Betts, and sister Jane Strasdas. She is survived by her dedicated husband, Douglas Entwistle, and their children: daughter Kathi and David Jensen, son Brian and Mari Entwistle, and son Keith and Annette Entwistle. Trudy’s son Bruce Entwistle also preceded her in death. Trudy leaves a lasting legacy through her grandchildren: Drew Jensen, Kendall Jensen, and Hannah Entwistle.\n\nAt 16 years old, Trudy became a volunteer candy striper, igniting a lifelong dedication to selfless service as a Registered Nurse. Her extensive career as a healthcare professional, spanning over 40 years, reflects a remarkable commitment to healthcare and public well-being. She was employed at Burlington County Memorial Hospital Mount Holly, New Jersey where she served as Floor Nurse, Critical Care Nurse, and Nursing Care Coordinator. Trudy’s commitment to public service included serving in the Women’s Army Corp., The Salvation Army and other humanitarian causes in addition to her professional duties.\n\nIn her spare time Trudy volunteered as a First Responder and was a lifetime Member of the Medford Emergency Squad and a member of the Medford Lakes Emergency Squad. Trudy was a founding participant in the Paramedic Unit at Burlington County Memorial Hospital. She was a teacher at the Burlington County First Aid Academy conducting CPR training classes for the community.\n\nIn her retirement, Trudy and Doug settled in Dandridge, Tennessee, where she continued to enjoy life’s simple pleasures. Trudy was an avid reader, she also found joy in collecting miniature dollhouses, which served as a creative outlet and a source of delight for her. Her interests reflected her appreciation for the small details in life, much like her dedication to nursing and helping others.\n\nTrudy often imparted valuable life’s lessons to her grandchildren, emphasizing the importance of compromise and understanding to Hannah, or playing “Mother May I” on the back deck when Kendall was a little girl.\n\nKnown for her dry sense of humor, Trudy’s signature greeting was “Greetings and Salutations,” and her response to inquiries about her well-being was often, “I’m upright”, when frustrated, simply, “Fiddlesticks.” Her ability to unapologetically always be herself let you know exactly what she was thinking, suggesting a level of self-awareness, confidence, and authenticity that can be both inspiring and admirable, allowing those around her to understand and appreciate her for who she truly was.\n\nTrudy’s enduring legacy as a genuine hero is evident in the multitude of lives she has impacted through her nursing career, military service, volunteer work, and community outreach programs. Her narrative stands as a beacon of inspiration to future healthcare professionals and alike, showcasing the profound influence one person can wield on a community through unwavering dedication, boundless compassion, and selfless service.\n\nHer expertise and adaptability in the nursing field shone as a testament to her commitment to excellence. Additionally, her dedication to education and advocacy for life-saving skills underscores her profound sense of responsibility. Trudy’s promotion for child car seat safety and active involvement in diverse community initiatives underscores her holistic approach to healthcare. Her sincere concern for the well-being of individuals at every stage of life never wavered, emphasizing her warm intentions and steadfast ability to care for others.\n\nIn keeping with her Religious Society of Friends beliefs, we would ask that you celebrate her “inner light” in memoriam with the Quaker funeral tradition, focusing on quiet reflection and giving thanks for a life well-lived. Trudy will be remembered not only for her simplicity, peace, integrity, community, equality, service, and stewardship but also for the warmth, kindness, and laughter she brought to all who were fortunate enough to have known her.\n\nWe want to express our heartfelt thanks to each member of Life Care of Morristown, Tennessee staff, from the nurses and caregivers to the administrative and support teams. Their collective efforts created an environment that allowed Trudy to experience a sense of peace and tranquility in her final moments.\n\n1956\n\nMarianne Thompson Seto ’56 passed away on November 19, 2018.\n\nElizabeth Davis Anneseley ’56 passed away on July 21, 2023.\n\n1957\n\nRowland Ricketts ’57\n\nRowland Ricketts, Jr. passed away peacefully on April 16 at 84 years of age in Moorestown, NJ. Rowland was born on November 18, 1939, in Philadelphia, PA to Dr. Rowland Ricketts and Jean Napier Ricketts. He grew up in Merchantville with his parents, 2 sisters, and extended family. After attending St. Peter’s Choir School in Philadelphia and Moorestown Friends School, he received his BA and MA in History from Trinity College in Hartford, CT and an MBA from Washington University in St. Louis, MO.\n\nRowland had a long career in the life insurance industry, working first at Connecticut Mutual, then National Life of Vermont, and finally General American in St. Louis, MO, where he retired as Senior Vice President of Individual Operations in 1995. He loved his work community so in retirement he continued to consult for various insurance companies in the US and Great Britain. In 2017, he was inducted into the Association of Home Office Underwriters’ Hall of Fame for his work in founding the Fellows of the Academy of Life Underwriting.\n\nHe was a life-long member of the Episcopal Church starting at Grace Church, Merchantville as a child.

He attended Christ Church Montpelier, VT and Church of the Good Shepherd in St. Louis, MO where he was active in the choir and returned to Grace Church later in life.\n\nRowland loved playing the piano and genealogy. His children fondly recall waking on Saturday mornings to the sound of his fingers on the keys, filling their home with happy music. Whenever he visited a new city for work, he would call all the Ricketts in the local phonebook to see if any were related, and he travelled to England, Wales, Scotland, Slovakia, and Argentina to research the family history, connecting to distant family members who have now become close.\n\nRowland dedicated countless hours to his fight against water in their home in Merchantville. Every time it rained, he could be seen hauling hoses out to the street to pump out their driveway so the basement wouldn’t flood. His children believe that these hours of passionate labor followed by days of passionate ranting kept him full of life for years! His grandchildren referred to him lovingly as The Curmudgeon and Grumpalupigus as he found great pleasure in complaining about everyone and everything, and he did so in a way that kept us all laughing and entertained.\n\nRowland is survived by his beloved wife of 61 years, Mary-Lynn (nee Kevolic), sister Jean Ricketts, daughter Rachel Adams and her husband Lee of Cherry Hill, NJ; son Rowland Ricketts, III and daughter-in-law Chinami Ricketts of Bloomington, IN; and five grandchildren, Emily, Max, Anen, Ewan and Bren.

He experienced sudden cardiac arrest on November 19, 2023 after completing Mile 25 of the Philadelphia Marathon adjacent to the “Three Angels” statue on Kelly Drive with his “Fourth Angel”, his sister Libby, by his side. Despite the best efforts of heroic bystanders and a talented team of physicians, nurses and therapists at Penn-Presbyterian Hospital, Oscar “Ray” passed away two days later. His wishes to be an organ and tissue donor were realized and he gave the gift of a better life to multiple people.\n\nOscar, “Ray”, was a bright “Ray of sunshine” for all who were fortunate enough to cross his path. He was born in Indianapolis, IN at Methodist Hospital on May 10, 1997 as the first child of Catharine Carbonetta Mayer and Oscar Henry Mayer. He grew up in Riverton, NJ and attended Riverton School through 7th Grade. He then attended Moorestown Friends School through high school and graduated in 2015. Ray went to Camp Ockanickon every summer starting at age 7 and later became a counselor, spending his summers in high school life guarding at the waterfront and helping campers foster a love for the outdoors. Throughout these years, Ray also developed a passion for fencing and later served as a captain of the team and was the lead saber fencer at Moorestown Friends School. He also discovered his artistic talent in both the visual and performing arts as he acted in multiple plays/musicals and developed skills across multiple artistic mediums.\n\nRay went on to Ithaca College where he found his fierce passion for the environment and majored in Environmental Studies with minor in Art. During this time, he also decided to start going by his first name, Oscar. He played a pivotal role in studying and conserving the beautiful Natural Lands nature preserve on the Ithaca College campus. The time Oscar spent in the natural lands was among the many experiences that inspired him to hike the Appalachian Trail. Because of the need to start hiking in the spring, he accelerated his studies and graduated one semester early in December of 2018.\n\nSoon after, he returned to Riverton and was fortunate to meet the love of his life, Katie Corris, of Cherry Hill, NJ. They were a perfect match with their shared values of nature and travel, and they became inseparable from the start. Their love was strong enough to sustain a 5-month separation during Oscar’s Appalachian trail adventure, relying on GPS texts and letters sent in resupply boxes to nurture their connection.\n\nOscar and Katie’s love flourished as they seamlessly integrated into each other’s lives. They settled in Haddonfield, NJ in a cozy apartment with their two cats, Bean and Basil, and their dog Banjo. Their mutual love helped them grow into two beautiful people. Oscar and Katie enjoyed many local activities together with friends and family like taking hikes with Banjo and enjoying local breweries. They also cherished time spent visiting family across the country which took them to places such as Oregon, the Chesapeake Bay, and Florida. Oscar and Katie also volunteered on multiple veterinary relief missions to Central and South America. Oscar’s gentle manner and positive energy made him a crucial part of the animal care team.\n\nAfter the Appalachian trail, Oscar stayed connected with his passion for the outdoors and served as a nature educator at Fernbook Farms in Chesterfield, NJ. He then continued his environmental efforts at the State of New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection where he made many friends and was a valued co-worker. Oscar’s work most recently included spearheading a grant program which aimed to improve air quality by reimbursing the installation of electric vehicle charging stations throughout the state.\n\nOscar enjoyed an extremely active lifestyle and his love for running began in high school where he ran cross country. Running became an outlet for Oscar. In October of 2022, he completed the Marine Corps Marathon in Washington, DC. He trained extensively for his marathons, competing in multiple half-marathons, 10-milers, 18-milers and he completed an Olympic triathlon earlier this fall. Oscar also completed multiple MS 150s alongside his dad during his time in college.\n\nOscar “Ray” has left behind his great love, Katie Corris, his parents Catharine Mayer and Hank Mayer, his sister Libby Mayer, his grandparents, cousins, and many loving friends. Oscar “Ray” embodied kindness, generosity, and compassion. His authentic smile and warmhearted spirit were infectious. There will be a celebration of his life to come in the future. For those interested in supporting Oscar “Ray”, charitable donations can be made to the Oscar Raymond Mayer Memorial Fund at Ithaca College, which will support current and future students who share his passion for the outdoors and the environment.\n\nMFS Community\n\nKenneth Banks\n\nFather of School Committee Member Kenette Banks ’02\n\nKenneth Earl Banks was born in Camden, NJ on May 13, 1934. As the youngest child of Claude Banks and Carrie Banks (née Coward), Kenneth was the baby of their seven children, born into a family of history makers. His brother, John Banks, was a pitcher for the Negro National Baseball League and Negro American Baseball Leauge and his other brother, Horace Banks, was a Motor Mechanic on the U.S.S. Mason – the only all-Black warship to sail in WWII. With these as his guides, Kenneth understood that it was in his blood to make a positive impact on the world. Throughout his life, he made his own history in Camden and across his community.\n\nKenneth started working at Gene’s Pharmacy in Camden, NJ after school when he was 13 years old with then-founder and owner Eugene “Gene” L. Kleinfeld. Gene took a liking to Ken and he worked part-time at the store until graduating from Camden High School in 1955. After graduating, he worked at the pharmacy full time and attended the Philadelphia College of Pharmacy in Philadelphia, PA. Kenneth later took over as owner and ran the pharmacy for the next 30+ years. Gene’s Pharmacy was one of the cornerstones of Camden and everyone knew Mr. Kenny.\n\nKenneth served in the U.S. Army as a Private from 1956-58. He was stationed at Monterey Bay, California at Fort Ord and traveled to Germany as a part of his military service. On June 14th, 1969, he married Sarah Delores Cousin, his wife of almost 50 years. Together they had one daughter, Kennette Alysia Banks, (born in 1984).\n\nKenneth was a consummate entertainer. Throughout their marriage, he and Sarah’s home in Mt. Laurel was the gathering spot for birthdays, Christmas brunches and dinners, and numerous community and family events. The winner of multiple baking competitions at church, Kenneth could often be found in the kitchen, making something delicious for his guests and family.\n\nIt’s likely that Kenneth got his start as an entertainer in the early ’60s as a part of the social group, The Magnificent Seven. Over about nine years, the group -which also included Louis “Lou” Walls, Fred Pratt, Donald “Ducky” Burts, and Paul Martin- promoted shows, concerts, and events and brought some of the biggest names of the day in the music industry to Camden, NJ and the greater Philadelphia area. The Magnificent Seven’s impressive list of entertainers and talents featured the likes of Stevie Wonder, Chuck Jackson, LLoyd Price, Tommy Hunt, Kenny Gamble (Gamble & Huff) and the Romeos, Jimmy Smith, and Junior Walker & The All Stars, among others. In April of 1968 the group organized a citywide “Cindy Day” to honor Cynthia “Cindy” Birdsong, after Cindy joined the international singing group, The Supremes.\n\nKenneth enjoyed many honorary titles throughout his life: he was “Uncle Kenny” to some, “Unc” to others, father to one, and friend to many. He attended Nazarene Baptist Church in Camden, NJ with his father before becoming a member of Kaighn Avenue Baptist Church in Camden and later Second Avenue Baptist Church in Moorestown, NJ. Through his pharmacy, his entertaining, and his role as an active community member in Camden and Moorestown, Kenneth made his corner of the world that much better. Before his passing on October 11, 2023, Kenneth was preceded in death by Claude Banks, Jr., Horace Banks, John Banks, Mildred McCollum (née Banks), and Bertha “Mae” Thomas (née Banks). He leaves to further celebrate his life, his daughter, Kennette Banks, sister, Eleanor Wayman, numerous nieces and nephews, cousins, special friends (Chaka Pratt, Paul Martin, Charity) and many other family members and dear friends.\n\nDinesh Desai\n\nFormer School Committee member; Father of Aani ’22 and Haila ’24 Desai\n\nDinesh Desai, age 74 of Moorestown Township, passed away peacefully in his sleep at home on March 27, 2024. He was born in Vatar, India, a small village in the state of Gujarat. With a loan from his uncle and Dinesh’s brilliance he went on to attend and graduate from IIT in Mumbai in Chemical Engineering. He then attended Montana State University in Bozeman, Montana graduating with a Master’s in Chemical Engineering. This forged his lifelong love of Montana and the Big Sky area. Dinesh furthered his education over the years to include an MBA from Temple University.\n\nDinesh had an amazing, successful career in business, working for ARCO chemical which brought him to the Philadelphia area where he began a life of entrepreneurship. Using his business genius and personable nature, he left ARCO and purchased Western Sky Industries and then Emtec, Inc. He was a leader and played an integral part in growing the companies into thriving businesses.\n\nDinesh was a self-proclaimed sportaholic, being an avid golfer, tennis player, and skier. He spent hours outdoors in his backyard hitting golf balls rain or shine.\n\nHe led an amazing life. His smile warmed the room and made everyone at ease.

In 2014, he was inducted into the New Jersey State Martial Arts Hall of Fame. He continued to work boxing and MMA events until 2023.\n\nWhen not ringside, Steve could be found rinkside, cheering on the Philadelphia Flyers, as a 30-plus year season ticket holder. Steve was a super fan of field hockey and women’s lacrosse, especially teams his daughter Lizzy played on or coached. He never missed a game and was a fixture on many sidelines over the years.\n\nThere was not a craft or jewelry show Steve did not attend in the greater Philadelphia area, nor a Motown or Classic Rock concert he missed. He loved to travel to Las Vegas and nearby Atlantic City and Philadelphia to hone his poker skills and visit his family and friends.

She was 93. In recent years, Mom lived at St. John’s in assisted living. The family is very grateful for the compassionate care St. John’s provided to both Mom and Dad (and to Anne’s mother fifty years ago). Anne was born to Gertrude Kemper Best Held and Jacob Henry Held on November 2, 1928, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, the middle of three children and only daughter. She attended Moorestown Friends School in Moorestown, NJ, and Smith College in Northampton, MA. Shortly after returning to Milwaukee, she met her life partner, Roy LaBudde, and together they built his law career, advising small and medium sized businesses and their families, with mom often called on to entertain clients and law partners on short notice. After marrying dad in 1952, mom gave birth to three boys: Peter (Barbara), Michael (Frances) and Jack (Sue). Deedles, Mikey, Gackies and their spouses all survive her. Still hoping for a daughter, mom was inadvertently blessed with identical twin girls, Susan and Sarah (James) Wolffe, only a few days after she learned she was carrying twins. (Scrupulous about treating Dude and Sissy equally, mom sent identical letters to the girls at camp, alternating who received the original, who the carbon copy, starting with Sarah). They raised their family in Bayside. Anne was preceded in death by her steadfast loving husband Roy, her two brothers Robert and John, great-granddaughter Emma, dear brothers-in-law Donald LaBudde and William Brunsell, son-in-law Brian Akers, nephew Robert Held, and too many friends to mention. Further survived by eight grandchildren, three great grandchildren, her dearest sister-in-law Thea LaBudde Brunsell, and beloved nieces and nephews including Bill and Thea’s better-behaved kids, son Paul (Meribeth) and daughter Ann (Gery), who are as close as her own. Mom loved architecture and designed the homes they built for their growing family and retirement. She was an excellent, canny golfer, and co-ran a successful gift-shop for almost 20 years with some friends. As a mother, mom was the uncomplaining, patient, and calm center amid the typical LaBudde-family exuberance, impetuousness & untamed rough-and-tumble. Mother was serene amid rambunctiousness, even when meals devolved into competition, experiments and food fights. While her children were often charmed by bad ideas hastily executed, mom was graced with forbearance. Her hands-off parenting style totally fit the 1960s & 1970’s suburban vibe. After the girls staged a sword fight on the mansard roof (with family heirloom sabers) for a home movie, mom and dad simply padlocked the attic door. A son —who shall not be here named— playing William Tell with his new bow-and-arrow set, shot a tennis ball clean out of the mouth of the trusting neighbor boy across the street (after the girls declined the opportunity). As a helpmeet, sister-in-law, and friend, Mom was a pro at hosting parties, holiday celebrations, cocktail parties, and vacations, pulling together meals and travels flawlessly, time and again. Over the years we skied out West, station-wagoned across the country (5 kids, no seat belts, unlimited bubble gum), and went up north. She schlepped us to hockey games and wrestling meets, field hockey and track, ski races and hospitals ERs. Mom and dad launched us all through college into professional lives, debt-free. Mom often led or expressed by action and example, rather than words. A steady rather than adventurous cook, we children still recall the Chicken Breast Decade and the Salmon with Soy Sauce Decade, confidently deployed after the first, tentative early days of broiled-hamburger-on-toast. She made the most out of onion salt. Her one care package sent to college (when Sarah asked) was a box of cake mix. Above all, mom and dad knew how to have—and share—joyful fun. Together they cultivated many cherished friendships, cemented through travel, parties, bridge games, theater trips, tennis, meals, and volunteer work. She and dad embodied generosity and hospitality. Holiday meals routinely included friends and extended adopted family, especially our beloved “uncle Jack,” Jacob Bernheim, dad’s law partner and friend, and dad’s childhood friend Dick Evans. There was always, always room for an extra seat at the table. Mom and dad were true & loving partners, dad always grateful he got to “marry up,” as he put it, contrasting his homespun, Germanic-Lutheran “peasant” origins with mom’s “classier” ones. Mom’s passing was gentle and peaceful as her local children and spouses shared her final hours with stories, moments of quiet reflection, and laughter, with us drawn even closer together under the quiet shelter of her departing but enduring love. The family requests no flowers, but memorials to St. John’s or Christ Church of Whitefish Bay. Memorial service planned for early May, details to be posted on Jelacic Funeral Home website. To send flowers to the family or plant a tree in memory of Anne Poyntell (Held) LaBudde, please visit our floral store.\n\n1949\n\nMargaret Ann Warwick ’49\n\nSister of David Warwick ’55\n\nWe are sad to announce that on April 11, 2023, at the age of 91, Margaret Ann Warwick (Marlton, New Jersey) passed away.

After several years working for the state of Pennsylvania, the US Census Bureau, and the American Friends Services Committee (the charitable arm of the Quaker community), Susan was hired by Doubleday in Washington, DC, to arrange local interviews and appearances with nationally touring authors and to filter unsolicited manuscripts before sending the best on to the New York office. She met Warren through a mutual acquaintance in 1969; they married in 1972 in the Quaker Meeting House of Harrisburg, PA, the wedding having been postponed for a week because of flooding in the Susquehanna River from Hurricane Agnes.\n\nSusan was recruited away from Doubleday to work for the burgeoning newsletter industry in 1982, specifically as a DC correspondent for a newsletter that was reporting on the Iranian American Claims Tribunal.

He attended Mater Dei High School in Middletown and then proceeded to earn a bachelor’s degree at the University of Dayton, a master’s degree at the University of Tennessee, and a doctorate in clinical nutrition at Case Western Reserve University.\n\nHe began his career at the Tennessee Dept. of Public Health, focused on maternal and fetal nutrition, and from there moved into teaching clinical nutrition at several universities. He finished out his career in the field of medical writing across the greater Philadelphia area.\n\nTom was the first in his family to attend college, and his enthusiasm for education never waned. The friendships he formed at Dayton remained some of his most treasured for over 50 years. He spent his 20s in Tennessee, and during these formative years, he made many memories, lifelong friendships, and met Martha, his dearest friend and wife of 35 years. He would later describe this time as some of the best years of his life. Martha and Tom raised their three daughters, Molly Claire, Rosemary Kathleen, and Catherine Jane in Cleveland Heights, OH; Greenville, NC; and Sewell, NJ.\n\nHe was a self-proclaimed baseball “junkie,” avid college basketball fan (“Go Flyers”), and an aficionado of music of all kinds. He had many passions, including delicious food, the arts, and nature, in particular birds and flowers.\n\nA loyal friend, a devoted husband, and adored father and grandfather, Tom was considered a gentle soul by those who knew him. He was truly one of a kind, and as he would say, he “marched to the beat of his own drum.” He was genuine, compassionate, and generous to all. Above all else, he felt his greatest accomplishment was his family.\n\nHis family will miss his special way of looking at the world, his unique humor, and his ability to endear himself to all who met him.\n\nHe was the beloved husband of 35 years to Martha Reilly (nee Savage).

Her indomitable spirit prevailed over seven years of declining health until her heart finally failed her.\n\nFrom her birth in 1932 in Moorestown, NJ, she maintained a rootedness in her origins and the Quaker religion in which she was raised. Her life reflected her commitment to community – to both lifelong and recent friendships; to the natural world explored on vacations at her beloved “second home” in the Poconos; and to service for others. Her busy life as a homemaker in suburbs of northern New Jersey, Boston, Philadelphia and finally Wilmington included both serious tennis and volunteer services – to Cub Scouts, Abington Friends School, Philadelphia public schools and her PEO sisterhood, for which she served two terms as chapter president. She was a dedicated supporter of Hockessin Friends Meeting, Moorestown Friends School (class of 1949) and Mount Holyoke, which she served for many years as class of 1953 treasurer.\n\nRemarkably optimistic and playful by nature, Molly had a gift for providing solutions to problems simple and complex, thanks to her native thoughtfulness, curiosity and keen mind – a blessing to her often impatient husband Richard. Her all-pervasive interest was for her family, and she took special pride in the accomplishments of son Christopher, daughter-in-law Heidi, grand-daughters Naomi and Rachel, and nephew Robert Blood, along with loving memories of departed parents Dorothy and Robert Wood, sister Peggy Blood, brother-in-law George Blood and niece Deborah Blood. Her final days were enhanced greatly by the care of the Cokesbury Village medical staff and Hospice team and the support of her affectionate friends.\n\n1953\n\nZoe Tsigounis ‘53\n\nZoe M. Tsigounis, beloved daughter of Constantine (Gus) and Sophia V. Chigounis, peacefully passed away on December 10, 2022 after undergoing heart valve surgery at the Onassis Clinic in Athens.

She went to elementary school in Merchantville and graduated from Moorestown Friends School in 1953. She then attended Goucher College and graduated from the University of Pennsylvania. Zoe’s father had emigrated to America from the village of Elika, located in Laconia, southeastern Peloponnesus, when he was eleven years old. In the summer of 1953, Gus returned to Greece with his family for vacation. On that trip, Zoe met Michael Tsigounis, the man she would marry. Michael’s family owned large tracts of agricultural land mostly dedicated to the production of olives in the area of Elika. He put aside his career in law to manage the family’s lands. After meeting on vacation, Zoe and Michael continued their correspondence and eventually decided to wed. In the summer of 1958, they were married at the St. George Greek Orthodox Cathedral in Philadelphia. Soon after the wedding the couple returned to Elika, where Michael managed the family estate and Zoe enthusiastically devoted herself to village life. In 1936, Zoe’s father had built a house by the sea in the village of Marathia with the intention of spending summers there when he retired. This house is where Zoe found her true joy in life. She loved to entertain, not only relatives but friends from all over the world. At Zoe’s house, strangers became friends and friends became family. All were welcome for excellent meals, intellectual conversations, the latest gossip, and advice and remedies for various ailments, doled out by Zoe with her characteristic wit and warmth. After Michael’s death in 2012, Marathia became her fulltime residence. From here, she managed Tsigounis olive operations. She also loved the sea and swam on a daily basis well into her eighties. She is survived by her brothers, Anthony C. (Mary) and John C. Chigounis along with many loving cousins, nieces and nephews. Besides her husband, Michael, she was predeceased by her parents, Gus and Sophia Chigounis.

He was born on a farm in Albion Township, North Dakota, on July 11, 1925. Though he went to live with relatives in Wisconsin at age 16, his home state left an indelible mark. He recorded a patchwork of these early memories in his book “Crazy Quilt”, as well as in a memoir “Born On The Prairie and Thereafter.”\n\nIn 1943, Alan graduated from Sheboygan High School, and enlisted in the Navy. After training at Purdue University and Oberlin College, he served as a radarman aboard the U.S.S. Chenango (CVE-28) in the Asian Pacific.

Dunn passed away in Vero Beach, FL on Dec 23, 2022. Judy was born in Philadelphia, PA, on September 3, 1931, and attended Springside School, graduating in 1949. She was an exceptional athlete, earning 9 Varsity letters in three sports. Thereafter, she worked in a secretarial pool and attended Hahnemann Hospital School of Nursing in Philadelphia, before marrying John Struthers Dunn, Jr. in 1953. She returned to Hahnemann as the kids grew, and finished her RN degree in 1978. Over their 58-year marriage, Judy and Struthers lived in Philadelphia, PA, and in Haddon Heights, Haddonfield and Moorestown, NJ before moving to Vero Beach, FL. They spent summers in Strathmere, NJ. After Struthers retired in 1985, they traveled the world, and spent the coldest months in Rincon, Puerto Rico. Strathmere, though, was Judy’s Happy Place. For many years, she spearheaded the annual July Fourth Parade, and she was an enthusiastic, loyal founding member of the locally infamous Roundbottoms. When Judy and Struthers relocated to The Racquet Club in Vero Beach in 1997, she played tennis for years and coordinated many lively social events. They both were deeply involved in music ministry at Community Church of Vero Beach for many years, where both played Hand Bells, and Judy sang in Choir. Struthers died in 2011, and in 2016, Judy moved to Indian River Estates. She is survived by her five adult children, 6 grandchildren, and 2 great-grandchildren.

He was very proud of the fact that he was the only person who ever graduated from Yale with a Bachelor of Science in English Literature. He attended Columbia University’s College of Physicians and Surgeons where he met the love of his life, fellow medical student, and future renowned Philadelphia radiologist Mary Stuart Blakely. While dating, they entertained themselves by dressing up in evening attire and crashing fancy Manhattan weddings. They married in 1950 and were each others’ true loves, mutual admirers, and life partners until Mary Stuart passed away in 2006. A Columbia faculty member wrote of him, “This young man’s personality is way off the beaten track, and cannot be evaluated by the customary methods.”\n\nAfter training at the Pennsylvania Hospital in Philadelphia where he was Chief Resident in Medicine, and spending a year at the NIH, he opened a practice in Endocrinology on Spruce Street where he practiced for fifty years. He also consulted regularly for the employees of Strawbridge and Clothier as well as the Hospital for the Mentally Retarded at Stockley, Delaware. He was beloved by his patients, his guiding philosophy being the adage, “Listen to your patient – he’s telling you his diagnosis.” His patients also told him their stories which gave him an education in all things Philadelphia, the city he passionately loved and which he went on to chronicle in his online blog, Philadelphia Reflections. Many of these blogs were adapted into a history-oriented tour book, Philadelphia Revelations: Twenty Tours of the Delaware Valley.\n\nHe was a true Renaissance Man, interested in everything and everyone, remembering everything he read or heard in complete detail, and endowed with a penetrating intellect which cut to the heart of whatever was being discussed, whether it be medicine, history, literature, economics, investments, politics, science or even lawn care for his home in Haddonfield, NJ where he and his wife raised their four children. He was an “early adopter.” Memories of his children from the 1960s include being taken to visit his colleagues working on the UNIVAC computer at Penn; the air-mail version of the London Economist on the dining room table; and his work on developing a proprietary medical office software using Fortran. His dedication to patients and to his profession extended to his many years representing Pennsylvania to the American Medical Association.\n\nAfter retiring from his practice in 2003, he started his pioneering “just-in-time” Ross & Perry publishing company, which printed more than 300 new and reprint titles, ranging from Flight Manual for the SR-71 Blackbird Spy Plane (his best seller!) to Terse Verse, a collection of a hundred mostly humorous haikus. He authored four books. In 2013 at age 88, he ran as a Republican for New Jersey Assemblyman for the 6th district (he lost).\n\nA gregarious extrovert, he loved meeting his fellow Philadelphians well into his nineties at the Shakespeare Society, the Global Interdependence Center, the College of Physicians, the Right Angle Club, the Union League, the Haddonfield 65 Club, and the Franklin Inn. He faithfully attended Quaker Meeting in Haddonfield NJ for over 60 years. Later in life he was fortunate to be joined in his life, travels, and adventures by his dear friend Dr. Janice Gordon.\n\nHe passed away peacefully, held in the Light and surrounded by his family as they sang to him and read aloud the love letters that he and his wife penned throughout their courtship. In addition to his children – George, Miriam, Margaret, and Stuart – he leaves his three children-in-law, eight grandchildren, three great grandchildren, and his younger brother, John.\n\nAndrew Hauty\n\nhusband of MS/US French Teacher Jobi Dan’Sy and father of Lia ’33, Beckett ’36, and Quinn ’36 Hauty-Dan’Sy\n\nAndrew F. Hauty, 68, of Marlboro and Medford, NJ, died on January 6 after a series of medical complications that led to respiratory failure. At the time of his death, he was surrounded by his family.\n\nAndy was best known for his fun-loving and plucky spirit. He was spontaneous, joyful, and always up for a game, idea, action or shenanigan. He had a gift for helping those around him feel appreciated, valued, and uplifted. He had a rollicking, contagious laugh, which he deployed many times a day, in all contexts.\n\nBorn in San Antonio, TX, on January 30, 1954, Andy spent most of his youth in Newark, DE, and attended the University of Delaware where he studied criminal justice. After graduating, he worked for the Criminal Justice Council in Wilmington, DE, where he focused on special programming alternatives to incarceration. In 1989 he moved to New England and earned his MS in Education from Antioch New England Graduate School.\n\nHe went on to become a career educator, teaching at Townshend Elementary School, The Center School in Greenfield, MA, and Windham Southwest Supervisory Union, where he served as director of Wings Community After-School Programs as well as coordinator for the Deerfield Valley Community Partnership to prevent drug and alcohol abuse.\n\nAndy’s boundless energy, imagination, and creativity were especially evident when it came to producing his one-of-a-kind youth theater productions. These extravaganzas were executed against many odds via extraordinary vision, hard work, and can-do attitude: Rewrite lyrics to popular songs? Sure! Write in 12 more parts? OK! Add a few new dance numbers to highlight certain cast members? Check! Outrageous costumes? Of course! Circus acts? Why not!\n\nNo idea was too daunting for these immersive, innovative productions which were fueled by Andy’s faith in the young performers and the community that surrounded them.\n\nAndy also spent joyous time in the care and keeping of his vast lavender gardens and off-the-grid house, which he built and adored in Marlboro. A natural athlete, Andy ran cross-country and spent a year with the national team for modern pentathlon. He was an avid swimmer from a very young age and swam regularly all of his life, no matter where he lived, including a memorably chilly and gutsy swim to Alcatraz Island.\n\nAndy loved action, especially in nature. He and his wife Jobi shared a passion for rock climbing and most especially loved the Shawangunks of New York and Red Rocks of Nevada. He loved bike touring, hiking, and camping. He, Jobi, and his children Lizz and Lucia enjoyed wilderness canoe adventures in Maine, the Canada Maritimes, and Algonquin Provincial Park.\n\nAndy spent most of his free time dreaming about his next travel adventure. He and Jobi lived abroad in Panajachel, Guatemala, for several years where they taught school and eventually founded Panajachel Colegio Internacional. Recently Andy, Jobi, and their children Lia, Beckett, and Quinn lived for two years in Bordeaux, France where they enjoyed van camping trips around Europe. In 2021, they moved to New Jersey where Andy continued to have dance parties with his children, swim as often as possible, work in the garden, and make his family laugh their butts off.\n\nAndy loved deeply and was loved in turn by his family and many friends. He is survived by his wife Jobi; five children, Lizz, Lucia, Lia, Beckett, and Quinn; grandchildren Hayden, Ariana, and Luca; siblings Mike, Kathy, and Chris; sister-in-law Rose; nieces Savannah and Heather; nephews George and Jackson; parents-in-law Peggy and Art; first wife Jodi; his good dog Sebastien; and his cat Dog. Andy was preceded in death by his parents George and Patricia, and father-in-law Herb.\n\nA public celebration for Andy will be held Saturday, May 27, at 2 pm at Memorial Hall in Wilmington. Please come prepared to celebrate Andy with that magically wild spirit that he could bring out in all of us. How to do that? We suggest donning tutus, flashy sunglasses, colored wigs, Hawaiian shirts, and… well, just surprise us in true Andy fashion!\n\nIf you have a favorite picture or story to share, bring it along for our interactive scrapbook.

Although not a school day, “Dr. Heath,” as his students called him, chose to leave this world right as the dismissal bell rang at 3:00pm.\n\nSandy was born in Pasadena, California on Halloween Day in 1934. For the next 88 Halloweens, he loved to dress up in costumes and famously handed out Heath candy bars to friends and neighbors including those in Swarthmore, PA, which he considered to be his hometown, before moving to Marinette, WI as a teen. A star athlete in track and field, football, and basketball in high school, Sandy next traveled to Hanover, NH for college. After graduating from Dartmouth with a degree in Sociology he and Susan Lee Redington, who he’d met on a blind date in Cape May, NJ, were married on September 14th, 1957. The first few years of what would become their 60-year long marriage were spent in many different neighborhoods. They lived in Baltimore, MD; Media, PA; Dallas, TX; and Pine Bluff, AR before moving to New Jersey in the early 1970s. During those years, Sandy earned his Master’s degree in History from Temple and his Doctorate in Educational Administration from the University of Pennsylvania. Much more importantly, “Susandy” also celebrated the births of their three daughters (Suellen Riffkin, Jenny Heath, and Lisa Dainton) during this time period.\n\nBefore moving to Medford Leas in 2006, Sandy and Sue made their home in Moorestown, NJ for over 30 years. As a teacher, administrator, and track coach at Moorestown Friends School,\n\nSandy was most proud of creating and implementing innovative programs like City Project and Intensive Learning which got students out of the classroom to explore Philadelphia and many other environments. Also committed to the broader community, Sandy served in many roles including being elected to the Moorestown Public School Board in 1978, clerking a number of Moorestown Monthly Meeting (Quaker) Committees, and serving on the board of Camp Dark Waters in Medford. He and Sue belonged to two book clubs, travelled regularly in retirement, and helped to organize groups and activities during their many happy years at Medford Leas.\n\nSandy will be greatly missed by his sister Barbara Morrison and his sisters-in-law Harriet Heath, Dell Redington, and Ellie Redington as well as his brother-in-law, Jim Redington. Papa / Uncle Sandy will forever be remembered by his seven grandchildren (Rebecca and Sophie Riffkin; Cole and Andy Pollard; and Sam, Zach, and Luke Dainton) and his many nieces, nephews, and grand-nieces/nephews for his ability and willingness to organize fun events and activities including miniature golfing, orienteering, building sand castles, and playing cards and board games.\n\nDad will be both remembered and missed by his three girls for his love of making to-do lists and plans, whether simply for the next hour or for more detailed and extravagant trips and parties; for making speeches (complete with props and other visual aids!) at family meetings; for setting a cheerful example of thoughtful integrity; and most of all for the steadfast care\n\nand support he gave to our mom and to us throughout our lives. Enjoy your final bike ride home, Dad!\n\nGail Hohweiler\n\nmother of Joan Hohweiler Herzog ’86\n\nGail Cresci Hohweiler, age 84, passed away early in the morning of April 4, 2023, in Baltimore, MD after a lengthy illness.\n\nGail was born in Vineland, NJ to the late Joseph and Mildred Cresci. She was a graduate of Vineland High School and Rosemont (PA) College. Following the sudden death of her husband, George Hohweiler in 1992, she decided to go do all the things she hadn’t had a chance to do while being a superb wife and mother. This included moving to Boston and then Florence, Italy where she ran a successful wine tour operation for over a decade. When that became tiresome, she returned to the United States and her beloved Jersey Shore, continued to travel (checking every box on her list except Cuba), and even had time to organize and host Stowe, Vermont’s first wine and food festival. While impressively independent and always on the move, she always had time for her children, relatives, and four grandchildren should they need it.\n\nGail is survived by her brother, Joseph Cresci, her two children Joan (Hohweiler) Herzog and John Hohweiler, her grandchildren – Jackson, Alex and Tighe Herzog and Kathleen Hohweiler, and various nieces, cousins, and nephews.\n\nIn lieu of flowers or donations, Gail would want you to pour yourself a nice Tuscan red wine and book a trip somewhere nice.\n\nCondolences may be shared with the family at www.wbfuneralhome.com\n\nMary Cloud Hollingshead\n\nwife of Wickliffe Hollingshead ‘56\n\nMary Cloud Hamilton Hollingshead, 83, passed away on February 5, 2023 in Clarksboro, N.J. with her beloved husband of 61 years, Wickliffe Hollingshead, at her side. She was the eldest daughter of the late Mary Cloud Bosworth and William Henry Hamilton of Denver, Colo. Her proudest accomplishment was her family, including her two sons Wickliffe Stewart Hollingshead, II (Janet) and William Keith Hollingshead (Eileen); five grandsons Austin Martin, Hunter Quinton, Nolan Peaslee, Ryan Martin, and Matthew Stewart Hollingshead; four step grandchildren Eric, Alyssa, Brian and Lauren Salera; and sister Adnée de Mobrey Hamilton. In addition to her parents, she was preceded in death by her sister, Virginia Bosworth Hamilton Ammons.\n\nMary Cloud was born and raised in Denver, Colo. and spent summers in Bourbon County, Ky. with her grandparents on their 9-generation family-owned farm. She lived in Norfolk, Va. while Wick served in the Navy before moving to Southern New Jersey.\n\nShe graduated from Graland Country Day School, East High School, and Mary Baldwin College where she met her future husband on a blind date. Her Graland teachers instilled in her a deep and lasting curiosity of history, and her biology studies in college stimulated an interest in genetics. This educational foundation led to a life-long fascination of historic preservation and family genealogy. Her roots trace back to some of the Founding Families of America. She loved her rural setting on the first road in America with views that reminded her of Kentucky, and she delighted in learning about the historical significance of the Delaware Valley.\n\nMary Cloud loved people and parties, and she sparkled at social occasions. She was among the first class of debutants at the Denver Symphony Ball, and she continued to dance miles across the globe with Wick throughout their marriage. She was kind and generous to her many friends, had an adventurous spirit, and enjoyed traveling. She and Wick planned grandparent trips with each grandson to share the wonders of the real West she knew and always loved.\n\nMary Cloud was active in numerous charitable organizations and was a hard-working committee member. She served as past President of the National Society of Colonial Dames of America in the State of New Jersey, Colonial Daughters of the 17th Century, and President of the United Daughters of the Confederacy. She also belonged to the Junior League of Philadelphia and Garden Club; National Society Daughters of 1812; Welcome Society of Pennsylvania, Descendants of Founders of New Jersey; Society of Daughters of Holland Dames; Swedish Colonial Society; and Daughters of the American Revolution.\n\nPatti Dee Hopton\n\nformer School Committee member; mother of Ted Hopton ’80\n\nPatti Jane Dee Hopton, age 84, died on 9/28/2022, in Medford, NJ. An excellent student, Patti was valedictorian at South Bend Central High School (1956), graduated from Wellesley College (1960, Biblical Studies), and took graduate courses in Library Science. In 1960 she married Lester Hopton and had two children: Ted (1961) and Jeremiah (1964).\n\nHer spiritual journey was central to her life and it inspired her to work actively for housing and marriage equality. She had eclectic skills and recreational interests, including sewing, raku pottery, children’s literature, Gregorian Chants, collecting teddy bears, doing jigsaw and crossword puzzles, and spending summer vacations in New England. She adored the work of Maurice Sendak, loved pandas, and doted on her cat, Jethro.\n\nPredeceased by her parents, Tommy and Betty Dee, she is survived by her two sons, Ted Hopton and Jeremiah Gold-Hopton; her daughter-in-law, Karen Gold; two grandda"
