Pablo Neruda Biography

Early Life and Education

Pablo Neruda, born Ricardo EliÃ©cer NeftalÃ­ Reyes Basoalto on July 12, 1904, in Parral, Chile, was the son of JosÃ© del Carmen Reyes Morales, a railway worker, and Rosa Basoalto, a schoolteacher who died shortly after his birth. Raised in Temuco by his father and stepmother Trinidad Candia Marverde, Neruda showed an early interest in literature. He attended the local Boys’ School and later the Temuco Girls’ School, where poet Gabriela Mistral, a future Nobel laureate, was the principal and encouraged his literary pursuits.

Literary Career

Neruda adopted his pen name in honor of the Czech poet Jan Neruda to avoid conflict with his family’s disapproval of his writing career. His first collection of poems, “Crepusculario” (Twilight), was published in 1923, followed by the immensely popular “Twenty Love Poems and a Song of Despair” (1924). These works established Neruda as a leading poet of his generation. His poetry evolved over time, encompassing themes of love, politics, and social justice, often characterized by passionate and vivid imagery.

In the 1930s, Neruda’s political views deepened, influenced by the Spanish Civil War and the assassination of his friend, Spanish poet Federico GarcÃ­a Lorca. This period saw the publication of his influential collection “Residence on Earth” (1933-1945), which reflected his growing political awareness and disillusionment with the world.

Political Involvement

Neruda’s political engagement extended beyond his poetry. He served as a Chilean diplomat in various countries, including Burma, Sri Lanka, Mexico, and Spain. His experiences abroad reinforced his commitment to social justice and his opposition to fascism and imperialism. In 1945, Neruda joined the Communist Party of Chile and was elected as a senator. His outspoken criticism of President Gabriel GonzÃ¡lez Videla’s anti-communist policies led to his exile in 1948. During this time, he wrote “Canto General” (1950), an epic poem chronicling Latin American history and its struggles for freedom.

Pablo Neruda Death

Pablo Neruda, the Nobel Prize-winning Chilean poet, died on September 23, 1973, just twelve days after the military coup led by General Augusto Pinochet overthrew President Salvador Allende’s government. Officially, Neruda’s death was attributed to prostate cancer, from which he had been suffering for some time. However, there have been persistent suspicions and allegations that Neruda may have been murdered due to his strong political affiliations and support for Allende. In recent years, investigations and forensic analyses have been conducted to determine the exact cause of his death, but conclusive evidence remains elusive. His death marked the end of an era for Chilean literature and left a significant void in the global literary community.
