        "text": "Copyright: © Fundación Pablo Neruda\n\nPablo Neruda, born Neftalí Reyes Basoalto, is without a doubt one of the greatest international poets of the last century. A celebrated poet from an early age, he lived in Santiago de Chile from 1920 to 1927, during which time his output included the volume of poems Veinte poemas de amor y una canción desesperada, perhaps his most popular work, which established him as a significant poet in the Spanish language. Neruda travelled a great deal and worked in various diplomatic roles. He was an important political activist, member of the Communist Party, and intellectual activist. He established a revolutionary concept of poetry, and had an extraordinary verbal power. His literary career represents a seminal tour of the possibilities of lyrical expression in the Spanish language. When Neruda was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1971, the Swedish Academy described him as a poet that “brings alive a continent’s destiny and dreams.”\n\nTITLES"
