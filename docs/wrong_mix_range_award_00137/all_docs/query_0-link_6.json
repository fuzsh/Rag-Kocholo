        "text": "Welcome to Latinometrics. We bring you Latin American insights and trends through concise, thought-provoking data visualizations.\n\nPartner with us\n\nAwards üéñÔ∏è\n\nWhether you‚Äôre familiar with them or not, a whole lot of superstars have come out of Latin America over the years. From authors to poets to scientists to (yes, even) politicians, there have been a number of Latin Americans ‚Äì originating from around the region ‚Äì who have helped the world make real advances in culture, science, and life.\n\nThis week, we‚Äôre looking at the 17 Nobel Prizes awarded to our region since the beginning of the annual prize in 1901. The very first one awarded to a Hispanic was for Argentina‚Äôs renowned foreign minister during the 1930s, who brokered peace between the country‚Äôs neighbors in the Chaco War and eventually presided over the League of Nations General Assembly.\n\nLater, over a third of the region‚Äôs Nobel prizes were awarded in literature, which should not surprise longtime Latinometrics readers.\n\nFrom Colombia‚Äôs Gabriel Garc√≠a M√°rquez to Peru‚Äôs Mario Vargas Llosa, Latin America‚Äôs novelists and storytellers are responsible for the creation of the region‚Äôs greatest literary genre, magical realism, through acclaimed books such as One Hundred Years of Solitude (1967) and Conversation in the Cathedral (1969). Meanwhile, poets such as Chile‚Äôs very own Pablo Neruda are famous the world over for their skilled verse and manipulation of the Spanish language.\n\nArgentineans have tended to dominate in hard sciences such as chemistry or medicine. However, most recently, it was a Mexican, Mario Molina, who received the award in 1995 for his role in discovering the threat posed by CFC gases to Earth‚Äôs ozone layer.\n\nFinally, there‚Äôs the Nobel Peace Prize. Former Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos is the most recent recipient of this or any Nobel prize, having earned it for his role in negotiating the end of Colombia‚Äôs protracted internal conflict with the FARC guerrillas. Other notable laureates include Guatemalan human rights activist Rigoberta Mench√∫, most known for her advocacy work with indigenous peoples in Central America.\n\nAll of Latin America‚Äôs biggest countries are represented in the halls of the victors, with one clear exception: Brazil. While we recognize Nobel prizes are not the end-all-be-all of international achievement, we hope to see this change to reflect Brazil‚Äôs own unique contribution to the world. We also want to see more awarded for our great region, as our 17 reflect just under 2% of the total awarded since 1901.\n\n‚Äî\n\nComment of the Week üó£Ô∏è\n\nAre we living in an era where popularity trumps truth?
