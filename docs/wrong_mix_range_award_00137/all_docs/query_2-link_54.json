        "text": "Pablo Neruda was the adopted name of the Chilean poet Ricardo Eliécer Neftalí Reyes Basoalto (1904 – 1973). He came up with a pen name because his father didn’t approve of his poetry, which Pablo started writing at age ten. Neruda, who won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1971, was considered to be one of the greatest poets of the 20th Century.\n\nNPR reported that in 2014, archivists discovered some previously unpublished works by Neruda:\n\n“Forrest Gander, the Brown University professor who translated the poems into English, likens the discovery to finding a trove of new sketches by Michelangelo.”\n\nOne of the new poems was a tribute to Neruda’s third wife and muse, Matilde Urrutia. NPR provided an excerpt:\n\n“Never alone, with you\n\nover the earth,\n\ncrossing through fire.\n\nNever alone.\n\nWith you in the forests,\n\nfinding again\n\ndawn’s\n\nstiff arrow,\n\nthe tender moss\n\nof spring\n\nWith you\n\nin my struggle,\n\nnot the one I chose\n\nbut\n\nthe only one.”\n\n(You can read the full poem and the others recently discovered in the book Then Come Back: The Lost Neruda translated by Forrest Gander.)\n\nWhile Neruda was best known for his love poems, he was also a leftist politician and diplomat and close friend of Marxist president Salvador Allende. Neruda died in Chile in 1973, less than two weeks after a U.S.-backed military coup replaced Allende with the brutal dictator Augusto Pinochet.\n\nNeruda, who was 69 and had prostate cancer, had planned to go into exile, where he would have been an influential voice against the dictatorship. A day before his scheduled departure, however, he was taken by ambulance to the Santa Maria clinic in Santiago, where he died, reportedly from “natural causes.” Suspicions that the dictatorship had a hand in his death lingered.\n\nIn 2011 a Chilean judge ordered that an investigation be launched pursuant to suggestions that Neruda may have been poisoned by the Pinochet regime. On April 8, 2013, his remains were finally exhumed. While initial tests confirm he had advanced cancer, toxicology studies about possible poisoning were inconclusive.\n\nThen in November of 2015, Chile’s government acknowledged that Neruda might have been killed by “a third party.”\n\nFinally, NPR reported that International forensic experts delivered a report on Neruda’s death to justice officials in Chile on February 15, 2023, having found high levels of poison in the poet’s remains."
