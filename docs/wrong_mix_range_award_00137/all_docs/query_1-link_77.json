        "text": "A couple of years ago, one of my students was in Panama participating in an international tennis tournament. In order for him not to fall behind, we agreed to continue classes over Skype during the period of his absence. One night we studied three love poems by the Chilean poet, Pablo Neruda, one of which I have translated below. When the class was over, I asked Patrick to go down to the hotel lobby and find one of the Spanish-speaking girls who was also taking part in the tournament and to read the poems to her. Always game for anything, Patrick found a Venezuelan girl, Valeria, and read the poems to her. She was extremely moved by the experience. My intention was to show my student that poetry was not written for the academic environment but was intended to be read as a normal everyday activity, and that love poetry could be extremely effective, particularly in the context of relationships with the opposite sex. He certainly got the message and so did Valeria.\n\nThe poem translated below was taken from Veinte poemas de amor y una canción desesperada [Twenty Love Poems and a Song of Despair] a collection which was first published in 1924 when Neruda was only nineteen. It has since become the Chilean poet’s best known work and has sold more than a million copies and been widely translated. Neruda was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1969.\n\nPoem 20\n\nTonight I could write the saddest lines.\n\nWrite, for example: “The night is shattered,\n\nand blue stars shimmer, far away.”\n\nThe night wind veers in the sky and sings.\n\nTonight I could write the saddest lines.\n\nI loved her, and sometimes she loved me too.\n\nOn nights like this I held her in my arms.\n\nI kissed her so many times under the infinite sky.\n\nShe loved me, sometimes I loved her too.\n\nHow not to have loved her big staring eyes.\n\nTonight I could write the saddest lines.\n\nTo think I do not have her. To feel I’ve lost her.\n\nTo hear the inmense night, more immense without her.\n\nAnd that line settles upon the soul as dew upon the grass.\n\nWhat does it matter that my love could not retain her.\n\nThe night is full of stars and she’s not with me.\n\nThat’s all. Far away someone is singing. Far away.\n\nMy soul is not content to have lost her.\n\nAs though to bring her close my eyes look for her.\n\nMy heart looks for her, and she’s not with me.\n\nThe same night chills the same trees with frost.\n\nWe, the ones we were then, are not the same.\n\nI don’t love her, it’s true, but how I loved her.\n\nI sought the wind to carry my voice to her ear.\n\nSomeone elses’s. She’ll belong to another. Like before my kisses.\n\nHer voice, her bright body. Her infinite eyes.\n\nI no longer love her, it’s true, but maybe I do.\n\nLove’s so short, and the memory so long to fade.\n\nBecause on nights like this I held her in my arms,\n\nMy soul is not content to have lost her.\n\nThough this may be the last pain she causes me,\n\nand these the last lines that I write.\n\nTranslation by John Lyons"
