And there,\n\nin immensity’s mire, I encountered their death;\n\nDeath grazing the barriers,\n\nDeath opening roadways and doorways.\n\n“The Poet” from General Song, 1950\n\nPublished in Selected Poems of Pablo Neruda\n\nEdited and translated by Ben Belitt\n\nCopyright © Fundación Pablo Neruda, 2009\n\nStationary Point\n\nI would know nothing, dream nothing:\n\nwho will teach my non-being\n\nhow to be, without striving to be?\n\nHow can the water endure it?\n\nWhat sky have the stones dreamed?\n\nImmobile, until those migrations\n\ndelay at their apogee\n\nand fly on their arrows\n\ntoward the cold archipelago.\n\nUnmoved in its secretive life,\n\nlike an underground city,\n\nso the days may glide down\n\nlike ungraspable dew:\n\nnothing fails, or shall perish,\n\nuntil we be born again,\n\nuntil all that lay plundered\n\nbe restored with the tread\n\nof the springtime we buried—\n\nthe unceasingly stilled, as it lifts\n\nitself out of non-being, even now,\n\nto be flowering bough.\n\n“Stationary Point” from Voyages and Homecomings, 1959\n\nPublished in Selected Poems of Pablo Neruda\n\nEdited and translated by Ben Belitt\n\nCopyright © Fundación Pablo Neruda, 2009\n\nPoems selected by the Nobel Library of the Swedish Academy"
