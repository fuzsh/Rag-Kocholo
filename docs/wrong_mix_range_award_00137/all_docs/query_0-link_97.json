        "text": "Related Papers\n\nAlfred B. Nobel was born on 21 October 1833 in Stockholm and died on 10 December 1896 in San Remo. On 27 September 1895 he wrote his Will: “I, the undersigned, Alfred Bernhard Nobel, do hereby, after mature deliberation, declare the following to be my last Will and Testament with respect to such property as may be left by me at the time of my death... The whole of my remaining realizable estate shall be dealt with in the following way: the capital, invested in safe securities by my executors, shall constitute a fund, the interest on which shall be annually distributed in the form of prizes to those who, during the preceding year, shall have conferred the greatest benefit to mankind. The said interest shall be divided into five equal parts [emphasis added, W.O.], which shall be apportioned as follows: These five fields are following: physics, chemistry, physiology or medicine, literature, and fraternity between the nations (promotion of peace).”\n\nDownload\n\nNotes and Records, 2020\n\nThe Nobel Prize has acted as a surrogate record of invention and discovery throughout the twentieth century. Based on this surrogacy, many claims are made regarding both trends in research and claims for places of research excellence. In this paper I propose that any analysis should be weighted by the 'prize share' made by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences to each recipient. In addition, I argue for a focus on the organization and period when the prize-winning research was carried out, rather than when the award was made and the often quoted 'affiliated organization at the time of award'. I use this to briefly examine types of invention and discovery for all Nobel Prizes in Physics awarded to date (1901-2019). I then use this 'place' lens to briefly explore trends in invention and discovery in the awarding of the Nobel Prize in Physics. I conclude by drawing attention to the difference between institutions claiming Nobel Laureates and institutions where Nobel Prize-winning discoveries and inventions have been made.\n\nDownload"
