        "text": "The distinguished laureates have been announced\n\nThe Nobel Prize is given annually to men and women in six respected categories “in recognition of academic, cultural or scientific advances” to benefit humankind. This is in memory of Swedish engineer and industrialist Alfred Nobel. Between 1901 and 2019, 597 Nobel prizes have been bestowed on a global scale. Among the most famed Nobel laureates from the past years include Albert Einstein, Alexander Fleming, Marie Curie and Mother Teresa.\n\nHere are the winners for 2019:\n\nThe Nobel Peace Prize\n\nEthiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed takes the Nobel Peace Prize “for his efforts to achieve peace and international cooperation and, in particular, for his decisive initiative to resolve the border conflict with neighboring Eritrea.” He seeks to promote reconciliation, solidarity and social justice in his country through his number of initiated reforms.\n\nYoung climate activist Greta Thunberg—who made headlines for inspiring approximately 150 youth strikes internationally—was nominated for the same award.\n\nThe Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel\n\nThe three scholars, Abhijit Banerjee and Esther Duflo of Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Michael Kremer of Harvard University, were awarded the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel “for their experimental approach to alleviating global poverty.” They are pioneers in a new experiment-based approach in upending poverty on a comprehensive scale. Dulfo is the second woman and youngest individual to be given the award.\n\nThe Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine\n\nThe Nobel Assembly at Karolinska Institutet awarded William G. Kaelin Jr., together with his constituents Sir Peter J. Ratcliffe and Gregg L. Semenza, “for their discoveries of how cells sense and adapt to oxygen availability.” How cells adapt to changes in levels of oxygen has always eluded scholars. Their discovery paves the way for new strategies to fight anemia, cancer and other diseases.\n\nThe Nobel Prize in Physics\n\nThe Nobel Prize in Physics has been awarded “for contributions to our understanding of the evolution of the universe and Earth’s place in the cosmos” to James Peebles “for theoretical discoveries in physical cosmology” and the other half to Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz “for the discovery of an exoplanet orbiting a solar-type star.” Years in the making, we are presented with the groundbreaking spectacle of the first discovery of a planet beyond our solar system.\n\nThe Nobel Prize in Chemistry\n\nThe Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences awarded John B. Goodenough, M. Stanley Whittingham and Akira Yoshino “for the development of lithium-ion batteries.” These trailblazers pioneered the use of lithium-ion batteries globally for a wireless, fossil-free society. At 97, Goodenough is the oldest person to ever receive a Nobel Prize.\n\nThe Nobel Prize in Literature\n\nThe 2018 Nobel Prize in Literature went to Polish author Olga Tokarczuk “for a narrative imagination that, with encyclopedic passion, represents the crossing of boundaries as a form of life.” Meanwhile, the Nobel Prize in Literature for 2019 was awarded to Austrian author Peter Handke “for an influential [piece of] work that, with linguistic ingenuity, has explored the periphery and the specificity of human experience.” They are in the ranks of former laureates Pablo Neruda, Kazuo Ishiguro and Gabriel García Márquez.\n\nAnd just for fun, some fast facts on the Nobel Prize:\n\n54 Nobel prizes have been awarded to women with Malala Yousafzai as the youngest awardee at 17\n\nTwo have declined to receive the prize, including French writer and philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre, who consistently refused all honors\n\nMany individuals have been nominated but never won including Mahatma Gandhi, attributed as the strongest symbol of non-violence in the 20th century\n\nThe Nobel prize amount for 2019 is at SEK 9.0 million (around $170K) per winner\n\nLearn more about the 2019 Nobel laureates here.\n\nIllustrations Niklas Elmehed"
