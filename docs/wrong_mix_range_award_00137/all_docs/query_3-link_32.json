        "text": "When President Joe Biden visits Ireland this week, you can expect him to visit an ancient castle, honor some of his ancestors and mark the 25th anniversary of the Good Friday agreement among Northern Ireland, the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom.\n\nBelarusian opposition figures, Hong Kong-pro-democracy activists, the Black Lives Matter movement, a jailed Russian opposition leader and two former White House senior advisers are among this years nominations for the Nobel Peace Prize. There is no shortage of causes or candidates for the Norwegian Nobel Committee to consider for what arguably remains the world’s most prestigious prize. Here's a look at the Nobel nomination process:WHO CAN NOMINATE CANDIDATES FOR THE NOBEL PEACE PRIZE? The U.N. World Food Program won the 2020 Nobel Peace Prize. The peace prize and other Nobel awards are presented to the winners on Dec. 10, the anniversary of founder Alfred Nobel’s death.\n\nPresident-elect Joe Biden speaks at a drive-in rally for Georgia Democratic candidates for U.S. Senate Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff, Tuesday, Dec. 15, 2020, in Atlanta. (AP Photo/Patrick Semansky)WASHINGTON – The Latest on President-elect Joe Biden (all times local):7:55 p.m.President-elect Joe Biden has formally announced former rival Pete Buttigieg as his pick to be secretary of transportation. ___1:30 p.m.President-elect Joe Biden says he’s spoken with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell after the Electoral College affirmed his victory Monday. ___8:40 a.m.Two foreign leaders who had not congratulated President-elect Joe Biden have now done so. ___7:30 a.m.Top U.S. infectious disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci says President-elect Joe Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris should be vaccinated for COVID-19 as soon as possible.\n\nANN ARBOR – University of Michigan alumnus Paul Milgrom was awarded this year’s Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences. Milgrom, who graduated in 1970 with a bachelor’s in mathematics, was recognized with the prestigious international award for his work in improving auction formats. Using auction theory, the duo designed new auction formats for buying and selling nonphysical goods like radio frequencies. The moment Milgrom found out he won the Nobel Prize was captured on his home security system. Analyzing auction formats can be challenging because bidders make unilateral, calculated decisions based on the value of what they are bidding on.\n\nOAK PARK, Mich. – Stanford University Professor Paul Milgrom didn’t know he had won a Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences because he was asleep. “My phones were all set up for Do Not Disturb...The co-winner, Bob (Robert) Wilson, is also my neighbor across the street. He came over at about 2 a.m. and was pounding on my door,\" said Milgrom, who graduated from Oak Park High School. Milgrom and Wilson, who is also a professor at Stanford University, won the Nobel Prize for improvements in auction theory. “Milgrom designed a general theory of auctions that takes into consideration common values of auction markets as well as private values, which vary from bidder to bidder,” read the release.\n\nWednesday's Nobel Prize in chemistry was a historic first for women. It was the first time a Nobel science prize was given to more than one woman, but no men, in a specific category. In the 120 years of Nobel prizes in medicine, physics and chemistry, prizes were awarded 599 times to men and 23 times to women. Three other times, a woman won one of the sciences by herself. This year, Emmanuelle Charpentier and Jennifer Doudna won the chemistry prize for developing the CRISPR method of genome editing.\n\nTokarczuk said in a tweet Friday that while she appreciated being considered, she “sadly” couldn't accept Lower Silesia’s honorary citizenship. She said that receiving it at the same time as Bishop Ignacy Dec would highlight the “painful rift” in Poland over LGBT rights. Dec has repeatedly described the LGBT rights movement as a threat to the Catholic Church and to Poland, which is predominantly Catholic. “Instead of being a joyous celebration of a sense of community, it is a vivid illustration of the painful rift in our society,” she said. Poland has produced heated debates over LGBT rights in recent months, including after right-wing President Andrzej Duda described the movement as worse than communism as part of his reelection campaign earlier this year.\n\nBosnian women whose male family members, including sons and husbands, perished in the Srebrenica massacre hold placards as they protest outside Swedish embassy in Sarajevo, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Tuesday, Nov. 5, 2019. Several dozen survivors of Bosnia's 1992-95 war staged a protest in Sarajevo to call on the Nobel Committee to reverse its decision to award the 2019 Nobel Prize in literature to Austria's Peter Handke. Placards read: 'to award Handke is equal awarding committed crime' and 'award for Hadke is award for Slobodan Milosevic'. Despite a U.N. court ruling to the contrary, Handke has persistently denied that genocide took place in Srebrenica. (Almir Razic/Fena Agency via AP)SARAJEVO Several dozen survivors of Bosnia's 1992-95 war have protested in Sarajevo, urging the Nobel Committee to reverse its decision to award the 2019 Nobel Prize in literature to Austrian writer Peter Handke.\n\nSTOCKHOLM, Sweden - Abhijit Banerjee, Esther Duflo and Michael Kremer were awarded the Nobel Prize in economics on Monday for research on alleviating global poverty. The trio pioneered an approach to poverty reduction that was based on carefully designed experiments that sought answers to specific policy questions. Duflo, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, is the youngest person and second woman to be awarded the prize. Kremer, a professor at Harvard, used field work to test how school results could be improved in western Kenya during the mid-1990s. \"This year's laureates have introduced a new approach to obtaining reliable answers about the best ways to fight global poverty,\" organizers said in a statement.\n\nANN ARBOR - Bob Dylan and his band just announced a new fall tour across the U.S. and the legendary artist will be making a stop in Ann Arbor.
