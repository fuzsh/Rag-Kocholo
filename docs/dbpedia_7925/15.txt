The very premise of “Mrs. Henderson Presents” makes the film an unlikely candidate for the family-friendly seal. It’s loosely based on the true story of a widow who invests her inheritance in restoring an old theatre into a spectacular stage for London’s first all-nude review. This movie is interesting and unpredictable. Bob Hoskins and Judi Dench are simply remarkable together. The nude-review storyline plays second fiddle to the bombings of London and loss of military life which are both sensitively and emotionally portrayed.
