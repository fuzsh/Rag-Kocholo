        "text": "Welcome to America\n\nTom arrives in Los Angeles to stay with his American cousins, Al and Kitty Chadwick, and to try and discover why his great-great-grandfather Charles left for England more than a hundred years ago. Al has invited two other cousins--Rick, who also lives in California, and Dave, who's on a road trip from North Carolina--to a family barbecue. With Rick's girlfriend Julie and Al's neighbor Mike rounding out the party, everyone gets to know each other a little better, and they put their heads together to figure out how the family ended up having branches in both the United States and England. As the drinks flow, tongues loosen and inhibitions are dropped, ice is not the only thing that gets broken underneath the California sun.\n\nCivil War\n\nTom's cousin Rick, an American Civil War enthusiast, helps Tom find out more about his great-great-grandfather Charles' mysterious activities as a soldier in the war. They visit a Civil War expert, Harvey Krupp, who agrees to investigate further on Tom's behalf, and invites him to take part in a Civil War re-enactment that he organized. A car accident leads Tom to meet a beautiful aspiring writer, Ally Keele, and the attraction appears to be mutual. Tom gamely participates in the Civil War re-enactment with Rick, Julie and Harvey, but war isn't all it's cracked up to be. During the battle, he gets a phone call and some news from England. Afterwards, Harvey gives him some even more interesting news about his great-great-grandfather, which explains a lot of things."
