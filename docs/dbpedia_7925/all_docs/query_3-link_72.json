        "text": "A surprisingly underpowered but clearly well intentioned film from Stephen Frears that depicts the true story of London's The Windmill Theatre during the blitz of World War Two when it infamously proclaimed 'We Never Close!'\n\nJudi Dench stars as the titular Mrs Henderson, an eccentric woman who purchases the theatre to give her an interest following her husband's death. Inspired by the famous Moulin Rouge of France, she proposes a variety review featuring nude (but completely still - to get round the nudity laws of the day) show girls and hires Vivian Vann Dam (Bob Hoskins) as the manager.\n\nThe chirpiness of the production is positively overpowering and, like any form of enforced fun, it left me a bit cold and critical. There's also the expected sentimental air in detailing the hardships of war, especially on the home front. Much is made of Mrs Henderson's motives; how the war made her all the more determined to provide a bit of sauce for the young men going off to fight because her own son, killed in The Great War, had never seen a naked woman himself. Some critics baulk at such triviality, but the fact remains if this truly was her motivation, who are we to quibble when the film represents that? And it's somewhat puritanical and ignorant of negative reviews to claim that sex wasn't rife in wartime; when you never know when your number is going to be up, you get what you can where you can.\n\nNevertheless Frears' film does seem to want to have its cake and eat it; it wants to be a bit naughty and smutty as befits the story and its telling but, because it also wants to appeal to the modern movie goer and especially 'the grey pound' it doesn't go all out in terms of ribaldry. It's a shame as to be honest I think the best way to have told this story would have been to adopt a 70s Carry On style approach - the kind of film the likes of Frankie Howard, Robin Askwith and Danny La Rue would have queued up to be in.\n\nSomewhat unmemorable, alas."
