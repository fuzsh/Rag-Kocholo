While she is staying at a residential hotel for senior citizens, she meets writer Ludovic Meyer (Rupert Friend) when she trips and falls on the street in front of his home. An unlikely friendship flourishes between them, bolstered by the fact that the residents are under the impression that Ludovic is Mrs. Palfrey's estranged grandson.",
