        "text": "It may not begin its West End run until 9 February but Mrs Henderson Presents is making the most of Christmas, releasing the footage of Tracie Bennett recording Whatever Time I Have at the legendary Abbey Road Studios.\n\nThat’s apt, of course, as that is what the song’s lyrics, written by Don Black – who is almost as legendary as Abbey Road – are all about; making the most of life and every opportunity given to you…\n\n… which is also what we’re doing by sharing this footage with you. Oh, it’s all very clever, isn’t it?\n\nThe song, with music by George Fenton and Simon Chamberlain, is one of the first chances us Londoners have had to sample the delights of the new musical that was such a success at the Theatre Royal Bath earlier this year.\n\nWith a book by Olivier Award winner Terry Johnson, the tuneful hit based on the Judi Dench film tells the story of the titular eccentric widow. With time and money on her hands, she invests in a former cinema in Great Windmill Street and hires feisty impresario Vivian Van Damm to run it as the Windmill Theatre. As war looms, something new is needed to boost morale, cue the invention of The Windmill Girls: glamorous young performers posing as nude statues."
