        "text": "In 2014, director Terry Johnson revived Joan Littlewood's famous revue Oh What A Lovely War, about the First World War, at its original home at the Theatre Royal Stratford East. Now he moves to the Second World War for a similarly affectionate yet simultaneously gritty portrait of a resilient real-life theatre, the Windmill, the only one in the capital to stay open at the height of the Blitz, living up to its motto: \"We never close!\"\n\nIf the effect is to provide a kind of mirror to his earlier show, also echoing its music hall storytelling techniques and even sharing an actor in Ian Bartholomew, who appears in both, Mrs Henderson Presents is the more conventional, old-fashioned production, but none the worse for it.\n\nLittlewood's show is a bracing polemic on the sheer pointlessness of war. This musical, based on the 2005 film of the same name, is more soft-centred, even though it doesn't shy from occasional hard edges. Instead, by concentrating on the backstage lives of the dancers and management of the Windmill, there's more of a jaunty, frequently patriotic, flavour to it – that both sings and occasionally stings.\n\nThe score, with its music by Simon Chamberlain (who was musical director on the original film) and George Fenton and veteran lyricist Don Black, has an easy, accessible pastiche quality, in a similar vein to The Boy Friend, that channels composers who were active at the time, like Ivor Novello and Vivian Ellis. It comes into its own a couple of times as an original work, thanks to the soaring melodic quality that Emma Williams brings to songs like If Mountains Were Easy to Climb, or the touching sincerity of Ian Bartholomew in Living in a Dream World.\n\nWhile shows like Calendar Girls and The Full Monty, both of which coincidentally also played at the Noel Coward, coyly didn't quite show all – the girls in the former hid behind buns and other objects, the boys in the latter had their modesty protected by a blinding light at the key moment – there's no such inhibition here, with the girls showing all.\n\nBut there's nothing salacious about it. In fact there's something sweetly innocent about it; I'm happy to report that this show is no bomb, but scores a direct hit of its own.\n\nAuthor: Mark Shenton\n\nPass the opera glasses, Perkins. But they might be steamed up at Mrs Henderson Presents, an unashamedly entertaining musical about the old Windmill Theatre in London where young women posed in nude tableaux.\n\nYou may recall a film of this story a decade ago which starred Dame Judi Dench and the late Bob Hoskins.\n\nMrs Henderson is an elderly widow who uses the fortune left by her husband to buy a theatre in Central London in 1937.\n\nWhen the punters prove resistant to its offer of revue shows, she hits on an idea of stripping her showgirls to their birthday suits. But how to get round the Lord Chamberlain and his censorship decrees?\n\nSimple: she announces that her girls will not wobble a muscle. Not so much as a cheek will jelly-quiver. They will pose entirely still and thus will be as inoffensive as the classical nudes on display at fine-art galleries.\n\nThis production, directed by its writer Terry Johnson, has music by George Fenton and Simon Chamberlain and lyrics by Don Black. The tunes may not be in the very highest category but they are more than workmanlike and the lyrics witty. One song, If Mountains Were Easy To Climb, elicits tears.\n\nJanie Dee was originally cast as the intrepid Mrs H but she withdrew early in the process. Her place has been taken by Tracie Bennett who is great fun. She could never be accused of underacting but who could fail to be drawn to this short, husky-voiced ball of mercy? I kept thinking it was Elaine Paige.\n\nThe nude shows pack in the audiences but war arrives and the Windmill entertains the troops through London’s bleakest Blitz nights. The theatre’s stage hand, Eddie (Matthew Malthouse) joins the RAF. Will he be missed by the show’s frustratingly chaste leading lady, Maureen? Will Eddie survive?\n\nIan Bartholomew does a decent turn as Mr Van Damm, the show’s director, and there is a lovely turn — albeit worryingly pink-faced — from Graham Hoadly as the Lord Chamberlain. The show is stolen by the Windmill girls, most of all by Emma Williams as Maureen.\n\nWhat a voice, I feel bound to say. What stage presence, duty compels me to report. What a hairdo. Yes, yes, yes. But what a figure, too!\n\nOh, I know we men are not meant to ogle but what can one do but gawp in dry-throated admiration at Maureen and Doris and Vera and Peggy (the last being played by Katie Bernstein, another strong voice)?\n\nThey shed their garments and strike Greek poses and it is surely not just old chaps whose eyes will swivel like fruit-machine dials. It is not smutty. It is (pause for pigeon-cooing from your critic) beautiful. And often deliciously funny, even patriotic.\n\nMark Hadfield does some of his customary comedy stuff — few actors move with greater comic efficiency — and Samuel Holmes has some great moments as gay Bertie, the token boy.\n\nHigh dramatic art? Maybe not. But I have not emerged from a theatre feeling quite so cheerful for a long time.\n\nAuthor: Quentin Letts"
