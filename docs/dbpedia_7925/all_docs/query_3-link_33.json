        "text": "The Windmill Theatre, the postcards of Donald McGill and the Daily Mirror's strip cartoon about the scantily clad showgirl Jane are the 'naughty but nice' elements of that nostalgic cluster of images representing a lost national identity and innocence that hover around the Second World War. We sing along to them with Vera Lynn, a copy of Orwell's essays on the lectern before us.\n\nThe Windmill, located in Soho just north of Piccadilly Circus, was in business from the 1930s to the early 1960s, but the Forties was its heyday, when its continuous performances of Revuedeville from noon to 10.50pm, with tableaux vivants of frozen and freezing nudes, had an unbroken run throughout the Second World War. This led to the official slogan 'We Never Closed' and the unofficial one, 'We Never Clothed', and it was every provincial schoolboy's ambition to go there, though most of us had to settle for sleazy touring shows based on the Windmill idea, with titles such as Halt, Who Goes Bare?, Don't Point, It's Nude, and Yes, We Have No Pyjamas. These were the sort of shoddy spectacles Archie Rice appeared in and that John Osborne's The Entertainer used as a metaphor for a Britain in terminal decline.\n\nThere have been previous movies about the Windmill. In 1945, Hollywood gave us Tonight and Every Night, directed by British emigre Victor Saville, a tribute to the morale-boosting wartime role of the Windmill, starring Rita Hayworth. Renamed the Music Box Theatre, it staged feeble songs (including the dire 'What Does an English Girl Think of a Yank?') produced with an opulence even the Palladium didn't aspire to.\n\nA couple of years later, in a series of comedy thrillers set in leading British institutions, came Val Guest's Murder at the Windmill, actually shot on the premises. A Scotland Yard inspector (avuncular Garry Marsh) and his bumbling assistant (Jon Pertwee) investigate the death of a voyeur in the theatre's front row, killed (if memory serves aright) by an elderly stagehand bent on protecting one of the showgirls from this predatory punter's designs.\n\nNow we have a romantic new movie about the Windmill, scripted by American playwright Martin Sherman, best known for his play, Bent, and directed by Stephen Frears, that arrives dripping with praise for its life-enhancing qualities. Its title, Mrs Henderson Presents, echoes consciously or unconsciously that long-banned play, Mrs Warren's Profession, in which Bernard Shaw, using prostitution as a metaphor for capitalist society, assaulted hypocrisy and the collusion in vice of the British upper and lower classes.\n\nDealing somewhat freely with the known facts, the movie begins with that now customary claim, 'inspired by a true story'. The eponymous Laura Henderson (Judi Dench) is an imperious, imperial, upper-class widow in her late sixties who has spent much of her married life in India and on her husband's death in 1937 feels she needs a hobby.\n\nOn a whim, she buys the rundown Windmill Theatre, and on the advice of her solicitor engages to manage it Vivian van Damm (Bob Hoskins), an impresario somewhat down on his luck and affecting a demeanour of exaggerated gentility. Mrs Henderson is a ladylike anti-semite of a kind the English appear rather to like. Van Damm is a would-be middle-class gentleman denying his roots as a Jew of Dutch extraction, a matter immediately remarked on in Lady Bracknell-like manner by his new employer.\n\nMrs Henderson is in a state of suppressed grief, not for her late husband, but for her son, killed on the Western Front in 1915 at the age of 21. She makes two cross-Channel trips to his grave, one in her Rolls-Royce, the other (a highly unlikely one, given the times) on a sudden whim while up in the air in a two-seater biplane just before the outbreak of war.\n\nHer theatrical venture with her touchy partner is a success, fulfilling van Damm's belief in the commercial possibilities of a nonstop show. But it's so widely copied that some major new ingredient is needed fast and, rather surprisingly, Mrs Henderson suggests nudes in Parisian style. To obtain permission, she uses her connections to win over the dim, hidebound Lord Cromer (American satirist Christopher Guest, himself a onetime member of the House of Lords) who, as Lord Chamberlain, licenses live stage performances.\n\nAfter a series of comic dialogues of a somewhat anachronistic kind, Mrs Henderson gets her way and the famously chaste nude tableaux follow. In order to coax the classy girls hired to strip, van Damm and the theatre's male staff all get their kit off in an unlikely, highly embarrassing scene designed to appeal to Full Monty fans.\n\nFalseness and sentimentality take over completely when war breaks out and authentic newsreel material accompanies the the-show-must-go-on spirit at the Windmill. A gay choreographer (Will Young) helps keep spirits high. Henderson comes across a grief-stricken van Damm beside a copy of the News Chronicle bearing the headline 'Nazis Round Up Dutch Jews'. A pregnant showgirl is killed on cue in the Blitz. Romantic conversations take place on the Windmill's roof at night as searchlight beams criss-cross in the sky. Everyone looks 'Terrible Forties' as in a colour-supplement feature celebrating Austerity Chic, though no one carries a gas mask.\n\nBut what turns the movie into, depending on your taste, an objectionable tearjerker or an affirmation of the British spirit under pressure, is a speech given by Mrs Henderson in the street outside the theatre to a crowd of servicemen. Her aim is to prevent the Lord Chamberlain (present with his aide, both in silk toppers) closing the Windmill. With what we can only accept as blazing sincerity, she claims that her mission in introducing nudes to the theatre was to ensure that young men like her son should never again go off to war without having seen a female breast, albeit immobile, in artificial light and at a distance. She concludes her speech with the word 'fuck', and has her audience cheering.\n\nIn real life, 25 years passed before the Lord Chamberlain's office was abolished by a Labour government, and the following night, Hair opened in the West End. The movie is dedicated to 'Karel', who is presumably Stephen Frears's mentor, Karel Reisz. I somehow doubt that he would have liked it."
