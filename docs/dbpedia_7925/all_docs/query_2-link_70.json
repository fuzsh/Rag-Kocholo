        "text": "The London premier of Mrs Henderson Presents Theatre Breaks has now closed.\n\nAfter a successful run at the Theatre Royal Bath, new musical Mrs Henderson Presents, based on the 2005 film starring Dame Judi Dench, is now at the Noel Coward theatre, London with Mrs Henderson Presents Theatre Breaks including tickets and hotel accommodation, now available to book.\n\nWith lyrics by Don Black (Tell Me On A Sunday, Aspects of Love, Sunset Boulevard) Mrs Henderson Presents tells the story of eccentric widow Laura Henderson, who, in 1937, turned a run-down theatre in Soho into a risque venue featuring nude statues. With the country on the brink of war, The Windmill Theatre’s moral lifting slogan “We Never Close” caused both stampede’s at the box office as well as controversy.\n\nTracie Bennett, former Coronation Street actress, takes on the role of the infamous Mrs Henderson with another Olivier Award winner Ian Bartholomew (Into the Woods) in the role of feisty impresario Vivian Van Damm who helps her transform the fortunes of the theatre.\n\nHotels for Mrs Henderson Presents Theatre Breaks\n\nThe Noel Coward Theatre is on St Martin’s Lane so hotels close by include the Guoman Charing Cross on the Strand and the Radisson Blu Mercer Street by Seven Dials. Both are 4 star deluxe hotels and ideal for a spot of pampering.\n\nThe Strand Palace hotel is within walking distance too and, after extensive refurbishment a couple of years ago has gone from a three to a four star. However, for a central hotel its prices are still relatively cheap. Of course, if you are looking for a real bargain then you can’t go far wrong than choosing the Travelodge Covent Garden slap bang in the middle of the hustle and bustle of Soho. The accommodation is basic three star with no frills, but what a location!\n\nThe theatre is close to Leicester Square tube station so you could also look at staying in Bloomsbury which is only a couple of stops away (or a 20 minute walk) and does offer some more great deals: the 4 star Hotel Russell or the 3 star ‘tourist’ hotels the National or the President are usually substantially cheaper than a West End hotel would be!\n\nShow File\n\nGenre : Musical\n\nTheatre : Noel Coward, St Martins Lane, London WC2N 4AU\n\nPerformance times: Monday to Saturday at 19:30; and Wednesday & Saturday at 15:00\n\nOpened : 17th February 2016\n\nBooking to: Now closed\n\nNearest tube station: Leicester Square on Piccadilly & Northern Lines\n\nNearest hotels: Guoman Charing Cross, Radisson Blu Mercer Street, Travelodge Covent Garden\n\nMrs Henderson Presents Theatre Breaks Reviews"
