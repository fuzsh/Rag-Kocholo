        "text": "After Ian Kelly’s Mr Foote’s Other Leg and Lolita Chakrabarti’s Red Velvet comes Jessica Swale’s Nell Gwynn. If the first was camp comedy and the second an act of reclamation, the third is pure pantomime.\n\nSwale exuberantly depicts Nell’s rise from orange-seller in the Drury Lane pit to one of the finest comic actresses of the Restoration era and King Charles II’s mistress. She skilfully captures the backstage politics in both the theatre and court and paints a fascinating (if somewhat over-extended) portrait of 17th century stage practices.\n\nAmid all the drollery, she makes a passionate and pertinent case for the importance of women in theatre and theatre in society.\n\nShe does not labour the contemporary parallels, although having the King declare “Down with austerity”’ is an anachronism too far – not least when his profligacy undermines his protest.\n\nGemma Arterton gives her finest stage performance to date as “pretty, witty” Nell and is surrounded by a splendid cast in Christopher Luscombe’s expertly judged production. Particular plaudits go to Michele Dotrice as a stalwart dresser and Greg Haiste as the deposed “leading lady”, bitterly complaining that Nell never went to fan school.\n\nHad Nell made her stage debut three centuries later, her talents would have found an ideal setting at Soho’s Windmill Theatre.\n\nIn 1932 it became the first British theatre licensed to present female nudity (always provided that the girls never moved), before earning an even more illustrious place in the history books as the only London theatre to stay open during the Blitz.\n\nStephen Frears’ 2005 film, Mrs Henderson Presents, told how the wealthy widow, Laura Henderson, and her domineering manager, Vivian van Damm, together pioneered the nude revues. Now writer-director Terry Johnson, lyricist Don Black, and composers George Fenton and Simon Chamberlain have refashioned the story of this odd couple for the musical stage.\n\nMrs Henderson Presents is a gloriously old-fashioned “book musical”, its style perfectly suited to its subject. The score is beautifully varied ranging from pastiche revue numbers worthy of Sandy Wilson through a defiant anthem for Mrs Henderson, destined to become a cabaret standard, to poignant wartime choruses.\n\nTracie Bennett and Ian Bartholomew make a delightful central duo; she both mischievous and plucky, his irascibility hiding a wounded heart. They receive excellent support from Emma Williams, Samuel Holmes, Matthew Malthouse and a bevy of tastefully naked chorus girls. The Windmill’s proud boast was that it never closed; this show deserves to say the same.\n\nVERDICT: 4/5"
