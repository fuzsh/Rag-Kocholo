Brief Summary:Colin Flooks (December 29th 1947 Â– April 5th 1998), better known as Cozy Powell, was an English rock drummer who made his name with many major rock bands. Cozy Powell was born in Cirencester, Gloucestershire, England, and started playing drums at age 12 in the school orchestra, thereafter playing along in his spare time to popular singles of the day. The first band he was in, the Corals, played each week at the youth club in Cirencester. At age 15 he had already worked out an impressive drum solo. The stage name 'Cozy' was borrowed from the jazz drummer Cozy Cole.

other facts: Powell had a fascination with fast cars and motorbikes, and raced for Hitachi on the UK saloon car circuit for a few months. He made headlines when he appeared on the BBC children's programme Record Breakers where he set a world record for the most drums played in under one minute, live on television.

I Didn't know Cozy Powell was dead. Went to see him play at the Cornwall Coliseum about 30 years ago - he was with Whitesnake. I didn't like Whitesnake (and still don't) but it was worth it just to see Cozy perform - he was amazing. Thanks for posting the videos - will be watching them all later this evening.

Cozy Powell's name has been mentioned more than a few times here. I've listened to him for decades with various bands.

I look at it this way:

Cozy was way, way more interesting a drummer than Bonham & Moon put together.

I am now building a bunker in my yard. Let the flak begin.

I hear Lars had to record one album in 30-60 second bursts cause the producer wanted full on flat out volume. If only they could have had Cozy come in after hours, he could have ghosted Lars' tracks and finish the session in one take.
