        "text": "Emerson, Lake, and Powell will always be one of the funniest album titles to me. I remember encountering this at a used CD shop when I was 10, looking at the cover and wondering, “could it be…?”. At this point, ELP were one of the five or six bands I actually liked, thanks to my Dad playing them around the house all the time when I was young. But this was the mid-90s, and I didn’t have a record guide or anything like that, so really the only thing I knew about them was that they put out some cool albums before I was born. For all I knew they’d retired off to some island in the Caribbean, never to be seen again. Seeing this in the shop answered a few questions for me. Between the album title and the cover art (which resembled the cover of Scattergories more than the armadillo tanks and shirtless men of ELP past) I was able to figure that they’d likely fallen on hard times, and for some reason Carl Palmer didn’t want to play with them anymore, so they recruited another “P” and quickly dashed something out in the hopes that the fans wouldn’t notice he was missing.\n\nIf nothing else, there is a lesson there: if you name your supergroup after the members of the band, you have to accept the inherit risk that comes with it. I mean, if the lineup of Yes is Billy Sherwood, Steve Howe’s 3rd cousin, the ghost of Chris Squire, and the janitor, they can still legally call themselves Yes. Make the *other* guys use their names…hence “Anderson, Bruford, Wakeman, and Howe” (catchy!) or the “ARW” lineup that’s touring to this day. To ELP’s credit, they came up with a clever workaround. The new drummer’s name starts with a P, and has the same number of letters and syllables. I guess in some sense “Emerson, Lake, and Powell” still sounds right.\n\nNow the band claims this wasn’t intentional, but I have my doubts. Certainly we can deduce that Emerson and Lake’s primary motivation for this was financial. At the time there was this trend of prog vets reinventing themselves and selling boatloads of records as synth-heavy AOR stars, and ELP would be damned if they missed out on any of that cash. Palmer wasn’t available because he was busy doing the same thing himself as the drummer in Asia, along with John Wetton, Steve Howe, and Geoff Downes (imagine THAT supergroup…in 1975). So they grabbed Cozy Powell, who may not have had the finesse of Carl Palmer, but he had a respectable pedigree, having been through the ranks of the Jeff Beck Band and Black Sabbath. Plus, he had the hair and he owned a motorcycle, so he looked the part.\n\nIn reality it doesn’t matter that Palmer isn’t on the album, since they stick mostly to medium tempos and 4/4 rhythms. All they really needed is a dude who whaps hard on the drums, and that right there is Cozy Powell’s calling card. The real question is, how do they balance ELP’s style with their new adventures in AOR? They don’t exactly have a Trevor Rabin or Phil Collins type in the band – Greg Lake, for all his talent, is a pretty schlocky songwriter who can’t come up with the type of hooks that this band needs. So it just winds up sounding like ELP imitating Asia, with digital synths (nearly all of which seem to have the “choral” setting turned on) and lots of reverb. Emerson is stuck in “Pirates” mode, blasting out one bombastic synth riff after another. Opening track “The Score” is the grand epic here, though it tops out at 9 minutes and really just winds up being a collection of honking synthesizer bits. You still have to give them some credit; it’s not like Yes were trying pieces like this in the 80’s. In spirit it’s not too much different than “Karn Evil 9, Third Impression”.\n\nOther than that the big moment for ELPheads is the closing track, a cover of “Mars, the Bringer of War”, which as you probably know King Crimson used to do. Here I think the digital synths work quite well, though I’m not sure if that’s because they’re so good at creating a pile of noise or because they remind me of the airship levels in Super Mario 3. The video game noises are all over the album – “Learning to Fly” has that twangy Sega Genesis bass sound, which is a bit odd since this band has an actual bassist in it. Outside of that Emerson generally sticks to presets with names like “Trumpet Chorus” and “Heavenizer”, though at times he does bring back some of the old synth sounds, albeit the ones everyone hated (like on “Aquatarkus”). He actually does pull out the piano for a couple of more tasteful numbers on side two, “Step Aside” and “Lay Down Your Guns”, the former of which actually feels like it could’ve been a single.\n\nThe key track of course is “Touch and Go”, which was their stab at a modern rock hit single, similar to Asia’s “Heat of the Moment”. Maybe a bit *too* similar, actually…listen to that pensive little drum bit in the beginning and ask yourself where you’ve heard that before. Not to mention the main theme, which directly lifts the melody from “Lovely Joan” and blasts it through the “Lead Synth Bugle #3” setting, though who would expect anything less from Keith Emerson. This is their most bombastic and over-the-top single since “Jerusalem”, as majestic and ridiculous as anything they’ve ever done. It’s a song that shouldn’t work, and yet somehow it does; not only is it stupidly catchy, but it also features one of Lake’s most overwrought performances ever, with every single line being punctuated with an implied exclamation mark. Even better because the lyrics are terrible, containing some of Lake’s worst rhymes since “Still…You Turn Me On”: “All systems GO!/Friend or FOE!/It’s all depending on the DICE YOU THROW!/They put you in the corner like AN OLD BAN-JO!”\n\nActually, there are two songs like that – “Love Blind” is another explosive synth-heavy single, actually a bit more sophisticated and dense. It’s not as stunning but it’s maybe a better song overall. If nothing else it shows that Lake could still carry a tune on his own at this point. Which begs the question: when, exactly, did his voice get so shot? True, his range has been slipping since Works, but his voice still sounds rich and crisp here, nothing like the man who had to croak his way through Black Moon six years later.\n\nAs it stands, Emerson, Lake, and Powell is perhaps the last gasp of ELP decency. I’d say this is their best studio album since Brain Salad Surgery, but that’s kinda like saying Derek Anderson was the best Browns quarterback since 1999. So I’ll just say this, it was worth the $3.99 I paid for it. In fact, I later shelled out for the re-issue with bonus tracks, just because I wanted to find out if “The Loco-Motion” could possibly be the same one Kylie Minogue covered (spoiler: it is). I guess as you get older you start to appreciate those digital synths and gated drums a bit more.\n\nThe band wound up breaking up the same year the album was released, which is too bad because they managed to build up some momentum. The album sold pretty well, and “Touch and Go” was moderately successful, actually becoming ELP’s highest-charting single since “From the Beginning”. Plus, they were a beast live. Why they split up, no one knows…well, at least three people knew, but sadly none of them are alive anymore. Rumor has it that Cozy Powell was considering filling the John Bonham spot in a potential Zep reunion, and though the that turned out to be untrue, apparently the resulting tension killed the band. Perhaps it was just more drama between Emerson and Lake, or maybe they were just jealous that they weren’t pulling in the same sort of numbers as Genesis or Yes. Regardless, this particular permutation did not last, but this wouldn’t be the last we’d hear of them…"
