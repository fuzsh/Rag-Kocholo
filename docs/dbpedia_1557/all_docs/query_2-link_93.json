He always gives me that incentive to play because Cozy wont let anybody take it\neasy.\" He wasn't wrong. Cozy Powell was a talented, reliable and versatile drummer. A drummer of such calibre that he\nplayed with Jeff Beck, Rainbow, Michael Schenker, Whitesnake, Emerson and Lake, Black Sabbath and Brian May as well as\nbeing a hugely in-demand session player. But before all that he initially came to prominence with three Mickie Most\nproduced, top twenty singles under his own name. An extraordinary feat for an instrumentalist, and a drummer at that.\nCozy Powell's career as a musician is a story that needs to be told. Author Laura Shenton MA LLCM DipRSL has a Masters\ndegree in \"Music Since 1900\" from Liverpool Hope University. Aside from her detailed research, her understanding of\nmusic adds an insightful angle on Cozy Powells abilities in this, the first and long overdue biography of this highly\ntalented and much missed musician that presents Powell's career in all its glory.",
