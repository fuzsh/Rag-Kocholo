        "text": "AKA Colin Flooks\n\nBorn: 29-Dec-1947\n\nBirthplace: Cirencester, Gloucester, England\n\nDied: 5-Apr-1998\n\nLocation of death: Bristol, England\n\nCause of death: Accident - Automobile [1]\n\nRemains: Cremated\n\nGender: Male\n\nRace or Ethnicity: White\n\nSexual orientation: Straight\n\nOccupation: Drummer\n\nNationality: England\n\nExecutive summary: Drummer, Emerson Lake and Powell\n\nEven the most leather-averse music fan would have to concede the impressive range of Cozy Powell's career. His first high-profile work was as a member of one of guitarist Jeff Beck's bands in 1971. This was followed by some success with bands of his own, but ultimately led to his most enduring role: as drummer for Ritchie Blackmore's band Rainbow, which lasted until 1980.\n\nIn subsequent years Powell moved through a number of different bands, including brief tenures in The Michael Schenker Group, Whitesnake, Black Sabbath, and a period working with Keith Emerson and Greg Lake as a \"P\" in an 80's version of ELP. He also worked in projects with Queen guitarist Brian May, Yngwie Malmsteen, and supported Peter Green during his 1990s comeback tour. Several solo records and numerous other collaborations could also be listed among his accomplishments, and both of the above were underway at the time of his death in April 1998.\n\n[1] Crashed his automobile (Saab 9000) while drunk, speeding, not wearing a seatbelt, and talking to girlfriend Sharon Reeve on mobile phone. His last words were \"Oh shit.\" Pronounced DOA at Frenchay Hospital in Bristol.
