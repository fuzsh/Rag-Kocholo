        "text": "Gary Moore has always been my main influence ,with JImi, Beck of course along the way but Gary was the first guy whom was in complete mastery of the technical side of his sound, along with guys like SS and Yngwie of course, my three main men!!\n\nI have been a tireless advocate for all things Gary Moore since first hitting the Interwebs in 2005.\n\nI love all of Gary's various 'periods' for varied reasons. The 1983-1985 era for the sheer power and dynamics pf his complete package. His complete technical command of the instrument which only improved over the years and forced to deal with subpar lead singers Gary assumed the role of vocalist, playing and sing at the same time to a standard few others could hope to reach at all\n\nThe fan forum admittedly poorly subscribed over the years The Lord of the Strings I have been a faithful contributor to since the first days on the net.\n\nHere is the old format forum where I was still Emerald, search my threads for all the dedication I have placed towards Gary.\n\nhttp://www.livesound2.websitetoolbox.com/\n\nHere is the moore modern era of the forum still Emerald, search my posts for tons of info:\n\nhttp://www.garymoorefc.com/en/forum/vie ... f919f0a2d3\n\nhttp://www.garymoorefc.com/en/forum/vie ... f919f0a2d3\n\nAnd the Guitar Threads which I felt I singlehandedly kept going for years:\n\nhttp://www.garymoorefc.com/en/forum/vie ... f919f0a2d3\n\nMy contributions to the guitars sections, with the most views I might add, I lost enthusiasm after awhile, I could write the Charvel/Fender and Gibson sections as well but never got to officially writing them though I virtually had through all my posts\"\n\nhttp://www.garymoorefc.com/en/guitars_heritage\n\nhttp://www.garymoorefc.com/en/guitars_hamer\n\nThen The Les Paul Forum where I singlehandedly defended Gary against the most spiteful and mean out of hand criticism from various clowns I hope these links can be read without a subscription.\n\nThere were moore people who attacked Gary's appearance and everything but could not fault directly his playing. All these years I kept faithful to Gary as a major fan and supporter, even though the blues years became somewhat tedious to me who longed for the Celtic rock era to return.\n\nThen in 2009 I decided to interview Gary's longstanding co-writer and faithful band member, Neil Carter.\n\nThe thrust of my interview was the rock period from when Neil first joined Gary in the early eighties and continues through the last of the rock years 1989.\n\nHere is my rough with the questions I had for Neil, my real interest lay in the Wild Frontier and After The War eras:\n\nNeil Carter Interview 2009\n\nNeil, I thank you for this opportunity to speak with you and discuss, for me one of the most musically rich and satisfying periods of rock music, your years as an integral member of the Gary Moore band.\n\nI hope to cover the time period starting with, the Victims of the Future, LP and tour , the Emerald Aisles documentary/performance video and ending with the only recorded media I have of the “After The War” tour, the 1989 Royal Ulster Hall concert, recorded in Belfast.\n\nSince I am leaving out a huge part of your musical career, from the early days, through the Gilbert O’Sullivan sessions and then Wild Horses and UFO, I would love to concentrate on what for me, is the zenith of Neil Carter, journeyman rock musician and master of many instruments, your indelible stamp and multi-faceted contribution to in my opinion, the most brilliant of Gary’s lineups in his rock, then Celtic-Rock era.\n\nI will number the questions to make it easier for us to communicate back and forth and by no means is this the final version of the interview.\n\nI already have discovered that this numbering is difficult, so I will work on the construction of the questions and answers!!\n\nAs you mentioned to me, you had told Gary about receiving the DVD’s and CD’s of primarily the Wild Frontier live tour, but I also have some downloads of earlier shows , particularly around the time of the We Want Moore era. I will send these to you as well.\n\nAs we had discussed in the earlier e-mails, the post Wild Frontier recording, the subsequent tour was for you such a great memory and you were up front with the guitar, out from behind the keys, on vocals. Whereas the After The War tour, the focus was different, the songs, from what I have read Gary has said, he felt pressure from the management, ect., to break more into the mainstream rock market, particularly in the US, hence the Ozzy collaboration, using Cozy Powell, the mega-rockband drummer, ect.\n\nAll this is a preamble to the actual interview, which will admit Neil is my first attempt at such an effort, I have been writing about my music experiences and the technical side of music, guitars and amplifiers in particular for a few years and have had, I feel a quite successful go of it and for an old guy, 55, I have learned a few things.\n\nMy moving to London at age 11, in 1966 and experiencing the excitement of the music scene there, set the tone for my life, where I became involved in electronics, to a highly specialized level, then made a career change, to nursing and now I am in open heart surgery critical care nursing at the highest level, which is stressful, yet rewarding.\n\nEnough about myself, I spent time back and forth between England and the US, returning to London in 1976 until 1983, when I left for the States again.\n\nSo I will begin the questions, I will modify all my preamble, ect., in a proper form for the finalized effort.\n\nI also will separate the gear, technical questions from the other commentary.\n\nIt would give me the greatest of pleasure to have you include this interview on your own web site at some stage…. Also I am finding as I go here some things that I have out of sequence, ect and am correcting them, so hope to have my homework done\n\nOk then here we go…\n\n1. Neil, you mentioned after your experiences with UFO, you were ready for a more stable, both musically and emotionally, experience with your career.\n\nAlso when the opportunity to join Gary’s band occurred, he was apprehensive hiring someone from such a nefarious group as, UFO, but you were in fact relieved to have more musical stability and be surrounded by a more professional environment.\n\nSo it all worked out. Could you explain the circumstances surrounding how you came to meet Gary and joining his band?\n\nFrom the Tour programme of Victims of the Future, You are quoted as saying and this is for your reference.\n\nWith UFO behind him, Neil didn’t have to wait long before Gary Moore was in the blower talking auditions. “I tried out and it was great,” Neil enthuses. “I’m really enjoying working with Gary, he’s such a talented bloke and there’s loads to learn off him.\n\nThe new album’s marvelous, it’s one of the most powerful albums I’ve ever heard.\n\nIt’s real heavy , heavier than anything I did with UFO. And that’s the other great thing about Gary – he knows exactly what he wants and how to get it. After UFO being so slapdash, it’s marvelous to be with someone so positive and who isn’t drinking himself into the ground.\n\nWith UFO there was no continuity, sometimes it’s be great, other nights, especially towards the end, it was more likely to be the pits. With Gary you know the shows are gonna be of a certain consistently high standard. He never cheats the audience.”\n\n2. Recording the LP Victims of the Future you contributed to the writing of Victims of the Future and Empty Rooms and Murder in the Skies.\n\nThis is the first appearance of Empty Rooms and you are playing keyboards and contributing backing vocals. The rhythm section on this LP was Neil Murray on bass and the great Ian Paice on drums.\n\nCraig Gruber was the touring bassist though, not Neil Murray? But then Gruber left for personal reasons and Bob Daisley was on board\n\nHow was it working, recording and touring with that lineup?\n\nThen the We Want Moore recordings took place\n\nThen I believe the fantastic Emerald Aisles was filmed on the Irish leg of that tour.\n\nThis was the first experience of the band with the brilliant NFL films, who certainly took things to another whole level, with their professional camerawork and superb editing.\n\nI have seen some clips from the year 1986 and sent you a video from Japan on tour in 1986.\n\nI believe the second LP you recorded with Gary was Run For Cover, which to myself as a huge Gary Moore fan and sort of historian, to me, this LP was a combination of attempts to have Glenn Hughes do lead vocals. Gary also had recorded tracks with other keyboardists, including Andy Richards and Don Airey. You are featured as co-writer on the tracks, All Messed Up, and of course the incredible Empty Rooms.\n\nI know that in later touring, you would play guitar and sing vocals on All Messed Up, which was a big crowd pleaser type tune.\n\nI am curious as to the fact that on Empty Rooms on the LP sleeve, you are listed as backing vocals, but Andy Richards is the keyboardist!\n\nDid Empty Rooms success as a single place it on the following album, I apologize, but I don’t have the answers..to why this occurred!\n\nYou did provide keys and backing vocals on Listen To Your Heartbeat, which to me were a highlight of that tune.\n\nThe fact that there were 5 different producers I believe, may have contributed to the confusion, as well as three different vocalists, three different drummers and three different keyboard players!!\n\nAs far as the rhythm section was concerned, there were various lineups for this album, including, Glenn Hughes on bass, Phil Lynott on certain tracks, including Military Man, Bob Daisley, who would become the regular bassist and various drummers.\n\nCharlie Morgan, Paul Thompson (ex-Roxy Music), Gary Ferguson and the appearance of James ‘Jimbo’ Barton, who played sampled drums, which were to play such an integral part of the next studio LP, Wild Frontier. I get the impression that the Run For Cover was a combination of sessions and as Glenn Hughes, for various reasons, didn’t work out as bassist and vocalist, the touring lineup would be different.\n\nThe Live in ’85 tour followed next with some personnel changes. It is interesting to follow the band through the various clips, including some that I sent you.\n\nThe interval to the next album, the masterpiece Wild Frontier which Gary pretty much recorded with a drum machine and no live drums. To me this is where you assume more of a leadership role in the band Neil.\n\nI suppose due to the revolving drum chair issue, at least the drummers weren’t exploding ala Spinal Tap !!, the majority of the drum track demos were done t Marcus Studio in London, with the Linn 9000. Roland Carridge ‘Reflex’ did some of the overdubs.\n\nAs a guitarist, this period brought about changes to Gary’s guitar lineup.\n\nThe Custom Shop Charvels he obtained from what I can ascertain in my research in 1986, the red rosewood board and the white maple board models, with the top mount Floyd Rose Tremolos, and single EMG pickups.\n\nYou had been playing Washburns earlier and the occasional Hamer, both excellent guitars. I am sort of ignorant of keyboards so I apologize for not detailing the models, I have the various models listed in the tour programmes.\n\nI have read that Martin Prior was your keyboard/guitar tech at this time, and must compliment you on your excellent live keyboard and guitar tones!!\n\nThe mysterious Keith Page, who was Gary’s tech for the Wild Frontier tour, I can find no reference to on the internet, he seems to have disappeared off the map.\n\nAs you mentioned you would be getting together with Gary at some time, I have a whole load of questions for him, not too anorak about the live WF tour guitar tones, which from both of you are absolutely amazing..\n\nI know that Gary’s main setup consisted of his amazing Marshall 1972 Super Bass, which had originally been repainted purple and Gary returned to traditional black, he also used two other 100 watt Marshall heads, each with a single 4X12”, the signal chain an Ibanez Tube Screamer, then a Roland 555 Space Echo connected to a volume pedal, then into a Roland SDE 3000 Digital delay and then into the magical Roland Dimension D. where the single is split into two stereo channels. During the Stockholm video, I can see Gary reaching over to adjust something to the right of Eric’s drum riser.\n\nWhat monitoring did you have from all the various other instruments, on your keyboard side?\n\nAgain as I have told you the Live at Stockholm video, is actually one of my favourite concerts of all time. The superb audio recording, the great NFL films editing, ect.\n\nYour playing and enthusiasm Neil certainly makes this show, and this is displayed through the whole show. I know that the band played “Shapes of Things” on many of the un-edited bootlegs I have from this tour and also on ‘Military Man’, another of my favorite tunes, Gary often improvises after the first softer solo. This is captured in film from the 1989 “After The War” show, which is spoiled for me by the constant audio problems Gary was undergoing during that live broadcast. Do you think the broadcasting efforts had something to do with those issues. His guitar tone has no sustain and from the beginning of the show is looking stage right to his tech. I don’t know if it was a monitor issue, but the guitar tone is dreadful, not Gary’s playing and I wish other shows had been filmed as that is the only video of my beloved Blood of Emeralds, that I possess, but I am jumping ahead a few years!!\n\nOn the WF Stockholm show, I’m sure it has been edited for time, ect.\n\nI know that you enjoyed playing with Eric Singer as he is a fabulous drummer and well suited to the big arena rock stage. Also the amazing Bob Daisley, a great musician in his own right, who played with Gary’s band for quite a few years.\n\nI have a question about the recording of the WF LP. How involved were you in that process? I am sensing Gary, post Phil’s death, had worked on these tunes, with the Linn drums. How much keyboards did you contribute, if any to this album?\n\nThe genesis of this incredible lineup is the touring unit that it became, the tightest most entertaining and multi-faceted band Gary has ever had imo!\n\nThat you would come out front for Shapes of Things and all All Messed Up, and your great backing vocals and guitar work on this tour.\n\nTo me being a fan, you still were so young Neil, but achieving great critical success and many, many Gary Moore/Neil Carter fans will tell you that this lineup is their favorite of all time!\n\nThat your voice melds so well with Gary, makes the interchange on the vocals a true joy!\n\nThe interplay between you and Gary and the communication that you both exhibit is absolutely amazing, just a nod or so and the band is off. I have to say of all of Gary’s keyboardists, your contribution and interplay with his guitar is on another whole level!\n\nI realize the questions are few and far between, but I am trying something different here and not the usual boring question and answer format, which always leaves me, a fan with specialist knowledge frustrated as the interviewer always seems to ask questions or maybe their questions and answers are edited in such a way as to lose the focus and drive I am seeking in this experience!\n\nPersonally I am excited to obtain inside knowledge of one of my all time favorite bands and gain an insight into some of your thoughts and feelings about these times.\n\nI know when Gary made the decision to go in the blues direction, which was certainly successful for him, that was not an area that you cared to go into, I have read.\n\nThe After The War recording and tour, gave me the sense of the end of an era. As I mentioned previously, Gary’s pressure to get more commercial rock exposure from management and the record company and the Sharon/Don Arden management certainly had something to do with it.\n\nCan you detail some of the background of the After The War LP recording. I have read that you were inspired to write Blood of Emeralds whilst in Dublin.\n\nI have to say that Gary’s Celtic rock inspired songs are amongst my favorites.\n\nThe way I understand it is that you came up with the music and melody for BoE and then Gary added his autobiographical lyrics, or was the song a collaboration of a more close nature?\n\nI know that in his writing of WF, the Celtic influenced songs, was an exciting direction for Gary and, the whole tribute to the loss of what could have been with Phil Lynott, is so sad, yet the melodies are so strong and the guitar playing, a whole new level for Gary, displaying a power, he had only hinted at before..\n\nI must tell you that the beautiful melody of Empty Rooms and more so Blood of Emeralds, which brings tears literally to my eyes, every single time I hear it, the power and emotion, the incredible loss and sadness, encapsulated in such a haunting melody of beauty, which, though I love Black Rose very much, Blood of Emeralds is a masterpiece work.\n\nYour unique contribution to what is my favorite Gary Moore band era, is what makes the difference.\n\nAs much as I enjoy Still Got The Blues, After Hours and the superb tribute Blues For Greeny, the 1984-89 era is absolutely classic.\n\nSuch a shame that Virgin doesn’t place Emerald Aisles and Live in Stockholm on DVD, with remastered sound and extras is a shame as many, many fans want this.\n\nLast year a Japanese friend I have was able to obtain for me a Maxon ST-01 Super Tube Screamer, which I have thought for some time may have been, or the Ibanez version, an integral part of the great WF guitar tone. It’s the tone with the gain set just on the brink of feeding back, such as on the extended opening of Over The Hills and Far Away and also the Loner, where your keys make the song as enjoyable as it is and such an improvement over the earlier Cozy Powell album version.\n\nAs the Wild Frontier era was one of your favourites , this time period until the After The War recording and final tour are what fascinates me the most.\n\nI apologize for the disjointedness of this so far.\n\nI do feel a connection to be able to meld an interesting interview of memories that you and perhaps Gary have of those times, to document one of rocks classic lineups and not to discredit the earlier politically brave songs that Gary wrote like Murder in the Skies and Victims of the Future.. The consistently high standard of writing and playing exhibited in those years will never be matched again, I feel.\n\nSo let me know your thoughts Neil, as I say, this is a fluid work in progress and I have tried to research as best I can the chronology and facts, ect.\n\nYes, I enjoy the technical nature of the writing and touring, but the human side behind the music, interests me as much.\n\nI can’t tell you how happy I was to hear that you were to watch the videos with Gary again, that brings joy to me as a fan as those were great times and being a long time supporter of Gary as well, he has gone through so many rough times recently, especially, unfortunately from my side of the pond. Just let him know many of us believe in his integrity and commitment as a musician, still to this day. A few years back I tried to contact Gary through Graham Lilley, which I feel didn’t even reach Gary himself.\n\nI feel that my concept of the happy and sad times of the GM band featuring Neil Carter, is the focus of my interview.\n\nThat Neil Carter is the ingredient that is most important, cannot be overstated and I mean this most sincerely Neil.\n\nI wanted to send you some rough thoughts I have and look things over and then give me some feedback and I can firm up a more formal interview, if needed.\n\nAlso since I transferred all my rare VHS tapes to DVD, if Gary wants any copies as I also have his An Evening of the Blues, Blues Alive, The Jack Bruce 50th Birthday show, and Blues For Greeny, if he would like them on DVD format!!\n\nLet me know your thoughts Neil and I’ll work some more in this and as I said, would be honored to have your input and will make a great addition for your web page as well!!\n\nThanks Neil\n\nDave\n\nPhoenix,Az. USA 23/09/09\n\nNeil Carter, the unsung hero of the Gary Moore Band's greatest years\n\nWithout a doubt, as one who has studied the music of Gary Moore from quite early on in his career, the introduction of the multi-talented Neil Carter to Moore's rock band lineups, was indeed the catalyst for some of the finest and most enduring musical milestones in this phase of Gary's career. That Neil would unselfishly contribute his dynamic writing, playing abilities and performances, being such a gifted one in all these areas, truly is the mark of a great musician. To me the zenith of this collaboration, was the \"Wild Frontier\" era, even though Neil's actual contributions to the recorded album are not as substantial as other of Gary's albums, this LP and to a great deal as well, the \"After The War\" album, are standouts to me, though earlier albums have Moore/Carter compositions that are just as great.\n\nRecently Neil was kind enough to contribute some of his valuable time to answer some questions, about this time frame and the demise as it turned out of Gary's rock era. What I have personally learned from Neil as a writer, is to place oneself somewhat apart from the subject, and to not make assumptions, no matter how well informed! To the true dyed in the wool Moore fan, the guitar, keyboard and vox contributions from Neil, contribute that final percentage of magic. This really brought out the best in the bands leader. Certainly Neil has had a well rounded rock music career and would be successful no matter what group he contributed to, but the magic elixir that is Carter and Moore, cannot be denied...\n\nLet's start with the leaving of UFO and your call from Gary, asking you to audition/join his band. How did it feel to suddenly be in the presence of a much more organized creative musical experience?\n\nIt was very refreshing and also to get the chance to play with Ian Paice was quite a pull for me. Initially I was just going to do the US tour supporting Def Leppard but I got on well with Gary and stayed for quite a long time as it turned out! The main difference was that UFO was very much perceived as a band and I felt, initially, rather uncomfortable with being part of what could have been interpreted as a \"backing group\". A bit of the old UFO ego coming to the surface! However my initial fears were groundless as in reality it never felt totally like that. What was a bit strange was playing third on the bill to Def Leppard when they had, 2 years prior to that, supported UFO and 5 years before carried my amps into a gig in Sheffield when I was with Wild Horses. But I thought \"if Ian can rise above this, I can\"!\n\nGary had already recorded \"Corridors Of Power\" when you joined and you contributed to the writing of \"Victims Of The Future\". Can you describe what it was like to first of all write with Gary and then transferring that to the recording process?\n\nGary was always keen to get ideas for songs and I actually was the most involved with the recording process of that album, more than any of the others. I had a load of unused riffs and ideas so it was good having someone to \"bounce off\" like that. We worked the ideas into basic song format and then Gary went away and wrote lyrics. I don’t think we did that many demos for that album, but I could be wrong.\n\nYou have said that \"Empty Rooms\" was a work in progress when you joined Gary's band, can you recount when you first had the genesis for the beautiful melody of this song?\n\nI had only really written the bare bones of it and my input was to the chord structure and mood, I wrote it in a hotel room in Texas if I remember rightly! The version I have from the UFO times sounds quite like it in some ways but Gary must take full credit for the melody and overall finish on that one!\n\nI am interested in the time frame from \"Victims Of The Future\" to \"Run For Cover\". Did Gary's working with Phil Lynott in a way, plus his experimentation with Glenn Hughes as lead vocalist, plus the multiple producers, and other players, contribute to what I feel to be Gary's least cohesive LP of that era?\n\nHmmm. I suppose it was a touch fragmented and perhaps there was a bit of ‘direction finding’ involved. He hit gold with Peter Collins though and I think the best work is with him by far. I liked the rerecorded Empty Rooms, sadly the Glenn Hughes vocal is in a vault somewhere. I wish I’d had the foresight to take a copy home!\n\nAlso Andy Richards playing keys on the version of \"Empty Rooms\" on \"Run For Cover\", how did that happen?\n\nThe connection with Andy came through Peter Collins I think, he used a Fairlight and there was lots of \"fairy dust\" courtesy of him. I think they were keen to use as much of the new technology as they could so he did the \"expensive\" keyboard parts. He worked a lot with the Pet Shop Boys who were sort of ‘cutting edge’ with keyboards etc. and Gary wanted a bit of that.\n\nBy what time period did you feel the completion of the core group of Gary's band, with different drummers and then no drummer at all on \"Wild Frontier\"?\n\nActually around the aftermath of \"Run for Cover\" and the tour that followed it. Bob had become a regular feature but we still could never quite settle on a drummer. They always seemed to come and go. The best all round was probably Gary Ferguson although he only did one tour.\n\nIt is my impression that once the band consisting of yourself, Bob Daisley, Eric Singer and Gary was finalized, that band lineup never recorded another album post the touring for \"Wild Frontier\", and that after that long tour, this band was ready to do such a fantastic album it would seem, again what happened post the Wild Frontier tour and again the gap to \"After The War\"?\n\nI look back on it and there were always flaws with each drummer, hard to believe but there were. Gary was always a stickler for tempos and the maintaining of them. Drummers can speed up and slow down, there are numerous examples in the live material, and in the studio it became very frustrating. So the sampled drums were the answer. I am still to this day actuely aware of this and my poor kids at school, particularly the drummers in our Big Band get hell from me if the tempo shifts! Mind you it hasn’t harmed any of them through the last 15 years. Therefore when it came to \"After The War\" we used machines and by the time we toured I think Eric was busy or it was felt that a new guy would be the best way forward. This all goes against the ethos of laying backing tracks as a band, rather strange that nowadays the nature of Gary’s music is more feel based. The one with the best feel was actually Bobby Chouinard but unfortunately he was the one who was a wee bit unreliable and something of a loose cannon. But also an entertaining character!\n\nI am not aware of the circumstances surrounding the recording of \"After The War\", other than I had read you regretted Eric Singer, either not being available or Gary's reuniting with Cozy Powell, as somewhat of a disappointment for you personally.\n\nYes, I wasn’t a great Cozy fan (quite a lot of baggage there) and I liked Eric a lot as a person. He was always really easy to work with and very funny. I think he is a real \"stadium rock\" drummer but not cocky with it which is probably why people like Alice Cooper and Kiss have him around to this day. A very genuine guy.\n\nI have read other books, especially on Black Sabbath, where Cozy became quite involved with the production of the records he was asked to play on. What were your feelings Neil, after the huge success of the WF lineup and the sheer ability and power of that band, and then it seemed another cut and paste type effort during the recording of \"After The War\"?\n\nI liked that way of working to be honest and live/studio situations were always quite separate entities. Initially it was Gary, myself and the drum guy (whose name eludes me) in Denmark recording the basic tracks. Although not all were done there and Gary did some stuff when I wasn’t around. He has always been his own man so there are tracks along the years that I had little or absolutely no input to.\n\nI have read that you wrote your contribution to \"Blood Of Emeralds\" in Dublin. How was the song writing collaboration between you and Gary working by that time?\n\nActually I wrote the basis of that at home during a break from touring and then Gary and I played around with it. We did a lot of demoing in Dublin though and spent a number of weeks working on material. Gary was doing a tax year out of the UK so I was commuting between home and Ireland each week. That was a really nice time. I always used to give Gary tapes of song ideas and he would sift through them, picking out riffs he liked or even moods and then formulate them into a song idea. We rarely sat down and said ‘let’s write a song’ it never really worked like that. But we did bounce a lot of ideas around on After the War, more so than any other album. I really loved the ‘celtic rock’ thing and Dublin was the ideal place to do it, obviously.\n\nEric Singer is a key to the tightness of that lineup, with Bob Daisley and this solid rhythm section, I'm sure allowed you and Gary, greater freedom to concentrate on the vocals, rhythm guitars and keys, than with the other lineups.\n\nWell yes, it was very powerful certainly. I think the roles were becoming more established and the splitting of vocals was good as it provided variety and gave Gary chance to play without being lassoed to the mic.\n\nWas the \"Wild Frontier\" album fairly complete in many aspects once you became involved with it?\n\nYes, my contribution is probably the least on that although I am there somewhere! I would need to jog my memory and listen to it! I mainly did backing vocals and some keyboards. The \"big\" tracks were done with \"expensive keyboards\" so Andy was used a lot. To this day I have never met him!\n\nThe similarities of yours and Gary's voices, certainly worked well on tunes like \"Shapes Of Things\", \"Rockin' Every Night\", ect. What kind of experience was it playing guitar on stage with a player of Gary's stature?\n\nIt helped to confirm my inability to play lead! No in all honesty I am a competent rhythm player and am quite \"solid\" in my very basic ability so it suited that sound. To play with someone like Gary is inspirational and he injects so many different colours into his playing. I never once saw him play under par, he always delivered the goods! It was fortunate our voices were similar and I did enjoy singing, always have, and the only thing I truly miss about my old life is that I never sing these days which is a pity.\n\nIt is my personal feeling , as I have mentioned before, that the \"Wild Frontier\" lineup could have carried on to make an incredible record and Gary certainly hadn't said it all with the Celtic rock approach. From interviews I have read with Gary, he states management and producers were forcing him to take a more broad based approach to the material for \"After The War\" and obviously the same enthusiasm, he does not show live for that tour compared with the 1987 \"Wild Frontier\" era. What are your thoughts regarding all of this?\n\nYou know I don’t remember it being like that, but a lot of time has elapsed. I am aware that he was fed up with the stuff we were doing and wanted a change so that may have come across. I didn’t enjoy that tour as much for sure mainly because I was playing keyboards so much and felt a bit \"restricted\" on stage. Also I never felt the \"kick\" playing with Chris Slade that I got from Eric or Gary Ferguson or even Paul Thompson who wasn’t a heavy drummer really. The \"show\" looked good but perhaps the energy was less than 100%.\n\nOn the technical side, you were playing Hamer and Washburn guitars, were you also using Marshall amplification?\n\nYes always Marshall 50 amps and 4x12\" cabinets. On the \"After The War\" tour I used a Les Paul that Gary gave me for my 30th birthday.\n\nThe circumstances surrounding the live video of the Stockholm show are of great interest to many fans, still to this day. Do you feel that the video accurately captured the band at their best?\n\nIt did yes although it was a \"one hit\" so there was a lot of pressure to get it right. It captured the time and place really well and the crowd reaction, venue and material are all spot on. It’s good and I can look at it without cringing. I can quite say the same about the Emerald Aisles one….those outfits!\n\nIn particular the keyboard parts you developed for the material from the \"Wild Frontier\" album and the earlier songs, add so much dynamics to the arrangements, that these are the definitive versions of all these songs, in my opinion, Empty Rooms included. Also your enthusiasm adds greatly to the video, were you enjoying it as much as it appears?\n\nWithout a doubt. I loved that size crowd and the electricity of that night is really well captured. It’s quite sophisticated for its time and we were playing well as a unit. It also has a real feeling of, dare I say, success. I have a \"taken from the audience\" DVD from Milton Keynes and I look like I am really having a ball on that one. Natural enthusiasm I suppose and a desire to please! I still have it. (just).\n\nAs far as Gary's guitar setup for the WF tour, the voicing of his guitar, both for lead playing and rhythm, is strikingly different than his earlier live rig.\n\nI know he was using the same amplification arrangement as on earlier tours, with his '72 Super Bass, as the main amp, feeding several other 100 watt Marshall heads.\n\nThe use of the active electronic EMG pickups and the Floyd Rose tremolo systems, certainly helped to shape this voice. As a fellow guitarist, what do you think was maybe a secret to the amazing tone he got on that tour, particularly on the live video?\n\nActually he does have quite a different sound on that video. It suited the material really well, especially \"Thunder Rising\" which is great on the video. Secret...hmmmm not sure on that one although he had a really clear vision of how the tone should sit with the songs. It is very stylish and has a unique quality.\n\nAs a fan of yourself and Gary, Neil, one can't help but feel some sadness and regret that what was such a powerful , certainly live lineup, couldn't have carried on in the same vein.\n\nDo you feel that Gary, perhaps, was \"burned out\", by the constant touring and pressure to top the previous albums?\n\nWell yes, also perhaps a desire to get back to the roots, a wise move as it turned out, and not to repeat yourself again and again. I had been with him a long time by 1989 and perhaps we had run our course creatively. I didn’t really give it a lot of thought at the time of the tour but in hindsight it was obvious something had to change for him.\n\nI know that when Gary made the decision to develop the blues band concept, that you weren't particularly interested in this. Were you invited to join at first?\n\nNo, and I don’t blame him for not including me as I was a less than enthusiastic when they had their blues jamathons at sound checks. It really isn’t my sort of music although it’s enjoyable in small doses and I appreciate how well Gary does it and how a part of him it is. I like a lot of the songs Gary has done since but like I say, in small doses.\n\nPost the last LP and tour with Gary, what musical projects were you involved in?\n\nBob and I did some work with a young guitarist managed by Peter Grant, I know his name was Tommy and he may still be playing today for all I know. I did some London theatre work as a favour to a friend and spent a lot of time writing and did some demos. I explain on my website that the \"epiphany\" came one day when I sat at the publishers playing some stuff I had recorded and looked at the banks and banks of tapes he had. It was obvious that without a vehicle nothing was going to happen and I thought, \"that’s it!\" I had no idea how life would progress from there at that point.\n\nIt appears that it gives you great satisfaction to be able to pass on to future generations your love and talent for music and your work at Brighton College, must certainly be applauded. How did you get involved in playing woodwinds?\n\nMy principal instrument at school had been the clarinet and prior to my going down the \"evil path\" I had been offered a place for further study on it. But to my parents horror I jacked it all in to become a rock musician. So when I stopped all that my partner who is a harpist suggested I do a few lesson to busy myself. Typically me I plunged into it in a big way and went back and gained my qualifications. It wasn’t necessary that I did that but teaching somewhere like Brighton College which is currently \"the\" independent school in our part of England it is expected. Also I am great one for having a \"goal\" to achieve. Now I teach clarinet/saxophone and am full time Head of Woodwind and Brass at the College doing a wide variety of things.\n\nDavid Talkin (October 2009)\n\nDave goes by the forum name Emerald in The Lord Of The Strings Fan Forum, is also know as yngwie308 on most other music internet forums.\n\nHe has his own personal web blog: http://www.daveonrock.com and recently has become a major contributor to the website http://www.vintagewashburn.com.

Gary Moore has remained one of his strongest influences, right alongside, Jimi Hendrix, Jeff Beck and the masterful Peter Green.\n\n• Login to post comments\n\n© 2007-2012 garymoorefc.com\n\nLot's of SS projects on the back burner at the moment but soon when I have the time and financial stability will post all my GM stuff.\n\nFor example when I did the Neil Carter interview i sent Neil dubs on DVD from all my GM VHS tapes and bootleg CD's.\n\nNeil told me that when they got together at Neil's house in Brighton, the ideas came up to return to the Celtic rock era material and Gary became inspired as they watched my media material together.\n\nThen later post the last tour in 2010, Neil told me that my DVD's were instrumental in their band rehearsals as they had no VHS players and they used my DVD's for reference to remember the songs!\n\nYou don't know how much that meant to me...it was a dream come true and as a dyed in the wool GM fan from the start, my hopes and prayers to hear all those great songs again plus the 4 new songs, I was in nirvana.\n\nI will tell the whole story here on Rig_Talk when I get time.\n\nNeil got Gary to sign a promo poster from the After The War era with the late great Cozy Powell in the picture. Neil signed it and got Gary to especially sign it for me and post it to me from England.\n\nKinda had a role in Gary Moore getting on board with the Melvyn Frank's Collectors Choice #1 guitars. Gary's tech and apparent manager Graham Lilley's mum had died so he wasn't checking his emails.\n\nThe Gibson Custom Shop was urgently trying to reach Gary on his tour to sign off on these PG/GM Greeny replicas. So through the help of the webmaster of the LOTS forum Zoltan from Hungary we managed to reach Gary's tour manager and Gary approved the replicas, both the VOS and the Murphy aged versions.\n\nThese were sold with out the COA's, which Gary later signed and they were sent to the original buyers.\n\nIn a recent meeting with Micheal McGregor Charvel product manager (well in May) and Fender's PR guy on another matter, since Gary's two 1986 constructed Charvel Strat heads which were never built at San Dimas as they eventually appeared, these guys had never ever heard of Gary's guitars, even though he was featured in a Jackson ad in the eighties showing him playing his white Soloist!\n\nKeith Page, Gary's guitar tech put those two guitars together from various Charvel's that Gary had purchased previously.\n\nWe are discussing the white/ maple board version with the Strat pick guard and the single EMG 81 and top mount OFR. Also the red rosewood board with similar layout. The white Charvel has a body colored headstock and a black anodized R2 nut with otherwise chrome hardware. This guitar has a double hum bucker route under the Strat style pick guard, which contributes to the resonance of the guitar.\n\nI have researched all the previous Charvel's that Gary had and which ones were donors to make these two incredible Super Strat's that Gary used from 1986 onwards.\n\nThe Stockholm Isstadion concert, one of the finest live stadium shows ever recorded imo features these two incredible guitars in their finest moments.\n\nI have done intense Gary Moore equipment research since the early eighties and get lots of requests from all over the net about Gary's equipment.\n\nI have done a similar effort with Steve Stevens and Yngwie.\n\nOne day my own book will come out featuring all these guitarists, including Rory Gallagher and this is on my bucket list of projects.\n\nUnfortunately I could not afford to continue my blog Daveonrock, but have saved the content.\n\nI think I will kick off a GM appreciation thread here when I get time.\n\nI saw your new avatar and thought, let me clue Kage in on all my mega GM stuff that I have collected and written about!!\n\nThe most incredible feat by Gary on the last tour in 2010, is his use of the LP's exclusively and his adaptation of the previous Charvel/Hamer OFR material with a fixed bridge Les Paul.\n\nThe best playing of that tour came about towards the end of the tour as they extended dates in the Ukraine.\n\nGary is playing so sublimely and his singing is so soulful that it appears as if he almost knew this would be the last.\n\nBTW here is my Tommy Bolin article about his career concentrating on his equipment commissioned by BSM Treble Boosters to celebrate their exceptional Spectrum pedal\n\nhttp://www.treblebooster.net/bolin.html\n\nHere is my long thread when the 2010 (final) tour started and I was Gary's biggest cheerleader, hope these aren't locked here without membership!\n\nhttp://www.lespaulforum.com/forum/showt ... p?t=168213\n\nhttp://www.lespaulforum.com/forum/showt ... p?t=155599\n\nhttp://www.lespaulforum.com/forum/showt ... p?t=164756\n\nhttp://www.lespaulforum.com/forum/showt ... p?t=173268\n\nhttp://www.lespaulforum.com/forum/showt ... p?t=173240\n\nhttp://www.lespaulforum.com/forum/showt ... p?t=179943\n\nhttp://www.mylespaul.com/forums/search. ... id=6976451\n\nhttp://www.mylespaul.com/forums/search. ... =25&page=2\n\nhttp://www.mylespaul.com/forums/search. ... =25&page=3\n\nhttp://www.mylespaul.com/forums/search. ... =25&page=4\n\nhttp://www.mylespaul.com/forums/search. ... =25&page=5\n\nhttp://www.mylespaul.com/forums/search. ... =25&page=6\n\nhttp://www.mylespaul.com/forums/search. ... =25&page=7\n\nSorry for the bombardment but you guys are getting me excited about Gary again!!\n\nThanks for reading\n\nEmerald"
