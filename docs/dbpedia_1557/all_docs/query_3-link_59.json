        "text": "Fans of ELP - whether that stands for Emerson, Lake & Palmer or Emerson, Lake & Powell - have some new compilations to look forward to this spring.\n\nCherry Red, in partnership with Spirit of Unicorn Music, will issue Emerson, Lake & Powell's studio and live material as Complete Collection, a 3CD set due April 12. It will include the prog trio's self-titled 1986 album (including two CD-only bonus tracks and a single edit of \"The Score\") and two self-released titles on ELP's Manticore label: Live in Concert (recorded during the group's U.S. tour) and The Sprocket Sessions, a collection of live-in-studio rehearsals for said tour. Andy Pearce has remastered all the material, with PROG editor-in-chief Jerry Ewing writing liner notes.\n\nIn 1984, after five years of inactivity, keyboardist Keith Emerson and singer/instrumentalist Greg Lake were keen to reunite to record new music. Unfortunately, drummer Carl Palmer was unable to rejoin the group due to commitments with the supergroup Asia; in his stead came Emerson's friend Cozy Powell, well-known for work with Jeff Beck and Rainbow among others. (The band's ability to retain a very similar name and acronym as before was a happy accident.) Emerson, Lake & Powell continued the progressive traditions of Emerson, Lake & Palmer, blending rock epics, moving balladry and even a classical cover (\"Mars, The Bringer of War\" from Holst's The Planets).\n\nA week before the release of that ELP compilation, BMG will release Fanfare for the Common Man, a multi-disc box set devoted to the work of Carl Palmer. Palmer is, of course, the sole surviving member of the trio, still touring the hits of the group as Carl Palmer's ELP Legacy. He's also worked with British artists like Chris Farlowe and Mike Oldfield, bands like Atomic Rooster, PM (a combo Palmer founded after ELP's dissolution), 3 (a short-lived, post-Powell trio featuring Emerson, Palmer and American musician Robert Berry) and, most famously, Asia - a prog supergroup founded by Palmer, keyboardist Geoff Downes and guitarist Steve Howe (both from Yes) and ex-King Crimson/Roxy Music/Wishbone Ash vocalist John Wetton.\n\nFanfare for the Common Man, a 3CD/1 Blu-ray set, showcases the full breadth of that career. A sort of expansion/reorganization of Palmer's 2001 collection Do Ya Wanna Play, Carl?, two studio discs offer material from ELP, Asia, Oldfield, 3 and more (including the debut single sides of Palmer's first work with U.K. group The Craig). A third disc collects live tracks by Palmer, including the current line-up of Palmer's ELP Legacy (Palmer, singer/guitarist Paul Bielatowicz and Simon Fitzpatrick on bass/Chapman stick), while the Blu-ray offers Carl Palmer - The Rhythm of Life, a full-length documentary narrated by Palmer, featuring live and behind-the-scenes footage of ELP, Asia, The Crazy World of Arthur Brown and others. The set is rounded out with a copy of Palmer's 200-page illustrated autobiography, also called Fanfare for the Common Man.\n\nLinks and full track lists for both products are below.
