        "text": "Cozy Powell, The Man In Black sessions 1974.\n\nIn 1974 after I left my home in Japan I signed to RAK records in London England with my band the Arrows. We were produced by Mickie Most. In 1974 Mickie was also producing ace drummer Cozy Powell.\n\nMickie Most had already produced a hit with Cozy called \"Dance With The Devil\" and I was pleased to be called in to play bass on the follow up titled \"The Man In Black.\" A basic track had already been laid down with Clive Chamen on a large standard classic double bass (a large cumbersome instrument, generally used in jazz bands for its warm mellow tone) and Chris Spedding on guitar. Phil Denys played keyboards.\n\nMickie asked me to add some bite to the bass part by overdubbing an electric bass to the track at Morgan Studios in London. I mainly played octaves, a simple part, putting a little more high end and attack to the low end bass spectrum of the track. I used Mickie's white Fender precision bass that I also used on all the Arrows records he produced. Then Arrows guitarist Jake Hooker was brought in to played a four bar solo section in the middle of the song. A short burst of 6 notes, the same figure repeated three times with a long note sustained at the end. All the other guitars on the a-side of the record were by Chris Spedding.\n\nFor the background vocals, which were a sort a mix of a of tribal chant and what can only be described as grunts, the participants were all three Arrows (me, Jake and Paul) and Suzi Quatro with her guitarist and then boyfriend Len Tuckey. We overdubbed our chants and Ooh -Ahh parts about 4 times and with a little delay and reverb the 5 of us sounded like a large tribe.\n\nLater on that day we recorded the b-side \"After Dark,\" with Cozy Powell on drums of course, me on bass guitar, Arrows Jake Hooker on electric guitar and Phil Denys on keyboard.\n\nAfter a few run throughs of the song with direction by Mickie Most, the actual recording was simple and only took one or two takes. I was impressed with the power of Cozy Powell's drums. I don't think I've ever played with a drummer quite as loud and powerful. He made playing bass a pleasure.\n\nThe record made a peak position of # 18 in the UK charts and was also a hit in Europe.\n\nGood memories.\n\nArrows (in white suits, I'm all the way on the left) , Suzi Quatro, Len Tuckey (right behind Suzi) and Cozy Powell (kneeling, front left) all on the left in this photo.
