        "meta_description": "So I was listening to an old Cozy Powell album of jazz-fusiony stuff and wanted something in a similar vein.

Some really fiery playing; definitely more fiery keyboards than I've ever heard from Airey, and that includes his recent solo albums and Purple contributions. \n \nWhat do others think?",
