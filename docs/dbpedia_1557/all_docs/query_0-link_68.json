        "text": "You said it. It was actually raining and he had been drinking heavily before he decided to drive. He was speeding, taking on the phone and not wearing a seatbelt. Poor Cozy was ejected and that’s probably what caused his death. It’s a terrible loss but with that combination of factors, it’s not surprising.\n\nGot to chat with him a while at a small radio station I was working at. I had heard he could be moody, but there was no trace of it the night I met up with him. I'm a drummer, so we talked shop. Told him how much I loved Emerson, Lake, and Powell. He was there with Tony Iommi, so my mind was quite blown that day!\n\nDan\n\nTotally agree, Hands down! I was at the Lakeland, FL show which was recorded for the King Biscuit Flower Concert. Third row front and center. One of the best shows I ever saw! And my girlfriend seconds that recommendation.\n\nShe was married? How did her husband not know?\n\nI met Cozy walking down the street once in Dublin when he was in Whitesnake (must have been around 1984/5). Called out to him and amazingly, he stopped, had a chat, signed the only paper I had on me (my bank account book) and asked if I was coming to the show. I had tickets for the next night, he told me the show was '****in' amazing' and then strolled on. Next day, who should I see but walking down the street again but Cozy with a couple of the road crew. He saw me and my friends and said 'hello lads, enjoy the show tonight'. Talk about a no-BS guy. I won't cast judgement on anything he was involved with in the end, life is complicated for everyone and who knows the full story. To me, he was a good man and a great drummer.\n\nI don't believe Cozy Powell is a household name outside of this forum. Nobody I know has heard of him if I was to say Cozy Powell to them."
