I had the chance to see him again with Black Sabbath but something came up. I never got another chance to see him live. He's my favorite rock drummer.\n\nJeff Beck Group - Rough & Ready, Rainbow - Rising. Rainbow - On Stage, Rainbow - Long Live Rock And Roll, Michael Schenker Group - MSG. Whitesnake - Slide It In and Black Sabbath - Headless Cross. Those are some top shelf classic albums to be a part of. Cozy was one of a kind!\n\n5 Style\n\nDFO Star\n\nJoined\n\nAug 6, 2005\n\nMessages\n\n8,315\n\nReaction score\n\n2,096\n\nLocation\n\nSE Portland, Oregon\n\nRough and Ready is one of my all-time favorites, too.

I Idolized him when I was in High School. I got to see him a few times with Rainbow and The Michael Schenker Group. He Always had tremendous drum sound. And always made any project he was a part of better. They are supposedly making a documentary about him I would really like to see that.

Killer drummer and a true gentleman. He'd always get up and do an encore with us.

I have a B&W still 8x10 of Cozy from when he was in Whitesnake taken from the left side. It's in between songs and he is sitting there with sticks in hand and my gawd those sticks look like tree trunks!!!\n\nold_K_ride\n\nDFO Master\n\nJoined\n\nAug 6, 2005\n\nMessages\n\n5,318\n\nReaction score\n\n1,478\n\nLocation\n\nCincinnati,OH U.S.A.\n\n...saw him with ELP in '86...\n\nTR\n\nBrianOwens\n\nDrumsforever\n\nJoined\n\nAug 31, 2010\n\nMessages\n\n11,039\n\nReaction score\n\n251\n\nLocation\n\nButler County, OH 45011\n\nOne of my favorite drummers, definitely like his work on the Jeff Beck Group and Rough and Ready.\n\nSteveB\n\nDFO Star\n\nJoined\n\nAug 5, 2005\n\nMessages\n\n7,944\n\nReaction score\n\n290\n\nLocation\n\nSouth Hampton, NH\n\nGreat drummer. It's really too bad he didn't stay with one group through his career to get the notoriety he deserved..but then we wouldn't have gotten all those different looks at one drummer either. He played very differently from one group to the next but was still himself in the end.\n\nIf I remember correctly Cozy used a 2S, which was the heaviest of the S models back at that time. They had a little less reach than a 3S but were a good deal thicker at the same time. Barry Wilson was another drummer who used that same stick, and also played traditional. They were cymbal breakers though."
