        "text": "For My Sunday Song #391, we are kicking off a whole new 10 song set and this time around, Mike Ladano from Grab A Stack of Rock will be picking the songs. And he has a great theme and this one is Japanese Bonus Tracks. It is those songs that were recorded during the album’s recording, but didn’t make the main album around the world, but made it to the Japanese edition as a bonus track. The more, expensive sought after Japanese Edition. If it has a Japanese bonus track, Mike is going to buy it. The first song up is from Black Sabbath’s 1995 album ‘Forbidden’ and is called “Loser Gets It All”.\n\nThe music is written by Black Sabbath and the lyrics are by, then singer, Tony Martin. The song seems to be about the fact there is never a good time to lose as there are always people watching you and judging you waiting for you to fail. And when you do, they will all see it and say something. There are a lot of gambling references in the opening verse about winning, then the rest of the song is about losing.\n\nI will admit that I didn’t (and haven’t) listened to this era of Sabbath so this song is very new to me. I do like Tony Martin’s vocals so I can get behind this one. The song is a solid rocker, it short and sweet. But I like it a lot. I read somewhere that Tony Iommi loves this song and it is one of his favorites to perform which is cool…so why didn’t it make the album and was it relegated to a bonus track??? The guitar playing is great, I mean it is Tony Iommi so why wouldn’t it be. I found Mike’s review of the Forbidden album and he hated that album, but stated that this song was the best song on the album. Crazy!!\n\nContinue reading “My Sunday Song – “Loser Gets It All” By Black Sabbath” →\n\nAlright…You Picked It! Apparently, people didn’t like the new format as the vote count was way down. I am getting back to what my site is about and that is what is in my collection which is why I changed things. I was tired of the other way and needed to change…so I did. Get used to this way because this is how it will be for the time being. The first vote getter in this month’s picks ended up the winner. Therefore the winner was Cinderella’s ‘Long Cold Winter’. Here are the results.\n\nCinderella – ‘Long Cold Winter’ – 5 votes\n\nWinger – ‘Pull’ – 4 votes\n\nWhite Lion – ‘Mane Attraction’ – 2 votes\n\nNight Ranger – ‘Man in Motion’ – 2 votes\n\nPoison – ‘Look What the Cat Dragged In’ – 1 Vote\n\nThanks to all for participating. The December choices will be up on Saturday! And the choices are all now from my collection and will have a loose theme of 70’s Classics!!!\n\nCINDERELLA – ‘LONG COLD WINTER’ (1988):\n\nCinderella hit it big with their Glam Rock debut ‘Night Songs’ back in 1986 with a lot of thanks to Jon Bon Jovi who saw them play and helped them get a deal. Gene Simmons was interested first, but they weren’t interested in Gene. The debut album had them dressing all Glam in colorful outfits and I don’t think they were very fond of that whole concept. That became obvious with their second album when they went to a more all black and blue jean look and changed their sound to mostly blues rock. They wanted to distance themselves as much as they could from the Glam scene and I don’t think they did, but they at least sounded different. Fans of the debut, followed along with this one as well…I know I did.\n\nContinue reading “You Picked It!: Cinderella – ‘Long Cold Winter’ (1988) – Album Review” →\n\nFor My Sunday Song #209, we are going back to the first album that really broke in the states for Whitesnake and one of the songs that helped start it all, “Slow An’ Easy”. The song was the fourth single off the album and was written by David Coverdale and Micky Moody who were the last two remaining original members of the band at the time, Micky wouldn’t last much longer as he was replaced by John Sykes before the album’s release and is guitar parts were replaced by Sykes, but that is whole other discussion.\n\nWhitesnake was notorious at the time with critics for their “cock rock” lyrics and “Slow an’ Easy” is pretty much that to a T. The song is about Sex! No sugar coating it here, it is Sex! I wish I could give you a deeper meaning to the song, but I can’t and I wouldn’t want to as the song is what it is and it is awesome! In the 25th Anniversary edition of the album (and thanks to wikipedia), David had this to say…\n\n“Slow & Easy was recorded at 4 in the morning in Munich after a serious night’s partying…Most of the vocals is just a live ‘jam’ lyric I made up to inspire the band as we recorded…I played around with the lyric later to try and make some sense of it…”\n\nContinue reading “My Sunday Song – “Slow An’ Easy” by Whitesnake” →\n\nRecording of the ‘Slide it In’ Album started some time in 1983 and this time around Eddie Kramer was onboard to handle productions duties. And let’s just say things did not go well, but was it a band problem (as there were ton of those) or a producer problem, I don’t know. But Eddie was replaced quickly with longtime Snake producer Martin Birch.\n\nThe band problems were many on this record and for this tour. Micky Moody was back and recorded the album, but things did not go well on tour and David became an ass to Micky and he had enough and quit after the European tour and his last gig was in October 1983, prior to the release of ‘Slide It In’. His replacement was John Sykes who was the guitar player for Thin Lizzy at the time.\n\nAt the same time Sykes was brought on board, Colin Hodgkinson was let go as the bass player and former Whitesnake bass player Neil Murray was brought back in to the fold. Cozy Powell was now the drummer as Ian Paice had left after the last album and then Jon Lord left in 1984 to go reform Deep Purple so Richard Bailey was brought in to fill in. The band was in complete disarray during this time. It is amazing anything got done.\n\nContinue reading “Whitesnake – ‘Slide it In’ – Album Review (The David Coverdale Series)” →"
