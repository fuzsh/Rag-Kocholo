        "text": "Black Sabbath\n\nForbidden\n\n1.5\n\nvery poor\n\nReview\n\nby Willan92 USER (3 Reviews)\n\nFebruary 2nd, 2012 | 4 replies\n\nRelease Date: 1995 | Tracklist\n\nReview Summary: The Worst Black Sabbath album. It's rushed, uninspired, recycled and easily avoidable.\n\nForbidden... perhaps the most hated Sabbath album. I listened to this album and asked myself: \"Is this album as bad as it's reputation?\" For sure the main reason for hate is the guest vocals of Ice-T. But, anyway, there are other issues that sinks this album to hell.\n\nTony Martin voice is strange here. The same man that recorded Headless Cross album with awesome vocals records this album with \"love cr*p level vocals\". It's hard to believe it's the same singer. The prodution of CD (courtesy of Body Count's Ernie C.) doesn't help the album. It's pretty bad, and all instruments are poorly mixed.\n\nTalking about mixing and production, we have the almost inaudible bass sound (by Neil Murray) and Small-Drum-Work by Cozy Powell. Everything is courtesy of Ernie C's \"excellent\" mixing.\n\nWell, lets go beyond the lackluster production. Unfortunately, all we have here is a truly uninspired album and recycled riffs. The lyrics are bad too. Check out Can't Get Close Enough and you will understand. This factor sinks the album. It's a pity.\n\nBut there are some \"good\" songs in this pit of uninspiration. Rusty Angels is a kind of catchy song, I believe it's the best of this album. Forbidden is another catchy and good song. Kiss of Death is a good song that brings to memory Nightwing from Headless Cross album.\n\nThe worst songs are Illusion of power that attempts to be doomy, but fails (and we have Ice-T here). Can't Get Close Enough has very bad lyrics. The bonus track Loser Gets it all is really bad too. Other songs are unmemorable, recycled, bad, put your offensive word.\n\nAlthough Headless Cross is criticised by dramatic vocals (I love it, but we have some comments against it), Born Again is criticised by bad production and \"chemistry\" between Gillan and Sabbath, Seventh Star is criticised to be a cheesy 80's album and not a Sabbath album, nothing can save Forbidden from harsh criticism. Even for Sabbath fans Forbidden is easily avoided, and it's justified.\n\nBut... if you like a uninspired and boring metal album... what are you waiting for?\n\nNOTE: The grade could be lower, but I think the \"good\" songs must be considered. (1,5 out of 5)\n\nTweet\n\nuser ratings (732)\n\n1.8\n\npoor\n\nother reviews of this album\n\nbattleinthenorth (3)\n\nAn often underrated release that has its fair share of exciting moments, unfortunately bei...\n\nFritzTheCat420 (3.5)\n\n...\n\nNagrarok (1)\n\nIt is that bad....\n\nKOSTER (3)\n\nYou people need to \"Get A Grip\" and realize this album is not THAT bad. Is it perfect? Hel...\n\n91sam (2.5)\n\nIt may not be the worst album ever created, but nothing special about it......"
