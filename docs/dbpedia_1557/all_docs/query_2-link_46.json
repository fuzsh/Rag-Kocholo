He's always up there on stage going crazy, he always pushes me on when I look round. He always gives me that incentive to play because Cozy won't let anybody take it easy.\" He wasn't wrong. Cozy Powell was a talented, reliable and versatile drummer. A drummer of such calibre that he played with Jeff Beck, Rainbow, Michael Schenker, Whitesnake, Emerson and Lake, Black Sabbath and Brian May – as well as being a hugely in-demand session player. Before all of that, Powell initially came to prominence with three Mickie Most-produced top twenty singles under his own name. An extraordinary feat for an instrumentalist, and a drummer at that. The book has received many excellent reviews but as Laura says, \"whilst the book has generally been received positively and also published in Japanese, I always felt it was something of a work in progress. Since it was published, I have continued to research as well as restructuring parts of the book that I wasn't one hundred percent happy with. In essence this new version covers much more ground and in much more detail than ever.\" With the addition of new photos (many of which have never been published before), tour dates, an expansive discography, a deep dive into Cozy's cars and racing career, as well as many other new and exciting additions, this second edition of The Cozy Powell Story builds upon the original that was published around five years ago and is truly comprehensive and a worthy legacy to Cozy Powell.
