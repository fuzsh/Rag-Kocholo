THAT left an unforgettable impression on 23 year old me. Wow.\n\nHe exuded an aura of coolness, control & finesse behind the drums that I've not seen before or since.\n\nVistalite Black\n\nLudwigs in the Basement\n\nJoined\n\nFeb 17, 2015\n\nMessages\n\n6,678\n\nReaction score\n\n6,036\n\nLocation\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nHis solo stuff was real good too!\n\nSolo Albums:\n\nOver the Top (1979)\n\nTilt (1981)\n\nOctopuss (1983)\n\nThe Drums Are Back (1992)\n\nEspecially for You (1999)\n\nHere's side 1 of \"Over The Top\"\n\nPersonnel\n\nCozy Powell – drums\n\nGary Moore – guitar\n\nClem Clempson – guitar\n\nBernie Marsden – guitar\n\nJack Bruce – bass guitar\n\nDon Airey – keyboards\n\nMax Middleton – keyboards\n\nCozy played on a LOT of albums & sessions!\n\nCheck out his discography here:\n\nI really did not like that.\n\ndrummerbill\n\nDFO Master\n\nJoined\n\nNov 28, 2006\n\nMessages\n\n5,360\n\nReaction score\n\n367\n\nLocation\n\nNY-NJ Tri-state Area\n\nGot to see Cozy with ELP (Powell) at MSG and with a much \"heavier\" Journey @ The Paladium pre Steve Perry in the 70s .\n\nLast edited: Jan 26, 2020"
