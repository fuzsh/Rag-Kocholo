        "text": "Colin Trevor “Cozy” Powell (29 December 1947 – 5 April 1998) was an English rock drummer, who made his name with many major rock bands and artists like The Jeff Beck Group, Rainbow, Robert Plant, Whitesnake and Black Sabbath. On this day Powell was killed when his powerful Saab 9000 Turbo blew a tire – He was a great Saab fan.\n\nCozy Powell died on April 5, 1998 following a car crash, driving his Saab 9000 Turbo at 104 mph-167km/h in bad weather on the M4 motorway near Bristol, while talking to his girlfriend on his mobile phone. He was not wearing a seatbelt and was over the drink-drive limit.\n\nThe girlfriend of rock star Cozy Powell listened on the phone as his car spun out of control at 104mph, killing him instantly, an inquest has heard. Ms Reeve said she heard a “terribly loud noise” then Mr Powell said “Oh shit” followed by silence. She phoned the emergency services when she was unable to ring Mr Powell back. He was pronounced dead on arrival at Frenchay Hospital in Bristol.\n\nContinue reading after the ad\n\nThe Saab suffered a rear tyre puncture shortly afterwards that sent it spinning out of control. It hit the central reservation and rolled several times before coming to rest on a grass verge. He was well known for his love of fast cars and even raced Mazda saloons for a brief period in the mid-seventies.\n\nHe loved his cars (a Saab 9000 and a Ferrari) and motorbikes probably as much as his drums. At one point he quit the music business to pursue auto racing full time, becoming a Formula Three Racer."
