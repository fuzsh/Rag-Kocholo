        "text": "Like Jon Lord once said, \"playing with Cozy Powell is like a kick in the ass for every musician\". He has played in almost every hard rock veteran band!! He was one of my earliest influences (along with Ginger Baker) in choosing drums as my favourite instrument.\n\nCozy was born Colin Powell in Cirencester, on December 29, 1947. Be prepared to read his bio and his sessions list. It's endless, and I'm sure I miss LOTS of his albums (especially his work as sessionman for Mickie Most's Rak label)! But he deserved to spend time (literally months, I swear it!) in researching about him. I would have loved that Cozy had watched these pages I had written devoted to him, but it couldn't happen. :(\n\nI must note that apart from his love for music, he had another hobby, speed. He was a Formula Three racer, and we can read in his Tilt album inner sleeve the following sentence: \"Forza Ferrari!\".\n\nTHE SORCERORS\n\nHis first known band was The Sorcerers. They formed around 1965, based in his hometown, Cirencester, and they lasted until April 1968, commanded by Pete Ball (he has two other brothers musicians: bassistDenny Ball & guitarist Dave Ball, both will covered here too). Don't know the first lineups, but it was Pete who had met up with Cozy Powell in Germany in 1967, and hired him to play in the Sorcerors.\n\nKen Aston (vocals)\n\nRoy Black (bass)\n\nPete Ball (keyboards)\n\nCozy Powell (drums)\n\nThis band spent some time in Germany and then went to Turkey playing USAF bases before going back to England. When Cozy and Pete returned, Cozy stayed at the Ball household, and lived with the family on and off for the next three years. The Sorcerors changed their name to Young Blood, and signed a record deal with Pye records. They released several singles.Denny Ball first met Cozy Powell on stage at a Sorcerors gig in Frankfurt. A jam session ensued, and a very interesting musical relationship was born (read later).\n\nCASEY JONES & THE ENGINEERS\n\nDuring two months, from February 1968 to April 1968, Cozy joined this band.\n\nCasey Jones (vocals)\n\nCozy Powell (drums)\n\n+ others unknown to me\n\nTHE SORCERORS / YOUNGBLOOD\n\nA couple of months later, Cozy was back in The Sorcerors. Soon after, they changed their name to Youngblood.\n\nKen Aston (vocals)\n\nRoy Black (bass)\n\nPete Ball (keyboards)\n\nCozy Powell (drums)\n\nWhen Cozy left, he was replaced in Youngblood by Mac Poole, who later played in Chicken Shack.\n\nIDEAL MILK\n\nThis was the rehearsal band for things to come.\n\nDave Ball (lead guitar)\n\nDenny Ball (bass)\n\nCozy Powell (drums)\n\nThis is how it happened: The Ball brothers were all in Germany, in different bands. Dave was in “The Madding Crowd” in the north, and Pete was in “The Sorcerors” playing the same circuit as Denny in “The Mayfair Set”. Denny first met Cozy Powell on stage at a Sorcerors gig in Frankfurt. That close friendship between Cozy and the Ball family gave birth to Ideal Milk.\n\nThere are some early recordings by this trio including a BBC session, and some rehearsal tapes of the music which later formed the basis of the Bedlam album.\n\nACE KEFFORD STAND\n\nThis was the merge of “Ideal Milk” with the ex Move star Ace Kefford.\n\nAce Kefford (vocals)\n\nDave Ball (guitar)\n\nDenny Ball (bass)\n\nCozy Powell (drums)\n\nCozy handed his notice in to Youngblood. An interesting situation in which the Ball brothers and Cozy were all sharing the same house. Cozy was quitting Pete Ball’s band to join forces with the other Ball brothers. Fortunately, Pete Ball was very philosophical about the whole thing, and realised that Cozy was heading for a different style of playing, and that he was much more interested in a rock band.\n\nThe Ace Kefford Stand started rehearsals on September 2nd 1968. The first gig by this band was at the Belfry (home of the famous golf club) on September 21st 1968. Amongst the sell out crowd were members of The Move. Robert Plant and John Bonham also gave their support.\n\nThe Stand played some college and university gigs as they waited to secure a record deal which finally came from Atlantic Records.\n\nFrom early recording sessions at Polydor in London, they released a single, 'For your love / Gravy booby jamm' (Atlantic, Apr 69), being the A-side a cover of The Yardbirds. This song can also be found in 'The perfumed garden, vol.2' sampler compilation.\n\nA second single called “This World’s an Apple” (Oct 69, Atlantic) was released under the name of “Big Bertha featuring Ace Kefford”. This was after the band had split up. This record is now a rare collector’s item!\n\nIn mid 69, Ace Kefford quits, and the rest formed a new band, Big Bertha. But meanwhile, Cozy Powell tried to form a power trio withClem Clempson.\n\nUNNAMED TRIO\n\nAfter Bakerloo's breakup in Summer 1969, Powell and Clempson tried to form another trio, with Dave Pegg and Cozy Powell. They played only one gig in September 1969.\n\nClem Clempson (guitar)\n\nDave Pegg (bass)\n\nCozy Powell (drums)\n\nBIG BERTHA\n\nIn October 1969, Big Bertha emerges:\n\nPete French (vocals)\n\nDave Ball (guitar)\n\nDenny Ball (bass)\n\nPete Ball (keyboards)\n\nCozy Powell (drums)\n\nSometime later, the singer changes:\n\nDave McTavish (vocals)\n\nDave Ball (guitar)\n\nDenny Ball (bass)\n\nPete Ball (keyboards)\n\nCozy Powell (drums)\n\nThe band signed to United Artists and recorded four tracks. “Munich City” was released in Germany and sold well. But after weeks of inactivity, and just a handful of gigs, Cozy was approached by Jeff Beck’s management company to meet with the legendary guitarist in London.\n\nJEFF BECK rehearsals\n\nJeff Beck (guitar)\n\nDenny Ball (bass)\n\nCozy Powell (drums)\n\nCozy suggested that Denny went with him to meet up withJeff Beck. They met at the United Artists offices, and with a very eager record company managing director in tow, went on to play together as a trio at a rehearsal venue in north London.\n\nBeing well rehearsed, Denny and Cozy presented a “showcase” of just bass and drums at the start of that session, after which Jeff took up the guitar and jammed for about an hour with them.\n\nJeff suggested that they both stay at his cottage in Kent for further rehearsals.\n\nJEFF BECK GROUP\n\nIn April 1970, Cozy Powell finally decides staying with Jeff Beck, still without a real band, only them. He had been trying with other offers (Johnny Winter, for example).\n\nJeff Beck (guitar)\n\nCozy Powell (drums)\n\nIn 1970, they cut several songs at Motown Studios with local sessionmen like James Jamerson, commanded by producer Mickie Most, but they still remain unreleased.\n\nTONY JOE WHITE\n\nTony Joe is a singer and songwriter. He has written hits for famous singers such as Elvis Presley, Dusty Springfield, Tom Jones, Brook Benton and many others. Some of his most famous songs are \"Rainy night in Georgia\" and \"Polk salad Annie\". When he was invited to play in The Isle of Wight Festival in 1970, he played there with the only company of Cozy on drums.\n\nTony Joe White (vocals, guitar)\n\nCozy Powell (drums)\n\nThe festival consisted of 5 days, although the official starting point was on August 28th. They played on the 2nd day, August 27th, along with Supertramp, Groundhogs, Cactus and Howl, Black Widow, Terry Reid and Eric Roberts & Everyone.\n\nUnfortunately, the original 3LP Isle of Wight / Atlanta Pop Festival (Sony) and the recent 2CD live album from that concert, Message to love: The Isle of Wight Festival 1970 (1995, Castle/Sony) don't include any track from that Tony Joe White performance.\n\nBIG BERTHA (again)\n\nIn January 1971, a promoter in Germany wanted to book the now defunct Big Bertha. United Artists agreed to limited funding for the band to go over and perform. Cozy comes back to the band.\n\nDave Ball (guitar, vocals)\n\nDenny Ball (bass, vocals)\n\nCozy Powell (drums)\n\nA series of gigs in north Germany were put together and at last the band who called themselves Ideal Milk went on the road as a trio. Denny and Dave somehow managed the vocals over a thunderous Cream/Hendrix type of music full of solos and awesome power.\n\nDuring the tour a live recording was made. And, in June 1999, an album has been just released with these live tapes!!! Called Big Bertha, it contains energetic live performances by the trio.\n\nAt the end of the tour, the trio vowed to reform ‘at some juncture’ and ‘do it properly’.\n\nCozy Powell went back to the Jeff Beck Group, Denny Ball joined Long John Baldry, and Dave Ball joined superb band Procol Harum.\n\nImages/scans available:\n\nBig Bertha brand new album cover (13 Kbs)\n\nJEFF BECK GROUP (again)\n\nIn April 1971, they form a real band:\n\nJeff Beck (guitar)\n\nAlex Ligertwood (vocals)\n\nClive Chaman (bass)\n\nMax Middleton (keyboards)\n\nCozy Powell (drums)\n\nAnd then, Bob Tench joins a new edition of Jeff Beck Group, in July 1971.\n\nJeff Beck (guitar)\n\nBob Tench (vocals)\n\nClive Chaman (bass)\n\nMax Middleton (piano)\n\nCozy Powell (drums)\n\nThey were a smashing band. I have some concerts from this period, and they were dynamite live. Many Jeff Beck fans don't like this lineup (maybe because of a strong influence of soul music), but I love it!\n\nJeff Beck Group is produced by great guitarist Steve Cropper. It contains several covers: Stevie Wonder (Jeff Beck idol) and Bob Dylan, as well as a rendition of blues classic \"Going down\" (everybody plays this song: from Freddie King to The Who orPeter Green - see later, as well as Joe Satriani/Steve Vai/Eric Johnson trio). With incredible instrumentals, like \"Definitely maybe\" or \"I can't give back the love I feel for you\".\n\nBut Jeff Beck dissolves the band in July 1972, to make his dream: a power trio with Carmine Appice and Tim Bogert (of course, Beck Bogert & Appice was their name).\n\nImages/scans available:\n\nJeff Beck Group lineup: from left to right: Bobby Tench, Max Middleton, Jeff Beck, Clive Chaman, Cozy Powell (9 Kbs)\n\nJeff Beck Group album cover (11 Kbs)\n\nRough and Ready album cover (15 Kbs)\n\nSPIRIT\n\nNext (brief) step for Cozy is joining Spirit band for a short stint when his drummer, Ed Cassidy, left them.\n\nChristian Staehely (guitar, vocals)\n\nJohn Locke (keyboards)\n\nAl Staehely (bass, vocals)\n\nCozy Powell (drums)\n\nSorry, but I must say that Spirit, without Randy California (you're very missed, Randy!) and Ed Cassidy, who had left them in that period, was not real Spirit.\n\nCozy only stayed in the band during September and October 1972.\n\nBEAST / BEDLAM\n\nNovember 1972 and the core of Big Bertha/Ideal Milk reunites to form the ultimate band. Originally called The Beast, they changed the name to avoid confusion with another band in the States.\n\nFrank Aiello (vocals)\n\nDave Ball (guitar)\n\nDenny Ball (bass)\n\nCozy Powell (drums)\n\nThey released a self titled album, Bedlam. With help from old Cozy mate, Max Middleton (keyboards). Produced by the late Felix Pappalardi (Cream's producer, and bassist in Mountain), who also played keyboards. They also released a single, 'I believe in you / Whiskey and wine' (1973, Chrysalis).\n\nThere are also some sessions of unreleased material which were scheduled for Bedlam II, but unfortunately, that never happened, as they split in April 74. (Please, someone should release this album!!!!!!)\n\nThere is also a CD of Bedlam from a live radio show recorded in 1974 when they were on tour with Black Sabbath. If someone has a copy of it, PLEASE write me an email message!\n\nImages/scans available:\n\nBedlam album cover (17 Kbs)\n\nBedlam album rear cover (24 Kbs)\n\nCOZY POWELL'S HAMMER\n\nFirst Cozy band with his own name in it. Formed in May 1974, a powerful lineup, built with several former bandmates.\n\nFrank Aiello (vocals)\n\nBernie Marsden (guitar)\n\nDon Airey (keyboards)\n\nClive Chaman (bass)\n\nCozy Powell (drums)\n\nBut sometime later, Clive Chaman has to abandon the band, and Clive himself recommendedNeil Murray to substitute him for several gigs. As far as I know, this is the first time Neil and Cozy played together. And as we'll check along this page, it still is a very fantastic team.\n\nFrank Aiello (vocals)\n\nBernie Marsden (guitar)\n\nDon Airey (keyboards)\n\nNeil Murray (bass)\n\nCozy Powell (drums)\n\nBut Cozy splits the band in April 1975.\n\nSTRANGE BREW\n\nCozy Powell's next adventure was put up with former companionClem Clempson again, and Greg Ridley (from Humble Pie). They were called Strange Brew. It was July 1975.\n\nClem Clempson (guitar)\n\nGreg Ridley (bass)\n\nCozy Powell (drums)\n\nThey only stayed for two months, because of an accident that happened to Clem, who broke his wrist.\n\nImages/scans available:\n\nStrange Brew photo: from left to right: Clem Clempson, Cozy Powell, Greg Ridley (44 Kbs)\n\nRAINBOW\n\nAnd here it starts Cozy's more known period. Everybody knows that, Rainbow was the band that Ritchie Blackmore put together after leaving Deep Purple. With a superb vocalist, Ronnie James Dio, this band always had fantastic musicians in it.\n\nIn August 1975, Cozy joins the band:\n\nRonnie James Dio (vocals)\n\nRitchie Blackmore (guitar)\n\nMickey Lee Soule (keyboards)\n\nJimmy Bain (bass)\n\nCozy Powell (drums)\n\nIt starts the change of musicians in Rainbow's band...\n\nIn October 1975, new lineup:\n\nRonnie James Dio (vocals)\n\nRitchie Blackmore (guitar)\n\nTony Carey (keyboards)\n\nJimmy Bain (bass)\n\nCozy Powell (drums)\n\nThis was one of the more stable (and superb) lineups. They released a fantastic album, Rising, where Cozy's playing is really amazing. This is the first album I heard where Cozy played. This was 17 years ago, and today, he's still one of my 3 favourite drummers. They also released a very good live album On stage (2LP, now 1CD).\n\nAlong the years, as it happens with Deep Purple, there has been released more live material from the band. In 1990, it was released Live in Germany, a double CD from the Rainbow 1976 European tour (On stage was recorded in the Japanese tour).\n\nIn January 1977, Jimmy Bain is fired, and Mark Clarke enters the band. Mark Clarke had a great curriculum, and has played with several other members of my Olympus (Colosseum - withClem Clempson and Jon Hiseman, Tempest - with Allan Holdsworth, Paul Williams, Ollie Halsall and Jon Hiseman, Uriah Heep - withKen Hensley...).\n\nRonnie James Dio (vocals)\n\nRitchie Blackmore (guitar)\n\nTony Carey (keyboards)\n\nMark Clarke (bass)\n\nCozy Powell (drums)\n\nBut in July 1977, Clarke and Carey are fired. New lineup in August 1977:\n\nRonnie James Dio (vocals)\n\nRitchie Blackmore (guitar)\n\nDavid Stone (keyboards)\n\nBob Daisley (bass)\n\nCozy Powell (drums)\n\nThe album Long live rock'n'roll contains some classic from the band, like \"Kill the king\" (co-written by Cozy), \"Gates of Babylon\", and a fantastic ballad like \"Rainbow eyes\".\n\nI don't know exactly when, but Daisley leaves the band (he was later in Uriah Heep), and Roger Glover enters. So, two Deep Purple members in the band now:\n\nRonnie James Dio (vocals)\n\nRitchie Blackmore (guitar)\n\nDavid Stone (keyboards)\n\nRoger Glover (bass)\n\nCozy Powell (drums)\n\nIn November 1978, the great Ronnie Dio leaves the band, to join Black Sabbath. He's replaced with Graham Bonnet. And a very good reforcement, the fantastic Don Airey, enters the band, thus rejoining with former colleague Cozy Powell.\n\nGraham Bonnet (vocals)\n\nRitchie Blackmore (guitar)\n\nDon Airey (keyboards)\n\nRoger Glover (bass)\n\nCozy Powell (drums)\n\nThey release a new album, Down to Earth, and then, in August 1980, Cozy quits. Cozy starts conversations with Gary Moore about forming a joint band, but contractual problems between managements forced them to abandon the idea (although several years later, it came reality). At this point (confirmed by Cozy himself in an interview in a Spanish magazine) he received offers to join Led Zeppelin, Status Quo and The Who, but he chose another option. Let's see...\n\nThere is a Rainbow later release, called Finyl vinyl, which includes several live tracks. There are several lineups in the album, and Cozy Powell appears in some of the tracks.\n\nThere is an album credited to Ritchie Blackmore, called Rock Profile, volume two (Apr 1991, Connoisseur), where there are included 3 live tracks from Rainbow, when Cozy was in the band.\n\nThere's a collective album that contains live tracks recorded in the Monsters of Rock festival from August 1980 at Castle Donington. It includes two tracks by the Rainbow lineup with Graham Bonnet, 'Stargazer' and 'All night long'. As far as I know, this album has never been released on CD. Other artists appearing there: Scorpions (2 tracks), plus 1 track from April Wine, Saxon, Riot and Touch.\n\nImages/scans available:\n\nRainbow Rising album cover (15 Kbs)\n\nOn stage album cover (16 Kbs)\n\nLive in Germany album cover (15 Kbs)\n\nDown to Earth album cover (15 Kbs)\n\nMonsters of rock album cover (41 Kbs)\n\nFinal vinyl album cover (12 Kbs)\n\nCozy and his drumkit (6 Kbs)\n\nCozy and his drumkit (58 Kbs)\n\nThe main core in early Rainbow: from left to right: Ritchie Blackmore, Ronnie James Dio, Cozy Powell (34 Kbs)\n\nRainbow lineup: From left to right: Tony Carey, Ronnie James Dio, Ritchie Blackmore, Cozy Powell, Jimmy Bain (59 Kbs)\n\nRainbow live photo (65 Kbs)\n\nCozy live with Rainbow (30 Kbs)\n\nCozy live with Rainbow (47 Kbs)\n\nRainbow live: Cozy Powell and Ritchie Blackmore (27 Kbs)\n\nRainbow live: Cozy Powell, Ritchie Blackmore & his Strat (69 Kbs)\n\nRainbow live: overall vision of the stage (83 Kbs)\n\nGARY MOORE & FRIENDS\n\nAround 1979, Gary Moore called Cozy to play on a TV appearance at the 'Old Grey Whistle Test' program, promoting Gary's album Back on the streets. This was the very interesting lineup:\n\nGary Moore (guitar, vocals)\n\nScott Gorham (guitar)\n\nPhil Lynott (bass, vocals)\n\nDon Airey (keyboards)\n\nCozy Powell (drums)\n\nThey played at least two songs, 'Back on the streets' and 'Don't believe a word'. Oh, who may have a copy of that? :) :)\n\nCOZY POWELL AND FRIENDS\n\nIn January 1980, Cozy asks some of his friends to back him in some BBC broadcasts. What a lineup!!!\n\nClem Clempson (guitar)\n\nJack Bruce (bass)\n\nDon Airey (keyboards)\n\nMax Middleton (keyboards)\n\nCozy Powell (drums)\n\nThey appeared in the 'Old Grey Whistle Test' TV show, as well as a radio broadcast for an 'In concert' program. Those recordings are very powerful. Amazing lineup and amazing playing. The track listing included songs from Cozy's 1st album, plus Jack Bruce's own 'Ticket to waterfalls'.\n\nMICHAEL SCHENKER GROUP (MSG)\n\nMichael Schenker gained his reputation as the guitarist in UFO, although he was before in another great band, Scorpions. When he left UFO, he tried to form his own band (more details in my page aboutDenny Carmassi), but his first solo album is recorded with session musicians. After that album, he forms his live band in August 1980.\n\nGary Barden (vocals)\n\nMichael Schenker (guitar)\n\nChris Glen (bass)\n\nPaul Raymond (keyboards)\n\nCozy Powell (drums)\n\nA super-band! They recorded a studio album, called MSG, on Spring 1981, and later they released a fantastic live album One night at Budokan (originally a 2LP, now a 1CD but the Chrysalis CD edition misses one lenghty track, \"But I want more\", and all the fantastic inner photos, so beware!), recorded on August 12, 1981. They were dynamite live. But Michael Schenker never retained his musicians for a long time, and in November 1981, Raymond and Barden are fired. They remain as a quartet in February 82, where an old Cozy bandmate appears here, Graham Bonnet.\n\nGraham Bonnet (vocals)\n\nMichael Schenker (guitar)\n\nChris Glen (bass)\n\nCozy Powell (drums)\n\nBut Cozy starts having some problems with Michael Schenker, finally leaving the band in April 1982.\n\nImages/scans available:\n\nOne night at Budokan album cover (24 Kbs)\n\nMichael Schenker lineup: from left to right: Chris Glen, Paul Raymond, Michael Schenker, Cozy Powell, Gary Barden (19 Kbs)\n\nMSG photo: (8 Kbs)\n\nWHITESNAKE\n\nOh, more Deep Purple links!\n\nDavid Coverdale assembles a new lineup in September 1982.\n\nDavid Coverdale (vocals)\n\nMicky Moody (guitars)\n\nMel Galley (guitars)\n\nColin Hodgkinson (bass)\n\nJon Lord (keyboards)\n\nCozy Powell (drums)\n\nA superb band!\n\nThere is a video from this lineup: Whitesnake commandos - Donington 1983 (1983, EMI). They played in Spain, with Meat Loaf opening the concert.\n\nThey only released an album, Slide it in. But there are two different editions of the album. The European one (released on EMI) was recorded with this lineup, but the American edition (released on Geffen) contains all the guitar parts re-released by new guitar axe John Sykes, and it seems that Colin parts were re-recorded by his replacement,Neil Murray.\n\nIn September 1983, Moody and Hodgkinson leave the band, being replaced in December 1983 by known guyNeil Murray (he was Colin's predecessor), and the guitar axe John Sykes, coming from Thin Lizzy.\n\nDavid Coverdale (vocals)\n\nJohn Sykes (guitar)\n\nMel Galley (guitar)\n\nJon Lord (keyboards)\n\nNeil Murray (bass)\n\nCozy Powell (drums)\n\nAfter a silly accident, Galley injures his hand, and has to abandon the band. This happens in April 1984.\n\nDavid Coverdale (vocals)\n\nJohn Sykes (guitar)\n\nJon Lord (keyboards)\n\nNeil Murray (bass)\n\nCozy Powell (drums)\n\nBut in May 1984, it happens an important change. Jon Lord leaves the band, to rebuild Deep Purple.\n\nDavid Coverdale (vocals)\n\nJohn Sykes (guitar)\n\nRichard Bailey (keyboards)\n\nNeil Murray (bass)\n\nCozy Powell (drums)\n\nThey played in Rock in Rio Festival in January 1985, and same month, Cozy leaves the band, being substituted byAynsley Dunbar.\n\nGreatest hits is a compilation including some song only available as a single. The list of musicians from my Olympus appearing there is very long. Let's see: David Coverdale (vocals), Micky Moody (guitar), John Sykes (guitar), Steve Vai (guitar), Dann Huff (guitar),Neil Murray (bass), Rudy Sarzo (bass), Don Airey (keyboards), Alan Pasqua (keyboards), Cozy Powell (drums),Aynsley Dunbar (drums),Denny Carmassi (drums), Tommy Aldridge (drums).\n\nImages/scans available:\n\nSlide it in album cover (8 Kbs)\n\nWhitesnake lineup: from left to right: Cozy Powell, Mel Galley, David Coverdale, Micky Moody, Jon Lord, Colin Hodgkinson (62 Kbs)\n\nWhitesnake live photo: from left to right: Mel Galley, Cozy Powell, David Coverdale, Colin Hodgkinson, Micky Moody.

He tried to make the definitive heavy metal band, and contacted with several great musicians. His first choice for drums was Clive Burr (from Iron Maiden), but as he wasn't available, they contacted Cozy Powell, who had just left Whitesnake.\n\nPaul Di'Anno (vocals)\n\nPete Willis (guitar)\n\nJannick Gers (guitar)\n\nJohn Entwistle (bass)\n\nCozy Powell (drums)\n\nBut even before they worked together, Cozy got the offer to form the new Emerson Lake & Powell band, so he denied the offer to be included here (being replaced by former candidate, Clive Burr). They didn't record any material, but Gogmagog went to release an EP with different personnel (Powell and Entwistle out; and Clive Burr andNeil Murray in their places). More details in the page aboutNeil Murray.\n\nEMERSON, LAKE & POWELL (ELP)\n\nYes, they are! They still were ELP, but the 'P' letter was no more Carl Palmer, but Cozy Powell!!\n\nKeith Emerson (keyboards)\n\nGreg Lake (bass, vocals)\n\nCozy Powell (drums)\n\nThey released one album, and toured extensively, until their new separation in 1987.\n\nGreg Lake started selling an album directly from his official website. It's called From the underground: the official bootleg. It contains unreleased material (studio and live). It contains tracks with The Shame (1967), Shy Limbs (1968), King Crimson (1969), Greg Lake solo (1973), Greg Lake Band (1981, withTommy Eyre), Asia (1983), Emerson Lake & Powell (1986), Greg Lake solo (1986), Emerson Lake & Palmer (1992 & 1993), Greg Lake Band (1994). Regarding Cozy Powell, he appears in the two tracks by Emerson Lake & Powell ('The score' and 'Learning to fly'), both recorded live at Lakeland, Florida, in 1986.\n\nBLUE MURDER\n\nIn May 1987, guitarist John Sykes starts his solo career, under the name Blue Murder. He assembles a very powerful band, reuniting his old mate Cozy from his days in Whitesnake.\n\nRay Gillen (vocals)\n\nJohn Sykes (guitar)\n\nTony Franklin (bass)\n\nCozy Powell (drums)\n\nThey recorded the demos for what had to be their first album. But Sykes' management refuses to have Ray Gillen in the band, so he must leave.\n\nJohn Sykes (guitar)\n\nTony Franklin (bass)\n\nCozy Powell (drums)\n\nAlmost immediately, Cozy regrets for Gillen being sacked, and also leaves the band in October 1987. He was replaced by great drummer Carmine Appice, and from there, it started the most-known period of this band.\n\nTRIO WITH JACK BRUCE\n\nIn the June 1988 issue of the Spanish edition of Metal Hammer magazine, it was stated that Cozy Powell and Jack Bruce were searching for a top blues-rock guitarist in order to perform Cream-like music. What happened to the project? I don't know, as Cozy was quickly involved in his next project.\n\nGARY MOORE BAND\n\nHe played in the album After the war, only as a guest (along with Chris Thompson, Sam Brown, Miriam Stockley, Neil Carter,Laurence Cottle, Bob Daisley, Charlie Morgan, Don Airey, Simon Phillips as well as Ozzy Osbourne),\n\nI don't know exactly when Cozy joined the band. When Gary's next album, After the war, was recorded, there wasn't a stable lineup, but the credits show the next lineup, who was to promote it (also appearing in the videos, such as the 'After the war' song video):\n\nGary Moore (guitar, vocals)\n\nNeil Carter (keyboards, guitar, vocals)\n\nBob Daisley (bass)\n\nCozy Powell (drums)\n\nOther musicians in the album:Laurence Cottle (bass), Steve Piggott (bass), Don Airey (keyboards), Andy Richards (keyboards), Charlie Morgan (drums), Simon Phillips (drums), guest vocals by Ozzy Osbourne (on two tracks), and backing vocals by: Chris Thompson, Sam Brown, Miriam Stockley, Andrew Eldritch.\n\nBut Gary and Cozy personalities weren't easy to complement, and Cozy leaves the band after some problems between them, being substituted by another ex-Uriah Heep member, Chris Slade.\n\nImages/scans available:\n\nAfter the war album cover (14 Kbs)\n\nOut in the fields album cover (15 Kbs)\n\nLive photo: Gary Moore and Cozy Powell (15 Kbs)\n\nGary Moore Band lineup: from left to right: Bob Daisley, Neil Carter, Gary Moore, Cozy Powell (38 Kbs)\n\nBLACK SABBATH\n\nThe list of great bands where Cozy stayed is incremented again. Black Sabbath is the next. He joined them around October 1988.\n\nTony Martin (vocals)\n\nTony Iommi (guitar)\n\nGeoff Nicholls (keyboards)\n\nLaurence Cottle (bass)\n\nCozy Powell (drums)\n\nThey release Headless cross, produced by Cozy himself. But around May 1989, Cottle quits, andNeil Murray joins here.\n\nTony Martin (vocals)\n\nTony Iommi (guitar)\n\nGeoff Nicholls (keyboards)\n\nNeil Murray (bass)\n\nCozy Powell (drums)\n\nThey release next album, called Tyr. This lineup remains until October 1990, when Tony Martin and Neil Murray leave. They are substituted with old mates Ronnie James Dio and Geezer Butler. They join in the beginning of 1991.\n\nRonnie James Dio (vocals)\n\nTony Iommi (guitar)\n\nGeoff Nicholls (keyboards)\n\nGeezer Butler (bass)\n\nCozy Powell (drums)\n\nBut Cozy has a severe accident when riding a horse, and the band started searching for a new drummer. Around October or November 1991, Cozy is out of the band, being substituted by another great one, Vinny Appice (that is, the same Black Sabbath lineup from 1981). Back to the past.\n\nImages/scans available:\n\nTYR album cover (15 Kbs)\n\nCozy Powell and Tony Iommi (14 Kbs)\n\nBlack Sabbath lineup: From left to right: Tony Iommi, Cozy Powell, Tony Martin, Neil Murray (9 Kbs)\n\nBlack Sabbath lineup: From left to right: Cozy Powell, Neil Murray, Tony Iommi, Geoff Nicholls (22 Kbs)\n\nGUITAR LEGENDS\n\nA great event, and it happened in Spain! I can't believe it!!!\n\nAround 1991, there was a 5-day festival dedicated to the guitar. Every day was devoted to a certain class of music (blues, jazz, etc.). The 5th day (October 19, 1991, I think it was the date), it was called 'The night of the mad guitars', hosted by Brian May. Brian himself chose the participants, and I think this was the seed for the later Brian May band. The list of performers was just awesome: Steve Vai, Joe Satriani, Nuno Bettencourt, Joe Walsh, etc., as well as Paul Rodgers singing some song and leading the final jam with Hendrix's anthem, 'Hey Joe'. The backing band was equally superb. I'll put the complete list as soon as I find my videotape copy of that concert. For now, these are the names I remember now:\n\nBrian May (guitar, vocals)\n\nSteve Vai (guitar)\n\nJoe Satriani (guitar, vocals)\n\nNuno Bettencourt (guitar, vocals)\n\nGary Cherone (vocals)\n\nJoe Walsh (guitar, vocals)\n\nPaul Rodgers (vocals)\n\n+\n\nbacked by:\n\nNeil Murray (bass)\n\nNathan East (bass)\n\nRick Wakeman (keyboards)\n\nMike Moran (keyboards)\n\nChris Thompson (backing vocals)\n\nRay Cooper (percussion)\n\nMaggie Ryder (backing vocals)\n\nSteve Ferrone (drums)\n\nCozy Powell (drums)\n\nThere is even a bootleg (2CD) from that fantastic concert.\n\nThese are some photos from that concert. Sorry, as some of them are of bad quality. Unfortunately, Cozy isn't present in these photos. :(\n\nImages/scans available:\n\nGuitar Legends: From left to right: Joe Walsh, Rick Wakeman, Nuno Bettencourt, Joe Satriani, Steve Vai, Nathan East, Neil Murray (35 Kbs)\n\nGuitar Legends: From left to right: Rick Wakeman, Neil Murray, Paul Rodgers, another guy, Steve Vai (50 Kbs)\n\nGuitar Legends: From left to right: Joe Satriani, Neil Murray's arm, Steve Vai, Brian May (26 Kbs)\n\nBRIAN MAY BAND\n\nCozy comes to play in first complete Brian May solo album after the Queen forced separation, called Back to the light, and after that, he joins Brian May band. The album contains appearances by: Chris Thompson (vocals), Gary Tibbs (bass, from Roxy Music, once he was in Adam and The Ants!!), John Deacon (bass, from Queen),Neil Murray (bass), Maggie Ryder (backing vocals), Miriam Stockley (backing vocals), Don Airey (keyboards), Mike Moran (keyboards), and Cozy Powell (drums). There is a cover of a Small Faces song.\n\nSo here we have that Cozy Powell reunites (again!) at the end of 1991 withNeil Murray in this new adventure.\n\nBrian May (guitar, vocals)\n\nMike Casswell (guitar)\n\nSpike Edney (keyboards)\n\nNeil Murray (bass)\n\nCozy Powell (drums)\n\nChris Thompson (backing vocals)\n\nThey did some concerts in South America, before Chris Thompson and Mike Casswell leaving, being substituted by Jamie Moses and two female vocalists.\n\nBrian May (guitar, vocals)\n\nJamie Moses (guitar)\n\nSpike Edney (keyboards)\n\nNeil Murray (bass)\n\nCozy Powell (drums)\n\nCatherine Porter (backing vocals)\n\nShelly Preston (backing vocals)\n\nThey also released a live album, Live at the Brixton Academy.\n\nThere is a Japanese-only edition of a CD, called Resurrection. It includes the title song (co-written by Cozy), plus some live tracks ('Too much love will kill you', 'Back to the light'), and surprise, surprise, the whole content of the very first Brian May mini-album, under the name Star Fleet Project (with people like Eddie Van Halen), never released on CD by itself.\n\nBrian May Band was together until 1994, until some of the members performed side projects from time to time (for example, Cozy Powell's Hammer for a brief period, as we're going to see...).\n\nImages/scans available:\n\nBack to the light album cover (13 Kbs)\n\nLive at The Brixton Academy album cover (13 Kbs)\n\nBrian May Band lineup (5 Kbs)\n\nCOZY POWELL'S HAMMER\n\nIn 1992, Cozy Powell, during a brief hiatus from his then current band Black Sabbath, put together a revamped version of his old band Hammer, with this lineup:\n\nPeter Oliver (vocals)\n\nMario Parga (guitar)\n\nNeil Murray (bass)\n\nCozy Powell (drums)\n\nBut after their first concert, Peter Oliver is fired, and they ask Tony Martin to join them.\n\nTony Martin (vocals)\n\nMario Parga (guitar)\n\nNeil Murray (bass)\n\nCozy Powell (drums)\n\nAt that moment, Martin, Murray and Cozy were part of Black Sabbath. They played in November 1992 several dates in a German tour (it exists a bootleg from those concerts, although credited to \"Tony Martin and Friends\"!), and the set list consisted of songs from Rainbow, Black Sabbath, Whitesnake, all bands where Cozy has played.\n\nImages/scans available:\n\nCozy Powell's Hammer live photo: From left to right: Mario Parga, Cozy Powell, Tony Martin, Neil Murray (24 Kbs)\n\nBLACK SABBATH (again!)\n\nDidn't I tell you about Black Sabbath resurrecting old lineups? OK, once again. Around October 1994, we can find the same guys together again. After new problems between Dio/Appice and Iommi/Butler, Ronnie Dio puts his own Dio band on the road again, and Tony 'The Cat' Martin comes back, along with the same musicians from 1990.\n\nTony Martin (vocals)\n\nTony Iommi (guitar)\n\nGeoff Nicholls (keyboards)\n\nNeil Murray (bass)\n\nCozy Powell (drums)\n\nThey release a new album, Forbidden, and after some kind of health problems, Cozy has to leave the band again, at the end of the Forbidden US tour.\n\nImages/scans available:\n\nForbidden album cover (17 Kbs)\n\nBlack Sabbath lineup: From left to right: Cozy Powell, Neil Murray, Tony Martin, Geoff Nicholls (36 Kbs)\n\nSAINTS AND SINNERS\n\nThis was a project of a band with a superb lineup.\n\nJohn West (vocals)\n\nMicky Moody (guitar)\n\nBernie Marsden (guitar)\n\nNeil Murray (bass)\n\nCozy Powell (drums)\n\nAll of them were former Whitesnake members, except the superb vocalist John West. They were going to tour and play lots of the old Whitesnake songs and some new ones. But, sadly, the idea never materialized. This was around 1996.\n\nPETER GREEN SPLINTER GROUP\n\nSometime later, the Murray-Powell team joins the greatPeter Green in his comeback to music, after almost 25 years of being wondering in and out of music. Peter, thanks for your comeback!\n\nPeter Green (guitar, vocals, harmonica)\n\nNigel Watson (guitar, vocals)\n\nSpike Edney (keyboards)\n\nNeil Murray (bass)\n\nCozy Powell (drums)\n\nThey played here in Spain in 1997, but I couldn't assist!! :( I'll regret from that all of my life!\n\nTheir album, Peter Green Splinter Group was recorded live, except 2 acoustic tracks. It's all-blues. With good renditions of some classics, from bluesmen like Otis Rush, Robert Johnson, Elmore James. And with a rockin' rendition of 'Going down', a song covered by many people, like Jeff Beck (by the way, with Cozy on drums), Freddie King, and even G3 on tour (that is, the guitar aces Steve Vai, Joe Satriani and Eric Johnson in his joint live album). From the past, there's no Fleetwood Mac songs (well, only an Otis Rush song 'Homework' that Fleetwood Mac played in an album with Chicago bluesmen), and we can find a song Peter Green used to play in his John Mayall days (also, watchAynsley Dunbar biography page for details), 'The Stumble'.\n\nFinally, Cozy Powell and Spike Edney left the band to move on to other projects.\n\nImages/scans available:\n\nPeter Green Splinter Group album cover (9 Kbs)\n\nSplinter Group photo: From left to right: Peter Green, Cozy Powell, Nigel Watson, Neil Murray, Spike Edney (84 Kbs)\n\nSplinter Group lineup (23 Kbs)\n\nCozy Powell in Spain, July 1997, playing with Splinter Group (15 Kbs)\n\nFENDER HOUSEBAND\n\nThis was a very special concert, as a part of Fender's 50th birthday celebrations. It was on 30th November 1996. The concert was dedicated to the much-missed Rory Gallagher.Peter Green played there with his Splinter Group, but I mention that here, because most of his band was 'used' as houseband for the artists to play.\n\nJamie Moses (guitar)\n\nNeil Murray (bass)\n\nSpike Edney (keyboards)\n\nCozy Powell (drums)\n\nThey accompanied the participants: Yngwie Malmsteen, and Jack Bruce, as well as Peter Green Splinter Group (of course!).\n\nTHE S.A.S. BAND\n\nThe name stands for Spike's All Stars. They started in the summer of 1994 at the Gosport festival actually only planned as a \"one-of\" but it went so well they have played numerous concerts by now. I don't know the line-up from then, the only persons I know who performed definately the first time were Spike Edney and Chris Thompson. I think I've heard that most of the first gigs they played in the line-up of Spike, Neil Murray, Cozy Powell and Jamie Moses with Chris Thompson on vocals and some other singers as well. Later the musician line-up changed to Spike and Jamie together with John Marter and Steve Stroud. Most of the time they have Chris Thompson on vocals. Other vocalist who feature rather frequently are Roger Chapman, Tony Hadley and Mark Shaw. Other vocalists and musicians who have featured (one or more times): Madeline Bell, Catherine Porter, Kiki Dee, Jess Roden, Stevie Vann, Graham Gouldman, Haddaway, Fish, Paul Young, Steve Lukather, Chaka Khan, Mica Paris, Tom Robinson, Paul Rodgers, Judy Tzuke, Mike Rutherford, Phil Manzanera, Dean Friedman, the three remaining Queen members and some more. They play mainly covers of rock and soul songs, always depending on the singers they have for the night. The line-up is never stable and Cozy sometimes has joined the SAS-Band in some concert.\n\nThey released an album, SAS Band, with help from: Chris Thompson (vocals), Roger Chapman (vocals), Madeline Bell (vocals), Tony Hadley (vocals), Kiki Dee (vocals), Jess Roden (vocals), Roger Taylor (vocals & drums), Alan Darby (guitar), Jamie Moses (guitar),Peter Green (guitar on 1 track), Pete Stroud (bass),Neil Murray (bass on 1 track), John Deacon (bass), Richard Cottle (keyboards), John Lingwood (keyboards), Ian Anderson (flute), Charlie Morgan (drums), Cozy Powell (drums on 2 tracks), and John Marter (drums), plus some others.\n\nImages/scans available:\n\nSAS Band album cover (15 Kbs)\n\nYNGWIE MALMSTEEN\n\nCozy had just left Peter Green's band. He was to join Yngwie Malmsteen, but we'll never enjoy this union. When they were preparing the forthcoming tour, Cozy injured his feet in an accident, so Yngwie had to search for another drummer. His brand new live 2CD album is dedicated to Cozy, as well as the whole tour.\n\nBRIAN MAY BAND (again)\n\nAfter several years, Brian May records a new album with his former band, with the idea of promoting it live with the same musicians. Unfortunately, Cozy's sad death broke that dream. The album, Another world, was released on June 1st.\n\nIt was six years since Brian didn't record a studio album. He plays almost every intrument in the album (vocals, guitar, bass, keyboards), with help from Jaime Moses (guitar, 1 track),Neil Murray (bass, 3 tracks), Ken Taylor (bass, 1 track), Spike Edney (keyboards, 1 track), Cozy Powell (drums, 4 tracks), Steve Ferrone (drums, 1 track), Taylor Hawkins (drums), Cathy Porter & Shelley Preston (backing vocals). With some surprise guests: Ian Hunter in 1 song (a cover of a Mott the Hoople song), and the greatJeff Beck playing in 1 song dedicated to him, \"The Guv'nor\", together along with Cozy Powell again after so many years.\n\nBrian has written this lovely thing about Cozy:\n\n\"This album is dedicated to my Mum and to our dear friend Cozy. Life will never be the same without you\"\n\nImages/scans available:\n\nAnother world album cover (12 Kbs)\n\nSOLO ALBUMS\n\nCozy has been recording albums along his lenghty career. We can find many former/current Cozy bandmates in his albums. In the early 70s, he released three singles as a solo artist, for Mickie Most's Rak label.\n\n'Dance with the devil / And then there was skin' (1973, Rak)\n\n'The man in black / After dark' (1974, Rak)\n\n'Na na na / Mistral' (1974, Rak)\n\nThere's an album called The Rainbow family album (1994, Conoisseur), containing tracks from people who once belonged to Rainbow. It includes tracks from Rainbow (live tracks), Deep Purple, Elf, Roger Glover, Fandango, Wild Horses, Tony Carey, Alcatrazz, Colosseum II and Dio, plus one track from Cozy Powell, 'Dance with the devil'.\n\nOver the top is a killer album. The complete personnel list is:\n\nCozy Powell\n\n+\n\nGary Moore (guitar)\n\nClem Clempson (guitar)\n\nBernie Marsden (guitar)\n\nJack Bruce (bass)\n\nDon Airey (keyboards)\n\nMax Middleton (keyboards)\n\nAll the tracks are fantastic, as well as musicianship. You can hear Jack Bruce at his best,Clem Clempson is making his guitar howl, and Gary Moore's speed is incredible. Don Airey arranges all the songs, as well as writing the great 'Killer', and co-writing 'Heidi goes to town' and 'Over the top'. I love when he plays the 'White room' riff inside 'Theme One'. Jack Bruce sure was smiling... The tranks section mentions Roger Glover andNeil Murray. The album was produced by Martin Birch. All the songs are instrumental, but they funnily write: 'lyrics enclosed'.\n\nTilt was recorded during Spring 1981, with lots of former bandmates. The complete personnel list is:\n\nCozy Powell\n\n+\n\nElmer Gantry (vocals, from Stretch)\n\nFrank Aiello (vocals)\n\nJeff Beck (guitar)\n\nGary Moore (guitar)\n\nBernie Marsden (guitar)\n\nKirby (guitars, from Stretch)\n\nJack Bruce (bass)\n\nDavid Sancious (keyboards, from Jack Bruce Band)\n\nDon Airey (keyboards)\n\nJohn Cook (keyboards, from Stretch)\n\nChris Glen (bass)\n\nNeil Murray (bass)\n\nMel Collins (sax)\n\nI love this album. It contains the song who started my love for Gary Moore, 'Sunset'. A very beautiful and slow instrumental, it's magical! I also enjoy a lot the song 'The blister', with a terrific rhythm by Cozy, Don Airey and Gary Moore.\n\nNext album was Octopuss. The complete personnel list is:\n\nCozy Powell\n\n+\n\nGary Moore (guitar)\n\nMel Galley (guitar)\n\nColin Hodgkinson (bass)\n\nDon Airey (keyboards)\n\nJon Lord (keyboards)\n\nPlus John Du Prez and the Philharmonia. It was recorded in London during September and October 1982. Co-produced by Cozy and Nick Griffiths.\n\nThe drums are back is his 4th solo album, with top guest musicians (as always!): Brian May (guitar), Steve Lukather (guitar), Jamie Page (guitar), Ray Fenwick (guitar), Steve Makin (guitar), Billy Sheehan (bass), John Deacon (bass),Laurence Cottle (bass),Neil Murray (bass), John Sinclair, Jon Lord (keyboards), Don Airey (keyboards), Geoff Nicholls (keyboards), etc. Produced by Cozy himself.\n\nAlong 1998, it was announced that a new album by Cozy was to be released. Supposedly called Twin Oaks, it would contain 11 tracks recorded shortly before the accident. But, instead, the album has been released under the title Especially for you. It contains 12 tracks recorded probably around 1995. Mostly written by Cozy and Mike Casswell (who was in the first Brian May Band lineup, watch above).\n\nThe personnel list is:\n\nJohn West (vocals)\n\nMike Casswell (guitar)\n\nNeil Murray (bass)\n\nLonnie Parks (keyboards)\n\nCozy Powell (drums)\n\nSome guests include: Sylvain (guitar), Mike Burns (keyboards), Viracocha (keyboards) and Ken Boley (keyboards). The 'special thanks' mentions one of his former bandmates and friend, Frank Aiello.\n\nOf course, The best of is a compilation. It contains tracks from the first 3 Cozy albums, Over the top (5 tracks), Tilt (4 tracks) and Octopuss (7 tracks). No unreleased material at all.\n\nImages/scans available:\n\nOver the top album cover (13 Kbs)\n\nTilt album cover (10 Kbs)\n\nOctopuss album cover (17 Kbs)\n\nThe drums are back album cover (26 Kbs)\n\nThe best of Cozy Powell album cover (14 Kbs)\n\nEspecially for you album cover (18 Kbs)\n\nFORCEFIELD\n\nThis was a studio-only project, where Cozy was involved. They released 4 albums, with different musicians, as well as a compilation with unreleased tracks. Great musicians in them: Tony Martin (vocals, from Black Sabbath), Ray Fenwick (guitar), Jan Akkerman (guitar, from Focus), Mo Foster (bass),Laurence Cottle (bass), Nick Magnus (keyboards, from Steve Hackett's band), etc.\n\nHere, Forcefield was formed by:\n\nPete Prescott (vocals)\n\nRay Fenwick (guitar, keyboards)\n\nCozy Powell (drums)\n\nWith a stable team of musicians:\n\nMo Foster (bass)\n\nNick Magnus (keyboards)\n\nBarry St. John (backing vocals)\n\nPlus help from Chris Cozens (keyboards) andNeil Murray (bass in 1 song, the cover of Deep Purple's \"Smoke on the water\").

With Jan Akkerman, Ray Fenwick, Bernie Marsden, Mario Parga, Don Airey and Cozy Powell.\n\nImages/scans available:\n\nForcefield album cover (24 Kbs)\n\nForcefield II - The talisman album cover (19 Kbs)\n\nForcefield 3 - To Oz and back album cover (30 Kbs)\n\nForcefield IV - Let the wild run free album cover (19 Kbs)\n\nInstrumentals album cover (30 Kbs)\n\nForcefield first lineup: Ray Fenwick, Cozy Powell and Pete Prescott (46 Kbs)\n\nForcefield third lineup: Jan Akkerman, Cozy Powell, Ray Fenwick and Graham Bonnet (44 Kbs)\n\nTRIBUTE ALBUMS\n\nTwo tribute albums have been released in Japan:\n\nRest in peace - Thanks to Cozy (1998)\n\nCozy Powell forever (1998)\n\nRest in peace - Thanks to Cozy include Japanese musicians from hard rock camp play Cozy's songs (from MSG, Rainbow, Whitesnake, etc).\n\nCozy Powell forever includes Rei Atsumi (keyboardist in Vow Wow) on most tracks, as well as Carmine Appice and Tony Franklin on a couple of songs.

The evening was called \"A night to remember...Cozy Powell\".\n\nThis was a moving occasion with tributes paid by all the performers, and enhanced by some excellent music.\n\nDenny Ball played with his own band, comprised of Pete French (vocals, Cactus, Atomic Rooster), John Idan (guitar, Yardbirds), Russell Gilbrook (drums, DeadLine) andDenny Ball (bass).\n\nThere were many notable performers includingNeil Murray (playing with Tony Martin, Geoff Nicholls, Mike Casswell, and Bobby Rondinelli), Spike Edney (playing with a version of his own SAS Band: Chris Thompson, Clayton Moss, John Marter,Neil Murray, Susie Webb and Zoe Nicholas), Chris Farlowe, Tony Ashton, Darren Wharton, and many more.
