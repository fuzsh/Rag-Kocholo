        "text": "Thing 1 – Accents\n\nMany people, myself included, do an accent or two. We do so in the full knowledge that they’re at best inaccurate and at worst downright offensive.\n\nDave Huxtable is not, even though when you listen to him talk you might in fact believe that he is many people, ‘many people’. This whistlestop tour of English accents is, to the layperson, uncannily accurate, and it’s reassuring to read so many approving comments from people from the areas in question. It is an endlessly fascinating area, and his videos are always enlightening.\n\nThing 2 – Drums\n\nSometimes what you need in your day is a dose of gratuitous silliness.\n\nFor this you will need Cozy Powell’s 1991 feat of hitting 400 drums in under one minute (fun fact: Cozy Powell’s real name was Colin Flooks).\n\nThis is already silly enough, but what it needs, as the excellent Rhodri Marsden realised, is a piano accompaniment.\n\nThing 3 – Trees\n\nEver wondered what all the trees in London are, and where they are?\n\nWonder no more. There is a London street tree map.\n\n(There are gaps on the map. This isn’t because there are large treeless areas in London, but merely that not all the data is/are* available.)\n\n*You might have a view on whether it should be ‘data is’ or ‘data are’. I honestly don’t care, so include both in a probably doomed effort to avoid controversy and discussion.\n\nThing 4 – Swallows\n\nThis is a quite beautiful piece about swallows. I shan’t give the game away any more than that, but do urge you to read it.\n\nThing 5 – Spider-man\n\nI got to thinking, for reasons, about Spider-man, and in particular his catchy theme tune. In case you don’t know it, here it is.\n\nIt occurred to me that, in the interest of scientific accuracy, the lyrics could do with a light rejig. I apologise in advance.\n\nSpider-man spider-man\n\nDoes whatever a spider can\n\nSpins a web, catches flies\n\nHas eight legs, and eight eyes\n\nExcept for some species\n\nWhich just have six\n\nOh and there’s one species\n\nThat is 90% herbivorous\n\nSo probably best not to generalise\n\nLook out, here comes the spider-man.\n\nIs he strong? Yes he is\n\nBut not as strong as\n\nThe female\n\nWho is usually larger.\n\nAlso, many species practice\n\nSexual cannibalism\n\nWhereby she eats him\n\nAfter procreation\n\nWhich is a bit grim\n\nFor him…\n\nLook out, here comes the spider-man\n\nQuite nervously.\n\nThing 6 – Toasters\n\nWhich is the best museum? Louvre? Uffizi? Met?\n\nNo, it is quite obviously the Toaster Museum. I mean, come on.\n\nHere you will find such classics as the Mattatuck Commander, the Edicraft Automatic and the Daalderop KMD. I honestly don’t know what more you could possibly want.\n\nShare"
