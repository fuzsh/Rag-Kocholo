        "text": "You might call Cozy Powell a utilitarian drummer; he made others sound better, but never quite became famous in his own right. It was on this date, April 5, 1998, that he passed at the age of 50.\n\nHe was born Colin Trevor Powell in Cirencester, England, on Dec. 29, 1947, and began playing drums at 12. He borrowed his nickname from the jazz drummer Cozy Cole, and by his teens he was already impressing locals with his skills behind the kit.\n\nHis first band of any consequence was called the Sorcerers, which morphed into a few other bands, but it wasn’t until 1970 that he caught his big break, joining the Jeff Beck Group and appearing on the albums Rough and Ready (1971) and Jeff Beck Group (1972).\n\nA series of stints with other bands followed, and studio work for famed producer Mickie Most, adding his drum power to records by everyone from Donovan to Suzi Quatro. In 1974, he formed Cozy Powell’s Hammer but his next major gig came the following year with Rainbow, the hard rock band featuring Deep Purple’s Ritchie Blackmore. Powell stayed with that outfit for five years and then spent the next five years drifting from one band to the next—the Michael Schenker Group and Whitesnake among them—until he was called upon to be the new “P” in ELP—the legendary trio reborn as Emerson, Lake and Powell.\n\nAgain, Powell found his way in and out of various bands following that short-lived engagement, and then joined Black Sabbath in 1988, working with the band until 1991, taking a few years off and then returning in 1994-95. Later gigs included work with Brian May, Peter Green, Yngwie Malmsteen and others, along with more solo work, but his prolific career was cut short on April 5, 1998. While on his way to visit a female friend, Powell—who had been drinking and was not wearing a seat belt—was involved in an accident that sent him through his car’s windshield. He died at the scene.\n\nWatch Cozy Powell with the Jeff Beck Group in 1972"
