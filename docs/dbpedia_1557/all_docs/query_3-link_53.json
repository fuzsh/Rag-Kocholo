        "text": "Always a good start-back office chore is a careful sweep through the in-tray, which had crept up to 450+ emails over the winter break. And it does help bring things into focus.\n\nOf course the music scene has rightly been mourning the death of Lemmy, one of rock’s great characters apparently according to the TV. I suppose that’s because most of the mainstream press didn’t really understand his music or playing ability. I still get shivers down my spine recalling that first eponymous Motorhead 12″ single on Chiswick Records which I bought close to release date back in 1977.\n\nSomehow I never did get the see them live in those early days (and they did tour with Purple as recently as 2007), but had been a big Hawkwind fan and met Lemmy at one of those weird all night rock events at the Queens Hall in Leeds. I’ve no idea how but we ended up being allowed into the hospitality room for the concert performers and Lemmy conned a nice button badge off my brother’s jacket. All he can recall was being sat by the side of the stage watching the show when a naked American woman came over and sat beside him. “Oh well, I’d best get on and wobble these around a little,” she explained after a while before we realised it was Stacia.\n\nFunnily enough I was doing some vinyl sorting last week and checked my mint copy of their second album, signed by all the band… except Lemmy himself. Mind you he was busy telling us how much grass he’d smoked during the day so perhaps it didn’t seem quite the moment to get all fanboyish!\n\nLemmy was always respectful of what he called Deep Purple’s place as the originators of hard rock (and one of the first to use pyrotechnics, at the California Jam).\n\nCloser to home, we also lost our mate Martin Lilleker who has been suffering from Alzheimer’s for several years. Martin was one of those irreplacable and unique cogs in the local community music scene; he wrote music columns for the local press for decades, ran a label for a time, helped manage and played live a bit too. In recent years he also documented the scene magnificently across two thick paperbacks on the history of Sheffield bands going back to the early 60s. I helped him with a few bits for these and when I bemoaned the poor design of the first book’s cover he let me have a free hand on book two and was brave enough to go ahead with an admittedly quite eye popping montage! It’s guys like Martin which make living in Sheffield just that little bit more enjoyable and we’ll miss him.\n\nLooking forward it’s amazing how much enjoyment people get looking back, if the flurry of excitement about a new audience tape of Deep Purple from back in Feb 1972 at the Dagenham Roundhouse is to go by. The owner had got in touch with us in the lead-up to Christmas but seemed unable to wait to see if this could be done officially and pushed it out into the pirate networks instead. Amazing that new recordings can still emerge after forty plus years. It seems churlish to point out (as one expert did) that the cover photo is from the night before…!\n\nTalking of history, a few people have pointed me to a copy of Wait For The Ricochet currently selling on ebay. Or rather not selling, as the owner wants £1,001.86 for it. Since I went to have a peep (just to see if it was for real) ebay now keep asking me if I’d like “to take another look?”! I wouldn’t mind but the cheeky sod wants £2.75 postage as well… I added it as a watched item just to get his hopes up.\n\nHopefully this year we’ll get it back into print, but the priority right now is in finishing the follow-up, Fire In The Sky. And tracking down the current owner of the E-Type Jag Jon drove down to Montreux in. It’s all in the detail!\n\nWith the fun and games over the Rock & Roll Hall Of Fame still ongoing, it’s good to see friends and fans of the late Cozy Powell have been able to organise things with far less aggro, and are putting up a blue plaque in the town of his birth, Cirencester. It’s very short notice, but if you’re free on January 7th then there is a public unveiling at the Corn Hall at 2.30pm with Brian May doing the honours. People like Bernie Marsden, Don Airey and Neil Murray will be there. It looks as if the long-mooted documentary on Cozy is also now in the works. The man himself would have been 70 next year.\n\nAs for ‘works’ we’re fairly confident the major labels are now about sorted when it comes to the Deep Purple classic era catalogue. The bizarre Universal LP box set (below) looks a real dog’s dinner, but I’m told better things are on the way with the return to catalogue of most of the regular albums (incredibly many have been off the shelves for some years now). There are also plans afoot with regards to other areas of the catalogue about which more as the year unfolds. I have had meetings with some of the people involved and it looks quite promising.\n\nSome of you have also got the Rainbow gigs to look forward to. I guess we can’t really call it a reunion when only one member is coming back, but for everyone who missed out it looks as if more shows will follow in 2017. A souped up version of the first album is also due, though as the mutli-tracks are still lost there isn’t too much scope for content.\n\nThe first pics of the new Rainbow came through recently, reminding me of that excitement back in 75 when shots of the first group emerged and were being posted about by people to reproduce in fanzines etc. I shall not be hurrying to repeat the experience this time round!\n\nAs for Purple themselves it’s still good to listen to play bits and pieces off Now What so hopefully the band can again produce something of interest when they start recording in the next few weeks (will the first one into the studio hide Don’s ELP collection?).\n\nI’ve got my plate full with design work to wrap up on three books this month, so I’d best fire up InDesign and get cracking. But before I do, here’s a few anniversaries coming up in 2016 to make everyone feel that little bit older!\n\n10th anniversary of Rapture Of The Deep\n\n20th anniversary of Purpendicular\n\n25th anniversary of the Slaves & Masters world tour\n\n30th anniversary of the Seventh Star album with Glenn Hughes\n\n35th anniversary of Whitesnake’s Don’t Break My Heart Again hit single.\n\n40th anniversary of Deep Purple Mk 4’s final concerts.\n\n45th anniversary of Fireball.\n\n50th anniversary of Art Gallery by The Artwoods.\n\nSimon Robinson. My thanks to factoid checkers and news editors Mike Richards, Martin Ashberry, Tim Summers, Vince Chong, Mark Maddock, Matthew Kean and Ian Gillan’s surprise dinner guest – Britney Spears.\n\nSome bits you may have seen on the site and elsewhere, others you may have missed…\n\nThere’s a new Tommy Bolin set due late August in America, titled Whirlwind. No final details of European editions yet but these will be available through DTBOnline. There is a limited edition but seems to be for US only. Other new titles due in are vinyl of Jon Lord’s Concerto. Vinyl of the latest Blackmore’s Night album has been issued but is not being distributed by normal channels so we cannot supply it.\n\nThe Phenomena Project is assembling (sounds like something from an upcoming Marvel Comics film!) for at least one festival slot next year at Sweden Rock Festival 2014, with Glenn Hughes – Vocals, Neil Murray – Bass, and Bernie Marsden – Guitar, plus Martin Kronlund – Guitar, Perra Johansson – Drums, Ian Haugland – Drums. Dating back to 1985, this was a series of studio albums with contributions from Glenn and others, but never toured.\n\nStill with Glenn, the Hughes / Thrall album is reissued on vinyl shortly, 180 gsm edition (pre-order at DTBOnline).\n\nI wonder if the Jon Lord BBC show we mentioned on DTB before is this: “Keyboard wizard Rick Wakeman pays tribute to his friend, Deep Purple’s Jon Lord…” Airing at 23:25, Sunday, July 14th, BBC1 TV but in the East Midlands only (due to the Leicester connection I assume). Hopefully it will be on iPlayer after, most local programming is.\n\nTalking of the man, it’s now confirmed that the memorial show takes place in April 2014, with lots of guests. We’ll let you know more when we can on the Jon Lord page on the site. I know some people were hoping to travel to catch this and a DP UK show in October this year as they were originally hoping to stage it in October. There is also a special book celebrating Jon’s life in words and pictures in the planning stages, about which more shortly.\n\nAll a bit quieter over in Deep Purple land, apart from Don Airey doing a freebie show in Italy in August, with a Deep Purple tribute band. Date and flyer on the site here.\n\nOn the back-catalogue, we should note that the 1999 Deep Purple Live At The Royal Albert Hall set is deleted; anyone needing the 2CD set should move quickly. A customer came to us asking if we could help and were surprised to find it had gone. We still have some in stock at DTBOnline store (or you can pay over £30 on Am*z*n!). A marvellous weekend for everyone really, and you have to think with hindsight it was one of the high spots of the reunion. It’s great that Jon got to do this when he did.\n\nThe DPO Archives are promising us an anniversary video single to mark the release forty years back of the Smoke On The Water single in America. It took EMI UK four years to finally release this here, not until the band had split did they put it out on 7″ in 1977.\n\nFunnily enough, the radio comedy show The Castle (recently repeated on Radio 4Extra) have the riff done on medieval instruments which sounds great (along with many other famous rock hooks). Also due is a reissue of the Live In Copenhagen ’72 DVD.\n\nThe Wait For The Riochet book majoring on the Deep Purple In Rock period of the band is now in the final proofing stages and on track to go to print later this month. There will be a cut-off date for pre-orders announced shortly so if you want the copy with your credit in best get a wriggle on. If the title has passed you by, check it out on the site here.\n\nThe latest live Whitesnake album Made In Britain is now shipping, a double CD set (see DTBOnline). Apparently Whitesnake showed head and shoulder shots of Jon Lord, Mel Galley and Cozy Powell during the performance of Gambler on the recent UK tour. Until I heard this I hadn’t really thought how many of the classic line-up we’d lost.\n\nMention of Mel sort of leads us obliquely to Judas Priest (How? Mel, Trapeze, Glenn, Deep Purple, Roger Glover, produced Priest…. peasy). John Tucker was asking me aboiut The Flying Hat Band, who supported Purple for a few shows in Europe in January 1974. This was Priest guitarist Glenn Tipton’s outfit and we were wondering how on earth they came to be selected for the tour (given that most of Purple’s supports at that time were usually bands people had heard of – Alex Harvey Band, Tucky Buzzard, Elf, etc.). Let us know if you managed the band at the time!\n\nIssue 6 of Swedish magazine Retroculture majors on Deep Purple. Though mostly in Swedish, interviews with Coverdale and Johnny Bolin have been included in English by editor Mike Eriksson. The only worry I have is the magazine’s website name which in English reads a bit strange, so I’ll just paste it as a link! Thanks also to the guys at Hush magazine for their latest issue, 41. 75 pages of DP and family content, along with other bands.\n\nThat comedy film Discoverdale we’ve been mentioning for some time is now getting screenings in various art cinemas around the country. Very nice of the producers to send us an invite to the London premier (though the thought of driving all that way in the recent heatwave to sit in a cinema didn’t really appeal). The flyer actually featured quite a big photo of David Coverdale. You can visit the movie’s official site to read more. Can’t wait to see it.\n\nFinally, Chris Poustie writes : “I was in a musical instrument shop in Bangkok a couple of days ago and as I was waiting to pay my bill a song came out of the shop’s speakers which I immediately recognized as “We Wish You Well” although it was being sung in an Asian language, most probably Japanese or Korean. It was a much bigger production than the original Whitesnake version and much longer too, probably a full 3 or 4 minutes. First verse sung by a man, and the second verse sung by a woman in operatic style!” If anyone can tell Chris who this was by let us know. The track was also covered back in the day (1979) by an outfit called Company, a 7″ single which featured four members of Whitesnake on a busman’s holiday…\n\nThanks also to Jacqueline Stokes, James Bateman, Tim Summers."
