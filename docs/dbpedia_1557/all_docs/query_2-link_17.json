        "text": "Having picked up the nickname “Cozy” from friends in school after the American jazz great Cozy Cole, English drummer Colin Trevor Powell was to carve out an impressive career playing with some of the most respected and musically demanding groups and artists\n\nof his time.\n\nIn a career that spanned more than 30 years and ended prematurely with a tragic 1998 auto accident that took his life, Cozy Powell was to appear with more than 20 groups and on more than 60 albums. His vast resume included work with Jeff Beck, Rainbow, Emerson Lake and Powell, Robert Plant, Black Sabbath, Whitesnake, Gary Moore, Brian May, Donovan, Suzie Quatro, Roger Daltry, Jack Bruce and many more – not to mention his own groups Cozy Powell and Cozy Powell’s Hammer. In fact, he even achieved the rare feat of producing a drum solo hit with his own Dancing With the Devil single, which peaked at number 3 in the UK singles\n\ncharts and number 49 in the USA in 1974.\n\nToday Cozy Powell is remembered as a master player, a larger than life personality, and an influence for generations of drummers."
