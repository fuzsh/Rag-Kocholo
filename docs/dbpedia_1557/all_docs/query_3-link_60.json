        "meta_description": "Mike Terrana - Interview :    R'n'R : Do you remember your first steps with drums ?  MT : Yes. I was 8 years old. Listening to the Rolling Stones \"Hey You Get off of my Cloud\". I loved that song. I was in the car with my mom and i just started playing there at on the dashboard of the car, and i thought  “hey I think I can play drums ! haha\". Nice feeling and from there I got more crazy for it. My Uncle Phil gave me my first real drum kit, a Slingerland Radio King like Krupa used to play. I wish I still had those drums.  R'n'R : What music did you listen to when you were a child ?  MT : All kinds of music rock, pop, big band but mostly rock. When i was 16 I got into Rush, Kiss and all the other great rock n roll bands of the day !!!   R'n'R : Cozy Powell is one of your influences. What do you like in his game ? Did you meet him ?  MT : Yes, I love Cozy's sounds and his playing style. Amazing drummer. Great feel, groove and fills. I first heard him with Rainbow. Amazing show and I’m sorry to say no, I never had the pleasure to meet Cozy Powell in person.  R'n'R : What are your other influences ?  MT : Really too many to mention in the rock world, Tommy Aldrige John Bonham, Ginger Baker, Cozy Powell, Neil Peart, Terry Bozzio… Jazz and Fusion , Simon Philips, Tony William's Buddy Rich, Louie Nelson, Dennis Chambers, Dave Weckel, Sonny Payne , Irv Cotler  (both played drums for Frank Sinatra)   R'n'R : You have an impressive discography. What brings you to play with so different artists and bands ?  MT : Thanks. Well I'm not sure in the early days nobody knew who I was, so I didn't get many calls to record or tour , but as time went on my reputation started to grow and more people started calling me for work. That was 35 years ago. Now I have too much work , but more touring than recording.  It seems the Hayday of making CDs has come to an end.  R'n'R : Is music a therapy ?  MT : Yes. For me it is. Drumming and music is my drug and my passion,  I think if i could not play drums or could not have music in my life, I would be a very sad man.  R'n'R : You live in Italy. What are the principal differences you find between American and European ways of life ?  MT : Yes. I have lived in Europe for over 18 years. Holland, Germany, Denmark and now Italy. I like to move around and I enjoy the differences in culture. I also enjoy the European mentality about many things as opposed to how the americans live and work.  I consider myself a European man and I’m happy here.  R'n'R : Why do you live in Italy?  MT : My father was born in Sicily so i was curious. So i wanted to get back to roots and for the past 4 years I live now in Italy. I love it. The sun, the food, the wine, people… It’s a nice place to relax when i come off the road.  R'n'R : You have Sicilian blood in your veins. What do these origins bring to you ?  MT : Sicily is close to Africa. And Africa is the LAND OF THE DRUMS ! I’m white but I'm sure I have some black blood in me somewhere. That’s cool, because I think that’s where the Fire comes from, especially when i sit behind the drums. I love all kinds of ethnic drumming and I like and collect many ethics forms of percussion. The Drums are what started it all, they are the oldest instrument next to the human voice. I love the drums for its primal form of expression. I think my Sicilian blood has a lot to do with how and why I play.  R'n'R : What are your hobbies when you’re not touring or recording (if you have free time) ?  MT : I live on the Sea, so I like to go to the beach, swim, ride my bike. I also love to work out in the gym, run and when i want to really relax, there is nothing better than laying on the beach reading a good book and sleeping ;)   R'n'R : You like wine and good eating. But do you know that Francehas the best wine and food in the world ? Better than in Italy.  MT : Well that’s a matter of personal taste,  I love France and you’re right, the food and wine are excellent.  However i was raised on Italian cooking so I feel more at home here in Italy. Living in Tuscany allows me to get to taste some great wine, cheese and pasta…hehe  R'n'R : You played with a lot of virtuoso guitarists (Malmsteen, Lukather, Axel Rudi Pell, Roland Grapow, Tony Mac Alpine, Kiko Loureiro). In your opinion which one is the most impressive ?  MT : Steve Lukather is great all around player, great singer and a really super cool human being !  He has it all and I loved working with him and he is a very funny guy. I think making music should be fun and with Steve it is.   R'n'R : You are one of the best drummers, but do you think you can learn new technics on drums ?  MT : I don't think I’m the best or even one of the best. And yes, I still have a lot to learn. It never ends.   R'n'R : A lot of people knows you thanks to your work with Axel Rudi Pell. Does it disturb you or is it ok for you ?  MT : I don't mind, but I don't really play anything nice on those CDs. I find the drumming boring and not very musical, but if people like the music and the drumming that goes with it, fine ;)        R'n'R : You have now your own band named Terrana. You play with incredible italian musicians (Fabri Kiarelli, and Alberto Bollati). Can you introduce them ? How did you find them ?  MT : I started the band over one year ago. Fabri and Alberto are both from Milan, Italy. They are great players and great singers. I got together first with Fabri and we found that we both liked the rock music form the 70s. Then I found Alberto through Fabri, we met and we jammed and wrote our first song together called ONE WAY.  That was it from there we wrote all the other songs together and to date we have done 5 shows as a band. One of them being at the Masters of Rock Festival In the Czech Republic. ThI was our first Open  Air show in front of 22,000 people and it was a blast ! The CD will be released on November 29 to support our upcoming 16 city Tour of Europe.  R'n'R : Are you free to play the music you want ?  MT : Yes at the moment. I am at a point in my life and career where I can do whatever I want. It’s a lovely feeling to be free.  R'n'R : Terrana is an important project for you. Do you think you can know success with this band ?  MT : Yes, this is the main focus at this point in my career. I have worked for so many people in the past and I'm a bit tired of being a side man. I think I know enough about music and the business to run my own band. So here i go. It’s definitely going to be challenging, but then again i have always loved a good challenge !  R'n'R : Are you still playing with Tarja Turunen ? She seems to be an angel in life.  MT : Yes Tarja is a good friend, a sweet lady and a great singer, i have known her for over 15 years now. Yes we will continue working together in the future with our project called Beauty and the Beat.  R'n'R : Terrana Band’s new CD will be out in the end of November 2014. What do you expect from this CD ? I heard some songs, it’s very powerful.  MT : I am not sure what to expect at the moment.  I think I just want to go out and play the best we can and have a good time making our music.  The guys in the band are great players and nice people, so it should be a nice experience for us and the fans that show up to the shows. I think the CD sounds good for our first one, it's a year in the making and will be released on November 29 at the start our first European tour.  R'n'R : Terrana’s CD cover is very interesting (I’m just a man). For you, it represents what rock’n’roll is ? Women, rock’n’roll, playing music ?  MT : I think both men and women like the cover. Music and beautiful women go together . They are both considered to be art and I don't have a problem to use one to sell the other ;)   R'n'R : When will you be on tour in France with Terrana ?  MT : I hope in 2015 spring.  R'n'R : You seem to move forward and you don’t want to look back. Why ? Are you afraid of the past ?  MT : I am always looking forward because the past for better for worst is the past. It’s over and there is nothing i can do to change the past. It is done. Many people spend too much energy thinking about the past, so much so they forgot to focus on the HEAR AND NOW and THE FUTURE ….so if you all caught up in your past, then you can't enjoy the present time or create new good things for your future. Simple, don't you think ? ;) FEAR, most of us have it but i think this is a learned response to change. This is not good because really nothing stays the same. We live in a world of random chaos. Everything is changing so why not embrace change. I don't fight it I roll with it and I don't fear it. Fear is what stops most people from achieving their Dreams and when you give up on your dreams, you’re dead.   R'n'R : Is internet an important media to spread your music ?  MT : The music business has changed so much, its harder than ever especially for young new artists. However I enjoy this change because I think the survivors and the people that really want to make music for the right reason will stay in the business. I also enjoy the fact that I as an artist have ALL THE CONTROL ! I don't need a label I don't need to ask anyone for anything. I just do it ! The internet has allowed artists like music self to communicate directly with their fan base. This is very important. The record companies used to keep us all in the dark and now it’s all there for us to see, use and control. I think this is a great time for established artists and a very bad time for new artists.  R'n'R : Do you have regrets in your career ?  MT : No. I have no regrets. Sure, i have made mistakes but those mistakes took me where i needed to be. Everything happens for a reason. I try to live as a good person and treat people with the same amount of respect and courtesy that i also enjoy. I have been a professional drummer for over 35 years and honestly, i never looked back and i never regreted anything that i have done.  R'n'R : Is there something you’d like to do in the future (musically) ?  MT : Yes, i want to sing more. I will make a Frank Sinatra Cover CD, to be released in the spring of 2015. I will also play drums on it. This is really something totally new for me and its fun ;)   R'n'R : Are you a happy and a free man ?  MT : Yes. I am happy and free because I created my own reality. Don't wait for someone else to do it for you ..because it will never happen !…;) Happiness and freedom are in your own mind !  R'n'R : The last word is for you.  MT : I would like to thank you for the interview and I would like to thank anyone out there reading this for their interest in my career. It’s always a nice compliment if people enjoy what I do.
