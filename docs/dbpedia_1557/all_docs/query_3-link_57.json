        "text": "Post by cozyal on\n\nLOL Jesse ...!\n\nDon't know how much I'll be drawn on naming culprits ..., but my fav drummers are as follows - With the obvious one first!\n\nCozy Powell (RIP) - All round top guy, he was the total entertainer as a drummer and great guy to talk to face to face. Often seen as mercenary in his actions, jumping all over the place, but always so passionate in all he did!\n\nI got to see him live with Rainbow, Whitesnake & M.S.G.\n\nWish I'd seen him with Sabbath (Tony Iommi Band I should say!), but never did.\n\nBrian Downey - With Thin Lizzy, great talent ..., yet due to many rock fans not buying into the Lizzy legend back in the day he was more often overlooked.\n\nNow jamming with his own low key project in Dublin, along with drum classes, when not doing the Gary Moore blues band 'thingy.'\n\nAlways loved catching him with Lizzy.\n\nNeil Peart - Simply because his talent is clearly immense and seriously on technical ability I still don't believe anyone can match him, although some come close.\n\nCarl Palmer - His playing astonishes me put simply, as he plays holding the sticks military style & how anyone can do that AND play the kit the way he does, is something else!\n\nJeff Porcaro (RIP) - Another absolute talent, much missed who I was fortunate enough to see on Toto's Seventh One tour at Hammy O back in the day.\n\nWish I'd got to see Toto more back then, but they rarely played the UK, like so many AOR / Hard rockin' bands.\n\nSimon Phillips - Seriously was the only man for the Toto job in my mind & I've seen him play with them here 3 times. Excellent!\n\nLove so much of his session stuff too!\n\nKelly Keagy - A good friend, a great drummer who sing fantastic too! Great perosnality, a good guy in rock!\n\nTotally jams as singer vocalist in hard rockin' Night Ranger!\n\nOK ...\n\nThat's my favorites ...\n\nThat's all I'm saying for now, although - & this will piss people off! LOL! - Mike Portnoy for all his talent - Which I do recognise - is a complete dick!\n\nThere I said it!\n\nThe guy constantly spits out huge amounts of flemmy gob \"at\" his bandmates, onto the stage in front of his drum riser so anyone walking by could slip & break something and the that would screw up Dream Theater big time!\n\nWhat a bloody loser! If he likes to spit so damn much why not get yourself a bucket next to you!\n\nAl\n\nPost by DrJJones on\n\n[quote author=jesse board=TALK thread=14396 post=98439 time=1256127391Ulrich was one of the three I had in mind with this thread. Though, for his part, I think even he will admit he sucks. However, I recall back in High School everyone seemed to think he was great (including me) and he was winning readers choice polls left and right. In retrospect, the guy is a one-trick-pony. It's a decent trick, but c'mon, Nicko McBain (Iron Maiden), Kirk Arrington (Metal Church), Ingo Schwictenberg (Helloween) and anyone who's ever been in Megadeth play circles around ol' Lars. [/quote]\n\nYeah, I understand what you mean. Around the time of 'Master Of Puppets' the UK was basically Mettalimad, whereas everything the band did was revered. I was never a massive fan, but they were good at what they did but it seems as though Ulrich was only in the band because it was, in essence HIS band.\n\nI never ever though thought he was that great but it was only when they started to cover other peoples songs that I truly realised it. The band completely miss out the acoustic middle section of 'Breadfan', they ruined 'Whiskey In The Jar', totally screwed up The Anti No-where League's 'So What' & ballsed up every Diamond Head song they attempted.\n\nUlrich is also a MASSIVE Status Quo fan. I only hope they NEVER attempt one of theirs."
