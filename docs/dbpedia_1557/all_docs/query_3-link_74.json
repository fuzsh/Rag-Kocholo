Both tracks were produced by Rossi / Frost and Tim Summerhayes was the Engineer for the album.\n\nJeff Rich and John \"Rhino\" Edwards also appear on the record.\n\nPost by Deleted on\n\nVery interesting find, their writing was so much better suited to other acts rather than Quo. They weren't a terrible song writing partnership per se, just so lightweight and twee when compared to Rossi/Young, coupled with some absolutely terrible production over the years.\n\nPost by drummer73 on\n\nnot bad at all. suits the band and production well, gives a different perspective. I'd hate this as a Quo track but removed from that I can appreciate the songwriting/melody. 60s britpop vibe. Enjoyed that. Francis is a clever bugger, as much as I've sometimes been disappointed by him over the years (my issue not his I suppose). I guess that's one of the reasons he's a millionaire and I'm not\n\nPost by mortified on\n\nThe first one, I'm In Love, reminds me of The Rutles. Remember them? So I suppose we're talking early Beatles' style. And The Beatles' influenced artwork is right in your face.\n\nOr, if I'm being a bit more critical, it sounds like outdated 90's retro. Outdated by about 6 or 7 years A la The Bluetones and all that.\n\nThe other one doesn't sound a million miles away from the first. Can I hear Francis's guitar in I Need Her?\n\nPleasant enough. Inoffensive. Although I'm not sure that's such a big compliment in pop/rock music. Well, not in my world\n\nTa for sharing though. Interesting.\n\nPost by fretbuzzzzz on\n\nInteresting find Quoincidence.\n\nIf I heard these tracks on the radio, in the background, initially I would have assumed they were Glenn Tilbrook/Squeeze. Having followed Squeeze and Tilbrook through the years my ears would have tuned-in straightaway. Though lyrically not exactly up there with Chris Difford's best work.\n\nRossi had been a Squeeze fan, 'Another Nail In My Heart' and 'Labelled With Love' sometimes mentioned. Think he even sent a message to them on one occasion, saying \"nice one\" about one of their songs.\n\nPost by Quoincidence on\n\nThe first one, I'm In Love, reminds me of The Rutles. Remember them?

Interesting.\n\nBoth Francis and Bernie performed on the tracks, as well as writing and producing them so yes, that is his guitar you can hear, and I assume Bernie is on acoustic.\n\nI'm sure Bernie is doing backing vocals during the chorus as well, as it sounds like his higher harmonies we all know and loved\n\nPost by unspokenwords on\n\nAs songs they are in my opinion much better than most of the dross Rossi has written in the past 30+ years. In fact they sound too good to be by Rossi but I think this is down to the singer.\n\nAs others have said a clear Squeeze sound and style.\n\nPost by Quoincidence on\n\nAs songs they are in my opinion much better than most of the dross Rossi has written in the past 30+ years. In fact they sound too good to be by Rossi but I think this is down to the singer.\n\nAs others have said a clear Squeeze sound and style.\n\nTbh, I could never imagine Rossi singing the songs, I could however hear Bernie doing the lead vocal for it.\n\nI think Bernie had an incredible singing voice. A shame he decided to leave the music scene in the early 2000's, but at this point he'd been in the business for 30 years producing, writing and performing on various albums with a list of other musicians, the likes of Phil Collins. Actually quite surprised his death wasn't mentioned elsewhere other than the Quo community really, but I suppose he was simply forgotten about, sadly.\n\nHis singing style / voice reminds me of Andy Bowns, on certain songs. 1 example being Rock And Roll Celebration from a Jack Lancaster album, where once again he worked with the likes of Manfred Mann, Phil Collins, Cozy Powell and Gary Moore."
