        "text": "I LOVE Come and Get It! Especially the intro. Saw them on this tour and enjoyed it live. They also played I'm A Rocker, RID, & Heavy Metal.\n\nWhat REALLY shocked me is they did NOT play Hard As Iron (1 of their fastest songs) or Blood Red Skies (had to wait about 25 years before they finally played it live)!\n\nWhen this was released, I don't remember ANY promotion. Didn't even know it was out until a friend gave it to me for my birthday!\n\nThe song Johnny B. Good was recorded for the film Johnny Be Good starring Anthony Michael Hall.\n\nReally think this is an unappreciated cd and one i fondly remember.\n\nAfter hearing the single Johnny B Goode, Ram It Down stayed in the shop, unwanted for two years, until one day, post-Painkiller and Nice Price offer, I plucked courage, paid up, took it home and attempted to ram it somewhere. I was pleasantly surprised.\n\nThe guitars have a rawness which give the intermediate vanilla tracks an edge.\n\nThe title track is absolutely bonkers with a solo akin to Charlie Chaplin on speed, staggering around, out of control, hilarious but fabulous all at once.\n\nHeavy Metal is groovy; cheesy of course, but Cornish Cruncher rather than a Turbo bland Edam.\n\nWhere Heavy Duty was merely a chant, Monsters is a fully realized song, and a good one too.\n\nThe obvious diamond Skies is a bona fide classic. I love the slow fade, which demonstrates there were quality decisions being made.\n\nMy favourite is the immense Hard As Iron, one of my top Priest songs.\n\nSo really not bad. Better than Turbo and Point of Entry, and I think I may prefer it to the next one.\n\nHmm aren't you a little hard on I'm a Rocker? I am afraid you're getting irritated by the lyrics. So much about metal and rock. And then another tune...!\n\nBut this has fine music and vocals. Love the melodies and solos and riffs too. Catchy chorus.\n\nNo, I just can’t see past the lyrics. This is a part of who I am - if your lyrics are subpar, I just can’t love it.\n\nHeavy Metal is awesome, Glenn is really tearing it up there. I must be the only one who likes Come and Get It\n\nYep!\n\nI LOVE Come and Get It! Especially the intro. Saw them on this tour and enjoyed it live.\n\nOr not! I just can’t get into those lame lyrics.\n\nNo, I just can’t see past the lyrics. This is a part of who I am - if your lyrics are subpar, I just can’t love it.\n\nNot saying you need to ignore the lyrics. But weird to see this having an as low grade as the other songs from this and previous albums. Do you really find the rest of the music as bad as the other 3's you gave?\n\nThis is not better than Love Zone? Even Private Property had a higher grade. What the....\n\nNot saying you need to ignore the lyrics. But weird to see this having an as low grade as the other songs from this and previous albums. Do you really find the rest of the music as bad as the other 3's you gave?\n\nThis is not better than Love Zone? Even Private Property had a higher grade. What the....\n\nThat goes to show how much lyrics affect what I'm listening to. Some of those songs have better music than the Turbo tracks you mention, but even worse lyrics and terrible production. In general, I'd say that my 10 point scale is divided between points for instrumental quality, lyric quality, performance, and production. So:\n\n1-5 = production, lyrics\n\n6-10 = musical quality, overall strong strength, emotional effectiveness\n\nThus, songs with a 3 or 4/10 essentially means that I think the music fine to good, but I would have rated the lyrics or production (or both) a 0/10 (which isn't an option). Songs with 6-10/10 generally have good enough lyrics and production to allow the instrumental and overall power of the song to ring through and end with a higher overall rating. Does that make sense? Probably not. Makes sense to me, though!\n\nI find it interesting that so many people dislike “Johnny B. Goode”. I’ve always thought that it was one of the best metal covers out there and was a cool spin on the original. I like it a lot; dunno what people don’t find good about it.\n\nIt's interesting, hence my higher rating than the bad originals on Ram It Down, but I just don't think it works. Metal bands covering blues songs was also a thing in the 80s and almost none of them really work for me beyond the initial oddity value. Priest covering \"Johnny B. Goode\", Megadeth tried \"These Boots\" and \"I Ain't Superstitious\", Armored Saint's cover of \"Saturday Night Special\", etc."
