        "text": "Kathmandu is the capital city of Nepal. One of the most densely populated cities in the world, Nepal’s largest city is a world away from the serenity of the nearby surrounding mountains and sacred valleys.\n\nMany visitors pass through Kathmandu before heading to other areas of the country, such as the national parks or trekking in the mountains. However, the capital of Nepal is a place of spiritual significance and well worth spending some time in. This vibrant city is rich in history, culture and offers a fascinating insight into Nepalese life.\n\nRelated read: Travelling solo to Nepal? Discover all you need to know.\n\nIn total, I spent seven days in Kathmandu. This includes four days of exploring the city before heading to Pokhara for the Annapurna Base Camp trek. I then returned there for three days after the trek. This gave me lots of time to explore all the sights and learn all about life in Kathmandu. I spent my days wandering the busy streets, exploring the Hindu temples and Buddhist monuments plus shopping at the local markets.\n\nWhile Kathmandu can be a little overwhelming, spending time there is an absolute must on any visit to Nepal. You could spend days exploring the busy streets, beautiful temples and local markets.\n\nIn the post below, I’ve shared my top tips for visiting Kathmandu. From preparing yourself for the chaos to knowing what to wear in Kathmandu, I hope the tips below help ensure you have a smooth visit to Nepal.\n\nTips for visiting Kathmandu\n\nJoin a food tour\n\nJoining a food tour was the best thing I did in Kathmandu. The narrow streets of Kathmandu are lined with delicious restaurants and street food stands. However, many of the local favourites appear quite alien to tourists.\n\nFor the first few days, I found myself only going where the other tourists were, and I didn’t feel like I was getting a true taste of the delicious food that was on offer in Nepal’s capital city. In the end, I joined a street food tour and I’m SO glad I did.\n\nThe food in Nepal is delicious. It’s a mix of flavours and aromas with Nepalese, Tibetan and Indian food on offer. The tour took us to several hidden restaurants that are popular with locals. We also got to try some incredible street food and visit some local temples.\n\nIf you want to join a food tour in Kathmandu, this is the exact tour I booked. I really can’t recommend it enough. It’s such good value for money and I don’t think I’ve ever been that full in my entire life.\n\nSome of the foods we got to try included the famous Dal Bhat, Momos, Thukpa, Masala Chai Tea Latte, filled naan bread and pani puri.\n\nWear sensible shoes\n\nWhen exploring Kathmandu, is a good idea to wear comfortable and sensible shoes. I made the mistake of going out in flip-flops on my first outing, and it didn’t go well.\n\nThe sidewalks and pavements in Kathmandu aren’t exactly the easiest to walk on. There are often deep potholes, gravel and sharp nails or metal sticking out from the ground.\n\nI’d recommend wearing closed-toe shoes to protect your feet as much as possible. You’ll likely also find yourself walking long distances, so make sure those shoes are comfortable.\n\nDress appropriately\n\nKnown as ‘The City of Temples’, Kathmandu is filled with religious sites including Hindu temples and Buddhist monuments. When walking around the Old Town and Thamel, I noticed a statue or temple on almost every corner.\n\nLike many other countries in Asia, women are expected to cover their shoulders and knees when visiting any religious spot or places of cultural importance. I didn’t find this as strict in Kathmandu as in some other countries I’ve visited, but it’s still expected.\n\nOverall, most women in Nepal dress conservatively. Even if you’re not planning to visit a temple, I suggest covering your knees and shoulders while walking around the city.\n\nWatch out for monkeys\n\nLike many destinations in Asia, the local monkeys of Kathmandu love to cause havoc for visitors and locals alike.\n\nThis is especially true when visiting Swayambhunath Stupa, one of the many ancient temples in Kathmandu. Also known as ‘The Monkey Temple’, this historic site is home to hundreds of monkeys and trust me when I say they are EVERYWHERE.\n\nThe monkeys have learnt that our bags often contain food, so it’s important not to carry any in your bag. If they get a whiff of any form of food, they will snatch your bag if they get the chance. There have also been reports of monkeys becoming aggressive when disturbed by tourists.\n\nThe best thing to do is to ignore them and make sure there is no food in your bag.\n\nBe prepared for the air and altitude\n\nThe air in Kathmandu city is anything but clean. The World Health Organisation has recently commented on how bad the air quality is in the city.\n\nAfter spending a couple of days there, I really felt the effect this was having on my body. With so much traffic and lots of dust, the air is very heavy and dirty and it’s not uncommon to be covered in smog.\n\nUnfortunately, there’s not much you can do about this other than be mentally prepared.\n\nKathmandu is 1,400 metres (4,600 feet) above sea level. While altitude sickness is very uncommon at this altitude, some people still feel the effects. Give your body time to adjust, get enough rest and drink plenty of water.\n\nDon’t drink the tap water\n\nThe tap water in Nepal is not safe to drink, and Kathmandu is no exception. The more I’ve travelled, the more I’ve taken risks with tap water, but don’t do this in Nepal. The water can be contaminated and isn’t clean.\n\nI highly recommend purchasing a LifeStraw for your visit to Nepal, especially if you are going hiking. I had always been a bit sceptical about how useful they really are, especially in the likes of Southeast Asia where filtered water is readily available. However, I found my LifeStraw VERY useful in Nepal.\n\nThe water isn’t safe to drink anywhere in the country. While it’s quite cheap to buy in the major cities including Nepal’s capital, it becomes expensive over time. It’s also very expensive in the tea houses on the hikes.\n\nI used my LifeStraw during my three weeks in Nepal with no issues. I also carried a reusable bottle which I could use for tap water and add a water purification tablet. This was useful for brushing teeth and drinking electrolytes.\n\nCarry cash\n\nThe official currency used in Nepal is the Nepalese Rupee, and cash is the easiest way to pay for things.\n\nSome of the more modern restaurants and bars will accept cards, but it’s not always the easiest way to pay.\n\nThere are ATMs all around Kathmandu, making it easy to withdraw cash. However, to avoid any issues with the ATM, I recommend going to an official bank ATM.\n\nThe streets in the city centre are also lined with places to exchange currency. The exchange rate is usually very good. Just be sure to count your money to ensure you’ve not been scammed.\n\nBe careful but confident when crossing the roads\n\nThe roads in Kathmandu are horrendously busy. Some of the busy intersections are controlled by police officers, but generally, it is a free-for-all (at least in the historic Old Town).\n\nBe extremely careful when crossing the roads. Bikes come from all directions and there is often no specific place for pedestrians to cross.\n\nOnce you’ve walked out into the road, the general rule of thumb is to keep walking. This way, drivers can predict where you will be and avoid hitting you. If you’ve been to Hanoi, you will know what I’m talking about. Having said that, use your best judgment and don’t take any risks. I often follow locals across the road, they know what they’re doing better than me.\n\nBe aware of scams and your safety\n\nOverall, Nepal is generally a safe place for visitors and tourists, including solo female travellers. I was a little apprehensive about my solo visit to Nepal, but my fears quickly alleviated when I realised how generous the locals were and how little they cared that I was a solo female traveller.\n\nHaving said that, no country is completely trouble-free, and crimes do occur in Kathmandu. Although quite rare, you might encounter petty crimes such as phone snatching and pick-pocketing. It’s a sensible idea to lock any valuables away and not walk around with your phone out.\n\nI walked around the capital city by myself and had no issues. Even at night, I drew little attention (although I stuck to the tourist areas). Even so, always use your judgment and don’t take any risks.\n\nScams are quite common in Kathmandu, with tourists being the primary victim. Don’t hand money over to anyone without first verifying who they are. I booked all my activities and accommodation through my hostel to ensure everything was legit.\n\nBook taxis and tours through your accommodation\n\nI’d suggest booking any taxis you need through your accommodation. Many taxi drivers in Nepal take advantage of tourists and charge much more than they should.\n\nBy booking through your hostel or hotel, you can agree on a rate in advance and ensure you’re not being overcharged.\n\nI’d also suggest doing this when arriving at the main airport, Tribhuvan International Airport. I booked a taxi through my hostel, but you can also book online in advance.\n\nTip: There are numerous tour agencies around Kathmandu. Check-in with your accommodation or on Google Reviews before booking any tours. Most are okay, but scams aren’t uncommon.\n\nCarry toilet paper\n\nToilet paper isn’t readily available in Kathmandu or Nepal as a whole. Many of the toilets in local restaurants and cafes require you to bring your own.\n\nIt’s a sensible idea to always have some in your bag. This way, you won’t be caught off guard and left stuck.\n\nMany bathrooms also don’t have a sink to wash your hands, so consider carrying some hand sanitiser.\n\nBe mindful of photography and filming\n\nIt’s perfectly okay to use your phone or camera to take photos in Kathmandu, but be considerate when doing so in religious settings.\n\nA few of the temples we visited had very clear signs that we should not take photos inside. This is out of respect for the locals and their place of worship.\n\nOne of the most popular things to do in Kathmandu is to visit a living goddess known as a Kumari. This can be done in Kathmandu Durbar Square, which is in the heart of the city. As tempting as it is to take photos, it’s considered extremely disrespectful and you will be asked to leave if you’re caught breaking the rules.\n\nEmbrace the chaos\n\nKathmandu is one of the most densely populated cities in the entire world. I had been warned about the chaos of Nepal’s capital city, but wasn’t quite ready for that level of chaos.\n\nKathmandu is crowded. The streets are narrow, and the Old Town area lacks pavements or sidewalks. It can be dirty. There are bikes everywhere, and crossing the road is terrifying. There is no organisation whatsoever anywhere. After spending six months in the mountains of New Zealand, it was certainly an attack on the senses.\n\nHowever, this is what also makes the city so special. If you’ve been to cities like Bangkok or Hanoi before, you’ll understand that this chaos isn’t necessarily a bad thing. It can just take some getting used to.\n\nBe prepared for the chaos and try to embrace it as much as you can. There really is no escaping the chaos unless you leave the city.\n\nResearch your itinerary ahead of time\n\nIt’s sensible to have an idea of what you want to do in Kathmandu. It’s a big city, and some of the tourist attractions are very spread out.\n\nWith such a rich history and a centre for cultural festivities, narrowing down how to spend your time in Kathmandu can be a challenge.\n\nBelow, I’ve shared just a few of the best things to do in Kathmandu.\n\nWander the streets of Thamel\n\nNepal’s capital is a great place to wander the streets aimlessly. The main hub of Thamel is filled with local markets, souvenir shops, art galleries, restaurants, temples, and numerous museums, so you can easily spend a day walking around. The local markets are especially fun to explore, with many local artisans selling traditional crafts and souvenirs relating to Nepal’s history and culture.\n\nVisit Kathmandu Durbar Square\n\nDurbar Square is one of the city’s historic centres and a great place to learn more about Kathmandu’s history. I highly recommend hiring a guide to take you around the area and teach you more about the surrounding wooden temples and places of cultural importance. (There are three Durbar Squares in Kathmandu, including Patan Durbar Square and Bhaktapur Durbar Square. All are well worth visiting.)\n\nThis tour is a great option.\n\nVisit the Boudhanath Stupa\n\nBoudhanath Stupa is one of the many UNESCO World Heritage Sites in Kathmandu and is Nepal’s largest Buddhist monument. Built during the 1300s, it is one of the most sacred sites of Tibetan Buddhism in Nepal. You’ll likely need a taxi to reach here, but it’s well worth it.\n\nExplore the Pashupatinath Temple\n\nThis is one of the oldest and most important Hindu temples in Kathmandu. Many Hindu locals bring their loved ones here to be cremated along the riverbank. The complex is a place of spiritual significance and an interesting insight into the culture.\n\nRelax in the Garden of Dreams\n\nThe Garden of Dreams is an escape from the chaos in Thamel. The urban oasis is a great way to see a different side to the city and simply relax.\n\nWatch the sunset at Monkey Temple\n\nSwayambhunath Stupa, aka the Monkey Temple, is a Buddhist monument in Kathmandu and one of the most popular things to do in Nepal’s capital. With epic views of the city, it’s a good spot to watch the sunset (just be prepared to be hassled by monkeys).\n\nJoin a food tour or try a cooking class\n\nI’ve already mentioned this above, but joining a food tour was the best thing I did in Kathmandu. I was a little overwhelmed by the food scene at first, but joining a tour allowed me to try foods I would never have tasted otherwise. A cooking class is another great way to experience the flavours of Nepalese food.\n\nGo on a scenic flight\n\nWant to see Mount Everest? Unless you’re attempting the Everest Base Camp trek, the best way to see Mount Everest from Kathmandu is to take a scenic flight. These short flights reward passengers with incredible views of the Himalayan range, including the tallest mountain in the world. It’s important to note you don’t get overly close to the mountain for obvious reasons, but it’s a special experience nonetheless.\n\nBest time of year to visit Kathmandu\n\nThe best time of year to visit Kathmandu is in the winter months, between October and February. For warm days, the clearest skies and the best chance of seeing Mount Everest in the distance, the early autumn months of October and November are a good choice. These two months are also a great time to hit the hiking trails around the Himalayas.\n\nJanuary and February can be very cold in Kathmandu, and hiking tends to be trickier due to the snow at high altitudes. However, it’s still possible to visit Kathmandu and other areas, such as Chitwan National Park.\n\nCome April and May, the haze sweeps into the city. By June, the monsoon season is in full swing. It’s generally recommended not to visit Kathmandu or Nepal between May and September.\n\nHow long to spend in Kathmandu?\n\nKathmandu is home to Nepal’s international airport, so it tends to be the starting point for most visitors. While some use Kathmandu as a quick layover before heading on to other destinations, such as the surrounding valleys or Pokhara, I’d suggest spending at least two days in the city.\n\nTwo days in Kathmandu will give you enough time to explore the main sights and get accustomed to life in Nepal. If you want to see all that Kathmandu has to offer, you can easily spend four days exploring the city and the surrounding area. This is what I did before hiking the Annapurna Sanctuary and it was the perfect amount of time.\n\nJust be aware that Kathmandu is potentially the most chaotic city I’ve ever been to (more so than the likes of Hanoi). With low air quality, crowds and motorbikes everywhere, it won’t be for everyone. As much as I love Kathmandu, four days was plenty of time in the city and I was more than ready to move on by the end.\n\nIs Kathmandu safe for solo female travellers?\n\nSolo travel, including solo female travel, is common in Kathmandu. I had no issues travelling to Nepal as a solo female traveller and encountered several others during my four days in the capital city.\n\nI have to admit that I was very apprehensive about travelling solo to Nepal. In fact, it was potentially the most nervous I had ever been. I had just spent six months backpacking New Zealand, and travelling to Nepal couldn’t have been more of a change.\n\nAs always, I had nothing to worry about. I only have good things to say about my experience as a solo female traveller in Nepal. All the locals were friendly and welcoming, and I received no unwanted attention for being by myself.\n\nFinal thoughts: Is Kathmandu worth visiting?\n\nIf you’re planning a hike in Nepal, you might be questioning whether it’s worth spending some time in Kathmandu. I personally love Kathmandu. Yes, it’s chaotic and an explosion on the senses. But it’s also rich in history, culture and is a great introduction to Nepal.\n\nSpending a significant amount of time in the capital city of Nepal won’t be for everyone. I met several other travellers who were struggling with the chaos and cleanliness of Kathmandu. If you’re not a big fan of big cities and not particularly bothered visiting the temples, I wouldn’t suggest spending more than a day or two in the city.\n\nThere’s no pretending that Kathmandu won’t be everyone’s cup of tea. However, this special and unique city really has so much to offer.\n\nDid you find this article useful? Save for later or share on social media.\n\nShare this guide"
