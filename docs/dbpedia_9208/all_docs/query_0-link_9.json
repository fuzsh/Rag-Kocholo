        "text": "Durbar Square lies at the center of Kathmandu’s historic district. Around the square are temples, monuments, colorful shops, and bustling streets. The square also has Kathmandu’s most famous building, the old royal palace. Built in the 1500s and 1600s, the palace has many courtyards. Outside the palace’s main gate is a huge stone statue of the monkey-god Hanuman.\n\nIn the Kathmandu valley is the Bodhnath Stupa, one of the largest Buddhist monuments in Nepal. Every year tens of thousands of people visit the Bodhnath Stupa, which is known for its white dome. Swayambhunath is another famous Buddhist site. Pashupatinath, one of the largest Hindu temple complexes in Southeast Asia, is on the bank of the Baghmati River. These three sites, along with Durbar Square, have been designated World Heritage sites by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO).\n\nKathmandu is also a center of culture. The Kaiser Library contains many rare books, while the National Museum displays weapons and artifacts from different eras of Nepal’s history. Another popular spot is the Balaju Water Garden, which has fountains and a swimming pool.\n\nPeople have lived in the region around Kathmandu for thousands of years. The city was officially begun in 723 ad by King Gunakamadeva. It was called Manju-Patan. It is said that in the 16th century a king built a temple in the city from the wood of a single tree. Because of that, the city was renamed Kathmandu, meaning “wooden temple.” A temple in Durbar Square is said to be that original building. Kathmandu developed independently of other places because of its mountain location. But that changed in the mid-18th century when a Gurkha warlord united the separate cities of the region into one kingdom. He made Kathmandu the capital, and it has remained the capital ever since.\n\nThe 1900s brought many changes to the city. In 1934 a major earthquake destroyed several of Kathmandu’s older buildings. Newer buildings later replaced them. In the 1960s and 1970s, the government built a national highway system. Seemingly overnight, the capital was joined with places that had been weeks or months away by foot. Since that time Kathmandu has grown rapidly. As a result, it has struggled with problems of overcrowding, poverty, and pollution. In the late 1990s the city was one of many scenes of fighting between government troops and rebels hoping to overthrow the government. The fighting continued into the 2000s. In 2015 another earthquake severely damaged the city, especially the buildings in its historic center. Population (2011 estimate), 1,003,285."
