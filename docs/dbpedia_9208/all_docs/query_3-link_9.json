This paper reviews some of the opportunities and constraints of tropical environments in South Asia, considering the range of land use practices deployed over the last 6,000 years in this region. I argue that some practices which could be called sustainable also come at a high cost in terms of human dignity,...\n\nAcheulean Hominins and Out of Africa Dispersals: Challenges and Advances (2018)\n\nDOCUMENT Citation Only Michael Petraglia.\n\nThe dispersal of Acheulean hominins outside of Africa is one of the most important research areas in human evolutionary studies, having been the topic of paleoanthropologists and archaeologists for many decades. Yet, precise knowledge about the timing and geographic movement of archaic hominins across Eurasia is still in its infancy. The aim of this presentation is to discuss what we currently know about the distribution of Acheulean hominins, and to report on new field work findings in southern...\n\nAffective Foundations: The Dissolution of Human Sacrifice under the Western Zhou, 1046-771 BC (2021)\n\nDOCUMENT Citation Only Andrew MacIver.\n\nThis is an abstract from the \"SAA 2021: General Sessions\" session, at the 86th annual meeting of the Society for American Archaeology. The transition from the Late Shang state (ca. 1300 – 1046 BC) based in Anyang to the Western Zhou state (ca. 1046 – 771 BC) founded in Shaanxi represents one of the most significant geopolitical and cultural transformations in ancient China. The conquest of the Shang by a Zhou-led alliance precipitated in the elimination of the human sacrificial rituals...\n\nThe Agency of Monsoons in South Asia (2018)\n\nDOCUMENT Citation Only Kanika Kalra.\n\nEvery June through September, the inhabitants of South Asia welcome and celebrate the southwest monsoons. The monsoon winds are the lifeline of this region but also a major threat, inspiring societies to devise mechanisms to both harness their potential and subvert the damage they may cause. This paper analyzes prehistoric and historical responses to monsoons in South Asia in terms of their unpredictable nature, and examines how the monsoons both facilitate and constrict people’s actions. In...\n\nAgricultural Labor Organizations and Management Strategies in the Prehistoric Erdaojingzi Site, Inner Mongolia, China (2023)\n\nDOCUMENT Citation Only Yufeng Sun. Yonggang Sun. Petra Vaiglova. Xinyi Liu.\n\nThis is an abstract from the \"SAA 2023: Individual Abstracts\" session, at the 88th annual meeting of the Society for American Archaeology. Food preparation is an arena for the understanding of social performances, and its scope is often indicative of the fabrications of social relations in historical contexts. This paper investigates daily food preparations in archaeological contexts and considers social bonds through the lens of mundane meals. By doing so, we aim to shift the focus from the...\n\nAgricultural Practices of the Qin People from the Warring States Period to the Qin Dynasty: A Case from the Matengkong Site in Guanzhong Basin, China (2023)\n\nDOCUMENT Citation Only Liya Tang.

By comparing these ancient...\n\nAlcohol, Rituals, and Spirits at the Late Shang Center: Residue Analysis of Ceramic Vessels in Anyang (2023)\n\nDOCUMENT Citation Only Jingbo Li.\n\nThis is an abstract from the \"Drinking Beer in a Blissful Mood: A Global Archaeology of Beer\" session, at the 88th annual meeting of the Society for American Archaeology. In the Bronze Age of China, alcohol practice was an integral part of rituals and the spiritual world as a social agent in hierarchical societies. Multiple types of alcoholic beverages appeared in the earliest writings of the late Shang dynasty some 3,200 years ago. However, little research has been done to characterize how...\n\nAnalysis of Ancient Chinese Pottery Utilizing X-Ray Fluorescence and Diffuse Reflectance Infrared Fourier Transform Spectroscopy (2017)\n\nDOCUMENT Citation Only Michael Deibel. Corinne Deibel. Ye Wa. Liping Yang.\n\nField studies were performed at the Yangguanzhai Neolithic site near Xi’an, China, using an Olympus Delta Premium portable XRF spectrometer and an Agilent ExoScan FTIR spectrometer. 932 ceramic sherds collected from nine locations across the site were selected and classified based on color (red, tan and brown), decorations (painted, rope impression - cord or thread, and plain), and time period (Miaodigou and Banpo IV). Each sherd was broken, so that the analysis could be performed on a clean...\n\nAnalysis of the Faunal Remains at Shangjing city site, Inner Mongolia (2013 excavation) (2017)\n\nDOCUMENT Citation Only Yu Han.\n\nThe Shangjing city site is located on the boundary between agricultural and herding subsistence economies in the Western Liao River Basin, eastern Inner Mongolia. The site was used as the Upper capital in the Liao Dynasty (A.D 916 - A.D. 1125) and the Northern capital city in the Jin Dynasty (A.D. 1115 - A.D. 1234). In 2013, several burials in the Liao and Jin Periods were unearthed, and more than 36,000 faunal remains, including bones and teeth, were collected systematically. Although Liao and...\n\nAn Analysis on the Taosi Cemetery from the Late Neolithic in North-central China (2018)\n\nDOCUMENT Citation Only Xiangming Dai.\n\nTaosi is one of the largest sites surrounded by the huge fortification during the late Neolithic in the middle Yellow River valley. So far the archaeologists have excavated a large cemetery, and uncovered a number of burials at Taosi. These burials can be divided into a few categories based on their scale, structure and grave goods, representing the different social ranks. The cemetery consists of several sections, which represent the different social groups. During the early Longshan period,...\n\nAncient and Historic Glass Production in India: Preliminary Results of Raw Material Analyses (2023)\n\nDOCUMENT Citation Only Thomas Fenn. Laure Dussubieux.

Quanjia Chen. Hui Zhou. Dongya Y Yang.\n\nThe Houtaomuga site is located on the east bank of Xinhuangpao Lake, in Da'an County, Jilin Province, Northeast China. According to the archaeological excavations, the Houtaomuga site can be divided into seven phases from the early Neolithic to the Late Bronze Age (8000-2050 BP). Although many Bos skeletal remains were found in the phases Houtaomuga III (6300-5500 cal. BP) and Houtaomuga IV (5000 cal. BP), it was very difficult to identify to the species level. In this study, ancient DNA...\n\nAncient DNA of a nomadic population provides evidence of the genetic structure of the royal ancient Mongols (2017)\n\nDOCUMENT Citation Only Jiawei Li. Ye Zhang. Xiyan Wu. Yongbin Zhao. Hui Zhou.\n\nThe genetic diversity of the ancient Mongols, especially the Gold family of Genghis Khan remains unclear. Gangga site was a nomadic site dated to the 8th to 10th centuries AD in the HulunBuir grassland, northeast China. This site belonged to the Shiwei population, believed to be the direct ancestors of the ancient Mongols. Nine graves at the Gangga site were excavated with log coffins, which were considered the characteristic burial custom of the royal ancient Mongols, included the Gold family...\n\nAncient DNA Studies of Domesticated Cattle in Northern China (2017)\n\nDOCUMENT Citation Only Xin Zhao. Dongya Yang. Jing Yuan. Xiaoling Dong. Hui Zhou.\n\nThis study aims to use ancient DNA techniques to characterize the genetic features of ancient domesticated cattle in order to trace the origin and spread of cattle in ancient China from eight Late Neolithic and Bronze Age sites in Northern China.

This study was focused on amplifying mitochondrial D-loop using standard PCR techniques....\n\nAncient genomics of Neolithic to Bronze Age Baikal hunter-gatherers (2017)\n\nDOCUMENT Citation Only Peter De Barros Damgaard. Jeremy Choin. Andrzej Weber. Martin Sikora. Eske Willerslev.\n\nGenome-wide data from hunter-gatherer populations of the Upper Paleolithic to Neolithic has provided unprecedented insight into the human evolutionary and demographic trajectory. However such datasets have hitherto been largely confined to Western Eurasia. The sole representative of Inner Asian past populations post-dating the split between paleolithic Europeans and Asians, as well as paleolithic Siberians and East Asians, are the Mal'ta and Afontova Gora individuals, the Ancient North East...\n\nAncient Mongolian Aurochs Genomes Reveal Connections to East Asian Cattle (2023)\n\nDOCUMENT Citation Only Katherine Brunson. Kelsey Witt. Sloan Williams. Susan Monge. Lisa Janz.\n\nThis is an abstract from the \"From the Altai to the Arctic: New Results and New Directions in the Archaeology of North and Inner Asia\" session, at the 88th annual meeting of the Society for American Archaeology. Societies in East Asia have utilized domesticated cattle since approximately 5,000 years ago, but the origins of East Asian cattle remain understudied. Possible experimentation with management of wild aurochs (Bos primigenius) and other bovids has been hypothesized but not explored in...\n\nAncient Residues Indicate Prehistoric Subsistence and Culinary Practices in the Korean Peninsula during the Middle Holocene (2017)\n\nDOCUMENT Citation Only Seungki Kwak.\n\nThis study attempts to understand ancient human subsistence using isotope analysis on the organic residues extracted from the archaeological potsherds collected from prehistoric coastal shell midden sites in the southern part of the Korean peninsula. In Korean archaeology, shell middens are useful for isotope analysis because they provide suitable condition in terms of organic preservation. To date, the subsistence of these prehistoric coastal and island dwellers remains poorly known. However,...\n\nAnimal Resources Utilization and Management at the Late Neolithic Dinggong Site, China: Evidences from Stable Isotope Analysis (2019)\n\nDOCUMENT Citation Only Yifan Wang. Yu Dong.

Andrzej Weber. Taichi Hattori. Tomonari Takahashi. Hirofumi Kato.\n\nIn the animal utilization and animal rituals of the Okhotsk culture, chronological and regional differences can be observed. Significant differences can be seen between the northern and eastern regions of Hokkaido in terms of the volume of archaeological artifacts recovered relating to both domestic animals (dogs, pigs) and wild animals. In northern Hokkaido, there are conspicuous differences in the use of a variety of fishes and types of sea urchins between the early period (Towada) and the...\n\nThe Anthropocene Divide: Obscuring our Understanding of Socio-Environmental History (2017)\n\nDOCUMENT Citation Only Andrew Bauer. Erle Ellis.\n\nMuch scientific debate has focused on the timing and stratigraphic signatures for the Anthropocene. In this paper, we argue that strident debate about the Anthropocene’s chronological boundaries arises because its formal periodization necessarily forces an arbitrary break in a long history of human alteration of environments. The aim of dividing geologic time based on a \"step-change\" in the global significance of socio-environmental processes goes directly against the socially differentiated and...\n\nApplying a Life History Framework to Analyzing Metal Age Metal Assemblages from Thailand (2017)\n\nDOCUMENT Citation Only Joyce White. Elizabeth Hamilton.\n\nApplication of archaeometric techniques to metals and related evidence from prehistoric sites in Southeast Asia is in its infancy. One result is that sample sizes per site have in most cases been minute or even unspecified, although in rare instances, such as Ban Chiang, sample sizes for metallographic and elemental analyses have been more robust and representative. Small sample sizes obscure key evidence for intrasite and regional variability in technological and economic systems. Recent lead..."
