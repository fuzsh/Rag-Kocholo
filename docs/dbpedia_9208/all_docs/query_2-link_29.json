        "text": "Nepal’s capital is Kathmandu. It is situated at an elevation of 4,344 feet (1,324 meters) above sea level in a mountainous area close to the intersection of the Bagmati and Vishnumati rivers.\n\nNepal is the neighboring country to India and shares the 1751km border with the country. It stretches its area around 1,47,181 sq km. Kathmandu is the largest city in Nepal. The city of Temples is another name for Kathmandu. Since 1985, Kathmandu has served as the home of the SAARC (South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation). A regional multilateral organization called SAARC was created by nations in the South Asian region. These nations are Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka. Nepali is the official language of Kathmandu and the Nepalese Rupee is the official currency. The city has the largest population in the nation. There were 975,543 people living in Kathmandu City as per the 2011 Census. In Kathmandu, 70% of the entire population is between the ages of 15 and 59.\n\nCapital of Nepal, Kathmandu – Establishment\n\nIn 723 CE, Raja Gunakamadeva founded Kathmandu and its original name was Manju-Patan; the current name refers to a wooden temple (Kath, “wood,” mandir, “temple,” or “edifice”) that was allegedly constructed in 1596 by Raja Lachmina Singh from the wood of a single tree. In the central plaza, a building that is allegedly the original still exists and is used to house sadhus (holy men). From 1768 to 2008, Kathmandu was the home of the Gurkha people’s governing Shah family.\n\nThe city's Newar merchant families have worked hard to make it the nation's most significant business and commercial hub. Kathmandu became the core of the country's transportation system in the 1970s as a result of the building of new roads and the growth of air service, which had previously only used footpaths. The Newar prefer to live in cities, and many residents work in agriculture.\n\nThe two main streets of Kathmandu stand in stark contrast to the older neighborhoods’ winding lanes and brick homes with carved doors and windows. Many modern-style buildings were built as a response to the 1934 earthquake’s devastation. The Taleju temple (1549), which is part of the former palace of the Malla rulers, is the most famous structure in the city. It was constructed by Raja Mahindra Malla. A statue of the Hindu god Hanuman stands guard at the palace’s main entrance, and many pagoda-style temples can be found in the nearby little square.\n\nThe parade ground, Tundi Khel, is to the east. At its center, there is a tree and stone platform from which significant government announcements were once given to the troops first. Former Prime Minister Bhim Sen Thapa built a towering watchtower between it and the city. The Singha Palace, formerly the official house of the hereditary prime ministers and currently housing the government secretariat, is one of the several palaces constructed by the Rana dynasty on the outskirts of Kathmandu.\n\nThe enormous white dome of Bodhnath, a Buddhist shrine treasured by Tibetan Buddhists, is located about 3 miles (5 km) to the northeast. The neighboring Kathmandu Valley was named a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1979 and is renowned for its extensive historical and cultural significance. It was added to the List of World Heritage in Danger in 2003 due to its vulnerability to urban sprawl, but it was taken off the list in 2007 after government conservation initiatives helped allay some worries.\n\nKathmandu Economy:\n\nA significant portion of the economy is tourism. The economy benefits from the artwork and handicrafts produced by its artists. Buddhist and Hindu visitors from all over the world visit Pashupatinath, Swayambhunath, Boudhanath, Changunarayan, and Budhanilkantha, among other important places in Kathmandu.\n\nKathmandu Tourism:\n\nKathmandu has numerous museums and art galleries. The Hindu and Buddhist religions are combined in the art and architecture of Nepal. The Kathmandu valley’s seven clearly delineated Monument Zones, which are a part of the city’s UNESCO World Heritage Site, are home to numerous temples, shrines, stupas, monasteries, and palaces. This city is the location of the well-known Pashupatinath temple.\n\nAlso Read: Most Popular Nepalese Dishes You Should Try\n\nKathmandu Festivals:\n\nKathmandu is a very happening city and numerous festivals are celebrated here the most important ones include the Shivaratri and the Machindranath Jatra, which features a procession carrying the image of the god Machendra; the Gai Jatra (festival of the cow); and the Indra Jatra, which features a procession honoring the goddess Devi, who is embodied by a young girl, in early autumn.\n\nEarthquake:\n\nNepal is an earthquake-prone country and its capital is no different. A magnitude 7.8 earthquake with an epicenter located around 50 miles (80 km) northwest of Kathmandu struck central Nepal on April 25, 2015. More than 1,500 people died due to this. Overall, the primary earthquake and subsequent aftershocks in Nepal resulted in nearly 9,000 fatalities and approximately 16,800 injuries. The buildings in Kathmandu’s historic center were particularly badly destroyed, and tens of thousands of people were left without a place to live."
