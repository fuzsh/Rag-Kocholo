        "text": "Kathmandu - the largest and the most sophisticated city capital of Nepal. It is also known as the 'City of Temples’ as numerous temples and shrines adorn every nook and street of Kathmandu. All the temples have a great historic, architectural as well as religious significance. Kathmandu is the meeting point of various ethnic groups as well. The city was founded around 723 AD as Manju-Patan. The then King Prithvi Narayan Shah declared Kathmandu as the capital of the whole of Nepal in the 18th century. Today, Kathmandu is a fascinating old city where pagodas, narrow cobbled lanes, old carved windows, and stone shrines are backdrops to the drama of life that continues unhindered. Here, experiences are amazing, views fascinating, climate appealing, and people friendly.\n\nKathmandu is embraced with scores of shrines, monuments, and scenic places. Some of the temples and historic sites have been listed as World Heritage sites. There are seven world heritage sites in the Kathmandu Valley alone - the three Durbar Squares in Kathmandu, Patan, and Bhaktapur as well as Pashupatinath, Bouddhanath, Swoyambhunath and Changunarayan, which are also the most revered holy places by the Kathmanduities. there are also several fascinating sites for enthusiastic visitors, to name a few; Balaju Water Garden, Budhanilkhantha, Chobhar Gorge, Dashinkali Temple, Jawalakhel National Zoo, Godawari Botanical Garden, etc.\n\nKathmandu may not be a big and developed city in comparison to other world cities but it has its own uniqueness. It is a charming old city and has something to offer everyone – the pagodas, narrow cobbled lanes, old carved windows, and stone shrines. There are living ‘Goddesses’ and re-incarnated ‘Lamas’ foreseeing the future with a roll of dice and their scriptural reference as well as walks that lead to adventurous and legendary places where ogres once lived. You can do some short trips around Kathmandu also."
