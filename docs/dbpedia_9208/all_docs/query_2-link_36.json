Also known as the city of temples, the city stands at an elevation of approximately 1,400 meters (4,600 feet) above sea level in the bowl-shaped valley in central Nepal.\n\nReligious and cultural festivities form a significant part of people's lives in Kathmandu.

Under KÃ¶ppen's climate classification, portions of the city with lower elevations have a humid subtropical climate, while portions with higher elevations generally have a subtropical highland climate. The city generally has a climate with warm days followed by cool nights and mornings.\n\nFamous landmarks of Kathmandu\n\nKathmandu is particularly famous for its religious monuments. Various temples, monasteries, and stupas adorn the city's landscape. The Pashupatinath Temple, Changu Narayan, Swayambhunath etc., are famous for their stunning, intricate religious artworks.\n\nUniversities and Colleges in Kathmandu\n\nKathmandu offers every kind of study course and college a student wants.
