        "text": "During the late 18th and early 19th Centuries, the principality of Gorkha united many of the other principalities and states of this Himalayan region into a single Nepali kingdom.\n\nFlanked by China and India, it is home to eight of the world's highest mountains including Mount Everest, known locally as Sagarmatha.\n\nAs one of the world's poorer countries, Nepal's economy relies heavily on aid and tourism.\n\nMore than 16,000 people died during the 1996-2006 civil war, which saw the Maoist party fight to replace the monarchy with a republic.\n\nThe Maoist party joined mainstream politics following the success of the peaceful democratic revolution of 2006 with Nepal becoming a secular state, and in 2008 declaring itself a federal republic.\n\nKhadga Prasad Oli, the leader of Nepal's largest communist party, became prime minister in July 2024 following the collapse of a previous coalition government.\n\nOli heads a coalition government made up of his Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist Leninist) and the Nepali Congress party, the two largest parties in Nepal. This is his fourth time serving as prime minister of the Himalayan nation.\n\nThe previous coalition government headed by Pushpa Kamal Dahal collapsed after Oli's party, which had been part of the coalition, withdrew its support.\n\nUnder the new power-sharing arrangement, Oli and the Nepali Congress party's president Sher Bahadur Deuba, 78, will rotate in holding the prime minister's post until the next general election in 2027.."
