        "text": "On March 17, during a ceremony at Barahi Ghat, the government of Nepal officially declared Pokhara as the country's tourism capital.\n\nThe event was presided over by Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal 'Prachanda' and was marked by musical performances by celebrated artists, symbolising the region's cultural richness.\n\nNepal has announced that it will seek China's assistance in the development of the Pokhara International Airport. The airport was built by China and was declared ready for commercial operation in January 2022.\n\nHowever, it remained unused as the governments of Nepal and China had conflicting views on whether it was a project under the Belt and Road Initiative. Nepal held onto the latter status. The plan is to operate regular commercial flights to and from China.\n\nThe government's announcement coincides with Nepal's final preparations to secure Chinese aid to build the Nepal-China Industrial Friendship Park.\n\nThe park is expected to be built on nearly 4,000 acres of land and could extend to 6,600 acres in east Nepal's Jhapa along the north Bengal border.\n\nThe park and a 327-MegaWatt upper Marsyangdi hydro energy project are likely to be formalised at Kathmandu's Investment summit on April 29-30.\n\nAbout Pokhara\n\nThe city is renowned for its natural beauty and serene ambience, as it is situated on the shores of Phewa Lake with the majestic Annapurna mountain range serving as a stunning backdrop.\n\nBoating on the lake, with the reflection of snow-capped peaks, is a favourite pastime for visitors seeking tranquility and adventure.\n\nPokhara is also a gateway to popular trekking routes like the Annapurna Circuit and the Jomsom Trek, while cultural attractions such as the Bindhyabasini Temple and the World Peace Pagoda offer a glimpse into the region's rich heritage.\n\nAdventure seekers flock to Pokhara for paragliding, zip-lining and other thrilling activities. Pokhara was elevated to tourism capital of Nepal after meeting rigorous criteria set by the authorities.\n\nAbout Nepal\n\nNepal is a country between China and India in South Asia.\n\nForm of government: Federal democratic republic\n\nCapital: Kathmandu\n\nCurrency: Nepalese rupee\n\nMajor Mountain Ranges: Himalaya, Annapurna\n\nMajor rivers: Karnali, Koshi"
