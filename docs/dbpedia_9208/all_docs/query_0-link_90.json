        "text": "In October 2018, I was lucky enough to visit one of the most remote places in the world, Mustang Kingdom in Nepal. Upper Mustang, formerly known as Kingdom of Lo, was a restricted area until 1992 which makes it one of the most preserved regions in the world. It is also one of the most sacred places in Tibet Buddhism with some of the most ancient Gompas (Buddhist monasteries).\n\nIn this 3 week long journey, we reached the capital of Mustang Kingdom, Lo Manthang and brought back very rare Buddhist Thangkas from Lo Manthang from local artists.\n\nTo get to Lo Monthang was the most exciting journey I had in my life:\n\n2 international flights: San Francisco to Shenzhen, Shenzhen to Kathmandu\n\n2 local flights in Nepal: Kathmandu to Pokhara, Pokhara to Jomsom (the last one is one of the most dangerous airports in the world with 3 airplane crashes in the last 10 years)\n\n4 days on a horseback form Jomsom to Lo Monthang. (as of 2018 there was no good road to this remote region of Nepal)\n\nHere's a short video from that unforgettable trip."
