        "text": "Kathmandu - Capital of Nepal\n\nMonday, December 02, 2013\n\nKathmandu, Nepal\n\nMy flight arrived in Kathmandu around midday, my aisle seat unluckily keeping me away from the good views of the Himalayas on the descent . My first impression of Nepal based on the airport was not all that positive. Kathmandu’s Tribhuvan Airport is one of those old school places where you have to walk down the steps from the plane and then board a bus to be taken to the terminal, a single brick building that looks more like a school or old factory than an airport terminal, quite a contrast to the spanking super-modern airport of my layover in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Nepal is a “visa on arrival” country for Americans and most westerners, which just means you have to pay a fee on entry that varies with length of stay in the country. Amazingly, my backpack arrived with me despite having to change planes and airlines several times along the way from Denver.\n\nMy 39 hours of travel from DIA to KMD were quite a marathon for me. I wouldn’t have thought it could take that long to get by plane from any one spot on earth to another. Having taken a few sleep aides on the long flights, though, I arrived unexpectedly perky for such a long trip .\n\nThe ride from the airport to my hotel in the Thamel neighborhood didn’t raise my initial impression of Nepal much. Traffic on the poorly paved road through town was an advanced state of chaos comparable to only a few places I can recall in my travels, while the crowding and poverty was initially a bit shocking. Within a few days, though, those conditions all will seem normal, I’m sure. Thamel is Kathmandu’s crowded tourist ghetto, full of budget accommodation, restaurants and bars, crafts shops, and tour agencies. My $15/night room in a somewhat hippie-oriented hotel named Alobar1000 is at least quiet and has its own bathroom. I could certainly have found a cheaper place to stay here, but when a single room with bath is $15/night there’s no point in doing shared hostel accommodation with a couple other smelly snoring people to save a few bucks.\n\nNepal is one of the world’s lowest income countries, just a few steps above many of the poorer African countries and one of the poorest in Asia . As a landlocked nation of over 30 million people Nepal has poor options for world trade and relatively few natural resources to develop beyond the tourism potential of its extraordinary scenery and possibilities for hydroelectric power development of its moist vertical topography. When was the last time you bought anything with a “Made in Nepal” label on it? Those seem rather limited to support such a significant population, so many Nepalese head to wealthier countries in Asia and the Middle East to many some money.\n\nNepal’s low-income status is apparent from the relative lack of modern development in Kathmandu, a major contrast to the glassy skyscraper centers that have developed over the last two decades in most Asian capitals. Just in case I thought I was mistaken on this and such a business center might be located in another part of town, the bird’s eye view of the city I got from\n\nthe top of the Bhimsen Tower, a nineteenth-century stone pillar with a spiral internal staircase to a viewing platform, confirmed my view .\n\nMy second major impression about my first South Asian city beyond poverty is of the high density and crowding, far more so than what I remember from China. By comparison most cities in Africa and Latin America seem spacious. In much of the world one to three story low rises are most common in most low income areas; in Kathmandu people are packed into five and six story buildings jam packed against each other, and the crush of people and motorbikes on narrow dusty streets is very claustrophobic.\n\nWhile the Nepalese nation has been unified for almost 250 years and was not colonized by the British, the population is actually made of a multitude of ethnic groups. Contrary to western mpressions created by stories of the Sherpas of the Everest region, the large majority of Nepalese are not Buddhist mountain people but Hindu lowlanders of the plains and foothills. The Hindu Newars are the main ethnic group of the Kathmandu Valley, although there are some Tibetan refugees and many members of other Nepalese ethnic groups in the capital too . Overall, though, I suspect the area has more in common with the Indian subcontinent to the south than the Tibetan plateau to the north.\n\nThe Kathmandu Valley has one of the world’s densest concentrations of UNESCO World Heritage sites, reflecting its ancient history and multiple religions, several of which I’m including as separate blog entries. Central Kathmandu’s Durbar Square is one of those, with an impressive\n\nset of multi-storied pagoda-like temples and a royal palace in an architectural style quite unique to the Kathmandu Valley.\n\nJust south of Durbar Square is the famous Freak Street, the old haunt of western hippies in the 1960s and 1970s when Kathmandu was the major destination at the end of the hippie trail from Europe through the Middle East and India. It’s nothing especially exciting nowadays, though, just a tourist-oriented commercial street with little to indicate it was once a world center of the drugs and free love culture.\n\nNot much news from Nepal appears to make it to the outside world because I somehow seem to have missed the major stories in the country’s recent history, including the Maoist rebellion of the 1990s and early 2000s that crippled the economy and greatly reduced tourist visitation and the murder of the King and other members of the royal family by the crown prince in 2001. And before I arrived I was still thinking Nepal was one of those “Himalayan Kingdoms” . I was mistaken; the monarchy was ended in 2008 and the country is now a republic.\n\nI learned other things too on my first day in town. My understanding has always been that cows are sacred to Hindus, so I was surprised to come across the ritual sacrifice of a water buffalo at the (Hindu) Indra Temple. It was then beheaded and its fur singed off with a blowtorch. Apparently, the sacredness does not apply to all bovines, and buffalo also features in Newar cuisine in the form of steaks and some very singed tasting meat I had for lunch on Newari thali platter in Patan.\n\nWhether to take off one’s shoes when entering Buddhist and Hindu temples isn’t entirely obvious either. Most of the time the answer is ”Yes” - you leave them by the door and wander around the temple barefoot. I thought this was a matter of respect. At other temples, though, it depends what kind of shoes you’re wearing and my trainers are OK….but I had to take off my leather belt before entering . So it is leather because it is made from animal hide rather than footwear per se that is the affront to the gods? Maybe, but I’m entirely clear.\n\nI’ve had some really good Asian food in Kathmandu, Korean and Japanese and Indian as well as Nepalese, and most restaurants provide the standard knife, fork, and spoon westerners are accustomed to, or at least chopsticks if the cuisine is East Asian. The most typical Nepali foods are rice and dal bhat, a type of lentil soup. These are supplemented on typical thalis (set meals served on metal plates and bowls) with vegetable and meat curries, pickles, raw vegetables, papadams, yogurt, and sometimes a chapatti. The ones I’ve had have all been pretty good. The local manner of eating, though, can be a little shocking to someone used to using utensils. Nepalis dump their soupy dal bhat and sometimes curries onto their rice, mix it around on their plate with their fingers, form the mixture into loose balls, and slurp it all out of their hand. It all looks very messy to someone from a society where mostly dry finger foods like sandwiches and little appetizers are eaten without utensils. I even find buffalo wings terribly messy but am told I’ll need to learn to adjust – apparently eating utensils are unknown is many parts of rural India. I\n\ncan’t wait!"
