There were small small pricipalities in the region. By late 18th century, Gorkha king Prithvi Narayan Shah united the priincipalities in the region into one kingdom. Learning from the experience of India under the British Raj, he banished the European missionaries from the country.

Peaks like Kanchenjunga (8598 metres) and Dhaulagiri (8137 metres) are also located in the Himalayas. Nepal's most beautiful animal and plant life is also found here in the north. Snow leopard is one such. The people here mainly work as porters and guides.
