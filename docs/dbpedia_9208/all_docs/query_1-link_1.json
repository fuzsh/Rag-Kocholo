        "text": "City of Temples, Capital of Nepal. Kathmandu\n\nNamaste üôèüèº World,\n\nKathmandu is the capital city of Nepal. You can explore thousands of years of culture here, while making your way through historic temples and monasteries that belong to Hindus and Buddhists alike.\n\nThe city stands at an elevation of approximately 1,400 metres (4,600 ft) in the bowl-shaped Kathmandu Valley of central Nepal. It is surrounded by four major mountains: Shivapuri, Phulchoki, Nagarjun, and Chandragiri. Kathmandu Valley is part of three districts (Kathmandu, Lalitpur, and Bhaktapur), has the highest population density in the country, and is home to about a twelfth of Nepal's population.\n\nHistorically, the Kathmandu Valley and adjoining areas were known as Nepal Mandala. Until the 15th century, Bhaktapur was its capital when two other capitals, Kathmandu and Lalitpur, were established. During the Rana and Shah eras, British historians called the valley itself \"Nepal Proper\". Today, Kathmandu is not only the capital of the Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal, but also the headquarters of the Central Development Region of Nepal. The Central Region comprises three zones: Bagmati, Narayani, and Janakpur. Kathmandu is located in the Bagmati Zone.\n\nKathmandu is the gateway to tourism in Nepal. It is also the nerve center of the country's economy. It has the most advanced infrastructure of any urban area in Nepal, and its economy is focused on tourism, which accounted for 3.8% of Nepal's GDP in 1995‚Äì96. Tourism in Kathmandu declined thereafter during a period of political unrest, but since then has improved. In 2013, Kathmandu was ranked third among the top 10 travel destinations on the rise in the world by TripAdvisor and ranked first in Asia. The city has a rich history, spanning nearly 2000 years, as inferred from inscriptions found in the valley. Religious and cultural festivities form a major part of the lives of people residing in Kathmandu. Most of Kathmandu's people follow Hinduism and many others follow Buddhism. There are people of other religious beliefs as well, giving Kathmandu a cosmopolitan culture. Nepali is the most commonly spoken language in the city. English is understood by Kathmandu's educated residents.\n\nKathmandu's sister cities (Lalitpur Patan) and Bhaktapur are integral to Kathmandu's cultural heritage, tourism industry, and economy; therefore UNESCO's World Heritage Site lists all three cities' monuments and attractions together under one heading, \"Kathmandu Valley-UNESCO World Heritage Site\".\n\nKathmandu's Tribhuvan International Airport (IATA: KTM), is the largest and only international airport in Nepal, located 5.5km east of the popular tourist neighborhood of Thamel.\n\nInternational Flights\n\nWhilst Kathamandu lacks direct flights to most of Europe, Africa, North and South America and Australasia, the airport is well connected and it is usually possible to reach Kathmandu with only one change of flight, in most cases using the same airline.\n\nDomestic Flights\n\nKathmandu Domestic airport is the major flight connecting routes to every major city with-in Nepal. I\n\nNight life\n\nBeing the capital Kathmandu has it's own night environment. Although the night life doesn't go all the way to the morning for the locals , night life style is especially focused for the tourist. Thamel hosts amazing musically inspired famous destination for tourist. Also, bars , restaurants, shops, hotels, casinos and nightclubs can be found operating till late. The government has focused night life style mostly for tourist so its a guaranteed safety and enjoyable night life environment.\n\nMusic\n\nMusical talents is one of the greatest attributes of Kathmandu. You can find lots of great live band pubs and restaurants throughout the whole week. Also, cultural music venues and locations can be found but wont be operating until the late as live bands. Rock bands are mostly famous and accepted around the musical scene of Kathmandu. Places such as Sisha live, LOD (lord of the drinks) popular club and restaurants, Purple Haze, Ragge bar etc hosts live band through out the whole week.\n\nCluture\n\nKathmandu culturally is very very rich. The temples and the locals reflects the various cultures that the city holds. If you arrive during the festival season during October you will definitely catch the glimpses of various cultures in Kathmandu. Each has its own unique representations and unique belief purpose on cultural aspects. Nepalese culture binds all the citizen together but with in several caste culture holds the communities and culture strength and their cultural authenticity."
