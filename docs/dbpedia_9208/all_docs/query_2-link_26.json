        "text": "Kathmandu is the capital of Nepal. It’s also the largest metropolis in Nepal and serves as the central hub for economic, cultural, and political activities.\n\nKathmandu is known for its beautiful temples, palaces, historic sites, and iconic landmarks, many of which are UNESCO World Heritage Sites. Kathmandu is an essential gateway for travelers heading to the Himalayas, including treks to the Everest region. It is a vibrant city, a melting pot of cultures and traditions, and offers a unique blend of the ancient and the modern.\n\nWhere is Kathmandu?\n\nKathmandu is located in the Kathmandu Valley in the central part of Nepal. The valley is situated in the Bagmati Zone of the country and is surrounded by four central mountains: Shivapuri, Phulchowki, Nagarjun, and Chandragiri. The Bagmati River flows through the valley, passing through the center of Kathmandu.\n\nThe city’s geographical coordinates are approximately 27.7 °N latitude and 85.3 °E longitude. The elevation of Kathmandu is about 1,400 meters (4,600 feet) above sea level. The valley is an ancient lakebed with fertile soil and flat terraced fields, surrounded by green hills and snow-capped mountains at the horizon.\n\nHistory of Kathmandu\n\nKathmandu has a history that dates back over two millennia. Its rich tapestry of cultures, rulers, and events has made it a central location in the history of Nepal.\n\nKathmandu’s history begins with ancient legends. One of the most famous tells of the Bodhisattva Manjusri cutting a gorge at Chobar with his sword, draining out the water from the Kathmandu Valley, a lake, to make it habitable.\n\nThe oldest known inscription in the Valley is from the 5th century AD, but the area was settled long before.\n\nThe early medieval period saw the rise of the Licchavi dynasty. The Licchavis ruled from around the 4th to the 8th century and are credited with many of the city’s early Hindu temples and Buddhist monuments.\n\nBy the 12th century, the Malla dynasty began to emerge.\n\nThe Mallas are often credited with the golden age of Kathmandu’s architecture and culture, and this period witnessed the construction of many of Kathmandu’s iconic structures, including those in Durbar Square.\n\nThe Malla rule from the 12th to the 18th century is marked by division and rivalry among multiple Malla kings reigning over the Kathmandu Valley’s three city-states: Kathmandu, Bhaktapur, and Patan. These divisions often led to artistic and cultural competitions, further enriching the city’s architectural and cultural landscape.\n\nDespite these divisions, the Valley experienced a renaissance in arts, architecture, and culture during Malla’s rule, with Hinduism and Buddhism thriving.\n\nIn the late 18th century, King Prithvi Narayan Shah of the Gorkha Kingdom embarked on a mission to unify the fragmented kingdoms and principalities of the region. In 1768 he conquered the Kathmandu Valley and shifted the capital to Kathmandu.\n\nWith this, the Shah dynasty began its rule, establishing the Kingdom of Nepal and integrating Kathmandu into a larger national framework.\n\nIn the 19th century, the Rana dynasty took power and essentially ruled as hereditary prime ministers, reducing the Shah monarchs to figureheads. The Ranas ruled with an iron fist and were responsible for many palatial structures in the city.\n\nIt was only in 1951 that the Ranas were overthrown in a political movement, reintroducing a democratic form of governance and restoring power to the Shah monarchy.\n\nThe late 20th and early 21st centuries have seen significant political changes, including a bloody civil war and the eventual abolition of the monarchy in 2008, turning Nepal into a republic.\n\nFollowing the catastrophic and bloody Nepalese Civil War from 1996 to 2006, Kathmandu found itself at the epicenter of a devastating earthquake that caused further damage and chaos in the city.\n\nOn April 25, 2015, a magnitude 7.8 earthquake struck Nepal, with its epicenter near Kathmandu. The tremor caused widespread devastation, affecting Kathmandu and other parts of the country.\n\nThousands of lives were lost, and countless historic temples and monuments were damaged or destroyed. The earthquake caused substantial disruption to the daily life of the residents and had immediate and lasting effects on the city’s infrastructure and economy.\n\nIn the aftermath, there was a concerted effort from both national and international agencies to provide immediate relief, such as food, shelter, and medical care, to the affected population.\n\nKathmandu has experienced many layers of history, each leaving its mark on the city’s culture, architecture, and spirit. From ancient legends to modern struggles, Kathmandu stands as a testament to the resilience and vitality of the Nepali people.\n\nFeatures of Kathmandu\n\nKathmandu features streets striking with a blend of ancient architecture and modern developments. The city has historic temples and palaces that harken back to its days as a pivotal center of Hinduism and Buddhism. The air often carries the subtle aroma of incense, mingling with the more robust scents from local markets and street food vendors.\n\nKathmandu’s most notable aspect might be its people. The city is a melting pot of cultures, ethnicities, and traditions. Festivals, celebrated by various groups, brighten the city almost every month, showcasing a dance of colors, sounds, and rituals. The warmth and hospitality of the Kathmandu residents stand out, always ready with a smile and often eager to share tales of their storied homeland.\n\nGeography and Climate\n\nKathmandu enjoys a temperate climate, categorized by four main seasons. The city experiences a warm spring from March to May, followed by the monsoon season from June to August, where heavy rainfall is prevalent.\n\nFrom September to November, autumn is particularly popular among tourists due to its moderate temperatures and clear skies, offering splendid views of the surrounding mountains. Winter, spanning December to February, is relatively cool, with temperatures sometimes dipping close to freezing, especially at night.\n\nPopulation\n\nKathmandu has a population of around 1 million residents. The city boasts a diverse demographic mix. While the Newars are indigenous and have greatly influenced Kathmandu’s culture, architecture, and festivals, the city has seen a significant influx of people from other parts of Nepal due to its economic opportunities and central position.\n\nThis migration has added to the city’s cultural richness, with various ethnicities like Brahmins, Chhetris, Gurungs, Sherpas, and many more calling it home. This diversity is evident in the many festivals, cuisines, and languages spoken in the capital.\n\nEconomy\n\nKathmandu is the economic center of Nepal and significantly contributes to the nation’s GDP. Traditionally, handicrafts, arts, and sculptures were prominent trades, and while they remain essential, the city’s economy has diversified over the years. Given Kathmandu’s rich cultural heritage and status as a gateway to the Himalayan treks, tourism plays a vital role. The city boasts many hotels, restaurants, and travel agencies catering to tourists.\n\nAdditionally, the city has grown in information technology, banking, and telecommunications sectors. The real estate market in Kathmandu has also witnessed expansion, with numerous housing and commercial projects dotting the landscape. Furthermore, as the capital city, Kathmandu houses many government offices and international organizations, employing a significant portion of its population.\n\nHowever, it’s worth noting that Kathmandu faces challenges, including traffic congestion, pollution, and infrastructural limitations, which affect its economic health. Yet, the city remains a hub of opportunity, attracting investment and talent from across Nepal and beyond.\n\nThings to Do and Places to See in Kathmandu\n\nKathmandu is a treasure trove of cultural, historical, and architectural wonders.
