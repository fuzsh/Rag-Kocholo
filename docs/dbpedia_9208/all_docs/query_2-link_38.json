        "text": "Hint: Capital is that place in a particular country or nation, which enjoys a huge amount of economical and political significance. It is considered as the meeting point of intersection for the entire nation.\n\nComplete answer:\n\nThe ‘capital’ of the country is often that place or area which contributes to its growth and development in a maximum sense. Some countries also have the capital which represents or portrays their history and culture. ‘Nepal’ is the country situated quite near to India and the two countries share a bond of close affinity. The capital of Nepal contributes to its growth and often represents the respective country in the global market. So, let’s analyse the options one by one:\n\na. Dhaka, is situated in Bangladesh. It is the capital of Bangladesh. As the said place is already a country’s capital then, it cannot be the answer. So, ‘a’ is the wrong answer.\n\nb. Butwal, is situated in Nepal. It is a city in Nepal which is located in the Lumbini province. Butwal is known for its development and contribution to Nepal’s revenue but it is not the country’s capital. So, ‘b’ is the wrong answer.\n\nc. Kathmandu, is situated in Nepal. It is the most famous place of Nepal as it contributes largely to its development. From the geographical perspective also, Kathmandu is also seen as the meeting point for all the cities in the respective country. It is an important place that enjoys a huge amount of economical and political significance. All the characteristics of the place indicate that Kathmandu is the official capital of Nepal. So, ‘c’ is the correct answer.\n\nd. Saichin, is a glacier which is situated in the Karakoram range of the Himalayas. It holds a huge amount of military and strategic importance for the three countries; India, Pakistan and China.\n\nThe correct answer is ‘C. Kathmandu’.\n\nNote: In order to deal with such questions, students are advised to remember the capitals of the countries. One can easily remember the capital of the respective country as it holds a huge amount of importance in terms of cultural, historical and economical contributions. Nepal is famous because of Kathmandu as it is known as ‘city of temples’ and one can remember it by such titles according to it."
