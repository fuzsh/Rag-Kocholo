This class is dependent on the standard toolkit used in conjunction with Rogue Wave Views. It can be used only if you link your final application with the system toolkit supported by Rogue Wave Views (on Unix platforms, you must use the library libmviews instead of libxviews and link with the Motif library). If you do not want to use these libraries, you can use a dialog box class based on Rogue Wave Views gadgets (IlvIPromptString) that does not need the system toolkit, but that depends on the gadgets library of Rogue Wave Views.
