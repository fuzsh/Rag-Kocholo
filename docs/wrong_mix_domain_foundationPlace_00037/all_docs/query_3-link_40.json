        "text": "2024-05-14 CLDR v46 - Survey tool open for general submission\n\n2024-04-17CLDR v45 released\n\n2023-12-13CLDR v44.1 released (an update to CLDR v44)\n\n2023-10-31CLDR v44 released\n\nWhat is CLDR?\n\nThe Unicode Common Locale Data Repository (CLDR) provides key building blocks for software to support the world's languages, with the largest and most extensive standard repository of locale data available. This data is used by a wide spectrum of companies for their software internationalization and localization, adapting software to the conventions of different languages for such common software tasks. It includes:\n\nLocale-specific patterns for formatting and parsing: dates, times, timezones, numbers and currency values, measurement units,…\n\nTranslations of names: languages, scripts, countries and regions, currencies, eras, months, weekdays, day periods, time zones, cities, and time units, emoji characters and sequences (and search keywords),…\n\nLanguage & script information: characters used; plural cases; gender of lists; capitalization; rules for sorting & searching; writing direction; transliteration rules; rules for spelling out numbers; rules for segmenting text into graphemes, words, and sentences; keyboard layouts…\n\nCountry information: language usage, currency information, calendar preference, week conventions,…\n\nValidity: Definitions, aliases, and validity information for Unicode locales, languages, scripts, regions, and extensions,…\n\nCLDR uses the XML format provided by UTS #35: Unicode Locale Data Markup Language (LDML). LDML is a format used not only for CLDR, but also for general interchange of locale data, such as in Microsoft's .NET.\n\nWho uses CLDR?\n\nSome of the companies and organizations that use CLDR are:\n\nApple (macOS, iOS, watchOS, tvOS, and several applications; Apple Mobile Device Support and iTunes for Windows; …)\n\nGoogle (Web Search, Chrome, Android, Adwords, Google+, Google Maps, Blogger, Google Analytics, …)\n\nIBM (DB2, Lotus, Websphere, Tivoli, Rational, AIX, i/OS, z/OS, …)\n\nMeta (Facebook, Messenger, WhatsApp, …)\n\nMicrosoft (Windows, Office, Visual Studio, …)\n\nand many others, including:\n\nABAS Software, Adobe, Amazon (Kindle), Amdocs, Apache, Appian, Argonne National Laboratory, Avaya, Babel (Pocoo library), BAE Systems Geospatial eXploitation Products, BEA, BluePhoenix Solutions, BMC Software, Boost, BroadJump, Business Objects, caris, CERN, CLDR Engine, Debian Linux, Dell, Eclipse, eBay, elixir-cldr, EMC Corporation, ESRI, Firebird RDBMS, FreeBSD, Gentoo Linux, GroundWork Open Source, GTK+, Harman/Becker Automotive Systems GmbH, HP, Hyperion, Inktomi, Innodata Isogen, Informatica, Intel, Interlogics, IONA, IXOS, Jikes, jQuery, Library of Congress, Mathworks, Mozilla, Netezza, OpenOffice, Oracle (Solaris, Java), Lawson Software, Leica Geosystems GIS & Mapping LLC, Mandrake Linux, OCLC, Perl, Progress Software, Python, Qt, QNX, Rogue Wave, SAP, Shutterstock, SIL, SPSS, Software AG, SuSE, Symantec, Teradata (NCR), ToolAware, Trend Micro, Twitter, Virage, webMethods, Wikimedia Foundation (Wikipedia), Wine, WMS Gaming, XyEnterprise, Yahoo!, Yelp\n\nThere are other projects which consume cldr-json directly, seehere for a list.\n\nHow to Use?\n\nMost developers will use CLDR indirectly, via a set of software libraries, such as ICU, Closure, or TwitterCLDR. These libraries typically compile the CLDR data into a format that is compact and easy for the library to load and use.\n\nFor those interested in the source CLDR data, it is available for each release in the XML format specified by LDML. There are also tools that will convert to JSON and POSIX format. For more information, see CLDR Releases/Downloads.\n\nHow to Contribute?\n\nCLDR is a collaborative project, which benefits by having people join and contribute. There are multiple ways to contribute to CLDR.\n\nTranslations and other language data\n\nCLDR has an online tool to gather data, theSurvey Tool. The Survey Tool is open twice a year to gather data for new structure, and make corrections in previously-released data.\n\nFor languages that are already available in the Survey Tool, seepicking a locale. If your locale is not already available in the Survey Tool, see Adding new locales.\n\nContribute as an individual (vetter) for your language by setting up an account\n\nQualifying organizations (companies, governments, institutions, etc) can request for an Organization level contribution status. Please file a ticket if you need organization set up.\n\nUnicode voting members can join the technical committee for bigger impact. The CLDR Technical committee is responsible for assessing the Survey Tool features, proposals for additions or changes to structure, bug fixes, and final resolution of each release of CLDR.\n\nCode and Structure\n\nThe CLDR tooling supports the interactive Survey Tool, plus all of the tooling necessary to test and process the release. Programmers interested in contributing to the tooling are welcome; they may also be interested in contributing to ICU, which uses CLDR data. For more information, seehttp://cldr.unicode.org/development.\n\nCLDR covers many different types of data, but not everything. For projects which may cover other types of data, seeOther Projects.\n\nPeople may file tickets with bug fixes or feature requests. Once a ticket is approved, they can also create pull requests onGitHub.\n\nWho has contributed?\n\nMany people have made significant contributions to CLDR and LDML; see the Acknowledgments page for a full listing.\n\nWhat is the Schedule?\n\nCLDR has a regular schedule, with two cycles per year. There is a consistent release schedule each year so that implementations can plan ahead. The actual dates for each phase are somewhat adjusted for each release: in particular, the dates will usually fall on Wednesdays, and may change for holidays.\n\nThe two important periods for translators are:\n\nSubmission: translators are asked to flesh out missing data, and check for consistency.\n\nVetting: translators are asked to review all changed or conflicted values, and reach consensus.\n\nThe details for the current release are found in Current CLDR Cycle."
