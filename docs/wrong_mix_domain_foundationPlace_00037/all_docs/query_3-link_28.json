In this area, he has led the development of several hybrid numerical methods, including the hybrid method combining QALE-FEM and MLPG_R method, the hybrid method combining SPH (Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics) and MLPG_R method and the hybrid method combining ESBI and Enhanced Nonlinear Schrödinger Equation.\n\nPublications\n\nPublications by category\n\nBooks (3)\n\nMa, Q.

Designers of offshore structures could soon benefit from a new software tool under development at City University London. The research team, which has already been awarded more than £100k in funding, claims the tool can model the behaviour of extreme ocean waves more accurately, efficiently and consistently than current technology.\n\nhttp://www.eurekamagazine.co.uk/article/33221/Offshore-engineers-to-benefit-from-new-wave-modelling-tool.aspx\n\nWave-modelling tool could improve offshore structures. The design and maintenance of offshore structures such as oil rigs and wind turbines could benefit from a new wave-modelling tool currently in development.\n\nRead more: http://www.theengineer.co.uk/wave-modelling-tool-could-improve-offshore-structures/1008371.article#ixzz1aNhZm0DK\n\nTHE. Qingwei Ma, reader in hydraulic engineering at City University London, has been awarded a Chang Jiang Scholarship by the Ministry of Education of China. Dr Ma came to the UK in 1992 and started a PhD at University College London in 1994. He joined City in 2002, and was promoted to a senior lecturer position in 2004 and then appointed reader in 2007. The Chang Jiang Scholarship was established in 1998 by China's Ministry of Education and the Li Ka Shing Foundation - a Chinese charitable organisation that supports education and healthcare activities through grants and sponsorships, with the aim of developing Chinese research institutions through the engagement of Chang Jiang scholars. Dr Ma said he appreciated the prospects that the scholarship, to be based at Harbin Engineering University, would give him. \"Only a small number of Chinese universities have a chance to host this professorship - around 100, \" he said. \"I will use this opportunity to extend my collaboration with Chinese researchers in my area.\""
