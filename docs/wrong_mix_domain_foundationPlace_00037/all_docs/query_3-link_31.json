The creation of Dubai’s towering Burj Khalifa, Beijing’s ‘Bird’s Nest’ National Stadium and Sydney’s iconic Opera House and Harbour Bridge are all feats of civil engineering.\n\nCivil engineering is a broad profession combining functional solutions with creativity and innovation to improve society. Civil engineers are responsible for the design, planning and testing of buildings, towers, transport infrastructure, gas and water systems, sewerage schemes, irrigation systems, new mines and many more facilities."
