All Rights Reserved. 7 Why develop on Linux?\n\n8. © 2016 Rogue Wave Software, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 8 Lots of reasons • Powerful command line and tools • Many options for productivity improvement – scripting, etc. • Free as in free speech – modifiable, customizable, community-driven • Ease of prototyping • Accurate testing by easy recreation of production environments • Better web development with a natural environment for Apache or nginx • Hardened security options such as SELinux • Paving the way for containers and microservices • Automation through Puppet/Chef/Ansible • Remote administration through ssh • Scale to huge sizes without huge license costs • Linux makes you look cool!\n\n9. © 2016 Rogue Wave Software, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 9 It’s great for web development • Linux is the home of the LAMP stack – Native support for major tools and frameworks • Linux is a great web app prototyping environment – Easily install multiple servers / instances on one machine – Easy access to error logs for debugging • Countless other web platforms – Drupal, WordPress, Tomcat . . .\n\n10. © 2016 Rogue Wave Software, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 10 Web dev tools • Web application frameworks – Node.js, Rails, Zend • Web servers & load balancers – Apache, NGINX, tinyHTTPd • HTML editors and IDEs and syntax checkers and . . .\n\n11. © 2016 Rogue Wave Software, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 11 Any downsides? • Too many ways to create “Linux apps” – A surfeit of APIs, frameworks, run-times and tools – No clear path to apps and interoperability (cp. Android) – Result is fragmented app space, ISV confusion and costs • Orphan desktop – Tiny market share – Limited hosting of popular commercial apps – Mixed UX, difficult installation on some notebooks\n\n12. © 2016 Rogue Wave Software, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 12 How do I get started?\n\n13. © 2016 Rogue Wave Software, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 13 Pick your flavor • Linux is just the kernel surrounded by a suite of supporting software • It’s that supporting software that differentiates one flavor of Linux from another • Pick a flavor that suits your level of expertise, the tools you’re likely to use, and the hardware environment on which you’ll deploy • Main differences include package management and ecosystem, preinstalled software, and current Linux kernel version • Pay attention to the community as well – quick releases, fast response to security vulnerabilities, development priorities • Some distributions are highly focused, such as Kali Linux for Security Professionals\n\n14. © 2016 Rogue Wave Software, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 14 Something for everyone…\n\n15. © 2016 Rogue Wave Software, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 15 Porting and interoperability • Cross platform development – Cross compiling with gcc and GNU tools – Cross platform frameworks and libraries • Emulation and libraries – Full virtual machines – VirtualBox, QEMU et al – Libraries and platforms – Wine, Crossover, Cygwin, Bash-on-Windows, Steam . . . • File systems – Samba, NFS, FAT\n\n16. © 2016 Rogue Wave Software, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 16 Editors and IDEs on Linux • Your favorite IDEs are already ported • Eclipse and IntelliJ both run very well • UX is nearly identical to other operating systems • Editors such as Sublime Text and Atom are easy to install • And classic command line editors such as vim, emacs, and nano let you edit powerfully from the shell\n\n17. © 2016 Rogue Wave Software, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 17 Your first install… • Your Linux flavor’s community will provide installation media, usually in the form of a bootable ISO • During the install, you’ll be able to configure system, software, and network options • Many distros will allow you to choose a particular theme for your preinstalled software • Such as in the next slide, where CentOS 7 allows you to choose between various environments • From there, you can: – Use the flavor’s preferred package manager to install additional software – Download packages for anything not provided by the package manager – Build from source!\n\n18. © 2016 Rogue Wave Software, Inc.
