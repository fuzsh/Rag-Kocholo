        "text": "Hello everybody! Welcome to Awakening the Entrepreneur Within. I'm Michael E Gerber Â speaking to you from Carlsbad, California in my little home office just dying to Â bring the knowledge, the wisdom, the Â passion the energy that's needed for you to grow beyond where you are to do Â things you in fact haven't even imagined Â you have the capability of doing. As Â always in awakening we have our guests Â and our guest here is quite Â astonishingly successful he's Justin Â Singletary and he's the founder of Â fulfillment dot-com. I don't know how in Â the world Justin you acquired the name Â fulfillment but maybe you can tell us Â the very beginning how you do that. Absolutely it's good to be on with you Â Michael. First off by God's grace is how we Â acquired that domain name. So I'll tell Â you a little bit of our story and Â that'll help fill in the gaps on how we Â got that wonderful domain name because Â it's opened so many doors for us. My story is I was brought up in Savannah, Georgia; beautiful Savannah Georgia by Â the way and I was brought here due to Â the fact the military station been here. I joined the army and became a ranger at Â 1st Ranger Battalion and became a sniper Â team leader so is it what it is. Justin, you join the army became a what it's an Â Army Ranger 1st Ranger Battalion Â now everybody doesn't get to become an Â Army Ranger right? They don't they don't there's this turn ring yeah they don't Â get to become and I mean you don't go to Â the Army's I want to join become an Army Â Ranger. So I'd love to just talk about that Â for a second here get on to fulfillment.com because becoming an Army Ranger in Â my mind has something to do with your Â enormous success. When you left the army Â to come on the street and go into Â business for yourself. mm-hmm. The two don't seem to fit but they absolutely do based on the conversation Â you and I were having just before we Â came on. Absolutely we get people to care. How do we get people to want to? How do Â we get people to desire to? How do we get Â people to do the impossible work that it Â takes to do? You become pre-eminently Â successful and you became an Army Ranger. So tell me what an Army Ranger is, tell Â all of our guests feel like. Well an Army Ranger is simply a glorified grunt. We Â the operation is really it used to be Â Airfield seizures but our mere agents. They're , it's a special operations unit and we just do a lot of great and Â creative missions and the people we work Â with are really high speed top-notch Â guys and that's what I probably miss the Â most about it is is the guys that we Â served with. So I mean it was just a joy Â to be able to be around comrades you Â know, that that have that went through Â kind of that sacrifice to get there the Â US Navy SEALs but in the armies and and Â we don't do a lot of swimming. And you're Â like the Top Gun pilots in the Air Force . I would I would say we're we're not at Â the top you know we're quiet Â professionals you know we have a good Â time doing what we're doing but we're Â very mission focused. But every time I Â speak to a Navy SEAL or every time I Â speak to a Top Gun guy he sort of Â downplays how extraordinary they Â are so I completely understand when you Â do that but I simply want people who are Â listening to us your that absolutely Â variance of working with the best guys Â on the planet. Absolutely. There was a lot of people Â that tried to be you know an Army Ranger Â and I'm not just saying graduating Rain Â Ranger school but being into a Ranger Â Battalion there's a lot of guys that Â tried to do it. The guys that made it Â were the guys that had a bigger y-you Â know, they they had a bigger purpose it Â wasn't that hey I'm gonna go try out for Â this. It's this is just one stepping Â stone in my journey of life that I'm Â gonna be an Army Ranger. That's just what Â I'm gonna do. There's no quit there so you tend to Â find guys that have that sort of Â attitude are the ones that actually make Â it through to become an Army Ranger. So Â it wasn't a little bit of a gap on, you Â know what it takes, you know it's it's Â some prayer and you know you know just Â being able to put one foot in front of Â the other and enjoy it. Yeah yeah yeah . But it's how you put that one foot in Â front of the other Justin, let's not Â diminish that because the same thing is Â the greatest entrepreneurs of all time. When they just in codes put one foot in Â front of another. It's not just that they Â put one foot in front of another. It's Â that they're on fire. That's where it's Â their ability to focus is what I think. Focus on the outcome you're looking Â for instead of the activities, you're Â focused on the outcome. So I think I Â learned that early on is really as where Â you put your focus that's where your Â Energy's gonna flow and if you put your Â focus on the pain that's where your energy's gonna go, that's that's what Â you're gonna be thinking about. If you Â put your focus on well this is this is Â what this is. My outcome that I'm Â going to achieve that's what you're Â thinking about you put your folks there Â it's a lot easier to achieve it and the Â way you speak about it sounds easy but Â understand no it isn't what that outcome Â is. Absolutely. It's seeing it Â you your business you see it before it Â ever happens you already know what's Â gonna happen and they they're just like Â I said put one foot in front of the Â other until you get there. No I got it, it's really hard to describe that to Â people and you you know more than most Â Michael, it's it's it's really first I Â feel like you got to work on the way Â that you see the world you know, the lens Â in which you see the world and if your Â lens is a negative type of lens then Â that's how your life usually turns out Â if your lens is always seeing that glass Â half-full then usually your life just Â turns out a little bit happier than the Â next guy and I think that really says a Â lot about the guys we served with. They Â were always more positive than the rest Â you know they focused on the good. I got it and of course we can then talk about Â Steve Jobs and we could then talk about Â Bill Gates and we could then talk about Â Ray Kroc and we could then everybody Â whose cup wasn't half full have whatever Â absolutely completely full bring their Â vision, their purpose, their mission the Â picture they have had an internalized in Â their minds eye as the outcome. They're Â there to produce. That's right. I think it's something I've been writing about, speaking about teaching about and doing Â all of my life and what I understand and Â what's so staggeringly painful to me is Â how difficult it is to get people to see Â it. Absolutely that mental preparation is Â one thing that people like to skip over, they just like to get into it. Well Â there's you've got to be mentally ready Â for what's to come or you know you're Â not gonna be prepared for it. Do you see a lot of these greats that Â they drop out of college because that Â vision is so it's they don't need Â college anymore it's it's already Â happened in their minds they know how to Â execute. Okay so we sort of get what is to be an Â Army about. Getting fulfillment time, okay Â so I started after the military a couple things happen. What's important to Â discuss is I jumped into internet sales Â of health and beauty products. I wanted Â to be an entrepreneur, I wanted to make Â money when I sleep because I had so many Â other goals and aspirations that were outside of money that I thought you know Â being an Internet retailer really helped Â me accomplish that so I did really well Â with that but I had a pain point to Â where I couldn't find a good fulfillment Â solution. The fulfillment solutions that Â we were using and I was back in 2011 Â they didn't really have the transparency Â I needed, they didn't have the follow-up, I need to have somebody I could talk to Â about if something went wrong there was Â a lot of issues I was dealing with so I Â decided to do my own fulfillment. Now Â wait a second Â because define for everybody what you Â mean by fulfillment. Absolutely, so fulfillment the way I'm defining it Â is is ecommerce order fulfillment. Let's Â say you have a product that you sell Â online and somebody orders your product. Well they buy from your website the Â information comes to a fulfillment Â center possibly like ourselves and then Â we ship it out to the customer that Â purchased the product and we send you Â back the information tracking number all Â excess so it's it's really we handle Â your product for you. You never even get you don't even have to touch your Â product, we receive it from a Â manufacturer and we ship it out to your Â customer. So we store, we pick pack and we Â ship your product. That's what the fulfillment that I'm talking about is Â defined as. Got it and the problem was as Â you began to sell stuff. Mm-hmm. You said you couldn't find a fulfillment capability that was too much neater. To Â be honest when he went to my standard we were doing our own fulfillment we're Â like okay we got to scale this thing. When we got to about fifty to hundred Â orders a day it was like okay well, let's Â have somebody else do this so we can Â focus on other areas of our business the Â marketing side of the house, customer Â service side of the house, there's so Â many relationships you know that we Â wanted to to entertain that we were busy Â packaging packages and you know and just dealing with the fulfillment and the Â poster side of the house that we're missing opportunities so at about 50 Â orders a day or so maybe maybe it was a Â hundred orders a day we said okay well Â it's time for us to outsource this. It was a good time for a sound source and Â when we did we searched around for a Â couple of good fulfillment centers. They Â were good for a couple of months and Â then you know we started having Â problems, people weren't getting their Â packages, there was mispacks, the Â packages were coming in late. There was numerous things and we couldn't, I couldn't really take one invoice and Â reconcile it to exactly what happened, what got shipped out it was really hard Â to see what we're paying for, so at the Â end of the day I decided you know what I Â see there's a void in the marketplace. There's this this isn't I don't know somebody other than Amazon that is doing a great job at fulfillment right now . This is something that we can really do Â a good job at. Well that's interesting Â when you said other than Amazon yeah Â this happens to be the biggest fulfillment center on the planet. For Â their own products. For their own Â products that's right right, so you decided you're gonna create Â a fulfillment center as excellent as Â Amazon's for other people's products for Â independent online retailers people that Â have their own website and they're Â they're not using Amazon and they're Â selling it amongst other means I mean Â right now we have 65 different ecommerce Â platforms that we support so there's a Â lot of different ways to sell products Â these days so really to make a long Â story short it was called at cost Â fulfillment right, so we charge less than Â all the competitors around and we got a Â large percentage of the marcus year i Â had eight hundred square feet above a Â pizza shop and and we were we had so Â much product in there i thought the Â floor was gonna cave in and going on top Â of the pizza shop. But it was were the good days man you know we were we were Â actually trying to figure out a way to Â have a shoot from the second-story out Â of the window into the delivery or the Â the USPS truck when it came everyday so Â it was a fun time but we really focused Â on. I had a ranger buddy of mine that Â actually become a developer and we spent Â many a nights you know working on our Â art technology so that we can add more Â value to internet retailers or our Â clients so we actually we're the Â cheapest guys on the block Michael and Â soon we figured you know we don't want Â to be Â cheapest guys. We want to spend more time Â and development. Spend more time Â developing this business out to where we Â were adding more value to our clients so Â we were like well this name act cost Â fulfillment isn't gonna fit anymore. So Â you didn't want to be the cheapest guys Â you want to be the best guys. That's Â right that's right. You know if we got into the game being Â the cheapest guys cuz honestly I didn't Â have the bankroll you know to build an Â Amazon or something that could compete Â with another large fulfillment center so Â we're like well let's just guys they Â just don't care you know where they care Â but they just they want the cheapest Â price on the block let's help them out Â and their friends so we'll know we'll Â take care of them and let's just grow Â this business how I like to say slow is Â smooth smooth is fast. Let's not grow it too fast to where we Â self implode let's not take on we have Â no debt still at this time so we just Â wanted to do it in a way that was Â methodical, in a way that we knew we can Â build a very strong foundation so the Â business can grow and still be strong at Â the end of the day. So you essentially Â utilized your determination to be in Â quotes the cheapest cars to make access Â readily available to folks who didn't Â understand the difference between the Â cheapest guys and the best guys. Yep they Â wanted the cheapest and they gave you an Â opportunity then to go to work on the Â systems through which one achieved the Â result that you wish to achieve on your Â way to becoming the best we are still Â supplying the same the same service or Â maybe in a better service because we Â didn't have that many clients at the Â time but with 800 square feet there you Â don't have a lot of bills, and when you Â have to or you know one two three four Â employees you know you don't have a lot Â of payroll so you can charge a lot less Â for your services. We're doing with that Â handful of people that handful of space Â . Yeah was figuring out the mechanics of Â it way that enabled you to rise above Â everyone else right because you were Â working on it the e-myth phrase that we Â continually use because Â we invented it what just doing it doing Â it doing it doing it that's right I was Â in the business every day I was in the Â business you know and try it trying to Â troubleshoot and trying to figure out Â what systems can we put in place so we Â can move to a new activity in the Â business and eventually you know so I Â can be working on the business. So I Â spent a lot of time working in the Â business and and there was some times Â where I probably should have outsourced Â where I didn't if I if I would have Â known what I know now I probably Â wouldn't be able to do it two or three Â times faster. Yeah but Justin when you speak about Â that I want to give you just an insight Â about it when you speak about it working Â in the business in my vernacular the way Â you were doing what you were doing was Â literally working on the business Â inventing the systems of the business . You're exactly right here never enable Â the systems to liberate you feeling it Â doing it doing it that's right. I had to Â be in the weeds listening to what the Â customers were the clients were saying Â you know seeing how all the operations Â were going in though is kind of in the Â trenches working on everything but you Â know you're right while I was working on Â everything you're also building systems Â to make those things and fix things Â forever and make things more efficient, faster for for future projects or future Â shipments and that's a very very very Â important thing for everybody listening Â in because that's really what the e-myth Â is all about when I talk about working Â on it not in it I mean not being the Â system yourself but inventing the system Â that's going to ultimately make you an Â ordinary person significantly more Â effective at what you produce which Â means you can then attract novices to do Â the work that needs to be done because Â it's already orchestrated and was system Â that produces that result that's right Â in people and attract people that are Â that are prepared to do what I need them Â to do that's Â they're at in their life cycle you know Â I mean maybe it's it's something that is Â very easy for them to do but that's what Â they want to do you know yeah so I Â absolutely that we were working I Â correct myself you know on the business Â it seemed like at the time we're in the Â business because you know everything's Â being thrown at us Â sure absolutely of course you were but Â you got to understand this language Â we're using yes we're literally Â designing a business to work that's Â right in a way that would make that Â business significantly more effective Â than the competition that's correct you Â were designing a role for your company Â in the world so that you would become Â fulfillment calm innards that's right Â when we felt like we had the right tools Â or we got to the point where we added Â enough value we decided that we didn't Â want to be the cheapest guys in the Â block anymore so it's it's hard to make Â money be the cheapest guys in the block Â unless you know it's at scale but we Â decided well we really want to change Â the way that fulfillments done we see a Â lot of things or we're anticipating Â things that are coming down the road Â where one facility is just not going to Â be enough so let me backup but based on Â the fact that we thought we had enough Â value it's like okay we got to change Â your name now at cost and film it isn't Â gonna work it work anymore for the for Â the well what we stand for Â then our name was at cost fulfillment Â then cost fulfillment which represented Â us perfectly at the time yeah so we Â found that um you know at the time I had Â a business partner and we talked about Â it we're like you know what what could Â be what's the best name out there that Â we you know swing for the fences on this Â you know and we found that eBay Â enterprises just I believe they acquired Â GSI commerce and brought along a domain Â name fulfillment coms so they're holding Â this domain name not really doing Â anything with it so we offered him Â $50,000 for the domain name and we Â didn't get a response from him so we Â went back to the drawing board I want Â this domain name Â how do we just get their attention you Â know I I mean we're we're thinking about Â throwing a blind you know bid not even Â having the money to figuring out how to Â get the money so we're excited ok what's Â the number where they'll get back in Â touch with us they'll call us back so we Â threw a number 500 thousand dollars for Â that domain name they called us right Â back and it we ended up doing the deal Â and I think you know I think at the end Â they said okay just as long as you don't Â sell the Amazon in the next 24 months Â we'll do the deal but it was funny how Â you know we got no response and then we Â got a call right back so I'm sure we Â overpaid for that domain name but it has Â paid us dividends based on the fact Â dollars come from all over the place the Â sofa you know grandma you know I mean we Â pulled it together we needed to get it , we got it but you know between me and a Â partner. That's right that's right so we Â had assets that we had a good internet , a Â good online nutraceutical business at Â the time so you know we found the money Â you know eventually and we paid for it Â and it was like okay now we've got to Â deliver on where fulfillment.com now . Now we have to be the best you know Â we're making ourselves be the best with Â that domain name. That's incredible I Â just absolutely love that I hope Â everybody heard that I hope everybody Â took that in, guy picks an impossible Â name finds out who's got it offers them Â an outrageous amount to buy it and they Â don't even respond so you develop ten Â times that amount no one you would get Â the response and they immediately call Â you. That's right that's right. There you are without $500,000 having Â offered $500,000 and I've seen amount of Â money for a name lady yes is mm-hmm Â because our Ranger knew that name Â would become who he was. Well I'm gonna Â tell you, you know in theirs I understand Â there's a lot of people that have Â different religious preferences but I Â like fulfillment.com Jesus fulfilled Â the Scriptures and I believe there was a Â lot of Prayer that helped us get that Â domain name. Wonderful okay so now I know Â you got the name now everybody knows how Â you got the name Â you bought the name. Absolutely. You've Â paid through the nose for the name. We Â did, it was we had big shoes to fill now Â if you google fulfillment I mean just Â the word fulfillment we would sometimes Â be above the dictionary the dictionary Â definition so as far as just the organic Â traffic from the search engines when Â people are searching for us it's helped Â us out tremendously, it's helped us in Â the beginning, it helped us seem like we're a much Â bigger company than what we actually Â were and it really. What's that of course, Â yeah. Does it attract an enormous number Â of leads of people who want your Â services? Let me say I think it's just Â the right amount because we've adjusted Â to the lead generation, we've adjusted Â the business to it and it's allowed us Â instead of to spend a lot of money on Â pay-per-click ads and you know social Â media and other marketing tactics that Â people just throw a lot of money at. It's Â allowed us to spend that money in kind Â of other directions on yeah I'm getting Â the know you have standards that you've Â already established yes Â signs of customers you will accept Â that's right we've got a target we tend Â to see a lot of people aren't truly Â ready for a fulfillment center it Â depends on your product of course we Â tend to see is about 50 orders a day Â when we have people that we used to you Â know our doors rope and we'll take Â anybody when people are ship Â one or two orders you know a day or Â they're shipping one or two orders a Â month you know we restored a lot of Â product here and we've got to charge Â them for that product so we feel like Â under about 50 orders they may not be a Â win-win for them we're actually Â developing out so we can widen our Â funnel to help those people that are not Â shipping 50 orders a day we're actually Â launching hopefully this year a program Â that's that's a posted printing platform Â so people can actually if they're at Â their office or in their garage they can Â go to film accom and print postage and Â then when they get to that 50 orders a Â day they're still in the same platform Â and they can use us for fulfillment Â maybe on the other side of the country Â that they're not on or they can use us Â for you know all of our locations so Â we're going to be expanding that funnel Â probably this time there sometime this Â year so does everyone who is shipping 50 Â a day get to use your fulfillment center Â we we've I would say we ship everything Â from pills in a bottle to beds in a box Â so we've got a very wide range of people Â well we've what we tend to look for is Â independent online retailers what that Â means is if somebody has a website and Â they've got a product a tangible product Â that they ship out and it's about 50 Â orders a day and they're connected to an Â e-commerce platform and even if they've Â got their own custom code we've got all Â restful API so we can really integrate Â with anything that's really our target Â market and do they have to fill out a Â questionnaire when they contact you we Â we like people to go through our request Â a quote on fulfilling comm it helps give Â us a little bit more information and see Â if there's the right fit but we tend to Â like to reach out to everybody at the Â end of the day we like to place them in Â places like or give them access to our Â education blog that we have on phone Â comm that'll help them maybe get to that Â 50 orders a day there's a lot of great Â vendors in that free education vlog that Â they talk about their services not only Â allowed vendors on there that are Â actually helping clients that we already Â have so I know they're legit so we try Â to try to help them in other ways they Â can get to that volume I got it so Â that's a critical part of your Â company yes I'm in short the way in Â which you move someone from here to Â there that's right understanding that Â it's not as easily done as I've just Â said moving somebody from here to there Â because in order for somebody to become Â in quotes a ranger to the qualify to Â become a ranger they have to go through Â a very very specific process that's Â right that enables them to do that Â Mike well I didn't do it on my own yes Â I'm saying the guys around it we helped Â each other right we helped each other Â get from A to B so starting out in an Â e-commerce I needed the help and it's Â not like who I knew it's it's I like to Â say it's not who you know it's who knows Â you so the network that I tried to Â establish or even in Ranger Battalion. That the guys that I hung out with were Â the guys that were gonna succeed those Â are the guys that I went to when I had a Â problem where I wanted to to talk Â through things with I made sure that the Â people that I hung around with Â especially in e-commerce were people Â that were successful that people that Â that knew what what to do now and not Â what to do five years ago because the Â landscape is changing so fast. No I got Â that but let me suggest another piece of Â this puzzle, then we're not really Â talking about that there is a very Â specific process one has to go through Â and there's a very specific process one Â has to go through to become a ranger to Â be kind of a US Navy SEAL even if I'm a Â Top Gun to become whatever a true Â entrepreneur absolutely epic set of Â skills and and systems that are critical Â for one to move through that process the Â Quran says somebody it's not just Â getting motivated and jacked up by Â somebody it's getting motivated and Â jacked up by somebody who's in fact paid Â the price of going through that very Â critical process and has the right Â system for you to follow that's right Â you've got it and so I'm going to Â that without even knowing because we Â haven't done a lot of work together Â you've only spoken a few times together Â um you were attracted to what we do and Â we were attracted by what you've done Â yeah and we ended up in this Â conversation together but what I really Â want to suggest is there is a Â significant way to go beyond where you Â are by in fact developing what it is you Â possess internally by developing that in Â people who haven't a clue what that is Â mm-hmm another sand they haven't a clue Â what that is because nobody's ever even Â suggested it to them Â there was no method to that madness so Â I'm gonna suggest not only do you Justin Â but to everybody listening in that's Â really the work we've been doing for the Â past 40 years Â that is truly determining what it is Â that transforms a company of one to a Â company of 1,000 what it truly takes to Â awaken the blessed entrepreneur within Â the Creator within to go beyond where he Â or she is and we love to say that um if Â we're born in the image of God as it Â said and I know you believe this if Â we're born in the image of God then we Â were born to create mm-hmm and if every Â single human being is born to create Â then the question that drives them to Â create what well to create a world fit Â for God mm-hmm and each of us are called Â to do that in one specific way mm-hmm Â so effectively you found your calling Â leaving the military coming to good Â earth planet USA you discovered your Â calling and began to be a US Ranger in Â the work that Â you set out to do mm-hmm but in your Â heart in your heart you know you were Â born to create you know you were born in Â the image of God you know that's what in Â fact your work is telling you to do and Â that's the great result that you're Â setting out to produce absolutely he Â wants us to do the best at whatever we Â do no matter what we no matter what we Â touch we need to have passion for it we Â need to do we need to do it our best and Â I'll be honest with you what I've seen Â people around me what I've seen Â successful entrepreneurs what I notice Â if somebody gives if somebody shows me Â their last 24 hours or a 24 hour period Â I can tell you or you can tell if Â somebody's gonna be successful based on Â where they spend their time they spend Â their time in educating themselves Â mentally preparing themselves you know Â those are the guys that are gonna or Â guys and gals that are gonna be Â successful the ones that spend their Â time wisely like I think it was Arnold Â Schwarzenegger said sleep faster you Â know I mean he said that he spends like Â six six hours of sleeping and if some Â people need eight sleep faster so I it's Â just like where do you spend your time Â if you're not spending your time in a Â program or if you're if you're not Â actively doing something you need to be Â preparing to do something and you know Â what this brings me to Â I read the e-myth your book after your Â your beautiful wife handed it to me at Â Board of Advisors I went on my honeymoon Â and I brought the book with me and I shouldn't have you know I shouldn't have Â read started reading a book because it Â led me on my honeymoon to start Â developing a new blueprint for the next Â three years of filming calm I was I was Â doing that on my honeymoon so I don't Â think my wife will be watching this I Â think what I was working on she knows Â now but you know it's it's really I Â learned a lot from reading your book Â Michael and exactly what you're saying Â there there's there's systems that I Â didn't think that I didn't think I was Â doing the things that I was doing in the Â beginning but when I read your book I Â realized I was doing those things and I Â realized there's more of those things Â need to be done in order for us to get Â more efficient more SOP Â we need to have a product that it that Â can be duplicated and can be improved Â upon so I just want to say you know that Â story as far as reading the book and Â then coming up with a new vision or more Â precise vision for the team was crucial Â and it's gonna be crucial for our next Â three years that's wonderful and Â understand while you say that it's going Â to be crucial for the next three years Â understand it will be crucial for the Â life of your company absolutely so today Â somebody who fires it and then of course Â it's up to them Â yep absolutely

only can you persevere through those Seasons but learn to see the good in everyday life again from perceived failure to the fourth fastest growing consumer product in America in that you have look at the experiences that you have what lights you up and then how do you take all of that and then bring God into it and expand the kingdom in some way he's lived it and you can too all right my friends welcome back to another episode of fulfilled it's truly an honor having one of my dear friends on with us today and Zach Wendall in addition to being one of the nicest guys on the planet and I really mean that Zach is an entrepreneur a speaker he's an author really has a heart for just helping others see the good in their everyday lives but more than anything there's a few people that I see really being a light for this generation and Zach is is up there in my books but brother I just want to say thank you so much for being with us today man thank you so much for having me on I swear your introductions I'm G to bring you everywhere from here on out uh just hire you to hang out with me just so that uh you can boost my ego and and uh and tell people about me yeah if that means we can travel together I'm in done deal so I know a lot about your story just one being a brother and just um knowing you reading your books too but um you got quite a story I know that you many years ago kind of went through a season where you were just kind of searching for answers and then you made this this journey to Australia so for people who don't know you don't know your story tell me a little bit about that and then just the transformation that took place like like on your way there and then after you kind of came back totally so I grew up in the church and I grew up seeing Miracle after Miracle uh my mom is a four-time cancer survivor and so just uh witnessing that and seeing God's goodness through it all for 15 18 years um really made an impact on who I am and and the way that I view the world um but then when I hit college and moved away I started falling away from my faith more and making my own uh decisions on things that might not be the best and I just started questioning a lot of things and when I was 24 I I hit a pretty low spot and I was like God I I know you're good and I know you're real but like prove to me that you're real like even more so now because I was struggling just with a lot of other Christians that I was surrounded by and just kind of with with who I was and what I wanted to believe and so I ended up moving out to Australia um to study in this program for nine months where it was like 12 hours a day six days a week so if we were studying Genesis for instance we would read Genesis five times in one week and that's like a 4-Hour read and then we would write our own commentary on it and so by the end of this program I had like 20 30 40 pages of notes and commentary on every single book of the Bible and my life was completely transformed I fell in love with scripture I fell in love with just the word and getting more people into it and I knew that a lot of people's lives would be transformed if they spent time studying the Bible but a lot of people that I knew aren't able to just get up and move across the world and so I started or I wrote this book called The Bible study and it basically holds your hand as you read through the entire Bible and uh it ended up doing really really well and growing into a pretty big product uh from there we created an uh e-commerce business publishing house uh that had a bunch of different products under it different books that I wrote and whatnot and we were just acquired about a year ago you had a transformative experience in Australia like you said you basically wrote your own commentary yeah and then you're like you probably had this idea like wow this could be really impactful for people you mentioned that like not everybody can come to Australia but we can probably create something that helps them in their walk so what was it like taking like having an idea but actually bringing it to life because I know that's a journey of itself totally I think my story has two different ways of approaching my story when people ask so we have the spiritual side of it but then we also have the entrepreneurial side of it so I started my first business when I was nine years old uh making shark tooth necklaces and selling them on the beach in Naples Florida and like crushing it as a nine-year-old and then like moving on I I had developed clothing lines and I co-owned a recording studio and I had written books and so I was doing all of that prior to Australia and so it was kind of just ingrained in me that if I saw a problem or a need for something I would find a solution to fulfill that that need and so uh it was just kind of a natural thing uh when I got back from Australia I was really praying about it figuring out what I should do if I should move back out there if I should teach or or whatnot and I God gave me a full-on vision for this book called The Bible study I like saw the logo the layout and I immediately knew like the plan of attack on how to approach it and so I spent the next nine months taking all my notes distilling them down uh writing them into what became the Bible study then I spent three months designing it and so by January of 2017 it was like ready to go but it was a file on my computer because I never published a book before successfully i' never like printed thousands of copies or anything and so I kind of just sat on it for a little bit and I started telling people about it and then people just started giving me money like here's $5,000 build a website here's 2500 bucks print some promotional copies like here's 200 here's 500 and I was like man I really might be on to something here and so we launched a kick starter campaign in June of 2017 and we ended up doing $24,000 in pre-orders in 30 days and I was like oh man we're going to print for sure and so I ordered a thousand copies I hadn't even thought about like working in shipping costs for all of the books that I just sold and so immediately I was losing money when we first came out with it and it was like you know those are just the things that you run into and figure out as you as you're starting a business and so uh launched that book officially and it didn't do really well right away and I was like man we just had this successful campaign why like what's the disconnect here and I felt like God was saying that my heart was in the wrong place with it and so I had this like come to Jesus moment essentially where I was like all right what do I actually feel called to do um what is my purpose in life and how can I how can I rethink and rework what I'm currently working on and when I made that switch when I made that realization that's when everything began to kind of take off and I ended up building out a team and over the course of four years um we grew substantially and we hit uh 63rd fastest growing business in America and number uh four fastest growing consumer product in America uh like in a non-Christian uh section like bro that blows my mind I can't even believe it like and yes we put in the work but I think God is the one that really uh pours on the water and makes the seed grow so it's it's our job to to sew the seed and it's his job to make it grow yeah that's crazy I had it down the 63rd fastest growing business in America you already mentioned fourth fastest growing consumer product and then third fastest in in Minnesota which just crazy numbers so yeah what tell me a little bit digging a little bit more so you kind of one of my questions was like what are some of the challenges you face and how did you push through but sounds like you like had this great idea you felt like it came from the Lord then you just launched it and like probably like crickets but how did you really dig in to to find out like what's really your calling because I think people whether they realize it or not we're constantly trying to figure out like what's our identity what are we what are we here for for yeah tell me a little bit about how you reach that and then just the fruit that came from yeah like finally stepping into your calling I think it's a combination of things and I think in the Christian space a lot of people get it wrong because they just say oh I'm just waiting on God to tell me what I'm supposed to do and then they sit on the couch and they're lazy and instead of actually going out and pursuing things that they're passionate about or that they feel like they can make an impact with and I think often times God is just saying I've given you the tools like get up and just do it and and so I think there's definitely that so look at uh what you're passionate about look at spiritual gifts that you have look at uh the experiences that you have what lights you up and then how do you take all of that and then bring God into it and expand the kingdom in some way and it doesn't have to mean that you're doing a Christian business or anything you could be selling toothbrush es but you could be selling the toothbrushes with Excellence you could have be having conversations with your co-workers there's ways to work in the Christian aspect of it uh it doesn't have to be you don't have to be a Christian toothbrush salesman you can just be a really good toothbrush salesman and I think that's also where a lot of people get it wrong they're like oh well I'm gonna be a plumber but I'm gonna be a Christian plumber and it's like no no no no just be a really good plumber and like you don't have to like push your faith on people people I think just by the way that you live your life uh they're going to be able to see that something's different with you and then allow them to ask questions about it and so when it comes to figuring out like yeah what your purpose what your calling is is like look at what you what lights you up look at how you can impact the world around you for Jesus and look at look at what God has already placed in your life because that's what's going to really uh build the kingdom but if I just made this whole podcast up just to like get a Consulting session with you that answer is like okay that's you know we talked earlier on a personal level of like you know I'm thinking about the next chapter in my life too but that that that's such a great encouragement for us of just like you know what are the things that you feel like really light you up I love that yeah yeah and if you're doing a toothbrush company I I go back to the first Home Alone where he's asking is this approved by the American Dental Association yeah just make sure that that's that's part of it right I love it yeah so uh a lot of the audience I think that is listening in are you know e-commerce owners so they're probably at various stages there's some that are like maybe not even launched yet some that are like a couple years in and some that are probably season doing really well but what would be your advice to share you know you've had a very God blessed very successful uh company that you built from scratch and and then kind of launched it tell me what some advice would be for those people I think knowing that everything takes much longer than you expect it to like I expected major success right away and that's and we all do because we see people on social media that are like oh they're an overnight success and it's like man if my business doesn't pop off after six months then maybe I'm supposed to be doing something different maybe God isn't behind it and I don't think that's the case at all I think there's like something really special in the um um in one step at a time doing something every single day and growing slow because that's going to have a much stronger Foundation than just a super rise to fame overnight um that's of often not sustainable and so focusing on that compound uh interest really of like okay I'm going to do a little bit every single day and I know that I'm working towards something really special and so sticking with it even through all of the hard times I mean there were there's been many many times dozens of times over the last 15 years where I've like wanted to give up or stop working on something and as an entrepreneur it's our tendency to want to jump to the next thing because it's like we're always wanting to be creative and I I think that that's a blessing and a curse because it often sets us back and we we don't continue uh on with something even though we should and so um I would say I would say that's uh one of the biggest things that I've been thinking about lately yeah that's so good I mean you could just right maybe that's your next book of just being a finisher yeah makes well I know that's that's probably one of the biggest struggles I face as a creative and a and a um entrepreneur is have a really great IDE get idea get really fired up and then you know you you deal with the struggle and it's really hard to to be a finish 100% And I think I dealt with that a lot last year where it was like man I just want to be creating new products I don't want to do all of the like day-to-day work and that's where it comes to hiring the right employees and so if you're just starting out in e-commerce hire people that are going to take off like whatever is taking up most of your time that's taking you away from new stuff like hire out those areas we had hired out five people over the years and our uh our last hire was a COO to run the entire organization um on my behalf essentially which allowed me to be creative and focus on the things that I really wanted to focus on but he also put our Reigns on me and pulled me back when I was going too far out too far left too far right and was able to remain focused on the task at hand and that was building the brand Sunday and so uh and then but now like we were acquired so so now it's I'm starting fresh so if you're just thinking through e-commerce ideas I feel you I'm in that mode right now where it's like you have all of these different ideas and quite frankly a lot of them could be really great ideas but until you actually just pick one and focus on it and spend all of your time and attention on one thing for an extended period of time you aren't going to be able to vet it out to see if it's actually going to work and be a success for you and so uh yeah I I get it tell me this really wasn't on my my list of questions but uh I'd like to hear just what the acquisition process was like because I think a lot of people obviously they're really passionate about something but they also like either have other ideas that they're working on and that's I feel like nobody really covers that maybe it's like a taboo conversation but yeah you know there's probably a lot of people listening there that have thought about that have no clue what it's like tell me just what your experience has been with it yeah I think it's so important to pick the right partners and so I had been working with uh Baker publishing as a distributor for the the previous year so uh they had sales channels that I didn't have access to so as an e-commerce business we built direct to Consumer for everything so it literally like pretty much one for one was like 90% of our sales and we didn't even do like any bulk orders and so we we were like man there's so many sales channels that we don't have access to so we need to pick the right team for that and so we chose the baker Bethany House team uh for helping distribute the book A year prior and built a great relationship with them and we really saw that that if we work together we could take this thing to a whole another level and so when it came down to it it was like who uh if if I wanted to jump into something different I wanted to open up uh to some new options and business was running smoothly at that point and so it was like man if if they uh purchased our assets so we did a asset purchase agreement so they uh they purchased um our assets as well as our IP for most of our products and then essentially um they take all of the products into the W their warehouse handle all the Fulfillment and then now I just create new products for them uh once or twice a year that will still be under name the brand Sunday um but I also have the flexibility to go out and do my own thing and uh but still like really great relationship with them there and so some people when you go through an acquisition uh it'll be a full acquisition where it's literally like buying your staplers and everything else like all inclusive and in that case most of the time all your staff will stay on you'll stay on as CEO for a few years um depending on what the contract ends up being uh but in my case it wasn't so you got to keep your stapler yes my stapler was mine it was probably like a special gift that someone bought you too there's pros and cons to to both sides both ways of doing everything I think so much of business is based on like what works best for you um what do you feel like can leave the greatest impact and that's really what it's about when you're an entrepreneur is how can I leave an impact on the world and as a Christian entrepreneur it's how can I leave an impact uh in regards to the kingdom and uh better the people around me yeah well and you definitely do that that's a great segue so I think you're human so I know you have bad days and I know you get frustrated like the rest of us but as I mentioned kind of early on you you're definitely one of those people that really light up the room that you're in the podcast that you're on the stage that you're speaking on the books the pages that you're filling up you cannot turn on any kind of like social media platform TV and just be overwhelmed with the bad news that's that's before us every single day there's Wars sure there's inflation and then for these business owners you know they're dealing with the same not only the external news but also just the things that you would face as running a business so tell tell us and tell uh the audience um how can we continue to see the good in our lives I think the biggest thing is if you focus on the bad the bad is going to grow in your life if you focus on the good the good is going to grow and so maybe that means you you do an audit on what you're consuming I'm a huge advocate for that is like man if every time that I log on social media I'm I leave feeling worse because of either the people's posts that I saw the news that I saw well you have the ability to unfollow people that's like the cool thing about us having choices you know and I feel like it's such a weird thing that most people just don't and they're like oh if I'm like I follow them so I'm going to just continue following them even if it makes me feel bad after looking at their posts why like set yourself up for Success from the beginning of the day to the end if there's things in your life that pull you away from God or make you upset or ruin your day then it should be your job or your goal to get rid of those and replace them with something that is more positive in your life and I understand that that's easier said than done for a lot of people's situations but I think if we start with the small stuff it really compounds into the bigger stuff as well and so if if in the morning uh you you get upset about one small thing I think it just grows and your mindset is going to be focused on the the small stuff throughout the day but if you start yourself out with uh in a very successful way then you're going to be good the rest of the day and so yeah realizing that a lot of bad things do happen in the world and not like neglecting that by any means but just coming to the understanding that yeah a lot of things in life are tough but what am I doing and how how is God using me to make things better and if you focus on that and and know that that's where your purpose is I think that's where you're going to feel really fulfilled in life perfect I was just about to talk about fulfillment so a big part of this podcast is is really you we do talk about e-commerce and fulfillment and all those things but it's really this this Mission and this heartbeat to help others um gravitate towards a life that is truly fulfilled so big big question but what is being fulfilled look like for you personally I feel like being used by God and knowing that you're leaving a positive Legacy behind so I've been thinking a lot about Legacy lately I never had before but I think it's really cool that you can leave something behind to your kids or or to the Next Generation and if you leave a positive impact on the world I think you can sleep better at night than uh than somebody that's just trying to take from the world and I think that God blesses us substantially in order to give more to others so if we if we're blessed we should be a blessing to others so if we can make the world a better place I think there's so much fulfillment in that and uh yeah I'm I'm a big advocate of figuring out what your purpose is how you can impact the world positively for uh for Jesus and from there your life is going to feel great so good so good love it man all right so if you we're kind of getting close to wrapping it up so a couple of fun questions I think so you've launched a wildly successful company you've authored some of the most life-giving books we've kind of been talking about around that message but see the good it's such a good book I love just how like I think you did a great job of just like I know Zach uh your personality in real life but I feel like it translates really well to the book so if people don't have that they should definitely pick that up but you're helping people grow in their Walk With Jesus um but I also know you can't help with coming up with new ideas so what is what's at this point what's the next chapter looking like for you personally 100% so I'm I'm pushing this course right now that I think would be an absolute Game Changer as I was starting out it's called learn the Bible in five weeks and it basically goes through the entire Bible from a big picture perspective over the course of five weeks like an hour a week uh split into like three to four videos so it's really easy uh to consume and if you have that your foundation is set up for any in the future so um uh really believeing that's going to impact a lot of lives right now and then in 2024 we're doing actually this might come out in 2024 but uh I'm I'm going to be walking people through reading the entire Bible um on like through social media so we're starting uh in January and February so we're starting January 6th we're going through I have a new Bible study coming out called New Testament Made Easy and it's a 60-day study through the New Testament so we're starting with that and then we're going to read the entire Old Testament over the course of the next uh nine months and then we're finishing December we're going to recap uh reading through Matthew for the whole month because I think if you really want to understand who Jesus is and what he said you have to um you have to understand the Old Testament and what he uh grew up uh being taught and so um that's that's my plan right now is is the course and then read through the entire Bible next year in a in a big uh hopefully with a with a big group of people yeah I love that yeah I'm just going to believe that the the people come the right ones come yes so thank you uh another fun question so U I know that I own a lot of domains I can't help it yeah yeah how many how many domains do you think that you own that's a man I think I only own like three right now but last night last night I was like oh I need to buy this domain really quick and so I need to do that this morning yeah it's funny because maybe I'm just the one with the problem I'll tell my wife about something and she's just like babe like you're never gonna use [Music] [Laughter] that that's so funny a $10 a $10 purchase is is not too bad yeah yeah and then you're set up you you locked it in it's security that's right at at least own it for a year yeah so all right another thing is social media I think is is still very intimidating for most business business owners one they probably don't have the time but I think you you've done a really good job of just managing it but I think where where I think you've done a phenomenal job is you just it always feels like it's you and it's your personality and it's very authentic and real which we know the the landscape of social media can often feel the opposite of that yeah so for for business owners that are just like that's another Another World all together what would be just some like advice on on the social media front man I think it's the most important thing that you could focus on we built our entire business through social media and today my entire business is built off of social media it's uh free access to the people that actually want your content which is like incredible you can't get free anywhere and so I think uh being able to provide value to your audience in a real and authentic way and not try to sell that's what makes people succeed quickly on social media uh but as an e-commerce business or or or any any business for that matter we're always focused on how can I promote a product how can I show people my product but like yo I'm not going to follow a toothbrush company and and like a picture of their new toothbrush but if a dentist was on saying how uh a certain toothbrush actually uh was better for your teeth or like here's three ways to take better care of your mouth that I might be interested in versus like I don't care if this toothbrush is taken in front of like a green screen like it's not that cool and and often as businesses we're always just trying to share what we're doing instead of really looking at the needs of the consumer and providing them value uh without asking for anything in return and I think we can definitely go through like Sprints of posts where we're posting uh and trying to sell but it shouldn't be our all the time thing it needs to be value value value at least every four post uh before you ever talk about your actual product that's such good wisdom too and I've I've I've been a business owner for about eight eight or nine years now and that was always my thing too like I don't I'm not I don't want to sell I think it's the best way to sell is not to sell at all yeah 100% totally and uh I remember there were some times too like I would I'm naturally I'm like a non-confrontational person and so I I'm always just trying to give people like the way a way out so I would have this like great pitch and then at the end was like but hey like if I'm not the right fit I'll introduce you to a team that like it would be the right fit and yeah yeah and I was like people used to give me a hard time but I was like I think that more often than not that was the reason why I got the job 100% they were just they were just like he's just he's not trying to sell me's just trying to help me out so totally and like we're all here for the same purpose to like make the world better for Jesus and so if we can focus on that it doesn't matter like that your product is doing better than others um I think it's so cool when like churches will will be like hey we have a Christmas service but here are 10 other churches in the city that we think are doing really great things as well so if we aren't right for you go check one of them out and it's really having that perspective of like man I just want you to grow I don't I don't care if necessarily if you're take if you're buying from me but you're actually growing yourself yeah man that's awesome that's some great great wisdom all right just two more um we haven't talked about this but I know that you're also a foodie yeah um and we are in the midst of the holiday season so what what's your go-to meal or dessert oh man my go-to meal or dessert so I make this I'm I'm cooking it on Wednesday so we have a small group coming over to our house on Wednesday at this new church that I'm part of and I'm cooking my favorite meal right now to cook I feel like it changes frequently but this is what I'm doing Tuesday night I'm beginning to make a cheesecake based off of uh of a cheesecake from New York that I think is incredible with this sponge crust and then I'm doing a French pureed potato with a flank steak uh asparagus wrapped in Pudo with a cowboy butter on top and I think it's gonna I think it's GNA be a a crowd pleaser but I'll I'll let you know on Thursday dang I hope people aren't listening to this around lunchtime kill them it's not even lunchtime and I could eat that right now I know man it sounds so good well you can tell you're passionate about that for sure I love it it's yeah I feel like food experiences really light me up so whether that's me cooking for friends and family or uh bringing somebody to a new restaurant and just watching their face light up when when they try something that I think is incredible that makes me happier than uh almost anything else yeah well it's so I honestly wasn't planning on talking about this but I uh there's an old you know old saying it's like a way to a man's heart as his stomach but yeah I I was always just so um you know observing of how many times like before Jesus or the disciples like shared the gospel that there was a a mill involved you know it's like always it's just yeah it's just so cool how that is and I think that's in and of itself an opportunity for Ministry and relationship too 100 per. yes I couldn't agree more so I uh I love I love you so much as a brother as a friend um and I I have no doubt that people like listening to this podcast are going to feel a connection feel that you really care so have I have no doubt that people are going to want to buy the book or just stay in touch with you in general so what's the best way for people to to stay in touch with Zack Wendall uh mainly Instagram and Tik Tok uh otherwise Zack wall.com got everything there uh if you DM me the word book on Instagram you'll get access to everything you'll uh find out where to buy it and I threw in some bonuses as well so start with that well brother man thank you so much for being on with us today and and for everybody listening thank for being a part of another episode on fulfilled and we just hope you have a blessed day thank you man it's an honor.\n\nâ\n\nhey friends we're back with another episode of the fulfilled podcast this time we welcome Casey schultes the founder and front man of he would love first here how a simple answer to a famous question would birth a movement with today's generation stick around this is one episode you won't want to miss all right man before we get too uh too much into the details I know that you guys are expecting your first so tell me at this moment What's going through your head oh man very excited very nervous scared just um I think I'm I'm really close to my sister and brother-in-law and they have you know a I think almost two-year-old and we've got to be really close to them and so just seeing like how amazing having a child is like I don't I don't know if there's anything better so I'm super excited and you know a little backstory as well is we um actually went through a miscarriage um beginning of last year and so I think you know when you first find out that your wife's pregnant it's like what does this mean and I you can't even like wrap your mind around it and then I think that going through that type of loss was like I don't know it gave you a whole different perspective on like what it means when you know there's a little person growing in in your wife's womb and just craziness of of life so I'm so excited we're so thankful and pregnancy is hard not for me but for my my wife you know and so um it's been a long journey but like obviously especially like I said when you go through you know a miscarriage um you're so thankful for the all the Pains of pregnancy because it means that you know you're it's it's it's happening so super excited Super thankful and just yeah so excited what's the countdown we've got March 8th is the due date um gotta figure out a name okay baby boy so we had like three girl names ready ready to roll and then we I was a boy and we're just like I got nothing so we got we got to figure that out a lot of pressure I have issues you know ordering my coffee making a decision on that so picking a name is GNA be tricky well you just think about in the future when he orders his cup of coffee from Starbucks or whever what's gonna be the name on to see that's what I gotta think about those things that's right maybe just do some mockups and just see what what look right so exactly I I've I had the pleasure of knowing you for a little while uh I'm I'm I love your story I'm a big story guy and just to hear how you know God took you down this path probably unexpected path that you were kind of set out to do but for for those that haven't heard your story you are a founder of he would love first to tell me go go back to the beginning and just tell me um how that happened and where that took shape yeah crazy crazy it's almost seven eight years now um yeah I I played soccer Georgia State I had a lot of um friends from overseas obviously um a lot of soccer players come from you know different countries and stuff to play and so I remember a specific time in school you know as a Christian on a on a sports team in locker rooms and stuff you're always trying to work in conversations about the gospel and how do you do that and things like that um but I remember one specific week there were like some hate preachers on campus that were you know yelling at my teammates in between class and stuff and in the locker room they're all talking about it and what they were saying and just terrible things um and then that same week uh I was wearing a wwjd bracelet and one of the guys asked um what is my wwjd bracelet stand for and I grew up in the Bible Bell everyone knows what wwjd is so I was like caught off guard like stand for what would Jesus do you know and I could see his mind kind of churning like is that is that it you know like I don't know what you do you know and I thought he was gonna ask me what would what would Jesus do you know like keep going and uh so in my head I was like how do I just kind of lead in into the gospel like what Jesus did while we were still Sinners you know he loved us when we couldn't love him um he bridged that Gap sin separated us you know so I'm just trying to Quick you know what am I going to say he didn't ask the question but I kind of left like seems like I grew up my whole life hearing you know what would Jesus do or seeing that that bracelet or question whatever but it hasn't necessarily had anything um hasn't really been used to like maybe start a conversation about the people or with the people that don't necessarily know what Jesus did and what the cross is and what the cross means and while we were still sinners Christ died for us um because of his great love for us you know and so um we were like maybe we could start conversations with the people around us just with that simple you know reality and so we had a couple bracelets made and like started passing them out um teammates classmates things like that and we were actually able to like really start conversations you know like Point people back to the Cross um and it was super cool like all of a sudden we were getting these conversations that we would try and you know get into um were coming like more naturally and so we're like let's maybe we should get more bracelets you know and so we we ran with that a little bit and it just kind of kept you know progressing and so we kind of realized we had something to run with and so that's you know kind of turned it into make clothes you know so it's obviously on the mission to kind of start conversations through clothing and bracelets and things like that um to point people back to the cross and um so conversation and use what was a famous bracelet movement for you know in the of use that huge platform that's already there to just point people back to the cross and U talk about you know what he did while while we were Sinners so well that story never get crazy uh yeah it's been it's been a journey you know so but it's been fun so this is an assumption but I'm I'm guessing you're so you're play soccer at Georgia State right and I'm guessing at that point you had limited knowledge on the manufacturing process and then seven or eight years ago I mean now you could whatever you want you could go find it online on uh find a manufactur it's it's a a lot easier now to go and and Source the things that you need but tell me what was that like when you're like hey I have this idea to make this BRAC tell me yeah what was that like for you and how how hard was it to accomplish what you were looking for yeah um yeah and it's what's kind of cool about the stories too is like I was never or like I wasn't really like this is a good business idea and like let's go see what our margins are and what's our go to market strategy and things like that like I said it was like this would be really cool I don't know if anyone's ever used the bracelets like this you know what would it look like how much would it cost um and so yeah just started searching online funny story honestly I looked for 15 minutes excuse me and um couldn't find anyone and I was like cool whatever like this fun idea and um my mom my mom kept looking and find found a manufacturer that could customize these bracelets and so she found she's like hey let's talk to these people and I was like all right I guess I will do it so it would have been done 15 minutes in if my mom hadn't kept looking but yeah just kind of looked online you know just Googling like crazy for 15 minutes till my mom did it but um yeah no idea about any manufacturing and what that looks like um just Dr Goo searching around thank God for the moms right they don't give up on us exactly so well um this is random did are you have you switched manufacturers since that day um yeah well I think we have I think that it came to a point where we had to say like hey we need a little bit something different and they were like you know I mean maybe six months in they're like we know another manufacturer that does similar but can you know do what you're looking for but since then yeah we've been with the same manufacturer for the longest time sozy it's pretty crazy like I've been yeah with them for a while so I've been in the creative space that's been kind of my career path as you know graphic designer eventually become creative director and then owning a creative agency at one point um and it it's it J changes the the older that you get but you know when I see my work out in the public it's still is kind of like oh I think it's sweeter for me now as a dad I'm like hey Daddy got to work on that you know like there's we rebranded a big uh logistics company we'll be you know six hours away and I'll see that logo that I you know worked on painstakingly like driving down the interstate so it's really cool but um I I see your bracelets everywhere now like I I'm still I'm not just doing this for the podcast I rock mine here um but like going through like Chick-fil-A I'll see somebody rocking it and I think about you all the time tell me what is it like uh personally but even like spiritually um what is it like seeing seeing your stuff in the wild yeah I mean it's still it still has that like surreal feeling because I mean as you know like I was there when we were licking envelopes and like had no idea writing everyone's address and trying to figure out what it looks like to ship things and just from the very beginning um and so seeing it now I just like I still have that picture of the first the beginning and so it's still just like unreal you know like proof that like God has his hand in it because it's not like you pick some guys that are some marketing or business gurus like literally we had no idea so proof that we it wasn't like some skill or knowledge that we had we just kind of were available so just available for what guy wanted to do right yeah yeah so but yeah super super surreal still when I see it so um any big names that you know of rocker gear um I think Tim TBO wore it for a while we were pumped about that I'm a Georgia fan but I'm still AO fan but um I think I think Justin Bieber had the bracet on for a little bit we have a picture of that yeah um Lauren dagel I know she wore it for a little bit maybe still wears I don't know yeah but we've seen a couple a couple pop up you're like wow that's crazy pretty cool huh they came across it yeah so that's awesome so uh more on the business side as a e-commerce um founder business owner what would you say you know seven eight years in what's been the the most challenging part of running the business and what's been the most rewarding the most challenging part I would say I mean I guess just kind of like I said like we had we had no idea it's not like we were like okay here's what we have to do and then and just go do it all it was like you're figuring out what you have to do as you're doing it you know like I growing up you know I played soccer and I you know focused on school and so it was like I have to show up at this time and I have to run these Sprints I have to do this drill or I have to study this and it's all in front of you um and you you still have to apply yourself you know to Crazy levels and work really really hard but then if you just took out like you have to figure out what you have to do and now like figure it out and do it at a high level it was just like you know we lived in one of the guys like his parents let us like stay in their basement and like fulfill everything out of their house and so we're just like living in this basement paying minimal rent trying to figure out you know like what do we do how do we what's the next step just talking to people um and so I think just kind of working that out just being like we don't know what we're doing we don't even know what this next step is but we're gonna we're just going to figure it out um so that kind of unknown of like this could very easily fail like we have no idea that this is a sure thing that's going to work out um might need to get a job next month who knows you know um so just those times of like man we don't we don't know what we're doing um and Keeping the Faith and like believing in like I believe in this I want to do it I'm going to apply myself work really hard and having that faith that you know it'll it'll work out and just learning every day so and then most rewarding I mean I think the fact that I mean it was four of us that started it all you know really good friends and then another friend of ours runs our social media and we knew her in in college and she we literally in college we're like we don't we're not really good at social media do you want to run it and so now she has a social media agency she's like continued in that so just growing it um as a friend group and a family and learning like I said going through that whole process of you know when when you're working with people and you don't know if you're getting paid and you know how what we're gonna be doing next month you know you got to have a good Bond if you have disagreements you got to figure out how to get over those disagreements quickly and so like we've learned how to fail together you know like we've learned how to have disagreements together and know what um what hill to die on and when to say like okay you can you you decide on this I'll decide on this and so now we can have disagreements on whatever it is but it's not a falling out you know we've already had too many times too many ups and downs together to to let some little disagreement be bigger than it should be so just growing with with people and seeing God take it um just use our availability to to run with it that's probably the most rewarding is um just that whole process with friends and family that's awesome there's two things that I kind of really took from that I love that you mentioned the girl that you went to college with you guys went to college with how you saw um kind of a gifting in her and how like it kind of goes back to that you know 15 minutes in you couldn't find a manufacturer but if it wasn't from your mom seeing like this Vision in you and it may not be here same way with this this young lady too like if you hadn't asked her that would she have this I mean maybe God would have brought her there anyway but it's cool just the progression of like hey I see this and this person can they help and now they're not only like doing a good work for you but they're also like fulfilling that thing that God put in them like early on so I love that and then love the just realization especially with your buddies like you know you hear like never going into business with your friends because it doesn't end well yeah but the fact that you guys have have sent hey is this really worth you know destroying what we have and what we've worked for so I love that and that's a uh I think a good segue so if you could speak back to casy seven years ago so I'm really thinking about people that are starting a new e-commerce business uh maybe they're about to start just start or maybe a few years in what what wisdom what's what were some nuggets that you would share with them today yeah um I mean be available you're gonna have to learn a lot you know you have to every I mean still today it's like you have to have the mentality of like I could learn something today that will make a huge impact you know on what we're doing what we're trying to do in every uh facet of business and stuff like that so if you think like oh I'm not ready I need to learn more before I can start you know stepping into things like you're you're never going to be ready you know I mean you'll probably be more ready than I was but um yeah you're gonna you're not going to feel ready you just have to start like taking steps and learning and making mistakes and learning from mistakes um yeah and then I guess as far as like team wise like they say don't go into business with your friends I think I mean people ask me now like if you could do it again like how would you have done it and and is it do you would you go into business with your friends and I mean it's easy now I guess because we went through those hard times and now we're at the the other side of it it's like yeah of course you know but I mean I really do like if we had failed we would failed together we would we succeeded we succeeded together and and we were in business with people it's like you know I I wouldn't change it you know I would I went to battle I wanted them to succeed as much as I wanted myself to succeed I wanted you know all my guys to to be able to do it full-time and be successful as much as I did you know and their families I'm close to their families and so you know picking people that like you want to fight for and you're okay with failing with you know like having times where like this is really hard they're going to have my back I'm gonna have theirs and that you know compliment you there things that you know one of my business partners Jared that he has skills that if I was in charge of our warehouse like it would be a disaster you know and maybe he would say vice versa if he was in charge of more product stuff it might not be as well you know whatever but we all have skills that kind of like complement each other um and so I think picking a team like that that you know it doesn't have to be your friend and it doesn't I don't think it doesn't have to not be your friend just go find someone random but having people it's like they compliment you and we're on the same Mission you know we believe the same things um and you know we love the Lord and that's we're brothers you know so um those are probably two big things like you got to be willing to apply yourself maybe like you've never applied yourself before and learn every single day and for me you know having a support group and a support system around you that you know you can Bounce from bounce back from failures and succeed with um and kind of you know keep you levelheaded and stuff like that so that's great wisdom I remember my wife and I went into business together and then we you know the there's a multiplication thing you have one kid then when you had we blinked and we had fours and my wife was a little more limited and then yeah I was really like looking for a partner at that point and a few of my friends that I would approach about partnership I think they were hesitant because they didn't want me to give away something unnecessarily and one asked like why why do you want me to come on and I said I just need somebody to like fight and grind with because it's it's a lot and doing that alone is a lot so hearing you speak to just having someone that has your back that can go through the ups and downs together that's that's huge so that's great wisdom so uh so he would love first what's uh what's the future look like for you guys yeah I mean again like I said we're still learning still trying to figure out you know tons of stuff every day in the direction things like that I think the last two years has been like you know we're growing we're figuring out you know where we're at and what we're really trying to do and and nail down our strategy and a bunch of stuff that we feel like you know we've grown quickly and now we're just like okay let's figure figure out how we can you know have our model that's not you know necessarily has to grow at a certain rate um and you know who can we partner with who can we um Ministries that we can do you know more work with and then how can we expand and add some um you know other other brands alongside what we're doing you know we've gotten to a point we've been able to delegate a lot of roles to our warehouse managers and Warehouse team that just crush it um help us a ton so we're kind of like you know we've been doing this for seven years um are there kind of like sister brands that are similar but you know different um that we can we can step into and kind of grow um and then there are other people that we can help as well they're you know on the same Mission as us that we can kind of um give some of the you know Insight that we've learned if if there's like us seven years ago there's so many things that are just seem simple but you know we've just learned through trial and error that we could pass on to people who are in it right now so kind of Step stepping into you know maybe that coaching or not even coaching but just you know trying to help you know people in the same position that we were in that's another yeah great piece of wisdom there so that's awesome so we're getting closer to the end we have a big question that we like to ask everybody this is called the fulfilled podcast so what does uh being fulfilled look like for you I think um man that's a big question isn't it um I think being because what's hard about it is like sometimes you can feel not fulfilled because you want to grow and you want to learn and you have that mental you know all your life you're like today's the day I'm G to get better and all these things and also having that balance of like contentment like like I can look at where we are now and be like you know we could be doing this so much better and this so much better um but at the same time I can look back and be like gosh a year two years six years ago this would have been I wouldn't have been able to even imagine like how well this is going so having that perspective like contentment like Lord You've like provided for me in a way that I could I didn't even dream of um and balancing that like I'm I'm available and when it's time to step I want to step and I'm I'm I'm ready to work and you know put my nose down and but also having the balance of like if I never do anything else again and I have to give up and I just do something new with you and that's what you have for me I'm content with like how you've provided for me um I think that's a balance of you know fulfillment that I've had obviously just being able to do all that with family and and in community um but yeah sometimes it gets too lopsided you're like I'm ready to grind I'm ready to work I'm G to start five new things and the Lord will be like just slow down and realize how I've taken care of you but then if you get too content you know on the side of like he has something that he wants you to step into and you're not you know available kind of like the parable of the talents you know sometimes there's times that you're called to step and if if you're too lazy or whatever you want to call it then you might be missing out on you know something God has for you so I think having people in your life that um can speak into that and be like I think you know you you have the capacity to step into this or you need to pull back and you know spend more time you know with your family or whatever it may be um yeah that balance of just being like Lord search me know me tell me when to step and when to slow down um and just contentment and availability so that's so good and I resonate especially as a business owner entrepreneur I feel like I have five new ideas every day and as I've gotten older there's some Seasons where God's just like every door that I try he just shuts it down and thankfully he does before I get too far then yeah other Seasons it's just like he's just it's just like you can't move fast fast enough to you know exact exactly yeah to be that so and just I mean whether you're slowing down or speeding up like feeling like you're doing it with him and and you know being obedient like that's you know you could start something and fail but if you feel like you've done it with him and obedient um then you're GNA be fulfilled because that's the main thing so um you know for those that want to kind of keep up with he would love first and what you guys are doing what's what's the best way to do that um our Instagram is just at Hew would love first website is he first.com um and then my Instagram is Casey schultes 14 um so yeah those are the main the main ways awesome man well I know again as being in business you know how limited your time is um so I know you especially with the holidays you got a lot going on so just want to say thank you for being with us today opening up your heart and just sharing some goodness with us today dude thank you I always love talking to you so thanks for having me.\n\nTrust me you don't want to miss this whether you're starting out or scaling up buckle up for a ride filled with wisdom Innovation and a dash of humor let's dive into the fulfilled podcast where we explore the world of e-commerce and Beyond welcome today to the fulfilled podcast today I'm excited to introduce Matthew moano which is he's a CEO and founder of connective CRM but also checkout Champs and today I want to focus a little bit more on checkout Champs because there's a lot of lot of talk on the street about what's going on with checkout Champs and I want to also introduce because he's a husband a father and a new new grandfather is that what we were talking about before tell me about this this grandbaby grandfather the second time remember when your wife gave birth to your little daughter yep I think my son gave birth like two days later to our first granddaughter but we just had our first grandson on on November 30th oh that's beautiful I was telling you I was like he doesn't look like a grandfather but Matt awesome man that those are going to be some uh uh some really I guess spoiled grandkids um your grandkids they're going to be well trained let me just tell you that's right they're going to know how to shoot for sure that's right but I also want to introduce that that you you have been a loyal friend for a long time you're somebody I can turn to in in in times of you know um times where where're we're trying to figure out what's the next best thing that that we should focus on um and personally and and business-wise so I want people to know that there there's somebody that I've depend you're somebody I've depended on in the past and you've G given great advice um so that that's meant a lot to me and you're also you're an innovator you're an innovator of sass technology you're an innovator in the field you're an innovator in e-commerce and I'm always interested to find out what you're working on next because that's something the industry is going to feel so I I just want to thank you for coming on today and um I want to ask you I'm G to ask you a couple questions because I know our listeners want to know more about you because most of them have heard of your technology um and they might not always know the man behind the scenes but Matthew I want to kick it off and just ask in check out Champs how do you guys make your money well our money is made it's very much performance-based if our clients obviously we have a we have a base monthly subscription fee which covers the cost of the technology but uh transactionally as we help our clients scale we get a small a little small piece of of that that volume like very tiny small piece y um and so their success very much relates to Our Success so we're we have a vested interest in really helping them build the best fastest highest converting checkouts and upsells and Order bumps and subscription billing models that the industry has ever seen so it's really our success is tied to their success that's right and I ask that because people sometimes wonder it's like well how is this person making money from me and a lot of times if it's tied to Performance then there's a cooperation there right that's right well you know you look at big big publicly traded companies and I hate to throw out names like just look at big Commerce I'm not telling you anything that you know out of school here you can just look at their numbers they have never ever been profitable you know so how does a multi-billion dollar publicly traded company that does essentially the same thing we do operate with with no profit there has to be profit so you can continue to hire and and build new technologies and things of that nature and we've just we've kind of figured out the right way to do it that's right so there's a big advantage to not having that red tape not having to to really answer to um I guess people that that aren't in the day-to-day but maybe not car care about the clients as much as as we might so I'm I'm speaking from the fulfillment.com side is is I love the fact that um we're not publicly traded I I love the fact that we're founder Le right now well let me let me also mention I know you gave me a great lead in here let me also mention to those that are watching Justin is Awesome Justin I met in San Francisco probably 12 13 years ago standing up in like a hallway and we just kind of bumped into each other said look there's there's opportunity here to to win business and win together and and I think you're probably going to ask these questions later on but I think that's a big part of the business you find people that are aligned with you you know not just on the business side but also on the personal side and and there are ways to win where it's not just you but everyone collectively Rises to the top that's right that's what I felt when we it wasn't it wasn't just us going out in trying to make money it was us trying we're trying to build something that gave back something that um we could show add enormous value to somebody we're we're transacting with so absolutely man when we met it was just like okay there's something here let's pursue this this is great and of course we had both had a military background so that helps as well sometimes we we talk the same lingo when others are like Alpha brao Delta Char what but let me ask you so in your Tech yeah what's that Dar one Dar two D that's right that's right like what so um I just like that commonality you know with with people as far as military wise and and we missed the camaraderie that we had so when we run into somebody else you know that had that as well um it's just we're we're on the same page as far as the the way we think think about a lot of ways so yeah I mean I i' I've enjoyed our relationship ever since and my my goal here today is um I want people to know the real checkout champ the real match I want people to understand there's some things I know we put advertisements out there sometimes but when people actually see who's behind the scenes who's developing who's allowing Those ads to go out who's behind the technology is that somebody I'm going to trust is that somebody that I want to do business with because this is all this is all discretionary income we're giving out to the different service providers based on what they're telling us and what we're hearing in the marketplace and I know that that I hear not just directly from what I hear on on just people talking at trade shows and those sort of things but we've got a bunch of e-commerce clients that that talk they talk about different Technologies and I know that that connective has been tried and true it's been a technology that has lasted the times and when Matt told me about checkout Champs and he and he explored and showed me actually behind the scenes in checkout champ um I wanted to I wanted to Showcase that I wanted to show others that what what really they could be um uh connected to to be able to push their business to the next level so let me ask you what else do you guys I know you get that you've explained how you actually make money what do you guys give away for free what do we gave away for free well in most cases we'll give the first month away for free because when people talk about the fees they're like well you know it's probably expensive a lot of these guys are you know they're small businesses many cases they're just starting off you know even if they're running a 50,000 $100,000 $250,000 a month company you know adding that one additional layer of expense it does affect the bottom line so you know I I know what our product can do so I'll say come on in I'm I'll wave your first month we're going to have you up and running in a couple of days and you'll see for yourself your conversion rates are going to double or triple you're going to make more money your upsells are going to go through the roof and you're never going to question dollar one that you'll ever pay me test drive right take it for a test drive got it man so now developing checkout Champs though why was it really created I know you you've got connect you've got a successful CRM but why checkout champ now you know that's interesting it actually ties back to one of your clients that we it was a mutual client and he said hey I'm I'm using a couple these these e-commerce platforms and they really just don't have all the features that connective does and I said what would you want it to do and this is probably going back five or six years Justin yeah um it was another funnel building platform I know you know what it is I'm not going to say it out loud uh but I said you know I bet you we can build something like that we have the team so we actually started hiring more people it took a couple years about two and a half years to build it but what we found is it doesn't just build the sales funnel it is a full repace replacement to most e-commerce you know these big CMS platforms that you've heard of it replaces the checkout entirely and the entire experience post cart so if you're going to a store let's say you go to I don't know a hunting or outdoor store you're putting you know gloves and hunting pants and hats and stuff in the cart once you click proceed to checkout it it does a complete handoff from that cart to the checkout page which you now have 100 100% control and customization of it's single step you can use any Merchant processor you want because we have Integrations over 200 gateways from around the world any currency and you can control the the pre- purchase order bump the postp purchase one click up cells and all the way to the thank you page so you're controlling that entire consumer and you know that customer experience so in the days of like the AMZ Juggernaut right where there's loss of control you're giving back these internet retailers more control of Their audience more control of how they check out those sort of things that's correct that's awesome and then you're showing the data to be able to so they can actually make adjustments in Scale based on all the different split testing that you provide that they're they're capable in that system is that right yeah absolutely it's split testing you hit the nail on the head there which a lot of companies don't split test but the companies that do they're usually just doing ab split testing but if you have a bunch of variants that you want to test to see which one's the winner going from going doing ab ab ab all the way down the line online it takes forever to get to that that final decision we built four-way split testing in our platform I don't"
