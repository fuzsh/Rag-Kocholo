Rogue Wave Software announced today that it has acquired OpenLogic, Inc., the leading provider of cloud-based open source software management solutions, support, and consulting. Broomfield, Colorado-based OpenLogic offers a platform, OpenLogic Exchange (OLEX), which enables software development teams to leverage the breadth and innovation of open source software. In an effort to get higher-quality applications to market more quickly, developers increasingly combine their own custom code with both commercial frameworks and open source packages. The combination of Rogue Wave and OpenLogic creates an unparalleled partner for developers, enabling them to write better code, faster.

“Rogue Wave has a rich history of providing market-leading commercial frameworks and tools used by developers to build world-class applications,” said Brian Pierce, CEO of Rogue Wave. “With the acquisition of OpenLogic, we can be an even better partner in the application development process by enabling developers to complement their own custom code with leading commercial and open source tools and components. OpenLogic's world-class team, with its unrivaled open source expertise, is a tremendous addition to the Rogue Wave family.”

OpenLogic's OLEX platform was designed from its inception as a cloud-based SaaS solution. From their web browsers, developers can utilize OLEX to provision thousands of open source packages, set governance policies for the use of open source software, and scan their applications for open source code. Moreover, OpenLogic's open source expertise extends to enterprise-grade support for more than 850 open source packages, as well as training and consulting services designed to help customers optimize their implementation of open source software.

“Rogue Wave's size and market reach will be of tremendous value to OpenLogic's customers,” said Steven Grandchamp, CEO of OpenLogic. “The adoption of open source software is growing at an increasing rate, and Rogue Wave's customers now have a single vendor solution combining the open source usage with their commercial library usage.” The OpenLogic team will continue to provide customers with the same outstanding service and support that they have experienced in the past, but with the additional resources of a much larger organization.
