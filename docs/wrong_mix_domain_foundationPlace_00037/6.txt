Rogue Wave tools span 40 years, offering everything from cloud-based-services to native platform applications to portable software libraries. But they all have a common, singular purpose: Making it easy to write, test, and run complex code.

Our capabilities cover different languages, code bases, and platforms. Simply put, we meet development where – and how – it happens. Whether it's finding the right algorithm to forecast outcomes, building the foundation of C++ applications, debugging multi-threaded and multi-core software, understanding open source use in proprietary code, or discovering security bugs earlier in development, we can help. Code is where we live, what we care about, and how we make our customers' software better.

HydraExpress

HydraExpress™ provides a framework for developing and hosting high performance C++ web services, including advanced XML, SOAP, and WSDL. HydraExpress provides productivity tools for transforming new and existing C++ applications for use in service oriented architectures (SOA).

HydraExpress leverages crucial business logic locked within existing applications. HydraExpress enables you to create SOA applications that are flexible and interoperable - yet maintain the reliability and performance advantages of your core business logic.

Message formats in HydraExpress are based on the simple object access protocol (SOAP), a widely accepted, easy-to-use mechanism for transferring messages over a network.

HydraExpress developers simply supply a standard web services description language (WSDL) file and HydraExpress automatically generates a skeleton service that handles the details of protocols, standards, and networking to ensure interoperability. Developers then drop in new or existing C++ business logic to create a ready-to-deploy service that can be used in many types of SOA applications.
