The series has grossed over $3.36 billion worldwide. The first installment, Twilight, was released on November 21, 2008.[1] The second installment, New Moon, followed on November 20, 2009.[2] The third installment, Eclipse, was released on June 30, 2010.[3][4] The fourth installment, Breaking Dawn – Part 1, was released on November 18, 2011, while the fifth and final installment, Breaking Dawn – Part 2, was released on November 16, 2012.[5][6]\n\nThe series had been in development since 2004 at Paramount Pictures' MTV Films, during which time a screen adaptation of Twilight that differed significantly from the novel was written.[7][8] Three years later, Summit Entertainment acquired the rights to the film. After Twilight grossed $35.7 million on its opening day,[9] Summit Entertainment announced they would begin production on New Moon; they had acquired the rights to the remaining novels earlier that same month.[10] The films in the series have received generally negative to mixed reviews from critics.\n\nDevelopment\n\n[edit]\n\nTwilight was in development for about three years at Paramount Pictures' MTV Films, during which time a film adaptation differing significantly from the novel was written.[7][8] For example, the script transformed Bella into a star athlete. It was so different that Stephenie Meyer worried that she had made the wrong decision in selling the film rights to her novel. She said later, '\"They could have put that [earlier] movie out, called it something else, and no one would have known it was Twilight!\"\n\nWhen Summit Entertainment reinvented itself as a full-service studio in April 2007, it acquired the rights, seeking to create a film franchise based on the book and its sequels.[11][12] Erik Feig, President of Production at Summit Entertainment, guaranteed a close adaptation to the book.[13] Meyer felt that Summit was open to letting her be a part of the film.\n\nCatherine Hardwicke was hired to direct the film, and soon afterward, Melissa Rosenberg was hired to write the film.[14] Rosenberg developed an outline by the end of August, then worked on the screenplay with Hardwicke the following month. \"She was a great sounding board and had all sorts of brilliant ideas....I'd finish off scenes and send them to her, and get back her notes.\"[15] Because of the impending WGA strike, Rosenberg worked full-time to finish the screenplay before October 31.[15] In adapting the novel for the screen, she \"had to condense a great deal\", combining some characters and leaving others out.[16] \"[O]ur intent all along was to stay true to the book,\" Rosenberg explained, \"and it has to do less with adapting it word for word and more with making sure the characters' arcs and emotional journeys are the same.\"[17] Hardwicke suggested using voice over to convey the protagonist's internal dialogue,[15] since the novel is told from Bella's point of view; and she sketched some of the storyboards during pre-production.[18][19]\n\nHardwicke sought Meyer's feedback as she developed the movie; for example, the director phoned the author after changing a scene slightly. This surprised Meyer. \"I've heard the stories...I know it's not normally like that when you adapt a book.\" Meyer, a natural pessimist, was waiting for the worst but, instead, called her experience in the book's film adaptation \"the best I could have hoped for.\"[7][8]\n\nOriginally scheduled for release in December 2008, Twilight was moved to a worldwide release of November 21, 2008, after Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince moved from a November 2008 release to being released in July 2009.[1]\n\nCasting\n\n[edit]\n\nKristen Stewart was on the set of Adventureland when Hardwicke visited her for an informal screen test, which \"captivated\" the director.[7] Hardwicke did not initially choose Robert Pattinson for the role of Edward Cullen; but, after an audition at her home with Stewart, he was selected.[7] Robert Pattinson actually didn't enjoy playing his assigned character, Edward Cullen.[20] Meyer allowed Pattinson to view a manuscript of the unfinished Midnight Sun, which chronicles the events in Twilight from Edward's point of view.[21][22] Meyer was \"excited\" and \"ecstatic\" in response to the casting of the two main characters.[23] She had expressed interest in having Emily Browning and Henry Cavill cast as Bella and Edward, respectively, prior to pre-production.[24][25]\n\nPeter Facinelli was not originally cast as Carlisle Cullen: \"[Hardwicke] liked [him], but there was another actor that the studio was pushing for.\"[26] For unknown reasons, that actor was not able to play the part, and Facinelli was selected in his place.[26] The choice of Ashley Greene to portray Alice Cullen was criticized by some fans because Greene is 7 inches (18 cm) taller than her character as described in the novel. Meyer said that Rachael Leigh Cook resembled her vision of Alice.[27] Nikki Reed, who portrayed Rosalie Hale, had previously worked with Hardwicke on the successful Thirteen (2003), which they co-wrote, and Lords of Dogtown (2005).\n\nKellan Lutz was in Africa, shooting the HBO miniseries Generation Kill, when the auditions for the character of Emmett Cullen were conducted. The role had already been cast by the time the HBO production ended in December 2007, but the selected actor \"fell through.\" Lutz subsequently auditioned and was flown to Oregon, where Hardwicke personally chose him.[28]\n\nRachelle Lefèvre wanted a role in the film because Hardwicke was director; she saw \"the potential to explore a character, hopefully, over three films;\" and she wanted to portray a vampire.[29] \"[She] thought that vampires were basically the best metaphor for human anxiety and questions about being alive.\"[29] Christian Serratos initially auditioned for Jessica Stanley, but she \"fell totally in love with Angela\" after reading the books and took advantage of a later opportunity to audition for Angela Weber.[30] The role of Jessica Stanley went to Anna Kendrick, who got the part after two mix-and-match auditions with various actors.[31]\n\nBecause of major physical changes that occur in the character of Jacob Black between Twilight and New Moon, director Chris Weitz considered replacing Taylor Lautner in the sequel with an actor who could more accurately portray \"the new, larger Jacob Black.\"[32][33] Trying to keep the role, Lautner worked out extensively and put on 30 lbs.[34] In January 2009, Weitz and Summit Entertainment announced that Lautner would continue as Jacob in The Twilight Saga: New Moon.[35]\n\nIn late March 2009, Summit Entertainment released a list of the actors who would be portraying the \"wolf pack\" alongside Lautner. The casting for the rest of the Quileute people was headed by casting director Rene Haynes, who has worked on films with large Native American casts, such as Dances with Wolves and Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee.[36]\n\nIn mid-2009, it was announced that Bryce Dallas Howard would be replacing Rachelle Lefevre as Victoria for the third Twilight film, The Twilight Saga: Eclipse. Summit Entertainment attributed the change to scheduling conflicts. Lefevre said she was \"stunned\" and \"greatly saddened\" by the decision.[37] Jodelle Ferland was cast as the newly turned vampire, Bree.[38] Other new cast members for the third film include Xavier Samuel as Riley,[39] Jack Huston as Royce King II,[40] Catalina Sandino Moreno as Maria, Julia Jones as Leah Clearwater, and Booboo Stewart as Seth Clearwater.[38]\n\nProduction\n\n[edit]\n\nPrincipal photography for Twilight took 44 days,[41] after more than a week of rehearsals,[42] and completed on May 2, 2008.[43] Similar to her directorial debut Thirteen, Hardwicke opted for an extensive use of hand-held cinematography to make the film \"feel real\".[26][44] Meyer visited the production set three times, and was consulted on different aspects of the story;[45] she also has a brief cameo in the film.[46] To make their bodily movements more elegant, and to get used to their characters' fighting styles, the cast playing vampires participated in rehearsals with a dance choreographer and observed the physicality of different panthera.[26][27][47] Instead of shooting at Forks High School itself, scenes taking place at the school were filmed at Kalama High School[48] and Madison High School.[49] Other scenes were also filmed in St. Helens, Oregon,[50] and Hardwicke conducted some reshooting in Pasadena, California, in August.[41][51]\n\nIt is suggested that Edward drives a \"shiny\" and \"silver\" Volvo S60-R, a fast sleeper car that doesn't call attention to the Cullen family's wealth in the novel series. The film series partnered with Volvo to place a Volvo C30 in the 2008 Twilight film, feeling that the C30 better suited the persona of a 108-year-old vampire pretending to be a 17-year-old high school student. Volvo reported an increase in the sale of the C30 in the US market following the film's release, and helped change the perception of Volvo as a \"cool\" car in a younger generation of buyers. Volvo continued the cooperation through the series, placing a Volvo XC60 in New Moon and returning to the S60 in Breaking Dawn.[52][53]\n\nIn early November 2008, Summit announced that they had obtained the rights to the remaining books in Stephenie Meyer's Twilight series: New Moon, Eclipse and Breaking Dawn.[10] On November 22, 2008, one day after the theatrical release of Twilight, Summit confirmed that they would begin working on New Moon. Melissa Rosenberg had been working on adapting the novel prior to Twilight's release[54] and handed in the draft for New Moon during Twilight's opening weekend in November 2008.[55]\n\nIn early December 2008, it was announced that Twilight director Catherine Hardwicke would not be returning to direct the sequel. Hardwicke cited time restrictions as the reason behind her leaving the project.[56] Instead, Chris Weitz, director of The Golden Compass and co-director of American Pie, was hired to direct The Twilight Saga: New Moon.[57] Filming for New Moon began in Vancouver in late March 2009,[58][59] and in Montepulciano, Italy, in late May 2009.[60][61]\n\nIn early 2009, before the release of The Twilight Saga: New Moon, Summit confirmed that they would begin production on The Twilight Saga: Eclipse. Since Weitz would be in post-production for New Moon when The Twilight Saga: Eclipse began shooting, he would not be directing the third film.[62][63] Instead, The Twilight Saga: Eclipse was taken on by director David Slade, with Melissa Rosenberg returning as screenwriter.[64] Filming began on August 17, 2009 at Vancouver Film Studios[65] and finished in late October, with post-production beginning early the following month.[66] In April 2010, it was revealed that re-shoots of the film were needed. Slade, who previously said he would not be around for them, was seen, along with Stephenie Meyer, on set. The three main stars were also present.[67]\n\nWyck Godfrey, producer of the previous films in the series, stated in mid-2009 that they had every intention to make the film version of Breaking Dawn.[68] Following months of speculation and cast rumors,[69][70] it was officially announced on April 28, 2010, that Academy Award winner Bill Condon, who directed Gods and Monsters and Dreamgirls, would direct Breaking Dawn; producing the film will be Wyck Godfrey, Karen Rosenfelt and author Stephenie Meyer. \"I'm very excited to get the chance to bring the climax of this saga to life on-screen. As fans of the series know, this is a one-of-a-kind book – and we're hoping to create an equally unique cinematic experience,\" said Bill Condon. A November 18, 2011 release date has been set for the first part, while the second is scheduled for release on November 16, 2012.[6][71][72] Following that statement, on June 11, 2010, Summit officially confirmed that a two-part adaption of the fourth book would start production in the fall.[73] With this announcement, it was made clear that all major actors, including the three lead roles, the Cullen family and Charlie Swan, would return for both parts.[73] Bill Condon was also confirmed to direct both parts.[73]\n\nIn order to keep the budget on both parts of Breaking Dawn reasonable, which would be substantially greater than the previous installments in the series, filming in Louisiana was also negotiated, providing larger tax credits for the studio to benefit from.[5]\n\nFilms\n\n[edit]\n\nFilm U.S. release date Director(s) Screenwriter(s) Producer(s) Twilight November 21, 2008 Catherine Hardwicke Melissa Rosenberg Greg Mooradian, Mark Morgan and Wyck Godfrey The Twilight Saga: New Moon November 20, 2009 Chris Weitz Wyck Godfrey and Karen Rosenfelt The Twilight Saga: Eclipse June 30, 2010 David Slade The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn Part 1 November 18, 2011 Bill Condon Wyck Godfrey, Karen Rosenfelt and Stephenie Meyer The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn Part 2 November 16, 2012\n\nTwilight (2008)\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Twilight (2008 film)\n\nTwilight was directed by Catherine Hardwicke and written by Melissa Rosenberg.

Everybody else, get ready for a bizarre soap opera/pageant, consisting of a succession of static scenes with characters loping into the frame to announce exactly what they're thinking.\"[125] Roger Ebert gave the film 1 star out of 4 and said that it \"takes the tepid achievement of Twilight, guts it, and leaves it for undead.\"[126] The release of the movie has also inspired feminist criticism, with Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly making light of the claim that Edward Cullen is little better than a stalker.[127] In any case, the influx of female viewers into the theaters indicates the increasing importance of the female demographic in dictating Hollywood's tastes.[128]\n\nThe Hollywood Reporter posted a positive review of The Twilight Saga: Eclipse, saying the film \"nails it\".[129] Variety reports that the film \"finally feels more like the blockbuster this top-earning franchise deserves\".[130] One review stated the film was the best in The Twilight Saga so far, acknowledging that, \"The person who should be worried is Bill Condon, the director tapped for the two-part finale, Breaking Dawn. He's got a real challenge to make movies as good as Eclipse.\"[131] A.O. Scott of The New York Times praised David Slade's ability to make an entertaining film, calling it funny and better than its predecessors, but pointed out the acting hasn't improved much.[132]\n\nA more negative review said that while \"Eclipse restores some of the energy New Moon zapped out of the franchise and has enough quality performances to keep it involving\", the film \"isn't quite the adrenaline-charged game-changer for love story haters that its marketing might lead you to believe. The majority of the 'action' remains protracted and not especially scintillating should-we-or-shouldn't-we conversations between the central triangle.\"[133] Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun Times gave the film a more positive review than for the first two films in the saga, but still felt the movie was a constant, unclever conversation between the three main characters. He criticized the \"gazes\" both Edward and Jacob give Bella throughout the movie, and noted that the mountain range that appears in the film looks \"like landscapes painted by that guy on TV who shows you how to paint stuff like that.\" He also predicted that a lack of understanding for the film series in general would not bode well with the audience, stating, \"I doubt anyone not intimately familiar with the earlier installments could make head or tails of the opening scenes.\" He gave the film 2 stars out of 4.[134]\n\nBreaking Dawn – Part 1 received mostly negative reviews from critics. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 25% of critics (of the 207 counted reviews) gave the film a positive review, and the site's consensus reads \"Slow, joyless and loaded with unintentionally humorous moments, Breaking Dawn Part 1 may satisfy the Twilight faithful, but it's strictly for fans of the franchise\".[135] Part 2 had a mixed critical reception but was much more favorable than Part 1.[136] Richard Roeper said that \"The fifth and final entry in the historically successful Twilight franchise is the most self-aware and in some ways the most entertaining\", giving it a grade C+.[137]\n\nFilm Rotten Tomatoes Metacritic CinemaScore Twilight 49% (5.4/10 average rating) (200 reviews)[138] 56 (38 reviews)[139] A−[140] The Twilight Saga: New Moon 29% (4.8/10 average rating) (231 reviews)[141] 44 (32 reviews)[142] A−[143] The Twilight Saga: Eclipse 47% (5.5/10 average rating) (256 reviews)[144] 58 (38 reviews)[145] A[143] The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn – Part 1 25% (4.4/10 average rating) (212 reviews)[135] 45 (36 reviews)[146] B+[143] The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn – Part 2 49% (5.3/10 average rating) (200 reviews)[136] 52 (31 reviews)[147] A[148]\n\nHome media sales\n\n[edit]\n\nList indicator(s)\n\n(B) indicates the yearly rank based on the number of DVDs sold during the year released (calculated by The Numbers).\n\nFilm DVD release date Revenue (millions) Rank(B) Units sold Reference Twilight March 21, 2009 $203 #1 13,921,700 [149][150] The Twilight Saga: New Moon March 20, 2010 $222 #3 11,163,968 [151][152] The Twilight Saga: Eclipse December 4, 2010 $214 #5 12,110,823 [151][153] The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn – Part 1 February 11, 2012 $144 #5 7,516,651 [154][155] The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn – Part 2 March 2, 2013 $103 #4 6,992,227 [156] Total $886 51,705,369\n\nTwilight in popular culture\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2010, a parody film, Vampires Suck, starring Jenn Proske, Matt Lanter, and Chris Riggi, was released, its material largely based on Twilight and its sequel, The Twilight Saga: New Moon. Though the film was a critical failure, with Rotten Tomatoes critics giving it an approval rating of only 4%, it was a financial success, opening at number one in the United States and grossing more than $80,000,000 worldwide, against a $20,000,000 budget.[157][158] In 2012, another parody film, Breaking Wind, featuring a cast of unknown actors, was released straight to DVD by Lionsgate Home Entertainment.[159]\n\nIn 2010, the Teletoon original film My Babysitter's a Vampire, parodied the first 3 Twilight films as the 'Dusk' trilogy. There is a side plot that follows the main characters to a fan held premiere of 'Dusk III: Unbitten'. There is a Dusk fan club and the fans are called 'Duskers'. There are contentious references to the parodied series through its televised adaption.[160][161]\n\nThe successful animated film Hotel Transylvania briefly parodied the Twilight Saga, namely the scene in which Edward reveals his vampirism to Bella in the woods near Forks High School. The scene, which lasts only a few seconds, can be seen playing on an airplane TV as Count Dracula attempts to convince Jonathan to forgive him and come back to Hotel Transylvania.[162][163]\n\nIn 2019, Russian figure skater Alena Kostornaia used music from the Twilight and New Moon soundtracks for her free program. With this program, she later became the European champion, and was the favourite for the world title before the championship's cancellation in March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nRoswell\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
