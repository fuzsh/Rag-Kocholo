        "text": "In lieu of an abstract, here is a brief excerpt of the content:\n\nAine O'Healy Filming Female \"Autobiography\" Maraini, Ferreri, and Piera's Own Story I have always been very attached to family affections. Very attached, to an almost incredible extent. ..even though I knew that this family was completely in pieces. In my imagination \\ had to try to stick it back to­ gether, as if I were the one who could bind up this thing that was about to collapse, break apart. Piera degli Esposti, Storia di Piera Aa female coming­of­age film, Sto­ riadi Piera (1982)—the cinematicadaptation of Piera degli Esposti's autobi­ ographical reminiscences—belongs to an extremely small subgenre in the repertoire of Italian narrative cinema. This critically neglected film is ar­ guably the most provocative coming­of­age narrative to emerge in Italian cinema in the years immediately following the high point of the neofemi­ nist movement. It prompts a complex set of questions on femalesubjectiv­ ity, the cultural construction offemininity, and women's relationship to cre­ ativity, maternity, and discourses of the body. Simultaneously, however, the film's narrative structure problematizes the very representability of the \"female story.\" Storia di Piera was directed by Marco Ferreri, a controversial outsider among Italian filmmakers, and was based on a script written by Dacia Maraini, Piera degli Esposti, and Ferreri himself. Accordingto the credits in the film's opening sequence, Storia diPiera is adapted from a novel by Piera degli Esposti and Dacia Maraini. This is a rather surprisingclaim, since the text upon which the film is actuallybased—a 136­page volume ofthe same title published by Bompiani in 1980—is not a novel, but the transcript ofa conversation between degli Esposti and her friend Maraini, in which degli 190 Filming Female \"Autobiography\" Esposti, who was already one of the best­known dramatic actresses in Ital­ 191 ian theater, reveals intimate details of her family history in response to Maraini's probing questions. Despite degli Esposti's potential as a \"star\" presence, the text bears little resemblance to the conventions of celebrity journalism.1 The actress's often painful reminiscences are interwoven with and frequently interrupted by Maraini's own memories and challenging insights , giving the text a dialectical quality that brings it closer to the discur­ sive practices of feminist encounter groups (gmppi di autocoscienza) than to popular journalism or traditional autobiography. Marco Ferreri's interest in directing a cinematicadaptation of Storiadi Piera is linked to his ongoingfascination with the bankruptcyofconvention­ al gender arrangements in society. The destructiveness of the heterosexu­ al couple and the problematic influences on early childhood experience within the family system are themes that have appeared repeatedly throughout his work duringthe past several years. In his other films, how­ ever, male subjectivity usuallydominates the diegetic exploration of gen­ der issues, and a misogynist bias is often explicit.2 Although Ferreri's Storia di Piera represents many of the events originally described in degli Es­ posti's dialogue with Maraini and is focalized through the female protago­ nist's sensibility, it manifests at least as much intertextual resonance with the director's own previous work as with the volume upon which the film is based. Ferreri's distinctive style is so dominant, his thematic preoccupa­ tions so recognizable and pervasive, that the issue of enunciation is imme­ diately raised. Whose story is the film version of Storia di Piera? The purpose of my essay is to explore the cluster of issues that emerge in attempting to answer this question. First, I will briefly examine the dialogue between Maraini and degli Esposti, notingconvergences with some contemporary discourses within Italian feminism. I will then analyze the adaptation of degli Esposti's memories into a cinematic narrative,tak­ ing into account the theoretical writing on the patriarchal bias ofnarrative structure. As several feminist theorists have pointed out, narrative struc­ ture generally functions to reinforcethe Oedipal scenario. Inher influential essay \"Desire in Narrative,\" Teresa de Lauretistells how,in traditionalnarratives , women appear as obstacles that delay the male quest, or as mark­ ers of the boundaries through which the hero and his story pass on their way to a destination and the accomplishment of meaning.A simple rever­ sal ofthe terms of narrative (where the hero is replaced by a heroine) is not enough to subvert this underlying ideological agenda, and usually pro­ vides a disguised variation of the same scheme.
