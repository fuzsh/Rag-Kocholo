        "text": "Database page: Touche pas à la femme blanche - The Spaghetti Western Database\n\nMarco Ferreri was something like a maverick director of the author cinema of the 60s and 70s. So it’s no wonder that his take on the western is not really a western.\n\nDon’t Touch the White Woman was shot in western costumes in the middle of Paris mostly in modern surroundings, which anachronistic potential adds to the alienation effects of the film. Ferreri also used a giant building site for several of the “outdoor” scenes, and the authentic destroying of buildings was also made part of the story and the message of the film.\n\nAs a western Ferreri tells a very revisionist version of Custer’s last stand, mixed with parodies on western stereotypes and political comments towards contemporary events, especially of course the Vietnam war, underground CIA activities and post colonial problems.\n\nThere may be much stuff in the film to think about, but I wasn’t interested to try too much. Too much message and not enough enjoyable style. And the great cast is a bit wasted in giving us only coarse caricatures.\n\nAnd what a cast this is:\n\nCatherine Deneuve, Marcello Mastroianni, Michel Piccoli, Philippe Noiret, Ugo Tognazzi, Alain Cuny, Serge Reggiani, Paolo Vilaggio\n\nYou must have a broad definition of genre to call it a western. What amazes me more than Alex Cox having included this in his book is the fact that it’s also in his top20. I mean this film is so boring! Only the last 15 minutes were something worth watching. Otherwise it’s just guys talking and talking. And the idea of locating a western in the middle of the modern time Paris is’nt a joke which would hold for 2 hours."
