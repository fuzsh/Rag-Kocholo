        "text": "The contemporary essay film is situated within the deep transformations of cinema that led to post-cinema, just as it arises from the revolution experienced by the classic documentary, now transformed into the post-documentary, whose main axes are subjectivity and thought. Following the ideas of Deleuze and Guattari, the essay film can be considered as a sign of a new image of thought derived from cinema but more complex. The essay mode in general, as a way of thinking, adapts to the complexities of the contemporary world through its fluid, rhizomatic and multidimensional condition. Likewise, based on the hypothesis that the essay form corresponds to a certain mentality anthropologically understood, it results in the existence of a postsubject that is especially evident with the essay film and that confronts the crisis of transcendental subjectivity that has characterized the twentieth-century thought.\n\nCherchi Usai organizes the text into a collection of pithy observations and reflections on how contemporary film history problematically constructs its spatiotemporal framework through a historiographical model that emphasizes cultural/technological amnesia and fetish for the digital. It is a model that sees the ontology of the film artifact determined teleologically through aesthetic concepts emerging from spectatorship and visual culture. Each observation/reflection is delineated by a separate chapter with individual title headings, and there are fifty-two of these chapters altogether. As such, The Death of Cinema, can be understood as a treatise on the urgency to remedy postmodern cultural values with modernist material technology. The structure of the text is free-flowing and Cherchi Usai makes liberal use of citations in order to direct the reader to previous related “chapters”. There are two primary throughlines for the text with respect to Cherchi Usai’s intervention on contemporary film history: a need for structuralist schema to properly construct the film artifact’s ontology and build a new film history, and psychodynamic explanations for justifying the deconstruction of contemporary film history. Working in conjunction, these two disparate intellectual endeavors provide the foundation for Cherchi Usai’s the Moral Image paradigm – a structure where a new film history can form.\n\nThis polemical article objects to the pervasive use of realism as a value or prescriptive term in the writing of Italian cinema history. It also offers a dissenting appraisal of the ‘institution’ of neorealism: the body of critical work and discourse that constructs neorealism as the ethical and aesthetic centre of Italian cinema. The discursive recourse to neorealism has become the essential authoritative gesture: to fail to refer to it is to risk seeming ignorant, philistine and most of all politically suspect. We contest this insidious common sense of Italian cinema studies, a common sense that is underpinned by a notion of auteurist ‘paternity’ as the default explanatory metaphor of Italian ﬁlm history, and which leads to a dismissive tone in the discussion of genre ﬁlms, not to mention a disdain for the audience for such ﬁlms. We critique the idea of cinema as a ‘mirror’ of the nation found in some of the pre-eminent scholars of Italian cinema, and we ﬁnish by recommending a moratorium on the mention of neorealism for at least ﬁve years. What would a silence on realism allow us to reveal about other modes and genres? The article is followed by replies from Giulia Fanara (Rome), Millicent Marcus (Yale) and Robert Gordon (Cambridge), and then the authors’ own short response to the replies."
