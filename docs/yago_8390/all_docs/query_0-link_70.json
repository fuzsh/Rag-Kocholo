        "text": "Plot\n\nThe film starts in one of the new towns of Latina with the birth of Piera, daughter of the somewhat unbalanced Eugenia and her apparently sane husband Lorenzo, who has a job with the PCI. Eugenia's behaviour at home and in public becomes increasingly erratic and when on top of this Lorenzo loses his post, the strain puts him into a mental hospital. Piera leaves school to work for a dressmaker and pursues her dream of acting, eventually breaking into television and theatre. Interleaved with her outside life we see her sexual development, from kissing neighbourhood boys to a lesbian relationship while she is in hospital with breathing problems and finally to adult men. While Piera is maturing as a woman and as an actress, Eugenia is deteriorating and has to be locked away. The film ends with Piera taking her mother out for the day to a deserted beach, where the two women undress and hug each other tightly in a moment of natural tenderness.\n\nCast\n\nIsabelle Huppert as Piera\n\nHanna Schygulla as Eugenia\n\nMarcello Mastroianni as Lorenzo\n\nAngelo Infanti as Tito and as actor playing Jason\n\nTanya Lopert as Elide\n\nBettina Gr√ºhn as the young Piera\n\nRenato Cecchetto\n\nMaurizio Donadoni as Massimo\n\nAicch' Nana' as the midwife\n\nGirolamo Marzano\n\nLidia Montanari as 'Cento mille lires'\n\nLaura Trotter as young midwife\n\nMarina Zanchi\n\nLina Bernardi\n\nElisabetta Ambrosini\n\nFiametta Baraila\n\nSerana Bennato\n\nRita Caldana\n\nCristina Forti"
