After being verbally attacked by several shocked members of the audience who considered the film immoral, she announced that ''Piera,'' for all its outrageous content, gave a fairly accurate image of children as survivors. She pointed out that parents who overprotect their children usually deprive them of the necessary strength to face life.\n\nLater, during an interview in her hotel suite, Miss Schygulla, who speaks fluent English, commented on the episode:\n\n''It's amazing how certain people will react to things that are out of the norm. I mean, they will think and fantasize about such things, but when it's shown to them in the form of an actual image, they will recoil and feel threatened. Of course, Ferreri's films have never been easy. 'La Grande Bouffe' and 'The Last Woman' did not exactly deal with easy subjects. But for me, playing the mother in 'Piera' was incredibly fulfilling. I went into it knowing that the subject of incest was very touchy. But it was a role where, for once, the character was speeding ahead of me. You see, I need to be in films that say something and to play characters who really live out their feelings. That's when I feel I'm being stretched and challenged.''\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
