        "text": "CANNES, France -- The Japanese film 'Naramaya-Bishi-Ko' - The Ballad of Naramaya -- today won the coveted Golden Palm award at the 36th International Film Festival of Cannes.\n\nThe Grand Prix for creative cinema was awarded in a tie to French director Robert Bresson for 'L'Argent' (Money) and to Soviet director Andrei Tarkovski, whose film 'Nostalgia' was entered by Italy where it was filmed and produced.\n\nThe special jury prize went to a British entry, 'Monty Python's the Meaning of Life,' directed by Terry Jones with the Monty Python creative group.\n\nThe best actor award went to Italy's Gian-Maria Volonte for his role in 'The Death of Mario Ricci,' made by Swiss director Claude Goretta.\n\nWest Germany's Hanna Schygula won the best actress award for her role in 'Storia de Piera' -- The Story of Piera -- an Italian entry directed by Marco Ferreri.\n\nU.S. author William Styron, president of the jury, announced the prizes.\n\nThe prize-winning 'Naramaya-Bushi-Ko' was directed by Shohei Imamura, 57, one of Japan's most noted cinema creators. It tells the story of life and death in an isolated mountain village in old Japan. The hero, a 69-year-old peasant, must die at age 70 according to the village tradition to leave scarce food and other resources to the young.\n\nCritics at the screening last week praised the film's cinematography and its scenes of the hard life in the village where anybody who stole food was condemned to death. In the final scene, the peasant goes into Naramaya mountain to select the spot where he will be buried.\n\n'In making this film I wished to clarify my own thinking on the meaning of human life,' the director said.\n\nShohei Imamura was showing a work for the first time at the Cannes festival.\n\nBorn into a Tokyo family of doctors, he studied humanities and in 1951 became an assistant to the outstanding director Yasujiro Ozu.\n\nShohei Imamura made his first film in 1958, 'Stolen Desire,' followed by 'My Second Brother' and 'The Insect Woman,' both of which brought him international recognition.\n\nAfter founding his own production house he made 'The Profound Desires of Gods' and also produced documentary films, including 'Ejanaika' in 1981 on the passing of Japan from the feudal era to modern times. In his 25 years as a director he mas made 15 films. Spain won the prize for the best artistic contribution with 'Carmen', by Carlos Saura. 'Carmen' also won the grand prix from the Superior Technique Committee of the French cinema 'for its great technical quality in the service of artistic expression.'\n\nIn the short film category, the Golden Palm went to 'I Know That I'm Wrong but Ask My Pals, They Say the Same Thing,' by Pierre Levy of France.\n\nTwo films tied the jury prize for short films -- 'Too Much Oregano', a U.S. entry made by Kerry B. Feltham, and West Germany's 'The Only Forgotten Take of Casablanca', directed by Charly Weller.\n\nThe Golden Camera award for cinematography was won by Pal Erdoss of Hungary."
