        "text": "Welcome to the last Wednesday of October! Today is World Opera Day, which celebrates that storytelling form that's an integral part of the arts repertoire. Indeed, opera companies staged 20,000 performances of operas around the world in 2022. You can learn more about the day here: https://lnkd.in/duQHVq5 # # # Opera is a visual medium with striking costumes and sets. Video is also an integral part of social media marketing, and Chapter 7 of Ultimate Guide to Social Media Marketing explains why: As the saying goes, a picture is worth a thousand words. That‚Äôs because our brains are wired to process visual information (like a picture) faster and with more depth than mere words. Consider then that video is basically 30 to 60 images (frames) every second. If each frame is communicating a thousand words, that‚Äôs at least 1.8 million words in just a minute! # # # Thanks for reading! I appreciate it and I'm glad you're here.

I was recently at the New Theatre Oxford to see the Welsh National Opera Cenedlaethol Cymru production of Bernstein‚Äôs operetta Candide. Stuffed with great tunes and witty lyrics, it has one of the best overtures and most powerful closing numbers of any show I know, and is one of my favourites. üíéüêùüè≥Ô∏èüåà Although its popularity has increased since its disappointing Broadway debut in 1956, it‚Äôs widely regarded as a show that‚Äôs never reached its potential. Reworked many times over the years, this production was based on a version created by Lonny Price for the New York Philharmonic (trivia fans will enjoy the fact that Price was Neil in the movie Dirty Dancing, which coincidentally was the next show to play at the New). I think it‚Äôs the strongest version, but I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if someone else had a try at fixing it in the future. Will it ever be considered finished? Who gets to decide? ü§∑üèª‚ôÇÔ∏è That should never be the case at work. When you give or are given a task, are the completion criteria clear to all parties? Do you have a shared definition of done with your team for regular tasks? Having a definition of ‚Äúdone‚Äù is vital for effective teamwork and delegation. It‚Äôs something we can all use across our business but, unlike opinions of Candide, its criteria must be objective!\n\nThere‚Äôs a trend in modern opera of operatic adaptations of serious, contemporary, books and movies. Heavy, weighty things converted into opera form. Operas like: Dead Man Walking Of Mice and Men The Shining The Handmaid‚Äôs Tale Bel Canto Breaking the Waves Cold Mountain Il Postino The Exterminating Angel There are a lot of them. But light, funny, silly films and books never seem to get the same treatment. That‚Äôs where you come in. Pitch us an operatic adaptation of a non-heavy, non-deadly-serious book. BUT (here‚Äôs the catch) DO give it a heavy, deadly-serious TITLE. So maybe your proposed operatic adaptation of Happy Gilmore would be titled ‚ÄúGilmore: 18 Holes and a Search for Meaning‚Äù Or your proposed operatic adaptation of Step Brothers would be titled ‚ÄúThe Bonds of Brotherhood‚Äù You can share your proposed serious opera title and the silly, light source you are adapting in the comments to this post.\n\nWhen the Sydney Opera House was commissioned, the overall objective was to create \"the best opera house that can be built.\" While it's stunning design completely met the brief, the acoustics did not. The actor John Malkovich said they \"would do an aeroplane hanger a disservice\" During the course of the project, style overtook substance. The original objective was not regularly reviewed and the purpose of the project got lost. Read our blog post on what went wrong with our tips on how to getting setting objectives and holding reviews right. #settinggoals #objectives #performancereviews #performancemanagement https://bit.ly/3P3MH0b\n\nüëÄ Have you seen this TEDxTalk on OPERA by OperaDelaware's VP of Engagement Kerriann Ota√±o?! üëÄ Kerriann passionately explores how the traditional dialogue around opera can lead to gatekeeping, hindering its full impact on communities. Without joyful advocacy, opera risks being perceived as elitist and exclusive, deterring curious minds. At BLO, our 5 core values are Boldness, Collaboration, Connection, Learning, and Belonging. Kerriann speaks to each of these in her talk. One of our favorite takeaways is: \"Where we believe we belong is where we show up.\" We believe that YOU belong at the opera. More on her talk: Opera is so much more than Viking horns and Valhalla. The traditional way that we talk about opera leads to gatekeeping and has limited our ability to see all that opera can mean to a community. Without joyful advocacy, opera's reputation for elitism and exclusivity will continue to drive away curious audiences. In this TEDxOldHickory talk, former opera singer and eternal Opera Hype Girl, Kerriann Ota√±o, talks about audience and artist advocacy through the power of authenticity. The connection between grief and gratitude, vulnerability and belonging, has played an important role in Kerriann Ota√±o's career shift from professional opera singer to Vice President of Engagement. https://lnkd.in/eBat-z_4 #opera #TEDx TEDx #joyfuladvocacy #youbelong\n\nAnd you may tell yourself, \"This is not my beautiful Haydn\" And you may tell yourself, \"This is not my beautiful Wozzeck\" And you may ask yourself, \"Well, how did I get here?\" Indeterminacy is at the core of Europeras 3 & 4: from the arias sung to the costumes worn, each decision about the production is made using chance procedures. On the Detroit Opera blog, Matthew Principe, Director of Media and Special Projects, details how the piano parts for Europera 3 were selected (randomly) and how they will be juxtaposed with bits and pieces of famous opera arias. What do opera production and furniture building have in common? The old adage ‚ÄúFollow the instructions!‚Äù Read more at https://lnkd.in/gWqKVNiU\n\nHow do you practice? Do you even think about practice? I am regularly reminding my clients to step out of the dance of daily ‚Äúdoing‚Äù and move up to the balcony for some work on their business. On my visit to the Paris Opera with Edilia G√§nz, Oliver Radtke, and Aparna Bhasin, we visited the practice room where dancers could practice on the same angled floor they would experience on the stage (The Paris Opera stage as a 5% grade). I was convicted. Usually I ask my clients to step off the stage to observe. I usually don‚Äôt ask them to step off the stage to practice. And then there was this practice room. Its beauty and attention to detail elevated the idea of practice. It was more beautiful and approachable than the actual stage and made me think that perhaps practice might be more important than the performance itself. So, here is my question: What new skill, behavior, or mindset are you currently practicing? Are you giving it a Paris Opera Rehearsal Room level of importance? #practice, #leadership, #parisopera, #adaptiveleadership"
