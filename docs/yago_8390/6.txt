Description: Piera was a beautiful girl and desired child in a wealthy family. But her mother, Eugenia, not of high morals, and was able to make love with the first attractive man which she met. Her father wanted to keep the family together, and has long turned a blind eye to the antics of his wife. Piera wanted to be an actress, but heredity of the mother begins to happen …

Review: This picture can surprise even loyal fans of recognized the Italian filmmakers. Everyone already seems to have got used to the scandalous stories of Marco Ferreri animal instincts of people and slow agonizing humanity that reclines almost breathlessly on their own excrement. And in the film “The Story of Piera” also has scenes embarrassing mass consciousness – Eugenia, active and frivolous woman is relaxed way of life, not paying attention to the weak-willed and flawed husband Lorenzo (by the way, he – communist) or the small daughter Pierre, who feels unsatisfied curiosity and attraction to the nature of his mother. Becoming an adult, Pierre enjoys the theater, has a lesbian relationship in the presence of the groom, descended sorry, sick father, to whom she was undressing at his request, and in the final with his mother, both naked, they merge into a kiss on the beach
