Jewish science fiction and fantasy? Yes! The distinguished list of contributors includes: Bernard Malamud, Isaac Bashevis Singer, Isaac Asimov, Robert Silverberg, Harlan Ellison, Pamela Sargent, Avram Davidson, Geo. Alec Effinger, Horace L. Gold, Robert Sheckley, William Tenn, and Carol Carr.

William Tenn's futuristic story "On Venus, Have We Got A Rabbi" takes on the volatile issue of "Who is a Jew?"--a question certainly as timely in 1998 as he imagines it will be in 2533. Asimov's "Unto the Fourth Generation" takes on the issue of Jews as endangered species in America, a theme that is even more apparent today than it was in 1974. Davidson's "The Golem" humorously plants the Frankenstein monster of Jewish folklore right in the middle-class bungalow culture of contemporary Hollywood, California.

Wandering Stars reminds us that we are still studying, still suffering, still making jokes and myth, and still trying to figure out what it means to be Jewish. You don't have to be Jewish to enjoy this clever book. We laughed out loud reading it.
