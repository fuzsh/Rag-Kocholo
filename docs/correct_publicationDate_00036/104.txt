Almost three decades ago, my friend and fellow writer Jack Dann asked Isaac Asimov to write an introduction to an anthology Jack was editing. That book, Wandering Stars (published by Harper & Row in 1974 and reissued by Jewish Lights Publishing in 1998), was the first anthology of Jewish science fiction and fantasy, and Isaac's original response to Jack's request was, "Why me?"

This may be the reason I am writing this particular essay, given that in many ways I am as much of an infidel as was Isaac Asimov. My grandparents on my mother's side were nonobservant Jews who, feeling that religion hadn't done people much good in the old country, didn't bother to practice it on these shores. My mother was an assimilationist who, after marrying my non-Jewish father, considered herself fortunate to be able to give her children solidly Anglo-Saxon names. To complicate my personal heritage even further, my father was also part Mohawk on his mother's side. At a convention in the early 1990s, editor Jim Frenkel, upon learning of this, dubbed me a "Jewhawk," which strikes me as both witty and appropriate, although my contact with Iroquois culture was even more attenuated than that with Judaism.

I grew up in the 1950s; those few of my friends who were Jews were about as assimilated as I was. The only religious rituals I recall were occasional attendance at temple (a Reform synagogue, needless to say) and the intermittent Seder...
