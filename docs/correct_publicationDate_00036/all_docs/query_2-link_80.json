        "text": "This audiobook reveals that Orange is among the most insightful novelists writing today and a poet of pain. Among this segmented novel's stellar performances, Charley Flyte's reading of Victoria Bear Shield's dramatic monologue to her unborn daughter is a tour de force--a haunting performance with an expressive tone and intimate voice. Alma Cuervo portrays Jacquie Red Feather and Victoria--the unborn infant, now a grandmother--with candor, compassion, and a thoughtful pace. Shaun Taylor-Corbett performs some of the narration--in particular, the cri de coeur for Indian rights--and is especially convincing as the wounded Orvil Red Feather. Calvin Joyal captures Lony, the innocent seeker. Set in Oakland, Orange's immersive novel is a compelling look at the experience of urban Indians--a powerful listening experience. A.D.M.
