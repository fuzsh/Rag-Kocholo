Captured and taken to Fort Marion prison castle, Star faces the daunting task of learning English and embracing Christianity under the stern guidance of Richard Henry Pratt. Little does he know, Pratt's actions will pave the way for the establishment of the Carlisle Indian Industrial School—a place aimed at erasing Native history, culture, and identity.\n\nFast forward a generation, and Star's son, Charles, finds himself ensnared in the same institution his father endured. Subjected to the cruelty of his father's former captor, Charles struggles to find solace amidst the brutality. Yet, in the midst of darkness, he finds a flicker of hope in his friendship with Opal Viola, a fellow student. Together, they dare to dream of a life beyond the institutional violence that plagues their lineage.\n\n\"Tommy Orange's 'Wandering Stars' is a breathtaking exploration of intergenerational trauma and resilience. Through the vivid characters of Star and Charles, Orange skillfully navigates the complexities of identity in the face of cultural erasure. This novel is a powerful reminder of the enduring strength of indigenous communities.\" - Review by Indigenous Literature Review\n\n\"In 'Wandering Stars,' Tommy Orange delivers a gripping narrative that captivates from start to finish.
