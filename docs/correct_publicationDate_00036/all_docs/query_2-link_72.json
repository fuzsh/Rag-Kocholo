        "text": "Editor’s note: The opinions of the smart, well-read women in my Denver book club mean a lot, and often determine what the rest of us choose to pile onto our bedside tables. So we asked them, and all Denver Post readers, to share these mini-reviews with you. Have any to offer? Email bellis@denverpost.com.\n\n“Wandering Stars,” by Tommy Orange (Alfred A. Knopf, 2024)\n\nThis sequel to Orange’s earlier novel, “There There” (a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize in 2019), “Wandering Stars” is divided into 2 sections (“Before” and “Aftermath”). This division is not only chronological but also stylistic. “Before” opens with the Sand Creek Massacre in 1864 and relates the history of a single Native American family into the 20th century. The characters’ individual experiences of displacement and cultural repression also represent Native American history writ large. Orange employs a sort of linguistic shape-shifting in this section, with individual words of multiple meanings repeated over and over. And I had to read some passages over and over to appreciate the subtlety of his intent. “Before” presents a somewhat mystical space, guiding the reader to feel how earlier Native American generations were so differently connected to their world and spiritual beliefs than their European conquerors.\n\nIn contrast, “Aftermath,” set in present-day Oakland, Calif., uses a lot of dialogue to move the story more crisply forward. Several of the characters in “Aftermath” wrestle with what it means to be Native American and their longing for the lost stories and traditional ways of past generations intensifies over successive generations. But the sad through line connecting the 2 sections is substance abuse and addiction, starting with alcohol, peyote and laudanum in the 19th century and landing with heroin and opioids in contemporary Oakland. How the characters cope throughout this novel is uniquely individual, but simultaneously universal. — 3 1/2 stars out of 4; Kathleen Lance, Denver\n\n“Fourteen Days,” by Margaret Atwood, et. al. (Harper, 2024)\n\nDuring the COVID lockdown, New Yorkers sharing an apartment building gather nightly on the roof to share stories. Written by 36 different renowned authors — including Margaret Atwood, Celeste Ng, Tommy Orange and John Grisham — this book of tales is unified by careful scaffolding into a surprisingly cohesive novel. The stories told are compelling, diverse, and varied in genre — and puzzling out who wrote what (not revealed until the end) makes for intriguing reading. — 3 1/2 stars (out of 4); Neva Gronert, Parker\n\n“Wool,” by Hugh Howey (Broad Reach Publishing, 2012)\n\nThe author self-published a post-apocalyptic novel and made history, at least among struggling writers, by becoming a best-seller. He completed four novellas in the series, then obtained a publishing contract. The action of this compelling sci-fi thriller takes place in a silo, a 144-floor underground community of humans. The air above ground is toxic after an unknown catastrophe. Those who attempt to go out and others being punished for misdeeds are “cleansed.” Juliette, a new mayor, attempts to rectify the many social and personal problems of the society but seems doomed to failure. Her battle to survive herself, as well as save the remnants of civilization, leads readers to question the value of our way of life. — 3 stars (out of 4); Bonnie McCune, Denver, bonniemccune.com\n\n“The Hunter,” by Tana French (Viking, 2024)\n\nIf you enjoyed “The Searcher,” you will welcome dropping back into our hero Cal Hooper’s life as a retired ex-cop, ex-pat now living a quiet life in a small Irish village. Unexpected events put a quick end to the quietness of that life. A well-paced, compelling mystery with lots of local color and a touch of humor. — 3 stars (out of 4); Kathleen Lance, Denver\n\nSubscribe to our weekly newsletter, In The Know, to get entertainment news sent straight to your inbox."
