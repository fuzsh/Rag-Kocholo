        "text": "On the fiftieth anniversary of his groundbreaking anthology Wandering Stars: An Anthology of Jewish Science Fiction and Fantasy, we’re joined by the terrific author and editor Jack Dann.\n\nDuring our conversation, we mention his new collection Islands of Time—published almost exactly 50 years after his first book— as well as his The Fiction Writer’s Guide to Alternate History and some of his classic novels like The Memory Cathedral and The Rebel.\n\nMostly, though, we discuss how that classic anthology evolved, in part from his friendship with Pamela Sargent and George Zebrowski, what the anthology meant in 1974, and how the nature of Jewish science fiction has evolved over the decades.\n\nTo kick off 2023, Jonathan and Gary share their lists of the books that they’re looking forward to reading in 2023.\n\nThey mention a lot of forthcoming titles, ranging books from old masters like Peter S. Beagle, Howard Waldrop, Joanna Russ, Gene Wolfe, and Connie Willis to newer writers like Samit Basu, Vajra Chandrasekera, Alix E. Harrow, Emily Tesh, and Premee Mohamed, as well as essential collections from Kelly Link, E. Lily Yu, Joanna Russ, K.J. Parker, Sarah Pinsker, and others.\n\nThe team also cheerfully acknowledge that the year will undoubtedly present us with some complete surprises and that we will be reading fantastic work from authors we haven’t even heard of yet. The field seems as lively and promising as ever!\n\nPre-order links\n\nBooks mentioned in the podcast include:\n\nBlade of Dream, Daniel Abraham\n\nConquest, Nina Allan\n\nThe Jinn-Bot of Shantiport, Samit Basu\n\nThe Saint of Bright Doors, Vajra Chandrasekera\n\nFurious Heaven, Kate Elliott\n\nThe Landing, Mary Gentle\n\nMenewood, Nicola Griffith\n\nStarling House, Alix E.

Lily Yu (collection)\n\nAs we move through the first week of December and into day nine of the Advent Calendar series, Gary spends some time chatting with the incredible Rachel Swirsky about what she's been reading, what she'd recommend, what she reads on the holidays, what work she has coming out, and her fabulous science fiction novella January Fifteenth (Tordotcom), which looks at how universal basic income might affect some of us.\n\nAs always, our thanks to Rachel for making the time to talk to us. We hope you enjoy the episode!\n\nWith the end of the year almost upon us, Coode Street was looking for a way to celebrate the books we read and loved during 2022. We also wanted to help you find something great to read for yourself or for someone close to you. And so the 2022 Coode Street Advent Calendar was born! Here are twenty-eight books that we loved and that we think you might love too. Space operas and epic fantasies, horror stories and comedies. Six-hundred page immersive tomes and light-footed short story collections. A little bit of everything! To make this more than just a list, though, we're going to do something else. Every day between now and December 25 we're chatting with the wonderful creators of these books and asking them about what they've been reading, what holiday story they'd recommend, their own books for this year, and the ones they might have coming in 2023.\n\nKelly Barnhill and When Women Were Dragons & The Ogress and the Orphans\n\nRichard Buttner and The Adventurists\n\nC.S.E Cooney and Saint Death's Daughter\n\nAliette de Bodard and Of Charms, Ghosts and Grievances & The Red Scholar's Wake\n\nStephanie Feldman and Saturnalia\n\nNicola Griffith and Spear\n\nElizabeth Hand and Hokuloa Road\n\nAlix E. Harrow and A Mirror Mended\n\nKate Heartfield and The Embroidered Book\n\nN.K. Jemisin and The World We Make\n\nAlex Jennings and The Ballad of Perilous Graves\n\nGuy Gavriel Kay and All the Seas of the World\n\nPaul McAuley and Beyond the Burn Line\n\nSam J. Miller and Kid Wolf and Kraken Boy & Boys, Beasts & Men\n\nTamsyn Muir and Nona the Ninth\n\nSequoia Nagamatsu and How High We Go in the Dark\n\nTochi Onyebuchi and Goliath\n\nM. Rickert and Lucky Girl: How I Became a Horror Writer\n\nKelly Robson and High Times in the Low Parliament\n\nChristopher Rowe and These Prisoning Hills\n\nRachel Swirsky and January Fifteenth\n\nLavie Tidhar and Neom\n\nNghi Vo and Siren Queen & Into the Riverlands\n\nLiz Williams and Embertide\n\nNeon Yang and The Genesis of Misery\n\nThe sharp-eyed among you will notice that there aren't quite 28 entries in our Advent Calendar. You're right! We're still to record a few, but they should all be in place before this is done. But keep your eyes peeled for more.\n\nWhat else did we do? Well, it's Coode Street, so we rambled about books of the year, short story collections and more. Hope you enjoy it!\n\nWith Gary about to leave for the World Fantasy Convention to be held in New Orleans next week, and with Jonathan in the process of assembling anthologies on the most recent iterations of space opera, we spend most of our time discussing the characteristics, history, and too-common misuse of that venerable term.\n\nWhile we do touch briefly on the etymology of 'space opera', and on the pulp-era adventures that Wilson Tucker had in mind when he rather contemptuously coined the term in 1941, most of the discussion focuses on how the idea has evolved since M. John Harrison set out to demolish the old-school space opera with The Centauri Device in 1974, the efforts of Paul J. McAuley and others to define a new space opera in the 1980s (and Jonathan and Gardner Dozois’s The New Space Opera anthologies of 2007 and 2010), the influence of media, and more recent examples ranging from James S.A. Corey’s Expanse series to Aliette de Bodard’s Xuya universe, Nnedi Okorafor’s Binti series, and other authors who have energetically begun to reclaim space opera for a more diverse cast of characters. We fully expect enthusiastic disagreements.\n\nAs always, we hope you enjoy the episode. See you all again after World Fantasy!\n\nFor the first week in July, we’re joined by Nebula Award winner Rachel Swirsky, whose novella January Fifteenth ( just out from Tordotcom) is a provocative exploration of the idea of Universal Basic Income (UBI) as it might play out in the lives of four women in very different circumstances. We touch upon Rachel’s decision to focus on characters rather than systems, to set the tale in a recognizable near future, and to deliberately restrain from many science-fictional bells and whistles.\n\nThis leads to how SF deals, too rarely, with questions of economic policy and the effects on individual lives —in the case of January Fifteenth, a woman escaping from an abusive ex-spouse, a journalist covering the effects of UBI, a well-off college student whose friends deliberately waste their annual checks, and a young member of a repressive religious cult. As usual, we touch upon what’s next for Rachel, including an intriguing collaboration with Ann Leckie.\n\nAs always, our thanks to Rachel for making the time to talk to us. We hope you enjoy the episode!"
