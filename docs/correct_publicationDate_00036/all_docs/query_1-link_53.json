        "text": "Bear with me, please, while I think this out in the way in which I am most comfortable: on my keyboard. We are seeing a great deal of weaponized antiSemitism worldwide, in musical contests, the academic community, the club of bigots that is the UN, people on streets coming up and hitting Jews...I mean, even Islamophilic publications exult in this, and the college students and their handlers certainly do. At the same time, we are hearing a great deal of denunciations of Islamophobia (which was bad after 9/11) and demands for more status for Palestinian studies as well as Islamic studies in colleges and universities. These demands would probably be a valuable addition to scholarship if I weren't concerned that some of them are not scholarly, but ideological participation trophies. The Islamicists I knew way back when in grad school were GOOD. What I am hearing as part of \"nonnegotiable demands\" strikes me as being more a matter of concern, along with the assumption that people do not \"educate themselves\" on the subject. I've been reading, personally, since about 1961 when I started with T.E. Lawrence. And I wonder if the people crying Islamophobia are reading about Jews and Zionism AND the bifurcations of healthy disagreement in Judaism. It doesn't seem that way. They hit on Henry Ford and Edward Said, and al Jazeera, and that seems very much to be that. At the same time, scholarly trends and the prevailing fashion statement seem to blend into things that seem to be utterly contradictory. Pre-partition and post 9/11, there was a lot of Islamophobia. Now, there seems to be a level of partisanship that has come up very rapidly. Can it be logical to lament Islamophobia while turning oneself into the cause celebre of the day? It seems contradictory to me. Some of this isn't scholarship. Some of this isn't politics. Some of this seems to be ideological social climbing. How'd we get from there to here?\n\nBecause of Kent State's anniversary tomorrow, I am flashing back. The thing I am flashing back to is the sign \"America: Love it or Leave it\" that greeted me many years ago when I was active in the anti-war movement. I am seeing that a LOT these days, often on LinkedIn. I am not comfortable with it. Part of this is memories. Part of it is also Realpolitik. I still think it's a stupid and divisive thing to say to someone who's a citizen here, no matter how angry the person is saying it or how good it may make them feel. This is the protestors' home. They may choose to leave; I've known a few. Now, however, it strikes me as a very American decision to protest like hell even if I don't like the protests. I certainly did, and do. However, If they get violent -- just don't send in the National Guard, PLEASE. I am firmly convinced that law-abiding protest is one of the glories of this country. Like holding public elections. Like even making noisy idiots of ourselves if we think it's necessary. Then, it's not idiotic. But, let's look at foreign visitors. They're welcome, provided they obey the laws, of course. Yes, I know classical predents: Pericles' funeral oration: \"We honor the laws, and we honor the laws that are above the laws.\" And Antigone's obedience to the \"agraphoi nomoi,\" the unwritten laws. Those are big problems. You may recall that Creon was a creep and Antigone paid with her life. She accepted the consequences, terrible as they were and are. I am looking right now at foreign students. They too have every right to be here with admission, visas, and keeping their grades up. They may be subsidized by their universities, their home countries, or rich parents. But if they start breaking the law, they too face consequences -- ESPECIALLY if that's what they're partly here to do. I have to admit, however, it seems a bit opportunistic to beat the odds of admissions under 10%, come over here, take US funding (especially), then fight against the US, go home and use the cachet of a prestigious US university to help you. I admit it's their right. I am just uncomfortable with it and think they should be called on it. I am equally uncomfortable with being denounced for my discomfort by virtue signalers. In other words, I'm fretting. But I cannot have taken pride in my own activism without wondering if current affairs are different."
