        "text": "Six years have passed since Tommy Orange published his debut novel, “There There,” but the echoes of that story still reverberate in the minds of those who read it. A member of the Cheyenne and Arapaho tribes, Orange introduced a large cast of Indians in modern-day California and drew them to the Oakland Coliseum for a powwow that offered a chance for cultural celebration, commercial enterprise, spiritual reflection and, most notably, grand larceny.\n\nWith varying degrees of success, these characters struggle to carve out a livable haven amid the caustic crosscurrents of American racism and historical amnesia. By listening sympathetically and refusing to elide their challenges — or their mistakes — Orange demonstrates that Indians are not feathered Hollywood tropes or wooden icons of Old West mythology. His fiction explores the complex challenges faced by people struggling to understand their identity within a dominant culture determined to bleach and sentimentalize the past.\n\nDuring one of many poignant moments in Orange’s new novel, “Wandering Stars,” an Indian woman goes to a public library in the late 1950s and asks “what novels are written by Indian people.” The librarian tells her “she doesn’t think there are any.” Sixty years later, an Indian boy wonders “why there weren’t any Native American superheroes.” His older brother laments that he and his family “weren’t connected to the tribe or to their language or with the knowledge that other people had about being Native.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is the story of that family, their history and the enervating effects of being cut off from it. As one desperately discouraged young man tells a friend, “No Indians from when they first named us Indians would recognize us as Indians now.”\n\n“Wandering Stars” is not technically a sequel, but it wraps around “There There.” Readers unfamiliar with the earlier book will feel its gravitational influence as some invisible body of dark matter, but fans will find here a rich expansion of Orange’s universe.\n\nThe story opens with “America’s longest war,” more than 300 years of conflict in which Indians were massacred, starved and, euphemistically, “removed.” But Orange is interested in the twilight atrocities of that period. In one of his typically hypnotic sentences, the very grammar conveys the impossible labyrinth of survival: “When the Indian Wars began to go cold, the theft of land and tribal sovereignty bureaucratic, they came for Indian children, forcing them into boarding schools, where if they did not die of what they called consumption even while they regularly were starved; if they were not buried in duty, training for agricultural or industrial labor, or indentured servitude; were they not buried in children’s cemeteries, or in unmarked graves, not lost somewhere between the school and home having run away, unburied, unfound, lost to time, or lost between exile and refuge, between school, tribal homelands, reservation, and city; if they made it through routine beatings and rape, if they survived, made lives and families and homes, it was because of this and only this: Such Indian children were made to carry more than they were made to carry.”\n\nOne of those children is Jude Star. In 1864, he barely survives the Sand Creek massacre and goes mute in response to the trauma. The invaded world he wanders into is almost as deadly. “There was unspeakable pain and loss all about us wherever we went,” Jude says. To avoid starvation, he eventually turns himself over to U.S. soldiers and gets shipped off to a prison in Florida.\n\nThere, trapped in a program of cultural annihilation, Jude begins his conflicted relationship with White society under the tutelage of a jailer named Richard Henry Pratt, an actual historical figure who will go on to found the Carlisle Indian Industrial School. Determined to eradicate “their blanket ways,” Pratt practiced a toxic benevolence based on the principle of “Kill the Indian, Save the Man.”\n\nSign up for the Book World newsletter from The Washington Post\n\nTaught to read and write, Jude is seduced by Western classics, and he finds the Bible particularly fascinating, especially its strange echoes of Cheyenne stories. But what really perplexes him are the contradictory demands of his conquerors: Jude is repeatedly told to eradicate everything about himself that’s Indian, and yet he’s also required to represent “the vanishing race.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“We performed being Indian for the white people. Some of us danced and drummed and sang,” Jude says. “We performed ourselves, made it look authentic for the sake of performing authenticity. Like being was for sale, and we’d sold ours.”\n\nThat corrosive paradox, forced down his throat by Pratt, seeps into Jude’s descendants. With the horrible inevitability of a Greek tragedy, his own son ends up attending the Carlisle School, where he endures similar humiliations that push him into drug addiction. Isolated and filled with self-hatred, Jude’s son becomes a man desperate to both escape and retain the past. “Most days,” Orange writes, “he just let the laudanum do what it would do to him, which he would have trouble remembering later, and hate himself for not being able to stop wiping out his own memory.”\n\nAs “Wandering Stars” sweeps through the decades, Orange gathers up moments of love and despair in stories that demonstrate what a piercing writer he is. But then, about halfway through the novel, we arrive in 2018, more than 150 years after the Sand Creek massacre. Here, Orange flares his wings and touches down for good in the home of Orvil Red Feather, the teenager wounded at the climax of “There There.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStill recovering from being shot during the Oakland Coliseum powwow, Orvil just wants to “feel normal again.” But along with all the usual anxieties of being a teenager, he’s in the maw of an addiction to painkillers. His tender spirit is encased in a hard glaze of cynicism, and “Wandering Stars” captures his faux-tough voice so poignantly that you just want to wrap your arms around him and protect him somehow from further harm. Of course, that’s not easy for anyone to do, and Orange is terrific at the quirky interplay of kids and their elders. When Orvil admits, “I wanted to feel connected to being Native, and to being Cheyenne, but I didn’t quite know how,” no one around him knows either.\n\nThe shift in pacing and structure — essentially moving from a collection of connected short stories to a novella — gives Orange the space to explore the lives of other people in Orvil’s life, especially the great-aunt who mothers him and his brothers. “Their newly made family was a chorus of noise and a throng of pain in waiting,” Orange writes, “because it was loved, and had been saved, and so loved desperately, knowing that whatever happened to any one of them happened to every one of them.”\n\n5 new works of historical fiction offer a window into other times\n\nSubstance abuse derails many of these lives, but the most devastating aspect of “Wandering Stars” is how Orvil’s nature-loving little brother Lony copes with being estranged from his culture. While the adults in his family are struggling to stay alive and keep the older kids out of trouble, Lony spirals into self-destruction. Denied a knowledge of his ancestors’ customs, he designs his own with the sharp tools at his disposal. Starved for sacred animals, he turns to the meat of his own body. Haunted by the Oakland powwow where Orvil almost died, “he just doesn’t want anything like what happened to ever happen again,” Orange writes. “He isn’t sure what it means, but he knows something else is necessary, something he needs to do, in secret, something required of him.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough his great-aunt senses this need in her joints, she’s not sure how to comfort him. “We come from prisoners of a long war that didn’t stop even when it stopped,” she thinks. “But surviving wasn’t enough. To endure or pass through endurance test after endurance test only ever gave you endurance test passing abilities. Simply lasting was great for a wall, for a fortress, but not for a person.”\n\nIt’s not too early to say that Orange is building a body of literature that reshapes the Native American story in the United States. Book by book, he’s correcting the dearth of Indian stories even while depicting the tragic cost of that silence. As one lost character in “Wandering Stars” says, “I want to come home.” Orange is getting that place ready.\n\nRon Charles reviews books and writes the Book Club newsletter for The Washington Post.\n\nWandering Stars\n\nBy Tommy Orange"
