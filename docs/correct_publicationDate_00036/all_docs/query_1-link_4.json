The first of its kind, it is an established and enduring classic.\n\nThis is the first time in a science fiction collection that the Jewish People―and the richness of their themes and particular points of view―appear without a mask. Wandering Stars is a showpiece of Jewish wit, culture, and lore, of the blend of humor and sadness, cynicism, and faith. In these pages you’ll find superlative tales of fantasy and science fiction by masters."
