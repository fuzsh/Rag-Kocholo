        "text": "Author’s note: Throughout this article, I use the term “Native” to refer to characters present in Tommy Orange’s “There There” and “Wandering Stars.” This is the term used throughout Orange’s novels, as well as what is used in interviews with Orange concerning his own heritage and writings. Many individuals prefer different terms, but as a white American, I have decided to leave the choice of which is appropriate to the author.\n\n“Wandering Stars” is hard to classify. It is deeply related to Tommy Orange’s previous book, “There There,” and features many of the same characters, expands on plotlines from and grapples with similar thematic material as that title. But “Wandering Stars” is not a prequel. It’s not a sequel, either. While pedantically it could likely qualify as both, the novel doesn’t exactly complete its previous novel; instead, it compliments it in plot and thematic weight. Time, it seems, is not a straight path that Orange attempts to walk down, so why should his continuing novel do so?\n\nWhile “There There” centers many separate narratives from a collection of Native characters who connect via an ultimately tragic gathering at the Big Oakland Powwow, “Wandering Stars” has a more focused through line. After a prologue giving a brief introduction to the long history of genocidal tactics used against Native peoples by white colonizers, the story begins by reaching back to the ancestors of the Red Feathers, who are featured prominently in “There There.” Then, the novel jumps ahead, moving into the family’s uncertain future after the traumatic events of “There There.” For those unfamiliar with Orange’s previous book, this latest novel is still readable, but it lacks the context needed for a truly rich reading experience. If you’re planning to pick it up, I recommend starting with the former novel first.\n\nStruggle is ubiquitous to each member of the family, stemming from problems of addiction, mental health challenges and identity crises that are only exacerbated by the endless permutations of white-supremacist violence that haunt every timeframe covered by the novel. While all of these topics are present in “There There,” the former novel was a book structured purposefully around the fragmentation of Native people and stories in an urban setting via its disconnected-yet-connected characters. “Wandering Stars,” in contrast, takes a much different approach. By following one family in all its history and legacy, Orange attempts to find connective tissue between the different generations of the Red Feathers and the drastically different ways each character approaches their own past, present and future. “Wandering Stars” asks how familial loops of behavior are established, both positive and negative, and grapples with the challenge of addressing generational trauma that’s been gathered further back than one can even remember. Using its novelistic powers, “Wandering Stars” can give readers a birds-eye view of the cycles of family, providing insights into how each character repeats and breaks the cycles of their ancestors’ pasts. All of this, impressively, is done in a manner that does not flatten nor pigeonhole any individual in their present chapters. Actions feel realistic while still being driven by factors that characters cannot understand about themselves without their context, all at once.\n\nThe prose style perfectly serves the narratives it’s employed for. Many sentences run on, creating comma structures so imbued with stylistic power that they supersede the need for strict grammatical correctness. These blocks of text are used to articulate unbroken voices and thoughts, as if expression within the bounds of traditional grammar might leave characters cut off, once again silenced from speaking their own unfiltered truth. The chapters of the book, swapping between members of the Red Feather family, vary in their perspectives based on the sense of how each character needs to express themselves. Sometimes a character will give it to us straight, speaking with the self-narrativizing “I” pronoun, whereas other times Orange will step in as a narrator, telling us things about a character they likely would not have said about themselves. While this switching could have resulted in a disjointed narrative, Orange can use his chapter breaks strategically, giving the reader benchmarks to highlight the intelligence of his variety of styles. It weaves momentum into the story as well: This narrative is free of monotony, and the emotional connections the audience will face as they read serve as proof of Orange’s deftness.\n\nAlso impressive is how Orange discusses modernity and its influence on culture in the novel. The book begins in the late-19th century, yet manages comprehensibility without feeling anachronistic. On the opposite side comes the fact that three of the novel’s main characters — Orvil, Loother and Lony — are growing boys in the information era, an extremely difficult experience to portray without contrivance due to its hyper-specific and ever-shifting nature. Orange does a miraculously fair job, both highlighting the unique joys and despair that come from an upbringing with the internet as ubiquitous as air. Time is leaped through gracefully, which is a real feat considering the hundreds of years between the beginning and the end of the story.\n\nSome may say we didn’t need another novel dealing with the same characters we spent time with in “There There,” but I disagree. While inherently touching on some of the same thematic material as in his previous novel, Orange’s approach here is different than before. Instead of presenting in stunning detail the lives of modern people, Orange instead invites the audience to entertain a fantasy: What if one were able to access their full stolen heritage in the same way that we, the readers, are omnipotently able to by reading the saga of the Red Feathers? Perhaps, it would change our actions immensely, or perhaps it would change nothing. Either way, Orange proves it would mean something.\n\nDaily Arts Writer Grace Sielinski can be reached at gsielins@umich.edu."
