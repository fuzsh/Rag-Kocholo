        "text": "The Golem and the Jinni\n\nBy Helene Wecker,\n\nFrom my list on a mythical creature’s point of view.\n\nBy Alison Levy Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI love mythological creatures! I grew up gravitating toward fantasy books but because I have a narcissistic parent, I got teased for reading them. To avoid the teasing, I ended up reading a lot of mythology because that was a “safe” fantasy option; reading mythology was “educational” rather than “silly.” When I got older, I discovered that there’s a whole category of fantasy books that retell myths from alternative points of view. This subgenre opened new doors of understanding and empathy for me. Reading old stories from new perspectives opens my eyes to a myriad of different types of people and broadens my view of the world. And I’ve been reading them ever since.\n\nAlison's book list on a mythical creature’s point of view\n\nWhy did Alison love this book?\n\nThe story of two mystical creatures stuck in 1899 New York who have to make their own way in the world. Despite their different natures, they become unlikely friends and have to work together to survive.\n\nWhile I enjoyed the perspective of both supernatural beings in this book, I found the golem especially engaging. Through her eyes, the reader gets an amazingly detailed view of turn-of-the-century New York as well as the intricacies of human behavior.\n\nThe jinni faces different challenges—he’s lost a chunk of his memory—but he also has to adapt to life among people. Wrapped in a rich tapestry of historical details, the story walks us through their processes of acclimating to human society and facing the dangers of their pasts.\n\nBy Helene Wecker,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n9 authors picked The Golem and the Jinni as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\n'One of only two novels I've ever loved whose main characters are not human' BARBARA KINGSOLVER\n\nFor fans of The Essex Serpent and The Mermaid and Mrs Hancock.\n\n'By far my favourite book of of the year' Guardian\n\nChava is a golem, a creature made of clay, brought to life by a disgraced rabbi who dabbles in dark Kabbalistic magic. When her master, the husband who commissioned her, dies at sea on the voyage from Poland, she is unmoored and adrift as the ship arrives in New York in 1899.\n\nAhmad is a djinni, a being of fire, born in…\n\nPreview\n\nThe Yiddish Policemen's Union\n\nBy Michael Chabon,\n\nFrom my list on cops and reporters bringing bad guys to justice.\n\nBy Rod Kackley Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nCrime fiction, true crime, mystery, and suspense books allow us to brush up against the worst society has to offer without getting hurt. There’s a lot to be said for vicarious thrills, isn’t there. I am just a simple man telling simple stories about good vs. evil. And sometimes, in my stories, fiction or not, the bad guys win. But I do love telling stories, and when I find a good one, I can’t wait to tell you aboutit. That’s what I have done here.\n\nRod's book list on cops and reporters bringing bad guys to justice\n\nWhy did Rod love this book?\n\nI’ve read this book so many times that I had to buy a hardcover edition to replace the paperback I wore out.\n\nMichael Chabon creates an alternative world where the Jewish people didn’t last long in Israel after World War Two. They wound up in the Federal District of Sitka, Alaska, with a lease for the land from the U.S. government, but now the lease is up, and they have to move. Somewhere. Almost anywhere.\n\nGood story if it ends there, right?\n\nBut wait, this one doesn’t.\n\nIn the middle of this political conundrum, homicide detective Meyer Landsman finds a neighbor in the fleabag hotel he calls home murdered. And get this; the dead man might be the Messiah the Jewish people have been waiting for.\n\nGood story, End it here? Nope.\n\nGuess who shows up unexpectedly. Meyer’s ex-wife! And now she’s his boss. Awkward!\n\nAnd it’s also a hell…\n\nBy Michael Chabon,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n6 authors picked The Yiddish Policemen's Union as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nThe brilliantly original new novel from Michael Chabon, author of THE ADVENTURES OF KAVALIER & CLAY and WONDER BOYS.\n\nWhat if, as Franklin Roosevelt once proposed, Alaska - and not Israel - had become the homeland for the Jews after the Second World War? In Michael Chabon's Yiddish-speaking 'Alyeska', Orthodox gangs in side-curls and knee breeches roam the streets of Sitka, where Detective Meyer Landsman discovers the corpse of a heroin-addled chess prodigy in the flophouse Meyer calls home. Marionette strings stretch back to the hands of charismatic Rebbe Gold, leader of a sect that seems to have drawn its…\n\nPreview\n\nThe Masque Of Manana\n\nBy Robert Sheckley,\n\nFrom my list on humorous science fiction and fantasy.\n\nBy Daniel M. Kimmel Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nWhile doing a college humor column I was hoping to be the next Art Buchwald, but instead ended up first as a lawyer, then a film critic and college professor. When I finally got around to writing fiction, the blending of science fiction and comedy was a natural fit (with occasional forays into horror and fantasy). I’ve done four novels and a couple of dozen published stories to date and when readers tell me they’ve enjoyed them I answer, “If it made you laugh, I did my job.” When I came up with the mashup title of “Father of the Bride of Frankenstein” I said, “I have to write this.”\n\nDaniel's book list on humorous science fiction and fantasy\n\nWhy did Daniel love this book?\n\nRobert Sheckley was a major influence on me as he mixed SF and humor, sometimes broadly and sometimes darkly. This “best of” collection – on which I got to offer my suggestions as to what should be included – really is the cream of the crop. I will always be grateful that I had the chance to meet him while he was still with us… and that before I could say a word, he thanked me for a blurb I did on another collection of his works. It was the perfect fanboy moment.\n\nBy Robert Sheckley,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked The Masque Of Manana as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nThis volume contains the major short science fiction of Robert Sheckley.\n\nPreview\n\nOh God\n\nBy Avery Corman,\n\nFrom my list on humorous science fiction and fantasy.\n\nBy Daniel M. Kimmel Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nWhile doing a college humor column I was hoping to be the next Art Buchwald, but instead ended up first as a lawyer, then a film critic and college professor.

George Burns was perfectly cast but the reason God appears as a little old Jewish man is that he’s granting an interview to a Jewish freelance journalist, not a white bread grocery store clerk played by John Denver. This book taught me that a writer could be laugh out loud funny and still have something serious to say, something I’ve aspired to in my own fiction.\n\nBy Avery Corman,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Oh God as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nFor a God whom philosophers have proclaimed dead, it’s time for a little PR in this novel from the New York Times–bestselling author of Kramer vs. Kramer.\n\n“God grants you an interview. Go to 600 Madison Ave., room 3700, Monday, at 11 a.m.” When a struggling writer receives this typed note in the mail one morning, curiosity wins out and he finds himself keeping this mysterious appointment. Soon he’s in an ordinary conference room with an intercom on the floor, furiously scribbling shorthand notes as he interviews God, a deity who badly wants to improve His public profile. Sometimes God…\n\nPreview\n\nEnvoy to New Worlds\n\nBy Keith Laumer,\n\nFrom my list on humorous science fiction and fantasy.\n\nBy Daniel M. Kimmel Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nWhile doing a college humor column I was hoping to be the next Art Buchwald, but instead ended up first as a lawyer, then a film critic and college professor. When I finally got around to writing fiction, the blending of science fiction and comedy was a natural fit (with occasional forays into horror and fantasy). I’ve done four novels and a couple of dozen published stories to date and when readers tell me they’ve enjoyed them I answer, “If it made you laugh, I did my job.” When I came up with the mashup title of “Father of the Bride of Frankenstein” I said, “I have to write this.”\n\nDaniel's book list on humorous science fiction and fantasy\n\nWhy did Daniel love this book?\n\nLaumer’s satirical books about Jame Retief, a functionary in Corps Diplomatique Terrestrienne, were inspired by his real-life career in the U.S. Foreign Service. They don’t have to be read in any order and mix short stories (as in this collection) and novels. Much of the humor comes from Retief ignoring the diplomatic niceties in dealing with the problems involving Earth and various alien races.\n\nBy Keith Laumer,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Envoy to New Worlds as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nThe first-ever collection of Retief stories by Keith Laumer. Includes \"Protocol,\" \"Sealed Orders,\" \"Cultural Exchange,\" \"Aide Memoire,\" \"Policy,\" and \"Palace Revolution.\"\n\nPreview\n\nMartians Go Home\n\nBy Frederick Brown,\n\nWhy did Daniel love this book?\n\nBrown was another author who mixed SF and humor. Here he stood the alien invasion premise on its head. Instead of spaceships from an advanced civilization laying waste to our great cities, Brown wonders how we’d react if the invaders weren’t interested in mass murder or enslaving humanity but simply annoying the hell out of us. His little green men from Mars enjoy insulting and pestering Earthlings. After a while, “War of the Worlds” might be a preferable encounter.\n\nBy Frederick Brown,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Martians Go Home as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nTHEY WERE GREEN, THEY WERE LITTLE, THEY WERE BALD AS BILLIARD BALLS AND THEY WERE EVERYWHERE!\n\nLuke Devereaux was a science fiction writer, holed up in a desert shack waiting for inspiration. He was the first to see a Martian - but he certainly wasn't the last.\n\nIt was estimated that one billion of them had arrived - one to every three human beings on Earth. Obnoxious green creatures who could be seen and heard (but not harmed) and who probed private sex lives as shamelessly as they exposed government secrets.\n\nNo one knew why they had come. No one…\n\nPreview\n\nCentral Station\n\nBy Lavie Tidhar,\n\nWhy did Barbara love this book?\n\nIt’s hard to describe Lavie Tidhar’s Central Station, except to say that it is a fascinating study of various humans and non-humans residing—some permanently, some temporarily—in a hot, dusty spaceport/city that has sprung up between Tel Aviv and Jaffa sometime in our future. They confront questions and answers about family, memory, reality, and what is human—and occasionally come up with answers. A wonderfully written, almost hypnotic book.\n\nBy Lavie Tidhar,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n2 authors picked Central Station as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nAppeals to fans of classic and contemporary science fiction and mainstream fiction Contains international and multicultural themes Israeli-born author has also lived in Vanuatu, Laos, South Africa, Israel, and the UK\n\nPreview\n\nPeople of the Book\n\nBy Peter S. Beagle, Michael Chabon, Neil Gaiman , Lavie Tidhar , Tamar Yellin , Jane Yolen , Matthew Kressel\n\nWhy did Barbara love this book?\n\nIf Wandering Stars was the first short-story anthology to explore Jewish science fiction and fantasy, People of the Book is its descendant. This collection features a variety of stories by modern authors such as Jane Yolen, Theodora Goss, Neil Gaiman, and Michael Chabon, and is an excellent way to discover some of the talents that have emerged in the 21st century—and their approach to the Jewish religion, culture, and society.\n\nBy Peter S. Beagle, Michael Chabon, Neil Gaiman , Lavie Tidhar , Tamar Yellin , Jane Yolen , Matthew Kressel\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked People of the Book as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nFrom Sholom Aleichem to Avram Davidson, Isaac Bashevis Singer to Tony Kushner, the Jewish literary tradition has always been one rich in the supernatural and the fantastic. In these pages, gathered from the best short fiction of the last ten years, twenty authors prove that their heritage is alive and well - in the spaces between stars that an alphabet can bridge, folklore come to life and histories become stories, and all the places where old worlds and new collide and change.\n\nPreview\n\nRingworld\n\nBy Larry Niven,\n\nWhy did Stefan love this book?\n\nSet in man’s far future and vast in scope, I was plunged into this novel without managing to catch my breath. This is science fiction that epitomizes the best in the genre: a powerful story, strong characters, vast vision, and lots of drama.\n\nIt is a hard book to put down, and I did not want to! I enjoyed the intricate tapestry the story weaves and, importantly, entertains. The interaction between the main characters is vividly real, as are genuine emotions vented when it is revealed an alien species manipulated man’s development. I would be kind of sore at that as well. This novel left me appreciating powerful writing and gave me a lot to think about, influencing my own writing.\n\nBy Larry Niven,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n8 authors picked Ringworld as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nPierson's puppeteers, strange, three-legged, two-headed aliens, have discovered an immense structure in a hitherto unexplored part of the universe. Frightened of meeting the builders of such a structure, the puppeteers set about assembling a team consisting of two humans, a puppeteer and a kzin, an alien not unlike an eight-foot-tall, red-furred cat, to explore it. The artefact is a vast circular ribbon of matter, some 180 million miles across, with a sun at its centre - the Ringworld. But the expedition goes disastrously wrong when the ship crashlands and its motley crew faces a trek across thousands of miles of…\n\nPreview\n\nThe First Men in the Moon\n\nBy H. G. Wells,\n\nWhy did Michael love this book?\n\nI fell in love with this book when I was eleven years old, and I still love it now. That’s despite the fact that I now see just how corrupt and vicious the first human visitors to the moon truly are.\n\nYet there are moments here that still hold the old enchantment. There’s the instant when the \"hero\" grasps that night is falling on the moon, and as the shadow of a new, strange \"sunset\" starts to lengthen that he has perhaps only minutes to live, or there’s the encounter with the Selenites and the realization that he faces an absolutely alien consciousness with no connection to his own.\n\nNo-one outdoes Wells in making the fantastic utterly real to the reader.\n\nBy H. G. Wells,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked The First Men in the Moon as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nWhen penniless businessman Mr Bedford retreats to the Kent coast to write a play, he meets by chance the brilliant Dr Cavor, an absent-minded scientist on the brink of developing a material that blocks gravity. Cavor soon succeeds in his experiments, only to tell a stunned Bedford the invention makes possible one of the oldest dreams of humanity: a journey to the moon. With Bedford motivated by money, and Cavor by the desire for knowledge, the two embark on the expedition. But neither are prepared for what they find - a world of freezing nights, boiling days and sinister alien…\n\nPreview"
