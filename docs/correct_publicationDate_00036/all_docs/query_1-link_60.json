        "text": "This stellar collection of Jewish science fiction and fantasy carries on in the tradition of its companion volume―the enduring classic Wandering Stars―breaking new ground with every story.\n\nTrouble with mothers; invading aliens and demons; the arrival of the long-awaited Messiah ... all these phenomena and more are tackled in these tales from a creative group of extraordinary writers. We go to the edges of the universe, finding humor, pain and humanity in the unlikeliest of places and situations. Filled with wit, vigor and sharp insight, this is a fantastic feast for the imagination that will intrigue and delight everyone who picks it up, Jew and non-Jew alike.\n\nJack Dann has written and edited over sixty books, including Wandering Stars: An Anthology of Jewish Fantasy and Science Fiction; More Wandering Stars: An Anthology of Outstanding Stories of Jewish Fantasy and Science Fiction (Jewish Lights); and the international bestselling novel about Leonardo da Vinci, The Memory Cathedral. Already translated into ten languages, The Memory Cathedral won Australia's Aurealis Award and a selection won the coveted Nebula Award. He lives in Australia on a farm overlooking the sea and \"commutes\" back and forth to Los Angeles and New York. Visit his website at www.jackdann.com.\n\nJack Dann is available to speak on the following topics:\n\nJewish Science Fiction? How Can That Be, and What Can It So That Regular Jewish Fiction Can't?\n\nExploring the Holocaust through the Lens of the Fantastic\n\nI Am Jewish Enough! The Iconoclastic Mumblings of a Cultural Jew\n\nMy Rabbi Is an Alien: How to Write and Read Jewish Science Fiction"
