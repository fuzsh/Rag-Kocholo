        "text": "Tommy Orange’s new novel Wandering Stars is a follow up to his critically acclaimed novel There There. In this installment, readers learn how events long before There There‘s explosive climax influenced, and continue to influence, the Red Feather and Bear Shield families.\n\nThis constellation of narratives spans time, beginning on the morning of the Sand Creek Massacre and continuing into present day. Readers see the buildup of intergenerational trauma, but also how being split from community can be temporary. Each generation learns and decides what it means for them to be Indian, to be Native, to be Cheyenne.\n\nOrange confronts head on the repercussions of what has been done to Native peoples again and again, as massacres, prison, Indian boarding schools, and restrictive laws worked, and continue to work, to force assimilation on Native peoples.\n\nBy focusing in on one family, Orange demonstrates how each generation grapples with similar themes of cultural disconnect, reconnection, addiction, and healing.\n\nBoth a prequel and a sequel, this work weaves together with There There to give readers deep insight into the characters. The character development and voice are absolutely incredible, each thoroughly developed and changing over time as the young narrators grow and the two grandmothers age.\n\nThe pacing is incredible, as Orange takes readers from the mid-1800s through time to present day, with each time period being equally riveting and character-focused.\n\nOrange examines themes of addiction and sobriety intertwined with history, intergenerational trauma, and healing, it is also full of heart. Readers see how love is expressed, how healing happens, and witnessing these healing journeys is a gift. This novel deals with so many hard topics yet maintains a hopeful tone.\n\nHealing is sacred, and witnessing this family heal, person by person, through the generations is healing in itself for the reader. As a mixed heritage Native woman with mixed heritage Native kids, books by Native authors discussing Native experiences are close to my heart. Tommy Orange’s work is meaningful, and takes an unflinching look at what has been done to Native peoples, how we’ve persevered and continued on, in a fictitious realm. I especially appreciate how Orange shows Orvil learning the names of all the Native Nations, federally recognized and otherwise, on his healing journey. Each Nation has its own culture, language, and ways of being. And of course, all of this is done with incredible writing.\n\nWado, Tommy Orange, for another beautiful and important work.\n\nThank you to the author, Knopf, and NetGalley for an advanced digital ARC such that I could share my honest opinion. All thoughts and opinions are my own."
