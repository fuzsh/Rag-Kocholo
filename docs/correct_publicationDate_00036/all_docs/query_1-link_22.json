        "text": "This stellar collection of Jewish science fiction and fantasy carries on in the tradition of its companion volumeâ€”the enduring classic Wandering Stars â€”breaking new ground with every story.\n\nTrouble with mothers; invading aliens and demons; the arrival of the long-awaited Messiah... all these phenomena and more are tackled in these tales from a creative group of extraordinary writers. We go to the edges of the universe, finding humor, pain and humanity in the unlikeliest of places and situations. Filled with wit, vigor and sharp insight, this is a fantastic feast for the imagination that will intrigue and delight everyone who picks it up, Jew and non-Jew alike."
