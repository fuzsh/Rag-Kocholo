In 1988, Mary recorded a version of Anita Baker’s “Caught Up in the Rapture” at a kiosk in a mall.

Mary’s debut, 1992’s What’s The 411?, signaled a new era in R&B. Her single, “You Remind Me,” was a number one hit. Her second album, My Life, is considered one of the Greatest Albums of all time. She also topped the charts with her collaboration with Method Man on the song, “All I Need.” Since her debut, Mary has been nominated for a record-setting 30 Grammy awards, and she has won nine. She is one of few entertainers to have eight or more albums reach multi-platinum status. She made her acting debut in 1998, appearing on The Jamie Foxx Show. She has also acted in movies like Prison Song, on shows like Empire and in plays like The Exonerated. In 2015, she was cast as Evillene in NBC’s The Wiz Live!
