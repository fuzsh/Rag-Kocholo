What have you learned since being in the office and what impact would you like to see in the community?\n\nI have learned three important things along my journey: 1) the importance and power of compromising your positions, but not your principles, 2) respecting the views of others, and 3) you should be willing to change your mind when new information is presented that requires a change.\n\nI hope my impact will be to help people understand that voting matters, and who sits in these positions truly matters because our policies come from the people who hold elected office.\n\n2. Why is it important that we celebrate Black History Month?\n\nBlack History month gives an opportunity to focus on the fact that Black History is American history, and to not only remember the strife and the struggle, but also the hope, innovation, aspiration, and perseverance for a more perfect union.\n\n3. Why should Black New Yorkers 50 plus get involved in public policy decisions?\n\nBlack New Yorkers who are 50+ have lived history, a history which limited opportunity in voting rights, reproductive rights, and economic advancement. We have made progress, but we also understand how easy the progress can be lost if we don’t continue to educate and stay in the forefront of public discourse and policy.\n\n4. We have just celebrated the 50th Anniversary of Hip-Hop and we highlight the importance of African American/Black influences. What impact has Hip Hop had on you and on this country and beyond?\n\nI grew up in the Bronx, the birthplace of Hip Hop. Now, it is an internationally recognized and celebrated genre. Hip Hop has been and always will be synonymous with New York and Black culture. In 2022, the legislature awarded the Hip Hop museum $11 million, to show our commitment to celebrating the rich history and cultural importance of this genre. Hip Hop often tells the story of personal experiences, self-determination, ambition, pride, and power. I am proud to represent an area that raised Mary J. Blige, DMX, who would often return to support his neighborhood, and the Lox. In fact, it has been my privilege to work with Jadakiss and Styles P on things such as distributing turkeys at Thanksgiving and educating members of our community on healthy lifestyles and the benefits of juicing at their store in Yonkers, Juices for Life. When we took over the Majority I reminded myself and my conference of how far we had come with the words of Drake, “Started from the bottom now we’re here.” Half a century later, despite all odds, this genre is still here and it is still shaping opinions and providing opportunities for expression, education, and success.\n\nAssemblywoman\n\nKimberly Jean-Pierre\n\nAssembly District 11\n\n1. What have you learned since being in the office and what impact would you like to see in the community?\n\nFirst, all politics is local. I have learned that you need to be flexible in your thinking as an elected official or person in any position of power. Certain skills are necessary, including keeping an open mind and being creative in thinking about how to accomplish goals. Getting new legislation passed can be a very slow process. However, working with constituents and being on the ground in your community has an immediate impact. One of the most important and rewarding roles is connecting people with resources.\n\nThere are many important issues at stake, our educational system and ensuring that all students, regardless of what hamlet or zip code they live in, have equal opportunities and access to an excellent education and a variety of community resources. There are a number of other equity issues in the community. Transportation continues to be an issue for many. We need comprehensive, frequent, accessible and affordable public transportation options that covers all of Long Island. Equity in healthcare is also another impact area that is important to me. We continue to need more resources for support services and preventions services in the community. There are many community organizations doing great work to address these issues. I would like to see more organizations working together collaboratively to obtain funding for projects that support these community initiatives.\n\n2. Why is it important that we celebrate Black History Month?\n\nBlack History is American history, but we are not yet in a place in this country where Black History is celebrated as American History. We need to continue to highlight the progress and success of the Black community, including past leaders and community advocates, but we also need to acknowledge and address the challenges still faced by the Black communities and the many areas of inequality that exist. There are striking disparities in our communities in healthcare, education and many other areas including representation by elected officials.\n\n3. Why should Black New Yorkers 50 plus get involved in public policy decisions?\n\n50+ New Yorkers have life experience and wisdom. A variety of diverse 50+ voices and experiences brings the best policy outcomes. Encouraging younger generations to work with and learn from older New Yorkers is important for policy making because this collaboration leads to greater success. Intergenerational communication is very important.\n\n4. We have just celebrated the 50th Anniversary of Hip-Hop. What impact has Hip Hop had on you and on this country and beyond?\n\nI grew up in the city. I grew up with artists talking about various issues that plagued our community. It was not until I got older that I understood true impact of hip hop on the community and the world. Hip Hop is part of the Black American culture and it vocally defines the struggles of Black Americans in this country. It is an outlet and a voice and provided a stage for global community to learn more about the culture and experiences of Black Americans.\n\nAssemblywoman\n\nCrystal D. Peoples-Stokes\n\nAssembly District 141\n\n1. What have you learned since being in the office and what impact would you like to see in the community?\n\nI’ve learned the value of being a public servant and problem solver. Our communities have a lot of needs and concerns, in many cases, government is the first line for access to information, assistance with services, and much more.\n\n2. Why is it important that we celebrate Black History Month?\n\nIf we don’t know our past, we cannot prosper in the future. We are a brilliant people and need to properly educate ourselves and acknowledge our societal accomplishments.\n\n3. Why should Black New Yorkers 50 plus get involved in public policy decisions?\n\nIf you are not at the table, your issues and concerns won’t be discussed.\n\n4. We have just celebrated the 50th Anniversary of Hip-Hop. What impact has Hip Hop had on you and on this country and beyond?\n\nHip Hop is a genre created by blacks for blacks, which spoke to our experience of living in America for over 50yrs. It’s become iconic internationally, when most thought it was just a fad and wouldn’t last. Hip Hop has generated billions of dollars in entertainment, merchandising, marketing, and more."
