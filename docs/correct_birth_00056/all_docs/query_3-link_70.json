        "text": "Over a decade ago, R&B legend Mary J. Blige purchased a mega-mansion in Saddle River, New Jersey, for $12.3 million.\n\nSurrounded by famous neighbors and measuring at 18,250-square-foot, Blige ultimately placed the estate back on the market for $13.9 million in 2011. But, the house didn’t sell.\n\nThe nine-time Grammy winner had money troubles after her divorce from her manager Kendu Isaacs, including a $900,000 tax lien from the state of New Jersey, since cleared up, and a $3.4 million federal tax lien, which was still unpaid in 2013.\n\nDon’t miss an issue of our FREE Mosaic newsletter!

However, the price decreased even further to $6.8 million, in 2019.\n\nUltimately, the 25-room property didn’t secure a buyer until 2020. The mansion was sold for $5.5 million, roughly a $7 million loss.\n\nThe property includes eight bedrooms, 10 full bathrooms and tons of amenities including but not exclusive to a gym, sauna and gorgeous in-ground pool.\n\nBlige also owns another New Jersey home in Cresskill that she has also been trying to sell since 2019. Initially, the property’s sale price was $2.25 million, but the estate was last listed at $2.75 million, according to realtor.com.\n\nShe bought her Cresskill property in 2001 for $1.95 million. The spacious house features six bedrooms, eight full bathrooms, and two half-bathrooms.\n\nOn 7,000 square feet, the huge home on 1.1 acres offers a gym, guest quarters, an office, and three fireplaces. In addition, the floor plan includes a finished basement, as well as an attached garage, according to realtor.com.\n\nSo far, Blige’s Cresskill house has not been sold.\n\nHere are more related stories:\n\nMissy Elliot announces tour with Busta Rhymes & Ciara.
