Blige, will be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\n\nJessica McMullen\n\n•\n\nApr 23, 2024, 1:08 AM\n\n•\n\nUpdated 88 days ago\n\nShare:\n\nThe Yonkers community is celebrating a momentous day as it was announced that singer, songwriter, and actress, Mary J. Blige, will be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\n\nThe Hall of Fame credits her with singlehandedly starting the ‘hip-hop soul’ genre. With 37 Grammy nominations and nine wins, Blige has spearheaded the genre and has often been referred to as the “Queen of Hip-Hop Soul” and “Queen of R&B.”\n\nThe 53-year-old’s career began in 1998 when she was signed to Uptown Records. Blige made a name for herself by becoming both Uptown Records’ youngest and first female artist.\n\nNews 12’s Carol Wilkinson went to Blige’s former home and spoke with friends who knew she would make it big."
