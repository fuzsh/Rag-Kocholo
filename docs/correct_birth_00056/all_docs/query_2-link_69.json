A lush build-your-own bouquet bar allows the romantics to hand pick their favorite blooms from an array of seasonal flowers and verdant accents to create distinct floral arrangements reflective of their unique style.\n\nGuests can explore “Mary’s Living Room,” a welcoming sanctuary featuring the varietals of the Sun Goddess wine collection, Sister Love’s bold jewelry designs and the specially made Strength of a Woman merch. They’ll also immerse themselves in the music and memories of Mary J. Blige’s “My Life” in our custom listening booth, created as a special tribute to the 30th anniversary of the iconic album.\n\nIn addition to Pepsi’s Dig In Village, Mielle’s beauty carousel boasts hair demos and services with an onsite hairstylist and giveaways of their must-have products. Verizon Business is also inviting attendees to delve into the brand’s suite of small business offerings while also enjoying complimentary charging services of their mobile devices.\n\nCreated and curated by the iconic GRAMMY award-winning singer and songwriter, Mary J. Blige, Strength of a Woman Festival and Summit is the only festival experience in the market, brought to you exclusively by an all-Black, female team, and will arrive this spring to the birthplace of Hip-Hop, New York City. After selling out in less than 72 hours last year, the festival will bring, what is sure to be, iconic moments with three incredible nights of music and entertainment."
