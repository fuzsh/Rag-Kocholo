        "text": "Congratulations to Gayle King! The 69-year-old co-anchor of CBS Mornings was surprised to learn that she is among the cover girls for the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit’s special 60th anniversary edition. Additional models on the cover Kate Upton and Hunter McGrady surprised King with the news on her show May 14. King clapped right away and asked, “I’m on the cover?” She continued, “They told me I was just going to be on the inside. I just never saw myself this way. I still don’t see myself this way. But when I look at that….I go, I look good.” King is also featured in the Sports Illustrated Legends edition. Meanwhile, Oprah Winfrey’s BFF also became a grandmother for the second time on May 12 when her daughter Kirby Bumpus and her husband, Virgil Miller, welcomed their second child, a daughter, Grayson, who joins big brother, Luca. King posted on social media, it was the “best Mother’s Day ever.” ……\n\nHarlem-based fashion designer Edwing D’Angelo collaborated with New York City Council Speaker Adrienne Eadie Adams, whom he had the honor of dressing her for the Met Gala 2024 on May 6, at The Metropolitan Museum of Art. D’Angelo envisioned an ensemble for Speaker Adams that encapsulates the ethereal elegance of a Palladian villa’s enchanted garden, with lush hues of tulip hues and the delicate translucence of petals. This year’s Met Gala theme was “The Garden of Time,” which drew from the Costume Institute’s exhibit “Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion.”…….\n\nLegendary R&B/LGBTQ+ Singer/Songwriter Monifah, released a new single “Testify” on all music platforms on May 10. “Testify” is from Monifah’s album “Grace at Midnight” on Quantize recordings which comes out in early Fall 2024. The single is written and co-produced by Monifah and Grammy nominated artist Anthony Giles. Said Monifah, “I’m thrilled to share ‘Testify’ with the world. This song represents a new chapter for me, where I embrace different musical styles that resonate with my spirit. My new music project ‘Grace at Midnight’ is a testament to my growth as an artist and a celebration of life’s diverse rhythms.” It has been nine years since Monifah released her last single “One Moment” …..\n\nOn May 10, Mary J. Blige and Pepsi kicked off the third annual Strength of a Woman Festival and Summit, in partnership with Live Nation Urban, with an intimate welcome soiree at Corner Social in Harlem. DJ’ed by Funkmaster Flex, followed by a sold-out jazz concert headlined by Robert Glasper at the Blue Note in New York City’s Greenwich Village. Blige joined Glasper onstage for a short chat. Notable celebrities in attendance included Tiffany Haddish, Tasha Smith and Bryan-Michael Cox……"
