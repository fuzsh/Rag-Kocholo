        "text": "“This is what New York City feel like and sound like,” Funkmaster Flex exclaimed, one recent night on Hot 97. For thirty years, Flex has been New York’s most prominent hip-hop radio d.j., tasked with figuring out what might be popular and then telling people what should be popular—turning audience research into a series of definitive statements, delivered so volubly and so frequently that he sometimes drowns out the music. On this night, Flex was drowning out a new track, “City of Gods,” which seemed sure to become a local favorite. “Fivio, I see you,” Flex said, calling out the rapper behind the track. A few years ago, Fivio Foreign was just one more guy from Brooklyn mean-mugging into the camera in a bunch of YouTube videos. Now he is emerging as the kind of reliable hip-hop star that New York, not too long ago, seemed to have stopped producing.\n\n“City of Gods” had a chorus by Alicia Keys, singing, “New York City, please go easy on this heart of mine.” It had a newsworthy verse, in which Ye, formerly known as Kanye West, threatened the “Saturday Night Live” star Pete Davidson, who was dating his ex, Kim Kardashian: “This afternoon / A hundred goons / Pulling up to ‘S.N.L.’ ” Most important, it had Fivio Foreign, who staged a self-coronation in the track’s opening lines:\n\nNigga, this my shit\n\nWelcome to the city of gods\n\nPop was the king of New York\n\nNow I’m the nigga in charge.\n\n“Pop,” as just about every listener would have known, was Pop Smoke, an ally and friend of Fivio who was approaching mainstream stardom when he was murdered, in February, 2020; his first album, released posthumously, made its début at No. 1 on the Billboard chart. Pop Smoke was about a decade younger than Fivio Foreign, who just turned thirty-two. But he got famous first, and took a fraternal interest in Fivio’s career: he tried, unsuccessfully, to get the label that signed him to sign Fivio, too, and when he travelled to the Hot 97 studios for an interview, in 2019, he included Fivio in his entourage.\n\nNowadays, it is Fivio who has an entourage, and one evening this spring he paid a visit to Funkmaster Flex with a few friends in tow. Flex was prerecording segments in a nondescript Chelsea office building; Fivio and friends were shown to a rather desolate hospitality room, which was full of Cîroc vodka decorations yet surprisingly bereft of the product itself. Someone procured a bottle of champagne, but Fivio was not particularly interested—he prides himself on professionalism, and, although he has rapped enthusiastically about intoxicants ranging from Hennessy to Percocet, he says that he is more focussed on success these days.\n\n[Support The New Yorker’s award-winning journalism. Subscribe today »]\n\nThe spelling of “Fivio” is slightly misleading: the name derives from an old nickname, Fabio, bestowed by a friend who noticed that women found him charming, and so it is pronounced “Favio,” though people who know him tend to drop the last letter or two. He is more than six feet tall and lanky, and he was wearing a red nylon windbreaker by the French fashion house Celine, with matching jeans, and enough jewelry to make it clear which of the guys milling around was the star. Funkmaster Flex greeted him with a friendly scowl and then, before the interview began, delivered a brief update on “City of Gods.”\n\n“It’s picking up in the club,” Flex said, conspiratorially, as if he were sharing classified information.\n\n“That’s what we need,” Fivio replied. “We need that club.”\n\nFivio’s music can sound as if it were purpose-built for club sound systems: it is up-tempo, with tricky drum programming, bass lines that zoom unpredictably from note to note, and plenty of shouted interjections. But Fivio’s form of hip-hop is less closely associated with clubs than with the streets of Brooklyn, where he shot a number of his early videos, and with YouTube, where those videos often went viral. (“Viral” is one of his favorite words.) The style that made Fivio a star is known as drill music, which even more than other forms of hip-hop has been linked to gangs and violence. Pop Smoke and Fivio Foreign were on the same side in a kind of civil war that turned the dizzying patchwork of Brooklyn street gangs into a murderously simple rivalry between two confederations. Pop Smoke’s killing was apparently unrelated to this war; he was the victim of a botched robbery during a trip to Los Angeles. (It seems that the invaders found Pop by zooming in on an address label in a video that he posted, showing off a delivery from Amiri, which sells expensive jeans that are popular among New York rappers.) But his career was tightly connected to the war: the first Pop Smoke mixtape was called “Meet the Woo”—a reference to one of the two confederations. Similarly, Fivio’s breakthrough track was “Blixky Inna Box.” A “blicky” is a gun, but “Blixky”—the “x” is silent—is the name of a crew that was on the other side of the divide; the track functioned as an extended provocation.\n\nEarlier this year, a pair of high-profile shootings focussed political attention on this world. In January, a rapper named Nas Blixky survived being shot in the Brooklyn neighborhood of Prospect-Lefferts Gardens. The next week, TDott Woo, who was known for his dance moves in videos by Pop Smoke and Fivio Foreign, was killed in Canarsie. Soon afterward, Mayor Eric Adams held a press conference in which he called drill music “alarming,” and suggested that certain violent music videos be removed from social media in the name of public safety, much as President Donald Trump had been removed from Twitter. Adams convened a summit with a number of the city’s leading rappers, including Fivio, who sat at the Mayor’s right elbow, and who apparently made no promises—he is obligated, he says, to do no more and no less than talk about his life. “Niggas always talking about what’s going on in the hood, or what they’re going through in their life,” Fivio told Flex, when asked about the summit. “That’s what’s gon’ happen, regardless.”\n\nIn recent years, many hip-hop hits have been druggy and escapist. (In the chorus of “Lemonade,” one of the most popular tracks of 2020, the rapper and singer Don Toliver howled about getting high and buying a convertible: “Off the juice, codeine got me trippin’ / Copped the coupe—woke up, roof is missin’.”) Fivio belongs to a less fanciful tradition, and his success may mean that the hip-hop pendulum is swinging back, as it periodically does, toward tougher, scrappier characters. In hip-hop, street credibility can be an important narrative asset—a way of convincing listeners that the stories they’re hearing aren’t just stories.\n\nLike any successful rapper, though, Fivio is using hip-hop not just to chronicle his surroundings but also to change them. He has moved, with his three children, to an undisclosed location on the far side of the Hudson River, and his rhymes have grown a bit less bloodthirsty and a lot more ruminative. Earlier this month, he released his first proper album, “B.I.B.L.E.,” for which Ye served as the executive producer, and which aims to convert listeners who do not spend their free time trying to decode the intricacies of New York gang alliances. Pop Smoke was a gnomic figure with a rich, booming voice; Fivio is less enigmatic but more entertaining, a charismatic and sometimes witty host who wants to keep everyone happy. “This shit sound like growth,” he exclaims, near the beginning of the album, which strikes an effective balance between thoughtfulness and recklessness. “Don’t mistake me for a different nigga,” he raps. “If I tell ’em to work, they’ll clip a nigga / If I take me a Perc, I’ll forget the nigga.”\n\nTwice in the past two years, Fivio’s rise has been interrupted by allegations of criminal behavior. In 2020, he was arrested for assault, after an altercation with a woman he was dating, who was pregnant with his third child. She later announced that she didn’t want Fivio to be prosecuted, and he claimed that the encounter was merely a loud argument. He still faces charges for an incident last year in New Jersey, when he was approached by police and fled. He was caught and, after a scuffle, arrested; police found a loaded gun with a defaced serial number. But he says that he has learned the importance of staying out of trouble: for someone like him, that means hiring professional security guards and steering clear of Brooklyn. “I don’t miss nothing from my old life,” he told me. But he can’t afford to stop rapping about it—not yet.\n\n“I was raised the right way,” Fivio says. He grew up, as Maxie Ryles III, in a neighborhood known as the Nine: a slanted rectangle of blocks (including Ninety-first through Ninety-sixth Streets) affixed to the northeast corner of East Flatbush, dotted with Caribbean storefronts and neat little apartment buildings that are worth significantly more now than they were when Fivio was a boy. His father was a military veteran who remained married to his mother, a special-education aide, until her death, from a stroke, in 2016, which Fivio describes as the defining tragedy of his life. Despite his stable upbringing, he was intrigued by high-school classmates who disappeared for long stretches and then reappeared with better clothes than he could afford. And so he disappeared, too. (He eventually earned his diploma through a summer program.) “I was outside,” he says. “Making some money here and there.” As he remembers it, gang membership literally came with the territory. “It was no question of affiliation,” he says. “You’re from here? This is what it is.”\n\nWhen Fivio says that he avoids Brooklyn, he means the Brooklyn where he grew up; he had no problem travelling, with his security detail, to an Episcopal church in Park Slope, six consequential stops on the 3 train from his old neighborhood. His record label, Columbia, had rented the church to shoot a promotional video for “B.I.B.L.E.” (Fivio’s family was Pentecostal, but he says that his album is Biblical only insofar as it offers stories—ostensibly true ones—that listeners can learn from.) At a long table in the sacristy, he posed with a chalice of cranberry juice, and then, after changing into Gucci track pants and a matching shirt, he found a place in the dusty church kitchen, where he was supplied with a legal pad and a pencil. Fivio adopted a thoughtful expression and, for the benefit of the cameras, did something he almost never does: he wrote down some of his lyrics. “I ain’t even realize I was in Brooklyn,” he said later.\n\nWhen the shoot was over, Fivio’s ride—an S.U.V. with L.E.D. lights in the ceiling, which fans may recognize from his Instagram videos—was waiting outside, and he moved quickly to get in. Not quickly enough, though, to escape the attention of a woman in the next car, with multicolored fingernails and an embarrassed smile. “I love you, Fivio,” she told him.\n\nAs she recorded on her phone, Fivio leaned in through the window and asked her favorite song.\n\n“Right now, it gotta be ‘Self Made,’ ” she said, naming a track that has more than ten million views on YouTube but has never been released to streaming services, let alone radio stations.\n\n“Boom!” Fivio said, firing an imaginary gun at the phone. “Good choice.”\n\nOnce Fivio had left, the woman began to cry. “Oh, shit,” she said, covering her mouth with her hand and still recording. “Where the fuck he just came from?”\n\nFivio Foreign has many Brooklyn hip-hop forebears, none more important than the Notorious B.I.G. and Jay-Z, who enacted their own succession drama a quarter of a century ago. They were both from Bedford-Stuyvesant, friends and friendly rivals. After the 1997 murder of B.I.G., who was one of the most beloved rappers in New York’s history, Jay-Z replaced him as the biggest name in town, rapping, “I’m the focal point, like Biggie in his prime / On the low, though—shhh!—the city is mine.”\n\nBy the time Fivio got serious about rapping, in the twenty-tens, Atlanta was establishing itself as the new hip-hop capital, and New York rappers sometimes struggled to keep pace with Southern styles. New York’s hip-hop renaissance began, indirectly, in Chicago, where a generation of teen-age performers created a startlingly unfiltered subgenre that came to be known as drill music. Chief Keef was only sixteen when he released, in 2012, a transfixing video for a track called “I Don’t Like.” Keef and his friends crowded into an unfurnished apartment, waving guns in time to an ominous, chiming beat fit for a funeral procession. Chief Keef reeled off threats and complaints, sounding like a teen-ager with nothing to lose: “Playing both sides, shit that I don’t like / Wartime, spark broad day, all night.” The track was claustrophobic, but pleasurably so, and it became a sensation: Kanye West organized a remix, and major labels signed Keef and several other Chicago rappers. Something about the music captured the attention, too, of young people around the world. In the South London neighborhood of Brixton Hill, a crew of rappers called 67 began making low-budget drill videos of their own, livening up the Chicago template with skippy rhythms and sliding bass lines.\n\nThe pioneers of Brooklyn drill tended not to be scholars of British musical history: by all accounts, they typed “drill beats” into YouTube and rapped over whatever they found. A producer known as AXL was a teen-ager in London when he noticed that Brooklynites were using the work he posted, and sometimes drawing digital crowds. “It was a shock,” AXL told me. “I’m all the way in London, and they’re hopping on my beats!” Some of the rappers had no idea that AXL was British until they called to invite him to the studio.\n\nOne drill convert was a boyish, verbose Flatbush rapper named 22Gz, who turned one of AXL’s compositions into an incendiary track called “Suburban.” The title described not 22Gz’s surroundings but, rather, his preferred getaway vehicle: “Pull up in all-black Suburbans / If he ain’t dead, we reversin’ / Blixky gang, know we gon’ murk him.” Fivio, too, began using beats by AXL and other British drill producers. He had been rapping for a few years, releasing rather generic home-town hip-hop, to little notice, but the new beats made him sound somehow both more serious and more playful. AXL, working from across the Atlantic, has since produced some of Fivio’s best-known records.\n\nBrooklyn drill, like hip-hop itself, was often mistaken for a passing fad, and some of the rough-and-tumble Brooklyn rappers who proliferated in the twenty-tens sought to assure listeners that they weren’t merely drill rappers. Pop Smoke took the opposite approach: encouraged by Steven Victor, the executive who signed him, he released two mixtapes filled with beats by 808 Melo, another U.K. drill producer, intending to make himself the face of the movement before branching out. Pop Smoke did not live long enough to see this plan to completion, but Fivio has adopted a similar strategy, becoming the obvious choice for musicians seeking an infusion of drill energy. He appears on recent releases by Drake and Mary J. Blige, and on a current single by Nicki Minaj, who did more than anyone else to boost New York hip-hop during the fallow years. After Ye heard some Fivio tracks that he liked, he texted Fivio to see if he could call, and then started rapping over the phone, asking Fivio his opinion. Fivio wasn’t sure what to think, but Ye followed up by sending a jet to bring him to Mercedes-Benz Stadium, in Atlanta, where he was finishing his 2021 album, “Donda.” (The resulting collaboration, “Off the Grid,” was one of the album’s highlights.) Fivio is convinced, not unreasonably, that the fearsome sound of drill is more versatile than people think it is: his new album includes a lighthearted drill love song based on a snippet of “Say My Name,” by Destiny’s Child. Instead of leaving drill behind on his journey toward mainstream success, Fivio is trying to take it with him.\n\nDrill, in the hip-hop sense, is not just a genre name but also a verb. “Since a young’un, I been drillin’,” Pop Smoke announced, in “Welcome to the Party,” the 2019 track that made him a star, and you could almost picture him wielding his weapon like a power tool. A close association with violence has always been part of drill music’s appeal: like the so-called gangsta rappers of the nineteen-nineties, these performers offer listeners the thrill of immersion in a violent world, without promising to make things better—and frequently promising to make things worse.\n\nIt’s easy to forget how controversial gangsta rap once was. Snoop Dogg is now widely regarded as a lovable uncle, and many of the people who enjoyed his whimsical Olympic-highlights show with Kevin Hart were probably unaware that in 1993, shortly before the release of his début album, he was arrested for the murder of a man reputed to be a member of a rival gang. (He was later acquitted.) Snoop’s rhymes, full of sex and violence, inspired broad condemnation; C. DeLores Tucker, a civil-rights advocate, became a news fixture for leading protests against him and other objectionable rappers. But his threats were generally of the vague, “don’t make me have to grab my strap” variety, and in those early years he alluded only obliquely to his affiliation with a local Crip gang.\n\nThe drill generation tended to be more forthright, partly because social media enabled rappers to communicate more directly with both their allies and their enemies, whom they refer to as “opps.” Not long after “I Don’t Like” was released, a rapper named Lil JoJo posted a track insulting Chief Keef’s crew. A few months later, he was shot to death, and a sarcastic eulogy was posted on Keef’s Twitter: “Its Sad Cuz Dat Nigga Jojo Wanted To Be Jus Like Us #LMAO.” (Keef later claimed that he had been hacked, and no one has been charged in JoJo’s death.) In the years that followed, something like a dozen Chicago drill rappers were killed, a figure that reflected both the astonishing level of violence on the city’s streets and the democratizing nature of the music—it sometimes seemed as if every streetwise young person in Chicago were a rapper.\n\nFivio says that he wasn’t in a particularly angry frame of mind when he recorded “Blixky Inna Box.” He was just following the traditional logic of hip-hop. “They”—the Blixkys—“was dissing the hood, dissing people I know,” he said. So he responded the way any rapper would: “twice as hard, twice as disrespectful, twice as fire.” The video, shot by a drill auteur known as Flowtastic, shows Fivio and his allies in a spartan building lobby and on an empty playground; there are no visible guns but plenty of gang signs. The exuberant chorus puns on “Blixky,” pairing it with another synonym for a firearm: “Got a brand new chop / That’s a Blixky inna box.”\n\nThere were other, overlapping gang identifiers. Some of Fivio’s enemies were affiliated with the Gangster Disciples, who originated in Chicago and spread nationwide, so Fivio identified himself as “G.D.K.,” which stands for “Gangster Disciple killer.” And he mentioned, offhandedly, that he and his confederates were the “flyest Crips in the game, flag tied around the leg,” pointing to a blue bandanna above his left knee. As the video went viral, he thought that he saw an uptick in the number of young men in Brooklyn wearing the same bandanna in the same way.\n\nFivio has mixed feelings about the complicated role that gangs have played in his life. His new album includes “Left Side,” a coded oath of allegiance to the Crips, recorded with the like-minded Los Angeles rapper Blueface. But one day, sprawled on a couch in a Columbia Records conference room, surrounded by photographs of Billy Joel and Bruce Springsteen, he told me—using the kind of hypothetical language favored by people with reason to avoid unequivocal admissions—that the reality of gang life was often miserable. “Somebody might get in a situation, and you don’t know nothing about it, but you’ve got to deal with it,” he said. “It gives you no soul, almost. ’Cause you not fighting for nothing you believe in.” By the time “Blixky Inna Box” took off, in 2018, he had two daughters and no fixed address, and he is aware of the irony: the track that helped him escape old neighborhood beefs also made his name synonymous with neighborhood beefs. In the aftermath of the killings earlier this year, a Hot 97 host named DJ Drewski made an announcement on Instagram: “I will not support or play anymore Diss/Gang records on the radio! We r losing too many young men and women to the streets!” He later explained that he would continue to support drill music, just not tracks in which rappers taunted their opps.\n\nThis, more or less, is how the music industry responded to gangsta rap some thirty years ago. Radio stations, video networks, and record labels adopted a system of soft censorship: guns were blurred out of music videos, and soon omitted altogether; “radio versions” of songs were stripped of curse words and of the N-word, along with references to violence and drugs. This system is now so familiar that listeners barely seem to notice. The radio version of “Big Drip,” one of Fivio’s biggest tracks, features the line “Crip sh[obscured] / She wanna suck on a [obscured].”\n\nBut it’s hard to imagine that this sort of censorship makes much difference, especially since impressionable young listeners have so many options besides terrestrial radio. Censoring rappers on social media, as Mayor Adams suggested, would be difficult and controversial. After the killing of Fivio’s friend TDott Woo, a Brooklyn drill pioneer named Rowdy Rebel vowed, in a YouTube video, “I ain’t posting up no pictures of my bro TDott / ’Til a body drop—spin, go get your G-lock.” And 22Gz, who is on the other side of the great divide, released a track in which he celebrated the death of an unnamed foe: “Sniper Blixky, I’m a gremlin: get a rush, my opps die / He was dissin’ on the dead—now he the one on Fox 5.” But Fivio’s response has been notably restrained, and he suggested that revenge was not the best way to honor slain friends like TDott. He thought, “What would my dog want me to do? How would my dog want me living?”\n\nBy the time the Mayor called his summit, in February, Brooklyn drill had spawned a new variant: Bronx drill, in which the stars were younger, the rapping shoutier, and the filmed provocations more brazen. One of the most notorious figures is Kay Flock, eighteen, who last summer released a thrilling, raw-throated statement of purpose called “Is Ya Ready” (twenty-four million views and counting). Kay Flock was also known for videos in which he drove into enemy territory, daring the opps to confront him. He was arrested in December and charged with killing a man after a brief altercation on the sidewalk, but, after pleading not guilty at his arraignment in March, he is more popular than ever. He recently collaborated with the borough’s biggest hip-hop star, Cardi B, making her drill début—though she had to shoot the music video without him. Earlier this month, the Bronx District Attorney indicted the rapper Lee Drilly and nineteen others, on charges linked to a series of murders and assaults; the office noted that the defendants were “prominent in the Drill rap scene.”\n\nThe pastor Louis Straker is a member of the 67th Precinct Clergy Council, also known as the God Squad, which aims to quell gun violence in East Flatbush and the surrounding area. He is taken aback by what he calls the “spirit of lawlessness” in the neighborhood, and by the sanguinary music that it has produced, although he acknowledges that it is hard to establish correlation, let alone causation. (According to police statistics, the precinct’s homicide rate is less than half of what it was in the early nineties, even as the city’s total shootings have risen in the past few years.) No doubt, anyone who loves this music would happily give it up if that would end the killing. The tragedy of drill music is not that there is a market for it but that there is a context for it. In the meantime, perhaps it is possible to hear drill music as proof of the stubborn persistence not just of violence but of poetry, too. A half century after hip-hop was born, young people in some of the country’s roughest neighborhoods still feel moved to write and deliver rhymes about what’s on their minds.\n\nOne of Fivio’s managers is Jerry Reefer, a well-connected guy who spent his boyhood in Trinidad and in Jamaica, and who didn’t realize the significance of his surname until he arrived in Queens and people began to snicker. Reefer met Fivio through a friend who was locked up with a friend of Fivio’s, and he agreed to fund and guide Fivio’s career partly as a lark—hoping, he told me, to help Fivio earn a hundred thousand dollars. Now Reefer and his partner, known as Bless, are in charge of Fivio’s complicated evolution from local celebrity to actual celebrity. (A planned recent appearance at a strip club in Queens was cancelled, at the last minute, because police warned the club that Fivio might attract an unmanageable crowd.)\n\n“What studio we going to?” Fivio asked Reefer one afternoon, as they set off in the S.U.V. to tweak his new album. When Reefer named a place in New Jersey, Fivio groaned. “I’m bigger than that,” he said.\n\nReefer just laughed. “You got kicked out of every studio in Manhattan,” he said.\n\nThe driver punched an address into his phone and took off, trailed by Fivio’s security detail. As the vehicle crossed into New Jersey, Fivio seemed to relax slightly. He told the driver to stop at Target, where he led an expedition to the menswear section, in pursuit of a white thermal top that he felt would improve his outfit. One of his friends, a rapper known as Ether da Connect, inspected a Tupac Shakur T-shirt. “Mad dead people got merch in Target,” Ether observed. “You can’t be alive and get a deal with them niggas!”\n\nIn the parking lot, Fivio was waylaid by a couple of Nigerian American doctors, who didn’t quite know who he was but knew that their kids would want a picture of him. Afterward, the group stopped at a Chinese restaurant and then a pizza restaurant, where Fivio tried with diminishing success to stick to a no-carb diet. In early interviews, Fivio seemed self-conscious about his advanced age. Asked how old he was when his mother died, he began a long nonanswer by saying, “What year is this now? 2020?” But his relative maturity surely enabled his rise to the top of the New York drill hierarchy, and he is known among fans for outworking the competition. (A comment posted below one of his recent tracks: “Fivio has definitely gotten better.”)\n\nFivio attended the Grammys this year, and he is about to embark on his first real tour, playing theatres. These are signs of success for a drill rapper, but not proof that he has conquered the music industry. The world of hip-hop can be frustratingly—or thrillingly—unpredictable. For all the star power of “City of Gods,” and despite a chorus, swiped from the pop duo the Chainsmokers, that seemed engineered for crossover appeal, the song has so far been only a modest hit. The year’s biggest drill success story is “To the Moon,” a dreamy track by a previously unknown British model turned rapper named Jnr Choi. He found the beat online, and his creation gathered momentum via TikTok, surpassing a hundred million plays on Spotify before anyone really knew who he was.\n\nFivio’s album, by contrast, leaves nothing to chance, being carefully divided between tough-guy tracks and ladies’-man tracks. Describing one of the more flirtatious efforts, he told me, “Bitches gon’ be getting dressed to this song.” Fivio is not generally regarded as a hip-hop virtuoso, but he has a fondness for good punch lines (as a boy, he loved watching rap battles) and an ability to keep the energy high without shouting, often rapping in cheerful dactyls. The first verse on “B.I.B.L.E.” begins “Still got my bitches from back in the day.” The primary theme is customer service, with collaborations designed to gratify a wide variety of tastes, and he even attempts to popularize a dubious new pickup line: “Baby, you viral.” But the secondary theme is regret, because he can’t quite decide whether he wants to celebrate his old life or disavow it:\n\nBoy, I shoulda been careful\n\nBut I ain’t really care to\n\nI was young, dumb and unfearful\n\nTwo, three drillers jumping in the vehicle\n\nIf the sirens loud enough, that scares you\n\nIf you talking to that gun, it hears you\n\nTell him to shoot and he didn’t come near you\n\nYou better do it, if them niggas dare you.\n\nAt the studio, Fivio asked an engineer to play a beat, and then, as a casual party continued outside, he disappeared into the unlit recording booth. Fivio doesn’t write his tracks so much as build them, coming up with couplets and adding them to what he’s already got. Having spent years developing his style, he finds that he can now crank out new lyrics efficiently. “I’m a make them niggas hear and feel me,” he rapped. Then he matched that plain line with a more ornate and unexpected one, alluding to a drug bust: “Undercovers want to paraphernal’ me.” He didn’t pause to celebrate. “Save that,” he told the engineer. The beat stopped for a second, and then resumed, so that Fivio could think of the next rhyme. ♦"
