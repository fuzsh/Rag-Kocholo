        "text": "There are the moments in early childhood — when a malleable brain is still learning to process the world — that leave an indelible mark. For Mary J. Blige, one of the most successful female R&B singers of her generation, it was the sound of well-worn vinyl grooves coming from her mother Cora's record player.\n\nIn particular, Blige remembers Jackson's own Dorothy Moore singing “Misty Blue,” which went to No. 3 on the Billboard charts and earned Moore two Grammy nominations in 1976.\n\n“My mother played (“Misty Blue”), from the time I was a 5-, 6-year-old child — she played that record so, so much,” Blige said by phone. “It’s one of my mother’s and one of my favorite soul songs ever.”\n\nAs Blige and her mother collectively repaired their lives in a housing project in Yonkers, New York, escaping the abuse of Blige’s father Thomas only a year earlier, it was the music of Mississippians — Moore, Clarksdale’s Sam Cooke, the Winona-born Pops Staples and his daughters, the Staples Sisters — that comforted them.\n\n“You guys (Mississippi) definitely have influence on me and a whole lot of artists,” Blige said. “I think R. Kelly is influenced by Sam Cooke, so is Justin Timberlake.”\n\nBlige recorded “Misty Blue” for a live concert recording and performed the song as a duet with Monica on “Motown Live” in 1998.\n\n“I’m very honored that she’s listened to my music, as famous as she is,” Moore, a four-time Grammy nominee, said of Blige, a 30-time nominee and eight-time winner.\n\n“I loved (the “Misty Blue” cover) and everything she does,” Moore said. “It was such an honor because of their age to reach back to the ‘old school,’ as we call it.”\n\n‘Old school’\n\nThe hit that became one of Blige’s favorites nearly didn’t happen, according to Moore. The song, written by Bob Montgomery, was released as a country song in 1966, gaining some success for Wilma Burgess and Eddy Arnold.\n\nMalaco Records’ Tommy Couch asked Moore to record the song in 1973. She recorded the future hit in one take, but it sat on the shelves for nearly two years as the label, teetering on the verge of bankruptcy, shopped it to other labels. Finally, enough money was cobbled together for a release, but there wasn't faith in it as a lead single. \"Misty Blue\" ended up on the B side of the record.\n\n“The rest is history,” Moore said. “They never did turn it back over because 'Misty Blue' became the A-Side and everything else. I thank God for those people that wanted to flip it over.”\n\n‘New school’\n\nIn addition to being an immensely talented vocalist, it's Blige’s ability to blend genres that has led her, with 24.5 million records sold, to become the third highest-selling female R&B singer of the Soundscan era, only trailing Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston.\n\nA catalog of 13 albums will be on display Tuesday as Blige performs in Jackson for the first time, at the Mississippi Coliseum with Tamar Braxton.\n\n“Bringing Mary J. Blige to Jackson is by far the most exciting production we have ever done,” said Xperience JXN Entertainment promoter Yolanda Singleton. “It’s our belief that the people in central Mississippi should have the opportunity to see and experience class-A acts without having to travel.”\n\nIn honor of breast cancer awareness month, Singleton said 10 free tickets will be given to women who are breast cancer survivors or currently going through treatment.\n\nGiven her long string of hits, Blige won't be able to perform every favorite.\n\n“It is a two-hour show, so it is hard to get to every song that everyone wants to hear,” Blige said. “I try to pick the best ones and people still are like ‘why didn’t she do that.’ If I did all of the songs, it would be five hours, but we’re going to have a great time.”\n\nMoore said she first became familiar with Blige when she released her second album, “My Life,” which included the hit “I’m Goin’ Down,” and the memorable video featuring Blige and a series of her clones walking down a staircase.\n\n“She has meaty lyrics that are telling a story. Whether it is hers or someone else’s, she can really bring the song to life,” Moore said. “I try to do the same thing when I perform.”\n\nBlige referred to her concert experience and the ability to connect — through trials and tribulations — with her legion of fans as “the Mary J. Blige way.” Her own trials were inspiration while recording her last album, 2014’s “London Sessions,” in collaboration with British balladeer Sam Smith and electronic group Disclosure.\n\n“That album helped me at a time when I was coming out of a really low place (personally),” Blige said. “As far as me as an artist, I was in a dark place, too, because I felt like I needed people to see that I’m more than just Mary J. Blige, a soul singer. I’m an artist; I can do so many things. It was therapeutic because I had the chance to get a lot of things off my chest.”\n\nBlige said she’s been in the studio working on a new album, but once the tour ends, she heads straight to rehearsal of a live NBC production of “The Wiz.” Blige will play the part of the Wicked Witch of the West, Evilene.\n\n“I’ve always loved 'The Wiz' as a kid, and even as an adult I still love it,” Blige said. “My favorite part was always the ‘no bad news part,’ when (Evilene) sings that songs, it just hits. To be given that part is just like ‘wow, this is going to be fun.’”\n\nContact Jacob Threadgill at (601) 961-7192 or jthreadgil@gannett.com.
