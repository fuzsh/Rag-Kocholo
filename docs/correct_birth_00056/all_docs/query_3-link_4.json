        "text": "Background\n\nMary J. Blige was born in the Bronx, New York, to Cora and Thomas Blige on January 11, 1971. She was raised with her older sister. Mary’s parents split when she was four years old. Her mother ended up taking them to Georgia with her. However, that lifestyle did not suit them, so she moved to New York and lived in a seedy neighborhood for most of her early days, spending the majority of her time in constant dread for her life. She quickly became obsessed with hip-hop music as a result of her mother’s collection, and her trips to visit her father also aided her in establishing a strong musical sense. Mary would often practice singing by performing in church choirs and at family events. Her sister and mother encouraged her to pursue her interest, and she won a local singing competition when she was eight years old. To follow her musical dreams, she dropped out of school and focused only on her musical endeavors.\n\nBlige began working with song producer Sean Combs, commonly known as Puff Daddy, after signing with Uptown. He was appointed executive producer and was responsible for the majority of her debut album. Mary’s debut album, “What’s the 411?,” was launched in July 1992. Unexpectedly, it was embraced by both critics and the general public. It was a rare fusion of two disparate musical styles, soul and hip-hop, yet it struck a chord with the audience. The album debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 list and was certified three times Platinum by the R.I.A.A. Two hits from the album, ‘Real Love’ and ‘You Remind Me,’ became highly well-known, and the American music business heralded the arrival of a new period known as “Mary J. Blige.” She was a woman with great potential and ambition.\n\n“My Life,” her second album, was released in 1995. It conveyed the hardships she had experienced in her personal life and mellowed down the hip-hop section. It appeared to try for an inner connection with the listeners and was successful in doing so. The album topped the charts and sold millions of copies, proving that Blige was not a ‘one-hit wonder.’ In 1996, “My Life” received a Grammy nomination for “Best R&B Album.” Despite losing the title, she then won the ‘Best Rap Performance’ award for her performance with Method Man. “My Life” also signaled the end of her relationship with some of her close friends and the label Uptown.\n\n“Be Without You,” the lead single from her seventh album, “The Breakthrough,” was a smashing success that stayed at the top of numerous charts for weeks. Since then, she has released blockbuster albums that have garnered several awards and nominations. Following that, Blige headed into the movie industry. In 2001, she made her debut with “Prison Song.” She has also previously starred in the T.V. sitcom, “The Jamie Foxx Show.” She went on to appear in films such as “Rock of Ages”, and the medieval drama “Mudbound.” She received critical praise as well as multiple honors and nominations for her performance in “Mudbound.”\n\nShe fell in love with Kendu Issacs in the early 2000s and married him in 2003, but she filed for divorce in 2016. She became addicted to drugs and alcohol during the early phases of her career, which she considers to be the darkest period of her life."
