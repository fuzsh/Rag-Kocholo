        "text": "The legacy of Remy Ma is as tightly woven into the fabric of hip-hop history as a bass line. Over the course of nearly two decades, Remy has impacted rap music both near and far, setting a bar for how artists of all genders should approach the art form. However, we lost her physical presence for nearly half of her career span—a story she details in her long-awaited second solo album 7 Winters and 6 Summers. The Bronx-bred Grammy-nominated legend delivers a brand new iteration of Remy Ma, one who is not only integral to the foundation of hip-hop music, but is elevating it as one of the brightest yet timeless stars in the game.\n\nBobby Carter is slowly changing the music industry, one genre-bending performance at a time. As the Senior Producer for NPR Music’s Tiny Desk Concerts, he’s brought on an increasingly-growing roster of emerging artists, big names, and icons to the company’s headquarters in Washington, D.C. to perform not only for the building’s employees, but for an audience of millions worldwide.\n\nThe St. Louis native’s journey has been long and arduous, but fulfilling, to say the least. “I’ve been at NPR for 23 years,” Carter tells ESSENCE. “But my route to where I am now was a bit unconventional; I started out as an intern in the summer of 2000. I was in the digital media space at the time, my job was to edit our content for the web stream. I spearheaded or managed our live streams – and this predated Tiny Desk.”\n\nSince his full transition to Tiny Desk in 2017, Carter has developed partnerships with Complexcon, and HBO’s Insecure, along with creating new initiatives to grow and diversify the program’s reach. He’s also known for further innovating the Tiny Desk Concert Series with artists such as Usher, H.E.R., Anderson.Paak, Jazmine Sullivan, Kirk Franklin, and more. The process of choosing musicians for the now-iconic performance platform has shifted from the time of its inception, but for Carter, he’s more hands on than ever.\n\nH.E.R. story began in Hampton, Va., where Miss H.E.R. developed a passion for music at a very young age. She first became a DJ in March 2014, before making it her full-time occupation in January 2018. Over the years, she earned multiple weekly and monthly residencies at popular Washington D.C. venues, honing her skills and growing her following to become one of the premier DJs in the DMV area. She has been booked by numerous corporate entities such as Apple, Nike, Vice Media, Black Girls Rock, Kennedy Center, Capital One, Serato and many others. She has also spun sets alongside some of the greatest hip hop DJs of all time such as DJ Jazzy Jeff, J. Period, Lord Finesse, and DJ Scratch! Miss H.E.R. especially enjoys providing the soundscape for special events, where she has worked exclusive engagements hosted by Kevin Hart, John Legend, Dave Chapelle, Debra Lee, and Black Thought to name a few. A successful DJ, businesswoman and influencer, Miss H.E.R.’s childhood dream has manifested thanks to hard work, dedication, and a passion for the music that moves us all!\n\nMarc “Nfinit” Williams hails from Virginia Beach Virginia. Currently residing in Silver Spring MD, MarcNfinit wears multiple hats including, producer, engineer, and DJ. As a member of the True School Corporation, founded by Grammy Award winning producer and DJ, 9th Wonder, MarcNfinit has been an ambassador of bridging the gap, through music, between multiple generations for over a decade. His love for DJing has opened doors to receiving production credits with artist like Wale, Raheem Devaughn, IDK, Torae, and Skyzoo. MarcNfinit is a true student of hip hop, but more importantly music as a whole. His style of production and DJing is far from limited. Ask MarcNfinit and he’ll tell you what drives him is the “sense of gratification when you create something from scratch that moves people”.\n\nThe nation’s capitol has a hometown hero that spins, scratches and blends music while staunchly staying true to her roots. You can’t mute D.C. and you can’t mute DJ Heat. This skilled talent was just 13-years-old when she first discovered her interest in turntables courtesy of a Wreckx-N-Effect classic. She then went from fantasizing about spinning records to the real thing. An indelible spark was lit and a summer of saved paychecks led to her ultimately following her path and pursuing her passion. That small spark created a full- on flame, and DJ Heat took purposeful steps to align herself with her dream."
