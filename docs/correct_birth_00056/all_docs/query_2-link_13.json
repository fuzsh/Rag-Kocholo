Born in The Bronx section of New York City, she grew up in Richmond Hill, Georgia and sang in a Pentecostal church. Then, she moved back with her family to Yonkers. Due to family and personal traumas, she dropped out of high school in her junior year to pursue a musical career. In 1989, she signed with Uptown Records and became the company’s youngest and first female artist. She released her first album with 1992’s What’s the 411?  which launched her into superstardom and she became the “Queen of Hip Hop Soul”. Her second album, My Life, was on Time’s 100 greatest albums of all-time list. \n\nAlthough better known for her music, Blige has done a lot of acting as she first appeared in The Jaime Foxx Show (HBO Max). Since then, she has made appearances on the series Ghost Whisperer (The Roku Channel and Hulu), Entourage (HBO Max), 30 Rock (Peacock), and The Wiz Live! (Apple TV). In addition, her movie credits include I Can Do Bad All by Myself (Amazon Prime Video), Rock of Ages (Tubi), Betty and Coretta (Amazon Prime Video), and Mudbound (Netflix) where she has earned many award nominations (Golden Globe, Academy Award, Critic’s Choice, and SAG). She became the first person to be nominated for an Academy Award in acting and original song in the same year.\n\nMore recently, you can see Blige in Sherlock Gnomes (Amazon Prime Video), Trolls World Tour (Hulu), Scream: Resurrection, The Umbrella Academy (Netflix), Power Book II: Ghost (STARZ), and the Aretha Franklin biopic Respect (Amazon Prime Video). What happens to be your favorite Mary J. Blige movie or television role over the years?\n\n#maryjblige \n#whatsthe411 \n#mylife \n#QueenOfHipHopSoul \n#thejaimefoxxshow \n#HBOMax \n#GhostWhisperer \n#TheRokuChannel \n#hulu \n#entourage \n#30rock \n#PeacockTV \n#TheWizLive \n#appletv \n#ICanDoBadAllByMyself \n#AmazonPrimeVideo \n#rockofages \n#tubitv \n#bettyandcoretta \n#Mudbound \n#SherlockGnomes \n#TrollsWorldTour \n#ScreamResurrection \n#TheUmbrellaAcademy \n#Netflix \n#PowerBook2 \n#STARZ \n#Respect\".",
