        "text": "Mary J. Blige releases her debut album, What's The 411?, executive produced by Sean \"Puffy\" Combs. It takes the top spot on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums Chart as well as #6 on the Billboard 200. Her unique blend of hip-hop and soul earns her the nickname \"Queen of Hip Hop Soul.\"More\n\nMary J. Blige's first single, \"You Remind Me,\" hits #1 on the R&B chart, establishing her unique blend of \"hip-hop soul.\" Her next single, \"Real Love,\" tops the chart in October.\n\nMary J. Blige's \"Family Affair\" hits #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 for the first of six weeks. It's the singer's first single to top the chart.\n\n\"Be Without You\" by Mary J. Blige remains at #1 on the R&B chart for its 15th week, breaking the record of 14 weeks set the previous year by Mariah Carey with \"We Belong Together.\"\n\nA live adaptation of The Wiz airs on NBC. Based on the book (but not the film) The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, The Wiz began as a stage production in 1975, and was made into a movie (with Michael Jackson and Diana Ross) in 1978.More\n\nMary J. Blige debuts her Apple Music talk show, The 411, and welcomes Democratic presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton as her first guest. Halfway through the intimate conversation, Blige bursts into a rendition of Bruce Springsteen's protest anthem \"American Skin (41 Shots)\" in a bid to address the rash of police brutality against African Americans. The attempt falls flat with viewers, who heckle the singer on social media.More\n\nThe movie Mary J. Blige's Real Love airs on Lifetime. Based on her 1992 hit, it's followed a week later by Mary J. Blige's Strength Of A Woman, which continues the story of a young woman who must decide if the guy she falls for is worth the sacrifices. Blige is an executive producer on both films, which were made in collaboration with her production company, Blue Butterfly."
