        "text": "Leave it to Mary J. Blige, the queen of emotive, edgy soul, to turn her first holiday album into a dramatic and often poignant affair. A Mary Christmas does have its share of cheer: backed by a live orchestra, as are many of the tracks, âThis Christmasâ is a bright rendition of the Donny Hathaway classic. Still, Bligeâs take on âMy Favorite Thingsâ is hushed and delicate, and on her version of âPetit Papa NoÃ«l,â she sings in French over melancholy guitar."
