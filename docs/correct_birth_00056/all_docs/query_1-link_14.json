        "text": "LET'S get crunk, 'cause Mary’s back!\n\nHurricane Irma threatened to reschedule the highly-anticipated homecoming of Savannah-raised R&B superstar Mary J. Blige, but the show will go on.\n\nThough Blige was born in the Bronx, she spent several years of her early childhood living in Richmond Hill, where she sang in a Pentecostal church. She, her mother, and sister eventually moved to Yonkers, New York.\n\n“The Queen of Hip-Hop Soul” made her debut with 1992’s What’s the 411?, a stellar record of modern R&B stylings, vintage soul influence, and hip-hop edge that was executive-produced by Puff Daddy. My Life, its follow-up, offered intimate lyricism and a smoother sound and was a smash success for Blige. Rolling Stone, Time and Vibe consider it to be among the greatest albums ever recorded.\n\nShare My World followed in 1997, debuting at number one on the Billboard 200 and producing the singles “Love Is All We Need” (Featuring Nas), “I Can Love You” (featuring Lil’ Kim), “Everything,” “Missing You,” and “Seven Days” (featuring George Benson).\n\nBlige’s first number-one single, “Family Affair,” arrived in 2001 and remains a club staple. No More Drama received two Grammy nominations, and Blige’s song “He Think I Don’t Know” won a Grammy for “Best Female R&B Vocal Performance” the following year. To this day, she has earned nine Grammy awards and thirty nominations and is the only artist to have won Grammys in the R&B, hip-hop, pop, and gospel categories.\n\nThe Queen continues to consistently release music, most recently sharing Strength of a Woman, her 13th studio album, this year. The record debuted at Number One on Billboard’s R&B Album Chart, and single “Thick of It” topped the U.S. Adult R&B Songs chart for 16 consecutive weeks. Strength of a Woman features such guests as Kanye West, DJ Khaled, Missy Elliott, and more.\n\nStokley, former lead vocalist for the band Mint Condition and two-time Grammy nominee, will be Blige’s special guest for the tour.\n\nFriday, September 22, 8 p.m., $29-149, all-ages"
