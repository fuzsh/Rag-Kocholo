        "text": "Growing Pains\n\n(Geffen)\n\n???\n\nOver her 15-year music career, Mary J. Blige has evolved into the “Oprah of Song,” said Leah Greenblatt in Entertainment Weekly. Born in the Bronx and raised in the projects, Blige has always laid bare her struggles—drug addiction, physical abuse, and self-doubt—in her songs. But life has considerably improved for Blige since 1992’s What’s the 411? Blige pleaded for “no more drama,” and finally she has found peace. Growing Pains, her eighth studio album, charts the Queen of Hip-Hop Soul’s rise to success and self-assurance. Blige doesn’t just “ask you to shake what your mama gave you”; she wants you to “feed it, love it—and maybe put a fierce wig on it.” Blige knows people relate to pain, but here she “makes happiness and contentment seem as compelling as the struggle,” said Glenn Gamboa in Newsday. The majority of Growing Pains plays out like a self-help book, but Blige livens up the lessons with bouncy, vintage Michael Jackson beats and steamy boudoir grooves. She also finds room for plenty of guests, including Usher, Ludacris, and Tricky Stewart, who produced Rihanna’s “Umbrella.” Blige is undoubtedly a survivor, but this Mary-shall-overcome bit has become tired, said Ben Sisario in Blender. Growing Pains only reminds us that “in love there’s really nothing new, just flirting and fights and make-up sex.”"
