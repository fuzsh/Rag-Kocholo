        "text": "Mary J. Blige has announced a 23-city tour in support of her 14th studio album Good Morning Gorgeous. The veteran musician will be joined on select dates by “Boo’d Up” singer Ella Mai and rising R&B artist Queen Naija.\n\nThe Good Morning Gorgeous tour is scheduled to begin on Sept. 17 with a show at the Greensboro Coliseum in Greensboro, North Carolina. Blige will make stops in Charlotte, Philadelphia, Chicago, Atlanta, Oakland, Las Vegas, New Orleans, Memphis, Brooklyn, Newark, Cincinnati, and more before wrapping at Atlantic City, New Jersey’s Boardwalk Hall on Oct. 29.\n\nMore from Rolling Stone\n\nZendaya, Adele, Pete Davidson Named Among Most Influential People in 2022 Time 100 List\n\nJanet Jackson Presents Mary J.

Blige has been one of a select handful of artists at the top of our desired list to partner with since the initial construction of The BPC,” BPC co-founder and president Shelby Joyne shared in a statement. “Having her support in our mission so early in the process is a testament to the hard work we have put in to bring superior cultural experiences powered by black business to the masses. We firmly believe this is a match made in heaven and are honored to partner with the Queen.”\n\nThe Good Morning Gorgeous tour marks Blige’s first solo headlining trek since 2017’s Strength of a Woman tour. In 2019, she teamed up with Nas for a joint tour billed as The Royalty Tour.\n\nMary J.
