        "text": "Tasha Smith Opening The Summit With A Sermon About Strength\n\nTasha Smith truly shined at the Strength of a Woman Summit & Festival, hosted by Jess Hilarious. The actress and producer not only sat on a panel alongside Mary J. Blige, Taraji P. Henson, and Angie Martinez but also opened the summit with a few spiritual words. Guests checked out the many installations, grabbed their Sun Goddess wine and lite bites from Pepsi‘s Dig in Village, and then flooded the conference room waiting to hear words that would shift their spirits and open their minds.\n\nJess kicked off the panel discussions with a warm introduction followed by Smith, who took the floor with a motivational sermon surrounding the theme of strength. “I don’t try and be preachy it’s just in my DNA,” she began before reciting the scripture Isaiah 40:31. “But they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary; and they shall walk, and not faint.”\n\nTasha’s uplifting words set the tone for the rest of the afternoon, leaving the crowd roaring with applause and cheers. She definitely needs her own daytime talk show one day!\n\nWatch below.\n\ncnx.cmd.push(function() { cnx({ settings: { plugins: { pmcAtlasMG: { iabPlcmt: 2, } } }, playerId: \"72378765-bccd-4f92-9822-3dc0a14b65cf\", mediaId: \"6df1dc2c-0923-40ad-9e09-bae23d457d9c\", }).render(\"connatix_contextual_player_6df1dc2c-0923-40ad-9e09-bae23d457d9c_1\"); });\n\n\"Girl Talk\" With Mary J. Blige, Taraji P. Henson and Tasha Smith Hosted By Angie Martinez\n\nOf all the panels held at Strength of a Woman 2024, “Girl Talk with MJB” had to be the highlight of the night as Mary J. Blige, Angie Martinez, Tasha Smith, and Taraji P. Henson let us all in their unfiltered group chat.\n\nThe relatable conversation celebrated the magical bond found in Black women’s friendships as they examined life, love, dating, family, careers, and everything in between. From beginning to end, the room murmured grunts of agreement, loud claps, and chants of “I know that’s right.” As they discussed their busy lives, Smith shared how she keeps her friendships healthy and alive, even if they go periods without speaking.\n\n“When they’re doing dumb sh*t behind your back, they’re the ones that get more paranoid when they don’t hear from you,” the actress said when discussing fake friendships. “If I don’t talk to Taraji, I don’t think something’s wrong. I know she’s busy, and I know she loves me, and I know when I see her, we gonna pick up like we just did last week. Mary don’t get mad when I ain’t talking to her, she know we good. If she busy, and I call her and she don’t call me right back, I know we good. There is never a question.”\n\nShe went on, “So y’all women that be doing that dumb sh*t behind each other’s back y’all better stop, okay? And this is from the book of Tasha. I’ll get back to praying later from the Bible, but right now I’m going to say, if you want a good friend, here’s the scripture: ‘Show yourself friendly.’ And what is showing yourself friendly? Loyalty, commitment, not gossiping about a negro behind their back. Not backbiting. Really be there for your sisters. Really support them.”\n\nThe entire room clapped in agreement. Truly a mic-drop moment.\n\nMethod Man, Larenz Tate, Michael Rainey Jr., Mekai Curtis, And Da'Vinchi Honoring Black Women\n\nSOAW Fest saw a slew of incredible discussions spearheaded by Black and brown women. Aside from the women-led panels that discussed topics including mental health, fashion, style, women’s reproductive health, financial literacy, friendship, maintaining community, and small business, notable Black men showed up for their own panel where they honored Black women.\n\nBMF actor Da’Vinchi moderated a heartwarming panel featuring Method Man, Michael Rainey Jr., Larenz Tate, and Mekai Curtis. The gentlemen shared their love and respect for the women who have affected their lives. The actors also gave suggestions on how Black men can be better allies to Black women in a world that often pressures them to be strong.\n\n“Pay them equally,” Meth called out as the crowd roared in applause. Tate added, “In our society most of the gatekeepers are male, and the decision-makers are male. I think that in order to take it to the next level where women are equal in a real way, we have to let– no, they need to be in positions to be the gatekeepers.”\n\nGuest Treatments By Tooth Gems, Mielle Glam Sessions, Custom Floral Bouquets, And More\n\nAttendees were in for a treat!\n\nAs panel discussions flowed throughout the day, guests were offered many installations to occupy their time outside of the scheduled discussions. Truly a Black woman’s playground, attendees flooded lines to get free tooth gems by Tooth Couture, create their own custom bouquet of flowers, get their hair touched up by Mielle, and even write Mary J. Blige a message about how she changed their life.\n\nGuests were also invited to drop a video message in Pepsi‘s photo booth where they answered questions about Black culture. Of course, MJB’s signature Sun Goddess wine was available for purchase along with her Sister Love jewelry line with Simone I. Smith. Women viewed the station showcasing their signature bamboo doorknockers, necklaces, bracelets, and more.\n\nSmith actually appeared on another panel with Misa Hylton and LaTonya Blige-DaCosta where she promoted her earrings line with MJB and her latest denim-diamond collection with Hylton."
