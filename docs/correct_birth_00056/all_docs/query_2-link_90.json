        "text": "Hey, Hype enthusiasts! Get ready for a visual feast as we dive into Queen Mary J. Blige‘s latest music video, “Gone Forever,” featuring music powerhouses Remy Ma & DJ Khaled. The video currently sits at #21 on YouTube’s “Trending for Music” after its release six days ago. The DP did his thing on this, as the visuals physically move you…put it all together and it’s just not fair to the rest of the industry. This masterpiece was filmed at the stunning Harbor and The Stafford Room, courtesy of the team at the Dream Hospitality Group.\n\nThe Setting: Harbor and The Stafford Room by Dream Hospitality Group\n\nIn this visual, you get to immerse yourself in the luxurious backdrop of Harbor and The Stafford Room, where Mary J.

This is more than just a music video; it’s a visual journey set against the backdrop of two of New York City’s most iconic venues. In a production of this level, every detail is important While matching the powerful presences of the Queen, and Remy is pressure, the Dream team (my article, I can be corny if I want to), delivered their part of the magic in no uncertain terms.\n\nAll Bases Covered: Dive into the Vibes\n\nCatch the official “Gone Forever” music video below and let Mary J.

Maybe you won’t be in front of the mic or camera but some paths behind the scenes give amazing opportunities to excel and be a part of this multi-billion dollar industry. To that end, I just wanted to give a brief highlight of the hospitality group that played a key role in this production. The hospitality industry covers more than hotel and restaurant-type services…it’s a massive world! Meet George Karavias, the driving force behind Dream Hospitality Group who played host for this spectacular piece of work.\n\nDream Hospitality Group: Elevating Experiences with George Karavias\n\nGeorge Karavias and Dream Hospitality Group played a pivotal role in curating this exceptional setting.
