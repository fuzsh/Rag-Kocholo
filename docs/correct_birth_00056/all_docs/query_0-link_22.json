        "text": "Mary Jane Blige is an American Grammy Award-winning singer, songwriter, actress, and producer.\n\nBiography[]\n\nEarly life[]\n\nBlige was born on January 11, 1971, in Bronx, New York, where she began pursuing a music career after a difficult upbringing. In 1989, at the age of 18, she signed with Andre Harrell and Uptown Records, becoming the label's youngest and first female artist after recording a cover of Anita Baker's Caught Up in the Rapture.\n\nMusical success[]\n\nAfter signing, Blige began collaborating with Sean \"Diddy\" Combs, who executive produced her multi-platinum debut album What's the 411?, drawing inspiration from several of her musical influences, namely Aretha Franklin, Chaka Khan and Gladys Knight. Released on July 28, 1992, the album earned her two Soul Train Music Awards in 1993 and was so successful that she released a remix album. On November 29, 1994, Blige released her second album,My Life, which peaked at number seven on the U.S. Billboard 200 and landed the number one spot for the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums.\n\nBlige began working with television and film studios during the mid 1990s. In 1995, she recorded Not Gon' Cry for the soundtrack to the romance film Waiting to Exhale. Not only did it land at number two on the Billboard Hot 100 and number one on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs, but Blige also earned her first two Grammy nominations. After working with main stream rappers such as Jay-Z and Ghostface Killah, Blige released her third album, Share My World, which was meant to be a new chapter in her career as she sought a healthier lifestyle with happier music. The album debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 and produced five hit singles.\n\nAfter being nominated for her third Grammy Award and winning an American Music Award for \"Favorite Soul/R&B Album\", Blige dropped her now double platinum fourth album, titled Mary, on August 17, 1999. Two years later, On August 28, 2001, Blige's fifth studio album, No More Drama was released, and the Family Affair single was her first number one on the Billboard Hot 100. After her sixth album in 2003, which was her lowest-selling ever despite being produced by Diddy, Blige released her seventh album, The Breakthrough, and it became the biggest first-week sales for an R&B solo female artist in SoundScan history.\n\nBlige later earned her fourth number-one album with the release of her eighth album, Growing Pains, which won the Grammy Award for \"Best Contemporary R&B Album.\" She then performed at the Presidential Inauguration Committee's We Are One: The Obama Inaugural Celebration at the Lincoln Memorial. Since then, Blige has dropped multiple albums and even performed during the Super Bowl LVI halftime show.\n\nActing career[]\n\nIn addition to music, Blige began to focus more seriously on acting. She appeared in series such as The Jamie Foxx Show, Entourage, and Ghost Whisperer, as well as starring in various films, including Prison Song, Rock of Ages, and Mudbound, the latter of which she was nominated for multiple awards, including the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress.\n\nIn 2018, Blige was cast in the recurring role of Sherry Elliot for the third season of MTV's Scream television series. The following year, she landed a major role portraying Cha Cha in the Netflix Original series The Umbrella Academy. However, she is perhaps best known for her starring role as Monet Tejada on the Starz original crime drama Power Book II: Ghost, produced by 50 Cent.\n\n[]\n\nOfficial Website"
