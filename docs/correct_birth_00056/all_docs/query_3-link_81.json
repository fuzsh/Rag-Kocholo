        "text": "New York soul-rap diva Mary J. Blige, an authentic product of the ghetto's tough life, popularized the fusion of soul and rap that had been developing since Bobby Brown's massive success of 1988. Both her manifestos, What's the 411? (1992) and My Life (1995), were crafted by producer Sean \"Puffy\" Combs."
