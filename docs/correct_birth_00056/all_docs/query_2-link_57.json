        "text": "Slowly and surely, concerts and festivals are making a comeback! Fresh off her triumphant Super Bowl LVI Performance, Mary J. Blige brings her rich auntie vibes to the 15th Annual Jazz In The Gardens Music Festival. Blige, who recently released her 14th studio album, “Good Morning Gorgeous” to critical acclaim, will reprise her high-energy show at JITG, which takes place on March 12 and 13, 2022, in Miami Gardens, FL. The R&B megastar, who also stars in the riveting Starz series “Power Book II,” is the only headline artist to perform three times in the festival’s 15-year history. Affectionally known as “the Queen of Hip-Hop Soul,” Blige was invited back after thousands of fans clamored for her return to the country’s fastest-growing jazz & R&B festival.\n\nThe Jazz in the Gardens full lineup includes Mary J. Blige, H.E.R, Rick Ross, The Isley Brothers, SWV, The Roots with special guest T-Pain, Stokely, Johnathan McReynolds, Mike Phillips, and Mark Allen Felton, with local performers still to be announced. Syndicated radio host and comedian Rickey Smiley will return as the host for the 2022 JITG.\n\nIn 2020, in the wake of the global pandemic, Jazz in the Gardens was forced to cancel just two days before the doors were slated to open. Now, almost two years later, the 2022 festival represents an impressive comeback as the City of Miami Gardens’ signature event and is anticipated to be an even better experience for the thousands of loyal and eager ticket buyers who hail from all over the world. Entrants will be required to show a valid COVID-19 vaccination card or a negative COVID-19 test. Social distancing protocols will be observed and face masks will be strongly encouraged.\n\n“Not only are we excited for the return of Jazz in the Gardens, but we are also honored to host Mary J. Blige once again in the great City of Miami Gardens,” said Mayor Rodney Harris. “Mary J is an outstanding artist who consistently delivers a soulful and entertaining performance for her audience. We are happy to welcome her back to Miami Gardens, and to share the experience with all the Jazz in the Gardens fans.”\n\n“As a manager, my clients have played this festival several times over the past decade,” said Shawn Gee President of Live Nation Urban, “so when presented with the opportunity to work alongside the city to produce the event this year, I was super excited. Jazz in the Gardens is one of the most important live events in the culture of Jazz & R&B music, globally. Our goal is not only to produce a stellar event but to let the world know about the hidden gem that the City of Miami Gardens has with this event.”\n\nThe 15th Annual Jazz in the Gardens also showcases an eclectic mix of goods and great buys in the Merchandise Village and delicious, exotic cuisine in the Food Village.\n\nTickets are on sale now at www.jazzinthegardens.com.\n\nFollow @jazzinthegardens"
