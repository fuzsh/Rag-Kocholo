        "text": "Is Mary J. Blige done searching for that real love? The GRAMMY-winner has revealed that she is now off the market.\n\nIn Blige’s latest interview, per Vibe, the singer was asked about the status of her current relationship.\n\n“No, I’m not single. I’m happily doing what I’m doing,” the singer replied. She didn’t give any more details on who her new boo could be.\n\nThe “Real Love” singer said that her latest song, “Still Believe In Love,” was created when she had just finalized her divorce. She said that she “needed something different” and “postive” at that point in her life.\n\n“I had to believe in myself […] I say ‘no matter what happens, I’m never gonna give up on me.’ And the timing, the climate for the song was just perfect for right now,” she said.\n\nBlige was married to record producer Kendu Isaacs. They got married in 2004 and got divorced after 12 years of marriage.\n\nMary J. Blige’s Recent Honors\n\nIn 2022, Blige dropped her GRAMMY-nominated album Good Morning Gorgeous. She followed up with a tour that was supported by Ella Mai and Queen Naija in select cities. That same year, she also took the stage at the Super Bowl with Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Eminem, Kendrick Lamar, and 50 Cent. Additionally, she reviewed the 2022 Icon Award at the Billboard Music Awards for her success in the music industry.\n\n“My career has been such an incredible and unexpected journey that has included many turns into avenues I never could have imagined like acting, producing, launching businesses, and now even my own music festival,” expressed Blige in a press statement per Vibe. “Through it all, I always one way or another gravitated back to my first love, music. To be recognized in this way at this moment, with the Icon Award at the Billboard Music Awards, is an incredible honor and one that I am truly humbled by.”\n\nMary J. Blige: Her 10 Best Songs, Ranked\n\nAutumn Hawkins is the National Hip-Hop and R&B writer for Beasley Media, currently residing in New Jersey. Prior to working at Beasley Media, she was in broadcast news as an entertainment producer. When she's not impatiently waiting for Beyoncé to drop new music, she is reading, shopping, or planning a vacation."
