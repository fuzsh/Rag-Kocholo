        "text": "By Mark Richens of The Commercial Appeal\n\nThis week brings one of the city's signature cultural events as well as an interesting lineup of live music to enjoy once those Halloween hangovers wear off. Here are some entertainment recommendations courtesy of our GoMemphis writers and editors.\n\n1. Indie Memphis Film Festival, opens Tuesday: Now in its 18th year, the festival stands as one of the city's premier arts and culture events. Its eight days of movie magic promise a 25th anniversary screening of Whit Stillman's Oscar-nominated debut feature, \"Metropolitan\"; a new documentary about Hi Records soul man Syl Johnson; and many more screenings, parties and panels. — Mark Richens\n\nTuesday through Thursday and Nov. 9-10: Screenings and panels at the Halloran Centre. Nov. 6-8: Screenings and panels at Circuit Playhouse, Hattiloo Theatre and Malco Studio on the Square. Admission prices range from $10 (for a single screening) to $250 (for a VIP pass). For tickets, passes, a full schedule and more information, visit indiememphis.com.\n\n2. Mary J. Blige, Wednesday: The Bronx-born diva remains the epitome of modern R&B with a record 30 Grammy nominations and nine awards, in addition to her 50 million albums sold. After releasing her transatlantic collaboration “The London Sessions” last year, Blige is already recording a follow-up and is back working with a crew of Britons (including Romans songwriter Sam Roman). The disc is expected later in 2016. In the meantime, Blige is embarking on three-week tour of the South and the East Coast that will stop at Downtown’s Orpheum. — Bob Mehr\n\n8 p.m. 203 S. Main. Tickets: $67.50 to $113, on sale now at all Ticketmaster outlets, ticketmaster.com or (800) 745-3000.\n\n3. Everclear, Wednesday: Alt-rock hitmakers in the wake of fellow Pacific Northwesterners Nirvana, Everclear always had more of a classic-rock/singer-songwriter’s heart than most of their scene cohort, with frontman Art Alexakis emerging as something of a poet laureate of Divorced Dad Rock. The band will play the New Daisy Theatre. — Chris Herrington\n\n8 p.m. 330 Beale St. $20-$25. 901-525-8981. newdaisy.com\n\n4. Allen Stone, Monday: The blue-eyed soul singer-songwriter plays Beale Street’s freshly renovated New Daisy Theatre. The 28 year-old Washington-bred Stone has built up a grass-roots following, earning fan and record company attention with a series of solo albums over the past few years, including 2011’s self-titled LP and his latest for Capitol, “Radius.” Grammy-nominated Swedish songman Bern/hoft will open the show. — Mehr\n\nDoors at 7 p.m., show at 8. Tickets: $22. On sale now at newdaisy.com or (877) 987-6487.\n\n5. \"American Cheerleader,\" Thursday: High school cheerleading as a competitive team sport is the subject of “American Cheerleader,” a highly entertaining and ultimately even moving documentary produced in cooperation with Varsity Spirit, the Memphis-based company that organized the first cheerleading championship in 1980 and has been a major sponsor of the sport’s growth. The documentary primarily follows two teams — one from small-town Kentucky, the other from urban New Jersey — as they head toward a national championship confrontation; supplementing the film itself will be “from the vault” footage of winning performances by cheer teams from years past. — Beifuss"
