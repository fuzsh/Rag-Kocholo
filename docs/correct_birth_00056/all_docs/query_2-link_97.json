        "text": "MIAMI GARDENS, Fla., Feb. 16, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Superbowl 2022 enjoyed an electrifying performance by the incomparable Mary J. Blige who brought the hip-hop heat to a star studded, fast paced, powerful halftime show, joined by legends Snoop Dog and Doctor Dre. Blige, who recently released her album \"Good Morning Gorgeous\" to critical acclaim, will reprise her high energy show at the 15th Annual Jazz in the Gardens (JITG) Music Festival, which takes place on March 12 and 13, 2022. The R&B megastar, who also stars in the riveting Starz series \"Power Book II\", is the only headline artist to perform three times in the festival's 15-year history. Affectionally known as \"the Queen of Hip-Hop Soul\", Blige was invited back after thousands of fans clamored for her return to the country's fastest growing jazz & R&B festival, presented by the City of Miami Gardens, the largest Black city in Florida.\n\nFRESH OFF HER TRIUMPHANT SUPERBOWL SHOW, MARY J.
