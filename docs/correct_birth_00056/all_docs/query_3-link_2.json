        "text": "Music career\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nPop Culture Quiz\n\nBlige sang backup for various artists until the 1992 release of her first solo album, What’s the 411?, produced primarily by rapper Sean (“Puffy”) Combs (Diddy). That album reveals the pain of Blige’s childhood while presenting a unique sound that mixed classic soul with hip-hop and urban contemporary R&B, redefining soul music and influencing a generation of artists. The album also produced the top 10 hit “Real Love.” Her success continued with the introspective My Life (1994); a documentary centering on the album appeared in 2021.\n\nBlige’s glamorous but street-tough image softened over time. However, her music remained personal, emotional, and spiritual. Among Blige’s host of hit singles are “Be Without You” (1994), “Not Gon’ Cry” (1996), and “Take Me as I Am” (2005). Her hit albums include Share My World (1997) and Growing Pains (2007), both of which reached number one on the Billboard charts. No More Drama (2001), Blige’s fifth studio album, presents an artist who is happy with the woman she has become. That album spawned the irresistible number one single, “Family Affair,” which spent six weeks at the top of the charts. Her 2006 release, Reflections (2006), provides a retrospective of her work.\n\nBlige also joined rock band U2 on numerous occasions to perform their single “One,” most notably at a benefit concert for victims of Hurricane Katrina in 2005. She recorded a version of the song on her album The Breakthrough (2005), and another version was released as a single in mainland Europe and the United Kingdom in 2006. Of Blige’s passionate vocal delivery on “One,” U2 lead singer Bono said:\n\nMary J. Blige brought the song places I couldn’t possibly have been or understood. I don’t know exactly where she went, or the names she put on the places, or the problems she was trying to solve with her interpretation, but I felt them so strongly.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

Stronger with Each Tear (2009) was criticized for its overreliance on guest vocalists and Auto-Tune technology, but Blige rebounded in convincing fashion with My Life II…The Journey Continues (Act I) (2011), which plays to her strengths, balancing soulful ballads with catchy dance tunes that recall her earliest hits. An album of Christmas standards, A Mary Christmas, appeared in 2013. The following year she released the soundtrack for the comedy film Think Like a Man Too and The London Sessions, the latter of which features collaborations with several British producers and musicians, including Sam Smith, Naughty Boy, and the duo Disclosure. The critically acclaimed Strength of a Woman (2017) was inspired by Blige’s acrimonious breakup with her husband and manager, Kendu Isaacs. Blige’s 14th studio album, Good Morning Gorgeous, appeared in 2022. Shortly thereafter she was among a group of hip-hop stars—which included Snoop Dogg, Dr. Dre, and Eminem—who performed at the Super Bowl halftime show.\n\nIn 2019 Blige received a lifetime achievement award from Black Entertainment Television (BET). In 2024 Blige was scheduled to be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\n\nActing career\n\nBlige forayed into acting, making guest appearances on several television shows and taking supporting roles in such films as Rock of Ages (2012), Betty and Coretta (2013), Black Nativity (2013), and Mudbound (2017). For her work in the latter movie, a drama about racism in 1940s Mississippi, Blige earned an Academy Award nomination for best supporting actress. In addition, “Mighty River,” which she cowrote and sang for the film’s soundtrack, received an Oscar nod.\n\nShe later lent her voice to the animated feature Sherlock Gnomes (2018) and Trolls World Tour (2020). Her other credits from 2020 include the horror thriller Body Cam, in which she played a police officer. During this time she also had recurring roles on such TV shows as Scream and The Umbrella Academy. In Power Book II: Ghost (2020–24), a spin-off of the popular crime drama Power, Blige played a drug “queenpin.” (In early 2024 it was announced that the series would end after its fourth season concludes in September.) She played jazz great Dinah Washington in the Aretha Franklin biopic Respect (2021), which starred Jennifer Hudson in the lead role. In 2024 Blige costarred in the film Rob Peace, playing the mother of a young man whose promising future is compromised by his economic situation and issues involving his family and past."
