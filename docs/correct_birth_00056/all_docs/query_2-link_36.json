        "text": "Mary J. Blige is migrating her Strength Of A Woman Festival and Summit this year, bringing the weekend of music and culture to her hometown for the first time. The third annual event is set to take place from May 10-12 in New York City. In its first two years, SOAW brought the Queen of Hip-Hop Soul to Atlanta.\n\nOrganized in partnership with Live Nation Urban, the three-day event is set to highlight music and comedy with female empowerment sessions and more.\n\n“I’m so excited to bring our Strength of a Woman Festival and Summit to my hometown, New York City, a place that has always been a huge source of inspiration for me,” explained the 53-year-old.\n\n“Having the opportunity to continue to uplift, inspire, and build within my community is the reason I created this festival. I’m so grateful for all the support from our performers, attendees, and of course, our partners Live Nation Urban and Pepsi. Nobody does it like New York, so get ready.”\n\nThe Strength of a Woman Summit is hosted by Angie Martinez and aims to empower and engage with women. This includes inspiring programming, pivotal panels, keynote speakers, workshops, and much more.\n\nPerformers handling the festival aspect of the event, outside of headlining act Mary J. Blige, are 50 Cent, Jill Scott, Fat Joe, Jadakiss, Muni Long, Lola Brooke, Robert Glasper, The Clark Sisters, and Funk Flex. There is also a planned comedy show with Tiffany Haddish, Don’t Call Me White Girl, and Paris Sashay.\n\nTickets for the anticipated event are available on the official website on Wednesday (March 6) with the presale code “STRENGTH,” while general ticket sales begin Friday.
