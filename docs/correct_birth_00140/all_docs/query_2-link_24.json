        "text": "Disco queen and Dorchester native Donna Summer lost her battle with cancer this morning. The original “Bad Girl” was 63.\n\nDetails are scarce now, but according to reports, she was in Florida at the time of her death.\n\nSummer was born Dec. 31, 1948, in Dorchester and sang in local churches before becoming disco’s biggest star. She was a five-time Grammy winner who ruled the late ’70s with such blockbuster hits as “Last Dance,” “Hot Stuff,” “MacArthur Park” and “Bad Girls.”\n\nA perennial Rock and Roll Hall of Fame nominee, Summer was snubbed over and over again, along with fellow locals the J. Geils Band, the Cars and Boston.\n\nSummer had the ultimate disco voice. It was thinner than those classic ’60s soul voices, but it was more glamorous. It had the perfect balance of power and cool, breathy coo.\n\nHer signature song “Bad Girls” encompasses all the great things about disco. It starts with textbook funk guitar, then is followed by staccato horns, then a whistle, then the cry of “Toot! Toot! Beep! Beep!” with a sexy whisper underneath it all. It also has a faint hint of new wave to it — a few tweaks and it could fit on a Talking Heads record.\n\nIn ensuing years, Summer was eclipsed by younger stars who learned from her: Madonna, Whitney Houston, Janet Jackson. But she never stopped being a presence on dance floors throughout the world. From a discotheque in Europe to a suburban South Shore wedding, Summer’s hot stuff has always been there. And it always will be."
