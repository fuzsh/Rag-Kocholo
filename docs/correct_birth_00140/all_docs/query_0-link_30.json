        "text": "(1948–2012). The American singer-songwriter Donna Summer was considered the “Queen of Disco,” but she was also successful in rhythm and blues, dance music, and pop. Her work earned five Grammy Awards.\n\nSummer was born LaDonna Adrian Gaines on December 31, 1948, in Boston, Massachusetts. She sang in church and later in clubs in Boston. When she was 18 years old, she joined the German production of the musical Hair. While in Europe she studied with the Vienna Folk Opera and performed in productions of the musicals Godspell and Show Boat. In 1972 she married Austrian actor Helmuth Sommer. Although the two divorced in 1976, she kept his last name but Anglicized it for the stage.\n\nWhile in Munich, West Germany, Summer met producer-songwriters Giorgio Moroder and Pete Bellotte. The three collaborated on several Europop hits before creating the historic single “Love to Love You Baby” (1975). This song would turn out to be the first of more than a dozen hits in the United States for Summer. Over the next 14 years, Summer wrote or cowrote most of her material, including “I Feel Love,” “Bad Girls,” and “She Works Hard for the Money.” She also scored big hits with “MacArthur Park”; “Hot Stuff”; “No More Tears (Enough Is Enough),” a duet with Barbra Streisand; and Summer’s signature song, “Last Dance,” from the film Thank God It’s Friday (1978).\n\nIn her autobiography, Ordinary Girl (2003; with Marc Eliot), Summer discussed her drug and alcohol addictions and her 1979 conversion as a born-again Christian. She continued to score hits into the early 21st century. Three songs from her 2008 album Crayons, as well as her last single, “To Paris with Love” (2010), topped Billboard’s dance music charts. Summer died on May 17, 2012, in Naples, Florida. She was posthumously inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2013."
