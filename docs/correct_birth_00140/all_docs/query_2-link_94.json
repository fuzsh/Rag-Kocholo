        "text": "It has to be by a musical goddess with summer in her name.\n\nWelcome to “One Last Question,” an archived series where former research editor Matthew Reed Baker tackled your most Bostonian conundrums. This post was last updated in June 2023.\n\nQuestion:\n\nEvery year, it seems like Top 40 radio chooses a “song of the summer” that defines the season. What is the greatest Boston summer jam of all time? —J.G., Jamaica Plain\n\nAnswer:\n\nYour question is music to my ears, J.G., as I love the synergy between the sunny season and sunny tunes pumping out of the stereo. And yet, I also know that any answer will strike a wrong chord with someone: After all, music is so personal and subjective, with listeners often stuck in one genre. But if you define a “song of the summer” as music that brings people together regardless of taste or age—and, most important, inspires them to sing along and dance—then the ultimate Boston summer jam has to be by a musical goddess with summer in her name.\n\nOf course, I’m talking about the late Donna Summer, the Queen of Disco and Rock & Roll Hall of Famer. Her story has often been told: Born LaDonna Adrian Gaines, she grew up on Parker Hill Avenue in Mission Hill, sang gospel as a young girl, and attended Dorchester’s Jeremiah E. Burke High School. After landing a role in a German production of the musical Hair in the late 1960s, she hung around Munich as a backup singer before hooking up with the production duo Giorgio Moroder and Pete Bellotte. The rest is history: 14 Top Ten hits in the Billboard Hot 100, including the steamy symphony “Love to Love You Baby,” the futuristic fugue “I Feel Love,” and the number-one heartbreak hit “MacArthur Park.” Let’s face it—she basically released the song of the summer almost every summer throughout the 1970s."
