She is a myth of disco music of the 1970s and 1980s.\n\nShe has performed many hits such as: Could It Be Magic (1976), Love to Love You Baby (1975), Feel Love (1977), Last Dance (in) (Grammy Award in 1978 in the Best R & B vocal performance female category), Hot Stuff (Grammy Award in 1979 in the Best Rock Vocal Performance Female), Bad Girls (1979), On the Radio (1979), She Works Hard for the Money (1983) and No More Tears (Enough Is Enough) (1979) in duet with Barbra Streisand. She has sold more than 130 million records worldwide.\n\nBorn into an African-American family of the \"middle class\", third of seven children> of Andrew Gaines and Mary Ellen (her father, son of preacher, was butcher and electrician, her mother teacher)>, LaDonna Adrian Gaines grew up in a White Mission Hill neighborhood where she faces racism ignored by her parents, Mary Gaines' own mother being white. Raised in a Christian family and musicians, at the age of eight, she quickly replaced a sick chorister of the gospel choir of the church of her district, the Grant Avenue African Methodist Episcopal Church, and then became soloist of this choir at ten. In 1967, two months before graduating from Jeremiah E. Burke High School in Dorchester, she dropped out of school to become a professional singer in Crow, an underground band of white rock (a band shaped like Blood, Sweat and Tears and with the multiracial approach of Sly and the Family Stone) who plays in clubs in Boston and sometimes New York, and in which she sings since the age of sixteen. It is in this last city that she is spotted by RCA Records which offers her, exclusively, her first recording contract. While hoping to replace Melba Moore who had abandoned her role in Hair, she is offered this role in the German version: at age 19, after obtaining the agreement of her parents at first reluctant, she leaves so for a tour in Europe where she will play in many musicals: in 1968, she sings in German in Haare, German version of Hair (musical comedy), then in 1970 in Ich bin Ich and in 1971 in Godspell. Winning her life as a model in the day, she turns in particular in TV spots. She also participated at that time in the musicals Showboat and Porgy & Bess>. She plays under the name of Donna Gaines and even Gayn Pierre for Ich bin Ich and Godspell>."
