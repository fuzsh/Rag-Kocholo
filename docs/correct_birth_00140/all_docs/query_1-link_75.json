        "text": "Widely hailed as the âQueen of Disco,â Donna Summer reshaped pop and dance musicâs possibilities throughout the â70s and â80s. Born in 1948 in Boston into a religious family, she sharpened her soaring, rangy voice in the church choir and later fronted a rock band called The Crow. Early stints as a stage performer and session vocalist led her to the production team of Giorgio Moroder and Pete Bellotte, who broke her into the burgeoning disco scene with 1975âs 16-minute sensual come-on, âLove To Love You Baby.â The teamâs distinct marriage of European pop styles and Black dance grooves set Summerâs 1975-1979 peak into motion, with a run of seminal anthems and innovative concept albums that embodied discoâs hedonism and musical abandon. As tastes in dance music evolved at the dawn of the â80s, so did Summerâs versatile sound, branching into R&B, rock, new wave, and electro-pop styles of the day. Since her death in 2012, the singularity of her musical impact can be traced everywhereâfrom EDM to BeyoncÃ©."
