        "text": "Synopsis\n\nDonna Summer’s daughter Brooklyn Sudano and Oscar Award-winning director Roger Ross Williams have made a new documentary on the late singer.\n\nLate American singer Donna Summer is the subject of a new documentary titled ‘Love to Love You, Donna Summer', created by her daughter Brooklyn Sudano and the Oscar Award-winning director Roger Ross Williams.\n\nSome explosive revelations have been made in the film, which releases on May 20, 2023, on HBO and HBO Max. Here’s what we know of Donna Summer’s life.\n\nWho was Donna Summer?\n\nSinger Donna Summer, born LaDonna Adrian Gaines in Boston, USA, rose to fame as the \"Queen of Disco\" in the 1970s. But behind the bad girl pop star aura was an innocent church choir girl who struggled, and even contemplated taking her own life.\n\nHow did Donna Summer die?\n\nDonna Summer died of non-smoking-related lung cancer in 2012. She had kept the diagnosis a secret and only her family knew about it.\n\nWhat was revealed in the Donna Summer documentary?\n\nDonna Summer thought of her religious upbringing while dressing up like a rockstar for the world and singing erotic songs. In the documentary, Summer is heard saying, \"You’re looking at me, but what you see is not what I am. How many roles do I have to play in my own life?\"\n\nThe church choir singer also had to face sexual abuse at the hands of a pastor as a child for many years, which left her depressed in adulthood as well. In 1976, Donna Summer almost jumped out of a window of her hotel room in New York, when a help saved her. About her suicide attempt, Summer said, \"I felt God could never forgive me because I had failed him. I was decadent, I was stupid, I was a fool. I just decided that my life had no meaning.\"\n\nThe documentary also reveals Summer’s relationships, including one with artist Peter Mühldorfer, whose assault resulted in the singer being unconscious with a black eye and broken ribs. Mühldorfer confessed in the film, \"I hit her, and I never could forgive myself.\"\n\nThe documentary film is co-directed by the late star’s daughter, Brooklyn Sudano, and has never-seen-before home videos. She told Fox News Digital that to understand the \"greatness and magnitude\" of her mother’s triumphs, one must also know the lows in her life. \"You also have to know what we had to work through and overcome to get there and why she decided to do certain things,\" Sudano said.\n\nShe added that it was important to address her mother’s trauma in the documentary to encourage others struggling to speak out. \"The experience has been very healing for us,\" she said.\n\nFAQs\n\nQ1:Who was the Queen of Disco?\n\nSinger-songwriter Donna Summer was known as the Queen of Disco.\n\nQ2:How did Donna Summer die?\n\nDonna Summer died of lung cancer.\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\nDisclaimer Statement: This content is authored by a 3rd party.
