The groovy tradition is heading to City Hall Plaza on Thursday, June 27 from 5 to 9 p.m.\n\nDetails about Donna\n\nThe “Queen of Disco” is a Boston native. She was born in Dorchester and grew up on Parker Hill Avenue in Mission Hill, which has been officially renamed Donna Summer Avenue.\n\nBorn LaDonna Gaines, the five-time Grammy Award-winning singer and songwriter found her voice by singing at the Grant AME Church in the South End with her family.\n\nAfter she died from cancer at the age of 62 in 2012, our city began honoring the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame musician’s legacy + Boston roots every summer. The annual tribute is hosted by Mayor Wu and the Office of Tourism, Sports, and Entertainment.\n\nKnow before you go\n\nIn addition to plenty of classic hits from Donna Summer, like “Hot Stuff” and “She Works Hard For the Money,” there will be a roller rink with first come, first served skate rentals, a disco ball, and glow sticks.\n\nPlus, we can expect special performances by Donna Summer’s sister, Mary Gaines Bernard, and her nephew O’Mega Red + music by DJ Vince1.\n\nThe family-friendly party is free and open to all.\n\nSave the “Last Dance” for the after party\n\nHigh Street Place will host a spectacular Disco Weekend June 27-June 29. The three-night celebration kicks off with the Official Donna Summer Disco After Party, including vibrant music, dancing + food and drink offerings. Pro tip: Must haves include disco fries from Wheelhouse, jello shots from Haley Jane’s, and a martini bar with disco tumblers from Daiquiris & Daisies.\n\nAdmission is free for all events, and guests are encouraged to register in advance."
