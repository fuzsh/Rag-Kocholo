        "text": "Once upon a time, a young girl stood in front of the parishioners in a Boston church. She opened her mouth to sing, and a huge voice came out - moving the congregation to tears. At that moment the girl heard the voice of God tell her, \"You're gonna be famous.\" From that time on, the girl knew that she was destined for greatness. That girl grew up to become Donna Summer.\n\nMost people know about her hits. Great songs like \"Last Dance\", Hot Stuff\", \"On The Radio\" and \"She Works Hard For The Money.\" What most people don't know is that Donna started off as Donna Gaines in a rock band called The Crow. And that when the band broke up, she left school to be in the German production of the the musical Hair. Once in Germany, there was no stopping Donna. She was active in musical theater, playing in such shows as Showboat, Porgy And Bess, and The Me Nobody Knows, and in 1971 she cut her first solo record, \"Sally Go 'Round The Roses\"\n\nBy 1974, and now going by the name Donna Summer, she was doing a great deal of session work which brought her into contact with producers Giorgio Moroder and Pete Bellotte. Together they recorded \"The Hostage\", a song which became Donna's first hit in Europe. An album and a few more European hits followed. Then in 1975, Donna recorded \"Love To Love You Baby\", the song that finally brought her success in America. The rest is history. Since then she has racked up fourteen top ten hits, four number one singles, three platinum albums, five Grammy awards and twelve other Grammy nominations. She is the first female artist to have three number one solo singles in one year (\"MacArthur Park\", \"Hot Stuff\" and \"Bad Girls\") and she is the only artist to have three number one double albums in a row (Live And More, Bad Girls, and On The Radio). Over the years Donna has proven herself to be a consummate artist and songwriter - she has written or co-written many of her hits, and is currently writing a musical based on her life story. Most recently she has done a benefit performance for GMHC at Carnegie Hall that raised over $400,000 for that organization. She also inked a multi-album deal with Epic Records and her first release for her new label was a live CD recorded at New York's Hammerstein Ballroom. This concert was videotaped and became the highest rated concert special for a solo artist that VH1 ever broadcast. In 2007, she signed a new deal with Burgundy Records (an imprint of Sony/BMG) and in 2008 she released her first album of all newly written and recorded material in 17 years. The album is called Crayons and with it came the number one dance single, I'm A Fire - making Donna the only artist to ever have a number one dance single in every decade since the 70s. Over three decades after her first success, Donna was poised to start a whole new chapter in her career - showing the world that the Queen was indeed back. But unfortunately, that was not meant to be. She passed away on May 17, 2012 from cancer. In 2013 she was posthumously inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, and 20 2024 she was given a Lifetime Achievement Award by the Recording Academy - long overdue official recognition of her incredible musical legacy.\n\nSome personal info...\n\nDonna Adrian Gaines was born on December 31, 1948 in Boston MA to Andrew and Mary Gaines.\n\nShe is the third of seven children. (One boy and six girls - imagine the fights over that bathroom! LOL)\n\nShe was married briefly in the early 70s to Helmut Sommer, with whom she had one child - Mimi Sommer.\n\nShe was married to songwriter Bruce Sudano with whom she has two children, Brooklyn and Amanda Grace Sudano. They married on July 16, 1980 and remained together the rest of Donna's life.\n\nOver the years Donna maintained homes in Los Angeles, Connecticut and New York, but most recently she and her family had homes in Tennessee, Florida and Los Angeles.\n\nThroughout her adult life, Donna had a passion for making videos - be it silly skits with the crew while on tour, or home movies with the family in her off time. Some of these films became the basis for the 2023 documentary, Love To Love You Donna Summer.\n\nDonna passed away on May 17, 2012 from lung cancer. She was laid to rest near her Nashville home. At the time of her death she was survived by her husband Bruce, 3 married daughters and 4 grandchildren.\n\nSome career info...\n\nIn 1968 Donna left home to join the German production of Hair.\n\nIn 1974 Donna had her first European hit with The Hostage.\n\nIn 1975 Donna had her first American hit with Love To Love You Baby.\n\nDonna wrote or co-wrote a significant number of her hits and album tracks.\n\nIn 1980, Donna became the first artist to sign with the newly formed Geffen records.\n\nDonna was also an accomplished painter whose works sell for thousands and thousands of dollars.\n\nDonna wrote several musicals including the much anticipated, Ordinary Girl - an autobiographical story. At this time, none of Donna's musicals has been publicly performed (outside of a few songs performed as part of her regular concerts.) There were plans before Donna passed away to bring Ordinary Girl to Broadway.\n\nIn 2003 Donna released her autobiography called: Ordinary Girl: The Journey.\n\nIn 2018 Summer: The Donna Summer Musical opened on Broadway. It was a jukebox biographical piece using Donna's music to tell her life story. Donna was portrayed by 3 actresses that represented Donna at different ages. Although it included none of the songs written for it, this is probably as close as we will ever get to seeing Ordinary Girl released.\n\nIn 2023, daughter Brooklyn Sudano in collaboration with Roger Ross Williams and HBO released a documentary about Donna's life called Love To Love You Donna Summer.\n\nOther achievements:\n\nLast Dance won an Academy Award for best Song from a Motion Picture in 1978. (Note, while Donna sang the song - the award went to the songwriter, Paul Jabara) It also earned a Golden Globe Award.\n\nDonna was the only artist ever to guest host Dick Clark's American Bandstand.\n\nDonna was the first female artist to have three number one singles in one year.\n\nShe was the only artist to date to have three number one platinum double albums in a row.\n\nTo date, Donna racked up 11 gold albums and 3 platinum albums (2 of which went double platinum). Additionally, she has has 12 gold singles and 2 platinum singles. (Check out www.riaa.com for a complete list of certifications.)\n\nDonna had 14 top 10 singles on the Billboard Hot 100 and 4 of those reached number 1.\n\nShe picked up 3 American Music Awards in 1979 for Favorite Female Vocal Pop or Rock, Favorite Single Pop or Rock (Bad Girls), and Favorite Female Vocalist for Soul Music.\n\nIn 1980 Donna received the NAACP Image Award.\n\nIn 1992 Donna was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\n\nHer most recent CD, Live & More Encore yielded back to back number 1 dance hits and was certified gold in Spain.\n\nIn 2008, she became the only artist to have a number 1 dance hit in every decade since the 1970s.\n\nIn 2013 she was posthumously inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall Of Fame - an honor that would have made her so proud. Previously she had been nominated for the classes of 2008, 2010, 2011 and 2012.\n\nIn 2024 She was posthumously honored with a Lifetime Achievement Award by the Recording Academy (the Grammy Awards organization.)\n\nI truly hope all of the publicity pays off. Disco being declared \"dead\" was an assault on both the gay and black communities. Disco music was devalued by the dominant, white, heterosexual male, heavy metal/country western culture. Donna was stigmatized along with all of it. I believe that she is truly one of the most talented and gifted singers/songwriters ever. While she was ostracized by the gay community in the 80's for apparently making anti-gay remarks (which she denies) she did recently perform a benefit concert in New York for the Gay Men's Health Crisis. I hope that will help put some of the ugly rumors to rest. I see Donna's triumphs as triumphs for minorities of all types, whether they be people of color, gay people or people who have voices made to soar with synthesizers (ahh, synthesizers: another devalued gift of music). For that matter, \"talented Christian Divas who have a primarily gay audience.\" Or, \"talented Christian Divas who are in their 50's and have a primarily gay audience.\" (If Cher and Tina can do it, so can Donna, who has much more range and lung power; not to say that Cher's new CD is not a completely awesome piece of dance [read as \"disco\"] \"electronica\"). Donna set the stage for techno-synth and electronic music, and the dominant culture is trying to erase her from the history books by ignoring her contributions, devaluing them and devaluing her audience. In 1979, she sold over 4 million copies of a double-album (\"Bad Girls\", priced at nearly $17.00). At the time, a black-female artist having a multi-platinum-selling album was practically unheard of (let alone having several). She had the first extended play single. She was brilliantly blending her tracks together more than a decade before Janet's \"Rhythm Nation\" hit the air waves. She \"reinvented\" herself with every album when Madonna was posing for nude pictures to make a living. Does she, Whitney or Janet ever give her credit? And on and on and on. (Or should I say \"Love On And On,\" which, according to Cathy at the website is in heavy rotation on WKTU in New York--I was fortunate enough to get a pirated copy of the single from Perfect Beat, before they were \"told\" to stop selling it). The song is a testimony to both how Donna set the stage for today's current dance music as well as a testimony to the fact that she can still do it better than anyone else--SHE HAS THE MAGIC!!!!\n\nSo, step aside KISS, your former-fellow Casablanca recording artist is staged for a comeback. And if only a small one, it will be a great victory for all of \"us.\" (How odd that all of the boys who tortured me in school for being gay and for loving Donna Summer could not see the irony in their own worship of a band called \"AC/DC.\").\n\nWhen I am done with graduate school, I am going to write a book about this....\n\n- Troy M. Burnett February, 1999"
