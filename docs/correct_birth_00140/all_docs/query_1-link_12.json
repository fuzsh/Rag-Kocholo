        "text": "Background\n\nBorn into a devout Christian family in Boston, Massachusetts, Summer became involved with music through singing in church choirs and later became involved with bands influenced by Motown Sound. Driven by the 1960s counterculture, she became the singer in a band called Crow and moved to New York. She was a rare gem in the disco scene, as her career began before the style’s explosion. Although she was one of the most well-known artists of the Disco Era, her repertoire included other genres such as R&B and rock, having won Grammys in these categories.\n\nAfter moving to Munich, Germany, she married Helmut Sommer and worked in various theaters performing in musicals such as the German version of “Hair.” In 1971, she released her first solo effort, ‘Sally Go Round the Roses,’ but to no avail. After meeting Giorgio Moroder and Pete Bellotte, she released her first L.P., “Lady of the Night” in 1975, with some success in Europe. Her song ‘Love to Love You Baby’ was a big hit there. Casablanca Records began distributing the L.P. in the U.S., making her a sensation there too. This was followed by a critically acclaimed 17-minute version of ‘Love to Love You Baby’ that set a standard now known as the ‘extended mix:’ extended versions aimed at the dance floor. Summer left Casablanca Records and signed with Geffen Records. Her first Geffen album in 1980 was “The Wanderer,” which included both R&B and rock influences. The next album, “I’m a Rainbow,” wasn’t released until 1996 because Geffen didn’t believe it was any good. Instead, Geffen had Summer leave Moroder and Bellotte, her longtime songwriters, and produce Quincy Jones on the follow-up album, “Donna Summer,” which featured the hits ‘Love is in Control (Finger on the Trigger)’ and the ballad ‘The Woman in Me.’ She also had the song ‘State of Independence’ with a New Age style.\n\nIn 1983, as part of the legal agreement signed with Casablanca Records, Summer released the album “She Works Hard For the Money,” produced by Michael Omartian, and what should have been just an obligation turned into a resounding success. Somewhat ostracized, Summer would return to dance music diva status through the album “Another Place and Time,” under production by Stock, Aitken, and Waterman, mentors to artists such as Rick Astley and Kylie Minogue. In 1991, “Mistaken Identity” was released, heavily influenced by R&B and to little acclaim. Only in 2008, Summer released a new album only of unreleased songs, titled “Crayons.” In between, the singer remained active, releasing several singles resulting from participation in soundtracks, compilations, and special projects such as ‘Carry On,’ ‘Melody of Love,’ ‘Whenever There is Love,’ ‘The Power of One’ and ‘I Will Go With You.’ In addition, in 1996, she participated in Liza Minnelli’s album “Gently,” in the duet ‘Does He Love You.’ After a successful life, Donna Summer died on May 17, 2012, on Manasota Key in Englewood, Florida from lung cancer."
