        "text": "BLACK HISTORY MONTH\n\nAs a Black woman, I try to frequently remind myself to laugh and smile, as it is something I can easily take for granted. Whenever Black History Month comes around each February, joy is something I like to add to compliment as I listen through speeches or when reading my favourite Black History poem. It's a conscious thing now, and I see it as a way of honouring our ancestors and the pioneers before us, and what better way to do that than through music?\n\nMusic, in particular, has been a powerful medium for expressing the emotions, struggles, and triumphs of the Black experience. Whether it’s through soul, jazz, blues, hip-hop, or various other genres, music has played a significant role in shaping and reflecting the history and culture of the Black community."
