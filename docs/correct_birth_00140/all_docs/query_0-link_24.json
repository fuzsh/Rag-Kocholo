        "text": "Massachusetts is famous for so many things. We have history, we have sports, actors, and yes, we have music! Below, you will see how deep we go in music, with 19 famous singers from Massachusetts.\n\nQuite a few iconic artists were born and/or raised here. I bet you can name at least a few of the super-famous singers right off the bat. But, I also bet you will name some you think are from here, and actually aren’t. Case in point, Steven Tyler of Aerosmith. Yes, the band was Boston based, but they moved here, after meeting and forming a band in New Hampshire. Tyler is actually from New York City. So he’s not among these 19 famous singers from Massachusetts.\n\nMisconceptions\n\nYou would think Rick Ocasek from the Boston based rock band The Cars was from here, right? He was not. How about J. Geils or Peter Wolf from the Boston based J. Geils Band? Not from Boston. The Standells who famously sing about Boston and it’s “Dirty Water” are from L.A. All of these acts are not among the 19 famous singers from Massachusetts on this list, as they were not born or raised in our great state.\n\nDigging Deep\n\nWith help of Google, the artists’ websites and my own personal knowledge, I’ve compiled a fairly comprehensive list of celebrity musicians and singers. I’m sure there are some that will be missed, but it’s a decent showing of talent from the Bay State. If you can think of any that should be added, please feel free to let me know.\n\nYou will recognize names from the rock world, country and pop music genres. There are singers from the past and present, representing quite an eclectic group. Some you may have seen performing our National Anthem at sporting events or at one of their shows locally. These artists are proud to call Massachusetts home, and we are proud to call them ours."
