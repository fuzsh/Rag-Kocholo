In the spirit of the Black Lives Matter movement and the recent denouncement of previously immortalized slave-owning and/or confederate historical persons, we are proposing that the Boston City Landmarks Committee replace the beheaded statue of Christopher Columbus with a statue of Boston legend, Donna Summer. Donna Summer born and raised in Dorchester, MA emerged from the 1960’s civil rights movement as a practicing figurehead of newfound liberty and freedom for Black Americans. Summer is often hailed as “The Queen of Disco” and made countless contributions to disco culture. Summer embodies the spirit of black pride, and to the city of Boston is an often-touted gem. Her likeness erected in bronze would be a symbol of the rebirth of the nation, a nation that is proud of its blackness, a nation that honors its culture and a nation that doesn’t hail the oppressor.
