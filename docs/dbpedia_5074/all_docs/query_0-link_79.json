It’s a pleasant, discreet Italian restaurant and I am at the quiet table that I requested. It was waiting for me along with a basket of rosemary and garlic flatbread and sweet-tomato chopped salad on the house. I’ve been here about 15 minutes when his publicist calls me. “Where are you? He’s waiting for you. He’s in the restaurant in a corner table.”\n\nI look up, walk round the slightly rustic bar and find him … at another corner table. I beckon him to join me. I’m slightly animated, nervy, foolish, but he summons me. I must join him. He has the same flatbread, but untouched."
