        "text": "Booze, drugs and women filled Don Johnson’s wild past... but not always in that order.\n\nThe star of cop shows Miami Vice and Nash Bridges rattled through multiple marriages and countless flings during three blurry decades in which, boy, did he party hard.\n\nBut despite women falling at his feet and wealth that provided a collection of 20 cars, boats, a jet and a sprawling ranch in Aspen, Colorado, Don came to realise one thing.\n\n“I was intensely unhappy,” he says.\n\nNow, with his 70th birthday just a fortnight away, the actor – still outrageously youthful – reflects on those wild days and reveals how life’s hard lessons and the teachings of Buddha have helped him find an inner peace.\n\nDon, who co-stars with Daniel Craig in murder mystery Knives Out, says: “We are all on a spiritual journey.\n\n\"Buddha says you don’t find the pearl of enlightenment on the beach. You have to break open a lot of oysters.\n\n“I broke open a lot of oysters, broke a lot of nails and suffered a lot of bloody noses. That’s how I learned my lessons.”\n\nThe road to contentment has, however, been long and winding. He careered through four decidedly unspiritual marriages – two annulled within days and two to Melanie Griffith.\n\nRecord\n\nThere were romances with Cybill Shepherd, Patti D’Arbanville and Barbra Streisand – and countless flings and one-night stands.\n\nDon fathered two children along the way, including Fifty Shades of Grey star Dakota Johnson, 30, his daughter with actress Melanie.\n\nThe booze and drugs were free-flowing, though he insists: “I never drank or did drugs while I was working. But, brother, when they said ‘wrap’ I would try to set the land speed record. I knew how to party too.”\n\nThe Johnson juggernaut only really slowed down in 1999 when he got married for the fifth time – to socialite Kelly Phleger, 50. They have three children and are still together.\n\nDon says: “I gave up my vices. I jettisoned that stuff. Quit smoking. I got rid of the 20 cars – I didn’t need them to get me laid.”\n\nWith his love life stable, Johnson’s career would take off again after a post-Nash Bridges lull. These days, off the back of acclaimed performances in Django Unchained and Book Club, he is in great demand.\n\nAs well as Knives Out he stars in the new superhero TV series Watchmen, based on the classic graphic novel.\n\nAnd he even finds unexpected spirituality here, saying: “Superheroes are a metaphor for something unrealised in ourselves. We need to be something else to be satisfied and content, when we are actually enough, and plenty.\n\n“As actors we start out feeling that way and wanting to fill that void.\n\n“Through training, spirituality and education you come to know that you are enough, and you don’t need anything extra.”\n\nThese wise words are in stark contrast to the get high, get drunk and get laid mantra of the young Don Johnson.\n\nRaised in poverty in Wichita, Kansas, he was 22 when he first hooked up with 14-year-old Melanie Griffith – apparently without ­objection from her mother, actress Tippi Hedren.\n\n“I did feel a little strange picking her up after school,” he admits.\n\nThey split after four years, but a year later ran off to tie the knot for the first time. Plagued by substance abuse, they lasted barely six months.\n\nJohnson had a son, Jesse, with actress Patti D’Arban-ville, 68, but admits: “I had pretty much killed my career letting my body get out of shape from drugs and alcohol.\n\n\"When I’d go for roles they would say, ‘I think he’s had it.’”\n\nDon belatedly cleaned up his act and was 35 when cast as Sonny Crockett alongside Philip Michael Thomas in Miami Vice.\n\nPride\n\nBut he partied hard once more and admits returning to his old vices. “We had a lot of fun,” he laughs.\n\nMiami Vice ran from 1984 to 1989 – when Don and Melanie remarried. He is “bursting with pride” at the success of daughter Dakota.\n\nBut he won’t watch her Fifty Shades movies, ­admitting: “There are some images as a father that you don’t need in your head.”\n\nThese days Don is not always cast as the leading man but it doesn’t worry him\n\n“I like characters that are flawed,” he says. “I don’t mind if the parts are small; they are only as small as you let your mind believe they are. If it’s an interesting character and an ­interesting part I am game.”\n\nIn Knives Out he plays what he calls “a ­trophy husband. A lovable douchebag”.\n\nHe loved bonding with Daniel Craig and a cast that also includes Christopher Plummer, Jamie Lee Curtis and Captain America star Chris Evans.\n\nDon says: “We spoke about some of my love affairs that I didn’t even remember. Good ones, apparently.\n\n\"It was fantastic, like being in ­summer camp again. I asked Daniel about Bond stunts and he asked me about Miami Vice. Stories about stunts and injuries. Superhero shop talk.\n\n“We told the younger ones lies. Christopher Plummer talked about meeting Marilyn Monroe.\n\n“Jamie Lee was cooking potato soup for us.”\n\nIt is great to hear Don on such fine form – and, with a Nash Bridges TV movie on the ­horizon, grateful to have ­outlived his wild years.\n\n“I’m happy to have ­survived it,” he says. “A lot of people don’t.”\n\nDon turns 70 on December 15. But is there a big party?\n\nHe says coyly: “I have a lot of kids, They’ll figure out something.”"
