        "text": "More like Don Juan-son.\n\nLike a fine wine, Don Johnson’s sex life has apparently gotten better with age. During a Wednesday appearance on “Radio Andy,” the 71-year-old “Miami Vice” star said that his prowess in the boudoir has improved over the years, and that he’s gotten sparkling reviews from his ex-lovers, who include the likes of Melanie Griffith and Cybil Shepherd, the Daily Mail reported.\n\nWhen asked by host Andy Cohen, 53, if his sex drive remains as active as in his youth, Johnson replied with a straightforward “Yes.”\n\nThe Golden Globe winner insisted that not only did his appetite for nookie not wane but that he “never” wished it would.\n\n‘[I’ve] never once had that thought,” admitted the “Knives Out” star, whose 32-year-old daughter Dakota Johnson starred in the raunchy 2015 S&M flick “Fifty Shades Of Grey.”\n\nThe lothario added, “You actually get better at it … I have turned it into a science.”\n\nLater on, Johnson postulated about whether prior lovers would concur that he’s an assassin in the sack after Cohen quipped, “All rave reviews on Yelp for Don Johnson.”\n\n“Well, I can’t guarantee that, you know, circumstances being what they are. You never know what you have to work with,” the aged whoopie wizard mused. “I’m feeling pretty good about the review situation.”\n\nThis endorsement is high praise given the sex-loving septuagenarian’s all-star lineup of past lovers.\n\nJohnson was previously married to ex-wife Melanie Griffith — mother of his daughter Dakota — whom he wed in 1976. The pair subsequently divorced and then remarried in 1989, before breaking it off yet again in 1996. The Casanova is currently married to Kelley Phleger, with whom he has three children: daughter Atherton and sons Jasper and Deacon. Meanwhile, other partners have included Cybill Shepherd, Patti D’Arbanville and Barbra Streisand, along with countless one-night stands.\n\nThe father of five claims that his reputation in the sack is so good that women have approached him for hanky-panky.\n\n“I’ve had that happen,” Johnson admitted, adding that he has “never felt any of that pressure because most of my customers leave satisfied.”"
