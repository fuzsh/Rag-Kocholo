Kelley’s experience in education and her nurturing approach bring a sense of warmth and support to the family dynamic. This section delves into Jasper’s family background, exploring the professional and personal achievements of his parents and their influence on his life.\n\nFamily Connections\n\nJasper is one of three biological siblings, including his sister Atherton Grace, who is gaining recognition in the modeling world, and his brother Deacon. In addition to his biological siblings, Jasper has a close relationship with his half-siblings, Dakota Johnson and Jesse Wayne, from his father’s earlier relationships.\n\nDon Johnson is a dad to three sons and two daughters\n\nDon Johnson takes immense pride in his five children, each of whom has brought unique joy and meaning to his life. His journey into fatherhood began with actress Patti D’Arbanville. The couple welcomed their son, Jesse Wayne, in 1982. Johnson has often expressed that Jesse’s arrival marked a pivotal moment in his life, attributing the newborn with giving him a new purpose and direction.\n\nJohnson’s family grew in 1989 when he reunited with Melanie Griffith, his former wife. After remarrying, the couple welcomed their daughter, Dakota Mayi, into the world. Their relationship history was complex, having married and divorced more than a decade prior, but the birth of Dakota marked a joyous new chapter for them.\n\nThough Johnson and Griffith eventually parted ways, Johnson’s journey to find lasting love continued. He found it with Kelley Phleger, whom he married in 1999. Together, they expanded their family with the addition of three more children: Atherton Grace, Jasper Breckenridge, and Deacon James. Reflecting on his experiences as a father to both his older and younger children, Johnson revealed a more relaxed approach with his younger ones, yet his excitement and joy remained as vibrant as ever. “I love kids, so it’s more good times, more joy, and more fun. It’s no less exciting this time than it was the first time,” he shared with OK! Magazine after the birth of his youngest son, Deacon, in 2006.\n\nDon Johnson’s five children—Jesse, Dakota, Atherton, Jasper, and Deacon—each hold a special place in his heart, illustrating the deep bonds and cherished moments they share as a family.\n\nJesse Wayne Johnson 41\n\nJesse Wayne Johnson, born on December 7, 1982, in Los Angeles, marked the beginning of Don Johnson’s journey into fatherhood. Jesse is the son of Don Johnson and Patti D’Arbanville, a relationship that played a pivotal role in Don’s life.\n\nDuring the 1970s, Don Johnson struggled with addiction issues related to drugs and alcohol. However, the birth of Jesse became a turning point for him. In a candid interview with PEOPLE in 1984, Don recalled a morning when he saw Patti feeding baby Jesse in the breakfast room. He described the moment as a wake-up call, realizing he needed to change his ways to keep his family together. “I came staggering in and sat down and looked at them, and she looked at me and I knew that if I didn’t do something she was going to leave. So I said, ‘Patti, I’m a drunk and a drug addict, and I’m going to do something about it.’” This revelation led Don to attend an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting, and within 45 days, he achieved sobriety.\n\nJesse grew up in the picturesque town of Aspen, Colorado, where he developed a love for the outdoors and sports such as snowboarding and ice hockey. Despite his Hollywood heritage, Jesse spent his early years away from the spotlight, joining his family at red carpet events only occasionally.\n\nIt wasn’t until adulthood that Jesse decided to pursue a career in entertainment, following in his father’s footsteps. He studied theater at Occidental College in Los Angeles, graduating in 2004. His acting debut came as a teenager with a minor role in Don Johnson’s popular TV series, Nash Bridges. Since then, Jesse has built an impressive resume, with appearances in TV shows like Hawaii Five-0, Twin Peaks, Grey’s Anatomy, and NCIS.\n\nIn addition to acting, Jesse is also passionate about music. He shared a nostalgic photo from 1998 of himself playing guitar, highlighting his long-standing connection to music. In October 2020, his band Blame Baby released their debut EP, “Honest Answers To Your Most Private Questions.” The following year, Jesse collaborated with two friends to release a collection of songs titled “Trésjeté.”\n\nJesse Wayne Johnson’s journey from a transformative childhood to a multifaceted career in entertainment and music illustrates his dynamic talents and resilience.\n\nDakota Mayi Johnson 34: From Hollywood Childhood to Stardom\n\nDakota Mayi Johnson, born on October 4, 1989, in Austin, Texas, is the daughter of Don Johnson and Melanie Griffith. At the time of her birth, Don was in Texas filming the movie Hot Spot. Shortly after the completion of the film, the family returned to Los Angeles, although their stay was brief.\n\nIn a 2017 interview with Vogue, Dakota revealed that her early years were marked by constant travel with her actor parents, which left her feeling unsettled. Without a stable home base, she described her childhood as being “consistently unmoored and discombobulated.” By age three, she was already attending therapy sessions to cope with the instability.\n\nReflecting on her childhood, Dakota told Another Magazine in 2015 that she felt as though she “grew up in the circus,” surrounded by talented, eccentric individuals and constantly traveling by planes, trains, and automobiles. When she wasn’t on the move, she split her time between her mother’s home in Los Angeles and her father’s ranch in Colorado. She also spent periods at her grandmother Tippi Hedren’s big cat sanctuary in the California desert. Stability came only when she enrolled in a private school in Santa Monica, California, where she remained for several consecutive years.\n\nDakota’s interest in modeling began at the age of 12 after participating in a Teen Vogue photo shoot featuring celebrity children. This experience led her to sign with the modeling agency IMG while she was still in high school. In 2006, she followed in her mother’s footsteps by being named Miss Golden Globe, becoming the first second-generation recipient of the title.\n\nDakota’s film debut came in 1999 with a role in Crazy in Alabama, acting alongside her mother. Despite her parents’ reservations about her pursuing an acting career, Dakota was determined. She applied to Juilliard to study acting but was not accepted. Following this, her father cut off financial support, as he had conditioned his support on her attending school.\n\nUndeterred, Dakota moved to West Hollywood and began auditioning for roles. Her perseverance paid off when she landed a role as Sean Parker’s one-night stand in The Social Network. This role was a stepping stone to further opportunities, including roles in 21 Jump Street, The Five-Year Engagement, and the TV series Ben and Kate. Her breakthrough came in 2013 when she was cast as Anastasia Steele in Fifty Shades of Grey, catapulting her to international fame.\n\nSince then, Dakota has maintained a busy acting schedule, with notable roles in The Peanut Butter Falcon, Bad Times at the El Royale, and Suspiria. Don Johnson once mentioned on Late Night with Seth Meyers that they hadn’t seen each other in a while due to her hectic filming schedule. “She doesn’t really call me for advice. She calls me to say, ‘Gosh, I would see you, but I’ve got three pictures that I’m shooting at the same time,'” he said.\n\nDespite the limited time they spend together, Don Johnson expressed immense pride in his daughter’s achievements. In a 2016 interview with E! News, he said he was “super proud” of Dakota’s accomplishments both on and off the screen. In 2021, during an interview on Good Day New York, he also gave his approval of Dakota’s long-term boyfriend, Coldplay’s Chris Martin, whom she began dating in 2017.\n\nAtherton Grace Johnson: A Rising Star in Fashion and Photography\n\nAtherton Grace Johnson, known simply as Grace, was born on December 28, 1999, to Don Johnson and his wife Kelley Phleger. As the couple’s first child together, Grace grew up largely out of the public eye, enjoying a relatively private childhood in Santa Barbara, California, as highlighted by Santa Barbara Magazine.\n\nGrace’s early life was spent away from the spotlight, rarely appearing with her well-known family. She developed a passion for photography, influenced by her grandmother, which led her to study the art form at the University of Southern California. In an interview with Glamour Spain, she shared that her grandmother’s love for photography deeply inspired her own creative pursuits.\n\nWhile her passion lies behind the camera, Grace has also made significant strides in front of it. She signed with IMG Models and made her runway debut in 2019 during the Christian Cowan x The Powerpuff Girls show. That same year, she made a notable appearance at the Met Gala alongside her sister Dakota, whom she regards as her “best friend.” Grace described their bond to Glamour Spain, saying, “My relationship with Dakota is a mix because she is not just my sister, she is my best friend. For a long time, regardless of the age difference, she has always treated me as an equal.”\n\nSince her debut, Grace’s modeling career has flourished. She graced the cover of Bello magazine and walked in Gucci’s 2021 Love Parade show. Additionally, she featured in a campaign for Goop’s collaboration with Banana Republic and appeared in her brother Jesse’s music video for the song “Headcase.”\n\nGrace Johnson’s journey is a blend of artistic expression and modeling success, marked by her unique contributions to both fields.\n\nJasper Breckenridge Johnson: A Journey Through Sports and Education\n\nJasper Breckenridge Johnson, the second child of Don Johnson and Kelley Phleger, was born on June 6, 2002.

Don Johnson’s representative shared the family’s joy, saying Don was “over the moon times six” with the arrival of Deacon.\n\nGrowing up in Santa Barbara, Deacon has enjoyed a supportive and nurturing environment similar to his older siblings. He graduated from middle school in 2020, as shared by Phleger on her Instagram. His parents often post about his various interests, showcasing his talents in playing both the piano and guitar.\n\nFollowing the family’s athletic tradition, Deacon has developed a love for sports.
