        "text": "ASPEN, Colo. -- Actor Don Johnson and actress Melanie Griffith, whose marriage 13 years ago ended less than a year later, exchanged vows a second time in a low-key ceremony held at the actor's mountainside ranch, their publicist said Tuesday.\n\nJohnson, 39, the former star of the television series 'Miami Vice,' and Academy Award nominee Griffith, 31, were married about 6:30 p.m. Monday in the woods near Johnson's ranch at Little Woody Creek, an exclusive community 10 miles northwest of Aspen, said Elliot Mintz, publicist for both celebrities.\n\nJohnson married Griffith, daughter of actress Tippi Hedren, in 1976, but the couple filed for divorce less than a year later. They reconciled late last year and kept their wedding date a secret.\n\n'It was a very traditional wedding, very low-key by Hollywood standards,' Mintz told United Press International. 'There were no stars, just close friends and family.'\n\nJohnson's parents and Hedren, star of the Hitchcock film, 'The Birds,' were among those in attendance, Mintz said.\n\nGriffith was dressed in a white, lace dress and Johnson in a white tuxedo, Mintz said. The entire ceremony lasted about 10 minutes, he said, adding that a string quartet provided the music and guests were served food from the porch of the ranch house. The evening ended about 10:30 p.m.\n\nMintz said he did not know if the couple would have a second honeymoon.\n\nRoads leading to the marriage site were closed, but two helicopters carrying paparazzi and reporters from tabloid press hovered over the scene as about 30 guests witnessed the brief, nondenominational ceremony.\n\nWitnesses reported seeing dozens of balloons drift from the area, apparently released when the marriage ceremony was completed.\n\nJohnson and Griffith, who are expecting the arrival of their first child, a girl, in early October, were surrounded by several bodyguards earlier Monday as they obtained a marriage license at the Pitkin County Courthouse in Aspen.\n\nIn 1980, Johnson began a relationship with actress Patti D'Arbanville and the two had a son, Jesse, in 1982. They split up in 1985. Jesse attended Monday's wedding, Mintz said.\n\nJohnson and Griffith recently were seen back in each other's company, including attending this year's Oscars ceremony. Griffith was nominated for an Oscar for her role in 'Working Girl,' where she played alongside Harrison Ford and Sigourney Weaver as a secretary determined to climb the corporate ladder.\n\nJohnson, voted TV Guide's top television sex symbol in 1986, is best known for his starring role as an unshaven undercover detective on NBC's Miami Vice, which concluded its final season this year. An aspiring singer-guitarist, he also recorded a hit pop record in 1986. A second album is due out in September."
