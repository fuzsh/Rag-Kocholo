        "text": "Sean Penn is a powerhouse film performer capable of intensely moving work, who has gone from strength to strength during a colourful film career, and who has drawn much media attention for his stormy private life and political viewpoints.\n\nSean Justin Penn was born in Los Angeles, California, the second son of actress Eileen Ryan (née Annucci) and director, actor, and writer Leo Penn. His brother was actor Chris Penn. His father was from a Lithuanian Jewish/Russian Jewish family, and his mother is of half Italian and half Irish descent.\n\nPenn first appeared in roles as strong-headed or unruly youths such as the military cadet defending his academy against closure in Die Kadetten von Bunker Hill (1981), then as fast-talking surfer stoner Jeff Spicoli in Ich glaub' ich steh' im Wald (1982).\n\nFans and critics were enthused about his obvious talent and he next contributed a stellar performance alongside Timothy Hutton in the Cold War spy thriller Der Falke Und Der Schneemann (1985), followed by a teaming with icy Christopher Walken in the chilling Auf kurze Distanz (1986). The youthful Sean then paired up with his then wife, pop diva Madonna in the woeful, and painful, Shanghai Surprise (1986), which was savaged by the critics, but Sean bounced back with a great job as a hot-headed young cop in Colors - Farben der Gewalt (1988), gave another searing performance as a US soldier in Vietnam committing atrocities in Die Verdammten des Krieges (1989) and appeared alongside Robert De Niro in the uneven comedy Wir sind keine Engel (1989). However, the 1990s was the decade in which Sean really got noticed by critics as a mature, versatile and accomplished actor, with a string of dynamic performances in first-class films.\n\nAlmost unrecognisable with frizzy hair and thin rimmed glasses, Penn was simply brilliant as corrupt lawyer David Kleinfeld in the Brian De Palma gangster movie Carlito's Way (1993) and he was still in trouble with authority as a Death Row inmate pleading with a caring nun to save his life in Dead Man Walking - Sein letzter Gang (1995), for which he received his first Oscar nomination. Sean then played the brother of wealthy Michael Douglas, involving him in a mind-snapping scheme in The Game - Das Geschenk seines Lebens (1997) and also landed the lead role of Sgt. Eddie Walsh in the star-studded anti-war film Der schmale Grat (1998), before finishing the 1990s playing an offbeat jazz musician (and scoring another Oscar nomination) in Sweet and Lowdown (1999).\n\nThe gifted and versatile Sean had also moved into directing, with the quirky but interesting Indian Runner (1991), about two brothers with vastly opposing views on life, and in 1995 he directed Jack Nicholson in Crossing Guard (1995). Both films received overall positive reviews from critics. Moving into the new century, Sean remained busy in front of the cameras with even more outstanding work: a mentally disabled father fighting for custody of his seven-year-old daughter (and receiving a third Oscar nomination) for Ich bin Sam (2001); an anguished father seeking revenge for his daughter's murder in the gut-wrenching Clint Eastwood-directed Mystic River (2003) (for which he won the Oscar as Best Actor); a mortally ill college professor in 21 Gramm (2003) and a possessed businessman in Attentat auf Richard Nixon (2004).\n\nCertainly Sean Penn is one of Hollywood's most controversial, progressive and gifted actors.\n\nBest known for his starring role as Det. Sonny Crockett on the hugely successful TV series Miami Vice (1984), Don Johnson is one of the stars who really defined the 1980s. As James \"Sonny\" Crockett he went toe-to-toe with drug dealers, pimps, prostitutes, assassins, illegal arms-dealers and crooked cops on a weekly basis from 1984 to 1989, appearing in a grand total of 110 episodes. The show, which was executive-produced by four time Oscar-nominated director, producer and writer Michael Mann, paired Johnson with the equally cool Philip Michael Thomas as Det. Ricardo Tubbs and the calm and stoic presence of Edward James Olmos as Lt. Martin Castillo. It revolutionized television with its modern fashion, pop music, unique style and use of real locations. Johnson typically wore $1000 Armani, Versace and Hugo Boss suits over pastel cotton T-shirts, drove a Ferrari 365 GTS/4 Daytona (later a Ferrari Testarossa) and lived on an Endeavour 42-foot sailboat named \"St. Vitus' Dance\" with his pet alligator Elvis. He also had full use of an offshore powerboat. Still, \"Miami Vice\" had not only style but substance, and his portrayal of the Vietnam veteran turned vice detective turned Sonny Crockett into the world's favorite cop. For his work on \"Miami Vice\" Johnson won a Golden Globe for Best Performance by an Actor in a TV Series in 1986, and was nominated in the same category a year later. He also picked up an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series in 1985.\n\nJohnson was born in Flat Creek, Missouri, the son Eva Lea \"Nell\" (Wilson), a beautician, and Wayne Fred Johnson, a farmer. As a kid, he wanted to become a professional bowler. Later, after a few brushes with the law at a young age, he discovered acting. After working on the stage for a while he ventured into films and television, but was not able to break into stardom despite, among other things, starring in the sci-fi cult classic Der Junge mit dem Hund (1975).\n\nJohnson starred in four failed TV pilots before landing his career-high role on \"Miami Vice\", which propelled him to superstardom. He directed four highly praised episodes of the show. He balanced his work on the series by appearing in a praised TV-movie adaption of the William Faulkner novel Flammender Sommer (1985) and the feature Sweethearts Dance - Liebe ist mehr als nur ein Wort (1988) with Susan Sarandon. After the series ended he focused solely on his film career. Although movies like Dead Bang - Kurzer Prozess (1989), The Hot Spot - Spiel mit dem Feuer (1990) and Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man (1991) did not fare well with the critics, quite a few of them have obtained a considerable cult following, with fans praising them as all being quality contributions to their genre. His film work has given Johnson the opportunity to work with legendary filmmakers like John Frankenheimer, Sidney Lumet and Dennis Hopper.\n\nAfter working steadily, Johnson returned to TV in 1996 with the cop show Nash Bridges (1996). The show, which Johnson created and produced, did very well. It co-starred Cheech Marin and Jodi Lyn O'Keefe. Johnson played the title role, a captain in the San Francisco PD's Special Investigations Unit. He was again paired with a flashy vehicle, this time an electric-yellow 1971 Plymouth Barracuda convertible. After \"Nash Bridges\" went off the air Johnson kept a low profile, but continued to appear in films and on television. He starred in the failed WB courtroom drama Just Legal (2005), which was produced by Jerry Bruckheimer, and traveled to Europe to make the Norwegian screwball comedy Lange flate ballær II (2008) and the Italian films Bastardi (2008) and Torno a vivere da solo (2008). As a supporting actor, he's been seen in mainstream films such as Machete (2010), Django Unchained (2012) and Knives Out: Mord ist Familiensache (2019).\n\nJohnson had two pre-fame marriages that were annulled within a matter of days. In the early 1970s, he lived with rock groupie Pamela Des Barres. In 1972, Tippi Hedren, his co-star in The Harrad Experiment (1973), allowed him to date her daughter Melanie Griffith despite the fact she was only 14 and he was 22; the relationship culminated in a six-month marriage during 1976. From 1981 to 1985, he lived with actress Patti D'Arbanville and they had one son together. After short-lived liaisons with Cybill Shepherd, Barbra Streisand and a barely legal Uma Thurman, he remarried Griffith in 1989. The couple divorced again in 1996, after she left him for Antonio Banderas. Johnson was engaged to \"Nash Bridges\" co-star O'Keefe, but broke it off before they made it to the altar. Since 1999 he's been married to former debutante Kelley Phleger, with whom he has three children.\n\nAlice Jane Evans was born in 1968 to David Evans, a professor of Applied Mathematics at Bristol University and Janet Evans, a teacher of English literature. Alice gained a degree in French and Italian from University College, London, and then moved to Paris where she studied acting at the Cours Florent. She quickly began to work, mainly in French television but also in the very successful Italian miniseries Le ragazze di Piazza di Spagna (1998) as \"Nathalie\", a French student who is forced to come to grips with the realities of life when she finds out she is pregnant by a man she is not supposed to be with. This was particularly challenging as Alice played the role in Italian, but had to loop the entire film later on because her own accent in Italian sounded too British and not French enough! Her first big break came when her first feature, Monsieur Naphtali (1999) was brought to the attention of Oscar-winning director Claude Lelouch, who invited her to audition for a film he was writing, Une pour toutes (1999) and, after three callbacks, cast her in one of the three lead roles. Alice played \"Macha\", one of three actresses who, after a failed production of Anton Chekhov's \"Three Sisters\", invent a scheme to swindle wealthy men out of money and eventually end up making the film of the story of their lives. The film was a critical, if not commercial success. Anne Parillaud and Marianne Denicourt co-starred.\n\nAside from an episode of TV show \"Highlander\", Alice did not act in her mother tongue, English, until 1999 when Disney cast her as the lead in 102 Dalmatiner (2000) alongside Glenn Close, Gérard Depardieu and Ioan Gruffudd. This was a huge break for Alice but it was marred by tragedy. Her beloved mother, Janet, suffered a fatal heart attack whilst out walking her dog, less than 24 hours before Alice's final screen test for the role. The story goes that she never told her mother about the test and was hoping to surprise her if she won the role. Janet was only 59. In a strange twist, the actor she first met only hours after losing her mother was to become her closest friend. Alice became very close to Ioan Gruffudd during the shoot and they became a couple in late 2000. They got engaged in 2005.\n\nIn 2000, Alice shot Best of Both Worlds (2001) for the BBC, in which she played \"Diane\", an air stewardess who is a wife and mother, who begins a relationship with a man in Italy, where she flies three times a week and eventually marries him and embarks on a double life. The series was written by acclaimed writer Paul Abbott and Alice received glowing reviews for her performance. In 2002, she was cast by Mel Smith as the lead in Blackball (2003) alongside James Cromwell and Vince Vaughn. The film was a commercial and critical flop and other commercially unsuccessful British and European films followed. Perhaps because of this, Alice moved to Los Angeles, California in 2003. In the United States, she has worked in both film (Four Corners of Suburbia (2005)) and television (CSI: Miami (2002), The Chris Isaak Show (2001)), although she still continues to work in the United Kingdom, most recently alongside Alistair McGowan in a new series for BBC One and with Billy Boyd and Eva Birthistle in the Independent feature Save Angel Hope (2007).\n\nShe lives in West Hollywood with her husband, actor Ioan Gruffudd. She gave birth to their first child, Ella Betsi Janet Gruffudd, on September 6, 2009.\n\nAfter earning her high school diploma, Francesca Dellera moved to Rome where she began working as a model.\n\nHer physical beauty, in this phase of her career, landed her image on the covers of national and international publications. Her portrait was taken by the greatest names in photography including Helmut Newton, Dominique Isserman, Greg Gorman, Michael Comte, Andre Rau and many others. Francesca Dellera was born to be a model, but it wasn't long before the film industry took notice of her.\n\nThanks to her voluptuous beauty, director Tinto Brass debuted her in his movie Capriccio (Love & Passion), while she played a role in the 3-part TV miniseries La Romana directed by Giuseppe Patroni Griffi, the television adaptation of the film of the same name directed by Luigi Zampa in 1954, which in turn was adapted from the novel by Alberto Moravia (Francesca, Sofia Loren, Claudia Cardinale and Stefania Sandrelli were chosen by the great author for one of his very rare interviews). The miniseries attracted a television audience of more than 10 million viewers who watched her play the lead, supported by Gina Lollobrigida. Her work in this role earned her a Telegatto in 1989, but it was her work in the movie La Carne directed by one of the greatest names in Italian cinema, Marco Ferreri, that earned her international fame. Ferreri's muse and his inspiration, he has said of Francesca that she has \"the most beautiful skin in Italian cinema\". The film debuted to great acclaim at Cannes.\n\nBeloved in France for her Mediterranean sensuality, she was one of the international actresses present in the book that Cannes dedicated to the 50th anniversary of its Film Festival.\n\nHer success continued in France and, after filming L'Ours en peluche by Jacques Deray alongside international stars such as Alain Delon, she became a favourite model of Jean Paul Gaultier, who used her in his fashion shows, a privilege only afforded to great stars such as Madonna.\n\nAfter spending a few more years in France, Dellera returned to Rome to play the lead role in Nanà, a 2-part television miniseries directed by Alberto Negrin, which was an adaptation of the novel of the same name by Émile Zola.\n\nShe was also the star of the television movie La Contessa di Castiglione, co-produced with a French television production company, directed by French director, Josée Dayan, in which she played alongside Sergio Rubini and Jeanne Moreau.\n\nThe advertising campaigns in which Dellera appeared have also had enormous impact. She was recognized for her work in the best advert of the year, directed by Maurizio Nichetti for \"IP\". Dellera has also been the testimonial in several other successful campaigns for famous brands.\n\n\"The physical presence of Francesca Dellera speaks for itself. She has that something special that only the most riveting screen actresses have. She is right at home in front of the camera; when she is clothed, she seems naked and when she is naked she seems clothed.\" (Tullio Kezich)\n\n\"Unlike the asexual canons of beauty of our times, Francesca Dellera is a throwback to the beauty of the past; her soft, white skin is rarely seen any more. Today, femininity is vulgar and completely asexual, as television and fashion demands\". (Natalia Aspesi)\n\nUte Lemper has left her mark on the stage, in films, in concert and as a unique recording artist on more than 30 albums over 30 years of career. She has been universally praised for her interpretations of Berlin Cabaret Songs, the works of Kurt Weill and Bertolt Brecht and the chansons of Marlene Dietrich, Édith Piaf and many others. She became a world-famous musical star, playing Sally Bowles in Paris, Lola Lola in Der blaue Engel (1930) in an ill-fated Berlin production directed by Peter Zadek, and Velma Kelly on Broadway and in London's West End. She actually started her career playing \"Cats\" in Vienna, then went on to star as \"Peter Pan\" in Berlin before acting in plays by Rainer Werner Fassbinder and Jérôme Savary in Stuttgart. In Paris, she won the prestigious Molière Award, in London she was honored with the Laurence Olivier Award, and in the US, they presented her with the Theatre World Award for her stunning portrayals.\n\nPerfectly fluent in German, French, and English, Miss Lemper has toured the entire world with her one-woman shows, i. e. \"The Bukowski Project\", \"The 9 Secrets\", and \"Rendezvous with Marlene\". Her Grammy-nominated album \"Paris Days/Berlin Nights\" was an overwhelming success in 2012. Maurice Béjart created a ballet especially for her while Michael Nyman, impressed with her versatile voice, composed a song cycle for her to record on CD.\n\nBorn in Münster, Germany, Miss Lemper studied at the Max Reinhardt Seminary Drama School in Vienna and completed her dance studies in Cologne. In her native Germany, she first rose to stardom in a television series: Das Erbe der Guldenburgs (1987) was a star-studded rip-off of American soap operas in the vein of Der Denver-Clan (1981) and Dallas (1978). Herein, Miss Lemper portrayed Peggy Brinkley, a rock singer who falls in love with Alexander von Guldenburg (Jochen Horst).\n\nHer first big foray into films came in 1990 when she made L'Autrichienne (1990) with director Pierre Granier-Deferre. The film was not a big hit upon its release but has since gained a cult-following with Miss Lemper's sensitive portrayal being singled out and praised enthusiastically. She played Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart in Not Mozart: Letters, Riddles and Writs (1991), Ceres in Prosperos Bücher (1991), and a sexy model in Jean Galmot - Flammen über Cayenne (1990). Robert Altman gave her a small but showy part in Prêt-à-Porter (1994). (She was nine months pregnant with her first child when she walked down a runway naked.) Miss Lemper then went on to star alongside Daniel Craig in Smoke Wrings (1996) (obviously pregnant again) and with Whoopi Goldberg and Gérard Depardieu in Bogus (1996), directed by Norman Jewison. In Germany, she provided the singing voices of Ariel in Arielle, die Meerjungfrau (1989) and Esmeralda in Der Glöckner von Notre Dame (1996). But her focus never really was on doing films, so she semi-retired after delivering fine performances in little-seen films like Der Mann im Lift (1997) and Die Unbekannte aus der Seine (2003).\n\nMiss Lemper is now a full-time musician, songwriter and stage personality. She married Todd Turkisher in 2011 and is a devoted mother of four. She moved to New York City permanently in 1998.\n\nMary Debra Winger was born May 16, 1955 in Cleveland, Ohio, to Ruth (Felder), an office manager, and Robert Jack Winger, a meat packer. She is from a Jewish family (originally from Austria-Hungary and the Russian Empire). Her maternal grandparents called her Mary, while her parents called her Debra (her father named her Debra after his favorite actress, Debra Paget). The family moved to California when Debra was five. She fell in love with acting in high school but kept it a secret from her family. She was a precocious teenager, having graduated high school at an early age of 15. She enrolled in college, majoring in criminology. She worked part-time in the local amusement park when she got thrown from a truck and suffered serious injuries and went temporarily blind for several months. She was in the hospital when she vowed to pursue her passion for acting.\n\nAfter she recovered, she abandoned college and studied acting. Like any struggling actor, she did commercials and guest-starred on 70s TV shows like Task Force: Part I (1976) and Wonder Woman (1975), where she performed as Diana's little sister, Wonder Girl. She also made her feature film debut in the embarrassing soft-core porn film, Slumber Party '57 (1976). (Years later on Inside the Actors Studio (1994), host James Lipton asked her to name her first film, and she refused to answer him.) Her next two films, Wer geht denn noch zur Uni? (1979) and Gottseidank, es ist Freitag (1978), did absolutely nothing for her career. When Sissy Spacek said no to playing the character Sissy in Urban Cowboy (1980), almost every young actress in Hollywood pursued the role. Debra won the role over a then-unknown Michelle Pfeiffer and gave a star-making performance as John Travolta's wife. Her handling of the mechanical bull made her a new kind of sex symbol. She would always remain grateful to her director James Bridges for threatening to quit the film if the studio didn't cast her. However, she followed it up with a flop, Die Straße der Ölsardinen (1982). But, she became part of one of the top-grossing films of all time by providing her deep, throaty voice to the title character of E.T. - Der Außerirdische (1982) as a favor to the film's director Steven Spielberg (Note: IMDB cast list for E.T. indicates Pat Welsh as the voice for that character.). She also appeared in the film for a few seconds in the Halloween scene, where she is wearing a zombie mask and carrying a poodle. She received her first Academy Award nomination as Best Actress for the huge hit, Ein Offizier und Gentleman (1982), where her on-screen love scenes with Richard Gere became just as legendary as her off-screen fights with him and with director Taylor Hackford.\n\nDebra's reputation as a great talent, as well as her reputation as a difficult actress grew with her next film, Zeit der Zärtlichkeit (1983), which not only earned her a second Oscar nomination as Best Actress but also won the Best Picture as well. She also earned the Best Actress Award from the National Society of Film Critics. Debra was at the top of her game and was the most sought-after actress in Hollywood, but she turned down quality roles and lucrative offers for three years. Some speculated that the reason was her romantic involvement with Bob Kerrey, then-governor of Nebraska, while others have stated it was her back problems. Whatever her reasons were, her career lost its heat. Her long-delayed film Mike's Murder (1984), reuniting her with her \"Urban Cowboy\" director James Bridges, didn't help matters either when it became a critical and financial flop. Debra tried to revive her career by starring in the big-budget comedy Staatsanwälte küsst man nicht (1986), but she disliked the film so much that she publicly stated that the director, Ivan Reitman, was one of the two worst directors she worked with, the other director being Taylor Hackford (Ein Offizier und Gentleman (1982)). She also walked out on her agency, CAA, but returned several years later.\n\nHer personal life made headlines when she left Bob Kerrey and eloped with Oscar-winning actor Timothy Hutton in 1986. In 1987, she gave birth to their son, Noah Hutton. She also starred in Die schwarze Witwe (1987), which wasn't a hit, and acted alongside Hutton as a male angel in Made in Heaven (1987) which flopped. She followed that up by starring in another flop, Verraten (1988), which featured a fleeting cameo by Hutton. She separated from Hutton in 1988 and they divorced in 1990, at which time she had two more bombs, Everybody Wins - Ein schmutziges Spiel (1990) and Himmel über der Wüste (1990). However, she relished the experience on Himmel über der Wüste (1990) so much that she stayed in the Sahara desert long after filming wrapped. She came back to US and filmed a Steve Martin vehicle, Der Schein-Heilige (1992), which did nothing for her career. But, she found love on the set of her next film, Die Sache mit dem Feuer (1993) when she co-starred opposite Arliss Howard, who became her next husband. The film flopped but their marriage lasted. She received good notices for Eine gefährliche Frau (1993), but it was Shadowlands - Ein Geschenk des Augenblicks (1993) which finally brought her renewed respectability and her third Academy Award nomination as Best Actress. She followed that up with a forgettable comedy, Vergiß Paris (1995). Then, she signed to do \"Divine Rapture\" with Marlon Brando and Johnny Depp in a small village in Ireland, but two weeks into filming, financing fell apart, and the film was never completed. Winger was never paid for her work, and neither were the poor villagers, and Winger said she was devastated for them. Now 40, Debra felt that there were no good roles for her and she concentrated on motherhood by having a second son, Babe Howard, in 1997. Her six-year absence from films inspired a documentary by Rosanna Arquette titled Searching for Debra Winger (2002), which is about sexism and ageism in Hollywood. In 2001, she returned to acting in her husband's film, Big Bad Love (2001), which she also co-produced. It renewed her love for acting, and she has ventured out into television as well by earning her first Emmy nomination as Best Actress for Dawn Anna (2005), directed by her husband. In 2008, she wrote a well-written book, based on her personal recollections, titled \"Undiscovered\". And she followed that up by winning rave reviews as Anne Hathaway's mother in Jonathan Demme's Rachels Hochzeit (2008). However, it wasn't enough to reignite her feature film career, so she ventured towards television in 2010 with a guest-starring role on \"Law and Order\" titled Boy on Fire (2010), to a seven-episode stint on In Treatment: Der Therapeut (2008), to a two-part miniseries The Red Tent (2014), to a regular role on The Ranch (2016) . Her television exposure reignited her feature film career, and she was cast in her first romantic lead in 22 years in The Lovers (2017). And she had also mellowed with age, presenting an award to Richard Gere in 2011 and saying kind things about director Taylor Hackford in 2017, after having fought with both of them during Ein Offizier und Gentleman (1982). Nobody can deny that Debra Winger is one of the best American actresses ever. Her fans hope that Hollywood will finally reward her talent with a long-overdue Academy Award.\n\nNaomi Ellen Watts was born on September 28, 1968 in Shoreham, England to Myfanwy Edwards \"Miv\" (Roberts), an antiques dealer and costume/set designer, and Peter Watts (Peter Anthony Watts), Pink Floyd's road manager. Her maternal grandfather was Welsh. Her father died when she was seven and she followed her mother and brother around England until she was 14 and they finally settled in Australia, homeland of her maternal grandmother. When they arrived, she coaxed her mother to let her take acting classes. After bit parts in commercials, she landed her first role in Für die Liebe allein (1986). Naomi met her best friend Nicole Kidman when they both auditioned for a bikini commercial and shared a taxi ride home. In 1991, Naomi starred with Kidman in the sleeper hit Flirting - Spiel mit der Liebe (1991), directed by John Duigan. Naomi continued her career by starring in the Australian Brides of Christ (1991) co-starring Oscar-winners Russell Crowe and Brenda Fricker.\n\nIn 1993, she worked with John Duigan again in Sargasso Sea - Im Meer der Leidenschaft (1993) and director George Miller in Verführt - Schuldig oder nicht schuldig? (1993). Tank Girl (1995), in 1995, an adaptation of the comic book was a cult hit, starred Naomi as \"Jet Girl\", but it didn't do at the box-office or do much for her career. Watts continued to take insignificant parts in movies including the much forgotten film Kinder des Zorns IV (1996). It wasn't until David Lynch cast her in the critically acclaimed film Mulholland Drive (2001) that she began to become noticed. Her part as an aspiring actress showed her strong acting ability and wide range and earned her much respect, as much as to say by some that she was overlooked for a Oscar nomination that year. Stardom finally came to Naomi in the surprise hit Ring (2002), which grossed over $100,000,000 at the box-office and starred Watts as an investigative reporter hunting down the truth behind several mysterious deaths seemingly caused by a video tape. While the movie did not fare well with the critics, it launched her into the spotlight. In 2003, she starred in Alejandro González Iñárritu's 21 Gramm (2003) which earned her - what some say is a much overdue Oscar nomination and brought others to call her one of the best in her generation of actors. The same year, she was nominated for 21 Gramm (2003), Naomi was chosen to play \"Ann Darrow\" in director Peter Jackson's King Kong (2005) which took her to New Zealand for a five month shoot. Watts completed her first comedy in I Heart Huckabees (2004) for director David O. Russell, playing a superficial spokes model - a break from her usual intense and dramatic roles she is known for.\n\nIn 2005, she reprized her role as the protective-mother-reporter \"Rachel Keller\" in Ring 2 (2005). The movie, released in March, opened to $35,000,000 at the box office in the first weekend and established her as a box-office draw. Also in 2005, it was decided that her independent movie Ellie Parker (2001) would be re-released in late 2005 after its success at resurfacing at the Sundance Film Festival. The movie, which Naomi also produced, features her in the title role and is a bit biographical, but yet exaggerated take of the life of a struggling actress as she comes to Hollywood and encounters nightmares of the profession (it also features Watts' own beat-up Honda which she travels around in). In 2006, she starred with Edward Norton in Der bunte Schleier (2006). In July of 2007, Naomi gave birth to a boy, Alexander Pete (Sasha Schreiber) in Los Angeles with Liev Schreiber. Since then her career choices have gathered even more critical acclaim with starring roles roles in German director Michael Haneke's American remake of his thriller Funny Games U.S. (2007), David Cronenberg's Tödliche Versprechen - Eastern Promises (2007), and the action-thriller, The International (2009), released in February 2009. In mid-2008, Watts announced she was expecting her second child with Schreiber and gave birth to second son Samuel Kai Schreiber, in New York on December 13."
