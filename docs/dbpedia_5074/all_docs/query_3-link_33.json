        "text": "Don Johnson, a name synonymous with charm, talent and versatility, has carved a remarkable path in the realm of acting. Don was born on Dec. 15, 1949, in Flat Creek, Missouri, to his dad, who was only 19 years old and his mom, who was 16 at the time. Don had a rough childhood and left home at the age of 16. Determined to make something of himself, Don pursued acting.\n\nHis breakthrough came in the 1980s when he portrayed Detective Sonny Crockett in the iconic television series “Miami Vice.” The role catapulted him to stardom, and his suave persona, combined with the show's unique style, made him a household name. Don's impeccable portrayal of the charismatic detective solidified his position as a sought-after actor in Hollywood. But with great fame and money came wild days of drug-fuelled partying and unhindered spending, and Don reveled in it all.\n\nAs Don's career soared, his personal life became more and more turbulent. Don’s first two marriages were annulled within days. In 1972, he met actress Melanie Griffith, the daughter of movie icon Tippi Hedren. Griffith and Don moved in together when Griffith was only 15 years old. They married in 1976 but divorced by the end of the year. However, they reunited in 1989 and married again before divorcing again in 1996. They had one daughter, Dakota Johnson, who went on to become a successful actress herself. Prior to his reconciliation with Griffith, Johnson dated Patti D'Arbanville and had one son with her named Jesse Johnson.\n\nDon’s life took a major turn when he met the woman who would eventually become his fourth wife. Read on to find out more about their love story and how she tamed the former womanizing star.\n\nDon Johnson (1986), (Michael Putland/Hulton Archive via Getty Images)\n\nIn 1999, Don married Montessori schoolteacher Kelley Phleger. The couple met in San Francisco at a birthday party for the mayor. At the time, Johnson was still on the show “Nash Bridges,” which takes place in San Francisco. According to Closer Weekly, Don said of Phleger at the start: “This statuesque brunette was clearly a woman of substance. I made it my business to meet her.”\n\nJohnson and Phleger went on to have three children together. Their daughter, model Grace Johnson was born in 1999. Their son Jasper Johnson was born a few years later in 2002. Deacon Johnson, their youngest son, was born in 2006.\n\nDon has credited Phleger and their family for being the reason behind making a turnaround for the better in his life.\n\n“I had what everyone assumes are the elements that make you happy, and I was intensely unhappy,” he told the Independent of his heyday, during which he’d amassed a ranch, a boat, a plane and 20 cars.\n\nHe also told the Mirror that he “never drank or did drugs while I was working. But, brother, when they said ‘wrap’ I would try to set the land speed record. I knew how to party too.”\n\nHowever, upon marrying Phleger, Don’s rough-and-tumble life finally settled down.\n\n“I gave up my vices. I jettisoned that stuff. Quit smoking. I got rid of the 20 cars – I didn’t need them,” he said.\n\nHe added: “Superheroes are a metaphor for something unrealized in ourselves. We need to be something else to be satisfied and content, when we are actually enough, and plenty. As actors, we start out feeling that way and wanting to fill that void. Through training, spirituality and education you come to know that you are enough, and you don’t need anything extra.”\n\nKelly Phleger, Don Johnson (2014), (Kevin Mazur/WireImage via Getty Images)\n\nNow, after a lull following the wrap of “Nash Bridges,” the ’80s icon has found a career resurgence, taking on roles in hit productions like “Django Unchained,” “Knives Out,” “Watchmen” and “Book Club.” The star admitted to being happy to leave his hard-partying days behind and told the Mirror: “I’m happy to have ­survived it. A lot of people don’t.”\n\nBesides acting, Don has also been enjoying a far less hectic life with his wife, who he clearly loves dearly.\n\n“I had a rare moment of clarity and asked this woman to marry me, and I still think that she’s under a spell. And so I beg of you not to snap your fingers, because God knows what will happen if she ever comes to,” he gushed.\n\nDon is also a family man and told PEOPLE:\n\n“I love being with my kids and I have a lot of them, so I kind of just make the rounds. I'm a very simple guy, I like to walk, I like nature and all of that stuff, and I love hanging out with my beautiful wife.”\n\nAlso, an insider exclusively told Closer Weekly in November 2019: “He’s a doting, involved dad with the younger three. And nothing makes him happier than when his whole brood is together.” It is clear that his family is incredibly important to him.\n\nThe star is also focused on ensuring he is as good a role model as he can possibly be for his children. Don said in the same interview, “I do what I can to make sure young people understand that drugs can destroy their lives. I don’t have any vices… except my children.”\n\nKelley Phleger, Don Johnson, Grace Johnson, Jesse Johnson (2019), (Rodin Eckenroth/FilmMagic via Getty Images)"
