        "text": "Barbra Streisand and Don Johnson seemed like one of Hollywood's most unlikely couples when they first got together in the late 1980s. He had spent the decade as a television sensation as one half of the top-cop partnership on the primetime hit \"Miami Vice\" (via IMDb). She was a singer, actor, and director who spent much of the '80s making music and films, including an LP titled \"The Broadway Album\" and the classic 1983 flick \"Yentl\" (via Biography).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, 1987 brought them together when the pair met at a party in Aspen over the winter holidays. As 1988 began, Streisand and Johnson made their public debut at a boxing match where they were joined by a man who would one day become president of the United States, Donald J. Trump, according to Yahoo! News. While the pair did not last long, they did make headlines and magazine covers, including People, which pondered the possibility of the couple one day marrying. They did end up getting married down the line, but not to each other. Here's what you need to know about Streisand and Johnson's short-lived romance.\n\nWhen Barbra Streisand and Don Johnson met in 1987, they were both coming off failed relationships. Streisand had been dating Richard Baskin, a musician and heir to the ice cream empire Baskin-Robbins, and Johnson had just ended a relationship with actor Patti D'Arbanville (via Yahoo! News). However, something seemed to click when they couple met and, in 1988, Streisand described their relationship to Ladies Home Journal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"I'm happy, very happy. And I have never been very happy, so it is something I'm learning; it's as if I were a child again,\" she said, adding, \"There is nothing as satisfying as a good personal relationship. Certainly work isn't. I like sharing my life with a male counterpart and it is going very well.\"\n\nAt that time, it was going so well that the pair recorded a duet together called \"Till I Loved You,\" which went on to become a Top 40 hit in late 1988. However, by then, Streisand and Johnson had already called it quits (via Yahoo! News). Johnson remarried fellow actor Melanie Griffith the following year and soon welcomed daughter Dakota Johnson. As for Streisand, she went on to have a romance with tennis player Andre Agassi, but finally settled down with actor James Brolin in 1998 and the two have been happily married ever since.\n\nAdvertisement"
