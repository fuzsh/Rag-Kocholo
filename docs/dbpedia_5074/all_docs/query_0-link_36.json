        "text": "AUSTIN, Texas -- Actress Melanie Griffith Wednesday gave birth to a baby girl, Dakota, the daughter of actor Don Johnson.\n\nThe baby, the couple's first, was born at 2:49 p.m. A nursing supervisor at Brackenridge Hospital would release no information about the delivery, but the couple's publicist, Elliot Mintz, said mother and baby were doing fine.\n\nJohnson, 39, who is in Texas filming the movie 'Hot Spot,' was present at the time of delivery, Mintz said.\n\nThe baby was the second for both Griffith and Johnson, who were married in 1976, then divorced and remarried earlier this year.\n\nGriffith has a son by her former husband Steve Bauler, and Johnson has a son, Jesse, 6, by actress Patti D'Arbanville.\n\nGriffith was nominated for best actress this year for 'Working Girl' but lost to Jody Foster, who was nominated for her performance in 'The Accused.'"
