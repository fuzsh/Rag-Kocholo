I have turned it into a science.\"\n\nNever miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from juicy celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\nRELATED: Don Johnson Reveals How Daughter Dakota Johnson Reacted When She Was Financially Cut Off\n\nJohnson was previously married to ex-wife Melanie Griffith, who he wed in 1976, before the pair divorced and then remarried again in 1989. They divorced once again in 1996 and share daughter Dakota. (Johnson also has a child, son Jesse, with his former partner Patti D'Arbanville.)\n\nThe Miami Vice star is currently married to Kelley Phleger, who he tied the knot with in April 1999. The pair share three children together: daughter Atherton and sons Jasper and Deacon.\n\nContinuing his candid conversation, Johnson also joked about how past lovers would review him after Cohen playfully teased, \"All rave reviews on Yelp for Don Johnson.\"\n\n\"Well, I can't guarantee that, you know, circumstances being what they are. You never know what you have to work with,\" he explained. \"… I'm feeling pretty good about the review situation.\"\n\nThe father of five also noted that there have been instances in the past where women have slept with him based on his reputation as a lover.\n\n\"I've had that happen,\" he said, before adding that he has \"never felt any of that pressure because most of my customers leave satisfied.\""
