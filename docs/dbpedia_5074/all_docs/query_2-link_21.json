        "text": "Reading About Don Johnson; Thinking About Ronnie Gibbons\n\nEither tomorrow or Friday, look for a post on the sentencings of Sam Millar and/or Father Pat Moloney.\n\nBut for now, a detour of the sort you've grown accustomed to if you've been following these blogs: This one was prompted by a story I was reading in the USA Today section of the Democrat and Chronicle this morning, specifically a story about the career of Don Johnson.\n\nClick here for the Don Johnson story.\n\nAs I was reading along, I came across the mention of Don Johnson's child with actress Patti D'Arbanville. Those of you who have been reading this blog since the early days likely know where I'm going next: a reminder of D'Arbanville's role in the Ronnie Gibbons' disappearance.\n\nThe Toyota Tercel that Gibbons drove to Rochester when he disappeared was owned by D'Arbanville. Her husband at the time, Terry Quinn (bar owner, firefighter, firefighting consultant to FX show Rescue Me) was friends with Ronnie and loaned him the car.\n\nAs I relate in a blog I wrote in the very early days of this undertaking, when I never imagined that I would be nearing 250 installments, I contacted D'Arbanville about her car but did not , at her request, mention her name in the early reporting.\n\nQuinn was instrumental to the search for Gibbons. He is the one who first contacted our office about a year after Ronnie went missing, and told us the story. I sometimes wonder when and how (and even if) we would have found out about this had it not been for Terry.\n\nClick here for the 2011 blog I wrote about the car and D'Arbanville.\n\nAlso, some time later this year we'll hit the 250th installment of this blog. I've tried to do something out-of-the-ordinary with past benchmark installments so, if you have any ideas for that one, let me know."
