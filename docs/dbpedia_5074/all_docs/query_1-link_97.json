Some years were pretty good, but you know, like Georgia raft, I p***** it away on women, booze and horses.\n\n“It was a very tricky time. And you know, I was still growing up. There were a lot of things I was not aware of.”\n\nHowever, the ‘Watchman’ star did know that his looks, namely being “too pretty”, was something that he “vowed to overcome”.\n\nHe also reminisced about how he and his ex-wife Melanie Griffith - who he met when he was 22 and she was 14 while on set of ‘The Harrad Project’ in 1972 - would rear big cats with Melanie’s mother Tippi Hedren, the star of Alfred Hitchcock’s ‘The Birds’, and they “hand raised” roughly “20 or 30 lions and tigers\".\n\nDon said: “We hand raised those lions and tigers ... Probably between Melanie and I, we hand raised 20 or 30 lions and tigers.\n\n\"And when they get to be teenagers, which is around six months old, then we would take them out to the reserve. But yeah, we would would raise them, bottle feed them and then move them over to regular cat food.\n\n\"And I got pretty good at working with the wild cats.\"\n\nAlong with the lions and the tigers, Melanie and Don raised their daughter, actress Dakota Johnson, 32, after they were married for the second time in 1989.\n\nThey first married in 1976 in Las Vegas after getting engaged on Melanie's 18th birthday, but split six months later.\n\nThe actor has four other children; Jesse Johnson, 38, whose mother is model Patti D’Arbanville, and three kids with his current wife Kelley Phleger, 21-year-old daughter Grace and two sons Jasper, 19, and Deacon, 15."
