        "text": "Spring Arts Event: Rabbit Hole Production at Bunbury Theater\n\nDuring the Spring residency, students and faculty attend a plenary production of Rabbit Hole, a Pulitzer Prize-winning drama by David Lindsay-Abaire. The performance, at 7:30 p.m. Wednesday, May 28, is followed by a talkback by producing director Juergen Tossman and the actors.\n\nThe play examines the effect of an accidental death on a family. The New York Times review of the play said, [T]he sad, sweet release of Rabbit Hole lies precisely in the access it allows to the pain of others, in its meticulously mapped empathy. Citing the plays honesty, accuracy and humor, the review continues, [T]his anatomy of grief doesnt so much jerk tears as tap them, from a reservoir of feelings common to anyone who has experienced the landscape-shifting vacuum left by a death in the family.\n\nOther residency events wrap up at 4:15 p.m. that day, allowing students and faculty time to rest, write reports or evaluations, and have dinner on their own.\n\nBunbury Theatre, in the Henry Clay building at Third and Chestnut Streets, is located a block from the Brown Hotel. (top)\n\nSpring Arts Event: Sam Zalutskys You Belong to Me\n\nAll students have the opportunity to attend a second arts event, a screening of Sam Zalutskys feature film You Belong to Me, at 11:30 a.m. Monday, May 26. All students are invited to read the script, which is available on Blackboard at MFA in Writing Program/Semesters/Spring 2008/Spring Residency 2008. Screenwriting students are required to attend the screening and to read the script.\n\nReturning students may have seen versions of the film at differing stages of production; this springs screening offers the chance to see the movie, starring Patti DArbanville, in its final form. The film, which Zalutsky completed while a member of Spaldings MFA faculty, is now available on DVD via Netflix and Amazon.

MFA students and faculty are invited to attend and participate in these classes, which are scheduled throughout the Spring 2008 residency. The classes are\n\nToday Was Like Any Other Day; Then Something Happened . . . Writing the Inciting Incident, led by Ann Eskridge (all genres)\n\nWeaving Theme through Our Stories: Bang the Big Question Against Specific Details and, Voila!, Theme, led by Patty Houston (fiction, creative nonfiction, writing for children, playwriting, screenwriting)\n\nLearning Your Characters through Place, led by John Schuler (fiction, creative nonfiction, writing for children, playwriting, screenwriting)\n\nPersonification: What Happens When a Tree and a Tennis Shoe Go on a Date, led by Allison UrzuaBlaul (fiction, poetry, creative nonfiction, writing for children)\n\nMore information on time and locations, short pre-assignments, and further descriptions can be found at the end of the Spring 2008 Residency Lecture Descriptions document. (top)\n\nSpecial Required Sessions During Spring 2008 Residency\n\nAll New ENG610 Students\n\nIn addition to orientations during the MFA Residency, all new students attend required sessions with Kathleen Driskell. The first, Dialogue with Great Writers: How Critical Analysis Helps a Writer Improve Craft, introduces expectations for critical analysis and expository writing that students undertake while in the Spalding MFA Program. Before coming to the residency, new students are asked to read Raymond Carvers short story Cathedral and Regina Barrecas poem Nighttime Fires. Both texts and instructions on the pre-assignments can be found in Blackboard under Semesters/ Spring 2008/Spring 2008 Residency. The second required session is an MLA orientation which familiarizes students with guidelines from the Modern Language Association used in the MFA Program.\n\nENG620 Students\n\nAll ENG620 students participate in small expository writing workshops with the Expository Writing Coach Marica Dalton. A few weeks before the residency, the MFA Program posts workshop booklets containing students Book-in-Common essays, previously submitted. ENG620 students should download and print these out; they should then read and annotate the collected essays and bring the booklets to the residency in order to participate fully in small workshop discussions scheduled at various times during Spring 2008 Residency. (top)\n\nENG630 Students\n\nAll ENG630 students attend two events that focus on successfully developing and writing the Extended Critical Essay. The first session is an orientation that presents the ECE schedule and introductory materials to develop for the residency conference with the ENG630 mentor; the second session is a research panel featuring MFA faculty members Jody Lisberger, Maureen Morehead, and Nancy McCabe, who focus on organization, support, and revision when writing the ECE.\n\nGraduating Students\n\nAll graduating students must attend a practice graduation session. Though graduation celebration takes place in the Crystal Ballroom in The Brown Hotel at 5 p.m. Saturday, May 31, all graduating students practice in the Spalding University Gymnasium in the University Center Building (same location as the university cafeteria).\n\nTimes and locations for all sessions are announced in the Residency Schedule posted in Blackboard a few days before the residency. All students should consult this schedule in order to attend the required sessions.\n\nProfessional Readings for Playwriting/Screenwriting\n\nAs part of their ENG640 coursework, the following playwriting and screenwriting students have their scripts presented in professional readings during the Spring 2008 residency. Faculty-led discussions follow each of the readings by professional actors. Please refer to the residency schedule (posted on Blackboard a few days before the residency) for times and locations. All MFA students and faculty are welcome to attend these sessions. (top)\n\nPlaywriting Scripts\n\nLullabye of Death by Quintina Clemons\n\nSisters by Cynthia Williams\n\nThe Mute Swan by Lee Anne Fahey\n\nScreenwriting Scripts\n\nKicked in the Head by Frank Collazo\n\nMary and Joseph by Keith Nixon\n\nBlack Masque by Charlie Brady\n\nThe Infamous Rivers Brother and the Tree of Life by Danniel Kellermeyer\n\nECEs for Review\n\nStudents who would like to review Extended Critical Essays from previous semesters may do so in the MFA Office; however, all ECEs must remain in the MFA Office. ECE models for formating guidelines can be found in Blackboard under MFA in Writing Program/Semesters/Spring 2008/Courses/ENG630.\n\nReminder: Thesis Discussion\n\nDuring their fifth residency, graduating students meet with their mentor and two students for a 40-minute discussion of the Creative Thesis. The Thesis Discussion is a pleasant conversation about what the student has accomplished by producing a completed thesis of original writing.\n\nAt the beginning of the Thesis Discussion, the author speaks briefly about the literary influences on the writing in the thesis and about the processes of writing and revising the work. The author also speaks about a feature of the thesis that is a particular source of pride or sense of accomplishment. The author should prepare a few questions to ask the readers. Student readers prepare for the Thesis Discussion by carefully reading the thesis and taking a few notes for comments/questions to make during the discussion. The mentor facilitates and participates in the discussion. This is not a workshop session. The author does not make substantive changes to the thesis after the Thesis Discussion. (top)\n\nNew Policies for Cross-Genre Workshops\n\nIn response to student and faculty requests, several semesters ago the MFA Program began offering cross-genre workshops during residency. Many students and faculty have participated in these workshops and have found them very instructive. As the MFA Program moves to integrate the cross-genre workshop into our regular schedule, and in order to best serve our students and faculty, the MFA directors have created the following policies for those wanting to participate in cross-genre workshops during residency:\n\n(1) A student must have filled the prerequisite of ENG610 before being allowed to sit in the cross-genre workshop\n\n(2) No MFA student can take more than one cross-genre workshop within the required four semesters and five residencies.\n\n(3) Faculty who want to lead a cross-genre workshop must communicate this request directly to Karen Mann.\n\n(4) Faculty assignments are made on a first-come, first-served basis, but no faculty member can lead a cross-genre workshop more often than once every four semesters.\n\nmy.spalding.edu New Portal for Current Students\n\nAs of April 28, Spalding student email switched to Microsoft Outlook, and email addresses are now username@spalding.edu instead of username@student.spalding.edu.
