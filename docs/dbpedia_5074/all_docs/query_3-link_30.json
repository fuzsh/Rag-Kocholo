        "text": "One of Hollywood's biggest stars Don Johnson is also a family guy. He has extended his brood with his 5 beautiful children who are doing pretty well in their lives.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThroughout his decades-long career, Don Johnson wowed the audience with his unforgettable roles on the big screen.\n\nBut while he wasn't acting, he was busy being a doting father to his children and things haven't changed even today.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDON'S TUMULTUOUS PAST\n\nDon has enjoyed a successful career, but the same cannot be said about his relationships. The father-of-five has been married multiple times during his life.\n\nHis personal life was pretty turbulent throughout the 80s. He became a married man for the first time when he tied the knot with Melanie Griffith in 1976. Sadly, their marriage was not meant to last and the couple called it quits the same year.\n\nMelanie Griffith and Don Johnson attend the New York premiere of \"How To Be Single.\" | Source: Getty Images\n\nSix years after his split with Melanie, Don welcomed his first child, Jesse, with actress Patti D’Arbanville. In 1989, he and Melanie decided to give marriage another go. They welcomed their daughter, Dakota, in 1989.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt wasn't until he met his wife, Kelley Phleger, that he found romantic stability in life. The lovebirds met during a birthday party for Willie Brown. “This statuesque brunette was clearly a woman of substance,” Don said of Kelly.\n\nDon Johnson and his wife Kelley Phleger arrive at the premiere of RLJE Films' \"Brawl In Cell Block 99.\" | Source: Getty Images\n\nThe couple went on to get married and have three kids together. Their children, Grace, Jasper, and Deacon, are all beautiful and share a loving relationship with their parents.\n\nJESSE JOHNSON\n\nDon's eldest child, Jesse, followed in his father's footsteps to become an actor. He has appeared in many TV shows and movies including \"Killing Lincoln\" and \"Redline.\"\n\non Johnson and Jesse Johnson attend the world premiere of \"The Hateful Eight.\" | Source: Getty Images\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen he gets some time off his busy schedule, Jesse loves being outdoors. Besides that, he enjoys snowboarding, playing ice hockey, and weight training.\n\nDAKOTA JOHNSON\n\nLike her brother Jesse, Dakota has made a career in Hollywood with her impressive acting skills. She is best known for playing the role of Anastasia Steele in the \"Fifty Shades of Grey\" franchise.\n\nDakota Johnson arrives for the Vanity Fair Oscar Party in 2017. | Source: Getty Images\n\nShe has tons of movie and TV show credits including \"Crazy in Alabama,\" \"How to Be Single,\" \"Bad Times,\" \"El Royale\" and \"Suspiria.\"\n\nGRACE JOHNSON\n\nGrace might not have been bitten by the acting bug like her half-siblings, but she has a keen interest in fashion and photography.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJudging by her Instagram profile, Grace has taken up modeling. She shares tons of amazing pictures of herself on the social media platform.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJASPER JOHNSON\n\nNot much is known about Don's son Jasper, but it is pretty evident that the young man prefers to stay out of the limelight. He has yet to pursue a career.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJasper's social media pages give away that he has a deep love for sports. His dad has even shared pictures of himself attending sporting events on Instagram.\n\nDEACON JOHNSON\n\nIn 2006, Don welcomed his youngest child, Deacon. Not much is known about him but fans are delighted when he makes an appearance on his dad's Instagram every now and then.\n\nFans are yet to see what Deacon will become when he grows older. For now, they can only enjoy seeing some of the special moments of his life in social media uploads."
