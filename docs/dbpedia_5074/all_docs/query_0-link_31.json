        "text": "”I was disappointed for Philip,” he says, rubbing up against the subject with some reluctance. ”Because Philip’s got a beautiful, beautiful voice. But I think he would agree that he just tried to undertake too much, you know? Producing, writing everything. I know this sounds funny from a guy who is doing a television series, developing film projects, doin’ a record and all this shit — but I know my limitations.”\n\nFrom the outset, he candidly assessed his musical assets as sparse — some at-home guitar slanging; desultory bouts of song scribbling. But he had been singing since his farm-boy days back in Missouri, when he’d soloed on Baptist choir anthems every Sunday. (”People’d pinch me on the cheek, give me a quarter, tell me how wonderful I was — that’s where it all went bad!”) And his light baritone, while limited — whose isn’t in some way? — had a certain sinew to it, a discernible character. He really saw himself as a rocker, too, not just another hunk-puss imposter from the vast video wasteland, and he was determined not to make a hunk-puss record. As a kid, he’d frequently infuriated his father by dialing in black R&B stations out of Kansas City on the family radio. He was an original Beach Boys fanatic and later flipped for the Beatles and the Stones. Nothing radical, but Johnson felt that he, too, as much as anybody else, had lived the rock & roll life. There was a time, he remembered, when it was the life that everybody lived.\n\nEditor’s picks\n\nThat time was the Sixties, of course. Following a mildly delinquent youth in the James Dean mode, Johnson had followed an acting muse to San Francisco in 1968, where he landed his first professional stage job — in an obscure rock musical — and on off nights immersed himself in flower power amid the hippie hordes at the Fillmore and Avalon ballrooms. By 1969, he’d relocated to L.A., hired by actor turned director Sal Mineo to appear in a homosexually explicit version of the prison play Fortune and Men’s Eyes. Acting always remained primary — ”I was less into music than perfecting my craft, so I could make a living at it, you know?” — but before long Johnson was hitting the clubs and catching every hip act from Tim Hardin to the Mothers of Invention. At parties, he’d hang with members of the Mamas and the Papas, or perhaps the Doors, knocking back drinks, smoking dope, maybe snorting a little blow. L.A. was wild then. ”Stayin’ loaded and fucked up all night long, hanging out in the coffee shops, talking political trash with every idiot I could find — that was pretty much what I was into,” Don says.\n\nHe also met — and soon moved in with — a noted scenestress of the period named Miss Pamela, a member of the GTO’s (”Girls Together Outrageously”), a group signed to Mothers leader Frank Zappa’s record label. From time to time, Miss Pamela also looked after Zappa’s kids, Moon Unit and Dweezil, and so Frank and Don quickly became acquainted.\n\n”I remember Dweezil being diapered in my presence,” Johnson says, chuckling. ”Frank and I used to talk about doing movies together, crazy videos; and I sang some stuff for him, and we talked about recording, but it just never sort of worked out. He’d be doing a record, or I’d be off in some other universe. But I used to enjoy just bullshitting with him. Frank’s a genius.”\n\nRelated\n\nDon’s first movie, The Magic Garden of Stanley Sweetheart, turned out to be a teen-junk abomination, but it took him to New York in the summer of 1969, and there he fell in amid the decadent denizens of Andy Warhol’s Factory — Holly Woodlawn, Baby Jane Holzer, various members of the disintegrating Velvet Underground. The Factory was also where he first laid eyes on Patti D’Arbanville, the actress who, thirteen years later, would become the mother of Don’s son, Jesse, now three. Patti was just seventeen when they met and at the time was posing nude for a Warhol photo layout. It was the era of antic youth and anything goes.\n\n”We were all fairly fucked up,” Don says, ”and the reefer took its toll on my memory. But I do remember we all knew something was happening. We had come together from all over the U.S. — me from Missouri, Holly from Florida, Lou Reed from Long Island, Andy from Michigan or Minnesota or some-fuckin’-where. And the one thing we all had in common was that we hated boredom — I think that’s why we gravitated to each other. We were all young, and completely fuckin’ crazy — completely on the edge and pushin’ the outside of the envelope. It was just a constant ballet of debauchery.”\n\nCocaine was definitely the hip drug by then, and Johnson dutifully dabbled. He remembers stuffing some up his nose one night in the men’s room of a midtown disco called Hippopotamus. ”I walked out of the bathroom with cocaine all over my upper lip, and I walked dead into this black guy. I looked up, and it was Jimi Hendrix. My jaw hit my chest. He smiles and goes, ‘Man, you can’t be walkin’ around with shit on your face like this’ — and he’s like wiping the blow off my upper lip, you know? He was so charming. I might have given him some blow, I don’t know what the fuck I did. I was thunderstruck.”\n\nJohnson’s next film, Zachariah, released in 1971, considerably expanded his rock connections. Conceived by the Firesign Theatre, the conceptual-comedy troupe, it was an ”electric western” that featured Country Joe and the Fish, Doug Kershaw and Joe Walsh’s James Gang, among other acts. Don remembers its filming as being appropriately uproarious.\n\n”We were all down in Mexico together, makin’ this picture, and of course we were all fucked up and havin’ a wonderful time. We made music constantly. And it occurred to me at the time that although I had spent the last few years concentrating on my acting, I really missed music. So back in L.A., I went down on Hollywood Boulevard, and I bought this twenty-dollar Crown guitar and started teachin’ myself how to play. It didn’t take long to realize that I was not going to play like Eric Clapton. But I found it therapeutic for between acting jobs — they weren’t exactly beatin’ my door down at the time — so I kept at it. I was never gonna be a virtuoso, but I could play.”"
