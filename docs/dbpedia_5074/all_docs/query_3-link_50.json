        "text": "Kelley Phleger is a name that most people don’t easily recognize right away. This is because she is best known for being the beautiful wife of American heavyweight Don Johnson rather than her personal life and profession. Despite this, Don often credited his wife with helping him grow in all aspects of his life.\n\nUnlike her husband, Phleger did not sell her art in the entertainment industry rather she was a socialite as well as a renowned schoolteacher. Besides that, he is a person with a passion for charity and has been involved in many humanitarian activities. Find out all the facts about Don Johnson’s wife here.\n\nKelley Phleger – Biography,\n\nThe school teacher was born on American soil, precisely in San Francisco, California, United States. His date of birth is June 22, 1969, but the names of his parents have yet to be released publicly.\n\nNot only that, not much is known about Kelley yet, especially when it comes to his family background, siblings, childhood, and early life. However, some documents indicate that she completed her basic studies in the United States.\n\nIt is believed that she received her primary school education at a school in the city of San Francisco. As for her high school, she attended Urban High School in San Francisco and later joined the University of California to further her education. Currently, information about the year she was admitted to the institution, the particular course she studied and the year she graduated with her girlfriends are also missing from the photo.\n\nHis family\n\nKelley Phleger is not only a teacher of other people’s children, but also an amazing and super mother to her own children, which she had with her celebrity husband. The two men officially tied the knot in 1999, after finding themselves ready to wed.\n\nPrior to their marriage, Don had married women in the past. Information about his first two marriages is still missing from the card, except that both marriages were annulled in 1968 and 1973 respectively. His third marriage was to American producer Melanie Griffith, a stage, film and television actress. The two men first linked in 1976, but divorced the same year. They married again in 1989 and finally ended their marital relationship in 1996.\n\nThree years after her last divorce, Johnson and Kelley officially sealed their love in the presence of family and friends. Their union has produced three wonderful children to date: Deacon Johnson (born April 29, 2006), Jasper Breckinridge Johnson (born June 6, 2002), and Atherton Grace Johnson (born December 28, 1999).\n\nIn addition to these three, Kelley Phleger is also a mother figure to her husband’s other children – actor Jesse Wayne Johnson (born December 7, 1982) and actress/model Dakota Johnson (born October 4, 1989). While the actress came from the Johnson affair with his third wife, Griffith, he had Wayne and former model American actress Patti D’Arbanville, with whom he spent four years (1981 – 1985).\n\nGrace, who is ten years younger than Dakota, is a role model. She is said to have already walked on the catwalks for a clothing brand and hopes to become one of the most influential models of her time. His brother Jasper is a basketball player who represented Santa Barbara on Channel League Action while Deacon is an avid animal lover.\n\nSpeaking of their father, he holds the record as one of the moguls in the entertainment industry. Originally from Flat Creek, Missouri, USA, his full name is Donald Wayne Johnson and his date of birth is December 15, 1949. Don, as he is known professionally, is a songwriter, director, actor, singer and producer. He started selling his art in the industry in 1969 and since then he has never slowed down.\n\nPhleger’s husband rose to fame in the film world after starring in the 1980s series Miami Vice, in which he portrayed the role of James Sonny Crockett. In addition to the Golden Globe Award, the Wichita South High School graduate also has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\n\nOther Facts About Don Johnson’s Wife\n\n1.
