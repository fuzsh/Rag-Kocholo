        "text": "Here’s what we know about her oldest sibling Jesse:\n\nWho are Jesse Johnson’s parents?\n\nJesse Wayne Johnson, 41, was born to American actors Don Johnson and Patti D’Arbanville on December 7, 1982, in Los Angeles, per People. His father Don, 74, is famous for starring in films and TV shows including Miami Vice, Knives Out and Quentin Tarantino’s Django Unchained, while his mother Patti D’Arbanville, 72, was famous for being one of artist and filmmaker Andy Warhol’s muses. Johnson and D’Arbanville never married, and Jesse is Don’s firstborn child.\n\nPer People, Don struggled with drug and alcohol addiction in the 1970s, but it was the arrival of Jesse that made him change his ways.\n\n“I walked into the breakfast room one morning and the sun was shining and the birds were singing, and Patti was feeding the baby,” Don told People in 1984. “I came staggering in and sat down and looked at them, and she looked at me and I knew that if I didn’t do something she was going to leave. So I said, ‘Patti, I’m a drunk and a drug addict, and I’m going to do something about it’.”\n\nJesse Johnson is an actor and musician\n\nJesse has followed closely in his parents’ footsteps, becoming the first of his father’s children to join the entertainment industry, writes People. The Colorado native has starred in a string of productions including Hawaii Five-O, Twin Peaks, NCIS: Naval Criminal Investigative Service, Grey’s Anatomy and Law & Order: Los Angeles, to name a few, as seen on his IMDB page.\n\nAccording to People, he is also a musician who’s in a band called Blame Baby.\n\nHe likes to travel\n\nJesse has proven his love of travel via his Instagram in recent years. There, he’s shared photos of himself in cities including Stockholm, Tel Aviv, Hokkaido, Paris, Tokyo, London, and many more.\n\nHe’s very sporty\n\nIt’s clear that Jesse has a passion for the great outdoors too. In a 2009 interview with Top Cat Films, he said he got into sports like snowboarding and ice hockey thanks to his childhood spent in Aspen, Colorado. On one Instagram post featuring a shot taken atop a ski slope in February, he wrote, “Happiest place on earth”.\n\nAre Dakota and Jesse Johnson close?\n\nIt definitely seems Dakota and Jesse Johnson are tight – and very supportive of one another’s careers too. Per People, Dakota was at the premiere of his movie Redline in 2007. Nearly a decade later, he showed up for a red carpet appearance at the premier of her film How to Be Single. Jesse has also shared various photos with his sis on his public Instagram profile."
