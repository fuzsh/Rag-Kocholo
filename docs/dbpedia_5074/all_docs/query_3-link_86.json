        "text": "Frank Tashlin made the Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies cartoons and you know, that’s pretty much what this movie is. It’s a cartoon come beautiful and wonderfully to life. He’d work with Jerry Lewis on six of his solo films (Rock-A-Bye Baby, The Geisha Boy, Cinderfella, It’s Only Money, Who’s Minding the Store? and The Disorderly Orderly) and then work with Jayne Mansfield again on the movie Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter? He also wrote the Don Knotts film The Shakiest Gun in the West.\n\nI knew I would love this movie in the first few seconds, when Tom Ewell introduces the film by showing how CinemaScope and the colors by DeLuxe work. It’s an astounding moment that breaks the fourth wall before it has even been built.\n\nA mobster who runs the slots, Marty “Fats” Murdock (Edmond O’Brien), has one dream. He wants his girl, Jerri Jordan (Mansfield), to be a singer. She has no talent, but he knows that press agent Tom Miller (Ewell, who is best known for The Seven Year Itch and whose last movie was Rodney Dangerfield’s Easy Money) can get the job done. Even better, he never hits on his clients.\n\nMurdock is obsessed with a song he wrote, “Rock Around the Rock Pile,” and Miller has to go to enemy territory and sell the song to another mobster, Wheeler (John Emery, Kronos), who rules the jukeboxes.\n\nThere’s all manner of romantic confusion and a gang war over jukeboxes, which was actually a thing once. All ends well, with Jerri confessing that she really can sing and Murdock letting her know that he doesn’t want to marry her, so she can go off and be with Tom, the man she loves. The wedding dress that Mansfield wears here was loaned to her for her wedding to Mickey Hargitay.\n\nOh yeah — and Juanita Moore, from Imitation of Life, is in this. That’s what normal folks know her from. Me, I recognized her as Momma from Abby right away.\n\nThe real reason to watch this — beyond the rainbow of colors ready to bathe your eyes in perfect beauty and majesty — are the performances by Fats Domino, Little Richard, Eddie Cochran, The Platters, Gene Vincent, Eddie Fontaine and more.\n\nIn The Beatles Anthology, Paul McCartney discusses how John Lennon learned how to play guitar from watching Cochran in this movie. It meant so much to them that they cut the recording of “Birthday” at Abbey Road Studios short to watch its 1968 British TV debut. Jimmy Page and Jeff Beck also claimed that this movie was a big influence.\n\nSpeaking of influence, some feel that Elvis was directly inspired by the dancing for “Rock Around the Rockpile,” which was somewhat of an imitation of him anyway, and may have used the look of this scene when he made Jailhouse Rock. The makers of The Girl Can’t Help It wanted Elvis for this film, but dealing with Colonel Tom Parker proved to be too much to deal with, as his asking price for one Elvis song was too expensive.\n\nWant to love this movie even more? Listen to John Waters discuss it on the British DVD release. He would also tell the Directors Guild of America Quarterly, “This wasn’t a movie that my boy classmates wanted to see or cared about. They weren’t interested in discussing Jayne Mansfield’s complete lack of roots. I really had no one that I could be enthusiastic with about it. So it was a private secret of mine, this movie.”\n\nWaters based so much of the character of Divine — she would even come on stage to the song “The Girl Can’t Help It” — from Mansfield. He also points out that Little Richard’s mustache in this movie had such an impact on him that he’s had it for his entire life.\n\nThis film is pure greatness on a level that very few movies ever hope to reach. You can watch it on YouTube.\n\nDirected and written by Gene McPherson, The Last Prom is a remake of the 1962 film and it updates it in a way that it kept shocking students for decades. I mean, I know that I saw it in 1988 in my high school.\n\nSandy Clark (Sheelagh Bevan) may have broken up with her boyfriend, but her friend Judy Grant (Mary LeClair) and her boyfriend Jim Miller (Ron Bohmer) fix her up with Bill Donovan (Jamie Bozian). Soon, they’re at the big event and the boys are getting trashed on vodka while no one is watching and they’re all joy riding and you see where this is going. Nearly everyone is about to die, as this is a slasher movie as much as anything that came out in the golden era of the genre.\n\nEven though Bill caused the crash and killed everyone, he still goes to Sandy’s funeral. I have no idea why this happens.\n\nThis film also led to the mock accident that schools put on outside in the parking lot every year. When they did mine, the effects looked so bad and I had begged to be allowed to do them and was refused, as I was told that the levels of gore that I had planned would upset people. Isn’t that the point? Wouldn’t people at prom maybe behave a little better if they had seen a cheerleader’s intestines all over the Lincoln High School teacher’s lot?\n\nI kind of love the ghost images and foreshadowing with the scenes of the bloody van and Sandy’s face heading toward a windshield. It’s shot like a documentary otherwise but man, it sure comes off as the most doom student scare movie I have ever sat through numerous times. If only everything they forced us to do in school was this good.\n\nYou can watch this on YouTube.\n\nMan, the Woolner Brothers put out some wild movies.\n\nDirected by Hugo Grimaldi — and writer Arthur C. Pierce — this has the Intergalactic Council send Dr. Kolos (Richard Kiel) on a mission for their galaxy domination program to replace humans with androids just like him. If his mission happens, the world will be taken over. If not, he dies.\n\nHe quickly enslaves Prof. Vaughan Dornheimer (George Macready) and starts making the androids and takes over the top scientists of the world — like Dr. Munson (Walter Abel) — and uses them to steal the things they need to keep making more copies of humans.\n\nThe professor’s daughter Lisa (Dolores Faith) and Glenn Martin (George Nader) are on the case, but soon, Glenn is duplicated. His girlfriend Gale Wilson (Barbara Nichols) figures it out and the cops open fire on the fake Glenn, who rips his arm off to escape. As for the real Glenn, he’s found the professor just as the android professor takes over, ties up Dr. Kolos and uses several copies of the evil Thor (John Indrisano) to steal Lisa and start making a duplicate of her.\n\nShe’s saved at the last minute by Dr. Kolos, who has a change of heart, knowing that he is an android and will soon die. However, he was able to see the human race and the beauty of mankind.\n\nFilmed at the same time as the movie it played double features with — Mutiny In Space — this was re-released on VHS as Jaws of the Alien after Kiel became a star for playing the James Bond henchman.\n\nAmongst consumers of the seamier world of exploitation film — alright, let’s be fair and call ourselves scumbags — Emilio Vieyra is best-known for his 1969 film The Curious Dr. Humpp, an astounding retitling of his film La Vengenza del Sexo (The Revenge of Sex). Blame Jerald Intrator, director of Striporama and dubbing supervisor for Night of the Bloody Apes) for that, as he also bought Vierya’s Placer Sangriento (Bloody Pleasure) and released it with the equally awesome title The Deadly Organ. Oh yeah — he was also smart enough to insert twenty minutes of nudity into La Vengenza del Sexo, a movie already rife with naked bodies.\n\nThis is Vierya’s vampire film. Actually, he also made La Bestia Desnuda (The Naked Beast) too.\n\nOfelia’s (Susana Beltrán, who appears in several of the director’s films, including saying “Use my body to keep you alive!” to Dr. Humpp and another I need to see called Stay Tuned for Terror) is about to be married to Eduardo but is truly in love with Gustavo. On her wedding night, her true love breaks into the honeymoon suite, kills her husband and turns her into a vampire just like him.\n\nWe fast-forward to the 60’s where Ofelia’s curse continues as she seduces and drains numerous teens one by one after their van breaks down. While she’s using up men, Gustavo is planning on doing the same with all the ladies.\n\nThe Argentinian government cracked down hard on this mix of gore and sex, keeping it hidden away for four years before allowing it to be released in all its bloody go-go dancing glory.\n\nMondo Macabro released this back in 2004, so here’s hoping that someday soon it gets another reissue. It’s so worthy of your time, a movie with seagulls instead of bats.\n\nAlso known as Hidden Face, this Ed Wood movie is about Don Gregor (Clancy Malone, director Ed Wood’s grocery delivery person), the rich son of plastic surgeon Dr. Boris Gregor (Herbert Rawlinson). Instead of following his father into medicine, he’s a henchman of gangster Vic Brady (Timothy Farrell) and constantly getting into trouble with the law. A job gone wrong ends with them killing an old woman and Don telling his father that he wants to turn himself in to the police. Vic doesn’t allow that to happen, killing him and forcing Dr. Gregor to perform plastic surgery so that he can stay ahead of the police.\n\nI’ve made this sound like a normal movie but no, it’s always night no matter what and the soundtrack from Mesa of Lost Women plays constantly over everything, never stopping. You may think that Rawlinson’s part should be played by Bela Lugosi. In a similar tragedy to that actor, Rawlinson died the day after filming was done. You may notice he isn’t breathing well. He had terminal lung cancer.\n\nThe nightclub scene is unique in every print. Wood had intended it to be a striptease scene, but the producers replaced it with a performance by minstrel act Cotton Watts, one of the last performers in the genre. This is taken from another movie, Yes Sir, Mr. Bones.\n\nThis is also the first movie for Steve Reeves and other than Athena, the only film in which his real voice is heard.\n\nYou can watch this on YouTube.\n\nProducer Herman Cohen was inspired by reading a series of newspaper articles about Scotland Yard’s Black Museum. He got to visit the museum and wrote this with Aben Kandel. Many of the weapons in this — including the binoculars — were based on actual weapons of murder.\n\nCohen wanted Vincent Price or Orson Welles, but Anglo-Amalgamated pushed for a British actor, so Michael Gough is the main bad guy, Edmond Bancroft. Working with his assistant Rick (Graham Curnow), he’s creating a black museum of his own filled with things that have killed people. He also writes about them in the paper and in books. He’s so known for this that a shop owner (Beatrice Varley) keeps weapons that she gets just for him.\n\nThere’s also a serial killer who is murdering people with other strange weapons and every time it happens, Bancroft goes mad and his blood pressure goes to 200/100, which let me tell you as someone who is oCD about testing and retesting my blood pressure would kill you.\n\nBancroft fights with his lover Joan (June Cunningham), who laughs at him and calls him a cripple. She goes out by herself, gets soused and hits on every man she sees before coming home to have a strange looking man place a guillotine on her bed and chop her head off.\n\nAs all that is happening, Rick falls for Angela (Shirley Anne Field) and starts planning to get married. However, he is tied to the crime writer by a dark secret.\n\nMaking this even better is the opening, which has hypnotist Emile Franchele and HypnoVista. This was added in the U.S. by American-International Pictures. I don’t know if I could be more excited to watch a movie after the opening.\n\nDirected by Arthur Crabtree, this is a movie that was called “lurid,” “nasty” and “sensationalism without subtlety of characterization, situation or dialog.” Those people were right, right and very wrong.\n\nThe VCI blu ray of Horrors of the Black Museum has archival commentary by Cohen, a 2023 commentary by Robert Kelly — who also created the new artwork for the cover, a tribute to Cohen and the original U.S. HypnoVista opening featuring psychologist, Emile Franchel. You can get this from MVD.\n\nEDITOR’S NOTE: Did you know that Visual Vengeance has a ton of movies on Tubi? It’s true. Check out this Letterboxd list and look for reviews as new movies get added. You can find this movie on Tubi.\n\nNewspaper photographer Jeff Rhodes (Thom Meyers) has found that the people of a small Texas town are all drained of all of their blood. He’s on a deadline — Uncle Joe (Robert Bradeen) and Aunt Kate (Billie Keller) demand that he quit his job and come back to the family farm — while his brother Ralph (played by director and writer Roger Coburn) is a successful scientist at Research City. He also knows that alien life forms have come to Earth to bring dead bodies back to life and seek blood. If Jeff can stop the bedroom rodeo with Julie (Laura Ellis) he just might save the world if General Sanders (Dennis Letts) doesn’t nuke everyone first.\n\nBloodsuckers from Outer Space is aware that it’s a bad movie and leans into it, yet in the scenes where the aliens describe being dead and how Jeff will soon join them, the dialogue is actually pretty incredible. If only it went that way and became a Texas-based Messiah of Evil.\n\nAfter running for President every year between 1968 and 1996, Pat Paulsen gets to be the leader of the United States in this movie and like almost everyone else, he’s busier having sex than doing something.\n\nThis had its first showing at Joe Bob Briggs’ 3rd Annual World Drive-In Movie Festival and Custom Car Rally in 1984 — Paulsen was chaffed by how bad it looked — and even came out on VHS by a major company, Karl-Lorimar Home Video.\n\nCoburn was also one of the directors of Tabloid.\n\nEDITOR’S NOTE: Did you know that Visual Vengeance has a ton of movies on Tubi? It’s true. Check out this Letterboxd list and look for reviews as new movies get added. You can find this movie on Tubi.\n\nAfter Hurricane Xiora, the empowered Florida militia shoots a looter who has run into the swamps after he kills two of their men. Sergeant Barnes (Todd Terry) shoots him and learns that he was stealing diapers and baby food, just in time for the man’s voodoo grandmother (Yvone Williamson) to snap his neck.\n\nLieutenant Hutchinson (J. Todd Smith) and his unit are sent to find Barnes. He’s conflicted, as he joined to honor the memory of his father, who died in Desert Storm. He’s also not so sure that as a black man he should be ordering white men to shoot black people no matter what they’re doing.\n\nJoined by weather reporter Lisa Hicks (Karin Justman) — yes, that happens in this movie — the unit finds two survivors who just so happens to be voodoo slaves to the grandmother.\n\nDirected and written by Bob Cook (Rock-A-Die Baby, Animals), this has people wandering a swamp for most of the movie and delivers its one zombie quite late in the film. My favorite character was Corporal Dani Stevens (Debra Cassano), who ends up tongue kissing one of the privates by force in the bar and laughing at him. She got kicked out of the Marines for attacking her commander and is only in the militia to make her dad happy. Cassano is really good in the part and stands out.\n\nThis has an interesting anti-military, pro-looting message that you may not expect and some nice scenery. If you aren’t into movies where people wander aimlessly — I am kind of comforted by it — you will probably not enjoy yourself."
