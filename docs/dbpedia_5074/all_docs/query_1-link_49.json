Melanie Griffith and Don Johnson were one of the 80s’ most iconic couples, with their tumultuous relationship playing out in the public eye. But as with many fairy tales, not everything was as perfect as it seemed.\n\nThe couple first met on the set of “The Harrad Experiment” in 1972, when Griffith was just 14 and Johnson was 22. Despite the age difference, the two quickly fell for each other, much to the consternation of Griffith’s famous mother, Tippi Hedren. But the young couple was undeterred, and they moved in together when Griffith was 15. They even got engaged on her 18th birthday, before tying the knot in 1976.\n\nHowever, their first marriage only lasted six months, with the couple citing immaturity and infidelity as the reasons for their split. Griffith went on to marry twice more, and Johnson had a son with actress Patti D’Arbanville. But their connection was too strong to ignore, and the couple found their way back to each other in 1989, marrying for the second time in an intimate ceremony at their ranch in Aspen.\n\nTheir second marriage seemed to be the real deal, with Johnson calling it “God’s plan” when Griffith became pregnant with their daughter, Dakota. But the couple’s relationship was far from smooth sailing. Both battled alcohol addiction at different points, and they separated multiple times over the years.\n\nDespite the ups and downs, Griffith and Johnson remained close, with Griffith once saying, “All of my husbands, my three husbands — I love them all so much, and we’re all very close.” And while they never officially divorced after their second marriage, they ultimately decided to go their separate ways.\n\nToday, Griffith is focused on her acting career, most recently appearing in “The Disaster Artist” and the Showtime series “SMILF.” Johnson, on the other hand, married teacher Kelly Phleger in 1999 and the couple has three children together.\n\nBut even though their marriage may have ended, the love and connection between Griffith and Johnson remains. As Johnson once said, “It’s pretty simple: when you love your children and want to share your life with them, it’s foolish to denigrate or have any animosity with their mother. Children model you more than they listen to you.”\n\nSources\n\nhttps://www.yahoo.com/video/why-melanie-griffith-don-johnson-150000259.html\n\nhttps://people.com/archive/cover-story-a-baby-for-don-and-melanie-vol-31-no-"
