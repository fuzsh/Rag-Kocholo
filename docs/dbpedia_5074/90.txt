Don Johnson and his wife, Kelley, are expecting their third child.

The baby is due around May, Johnson's publicist, Elliot Mintz, said Friday.

"Both, needless to say, are thrilled," Mintz said.

The couple has a 5-year-old daughter, Grace, and a 3-year-old son, Jasper. They were married in 1999.

Johnson starred in the TV shows "Miami Vice" and "Nash Bridges" and the movie "Tin Cup" (1996).

The 56-year-old actor has two other children â€” a son with actress Patti D'Arbanville-Quinn and a daughter with Melanie Griffith.
