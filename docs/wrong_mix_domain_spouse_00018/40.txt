The Ex-husband of Britney Spears, Kevin Federline, reportedly plans to move her two sons to Hawaii. Reports say Federline had his lawyer send Spears a letter, asking if she would be okay with her sons' relocation. It is also reported that Federline's lawyer expects to hear back from the pop star's representation within the week. It's said that if Spears disagrees with the decision to move the children, the case will be taken to court. Federline would then have to ask a judge to grant permission. Sources say they don't believe the case will get to that point.

A source also told TMZ that the reason for the family's move is a job offer that Federline's wife, Victoria Prince, received in the area. Sources add that their decision to move is influenced by Federline's ability to DJ in Hawaii, while the children live a more quiet life. It was added that Spears' and Federline's son, Jayden, would complete schoolwork online while their other son will have graduated.
