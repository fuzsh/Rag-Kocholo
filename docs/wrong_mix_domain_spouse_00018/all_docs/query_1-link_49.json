        "text": "Britney Spears’ anticipated tell-all memoir The Woman in Me is set to come out on October 24, charting the iconic pop star’s incredible journey to global stardom.\n\nHowever, anyone familiar with Spears already knows that this was no easy path and the “Toxic” singer has gone through her fair share of ups and downs in both her personal and professional life. People reported that in her book, she reveals how she had an abortion during her relationship with Justin Timberlake because he “didn’t want to be a father”.\n\nAfter her highly publicised split from the NSync singer, Spears found love with her then-back-up dancer Kevin Federline. Although they are no longer together, she shares two kids, Jayden James, 17, and Sean Preston Federline, 18, with her ex-husband.\n\nAs we wait for the book to hit shelves, let’s find out where her teenage sons are today.\n\nJayden James and Sean Preston Federline were born during the height of Britney Spears’ fame\n\nAfter getting married in 2004, Spears and Federline welcomed their first child Sean Preston in September 2005. One year later, they had their second son, Jayden James.\n\nHowever, the marriage was short-lived as just two months later, Spears filed for divorce from Federline.\n\nHer custody battle with Kevin Federline\n\nAccording to Us Weekly, Spears and Federline had agreed to share equal custody in 2007 after their divorce was finalised. However, in January 2008, the former backup dancer was given sole custody after Spears went through a “mental breakdown” and was put on a 5150 psychiatric hold, per the source. They later agreed to allow Spears to see her kids a few times a week. The exes would go on to co-parent their kids.\n\nReports suggest though that Spears hasn’t seen her kids in over a year. In August 2022, Federline told ITV: “The boys have decided they are not seeing her right now. It’s been a few months since they’ve seen her. They made the decision not to go to her wedding [to now-ex Sam Asghari].”\n\nSean and Jayden moved to Hawaii in August 2023\n\nIt’s unclear when Spears will see her kids next, as they recently relocated to Hawaii with Federline, Federline’s wife Victoria Prince, and the couple’s two daughters Jordan Kay and Peyton Marie, per People.\n\nFederline’s lawyer told People: “It’s an opportunity for Kevin and his wife, and the boys are ready to get away from the LA microscope.” Spears “consented” to her sons’ move back in May, per the same source\n\nThe boys have spoken up about their pop star mum\n\nIn September last year, Spears’ teen son Jayden spoke out about his relationship with his mum in an interview with ITV. He said, “I 100 per cent think it can be fixed, of course. It’s just going to take a lot of time and effort. I really want to see her again.”\n\nDoes Britney Spears pay child support?\n\nCelebrity Net Worth estimates that Spears, 41, has a fortune worth about US$60 million.\n\nThe pop star has been paying child support towards her kids since the divorce, per Us Weekly. In September, however, Federline stirred up controversy by asking for an increase from the current US$40,000 that Spears pays monthly, per TMZ.\n\nAccording to British media, Spears reportedly no longer needs to pay child support for Sean since he turned 18 in September, though this hasn’t been confirmed."
