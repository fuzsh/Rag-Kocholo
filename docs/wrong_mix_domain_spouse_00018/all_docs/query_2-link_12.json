Her ethereal beauty captivated audiences, with fans even resorting to writing love letters in blood. Born into the illustrious Koirala family in Nepal, Manisha's Bollywood journey began with her debut in the Nepali film industry, eventually transitioning to Bollywood with Subhash Ghai's \"Saudagar.\" Despite initial successes, her career faced challenges, until a breakthrough performance in \"1942: A Love Story\" revitalized her stardom.\n\nHowever, personal conflicts and professional setbacks marked the beginning of her downfall. As her career spiraled downwards, Manisha grappled with substance abuse, failed relationships, and professional disappointments. Her life seemed to hit rock bottom when she was diagnosed with stage 4 ovarian cancer in 2012, amidst a broken marriage and fading stardom. Yet, her resilience and determination saw her through, and after battling cancer, she made a triumphant comeback to Bollywood, showcasing her talent in diverse roles and reclaiming her status as a respected actress.\n\nManisha Koirala's journey is one of resilience, redemption, and self-discovery. Despite facing numerous setbacks, she emerged stronger, conquering personal demons and reclaiming her rightful place in the spotlight.\nFollow @girlsbuzzindia \n#girlsbuzzindia\n#officialwomenofindia\n.\n.\n.\n#manishakoirala #heeramandi #motivation #lifestory \n[ motivational videos, life history, bollywood actress, heeramandi manisha koirala ]\".",
