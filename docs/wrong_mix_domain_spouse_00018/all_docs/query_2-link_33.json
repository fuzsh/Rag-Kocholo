Establishing a support network, be it with colleagues or friends, provides a crucial lifeline during times of distress. Furthermore, taking regular breaks to recharge and indulge in activities that promote relaxation can alleviate the burden of depression. Whether it's practising mindfulness, going for a brisk walk, or simply stepping away from the desk for a few moments, prioritizing self-care is paramount.\n\nExploring Avenues for Treatment and Recovery\n\nSeeking professional help is instrumental in managing depression effectively. Psychotherapy, medications, and self-care routines offer avenues for treatment and recovery. Many workplaces provide Employee Assistance Programs (EAPs), granting access to mental health services and counselling. Additionally, health insurance coverage for mental health care makes therapy more accessible and affordable for employees.\n\nAlso Read: Trans Actress Trinetra Haldar Undergoes Facial Feminisation Surgery; Know All About The Procedure\n\nFostering a Supportive Work Environment\n\nCreating a workplace culture that prioritizes mental health is imperative in supporting employees facing depression.
