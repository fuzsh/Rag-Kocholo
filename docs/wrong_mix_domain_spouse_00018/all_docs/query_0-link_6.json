Britney thought he was a lovely man.\"\n\nSpeaking from his home in Los Angeles, his brother Karl told how John died.\n\n\"John was on a journey from Kabul when he was shot at and killed. We were told by the State that John had died, they told us the Taliban did it. This is just awful. My family are heartbroken, my parents are elderly so this is very tough for them, and all of us. We know Britney's upset too.\n\n\"John was still good friends with Britney, he talked to her regularly. They dated for a while but always kept in touch afterwards,\" the Mirror quoted him as saying.\n\nJohn's body was repatriated to the US last week and a small family funeral was held at a Buddhist temple in LA."
