Asghari is also asking Spears for spousal support and to cover his attorney’s fees.\n\nBritney Spears and Sam Asghari: A Timeline of Their Relationship\n\nRead article\n\nThis isn’t Spears’ first time going through a public divorce. Spears and Federline — who share sons Sean Preston, 17, and Jayden James, 16 — were married from 2004 to 2006. The pair filed for divorce in 2006 and it was finalized the next year. Following their split, the duo coparented their boys before Spears’ relationship with the teens deteriorated while she was fighting against the now-notorious conservatorship held by her father, Jamie Spears, which lasted from 2013 to 2021.\n\nIn 2022, Jayden James claimed that his mother “struggled” to give him and his brother equal attention and love. Britney refuted the allegations while explaining that she “tried” to be “the best person” she could be under the conservatorship.\n\nNeither Sean Preston nor Jayden James attended their mom’s June 2022 wedding to Asghari, but Britney has expressed her desire to reconcile with her sons.\n\nBritney Spears’ Dating History: From Kevin Federline to Sam Asghari\n\nRead article\n\n“To both of my boys … I love you … I would die for you !!!” Britney wrote via Instagram in December 2022. “God speed my precious hearts !!! I would give anything just to touch your face !!! I send my love.”"
