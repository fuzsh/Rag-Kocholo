There are many controversies about this stunning actress who became well-known thanks to the song Ek ladki ko dekha to aisa laga that are still unknown.\n\nManisha Koirala and Nepal Map\n\nActress Manisha Koirala posted a controversial new map of Nepal which India has criticized for its unjustified cartographic assertion. Everything went to hell when the actor forwarded the tweet from Nepal's foreign minister Pradeep Gyawali. Manisha has received harsh criticism for her endorsement of the 'illegal' map of Nepal despite the fact that she has been working in India for years.\n\nManisha Koirala and Ek Chotisi Love Story\n\nIn 2002 Manisha accused Shashilal Nair the director of the movie Ek Chotisi Love Story of using Koirala's body double to shoot some love scenes and of maligning her by having another actress assume obscene poses without Manisha's consent. Since the double's body did not resemble Nair's Koirala insisted that these scenes be cut from the movie and that Nair reshoot them.\n\nThe Pet Case\n\nAnother controversy erupted in February 2006 as a result of rallies organized by groups of individuals in response to media reports that stated Koirala had named her pet dog after a respected Muslim figure. To avoid any issues police security was given to Manisha Koirala. The charges persisted in the days that followed. The police said the actress had no pet at all and Manisha Koirala refused the allegations.\n\nManisha Koirala and Aishwarya Rai fight\n\nAccording to a source from Filmibeat, an interview in the December 1999 issue of Showtime Magazine provided Aishwarya's perspective on the events. I felt Bombay in Tamil was great when I first saw it. On April 1st after I had arrived in Bombay Rajeev called me.\n\nI was telling him how wonderful Manisha was in the movie and that I intended to send her a flower as a gesture of support. He chuckled at me at that point and inquired me whether I had been reading the articles. He told me that Manisha had claimed to have found some letters that Rajeev had written to me in a romantic manner.\n\nAishwarya Rai Bachchan went on to say that the entire Manisha Koirala incident had a terrible impact on her and caused her to cry for days. I never desired to be associated with any certain name.\n\nHowever, the media has emphasized it so much in recent years that when someone thinks of me they immediately think of Manisha and vice versa. Years have passed since that incident but she continues to bring it up. Naturally, this implies that there is more going on here than just a broken relationship Aishwarya stated.\n\nNet Worth\n\nManisha Koirala’s total net worth is estimated at $11.5 million or 91 crores in Indian Rupees. Brand endorsements and acting are the two primary sources of Manisha Koirala. Manisha Koirala demands between 4 and 5 crores for each film.
