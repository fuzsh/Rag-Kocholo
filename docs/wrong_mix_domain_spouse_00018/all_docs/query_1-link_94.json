        "text": "Nothing brings Britney Spears and ex-husband Kevin Federline together like a soccer game. No, seriously.\n\nLast time we saw Spears and and Federline together, they were cheering on their son Jayden at his soccer match in October. The pair cordially caught up on the sidelines again on March 9, this time bringing their lovers along.\n\nSpears shared some laughs with Federline's wife, Victoria Prince, who is pregnant with her second child with Federline.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDavid Lucado, Spears' boyfriend, was also in attendance, hanging by the food truck with Spears and Federline.\n\nGreat to see Britney and K.Fed getting along! They have come a long way since their, um, chaotic days. Now all we need is a Britney and Justin reunion."
