        "text": "'The best lessons are learned during setbacks.'\n\nThe gorgeous Manisha Koirala is 53 today, August 16, 2023.\n\n\"Aur bhi gham hain zamane me mohabbat ke siva (There are other things to be sad about, apart from failure in love),\" Manisha tells Subhash K Jha.\n\nWhat are your birthday plans?\n\nI celebrated my birthday on Independence Day while hiking in the Alps with school friends.\n\nOn my birthday, I will be with my parents and close family members.\n\nI will be going to the temple in the morning and then lunch with family. I will also take time out to reflect on how my years have gone by.\n\nI will make a gratitude list.\n\nWhat does life look like to you?\n\nLife is absolutely amazing.\n\nThe quality of one's life depends on one's thinking.\n\nA lot of it is about how we create our own reality, rather than destiny. I am sure that we human beings have a lot of control over the life we lead.\n\nYou started very young as an actor, and have completed 34 years in the profession. What do you consider to be your career landmarks?\n\nSaudagar, 1942: A Love Story, Bombay, Khamoshi: The Musical, Dil Se.. and a few others have enriched my soul.\n\nWorking with brilliant directors is such a gratifying experience for any actor.\n\nSince cinema is a director's medium, whenever I work with a good director, the results are good.\n\nYour life has been tumultuous -- failed relationships, a serious illness -- what have these setbacks taught you?\n\nI think the best lessons are learned during setbacks.\n\nYou have been seriously unlucky in love. Do you miss that someone special in your life?\n\nAur bhi gham hain zamane me mohabbat ke siva (There are other things to be sad about, apart from failure in love).\n\nOf late, you have been doing work that has been creatively fulfilling. How do you view this phase of your life and career?\n\nThanks to the cancer experience, I value my time living in this planet. Whatever I do, I will give my hundred percent.\n\nI follow happiness.\n\nThe quality of work, quality of life, quality of health... all are the same.\n\nIf you had to change anything in your life, what would it be?\n\nThere are few things. But then, we are a sum-total of our experience, no?"
