        "text": "Nepalese actor\n\nSiddharth Koirala (Nepali: सिद्धार्थ कोइराला) is a Nepalese film actor,[1] best known for playing the lead in Manish Jha's Indian film Anwar (2006).[2]\n\nSiddharth Koirala was born into the Nepalese political Koirala family in Kathmandu, Nepal. His grandfather, Bishweshwar Prasad Koirala was the Prime Minister of Nepal from 1959 to 1960. His great-uncles Matrika Prasad Koirala and Girija Prasad Koirala also served terms as Nepal's prime ministers. He is the younger brother of Bollywood actress Manisha Koirala. They are of Nepali origin.\n\nIn January 2008, Siddharth married his longtime girlfriend.\n\nSiddharth entered Indian cinema as a co-producer with his sister for the comedy film Paisa Vasool (2004), which also starred his sister Manisha. He also collaborated as a writer for US television documentary Terrorism: Bio Attack (2005). His acting debut was in the poorly received 2005 film called Fun: Can Be Dangerous Sometimes.\n\nA more serious role was his second venture in the critically acclaimed Anwar (2007), which also did poorly at the box office. Siddharth took a long break and made a comeback in the directorial debut of Pakistani actor Rahat Kazmi, the dark comedy film Dekh Bhai Dekh (2009), which opened to mild response. He was seen then in a film about the 26 November 2008 Mumbai attacks, entitled Deshdrohi 2, directed by Kamaal R. Khan in 2009.\n\nYear Title Role Notes 2004 Paisa Vasool As a producer 2005 Terrorism: Bio Attack As a writer 2005 Fun - Can Be Dangerous Sometimes Aryan Bollywood debut 2007 Anwar Anwar Critically acclaimed 2009 Dekh Bhai Dekh Shyam 2009 Deshdrohi 2 2014 Megha Gaurav Nepali film debut"
