It's like she's forever in that mind-set. Which plays into part of her mental illness. :/\n\nI agree.\n\nso why aren't his other kids with him on the cover?\n\nHe raised them so well, they're already in college.

He got fat.\n\nHe's eating good with that divorce money lol\n\nokay! lmao\n\n(no subject) - prophecypro Expand\n\nSure looks like it!\n\ndoesn't seem to realize it, either. his beard (ew,ew,ew chinstrap!) is shaved funny in that second picture, like he doesn't see there's more chin there.\n\nhe looks like a d-bag, but that song actually isn't horrible. i could see it being popular if someone else did it\n\nholy cow look at her heels!!!\n\nMAJOR UPGRADE FROM THE BOOTS\n\nYES\n\nLouboutins are the upgradiest you can get <3\n\nthey kinda look like the ones from the glamour shoot lol\n\n(no subject) - ohh_hay Expand\n\nhaha dude, I totally forgot about the boots!\n\nI think for children's sakes parents shouldn't talk shit about each other so I can appreciate his words here.\n\nDoesn't mean i like him but I went though the same thing with my hubby's ex wife. No matter what bad feelings are there, the kids are the most important\n\nBritney really looks good in these pics. I hope she continues to thrive\n\nEdited at 2008-12-03 01:35 pm (UTC)\n\nAgreed, it doesn't help when the parents are at each other's throat or talking crap about the other. I think (despite it all) Kevin's stepped up and it sounds like is trying to work with Britney (and vice versa).\n\nIawtc. I was pleasantly surprised by his diplomacy. He's def not as bad as people make him out to be.\n\nIA. I don't think she said anything horrible about him either, at least not in 4 the Record. She did say he just left her, making herself sound like the victim, but she was the one to file for divorce, even if she was only doing it as a threat. Once again, he surprisingly (to me) comes off a little more level-headed and mature than her in the interviews.\n\nia. britney could take a lesson from him and not wonder out loud to the media if he's swearing around their kids.\n\nI see nip.\n\ndamn hot cops\n\nlmfao i didnt think anyone else noticed until i read this\n\ni desperately wanna pull up her dress\n\noh man, ngl those pics are fucking ADORABLE. i dont hate kevin and i do think he genuinely loves his kids and cares for britney. BUT if he really didn't care about the money, he'd go get a real job.\n\nstill.. it is what it is. at least he's (apparently) a good father to preston & jayden.\n\noh please. this dude is a straight up asshole.\n\noh, so he's just now answering to daddy? he's such a troll. we get it kevin, you're father of the year. ride britney's coattails til the end.\n\nalso.. u have to admit the boys look really happy in these photos. they always seem sad when they're with britney.. i don't know. i think she loves them more than life itself but, maybe they're just used to be with kevin.\n\nChildren, especially at this age ADORE their fathers. Even if they're not the greatest people in the world, there's something about \"Daddy's here\" that is just too exciting for them. Father-son bond is strong too, you know.\n\nyea, thats really true. i was obsessed with my dad at that age. and my bf has a young son and it's totally like that.. father/son bonding thing.\n\nFirst thing I thought! Just that they look so at ease with him and so worried when they're with her.\n\nI have a feeling Britney is the one that tells them to do stuff they don't want to do like eat their veggies and not scream in public, lol. Kevin probably never does shit like that.\n\n(no subject) - frenchverbs Expand\n\n(no subject) - meudail Expand\n\n(no subject) - benvolio87 Expand\n\n(no subject) - meudail Expand\n\n(no subject) - okgoawaynow Expand\n\nI agree 100%. It seems there's just a comfort level there that isn't there with Britney. Like I imagine being around Britney is just plain stressful.\n\n(no subject) - kristinchaos Expand\n\n(no subject) - councilestate Expand\n\n(no subject) - frenchverbs Expand\n\nits a photoshoot, of course they are smiling and looking happy, they were smiling in the ok! shoot with britney too. im sure the boys are happy (and sad) at times around both parents depending on their mood, like all kids.\n\nyou know what i was thinking the same thing about the kids seem happier with Kevin than Brit.\n\nAww, well so far the interview seems like he's kept it classy. I HATE that he felt he had to do an interview, but I'm glad he's not slamming her. They both just need to grow up and whatnot.\n\nTHis!\n\nYeah I mean it's nice of him to not have some all-out brawl with her in the media, but it is kind of weird. It doesn't really reveal anything other than the fact that he loves his kids, which I don't think many people were doubting to begin with. It's like he's trying to do some minor damage control but there's.. no damage that needs to be controlled... ? I bet he did this interview when he first found out she was doing the documentary thing and set it aside just in case the documentary said something damaging about him.\n\nHe's not incorrect. She did paint herself as the victim. I saw some of her show on the CW, and she was anything but that. She seemed rather spoiled, and I think she took that into her relationship with him and he wasn't having that diva behavior. I also think that's part of the reason she cheated on Justin too. Brit doesn't understand love, and until she does, she's going to be the way she is now - lost and alone with people that are there to be on her payroll.\n\nLol okay, I would never let my (nonexistent) kids do that but I think the picture of them sitting on the countertop is majorly adorable.\n\nafter they do this, it's probably not such a big deal, lol\n\n(no subject) - (Anonymous)\n\nI agree. I think that he's changed a lot and grown up a lot since he first got with Britney. Reading his interview just kind of confirms that for me.\n\nCrop him out of it, and that picture with Jayden and Sean on the counter is so so adorable."
