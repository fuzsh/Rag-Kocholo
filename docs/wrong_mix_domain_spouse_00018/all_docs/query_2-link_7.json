        "text": "Date of birth: August 16\n\nAddress:\n\n302, Beachwood Towers\n\nYari Road, Versova\n\nAndheri West, Mumbai: 400 061\n\nTelephone: 91 22 6319200\n\nManya studied the Army Public School, Dhaula Kuan, Delhi. She was a science student with biology as her chosen subject. She left TAPS after completing her eleventh standard.\n\nHer favorite sport is basketball, though she enjoys bungee-jumping a lot !!\n\nHer favorite color is white.\n\nShe devotes a percentage of her earnings to charity and plans to adopt a child in near future. Actually, she plans to play god-mother by taking care of all expenses of a child.\n\nHer height is 5 feet 5 inches.\n\nHer favorite movies include 'One flew over the cuckoo's nest', 'An Officer and a Gentleman' and 'Kagaz Ke Phool'.\n\nHer favorite drinks are Water, Fresh Lime Soda and Strawberry Champagne.\n\nHer favorite male stars are Marlon Brando, Dilip Kumar and Al Pacino.\n\nHer favorite female stars are Ingrid Bergman, Meryl Streep and Whoopi Goldberg.\n\nHer favorite books are Fyodr Dostoevsky's 'The Idiot', John Irwing's 'The world according to Garp' and Erica Jong's 'Fear of fifty' .\n\nHer first Hindi movie was Saudagar and the first Nepali movie she acted in was called 'Pheri Didhora'.\n\nShe is an accomplished Bharatnatyam and Manipuri dancer.\n\nFavorite comics are Tintin and Archie.\n\nHer favorite Ghazal singers are Begum Akhtar and Mehdi Hassan.\n\nShe has a younger brother, Siddharth.\n\nShe is a non-vegetarian, though she prefers to eat vegetarian food.\n\nHer favorite perfumes are Private Collection and Skate.\n\nHer favorite holiday spots are Kashmir and London.\n\nShe has only tea for breakfast.\n\nBiography\n\n(Source : www.apunkachoice.com)\n\nShe descended from the mountains bordering India. Was part of a family of established politicians who wielded power for years in her land. She was of a royal pedigree.\n\nManisha Koirala was pristine and had her roots in the Koirala family in Nepal. Surprisingly enough, the then newcomer did not resort to her influential family to provide her with a launching pad in Bollywood.\n\nShe came on her own, with slight opposition from folks, and managed to create a base on her own. Bagged a Subhash Ghai for an opening. Though Saudaagar had quite a handful of the film industry's stalwarts like Dilip Kumar, Raj Kumar, Anupam Kher, Manisha's presence was felt and appreciated. She was heralded as one of the future star-heroines of Mumbai.\n\nSaudaagar' did not do as well as it was expected to do. But Manisha set her charms on the industry. She was unusually attractive and was willing to experiment with her talent. Offers poured in but Manisha was careful in filling her bag.\n\nHer range began from Love Letter to 1942: A Love Story' to more serious ones like Akele Hum Akele Tum, Agnisakshi, Bombay, Khamoshi, Dil Se and Mann.\n\nIt is a paradox that though most of Manisha's films failed to thunder at the box office, the actress's niche was unharmed. She continued to get her share. Clubbed with her allure was her chic lifestyle that separated her from the rest in the band.\n\nIn a career spanning a decade, the Nepali beauty has done her variety and still has zest to 'work in meaningful projects'. Films apart, the person in Manisha does not shy away from taking on responsibilities to improve the state of people in the country. Women, rather girl children have called her attention and she is doing her bit to make a difference to their lives.\n\nFilms will continue to happen. But Manisha is above the rat race. She has her own territory and producers will always come back to her when they need a kaanchi with a mind for their films.\n\nMANISHA\n\n\"I'm not a wastrel nor am I wayward\"\n\nInterview\n\n(Source : www.indya.com)\n\nThe critics are on her back once again but that's hardly a matter of concern for Manisha Koirala. She cares a flying duck for opinions and righteousness bores her. She lives her life on a have-a-good-time policy and hides a yearning heart behind it. She likes to be an actress but would not like to die with her shoes on. She won't kill herself for a few roles. That's why her career tells the here-now-gone-tomorrow story.\n\nIt must be hard when the trade comes down heavily and writes you off...\n\nI've been written off so many times that I have lost count. Like Maheshji (Bhatt) once told me, people are quick to write premature obituaries. It's okay, this too shall pass. My career can never be over. Seriously, a few flops will not make any difference.\n\nI'm just waiting to dig my teeth into roles of substance. It's not important that all the movers and shakers must sign me up. It may sound strange coming from me, but I've never manipulated or plotted. If I've wanted to work with someone, I've told them straight-off. Then it's been up to them to sign me. Believe me, my PR skills are terrible. I don't ring up directors to wish them Happy Diwali or Happy Birthday. I don't woo media barons and I certainly don't keep track of what each heroine is doing.\n\nWould you have liked to work with Sanjay Leela Bhansali for Devdas?\n\nIf he had a role for me he'd have signed me. We had a misunderstanding after Khamoshi. So there was bad blood between us for a while. Once I went to him, we had a long chat and cleared the air. I was happy that he went to the Film Institute to give a lecture, just to get away from all the hype and euphoria after Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam.\n\nA section of the industry insists that you're extremely indisciplined.\n\nI know. Such reports amuse me. Every single newspaper in town writes about how I've been shooting non-stop for the last four years. If I'm indisciplined, then how come I work so hard? I haven't had a decent vacation in two years. In nine years I've completed around 35 films. I've worked with Subhash Ghai, Feroz Khan, Shekhar Kapur, Mani Ratnam, Shankar, Sanjay Leela Bhansali and Indra Kumar. Surely all these filmmakers didn't sign me on only because they liked my face. They must have sensed a degree of devotion and dedication.\n\nI admit I'm not as disciplined as Amitabh Bachchan. You cannot set your clock by me. But neither am I a wastrel nor am I wayward. I truly believe that an artiste is a free spirit and shouldn't be bound by time factors. Since film economics don't permit such liberties, I've now realised that I'm better off doing two or three films a year.\n\nDo you think an artiste should be socially responsible as many actors think these days?\n\nIf socially responsible means not playing a role that has grey or negative shades in it, I don't agree. I will accept the challenge and enact the role. If I don't, what kind of an artiste am I? Were Shah Rukh Khan to think of social responsibility, he would not have had a film like Darr to his credit. Anyway the person playing a negative role always suffers or dies or gets transformed in the end in a Hindi film. So it shouldn't really matter.\n\nWould you do a bold film like Fire?\n\nDepends, I liked Fire. See, if the script is engrossing and I have a worthwhile role in it and I'm comfortable with the director, then I don't see any reason for declining the film. The director's intentions are also important. He shouldn't be making such a film to titillate the audience.\n\nActresses like Pooja Bhatt, Juhi Chawla and Raveena Tandon have turned producers. Do you plan to do so too?\n\nI have seriously considered directing a film. I have a plot in mind which will make a good art film. I'm an art film buff. I watch German, Italian and Japanese films. But all my plans are on hold at the moment because I need to concentrate on my career as an actress.\n\nHow do you look back upon your relationship with Nana Patekar?\n\nWith great fondness. He's a very creative and extremely nice human being. I believe that whoever enters your life does so to convey a certain message. People don't see each other or feel connected without a specific purpose. There has to be some reason. What it is, is for you to understand. I have gained something from every relationship of mine.\n\nKajol and Madhuri Dixit got married this year. Does that inspire you to tie the knot?\n\nI definitely want to settle down and have a family, but not now, I'm not prepared for it as yet.\n\nWould you consider an arranged marriage?\n\n(Ponders) Hmm... Not likely, because I'm strong headed and independent. But you can't categorically rule out anything in life. If there is an offer I would want to know what the man is all about. What are his values? Is he an intellectual or one of those dumb types? Can I relate to him? Will I learn something from him or will I have to teach him all the while? A crucial factor would be the man's family background. Marriage is serious business.\n\nAfter having completed nine years in showbiz, how would you estimate your stint?\n\nBeing Subhashji's (Ghai) protégée instantly brought me into the limelight. The years that followed remain blurred. I was just not happy with the work I was doing. I signed a lot of extremely mediocre films. That was the first stage of my professional life.\n\nThe second phase began with Bombay, followed by Akele Hum Akele Tum and 1942 - A Love Story. After being called a one film wonder, directors began to take me more seriously. Fortunately Khamoshi and Dil Se consolidated that reputation.\n\nI think this is my third phase. I want to do fewer films, take a keen interest in the scripts that are being offered to me. I realise it is pointless signing up films just because I'm being paid good money. Such films go nowhere. It's almost like trying to win a losing battle. Mind you, I'm not blaming anybody for the lacklustre performance of my film."
