Tomorrow is All Saints' Day, a celebration that has been part of the Swedish church year since the Middle Ages.

Ahead of the weekend, the graves at the Royal Cemetery in Haga Park have been adorned with garlands and wreaths. Grave candles light up the royal gravestones.

The Royal Cemetery on the island of Karlsborg in Brunnsviken in Haga was built on the initiative of the King's grandmother, Crown Princess Margareta (1882-1920). The Crown Princess, who was born in England and had a great interest in garden art, explicitly wanted to be buried in nature instead of in the Riddarholm church.

Since the 1920s, therefore, with a few exceptions, all members of the Royal Family have had their last rest room in the Haga Park.

The royal burial ground is open to the public on Thursdays during the summer months.

Crown Princess Victoria and Prince Daniel live near the Royal Cemetery. During the All Saints' Day, they honored their relatives by lighting candles at the graves.

The All Saints' Day, a feast that means a great deal to all those whose relatives are no longer among us. During the weekend it is a tradition to visit the graves of their relatives and to honor their memory by lighting a candle or decorating their graves with various flower arrangements. Also the Swedish royal family has this tradition.

Many of the royal relatives are resting at the Royal Cemetery in Haga Park. Victoria and Daniel, who live close by, visit the graves now and then but of course they think it is extra important to light a candle during such a weekend.

- It's a nice tradition to light a candle at the cemeteries this weekend. This is also what the royal family thinks of and wants to pay attention to, says Margareta Thorgren.

Over the weekend, the court published new pictures at the Royal Cemetery, taken by court photographer Sara Friberg.

There will be an evening view of the Royal Cemetery on 19th August. And the event is already now sold out.

On a cape at Brunnsviken lies the royal cemetery. One evening in August we visit the place which is the last rest room for several members of the Bernadotte family.

Since the 17th century, Sweden's royalty has, with one exception, been buried in the Riddarholm church. During the 20th century, this was changed as the nature-interested Crown Princess Margareta did not want to be buried indoors. She got her last resting place on a beautiful peninsula in Haga Park.

Museum teacher Jonas Rosin takes us to the Royal Cemetery and tells us about the graves and the people resting there.
