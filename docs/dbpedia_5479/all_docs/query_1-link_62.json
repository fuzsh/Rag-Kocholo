        "text": "The locals just call it the Haga. Located about to the north of the main city, developed by King Gustav III, and made famous by troubadour Carl Michael Bellman, this massive park has a LOT to offer. The first thing you should know is that itâ€™s a lakeside picnic and sunbathing area with wide fields and clumpy little woods. But the main points of interest are the curious collection of structures. These include:\n\nHaga Gashojd Observation deck\n\nEkotemplet: The 1790 Echo Temple built as an outdoor dining room.\n\nHaga Palace: Home of some members of the Royal Family.\n\nKoppartalten: Erstwhile copper tent blue barracks turned into a cafe and restaurant.\n\nGustav III's Paviljong: Gustav III's Pavilion, a lovely neoclassical building\n\nTurkiska Kiosken: The Turkish Kiosk\n\nKinesiska Paviljongen: The Chinese Paviliom\n\nKungliga Begravningsplatsen: Royal Burial Ground\n\nStallgrunden, Haga Slott: Foundation ruins of a structure that was never finished.\n\nHow to Reach Hagaparken\n\nBuses 515, 561, 591, 592, 593, 595, 598, 607, 697 stop Haga norra.\n\nBy Car\n\nBuses 35, 49, 50, 67, 176, 176E, 177, 177E, 508, 513, 515, 595 stop Solna station.\n\nLove this?
