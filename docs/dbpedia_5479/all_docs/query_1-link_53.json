        "text": "20/05/2017; Clever idea to put a library in a park. Especially on summer days, you can just borrow a book over there,read it in the park, and then bring it back when you've finished it, a few hours later.\n\nPlease (also) follow me on my...\n\n* website\n\n* Facebook page\n\n* Werk Aan De Muur\n\nThe National Library of Sweden (Swedish: Kungliga biblioteket, KB, meaning \"the Royal Library\") is the national library of Sweden. As such it collects and preserves all domestic printed and audio-visual materials in Swedish, as well as content with Swedish association published abroad. Being a research library, it also has major collections of literature in other languages.\n\nThe roots of what we now know as the National Library go back to the days of King Gustav Vasa in the 16th century. The king collected books on a variety of subjects including history, science, and theology, as well as maps.\n\nUnder the Chancery Decree of 1661, all book printers in Sweden were required by law to submit two copies of everything they printed – one copy for the National Archives and the other for the National Library.\n\nAt first, the royal book collections were kept in the Royal Palace (Tre Kronor), which burned down in 1697. The National Library moved into its current building in Humlegården in December/January 1877/1878. The building was designed by Gustaf Dahl and built using cast iron. Two wings were added in 1926-27.\n\nen.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Library_of_Sweden\n\nThe National Library of Sweden (Swedish: Kungliga biblioteket, KB, meaning \"the Royal Library\") is the national library of Sweden.

Thomson. His full name was Carl Gustaf Thomson (1824-1899). He studied at Lund University and graduated 1850. In 1857 he became associate professor of zoology. His main field of studies was entomology and he wrote several works on the subject.\n\nThe burial to the left is that of Elof Tegnér (1844-1900), his wife Hedvig born Munck af Rosenschöld (1866-1961) and their daughter Ingeborg (1892-1996). Elof was a historian and librarian - from 1870 he worked at Kunglia Biblioteket (shortened KB - the national library of Sweden) in Stockholm, and in 1883 he was made librarian of Lunds Universitetsbibliotek (shortened UB - the university library of Lund) where he stayed until his death. He became a member of Kungliga Vetenskapsakademien (Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences) in 1899.\n\nNorra kyrkogården (the northern cemetery) in Lund. It is now in an area surrounded by houses, close to hospital, but when the cemetery was founded in 1816 it was outside the town. It was partially planned by the architect Fredrik Blom. But it was not until it had been forbidden in 1841 to be buried within the town limits that it became popular to be buried here."
