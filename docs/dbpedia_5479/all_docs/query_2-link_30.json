        "text": "Solna Church is a lovely little round church from the 12th century. Next to the church is Norra begravningsplatsen, which is surprisingly beautiful and peaceful to walk around. There is also Lindhagen Hill, with impressive mausoleums from another era.\n\nSolna church and Norra begravningsplatsen\n\nThis week we took the electric bikes on a trip to Solna Church and Norra begravningsplatsen. You might wonder why we chose a church and a cemetery as our destination, but everything pointed to it. Recently, our blog colleague Ditte a photo of Solna Church, and I reacted that I hardly knew if I had seen it, even though we live so close. Shortly afterwards, a neighbour told me about the very special grave monuments on Lindhagen Hill. 'And Peter's grandmother and grandfather are buried here.\n\nSolna church\n\nThe oldest part of Solna Church, the roundhouse, was built in the latter part of the 12th century. Later, between the 13th and 15th centuries, a porch was added to the south, a rectangular chancel to the east, a nave to the west and a tomb on the south side of the nave.\n\nThe interior of Solna church\n\nWe made a visit to the church and were surprised by a beautifully decorated small church, where the history feels heavy in the walls. There are, among other things, medieval paintings from 1440 by the church painter Albertus Pictor. Much of the rest of the interior was created under the patronage of Magnus Gabriel de la Gardie in the 17th century. Restorations were also carried out in the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries.\n\nNorthern cemetery\n\nNorra begravningsplatsen, located at Solna Church, is one of the largest cemeteries in Sweden. It is truly enormously large, and even though we got around on electric bikes, we spent several hours here. We have to say that visiting cemeteries is peaceful and beautiful, and this one is also extremely beautiful.\n\nLindhagen's hill\n\nWe started with a visit to Lindhagen Hill. This is really a special place, where large and magnificent mausoleums have been placed next to each other in the green and mountainous nature. Apparently, the habit of building mausoleums had a renaissance in the early 20th century, and powerful families had large funeral monuments built in the classicism of the 1910s and 1920s.\n\nDirectors and powerful men from the worlds of business, law and politics rest in the area, along with their families. Many architects have been involved in the design of the monuments, such as the renowned architect Gunnar Asplund.\n\nIt is peaceful to walk among the large tombs and statues. The environment is so different that it almost feels like a magical or mythical place.\n\nKnown graves at Norra Begravningsplatsen\n\nMany famous people are buried at Norra begravningsplatsen. On Lindhagen Hill, for example, is the Bernadotte grave, where the descendants of Oscar Carl August Bernadotte (1859-1953) are buried.\n\nMany other famous people have been laid to rest here at Solna Church, including Ingrid Bergman, Gösta Ekman, Siri von Essen, Per Albin Hansson, Ivar Krueger, Vilhelm Moberg, Alva and Gunnar Myrdal, Alfred Nobel, Jenny Nyström and August Strindberg.\n\nSpecial buildings at the Northern Cemetery\n\nAs you move around the Northern Cemetery, you see one special building after another.\n\nNorthern chapel\n\nThe Northern Chapel was built in 1909 as Sweden's first permanent mortuary, the name of the crematorium at the time. Today the chapel is used for funeral ceremonies and has 160 seats.\n\nThe Great Grave Choir\n\nAt the eastern end of the northern cemetery is the Stora Gravkoret. This is a 60-seat chapel where funeral ceremonies are held.\n\nWetterstedt tomb choir\n\nIn the oldest part of the cemetery there are several monumental tombs from the first half of the 19th century. For example, there is the Wetterstedt tomb in elegant late Empire style, designed in 1835 by Axel Nyström the Elder. Relatives of the Wetterstedt family are buried here.\n\nMore specialised buildings\n\nThere are also several other special buildings in the Northern Cemetery. In the Catholic cemetery there is a Roman Catholic chapel from 1901. The Jewish community's cemetery contains the Mosaic burial chapel, which has a Moorish design. There are also two monuments to the victims of persecution and the Holocaust. We did not see any of these buildings or monuments, which just shows how big the cemetery is. However, we did see the building below.\n\nFamily tombs\n\nWhat about the grave we were looking for? Yes, after some searching we found Peter's grandmother and grandfather's grave. Nice to make a visit here.\n\nHave you visited Solna Church?\n\nHave you visited Solna Church, or is there another nice church where you live that you can recommend? Do you like visiting cemeteries, or do you not like it at all?"
