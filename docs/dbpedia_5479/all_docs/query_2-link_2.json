Part of the Haga Park, the site's history as a cemetery dates back to 1922, when it was first used as a burial site for the departed Crown Princess Margareta because of her request to be not buried in a church. Notable burials here include those of Prince Carl, Duke of Västergötland and Queen Louise among others.",
