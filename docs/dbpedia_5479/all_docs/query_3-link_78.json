        "text": "He attended Lundsberg School in Värmland from 1918 until 1924, and took his school exams at the Royal Palace of Stockholm in 1925. He then carried out his officer's training and studied at Uppsala University.\n\nHis honorary roles and chairmanships included chairing the International Scout Committee, the Swedish Olympic Committee, the Swedish Sports Confederation and the Swedish Association for Hunting and Wildlife Management.\n\nIn 1932 he married Sibylla of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, and they had five children: Margaretha, Birgitta, Désirée, Christina and Carl (XVI) Gustaf.\n\nGustaf Adolf participated in the 1936 Olympic Games with the Swedish riding team, but was disqualified when his horse Aida refused to jump over the 13th obstacle in the show jumping event. The Prince was also an elite fencer with sabre and épée. In terms of prizes and awards, he is still by far the most successful royal Swedish athlete.\n\nThe Prince was killed in an air crash at Kastrup Airport in 1947."
