I t’s a tr end that began when it entered the E uropean Union and one that has continued aggressively postmillennium. Stockholm in par ticular no longer seems isolated in the remote north—it’s become a cosmopolitan city in its own right. Immigrants ar e also changing the face of S weden. I nterspersed among all those light-skinned blond and blonde locals ar e newly arrived visitors fr om such places as Turkey, Eastern E urope, and ev en the Sahara. Immigrants are spreading out and settling not just in S tockholm and G othenburg but also in some of the countr y’s smaller villages and towns. As it mo ves deeper into the millennium, Sweden still clings to its kr ona as a mode of curr ency, although mor e and more commer cial concerns ar e lobb ying for Sweden to fall under the euro umbrella. Who knows what r esults will be r evealed whenever the curr ency issue is put to a vote again? S TO C K H O L M Hotels R eopening after 2 years of a major r estoration, Scandic Anglais, Humlegardsgatan 23 ( & 08/ 517-340-11; www.scandichotels.com), has been given a ne w lease on life. The highlight of the hotel is no w the seventh-floor terrace bar o verlooking a panoramic vie w of Stockholm, which is especially dramatic at night. R ooms ar e decorated in warm earth tones and wood-laminated floors have been installed throughout.\n\nThe top furnitur e designers of Scandinavia, both past and living today , are represented in the decor of the Clarion Hotel Sign, Östra Järnvägsgatan 35 (& 08/67698-00), a chic bastion of taste. B edrooms are sho wcases—yet also imbued with grand comfort—and on the eighth floor is one of the finest spas in the city. Pärlan, Skepparegatan 27 ( & 08/66370-70), in the Ö stermalm district, may have been a girls ’ school in the 1950s, but now it’s a boutique hotel on the second floor of a r estored building that dates fr om the 19th century. Furnishings are a bit funky, a mishmash of antiques or flea-mar ket specials, and bedr ooms ar e furnished in a homelike and comfortable way. Just 5 minutes fr om the Central S tation, the Hilton Hotel Slussen, Guldgränd 8 ( & 08/517-353-00), has many luxurious touches in spite of the fact that it was built over a traffic tunnel. On the island of Södermalm, it is easily accessible fr om the center of S tockholm. M ost of the r ooms are spacious, and all of them ar e attractively and comfortably furnished. Restaurants Media attention has focused on the opening of Mathias D ahlgren, in the Grand Hotel at Södra Blasieholmshammen 8 ( & 08/679-35-84). Two different dining experiences await y ou her e, in the formal dining r oom or at the bar . Chef Dahlgren has on sev eral occasions been named chef of the y ear in Sweden. His sixcourse tasting menu is perhaps the finest in Stockholm.\n\nW H AT ’S N E W\n\n2\n\nA famed New York restaurant, Aquavit, has opened Aquavit Raw Bar & G rill in the Clarion Hotel Sign, at Östra Järnvägsgatan 35 ( & 08/676-98-50), near the Central Station. Its Swedish fare is refined and made with some of the finest of regional produce. The raw bar is the best in to wn, and y ou can or der a platter of “seven tastes” in seafood. A hip ne w addr ess for dining is East Restaurant & B ar, Stureplan 13 ( & 08/ 611-49-59), with its Asian-inspired menu and sophisticated young clientele. Recipes from all over Asia are used in the imaginative dishes pr epared with quality ingr edients and robust flavors. Inferno, Drottninggatan 85 (& 08/2016-50), is a bar, restaurant, and club patronized by an artsy crowd. Many of the recipes are modern v ersions of those ser ved at the time of A ugust Strindberg, the writer, who used to liv e in this r estored building. The place is patr onized by a hip scene of actors and artists, who stay late at night listening to some of the best DJs in the city. After D ark Fashionistas go to Laroy, Biblioteksgatan 23 ( & 08/545-076-50), in the Arnoldshuset. A skilled DJ sets the mood for the y oung and beautiful who show up here to be entertained until 3am. A comparable club on the hot list is the White R oom, J akobsbergsgatanm 29 (& 08/545-076-00), with its all-white interior and theatrical lighting. In the early morning hours, this club becomes the wildest party in Stockholm. GOTHENBURG Hotels I n 2008, Hotel Flora, G rönsakstorget 2 ( & 031/13-8616), burst onto the scene and became one of the most desirable addr esses in to wn, with a modern design and much comfor t. The staff is friendly and w elcoming, and the enter tainment str eet of A venyn lies only a stone’s throw away. Restaurants One of the best r estaurants in Sweden has opened, and it ’s unpretentiously called the Basement Restaurant &\n\nBar, at G otabergsgatan 28 ( & 031/2827-29). The continental cuisine is creative and wonder fully delicate, the ingr edients market fresh. The staff serves the best tasting menu in Gothenburg, and it is changed daily. HELSINGBORG The old G rand, the finest hotel in the city, is now the Clarion Hotel Grand, Stortorget 8–12 (& 042/3804-00), following a recent takeover by the multinational chain. The ne w managers have made many impr ovements in their update of this classic. The golden oldie is still old, but not so cr eaky anymore. A chain has also taken o ver management of another classic, no w called the Best Western H otel H elsingborg, S tortorget 20 ( & 800/780-7234 or 042/3718-00). I t still has much of its antique appeal, though modern amenities hav e been installed and rooms updated. MALMÖ Best Western has also taken over one of the top hotels of Sweden’s “third city.” The Best Western M äster J ohan Hotel, Mäster Johansgatan 13 (& 800/7807234 or 040/664-64-00), still r emains our favorite hotel. I t still has the same beautifully furnished r ooms, although it seems more modern and up to date follo wing a recent renovation. In an expansive mood, Best Western has bought Noble House, another Malmö landmark. I t is no w the Best Western Noble House, Gustav Adolfs Torg 47 (& 800/7807234 or 040/664-30-00). R ecent improvements and r efurbishing have kept it at the top of the list of the best hotels in M almö. LUND In this univ ersity city , Oskar, Bytaregatan 3 (& 046/18-80-85), is expensive but wor th it for those who want the intimacy of a small boutique hotel. I t was created by restoring two town houses from the 19th centur y in the hear t of L und. A sophisticated sense of Scandinavian design prevails here. KALMAR In this historic por t city in Eastern Sweden, the Best Western chain has\n\ncontinued its takeo ver of S wedish hotels. The Best Western K almarsund H otell, Fiskaregatan 5 (& 800/780-7234 or 0480/ 48-03-80), has been subtly impr oved and refurbished; it continues to offer affor dably priced and quite decent r ooms that ar e standard rather than exciting. KARLSTAD In the hear t of Värmland, the Clarion Hotel Plaza, Västra Torggatan\n\n2 ( & 054/10-02-00), is now running the former Radisson SAS P laza Hotel, one of the finest of the province’s hotels. Modern comforts and chain-hotel efficiency r ule today, and the dining facilities, including the new Plaza Restaurant, have been considerably upgraded.\n\n3\n\nW H AT ’S N E W\n\n1\n\nThe Best of Sweden Sweden presents visitors with an embarrassment of riches, everything\n\nfrom sophisticated cities to medieval towns to Europe’s last untamed wilderness. To help you decide how best to spend your time in Sweden, we’ve compiled a list of our favorite experiences and discoveries. In the following pages, you’ll find the kind of candid advice we’d give our close friends.\n\n1 T H E B E S T T R AV E L E X P E R I E N C E S • Shopping in the “K ingdom of C rystal”: Many visitors come to Sweden just to shop for glass. I n the “Kingdom of Crystal,” which str etches some 112km (70 miles) between the por t city of Kalmar and the to wn of Växjö in S måland province, some of the world’s most prestigious glassmakers, including K osta Boda and Orrefors, showcase their wares. At least 16 major glasswor ks w elcome visitors to this ar ea and offer cut-rate discounts in the form of “ seconds”— goods containing flaws hardly noticeable except to the most car efully trained eye. Visitors can see glass being blo wn and crystal being etched b y the land ’s most skilled craftspeople. S ee section 2, “Växjö,” in chapter 9. • Viewing the A we-Inspiring Northern Lights: In the dar kest of winter in the north of S weden (called Lapland or\n\nNorrbotten), y ou can vie w the shimmering phenomenon of the nor thern lights on many clear nights, usually from early ev ening until ar ound midnight. The sun and solar winds cr eate this amazing light show when electrons from the sun collide with atmospheric atoms and molecules. See chapter 13. • Touring the Land of the M idnight Sun: Above the Arctic Circle, where the summer sun nev er dips belo w the horizon, you have endless hours to enjoy the beauty of the r egion and the activities that go with it—fr om hiking to whitewater rafting. After shopping for distinctive wooden and silv er handicrafts, y ou can dine on filet of r eindeer served with cloudberries. You can ev en pan for gold with real-life pioneers in Lannav aara, or climb r ocks and glaciers in S arek’s National Park. See chapter 13.\n\n2 T H E B E S T A C T I V E VAC AT I O N S • Fishing: S weden offers some of the world’s best fishing for fr esh- and saltwater fish—its pristine lakes and streams ar e cr ystal clear, and many of them ar e extr emely w ell stocked. S ee especially chapters 7 and 13.\n\n• Golfing: M any S wedes ar e obsessed with golf . M ost courses, fr om the periphery of S tockholm to Björ kliden (above the Ar ctic Cir cle), ar e open to the public, and enthusiasts can play under the midnight sun.

Båstad is the most fashionable resort in H alland, and y ou can play a game of golf her e at two pr estigious courses: the Båstad Golf Club at Boarp (& 0431/783-70) and the Bjåre G olf Club at S olomonhög ( & 0431/36-1053), both located right outside the center of Båstad. See section 8, “ The Bohuslän Coast & Halland,” in chapter 7. • White-Water R afting: S weden has some of Europe’s best white-water rafting. Trips run the gamut from short and comfortable rides thr ough peaceful landscapes to hear t-stopping races on fast-running rivers. In Dalarna, the best white-water rafting is on the Västerdalälven Riv er rapids, which ar e rated moderately difficult. In northern Värmland, 5km (3 miles) south of H öljes, you can take easy white-water trips in paddle boats. See chapter 12. • Hiking: The Kungsleden (Royal Trail) provides the hike of a lifetime as it takes you through the mountains of Lapland,\n\nincluding K ebnekaise, the highest mountain in S weden (2,090m/6,857 ft.). This 500km (311-mile) trail cuts through the mountains of A bisko National P ark to Riksgränsen on the Norwegian fr ontier. S ee section 4, “Tärnaby & Hemavan,” in chapter 13. • Skiing: In Lapland, you can enjoy both downhill and cross-country skiing yearround. I n Kir una, serious skiers head for the K ebnekaise mountain station, where skiing can be combined with dog-sledding and other winter spor ts. South of the city of Gällivare, you arrive at D undret, or “ Thunder M ountain,” for some of the finest skiing in the north. The hotel to stay at her e also is called Dundret (& 0970/145-60), and its staff possesses all the expertise needed to link y ou up with cr oss-country and downhill skiing alike. I naugurated in 1955, its chairlift to the top of the slopes was the first of its kind in S weden. For Dundret, see section 7, “G ällivare,” in chapter 13.\n\n3 T H E B E S T M A R I N E VAC AT I O N S • Exploring the “G arden of S kerries” Around Stockholm: Few cities enjoy a marinescape as dramatic as Stockholm’s. The city is surrounded by some 24,000 islands and islets (some no mor e than skerries or r ocks jutting out of the water), and the water is dotted with colorful yachts. You can easily explor e the ar chipelago in summer , using the car ferries and bridges that connect it. The highlight of the journey is taking a boat trip from the center of S tockholm to the to wn of S andhamn, a ride that will intr oduce y ou to the scenic highlights of a place many Stockholmers call home in summer . S ee section 7, “S ide Trips from Stockholm,” in chapter 6.\n\n• Riding Along the G öta C anal: This canal, kno wn as S weden’s “blue ribbon,” links S tockholm in the east with Gothenburg in the w est, and is one of Scandinavia’s major tourist attractions. As boats travel along the canal, some of the most beautiful panoramas in S weden unfold. The canal dates from 1810 and covers 565km (351 miles) of beautiful scenery. Artificial canals, lakes, and rivers are linked by a series of 65 locks, some of them rising 90m (295 ft.) above sea lev el. Any trav el agent can book y ou on this trip . S ee section 1, “The Göta Canal,” in chapter 11. • Angling on the G öta Älv: The southwestern sector of Lake Vänern, which is part of the G öta Canal (see abo ve), has\n\nfolklore—is by boat. This way y ou can see and experience this most traditional of Swedish provinces from a seascape, as the scenery along the shor eline unfolds before y ou. Leksand itself is the doorway to the pr ovince’s most scenic lake, Siljan. No less an authority than H ans Christian Andersen pr onounced this trip idyllic. After a panoramic journey , you’ll arrive in Mora, a provincial town in U pper D alarna, wher e passengers disembark to see the S anta complex (Santa’s house and factor y). See section 5, “Leksand,” in chapter 12.\n\n4 T H E M O S T S C E N I C TO W N S & V I L L AG E S • Visby: O n the island of G otland, this once was a great medieval European city and former Viking str onghold. F or 8 days in A ugust, this sleepy H anseatic town awakens for the annual M edieval Week, which featur es fir e eaters, belly dancers, and tournaments. Visby’s ruins of 13th- and 14th-century churches and memories of a mor e pr osperous period are intriguing in any season. S ee section 2, “Gotland & Visby,” in chapter 10. • Rättvik: This is a great resort bordering Lake S iljan in the hear t of D alarna, a province kno wn for its r egional painting, handicrafts, and folk dancing.Timbered houses r eflect D alarna’s old-style architecture, and on summer nights, fiddle music ev okes the long-ago past. See section 7, “Rättvik,” in chapter 12. • Jokkmokk: Located just nor th of the Arctic Circle, this is the best center for absorbing Lapp (or S ami) culture. The Lapps hold their famous “Great Winter Market” here in early February, a tradition that is centuries old. You can visit a museum devoted to Sami culture in the center of town and then go salmon fishing in the to wn’s central lake. S ee section 5, “Jokkmokk,” in chapter 13.\n\n1 T H E M O S T S C E N I C TO W N S & V I L L AG E S\n\n• Sigtuna: Sweden’s oldest town, founded at the beginning of the 11th centur y, stands on the shor es of Lake M älaren, northwest of S tockholm. H igh S treet, with its lo w-timbered buildings, is believed to be the oldest str eet in S weden. Traces of Sigtuna’s Viking and early Christian heritage can be seen thr oughout the to wn. See section 7, “S ide Trips from Stockholm,” in chapter 6. • Uppsala: Located nor thwest of S tockholm, U ppsala is S weden’s major university city and boasts a celebrated 15th-century cathedral. N earby Gamla Uppsala (see belo w) also is intriguing, built on the site of Viking burial grounds where animals and humans w ere both sacrificed. See section 7, “Side Trips from Stockholm,” in chapter 6. • Lund: This to wn, situated 18km (11 miles) nor theast of M almö, rivals Uppsala as a univ ersity to wn. I t, too, is ancient, having been founded by Canute the G reat in 1020. The to wn is filled with centuries-old buildings, winding passages, and cobblestone streets; a major attraction is its ancient cathedral, one of the finest expr essions of R omanesque architecture in northern Europe.

G amla U ppsala, 5km (3 miles) nor th of the city center , is now one of the most revered historic spots in Sweden. Here Viking life dominated, and animals and humans w ere sacrificed to pagan gods. I t is suspected, although not authenticated, that thr ee S wedish kings dating fr om the 6th centur y w ere entombed here. See section 7, “Side Trips from Stockholm,” in chapter 6. • Skansen (Djurgår den, S tockholm): Called “Old Sweden in a Nutshell,” this is the best open-air museum in all of Sweden in terms of numbers of dw ellings and authenticity. Some 150 str uctures w ere mo ved fr om places ranging from the château countr y in southw est Sweden to as far nor th as Lapland. From manor houses to windmills, they’re all here, giving visitors an idea of how S weden used to look. This is an especially valuable stop for visitors who see only Stockholm and don’t have time to visit the r est of the countr y. F olk dancing and concerts enliven the atmosphere, and young Swedes demonstrate the cr eation of handicrafts fr om the 17th and 18th centuries. See p. 120. • Kivik T omb (B redaror): The Kivik Tomb was disco vered in 1748 in the château countr y of S weden, nor th of\n\nthe coastal to wn of S imrishamn. I t immediately became the most important Bronze Age discovery in the country. One of the former members of the discovery team compar ed it to being “invited into the living r oom of a Bronze Age family.” Not only the usual bronze fragments w ere unco vered but also some grav e car vings and, most notably, tomb furniture. A total of eight runic slabs depict scenes fr om everyday life, including horse-drawn sleigh-riding, plus a bit of pr ehistoric humor in what appears to be a tr oupe of dancing seals. See p. 251. • Eketorp Ring-Fort (Öland): This fortified village, built inside of a ring-shaped enclosure for defensiv e purposes, is the most impor tant of mor e than a doz en prehistoric forts known to hav e existed on Ö land in pr erecorded times. I t appears that the heavily pr otected village was inhabited b y v arious settlers from a.d. 300 to 1300. Swedish archaeologists have filled the settlement with the I ron Age–style houses that once existed her e, and they hav e r econstructed a massiv e wall along its edges. Although it is a r econstruction, it is believed to be an authentic r eplica of what the ring for t and village once looked like, giving amazing insight into life in the S weden of ages ago, when prehistoric people fought to sur vive in an inhospitable terrain.

Situated on the shores of Lake Ringsjö, today the castle is surrounded b y a r ecreation ar ea with beautiful gar dens.

It is a magnificent royal residence, a gem of baroque architecture with a palace, gar dens, a Chinese pavilion, and one of the most remarkable cour t theaters in E urope. Since 1981, S weden’s r oyal family has occupied the south wing.

E ncompassing 608 r ooms, it is used today b y the Swedish king and his family mainly for cer emonial occasions.

Between 1298 and 1681, 250 r ooms were built, many quite large; only the royal palace in Stockholm is larger than Läckö. As you approach from a distance,\n\nits distinctiv e white walls, to wers, and turrets seem to rise out of the water . The palace furnishings ev entually were carted off and the r ooms left bar e, but over the years many of the original furnishings hav e been r eclaimed and returned.

After being consecrated at the turn of the 14th centur y, it ser ved for centuries as the mausoleum for S wedish r oyalty. The chur ch’s cast-ir on steeple, which dates fr om 1841, r emains one of the most distinctiv e landmar ks of the Stockholm skyline. The interior is especially impr essive; coats of arms of knights of the O rder of S eraphim, founded in 1336, co ver the walls. The floor is pav ed with grav estones.

Today the silhouette of this largest cathedral in Scandinavia dominates the landscape, affor ding Uppsala the status of ecclesiastical capital of Sweden. Its layout is simple compared with other major E uropean cathedrals, y et its high G othic aura is nevertheless impr essive. I n one of the chapels on the south aisle, you can visit the tomb of the philosopher E manuel Swedenborg (1688–1772).

See p. 240. • Vadstena A bbey ( Vadstena): S weden’s greatest abbey , on the shor es of Lake Vättern, is dedicated to its patron saint, St. B irgitta. I n the M iddle Ages, the abbey was at the center of a pilgrimage, which earned it the appellation of “Rome of the North.” One of the most important stopo vers for those taking the Göta Canal trip, Vadstena is dominated b y its Kloster kyrkan, or A bbey Church, built betw een the mid–14th and 15th centuries to the specifications of its founder, St. Birgitta herself. This Gothic chur ch is rich in ar t and r elics from the Middle Ages. See p. 285. • Kiruna Kyrka (Kiruna): This church in the far north of Sweden, in the midst of Lapland, would har dly make it in the grand cathedral cir cuit of nor thern Europe. It is, however, one of the most\n\nunusual chur ches in the world and raises a lot of ey ebrows at first sight. I t was constructed in 1912 like a styliz ed Sami tent, with an origami design of rafters and wood beams. I n Lapland, it is hailed as “the Shrine of the Nomadic people.” A fr ee-standing bell to wer in\n\nfront is suppor ted b y pr ops and the tombstone of the founder of Kir una.

It’s the creation of German owner Norbert Lang. In winter, the Swedish game served her e is without equal in the entire countr y—just tr y the pigeon with Calv ados sauce. And y ou can always count on something tempting and unusual; sautéed sw eetbreads in nettle sauce, anyone?

As the northern end creeps over the Arctic Circle, the southern third of Sweden juts into the Baltic Sea. This southern tier is the site of most of the population; much of the north is uninhabited and occupies one of the last gr eat wildernesses of Europe. Known for its warm summers and bitterly cold winters, Sweden is a land of lakes and forests, mountains and meado ws. Because of generally poor soil and a r ocky landscape, Swedes have turned to mining, steel pr oduction, and forestry to spur their economy. Swedes are known for their almost mystical love of nature. Although they travel abroad in winter to escape the cold, Swedes are their own greatest tourists when the all-too-brief summer arrives. Many Swedes have second homes in remote parts of the country. Many visitors heading for histor y- and monument-rich F rance or I taly mistakenly think S weden lacks attractions. This is not the case: S weden possesses 1,140 historic fortresses, 2,500 open-air r unic stones, and 25,000 pr otected Iron Age grav eyards, and the Stockholm area alone has 10 r oyal castles. As in par ts of the American West, you’ll encounter one thing in Sweden that is not always available in other parts of Europe: the wide-open y onder. S pace characteriz es S weden’s v ast for ests, mountains, and national parks. Sometimes you can travel for miles without encountering another soul. Stockholm is, of course, the major target of nearly all visitors. M ore than 7 centuries old, it is a r egal place, filled with ev erything fr om the winding cobbled str eets of the medieval district to the marble, glass, and granite of its high-rises in the commer cial center. While many other world capitals may hav e passed their prime, Stockholm grows better with age. N o longer as pr ovincial as it was ev en 15 y ears ago, today it ’s liv ely, vibrant, and filled with nightlife, great restaurants, and countless shopping opportunities, along with a sophisticated, savvy population enjo ying one of the world ’s highest standards of living. And no other E uropean capital has such a dramatic landscape as the surrounding 24,000 islands, skerries, and islets. But Sweden only begins in S tockholm. At least two other major cities merit exploration: G othenburg and M almö. G othenberg, a major seapor t, is filled with tr ee-lined boulevards, restaurants, museums, endless shopping, elegant buildings, and nightclubs. And it enjoys striking scener y along Sweden’s craggy western coastline. North of Gothenburg lie sleepy fishing harbors in rocky coves and offshore islands where city folk come in summer to retreat. Southwestern Malmö boasts one of nor thern Europe’s most attractiv e medieval centers, and also is a good base for exploring the ancient univ ersity city of L und, with its mass of students, a r evered 12th-centur y Romanesque cathedral, mediev al streets, and numerous museums. However grand the cities may be, any nativ e Swede will tell you that the countr yside is the chief r eason to visit. O ur favorite destinations, the folkloric pr ovinces of Dalarna and Värmland, form S weden’s hear tland. Filled with for ests and v ast lakes, this is the landscape described in the countr y’s greatest literature. Some towns, especially ar ound\n\nimposed on them b y the w eather. Unspoiled nature under the midnight sun is a potent attraction. Finally, there is the island of Gotland in the B altic, which kne w its hey day in Viking times. This land of beaches, spas, and sailing has a warmer climate than the rest of S weden. S ome 100 chur ches and chapels still r emain on the island, and its capital, Visby, is one of the oldest cities of Sweden. I ts O ld Town wall str etches for over 3km (1 3/4 miles) and is capped b y 44 towers. Crenellated turrets and long, thin, arched windows evoke the Middle Ages. Sweden is a countr y wher e y ou can enjoy history and urban pleasures, but the nation’s heart and soul can be found in its vast landscapes. F rom a summer wilderness fragrant with fields of or chids and traversed b y wild elk to the dar k wintr y landscape dotted b y husky sleds and paraskiing, S weden pr ovides a stunning vacation experience.\n\nSweden is one of the most parado xical nations on ear th. An essentially conser vative countr y, it is nonetheless a leader in social w elfare, prison r eform, and equal opportunity for women. Despite tr ouble maintaining its oncebustling economy , S weden has long enjoyed some of the highest wages and the best standar d of living in E urope. There may be trouble in paradise, but compar ed with the rest of the world, Sweden is better off than most other nations. This is a land wher e the urbane and the untamed are said to live harmoniously. With a population density of only 18 people per square kilometer (48 per square mile), there’s ample space for all of S weden’s nine million residents. A bout 85% of S weden’s citiz ens live in the southern half of the countr y. The nor th is populated b y S weden’s t wo\n\nchief minority groups: the Sami (Lapp) and the Finnish-speaking people of the nor theast. Among the cities, S tockholm is the political capital, with a population of 1,435,000; G othenburg, the automobilemanufacturing center , has 705,000; and Malmö, the port city, has around 500,000. Once home to an ethnically homogenous society , S weden has experienced a vast wave of immigration in the past several years. Today more than 10% of S weden’s r esidents ar e immigrants or the children of immigrants. M uch of this influx is fr om other Scandinavian countries. Because of Sweden’s strong stance on human rights, it also has become a major destination for political and social refugees from Africa and the M iddle East. A v ast number of immigrants seeking asylum come from the former Yugoslavia.\n\n2 S W E D E N TO D AY\n\n1 S W E D E N TO D AY\n\n15\n\nSWEDEN IN DEPTH\n\nLake S iljan, still look as they did in the Middle Ages. Folk dances and music festivals keep the summer lively. The ancient pr ovince of S kåne in the southwest is called the château countr y, for the French-like castles that still dot its landscape of undulating fields and cur ving, rocky coastline. In spring, black windmills and white chur ches pose against a background of y ellow rape, crimson poppies, and lush green meadows. For sheer scenic drama, nothing equals Lapland, that r emote and isolated r egion of Europe in the north, home to the Lapps (or S ami) and their r eindeer her ds.

The present government is headed by a Social Democrat, Goeran Persson. B ecause of S weden’s location in the Baltic, it has been activ e in pr omoting peace among the warring B altic states. The country is an activ e member of the U nited Nations and was admitted as a full member to the European Union in 1995. Like other European countries, Sweden’s policy of cradle-to-grav e w elfare has been threatened in r ecent years. The main topic of debate in the parliament is ho w to sustain Sweden’s generous welfare system while putting a halt to ev er-increasing taxes, currently at 59%. A t this time, the state pr ovides health insurance as w ell as many generous family benefits, including an allowance for car e pr oviders, 15 months paid parental leave after the birth of a child (divided betw een both par ents), tax-fr ee child allo wances, and education stipends for children. When a Swede reaches retirement at age 65, he or she is entitled to a hefty pension that rises with inflation. Education plays an impor tant r ole in Sweden. Schools ar e r un b y v arious municipalities, providing free tuition, books, and lunches. Although attendance is mandatory for only 9 y ears, 90% of S wedes pursue some form of higher education. Adult education and univ ersity study ar e funded by the state. Sweden’s adv anced lev el of education coincides with its high-tech industrial economy. Although in years past Sweden’s economy was based on agricultur e, in the latter half of the 20th centur y and postmillennium, industr y has become pr edominant, emplo ying nearly 80% of all Swedish workers. More than 50% of Sweden’s expor ts ar e composed of heavy\n\nmachinery, including cars, tr ucks, and telecommunications equipment. Companies such as S aab and Volvo (bought b y Ford Motor Co.) produce vehicles familiar throughout the world. D espite S weden’s industrial milieu, the countr y manages to produce some 80% of its o wn food. Although such a highly industrializ ed nation depends on its factories, S weden has enacted stringent envir onmental policies. The task of monitoring the countr y’s environment is the r esponsibility of local governments. Each of S weden’s 286 municipalities has the right to limit pollutant emissions in its own sector. The environment has always play ed an integral role in the lives of Swedes. Sweden has 20 national par ks; although these wilderness ar eas ar e not r egulated b y law , Sweden’s policy of fr ee access entitles citizens to unlimited admission at no charge. Another important element is Sweden’s strong focus on cultur e. Over the past 25 years or so, S wedes hav e turned their attention to music. Today y oung people are pur chasing mor e r ecorded music and attending mor e liv e concer ts than they were even a decade ago. Book reading is on the rise (mor e than 10,000 titles ar e published in S weden ev ery y ear, and S wedes traditionally hav e had a literacy rate of more than 99%), museum attendance has increased, and there’s greater interest in the media. Swedes spend an average of 6 hours per day immersed in some form of mass media (newspapers, magazines, television, radio, and so forth). Increasingly, Sweden is being pressed to drop its neutrality and to join an expanding NA TO. The countr y continues to resist that pr essure. Although S weden has been a member of the E uropean U nion since 1995, polls today indicate that it would reject membership if a new election were held. There is a cer tain nostalgia sw eeping Sweden today, a desire to return to the way\n\nlife used to be when S weden was one of the thr ee or four richest countries in the world. As Sweden moves even deeper into the 21st centur y, its pr oblems continue. F or example, businesses can’t grow because it’s too expensiv e to hir e people. O bservers\n\nhave noted that young Swedes are starting to think internationally, and some of them are leaving S weden to take positions elsewhere in the global economy. “The people leaving ar e the v ery people that S weden needs the most, ” one S wedish businessman lamented to the press.\n\n17\n\n2 LO O K I N G B A C K AT S W E D E N\n\n. . 829 Christianity is intro-\n\n■ AD ■\n\n■\n\n■\n\nduced by St. Anskar. 1008 Pagan Viking king Olaf Skottkonung converts to Christianity. 1130–56 King Sverker unites the lands of Svear and Gotar, the heart of today’s modern nation. 1160 King Eric IX presides over a Christian country and\n\n■\n\n■ ■ ■\n\nbecomes patron saint of Sweden. 1248 Birger Jarl abolishes serfdom and founds Stockholm. 1319 Magnus VII of Norway unites Sweden with Norway. 1350 Black Death sweeps across Sweden. 1389 Margaretha rules Sweden, Norway, and Denmark by the Union of Kalmar.\n\n■ ■\n\n■\n\n■\n\n1523 Gustavus Vasa founds the Vasa Dynasty. 1598 King Sigismund is deposed after a brief union of the thrones of Sweden and Poland. 1600–11 Karl IX leads Sweden into ill-fated wars with Denmark, Russia, and Poland. 1611 Gustavus II Adolphus ascends to the throne; presides over ascension of\n\ncontinues\n\n2 LO O K I N G B A C K AT S W E D E N\n\nA BRIEF HISTORY\n\nCHRISTIANITY & THE MIDDLE A GES\n\nWith the aid of missions sent from Britain and northern Germany, Christianity gradually made headway , having been intr oduced in 829 b y S t.

In 1008, Olaf Skottkonung, the ruler of a powerful kingdom in nor thern S weden, conv erted to Christianity, but later in the centur y, the r eligion experienced har dships, with civil wars and a pagan reaction against the converting missionaries. Ruling fr om 1130 to 1156, King Sverker united the lands of S vear and Gotar, which later became the hear t of modern Sweden. A strong centralized government developed under this king. Christianity finally became almost universally accepted under Eric IX, who ruled until 1160.

B efore this period, Sweden had been r elatively isolated, although travelers from the south brought some artifacts from different civilizations. The base of Viking po wer at the time was the coastal r egions around and to the north of what is now Stockholm. Either as plunderers, mer chants, or slav e traders— perhaps a combination of all thr ee— Swedish Vikings maintained contact with the East, both Russia and Constantinople, and with parts of western Europe, including B ritain and I reland. S wedish Vikings joined their br other Vikings in N orway and D enmark in pillaging, trading with, or conquering par ts of I reland and the British Isles, their favorite targets.\n\nSWEDEN IN DEPTH\n\n18\n\nLO O K I N G B A C K AT S W E D E N\n\n2\n\nand later became the patr on saint of S weden. B y 1164, his son, Charles VII, had founded the first archbishopric at Uppsala. The increasing influence of this ne w religion led to the death of the Viking slav e trade, and many Vikings turned to agriculture as the basis of their economy .A landowning aristocracy eventually arose. Sweden’s ties with the H anseatic por ts of Germany grew stronger, and trade with other Baltic ports flourished at the city of Visby, on the island of G otland. Sweden traded in copper , pelts, ir on, and butter , among other products. Sweden’s gr eatest mediev al statesman was B irger Jarl, who r uled fr om 1248 to 1266; during his r eign, he abolished ser fdom and founded S tockholm. When his son, M agnus Laduläs, became king in 1275, he granted extensiv e po wer to the Catholic Church and founded a hereditary aristocracy. AN INTR A-NORDIC UNION M agnus VII of Norway (1316–74) was only 3 years old when he was elected to the S wedish throne, but his election signaled a r ecognition of the benefits of increased cooperation within the Nordic world.

The for tunes and power of this last group were based on trade links with a well-organized handful of trading cities (the H anseatic League) scatter ed throughout Germany and along the B altic coastline. As trade incr eased, these cities (especially Visby, on the island of G otland) and their r esidents flourished, and the power of the Hanseatic League grew. In 1350, the B lack D eath arriv ed in Sweden, decimating the population. This proved to be the gr eatest catastr ophe experienced by the Western world up to that time. Imported from Asia, after wr eaking havoc in China andTurkistan, it is thought to hav e spr ead to S weden thr ough trade with B ritain. The plague seriously hindered Sweden’s development, although the country didn’t suffer as much as nations such as England. In 1389, the S wedish aristocracy, fearing the gr owing po wer of the G ermans within the H anseatic League, negotiated for an intra-N ordic union with D enmark and the r emaining mediev al fiefdoms in Norway and Finland. The birth process of this experimental union began in the Swedish city of Kalmar , which gav e its name in 1397 to the brief but farsighted Union of Kalmar .

He commissioned a complete translation of the B ible and other r eligious wor ks into S wedish, and forcefully put down local uprisings in the Swedish provinces. He established the right of succession for his offspring and decreed that his son, E ric XIV, would follow him as king (which he did, in 1543).

Although the union was a failure, one of its legacies was the establishment—partly as a compr omise among differ ent political factions—of a Riksdag (parliament) made up of r epresentatives fr om v arious to wns and r egions; the peasant classes also had some limited representation. Queen M argaretha’s heir (her nephe w, Eric of Pomerania; 1382–1459) became the crowned head of thr ee countries (N orway, Denmark, and Sweden). He spent most of his r eign fighting with the H anseatic League. Deposed in 1439, he was r eplaced by Christopher of B avaria, whose early death in 1448 led to a major conflict and the ev entual dissolution of the Kalmar Union. The D anish king, Christian II, invaded Stockholm in 1520, massacred the leaders who opposed him, and established an unpopular r eign; ther e was much civil disobedience until the emergence of the Vasa dynasty, which expelled the Danes.

His Catholicism, however, was opposed b y S weden, which expelled him in 1598. H e was follo wed b y Karl (Charles) IX (1566–1632), who led S weden into a danger ous and expensiv e series of wars with D enmark, R ussia, and its former ally, Poland. By 1611, as Sweden was fighting simply to sur vive, Gustavus II A dolphus (1594– 1632) ascended the thr one. Viewed today as a brilliant politician and military leader, he was one of the centur y’s most stalwar t Protestants at a time when political alliances often w ere formed along r eligious lines. After organizing an army composed mainly of farmers and field hands (financed by money fr om the F alun copper mines), he secur ed S weden’s safety and, with his armies, penetrated as far south as B avaria. He died fighting against the H apsburg emperor’s Catholic army near the city of Lützen in 1632. When he died, his heir and only child, Christina (1626–89), was 6 years old. During her childhood, po wer was held b y the respected Swedish statesman Axel Oxenstierna, who continued the Thirty Years’ War in Germany for another 16 y ears. It finally concluded with the Treaty of Westphalia in 1648. Christina, who did not want to pursue war and had conv erted to Catholicism (against the advice of her counselors), abdicated the thr one in 1654 in fav or of her cousin, Charles X Gustav (1622–60). After his rise to power, Charles X expelled the Danes from many of Sweden’s southern provinces, establishing the Swedish borders along the appr oximate lines of today . H e also invaded and conquered Poland (1655– 56), but his territorial ambitions w ere thwarted b y a national uprising. H e later defeated the D anes (1657–58), and at the time of his death, S weden was ringed b y enemies. Charles X was succeeded b y Charles XI (1655–97), whose r eign was fiscally traumatic. The endless wars with Denmark (and other kingdoms in northern\n\nGermany) continued. H owever, an ev en greater problem was the gr owing power of wealthy Swedish nobles, who had amassed (usually thr ough outright pur chase fr om the cash-poor monarchy) an estimated 72% of Sweden’s land. In a bitter and acrimonious process, Charles r edistributed the land into approximately equal shares held by the monarchy, the nobles, and S weden’s independent farmers. The position of small landowners has remained secure in Sweden ever since, although the absolute monar ch gained incr eased po wer. With Charles ’s newfound w ealth, he gr eatly str engthened the country’s military power. Charles XII (1682–1718) came to the throne at the age of 4 with his mother, the queen, as r egent. D enmark, P oland, and Russia allied themselves against Sweden in the Great Northern War, which broke out in 1700. Charles inv aded Russia but was defeated; he escaped to Turkey, wher e he remained a prisoner for 4 y ears. In 1714, he returned to S weden to continue fighting but was killed in 1718. Charles XII presided over the collapse of the S wedish empire. Under F rederick I (1676–1751)— though chancellor Count Ar vid H orn (1664–1742) had the real power—Sweden regained some of its former prestige. Horn formed an alliance with E ngland, Prussia, and F rance against R ussia. The Hattar (Hats) and Mossorna (Caps) w ere the two opposing parties in the Riksdag then, and the Hats began a war with Russia in 1741. The conflict continued thr ough the r eign of the next king, A dolphus F rederick (1710–71). Although he initiated many r eforms, encouraged the ar ts, and transformed the architectural landscape of S tockholm, Gustavus III (1746–92) r evived the absolute power of the monar chy, perhaps as a reaction against the changes effected b y the F rench R evolution. H e was assassinated b y a gr oup of fanatical noblemen while attending a ball at the opera.\n\nAlthough Sweden offered weapons and 21 volunteers to F inland during its Winter War against the S oviet Union in 1939, it declared its neutrality during World War II.

Throughout the war, Sweden accepted many impoverished and homeless refugees. The rescue attempts of Hungarian Jews, led b y Swedish businessman and diplomat Raoul Wallenberg, have been recounted in books and films. Sweden joined the U nited N ations in 1946 but refused to join NATO in 1949. Rather more disturbing was Sweden’s decision to r eturn to the S oviet Union many German and B altic r efugees who had opposed Russia during the war. They were 2 presumably killed on Stalin’s orders. Dag H ammarskjöld, as secr etary-general of the U nited N ations in 1953, did much to help S weden regain the international respect that it had lost because of its wartime policies. In 1961, toward the end of his second 5-year term, he was killed in an airplane crash. Sweden continued to institute social reforms in the 1950s and 1960s, including the establishment of a national health service. At only 27 y ears old, Karl XVI G ustaf became king of Sweden in 1973, following the death of his grandfather , G ustaf VI Adolf.

B ecause he hated Napoleon, Gustavus IV led Sweden into the Third Coalition against France (1805–07). F or his effor ts, he lost Stralsund and S wedish Pomerania; in the wars against Russia and Denmark, Sweden lost Finland in 1808. The next y ear, following an uprising, G ustavus IV was overthrown and died in exile. A new constitution was written in 1808, granting the Riksdag equal po wer with the king. Under these pr ovisions, Charles XIII (1748–1818), the uncle of the deposed king, became the new monarch. Napoleon arranged for his aide, J ean Bernadotte (1763–1844), to become heir to the S wedish throne. Bernadotte won a war with D enmark, for cing that countr y to cede Norway to Sweden (1814). Upon the death of Charles, B ernadotte became king of S weden and N orway, r uling as Charles XIV . D uring his r eign, S weden adopted a policy of neutrality , and the royal line that he established is still on the throne today.

Following the assassination of O lof Palme, vice prime minister I ngvar Carlsson was shoehorned into po wer, in accordance with pr ovisions within the S ocial Democratic P arty’s b ylaws.

In the early 1990s, S weden faced some of the most tr oubling economic problems in recent memory, foremost of which was slow economic gr owth. I nflation was severe.

Following w ell-established parliamentary pr ocedures, fello w S ocial D emocrat Goeran Persson took his place. A highly capable former finance minister , P ersson appealed to S wedes with a platform that advocated cutting tax es and cur tailing government spending. D espite personal talent, P ersson has been judged as a capable but r emote administrator whose most visible drawback is a chilly , somewhat arrogant personal style that has pr ovoked murmurs of discontent among some members of the Swedish electorate. Just as its own image as one of the most progressive nations on ear th was being questioned, a chilling chapter fr om S weden’s past was r evealed in 1997. S weden had as many as 60,000 of its citizens sterilized, some inv oluntarily, fr om 1935 to 1976. The ideas behind the sterilization program had similarities to N azi ideas of racial superiority.

Fascination with the New World overcame Sweden’s population in earnest in 1846, and waves of Swedes set out to seek health, w ealth, r eligious fr eedom, and a land of their o wn. During a 5-year period beginning in 1868, five annual crops failed in Sweden, leading to the migration of at least 100,000 people. Between 1846 and 1873, a total of 1.5 million Swedes emigrated to North America—a figure that’s especially impressive c onsidering that S weden’s entir e population was only ar ound 4 million. The drain on the c ountry’s human r esources was disastr ous. O f all E uropean countries, only Ireland lost a larger proportion of its population to emigration. The first, and among the best-publicized, group of Swedish immigrants was a 1,500-member religious sect known as Jansonists (Erikjansare), whose leader, Erik Jansson, founded a colony in Illinois known as Bishop’s Hill. Conceived as a utopia, where all goods and property would be shared in common, it attracted national journalistic att ention until an enraged disciple , furious at Jannson ’s refusal to allow his wife to leave the community, shot Jansson.

Under the new bill, gays r egistered in a legal par tnership, allowed in S weden since 1995, can be considered joint adoptiv e parents. One of the partners will also be able to adopt the child of another. While S weden is har dly vie wed as a Banana R epublic, wher e its leaders ar e\n\nroutinely assassinated, violence against public officials has come to Scandinavia: One of the attacks in modern S weden occurred on S eptember 11, 2003, when Ann Lindh, S weden’s minister for for eign affairs, was stabbed and mortally wounded while on a personal errand. S he stood as a role model for many y ounger women and a r epresentative of a modern, outwar dlooking Swede. In a surprise political mo ve, Sweden in September of 2006 swept away 12 years of center-left government, voting to reject its longtime prime minister , G oran Persson, in fav or of a conser vative candidate who has pledged to r evise the w elfare state. A right-of-center coalition, led b y the leader of the M oderate Party, Fredrik Reinfeldt, beat the S ocial D emocrats. B ecause most Swedes priz e political stability , R einfeldt took pains to cast his plan as a “ fine-tuning” rather than a full-scale o verhaul of Sweden’s economic model. Unlike residents of some countries of the world, most S wedes, according to sur veys, seem content with their big-go vernment, high-tax system. H owever, joblessness remains an issue with many y oung Swedes, who have begun migrating to oil-rich N orway for better jobs with more pay.\n\n3 S W E D E N ’S A R T & A R C H I T E C T U R E PRE-CHRISTIAN ART S wedish art began in the Stone Age with rock carvings by cav emen, which depicted hunters and the beasts they pursued. With the coming of the B ronze Age, car vings began to depict more human figures, such as armed men plowing and hunting. F rom the 5th to the 9th centuries, during the I ron Age and the time of the Vikings, the human figure was mainly ignored in favor of lions, monsters, birds, and fantastic dragons. Zoomorphic shapes w ere also used as decorative elements on the r unic stones of the era. O ne of the best examples of this\n\nwas found in G otland, depicting the epic journey of a slain warrior ’s ship to the land of the dead. It dates from the 8th century. THE MIDDLE A GES Beginning in the 11th centur y, the earliest chur ches w ere constructed on the sites of pagan temples and w ere r ectangular timber str uctures. None have survived. By the 12th centur y, stone became the building material of choice for the construction of Romanesque monasteries and chur ches. Notable examples of this style include the L und Cathedral and the Sigtuna Monastery.\n\n25\n\n2 S W E D E N ’S A R T & A R C H I T E C T U R E\n\nbaroque influence. B ut the bar oque never took hold in S weden the way it did in Germany to the south. E merging in 1750 and lasting for a centur y, folk ar t flourished instead in S weden, and was used to decorate farmsteads and homes with representations of biblical figur es depicted in modern dr ess. F loral motifs dominated most of this provincial art. Gustavus III, who r eigned until 1792, favored both the R ococo and Neoclassical styles. A fusion of these two styles can be seen in the O pera H ouse in S tockholm and the Royal Exchange. CLASSICISM & EMPIRE U sing classical precedents, architects were inspired by Italy in the second half of the 1700s; the 1773 School of the A cademy of Ar ts, in Stockholm, is one such example, as is th Palace Theater in G ripsholm. After the loss of F inland in the N apoleonic Wars, Swedish ar chitects concentrated on the military, er ecting the Karlsborg F ortress and the Göta Canal. REVIVALISM D uring industrialization in the 19th centur y, the Ar t N ouveau movement produced no building of note in Sweden. Rather , ar chitects pursued whatever fantasy suited them: F redrik Wilhelm Scholander, for example, was inspir ed b y Assyrian motifs for Stockholm’s Synagogue, while Friedrich August Stüler looked to the Renaissance for his N ational M useum of Fine Arts in Sweden. NATIONAL ROMANTIC ST YLE As the 1800s ended and the 20th centur y burst onto the scene, the ar chitects of the day turned from classicism. They preferred a mor e N ational R omantic and J ugenstil style, designing often in brick and wood. The crowning achievement of this period is the S tockholm City H all designed b y Ragnar Ö stberg and built betw een 1903 and 1923. MODERN & POSTMODERN M assive building pr ojects w ere under taken after\n\nSWEDEN IN DEPTH\n\nAppearing in the 13th centur y, the Gothic style brought in brick as a building material. The most outstanding example of this style was the Cathedral at U ppsala, north of Stockholm. About 1,500 S wedish chur ches, plus a few burghers ’ houses in S tockholm and Visby, date fr om the M iddle Ages. The 13th-century city walls env eloping Visby are some of the best preserved of their type in Europe, and the lay out of S tockholm’s Gamla Stan, or Old Town, still follows its medieval routes from the Middle Ages. Painting in this period consisted mainly of mural paintings in the mediev al churches: Storybook illustrations explaining biblical stories were needed as most of the population was illiterate. Wooden altarpieces w ere also impor ted into S weden from Germany. THE RENAISSANCE The coming of the Renaissance and the acceptance of the Protestant religion in S weden in the 16th century br ought changes in ar chitectural styles imported from Italy via Belgium and Holland. The castles of G ripsholm w ere erected, for example, in 1537 during the reign of Gustavus I; the castle at Vadstena was built in 1545. Kalmar Castle, with its massive walls and fusion of mediev al and Renaissance features, also was constr ucted during this period of upheaval. Painters and sculptors during the 16th and 17th centuries took a back seat. M ost art came from European masters imported to the royal courts. BAROQUE Sweden r ose to become a world po wer in the 17th centur y, and noblemen built palaces to r eflect their newly acquired wealth. Most of these w ere based on French models. French influences were also in evidence thr oughout most of the architecture of the 18th centur y. Many S wedish ar tists w ent abr oad, including the sculptor J ohan Tobias v on Sergel (1740–1814), who spent 12 y ears in R ome, wher e he came under a heavy\n\nSWEDEN IN DEPTH\n\n26\n\nT H E L AY O F T H E L A N D\n\n2\n\nWorld War II to accommodate a burgeoning population. E ntire dormitory suburbs were constr ucted, often in a dull, bland style. The emphasis was on functionalism and modernity. Many architecturally sensitive S wedes cited the negativ e social consequences of these peas-in-a-pod communities enveloping Sweden’s cities. Postmodernism then emerged in the 1950s, encompassing a variety of different trends, even some used during the National Romantic period. D esigners of 20thcentury buildings used such terms as “minimalism” or “neofunctionalism.”\n\nSculpture in this time was dominated by Carl Milles (1875–1955); a major work of his, the Gustavus Vasa wood carving, is in the Nordiska Museum in Stockholm.
