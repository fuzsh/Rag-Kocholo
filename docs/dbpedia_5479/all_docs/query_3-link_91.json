        "text": "King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden has remembered his predecessor as monarch in a speech to parliament that marked the beginning of his Golden Jubilee.\n\nJust hours before official celebrations for the milestone were due to begin, the Swedish king spoke to his country’s politicians as he officially opened the new parliamentary year. And he spoke movingly of the time, half a century ago, when he waited for the Swedish throne to pass to him.\n\nKing Carl Gustaf spoke to parliament on September 12th 2023 but as he addressed them, he noted that ”today, exactly 50 years ago, my family and I watched at the deathbed of my grandfather, King Gustaf VI Adolf. A few days later he passed away and I became king of the country.”\n\nKing Gustaf VI Adolf had been admitted to hospital in Helsingborg after becoming ill and developing pneumonia. He died there on September 15th 1973, at the age of 90. The first sight of his grandson as King Carl XVI Gustaf came as he left the hospital following his grandfather’s death.\n\nHowever, the current King of Sweden also reflected on the monarchy he had inherited. Just before King Gustaf VI Adolf died, he initiated changes to the monarchy which stripped away its political power and made the king a ceremonial figure. Those changes took effect in the first years of the new reign.\n\nKing Carl XVI Gustaf told parliament that ”I knew nothing about what this half century would be like, and what I would experience as head of state. But today I can say what I have felt and what I still see: that Sweden is a rich and strong country.”\n\nThe king noted the many challenges facing the country in the months ahead, issues that parliament will have to deal with. But he added ”with the experience of age, I would also like to say this: we have been through difficulties before – together! If we learn from history, we have a good chance of moving forward.”\n\nThe King of Sweden was accompanied by Queen Silvia for the traditional ceremony to open parliament. Crown Princess Victoria and Prince Daniel, as well as Prince Carl Philip and Princess Sofia, were also present.\n\nBefore the parliamentary session, the Swedish Royal Family attended a church service at Stockholm Cathedral.\n\nThe official Jubilee celebrations for the 50th anniversary of the reign of King Carl XVI Gustaf begin on September 13th 2023 with receptions at the Royal Palace. On the actual anniversary of his accession, King Carl XVI Gustaf will attend a Te Deum and oversee the Changing of the Guard before celebrations at the Royal Palace and a gala dinner."
