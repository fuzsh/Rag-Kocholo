Count Carl Johan was a dignified, humble and a very nice man. He stressed out in many interviews, how close he felt to Victoria and Daniel also, how glad he and his wife were of the birth of Estelle, and thanked the king and the queen for the warmed relationship.\n\nI wish the court would have had more warmth and expression of sadness in the press release.\n\nCharlotte_Aster\n\nRoyal Highness\n\nJoined\n\nJun 15, 2006\n\nMessages\n\n1,583\n\nCity\n\nHeidelberg\n\nCountry\n\nGermany\n\nMay he rest in peace.\n\nIs there any news of funeral date?\n\nMeraude\n\nSerene Highness\n\nJoined\n\nJan 8, 2011\n\nMessages\n\n1,311\n\nCity\n\n-\n\nCountry\n\nAntarctica\n\nThe press release is just an official information that count Carl Johan is dead, there will most likely come a personal note from the king and possibly also from crown princess Victoria, the same way there were a personal note from the king after the death of queen Ingrid of Denmark.\n\nOP\n\nOP\n\nLadyFinn\n\nImperial Majesty\n\nJoined\n\nJun 22, 2007\n\nMessages\n\n36,448\n\nCity\n\nSouthwest\n\nCountry\n\nFinland\n\nMay he rest in peace.\n\nIs there any news of funeral date?\n\nNot yet, I think. There are many things to consider: the christenings of princess NN of Denmark and Estelle (20th and 22nd), Frederik's and Mary's official visit to South Korea (10-15th), the Diamond Jubilee lunch of queen Elizabeth, king Carl Gustaf's and queen Silvia's state visit to South Korea (30th May-1st June). This is if everyone is going to attend the funeral.\n\nRoyal expert Sten Hedman to Expressen:\n\nCount Carl Johan was very close to the royal family and got considerable recognition in recent years. He had a very good relationship with the king, says Sten Hedman. The king has shown him much attention, and they were close. The king and Silvia followed his last days very close and they were very keen on him. Among other things, they were recently celebrating Carl Johan's 95th birthday and he was often invited to the castle.\n\nCarl Johan Bernadotte lived in Skåne and was treated at Ängelholms hospital during his last hours in life. There will be no state funeral. Considering how he was as a person, he would probably not want any more either. But the royal family will attend the funeral, says Hedman.\n\nKungens farbror är död - \"De stod varandra nära\" | Nyheter | Expressen | Senaste nytt - Nyheter Sport Ekonomi Nöje\n\nGoogle translation\n\nLast edited: May 6, 2012\n\nladyroyal\n\nCommoner\n\nJoined\n\nFeb 11, 2012\n\nMessages\n\n16\n\nCity\n\nVäxjö\n\nCountry\n\nSweden\n\nTv4 made an interview with Carl Johan before his 95th birthday in October 2011:\n\nNyhetsmorgon: Carl-Johan Bernadotte inför 95-årsdagen - TV4 Play\n\nRead more about him here:\n\nKungligheter: Greve Carl Johan Bernadotte har avlidit\n\nMeraude\n\nSerene Highness\n\nJoined\n\nJan 8, 2011\n\nMessages\n\n1,311\n\nCity\n\n-\n\nCountry\n\nAntarctica\n\nCount Carl Johan will probably be buried at Kungliga begravningsplatsen (the Royal Cemetary) at Haga Park, Kungliga begravningsplatsen - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia , where his parents and three brothers are buried.\n\nAn Ard Ri\n\nSuper Moderator\n\nJoined\n\nJun 30, 2009\n\nMessages\n\n43,295\n\nCity\n\nAn Iarmhí\n\nCountry\n\nIreland\n\nMay he rest in peace!\n\nHans-Rickard\n\nSuper Moderator\n\nJoined\n\nFeb 4, 2007\n\nMessages\n\n2,338\n\nCity\n\nStockholm\n\nCountry\n\nSweden\n\nMeraude said:\n\nCount Carl Johan will probably be buried at Kungliga begravningsplatsen (the Royal Cemetary) at Haga Park, Kungliga begravningsplatsen - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia , where his parents and three brothers are buried.\n\nYes that's very likely if he hasn't specifically wished to be buried in his home diocese in Skåne. Time will tell. It will likely be à very private funeral but I think a lot members from the swedish and danish royal houses will attend.\n\nVery sad to learn about his passing. He was very popular here in Sweden in recent years. The flag on the roof at the royal palace here in Stockholm were not at half mast this morning but i think it be lowered to half mast later.\n\nAs someone already stated we will likely see a personal note from the king and maybe also the crown princess later.\n\nMeraude\n\nSerene Highness\n\nJoined\n\nJan 8, 2011\n\nMessages\n\n1,311\n\nCity\n\n-\n\nCountry\n\nAntarctica\n\nYes that's very likely if he hasn't specifically wished to be buried in his home diocese in Skåne.\n\nI think might depend on where his first wife Kerstin is buried, if she's buried at Haga then Carl Johan will also be buried there.\n\nOP\n\nOP\n\nLadyFinn\n\nImperial Majesty\n\nJoined\n\nJun 22, 2007\n\nMessages\n\n36,448\n\nCity\n\nSouthwest\n\nCountry\n\nFinland\n\nI think might depend on where his first wife Kerstin is buried, if she's buried at Haga then Carl Johan will also be buried there.\n\nKerstin Bernadotte is buried at the churchyard of Båstad.\n\nKerstin Elin Marga Bernadotte - Båstad-Östra Karups församling - gravar.se\n\nFinally a statement at the court website:\n\nGreve Carl Johan Bernadotte af Wisborg har avlidit - Sveriges Kungahus\n\nGoogle translation\n\nSVD has a photo gallery of the life of Count Carl Johan\n\nBILDEXTRA: Carl Johan Bernadottes liv i bilder - Sverige - Sydsvenskan-Nyheter dygnet runt\n\nKronprinsesse Victorias kjære grandonkel er død - VG Nett om Sverige\n\nLast edited: May 6, 2012\n\nMagMil\n\nHeir Presumptive\n\nJoined\n\nJan 28, 2011\n\nMessages\n\n2,604\n\nCity\n\nSkopje\n\nCountry\n\nMacedonia\n\nMay he Rest in Peace!!!\n\nIva\n\nCourtier\n\nJoined\n\nDec 29, 2009\n\nMessages\n\n525\n\nCity\n\n-\n\nCountry\n\nSlovakia\n\nThis is a very sad news, may he rest in peace.\n\ngrevinnan\n\nHeir Presumptive\n\nJoined\n\nJun 25, 2005\n\nMessages\n\n2,383\n\nCity\n\nSan Francisco\n\nCountry\n\nUnited States\n\nThe Bernadotte males certainly live long and healthy lives.
