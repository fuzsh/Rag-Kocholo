        "text": "Bureaucratic Archaeology is a multi-faceted ethnography of quotidian practices of archaeology, bureaucracy, and science in postcolonial India, concentrating on the workings of the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI). This book uncovers an endemic link between the micro-practice of archaeology in the trenches of the ASI and the manufacture of archaeological knowledge, wielded in the making of political and religious identity and summoned as indelible evidence in the juridical adjudication in the highest courts of India. This book is a rare ethnography of the daily practice of a postcolonial bureaucracy from within rather than from the outside. It meticulously uncovers the social, cultural, political, and epistemological ecology of ASI archaeologists to show how the postcolonial state assembles and produces knowledge. This is the first book-length monograph on the workings of archaeology in a non-western world. It scrupulously shows how the theory of archaeological practice deviates, transforms, and generates knowledge outside the Euro-American epistemological tradition. Ashish Avikunthak teaches at the University of Rhode Island and is a cultural anthropologist and filmmaker. He was named Future Greats 2014 by ArtReview. Subject of more than a dozen retrospectives and sixteen solo shows, his films have been shown in film festivals, galleries, and museums worldwide.\n\nThe volume attempts to cover the recent research trends of archaeology in Northeast India. Initiated in 1867 by Sir John Lubbock, archaeological investigation in the region has a history of one and half a century. The volume includes 40 research papers contributed by upcoming and senior researchers on a variety of issues such as prehistoric and historical archaeology; art, architecture, iconography and epigraphy; pottery studies; megaliths and mortuary practices; ethno-archaeology and oral history; historical linguistics; material cultural studies; metallurgy and cultural heritage management in different parts of Northeast India. The present volume to mark the 150 years of prolonged research in the region will therefore be an important and essential reading for students and researcher in archaeology and allied disciplines."
