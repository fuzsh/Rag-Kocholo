        "text": "Riddarholm Church is Stockholm's only surviving medieval monastery church. This magnificent building, built at the end of the 13th century, has long served as the burial place of the Swedish kings. Almost all Swedish rulers, from Gustav II Adolf to Gustaf V, are buried here.\n\nRiddarholm Church\n\nRiddarholm Church is not only magnificent with its tall cast iron spire. It also harbours a large and important part of Swedish royal history.\n\nRiddarholmskyrkan is located on Riddarholmen, which together with the Old Town forms the historic centre of Stockholm.\n\nA medieval monastery church\n\nRiddarholm Church began to be built at the end of the 13th century by Franciscan monks, or Gråbrödramunkar as they were called in Sweden because they were dressed in grey. Magnus Ladulås, who was King of Sweden from 1275 to 1290, wrote in his will that he wanted to be buried here, and this probably influenced the church to become as lavish and powerful as it did.\n\nThe church was originally two-storeyed, but when the southern aisle was built in the 15th century, it became three-storeyed. Over time, the gravestones on the floor have also been added, because yes, you step on graves everywhere.\n\nThe characteristic cast-iron spire was added in 1835, after a fire caused the previous spire to collapse. The new one, designed by architect Erik Gustaf Göthe, took on a neo-Gothic style.\n\nA church filled with royal tombs\n\nWith the exception of Queen Kristina, all Swedish rulers from Gustav II Adolf to Gustaf V are buried in Riddarholm Church. The medieval kings Magnus Ladulås and Karl Knutsson Bonde are also buried here. A total of 17 Swedish monarchs are buried in the church, with their families, making it a very special place.\n\nThe High Choir in Riddarholm Church\n\nAt the high choir you will find King Magnus Ladulås (1240-1290) and King Karl Knutsson Bonde (1408/1409-1470). It was these former kings who created the tradition of Riddarholm Church as a royal burial site.\n\nThe Gustavian tomb\n\nThe Gustavian tomb was built for Gustav II Adolf (1594-1632), who rests in a large Italian marble sarcophagus. In the adjacent coffins lie Queen Maria Eleonora (1599-1655), a stillborn daughter (1621), Princess Kristina (1623-1624) and Princess Agnes of Holstein-Gottorp (1578-1627).\n\nThere is also a Gustavian tomb in the lower regions of the church, but it is not open to visitors. Here lie the kings Adolf Fredrik (1710-1771), Gustav III (1746-1792), Charles XIII (1748-1818) and Gustav IV Adolf (1778-1837) and their consorts.\n\nThe Karolinska Grave Choir\n\nIn the Karolinska tomb, King Charles XII (1682-1718) rests in a black marble sarcophagus, and next to him lie Queen Ulrika Eleonora the Younger (1688-1741) and King Frederick I (1676-1751).\n\nThere is also a Carolingian vault, where King Charles X Gustav (1622-1660), Queen Hedvig Eleonora (1636-1715), King Charles XI (1655-1697) and Queen Ulrika Eleonora the Elder (1656-1693), among others, rest.\n\nThe The Bernadotte tomb\n\nIn the Bernadotte tomb, the ancestor of the dynasty, Charles XIV Johan (1763-1844), lies in a gleaming sarcophagus of river valley granite, with Queen Desideria (1777-1860) in front of him. The other rulers of the Bernadotte dynasty rest against the walls, the last in line being Gustav V (1858-1950), because in the early 1900s Crown Princess Margareta ensured that the royals were buried outdoors instead, in the open air. Haga Park.\n\nThe Bernadotte vault also houses a number of princes and princesses who lived in the 19th and early 20th centuries.\n\nMore graves in Riddarholmskyrkan\n\nIt is not only royalty that is buried in Riddarholm Church, but also nobility and other important historical figures. Vasaätten's grave is named after Gustav Vasa's great-grandfather, Kristiern Nilsson Vasa, who lies here next to his wife Margareta Krummedike.\n\nSome of the graves contain military figures from the Thirty Years' War, such as the famous Count and Field Marshal Lennart Torstensson.\n\nIn the Strijk tomb lie Governor Hans Strijk (1595-1653) and his wife Brita Skytte. This tomb is special because the spouses are sculpted in life size.\n\nThe tomb of Christ - a 600-year-old statue\n\nThe Tomb of Christ is not another tomb, but a wooden sculpture from around 1400 depicting Christ that was used in the Easter Passion Play in the Middle Ages. The sculpture came to Riddarholm Church in the Middle Ages, but in the 18th century it was moved from one place to another and only found its way back in the 19th century. Then it was forgotten in an attic, and it is only recently that it has once again been given a visible place in the church.\n\nSeraphim shields and Seraphim rings\n\nAnother attraction of Riddarholm Church is the Seraphim shields, which have been hung here since 1748. These are shields for knights and members of the Order of the Seraphim, which is Sweden's most prestigious and highest honour.\n\nWhen a Seraphim knight is buried, Riddarholm Church performs a so-called Seraphim ringing. After the ringing has taken place, the shield is moved here and hung in the church.\n\nVisiting Riddarholm Church\n\nRiddarholm Church is open to the public for a fee between May and September. Very interesting to visit! Since 1809, no regular services have been organised, but the church serves as a museum and memorial church. In the summer, classical concerts are usually organised in the church.\n\nThings to see and do near Riddarholm Church\n\nNot far from the Riddarholm Church is the House of Knights, which is open to the public for one hour a day and unexpectedly interesting to visit. Close by is also Old Town, which offers lots of sights such as the Royal Palace, Storkyrkan with St Göran and the dragon, Stortorget and Västerlånggatan where we have 30 hot tips. You can also take the opportunity to stroll in Kungsträdgården, where the Makalös Palace once stood.\n\nHave you been to Riddarholm Church?\n\nHave you visited the Riddarholm Church in Stockholm? Do you like this kind of historical sights?"
