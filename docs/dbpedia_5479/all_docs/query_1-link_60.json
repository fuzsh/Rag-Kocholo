        "text": "Royal castles in Sweden are what we're talking about today. Did you know that there are 11 Swedish castles that are usually considered royal? In addition, there are other castles and villas with royal connections ...\n\nRoyal palaces in Sweden\n\nWhen we talk about royal palaces in Sweden, we usually refer primarily to the eleven castles owned by the Swedish state that have been subject to the royal right of disposal since the beginning of the 19th century. You can read more about them and see pictures here.\n\nWe have visited virtually all of the royal palaces in Sweden, with the exception of Haga, but sometimes we have visited them during low season or a pandemic, so we have only seen some from the outside. In many cases, guided tours are also available, at least during the summer months.\n\n1. the Royal Palace in Stockholm\n\nThe Royal Palace in Stockholm was built in 1697, after the previous 'Tre Kronor' Palace burned down. The palace is the official residence of H.M. the King, and a large part of the monarchy's representation takes place here. Despite this, the castle is also open to tourists.\n\nYou can visit the beautiful State Apartments, with or without a guide. There is also a wide range of museums here: Livrustkammaren, Skattkammaren, Museum Tre Kronor and Gustav III's Antique Museum, as well as the beautiful Castle Church.\n\n2. Rosendal Castle\n\nOn Djurgården in Stockholm is the smaller Rosendal Castle. This castle was built in the 1820s for King Karl XIV Johan and has served as a pleasure palace, where the royals went to get away from the formal court life in the city for a while.\n\nThe castle is built in the Swedish empire style known as 'Karl Johan style'. You can check out the castle while walking around Djurgården. During the summer it is also possible to join a guided tour inside the castle.\n\n3. Drottningholm Palace\n\nDrottningholm Palace in Stockholm was built in the 17th century and is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site. This beautiful Swedish royal palace was built after French models, by architect Nicodemus Tessin the Elder, on behalf of Queen Hedvig Eleonora. Since 1981, the palace has served as the permanent residence of the royal couple.\n\nAlthough the royal couple live here, most of the castle and park are open to visitors all year round. You can stroll around the beautiful castle park, among all the statues and buildings, and you can also see the castle's halls, take a guided tour of the unique castle theatre or perhaps have a coffee in the castle café.\n\n4. China Castle\n\nAt the far end of Drottningholm Palace Park is China Palace, which together with the castle is on UNESCO's prestigious list. Adolf Fredrik had the castle built in secret, and then surprised Lovisa Ulrika with the castle as a birthday present in 1753, although the castle you see today dates from 1769.\n\nAt this time, China was perceived as an exotic fairytale land, and Chinese artefacts were all the rage. The palace houses porcelain, ornaments and original Chinese wall coverings, which you can see when the palace is open.\n\n5. Ulriksdal Castle\n\nUlriksdal Palace was built in the Renaissance style around 1640 by the powerful marshal Jacob De la Gardie, and received its current appearance in the 18th century. Many royals have stayed here, and today the WWF has offices in one of the wings.\n\nHere you can walk in the castle park or shop in the castle garden, which is a large commercial garden with flowers and furnishings. You can also have a coffee or join a guided tour of the castle.\n\n6. Gustav III Pavilion\n\nGustav III's Pavilion is located in the large and beautiful Haga Park in Solna outside Stockholm. The palace was completed in 1789, and King Gustav III immediately moved in. He lived here until his death, which occurred a few weeks after the fateful night of the masquerade ball.\n\nThe building was extensively altered in the 19th century, but the original interior has since been restored based on original drawings. The pavilion is open for visitors during the summer months.\n\n7. Haga Castle\n\nHaga Palace, where Crown Princess Victoria and Daniel live, is also located in Haga Park and is perhaps the most private of all the royal palaces in Sweden. The palace, formerly known as the Queen's Pavilion, was built in 1802-1805 for King Gustav IV Adolf by architect Carl Christoffer Gjörwell the Younger. The castle is well screened and not open to the public.\n\n8. Rosersberg Castle\n\nRosersberg Castle, located in Sigtuna, began construction in 1634 and was completed four years later. The castle was expanded several times, but by the middle of the 19th century it can be said that history stopped. Charles XIV Johan and his wife Desideria were the last royals to live here, and today the rooms look almost exactly as they did then.\n\nDuring the summer months, guided tours are organised to see the rooms of the castle. In addition, you can always enjoy the park and the beautiful natural surroundings.\n\n9. Tullgarn Castle\n\nTullgarn Castle is close by Trosa in Södermanland, and offers beautiful views. The current castle was built in the 1720s and has been a royal pleasure palace since the 1770s when the state handed the building over to Duke Fredrik Adolf. The castle is also associated with King Gustaf V and Queen Victoria, who spent summers here at the turn of the century.\n\nThe beautiful castle park is a popular picnic spot. During the summer months, guided tours are also organised to see the interiors of the castle. There is also a castle café and a castle stall.\n\n10. Gripsholm Castle\n\nGripsholm Castle, located in Mariefred, is named after Bo Jonsson Grip, who built the first castle on the site in the 14th century. The castle you see today was built in 1537, on the initiative of Gustav Vasa.\n\nThe castle can be explored on your own or with a guide. Attractions include the Gustav III Theatre and the Swedish State Portrait Collection. The castle is also close to the Gripsholm Deer Park nature reserve.\n\n11. Strömsholm Castle\n\nStrömsholm Castle is a beautiful castle in the neighbourhood of Västerås. As early as the 16th century, Gustav Vasa had a castle built on the site, and in the 1660s, Hedvig Eleonora replaced the castle with the one we see today. The interior was then remodelled in the 1730s, under the direction of Ulrika Eleonora the Younger.\n\nToday, Strömsholm is strongly associated with horses. There is a riding school here, and major horse competitions are usually held here. Guided tours are also organised, especially during the summer months.\n\nOther royal palaces in Sweden\n\nIn addition to the palaces that are usually considered royal palaces in Sweden, there are also a number of other palaces and villas that have been owned or occupied by the Swedish royal family over the years. Here are some of the Swedish homes that are associated with our royals in various ways:\n\nPalace of the Hereditary Prince (royal disposition until 1906), Gustav Adolfs torg 1, Stockholm.\n\nByström villa (in royal ownership until 1928), Djurgårdsvägen 21, Stockholm, Sweden\n\nCourt stables (royal right of disposal), Väpnargatan 1, Stockholm.\n\nOakhill (in royal ownership until 1926), Djurgårdsvägen 174, Stockholm, Sweden\n\nSolliden (in royal possession), Borgholm, Öland\n\nStenhammar Castle (in royal lease), Flen\n\nSofiero Castle (in royal possession until 1973), Sofierovägen 131, Helsingborg, Sweden\n\nVilla Beylon (royal right of disposal), Ulriksdal Palace Park, Solna, Sweden.\n\nVilla Parkudden (royal right of disposal), Prinsessan Ingeborgs väg 14, Isbladsviken, Stockholm.\n\nVilla Solbacken (in royal ownership since 1949), Djurgårdsbrunnsvägen 67, Stockholm, Sweden\n\nWaldemarsudde (in royal possession until 1947), Prins Eugens väg 6, Stockholm, Sweden\n\nHave you visited any of the royal palaces in Sweden?\n\nHave you visited any of the royal palaces in Sweden? Which ones? How was your experience?"
