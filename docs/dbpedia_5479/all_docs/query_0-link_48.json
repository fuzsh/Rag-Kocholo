        "text": "What can you do in Solna? We have lived in Solna for eight years, and before that we lived in the neighbouring municipality of Sundbyberg. Now in times of corona, we've been looking around in our neighbourhood. Here are our best tips for activities and experiences in Solna.\n\nSolna\n\nSolna is a vibrant municipality with great variety. It has everything from nature and royal castles to shopping centres and research institutions. The name probably means 'Sun Island' and that sounds nice, doesn't it?\n\nSolna belongs to Stockholm County and is located just north-west of the capital. The municipality borders the city of Stockholm and Sundbyberg, and with water in between also the municipality of Danderyd.\n\nWhat can you do in Solna?\n\nSo what can you see and do in Solna? All sorts of things actually! We have collected our best tips here in a list.\n\n1. Birdwatching at Lake Råsta\n\nRåstasjön is a fantastic bird lake located in the Råsunda district of Solna, not far from Friends Arena and the Mall of Scandinavia indoor centre. The nature of the Råstasjön nature reserve is green and beautiful, and it's great for walking. You can also spot many different kinds of birds.\n\nThe lake is home to some 100 bird species, including ducks, swans, grebes, swamphens, brown ducks, laughing gulls and reed warblers. Around the lake you can also see terns and goshawks and, depending on the season, birds such as herring gulls, nightingales, robins and herons. The herons live most of the year at Isbladskärret on Djurgården, but move to Solna in winter.\n\n2. Shop at Westfield Mall of Scandinavia\n\nThe Westfield Mall of Scandinavia is a very large and modern shopping centre with hundreds of shops and restaurants. There are almost 70 clothing stores, as well as shops selling electronics, furnishings and sports equipment. When you get hungry, you can eat Italian, Lebanese or Asian food - why not try 'Kaiten', or conveyor belt sushi?\n\nThe mall also has a huge cinema (currently closed) with 15 screens, including an IMAX screen and four luxurious VIP screens. O'Learys also offers activities such as billiards, bowling, mini-golf and much more.\n\n3. Experiencing events in Friends Arena\n\nIn these pandemic times, major events are of course cancelled, but when talking about what you can do in Solna under normal circumstances, you can't help but mention Friends Arena. Lots of big sports and music events are usually organised here. The photo below is from when we visited one. gala in the Friends Arena a few years ago.\n\n4. Strolling in Haga Park\n\nHaga Park in Solna is a wonderful place to stroll among castles, gazebos and pavilions from the time of Gustav III. Gustav III had the park built in the 18th century, and our current king, Carl XVI Gustaf, grew up in Haga Palace with his sisters. Today, Crown Princess Victoria and Daniel live in Haga Palace, and the palace and surrounding gardens are the only part of the park that feels private.\n\nIn Gustav III's time, it was fashionable to create 'English parks', which should feel natural and offer surprises at the same time. As you stroll around the green Haga Park, you will come across exciting buildings such as the Turkish kiosk and the Eco Temple. You'll also find Gustav III's pavilion from 1789 and the Copper Tents, now a café and inn.\n\n5. See exotic butterflies in the Haga Ocean Butterfly House.\n\nThe Haga Ocean Butterfly House is located in Haga Park, just behind the Copper Tents, not far from the northern gates of Haga. People come here to see exotic butterflies, among other things. You can expect to find at least 700 butterflies on the premises when you visit, and several thousand butterflies live here in a year.\n\nIn addition to butterflies, you can also see lizards, frogs, Chinese dwarf quail and various types of fish. Today there is also a 30 metre long aquarium with large sharks. Another reason to visit here, at least on a chilly and drizzly day, is that the daytime temperature never drops below 25 degrees.\n\n6. Check out the Olle Olsson Hagalund neighbourhood\n\nThe Olle Olsson Hagalund block is a museum block with a museum, café, workshops and artists' studios. The fine house was built in 1897 by master carpenter Carl Jakob Brolin. His son Conny Olsson and his wife also lived in the house and then their son, the artist Olle Olsson Hagalund, lived in the house all his life.\n\nOlle Olsson Hagalund Museum showcases an artist's home with original furnishings from when Olle Olsson lived here with his family. The block also hosts innovative programmes focusing on creativity, as well as guided city walks and bike tours. Please note that activities may be limited during the pandemic.\n\n7. Learn about film stars at Filmstaden Råsunda.\n\nFilmstaden Råsunda now serves as a cinema, although it is currently closed due to the pandemic. This used to be Sweden's Hollywood. Over 400 films were shot here, and the ground was trodden by celebrities such as Ingmar Bergman, Ingrid Bergman and Greta Garbo.\n\nLast year, 2020, Filmstaden celebrated the 100th anniversary of the opening of its premises. There is now an outdoor exhibition where you can read about film history from 1919-1920, when the land was bought from a former ostrich farm, to 1999 when the last film was shot. There is also a restaurant and waffle café in the area.\n\n8. Visit the Charlottenburg Heritage Centre\n\nCharlottenburg, located in the Vasalund neighbourhood, is Solna's homestead and local history museum. The museum is currently closed due to the pandemic, but according to the museum's website, guided walks with small groups are planned.\n\nThe farm, built in 1801, is now over 200 years old. The house was built by Adolf Fredrik Wijnblad, who owned both Frösunda and Brahelund farms and was the supervisor of several of Gustav III's construction projects in Hagparken. The farm was named after the builder's wife Charlotta. Outside the courtyard there is an old-fashioned garden with a monolith and a small park with an ancient burial ground from the early Iron Age (400-1050 AD).\n\n9. Explore the area around Karolinska Institutet and Hagastaden.\n\nThe area around Karolinska Institutet and Karolinska Hospital is of course mainly for those who research, study or work at the hospital or university. At the same time, this is an exciting area that is constantly changing, with many new buildings rising right next to the history. One example is Karolinska Institutet's futuristic Aula Medica (where you'll find a lunch restaurant) located just behind the old Tiondeladan.\n\nHagastaden is the name of a cross-border urban development project that includes both Stockholm and Solna. The area includes both Karolinska Hospital and the former railway yard for Stockholm's northern station, and will become a new neighbourhood. A lot is happening here!\n\n10.
