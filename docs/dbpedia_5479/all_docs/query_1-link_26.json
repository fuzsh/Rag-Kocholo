        "text": "Current Situation\n\nReports indicate that an increased security presence will be deployed in Stockholm from September 12-16 for the opening of the Riksdag, the Swedish parliament, and the King of Sweden Carl Gustaf Folke Hubertu’s 50th jubilee celebratory events.\n\nAccording to authorities, hundreds of police officers, as well as boats, UAVs, and helicopters, will be present in the city throughout the week. The security measures have been put in place in response to Sweden increasing the national terrorist threat level from ‘Elevated’, the third highest on a five-point scale, to ‘High’, the fourth highest on the same scale. ‘Level 4’ implies that the likelihood that actors have the intent and ability to carry out attacks is high. Authorities have stated that there is no intelligence surrounding a concrete threat to the events.\n\nAdditionally, authorities have called on residents to leave vehicles at their residences on September 16 due to traffic measures.\n\nOn September 12, the King will attend the opening ceremony of Riksdag beginning at 14:00 (local time).\n\nFurther, multiple jubilee celebratory events are slated to take place on September 13-16, including at the Kungliga Slottet, Kungliga Begravningsplatsen, Slottskyrkan, Skeppsholmen, and in the Yttre borggarden.\n\nAdditionally, on September 16, the King and Queen will travel through central Stockholm in a horse-drawn carriage. They will travel along Slottsbacken, Skeppsbron, Strombron, Kungstradgardsgatan, Hamngatan, Sveavagen, Tegnergatan, Birger Jarlsgatan, Nybroplan, and Nybrokajen. The procession will then move from Hovslagargatan where the King and Queen will travel over the Skeppsholmsbron Bridge and along Svensksundsvagen. The Royal Barge will then travel past Kastellholmen and across Stockholm Bay to the lower Logardstrappan steps below Kungliga Slottet.\n\nFollowing the procession, a public event, including a concert, in honor of the King will be held on Norrbro from 14:00-22:00. Additional details on events throughout the week can be found here.\n\nMultiple foreign dignitaries are anticipated to attend the events.\n\nAssessments & Forecast\n\nBased on authorities’ estimates, the procession on September 16 is anticipated to witness a turnout in the mid hundreds of thousands.\n\nGiven that authorities have stated there is no intelligence on a possible threat, the heightened security measures are in accordance with the raised terror threat level. With that, the risk of a large-scale coordinated attack remains limited. If an attack was to occur, it would likely stem from lone actors and be seen in the form of stabbings or vehicular ramming.\n\nSevere disruptions to pedestrian and vehicular traffic can be anticipated in the vicinity of the above-mentioned locations during the slated timings as well as throughout central Stockholm – especially in Gamla Stan. Several streets in central Stockholm are likely to be closed to vehicular traffic due to the celebratory events. Further, authorities are likely to implement security cordons and security checks at the event locations and other prominent locations in the city.\n\nAdditionally, considering that several events will be taking place in Stockholm, traffic to and from the city will be affected. Moreover, given that authorities have advised the public to leave vehicles at home, coupled with the anticipated number of participants, overcrowding on available public transportation is expected.\n\nRecommendations\n\nThose operating or residing in Stockholm on September 12-16 are advised to allot for travel-related disruptions in the vicinity of the above-mentioned locations due to the slated celebratory events.\n\nCOUNTRY RISK LEVEL Low\n\nAFFECTED AREA Stockholm, Sweden\n\nINCIDENT RISK LEVEL Low\n\nSTRENGTH OF SOURCE Confirmed\n\nCurrent Situation\n\nReports indicate that an increased security presence will be deployed in Stockholm from September 12-16 for the opening of the Riksdag, the Swedish parliament, and the King of Sweden Carl Gustaf Folke Hubertu’s 50th jubilee celebratory events.\n\nAccording to authorities, hundreds of police officers, as well as boats, UAVs, and helicopters, will be present in the city throughout the week.
