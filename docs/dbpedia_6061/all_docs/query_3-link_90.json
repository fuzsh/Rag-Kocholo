Well after almost a decade of playing it I decided to playthrough it\n\nonce again for nostalgia’s sake, and it got me thinking: Wouldn’t a remaster of this game be great?\n\nSo, within a few hours I had this.\n\nI’m still considering if this would be a worthwhile fan project to get into, but any help is always welcome - it would be a big project after all.\n\nEnjoy."
