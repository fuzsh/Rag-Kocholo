        "text": "NEW YORK, NY, July 19, 2005 - Atari, Inc. (Nasdaq: ATAR) today announced that its highly anticipated video game, Marc Ecko's Getting Up: Contents Under Pressure, will be a worldwide multi-platform Fall release. Already announced for the PlayStation®2 computer entertainment system and mobile platform by Glu Mobile, this unique action-adventure game will also be available for the Xbox® video game system from Microsoft and Windows.\n\nDeveloped by The Collective, Marc Ecko's Getting Up: Contents Under Pressure is a broad-based action-adventure inspired by graffiti's historically rich and diverse culture and is the culmination of seven years of story and character development by Marc Ecko, the visionary behind several of today's most respected youth lifestyle brands.\n\nSet in the city of New Radius, the game features a world where freedom of expression is suppressed and graffiti has been outlawed by a tyrannical government. In the game, players assume the role of Trane - voiced by hip-hop artist Talib Kweli - as they learn and master various graf skills in a journey from toy to legend. During their quest, players find themselves with an even greater burden - to use their high-wire graffiti talents to expose an oppressive mayor and rid the city of his stranglehold on New Radius.\n\n\"Marc Ecko's Getting Up: Contents Under Pressure brings an original vision and point of view to gaming,\" said Marc Metis, Senior Vice President of Marketing for Atari. \"With the Xbox and Windows versions now joining its PlayStation 2 and mobile counterparts, we look forward to bringing this experience to an even broader audience with the product's simultaneous worldwide launch.\"\n\nMarc Ecko's Getting Up: Contents Under Pressure promises a new genre of gameplay by combining urban navigation and vertical gameplay with graffiti, street combat and sneak. The game uses a thrilling graffiti-driven framework to tell its story of self-expression and the fight for creative freedom. A thug, an outcast, and a rebel, the game's protagonist, Trane, initially sets out to earn his street cred by getting his graffiti tag up throughout the politically oppressive city of New Radius only to find himself the unlikely leader of an urban revolution.\n\nAbout Marc Ecko Enterprises\n\nThe youngest member of the Council of Fashion Designers of America's board of directors, Marc Ecko is founder of *ecko unltd., the world famous rhino brand.
