Making your own characters saves you a fortune and is an easier sell because you can manipulate more without going through companies to \"get the okay\" for everything you want to do.\n\nBecause Tomb Raider is that game except you're not a man in a hat.\n\nNah, Tomb Raider is not that game at all.\n\nThere's like no puzzles or anything in the new games, maybe the old ones sure could be close.\n\nThat's a tough sell for games that need to hit mass market appeal to be profitable.

I'm sure the Lucasarts license, especially since it's under Disney, would be expensive as fuck now. Better to put that money go towards the game mechanics than a well detailed skin of Harrison Ford.\n\nAnd Disney meddles and limits devs way too much. Besides, licensed games are for the mobile space.\n\nn 2005, LucasArts announced a new Indiana Jones game for next-generation consoles. Originally scheduled for a release in 2007, the game saw constant delays as a result of internal struggles. Due to severe quality issues, it was decided to cancel the project in early 2009. Only externally developed versions for Wii, PS2, DS and PSP saw a release.\n\nWhen first shown, LucasArts highlighted Indiana Jones as their first game on Xbox 360 and PS3 – with a story written by George Lucas himself. Set in 1939, the player was going to visit locations such as San Francisco as well as \"the world's most sacred grounds\".\n\nhttps://www.unseen64.net/2009/08/04/indiana-jones-and-the-staff-of-kings-xbox-360-ps3-cancelled/\n\nwhat could have been. I really wanted this when i saw it in a magazine way back then.\n\nwhy pay Spielberg royalties when you can make your own characters?\n\nIf Disney's gaming division were still around I think it'd be more likely, but with them moving out of the industry its chance of happening is definitely lower.\n\nn 2005, LucasArts announced a new Indiana Jones game for next-generation consoles.

I really wanted this when i saw it in a magazine way back then.\n\nWow, that looks cool!\n\nIt's probably a combination of licensing and Indiana Jones not being a hot commodity at the moment.\n\nPersonally I'd like to see a new Indiana Jones game, since I find that time period more interesting than Uncharted's or Tomb Raider's. I'd want it to set itself apart in terms of gameplay too though.\n\nEdit: Oh yeah, I couldn't remember the name, but I played a lot of the Emperor's Tomb on Xbox.\n\nSo.... not like Uncharted and Tomb Raider at all, then?\n\nAlso, there was this:\n\nI meant more the puzzle/platform aspect from these games and actually going off finding these relics/tombs etc sort of like search through texts in the library/your dads notes to find somewhere to go and off you go, but watch out for Lao Che and his dodgy airplane service lol\n\nWas going to be a big AAA PS360 game,\n\ngot cancelled and they formed the PS2, wii game from what they had\n\nHaving played through the Wii version, I thought it was a good making for an Indiana Jones story. Gameplay was clunky, but as an Indy fan, liked the story progression, a lot.\n\nIf Disney's gaming division were still around I think it'd be more likely, but with them moving out of the industry its chance of happening is definitely lower.\n\nYeah but remember all the restrictions EA claimed to have with BF2 cosmetics? I'm sure LucasArts will still have a lot of say of what can and can't happen to Indy\n\nI meant more the puzzle/platform aspect from these games and actually going off finding these relics/tombs etc sort of like search through texts in the library/your dads notes to find somewhere to go and off you go, but watch out for Lao Che and his dodgy airplane service lol\n\nThat would be cool but the actual \"puzzle/platform\" sections of those games are pretty rudimentary, making a game that is mostly that would be pretty awful. And I say that as somebody who actually enjoys the new Tomb Raider games.\n\nI understand what you're getting at though, I just think those games aren't really a great base for the type of game you'd want. It would need to be more of a detective or archaeology kind of game, with the action about escaping danger more than it is about fighting tons of dudes."
