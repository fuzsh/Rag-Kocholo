        "text": "I saw the Raiders of the Lost Ark for the first time at age 14.\n\n16 years later, the Indy movies are still some of my favorites. The exotic locales, treasure hunting, action scenes, and Harrison's sarcasm meld together in a culmination of timeless entertainment.\n\nMy first Indy gaming experience was Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine, on PC.\n\nBoasting a well-written story and amazing graphics for it's time, Indy traverses much of the globe including Iraq, Egypt, Peru, Kazakhstan, the Philippines, New Mexico, and the Sudan.\n\n​My dreams of playing it again were crushed by the sad reality that it's not available digitally. It was a late 90's game, and is not really compatible with modern systems.\n\n(Once I find a physical copy, I'll find a way)\n\nEDIT- Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine IS finally available digitally- on GOG as well. Click here.\n\nIn the meantime, unable to play Infernal Machine and jonesing for more Indy, I began searching the web for other Indy titles, and found\n\none on gog.com (Good Old Games).\n\nIt was developed by The Collective, a studio I'd not heard of previously.\n\nThat made me nervous.\n\nWhen Disney bought out Lucasfilm, they also acquired it's subsidiaries, including Lucasarts.\n\nLucasarts was shut down on April 3rd, 2013.\n\nDisney cancelled all existing and future projects, and laid off most of their employees. Their reasoning? They wanted to \"minimize the company’s risk while achieving a broad portfolio of quality Star Wars games.”\n\nWhat a wasted opportunity.\n\nWith fond memories of Infernal Machine in mind, I prepared myself for disappointment and booted up Indiana Jones and the Emperor's Tomb.\n\nA 15 year-old game with a 6 dollar price tag. How good could it be?\n\nThe year is 1935. We find Indy in the jungles of Ceylon, Sri Lanka, where he is looking for the fabled idol of Kouru Watu.\n\nThis acts as a tutorial level of sorts, teaching the player to navigate traps, fight, and solve puzzles.\n\nIndy is voiced by David Esch this time around, and he actually sounds a lot like Harrison. The character model's detail is impressive for such an old game too-right down to Harrison's trademark chin scar.\n\nI quickly learned that this Indy game is a lot more action-oriented than Infernal Machine.\n\nIt takes a little time to get used to the PC controls, but they aren't bad once you've had a bit of practice.\n\nThe combat system is pretty cool.\n\nYou can brawl with your fists, put your enemy in a headlock, bash them over the head with a chair, whip a gun out of their hands, throw them over a cliff, you name it.\n\nYou'll encounter ivory hunters, a prehistoric crocodile, lots of treasure, and a stereotypical Nazi asshole who wants to steal Indy's new find for the Third Reich.\n\nAnd that's just the first level!\n\nYou'll whip, fight and puzzle your way through ten huge levels, each split up into 10 different stages.\n\n(I'd prefer to have a save option, but the game autosaves at the beginning of each new 'stage', which works well enough)\n\nEmperor's Tomb is very combat focused, but still has puzzles to solve and traps to dodge.\n\nThere are a ton of references to the films and lore throughout the game, and the material it borrows is just enough to feel at home with the movies.\n\nThe full motion video sequences showing travel between locations are great too.\n\nIdol in hand, Indy heads back to the University in New York.\n\nThere, he is visited by Chinese official Kai Ti Chan and his assistant Mei Ying.\n\nKai tells Indy about an ancient black pearl buried with the first Emperor of China, Qin Shi Huangdi. The artifact is said to grant great power to whoever wields it, and Marshall Kai asks Indy to get it before the Nazis do.\n\nOf course, Jones can't resist.\n\nYou'll visit 10 different locales across the globe.\n\n-Ceylon-\n\n-Prague-\n\n-Istanbul-\n\n-Hong Kong-\n\n-Peng Lai-\n\n-Siam-\n\n-The Netherworld-\n\nThere are some genuinely cool moments to be experienced, from a rickshaw gun battle on the streets of Hong Kong to a fistfight atop a moving cable car in Peng Lai.\n\nYou'll infiltrate a secret Nazi submarine base, use a mounted machine gun against divebombing attack planes, explore ancient tombs, a sinister old castle and more.\n\nI really don't have much to say about this game that isn't positive.\n\nMy only real gripes are:\n\n1. The camera is occasionally finicky when close to walls.\n\nScore:\n\n8.5/10"
