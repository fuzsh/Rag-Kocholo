        "text": "Gho,\n\nI use your Software DxWnd to play Indiana Jones and the Emperor's Tomb in fullscreen at my Desktop resolution. I can not finish the first level because the game crashes before I could finish it. The crash could happen the first minutes or more, there are no rules. It happened at any time when I click on the right mouse button (attack 2), even if most of the time this button works correctly. I joined you the logs in case you will find something interesting.\n\nThank you for your help.\n\nThe log is puzzling me: it's 164 MB of text where most of it is a regular sequence of screen updates through a D3D8 device:\n\nClear: d3d=1a1438 count=0 flags=7 color=ff174911 Z=1.000000 stencil=0 Device::BeginScene(8): d3dd=1a1438 SetViewport: orig=(0,0) size=(1144x530) z(min:max)=(0.000000:1.000000) ... Device::EndScene(8): d3dd=1a1438 Present(8): d3dd=1a1438 SourceRect=(NULL) DestRect=(NULL) hDestWndOverride=0 dirtyregion=0\n\nthen, suddently (I presume when you click on mouse button 2) something weird happens:\n\nfirst the creation of a new Direct3D8Device object with a strange iteration\n\nIDirect3D8::Release: ref=1 CreateDevice(8): lpd3d=1ae7c8 adapter=0 hFocusWnd=4011e behavior=54(D3DCREATE_MULTITHREADED+PUREDEVICE+HARDWARE_VERTEXPROCESSING), size=(1280,960) CreateDevice(8): lpd3d=1ae7c8 adapter=0 hFocusWnd=4011e behavior=54(D3DCREATE_MULTITHREADED+PUREDEVICE+HARDWARE_VERTEXPROCESSING), size=(1280,960) .... CreateDevice(8): lpd3d=1ae7c8 adapter=0 hFocusWnd=4011e behavior=54(D3DCREATE_MULTITHREADED+PUREDEVICE+HARDWARE_VERTEXPROCESSING), size=(1280,960) CreateDevice(8): lpd3d=1ae7c8 adapter=0 hFocusWnd=4011e behavior=54(D3DCREATE_MULTITHREADED+PUREDEVICE+HARDWARE_VERTEXPROCESSING), size=(1280,960) CreateDevice(8): lpd3d=1ae7c8 adapter=0 hFocusWnd=4011e behavior=54(D3DCREATE_MULTITHREADED+PUREDEVICE+HARDWARE_VERTEXPROCESSING), size=(1280,960) CreateDevice(8): lpd3d=1ae7c8 adapter=0 hFocusWnd=4011e behavior=54(D3DCREATE_MULTITHREADED+PUREDEVICE+HARDWARE_VERTEXPROCESSING), size=(1280,960) CreateDevice(8): lpd3d=1ae7c8 adapter=0 hFocusWnd=4011e behavior=54(D3DCREATE_MULTITHREADED+PUREDEVICE+HARDWARE_VERTEXPROCESSING), size=(1280,960) D3D8::CreateDevice Adapter = 0 DeviceType = 1 hFocusWindow = 0x4011e BehaviorFlags = 0x54(D3DCREATE_MULTITHREADED+PUREDEVICE+HARDWARE_VERTEXPROCESSING) BackBufferWidth = 1280 BackBufferHeight = 960 BackBufferFormat = 22(X8R8G8B8) BackBufferCount = 0 MultiSampleType = 0 SwapEffect = 0x1(DISCARD) hDeviceWindow = 0x0 Windowed = 0 EnableAutoDepthStencil = 1 AutoDepthStencilFormat = 75 Flags = 0x0 FullScreen_RefreshRateInHz = 0 PresentationInterval = 0x1 Virtual Pixel Format bpp=32 RGBAmask=(ff0000.ff00.ff.ff000000) Current Format = 22(X8R8G8B8) Current ScreenSize = (1920x1080) Current Refresh Rate = 60 D3D::QueryInterface(8): d3d=386de30 riid=b4211cfa(IID_IDirect3DBaseTexture8) D3D::QueryInterface(8): d3d=386de30 riid=b4211cfa(IID_IDirect3DBaseTexture8) D3D::QueryInterface(8): d3d=386de30 riid=b4211cfa(IID_IDirect3DBaseTexture8) SUCCESS! device=386de30\n\nthen, again a long sequence of identical operations\n\nGetDisplayMode(8): size=(1920x1080) RefreshRate=60 Format=22 GetDisplayMode(8): fixed size=(1440x1080)\n\nand after that a new creation of a Device object that starts creating a mess: after that DxWnd loses control of the situation and starts to believe that the virtual desktop has 0x0 size!!!\n\nThese logs show it:\n\nGetDisplayMode(8): size=(1920x1080) RefreshRate=60 Format=22 GetDisplayMode(8): fixed size=(0x0)\n\nthen\n\nGetDisplayMode(8): size=(1920x1080) RefreshRate=60 Format=22 GetDisplayMode(8): fixed size=(160x24)\n\nIn the end, after so many crazy operations, the game surrends after having lost all memory resources:\n\nD3D::QueryInterface(8): d3d=3f82368 riid=b4211cfa(IID_IDirect3DBaseTexture8) FAILED! err=8007000e(DDERR_OUTOFMEMORY)\n\nSuch a weird situation could be explained by some vicious recursion caused by DxWnd hooking, a thing that may easily happen when playing with pointers, though I can't see why that should happen randomly every now and then. It is not an easy thing to manage, but hopefully it could be a problem in the Windows environment as well so that I could replicate the problem and fix it by myself. I'll try ...\n\nThe only thing that comes to my mind that was changed in 2.05.22 is the CommandLine settings, that was NULL up to 2.05.20, set to the game path in 2.05.22 and made configurable (defaulted to NULL but possibly set to game path) in 2.05.23 - a release still W.I.P.\n\nI would try to send you a working beta, you just have NOT to set the new \"Hook / Set command line\" flag. Also the help page was updated, so you can read some explaination.\n\nP.s. this is the version that I started to test with Wine / Linux. So far (after very limited testing) I found two problems:\n\n1) the game icons often get scrambled (assigned to the wrong game entry!)\n\n2) \"Debug\" and \"Inject suspended\" hook mode can't work"
