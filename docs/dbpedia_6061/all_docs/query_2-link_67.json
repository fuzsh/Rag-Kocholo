        "text": "Source that Disney meddles and limits the devs?\n\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2016/05/11/why-disney-unexpectedly-quite-the-video-game-business.html\n\nPeople who have worked at the company also point privately to Disney's internal politics as an issue that held the video game business back. Stakeholders in various divisions have often been unwilling to trust game developers with the properties or characters and, in turn, have micromanaged the game-making process or insisted on last-minute changes, unaware of the time those demands required. That, in turn stretched development times (raising costs) and often resulted in a less-than-optimal title.\n\nA Disney representative disputed those claims, pointing to the successful collaboration between the developers of \"Disney Infinity\" and the Walt Disney World, Marvel and Lucasfilm divisions as an example.\n\nAnd Disney by extension of LucasArts:\n\nhttps://kotaku.com/how-lucasarts-fell-apart-1401731043\n\nBut the goal posts kept moving, ex-team members say. Every so often, Lucas would check in with the team, and as he grew to trust the staff behind 1313, he'd allow them more access to his universe, which really meant he'd ask them to switch characters and rewrite the story based on what he felt would be more fitting for the game. Ex-LucasArts staff describe Lucas as someone who cared deeply about telling stories, but didn't know much about the game development process—every Lucas-mandated story change meant shifts in every department: the design, the art, the programming. How could that not be frustrating?\n\n\"One of the problems of working in a film company—[Lucas] is used to being able to change his mind,\" said one source. \"He didn't really have a capacity for understanding how damaging and difficult to deal with these changes were.\"\n\nLucasfilm executives meddling with development visions was a common theme at LucasArts for much of its existence, according to people who worked there. It was always a problem. One of the most prominent examples of this came in the spring of 2012, just eight weeks before E3, when George Lucas dropped a bombshell: instead of starring a generic bounty hunter, 1313 would be helmed by the iconic mercenary Boba Fett.\n\nSome staffers tried to push back—they'd spent over two years working with an entirely different vision—but Lucas and his team of executives wouldn't reconsider. They wanted a game with Boba in it. On top of that, according to two people familiar with the project, 1313's developers were prohibited from talking about the new hero. When the devs revealed the game and started taking interviews during E3 2012, they had to pretend that 1313 starred a generic bounty hunter. Boba Fett was potentially one of the game's biggest selling points, but executives inexplicably wanted it kept secret.\n\nThen, in September, everything changed. Lucasfilm enacted a hiring freeze, according to four people who were there at the time. All marketing plans were halted, and the company went into silent mode. Production continued on Star Wars 1313, but without the capacity to continue hiring the staff they needed, the team was crippled. Morale sunk quickly.\n\nThen, following direction from executives at LucasFilm, the game moved back to the Clone War era. This was a common theme at LucasArts, sources say— First Assault, which was code-named Trigger, shifted and evolved because of ever-changing direction, just like 1313. The goal posts just kept moving.\n\nAnd Disney by extension of Marvel\n\nhttp://comicbook.com/gaming/2017/06/27/marvel-vs-capcom-infinite-no-x-men-fans-forgotten-them/\n\n\"We talked with Marvel very closely about their future roadmap, about what's gonna be happening. Your modern Marvel fan, maybe they don't even remember some of the X-Men characters, but they know some of the Guardians characters or Black Panther. You know what I mean? Captain Marvel may seem like a strange pick, but she's fantastic. She fits the gameplay. She fits the story, and they're gonna be really pushing her as a strong female lead all the way up into the movie. We're trying to take everything into account and choose the best characters.\"\n\nI'm pretty sure Marvel fans still remember who the X-Men are. Does Capcom think the people who watch the Avengers and Captain America movies are completely separate from the people who watched Deadpool and Logan? I can assure you, they're not.\n\nHoo boy. Listen, I don't expect Capcom to come out and say, \"we don't have X-Men this time because Marvel is cranky about Fox owning the movie rights,\" but maybe a simple \"no comment\" would have been better than these ham-handed explanations."
