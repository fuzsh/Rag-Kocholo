        "text": "Just posting this for anyone that is unaware that this title on the Store, its a gem.\n\nI was just idly browsing when I came across this game, only £9 so I took a chance. Pleasantly surprised, for a game that's 18 years old, it looks great on the Series X. The controls are clunky by todays standards but once you master those, this is a terrific Indiana Jones game! Much in the same vain as Tomb Raider, but what really sets them apart is the main character, Indiana is superbly designed and voice acted and the in-game soundtrack just leaves you in no doubt your playing an Indiana Jones game!\n\nYou might be thinking why pay 500 for a latest tech console to play 18 year old games lol, but this game in my opinion is better than a lot of modern games, it takes gaming back to a time when games felt like, just a game. Now a days, realism is taking over from bare bones fun. Anyway rant over lol\n\nIf you've never played it and you like old school Tomb Raider type gameplay, you can't go far wrong with Indiana Jones and the Emperor's Tomb.\n\nI'm loving it"
