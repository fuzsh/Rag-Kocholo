        "text": "Just got Indiana Jones and the Emperor's Tomb, and I'm kinda disheartened at the way it plays..jerky and too fast. My favorite Indy game was the Infernal Machine(abeit it's gameplay was too slow). If you remember in the Infernal Machine, it took him a while to turn, and he ran like he had a serious cramp in his backside, and enemies were tough because he moved so clunkily(that ain't a word :p ) Well, now it looks like Lucasarts heard the complaints and decided to make Indy climb walls faster, run really fast, and turn on a dime..but, it's a little too fast, at least for me. The game seems to go at a frantic pace when confronting enemies, but then you still have to solve puzzles in the temples..and the whole feel of the game is too fast for this genre. It's turned into an arcade game(thanks to consoles) and has lost it's old contemplative appeal. Have you tried to make Indy swim? He moves like a dolphin on steroids! He's so fast you run into a wall before you have a chance to move the mouse a different direction! This would be a great game if it could just slow down a bit, freaks me out..\n\nthe infernal machine would get a little too slow though, remember when you have to change weapons? The method: stop, stand a second, change weapon, shoot, run, stop, stand a while, shoot, put weapon away, crouch, move, you know what I mean. I just wish Lucasarts could have found a happy medium between the two, cuz now I feel the whole Indiana jones game series has been cheapened. I want across between exploration and adventure...cuz Emperor's Tomb sucks for exploration... -my thoughts.\n\n/edit- also the emperor's tomb has a frame lock of 30 fps..which explains why I thought it was jerky..found it out in fraps.."
