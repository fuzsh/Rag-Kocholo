I need to read the Licence Agreement to see what it says about editing.\n\nIf it does allow it, no doubt I'll be into it. Otherwise I'll just stick with JO for the time being.\n\nLicense Agreenment\n\nThe computer software, artwork, and other components included in this product, as such may be updated, are the copyrighted property of Lucasarts and or other appfiliates.

Calm down.\n\n> [from the Emperor's Tomb manual] ...(4) [you may not] design or distribute unauthorized levels (6) ...\n\n> this is said in the Jedi Outcast manuel too\n\nNo. Nothing of the sort is said in the Jedi Outcast manual.\n\nThe Jedi Outcast manual has an entire page dedicated to instructions on rules for making mods and/or levels (page 49).\n\nWithout permission to mod the game given, there will be no modding community and no support networks. There will also be no toolkits released.\n\nYou may find a few underground communities who make some mods, but I don't give you much hope when there are so many game engines out there with editing communities and software company toolkit support.\n\nRight. Back to skinning Jedi Outcast models.\n\nthere is a petition as of right now at\n\nhttp://www.theraider.net/theraven/showthread.php?threadid=3485&pagenumber=4\n\nto get Indiana Jones and The Emperor's Tomb editable\n\nhere is what it says\n\n\"Dear LucasArts Entertainment Company / The Collective,\n\nMany Indy and action game fans have been delighted by the excellent 'Indiana Jones And The Emperor's Tomb', but many also feel that the game deserves to have the editing tools released via the Internet.\n\nIdeally this would let fans of the game work on building new levels, perhaps even new enemy models, cut-scenes, weapons, animations, etc., and implement them into the game.\n\nOther games, including previous LucasArts games (probably most notably 'Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast'), are easily editable and have consequently developed huge Internet followings.\n\nThis would build up a stronger fanbase for the game, and allow people to enjoy it for longer. Without the likely prospect of an add-on or sequel in the near future with numerous other games currently in progress, Indy gaming will otherwise dry up once again.\"\n\nSIGN!!!\n\nInvid_Clone you said:\n\nOk...I'm considering getting the game (Xbox version). Is it good? Is it worth dishing out the $50? Or is it better as a renatl? Honest answers please.\n\nPicked it Emperor's Tomb for PC last week and ever since I've been HOOKED! Lot more action-oriented and not as puzzle-intensive as Infernal Machine was: in IM it was a smart thing to use guns, bazookas etc. to fight enemies, rarely fists. In Emperor's Tomb you GOT to fight with your fists... and it's a fraggin' lotta fun too! Think my favorite tactic is to hit the Nazis upside the head with whatever chairs are laying around\n\nDon't rent it, dude. If you're reading this at this hour, do a late-night run to Wal-Mart and don't leave 'til the game's in your grubby little paws. Trust me you'll be glad you did\n\nI can't vouch for the XBox version, but I'll assume it's pretty much the same as the PC version.\n\nBasically, if you love Indy, get this game. I love Indy, I also like great games. There's just one thing I don't like about\n\nthis game, but I've beeen enjoying it anyway.\n\nDo yourself a favor, don't ever get too close to a wall/corner when fighting! The camera is a pain, but that's pretty much true in any game\n\nAnd (obviously) explore everywhere! There's a ton of bonus treasures to find that unlock a special something at the end. sadly, I've missed a couple already so I'll be hunting for a cheat once I finish\n\nOverall, it's been great fun so far! The cinematic brawling rocks!\n\nI just started playing this game this morning and I love it! I agree about the camera thing though, but I did notice that if you move it slowly enough, you can get it right behind Indy and they made him see through when you do that so he doesn't get in the way. Yay, someone finally did that right!\n\nIf you go into the Emperor's Tomb folder then Gamedata then indy there are two files named\n\nRopeTest\n\nand\n\nwhipGym\n\nopen these files with the Emperors Tomb.exe\n\nand you get to play a rope testing level and a whip gym level\n\npretty cool\n\nI hope I will be able to play more new levels\n\nbut that can only happen if you sign the petition\n\nplease sign!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nhttp://www.petitiononline.com/IndyEdit/petition.html\n\nConsidering you prefaced your petition spam with something useful and intersting, you'll live to see another post. BUT do you understand we are sick of seeing mention of your petition? You have mentioned it six times on this page in separate posts already.\n\nThat is ENOUGH. We know your petition exists, and if any of gave a hoot, we'd have signed it already.\n\nDo you understand?\n\nSTOP spamming this thread with links to your petition.\n\nPlease."
