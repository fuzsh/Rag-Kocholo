        "text": "A new Indiana Jones adventure is coming to Xbox and PC platforms this year.\n\nA new Indiana Jones game has formerly been revealed, in development from the Swedish MachineGames with collaboration by Lucasfilm Games.\n\nIndiana Jones and the Great Circle will release in 2024 for Xbox Series X|S, PC and Xbox Game Pass with day-one availability on Microsoft’s subscription platform. The game will also be available on Steam. Microsoft showed the game off during its “Developer_Direct” streaming presentation on Thursday. The game was first revealed to be in development in January 2021. It now has a name, many details and a release window, although an official release date wasn’t announced.\n\nIndiana Jones and the Great Circle will primarily feature first-person gameplay in the action adventure genre. The first-person perspective was chosen by MachineGames to give players the experience of being Indiana Jones, seeing and feeling what the character goes through. The game will switch to a third-person perspective that shows Indiana during cut-scenes or when performing gameplay actions like climbing. The studio stated that the gameplay will focus on stealth, exploration, action and combat with a cinematic movie experience like the Indiana Jones films.\n\nIndiana Jones and the Great Circle takes place in 1937. The story happens between the events of the first movie Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981) and the third film Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989). In the game, Indiana must uncover the secrets behind an ancient power called the Great Circle that connects many of the world’s greatest locations and architecture. Some evil forces are also chasing after the power of the Great Circle so it’s up to Indiana to stop them.\n\nThe game will feature locations from around the world like the Vatican in Rome, Egypt and its pyramids, the temples of Sukhothai in Thailand and the snowy Himalayas. In the game’s reveal trailer shown as part of the Developer_Direct, Indiana talks about the significance of the Great Circle. “Throughout history, mankind has built sites of great spiritual significance. If you were to draw a line through these ancient sites around the globe, you get a perfectly aligned circle.”\n\nThe game features the likeness of a young Harrison Ford, who plays Indiana Jones in the movie franchise. The voice behind Indiana is Troy Baker, the prolific actor known for his game roles like Joel in The Last of Us series. A second protagonist in the game, an investigative journalist named Gina Lombardi with a personal connection to the Great Circle, will assist Indiana on his adventure. Gina is voiced by actress Alessandra Mastronardi from 2022’s The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent. Tony Todd from Candyman fame will also be in the game as a menacing character named Locus. He breaks into the Marshall College museum at night to steal an artifact when Indiana confronts him. The artifact first appears to not have much significance but Indiana later learns it has importance to his journey.\n\nThe gameplay trailer starts by showing Indiana trapped in the sands of Africa, face-to-face with the game’s main antagonist Emmerich Voss who is also after the power behind the Great Circle. The trailer goes on to show Indiana exploring different settings, solving puzzles and fighting enemies. Near the end of the trailer Indiana jumps from one small plane to another that’s flying low through a war-torn city.\n\nThe game will feature Indiana’s signature whip for different aspects of the game, including in melee combat, exploration and moving through environments. Enemies can be attacked and disarmed with Indy’s whip. The whip will be a key focus of the gameplay experience. Combat will also include shooting guns, using environmental weapons and fist fights.\n\nIndiana Jones and the Great Circle will have different ways for players to advance through an area. Like the movies, players will need to avoid traps and safely maneuver around enemies. Another key feature taken from the movies is there will be a lot of puzzles to solve, many of them being optional off the main path. MachineGames also teased there being plenty of secrets to find throughout the story.\n\nThe game’s music comes from Gordy Haab, a Grammy-nominated and award-winning composer known for his work in Halo Wars 2 (2017), the recent Star Wars Battlefront games (2015-18) and the Star Wars Jedi series (2019-23) from Electronic Arts. Indiana Jones’ signature theme is featured throughout the reveal trailer. Indiana Jones and the Great Circle‘s action scenes are filmed with stunt actors for more authenticity, which are then put into the game.\n\nThe Swedish-based MachineGames is known for its revival of the first-person shooter series Wolfenstein. The studio released Wolfenstein: The New Order in 2014, with the fourth game being the virtual reality title Wolfenstein: Cyberpilot in July 2019. Some of the team at MachineGames have licensed, first-person game expertise as well. Games like The Darkness (2007) and two The Chronicles of Riddick games (2004-2009) were developed while founding members of MachineGames were formerly at Starbreeze Studios before starting their new company.\n\nIndiana Jones and the Great Circle will be published by Bethesda Softworks, who Microsoft acquired in March 2021 as part of ZeniMax Media for $7.5 billion. MachineGames formed in 2009 and in 2010 were acquired by ZeniMax Media.\n\nTodd Howard, game director and executive producer of Bethesda Game Studios, is the executive producer on Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. Howard, a big Indiana Jones fan, first pitched a game on the franchise to Lucasfilm in 2009 that ultimately wasn’t made. This Indiana Jones game is based on an original idea from Howard about the Great Circle concept that got the green light from Lucasfilm Games. Howard took his plan to MachineGames as he felt they were the perfect team to develop the title.\n\nThe Indiana Jones franchise started in June 1981 with Raiders of the Lost Ark and its popularity led to four more movies. The latest movie released in June 2023 called Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, which was directed by James Mangold. The movie wasn’t successful at the box office though and was estimated to have lost $100 million. Disney now owns the rights to the franchise after purchasing Lucasfilm in 2012.\n\nThere have been many games based on the Indiana Jones franchise over the past four decades. The last game with an original storyline called Indiana Jones and the Staff of Kings released in June 2009 for the PlayStation 2, Nintendo Wii, PlayStation Portable and Nintendo DS. Haab also composed the music for that game. Another previous third-person game called Indiana Jones and the Emperor’s Tomb released in 2003 for the original Xbox, PS2 and PC. This game is also backwards compatible on Xbox One and Xbox Series X|S consoles. The last release for consoles was LEGO Indiana Jones 2: The Adventure Continues in November 2009. The first ever Indiana Jones game, based on Raiders of the Lost Ark, released for the Atari 2600 in 1982.\n\nWatch the reveal trailer for Indiana Jones and the Great Circle:"
