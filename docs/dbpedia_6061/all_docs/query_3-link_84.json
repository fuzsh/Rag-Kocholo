        "text": "In the midst of the exciting title and teaser trailer reveal for Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny comes news about the franchise’s Bethesda game, which has been mostly mum since its teaser trailer dropped in early 2021. Jens Andersson (The Darkness, Chronicles of Riddick) has taken to Twitter to reveal he has joined the project as design director.\n\nInterestingly, Andersson’s Tweet reveals that during his time at LucasArts in 2009, he was supposed to, “lead the design on an Indiana Jones game, but that game got cancelled before [he] even got there.” This partnership was simply meant to be! The director joins multiple Starbreeze Studios veterans, the independent Swedish video game developer responsible for The Chronicles of Riddick: Escape from Butcher Bay, Payday 2 and Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons who previously joined MachineGames. Of his fellow creatives, Andersson adds, \"Now, I get a chance to do what I originally hoped to, but this time I get to do it with some of my oldest and best friends.\"\n\nThe untitled Jones game will be executive produced by Todd Howard, in collaboration with Lucasfilm Games and Bethesda’s MachineGames studio. While there is yet to be any hint of a plot, there is speculation the game will be Xbox exclusive, as Bethesda was acquired by Microsoft in 2020. As fans of LucasArts’ 2003 Indiana Jones and the Emperor’s Tomb for the original Xbox, we can’t wait!"
