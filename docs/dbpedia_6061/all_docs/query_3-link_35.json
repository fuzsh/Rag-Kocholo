        "text": "Lightfall is upon us, inevitable server issues notwithstanding, and while waiting for Destiny 2 to occupy my days once more, I’ve used the last week to replay an unsung gem of the late 90s: Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine. Unfairly maligned in its day for not being an adventure like Fate of Atlantis, it is nonetheless a great game that showed that developers at Lucasarts weren’t content with any old licensed drivel. And to be honest, I could spend days just gushing over the environments.\n\nThe old Tomb Raider, celebrated as it may have been, I’ve always found drab and lifeless. Okay, maybe lifeless is right, you were raiding tombs after all. But surely Lara Croft herself would get tired of the same old brown and grey eventually. The sequels would introduce a bit more color and variation, but ultimately the palette always strived for a sort of realism, well, as realistic as you could get with people transformed into dragons by old daggers anyway. Venice (despite completing TR1, that was as far as I could get in TR2 before giving up) wasn’t a carnival of 256 colors, it was about what you’d expect from old stone and bricks.\n\nHowever, Indiana Jones famously doesn’t believe in the supernatural, hence he’s not bound by such wild concepts as realism. And it shows in the colors of the places he visits throughout his adventure. Lava is a searing reddish hue, and the vapors are as ambient temperature as you’d expect from a Hollywood-inspired videogame. Sand is not vaguely beige, but a most brilliant mix of yellow and orange. Water is not just transparent like in real life, but a torrent of azure. With colors like these, who needs realism?\n\nThe Infernal Machine was mockingly called a Tomb Raider clone back then. Perhaps it is so, though I’d argue that Lara Croft was directly inspired by Indy, so it’s merely a full circle. You gotta wonder where the circle goes now, since the new Tomb Raider has been inspired by Uncharted instead… what will the upcoming Indiana Jones game do this time? Clone Uncharted as well? It might, and perhaps it won’t be so bad.\n\nClones have always had a bad reputation in games. Remember the “Doom clones” of its era? Following a leader denotes a lack of originality on your own part, or so goes the idea. But some of the best games around have been directly inspired by other, perhaps more famous titles. I’ve already said that I think Infernal Machine is better than the Tomb Raider games it so obviously copied, but there are so many other cases where a clone can stand perfectly well on its own. Resident Evil is sci-fi Alone in the Dark with zombies. Serious Sam is Doom with more enemies and an adventure setting.\n\nThe idea, I guess, is that a clone will need to have at least some element of differentiation, and so will usually introduce a gimmick. When we are lucky, this one different element is what wins the day. Unfortunately the rise of mobile gaming seems to have given birth to an entirely different idea of clone, one where games are exactly always the same. There is only so much you can do with the match-3 formula, I guess.\n\nEven if the new Indiana Jones game ends up being another riff on Uncharted, I have faith that it could stand well on its own. Sometimes, as Henry Jones said, you must believe.\n\nAs I previously found out, Emperor’s Tomb was a pretty decent Indiana Jones experience, but a terrible game all around. It’s a little weird how Lucasarts, who should have gotten action games better than anyone, could never make a proper Indiana Jones action game. After all, that’s what his character is all about. Staff of Kings doesn’t quite fit the bill, but it’s a better effort than most.\n\nWell, the PSP version is, at least. From what I gather, the PS2/Wii version is entirely different. This is probably not a bad thing though, since this new gameplay style employed is very good for portable play. Levels are very short, you usually have to fight a few enemies while collecting treasure and trying to understand how to finish the level (which is often very obvious). As an extra incentive, there are achievements you can gain which let you upgrade Indy’s stats or buy concept art or even cheats. It’s a decent package overall.\n\nThe combat is somewhat button-mashy, but there are a few niggles added here and there which help spice it up. You can throw enemies into enviroment obstacles, which is an instant kill (think Sleeping Dogs, but before that game came out). Combos allow you to stun them momentarily, and breakable objects deal extra damage. In some cases, objects dropped by enemies are necessary to solve some puzzles, in which case they won’t break.\n\nThe story is somewhat weak, as Indy travels around the world for seemingly no coherent reason. Gotta find some mirror shards? Not sure why. It gets more focused later on, but it’s always a bit weak. Indiana Jones also comes off as a bit of a dick here. Jokes are everywhere, even when they don’t make sense. Can’t have everything, I guess.\n\nWell, the combat does get repetitive, and I didn’t die a whole lot, but it’s a decent game as a whole. Certainly better than Emperor’s Tomb, but I realize that’s not saying much. Perhaps, with Disney now at the helm, there will come a day when we’ll get another Indiana Jones game. Since Infernal Machine was a Tomb Raider clone, this time I could see it being an Uncharted clone. Which in itself was sort of a Tomb Raider spinoff, which then was copies by the new Tomb Raider. And so the circle is closed.\n\nAs you might know, GOG has been releasing a bunch of old Lucasarts games lately. Their latest wave came out yesterday, and included masterpieces such as Loom (TM) and some other stuff not made by Brian Moriarty. It also included Indiana Jones and the Emperor’s Tomb, a title I had somehow missed on release. Of course, as a massive Indy fan, I just had to repair my foolishness.\n\nWhat a massive disappointment. I played about 4-5 hours before giving up. There are too many issues to lisst them all, but two are especially glaring: the save system and the camera.\n\nThe save system belongs in a museum. Each of the game’s (massive) areas is divided in smaller levels, although each level can still take up to 20 minutes to complete. You can only save at the beginning of each level. So if you mistime a jump and die, which will happen often because of the imprecise controls, you’ll be playing a rerun of the last Indy episode.\n\nThe combat doesn’t help, since it takes so long to beat any enemy. The fisticuffs is quite exciting, the first time around. Then it gets tiring. Especially if you are replaying a level.\n\nThe second big problem is the camera. The smallest mouse movement will often send it flying everywhere, no matter the sensitivity. This makes it both hard to time jumps, and also gives me motion sickness. Perhaps as an answer to the complaints that Indy moved too slowly in Infernal Machine, this time our favorite achaeologist zips around as if he were constantly on steroids, like Duke Nukem. Even the merest of actions has a jerky and lighting-fast animation, and if you are like me, nausea will set in soon.\n\nI gave up after a mistimed jump near the end of area 3-1, lacking the courage to replay the whole section again. I doubt I’ll be missing much: the plot seemed real thin anyway. At least it looked and sounded decent, but that’s not nearly enough.\n\nI’ll be sticking to Infernal Machine for my Indiana Jones needs. When I’m not watching the movies, I mean. However, I would also like to pick up Staff of Kings at some point. Perhaps I can find the PSP version for cheap enough someday. It didn’t receive a great critical reception, but as long as it has proper checkpoints, I will deal with it better than this."
