That sounds retarded and makes no sense.\n\n<3sRichardSimmons\n\nArcane\n\nJoined\n\nFeb 28, 2011\n\nMessages\n\n4,145\n\nLocation\n\nChicago, IL, Kwa\n\nJan 12, 2021\n\n#19\n\nI can see Harrison Ford coming out on Bethesda stage at E3 in 2022 announcing breathtaking Jones and SW game.\n\nI think Harrison Ford's general disgust for all things fan-boy is well-known enough at this point that Bethesda would not pay him the millions of dollars he would ask for in order to that.\n\nThat said, I like Indiana Jones probably the most out of any major film franchise (obviously excluding Crystal Skull), and it's hard to not get a little hyped at the prospect of a AAA Indy game in 2020. Kind of bonkers that there hasn't been one made in any of the last 2 console generations. Seems like just leaving money on the table.\n\ndeuxhero\n\nArcane\n\nJoined\n\nJul 30, 2007\n\nMessages\n\n11,716\n\nLocation\n\nFlowery Land\n\nJan 12, 2021\n\n#20\n\nMesopotamia?

The fact is, Todd is the most trusted and respected name in the business these days. You all owe him an apology.\n\nJoined\n\nSep 5, 2020\n\nMessages\n\n1,258\n\nLocation\n\nGermania\n\nJan 12, 2021\n\n#24\n\n>Indiana Jones\n\n>Todd Howard\n\nSo Skyrim with whips and fedoras."
