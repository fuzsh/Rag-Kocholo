        "text": "On October 31st, all students are welcomed to wear costumes and participate in the Halloween Parade. Additionally, JK-Grade 3 students will participate in classroom/divisional activities during the middle block (e.g., individual classroom activities, dance in the gym), and Grade 4-8 students will participate in classroom/divisional activities during the last block of the day.\n\nWhen deciding if a costume is appropriate for school, please remember students cannot wear a mask (other than during the parade), and costumes cannot contain weapons. Additional guiding questions from our Equity and Diversity Department are:\n\n1. Are you using makeup to alter your natural skin tone? Such uses of makeup cannot be separated from their historical context.\n\n2. Does the name of your costume include an ethnicity in the title? These are caricatures of a group of people, not costumes.\n\n3. Are you wearing clothing that is clearly from a culture not your own? Wearing regalia that belongs to another culture is appropriation. Wearing a culture is not a fashion statement. There is a fine line between appreciation and appropriation.\n\n4. Are you dressed as an offensive historical figure? Dressing as offensive historical figures can be construed as glorification, even if your costume is meant to be satirical.\n\n5. Is your costume “funny” because it mocks the real-life experiences of others? Belittling the struggles of marginalized groups is never okay.\n\n6. Does your costume reinforce binary notions of gender? Gender is part of people’s diverse identities and not a costume.\n\n7. Does your costume mock diverse abilities? Diverse abilities are not costumes.\n\n8. Is your costume offensive? Answer “yes” to any of the aforementioned questions, and it likely is. If your costume raises any of these red flags, you should reconsider wearing it.\n\nStudents who wish not to participate in the divisional-wide Halloween activities (e.g., dance) will be provided an alternate space.\n\nIf you would like your child to bring treats for the classroom, please remember they MUST be free of any nuts.\n\nWe are excited to offer a grade 4-8 ski trip to Batawa Ski Hill on Thursday, January 11th. Batawa Ski Hill can accommodate up to 40 students on a first-come basis. If your child cannot attend this day or the spaces are full, additional days will be on Wednesday, February 21st and Thursday, March 7th.\n\nFamilies will have to arrange their transportation to and from the hill. The drop-off time is 8:30 am, and the pickup time is 4:00 pm.\n\nThe cost per student is as follows:\n\nFull ski package ($56), lift, lesson & rental\n\nFull snowboard package ($56), lift, lesson & rental\n\nLift ticket and lesson only ($33.25)\n\nLesson only ($18.75) have their own Season Pass (not Night Pass) & Gear\n\nHelmet only ($7.25)\n\nPermission forms are coming home with interested students today. If you wish for your child to participate in this trip, please complete the official permission and rental forms (if needed). All forms and payments must be received by Wednesday, December 20th, for the Thursday, January 11th trip. Forms and payments for the February and/or March trip will be sent home after the Winter Break.\n\nSTSCO\n\nAttention Families:\n\nStarting for the 2024-2025 School Year, STSCO is introducing a new “opt-in” program that will require parents/guardians to confirm their children’s intent to ride the school bus if they are eligible for transportation. We realize that some families who are eligible for transportation may not use the school bus system and the purpose of this new program is to allow STSCO to plan more efficient bus routes for only the students who will be using the service.\n\nThe Opt-in process is relatively easy. If you already have a parent account with STSCO, simply sign-in and click on the “parent” drop-down menu and select “ONLINE FORMS & REQUESTS” and select the * 2024-25 Opt-In for Home to School Transportation request.\n\nIf you do not have a parent account, you can easily create one through STSCO’s website. Click here to get started and once your account is created you can log in to view the student(s) information STSCO has on file for your child(ren). Simply click on the “parent” drop-down menu and select “ONLINE FORMS & REQUESTS” and select the * 2024-25 Opt-In for Home to School Transportation request.\n\nIf a student is missing from your parent account, it is likely because the email address used to create the account, is not the same email address on file at the school. Please speak to the student(s) school to confirm your email address on file and be sure to use the same email when you create your account. For more information on creating your account and opting-in, Read the Letter to Parents : STSCO Opt-In for Transportation – New for 2024-2025 School Year\n\nIf you have already submitted your Opt-In request, thank you for your request no further action is needed.\n\nThank you,\n\nSTSCO.\n\nStudent Transportation Services of Central Ontario (STSCO)\n\nDear KPR families,\n\nWelcome back to another exciting school year in KPR!\n\nOn behalf of the Board of Trustees and senior administration, we are pleased and excited to welcome students, staff and families back to our elementary and secondary schools on Tuesday, September 5.\n\nWe hope during the summer that our students and families have found ways to rest, recharge and spend time together. There is nothing that brings us greater joy than welcoming thousands of students back to our schools, and sharing in their excitement and energy.\n\nOur schools are safe, inclusive and vibrant places where we set high expectations for success. We continue to focus on seeing all students as capable learners, sparking their curiosity and elevating their voices. We know how important it is for students to feel seen, heard and reflected in the learning resources, spaces and people around them.\n\nTogether, we will continue our work to create equitable conditions for positive learning, well-being and success for ALL students. We remain committed to our mission in all we do - we inspire our students to excel in learning, succeed in life, and enrich our communities.\n\nAs you prepare your child and your family for the excitement of the first day and all of the learning and firsts for the year ahead, please know that we are as excited as you are, and we look forward to continuing to work in partnership to support student success.\n\nWell-being is just as important as learning, and is foundational to all types of success. In closing we are sharing the Mentally Healthy School Support Package, as a valuable resource to support student mental health and well-being as we enter the 2023-24 school year.\n\nPlease check out the KPR website, or contact your school office, if you have questions about school or need more information. If you are on social media, you can follow us @kprschools.\n\nBest wishes for the year ahead! Together #WeAreKPR\n\nSincerely,\n\nSteve Russell Rita Russo\n\nChairperson of the Board Director of Education\n\nKPR NEWS\n\nStudent Busing\n\nAs you may know, bus driver shortages have been an ongoing issue for many school boards for several years, including here at KPR.\n\nWe are very excited that our bus operators have shared that, at this time, all KPR bus and transportation routes currently have drivers for the start of the school year, and that they continue to recruit and hire spare drivers. This good news is thanks to a targeted recruitment campaign, to attract more bus drivers in our area.\n\nOur thanks to staff at Student Transportation Services of Central Ontario (STSCO) who have been working with bus operators on a regular basis and throughout the summer to monitor ongoing recruitment and training efforts.\n\nWe are pleased to be in this positive position as we begin the school year. For more information about bus routes and transportation, please visit the Student Transportation Services of Central Ontario website.\n\nPA Day Learning\n\nThroughout the upcoming school year, we will be sharing more information about how KPR staff are learning and working together on Professional Activity (PA) Days to support students’ success.\n\nStaff at elementary and secondary schools will be engaged in a full day of learning during the August 31 PA Day. Among the areas of learning for staff on this day are: School Improvement Planning, Workplace Violence Awareness, Curriculum Implementation and Mental Health.\n\nFurther details on PA Day plans can be found on our website.\n\nHello everyone,\n\nJust two weeks into the new school year, students are becoming more familiar with routines and school is back in full swing. I have had the pleasure of visiting schools over the last couple of weeks and I continue to be inspired by the curiosity and determination of students, and the innovation and passion of staff. KPR truly is an awesome place to be!\n\nThe start of the school year provides many opportunities for students to make new connections, build meaningful relationships and get involved in their school and community. Participating in activities at school and learning new skills can contribute to student well-being in many ways.\n\nNext weekend, KPR is participating in the Peterborough Pride Parade. Everyone is welcome to join us to show pride and allyship, and to support and celebrate people of all sexual orientations and gender identities; to honour those who have paved the way for equal rights; and to contribute to building accepting attitudes, safe and inclusive spaces in our schools and communities.

The Commissioner’s Office promptly reviews, assesses and determines necessary next steps for addressing all complaints.\n\nWhile we continue to encourage students, staff and families to first address concerns directly with those involved in the situation, e.g. the teacher, principal, manager or superintendent, concerns may also be reported confidentially, through the online reporting tool – Report IT!

We honour First Nations, Métis, and Inuit children and communities impacted by the residential school system and remember those who never returned home.\n\nIn recognition of this observance, flags will be flown at half-mast at KPR schools and education centres this weekend.

This week has been very difficult, and our thoughts continue to be with all those mourning the loss of loved ones in the deadly attacks by Hamas on Israel over the weekend, and the devastating impacts of ongoing violence for all those living in the region. We recognize, for the Jewish, Israeli and Palestinian communities, the impacts are profound and deeply personal. Many KPRDSB students, staff, and families are directly affected by these horrific acts through family, community, identity, and history.\n\nWe are deeply committed to providing support and care for students, staff and families.\n\nTo help guide challenging conversations or questions, families may wish to review this resource to Support Youth Following a Traumatic Event, from KPR’s Mental Health services.\n\nAs we look ahead to next week, school communities will have the opportunity to learn more about the important role of school board trustees during Local Government Week.

The peak of the eclipse will occur during dismissal time across the school board, increasing student safety concerns for safe travel and potentially damaging eye exposure to the sun at that time. Resources to support learning and student safety on that day will be shared throughout the school board community.\n\nHigh School Grade 8 Information Nights\n\nKPR secondary schools are hosting information sessions for parents, caregivers and students between November and January. Grade 8 families can learn everything they need to know about schools, programs, courses and the many exciting opportunities that are available! For event details, including a list of dates and times, students and families can visit the Board website.\n\nDear KPR Families,\n\nAs the year draws to a close, I want to extend my sincere best wishes for a restful and joyful holiday break.\n\nYesterday was Winter Solstice, a day to mark the return of the sun’s presence in the sky, and a day with important significance in Indigenous cultures and communities. It is recognized as a time of renewal and reflection.\n\nOn behalf of myself and the senior administrative team, Chairperson of the Board Jaine Klassen Jeninga, and KPR’s Board of Trustees, Merry Christmas, Happy Kwanzaa and Happy Holidays to all who are celebrating in the coming days. Information about Days of Significance is available on the KPR Events Calendar.\n\nAs a school district, we remain committed to helping students find success and a sense of well-being and belonging at school and we know there is always more we can do toward these shared goals. I look forward to the start of the new year, filled with many more opportunities to inspire excellence in learning, life and community!\n\nSincerely,\n\nRita Russo\n\nDirector of Education\n\nKPR News\n\nGreetings from the Minister of Education\n\nStephen Lecce, Minister of Education, has asked us to share this holiday greeting video with families and students in our schools. https://youtu.be/t1GnF_-j_qU?si=Bz5lPOIWpGxlAnDz\n\nDear KPR Families,\n\nWelcome Back! I hope each of you had a restful and enjoyable break, and that you’ve had a positive first week back at school despite the overdue arrival of winter weather!\n\nWith the new year, I’d like to take the opportunity to share an exciting update about KPR’s new Strategic Plan. After widespread consultation with students, staff, families and communities, and many months of dialogue and visioning among our Board of Trustees and Senior Administration – we are pleased to introduce KPR’s Strategic Plan for 2023-26: Inspiring Excellence in Learning, Success in Life and Community.\n\nPlease take a moment to watch this short video message from Chairperson Jaine Klassen Jeninga and myself introducing the Strategic Plan. Our new plan charts a purposeful course towards even stronger outcomes for our students, staff and school board. Throughout our online and in-person engagement, we heard strongly about the need to focus not only on academic achievement and success for students, but also to support differentiated and diverse learning pathways to meet the unique strengths, skills and needs of all students.\n\nWe hope everyone can see themselves reflected within these priorities, which reflect our common, core values of student achievement and success, well-being and belonging, and relationships. More information about the strategic plan, our process and culmination of the engagement process across the district can be found on our Board website.\n\nLastly, I want to extend a special thank you to all those who took the time to share their voices and experiences, which greatly contributed towards the development of our new strategic priorities. I look forward to continuing to work together as we bring these commitments to life over the next three years!\n\nSincerely,\n\nRita Russo\n\nDirector of Education\n\nKPR NEWS\n\n2024-25 School Year Calendar Survey\n\nWe invite KPR students, staff and families to provide feedback on the proposed 2024-25 school year calendar through an online survey by February 5th.

Grade 8 families can learn everything they need to know about schools, programs, courses and the many exciting opportunities that are available! For event details, including a list of dates and times, students and families can visit the Board website.\n\nDear KPR families,\n\nOne of the many things I am grateful for in my role as Director of Education is being able to share stories of our success as a school district, through the Director’s Annual Report.\n\nThe 2023 Director’s Annual Report includes student and staff stories that highlight moments of inspiration, accomplishments and incredible growth across our Board. I invite you to watch this brief video from Chairperson Jaine Klassen Jeninga and myself, providing a glimpse into the report and some of the incredible stories you will come across through its pages. These stories celebrate success in math and literacy, community involvement, student voice, our commitment to inclusivity and belonging, Indigenous education, and so much more! Another important highlight of the report is the recognition of our amazing KPR employees who contribute to student success in countless ways every day. In particular, we shine the spotlight on three #WeAreKPR heroes who each go above and beyond in their roles as Head Custodians: Lee Anne at Dr. Ross Tilley PS, John at Kawartha Heights PS, and Margaret at Roseneath Centennial PS.\n\nAs we move forward with this school year, I’d like to reiterate the importance of taking good care of our mental health. Many of our students and staff have been participating in mental health and wellness activities this week, as part of #KPRLetsConnect and broader conversations about mental health and well-being happening across Canada. It’s important that these discussions continue beyond this week. I also want to remind everyone of resources available for students.\n\nIn addition to focusing on mental health and wellness in January, there are several significant events and observances this month, including Family Literacy Day, Holocaust Remembrance Day, and the Remembrance of the Quebec City Mosque Attack and Action Against Islamophobia. More information about these and other days of significance is available on the KPR Events Calendar on our website.\n\nI would like to end my message by extending best wishes to secondary students completing exams and culminating tasks next week.\n\nSincerely,\n\nRita Russo\n\nDirector of Education\n\nKPR News\n\nKindergarten\n\nIt’s Kindergarten registration time at Kawartha Pine Ridge District School Board. KPR schools offer warm, welcoming Kindergarten programs that engage and encourage children to reach their full potential. Visit kprschools.ca/kindergarten for online registration information and to learn more about KPR’s safe, inclusive classrooms, where children learn through play!\n\nShare your Feedback!\n\nWe invite KPR students, staff and families to provide feedback on the following:\n\nThe proposed 2024-25 School Year Calendar: The proposed school year calendar is available on our website, and the online survey will be available until February 5. After the survey closes, the calendar will be brought to the Board of Trustees and then submitted to the Ministry of Education for final approval.\n\nPediculosis Regulation and Guideline Review: Based on public health guidance, changes are being recommended to operational practices around pediculosis (head lice) in schools. School councils and families are invited to review the proposed changes and provide feedback using an online form, by March 24, 2024.\n\nDear KPR families,\n\nOur schools are full of positive opportunities for reflection this month.\n\nWe are currently celebrating Black History Month - a time for intentional recognition of the achievements, contributions and lived experiences of Black communities. In our learning at KPR, we recognize the value of celebrating and highlighting Black History and Black Excellence every day.\n\nAs we honour and celebrate the history, achievements, and excellence of Black communities around the world, we are mindful, in our schools and through our social media posts, to share multi-faceted stories that do not limit or reduce narratives of the Black Experience to trauma, struggle, and/or oppression, because there is so much more to the stories of Black communities.\n\nYesterday, the Ontario government announced new mandatory learning in Grades 7, 8 and 10 history on the exceptional contributions and history of Black Canadians, beginning September 2025. This new learning is welcomed and will complement the work already happening in our schools.\n\nThroughout the next couple of weeks, we have opportunities to celebrate family, love, and friendship, in all their forms. For more information about upcoming days of significance, please visit KPR’s online Events Calendar.\n\nFinally, I’d like to wish a Happy Lunar New Year to everyone in the KPR community celebrating this weekend.\n\nSincerely,\n\nRita Russo,\n\nDirector of Education\n\nKPR NEWS\n\nElementary Report Card Change - Language Mark\n\nFamilies of elementary students will be receiving their child’s Term 1 Report Card (Grades 1-8) or Communication of Learning (Kindergarten) between February 15-20.\n\nOne change that families of Grade 1- 8 students may notice is that Language learning will be shared as one mark (as opposed to what was previously separate marks for reading, writing, oral communication and media literacy). This change is due to the release of the revised Grades 1-8 Language curriculum, which was implemented in September 2023 across Ontario. The curriculum outlines what students should know and be able to do by the end of each grade in Language, reflecting new strands of learning and new expectations that differ from the previous Language curriculum.\n\nIn all grades, the Language curriculum has been intentionally designed to ensure that students:\n\nbuild solid foundations in language and literacy.\n\ndevelop their analytical and critical thinking skills, and reflect on their learning.\n\nacquire knowledge and skills across the four strands in order to understand, respond to, appreciate, and create a full range of texts.\n\nThis shift aligns with the use of one mark in other areas such as Math, Science and Social Studies over the past few years. As always, as part of intentional planning and instruction, educators will be able to speak to the curriculum expectations addressed this term and how students demonstrated this learning.\n\nKindergarten Virtual Information Series\n\nFamilies planning for Kindergarten next school year are invited to attend our free virtual information series! Our Kindergarten team will guide you through everything you need to know about starting Kindergarten at the Kawartha Pine Ridge District School Board.\n\nThe first virtual session is Wednesday, February 21, 2024 from 6:30pm - 7:15pm.

Our students and staff engaged in meaningful learning through discussions, school-based activities, guest speakers, presentations and resources. As we continue this learning at KPR, we recognize the value of celebrating and highlighting Black History and Black Excellence every day.\n\nFebruary 28 was Pink Shirt Day in KPR schools – an opportunity to celebrate our differences and promote kindness and compassion to ensure our schools continue to be safe and inclusive places for everyone.\n\nDuring Social Work Week from March 4-10, we want to purposefully recognize and value the important work of Mental Health Clinicians and Professional Services Staff in our schools.

Those recognized this week included Nowruz, International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination and World Down Syndrome Day, among several others which can be found on the Events Calendar on our Board website.\n\nEarlier this month, we recognized the beginning of Ramadan.

Both organizations are united in a commitment to reduce health inequities and address the most pressing public health challenges faced by the communities we serve.\n\nIf approved by the Ministry of Health, planning for the creation of a new joint health unit will be initiated in early Fall 2024, with a target implementation date of January 1, 2025.\n\nWe appreciate the collaborative and ongoing partnerships we have with public health partners across the Board.\n\nDear KPR Families,\n\nWelcome to May!
