Our PSP provides support for your home education efforts through the assistance of our director and fully-qualified home educator. The program has been designed with two important considerations in mind:It is the desire of the school board and staff at SCS to support and encourage Christian home educators in the pursuit of excellence in the training and education of their children.We believe that this can best be accomplished by offering resources available at SCS, by sharing in accountability, and by encouraging home educators to support and assist one another in their educational adventures.Shawna Poe is the Director of our Homeschool Private Satellite Program. Beginning with a one-day in-service visit in August, Shawna meets with homeschool families at least twice during the school year to offer guidance and encouragement, as well as answer any questions they may have concerning their childâs education.We offer a variety of activities including field trips, craft days, book clubs, on-campus classes and much more to assist families in their home-education journey.We encourage our families to get to know one another and develop friendships that will last a lifetime! It is our sincere hope that SCSâ PSP provides parents with the proper blend of resources, accountability and flexibility needed to fulfill the calling for a home-based educator..âTrain up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old, he will not depart from it.â Proverbs 22:6",
