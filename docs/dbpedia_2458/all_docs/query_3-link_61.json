I seemed to excel in all aspects of high school (except with girls): I was a straight A student, Vice President of the student body, and a three sport athlete (even an all-state wrestler!). But going off to college in the beautiful mountain city of Asheville was where I truly blossomed. I became engaged with my studies, began reading outside of class for my own enlightenment, and started to see where my learning could take me. During this time, I met my wife Katie, and my entire life was changed. She showed me what love was all about. We moved to Colorado to attend graduate school but I got a job teaching high school English in my old hometown in 2010. I taught four amazing years at a small school in North Carolina before moving to Bakersfield to be nearer my wife's family and began our own family. I began teaching AP Literature at Stockdale in 2014. I'm so thankful and blessed to be here!\n\nFavorite things:"
