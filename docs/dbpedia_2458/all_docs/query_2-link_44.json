        "text": "Founded in 1979, Bakersfield Christian High School is a dually accredited, nondenominational, college preparatory high school that seeks to develop each student’s mind, body and spirit to his or her fullest potential through challenging coursework, state-of-the-art technology, visual and performing arts, competitive athletics, and spiritual training.\n\nThe 47-acre facility features highlights such as a Library/Media Center, Student Union, Fine Arts Center and a Sports Center which houses one of the largest high school gymnasiums in Kern County.\n\nBCHS has a wide range of curricular offerings, which challenge and nurture the intellectual life of each student. Students take a college preparatory curriculum designed to meet the subject requirements of the University of California and California State University systems.\n\nMost students, however, go beyond these minimum entrance requirements, completing more than the required number of credits and taking advantage of the school’s Scholars Program and/or the numerous honors and advanced placement courses like calculus, physics, chemistry and more. Recent BCHS graduates were accepted to highly competitive universities such as UCLA, USC, UC Berkeley, Cal Poly, Georgetown, Georgia Tech, Johns Hopkins, Notre Dame, Vanderbilt and Yale.\n\nBeyond the classroom there are many opportunities to participate in school activities such as the science fair, mathematics competitions or academic decathlon as well as opportunities to join clubs such as robotics or National Honor Society.\n\nNestled in the San Joaquin Valley, BCHS is a suburban community with a comfortable, California climate year round. The neutral location affords opportunities to visit beaches, mountains and deserts each approximately two hours or less away from the city of Bakersfield. Also about two hours away is Los Angeles, so whether you are flying into Los Angeles International Airport or headed to watch a professional sports team or to a day of fun at theme parks such as Disneyland, Universal Studios or Six Flags, many opportunities are nearby.\n\nAccreditation\n\nBCHS is fully accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC) and the Association of Christian Schools International (ACSI). Course credit earned at BCHS is easily transferable to colleges and universities throughout the United States.\n\nTechnology\n\nTechnology is an integral part of the learning process at BCHS. We utilize the latest technologies in order to enhance the learning experience for all of our students. One highlight of BCHS is the iPad program. All students are issued a school iPad to use in the classroom and take home for homework. Classrooms are equipped with Apply TVs and a 60” HD display plus designated computer labs equipped with iMacs give students an additional place to work after school as needed.\n\nAthletic and Arts\n\nThe athletics and visual and performing arts programs are a vital part of the life of the school. In recent years, 70% to 75% of BCHS students have participated in at least one of the 22 sports programs available. These teams are a great way to not only have fun and stay active, but also essential to building friendships while enjoying a big part of American high school culture. Likewise, the arts program not only meets graduation requirements, but affords many opportunities through music and theater to be involved beyond the classroom.\n\nStudent Life\n\nComplementing learning is the development of student activities that encourage a relationship among the student body as well as with teachers and administrators by creating avenues through group-centered activities and competitions. BCHS is a fun place. In addition to the activities like homecoming, powder-puff, spirit weeks, prom, winter formal and other quintessential high school milestones, BCHS is known for its unique activities such as the three-day Hume Lake retreat and a day filled with a series of crazy contests toward the end of each school year known as Boondog Olympics.\n\nHomestay\n\nOne unique aspect of BCHS’ homestay program is that the international students stay in a local home and have a family-like experience away from their own family.\n\nWith international students from countries such as South Korea, China, Japan and Cameroon in recent years, there is increased diversity on the BCHS campus which benefits not only the international students but also the entire student body. Traditionally, international students have made up about 8% of the entire student body which ensures a true American high school experience.\n\nCollege Preparation\n\nStudents receive one-on-one guidance from BCHS’ expert and experienced college counselors over the course of their four years. The guidance department aims to identify the needs, interests, aptitudes, and goals of all BCHS students, including the international students. This process provides each student with academic, college and career, and personal and social guidance throughout his or her four years at BCHS. Additionally, counselors assist students in gaining the self-knowledge, information, and insight necessary to make mature decisions, to plan their academic and career futures realistically and to solve interpersonal problems effectively. This guidance is provided to all students and is included in the cost of tuition.\n\nBCHS hosts college events and each year international students tour some of the top universities in California. Dozens of colleges also send admissions officers to BCHS to meet with students throughout the year.\n\nDuring international students’ first year, one class period each day is spent in an English lab where students are given supplemental English help as well as instruction for all classes. The following year, international students may continue English lab. Additionally, international students attend a specialized study hall after school Monday through Thursday. Each of these services are included with tuition. Beyond these services, further support is available through the Educational Support Services program for an additional fee for those who need it.\n\nEncouragement and assistance will be provided for the TOEFL, SAT and/or ACT testing for college entrance."
