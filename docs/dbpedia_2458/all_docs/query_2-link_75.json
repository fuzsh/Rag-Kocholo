        "text": "The basics are always free. No one from Stockdale High School should be excluded from reunions or events, that's why I am keeping these features free to all Stockdale High School alumni. Tell others all about your life after high school. What schools have you been to? What about your love life? Family? Career? Your classmates definitely want to know what you've been doing since leaving Stockdale High School. Find out what alumni events are coming up for Stockdale High School and your class. Not just major reunions, but smaller events to keep people together during the in-between years can be planned as well. Reunion organizers can plan events for free! I am asking for a one-time contribution of $10.00 to use the advanced features which let you connect with old friends, while maintaining your privacy. Your email address is never given out unless you give it out yourself in a message. There is a great reunion and event planning tool which includes an RSVP feature allowing for easy two way communications. Contributions to Stockdale High School Project Alumni are used to maintain the site and pay for advertising. The Stockdale High School Project Alumni Directory gets you in touch with your long lost friends! Both non-paying and paying members are included in the directory, but only paid members have access to the directory. No email addresses are ever displayed. Find out where Jack is, who Joan married, etc... There are two forum areas, one for the whole school regardless of graduation year, and one for just your Stockdale High School class. Once you find someone you want to contact in the Stockdale High School Project Alumni Directory you can send them a private message through Alumni Mail. You will not be able to see their email address and they will not be able to see yours. You can always provide your email in the message if you want. Stockdale High School Project Alumni does not filter messages like those other sites."
