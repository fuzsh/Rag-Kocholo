        "text": "I’m thankful for the time I’ve spent at Stockdale High School. I’ve met great people, had some awesome teachers, and had plenty of fun at rallies and football games! The school has a wide variety of clubs and electives for students to choose from. Pretty good AP and Honors courses, too. Like any school, Stockdale also has its issues. Some of the library staff can be rude towards students and there are fights pretty often. Also, not to mention the lunch food and the bathrooms? Naaaasty sometimes!\n\nI mentioned meeting a lot of great people but I’ve also met some rude ones too. Mean people who think that they’re better than any and everyone and look at you like you actually did something terrible to them. Like, hurt their entire family or something. But those kinds of people are everywhere so not really Stockdale’s fault, LOL. Also my friend got suspended without any valid reason one time. Thankfully she was able to undo it but, seriously? Seriously."
