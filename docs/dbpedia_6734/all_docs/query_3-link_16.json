HHMI is committed to advancing diversity, equity, and inclusionexternal link, opens in a new tab in academic science at key points along career pathways, from undergraduate to tenured faculty.\n\nIn 2022, HHMI launched the Freeman Hrabowski Scholars program to support outstanding basic researchers, including physician-scientists, who have strong potential to become leaders in their fields and to advance diversity, equity, and inclusion through their mentoring efforts and understanding of systemic exclusion and marginalization in science of trainees from different backgrounds. Scholars prioritize scientific excellence in their own research while creating an inclusive lab climate that serves as a model within their own institutions and beyond.\n\nScholars are appointed to a five-year term, renewable for a second five-year term after a successful progress evaluation. Each Scholar receives up to $8.6 million over the ten-year period, including full salary, benefits, a research budget, and scientific equipment. They also participate in professional development to advance their leadership and mentoring skills.\n\nUp to 30 Freeman Hrabowski Scholars will be selected in 2025, with future competitions anticipated every two years."
