        "text": "The following information is a guide to the presentation of experimental data, including appropriate formats for citation.\n\nYield\n\nYield should be presented in parentheses after the compound name (or its equivalent). Weight and percentage should be separated by a comma – for example, the lactone (7.1 g, 56%).\n\nMelting point\n\nThe melting point should be presented in the form mp 75 °C (from EtOH) - that is, the crystallisation solvent in parentheses. If an identical mixed melting point is to be recorded, the form mp and mixed mp 75 °C is appropriate.\n\nOptical rotation\n\nThe units should be stated in the preamble to the Experimental section – for example, [α]D values are given in 10−1 deg cm2 g−1. This should be shown in the form [α]D 22–22.5 (c 0.95 in EtOH) – that is, concentration and solvent in parentheses.\n\nRefractive index\n\nGiven in the form nD22 1.653.\n\nElemental analysis\n\nFor the presentation of elemental analyses, both forms (Found: C, 63.1; H, 5.4. C13H13NO4requires C, 63.2; H, 5.3%) and (Found: C, 62.95; H, 5.4. Calc. for C13H13NO4: C, 63.2; H, 5.3%) are acceptable. Analyses are normally quoted to the nearest 0.1%, but a 5 in the second place of decimals is retained.\n\nIf a molecular weight is to be included, the appropriate form is: [Found: C, 63.1; H, 5.4%; M (mass spectrum), 352 (or simply M+, 352). C13H13NO4 requires C, 63.2; H, 5.3%; M, 352].\n\nWe encourage authors to provide instrumental details and the chromatograms of the performed measurements in the Supplementary Information where possible.\n\nUV absorptions\n\nThese should be given in the form λmax(EtOH)/nm 228 (ε/dm3 mol-1 cm-1 40 900), 262 (19 200) and 302 (11 500). Inflections and shoulders are specified as 228infl or 262sh. Alternatively the following form may be used: λmax (EtOH)/nm 228, 262 and 302 (ε/dm3 mol-1 cm-1 40 900, 19 200 and 11 500); log ε may be quoted instead of ε.\n\nIR absorptions\n\nIR absorption should be presented as follows: νmax/cm-1 3460 and 3330 (NH), 2200 (conj. CN), 1650 (CO) and 1620 (CN). The type of signal (s, w, vs, br) can be indicated by appended letters (for example 1760vs).\n\nNMR data\n\nFor all NMR spectra δ values should be used, with the nucleus indicated by subscript if necessary (for example, δH, δC). A statement specifying the units of the coupling constants should be given in the preamble to the Experimental section – for example, J values are given in Hz. Instrument frequency, solvent, and standard should be specified. For example: δH(100 MHz; CDCl3; Me4Si) 2.3 (3 H, s, Me), 2.5 (3 H, s, COMe), 3.16 (3 H, s, NMe) and 7.3–7.6 (5 H, m, Ph).\n\nA broad signal may be denoted by br, such as 2.43 (1 H, br s, NH). Order of citation in parentheses: (i) number of equivalent nuclei (by integration), (ii) multiplicity (s, d, t, q), (iii) coupling constant – for example, J1,2 2, JAB 4, (iv) assignment; italicisation can be used to specify the nuclei concerned (for example, CH3CH2). The proton attached to C-6 may be designated C(6)H or 6-H; the methyl attached to C-6, 6-Me or C(6)Me.\n\nMutually coupled protons in 1H NMR spectra should be quoted with precisely matching J values, in order to assist thorough interpretation. In instances of any ambiguities when taking readings from computer printouts, mean J values should be quoted, rounded to the nearest decimal point.\n\nMass spectrometry data\n\nMass spectrometry data should be given in the form: m/z 183 (M+, 41%), 168 (38), 154 (9), 138 (31) etc. The molecular ion may be specified as shown if desired. Relative intensities should be shown in parentheses (% only included once). Other assignments may be included in the form m/z 152 (33, M − CH3CONH2). Metastable peaks may be listed as: M* 160 (189→174), 147 (176→161), etc. The type of spectrum (field desorption, electron impact, etc.) should be indicated. Exact masses quoted for identification purposes should be accurate to within 5 ppm (EI and CI) or 10 ppm (FAB or LSIMS).\n\nReviewers will assess the evidence in support of the homogeneity and structure of all new compounds. No hard and fast rules can be laid down to cover all types of compound, but evidence for the unequivocal identification of new compounds should, wherever possible, include good elemental analytical data – an accurate mass measurement of a molecular ion does not provide evidence of purity of a compound and should be accompanied by independent evidence of homogeneity.\n\nWhere elemental analytical data cannot be obtained, appropriate evidence that is convincing to an expert in the field may be acceptable. Normally, for diamagnetic compounds this entails, at a minimum, a high resolution mass spectrometry measurement along with assigned 1H and/or 13C NMR spectra devoid of visible impurities.\n\nSpectroscopic information necessary for the assignment of structure should be given. How complete this information should be depends upon the circumstances; the structure of a compound obtained from an unusual reaction or isolated from a natural source should be supported by stronger evidence than one that was produced by a standard reaction from a precursor of undisputed structure.\n\nParticular care should be taken in supporting the assignments of stereochemistry (both relative and absolute) of chiral compounds reported, for example by one of the following:\n\nNMR spectroscopy\n\nX-Ray crystallography\n\nPolarimetry\n\nCorrelation with known compounds of undisputed configuration\n\nIn cases where mixtures of isomers are generated (for example, E-Z isomers, enantiomers, diastereoisomers), the constitution of the mixture should usually be established using appropriate analytical techniques (for example, NMR spectroscopy, GC, HPLC) and reported in an unambiguous fashion.\n\nFor an asymmetric reaction in which an enantiomeric mixture is prepared, the direct measurement of the enantiomer ratio expressed as the enantiomeric excess (ee) is recommended, and is preferred to less reliable polarimetry methods.\n\nIf a compound is new more detailed characterisation will be required. A compound is considered to be new if:\n\nit has not been prepared before\n\nit has been prepared before but not adequately purified\n\nit has been purified but not adequately characterised\n\nit has been assigned an erroneous composition previously\n\nit is a natural product isolated or synthesized for the first time\n\nWe encourage authors reporting various compounds or compound libraries to apply the FAIR principles and include a summary file of these compounds as part of the submission. This file should be deposited in an appropriate repository or be provided as part of the Supplementary Information, and should adhere to the following:\n\nformat - CSV (*.csv), TSV (*.tsv) or SDF (*.sdf)\n\nfor chemical structures - relevant headers including SMILES, InChI and InChIKey\n\nfor chemical names - Name and Synonym\n\nfor other comments - such data, metadata, etc\n\nThese instructions are based on FAIR chemical structures in the Journal of Cheminformatics (E.L. Schymanski & E.E. Bolton, Journal of Cheminformatics, 2021, 13, 50).\n\nWe recommend that authors follow the guidelines for the nomenclature of new radiolabelled compounds, as laid out in Consensus nomenclature rules for radiopharmaceutical chemistry - setting the record straight (C.H.H., G.A.D. et al., Nuclear Medicine and Biology, 2017, 55, v – xi).\n\nDetails of the data collection and CCDC numbers should be given in the Data Availability Statement.\n\nFor relevant structures that are published as CSD communications, and that have not appeared in the manuscript or a previous journal publication, details should be included in the Data Availability Statement and the appropriate DOI should be cited as a reference in the manuscript.\n\nWhere there is significant discussion about the crystallography, the description may be given in textual or tabular form, although the latter is more appropriate if several structure determinations are being reported in one paper. A table of selected bond lengths and angles, with estimated standard deviations, should be restricted to significant dimensions only. Average values may be given with a range of E.S.D.s for chemically equivalent groups or for similar bonds.\n\nProcedures for data collection and structure analysis can be provided as part of the Supplementary Information. The following data are recommended:\n\nChemical formula and formula weight (M)\n\nCrystal system\n\nUnit cell dimensions (Å or pm, degrees) and volume, with estimated standard deviations, temperature\n\nSpace group symbol (if non-standard setting give related standard setting)\n\nNumber of formula units in unit cell (Z)\n\nNumber of reflections measured and/or number of independent reflections, Rint\n\nFinal R values (and whether quoted for all or observed data)\n\nFlack or Rogers parameter (if appropriate)\n\nFor example:\n\nSingle crystals of [Pd{C(CO2Me)[C(CO2Me)C(CO2Me)=\n\nC(CO2Me)C(CO2Me)=C(CO2Me)]C6H3[CH(Me)NH2]-2-NO2-5}Br] 4 were recrystallised from dichloromethane, mounted in inert oil and transferred to the cold gas stream of the diffractometer.\n\nCrystal structure determination of complex 4:\n\nCrystal data. C28H31BrCl4N2O14Pd, M = 947.66, orthorhombic, a = 11.096(1), b = 17.197(2), c = 19.604(3) Å, U = 3741.0(9) Å3, T = 173 K, space group P212121 (no.19), Z = 4, 6013 reflections measured, 5665 unique (Rint= 0.031), which were used in all calculations. The final wR(F2) was 0.099 (all data).\n\nThere may be cases where authors do not wish to include details or extensive discussion of a crystal structure determination. Examples include where only the connectivity has been established, data is marked as low quality at the CCDC, the structure is not integral to the conclusions of the article, or the structure has been discussed in a previous publication. Authors should be mindful of unnecessary fragmentation and the editor’s decision on this will be final.\n\nAuthors are encouraged to submit powder diffraction crystallographic data as a CIF (Crystallographic Information File) file to an appropriate repository,such as the ICDD or CCDC, please see the Data Sharing policy for further details. For powder diffraction data, please do not include CCDC numbers as part of the manuscript submission process. The reference numbers and DOIs should be cited in a data availability statement. For information on how to cite crystallographic data in your manuscript, please see the section on Data Citation.\n\nAuthors should combine multiple data sets for a given manuscript into a single file. The individual structures in the combined file should be separated from each other by the sequence #===END at the beginning of a line.\n\nAuthors should identify the manuscript with which the electronic file is associated when they submit the file by entering the name of the manuscript at the top of the electronic file.\n\nThe information required for deposition includes the following:\n\nA table of final fractional atomic coordinates\n\nAny calculated coordinates (for example, hydrogen)\n\nA full list of bond lengths and angles with estimated standard deviations\n\nA full list of displacement parameters in the form Bij or Uij (in Å2 or pm2)\n\nFull details of the refinement\n\nProfile difference plots for all analyses. Where a range of similar analyses are presented a minimum number of representative plots may be given\n\nUnrefined powder diffraction data should normally be reported only if the data form part of the discussion presented in the paper, and should be restricted to new materials. In such cases, the following experimental details should be provided in either textual or tabular format:\n\nDiffractometer name and model\n\nRadiation wavelength (Å)\n\nTemperature of data collection\n\nUnit cell dimensions (Å or pm, degrees), if determined\n\nTables of 2θ data, or diagrams showing diffraction patterns of reaction products, should not normally be published in print unless they have some distinct feature of relevance that requires such detail to be present. In most cases, such data may be provided as Supplementary Information (SI).\n\nFor cases where the materials are new, but have similar powder data to other well-characterised materials, such data should not usually be included in the paper but can be deposited in an appropriate repository, with the relevant reference number included in a Data Availability Statement, and cited.\n\nFor refined powder diffraction data (where atomic coordinates have been determined), if the procedures for data collection and structure analysis were routine, their description may be concise. When the analysis has not been of a routine nature, the authors should briefly detail the procedures used. In most cases, a table of atomic coordinates may be provided, which should give details of occupancies that are less than unity.\n\nAnisotropic thermal parameters may be included if they form an important aspect of the study. Selected bond lengths and angles, with estimated standard deviations, should be given.\n\nFor Rietveld refinements, an observed + calculated + difference profile plot should normally be given for each structure determination, except where a significant number of similar refinements have been carried out. In such cases, only the minimum number of representative plots should be included in the article, with additional plots being deposited in an appropriate repository and cited, or included in the SI.\n\nThe following information should be provided:\n\nDiffractometer name and model\n\nRadiation wavelength (Å)\n\nTemperature of data collection\n\nStep size\n\nChemical formula and formula weight (M)\n\nUnit cell dimensions (Å or pm, degrees)\n\nSpace group\n\nNumber of formula units in unit cell (Z)\n\nNumber of reflections\n\nFinal R values (Rwp, Rexp and Rl) and method of background treatment"
