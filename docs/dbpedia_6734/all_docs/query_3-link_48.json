        "text": "Research Statement\n\nWhat is a Research Statement?\n\nThe research statement (or statement of research interests) is a common component of academic job applications. It is a summary of your research accomplishments, current work, and future direction and potential of your work.\n\nThe statement can discuss specific issues such as:\n\nfunding history and potential\n\nrequirements for laboratory equipment and space and other resources\n\npotential research and industrial collaborations\n\nhow your research contributes to your field\n\nfuture direction of your research\n\nThe research statement should be technical, but should be intelligible to all members of the department, including those outside your subdiscipline. So keep the “big picture” in mind. The strongest research statements present a readable, compelling, and realistic research agenda that fits well with the needs, facilities, and goals of the department.\n\nResearch statements can be weakened by:\n\noverly ambitious proposals\n\nlack of clear direction\n\nlack of big-picture focus\n\ninadequate attention to the needs and facilities of the department or position\n\nWhy a Research Statement?\n\nIt conveys to search committees the pieces of your professional identity and charts the course of your scholarly journey.\n\nIt communicates a sense that your research will follow logically from what you have done and that it will be different, important, and innovative.\n\nIt gives a context for your research interests—Why does your research matter? The so what?\n\nIt combines your achievements and current work with the proposal for upcoming research.\n\nHelps hiring committees assess:\n\nareas of specialty and expertise\n\npotential to get funding\n\nacademic strengths and abilities\n\ncompatibility with the department or school\n\nability to think and communicate like a serious scholar and/or scientist\n\nFormatting of Research Statements\n\nThe goal of the research statement is to introduce yourself to a search committee, which will probably contain scientists both in and outside your field, and get them excited about your research. To encourage people to read it:\n\nmake it one or two pages, three at most\n\nuse informative section headings and subheadings\n\nuse bullets\n\nuse an easily readable font size\n\nmake the margins a reasonable size\n\nOrganization of Research Statements\n\nThink of the overarching theme guiding your main research subject area. Write an essay that lays out:\n\nThe main theme(s) and why it is important and what specific skills you use to attack the problem.\n\nA few specific examples of problems you have already solved with success to build credibility and inform people outside your field about what you do.\n\nA discussion of the future direction of your research. This section should be really exciting to people both in and outside your field. Don’t sell yourself short; if you think your research could lead to answers for big important questions, say so!\n\nA final paragraph that gives a good overall impression of your research.\n\nWriting Research Statements\n\nStyle:\n\nAvoid jargon. Make sure that you describe your research in language that many people outside your specific subject area can understand. Ask people both in and outside your field to read it before you send your application. A search committee won’t get excited about something they can’t understand.\n\nWrite as clearly, concisely, and concretely as you can.\n\nKeep it at a summary level; give more detail in the job talk.\n\nAsk others to proofread it. Be sure there are no spelling errors.\n\nContent:\n\nConvince the search committee not only that you are knowledgeable, but that you are the right person to carry out the research.\n\nInclude information that sets you apart (e.g., publication in Science, Nature, or a prestigious journal in your field).\n\nWhat excites you about your research? Sound fresh.\n\nInclude preliminary results and how to build on results.\n\nPoint out how current faculty may become future partners.\n\nAcknowledge the work of others.\n\nUse language that shows you are an independent researcher.\n\nBUT focus on your research work, not yourself.\n\nInclude potential funding partners and industrial collaborations. Be creative!\n\nProvide a summary of your research.\n\nPut in background material to give the context/relevance/significance of your research.\n\nList major findings, outcomes, and implications.\n\nDescribe both current and planned (future) research.\n\nCommunicate a sense that your research will follow logically from what you have done and that it will be unique, significant, and innovative (and easy to fund).\n\nDescribe Your Future Goals or Research Plans\n\nMajor problem(s) you want to focus on in your research.\n\nThe problem’s relevance and significance to the field.\n\nYour specific goals for the next three to five years, including potential impact and outcomes.\n\nIf you know what a particular agency funds, you can name the agency and briefly outline a proposal.\n\nGive broad enough goals so that if one area doesn’t get funded, you can pursue other research goals and funding.\n\nIdentify Potential Funding Sources\n\nAlmost every institution wants to know whether you’ll be able to get external funding for research.\n\nTry to provide some possible sources of funding for the research, such as NIH, NSF, foundations, private agencies.\n\nMention past funding, if appropriate.\n\nBe Realistic\n\nThere is a delicate balance between a realistic research statement where you promise to work on problems you really think you can solve and over-reaching or dabbling in too many subject areas. Select an over-arching theme for your research statement and leave miscellaneous ideas or projects out. Everyone knows that you will work on more than what you mention in this statement.\n\nConsider Also Preparing a Longer Version\n\nA longer version (five–15 pages) can be brought to your interview. (Check with your advisor to see if this is necessary.)\n\nYou may be asked to describe research plans and budget in detail at the campus interview. Be prepared.\n\nInclude laboratory needs (how much budget you need for equipment, how many grad assistants, etc.) to start up the research.\n\nSamples of Research Statements\n\nTo find sample research statements with content specific to your discipline, search on the internet for your discipline + “Research Statement.”\n\nUniversity of Pennsylvania Sample Research Statement\n\nAdvice on writing a Research Statement (Plan) from the journal Science"
