        "text": "Domestic Submissions\n\nIn general, the Assistant District Director authorizes incoming specimen submissions of U.S.-origin samples to the NVSL. Authorization is assumed for routine program submissions made by regulatory field veterinarians, State or university diagnostic laboratories, or USDA Food Safety and Inspection Service veterinarians, when such submissions are accompanied by the proper submission forms. Major exceptions to this assumption of authorization occur during emergency field operations or with regard to suspected exotic diseases.\n\nSamples Originating Outside the United States\n\nSamples received from other countries must be accompanied by a valid USDA import permit; the laboratory conducting the analyses should be contacted to obtain a copy of the permit to enclose with the sample shipment. Additionally, samples originating from non-government laboratories outside the United States must be accompanied by an authorization letter from the submitting country's Minister of Agriculture (or equivalent).\n\nSuspected Exotic Diseases\n\nInvestigations of suspected exotic diseases are conducted according to Veterinary Services (VS) Guidance 12001 (274.92 KB). If an exotic disease is suspected, contact the Assistant District Director and the Emergency Programs staff to obtain the information necessary to submit samples for testing and to acquire the Investigation Control Number that must be included with the submission. Approval by a Regional Director or an Emergency Programs staff member is required for shipment of any specimens originating from animals suspected of having an exotic disease. DO NOT ship any such specimens until approval is received and a control number is assigned. The receipt of an unauthorized shipment of specimens containing exotic disease agents can cause substantial disruption of work at the laboratory. If clearance is given, the proper priority designation should be used. Telephone the NVSL, as directed by Emergency Programs, to notify the lab of priority 1 or 2 shipments. There is no charge for this testing.\n\nPrimate Samples\n\nThe NVSL will receive primate samples for serology, bacterial culture, and histopathology only. The NVSL will not accept primate samples for diagnosis of any suspected viral etiology.\n\nPlease contact the lab (515-337-7266) prior to submitting primate samples and provide the tracking number of the shipment. Having prior notice will help ensure proper handling and the safety of our staff. This policy does not apply to Salmonella cultures originating from primates, which may be sent without prior notification.\n\nThe selection and submission of materials collected in the field will vary according to the type and extent of laboratory support desired by the submitter. Contact the NVSL for assistance determining the type of samples to collect.\n\nAvian Sample Collection for Influenza A and Newcastle Disease (350.55 KB) (2023)\n\nCollecting Samples for Diagnostic Unknowns\n\nNot all cases of an exotic disease run a typical course or have classical lesions. In addition, insidious disease forms may enter a susceptible population and spread without notice because they do not show the expected clinical picture. Therefore, a comprehensive collection of specimens is the most useful in providing a diagnosis. View a Table of Specimen Collection, which is intended to supply the field diagnostician with lists of specimens for various animal species. The specimen listings are minimum recommended lists, designed to include samples necessary for diagnostic confirmation of foreign animal diseases for each of the animal species, as well as the differential diagnosis of domestic diseases that might be confused with a foreign animal disease. The lists are not intended to replace the field diagnostician's judgment concerning the collection of additional specimens.\n\nGeneral Guidelines for Necropsy (91.38 KB)\n\nDisease-Specific Guide to Sample Collectionâ€” (174.69 KB)Foreign Animal Diseases (2022)\n\nProcedures Manual for BSE Ongoing Surveillance Plan (2.58 MB)\n\nMaterial Safety Data Sheets for Sample Media Provided by the NVSL\n\nSampling Materials and Shipping Kits for Program Diseases (authorized personnel only):\n\nRequest Form (242.4 KB)\n\nNVSL Kit and Instrument Catalog"
