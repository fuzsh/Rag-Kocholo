        "text": "What do the project Activity Levels mean?\n\nThe physical fitness levels listed below are guidelines only.\n\nPlease refer to the specific project conditions and physical demands as described in the Essential Eligibility Requirements included in the Online Expedition Briefing. These basic physical and thinking abilities are needed to fully and safely participate in the program and are intended to help you decide if you can safely participate. Participants on all projects must be able to follow verbal and/or visual instructions independently or with the assistance of a companion.\n\nMany of our expeditions occur in challenging climate/environmental conditions that can greatly intensify the fitness required for a given project. For example, conditions may include extreme heat/humidity, high altitude, aridness, extreme cold, etc. Please be sure to review the Project Conditions carefully with this in mind.\n\nVery Easy\n\nMust be able to walk up to 1 mile/day (1.6 km) over flat terrain. Must be able to remain seated (whether on the ground, in a chair, vehicle, or boat, depending on the project) for extended periods; must be able to get up/down from a seated position. The ability to stoop, bend, or kneel is often required. Dexterity is often required.\n\nEasy\n\nSome walking over uneven ground or small hills must be able to walk up to 3 miles/day (5 km) with personal supplies up to 5 lbs. (2.3 kg). The ability to repeatedly stoop, bend, or kneel is often required. Dexterity, mobility, and good balance are required.\n\nFor water-based projects, one must be able to swim or tread water for 5 minutes unaided by fins or a buoyancy device.\n\nModerate\n\nMust be able to walk, possibly in sand or uphill, with a light pack up to 5 miles/day (8 km); must be able to carry equipment weighing up to 10 lbs. (4.5 kg). The ability to stoop, bend, or kneel is often required. Dexterity, agility, and good balance are required.\n\nFor water-based projects, one must be able to swim at least 110 yards (100 m) unaided by a buoyancy device or fins.\n\nVery Active\n\nMust be able to walk up to 10 miles/day (16 km) for several days in a row, possibly off-trail, over uneven terrain, in sand or uphill, climbing over rocks or other obstacles, and/or at high altitude; must be able to carry equipment weighing up to 20 lbs. (9 kg). Dexterity, agility, and good balance are required. Must be able to move quickly if needed.\n\nFor water-based projects, one must be able to swim at least 220 yards feet (200 m) unaided by a buoyancy device or fins.\n\nFor snorkel/scuba projects, one must be able to surface dive up to 15 feet (4.6 m) multiple times per day or perform two dives per day at no more than 60 feet (18 m).\n\nStrenuous\n\nMust be able to hike up to 15 miles/day (25 km) for several days in a row, possibly in backcountry and/or uphill, over uneven terrain or in sand, climbing over rocks or other obstacles, and/or at high altitude; must be able to carry equipment weighing up to 40 lbs. (18 kg). Dexterity, agility, stamina, and good balance are required.\n\nFor water-based projects, one must be able to swim at least 550 yards (500 m) unaided by buoyancy, a device, or fins.\n\nFor snorkel/scuba projects, one must be able to surface dive up to 15 feet (4.6 m) consistently throughout the day or perform two dives per day at no more than 60 feet (18 m).\n\nVaries\n\nSome projects may be able to accommodate varying levels of fitness due to some activities being more or less strenuous than others on the same project. Please refer to the project description, including the Essential Eligibility Requirements, or contact Earthwatch for additional information about the research activities and fitness required."
