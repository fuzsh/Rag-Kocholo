(NASDAQ: CORZ), a leader in digital infrastructure for bitcoin mining and HPC, today announced financial results for the fiscal second quarter of 2024. Net loss was $804.9 million, as compared to a net loss of $9.3 million for the same period in 2023. Total revenue was $141.1 million, as compared to $126.9 million for the same period last year. Operating income was $6.6 million, as compared to $9.5 million for the same period in 2023. Adjusted EBITDA was $46.0 million, as compared to $45.0 million for the same period in the prior year. Second quarter Net loss resulted from a net $796 million mark-to-market adjustment in the value of our tranche 1 and tranche 2 warrants and other contingent value rights required as a result of the significant quarter-over-quarter increase in the value of our equity.\n\n“We continue to demonstrate progress on the execution of our strategy to maximize the value of our high-power digital infrastructure portfolio through bitcoin mining and high-performance computing,” said Adam Sullivan, Core Scientific Chief Executive Officer. “Key achievements in and after the quarter include successfully navigating the April halving and emerging with favorable quarterly cash cost to mine of approximately $29,900 per bitcoin, converting $260 million in convertible notes during and shortly after the end of the quarter, commencing HPC hosting operations and revenue generation at our 16-megawatt Austin data center, and signing long-term contracts to host 382 megawatts of high-performance computing with our current client. These long-term contracts represent total potential revenue of approximately $6.7 billion over 12 years.”\n\n“Our highly experienced digital infrastructure team is preparing to modify several of our data centers to support HPC hosting, including working diligently to address supply chain challenges as they emerge. We also continue discussions with our existing client and other counterparties to contract our remaining 118 megawatts of infrastructure for HPC hosting while we work to execute on our pipeline of opportunities to increase our 1,200 MW of contracted power. We are building meaningful momentum in each of our businesses as we enter the second half of the year and believe we are well positioned to drive continued value creation for our shareholders,” Mr. Sullivan added.\n\nFiscal Second Quarter Financial and Operational Achievements\n\nTotal revenue of $141.1 million, an increase of $14.2 million over second quarter 2023\n\nNet loss of $804.9 million, an increase of $795.6 million over second quarter 2023\n\nOperating income of $6.6 million, a decrease of $2.9 million over second quarter 2023\n\nAdjusted EBITDA of $46.0 million, an increase of $1.0 million over second quarter 2023\n\nCash and cash equivalents of $96.1 million as of June 30, 2024\n\nAdditional 72 megawatts of infrastructure completed at Denton, Texas data center, expanding operational infrastructure to approximately 830 megawatts\n\nVoluntary conversion of $26.4 million in convertible notes, with the mandatory conversion of the remaining $233.6 million in convertible notes outstanding shortly after the end of the second quarter\n\nOperated total hash rate of 24.6 EH/s, consisting of 19.4 EH/s self-mining and 5.2 EH/s hosting\n\nImproved average actual self-mining fleet energy efficiency to 24.7 joules per terahash\n\nStrengthened the balance sheet, ending the quarter with $96.1 million in cash and cash equivalents\n\nFiscal Second Quarter 2024 Financial Results (Compared to Fiscal Second Quarter 2023)\n\nTotal revenue for the fiscal second quarter of 2024 was $141.1 million, and consisted of $110.7 million in digital asset self-mining revenue, $24.8 million in digital asset hosted mining revenue and $5.5 million in HPC hosting revenue.\n\nDigital asset self-mining revenue in excess of mining cost of revenue for the fiscal second quarter of 2024 was $30.7 million (28% gross margin), as compared to $30.2 million (31% gross margin) for the same period in the prior year, an increase of $0.5 million. The increase in Digital asset self-mining revenue in excess of Digital asset mining cost of revenue was driven by a 134% increase in the price of bitcoin, a 28% increase in our self-mining hash rate and an increase in the number of mining units deployed, offset by the 52% decrease in bitcoin mined due to the halving and higher network difficulty.\n\nDigital asset hosted mining revenue in excess of hosting cost of revenue for the fiscal second quarter of 2024 was $7.4 million (30% gross margin), as compared to $6.7 million (23% gross margin) for the same period in the prior year, an increase of $0.7 million. The increase in Digital asset hosted mining revenue in excess of Digital asset hosted mining cost of revenue was primarily due to a larger share of more profitable hosting arrangements.\n\nHPC hosting revenue in excess of HPC hosting cost of revenue for the fiscal second quarter of 2024 was $0.6 million (11% gross margin). HPC hosting started operations during the fiscal second quarter of 2024.

You can identify forward-looking statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. These statements may include words such as “aim,” “estimate,” “plan,” “project,” “forecast,” “goal,” “intend,” “will,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “seek,” “target” or other similar expressions that predict or indicate future events or trends or that are not statements of historical matters. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially, including: our ability to earn digital assets profitably and to attract customers for our digital asset and high performance compute hosting capabilities; our ability to perform under our existing colocation agreements, our ability to maintain our competitive position in our existing operating segments, the impact of increases in total network hash rate; our ability to raise additional capital to continue our expansion efforts or other operations; our need for significant electric power and the limited availability of power resources; the potential failure in our critical systems, facilities or services we provide; the physical risks and regulatory changes relating to climate change; potential significant changes to the method of validating blockchain transactions; our vulnerability to physical security breaches, which could disrupt our operations; a potential slowdown in market and economic conditions, particularly those impacting high performance computing, the blockchain industry and the blockchain hosting market; the identification of material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting; price volatility of digital assets and bitcoin in particular; the “halving” of rewards available on the Bitcoin network, affecting our ability to generate revenue; the potential that insufficient awards from digital asset mining could disincentivize transaction processors from expending processing power on a particular network, which could negatively impact the utility of the network and further reduce the value of its digital assets; the requirements of our existing debt agreements for us to sell our digital assets earned from mining as they are received, preventing us from recognizing any gain from appreciation in the value of the digital assets we hold; potential changes in the interpretive positions of the SEC or its staff with respect to digital asset mining firms; the increasing likelihood that U.S. federal and state legislatures and regulatory agencies will enact laws and regulations to regulate digital assets and digital asset intermediaries; increasing scrutiny and changing expectations with respect to our ESG policies; the effectiveness of our compliance and risk management methods; the adequacy of our sources of recovery if the digital assets held by us are lost, stolen or destroyed due to third-party digital asset services; the effects of our emergence from bankruptcy and our substantial level of indebtedness and our current liquidity constraints affecting our financial condition and ability to service our indebtedness.
