        "text": "Updated 11/3/22: Information about the biosafety level requirements for handling SAR-CoV-2 (COVID-19 coronavirus) can be found here.\n\nSafety is of the utmost importance in any laboratory setting, especially when working with autoclaving equipment. In order to ensure the safety of lab personnel, the environment and surrounding communities, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have defined biosafety levels — each with corresponding safety protocols — for different types of facilities.\n\nIn this blog post, we’ll explain what those biosafety levels are, how they’re defined, what precautionary measures lab workers need to take for each level, and more.\n\nWhat Are Biosafety Levels?\n\nBiological safety levels — often abbreviated to biosafety levels or BSL — are a series of protections specific to autoclave-related activities that take place in biological labs. Biosafety levels are individual safeguards designed to protect laboratory personnel, as well as the surrounding environment and community.\n\nDownload our BSL Quick Reference Guide Here >\n\nThese levels, which are ranked from one to four, are designated based on the agents or organisms laboratory personnel are researching or working on. For example, a basic lab setting that specializes in the research of non-lethal agents that pose minimal threat to lab workers and the environment would generally be considered BS-1, which is the lowest biosafety level. By way of comparison, a research laboratory that specializes in handling potentially deadly infectious agents, such as the Ebola virus, would be designated as a BSL-4 lab — the highest and most stringent biosafety level.\n\nHow Are Biosafety Levels Defined?\n\nThe CDC sets biosafety levels to indicate what specific controls a laboratory must have in place for the containment of microbes and biological agents. Each biosafety level builds upon the previous level, thereby creating layer upon layer of constraints and barriers.\n\nEach biosafety level — BSL-1 through BSL-4 — is defined based on the following:\n\nRisks related to containment\n\nSeverity of infection\n\nTransmissibility\n\nNature of the work conducted within the lab\n\nOrigin of the microbe\n\nAgent in question\n\nRoute of exposure\n\nBiosafety levels dictate the types of work practices allowed to take place in a lab setting; they also heavily influence the overall design of a facility and the type of specialized safety equipment in it.\n\nGet Your Safety Tips Checklist for BSL Labs 1-4 Here >\n\nBiosafety Level 1 (BSL-1)\n\nThe lowest of the four biosafety levels, biosafety level 1 (BSL-1) applies to laboratory settings in which personnel work with low-risk microbes that pose little to no threat of infection in healthy adults — for example, a BSL-1 laboratory might work with a nonpathogenic strain of E.coli. BSL-1 labs typically conduct research on benches, do not use special contaminant equipment, and do not need to be isolated from surrounding facilities.\n\nSafety protocols for biosafety level 1 labs — which require only standard microbial practices — include:\n\nMechanical pipetting (no mouth pipetting allowed)\n\nSafe sharps handling\n\nAvoidance of splashes or aerosols\n\nDaily decontamination of all work surfaces when work is complete\n\nRegular handwashing\n\nProhibition of food, drink, and smoking materials\n\nThe use of personal protective equipment (PPE), such as goggles, gloves, and a lab coat or gown\n\nBiohazard signs\n\nBSL-1 labs also require immediate decontamination after spills. Infectious materials should also be decontaminated prior to disposal, generally through the use of an autoclave.\n\nBiosafety Level 2 (BSL-2)\n\nBiosafety level 2 (BSL-2) covers all laboratories that work with agents associated with human diseases — that is, pathogenic or infectious organisms — that pose a moderate health hazard. Common examples of agents found in a BSL-2 lab include equine encephalitis viruses, HIV, and staphylococcus aureus (staph infections).\n\nBSL-2 labs are required to maintain the same standard microbial practices as BSL-1 labs, as well as enhanced measures due to the potential risk the aforementioned microbes pose. Personnel working in biosafety level 2 laboratories are expected to take even greater care to prevent injuries, such as cuts and other breakage to the skin, as well as ingestion and mucous membrane exposures.\n\nIn addition to the safety protocols established for BSL-1 labs, BSL-2 labs are subject to the following safety controls:\n\nThe use of PPE, including lab coats, gloves, eye protection, and — in some cases — face shields\n\nAll procedures that could cause infection from aerosols or splashes must be performed within a biological safety cabinet.\n\nDecontamination of infectious materials prior to disposal, generally through the use of an autoclave\n\nSelf-closing, lockable doors\n\nAccess to a sink and eyewash station\n\nBiohazard warning signs\n\nAccess to a biosafety level 2 lab is far more restrictive than to a biosafety level 1 lab. Outside personnel, or those with an increased risk of contamination, are often restricted from entering the area while work is underway.\n\nGet our BSL Quick Reference & Safety Tips Guide Here >\n\nBiosafety Level 3 (BSL-3)\n\nOnce again building on the two prior biosafety levels, a biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) laboratory typically conducts research into or work on microbes that are either indigenous or exotic and can cause serious or potentially lethal disease through inhalation. Common examples of microbes found in BSL-3 labs include yellow fever, West Nile virus, and the bacteria that causes tuberculosis.\n\nMicrobes found within biosafety level 3 settings are so serious that work is often strictly controlled and registered through the appropriate government agencies. Laboratory personnel are also under medical surveillance and may require immunizations for the microbes they work with.\n\nCommon safety controls within a BSL-3 lab include:\n\nThe use of PPE, including goggles and gloves; respirators may also be required\n\nThe use of solid-front wraparound gowns, scrub suits, and/or coveralls is often required\n\nAccess to a hands-free sink and eyewash station available near the exit\n\nSustained directional airflow to draw air into the laboratory from clean areas toward potentially contaminated areas (exhaust air cannot be recirculated)\n\nSelf-closing set of locking doors with access away from general building corridors\n\nAccess to a BSL-3 laboratory is restricted and controlled at all times.\n\nBiosafety Level 4 (BSL-4)\n\nBiosafety level 4 (BSL-4) labs are rare; however, a small number exist in the U.S. and around the world. As the highest level of biological safety, BSL-4 labs work with highly dangerous and exotic microbes, such as the Ebola and Marburg viruses. Infections caused by these types of microbes are often fatal and come without treatment or vaccines.\n\nIn addition to biosafety level 3 considerations, biosafety level 4 laboratories must follow these safety protocols:\n\nPersonnel must change clothing before entering the facility and shower upon exiting\n\nAll materials must be decontaminated before leaving the facility\n\nPersonnel must wear the PPE from lower BSL levels, as well as a full-body, air-supplied, positive pressure suit\n\nAccess to a Class III biological safety cabinet\n\nBSL-4 labs are extremely isolated, often located in an isolated and restricted zone of a building or in a separate building entirely. BSL-4 labs also feature a dedicated supply of exhaust air, as well as vacuum lines and decontamination systems.\n\nGet our BSL Quick Reference & Safety Tips Guide Here >\n\nWhat Are the Differences Between Biosafety Levels?\n\nKnowing the difference between biosafety levels and their corresponding safety requirements is imperative for anyone working with microbes in a lab setting; readers can use the chart below as a quick reference guide.\n\nBiosafety Level BSL-1 BSL-2 BSL-3 BSL-4 Description\n\n– No containment\n\n– Defined Organisms\n\n– Unlikely to cause disease\n\n– Containment\n\n– Moderate Risk\n\n– Disease of varying severity\n\n– High Containment\n\n– Aerosol Transmission\n\n– Serous/Potentially lethal disease\n\n– Max Containment\n\n– “Exotic”, High-Risk Agents\n\n– Life-threatening disease\n\nSample Organisms E.Coli Influenza, HIV, Lyme Disease Tuberculosis Ebola Virus Pathogen Type Agents present minimal potential hazard to personnel & the environment. Agents associated with human disease & post moderate hazards to personnel & the environment Indigenous or exotic agents, agents that present a potential for aerosol transmission, & agents causing serious or potentially lethal disease. Dangerous & exotic agents that post a high risk of aerosol-transmitted laboratory infections & life-threatening disease.
