        "text": "CoolLED Limited, a UK-based manufacturer of LED fluorescence illumination products is delighted to announce that Prior Scientific, specialists in scientific instrumentation, microscope automation and optical microscopy has chosen CoolLED as their OEM partner in a collaborative enterprise to satisfy Prior’s customers’ requirements for LED illumination. Response to this collaboration has been exceptional and continues to grow.\n\nCoolLED was the first to introduce a commercially-available LED illumination unit for fluorescence microscopy and continues to develop products for the Life Sciences and other markets. Recent developments in the application of LED technology have resulted in illumination systems offering increased brightness for fluorescence microscopy. As well as requiring intensities to excite common fluorophores such as DAPI, FITC and the growing range of RFPs, the ability to excite into the ultra violet (UV) and near infra-red (NIR) is both desirable and becoming possible. CoolLED is meeting these demands with its new generation of LED illumination systems – click here for further information."
