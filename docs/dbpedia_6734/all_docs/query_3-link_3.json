        "text": "Robert Hooke began his education at home, where he was taught by his father. After his father died when he was 13, Hooke apprenticed himself to an important portrait painter. In this apprenticeship, he learned the artistic skills he would later use to create the illustrations in Micrographia. He left his apprenticeship to attend an elite preparatory school in London followed by Oxford University.\n\nAfter university, Hooke wanted to join The Royal Society, a new London-based group dedicated to natural knowledge (a precursor to scientific thinking). While Hooke’s inheritance paid for his schooling, he did not have the same access to generational wealth as his peers. Because he was not wealthy, he was not accepted as an equal by the members of the Royal Society. Despite not being considered a social or professional equal, Hooke’s scientific abilities were recognized by the members of the Royal Society, and he became their curator of experiments. He was asked to give microscopy demonstrations to the society. The drawings he created during these demonstrations were the starting point for his microscopic illustrations.\n\nLike most people in England at that time, Hooke was Christian and his religious beliefs influenced his approach to science. Hooke was motivated by discovering new details about God’s original design of the natural world. Hooke’s approach to science is part natural history and part theology (the study of God).\n\nNo known portraits of Hooke survive. The only visual images we have of Hooke’s physical body are the microscopic samples he included in Micrographia, such as the close up of his hair.\n\nRobert Hooke did not invent the microscope, and he was not the first person to publish observations made with the help of a microscope. Microscopes were invented about 50 years before Hooke began his observations, and Hooke built on the early work that had been done with microscopes. While microscopes had been around for a half century, Hooke popularized the use of microscopes to help with the systematic study of nature.\n\nThe microscopes Hooke used were compound instruments with two lenses. The smaller lens was placed near the specimen and the longer lens was placed near the observer’s eye. The degree of magnification (how much bigger the specimen appeared) depended on the focal lengths of the two lenses and how they were matched. With good lenses, these microscopes could magnify to several hundred times the original size. Most microscopes Hooke had access to magnified to about one hundred times the original size.\n\nThese microscopes were difficult to use. Adjusting the telescope to focus was a challenge, especially when trying to focus on three-dimensional objects like Hooke was. Even when focused well, these microscopes produced distorted images. It required a high degree of technical skill to operate these microscopes, a high degree of expertise to correctly interpret the images, and a high degree of artistic skill to accurately translate the observations to paper."
