        "text": "IRVINE, Calif., Aug. 8, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Interlink Electronics, Inc. (Nasdaq: LINK), a world-leading provider of sensors and printed electronic solutions that support a wide range of applications including Human-Machine Interface devices and Internet-of-Things solutions, today announced its financial results for the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2024.\n\nRevenue for the quarter was approximately $2.9 million, down 28% from the prior year period due to lower shipments of our traditional force-sensor products and gas-sensor products, offset in part by higher sales of our membrane keypads, graphic overlays, printed electronics and industrial label products at our Calman Technology Limited subsidiary, acquired in March 2023. The change in our sales and product mix impacted our gross margin, which was 45.0% for the current quarter compared to 50.9% in the prior-year quarter.\n\nThe following table sets forth the consolidated financial highlights.\n\nRevenue for the second quarter of 2024 decreased 28% to $2.9 million from $4.0 million for the same quarter last year, and decreased 18% to $6.0 million for the first half of 2024 compared to $7.3 million for the first half of 2023, due primarily to lower shipments of our traditional force-sensor products and gas-sensor products, offset in part by the inclusion of sales of our printed electronics products at our Calman Technology subsidiary (acquired in March 2023). Our revenues for a particular period are impacted by fluctuations in the timing of receipt and fulfilment of customer orders, which varies based on their demand for their own order-flow and production cycles. Our robust pipeline of prospective customers and orders includes several large force-sensor and gas-sensor opportunities, and we continue to expand our product offerings, particularly for air quality solutions and instruments in our gas sensors business, all of which provide the potential for organic revenue growth for 2025.\n\nGross profit margin for the second quarter was 45.0%, down from 50.9% in the prior-year, and for the first half was 42.5%, down from 49.8% last year, due primarily to the decline in revenue and changes in the mix of products sold. Gross profit margin for the second quarter of 2024 was up 490 basis points sequentially from the first quarter of 2024 due to production efficiencies and favorable changes in the mix of our products sold.\n\nNet income/loss for the quarter was a loss of $307,000, compared with net income of $381,000 for the same quarter last year. Net income/loss for the first half of 2024 was a loss of $1,048,000, compared with income of $190,000 for the same period last year. The increases in net loss were due primarily to lower gross profit on lower revenue, together with increased intangible asset amortization expense from the recent acquisitions of Calman Technology, SPEC Sensors, and KWJ Engineering, offset in part by reduced compensation cost on reduced headcount and lower professional services expenses. We have recently implemented various cost reduction initiatives that we expect will result in annual cost savings in excess of $500,000, including work-force right-sizing, changes in certain suppliers and selected inventories and supplies, and deferring certain non-critical operating activities and initiatives.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA for the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2024 were ($80,000) and ($588,000), respectively, as compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $579,000 and $452,000 for the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2023, respectively.\n\nIn order to position us for future growth, we are expanding our operations and footprint, including:\n\nRecent launch of our strategic executive office in Bellevue, WA\n\nRecent launch of our new Silicon Valley R&D center in Fremont, CA, expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2024\n\nPlans to open a European sales office led by a seasoned Business Development Manager by year-end\n\nWe ended the quarter with $4.0 million of cash and cash equivalents.\n\n\"In spite of a slowdown in demand from several existing customers, we continue to execute our long-term strategic growth plans,\" said Steven N. Bronson, Chairman, President, and CEO of Interlink Electronics. \"We are placing a great emphasis on product development and sales resources to drive future organic growth.\"\n\nAbout Interlink Electronics, Inc.\n\nInterlink Electronics is a world-leading provider of sensors and printed electronic solutions that support a wide range of applications, including Human-Machine Interface (\"HMI\") devices and Internet-of-Things (\"IoT\") solutions, utilizing our expertise in materials science, manufacturing, firmware and software to produce in-house system solutions for custom specifications.
