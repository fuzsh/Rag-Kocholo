        "text": "August 8, 2024\n\nSecond Quarter 2024 Highlights and Financial Results\n\n• Patrick Kivits joined Sealed Air as Chief Executive Officer\n\n• Dustin Semach promoted to President and Chief Financial Officer\n\n• Volume growth in Food driven by strong end-market demand\n\n• Protective volume weakness now expected to persist throughout 2024 into 2025\n\n• CTO2Grow on track to generate $90 million of incremental cost savings for full-year 2024\n\n• Strong generation of cash flow from operations and continued debt reduction\n\nSealed Air Corporation (NYSE: SEE) announced second quarter 2024 financial results and business updates.\n\n“Our second quarter results were ahead of our expectations, reflecting strong sequential demand within our Food business, accelerated benefits from our CTO2Grow program that more than offset the continued pressure within our Protective business,” said Patrick Kivits, Sealed Air’s CEO. \"I have joined Sealed Air at a pivotal time in its journey. I plan on accelerating the transformation that began eight months ago to restore business fundamentals and drive long-term sustainable growth. Our people are at the center of this transformation and I want to express my appreciation for their commitment to Sealed Air and our customers. I am excited about the opportunities ahead of us.\"\n\n“For the remainder of the year, our Food businesses’ performance is being offset by weaker than expected volumes within Protective. At this time, we do not see a catalyst for the volumes to inflect in Protective and expect this trend to continue into 2025,“ said Dustin Semach, Sealed Air's President and CFO. “We delivered strong free cash flow in the first half and continued to strengthen the balance sheet, putting us ahead of pace for free cash flow generation for the full year.\"\n\nSecond Quarter 2024 Financial Highlights\n\nNet sales of $1.35 billion decreased 3% as reported, with EMEA decreasing 5%, APAC decreasing 3% and the Americas decreasing 2%. Net sales decreased $24 million, or 2%, on a constant dollar basis. Price had an unfavorable impact of $41 million, or 3%. Volumes increased by $18 million, or 1%.\n\nIncome tax expense was $38 million, resulting in an effective tax rate of 27.8% in the quarter. This compares to an income tax expense of $45 million in the prior year, or an effective tax rate of 32.5%. The lower effective tax rate is primarily driven by lower accruals for uncertain tax positions in the current year. The Adjusted Tax Rate was 25.5% in the quarter, as compared to 26.9% in the prior year.\n\nNet earnings were $98 million, or $0.67 per diluted share, as compared to net earnings of $94 million, or $0.65 per diluted share in the prior year. The current year results were impacted by $27 million of Special Items expense, including $9 million of restructuring and other associated costs related to the cost take-out to grow program (\"CTO2Grow Program\"), $8 million related to the amortization of Liquibox intangible assets and $7 million loss on debt redemption and refinancing activities. The prior year results were impacted by $19 million of Special Items expense, primarily related to the Liquibox acquisition. Adjusted earnings per diluted share increased to $0.83, from $0.80 in the prior year, primarily due to higher Adjusted EBITDA and lower interest expense, partially offset by higher depreciation and amortization.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA was $285 million, or 21.2% of net sales, as compared to $280 million, or 20.3% in the prior year. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to lower operating costs driven by productivity benefits as a result of the CTO2Grow Program and higher volumes, partially offset by unfavorable net price realization.\n\nBusiness Segment Highlights\n\nSecond quarter net sales in Food were $894 million, an increase of 2% as reported. Currency fluctuations had an unfavorable impact of $7 million, or 1%. On a constant dollar basis, net sales increased $21 million, or 2%. Volumes increased $47 million, or 5%, with growth in all regions driven by strength in end-market demand and share gains within our case ready solutions. Price had an unfavorable impact of $26 million, or 3%. Adjusted EBITDA of $205 million, or 22.9% of net sales, increased 7% from $191 million, or 21.7% of net sales. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily attributable to higher volumes.\n\nSecond quarter net sales in Protective were $451 million, a decrease of 10% as reported. Currency fluctuations had an unfavorable impact of $4 million, or 1%. On a constant dollar basis, net sales decreased $44 million, or 9%. Volumes decreased $29 million, or 6%, resulting from a slowdown in automation sales and continued weakness in our industrial and fulfillment portfolios. Price had an unfavorable impact of $15 million, or 3%. Adjusted EBITDA of $82 million, or 18.1% of net sales, decreased 15% from $96 million, or 19.2% of net sales. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily attributable to lower volumes and unfavorable net price realization, partially offset by lower operating costs driven by productivity benefits, including our CTO2Grow Program.\n\nCash Flow and Net Debt\n\nCash flow from operating activities during the first six months of 2024 was a source of $313 million, as compared to a use of $7 million during the prior year period, which included a $175 million tax deposit.\n\nCapital expenditures in the first six months of 2024 were $106 million, as compared to $124 million during the prior year period. Free Cash Flow, defined as net cash from operating activities less capital expenditures, was a source of $207 million for the first six months of 2024, as compared to a use of $130 million during the prior year period. Excluding the $175 million tax deposit, Free Cash Flow was a source of $45 million for the first six months of 2023.\n\nDividend payments for the first six months of both 2024 and 2023 were $60 million.\n\nTotal debt was $4.6 billion as of June 30, 2024 and $4.7 billion as of December 31, 2023. Net Debt, defined as total debt less cash and cash equivalents, was $4.2 billion as of June 30, 2024 and $4.3 billion as of December 31, 2023. As of June 30, 2024, SEE had approximately $1.4 billion of available liquidity comprised of $389 million of cash and $1.0 billion of available and unused lines of credit under our committed credit facilities. The net leverage ratio, defined as net debt divided by last twelve months Adjusted EBITDA, decreased to 3.8x as of June 30, 2024 as compared to 3.9x as of December 31, 2023.\n\n2024 Full Year and Q3 Outlook\n\n2024 Outlook\n\nNet Sales $1.33 billion\n\nFull-year $5.2 to 5.6 billion\n\nAdjusted EBITDA $265 million\n\nFull-year $1.05 to $1.15 billion\n\nAdjusted EPS $0.67\n\nFull-year $2.65 to $3.05\n\nFree Cash Flow\n\nFull-year $325 to $425 million\n\nAdjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EPS and Free Cash Flow are non-GAAP financial measures. We have not provided guidance for the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, as they are not available without unreasonable effort due to the high variability, complexity and low visibility of certain Special Items.\n\nConference Call Information\n\nSealed Air Corporation will host a conference call and webcast on Thursday, August 8, 2024 at 10:00 a.m. (ET) to discuss our Second Quarter 2024 Results.
