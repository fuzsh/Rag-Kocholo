A motorized offset lens allows real-time adjustment of the imaging depth into the sample, continuously holding the precise distance between imaging focal point and a reference boundary of choice.\n\nThe PureFocus850 is easily adaptable to any optical system, it is suitable to both upright and inverted microscopes. The patent pending PureFocus850 system allows powerful automated autofocus functionality to be added to existing microscope systems by installing the unit into the infinity space (between objective and tube lens). The PureFocus850 is an integrated unit comprising of an IR laser diode, precision optical components, detector and signal processing electronics with on-board micro controller. Outputs directly drive a step motor or provides output for servo or Piezo drives.\n\nWith the ability to autofocus on different interfaces including slides, glass bottom dishes, flow chambers and many more.\n\nFeatures\n\nHigh speed – 1ms typical response time\n\nSoftware setup program provided\n\nSimple dichroic adjustment for easy install\n\n850 nanometer diode laser\n\nIntegrated stepper motor driver and interface to Piezo and other actuators via 0-10V analogue output\n\nConfigurable for multiple objectives and sample types\n\nCompensates for microscope drift\n\nWorks with both upright & inverted optical systems\n\nBenefits\n\nFast and easy to setup system and start focusing\n\nEasy to mount in infinity path\n\nNo color shift; outside the visible light range\n\nOutside the emission of most fluorophores\n\nWorks with your existing optical system\n\nEasy to change parameters via PC command or keypad\n\nMarket leading system to reliably focus on slides and well plates\n\nMaintain in focus images for long term studies"
