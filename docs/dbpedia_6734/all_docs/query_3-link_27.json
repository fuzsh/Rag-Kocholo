        "text": "Instrument Selection and Use\n\nInstruments used for rodent surgery are delicate and typically designed for a specific function. Incorrect use of these instruments will damage them and make it difficult, if not impossible, to use them correctly. For example, hemostatic forceps are designed to grasp and hold tissue such as blood vessels or skin. While they can be used to hold a needle for suturing in an emergency, routine use of hemostatic forceps instead of a surgical needleholder is not recommended. These forceps are not designed to securely grasp the needle and using them for suturing will damage the tips making them useless for their intended purpose. Instruments should also be of the appropriate size for rodent surgery. Using instruments that are too large will exaggerate hand motions and decrease surgical precision resulting in poor technique and increased tissue trauma.\n\nIt has been reported that repeated use of glass bead sterilizers will make instruments brittle and dull over time. Any instrument that is used frequently, handled roughly or cleaned with abrasive materials can be damaged or dulled. Instruments should be assessed on a regular basis and replaced when necessary. Scissors and other sharp instruments can sometimes be re-sharpened to prolong life. Instruments must be gently cleaned after each use to ensure that all blood and tissue is removed. An ultrasonic cleaner can assist in this process. Proper care will extend the life of your instruments and help preserve your investment.\n\nReference:\n\nHow to Select and Procure Surgical Instrumentation for Rodent Surgical Research. 2012. S Baran, E Johnson, and M Perret-Gentil. ALN Magazine.\n\nInstrument Sterilization\n\nPrior to surgery, instruments and other supplies are placed in a ‘surgical pack’. The surgical pack must not only hold the instruments and supplies during the sterilization process, but also maintain the sterility of the contents until used in surgery. A variety of packing methods exists, including:\n\nInstruments, with or without an instrument tray, are packed inside a folded cloth or paper wrap and sealed with tape designed to indicate when sterilization has been achieved. Other types of sterilization indicators may be placed inside the pack.\n\nPeel packs –self-sealing ‘envelopes’ used for steam or gas sterilization. A sterilization indicator is included on the envelope.\n\nKeeping Instruments Sterile During Surgery\n\nUse an extra piece of sterile drape material or the inside of the surgical wrap or envelope as a sterile space to place instruments during surgery. One of the most common errors for an inexperienced surgeon is setting instruments down on an unsterile surface.\n\nSterilization Procedures\n\nSurgical instruments and other material or equipment that will contact the surgical site must be sterile prior to use. The process of sterilization kills all forms of life, including bacterial spores and viruses. Chemical disinfection is not the same as sterilization and is not acceptable as the primary method of instrument preparation for surgery. Methods of instrument sterilization include steam (autoclave) and gas (ethylene oxide) sterilization. Dry heat sterilization using a glass bead sterilizer is not acceptable for initial sterilization of instruments prior to surgery but may be used during ‘batch’ surgeries.\n\nSteam Sterilization\n\nSteam or autoclave sterilization is the most common method of instrument sterilization.\n\nInstruments are placed in a surgical pack and exposed to steam under pressure.\n\nA sterilization indicator (required) such as autoclave tape or an indicator strip is used to identify instruments that have been sterilized.\n\nEthylene Oxide\n\nEthylene oxide gas is used to sterilize items that cannot withstand the high temperature and steam of an autoclave.\n\nEthylene oxide is highly toxic. Items sterilized with ethylene oxide must be aerated before use to allow the gas to dissipate.\n\nGlass Bead Sterilizers:\n\nGlass bead sterilizers may be used to re-sterilize instruments during a surgical procedure but are not acceptable as an initial method of sterilization.\n\nGlass bead sterilizers have a central well filled with glass beads heated to high temperature (approximately 5000F).\n\nAfter removal of blood and tissue, the tips of surgical instruments are placed into the hot glass beads for approximately 10-15 seconds.\n\nOnly the tips of the instruments are re-sterilized in this process.\n\nInstrument tips become extremely hot and must be cooled before use.\n\nGlass bead sterilizers may be used between animals when one set of initially autoclaved instruments is used on a group of up to 5 animals.\n\nReusing Instruments\n\nWhen surgical procedures are to be performed on multiple rodents, the same set of instruments may be used on more than one animal under the following conditions.\n\nThe instruments must be initially sterilized by autoclaving or gas sterilization.\n\nBlood and tissue particles on instrument tips must be removed using alcohol before placement in the glass bead sterilizer.\n\nThe tips of instruments must be placed in a hot bead sterilizer between animals.\n\nA new set of sterile instruments must be used after every 4-5 animals.\n\nIf the instrument tips have become contaminated by contact with a non-sterile surface or non-sterile portions of the body (such as contents of the gastrointestinal tract) a new sterile set of instruments must be used on subsequent animals.\n\nInstrument Tip Technique for Specific Rodent Surgical Procedures\n\nAlthough challenging, instrument tip technique may be useful for some rodent surgery situations. Generally, this is limited to surgeries in which incisions involve only the skin (no exposure or manipulation of internal organs). Keep the following points in mind when using “tips only” technique:\n\nPrior IACUC approval is required to use instrument tip technique in research rodents.\n\nThe animal must be maintained in a surgical plane of anesthesia throughout the procedure.\n\nBegin surgery with sterile instruments and handle them aseptically throughout the procedures.\n\nThe same set of pre-sterilized instruments may be used for up to five similar surgeries provided aseptic technique is followed throughout all procedures.\n\nSterile surgical gloves do not have to be worn if the following criteria are strictly adhered to:\n\nGloves are changed after completing the surgical scrub such that new clean gloves are donned at the beginning of the surgical procedure.\n\nThe gloved hands never touch the working (tip) end of the instruments, the suture, suture needle or any part of the prepped surgical field.\n\nOnly the sterile tips of the instruments are used to handle the animal’s tissues.\n\nOutline of procedures in “tips only” surgery"
