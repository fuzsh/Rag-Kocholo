Operating expenses for the second quarter of 2024 included a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $93.2 million due to, among other factors, the decline in PacBio’s stock price during the quarter, $13.4 million of restructuring expenses, and $4.2 million related to the amortization of acquired intangible assets. Operating expenses for the second quarter of 2024 and the second quarter of 2023 included non-cash share-based compensation of $16.1 million and $16.7 million, respectively.\n\nNet loss for the second quarter of 2024 was $173.3 million, compared to a net loss of $69.8 million for the second quarter of 2023.\n\nNet loss per share for the second quarter of 2024 was $0.64, compared to net loss per share of $0.28 for the second quarter of 2023.\n\nNet loss and net loss per share included $93.2 million of goodwill impairment charges, $18.0 million of restructuring expenses, and $6.9 million related to the amortization of acquired intangible assets.\n\nCash, cash equivalents, and investments, excluding short- and long-term restricted cash, at June 30, 2024, totaled $509.8 million, compared to $631.4 million at December 31, 2023.\n\nNon-GAAP second quarter results (see accompanying tables for reconciliations of GAAP and non-GAAP measures):\n\nNon-GAAP gross profit for the second quarter of 2024 was $13.2 million compared with $15.7 million for the second quarter of 2023 and a non-GAAP gross margin of 37% in the second quarter of 2024 compared to 33% for the second quarter of 2023.\n\nNon-GAAP operating expenses totaled $71.0 million for the second quarter of 2024, compared to $86.7 million for the second quarter of 2023.\n\nNon-GAAP net loss for the second quarter of 2024 was $55.2 million, compared to a non-GAAP net loss of $65.6 million for the second quarter of 2023.\n\nNon-GAAP net loss per share for the second quarter of 2024 was $0.20 compared to a non-GAAP net loss per share of $0.26 for the second quarter of 2023.\n\nUpdates since PacBio’s last earnings release\n\nAnnounced that Precision Health Research Singapore (PRECISE) has chosen the Revio HiFi sequencing system for Singapore’s Long-Read Sequencing Flagship Project aiming to generate the largest long-read sequencing dataset in Southeast Asia and marking a significant advancement for precision medicine in Singapore.\n\nDelivered multiple Revios to Quest Diagnostics to support Quest’s development of its tests for neurological disorders based on the advantages of our recently launched PureTarget repeat expansion panel.\n\nAnnounced that Ambry Genetics has joined the collaboration with the GREGoR consortium and the University of California, Irvine to sequence up to 7,000 long-read HiFi genomes over three years, advancing rare disease research.\n\nAnnounced that Novogene is using Revio to expand the capabilities of its new lab in Munich, Germany to help enable customers to scale their research across a broad range of applications including rare diseases, cancer, microbes, and agriculture in a cost-effective way.\n\nLaunched the first free, publicly available HiFi long-read variant frequency database with the Consortium for Long-Read Sequencing (CoLoRS), providing essential genetic variant data for rare disease researchers.\n\nImplemented PacBio Capital’s new Revio rental program with our leasing partner Mitsubishi HC Capital giving eligible U.S. based customers another option to bring Revio in-house with no upfront capital for just over $20,000 per month.\n\n“In the second quarter, we continued to see headwinds in the capital equipment market, particularly in Europe and Asia. However, there were several positive developments that give us increasing confidence that revenue will accelerate in the second half of this year and into 2025,” said Christian Henry, President and Chief Executive Officer. “For example, population genomic programs across the globe utilizing Revio are just getting started and hospitals and diagnostic companies are increasingly leveraging the comprehensive power of HiFi sequencing and adopting Revio in their clinical research programs. Operationally, we remain on track to reduce annual run rate expenses by more than $75 million without delaying the key product development programs that will drive revenue growth in 2025 and beyond.”\n\nQuarterly Conference Call Information\n\nManagement will host a quarterly conference call to discuss its second quarter ended June 30, 2024, results today at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time.

For more information, please visit www.pacb.com and follow @PacBio.\n\nPacBio products are provided for Research Use Only. Not for use in diagnostic procedures.\n\nStatement regarding use of non‐GAAP financial measures\n\nPacBio reports non‐GAAP results for basic and diluted net income and loss per share, net income, net loss, gross margins, gross profit and operating expenses in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or because it believes that such information is superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. PacBio believes that non-GAAP financial information, when taken collectively, may be helpful to investors because it provides consistency and comparability with past financial performance. However, non-GAAP financial information is presented for supplemental informational purposes only, has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP. In addition, other companies may calculate similarly titled non-GAAP measures differently or may use other measures to evaluate their performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of PacBio’s non-GAAP financial measures as tools for comparison.\n\nPacBio’s financial measures under GAAP include substantial charges that are listed in the itemized reconciliations between GAAP and non‐GAAP financial measures included in this press release. PacBio excludes recurring charges from its non-GAAP financial statements, including amortization of intangible assets, changes in fair value of contingent consideration and restructuring related expenses, and further excludes infrequent and limited charges including impairment charges and gains or losses on the extinguishment of debt. The amortization of acquired intangible assets excluded from GAAP financial measures relates to acquired intangible assets that were recorded as part of the purchase accounting during the year ended December 31, 2021. The amortization related to these intangible assets will occur in future periods until they are fully amortized.\n\nManagement has excluded the effects of these items in non‐GAAP measures to assist investors in analyzing and assessing past and future operating performance. In addition, management uses non-GAAP measures to compare PacBio’s performance relative to forecasts and strategic plans and to benchmark its performance externally against competitors.\n\nPacBio encourages investors to carefully consider its results under GAAP, as well as its supplemental non‐GAAP information and the reconciliation between these presentations, to more fully understand its business. A reconciliation of PacBio’s non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable financial measure stated in accordance with GAAP has been provided in the financial statement tables included in this press release. PacBio is unable to reconcile future-looking non-GAAP guidance included in this press release without unreasonable effort because certain items that impact this measure are out of PacBio’s control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted at this time.\n\nForward-Looking Statements\n\nThis press release contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements other than statements of historical fact are forward-looking statements, including statements relating to PacBio’s cost-saving plans and initiatives as well as the expected financial impact and timing of these plans and initiatives; PacBio’s financial guidance and expectations for future periods; developments affecting our industry and the markets in which we compete, including the impact of new products and technologies; anticipated future customer use of our products; and the availability, uses, accuracy, coverage, advantages, quality or performance of, or benefits or expected benefits of using, PacBio products or technologies; and, the impact of new products and technologies. Reported results and orders for any instrument system should not be considered an indication of future performance. You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements because they are subject to assumptions, risks, and uncertainties and could cause actual outcomes and results to differ materially from currently anticipated results, including, challenges inherent in developing, manufacturing, launching, marketing and selling new products, and achieving anticipated new sales; potential cancellation of existing instrument orders; assumptions, risks and uncertainties related to the ability to attract new customers and retain and grow sales from existing customers; risks related to PacBio’s ability to successfully execute and realize the benefits of acquisitions; the impact of U.S. export restrictions on the shipment of PacBio products to certain countries; rapidly changing technologies and extensive competition in genomic sequencing; unanticipated increases in costs or expenses; interruptions or delays in the supply of components or materials for, or manufacturing of, PacBio products and products under development; potential product performance and quality issues and potential delays in development timelines; the possible loss of key employees, customers, or suppliers; customers and prospective customers curtailing or suspending activities using PacBio’s products; third-party claims alleging infringement of patents and proprietary rights or seeking to invalidate PacBio’s patents or proprietary rights; risks associated with international operations; and other risks associated with general macroeconomic conditions and geopolitical instability. Additional factors that could materially affect actual results can be found in PacBio’s most recent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including PacBio’s most recent reports on Forms 8-K, 10-K, and 10-Q, and include those listed under the caption “Risk Factors.” These forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and speak only as of the date hereof; except as required by law, PacBio disclaims any obligation to revise or update these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances in the future, even if new information becomes
