        "text": "Competition objectives\n\nThe Alzheimer's Association Research Fellowship award is intended to support exceptional researchers who are engaged in their post-graduate work (i.e., postdoctoral fellows) and before they have their first independent faculty positions (i.e., Assistant Professor) and working in diverse areas of research, including basic, translational, clinical, functional and social-behavioral research. Investigators doing clinically-focused research without clinical practice are encouraged to apply to this AARF program.\n\nIndividuals applying to the program will be accepted from postdoctoral fellows with full time positions at their respective institution who have less than 10 years of research experience after receipt of their doctorate or other terminal degree. Individuals who have a position of an Assistant Professorship or above are not eligible.\n\nThe Alzheimer's Association feels strongly that the mentoring and involvement of researchers from diverse backgrounds and perspectives is essential to engaging cutting edge ideas and thinking in addressing scientific gaps for Alzheimer’s and all other dementias.\n\nThe mechanism of the award is the individual research grant. The maximum allowable duration is three years (minimum two years).\n\nFunding and award period\n\nEach Fellowship award is limited to $200,000. Component parts of the award include:\n\nA total of $180,000 (including direct and indirect costs) will be awarded for costs related to the proposed research for up to three years. (Award should be a minimum 2 years. For a 2-year award the total is limited to $140,000 with direct and indirect costs). Requests in any given year may not exceed $70,000 (direct and indirect costs). Indirect costs are capped at 10 percent of total direct costs and are inclusive of indirect costs for the implementing institution as well as any to subcontracts.\n\nSupport for travel to scientific and professional meetings and additional support for travel expenses necessary to carry out research planned – this may include site visits. A total of $12,500 over a three year period may be requested for travel purposes and is not to exceed $7,000 in any given year. If you request the full $12,500 towards just two years of travel and are requesting a three year award you will not be able to request travel funds for one of those years. Total travel cost should not exceed $12,500 for the duration of the award and must include attendance to the annual Alzheimer’s Association International Conference (AAIC).\n\nThe remaining funds are two $10,000 research stipends ($10,000 to the applicant and $10,000 to the primary mentor), which are not guaranteed and are awarded only upon successful completion of the award. Successful completion of the award includes, but is not limited to, successfully achieving project aims and accomplishing all of the Fellowship benchmarks. These research stipends are to be applied to sustaining ongoing research in the Alzheimer's field and will be paid to the applicant‘s and mentor‘s respective institutions at the time of release.\n\nThe Principal Investigator must commit to a 50% research effort each funding year. Note this is minimum time committed to research; and not necessary time to this project or equivalent to salary % allocated.\n\nEligibility\n\nApplications will be accepted from postdoctoral fellows (or an equivalent level position) with full-time positions at their respective academic institution and less than 10 years of research experience after receipt of their doctorate (Ph.D.) or terminal degree.\n\nIf the applicant is promoted to faculty during the application process, the applicant may continue to proceed with the AARF program.\n\nNote: Alzheimer’s Association grants are generally open to scientists and researchers across the globe; however, as a U.S.-based charity, the Alzheimer’s Association is subject to, and complies with, U.S. law. As a result, the Alzheimer’s Association cannot award, and will not award, grants in violation of applicable U.S. statutes and regulations. This means, among other things, that the Alzheimer’s Association cannot, and will not, fund any individual or entity (i) that is subject to U.S. comprehensive or targeted sanctions or if awarding funding would result in a violation of such sanctions, (ii) that is on the U.S. List of Specially Designated Nationals or entities owned or controlled by such persons, or (iii) when doing so is otherwise prohibited by U.S. laws related to combating terrorism.\n\nIneligibility\n\nIneligibility criteria include:\n\nIndividuals who have a position of an Assistant Professorship or above are not eligible.\n\nIndividuals currently enrolled as a student in a undergraduate, Master or Doctoral Program are not eligible, regardless of prior degree status.\n\nPlease refer to Section III: B. Eligibility & Ineligibility for additional ineligibility criteria, which are applicable to both Applicant/Fellow and the Mentor\n\nDeadlines and award dates\n\nLetter of Intent (LOI) deadline: September 5, 2024, 5 p.m. EST.\n\nEach AARF LOI is evaluated with attention to:\n\nDemonstrable innovation/novelty of the proposed project (especially in the context of the PIs recently funded work)\n\nAlignment with the research priorities of the Alzheimer’s Association\n\nImpact of project on Alzheimer’s and related dementia research\n\nEvidence of methodological rigor that address the research question(s) being proposed\n\nLetter of Intent notifications: Week of October 7, 2024.\n\nNote: due to the high volume of submissions, specific feedback and reviewer comments are not provided at the LOI stage.\n\nApplication deadline: November 12, 2024, 5 p.m. EST.\n\nIf invited to submit a full application, each AARF application is evaluated on:\n\nQuality and nature of the training to be provided and the institutional, departmental, and mentor-specific training environment, this includes available resources to support the applicant in their training (30%)\n\nQuality and emphasis of applicant and originality of the research plan (40%)\n\nSignificance of the question being studied, quality of the work plan and the impact-risk of the proposal, impact on advancement of diverse science (30%)\n\nResubmissions will have the opportunity to provide a response to prior review\n\nAward notifications: Prior to February 28, 2025.\n\nMentoring plans and fellowship benchmarks\n\nEach Fellowship award must identify a primary mentor. The mentor should be experienced in conducting Alzheimer’s and dementia research and in mentoring junior investigators. The application must include a two-three page statement from the selected mentor that includes information on his/her research qualifications, experience as a research supervisor and commitment to the applicant. This statement will be a significant part of the application review. The application must also include information to describe the mentor's research support relevant to the applicant‘s research plan and the nature and extent of supervision and training that he/she will provide during the period of the award. Only one primary mentor is allowed; however, additional team members who might function as mentors can be listed as key personnel.\n\nNote: The primary mentor must agree to provide annual evaluations of the applicant’s progress for the duration of the award, as required for the yearly progress report.\n\nMentors can be early-career researchers and/or mid-career scientists who choose to shift into Alzheimer's and all dementia research. The applicant and proposed mentor must specify a mechanism for ensuring effective mentoring. The application should contain a plan for and an evaluation strategy of the mentoring process for enhancing diversity in the professional research workforce. A successful plan will include specific details on the mentoring goals designed towards achievements both related to research and other professional development.\n\nAdditionally, a successful mentorship plan should include the following Fellowship Benchmarks, which are required to receive the research stipends, but should not be limited to only these.\n\nRequired Fellowship benchmarks are as follows:\n\nAttendance at an Association-sponsored networking event at the Alzheimer’s Association’s International Conference (AAIC)\n\nAcceptance of an abstract at AAIC\n\nMandatory documentation of hours spent on face-to-face mentoring\n\nCitation of specific exercises of mentorship such as supervision of manuscript writing and submission or grant writing and submission\n\nReviewing grant applications.
