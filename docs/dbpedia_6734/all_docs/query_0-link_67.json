        "text": "Slide Safety\n\nPrepared specimen slides are precious, often unique, and need to be handled with care. In addition to the slide retaining design of the slide racks, a range of further safety features have been included in the unit to minimize the risk of damage to slides. The slide gripper includes a sensor to detect the presence of a slide. If the state of this sensor changes due to an absent slide for example, the system will stop and report an error message. A similar approach is taken on the scanning stage where a sensor identifies if a slide is present on the stage. Slide scanning will not take place for example, if a slide is not successfully placed onto the stage. A third sensor is used to monitor the position of the slide relative to the stage. If the user inadvertently moves the scanning stage in the Z axis, collisions are avoided by this sensor.\n\nHigh Resolution Imaging\n\nApplications such as cytology or cytogentics may require the use of high numerical aperture oil objectives to achieve the required optical resolution. An optional automatic oiling system is available to work alongside the slide loader. The PL-220 automatic oil dispenser provides a highly controlled automatic delivery for dispensing immersion oil onto the surface of the slide after the slide has been loaded onto the stage, but before it is scanned."
