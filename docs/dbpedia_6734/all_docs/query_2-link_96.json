        "text": "Cash Generation of $217 million in Q2, including working capital recovery\n\nIntroducing Cash Generation guidance of $350 million to $600 million in 2025; reiterating Cash Generation guidance of $50 million to $125 million in Q4 ($200 million to $500 million annualized)\n\nStorage Capacity Installed of 265 Megawatt hours in Q2, exceeding high-end of guidance range and representing 152% year-over-year growth, as storage attachment rates reach 54%\n\nSolar Energy Capacity Installed of 192 Megawatts in Q2, within the prior guidance range, reaching 7.1 Gigawatts of Networked Solar Energy Capacity\n\nNet Earning Assets increases to $5.7 billion, including over $1 billion in Total Cash\n\nSAN FRANCISCO, Aug. 06, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Sunrun (Nasdaq: RUN), the nation’s leading provider of clean energy as a subscription service, today announced financial results for the quarter ended June 30, 2024.\n\n“In the second quarter we again set new records for both storage installation and attachment rates, further differentiating Sunrun in the industry, beating the high-end of our storage installation guidance and delivering solid quarter-over-quarter growth for solar installation, Cash Generation and Net Subscriber Value,” said Mary Powell, Sunrun’s Chief Executive Officer. “Our primary focus is on expanding our differentiation, launching additional products and services to expand customer lifetime values, and remaining a disciplined, margin-focused leader in the sector to drive meaningful Cash Generation.”\n\n“The team is executing on our margin-focused and disciplined-growth strategy, which is producing strong results. We expect positive Cash Generation in Q3, are on track for our annualized run-rate target of $200 to $500 million in Q4, and are excited to introduce our 2025 Cash Generation guidance of $350 to $600 million,” said Danny Abajian, Sunrun’s Chief Financial Officer. “We continue to execute well in the capital markets and believe our sponsor quality and record of strong asset performance continue to differentiate us in the market.”\n\nSecond Quarter Updates\n\nStorage Attachment Rates Reach 54%: Storage attachment rates on installations reached 54% in Q2, up from 18% in the same period a year ago, with 264.5 Megawatt hours installed during the quarter. Sunrun has now installed more than 116,000 solar and storage systems, representing nearly 1.8 Gigawatt hours of stored energy capacity.\n\nAccelerating Momentum in New Homes Business: Sunrun is pleased to welcome industry leaders Matt Brost and Ellen Struck to its new homes division. Brost and Struck most recently worked at SunPower, where they led the largest new home solar business in the country, and together bring more than four decades of experience in the energy and solar industries. With this strategic investment, Sunrun plans to accelerate the growth of solar and storage installations on new construction and capitalize on our strong, market-leading platform across multiple segments.\n\nSunrun and Tesla Electric Partner to Support Texas Power Grid: The program, which has enrolled more than 150 Sunrun customers, will dispatch stored solar energy from at-home batteries to rapidly increase available electricity reserves on the Texas power grid during times of high consumption. Customers will be compensated for their participation while also retaining a portion of the stored energy in their batteries to provide back-up power to their homes in the event of a power outage. Sunrun will also earn incremental recurring revenue for the program.\n\nSunrun Customers Power Through Outages Caused By Hurricane Beryl: During prolonged power outages in the aftermath of Hurricane Beryl, more than 1,600 Sunrun customers in the greater Houston area were able to keep their homes energized with more than 70,000 hours of backup energy provided by their solar-plus-storage systems.\n\nFirst Vehicle-To-Home Grid Support Launched in Maryland: In partnership with Maryland’s largest utility, Baltimore Gas and Electric Company (BGE), the program utilizes all-electric Ford F-150 Lightning trucks to deliver power to owners’ homes during peak demand times to support Maryland’s power grid. This program is the first operational bidirectional electric vehicle power plant in the United States that uses a cohort of customer vehicles and is a significant proof of concept, with the goal to expand these programs all around the country.\n\nContinued Strong Capital Markets Execution: In June, as previously noted, Sunrun closed an $886 million securitization of residential solar and battery systems. The two classes of non-recourse Class A senior notes were rated A+ by Kroll with the $443.15 million public Class A-1 note priced at a credit spread of 205 basis points. The Class A notes represented an advance rate of approximately 72.6%. Similar to prior transactions, Sunrun raised additional subordinated non-recourse financing which increased the cumulative advance rate to 83%. In July 2024, Sunrun also expanded its non-recourse warehouse lending facility by $280 to $2,630 million in commitments, matching the growing scale of Sunrun’s business.\n\nScience Based Targets Initiative (SBTi) Approves Sunrun’s Net-Zero and Emissions Reductions Targets: Sunrun’s near and long-term greenhouse gas emissions reductions targets have been assessed and approved by the SBTi. In addition, SBTi has verified Sunrun’s net-zero science-based target by 2050. The SBTi is a corporate climate action organization that enables companies and financial institutions worldwide to play their part in combating the climate crisis.\n\nKey Operating Metrics\n\nIn the second quarter of 2024, Customer Additions were 26,687 including 24,984 Subscriber Additions. As of June 30, 2024, Sunrun had 984,000 Customers, including 828,129 Subscribers. Customers grew 13% in the second quarter of 2024 compared to the second quarter of 2023.\n\nAnnual Recurring Revenue from Subscribers was approximately $1.5 billion as of June 30, 2024. The Average Contract Life Remaining of Subscribers was 17.8 years as of June 30, 2024.\n\nSubscriber Value was $49,610 in the second quarter of 2024, an 11% increase compared to the second quarter of 2023. Creation Cost was $37,216 in the second quarter of 2024.\n\nNet Subscriber Value was $12,394 in the second quarter of 2024. Total Value Generated was $310 million in the second quarter of 2024. On a pro-forma basis assuming a 7.5% discount rate, consistent with capital costs observed in Q2, Subscriber Value was $44,291 and Net Subscriber Value was $7,075 in the second quarter of 2024.\n\nGross Earning Assets as of June 30, 2024, were $15.7 billion. Net Earning Assets were $5.7 billion, which included $1,042 million in Total Cash, as of June 30, 2024.\n\nCash Generation was $217 million in the second quarter. The strong Cash Generation achievement was inclusive of a recoupment of the ITC-related working capital investments made in Q1.\n\nStorage Capacity Installed was 264.5 Megawatt hours in the second quarter of 2024. This represents a 152% year over year increase from the 104.8 Megawatt hours of Storage Capacity Installed in the second quarter of 2023.\n\nSolar Energy Capacity Installed was 192.3 Megawatts in the second quarter of 2024. Solar Energy Capacity Installed for Subscribers was 182.1 Megawatts in the second quarter of 2024.\n\nNetworked Solar Energy Capacity was 7,058 Megawatts as of June 30, 2024. Networked Solar Energy Capacity for Subscribers was 5,984 Megawatts as of June 30, 2024. Networked Storage Capacity was 1.8 Gigawatt hours as of June 30, 2024.\n\nThe solar energy systems we deployed in Q2 are expected to offset the emission of 3.8 million metric tons of CO2 over the next thirty years. Over the last twelve months ended June 30, 2024, Sunrun’s systems are estimated to have offset 3.9 million metric tons of CO2.\n\nOutlook\n\nManagement is reiterating guidance for Cash Generation of $50 million to $125 million in Q4 ($200 million to $500 million annualized). Cash Generation is expected to be positive in Q3.\n\nManagement is introducing Cash Generation guidance of $350 million to $600 million for the full-year 2025.\n\nStorage Capacity Installed is expected to be in a range of 1,030 to 1,100 Megawatt hours for the full-year 2024, and increase from the prior range of 800 to 1,000 Megawatt hours. This range represents approximately 80% to 93% growth year over year.\n\nStorage Capacity Installed is expected to be in a range of 275 to 300 Megawatt hours in the third quarter of 2024. This range represents approximately 64% growth year over year.\n\nSolar Energy Capacity Installed is expected to decline approximately 15% for the full-year 2024, in-line with the low-end of the prior guidance range. Year-over-year growth is expected to be positive in Q4.\n\nSolar Energy Capacity Installed is expected to be in a range of 220 to 230 Megawatts in the third quarter of 2024. This range represents approximately 14% to 20% sequential growth from Q2.\n\nSecond Quarter 2024 GAAP Results\n\nTotal revenue was $523.9 million in the second quarter of 2024, down $66.3 million, or 11%, from the second quarter of 2023. Customer agreements and incentives revenue was $387.8 million, an increase of $85.7 million, or 28%, compared to the second quarter of 2023. Solar energy systems and product sales revenue was $136.0 million, a decrease of $152.0 million, or 53%, compared to the second quarter of 2023. The increasing mix of Subscribers results in less upfront revenue recognition, as revenue is recognized over the life of the Customer Agreement which is typically 20 or 25 years.\n\nTotal cost of revenue was $428.8 million, a decrease of 20% year-over-year. Total operating expenses were $651.9 million, a decrease of 18% year-over-year.\n\nNet income attributable to common stockholders was $139.1 million, or $0.63 per basic share and $0.55 per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2024.\n\nFinancing Activities\n\nAs of August 6, 2024, closed transactions and executed term sheets provide us with expected tax equity to fund approximately 313 Megawatts of Solar Energy Capacity Installed for Subscribers beyond what was deployed through June 30, 2024. Sunrun also had $1,089 million available in its non-recourse senior revolving warehouse facility at the end of Q2, pro-forma to reflect a recent upsize, to fund over 373 Megawatts of Solar Energy Capacity Installed for Subscribers.\n\nConference Call Information\n\nSunrun is hosting a conference call for analysts and investors to discuss its second quarter 2024 results and business outlook at 1:30 p.m. Pacific Time today, August 6, 2024.

Management believes these metrics, when taken together with other information contained in our filings with the SEC and within this press release, provide investors with helpful information to determine the economic performance of the business activities in a period that would otherwise not be observable from historic GAAP measures. Management believes that it is helpful to investors to evaluate the present value of cash flows expected from subscribers over the full expected relationship with such subscribers (“Subscriber Value”, more fully defined in the definitions appendix below) in comparison to the costs associated with adding these customers, regardless of whether or not the costs are expensed or capitalized in the period (“Creation Cost”, more fully defined in the definitions appendix below). The Company also believes that Subscriber Value, Creation Costs, and Total Value Generated are useful metrics for investors because they present an unlevered view of all of the costs associated with new customers in a period compared to the expected future cash flows from these customers over a 30-year period, based on contracted pricing terms with its customers, which is not observable in any current or historic GAAP-derived metric. Management believes it is useful for investors to also evaluate the future expected cash flows from all customers that have been deployed through the respective measurement date, less estimated costs to maintain such systems and estimated distributions to tax equity partners in consolidated joint venture partnership flip structures, and distributions to project equity investors (“Gross Earning Assets”, more fully defined in the definitions appendix below). The Company also believes Gross Earning Assets is useful for management and investors because it represents the remaining future expected cash flows from existing customers, which is not a current or historic GAAP-derived measure.\n\nVarious assumptions are made when calculating these metrics. Both Subscriber Value and Gross Earning Assets utilize a 6% rate to discount future cash flows to the present period. Furthermore, these metrics assume that customers renew after the initial contract period at a rate equal to 90% of the rate in effect at the end of the initial contract term. For Customer Agreements with 25-year initial contract terms, a 5-year renewal period is assumed. For a 20-year initial contract term, a 10-year renewal period is assumed. In all instances, we assume a 30-year customer relationship, although the customer may renew for additional years, or purchase the system. Estimated cost of servicing assets has been deducted and is estimated based on the service agreements underlying each fund.\n\nIn-period volume metrics: Three Months Ended\n\nJune 30, 2024 Customer Additions 26,687 Subscriber Additions 24,984 Solar Energy Capacity Installed (in Megawatts) 192.3 Solar Energy Capacity Installed for Subscribers (in Megawatts) 182.1 Storage Capacity Installed (in Megawatt hours) 264.5 In-period value creation metrics: Three Months Ended\n\nJune 30, 2024 Subscriber Value Contracted Period $46,041 Subscriber Value Renewal Period $3,569 Subscriber Value $49,610 Creation Cost $37,216 Net Subscriber Value $12,394 Total Value Generated (in millions) $310 In-period environmental impact metrics: Three Months Ended\n\nJune 30, 2024 Positive Environmental Impact from Customers (over trailing twelve months, in millions of metric tons of CO2 avoidance) 3.9 Positive Expected Lifetime Environmental Impact from Customer Additions (in millions of metric tons of CO2 avoidance) 3.8 Period-end metrics: June 30, 2024 Customers 984,000 Subscribers 828,129 Households Served in Low-Income Multifamily Properties 16,305 Networked Solar Energy Capacity (in Megawatts) 7,058 Networked Solar Energy Capacity for Subscribers (in Megawatts) 5,984 Networked Storage Capacity (in Megawatt hours) 1,796 Annual Recurring Revenue (in millions) $1,457 Average Contract Life Remaining (in years) 17.8 Gross Earning Assets Contracted Period (in millions) $12,051 Gross Earning Assets Renewal Period (in millions) $3,641 Gross Earning Assets (in millions) $15,692 Net Earning Assets (in millions) $5,675\n\nNote that Sunrun updated the discount rate used to calculate Subscriber Value and Gross Earning Assets to 6% commencing with the first quarter 2023 reporting. Also note that figures presented above may not sum due to rounding. For adjustments related to Subscriber Value and Creation Cost, please see the supplemental Creation Cost Methodology memo for each applicable period, which is available on investors.sunrun.com.\n\nDefinitions\n\nDeployments represent solar or storage systems, whether sold directly to customers or subject to executed Customer Agreements (i) for which we have confirmation that the systems are installed, subject to final inspection, or (ii) in the case of certain system installations by our partners, for which we have accrued at least 80% of the expected project cost (inclusive of acquisitions of installed systems).\n\nCustomer Agreements refer to, collectively, solar or storage power purchase agreements and leases.\n\nSubscriber Additions represent the number of Deployments in the period that are subject to executed Customer Agreements.\n\nCustomer Additions represent the number of Deployments in the period.\n\nSolar Energy Capacity Installed represents the aggregate megawatt production capacity of our solar energy systems that were recognized as Deployments in the period.\n\nSolar Energy Capacity Installed for Subscribers represents the aggregate megawatt production capacity of our solar energy systems that were recognized as Deployments in the period that are subject to executed Customer Agreements.\n\nStorage Capacity Installed represents the aggregate megawatt hour capacity of storage systems that were recognized as Deployments in the period.\n\nCreation Cost represents the sum of certain operating expenses and capital expenditures incurred divided by applicable Customer Additions and Subscriber Additions in the period. Creation Cost is comprised of (i) installation costs, which includes the increase in gross solar energy system assets and the cost of customer agreement revenue, excluding depreciation expense of fixed solar assets, and operating and maintenance expenses associated with existing Subscribers, plus (ii) sales and marketing costs, including increases to the gross capitalized costs to obtain contracts, net of the amortization expense of the costs to obtain contracts, plus (iii) general and administrative costs, and less (iv) the gross profit derived from selling systems to customers under sale agreements and Sunrun’s product distribution and lead generation businesses. Creation Cost excludes stock based compensation, amortization of intangibles, and research and development expenses, along with other items the company deems to be non-recurring or extraordinary in nature. The gross margin derived from solar energy systems and product sales is included as an offset to Creation Cost since these sales are ancillary to the overall business model and lowers our overall cost of business. The sales, marketing, general and administrative costs in Creation Costs is inclusive of sales, marketing, general and administrative activities related to the entire business, including solar energy system and product sales. As such, by including the gross margin on solar energy system and product sales as a contra cost, the value of all activities of the Company’s segment are represented in the Net Subscriber Value.\n\nSubscriber Value represents the per subscriber value of upfront and future cash flows (discounted at 6%) from Subscriber Additions in the period, including expected payments from customers as set forth in Customer Agreements, net proceeds from tax equity finance partners, payments from utility incentive and state rebate programs, contracted net grid service program cash flows, projected future cash flows from solar energy renewable energy credit sales, less estimated operating and maintenance costs to service the systems and replace equipment, consistent with estimates by independent engineers, over the initial term of the Customer Agreements and estimated renewal period. For Customer Agreements with 25 year initial contract terms, a 5 year renewal period is assumed. For a 20 year initial contract term, a 10 year renewal period is assumed. In all instances, we assume a 30-year customer relationship, although the customer may renew for additional years, or purchase the system.\n\nNet Subscriber Value represents Subscriber Value less Creation Cost.\n\nTotal Value Generated represents Net Subscriber Value multiplied by Subscriber Additions.\n\nCustomers represent the cumulative number of Deployments, from the company’s inception through the measurement date.\n\nSubscribers represent the cumulative number of Customer Agreements for systems that have been recognized as Deployments through the measurement date.\n\nNetworked Solar Energy Capacity represents the aggregate megawatt production capacity of our solar energy systems that have been recognized as Deployments, from the company’s inception through the measurement date.\n\nNetworked Solar Energy Capacity for Subscribers represents the aggregate megawatt production capacity of our solar energy systems that have been recognized as Deployments, from the company’s inception through the measurement date, that have been subject to executed Customer Agreements.\n\nNetworked Storage Capacity represents the aggregate megawatt hour capacity of our storage systems that have been recognized as Deployments, from the company’s inception through the measurement date.\n\nGross Earning Assets is calculated as Gross Earning Assets Contracted Period plus Gross Earning Assets Renewal Period.\n\nGross Earning Assets Contracted Period represents the present value of the remaining net cash flows (discounted at 6%) during the initial term of our Customer Agreements as of the measurement date. It is calculated as the present value of cash flows (discounted at 6%) that we would receive from Subscribers in future periods as set forth in Customer Agreements, after deducting expected operating and maintenance costs, equipment replacements costs, distributions to tax equity partners in consolidated joint venture partnership flip structures, and distributions to project equity investors. We include cash flows we expect to receive in future periods from tax equity partners, government incentive and rebate programs, contracted sales of solar renewable energy credits, and awarded net cash flows from grid service programs with utilities or grid operators.\n\nGross Earning Assets Renewal Period is the forecasted net present value we would receive upon or following the expiration of the initial Customer Agreement term but before the 30th anniversary of the system’s activation (either in the form of cash payments during any applicable renewal period or a system purchase at the end of the initial term), for Subscribers as of the measurement date. We calculate the Gross Earning Assets Renewal Period amount at the expiration of the initial contract term assuming either a system purchase or a renewal, forecasting only a 30-year customer relationship (although the customer may renew for additional years, or purchase the system), at a contract rate equal to 90% of the customer’s contractual rate in effect at the end of the initial contract term. After the initial contract term, our Customer Agreements typically automatically renew on an annual basis and the rate is initially set at up to a 10% discount to then-prevailing utility power prices.\n\nNet Earning Assets represents Gross Earning Assets, plus total cash, less adjusted debt and less pass-through financing obligations, as of the same measurement date. Debt is adjusted to exclude a pro-rata share of non-recourse debt associated with funds with project equity structures along with debt associated with the company’s ITC safe harboring facility. Because estimated cash distributions to our project equity partners are deducted from Gross Earning Assets, a proportional share of the corresponding project level non-recourse debt is deducted from Net Earning Assets, as such debt would be serviced from cash flows already excluded from Gross Earning Assets.\n\nCash Generation is calculated using the change in our unrestricted cash balance from our consolidated balance sheet, less net proceeds (or plus net repayments) from all recourse debt (inclusive of convertible debt), and less any primary equity issuances or net proceeds derived from employee stock award activity (or plus any stock buybacks or dividends paid to common stockholders) as presented on the Company’s consolidated statement of cash flows. The Company expects to continue to raise tax equity and asset-level non-recourse debt to fund growth, and as such, these sources of cash are included in the definition of Cash Generation. Cash Generation also excludes long-term asset or business divestitures and equity investments in external non-consolidated businesses (or less dividends or distributions received in connection with such equity investments).\n\nAnnual Recurring Revenue represents revenue arising from Customer Agreements over the following twelve months for Subscribers that have met initial revenue recognition criteria as of the measurement date.\n\nAverage Contract Life Remaining represents the average number of years remaining in the initial term of Customer Agreements for Subscribers that have met revenue recognition criteria as of the measurement date.\n\nHouseholds Served in Low-Income Multifamily Properties represent the number of individual rental units served in low-income multi-family properties from shared solar energy systems deployed by Sunrun. Households are counted when the solar energy system has interconnected with the grid, which may differ from Deployment recognition criteria.\n\nPositive Environmental Impact from Customers represents the estimated reduction in carbon emissions as a result of energy produced from our Networked Solar Energy Capacity over the trailing twelve months. The figure is presented in millions of metric tons of avoided carbon emissions and is calculated using the Environmental Protection Agency’s AVERT tool. The figure is calculated using the most recent published tool from the EPA, using the current-year avoided emission factor for distributed resources on a state by state basis. The environmental impact is estimated based on the system, regardless of whether or not Sunrun continues to own the system or any associated renewable energy credits.\n\nPositive Expected Lifetime Environmental Impact from Customer Additions represents the estimated reduction in carbon emissions over thirty years as a result of energy produced from solar energy systems that were recognized as Deployments in the period. The figure is presented in millions of metric tons of avoided carbon emissions and is calculated using the Environmental Protection Agency’s AVERT tool. The figure is calculated using the most recent published tool from the EPA, using the current-year avoided emission factor for distributed resources on a state by state basis, leveraging our estimated production figures for such systems, which degrade over time, and is extrapolated for 30 years. The environmental impact is estimated based on the system, regardless of whether or not Sunrun continues to own the system or any associated renewable energy credits.\n\nTotal Cash represents the total of the restricted cash balance and unrestricted cash balance from our consolidated balance sheet.\n\nInvestor & Analyst Contact:\n\nPatrick Jobin\n\nSVP, Deputy CFO & Investor Relations Officer\n\ninvestors@sunrun.com\n\nMedia Contact:\n\nWyatt Semanek\n\nDirector, Corporate Communications\n\npress@sunrun.com\n\nSource: Sunrun Inc."
