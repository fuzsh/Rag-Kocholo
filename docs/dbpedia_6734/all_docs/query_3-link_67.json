        "text": "Duties of the Publisher\n\nGuardianship of the scholarly record\n\nThese guidelines have been written with all these requirements in mind but especially recognising that it is an important role of the publisher to support the huge efforts made by journal editors, and the often unsung volunteer work undertaken by peer reviewers, in maintaining the integrity of the scholarly record. Although ethical codes inevitably concentrate on the infractions that sometimes occur, it is a tribute to scholarly practice that the system works so well and that problems are comparatively rare. The publisher has a supporting, investing and nurturing role in the scholarly communication process but is also ultimately responsible for ensuring that best practice is followed in its publications3Â ,Â 4.\n\nElsevier, as the world's leading journal publisher, takes its duties of guardianship over the scholarly record extremely seriously. Our journals record \"the minutes of science\" and we recognise our responsibilities as the keeper of those \"minutes\" in all our policies5, not least the ethical guidelines that we have adopted here.\n\nElsevier is adopting these policies and procedures to support editors, reviewers and authors in performing their ethical duties under these guidelines. We work with other publishers and industry associations to set standards for best practices on ethical matters, errors and retractions.\n\nSafeguard editorial independence\n\nWe are committed to ensuring that the potential for advertising, reprint or other commercial revenue has no impact or influence on editorial decisions6.\n\nCollaborate to set industry best practice\n\nWe promote best practice by offering editors membership of the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE) and providing editors with Crossref Similarity Check reports for all submissions to our editorial systems.\n\nProvide editors with technical, procedural & legal support\n\nWe support editors in communications with other journals and/or publishers where this is useful to editors and are prepared to provide specialised legal review and counsel if necessary.\n\nEducate researchers on publishing ethics\n\nWe also provide extensive education and advice on publishing ethics standards, particularly for early career researchers7.\n\nCompeting interests for editors who are employees of Elsevier\n\nEditors of Elsevierâs journals who are employees are required to report any competing or conflicting interests that could affect, or be perceived to affect, their editorial judgement. Competing interests must be reported as soon as they arise, and in any case through an annual declaration, so that they can be assessed and mitigated or resolved. Editorial competing interests may be disclosed on the journalâs website for ongoing competing interests (such as holding a patent), and/or on published papers for competing interests related to the specific paper.\n\nCompeting interests for editors include both financial and non-financial interests, such as:\n\nCurrent academic affiliations or other editorial roles. Examples include: employment, consultancies, professional affiliations, advisory positions, board memberships, or acting as an expert witness (in each case whether paid or unpaid).\n\nFinancial interests, including patents or patent applications, travel grants, ownership, directorship. Minor investments in publicly traded stock (less than 1% of the outstanding shares of the publicly traded company) or investments through mutual funds/pension funds/401Ks are excluded.\n\nEditors who are Elsevier employees are required to comply with Elsevierâs policy on the publication of research articles in Elsevier journals which discourages them from submitting research papers for publication in Elsevier journals, other than when the research was conducted before they joined Elsevier or in exceptional situations such as where the work was presented at a conference and the full conference proceedings are eventually published in an Elsevier journal. In all cases where a research paper is submitted for publication in an Elsevier journal, the Elsevier employee must disclose the conflict to the editor of the journal upon submission and the journal will ensure that all editorial processes are fully independent of the editor-author. If the article is accepted for publication, the articleâs declaration of interest statement should disclose that Elsevier is the current employer of an author and that the peer review was fully independent of said author. All such editors must also comply with Elsevierâs policy regarding non-involvement of editors in papers which they have written or which have been written by family members or colleagues or which relate to products or services in which the editor has an interest. In addition, editorial staff are forbidden to use information acquired through their work for personal gain.â¯\n\nDuties of Editors\n\nPublication decisions\n\nThe editor of a learned journal is solely and independently responsible for deciding which of the articles submitted to the journal should be published, often working in conjunction with the relevant society (for society-owned or sponsored journals)4Â ,Â 6. The validation of the work in question and its importance to researchers and readers must always underwrite such decisions.Â Â The editor may be guided by the policies of the journal's editorial board and constrained by such legal requirements as shall then be in force regarding issues such as libel, copyright infringement and plagiarism. The editor may confer with other editors or reviewers (or society officers) in making these decisions.\n\nPeer review\n\nThe editor shall ensure that the peer review process is fair, unbiased, and timely.Â Â Research articles must typically be reviewed by at least two external and independent reviewers, and where necessary the editor should seek additional opinions.\n\nThe editor shall select reviewers who have suitable expertise in the relevant field, taking account of the need for appropriate, inclusive and diverse representation. The editor shall follow best practice in avoiding the selection of fraudulent peer reviewers8. The editor shall review all disclosures of potential conflicts of interest and suggestions for self-citation made by reviewers in order to determine whether there is any potential for bias.\n\nFair play\n\nThe editor should evaluate manuscripts for their intellectual content without regard to race, gender, sexual orientation, religious belief, ethnic origin, citizenship, or political philosophy of the authors. When nominating potential editorial board members, the editor shall take account of the need for appropriate, inclusive and diverse representation.\n\nThe editorial policies of the journal should encourage transparency and complete, honest reporting, and the editor should ensure that peer reviewers and authors have a clear understanding of what is expected of them. The editor shall use the journalâs standard electronic submission system for all journal communications.\n\nThe editor shall establish, along with the publisher, a transparent mechanism for appeal against editorial decisions.\n\nJournal metrics\n\nThe editor must not attempt to influence the journalâs ranking by artificially increasing any journal metric. In particular, the editor shall not require that references to that (or any other) journalâs articles be included except for genuine scholarly reasons and authors should not be required to include references to the editorâs own articles or products and services in which the editor has an interest.\n\nConfidentiality\n\nThe editor must protect the confidentiality of all material submitted to the journal and all communications with reviewers, unless otherwise agreed with the relevant authors and reviewers. In exceptional circumstances and in consultation with the publisher, the editor may share limited information with editors of other journals, institutions, and other organizations that investigate cases of research misconduct where deemed necessary to investigate suspected ethical breaches9.\n\nUnless the journal is operating an open peer-review system and/or reviewers have agreed to disclose their names, the editor must protect reviewersâ identities.\n\nUnpublished materials disclosed in a submitted manuscript must not be used in an editor's own research without the express written consent of the author. Privileged information or ideas obtained through peer review must be kept confidential and not used for personal advantage.\n\nThe use of generative AI and AI-assisted technologies in the journal editorial process\n\nThis policy has been triggered by the rise of generative AI and AI-assisted technologies* and aims to provide greater transparency and guidance to authors, editors and reviewers. Elsevier will monitor ongoing developments in this area closely and will adjust or refine the policy as appropriate. The following guidance is specifically for editors.Â\n\nA submitted manuscript must be treated as a confidential document. Editors should not upload a submitted manuscript or any part of it into a generative AI tool as this may violate the authorsâ confidentiality and proprietary rights and, where the paper contains personally identifiable information, may breach data privacy rights.Â\n\nThis confidentiality requirement extends to all communication about the manuscript including any notification or decision letters as they may contain confidential information about the manuscript and/or the authors. For this reason, editors should not upload their letters into an AI tool, even if it is just for the purpose of improving language and readability.Â Â\n\nPeer review is at the heart of the scientific ecosystem and Elsevier abides by the highest standards of integrity in this process. Managing the editorial evaluation of a scientific manuscript implies responsibilities that can only be attributed to humans. Generative AI or AI-assisted technologies should not be used by editors to assist in the evaluation or decision-making process of a manuscript as the critical thinking and original assessment needed for this work is outside of the scope of this technology and there is a risk that the technology will generate incorrect, incomplete or biased conclusions about the manuscript. The editor is responsible and accountable for the editorial process, the final decision and the communication thereof to the authors.Â\n\nElsevierâs AI author policy states that authors are allowed to use generative AI and AI-assisted technologies in the writing process before submission, but only to improve the language and readability of their paper and with the appropriate disclosure, as per our instructions in Elsevierâs Guide for Authorsopens in new tab/window. Editors can find such disclosure at the bottom of the paper in a separate section before the list of references. If an editor suspects that an author or a reviewer has violated our AI policies, they should inform the publisher.Â\n\nPlease note that Elsevier owns identity protected AI-assisted technologies which conform to the RELX Responsible AI Principlesopens in new tab/window, such as those used during the screening process to conduct completeness and plagiarism checks and identify suitable reviewers. These in-house or licensed technologies respect author confidentiality. Our programs are subject to rigorous evaluation of bias and are compliant with data privacy and data security requirements.Â Â\n\nElsevier embraces new AI-driven technologies that support reviewers and editors in the editorial process, and we continue to develop and adoptÂ in-house or licensed technologies that respect authorsâ, reviewersâ and editorsâ confidentiality and data privacy rights.Â\n\n* Generative AI is a type of artificial intelligence technology that can produce various types of content including text, imagery, audio and synthetic data. Examples include ChatGPT, NovelAI, Jasper AI, Rytr AI, DALL-E, etc.\n\nDeclaration of competing interests\n\nAny potential editorial conflicts of interest should be declared to the publisher in writing prior to the appointment of the editor, and then updated if and when new conflicts arise. The publisher may publish such declarations in the journal.\n\nThe editor must not be involved in decisions about papers which s/he has written him/herself or have been written by family members or colleagues or which relate to products or services in which the editor has an interest. Further, any such submission must be subject to all of the journalâs usual procedures, peer review must be handled independently of the relevant author/editor and their research groups, and there should be a clear statement to this effect on any such paper that is published10.\n\nThe editor shall apply Elsevierâs policy relating to the disclosure of potential conflicts of interest by authors and reviewers, e.g. the ICMJE guidelines1.\n\nVigilance over the published record\n\nThe editor should work to safeguard the integrity of the published record by reviewing and assessing reported or suspected misconduct (research, publication, reviewer and editorial), in conjunction with the publisher (or society).\n\nSuch measures will generally include contacting the author of the manuscript or paper and giving due consideration to the respective complaint or claims made, but may also include further communications to the relevant institutions and research bodies. The editor shall further make appropriate use of the publisherâs systems for the detection of misconduct, such as plagiarism.\n\nAn editor presented with convincing evidence of misconduct should coordinate with the publisher (and/or society) to arrange the prompt publication of a correction, retraction, expression of concern, or other correction to the record, as may be relevant10.\n\nDuties of Reviewers\n\nContribution to editorial decisions\n\nPeer review assists the editor in making editorial decisions and through the editorial communications with the author may also assist the author in improving the paper.Â Â Peer review is an essential component of formal scholarly communication, and lies at the heart of the scientific method.Â Â In addition to the specific ethics-related duties described below, reviewers are asked generally to treat authors and their work as they would like to be treated themselves and to observe good reviewing etiquette.\n\nAny selected referee who feels unqualified to review the research reported in a manuscript or knows that its prompt review will be impossible should notify the editor and decline to participate in the review process.\n\nConfidentiality\n\nAny manuscripts received for review must be treated as confidential documents. Reviewers must not share the review or information about the paper with anyone or contact the authors directly without permission from the editor.\n\nSome editors encourage discussion with colleagues or co-reviewing exercises, but reviewers should first discuss this with the editor in order to ensure that confidentiality is observed and that participants receive suitable credit.\n\nUnpublished materials disclosed in a submitted manuscript must not be used in a reviewerâs own research without the express written consent of the author. Privileged information or ideas obtained through peer review must be kept confidential and not used for personal advantage.\n\nThe use of generative AI and AI-assisted technologies in the journal peer review process\n\nThis policy has been triggered by the rise of generative AI and AI-assisted technologies* and aims to provide greater transparency and guidance to authors, editors and reviewers. Elsevier will monitor ongoing developments in this area closely and will adjust or refine the policy as appropriate. The following guidance is specifically for reviewers.Â Â\n\nWhen a researcher is invited to review another researcherâs paper, the manuscript must be treated as a confidential document. Reviewers should not upload a submitted manuscript or any part of it into a generative AI tool as this may violate the authorsâ confidentiality and proprietary rights and, where the paper contains personally identifiable information, may breach data privacy rights.Â\n\nThis confidentiality requirement extends to the peer review report, as it may contain confidential information about the manuscript and/or the authors. For this reason, reviewers should not upload their peer review report into an AI tool, even if it is just for the purpose of improving language and readability.Â\n\nPeer review is at the heart of the scientific ecosystem and Elsevier abides by the highest standards of integrity in this process. Reviewing a scientific manuscript implies responsibilities that can only be attributed to humans. Generative AI or AI-assisted technologies should not be used by reviewers to assist in the scientific review of a paper as the critical thinking and original assessment needed for peer review is outside of the scope of this technology and there is a risk that the technology will generate incorrect, incomplete or biased conclusions about the manuscript. The reviewer is responsible and accountable for the content of the review report.Â\n\nElsevierâs AI author policy states that authors are allowed to use generative AI and AI-assisted technologies in the writing process before submission, but only to improve the language and readability of their paper and with the appropriate disclosure, as per our instructions in Elsevierâs Guide for Authorsopens in new tab/window. Reviewers can find such disclosure at the bottom of the paper in a separate section before the list of references.Â\n\nPlease note that Elsevier owns identity protected AI-assisted technologies which conform to the RELX Responsible AI Principlesopens in new tab/window, such as those used during the screening process to conduct completeness and plagiarism checks and identify suitable reviewers.

Examples include ChatGPT, NovelAI, Jasper AI, Rytr AI, DALL-E, etc.\n\nAlertness to ethical issues\n\nA reviewer should be alert to potential ethical issues in the paperÂ Â and should bring these to the attention of the editor, including any substantial similarity or overlap between the manuscript under consideration and any other published paper of which the reviewer has personal knowledge. Any statement that an observation, derivation, or argument had been previously reported should be accompanied by the relevant citation.\n\nStandards of objectivity & competing interests\n\nReviews should be conducted objectively.Â Â Reviewers should be aware of any personal bias they may have and take this into account when reviewing a paper. Personal criticism of the author is inappropriate. Referees should express their views clearly with supporting arguments.\n\nReviewers should consult the Editor before agreeing to review a paper where they have potential conflicts of interest resulting from competitive, collaborative, or other relationships or connections with any of the authors, companies, or institutions connected to the papers.\n\nIf a reviewer suggests that an author includes citations to the reviewerâs (or their associatesâ) work, this must be for genuine scientific reasons and not with the intention of increasing the reviewerâs citation count or enhancing the visibility of their work (or that of their associates).\n\nDuties of Authors\n\nReporting standards\n\nAuthors of reports of original research should present an accurate account of the work performed as well as an objective discussion of its significance. Underlying data should be represented accurately in the paper. A paper should contain sufficient detail and references to permit others to replicate the work. Fraudulent or knowingly inaccurate statements constitute unethical behaviour and are unacceptable.\n\nReview and professional publication articles should also be accurate and objective, and editorial âopinionâ works should be clearly identified as such.\n\nData access and retention\n\nAuthors may be asked to provide the research data supporting their paper for editorial review and/or to comply with the open data requirements of the journal.Â Â Authors should be prepared to provide public access to such data, if practicable, and should be prepared to retain such data for a reasonable number of years after publication. Authors may refer to their journalâs Guide for Authors for further details.\n\nOriginality and acknowledgement of sources\n\nThe authors should ensure that they have written entirely original works, and if the authors have used the work and/or words of others, that this has been appropriately cited or quoted and permission has been obtained where necessary.\n\nProper acknowledgment of the work of others must always be given. Authors should cite publications that have influenced the reported work and that give the work appropriate context within the larger scholarly record. Information obtained privately, as in conversation, correspondence, or discussion with third parties, must not be used or reported without explicit, written permission from the source.\n\nPlagiarism takes many forms, from âpassing offâ anotherâs paper as the authorâs own paper, to copying or paraphrasing substantial parts of anotherâs paper (without attribution), to claiming results from research conducted by others.Â Â Plagiarism in all its forms constitutes unethical behaviour and is unacceptable.\n\nMultiple, redundant or concurrent publication\n\nAn author should not in general publish manuscripts describing essentially the same research in more than one journal of primary publication. Submitting the same manuscript to more than one journal concurrently constitutes unethical behaviour and is unacceptable.\n\nIn general, an author should not submit for consideration in another journal a paper that has been published previously, except in the form of an abstract or as part of a published lecture or academic thesis or as an electronic preprint.\n\nPublication of some kinds of articles (e.g. clinical guidelines, translations) in more than one journal is sometimes justifiable, provided certain conditions are met. The authors and editors of the journals concerned must agree to the secondary publication, which must reflect the same data and interpretation of the primary document. The primary reference must be cited in the secondary publication. Further detail on acceptable forms of secondary publication can be found from the ICMJE1.\n\nConfidentiality\n\nInformation obtained in the course of confidential services, such as refereeing manuscripts or grant applications, must not be used without the explicit written permission of the author of the work involved in these services.\n\nAuthorship of the paper\n\nAuthorship should be limited to those who have made a significant contribution to the conception, design, execution, or interpretation of the reported study.Â Â All those who have made substantial contributions should be listed as co-authors.\n\nWhere there are others who have participated in certain substantive aspects of the paper (e.g. language editing or medical writing), they should be recognised in the acknowledgements section.\n\nThe corresponding author should ensure that all appropriate co-authors and no inappropriate co-authors are included on the paper, and that all co-authors have seen and approved the final version of the paper and have agreed to its submission for publication.\n\nAuthors are expected to consider carefully the list and order of authors before submitting their manuscript and provide the definitive list of authors at the time of the original submission. Only in exceptional circumstances will the Editor consider (at their discretion) the addition, deletion or rearrangement of authors after the manuscript has been submitted and the author must clearly flag any such request to the Editor. All authors must agree with any such addition, removal or rearrangement.\n\nAuthors take collective responsibility for the work.Â Â Each individual author is accountable for ensuring that questions related to the accuracy or integrity of any part of the work are appropriately investigated and resolved.\n\nIndividual journals may have particular definitions of authorship (e.g. medical journals may follow the ICMJE definition of authorship1, and authors should ensure that they comply with the policies of the relevant journal.\n\nThe use of generative AI and AI-assisted technologies in scientific writing\n\nThis policy has been triggered by the rise of generative AI and AI-assisted technologies which are expected to increasingly be used by content creators. The policy aims to provide greater transparency and guidance to authors, readers, reviewers, editors and contributors. Elsevier willÂ monitor this development and will adjust or refine this policy when appropriate. Please note the policy only refers to the writing process, and not to the use of AI tools to analyse and draw insights from data as part of the research process.\n\nWhere authors use generative AI and AI-assisted technologies in the writing process, these technologies should only be used to improveÂ readabilityÂ and language of the work. Applying the technology should be done with human oversight and control and authors should carefully review and edit the result, because AI can generate authoritative-sounding output thatÂ can be incorrect, incomplete or biased.Â The authors are ultimately responsible and accountable for the contents of the work.\n\nAuthors should disclose in their manuscript the use of AI and AI-assisted technologies and a statement will appear in the published work. Declaring the use of these technologies supports transparency and trust between authors, readers, reviewers, editors and contributors and facilitates compliance with the terms of use of the relevant tool or technology.\n\nAuthors should not list AI and AI-assisted technologies as an author or co-author, nor cite AI as an author. Authorship implies responsibilities and tasks that can only be attributed to and performed by humans.Â Each (co-) author is accountable for ensuring that questions related to the accuracy or integrity of any part of the work are appropriately investigated and resolved and authorship requires the ability to approve the final version of the work and agree to its submission. Authors are also responsible for ensuring that the work is original, that the stated authors qualify for authorship, and the work does not infringe third party rights, and should familiarize themselves with ourÂ Ethics in Publishing policyÂ before they submit.\n\nThe use of generative AI and AI-assisted tools in figures, images and artwork\n\nWe do not permit the use of Generative AI or AI-assisted tools to create or alter images in submitted manuscripts. This may include enhancing, obscuring, moving, removing, or introducing a specific feature within an image or figure. Adjustments of brightness, contrast, or color balance are acceptable if and as long as they do not obscure or eliminate any information present in the original. Image forensics tools or specialized software might be applied to submitted manuscripts to identify suspected image irregularities.\n\nThe only exception is if the use of AI or AI-assisted tools is part of the research design or research methods (such as in AI-assisted imaging approaches to generate or interpret the underlying research data, for example in the field of biomedical imaging). If this is done, such use must be described in a reproducible manner in the methods section. This should include an explanation of how the AI or AI-assisted tools were used in the image creation or alteration process, and the name of the model or tool, version and extension numbers, and manufacturer. Authors should adhere to the AI softwareâs specific usage policies and ensure correct content attribution. Where applicable, authors could be asked to provide pre-AI-adjusted versions of images and/or the composite raw images used to create the final submitted versions, for editorial assessment.\n\nThe use of generative AI or AI-assisted tools in the production of artwork such as for graphical abstracts is not permitted. The use of generative AI in the production of cover art may in some cases be allowed, if the author obtains prior permission from the journal editor and publisher, can demonstrate that all necessary rights have been cleared for the use of the relevant material, and ensures that there is correct content attribution.\n\nJurisdictional claims\n\nElsevier respects the decisions taken by its authors as to how they choose to designate territories and identify their affiliations in their published content. Elsevierâs policy is to take a neutral position with respect to territorial disputes or jurisdictional claims, including, but not limited to, maps and institutional affiliations. For journals that Elsevier publishes on behalf of a third party owner, the owner may set its own policy on these issues.\n\nMaps: Readers should be able to locate any study areas shown within maps using common mapping platforms. Maps should only show the area actually studied and authors should not include a location map which displays a larger area than the bounding box of the study area. Authors should add a note clearly stating that \"map lines delineate study areas and do not necessarily depict accepted national boundariesâ. During the review process, Elsevierâs editors may request authors to change maps if these guidelines are not followed.\n\nInstitutional affiliations: Authors should use either the full, standard title of their institution or the standard abbreviation of the institutional name so that the institutional name can be independently verified for research integrity purposes.\n\nHazards and human or animal subjects\n\nIf the work involves chemicals, procedures or equipment that have any unusual hazards inherent in their use, the author must clearly identify these in the manuscript.\n\nIf the work involves the use of animal or human subjects, the author should ensure that the manuscript contains a statement that all procedures were performed in compliance with relevant laws and institutional guidelines and that the appropriate institutional committee(s) have approved them. Authors should include a statement in the manuscript that informed consent was obtained for experimentation with human subjects.Â Â The privacy rights of human subjects must always be observed.\n\nFor human subjects, the author should ensure that the work described has been carried out in accordance with The Code of Ethics of the World Medical Association (Declaration of Helsinki) for experiments involving humans11.Â Â All animal experiments should comply with the ARRIVE guidelines12 and should be carried out in accordance with the U.K. Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 and associated guidelines13, orÂ Â EU Directive 2010/63/EU on the protection of animals used for scientific purposes14, or the U.S. Public Health Service Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and, as applicable, the Animal Welfare Act15.\n\nAppropriate consents, permissions and releases must be obtained where an author wishes to include case details or other personal information or images of patients and any other individuals in an Elsevier publication. Written consents must be retained by the author and copies of the consents or evidence that such consents have been obtained must be provided to Elsevier on request16.\n\nDeclaration of competing interests\n\nWAME define conflict of interest as âa divergence between an individualâs private interests (competing interests) and his or her responsibilities to scientific and publishing activities, such that a reasonable observer might wonder if the individualâs behavior or judgment was motivated by considerations of his or her competing interestsâ17. All authors should disclose in their manuscript any financial and personal relationships with other people or organisations that could be viewed as inappropriately influencing (bias) their work.\n\nAll sources of financial support for the conduct of the research and/or preparation of the article should be disclosed, as should the role of the sponsor(s), if any, in study design; in the collection, analysis and interpretation of data; in the writing of the report; and in the decision to submit the article for publication. If the funding source(s) had no such involvement then this should be stated.\n\nExamples of potential conflicts of interest which should be disclosed include employment, consultancies, stock ownership, honoraria, paid expert testimony, patent applications/registrations, and grants or other funding. Potential conflicts of interest should be disclosed at the earliest possible stage17.\n\nNotification of fundamental errors\n\nWhen an author discovers a significant error or inaccuracy in their own published work, it is the authorâs obligation to promptly notify the journal editor or publisher and cooperate with the editor to retract or correct the paper if deemed necessary by the editor. If the editor or the publisher learn from a third party that a published work contains an error, it is the obligation of the author to cooperate with the editor, including providing evidence to the editor where requested.\n\nImage integrity\n\nIt is not acceptable to enhance, obscure, move, remove, or introduce a specific feature within an image. Adjustments of brightness, contrast, or color balance are acceptable if and as long as they do not obscure or eliminate any information present in the original. Manipulating images for improved clarity is accepted, but manipulation for other purposes could be seen as scientific ethical abuse and will be dealt with accordingly18.\n\nAuthors should comply with any specific policy for graphical images applied by the relevant journal, e.g. providing the original images as supplementary material with the article, or depositing these in a suitable repository\n\nClinical trial transparency\n\nElsevier supports clinical trial transparency.Â Â For relevant journals, authors are expected to conform to industry best standards in in clinical trial registration and presentation, for example the CONSORT guidelines, as further set out in the policies of the relevant journal1,Â 2."
