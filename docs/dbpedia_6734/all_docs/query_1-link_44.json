        "text": "Edge速 3D Microscopy for Research and Industry\n\nOverview\n\nEdge innovates PLUG & PLAY accessories to convert your current light microscope into a 3D image analysis system. Edge 3D Panfocal Microscopy offers confocal-like results at 1/10th the price.\n\nThe Edge 3D Panfocal Imaging System is compatible with your upright or inverted microscope, with transmitted, reflected and fluorescence illumination. It's simple to set up. Just attach a Prior focus device to your microscope's focus knob, and then download the Edge 3D Panfocal Software onto your Windows 10 computer. The Panfocal software takes control of your microscope focus and USB camera to automate Z-focus stacking and produce 3D images with dramatically extended depth of field.\n\nThe optional Edge 3D Illumination System accessory for transmitted light microscopes for live-cell imaging provides real-time 3D without z-focus stacking. The 3D illuminator offers extraordinary 2D capabilities such as superior resolution and contrast with extended depth of focus.\n\nWhy 3D?\n\nReveal Hidden Depth Information\n\nReduce misdiagnosis\n\nIncrease productivity\n\nWhy Edge速 3D?\n\nFully automated 3D imaging\n\n5 Types of 3D Visualization\n\nPlug & play and user friendly\n\nMultiple features can be used on each operation mode...\n\nFeatures\n\nZ-Focus Stacking and Reconstruction\n\n3D Measurements\n\nTomography\n\nStereo 3D\n\nTopography Surface Profiling (reflective light only)\n\nModes of Operation\n\nTransmitted, Reflected, and Oblique Illumination\n\nBrightfield/darkfield\n\nPhase Contrast\n\nPolarization\n\nEpi-Fluorescence\n\nExample of features on a single specimen Z-Focus stacking 3D Tomography Topography Surface Profiling and 3D Measurement modes on a Firing Pin Impression Topography Surface Profiling Firing Pin impression in shell casing\n\nApplications\n\nNeuroscience\n\nThe nervous system is a complex three-dimensional network. Using the Edge-3D imaging system, your microscope becomes the ultimate Neurobiology microscope as it defines and reveals otherwise ambiguous areas in samples.\n\nForensic Science\n\nEdge-3D provides increased visual information and several modes of imaging that makes it the perfect tool for Forensic Science.\n\nIndustry\n\nThe full depth of focus 3D features of the Edge Imaging System make it ideal for examining a large range of different industrial products for quality control, production line vision, and failure analysis applications.\n\nGeology\n\nWith Edge-3D technology you can examine rocks, pebbles, sand or polished sections, all with amazing three-dimensional clarity. The rotational 3D motion movie to the right demonstrates how much 3D information exists even in a polished section of a meteroite.\n\nBiology\n\nEdge's extended depth of focus features provide greatly enhanced imaging of thick, real-world specimens encountered in applications such as Marine Biology and Plant Biology.\n\nMicroelectronics\n\nThe Edge 3D Imaging System will help to solve the difficult problems encountered in visualizing the placement and integrity of circuitry components, such as bond testing application as seen in the image on the right.\n\nPathology\n\nCytopathology is a perfect application for the Edge 3D Imaging System microscope as specimens such as PAP smears and needle biopsies are very three-dimensional by nature. The rich depth information that the Edge 3D Imaging System provides results in less false negatives. We encourage our customers to section their samples 50 micron thick, rather than the standard 5 micron sections. Three-dimensional visualization of thick samples improves both productivity and accuracy.\n\nEdge速 3D Basic Panfocal Imaging System\n\nYour Microscope, Computer, Monitor + Prior Focus Device + Edge 3D Software and Glasses\n\nFeatures\n\nCompatible with your current microscope\n\nTransmitted, reflected, or epi-fluorescence illumination\n\nCompatible with most optical systems, including\n\nBrightfield, Darkfield\n\nPhase Contrast DIC\n\nPolarization\n\nSix Modes of 3D Imaging\n\nMotion parallax 3D movie loops\n\nReconstructed 2D version of Z-stack\n\nFull-focus reconstructed stereo 3D\n\n3D profiling of surface topology\n\n4D stereo movie loops\n\n3D measurement of specimen features\n\nEdge 3D Panfocal Imaging System includes software and 3D glasses only. You must use your own microscope, computer, monitor.\n\nPrior Scientific Z-Focus\n\nPrior Scientific Z-Focus includes ES10ZE Focus controller, PS3H122 Focus drive.\n\nSelect matching Focus Sleeve when ordering. *"
