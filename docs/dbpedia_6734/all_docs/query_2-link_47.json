        "text": "About the Program\n\nBachelor of Arts (BA)\n\nThe Analytics major [formerly Operations Research and Management Science (ORMS)] is designed for students in the College of Letters & Science. In the Analytics major, students will develop solid quantitative and data-driven problem solving skills through core courses in computing, probability/statistics, optimization, and data analytics, and will learn how to apply these skills in solving problems in an area of their choice. It gives students the flexibility to learn more about a particular field of interest in which they can apply these skills.\n\nThe major is very math intensive and is appropriate for students who enjoy and are good at mathematics, computers, and solving practical, multidisciplinary problems.\n\nDeclaring the Major\n\nAnalytics is a high-demand major in L&S.\n\nFirst-year students applying to Berkeley Letters & Science will be guaranteed admission into the Analytics major if they selected Analytics as their primary major on their UC Berkeley admissions application. Students are guaranteed a spot in the Analytics major, subject to completing the major prerequisites, maintaining good academic standing in L&S, and filing a declaration form.\n\nNewly admitted first year students who did not indicate Analytics as their first choice in their application should refer to the L&S High Demand major policy.\n\nThe opportunities for being admitted into the Analytics major after enrollment at UC Berkeley will be extremely limited, and applying to the Analytics major via the comprehensive review process does not guarantee a spot in the major. If you have an interest in the Analytics major, we strongly encourage you to select Analytics as your primary major during the UC application process. If you opt to change to the Analytics major after being admitted to Berkeley, you will be required to have an alternate plan to declare a non-high demand major as a back-up.\n\nFor more information on which majors are high-demand, please visit the \"Admissions\" page for the College of Letters and Science on the Berkeley Academic Guide.\n\nPrerequisite Coursework\n\nAll four prerequisite classes (MATH 53, MATH 54, UGBA 10X, and either ECON 1, ECON 2 or ECON C3) must be completed prior to acceptance to the major and all must be taken for a letter grade. Students should declare the major during the semester in which they are enrolled in their final prerequisites but before their 5th semester.\n\nMany factors are considered in determining admission. The main criterion, however, is academic performance as measured by the Berkeley GPA in the prerequisite courses. Since this major is capped, planning for an alternate major is recommended. There is an Operations Research concentration in the Math Department that might be a good choice if students are not admitted to the Analytics major.\n\nHonors Program\n\nStudents with a grade point average (GPA) of at least 3.5 overall and 3.7 in the major upper division coursework should consider participating in the Analytics honors program. To graduate with honors, a student must find a faculty sponsor appropriate for an original research project that he or she wishes to do and enroll in two semesters (6 units) of the honors thesis courses IND ENG H196A and IND ENG H196B\n\nAlternatively, a student may take two approved graduate courses in Operations Research or a related field, and achieve at least an A- in each course. Courses used for the honors program cannot be used to fulfill the requirements for the Analytics major or any IEOR graduate program. The student must also maintain a minimum 3.5 overall GPA and 3.7 in the major at the time of graduation.\n\nMinor Program\n\nThere is no minor program in Analytics. However, students interested in an Analytics minor may be interested in the Industrial Engineering and Operations Research minor.\n\nVisit Department Website\n\nCollege Requirements\n\nUndergraduate students must fulfill the following requirements in addition to those required by their major program.\n\nFor a detailed lists of L&S requirements, please see Overview tab to the right in this guide or visit the L&S Degree Requirements webpage. For College advising appointments, please visit the L&S Advising Pages.\n\nUniversity of California Requirements\n\nEntry Level Writing\n\nAll students who will enter the University of California as freshmen must demonstrate their command of the English language by fulfilling the Entry Level Writing requirement. Fulfillment of this requirement is also a prerequisite to enrollment in all reading and composition courses at UC Berkeley and must be taken for a letter grade.\n\nAmerican History and American Institutions\n\nThe American History and American Institutions requirements are based on the principle that all U.S. residents who have graduated from an American university should have an understanding of the history and governmental institutions of the United States.\n\nBerkeley Campus Requirement\n\nAmerican Cultures\n\nAll undergraduate students at Cal need to take and pass this campus requirement course in order to graduate. The requirement offers an exciting intellectual environment centered on the study of race, ethnicity and culture of the United States. AC courses are plentiful and offer students opportunities to be part of research-led, highly accomplished teaching environments, grappling with the complexity of American Culture.\n\nCollege of Letters & Science Essential Skills Requirements\n\nQuantitative Reasoning\n\nThe Quantitative Reasoning requirement is designed to ensure that students graduate with basic understanding and competency in math, statistics, or computer/data science. The requirement may be satisfied by exam or by taking an approved course taken for a letter grade.\n\nForeign Language\n\nThe Foreign Language requirement may be satisfied by demonstrating proficiency in reading comprehension, writing, and conversation in a foreign language equivalent to the second semester college level, either by passing an exam or by completing approved course work taken for a letter grade.\n\nReading and Composition\n\nIn order to provide a solid foundation in reading, writing, and critical thinking the College of Letters and Science requires two semesters of lower division work in composition in sequence. Students must complete parts A & B reading and composition courses in sequential order by the end of their fourth semester for a letter grade.\n\nCollege of Letters & Science 7 Course Breadth Requirements\n\nBreadth Requirements\n\nThe undergraduate breadth requirements provide Berkeley students with a rich and varied educational experience outside of their major program. As the foundation of a liberal arts education, breadth courses give students a view into the intellectual life of the University while introducing them to a multitude of perspectives and approaches to research and scholarship. Engaging students in new disciplines and with peers from other majors, the breadth experience strengthens interdisciplinary connections and context that prepares Berkeley graduates to understand and solve the complex issues of their day.\n\nUnit Requirements\n\n120 total units\n\nOf the 120 units, 36 must be upper division units\n\nOf the 36 upper division units, 6 must be taken in courses offered outside your major department\n\nResidence Requirements\n\nFor units to be considered in \"residence,\" you must be registered in courses on the Berkeley campus as a student in the College of Letters & Science. Most students automatically fulfill the residence requirement by attending classes at Cal for four years, or two years for transfer students. In general, there is no need to be concerned about this requirement, unless you graduate early, go abroad for a semester or year, or want to take courses at another institution or through UC Extension during your senior year. In these cases, you should make an appointment to meet an L&S College adviser to determine how you can meet the Senior Residence Requirement.\n\nNote: Courses taken through UC Extension do not count toward residence.\n\nSenior Residence Requirement\n\nAfter you become a senior (with 90 semester units earned toward your B.A. degree), you must complete at least 24 of the remaining 30 units in residence in at least two semesters. To count as residence, a semester must consist of at least 6 passed units. Intercampus Visitor, EAP, and UC Berkeley-Washington Program (UCDC) units are excluded.\n\nYou may use a Berkeley Summer Session to satisfy one semester of the Senior Residence requirement, provided that you successfully complete 6 units of course work in the Summer Session and that you have been enrolled previously in the college.\n\nModified Senior Residence Requirement\n\nParticipants in the UC Education Abroad Program (EAP), Berkeley Summer Abroad, or the UC Berkeley Washington Program (UCDC) may meet a Modified Senior Residence requirement by completing 24 (excluding EAP) of their final 60 semester units in residence. At least 12 of these 24 units must be completed after you have completed 90 units.\n\nUpper Division Residence Requirement\n\nYou must complete in residence a minimum of 18 units of upper division courses (excluding UCEAP units), 12 of which must satisfy the requirements for your major."
