        "text": "Competition objectives\n\nThe Alzheimer's Association recognizes the need to support the training of clinician scientists in Alzheimer's and related dementia. For the purpose of this program, a clinician scientist is defined as an individual already trained, licensed and practicing in a clinical field that includes patient contact (e.g., neurology, psychiatry, geriatrics, psychology) or patient-related diagnostic studies (e.g., neuropathology and radiology).\n\nApplicants who are within 15 years of receiving their M.D., D.O. or Ph.D. (or equivalent) and have licensure for clinical practice, including postdoctoral fellows through Assistant Professors, are eligible. Positions higher than Assistant Professor will not be considered.\n\nThe areas of research that the clinician scientist proposes for funding are not limited to patient-oriented, human subject research, but may also include translational research specifically designed to develop treatments or enhance diagnosis of neurological disease. These translational areas of research include epidemiologic or behavioral studies, clinical trials, studies of disease mechanisms, mapping disease features or spread the development of new technologies, and health services and outcomes research. Disease related basic science studies not directly involving humans or human tissue are also encouraged if the primary goal is the development of therapies, diagnostic tests, or other tools to prevent or mitigate neurological diseases.\n\nThe Alzheimer’s Association feels strongly that the mentoring and involvement of researchers from diverse backgrounds and perspectives is essential to engaging cutting edge ideas and thinking in addressing scientific gaps for Alzheimer’s and related dementia.\n\nThe mechanism of the award is the individual research grant. The maximum allowable duration is three years (minimum 2 years).\n\nFunding and award period\n\nEach AACSF-D award is limited to $250,000. Component parts of the award include:\n\nA total of $230,000 (including direct and indirect costs) will be awarded for costs related to the proposed research for up to three years (Award should be a minimum 2 years. For a 2-year award the total is limited to $200,000 with direct and indirect costs). Requests in any given year may not exceed $100,000 (direct and indirect costs). Indirect costs are capped at 10 percent of total direct costs and are inclusive of indirect costs for the implementing institution as well as any to subcontracts.\n\nA total of $12,500 over a three-year period may be requested for travel purposes and is not to exceed $7,000 in any given year. If you request the full $12,500 towards just two years of travel and are requesting a three year award you will not be able to request travel funds for one of those years.\n\nThe remaining funds are two $10,000 research stipends ($10,000 to the applicant and $10,000 to the primary mentor), which are not guaranteed and are awarded only upon successful completion of the award. Successful completion of the award includes, but is not limited to, successfully achieving project aims and accomplishing all of the Fellowship benchmarks. These research stipends are to be applied to sustaining ongoing research in the Alzheimer's field and will be paid to the applicant‘s and mentor‘s respective institutions at the time of release.\n\nThe Principal Investigator (PI) must commit up to an average of 2 protected days per week (40%) research effort during each funding year.\n\nEligibility\n\nApplicants must be clinicians (clinical fellows, postdoctoral fellows through assistant professors; or equivalent positions) interested in an academic career who have:\n\nFull-time positions\n\nLess than 15 years of research experience after receipt of their terminal degree\n\nLicensure for clinical practice and evaluate patients\n\nThe Alzheimer's Association will make exceptions to the terminal degree requirement when the individual applicant has a full-time faculty position of Assistant Professor (or equivalent) or Associate Professor and is expert in the area of public health, social work, neuropsychology, legal, bioethics or a related area of psychosocial research\n\nSpecific for the AACSF-D program, eligible applicants have the same requirements as the AACSF-D program, but are an underrepresented faculty in biomedical and behavioral research on a national, international or institutional basis. The world’s low and middle income countries (LMICs) are a diverse group by size, population, and income level. Researchers from these countries are encouraged to apply.\n\nApplicants must submit a Diversity Self Statement (one paragraph max) during the letter of intent (LOI) stage outlining the applicant’s status and eligibility for this program. Additional details regarding what may be defined as underrepresented include:\n\nApplicants from the United States will be subject to the definitions as stated by the National Institutes of Health: NIH-designated U.S. health disparity populations include Blacks/ African Americans, Hispanics/ Latinos, American Indians/ Alaska Natives, Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders, socioeconomically disadvantaged populations, underserved rural populations, persons with disabilities (defined by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) as a person with a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities), minoritized sexual and gender populations, and Individuals from economically developing nations of Africa, Asia and Latin America and the Caribbean.\n\nApplicants born in any of the economically developing nations of Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean are eligible granted that all other criteria regarding career stage are met. The Alzheimer's Association will not require proof of American citizenship or a Permanent Resident Status.\n\nApplicants employed by a university that is located in an economically developing nation of Africa, Asia and Latin America, are eligible granted that all other criteria regarding career stage are met.\n\nAny questions related to eligibility, please contact the Alzheimer's Association at grantsapp@alz.org prior to submitting an LOI. No exceptions will be made after the LOI deadline has passed. The Alzheimer's Association reserves the right to require additional documentation if necessary.\n\nThe self-statement will not be included in the information shared with reviewers and will only be used to confirm eligibility to this program. This statement will only be accessible to the applicant and the Alzheimer’s Association through their Proposal Central Account (if the applicant gives others access to the LOI, they will be able to view all attachments).\n\nNote: Alzheimer’s Association grants are generally open to scientists and researchers across the globe; however, as a U.S.-based charity, the Alzheimer’s Association is subject to, and complies with, U.S. law. As a result, the Alzheimer’s Association cannot award, and will not award, grants in violation of applicable U.S. statutes and regulations. This means, among other things, that the Alzheimer’s Association cannot, and will not, fund any individual or entity (i) that is subject to U.S. comprehensive or targeted sanctions or if awarding funding would result in a violation of such sanctions, (ii) that is on the U.S. List of Specially Designated Nationals or entities owned or controlled by such persons, or (iii) when doing so is otherwise prohibited by U.S. laws related to combating terrorism.\n\nIneligibility\n\nIneligibility criteria include:\n\nIndividuals who have a position of an Associate Professorship or above are not eligible.\n\nIndividuals currently enrolled as a student in a undergraduate, Master or Doctoral Program are not eligible, regardless of prior degree status.\n\nPlease refer to Section III: B.

Additionally, any potential change in Mentor role must be approved by the Association. This will be strictly adhered to and only in extreme circumstances will an exception be considered.\n\nThe Alzheimer's Association is pleased to partner with the Fred A. and Barbara M. Erb Family Foundation on this program. Based on the review process, one AACSF/AACSF-D awardee each cycle will be identified as the Alzheimer's Association Fred A. Erb Clinical Research Science Fellowship. This Alzheimer's Association Fred A. Erb Clinical Research Science Fellowship will include a small amount of additional funding over the course of the grant as well.\n\nContact information"
