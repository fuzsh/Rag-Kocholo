        "text": "What Physicists and Astronomers Do About this section\n\nPhysicists and astronomers study the interactions of matter and energy. Theoretical physicists and astronomers may study the nature of time or the origin of the universe. Some physicists design and perform experiments with sophisticated equipment such as particle accelerators, electron microscopes, and lasers.\n\nDuties\n\nPhysicists and astronomers typically do the following:\n\nDevelop scientific theories and models to explain the properties of the natural world, such as the force of gravity or the formation of subatomic particles\n\nPlan and conduct scientific experiments and studies to test theories and discover properties of matter and energy\n\nWrite proposals and apply for research funding\n\nDo mathematical calculations to analyze physical and astronomical data, such as for new material properties or the existence of planets in distant solar systems\n\nDesign new scientific equipment, such as telescopes and lasers\n\nDevelop computer software to analyze and model data\n\nWrite scientific papers for publication\n\nPresent research findings at conferences and lectures\n\nPhysicists explore the fundamental properties and laws that govern space, time, energy, and matter. They may study theory, design and perform experiments, or apply their knowledge in developing materials or equipment.\n\nAstronomers study planets, stars, and other celestial bodies. They use ground-based equipment, such as optical telescopes, and space-based equipment, such as the Hubble Space Telescope. Some astronomers study distant galaxies and phenomena such as black holes and neutron stars. Others monitor space debris that could interfere with satellite operations.\n\nMany physicists and astronomers work in applied research. They use their knowledge to develop technology or solve problems in areas such as energy storage, electronics, communications, and navigation. Others work in basic research to develop theories that explain concepts such as what gravity is or how the universe was formed.\n\nAstronomers and physicists typically work on research teams with engineers, technicians, and other scientists. Senior astronomers and physicists may assign tasks to other team members and monitor their progress. They also may need to find and apply for research funding.\n\nExperimental physicists develop equipment or sensors to study properties of matter, create theories, and test theories through experiments. Theoretical and computational physicists develop concepts that predict properties of materials or describe unexplained results. Although all of physics involves the same fundamental principles, physicists generally specialize in one of many subfields. The following are examples of physicist job titles:\n\nAtomic, molecular, and optical physicists study atoms, simple molecules, electrons, and light and the interactions among them. Some look for ways to control the states of individual atoms, because such control might allow for further miniaturization or might contribute toward developing new materials or technology.\n\nComputational physicists study the use of algorithms, numerical analysis, and datasets to explore the interaction between theoretical and experimental physics. They explore complex phenomena in atoms, molecules, plasmas, and high-energy particles; problems in astrophysics; and applied phenomena, such as traffic, the behavior of oceans, and biological dynamics.\n\nCondensed matter and materials physicists study the physical properties of matter in molecules, nanostructures, or novel compounds. They study a wide range of phenomena, such as superconductivity, liquid crystals, sensors, and nanomachines.\n\nHealth physicists study the effects of radiation on people, communities, and the environment. They manage the beneficial use of radiation while protecting workers and the public from potential hazards posed by radiation.\n\nMedical physicists work in healthcare and use their knowledge of physics to develop new medical technologies and radiation-based treatments. For example, some develop safer radiation therapies for cancer patients. Others develop improved imaging technologies for radiant energy, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and ultrasound imaging.\n\nParticle and nuclear physicists study the properties of atomic and subatomic particles, such as quarks, electrons, and nuclei and the forces that cause their interactions.\n\nPlasma physicists study plasmas, a distinct state of matter that occur naturally in stars and interplanetary space and artificially in products such as neon signs and fluorescent lights. These physicists may study ways to create fusion reactors as a potential energy source.\n\nQuantum information physicists study ways to use quantum objects, such as atoms and photons, to probe information processing, computing, and cryptography. They focus on ways to use the fundamental nature of quantum mechanics and its associated uncertainties.\n\nUnlike physicists, astronomers cannot experiment on their subjects, which are so far away that they cannot be touched or interacted with. Therefore, astronomers generally make observations or work on theory. Observational astronomers view celestial objects and collect data on them. Theoretical astronomers analyze, model, and speculate about systems and how they work and evolve. The following are examples of astronomer job titles:\n\nCosmologists and extragalactic/galactic, planetary, and stellar astronomers study the creation, evolution, and possible futures of the universe and its galaxies, stars, planets, and solar systems. These astronomers develop and test concepts, such as string theory and dark-matter and dark-energy theories, and study models of galactic and stellar evolution, planetary formation, and interactions between stars.\n\nOptical and radio astronomers use optical, radio, and gravitational-wave telescopes to study the motions and evolution of stars, galaxies, and the larger scale structure of the universe.\n\nPhysicists also may work in interdisciplinary fields, such as biophysics, chemical physics, and geophysics. For more information, see the profiles on biochemists and biophysicists and geoscientists.\n\nPeople who have a background in physics or astronomy also may become professors or teachers. For more information, see the profiles on high school teachers and postsecondary teachers.\n\nHow to Become a Physicist or Astronomer About this section\n\nPhysicists and astronomers typically need a Ph.D. for jobs in research and academia. However, physicist jobs in the federal government typically require a bachelor’s degree in physics.\n\nEducation\n\nA Ph.D. in physics, astronomy, or a related field is typically required for jobs in research or academia.\n\nGraduate students may concentrate in a subfield of physics or astronomy, such as condensed matter physics or cosmology. In addition to coursework in physics or astronomy, Ph.D. students need to take courses in math, such as calculus, linear algebra, and statistics. Computer science also may be useful for developing programs to gather, analyze, and model data.\n\nA bachelor’s degree in physical science or a related field, such as engineering, usually is required to enter a graduate program in physics or astronomy. Undergraduate physics programs typically include courses such as quantum mechanics, thermodynamics, and electromagnetism.\n\nUndergraduate students may choose to complete an internship to gain hands-on experience. The American Astronomical Society has a directory of internships for astronomy students, and the American Physical Society lists internships for physics students.\n\nJobseekers with a bachelor’s degree in physics usually are qualified to work as technicians and research assistants in related fields, such as engineering and computer science. Those with a bachelor’s degree in astronomy also may qualify to work as an assistant at an observatory. Students who do not want to continue their studies to the doctoral level may want to take courses in instrument building and computer science.\n\nMaster’s degree and bachelor’s degree holders may be eligible for jobs in the federal government. Others may become science teachers in middle schools or high schools.\n\nTraining\n\nPhysics and astronomy Ph.D. holders who seek employment as researchers may begin their careers in a postdoctoral research position, typically for 2 to 3 years. Senior scientists supervise these researchers as they gain experience and independence doing increasingly complex tasks.\n\nImportant Qualities\n\nAnalytical skills. Physicists and astronomers must evaluate their work and the work of others to avoid errors that could invalidate their research.\n\nCommunication skills. Physicists and astronomers present their research at conferences, to the public, and to others. They also write technical reports for publication and write proposals for research funding.\n\nCritical-thinking skills. Physicists and astronomers need to think logically in carrying out scientific experiments and studies. They must determine whether results and conclusions are accurate.\n\nInterpersonal skills. Physicists and astronomers must collaborate with others and therefore need to work well with team members and colleagues.\n\nMath skills. Physicists and astronomers do calculations involving calculus, geometry, algebra, and other areas of math. They must express their research in mathematical terms.\n\nProblem-solving skills. Physicists and astronomers use scientific observation and analysis, as well as creative thinking, to solve problems. For example, they may need to redesign their approach and find alternatives when an experiment or theory fails to produce the desired result.\n\nSelf-discipline. Physicists and astronomers need to be motivated, since their work may require them to focus on large datasets for long periods.\n\nLicenses, Certifications, and Registrations\n\nSome positions with the federal government, such as those involving nuclear energy, may require applicants to be U.S. citizens and hold a security clearance.\n\nAdvancement\n\nWith experience, physicists and astronomers may gain greater independence in their work and advance to senior positions. Experience also may lead to tenure for those in university positions. Some physicists and astronomers advance to become natural sciences managers."
