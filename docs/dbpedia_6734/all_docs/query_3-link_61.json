        "text": "Application of universal design to a science lab\n\nStudents with disabilities face access challenges to typical science labs in precollege and postsecondary settings. Access barriers may prevent a student from:\n\ngaining knowledge,\n\ndemonstrating knowledge, and\n\nfully participating in lab activities.\n\nThere are two approaches to making academic activities accessible to students with disabilitiesâ€”accommodations and universal design (UD). Accommodations are alternate formats, assistive technology, and other adjustments for specific students once they are enrolled in a class. For examples of accommodations in science classes, consult the publications Working Together: Science Teachers and Students with Disabilities and The Winning Equation: Access + Attitude = Success in Math and Science.\n\nUniversal Design\n\nThe Center for Universal Design defines universal design as \"the design of products and environments to be usable by all people, to the greatest extent possible, without the need for adaptation or specialized design.\" Applications of UD in education take proactive steps to create aademic products and environments that are accessible to students with a wide range of characteristics, including disabilities, thereby minimizing the need for future accommodations. For example, if a science lab contains an adjustable-height workstation, an accommodation will not be needed for a future student who uses a wheelchair that is too high for standard-height workstations. This workstation may also be comfortable for a student who needs to remain seated because of a health impairment or someone who is very tall or short in stature. In a science lab, UD can be applied to:\n\nlab climate;\n\nphysical access, usability, and safety;\n\ndelivery methods;\n\ninformation resources;\n\ninteraction; feedback;\n\nassessment; and\n\nplans for accommodations.\n\nMaking accommodations is reactive, whereas universal design is proactive.\n\nAccommodations\n\nFollowing are examples of accommodations that might benefit a student with a disability.\n\nUse wheelchair-accessible labs and field sites.\n\nTalk to a student about special learning needs and accommodation alternatives.\n\nProvide a lab partner.\n\nUse plastic instead of glass.\n\nAllow extra time for set up and completion of lab work.\n\nAddress safety procedures for students with a variety of sensory and mobility abilities.\n\nUse institutional resources for students with disabilities.\n\nTypical science lab accommodations for students with specific disabilities include those in the following lists.\n\nBlindness\n\nverbal descriptions of demonstrations and visual aids\n\nBraille text and raised-line images\n\nBraille or tactile ruler, compass, angles, protractor\n\nBraille equipment labels, notches, staples, fabric paint, and Braille at regular increments on tactile ruler, glassware, syringe, beam balance, stove, other science equipment\n\ndifferent textures (e.g., sand paper) to label areas on items\n\nLow Vision\n\nverbal descriptions of demonstrations and visual aids\n\npreferential seating to assure visual access to demonstrations\n\nlarge print, high contrast instructions and illustrations\n\nraised-line drawings or tactile models for illustrations\n\nlarge print laboratory signs and equipment labels\n\nvideo camera, computer or TV monitor to enlarge microscope images\n\nhand-held magnifier, binoculars\n\nlarge print calculator\n\nMobility Impairments\n\nwheelchair-accessible field site\n\nuncluttered lab; clear, wide aisles\n\npreferential seating to avoid physical barriers and assure visual access to demonstrations\n\nmirrors above the instructor giving a demonstration\n\nan enlarged screen\n\nwheelchair-accessible, adjustable-height work surface\n\nnon-slip mat\n\nutility and equipment controls within easy reach from seated position\n\nelectric stirrer, container filler\n\nsupport stand, beaker and object clamp; test tube rack\n\nhandles on beakers, objects, and equipment\n\nsurgical gloves to handle wet or slippery items\n\nmodified procedures to use larger weights and volumes\n\nextended eyepieces so students who use wheelchairs can use microscopes\n\nflexible connections to electrical, water, and gas lines\n\nsingle-action lever controls in place of knobs\n\nalternate lab storage methods (e.g.,\"Lazy Susan,\" storage cabinet on casters)\n\nDeaf and Hard of Hearing\n\npreferential seating to view demos and watch instructor captioning for video presentations\n\nwritten instructions prior to lab\n\nvisual lab warning signals\n\nLearning and Attention Disabilities\n\ncombination of written, verbal, and pictorial instructions with scaffolding\n\nrepeated demonstration of procedure and support practice\n\nfrequent, brief breaks\n\npreferential seating to avoid distractions and minimize extraneous stimuli\n\nscanning and speaking \"pen\"\n\nHealth Impairments\n\navoid chemical materials to which student is allergic or provide alternate assignment\n\nflexible schedule and time allocation\n\nUniversal Design Considerations\n\nSome of the accommodation suggestions listed above could be implemented within a lab now, anticipating that at some point a student with a disability may need access to the lab and that some changes may benefit all students. Here are some strategies that could be implemented in a science lab as a part of universal design efforts:\n\nProvide both written and verbal instructions.\n\nGive verbal and visual descriptions of demonstrations and visual aids.\n\nUse plastic instead of glass.\n\nAllow extra time for set up and completion of lab work.\n\nAddress safety procedures for students with a variety of sensory and mobility abilities, including the provision of visual lab warning signals.\n\nMake laboratory signs and equipment labels in large print, with high contrast.\n\nEnsure that field sites are wheelchair accessible.\n\nMaintain wide aisles and keep the lab uncluttered.\n\nIncorporate an adjustable-height work surface for at least one workstation.\n\nInstall a mirror above the location where demonstrations are typically given.\n\nUse lever controls instead of knobs.\n\nInstall flexible connections to water, gas, and electricity.\n\nBuy lab products that can be used by students with a variety of abilities (e.g., plastic lab products instead of glass, tactile models, large-print diagrams, non-slip mats, support stands, beaker and object clamps, handles on beakers and equipment, surgical gloves to handle slippery items, video camera with computer or TV monitor to enlarge microscope image).\n\nEnsure that utility and equipment controls are within easy reach from a standing or seated position.\n\nProvide surgical gloves for handling wet or slippery items.\n\nAdditional Resources\n\nDO-IT has created a collection of videos and publications that help teachers make math and science teachers coursework accessible to students with disabilities. They include:\n\nWorking Together: Science Teachers and Students with Disabilities\n\nThe Winning Equation: Access + Attitude = Success in Math and Science\n\nEqual Access: Science and Students with Sensory Impairments\n\nThese titles may be freely accessed online. DVDs can also be purchased from DO-IT.

The book Universal Design in Higher Education: From Principles to Practice published by Harvard Education Press shares perspectives of UD leaders nationwide.\n\nCommunication Hints\n\nTreat people with disabilities with the same respect and consideration with which you treat others. There are no strict rules when it comes to relating to people with disabilities. However, here are some helpful hints.\n\nGeneral\n\nAsk a person with a disability if they need help before providing assistance.\n\nTalk directly to the person with a disability, not through the person's companion or interpreter.\n\nRefer to a person's disability only if it is relevant to the conversation. If so, mention the person first and then the disability. \"A man who is blind\" is better than \"a blind man\" because it puts the person first.\n\nAvoid negative descriptions of a person's disability. For example, \"a person who uses a wheelchair\" is more appropriate than \"a person confined to a wheelchair.\" A wheelchair is not confiningâ€”it's liberating!\n\nDo not interact with a person's guide dog or service dog unless you have received permission to do so.\n\nBlind or Low Vision\n\nBe descriptive. Say, \"The computer is about three feet to your left,\" rather than \"The computer is over there.\"\n\nSpeak all of the content presented with overhead projections and other visuals.\n\nWhen guiding people with visual impairments, offer them your arm rather than grabbing or pushing them.\n\nLearning Disabilities\n\nOffer directions or instructions both orally and in writing. If asked, read instructions to individuals who have specific learning disabilities.\n\nMobility Impairments\n\nSit or otherwise position yourself at the approximate height of people sitting in wheelchairs when you interact.\n\nSpeech Impairments\n\nListen carefully. Repeat what you think you understand and then ask the person with a speech impairment to clarify or repeat the portion that you did not understand.\n\nDeaf or Hard of Hearing\n\nFace people with hearing impairments so they can see your lips. Avoid talking while chewing gum or eating.\n\nSpeak clearly at a normal volume. Speak louder only if requested.\n\nUse paper and pencil if the person who is deaf does not read lips or if more accurate communication is needed.\n\nIn groups raise hands to be recognized so the person who is deaf knows who is speaking. Repeat questions from audience members.\n\nWhen using an interpreter, speak directly to the person who is deaf; when an interpreter voices what a person who is deaf signs, look at the person who is deaf, not the interpreter.\n\nPsychiatric Impairments\n\nProvide information in clear, calm, respectful tones.\n\nAllow opportunities for addressing specific questions.\n\nAbout DO-IT\n\nDO-IT (Disabilities, Opportunities, Internetworking, and Technology) serves to increase the successful participation of individuals with disabilities in challenging academic programs such as those in science, engineering, mathematics, and technology.
