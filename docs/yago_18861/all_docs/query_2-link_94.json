        "text": "When news of Richard Attenborough's death was announced overnight, the Twittersphere rushed to pay their respects. But there was just one problem: they thought it was his brother David who had died.\n\nAttenborough was well known for his work in Brighton Rock, The Great Escape, Jurassic Park and Miracle on 34th Street, in a career spanning six decades. He later turned his attention to directing and producing, winning two Academy Awards for the 1982 Gandhi.\n\nAttenborough is also the brother of famous wildlife presenter David.\n\nDavid, who is two years younger at 88 and still very much alive, is the better known of the siblings as a famous naturalist and much loved narrator of BBC series including Life and Frozen Planet.\n\nMore informed users were quick to point out the mistake, with many expressing disbelief.\n\nRichard Attenborough had three children with his wife Sheila, who he had married aged 21.\n\nIncreasingly frail after falling down the stairs at home, Attenborough moved into a care home with his wife towards the end of his life.\n\nA British Lord, Attenborough championed the British film business through its triumphs and trials for more than 50 years as actor, Oscar-winning director and prolific movie-maker.\n\nHe had a grand vision and a deep desire to educate, decrying injustice and extolling heroes such as Gandhi and Steve Biko, a South African victim of apartheid.\n\nIt was Gandhi, arguably one of the least obvious successes in the history of the cinema, that marked the highlight of his remarkable career, clinching eight Oscars, including best film and best director.\n\nHis breadth of canvas and eye for detail were at their most impressive here, with Attenborough displaying a knack to control some 400,000 extras at the re-creation of Gandhi's funeral.\n\nAs an actor he was respected enough for top directors Satyajit Ray and Steven Spielberg to lure him out of self-imposed retirement to appear, respectively, in The Chess Players and the blockbuster Jurassic Park.\n\nHis highly emotional and effusive character was one of the most lampooned in the art world, where he was known as the \"original luvvy\" who was easily moved to tears.\n\nBut, above all, his deep passion and unflagging energy as actor, director, producer, fund-raiser and chairman of numerous charities were genuine, and his good-nature was renowned in a notoriously tough world of clashing giant egos which he inhabited."
