        "text": "The celebrated figure, who directed the Oscar-winning film Gandhi, had been being cared for full-time by staff at a nursing home where he lived with his wife Sheila Sim, also 92, whom he married in 1945.\n\nEarlier this year, his brother the television naturalist Sir David Attenborough, 86, said: \"He is coming up to 90. He's just not very well.\"\n\nIn 2008, Lord Attenborough suffered a stroke that resulted in a coma lasting several days. He had been in a wheelchair following a fall at his home.\n\nTributes poured in for one of the greatest British film icons of his time.\n\nRichard Attenborough holds his two Oscars for his film 'Gandhi'.

RIP.\"\n\nAttenborough made his name in films such Brighton Rock in 1947 and The Great Escape in 1963 and won a new tranche of fans in the dinosaur blockbuster Jurassic Park in 1993.\n\nHe was born in Cambridge, England, the son of Mary Clegg, who was one of the founders of the Marriage Guidance Council, and Frederick Levi Attenborough, a don at Emmanuel College.\n\nEducated at Wyggeston Grammar School for Boys in Leicester, he then went to the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA), of which he later became president.\n\nHis first screen role was as a cowardly sailor in the 1942 film In Which We Serve. During the war, he also served in the Royal Air Force.\n\nBut his breakthrough role was as the psychopathic young gangster, Pinkie Brown, in the 1947 film adaptation of Graham Greene's novel, Brighton Rock.\n\nOn the stage, Attenborough and his wife both appeared in the original production of Agatha Christie's The Mousetrap, which became one of the world's longest-running theatre productions.\n\nIn the 1960s, he appeared in film such as Seance on a Wet Afternoon and Guns at Batasi.\n\nHe won a string of awards for his acting but his greatest success was as a director.\n\nHis 1982 film Gandhi won best picture and he was given the best director award.\n\nAfter a breaking from acting, he returned to the screen in 1993 as dinosaur park developer John Hammond in Steven Spielberg's Jurassic Park.\n\nRead more:\n\nâ€¢ Leaked images give first look at Jurassic Park IV\n\nAttenborough also worked as the chairman of Capital Radio, the president of BAFTA, president of the Gandhi Foundation, and president of the British National Film and Television School.\n\nHe was a lifelong supporter of Chelsea Football Club, serving as a director of the club for 13 years from 1969. Since 1993, he had held the honorary position of Life Vice President.\n\nTributes poured in for one of the greatest British thespians of the modern age.\n\nTragedy struck the star and his family when his elder daughter Jane and her daughter Lucy were killed in the South Asian tsunami on Boxing Day in 2004.\n\nNext trending article: Biggest quake since '89 hits California's Bay Area\n\n- Independent"
