Everyone at The Mousetrap was honoured to be able to dedicate yesterday’s performances in London and Nottingham to her memory.\"\n\nHe added: \"Nearly 50 years after The Mousetrap opened in 1952, Sheila and Richard helped and encouraged us in the creation of Mousetrap Theatre Projects, which takes thousands of disadvantaged young people to the best of West End theatre every year.\"\n\nInvalid email\n\nWe use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.
