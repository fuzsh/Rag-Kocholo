        "text": "A stellar line up from the British film industry have gathered in central London for a service to remember Oscar-winning director Richard Attenborough.\n\nDame Judi Dench and Sir Michael Caine were among those who celebrated \"a truly great man\" of stage and screen.\n\nAlso attending were Alan Rickman, Jane Seymour and Sir John Hurt.\n\nLord Attenborough, a stalwart of the British film industry for more than half a century, died aged 90 last year.\n\nSir Ben Kingsley and Lord Attenborough's brother, TV wildlife presenter Sir David Attenborough, were among those who spoke during the Westminster Abbey ceremony.\n\nIt was led by the Dean of Westminster, the very reverend Dr John Hall.\n\nPaying tribute to Lord Attenborough, Dr Hall said: \"We come to celebrate the life and achievement of Richard Attenborough, a truly great man: Certainly a star of stage and screen, but also a pioneer film-maker, an exemplary leader of his profession, a man of deep commitment, of great generosity of spirit, and of personal warmth.\"\n\n\"We shall also pray that his story might continue to inspire and inform others to follow his example, that our world might become a little brighter and better.\"\n\nBorn in Cambridge in 1923, Lord Attenborough was a respected actor before becoming a celebrated director.\n\nHe appeared in films such as Brighton Rock, The Great Escape and 1993 dinosaur blockbuster Jurassic Park.\n\nAmong his career highlights was the 1982 film Gandhi, which won eight Academy Awards, including best film and best director.\n\nSir Ben, who played Gandhi, joined actress Geraldine James to read from Ghandi's writings during the service of thanksgiving."
