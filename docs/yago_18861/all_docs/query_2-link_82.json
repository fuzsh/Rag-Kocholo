        "text": "We finally caught up with SEE HOW THEY RUN, actually only a year or so after its release.\n\nI was drawn to the movie for slightly unusual reasons, I suspect. Of course the idea of a period English cosy crime whodunnit set in a detailed reproduction of 1950s theatreland appealed to me, and the casting of Saoirse Ronan Sam Rockwell Adrien Brody Reece Shearsmith Shirley Henderson appealed.\n\nBut I was interested in the fact that one of the real-life characters who turns up in the movie is Edana Romney, writer-star of the Cocteauesque gothic thriller CORRIDOR OF MIRRORS. Including her seemed a clue to a weird and idiosyncratic sensibility.\n\nThis is the film’s one major disappointment — Romney appears for the very uneccentric reason that she was married to producer John Woolf (Shearsmith), so she plays the role of jealous wife, or rather Sian Clifford, who plays her, plays her playing it, and her accomplishments in the cinema are ignored.\n\nActually, this relates to another, more minor disappointment — how can you do a murder mystery with John Woolf in it and neglect the fact that his producing partner was his gay brother James? There could be a good plot twist in that.\n\nThe racially-blind casting which is now dominant in the UK occasionally sets up curious questions — Woolf is shown carrying on an affair with his P.A., played by Pippa Bennett-Warner, who is Black. There’s a blackmail attempt, but the racial angle plays no role, is never mentioned, as it surely would be in the early 1950s. Shoehorning diversity into heritage cinema is surely a good thing: pretending race isn’t a social factor, and that things weren’t worse in the past, is not unambiguously good. The solution? Be brilliant. And write more actual Black characters.\n\nOtherwise this is good fun. Ronan and Rockwell make a great team and Mark Chappell’s plotting and dialogue are both clever enough to pull off the necessary laughs and surprises. It all needs to be, in some hard-to-define way, 10% better to fully achieve the KNIVES OUT cosy place pleasure it’s aiming for, but we found it very pleasurable.\n\nDirector Tom George has seen a lot of Wes Anderson, which makes for, as we know, a bold and graphically pleasing style. He throws in a bunch of splitscreen stuff which doesn’t much help and tends to kill a sense of period. Indeed, the one thing that might have helped him — he’s cast the thing brilliantly, down to the smallest butler — would be a greater awareness — or influence from, because he might have been aware — of 50s cinema. Merging the Anderson effects with a dash of Powell & Pressburger (THE RED SHOES for backstage drama), Wendy Toye (THREE CASES OF MURDER and THE STRANGER LEFT NO CARD for Peculiar Crimes), and any other pertinent films of the approximate period (GREEN FOR DANGER, AN INSPECTOR CALLS, SAPPHIRE?) would have given the film more of a unique personality — I know it’d have done it by imitation, but I don’t think one should imitate only the obvious contemporary things that everybody else is already imitating, and Wes Anderson is definitely that. Plus, he’s easy to do.\n\nI was idly thinking the other day that GOSFORD PARK is, as far as I know, the only film in which Stephen Fry works. And he shouldn’t, since his character is several notches more comedic than anyone else’s. But through some weird alchemy it hangs together perfectly. Well, SEE HOW THEY RUN might best be described as a film where everybody is at the level of sitcom silliness that Fry achieved. And this works, of course, because it’s consistent, but it’s less memorable because of that. The only character who shifts the balance into drama, momentarily, is the killer, and I can’t give him away. He’s very good, I hope we hear more of him, and I felt his character deserved more sympathetic treatment, even if he is clearly a homicidal maniac. Nobody’s perfect.\n\nSomeone called Harris Dickinson plays Richard Attenborough (right), seemingly without any reference to the real Dickie, or else he’s very bad at impersonation. But he’s a very good comedian — everything he does is funny. Pearl Chanda plays his sensible wife, Sheila Sim. Our disappointment at Adrien Brody’s early exit was assuaged by frequent flashbacks, and he’s very fine as always. Paul Chahidi is very funny as a butler named Fellowes (a GOSFORD jab), and the poet-comedian Tim Key turns out to be a good actor too. David Oyelowo camps it up and Shirley Henderson continues to be British cinema’s secret weapon, secret for too long.\n\nAnd yes, I consider it a Christmas movie as it is a cosy crime film, a period movie, British, and contains snow, both “real” and stage.\n\nSEE HOW THEY RUN stars Jo March; Chuck Barris; Salvador Dali; Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.; Papa Lazarou; Margaret Goff; J. Paul Getty III; Agent Salmakia; Shannon Dumania; Princess Olga; Sith Fleet Officer; Hammerhead Captain; General Charles Motomba; Side Kick Simon; and Moaning Myrtle.\n\nIt’s understandable, I guess, that I should have underrated A CANTERBURY TALE in favour of the Technicolor pics Powell & Pressburger made on either side of it. In fact, I’m not so sure it doesn’t deserve to be in the shade of the astonishing COLONEL BLIMP and AMOLAD. But the point is, if those films weren’t there, I’d have noticed how great ACT is a lot sooner. Each time I view it I find it more moving — and also find whole episodes I’d forgotten.\n\nThe film is oddly structured: there’s a kind of detective story to unmask “the Glue Man,” a mysterious individual pouring glue in the hair of girls who date American soldiers. A disparate trio — an American GI, a land girl, and a British officer — join forces to catch the miscreant. But the film is not really too concerned with its plot: the crimes, though unpleasant, are not life-or-death affairs, there’s only one suspect, and the characters get continually distracted by other affairs. Then, after the Glue Man is exposed, the movie continues on for some time, revealing a completely different set of priorities.\n\nThe most typical hero-type, Dennis Price, is the least interesting figure. John Sweet, the American, fascinates not because he’s been put there to appeal to the American audience, but because Sweet is so uncannily naturalistic, so un-movie-star-like. And Sheila Sim is wonderful. I wish she’d taken more time out from being Mrs. Richard Attenborough to star in more films. I don’t know this for sure, but it may be that her reason for not doing so was precisely the fact that she had worked for Powell. Not everyone had a very positive experience on his sets.\n\nBut here’s someone who seems to be having a fine time: the tiny child in this scene.\n\nI love it when kids don’t seem to realise the camera is rolling. It’s acceptable that he says “Thank you” when he’s given the drink, even though another character is talking — shows he’s been well bright-up. But then he speaks again, saying something like “Fuh-wuw foo-fuh,” cutting across Price’s dialogue.\n\nIt’s just possible that both lines were scripted. As Carol Reed said, child actors never forget their lines, but they do forget their cues, so it might be the right lines at the wrong time. But it feels like he’s just existing on camera rather than giving a performance, saying whatever comes into his little head exactly as if he were in a real room with real people. (Powell took the view that actors should never be shown the back of a set, so that it would seem more like a real place — this technique has clearly woven its magic spell on our young ad-libber.)\n\nPowell is known as something of a martinet, but he was capable of accepting performances that delighted and surprised him rather than those that simply fulfilled his expectations.\n\nThe same night (Saturday, at our online film club — join us?) we ran WITNESS IN THE DARK, we also looked at THE MAN UPSTAIRS, and it was an excellent night. TMU himself is the late Sir Dickie Lord Attenborough, gone berserk in a cheap flat, and beseiged by cops while his fellow lodgers try to decide amongst themselves whether to band together and help him.\n\nIt’s a knock-off of LE JOUR SE LEVE or THE LONG NIGHT, but instead of Marcel Carne or Anatole Litvak in charge it has Don Chaffey, distinctly of the B-list but he does all right here. He’s known for his Harryhausens, SEVENTH VOYAGE OF SINBAD JASON AND THE ARGONAUTS and ONE MILLIONS YEARS BC, two of my favourites, and he was headhunted by Disney which maybe kept him away from more thematically ambitious works, but here he’s on top form, apparently relishing the limitations of shooting in and around a single building. Some great angles skilfully used.\n\nTMU is evidently a much more lavish production than WITNESS IN THE DARK, even if it keeps things small. It has proper production design, giving it a sense both of solidity and social authenticity. Admittedly, the crowd gathered outside is rather tiny, and has to be swelled by the rather noticeable presence of Dickie’s chum Bryan Forbes (at least, I think it’s him. Could be Syd Chaplin). So nobody gets clobbered with a bicycle in the crush, it wouldn’t be credible. Asides from Attenborough, there’s Bernard Lee as the mulish copper who wants to barge in with tear gas, surely precipitating tragedy, and Donald Houston as the sympathetic shrink trying to de-escalate the situation. And there’s Virginia Maskell, Kenneth Griffith, Edward Judd (way down the cast as a secondary constable) and other persons of interest.\n\nThe conflict about how to tackle mental health crises when they impact public order is still timely — the police have very little training in this important part of their job (I think they get about a day) and they’re not always inclined to thoughtful or sensitive approaches (you don’t need ANY academic qualifications to join the fuzz in this country). If you were going to design a service purely to deal with mental health crises, it wouldn’t greatly resemble the police.\n\nThis all plays out neatly through interpersonal conflict between Lee and Houston. A British film in 1954 wasn’t about to diss the police for corruption or brutality, but suggesting they can be stupid or misguided was still pretty bold. And this kind of conflict is great to make Houston look good, in his duffel coat, and to get the audience agitated, which we were.\n\nThe film is less successful in piecing together Attenborough’s character’s backstory — we get very interested by the pills he’s on, by the fact that he’s a government research scientist involved with nuclear physics — but we don’t find out anything that could serve as a commentary on the bomb, militarism, or society. The neighbours organizing to help him seem motivated by the fact that he’s an educated, middle-class chap, not some yob. In the era of the angry young man, Attenborough is a perturbed middle-aged man.\n\nBut the tension is raised nicely — there’s almost no music, just the opening titles and some very faint rhythmic sounds during the final countdown to surrender or death. It’s all done with story, performance, lighting and framing (by Gerald Gibbs who shot WHISKY GALORE!), and editing (John Trumper, who cut GET CARTER). A slight overuse of the cucalorus, but those abstract, unmotivated shadows are lovely so I can’t begrudge them."
