        "text": "As tributes pour in for legendary actor Richard Attenborough, who died on Sunday aged 90, we look at his English actress wife Sheila Sim.\n\nThe 92-year-old lived with her husband in a care home especially for elderly or sick entertainers for two years.\n\nThe pair married in 1945 and had three children together, including theater director Michael Attenborough.\n\nSheila was hugely active as an actress in the 1940s and 50s, starring in A Canterbury Tale in 1944 and alongside her husband in The Guinea Pig in 1948.\n\nThey later appeared together in the original cast of Agatha Christie’s thriller The Mousetrap.\n\nSince then she has served the Actor's Charitable Trust for 60 years and has been a significant benefactor to the Royal Academy of Dramatc Art (RADA).\n\nRichard was RADA's president from 2003 until his death.\n\nOn Boxing Day 2004 the pair's elder daughter Jane Holland and her daughter Lucy were both tragically killed in the South Asian tsunami.\n\nRichard, one of British cinema's most cherished figures, passed away at lunchtime at the couple's care home, his son Michael revealed.\n\nThe national treasure was also jokingly known as the \"original luvvie\" in the arts world as he was so easily moved to tears.\n\nPM David Cameron led the tributes to the brother of naturalist Sir David Attenborough, tweeting last night: \"His acting in Brighton Rock was brilliant, his directing of Gandhi was stunning – Richard Attenborough was one of the greats of cinema.\"\n\nDickie attended Rada and began his acting career in 1942 with a role as a deserting sailor in In Which We Serve.\n\nHe went on to star in hits such as Brighton Rock, The Great Escape, Jurassic Park and Miracle on 34th Street.\n\nLord Attenborough, who had been in a wheelchair for six years since falling down stairs, was married to English actress Sheila Sim.\n\nDickie championed the British film business for more than 50 years.\n\nHe had a deep desire to educate, decrying injustice and extolling heroes such as Gandhi and Steve Biko, a South African victim of Apartheid.\n\nGandhi marked the highlight of his remarkable career, clinching eight Oscars, including best film and best director.\n\nHis eye for detail was at its most impressive in the movie, with Attenborough displaying a knack to control some 400,000 extras at the re-creation of Gandhi’s funeral.\n\nDickie was born Richard Samuel Attenborough in Cambridge on August 29, 1923.\n\nHis deep love of art and music began as a child where his teacher parents were cultured and benevolent Fabians.\n\nHe was brought up in Leicester where he was educated at Wyggeston, a local grammar school.\n\nHis father, principal of the local university college, instilled in his children the belief that not one minute of the day should be wasted.\n\nIt was a philosophy that Dickie carried into his professional life astonishing colleagues with his tireless 20-hours-a-day energy.\n\nA dedicated socialist, he was introduced to rebellious politics by his mother, who joined protest marches in the 1930s against Spain's General Franco and took in Basque refugees from the Spanish Civil War.\n\nHe became a staunch Labour supporter and a peer for the party.\n\nA Labour Party spokesman said: \"Lord Attenborough made an enormous contribution to our country and to the film industry.\n\n\"He believed passionately in social justice and the Labour Party and was a vocal campaigner against apartheid.\n\n\"He will be sadly missed.\"\n\nBaroness Royall of Blaisdon, Labour’s leader in the House of Lords, said she was \"proud\" Dickie was a Labour peer.\n\nHe was hugely popular but became disillusioned at the parts he was offered so he joined his friend Bryan Forbes to make films they \"believed would express certain aspirations and certain horrors\".\n\nForbes directed and Attenborough produced and starred in gritty, realistic films such as The Angry Silence about trade unionism and The L-Shaped Room set in bleak bedsitter London.\n\nThe role he found the most personally disturbing was that of murderer John Christie in 10 Rillington Place.\n\nDickie established himself as a director with pieces such as Oh! What a Lovely War, Young Winston on the early years of Churchill and A Bridge Too Far about the ill-fated attack on Arnhem.\n\nIt took 20 years for him to get the funding he needed to make the film he always wanted to make – on the life of Gandhi. During filming of the 1982 epic, he thought nothing of lugging camera equipment up hills to inspire his crew.\n\nHis epics were, however, not universally applauded.\n\nCry Freedom, about the relationship between murdered black activist Steve Biko and white journalist Donald Woods was attacked for failing to address fully the issues of Apartheid.\n\nChaplin also failed to win critical approval.\n\nDespite that, Dickie, who was made a CBE in 1967 and knighted in 1976, was respected enough as an actor for top directors Satyajit Ray and Steven Spielberg to lure him out of self-imposed retirement to appear respectively in The Chess Players and Jurassic Park.\n\nHe was also known for his friendship with Diana, Princess of Wales, after Prince Charles asked him to help her write speeches.\n\nA life-long supporter of Chelsea FC, he served as a director between 1969 and1982, and between 1993 and 2008 . He was honoured with the title of Life President at Stamford Bridge in 2008.\n\nThe club said in a statement: \"He was a thoroughly lovely and talented man who used his fame and influence for the good of the many causes close to his heart.\n\n\"We will always be grateful that our football club was one of them.\"\n\nTributes poured in on Twitter last night. Fellow actor Sir Roger Moore said: \"Greatly saddened to hear the great Richard Attenborough has left us.\n\n\"Such a wonderful and talented man.\"\n\nAnd American star Mia Farrow, who worked with him in 1964 on Guns at Batasi, wrote: \"Richard Attenborough was the kindest man I have ever had the privilege of working with.\n\n\"A Prince. RIP ‘Pa’ – and thank you.\""
