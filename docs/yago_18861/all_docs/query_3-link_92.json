        "text": "Acclaimed actor-director Richard Attenborough has died, the British Broadcasting Corporation reported Sunday, citing his son. Attenborough was 90.\n\nAttenborough is perhaps best-known for his work on the 1982 film “Gandhi,” which won eight Academy Awards, including best picture and best director.\n\nThe film took Attenborough some 20 years to make.\n\n“I was bankrupt several times. I had to mortgage my house. My family suffered to a certain extent,” he said. “I placed things at risk because I cared about it so much.”\n\nAttenborough began his career as a clasically-trained English actor and went on to star in such films as “The Great Escape,” “Jurassic Park” and a remake of “Miracle on 34th Street.” He was knighted in 1976.\n\nBritish Prime Minister David Cameron tweeted Sunday: “His acting in ‘Brighton Rock’ was brilliant, his directing of ‘Gandhi’ was stunning – Richard Attenborough was one of the greats of cinema.”\n\nThe cause of death was not immediately clear.\n\nAttenborough’s marriage to actress Sheila Sim spanned seven decades and produced three children.\n\n“My philosophy has always been that I believe that art is not an elitist gift for a few select people. Art is for everyone,” he once said."
