        "text": "SIR David Attenborough is a national treasure who is best known for covering the wonders of wildlife and the dangers of climate change.\n\nAway from the screen, David is also a father to two children - Susan and Robert Attenborough.\n\nWho is Susan Attenborough?\n\nSir David Attenborough is the father of two children whom he welcomed with his late wife Jane Elizabeth Ebsworth Oriel - a daughter named Susan, and a son named Robert.\n\nDespite growing up with a famous father, Susan and her sibling appear to shy away from the spotlight.\n\nAs a result of this, not much is publicly known about Sir David Attenborough's children - although it is widely reported that Susan is a former primary school headmistress.\n\nSusan’s exact age is unknown, however, back in 2017, along with her sibling, she was reported to be in her ‘50s’.\n\nIn 2017, Sir David was interviewed by fellow father Louis Theroux in the Radio Times, where he opened up about his regrets regarding missing some of his children's youth.\n\nHe said: \"If I do have regrets, it is that when my children were the same age as your children, I was away for three months at a time.\n\n\"If you have a child of six or eight and you miss three months of his or her life, it’s irreplaceable. You miss something.\"\n\nWho is Robert Attenborough?\n\nDavid’s son Robert has followed in his father’s footsteps - becoming a senior lecturer in biological anthropology.\n\nThroughout his career, Robert has worked for the School of Archaeology and Anthropology at the Australian National University in Canberra.\n\nAs of 2024, it is thought that Robert, like his sibling, is also in his fifties or sixties, although his exact age is not known.\n\nIn a separate interview with The Times, Sir David previously shared a story from his son Robert's eighth birthday.\n\nHe gave Robert a salamander - a lizard-like animal - as a present, just like Sir David's father had once done when he was a child.\n\nSpeaking to the publication, he said: \"We unpacked this - it came in a box - I took it out and showed him.\n\n\"I said, 'Now there you are.' This thing just sat on his hand. I said, 'Put him in his new home.'\n\n\"He put him in his new home, and it very slowly walked down to the water, and there out from beneath its tail came a little one.\n\n\"My son looked at that with his eyes coming out of his head - as did I.\"\n\nWho was David Attenborough's wife Jane Elizabeth Ebsworth Oriel?\n\nDavid and his wife Jane Oriel married in 1950 and enjoyed over 40 years together before she tragically passed away in 1997.\n\nJane, who was originally from Merthyr Tydfil in Wales, passed away after suffering from a brain haemorrhage at the age of 70.\n\nThe beloved star has made very few comments about his wife following her death.\n\nAfter the death of Jane, their daughter moved in with David.\n\nIn his memoir Life on Air, David has previously written about Jane's final moments, explaining that he flew back from filming in New Zealand to hold Jane's hand when she was in a coma.\n\nWriting in his 2002 memoir, he said: ‘’The focus of my life, the anchor had gone… now I was lost.’’\n\nIn an interview with the Express in 2009, David explained that work had helped him cope with the tragic loss.\n\nHe said: ‘’I coped by working. It was the most fantastic luck that I was able to work.\n\n‘’If my life had gone a different way - say I had gone into the oil business, which I once considered doing - I would have been out at 60.’’"
