        "text": "Richard Attenborough, Baron Attenborough of Richmond-upon-Thames, was born in Cambridge, England, the son of Mary (née Clegg), a founding member of the Marriage Guidance Council, and Frederick Levi Attenborough, a scholar and academic administrator who was a don at Emmanuel College and wrote a standard text on Anglo-Saxon law. The family later moved to Leicester where his father was appointed Principal of the university while Richard was educated at Wyggeston Grammar School for Boys in Leicester and at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA).\n\nHis film career began with a role as a deserting sailor in In Which We Serve (1942), a part that contributed to his being typecast for many years as a coward in films like London Belongs to Me (1948), Die Nacht begann am Morgen (1950) and his breakthrough role as a psychopathic young gangster in the film adaptation of Graham Greene's novel, Brighton Rock (1948). During World War II, Attenborough served in the Royal Air Force.\n\nHe worked prolifically in British films for the next 30 years, and in the 1950s appeared in several successful comedies for John Boulting and Roy Boulting, including Der beste Mann beim Militär (1956) and Junger Mann aus gutem Hause (1959). Early in his stage career, Attenborough starred in the London West End production of Agatha Christie's \"The Mousetrap\", which went on to become one of the world's longest-running stage productions. Both he and his wife were among the original cast members of the production, which opened in 1952 and (as of 2007) is still running.\n\nIn the 1960s, he expanded his range of character roles in films such as An einem trüben Nachmittag (1964) and Schüsse in Batasi (1964), for which he won the BAFTA Award for Best Actor for his portrayal of the regimental Sergeant Major. He appeared in the ensemble cast of Gesprengte Ketten (1963), as Squadron Leader \"Roger Bartlett\" (\"Big X\"), the head of the escape committee.\n\nIn 1967 and 1968, he won back-to-back Golden Globe Awards in the category of Best Supporting Actor, the first time for Kanonenboot am Yangtse-Kiang (1966), starring Steve McQueen, and the second time for Doctor Dolittle (1967), starring Rex Harrison. He would win another Golden Globe for Best Director, for Gandhi (1982), in 1983. Six years prior to \"Gandhi\", he played the ruthless \"Gen. Outram\" in Indian director Satyajit Ray's period piece, Die Schachspieler (1977). He has never been nominated for an Academy Award in an acting category.\n\nHe took no acting roles following his appearance in Otto Preminger's Der menschliche Faktor (1979), until his appearance as the eccentric developer \"John Hammond\" in Steven Spielberg's Jurassic Park (1993).
