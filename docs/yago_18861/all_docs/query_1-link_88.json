A Prince,\" the star of \"Rosemary's Baby\" said.\n\n\"Greatly saddened to hear the great Richard Attenborough has left us. Such a wonderful and talented man,\" wrote British actor Roger Moore.\n\n- Enormous contribution -\n\nA member of the British House of Lords with the Labour party, Attenborough was celebrated on Twitter by many politicians who had known him.\n\n\"Very sad to learn of death of Richard Attenborough, a fine man in every way. Proud that he was a Labour peer,\" wrote Labour leader in the house Janet Royall.\n\n\"Really sad news death Richard Attenborough brilliant actor film director,\" wrote former cabinet minister Peter Hain. \"Stalwart lovely man & friend\".\n\nBritain's Labour party paid tribute to Attenborough, saying he \"made an enormous contribution to our country and to the film industry both as an actor and a director\".\n\nKnown for his 1987 drama \"Cry Freedom\", set in South Africa under apartheid, Attenborough \"believed passionately in social justice\", a party spokesman said.\n\nFootball club Chelsea, of which Attenborough was a lifelong supporter, also paid tribute to the director.\n\n\"His personality was woven into the tapestry of the club over seven decades. He was a consistent force for good at the club, even in dark times,\" the club said in a statement.\n\n\"Lord A was a thoroughly lovely and talented man who used his fame and influence for the good of the many causes close to his heart. We will always be grateful that our football club was one of them.\"\n\nThe brother of famous wildlife presenter David, Attenborough had three children with his wife Sheila, who he had married aged 21.\n\nIn 2004 his daughter Jane Holland and her daughter Lucy were killed in the Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami.\n\nHis surviving children are Michael, a theatre director, and Charlotte, an actor.\n\nIncreasingly frail after falling down the stairs at home, Attenborough moved into a west London care home with his wife towards the end of his life."
