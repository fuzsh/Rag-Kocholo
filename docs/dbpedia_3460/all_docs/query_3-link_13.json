        "text": "Providing metro and tram services in the city of The Hague, Randstad Rail is an important transport system that extends its reach to neighbouring cities, including Rotterdam. Launched on 29 October 2006, it has four distinct lines and facilitates connections to a variety of buses, trams and other metro lines operated by various transport companies. Randstad Rail also provides connections to Rotterdam The Hague Airport and Amsterdam Schiphol Airport. Operating hours are from approximately 7:30 am to 1:00 am. Fares start at €2.50 and passengers can purchase a metro card. Access to a metro station is possible via train journeys from other European countries, with certain stations allowing the consumption of food and drink or smoking. An interesting feature is a net-shaped tunnel connecting the Grote Markt and Beatrixkwartier. There are also plans to introduce new stations by 2018, and Blijdorp station offers easy access to several tourist attractions.\n\nCommonly known as RandstadRail, the exact number of daily passengers on the system is unknown. Details of fares are also not available. The service does not run 24 hours a day and the trains do not have air conditioning. Passengers are not allowed to walk between platforms and the trains are not driverless.\n\nThere are no screen doors on the platforms. The service operates from 5:00am to 1:00am Monday to Sunday. The estimated fare is $1.\n\nMetro Map of The Hague\n\nMap of Hague Metro showing different lines. Click on the map to enlarge it.\n\nThe Hague: The Dutch Capital Hosting The Randstad Rail\n\nLocated in the Netherlands, The Hague is the capital of South Holland and the royal residence of King Willem-Alexander. In addition to being the seat of parliament, the city is famous for being home to many international courts. With a population of around 500,000, The Hague is the third most populous city in the Netherlands. Rotterdam The Hague Airport serves the city, while Amsterdam Schiphol Airport, located in Amsterdam, caters to the majority of international travellers visiting The Hague.\n\nPublic transport in The Hague includes trams, buses, metro, intercity trains and ferries, with the metro and many trams operating under the umbrella of Randstad Rail.

The company responsible for operating Randstad Rail is HTM Personenvervoer NV.\n\nHistory of Randstad Rail\n\nProposed around 1983 to alleviate the traffic problems caused by the significant growth in population and employment in the Randstad and The Hague, the metro became a solution to a pressing problem.

HTM, NS Regional Transport, RET and the ZWN Group joined forces to form the Randstad Rail Foundation to realise the construction of the metro.\n\nThe metro service in The Hague was officially inaugurated with the unveiling of Randstad Rail 4 on 29 October 2006.
