        "text": "Zoetermeer is a city located in the province of South Holland in the Netherlands. The first record of the city's existence dates back to the 11th century, when veen, a fuel for stoves, was harvested from the land.\n\nIn 1966, Zoetermeer was pointed out as an expansion area for the nearby The Hague. In 1962 the village had around 10,000 inhabitants. March 2008 brought the 120,000th inhabitant. Nowadays, the city is no longer a satellite city of The Hague but a city of its own.\n\nGet around\n\n[edit]\n\nZoetermeer has an excellent transportation system. The \"randstadrail\" runs throughout the whole city. Parts that are not covered by it are easily reachable by bus. There are 2 bus operators in the area. Arriva operates some of the bus routes heading north, while EBS operates the remaining routes.\n\nWhen coming from The Hague or Utrecht you probably end up at Zoetermeer train station (note that it is not advised to stop at Zoetermeer-Oost, since there are no good connections from there). Walk across the footbridge to another platform. There, you will find the Randstadrail, which brings you to \"Zoetermeer Centrum West\". All buses depart here. Here you will also find the police station, shops and town hall.\n\nYou can buy a ticket on the bus from the driver: note that this is quite expensive, between 2 and 4 euro for a one-way ticket! Like the rest of the Netherlands, all busses, trams and trains otherwise require the OV-chipkaart. These can be bought at most trainstations, kiosks and some supermarkets. The cost of a blank card is 10 euro, and after that you will have to top it up in special machines.\n\nThe \"randstadrail\" has ticket machines, BUT they will only take coins. If you don't have any, or the machine is broken, walk up to the conductors as soon as they come in. If you are a foreigner, they will either let it be, or require you to buy a (more expensive) ticket with them. Probably the first option though."
