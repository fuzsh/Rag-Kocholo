History

The station opened, as a railway station, on 22 May 1977 as part of the Zoetermeerlijn, operating Zoetermeer Stadslijn services. The train station closed on 3 June 2006 and reopened as a RandstadRail station on 29 October 2006 for the HTM tram services (4), and on 20 October 2007 for tram service 3.

The station features 4 platforms on two levels, and are at right angles to each other. The bottom two are the tracks from Den Haag, that have not yet entered the Zoetermeer circuit. These platforms are low, and the same level as the tram doors.

It is only one of two stations in the world where the same metro line passes through it twice in a pretzel configuration (the other being Monument Metro Station on the Tyne and Wear Metro in Newcastle-Upon-Tyne, England. A similar situation also existed for 14 years on the Vancouver SkyTrain at Commercial–Broadway station and briefly on the Toronto subway at Bloor–Yonge (TTC) for six months in 1966.)

Passengers can change at this station for Meerzicht, Driemanspolder, Delftsewallen and Dorp, to get there quicker.
