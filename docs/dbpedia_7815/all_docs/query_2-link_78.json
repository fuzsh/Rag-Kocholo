        "text": "The title Prince of Brazil (Portuguese: Príncipe do Brasil) was used in the Kingdom of Portugal, and normally conferred on the heir of the royal House of Braganza.The title was created by King John IV of Portugal on 27 October 1645 in favor of his eldest son and heir Prince Teodósio, soon after Portugal had got rid of its Spanish rulers. During the period of 16451822, the title Prince of Brazil was always conferred to the heir apparent of the throne, who also received the title of Duke of Braganza. Also, in 1750 when the hitherto Prince of Brazil ascended as Joseph I, he granted the title Princess of Brazil (but not the Duchy of Braganza) to his eldest daughter, the future Maria I of Portugal, as the king believed to remain without sons. When Maria in 1760 married Infante Pedro, he also became styled Prince of Brazil as her consort.\n\nThe male heir apparent received the title when the relevant parent ascended the throne, or, if the title was vacant, at birth. The heir of the Prince of Brazil was styled Prince of Beira.\n\nWhen Brazil proclaimed its independence in 1822, the title was taken by the Imperial House of Brazil, and later was conferred to all the sons of Emperor Pedro I.\n\nThe golden armillary sphere\n\nEmblem of the Portuguese Empire\n\nNo flag or specific symbol is known for Brasil or Portuguese America from the time of the colony until 1816. The flag usually associated with the Principality of Brasil in fact is the flag of the Portuguese empire. It shows the symbol of the Portuguese empire, a yellow armillary-sphere on a white field. On Dutch flag-charts of the end of the 17th / beginning of the 18th C. this flag is called Portugeese Witte Vlag (Portuguese white flag or ensign), meaning that it was displayed on all Portuguese ships, and thus there is no trace of Brazil there. On another white flag there is depicted a misinterpretation of the cross of the Order of Christ, charged with an armillary-sphere. This flag is also called Portugeese Witte Vlag, but, as the symbol literally means: The Government of the Portuguese Empire, this may be the government-flag of Portugal. Again no trace of Brazil there.\n\nThe most interesting feature in the history of Brazil is the fact that, in the nineteenth century it was one of only four countries in the New World that housed an effective legal monarchical state (the others were Mexico, Canada and Haiti), for a period of almost 90 years. Rio de Janeiro was for a period of 13 years the metropolis of a European state and from 1808 to 1821 the capital of the Portuguese Empire, which extended over parts of Europe, Asia and Africa. In 1808, the Portuguese court of Queen Mary ( 1816), fleeing from Napoleon's troops, which had invaded the territory of Portugal, had moved aboard a large fleet, escorted by British men-of-war, with all the government apparatus to its then-colony, Brazil, and had established themselves in the city of Rio de Janeiro.\n\nIn 1815 the the United kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and Algarves was proclaimed. King John VI ruled his huge empire from Rio de Janeiro, and there he would have remained for the rest of his life if it were not for the turmoil aroused in Portugal due, among other reasons, to his long stay in Brazil after the end of Napoleon's reign. When he left Brazil to return to his European territory in 1821, his elder son, Pedro, stayed in his stead as regent of Brazil. One year later, Pedro wrote a paper (not so well known as his alleged proclamation  \"Independence or Death\") to state the reasons for the secession of Brazil from Portugal and bequeathed a constitution proclaiming an independent monarchy in Brazil, assuming its head as Emperor Pedro I of Brazil, also known as \"Dom Pedro\". Dom Pedro was liked by the common people, but displeased both the landed elites, who thought him too liberal, and the intellectuals, who felt he was not liberal enough. After his abdication in 1831 for political incompatibilities with Brazilian politicians he left for Portugal, leaving behind his five-year-old son as Emperor Pedro II. In 1835, the Male Revolt, perhaps the most significant slave rebellion in Brazil, took place in the city of Salvador da Bahia. After a period of nine years of regencies, Pedro II was acclaimed emperor in 1840 at the age of 14. Pedro II started a more-or-less parliamentary reign which lasted until 1889, when he was ousted by a coup d'état which instituted the republic. At the end of his reign, he presided over the abolition of slavery in 1888.\n\nIn its entirety the decree reads:\n\nD. João por graça de Deos, Rei do Reino Unido de Portugal e do Brazil e Algarves, daquem e dalém mar, em Africa, Senhor da Guiné e da Conquista, Navegação e Commercio da Ethiopia, Arabia, Persia e da India, etc.\n\nFaço saber aos que a presenta carta de lei virem que tendo sido servido unir os meus Reinos de Portugal, Brazil e Algarves, para que juntos constituissem, como effectivamente constituem hum só e mesmo Reino; he regular e consequente o incorporar em hum só escudo real as armas de todos os tres Reinos, assim, e da mesma fórma que o Senhor Rei D. Affonso III, de gloriosa memoria, unindo outrora o Reino dos Algarves ao de Portugal unio tembem as suas armas respectivas: e occorrendo que para este effeito o meu Reino do Brazil ainda não tem armas que caracterisem a bem merecida preeminencia a que me aprouve exalta-lo: hei por bem e me praz ordenar o seguinte:\n\n1° - Que Reino do Brazil tenha por armas huma esphera armilar de ouro em campo azul.\n\n2° - Que o escudo real portuguez, inscripto na dita esphera armilar de ouro em campo azul, com uma corôa sobreposta, fique sendo, de hoje em diante, as armas do Reino Unido de Portugal, e do Brazil e Algarves, e das mais partes integrantes da minha Monarchia.\n\n3° - Que estas novas armas sejão por conseguinte as que uniformemente se hajão de empregar em todos os estandartes, bandeiras, sellos reaes e cunhos de moedas, assim como em tudo mais em que até agora se tenha feito uso das armas precedentes.\n\nE esta se cumprirá como nella se contém. Pelo que mando, etc.\n\nDada no Palacio do Rio de Janeiro, aos 13 de Maio de 1816.\n\nEl-Rei com guarda\n\n(a) Marquez de Aquiar\n\ncom os registos competentes[2]\n\nThe achievement and flag of the Kingdom were adopted by decree of King Pedro I of 18 September 1822. It consisted of the the cross of the Order of Christ charged with emblem of the Kingdom of 1816 as on coins (the B omitted), surrounded by a ring with stars, the number of which corresponds with the number of provinces of the Kingdom.\n\nThe decree reads:\n\nHavendo o Reino do Brazil de que sou Regente e Defensor Perpetuo, declarado a sua emancipação politica, entranmdo o occupar na grande familia das nações o lugar que justamente lhe compete, como nação grande, livre e independente; sendo por isso indispensavel que elle tenha hum escudo real darmas, que, não só se distingão das de Portugal e Algarves até agora reunidas, mas que sejão caracteristocas deste rico e vasto Continente; e desenjando eu que se conservem as armas que a este Reino forão dadas pelo Senhor Rei D. João VI, meu Augusto Pai, na carta de lei de 13 de maio de 1816; e ao mesmo tempo remomorar o primeiro nome que lhe fôra imposto no seu feliz descobrimento, e honrar as 19 provincias comprehendidas entre os grandes rios que são os seus limites naturaes e que formão a sua integridade que eu jurei sustenar; hei por bem e com o paracer do meu Conselho de Estado determinar o seguinte:\n\n- Será dora em deante, o escudo darmas deste Reino do Brazil em campo verde huma esphera armilar de ouro, atravessada por huma cruz de Ordem de Christo, sendo circulada a mesma esphera de 19 estrellas de prata em huma orla azul; e firmada a corõa real diamantina sobre o escudo, cujos lados serão abraçados por dois ramos de plkantas de café e tabaco como emblemas de sua riqueza commercial, representados na sia propria côr; e ligados na parte inferior pelo laço da nação. A bandeira nacional será composta de hum parallelogrammo verde e nelle inscripto hum quadrilatero rhomboidal côr de ouro, ficando ao centro deste o escudo das armas do Brazil .\n\nPaço, em 18 de setembro de 1822\n\nCom rubrica de Sua Alteza Real, o Principe Regente\n\n(a) José Bonifacio de Andrada e Silva.[3]\n\nSilver 2000 reís coin, 1855.\n\nShowing the royal arms of 1822, with an annulet with 19 stars and crowned with a royal crown.\n\nAccordingly the arms are:\n\nArms: Vert, an armillary-sphere Or, pierced with a cross formy Gules, voided Argent, and surrounded by an annulet Azure charged with 19 five-pointed stars Argent.\n\nCrown: A royal crown.\n\nGarland: Dexter a branch of coffee and sinister a tobaccoplant, proper, tied with a ribbon and bow Vert and Or.\n\nBy Decree, 18.IX.1822\n\nIn some drawings of the achievement the artistic freedom is taken to make the annulet: Azure, fimbriated Argent, which is, of course, incorrect.\n\nThe number of stars on the annulet changes, but in the time of the emperors there has never been a decree by which the number of stars was adapted to the number of provinces. Also, the use of six-pointed stars instead of five-pointed is to be considered as an artistic freedom.\n\nIn heraldic drawings the Imperial Crown sometimes has a green cap, sometimes a purple one because its color was not laid down by decree. Younger drawings however, always depict it purpure.\n\nLarger Imperial Achievement (before 1841)\n\nCrowned imperial mantle and Order of the Southern Cross pending\n\nClichés of the time of Pedro II, used for example on the Proclamation of the Abolition of Slavery in Brasil (1888), show the achievement placed on a red crowned imperial mantle, lined ermine, and the cross of the Ordem Imperial do Cruzeiro, hanging down from the bow.\n\nNo known decree however sanctionizes the use of these embellished achievements. This may explain the great variety of the versions.\n\nFor a modern rendering see:Wikipedia\n\nThe motto of the House of Bragança was in hoc signo vinces (Under This sign You Will Triumph), and is the motto Constantin the Great saw in the sky before the Battle of the Milvian Bridge in 307. In Brazilean context it refers to the cross of the Order of Christ.\n\nThe motto however was never incorporated in any achievement of the House."
