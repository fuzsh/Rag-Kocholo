IPA /ɐ'fõsu/; English Alphonzo), or Affonso (Archaic Portuguese), Alfonso or Alphonso (Portuguese-Galician) or Alphonsus (Latin version), nicknamed \"the Fat\" (Portueguese o Gordo), third king of Portugal, was born in Coimbra on April 23, 1185 and died on March 25, 1223 in the same city. He was the second but eldest surviving son of Sancho I of Portugal by his wife, Dulce Berenguer of Barcelona, Infanta of Aragon. Afonso succeeded his father in 1212. Afonso's father gave a generous patrimony to the Church, so much in fact the monarchy inherited by Afonso II was almost impoverished. Afonso established a commission to look into the issue of land title and required feudal lords to apply for letters of confirmation. In the process the commission discovered many abuses – borders had been illegally extended and the correct taxes were not being paid, at considerable cost to the crown. It is interesting to note, the commission did not seek evidence from the aristocrats but from local people. Afonso II may well have set out primarily to restore his own fortunes but in the process he also challenged the wealth, and possibly the priorities, of the Church.\n\nPortuguese Royalty\n\nHouse of Burgundy Afonso Henriques (Afonso I)\n\nChildren include\n\nInfanta Mafalda\n\nInfanta Urraca, Queen of Léon\n\nInfante Sancho (future Sancho I)\n\nInfanta Teresa, Countess of Flanders and Duchess of Burgundy\n\nSancho I\n\nChildren include\n\nInfanta Teresa, Queen of Castile\n\nInfanta Sancha, Lady of Alenquer\n\nInfanta Constança\n\nInfante Afonso (future Afonso II)\n\nInfante Pedro, Count of Urgell\n\nInfante Fernando, Count of Flanders\n\nInfanta Branca, Lady of Guadalajara\n\nInfanta Berengária, Queen of Denmark\n\nInfanta Mafalda, Queen of Castile\n\nAfonso II\n\nChildren include\n\nInfante Sancho (future Sancho II)\n\nInfante Afonso, Count of Boulogne (future Afonso III)\n\nInfanta Leonor, Queen of Denmark\n\nInfante Fernando, Lord of Serpa\n\nSancho II Afonso III\n\nChildren include\n\nInfanta Branca, Viscountess of Huelgas\n\nInfante Dinis (future Denis I)\n\nInfante Afonso, Lord of Portalegre\n\nInfanta Maria\n\nInfanta Sancha\n\nDenis\n\nChildren include\n\nInfanta Constança, Queen of Castile\n\nInfante Afonso (future Afonso IV)\n\nAfonso IV\n\nChildren include\n\nInfanta Maria, Queen of Castile\n\nInfante Pedro (future Peter I)\n\nInfanta Leonor, Queen of Aragon\n\nPeter I\n\nChildren include\n\nInfanta Maria, Marchioness of Tortosa\n\nInfante Fernando (future Ferdinand I)\n\nInfanta Beatriz, Countess of Alburquerque\n\nInfante João, Duke of Valencia de Campos\n\nInfante Dinis, Lord of Cifuentes\n\nJohn, Grand Master of the Order of Aviz (future John I) (natural son)\n\nFerdinand I\n\nChildren include\n\nInfanta Beatrice, Queen of Castile and Leon (future Beatrice I of Portugal)\n\nBeatrice (disputed queen)\n\nChildren include\n\nInfante Miguel of Castile and Portugal\n\nKingship\n\nAs a king, Afonso II set a different approach of government. His father, Sancho I, and his grandfather Afonso I, were mostly concerned with military issues either against the neighboring Kingdom of Castile or against the Moorish lands in the south. Afonso did not pursue territory enlargement policies and managed to insure peace with Castile during his reign. Despite this, some towns, like Alcácer do Sal in 1217, were conquered from the Moors by the private initiative of noblemen. No inference is meant to convey that he was a weak or somehow cowardly man. The first years of his reign were marked by internal disturbances between Afonso and his brothers and sisters. As king he managed to keep security within Portuguese borders only by outlawing and exiling his kin.\n\nBecause military issues were not a government priority, Afonso established the state's administration and centralized power on himself. He designed the first set of Portuguese written laws. These were mainly concerned with private property, civil justice, and minting. Afonso also sent ambassadors to European kingdoms outside the Iberian Peninsula and began amiable commercial relations with most of them.\n\nOther reforms instituted by Alfonso I included the always delicate matters with the pope. In order to get the independence of Portugal recognized by Rome, his grandfather, Afonso I legislated enormous privileges to the Church. These boons eventually created a state within the state. With Portugal's position as a country firmly established, Afonso II endeavored to weaken the power of the clergy and to apply a portion of the enormous revenues of the Roman Catholic church to purposes of national utility. These actions led to a serious diplomatic conflict between Rome and Portugal. After being excommunicated for his perceived audacities by Pope Honorius III, Afonso II promised to make amends to the church, but he died in 1223 before making any serious attempts to do so.\n\nLegacy\n\nAfonso II was the third king of Portugal, ruling from 1211 to 1231. In addition to pursuing the reconquest of the South from the Moors, he is best remembered for challenging the Church over land rights. Afonso II may well have set out primarily to restore his own fortunes but in the process he also challenged the wealth, and possibly the priorities, of the Roman Catholic Church. Alfonso II was not alone, there were others who criticized the wealth and privileges of the church and they, like Afonso, were excommunicated for their views. Alfonso viewed temporal power, wealth, and the secularization of the medieval church as contrary to God's will. As much as Afonso II may have created an opportunity for the Roman Catholic Church in Portugal to rethink its priorities, he died before the restitution Rome commanded was paid.\n\nAncestors\n\nAfonso's ancestors in three generations Afonso II of Portugal Father:\n\nSancho I of Portugal Father's father:\n\nAfonso I of Portugal Father's father's father:\n\nHenry of Burgundy, Count of Portugal Father's father's mother:\n\nTeresa of León, Countess of Portugal Father's mother:\n\nMaud of Savoy Father's mother's father:\n\nAmadeus III of Savoy Father's mother's mother:\n\nMahaut of Albon Mother:\n\nDulce Berenguer of Barcelona Mother's father:\n\nRamon Berenguer IV, Count of Barcelona Mother's father's father:\n\nRamon Berenguer III, Count of Barcelona Mother's father's mother:\n\nDouce of Gévaudaun Mother's mother:\n\nPetronila of Aragon Mother's mother's father:\n\nRamiro II of Aragon Mother's mother's mother:\n\nAgnes of Aquitaine\n\nMarriage and descendants\n\nAfonso married Infanta Urraca of Castile, daughter of Alfonso VIII, King of Castile, and Leonora of Aquitaine, in 1208.\n\nName Birth Death Notes By Urraca of Castile (1186-1220; married in 1208) Infante Sancho September 8, 1207 January 4, 1248 Succeeded him as Sancho II, 4th King of Portugal.
