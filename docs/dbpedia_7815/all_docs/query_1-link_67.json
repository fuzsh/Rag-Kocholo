        "text": "Doing the same as DPK:\n\nA failed French Revolution timeline. The king crushes the rebels grand revolution, although they dissent for much longer, causing much greater overall damage. Britain, Spain, and a few other kingdoms support various rebel groups which wreak havoc, and this combined with two lost continental wars with Spain and Britain eventually tears apart the kingdom.\n\nThis is now in 1912. The Great Continental War has ravaged Europe, and it looks very different coming out.\n\nDarker Spanish colors are Spanish puppets, while the very dark color in Aragon is military rule.\n\n1. The Kingdom of France. Really crappy, led behind the scenes by an analogue of the Mafia, the Fraternite. People largely unaware, blame the government.\n\n2. Republic of Paris. A new country to come out of the war. A fledgling republic in the style of the Netherlands.\n\n3. An independence revolt quickly put down by the mighty Spanish army. Quickly died down in the face of the military, but has been under military control and a huge draft all throughout the GCW. Pretty calm by now.\n\n4. The Kingdom of Spain. A parliamentary kingdom similar to OTL Britain. Very powerful, though it may be close to collapse. Is an overextended paper tiger after the war. Currency is almost worthless, though the effects of that remain to take place.\n\n5. Republic of Portugal. A full democratic-republic sponsored and propped up by the Spanish government (has been this way since 1823.) Kingdom of Portugal is in Africa now after the war, as Brazil has been reformed into a republic.\n\n6. British Algeria. It was there. Spain wasn't. They took it.\n\n7. The Republic of Italy has done fairly well for itself. Croatia is a new gain from the War. The thin slice of southern France is, too, but they're looking to sell it off to the Kingdom of France.\n\n8. Bavaria formed out of all of those small German states. The Switzerland of TTL.\n\n9. The German Union is pretty much just Prussia under a different name. Best buds with Britain.\n\n10. Czechland is new to the party. Formed after the war, basically just exists as a compromise between The GU and URAH.\n\n11. Aforementioned URAH. Got rid of the emperor through revolution mid-war, lost Croatia to Italy, and is all around pretty beat up. Their luck has been very poor in battle, too, and the Russians are looking to pummel them into the dirt for good. Poor, URAH, so close to the Russians, so far from God.\n\n12. South Hungary is the new home for the Austrian-Hungarian emperor. Yes, he still calls himself that. No, nobody else does.\n\n13. The United Communitarian Balkan Republics (UCBR.) The junior communitarians (TTL communists) under the Russians. Joined by luck, chance, and Russian/Ottoman intervention.\n\n14. This is a mess.\n\n15. The Ottoman Empire has federalized and is looking more and more communitarian by the hour. Best buds with Russia.\n\n16. The United Tsarist Kingdoms of Crimea and Georgia (UTKCG.) The small, underdeveloped, doomed remains of Tsarist Russia.\n\n17. Communitarian Russia, or just Russia. The strongest kid on the block, gained huge tracts of land from the war. Things are looking up for them.\n\n18. Scandinavia. A temporary union to be broken as soon as the threat of the British-Russian alliance is broken.\n\n19. Britain is really much more interested in their overseas colonies. I mean sure, they like Brittany, and Ireland's very existence annoys them, but they've done their job in the war and just want to rest. Russia is begging for them to help reclaim Finland into the Motherland, but they really won't.\n\n20. Ireland is Ireland. Got their independence via Spanish and Scandinavian threats, but still rely on Britain for pretty much everything.\n\nCanada has fallen. Well, most of it. A sickly remnant of the Canadian government has avoided USSA assaults by just not being worth it (as far as anyone knows). A Franco-English army was effectively trapped in the Montreal pocket as American forces captured Trois-Rivieres, and Entente morale took a massive blow.\n\nInspired by this massive defeat Communists and Islamists in India have risen up (Hindu nationalists are musing an uprising of their own). The English have been forced into a panic, while Russian forces launched a dearing bombing raid on London proper.\n\nThrough careful diplomacy (and fears of communists) Brazil has crafted the Coalition for Latin American Democracy. This fledgeling alliance as teamed up with other anti-Entente forces and is attempting to kick the Fascists out of South America. They were a little over ambitious though, and while they're winning it's been a rather clumsy affair.\n\nMeanwhile Russian and Chinese forces have met up in the liberation of Beijing, a victoria that led to the IJA being effectively dismantled and put under IJN control, with the new concept of winning anywhere that's an island (or lacks rail connections). The landings in Kamchatka have just lead to Russians deciding they want unconditional surrender from Japan. It'll be a hard to manage goal with Russia's lack of Pacific naval forces, but they're going to try.\n\nSpeaking of Entente naval supremacy, the Russian Black Sea Fleet, combined with Ottoman and Ukrainian forces, finally outnumbers the Entente, and their submarine fleet has begun raids in the Western Med, hurting Entente supplies to North Africa and helping bring Egypt into the war.\n\nThe Russian submarines from the Baltic and Arctic are also starting to threaten the UK as Russo-Finnish forces acquire new ports in Norway. They can't win a surface battle yet, but communications with the US and raids on Entente merchant fleets are becoming more and more reliable. The USSA hasn't been twidling their thumbs either. While cheeply made their new mass production of naval vessels is building a navy which will rival the Entente (it'll take time though).\n\n6 years in the war has grown to be the bloodiest in human history and seems set to last a few years still.\n\nThough maybe some important cargo crossing the Arctic Ocean can speed it's end. The Canadian Government remnant lost all loyalty to the Entente when the Prime Minister was arrested (deemed a 'communist sympathiser' for having not cracked down hard enough). The remnants are no communists though, and their last hold outs in the NWT contained a mine with some very interesting products and the Entente's brightest researchers on the subject of this interesting metal. Sure most of the English and French researchers are being held at gun point, but there's enough Canadians and Scots (who've heard rumours London is cracking down rather nastily on Scottish peace protests) to show the Russians this neat little idea. Oh, and a couple German prisoners hoping to be reunited with countrymen who fled to Russia years earlier. The low price to be given this research? Amnesty for the Canadian Government in Exile. It's better than the Americans or Entente would give.\n\nSo how democratic is Coalition for Latin American Democracy?\n\nAlso looks like the Mid East (plus India) will be a mess, full of communists and Islamists, will Russia/USSA get sucked in before the war ends?\n\nI also thought you were going to have the Entente get a nuke lol (but only one)\n\nVery interesting.\n\nSurely Thormond would be a more logical name than Clare then? Seeing as I doubt Bruce would be too interested in honouring a Norman Marcher Lord.\n\nFunny thing about these guys:\n\nWikipedia said:\n\nThe term Scoto-Norman (also Scoto-Normans, Scotto-Norman, Franco-Scottish or Franco-Gaelic) is used to describe people, families, institutions and archaeological artifacts that are partly Scottish (in some sense) and partly Norman or Anglo-Norman (in some sense). It is used to refer to people or things of Norman, Anglo-Norman, French or even Flemish or Breton origin, but who are associated with Scotland in the Middle Ages. It is also used for any of these things where they exhibit syncretism between French or Anglo-French culture on the one hand, and Gaelic culture on the other.\n\nFor instance, the Kings of Scotland between the reign of the David I and the Stewart period are often described as Scoto-Norman. A classic case of Gaelic and French cultural syncretism would be Lochlann, Lord of Galloway, who used both a Gaelic (Lochlann) and French name (Roland), and kept followers of both languages. Another example of a Scoto-Norman, would be Robert the Bruce, who had a dual Norman-Gaelic heritage.\n\nThe term is used by historians as an alternative to Anglo-Norman when that term pertains to Scotland."
