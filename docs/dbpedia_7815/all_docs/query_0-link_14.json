Reviewing those papers, it occurred to me that a sister book to Sintra would be a good idea, so I gathered more material. I wrote much of the book in faraway Cape Town, where Portuguese connections are not entirely absent. The chapter on the Lisbon earthquake of 1755 ﬁrst appeared in a different form in a collection of essays especially commissioned to mark the 250th anniversary of the event.2 I must thank Liz Friend-Smith of I.B. Tauris, my publisher, for so enthusiastically taking up the project, and the publisher himself for actually producing the book. I once again have had the support of the Gulbenkian Foundation, London, for which I am grateful. Acknowledgements for this book must include mention\n\nx\n\nLISBON\n\nof Professor João Flor and Dr Pedro Flor, both proud citizens of Lisbon, who have always been enthusiastic supporters of my Lusitanian projections. I must also thank the Gilda Nunes Barata and Rosário Dantas of the Museu da Cidade for her help and the Museum for allowing me to reproduce the images from its extensive and elegantly housed collection. I also thank colleagues at the Sintra Archives for their help in the past, Nuno Antunes for his ﬁne photos, and his assistant Jorge Matreno. Here at home I am grateful to the ever patient Robert Borsje, who also knows Lisbon well and is such a ﬁne geographer. Lisbon has a rich historiography, particularly in Portuguese, so I have also been guided by generations of writers, poets and artists in reﬁning my appreciation of a truly magniﬁcent city.\n\nMap of Portugal\n\nMap of Lisbon Riverside\n\nMap of Central Lisbon\n\nTo Carlos Alberto Pacheco Jorge and João António Santos, who both, in different ways, loved the city\n\n23 Preface\n\nTo write a history of a city is to write about a person as well as a place. When the city is ancient, like Lisbon, its personality will be complex and many-layered. Some aspects of the city’s story will be repetitive — over and over again the sea ﬁgures in the history of Lisbon — but other features will be ephemeral. The sellers of holy relics no longer throng the religious institutions of the city hawking their dubious wares. They have been replaced by a new breed of streetwise vendors who tout the latest fashions in clothes or in gadgets at bargain prices. Writing about a person suggests a chronology since each individual has his own personal history, but to understand the personality of the city we need to pursue themes which cross over historical ages. These connecting threads are sometimes communal — the Roman Catholic Church has been established in the city for centuries; foreigners, such as the English, have long played a part in its development. Millions of Lisbon’s inhabitants have grown up within view of the river and have earned their living on the waters of it or in industries and commerce connected\n\nxvi\n\nLISBON\n\nwith the sea. Treating our subject in themes will tempt us to look for inﬂuences to explain how this or that came about; historical accounts will shed light on our perspectives. The character of Lisbon has also been formed by its geography. Like Rome it is founded on seven hills; it is at the estuary of a great navigable river, the Tagus. To the west are vast tracts of the Atlantic bringing an oceanic coolness and dampness to soften the severity of a southern climate. It is exceptionally mild in winter with no snow and little frost. Its hinterland is fertile; its geological make-up is seismic. In 1755 a great earthquake destroyed a large part of the city. To these bare geographical facts can be added a political history that has turned the focus of Portugal more towards the overseas rather than inland towards continental Europe. Its Iberian neighbour, Spain, has often been perceived as a threat to its nationhood, which was established early; for a period of sixty years in the sixteenth century the threat became a reality when Portugal was annexed by the Spanish crown. Real or perceived, the geographical position of Spain has meant that Portugal has been cut off from mainstream Europe. We might say that Lisbon, as a result, has been stretched in one direction toward Brazil and in another, southward, toward the Cape of Good Hope, and from there eastwards to Asia. Tracing historical themes will involve us in tracing literary and artistic responses to the city as well. Medieval chroniclers had already described details of Lisbon by the time Damião de Góis wrote his celebrated observations in 1554. The city has always appeared to them and those who have followed as a labyrinth: outward voyaging from the port is matched by inward-looking streets, hidden gardens, stairways that do not seem to lead anywhere. Lisbon is a city of steep inclines and complicated, unsymmetrical streets that criss-cross the hills: only in the Baixa area near the river and in the more modern northern part of the city does any form of a grid system appear. Foreigners, including the English, added to the vast ﬂow of literature about the city, in the nineteenth century. Julio de Castilho\n\nPREFACE\n\nxvii\n\nand other writers put ‘olisipography’, as the study of Lisbon became known, on a scholarly footing. Poets, writers and musicians have enthused over the ages on particular parts of the city — whether it was the fadistas singing of the Alfama, the Romantics languishing at the sight of the moon on the Tagus or Fernando Pessoa stalking the streets of the Chiado. All these perceptions of the city are part of its identity, part of its existence in the imagination of those who perceive it. Exploring them will bring us closer to understanding the enduring character of Lisbon.\n\nLisbon, as Queen of the Seas, claims for herself dominion over so much of the ocean as extends from the mouth of the Tagus to Africa and Asia in an immense maritime circuit. Damião de Góis City mournful and gay, once more I dream in you. Fernando Pessoa I say ‘Lisbon’ When I arrive from the south and cross the river And the city opens up as if born from its name. Sophia de Mello Breyner\n\n23 1\n\nFrom Mythical to Medieval City\n\nThe evolution of Lisbon from prehistoric times through to the Middle Ages can be seen as a series of phases in the life of the city, each of which has left a signiﬁcant mark on its character. The ﬁrst of these stages is the very ancient and indeed elaborately fabled city of pre-classical origins. It is a period shrouded in myth as well as the time when primitive settlements ﬁrst grew up around the Tagus estuary. The next was the Roman imperium during which Lisbon not only became part of a world empire but also became a Latinized city, pre-eminently through its adoption of a vernacular version of Latin. When the Roman Empire collapsed into barbarism, Lisbon joined the league of Christian kingdoms of Iberia, which were to be overrun by the Moorish invasion of the eighth century. Although few physical relics of this period survive, it was important as the time when the Church became established as a leading institution in the city before the Muslim invasion of the eighth century. The establishment of the Moorish caliphate had a profound effect on the city, not only in introducing sophisticated science and technology into its crafts and administration but adding something languid\n\n2\n\nLISBON\n\nand Eastern that has remained in its character and can still be savoured in the very air of the Alfama district. Four centuries later, in the twelfth century, Lisbon was captured by Portugal’s ﬁrst king, Afonso Henriques, and Christianity was restored. The city expanded considerably into a cosmopolitan, commercial port from which the exploration of entirely new worlds overseas in America, Africa and Asia began. That exploration, in turn, enabled the even more spectacular growth of the city as the leading trading centre of Europe in the early sixteenth century. The earliest accounts of Lisbon, as of other ancient European cities, are to be found in Greek legend, often vague and obscure.1 The abiding story, recounted over the ages, is that the city was founded by Ulysses when he travelled westward to the extreme ends of the known world where the fabled gardens of Hesperides were thought to be located. Ulysses must have made his discovery on one of his many voyages after the Trojan War, a period conveniently shrouded in myth and make-belief. Equally convenient for those wanting to believe in legend, the hinterland of Lisbon, particularly the fertile valley of Colares and the mysterious Mons Lunae or Sacred Mountain at Sintra, was just the right setting for the enactment of heroic deeds. Here were all the physical ingredients of myth: a fertile valley where fruit abounded, a river winding its way to the sea, in the background wooded, green slopes, the perfect repose for nymphs. In this same, Poussin-like landscape, Heracles is said to have battled with a monster that rampaged on the coast. When the god had done his work, the grateful inhabitants dragged the body of the monster away in hefty chains.2 Nearby, the lofty Cabo da Roca, at the rocky land’s end and often swirling in mists, provided the ideal setting for worshipping the gods who were said to pass by the Cape during the night.3 The Renaissance Portuguese writers of the sixteenth century, who sealed the story of Ulysses’ foundation of the city, did not worry unduly about the exact moment when he arrived on the\n\nFROM MYTHICAL TO MEDIEVAL CITY\n\n3\n\nshores of the Tagus. Camões, the epic poet of the nation whose Lusiads (1572) tells the story of the Portuguese exploration of the sea routes to India, says, almost in passing, that Lisbon was Named for her founder, that coiner of words Through whose cunning Troy was burned And the city was founded by Ulysses on the exact spot Where the Tagus mingles its fresh water And white sands with the salt sea.4\n\nCamões’ passing reference to the myth was taken up some 50 years later in the monumental work of Gabriel Pereira de Castro, Ulisseia (1636).5 Pereira de Castro was an eminent lawyer who had been a professor at Coimbra. He had written weighty tomes on law and the constitution but clearly yearned to achieve literary, rather than academic, fame. His work, another epic, was intended to adapt Homer’s Iliad to the Portuguese experience, balancing Camões’ evocation of Virgil’s Aeneid in the Lusiads. Like Camões, Pereira de Castro celebrates the feat of overseas discovery by the Portuguese explorers, choosing the lofty heroic mould to set the seal on Portuguese nationhood once and for all. Pereira de Castro’s Ulysses arrives at a place where ships may put in safely at harbour6 and, once ashore, ﬁnds its favourable hinterland, fertile in fruit and capable of supporting good agriculture. This is the same Arcadian land that Ulysses was said to have found at nearby Sintra and Colares. The area in which these myths have been set coincides with the area where the oldest evidence of human habitation has actually been found.7 A plan reconstructing the Paleolithic and Neolithic dwellings in the City Museum (Museu da Cidade) shows a concentration of population to the north and west of the existing city, slightly away from the estuary of the Tagus itself. The Museum’s plan traces sites that may go back 150,000 years. That dating suggests that the area was inhabited by Neanderthal man prior to the arrival from Africa of Homo sapiens, now dated about 35,000 years ago.8\n\n4\n\nLISBON\n\nDeﬁnitive evidence of human habitation in Portugal goes back to a much more recent period. At the Coa Valley, in north-central Portugal, occupation has been dated to about 25,000 years ago. The remains there cover an area of about 17 kilometres of valley; the evidence points to the existence of Stone Age cave-dwellers who survived by hunting wild animals such as bison, bull and stag. Images of these animals, and others, are engraved on the walls of caves. Engravings of this kind have been found closer to the Lisbon area in Upper Alentejo. At Escoural near Evora, engravings of bison, horse and curious hybrid creatures, partly human, have been dated to about 20,000 years ago.9 They show that these cave-dwellers were concerned with representing their environment and trying to interpret the forces that appeared to govern it. The whole area is also rich in Megalithic remains of a more recent period when agriculture and stock raising were well established. Prehistoric stone structures (dolmens and cromlechs) may be seen at Guadaloupe which date from about 4000 BC . The cromlech at Almendres, standing in a clearing of cork oaks, consists of up to 95 granite monoliths arranged in an oval pattern; at Valverde the anta of Zambujeiro is part of a funerary monument consisting of a gallery and dolmen full of relics, now transferred to the nearby museum. Monuments and relics of the Alentejan type are found in the immediate area of Lisbon. Tombs were typically covered with a removable stone slab so that further bodies could be interred in them. Just as the beneﬁts of the hinterland were important in the mythical foundation story so in real life they were important to the survival of Stone Age man. First and foremost in importance was the plentiful supply of water — streams and founts are found all over the hills and dales of the city area. The hills themselves provided good defensive sites; there was an abundant supply of fuel in the form of wood. The forests were also the home of wild animals — stags and bison — which became an important source of food for early man.\n\nFROM MYTHICAL TO MEDIEVAL CITY\n\n5\n\nNearby the river provided another kind of food, ﬁsh, which entered and remained in the national diet.10 Taking to the water also proved to be a convenient method of transport between communities dispersed along the shores of the estuary and the coast. There is a substantial collection of remains at the City Museum dating from this early period. Seashell waste, found in the Tagus Valley, suggest that there was already a settlement in the area from the period between 7000 BC and 5000 BC .11 There are examples of storage jars, vessels of every shape and size, statuary objects, kitchen utensils and, from a later period, ceramic works of various types. By this time the kiln had been invented; ﬂint sickles and hoes were in use; a form of loom has also been found. Funerary remains of various types, indicating a mix of cultures of the indigenous inhabitants, continue to be found.12 Gradually the objects show greater decorative sophistication, such as a small dagger-like plate cut in the shape of a ﬁsh and marked with rings and circles, or large plates with various ridges and circular decorations. Considerable evidence of similar human settlement has been found in the Sintra area, particularly in the valley of São Martinho to the north of the town and in Estefania. Metal objects suggest occupation during the Bronze Age, when axes and primitive chisels were made. This was the period when a plethora of tribes occupied central Portugal, later known as the Roman province of Lusitania. A.H. de Oliveira Marques suggests that this was a period of violent conﬂict when invaders — Lusitanian, Carthaginian and Greek — added to the turmoil of the ﬁghting that was already taking place among the local Iberian tribes.13 Knowledge of this time is still sketchy but it can be dated from about 1000 BC . Celtic inﬂuence was strongest in the north but would have permeated the south as well, a fact already noted by Pliny, who had served in Iberia as Proconsul in the ﬁrst century A D . The Celts were skilled in iron, bronze and gold work; they brought considerable sophistication to the ancient indigenous worship of the solar and\n\n6\n\nLISBON\n\nlunar deities said to have been practised at the Cabo da Roca. Their castros or hilltop settlements were scattered throughout the territory. In many areas they were built on the sites of already existing prehistoric structures. In turn the Romans and then the Moors built upon the same fortress locations. Greek and Phoenician communities were already clustered around the coastal areas, with considerable agriculture carried out in the hinterland. Phoenician Olisipo dates from 1000 BC or even earlier, as remains found in the area of Sé Cathedral show. The Phoenician traders, who dealt in gold, silver and tin, brought with them a culture of the sea and a new cosmopolitanism, based on extensive trading links which covered the entire Mediterranean area. They were succeeded by the Carthaginians, another maritime people who controlled most of the North African coast and the strategic Straits of Gibraltar. Strabo, in his Geography, written in the last years of the ﬁrst century BC , alludes to the ﬁerceness of the Lusitanians and to the considerable prosperity of Tartesso or Megalithic Lusitanian society, which was politically, as well as economically, sophisticated. He contrasts the prosperity of the central southern region with other parts of Iberia, where mountainous terrain or more extreme climate makes for more difﬁcult cultivation and, with it, less economic development and contact with the outside world. This ﬁrst ‘golden’, quasi-mythical age of Lisbon ended quite abruptly when, in 218 BC , the Roman legions marched into Iberia, beginning a colonization that was to have a profound cultural impact, which has endured to modern times. The Roman invasion was part of the global struggle between Rome and Carthage; Rome was determined to dislodge the Carthaginians from the entire area of the Western Mediterranean. Ironically, in areas where the cosmopolitan inﬂuence of Carthage was strongest, such as in the central province of Lusitania (in which the district of Scallabitanus covered the Tagus estuary and the Sintra area) assimilation of Roman culture was least difﬁcult. Here the local Lusitani tribe was\n\nFROM MYTHICAL TO MEDIEVAL CITY\n\n7\n\ninterbred with Celts and the Conii. The Celtiberians, as they are known, had established important trading links with North Africa, enjoying considerable prosperity, which was partly the result of a rich agriculture practised on the plains between the Tagus and the Douro. They were ensconced in impregnable circular fortresses on strategically linked hilltops. Their livelihood came mainly from pastoral agriculture. Nevertheless the Romans could not properly control Lisbon and the vital Tagus estuary, which linked it to the sea and southward to the Mediterranean without subduing the considerable local resistance of the Lusitanians, a ﬁercely independent, martial people. Their leader, Viriatus, organized an effective resistance to Roman occupation, preventing a total Roman takeover for nearly a decade. He was only defeated by an act of treachery among his own men, bribed by Roman gold. Viriatus’ death in 139 BC was a serious setback for the Lusitani. It heralded the beginning of the second phase of Lisbon’s early history as a city, although the struggle to remain independent of Roman rule was by no means over. Both Strabo and Diodorus Siculus record a ﬁerce resistance that the Lusitanians put up against further Roman encroachment, with renewed campaigns in 80–72 BC . This time the leader came from a very different social background, being none other than the ‘hero’ Sertorius.14 Sertorius was a Roman general, based in Lisbon, who became a champion of the Lusitanian tribe. On account of his political stance he had been driven into exile but returned from North Africa to lead the campaign against Lucius Cornelius Sulla. Sertorius was assassinated in 73 A D but his action held up Roman occupation. Nor did the Roman imperium ever properly extend to Trás-os-Montes, which, as always, remained cut off from mainstream developments. Lusitania did not formally become a Roman province until 25 A D , although long before that the southern areas of modern Portugal had become Latinized. The Romans had invaded Iberia for commercial reasons and to challenge the Carthaginian base in the south of Spain. They had\n\n8\n\nLISBON\n\nnot been concerned, at least initially, with conquering territory, and whilst introducing a centralized administration they were tolerant of local customs and even of local religion. J. Cardim Ribeiro suggests that in Lusitania the worship of the Emperor coexisted and was mingled with the traditional worship of lunar and aquatic deities.15 Pagan cults of the serpent and the lizard continued covertly for some generations. To these indigenous practices were added Roman cults of Jupiter, Diana and Saturn. Ex votos, dedicated to these gods, have been found in various sites in the city. Such mixtures of culture were typical of cosmopolitan, far-ﬂung empires, something which Portugal as a nation would itself experience in later times. As Roman occupation continued, particularly during the Pax Romana, the period which began with the reign of Augustus Caesar in the last part of the ﬁrst century BC , Lusitania, like other parts of the Empire, ﬂourished. This was a period of administrative consolidation, during which Roman law was increasingly applied and coinage, standards of weights and measures and the Julian calendar became widely used. The introduction of Latin as the lingua franca meant easier conditions for trade and business; at the same time, the infrastructure was improved by the building of roads between vital points in the country. Olisipo, facing the sea and the southern trade routes to North Africa, was at the centre of the Roman network as it had been of the Phoenician trading routes. By the time the Roman grip on Iberia was consolidated, Rome had become mistress of the Mediterranean, having ﬁnally destroyed Carthage in 146 BC . Trade routes from the western part of the Empire could now be securely guaranteed. In 138 BC Decimus Junius Brutus undertook reinforcement of the walls of Olisipo, suggesting that the area to the north, inhabited by Celtiberians and Lusitanians, remained hostile to Roman occupation. Meanwhile, the city itself and the entire region continued to prosper, its links being directly to the emperor rather than through the Senate as was usually the case in the administration of Roman provinces outside Italy.\n\nFROM MYTHICAL TO MEDIEVAL CITY\n\n9\n\nThis economic expansion had a considerable effect on the immediate hinterland, based on the export of agricultural products such as olive oil, wine, salt and ﬁsh products, particularly the ﬁsh condiment of garum, produced in Setúbal, which was exported directly to Rome by sea. Another, more modest source of wealth came from mining for silver and lead. Although the Romans kept the greatest wealth for themselves, there was also opportunity for indigenous inhabitants to prosper. The Romanized Lusitanians, now speaking the local version of Latin which eventually became Galaico-Portuguese, tended to come from the decuriones, or middle-class property owners distinguishable from the senatores or Roman aristocratic administrators but considerably above the plebs or ordinary citizens. Service in the Roman army could lead to membership of the equites, a class just below the senatorial class from which advancement to the very highest social rank was a possibility. In Olisipo citizens had the same rights as their Roman counterparts.16 Gradually local people, including Greeks who were long settled in the city, would also be admitted to the public service, eventually taking up even the important magisterial positions. As in other parts of the Roman Empire, the entire economic system depended on the institution of slavery. The slaves, drawn from the indigenous population, had no rights of citizenship, yet they were the source of cheap labour on which the prosperity of all well-established citizens, Roman or Luso-Roman, depended. Evidence of the local prosperity in Roman times is spread across the Lisbon region, particularly in the form of funerary monuments. Several of these can be seen in the City Museum’s collection, including lapidary remains found in the grounds of the castle of São Jorge. One such records that Voluscia Tusca, daughter of Gaius, lies buried beneath. Another sarcophagus, decorated with an elaborate frieze, is inscribed with the name of a member of the Galeria tribe, one of the most populous in Roman times. Another is inscribed with the gloomy words ‘Everything earthly is destined to go.’ Inscriptions to the emperor are found on numerous lapidary\n\n10\n\nLISBON\n\nremains. Other remains also show the extent of sophistication of Olisipo as a city — fountains, temples, theatres, public baths, houses with efﬁcient drainage systems — were features of this wellto-do Roman town. To the east were cemeteries; one necropolis was in the area of São Domingues monastery. Temples built in the centre of the city were dedicated to the gods Jupiter, Diana and Cybele (around whom grew the cult of the eternal mother — of earth itself). In some cases Christian churches were later built upon these ancient sites — under the ﬂoors of Sé Cathedral, layers of the remains of ages have been uncovered.17 The Christian church was built on what was the patio of the Moorish mosque, which, in turn, straddled a Roman street, with walls and drains on its sides. All these places of worship had been located in highly urbanized settings, close to densely populated areas. Diana’s temple was in the forum, somewhere in between the estuary and the ridge on which São Jorge’s castle still dominates the skyline. A Roman theatre was located in the Rua da Saudade, running up to the castle walls. A lintel marked ‘Main Entrance’ was excavated recently. A mixture of local marble (from the Sintra area) and Italian marble from Carrara has been identiﬁed in the remains. A stone’s throw away is the present-day Taborda Theatre, established in the nineteenth century. The continuous production of theatrical events in such a conﬁned geographical area over the millennia provides a striking example of the continuity of certain features of civic life. Below the ramparts of the citadel, the centre of the present city remained semi-rural with gardens and orchards still reﬂected in its modern street names. The Roman city was also well supplied with water, an essential resource for Roman urban life. Drinking water and water for thermal baths were brought to every part of the city by a subterranean system. Given Lisbon’s hilly terrain, that was no mean engineering feat. Evidence of the system has come to light over the centuries — after the earthquake of 1755 and much more recently following excavations for the building of the metro in the Praça de Figueira\n\nFROM MYTHICAL TO MEDIEVAL CITY\n\n11\n\nin 2000. A vast cemetery was uncovered underneath the square, with numerous epigraphic inscriptions on the stonework. During excavations pieces of Roman ceramic plate were dug up with other more ancient fossils, indicating continuous inhabitance of the Baixa area since earliest times. In the castle walls and at the Casa dos Bicos, the remains are ornate, displaying all the hallmarks of sophisticated art. A series of streets crossed the city from west to east. At Rossio one of the signal points, which were placed strategically across the urban area, has been uncovered. This was already an area of dense population, as it has remained, with a population of about 30,000. The Roman imperium in Iberia was challenged early in the ﬁfth century at the same time as Alaric the Visigoth sacked Rome (410 A D ). The Germanic invasions of the Peninsula began in 407, according to Oliveira Marques, and were made by sea as well as by land.18 They coincided with considerable local disturbances (bagaudas) which had already upset the calm of Roman centres in the north such as Braga. There is evidence that the local insurgents collaborated with the invaders. Nevertheless, although these barbarian incursions compromised Roman control, they did not altogether threaten the Roman way of life, particularly in the towns and cities. The invaders were more interested in the beneﬁts of a rich southern agriculture than in attempting to replace existing political and administrative institutions. Nor had they come in numbers sufﬁcient to displace the indigenous populations. Instead they looked to the fertile soils of the northern parts of Iberia, including areas of what is now northern Portugal and Galicia, as good productive land from which they could make a comfortable living. In due course they moved south, toward the Lisbon area, but tended to avoid direct conﬂict with the inhabitants of the towns. Olisipo itself was by now a well-established Roman town with the usual beneﬁts of municipal planning and infrastructure. Its prosperous citizens spread themselves across the whole area, building\n\n12\n\nLISBON\n\nvillas in the planalto or ﬂat plain north-westwards toward Mafra. These patterns of civic life ﬁrmly identify Lisbon as a Latin city — the cultural heritage of the Roman period (which was largely assimilated by barbarian invaders) sprung roots which endured for much longer than the mere physical buildings of the city, though the evidence suggests these were impressive. Something profound and lasting had been superimposed on the complex, cosmopolitan Phoenician and Greek city by the long period of Roman occupation. During the ﬁfth century the Suevi occupied Portugal whilst the Vandals and Visigoths invaded Spain. The Suevi, who had come from the Rhineland, were a warrior people who had been constantly on the move and were now tempted to settle in the gentle LusoGalician lands they had reached. This area of the north-western Peninsula had already formed something of a distinct cultural region toward the end of the Roman period. The capital of the Suevic kingdom was established at the regional centre of Braga (Dume) with occupation of Oporto, further south as well. Much of the information about the Suevic kingdom comes from Hydatius, Bishop of Chaves, who acted as a negotiator between the Suevi and the Romans. He also had dealings with the Visigothic Kingdom of Spain. There was also much turbulence during this period; Roman Conimbriga, for example, was destroyed. The Suevi did not attempt to obliterate Roman custom where they existed, nor did they change the lingua franca of this part of Iberia. Their own language had, in any case, never been written down. The consolidation of their base in the north contributed to the growing identity of that area, which eventually became the foundation of the nation of Portugal itself. When they moved further south, they practised the same policy of tolerance and alliance with the localized Roman communities. The Roman governor of Olisipo, one Lusidius, welcomed Suevic leaders to the city and formed an alliance with them. Nevertheless his efforts did not prevent a sacking of the city in 469.\n\nFROM MYTHICAL TO MEDIEVAL CITY\n\n13\n\nThese political developments encouraged the assimilation of Suevic and Roman culture at a time when Roman rule itself was collapsing. By 476 the Western Roman Empire went into extinction. The pattern of cultural integration which marked its passing was an early example of a toleration of foreigners that has been the common experience of the inhabitants of the Portuguese territory. That toleration continued under Moorish rule, where, in accordance with Koranic imperative, considerable tolerance was shown to believers of other religions, including Christianity and Judaism. As the relics of Roman administration disappeared, the Catholic Church emerged as the leading political institution; the Suevic Kingdom in Portugal was becoming Christianized, after more than a century of contact with Christian subjects within its jurisdiction. But it was with the arrival of St Martin at Dume, before 550, that the ofﬁcial conversion took place. St Martin is said to have saved the life of the son of the Suevic king, Theodemir, and, perhaps as a reward, was duly installed at Braga as archbishop. At Dume he rebuilt the church dedicated to his namesake, St Martin of Tours, who in the Middle Ages was to become a great cult ﬁgure after whom many churches were named. St Martin had the vision of a secular kingdom but one that was Roman in its religion and culture. It would also have the capacity to absorb pagan features in its ritual. The authority of the Church was conﬁrmed by the holding of religious councils at Braga in 563 and again in 572. The result of these councils was a reorganization and strengthening of the Church by the rearrangement of sees and synods, both within the Suevic kingdom and in neighbouring Galicia. These developments conﬁrmed a cultural identity for the northern region which was later to prove decisive in the formation of the kingdom of Portugal. St Martin’s political views were later reﬂected in the code of St Isidore of Seville, which similarly aimed to apply a system of law to Romans, Suevi and Goths alike. Within these basically theocratic\n\n14\n\nLISBON\n\nstates, commerce was considered to be a morally dubious activity. Its practice was left to the Jewish minority. As in other parts of Europe, the exclusion of Jews from the professions meant that they became dangerously marginalized from mainstream society. Nevertheless, they were left to practise their own religion until the Inquisition was set up in the sixteenth century. Occasionally things were less welcome to the citizens of Ulixbuna (as Lisbon had become known), such as the tribute demanded after a Visigothic invasion. The Visigothic kingdom in Spain and the Suevic kingdom in Portugal survived as theocracies until the invasion of the Moors at the beginning of the eighth century. While the physical relics from this period in Portugal are few, the establishment of the Church as a political institution of signiﬁcance in the affairs of the city was something that would prove enduring and would be restored after the next phase of Muslim occupation, which was to last for four centuries. The Moorish period began with the tentative crossing of Moorish troops from North Africa in 710 under the command of Tarif Ibn Malik. The purpose of his mission was to test what resistance there might be to Muslim annexation of lands reputed to be rich in human and natural resources. The Moorish invaders were surprised not to meet any local opposition; Tarif Ibn Malik reported back to the governor of Tangier, Tarif Ibn Ziyad, that a full-scale invasion was feasible. This took place the following summer in 711 under the governor’s own command. Late in the day, the Visigothic king, Roderick, who had been campaigning against the Basques in the north, realized the danger. He returned to Córdoba and rallied what he could of a mixed band of Iberian troops. By this time, the Moorish army had had time to ensconce itself at Algeciras where it waited. When Roderick was at last ready to attack, which he did, his divided forces could not match the discipline of the invading army. The Christian coalition was roundly defeated; within a matter of months, the Moorish generals swept northwards, taking Seville, Mérida and Toledo on the way. The territory of Portugal\n\nFROM MYTHICAL TO MEDIEVAL CITY\n\n15\n\nwas in Muslim hands by 713; the Moors were led by Abelaziz Ibn Musa, the son of Tariq Ibn Malik. These Moorish incursions began a chapter of immense signiﬁcance in the history of Iberia. Although the territory of Portugal began to be ‘liberated’ in the twelfth century, Moorish rule on the Peninsula as a whole lasted until the end of the caliphate in Granada in 1492. It was not, of course, a period of continuous calm. Local resistance to Moorish rule began within a decade of the foreign arrival and in the far north of Spain and in difﬁcult, mountainous territory in the north of Portugal, the rule of the Moorish rulers was shaky, and in part non-existent. Christian states like Asturias were established in the north and the caliphs of the south had to mount an annual summer campaign against the Christians to protect their precious Iberian territories. Sometimes alliances formed across the religious divide in recognition of the fact that the Moorish presence in Al Andalus was the most politically signiﬁcant in the Peninsula. Moorish rule affected Iberia in many different ways: Lisbon, at the western point of the Peninsula, shared that experience as much as other Iberian cities. One of the abiding cultural legacies of the occupation, particularly in the earlier centuries, was that of cultural and indeed ethnic mixing. The attitude of the Muslim rulers was based on a religious precept but undoubtedly was shaped by pragmatic considerations as well. The Koran teaches a respect for all religions (including Christianity and Judaism) whilst the small number of the Moors in proportion to the indigenous population (estimated at between 40,000 and 300,000) suggested the wisdom of a liberal system of governance. Nevertheless peaceful integration was not always possible. The threat from the Christian kingdoms of the northern part of Iberia was matched by internal insurrection. From time to time dangerous, radical sects appeared, as in 944, leading to their suppression and an anti-Christian mood. The arrival of the puritanical Almovarids, toward the close of the eleventh century,\n\n16\n\nLISBON\n\nended the policy of tolerance altogether. The fusion of culture and religion so characteristic of Mozarab Balata, in which Lisbon was situated, was to be severely tested. By the time of the so-called Reconquest,19 the tradition of tolerance between religions had entirely died. Moorish rule in the Garbe (as the Portuguese caliphate was known) was concentrated on the south (the area of modern Algarve) with the city of Silves as its capital. The southern part of the country had become very populous, rivalling centres in the north. But like their predecessors, the Suevi and the Romans, the Moors were content to build upon local structures and, where it made sense, to amalgamate customs and practices with their own. The Roman territorium or province was replaced by the Moorish kura; the conventus or constituency by the qarya. The feeling of administrative continuity added to a gradual assimilation of Christians to Moorish rule and the development of a distinctive, mixed Mozarab culture. The cultural and economic signiﬁcance of the Moorish occupation of Balata, the province that stretched from Lisbon to Santarém, was considerable. Not only were practical sciences like irrigation effective in raising agricultural production but Portuguese culture was inﬂuenced by the language, law and customs of Islam in many different ways. The most graphic examples of this inﬂuence was in architecture, as was the case across Iberia and in the art of ceramics which remained a main form of artistic expression when Portugal eventually emerged as a Christian nation in the twelfth century. Lisbon was always the jewel in the crown of Moorish Balata — a series of fortresses at Santarém and at Sintra formed a protective ring around the capital. This protection was much needed since there were a number of Christian attempts to take the city. It was attacked in 796 by the King of Asturias and in 844 by the Normans from the sea but a stout resistance saw off the enemy. It was sacked again by Spanish forces in 851. Another Norman invasion, centred\n\nFROM MYTHICAL TO MEDIEVAL CITY\n\n17\n\non Alcácer do Sal, was defeated in 966. In the eleventh century the city was taken by the Christians, but was recaptured by Sid Ibn Abu Bakr in 1094 when Count Raymond of Burgundy was defeated outside the city’s smoking walls. In addition there were various internal Arab uprisings, sometimes led by disaffected Berbers, from the earliest times. The hinterland of Lisbon, particularly in the fertile area of Colares and around the estuary of the Tagus, beneﬁted from the sophistication of Moorish irrigation systems and methods of water storage. Wheat and barley, vegetables and fruit (including the grape) were grown in these areas adjacent to the city. Despite the Koranic injunction against drinking alcohol, the vine continued to be cultivated as it had been in Roman times. Ibn Muçana, mayor of Lisbon in the eleventh century, penned his ode to Alcabideche, then a small village in the footholds of the Sintra hills, praising among its products grain, onions and pumpkins.20 He and other Moorish poets enthused on the luxuriant vegetation which a plentiful supply of water allowed, as well as a rich wildlife which included much prized falcons. The Moors were also responsible for rebuilding much of the city, which had fallen into ruins in Germanic times. The citadel of São Jorge, its rampant walls and all the main defensive structures of the modern city were put in place; a medina, mosques, fountains and governor’s residence were all constructed to embellish the city; ceramic arts of tiling and rooﬁng were introduced. The area of Alfama just below the walls of São Jorge’s Castle, with its maze of winding streets, white houses and small hidden gardens or interior courtyards, is the most notably Moorish area. The castle was itself the seat of Moorish rule — the Alcáçova, as it was known, continued to be the principal residence of the early Portuguese kings. The Alfama itself is an inward-looking quarter: blank walls face streets which twist in complicated patterns; cobbled staircases descend steeply into obscure alleyways. There is always a surprise awaiting — either a sweeping vista or a dead end can greet the walker when\n\n18\n\nLISBON\n\nturning a corner. The quarter lies protected by the shadow of the castle walls above it.21 The mood of Moorish Lisbon is well caught in José Saramago’s novel The History of the Siege of Lisbon, which tells the story of the city’s capture from the Moors in 1147 by Afonso Henriques, the ﬁrst king of Portugal and known as the Conqueror. Here is an early morning scene of what could be an Islamic city anywhere across the Muslim world: Much, much later, the ﬁrst light of morning broke through behind the city, black against the light, little by little the minarets faded, and when the sun appeared, still invisible from this spot where we are standing, familiar voices could be heard echoing amongst the hills, those of the muezzins summoning the followers of Allah to prayer.22\n\nOne of Saramago’s turbanned muezzins is blind. Hearing the sound of rejoicing, he wonders if the inﬁdels have been defeated by a response from Allah, who has heard the fervent prayers of the devout citizens and sent the angels Munkar and Nakir, guardians of his tomb, to exterminate the Christians.23 As Saramago shows, the defence of Lisbon rested upon the rampart fortiﬁcations, with São Jorge’s Castle at the high point on the ridges, the only access to the city from the north and east being through three gates of Martim Moniz, of Sol and of the Alfama itself. On the southern side was the gate of Alfofa, access to which was well-nigh impossible due to the precipitous rock faces rising from the estuary in front of it. Moreover from any point along the river, the invaders would have to cross difﬁcult terrain to actually get to the bottom of these natural ramparts in the ﬁrst place. Seen from their perspective, the city appeared as one vast impenetrable dome. The exotic strain of Saramago’s account of the end of the Caliphate in Lisbon reﬂects a profound inﬂuence that the period has had in the imagination of the nation. Although the Christian reconquest has been traditionally seen as the resurgence of the Christian nation, the events that took place need to be set in the context of a rich, cross-cultural society which, in its cosmopolitan\n\nFROM MYTHICAL TO MEDIEVAL CITY\n\n19\n\nadoption of more than one set of norms and customs, set the scene for a country which was to become comfortable in overseas and far-ﬂung lands. Centuries of Mozarabic life were not ﬂung aside but synthesized into the fabric of the new nation. At the head of this new revolution was the dashing ﬁgure of Afonso Henriques, a Burgundian prince who failed several times to take Lisbon either in 1137 or in 1140 on his second attempt. His campaigns, extending over several decades, were aimed at securing the northern territory of Portucale, the embryo of the Portuguese kingdom, soon to be recognized by Rome. When he did succeed in capturing Lisbon in 1147, seven years later, he had to rely on the support of a motley collection of English, German and Flemish mercenaries. The foreigners did not support him for nothing; their eyes were on the considerable spoils that Lisbon would have to offer. Rumour had it that great wealth had been amassed in the city by its Moorish rulers. This was the glittering prize the crusaders fought for. A propaganda war was also fought on both sides. The Archbishop of Braga rallied the Christian side. He railed against the Moorish inhabitants of the city. Go back unbidden to the land of the Moors where you came, with your luggage, money and goods and your women and children, leaving to us our own… You Moors and Moabites fraudulently seized the realm of Lusitania from your King and ours.24\n\nThe Moors were not impressed. They had occupied the city for centuries; it was clearly God’s wish that it should be Muslim. They had no intention of handing it over to inﬁdels. After persistent attempts, English and Flemish troops eventually managed to drive the Moors back from western and eastern suburbs but the defenders, having nothing to lose, ensconced themselves in the citadel, where they fought off further attacks. The siege lasted over four months; the Moorish garrison was reduced almost to starvation despite beginning with a large underground store of wheat and barley, dried ﬁgs and oil.25 The\n\n20\n\nLISBON\n\nsummer heat made conditions particularly unpleasant. There were rumours of cannibalism having broken out among a population that may have numbered 40,000. The propaganda war was also continued on both sides — the Christians trying to put the fear of God into the defenders, the defenders relying on the will of Allah to protect them. Miraculous events were reported in both camps; heroes such as Martim Moniz were later honoured by having parts of the city named after them. In the end it was the building of attacking towers by the English that enabled troops to storm the citadel. Once the crusading mercenaries breached the defences and entered the city, they indulged in uncontrolled pillage and debauchery — those inhabitants who could ﬂed from the city in fear of their lives; others were massacred. After the capture of Lisbon by Afonso Henriques, the Muwalladi population (Christians who had converted to Moorish rule) and remaining Moors tended to reside in certain designated areas or mourarias. Like the Jews, they were allowed to continue practising their faith without hindrance, although they were stigmatized as second-class citizens debarred from holding civil or military posts. An Englishman, Gilbert of Hastings, gained his reward for serving Afonso Henriques by being installed as the Bishop of Lisbon. A new cathedral, Sé, was built in the grounds of the principal mosque, as we have seen. The rest of the city was divided into nine parishes, each with its own church, of which three — São Vicente, Santa Justa and Nossa Senhora dos Mártires — survive.26 The cosmopolitan mix that all this entailed and the city’s web of foreign connections meant that the growth of medieval Lisbon as a seaport came as a natural cultural development. From earliest times Lisbon had had a maritime ﬂavour; its experience of many seafaring nations — whether they were Phoenician, Greek or Roman — brought a wealth of knowledge and expertise in the various arts of navigation and commerce. During Moorish times one of the city gates opened directly on to the sea. Legend also played a part in the growing maritime identity of Al-Usbana or Moorish Lisbon.\n\nFROM MYTHICAL TO MEDIEVAL CITY\n\n21\n\nOne story told of the embarkation of eight young voyagers who set sail to ﬁnd the limits of the world. Whether they returned or not is unknown but the same quest was undertaken hundreds of years later by the Portuguese explorers of the Manueline Age. The notion that Lisbon had connections with the most distant places in the world was already part of its fabric, mythical and real. The importance of the sea to Lisbon was marked in the growth of naval activities and installations, on the one hand, and the protectionist policies adopted towards ﬁshing, on the other. Small single-mast boats were gradually replaced by more sophisticated, larger vessels of three masts. Eventually the caravel, swift and much admired abroad, enabled exploration of the far-off West African coast. Naval carpenters and shipwrights were awarded special privileges above other trades such as armourers or tailors27 so that the industry connected to the sea continued to attract recruits. Meanwhile, long-distance ﬁshing and the preservation of ﬁsh by salting became part of the city’s life. By the fourteenth century Portuguese merchant shipping was established all over Europe. In the Low Countries factories were set up at Bruges and at Antwerp. There was a direct trading link to London. By the end of the century Lisbon had become a bustling seaport with 400 or 500 ships using the facilities of the harbour. The city lay strategically placed between Europe and Africa and, eventually, between Europe and America. Among the cargoes carried out of the port were those of cork, olive oil, wine, hides, wax and honey whilst metals, arms and textiles were imported.28 The impetus to sail further, particularly in a southerly direction, came in the next century, by which time the lure of gold and slaves from Africa encouraged further expansion of the Portuguese shipping trade. The new coinage, the cruzado, was minted in 1457. The growth of Lisbon’s maritime trade had many effects, from the development of parts of the city to immigration by particular foreign nationals closely connected with the international commerce. While the area around Rossio continued to grow in\n\n22\n\nLISBON\n\nimportance, eclipsing the eastern ridges of the castle and the Alfama, the land adjacent to the sea at the front of the modern Baixa also expanded. Along the river, the shipbuilders set themselves up; warehouses and naval quarters came later on. Occupying the littoral involved drainage schemes and the creation of embankments on the levelled-out land: engineering knowledge of this type increased as demand led to more developments along the Tagus estuary. The merchant class and the nobility were the principal beneﬁciaries. We have seen that the English were involved in the earliest days of the city but another nationality well represented were the Italians including Lombard merchants, Venetian traders, Milanese ﬁnanciers and above all the seafaring Genoese. The Genoese had already become leading traders in the North Sea and the Baltic: Lisbon was an obvious port of call on the way southward again to the Mediterranean via Gibraltar and Ceuta where they were well established. Genoese merchants were already gaining rights in the city by the second part of the thirteenth century. Among the Italian community are mentioned certain Vivaldo brothers, who had inﬂuential connections in their home city. One Genoese, Manuel Pessagno, became the ﬁrst Portuguese admiral of the ﬂeet,29 eventually taking on a Portuguese name, Pessanha. In the royal letter of appointment of 1317, Pessagno is given ultimate authority over all Portuguese vessels. He and his successors are bestowed with the ﬁefdom in an act of ultimate feudal authority by Dom Dinis. Naval development was boosted by the need to fend off pirates, particularly Moorish ones, who raided the ships which plied their trade in and out of Lisbon. Pessagno came from one of the cosmopolitan, mercantile families of Genoa (his brother was based in England) so he understood very well the value of protecting trade. In due course he set himself up in style in a palace on one of the city hills which later became known as Pedreira. No doubt his presence, as well as that of other Genoese, added to Portuguese knowledge of cartography, a science that later\n\nFROM MYTHICAL TO MEDIEVAL CITY\n\n23\n\nwas to underlie the explorations encouraged by Prince Henry the Navigator. The Italians also introduced the compass and many improvements to shipping construction. Another foreign community of signiﬁcance in Lisbon was the Jewish one. Jews who had ﬂed persecution from different European countries found a reasonable degree of religious tolerance in Portugal. Even so, they were conﬁned to certain areas or quarters ( judiarias), the oldest of which was right in the centre of the city near Baixa, where their synagogue had been built in the Moorish times. Later other ghettoes were designated, although successful individuals would always manage to live outside them. The magnates wore the same clothes as Christians, unlike their less privileged fellow Jews, who were obliged to wear special identifying marks on their garments. Dr Jeronimo Munzer, on tour in 1492, gives a ﬂavour of the opulence of the city’s Jews. At the foot of the castle there are three Jewish quarters that close down at night. On the Saturday before St. Andrew’s feast, I visited the Jewish synagogue and I must say that I have never seen its equal. In this temple, there is a patio covered by an enormous vine; its circumference measures four palms. The place is lovely and there is a cathedra to preach from, like in the mosques! Inside two large candelabra are lit, with 50 or 60 lamps each, among other lights. Women have a separate synagogue, which is also profusely lit. Lisbon Jews are wealthy; charging handsomely for their services. They treat the Christians with insolence.30\n\nThe proximity of the Jewish quarter to the business and harbour area of the city underlines the importance of the Jewish merchants in the commercial life of the city. Christians could enter the well-placed Jewish areas to conduct business during the daytime. Whenever royal consideration was being given to moving the Jews to other areas (complaints were made from time to time about the advantages of the Jewish sites), the commercial importance of the community was not overlooked. The Moorish designated area (mouraria) remained closer to the castle walls, in the area north of the Alfama, which we have\n\n24\n\nLISBON\n\nalready noted for its Arabic architectural character. One recurring characteristic of the style was in its use of arches and small, almost hidden windows, a feature which adds a particular charm to the streets of the area. The Moors and Mozarabs retained their mosque, and control of that area was regulated from a council meeting in it. The chief ofﬁcer was the alcaide or mayor; the religious life continued to be regulated by the imams and muezzins who called the faithful to prayers. The Moors too were obliged to wear identifying clothing, for example the half-moon emblem on the turban. Unlike the Jews, the Moors were prohibited from many activities, including commerce, so that they were conﬁned to making a living as artisans or craftsmen or agricultural labourers. Even in these lowly occupations, they were subject to taxation from which the crown beneﬁted. During the Middle Ages, Lisbon, like other European cities, suffered from the twin calamities of famine and plague. It also had another natural disaster to contend with — that of earthquakes, which hit the region from time to time. In a largely agricultural economy, failure in crop production led to immediate disaster. The cause of bad harvest was usually drought, but from time to time inundation from rain ruined a year’s crops. The years 1333 and 1334 were particularly bad — wheat production was all but wiped out and with it the staple diet, bread. Starvation threatened the populous city and people were reduced to eating grass. The plague too took its toll in the fourteenth century; the most serious outbreak was in 1348. It affected countryside and city alike but the effects in the city, already the target of migration by the peasants, were worse. It is possible that between a third and a half of the population of the greater Lisbon area perished in that year. The suffering and hardship were immense. As well as the proximity of volcanic rock in the Sintra area, a series of seismic fault lines run across in a north-easterly direction from the ‘Focinho’ or ‘muzzle’ of the Cabo da Roca. Trembles were often recorded but the two worst occurrences were in 1356\n\nFROM MYTHICAL TO MEDIEVAL CITY\n\n25\n\nand 1531. Damage to buildings, such as churches, is recorded on these occasions sometimes in the plans for repairs to buildings that needed to be undertaken, sometimes in the plans for complete reconstruction when the damage had been severe. Like all natural disasters, the earthquakes also reinvigorated the economy, providing extra employment for those in the building and construction industry in particular. Natural disaster was matched by the continued threat from Spain, once the Moorish occupation of the Algarve was brought to an end in the mid-thirteenth century. The military orders of Santiago, as well as the Templars and Hospitallers, had played an important part in this success. By 1256 Lisbon had become the capital of the emerging nation, one of the earliest territorial states of modern Europe.31 The character of the nation was consolidated by the growth of Galaico–Portuguese as a distinct Iberian dialect. Most legal records concerning the ownership of property and royal charters were originally written in Latin. During the twelfth century, the vernacular is mingled with the Latin records. The growth of national identity, closely linked to language, gained a considerable boost during the reign of King Dinis, who, among other cultural gestures of signiﬁcance, founded the Estudo Geral or ﬁrst university in Lisbon, which was then located in the Alfama. In the 1290s the university moved to Coimbra but during the next hundred years or so moved to and fro between the two cities. The university depended on the patronage of the Church as much as of the state; many Portuguese continued to study abroad at institutions like Salamanca or further aﬁeld in Montpellier and Louvain. King Dinis ordered the translation of ofﬁcial documents into Portuguese; he, like other members of the Burgundian dynasty, was interested in courtly verse, which was now written in GalaicoPortuguese in Spanish, as well as Portuguese, court circles. More signiﬁcant in political terms was the growth of the local councils, whose authority has derived from charters ( forais) granted to various towns by successive monarchs. Whilst the nobility,\n\n26\n\nLISBON\n\nwith its commitment to military service, headed the hierarchical social pyramid of medieval society, below them were the gentlemen knights ( ﬁdalgos) and the higher clergy, whose political support was useful to the crown. Considerable beneﬁts were bestowed upon these worthy citizens in the charters of Lisbon and Sintra; that in turn guaranteed the support of the peasants who worked on the lands of the ﬁdalgos or in one way or another were connected to serving the crown. The local councils (later seen by the nineteenth-century historian Alexandre Herculano as developments of the Roman curia plena and the Germanic concilia) formed the basis of the cortes or great council which the King regularly consulted on matters of state. Whilst the ﬁrst cortes called at Coimbra in 1211 consisted of noblemen, the 1254 cortes of Leiria was made up mainly of burghers. During the same period, Afonso IV reformed the system of justice, trying to inject a greater impartiality into the judicial process by appointing judges to serve outside the districts from which they themselves came. A hierarchy of higher and lower courts was established. Civil law was distinguished from criminal law. King Dinis had also taken an active interest in economic development. He understood the importance of ownership of land among smaller holders, encouraging disenfranchisement of larger interests, including that of the Church. To boost national prosperity, he undertook public works such as land drainage and supported mining for silver and iron, continuing to extract the traditional royal tax of a ﬁfth of the value of any production. Meanwhile new orders of chivalry (the Order of Christ at Tomar), and beneﬁts bestowed upon the university and those studying sciences, encouraged the consolidation of the national effort to improve standards of living. Despite this redistribution of wealth, the most cultivatable land remained in the hands of the nobility and clergy. As communications from north to south of the country improved, the wealth of the towns increased with beneﬁts to the\n\nFROM MYTHICAL TO MEDIEVAL CITY\n\n27\n\ncrown, which collected taxes in cash and kind. The court tended to move about the country: both Afonso IV (1325—1357) and Pedro I (1357—1367) moved between Lisbon, Santarém and Coimbra, giving out the idea that the king was a man of all his domains. When Fernando succeeded in 1367, the crown was reputed to have hoarded 800,000 pieces of gold and 400,000 silver marks in the castle of Lisbon alone.32 It was Fernando’s marriage to the Spanish princess Leonor Teles which led directly to unrest in the capital. Henry II of Castile had been seen as the major threat to the city, laying siege to it in 1373 and forcing Fernando to abandon his alliance with John of Gaunt. The English alliance was only revived after the death of Henry but Fernando’s pursuit of it showed how it remained an option for combating the Castilian menace as it arose from time to time. To counter the immediate threat, Fernando built a new defensive wall around the city, the ‘cerca Fernandina’, which was completed in 1376. The history of these years was chronicled much later by Fernão Lopes, who became the custodian of records at the Torre do Tombo, eventually to become the principal national archive. Lopes was commissioned by Dom Duarte to write his chronicle of Portuguese history in 1434. Known as the Chronicle of 1419 or the Seven First Kings of Portugal, it is the principal example of contemporary historiography. Robert Southey, a considerable scholar of the lusophone world, greatly admired Lopes, respecting the chronicler’s use of documentary evidence, some of which was subsequently lost. That attention to sources adds to the value of Lopes’s work, however ideologically slanted its overall perspective. Civil unrest reached a climax in 1383 when a group of disaffected burghers approached João, Master of the Order of Avis and bastard son of Pedro I, to take the crown. By this move, they wanted to prevent the accession of Juan I of Castile, whose claim to the Portuguese throne was based on his marriage to Beatriz, King Fernando’s daughter. Juan I was supported by many of the old nobility whilst João attracted members of the rising families\n\n28\n\nLISBON\n\nsuch as Nun’Álvares Pereira,33 a young soldier who managed to rally the citizens of Lisbon to the Avis banner. Their support was given on the basis of some political representation — a body known as the ‘House of Twenty-Four’ was created as part of the political settlement. Each of the twelve major city guilds elected two representatives to the House. In turn members of it attended meetings of the city council, through which there was access to the crown. The Avis dynasty, as it became, was therefore founded on a certain populist basis in so far as the burghers and tradesmen of Lisbon played some part in its establishment. The contest between the two rival claimants reached a peak when the Spanish invaded Portugal. The Spanish claimant was already unwell and decided to avoid the towns of Coimbra and Leiria. The Portuguese were guarding the Tagus, waiting for English reinforcements. At a crucial moment Nun’ Álvares decided to attack the invaders and, marching northwards, met and defeated the Castilians at the battle of Aljubarrota on 14 August 1385. The battle was won partly as a result of the technical prowess of English archers, opening a new phase in the relations between the two kingdoms, which gained formal recognition in the following year by the Treaty of Windsor, 1386. The terms of the treaty stated that there shall be between the two above-mentioned kings now reigning, their heirs and successors, and between the subjects of both kingdoms an inviolable, eternal, solid, perpetual and true league of friendship, alliance and union.34\n\nThe treaty bound the two countries to come to one another’s aid when attacked by enemies. It became the cornerstone of Portuguese foreign policy for centuries and matured into the oldest alliance between European countries. Meanwhile, in recognition of his victory at Aljubarrota, the king ordered the construction of a church of Santa Maria da Vitória at Batalha, a few miles north of the battleground.\n\nFROM MYTHICAL TO MEDIEVAL CITY\n\n29\n\nThe Iberian connection with England might have been even more direct had John of Gaunt succeeded in his quest for the Castilian crown. As it was, his daughter Philippa came to Portugal as the wife of João I. They set up court at Sintra in the summer months, undertaking considerable work on the old royal palace (Paço Real) in the centre of the medieval village. The king and queen were concerned with establishing a court that sufﬁciently reﬂected Portugal’s status as a leading player among the nations of Christendom. Their talented offspring, Duarte (the future king), Pedro and the younger Prince Henry the Navigator, all took the task of modernizing the nation seriously. Pedro toured the countries of Europe in search of scientiﬁc knowledge; Prince Henry, by his patronage of navigational science, laid the basis for the exploration of Atlantic islands and the West African coast. Madeira 35 was reached in the 1420s and was put under the personal authority of Prince Henry; the Azores, where Flemish settlers joined the Portuguese, was the next discovery. The Atlantic islands as a whole soon became important suppliers of agricultural products, boosting the commercial development of the port of Lisbon. By 1460, when Prince Henry died, the Cape Verde islands had been captured and the Portuguese caravels had reached the coast of Sierra Leone and were poised to continue southwards to the Cape of Good Hope.36 Meanwhile the crown found it necessary to tighten its grip on ﬁnances. There had been a long tradition that the king paid noblemen (and sometimes others like the gentlemen knights of Sintra) for their services in defence of the realm. A register was kept at court which showed the rise and demise of families when they changed sides in politics — Nun’Álvares Pereira 37 and the House of Bragança had become an important example of the emergence of the new nobility to whom the Avis kings were indebted. Nevertheless, by the time of King Duarte, it was necessary to revisit the amounts being paid out. A system of reversions to the crown in cases where there was no legitimate claimant to the royal grant was\n\n30\n\nLISBON\n\nput in place (the so-called Lei Mental of 1434). The military orders, such as the Templars and the clergy, were also beneﬁciaries of royal favours; in the latter case it enabled the king to keep control of appointments which were made on the basis of his recommendations to Rome through the transmission of papal letters. At the same time administrative reforms were introduced; a chancellor was appointed to be in charge of royal ﬁnances with undersecretaries regulating different areas of income and expenditure. By these means the economic life of a nation that by now may have numbered a million was gradually being centralized. During the disturbances of the late fourteenth century, as we have seen, the merchant and artisan classes became more assertive — tailors and coopers were involved in supporting the rise to power of João of Avis. When he held his ﬁrst cortes, there were requests for the preservation of knightly practices in the guild system with its strong hierarchical ordering. The Moors and Jews were excluded from membership, though they had, to a certain extent, a system of their own governance in their allotted ghettoes. Lisbon itself, with its considerable Moorish and Jewish quarters, continued to ﬂourish. Fernando had built a new wall around the city within which there were still hortas or garden areas producing food for consumption, although the main supply came from Sintra and Colares (wheat and fruit are most often cited). The beneﬁts of the city’s location were well captured in a late-ﬁfteenth-century visitor’s account. Half a mile below Lisbon are two hills about a quarter of a mile from each other; through the gorge formed between them, the sea ﬂows in the direction of the mouth of the river up to a distance of fourteen leagues. In some places it is up to three leagues wide, being narrower in others. How fertile and well populated the banks of this stretch of sea are! There is an abundance of olive oil, salt and all the fruits of the earth. Ships are sheltered from even the most violent tempests in Lisbon.38\n\nFROM MYTHICAL TO MEDIEVAL CITY\n\n31\n\nThe population of the city may have been upward of 50,000.39 The Portuguese kings continued to live in the castle — still known by its Moorish name the Alcaçova. The cathedral (Sé) rose on the slopes below and the narrow streets of the Jewish quarter continued along the river’s edge in the present commercial Baixa. One of the earliest thoroughfares was the Rua Nova D’El Rey, running parallel to the river, just north of the present Praça do Comércio. Houses were now two- or three-storeyed: shops or artisans’ workplaces on the ground level with balconies on the ﬁrst ﬂoors. Although the gardens and even pasturage may have been a relief in the urban setting, lack of proper drainage would have made the city unpleasant, particularly in the summer. Many diarists complained of its ﬁlthiness. The local habit of pouring out rubbish into the streets continued to cause annoyance to foreign visitors like William Beckford and Robert Southey in the eighteenth century. Some enduring characteristics of the city’s personality cannot be counted among its charms.\n\n23 2\n\nThe Imperial City\n\nPortuguese overseas expansion reached a zenith during the reign of King Manuel I (1495–1521), whose sobriquet, the Fortunate, celebrates the successes of his era. What had started as a commercially based enterprise turned into an imperial quest. The ﬁrst trading posts usually straddled coastlines. The settlements had a fort as their nucleus; gradually buildings began to appear around it to support commercial activities. The demand for goods and services that these colonies made from the immediate hinterlands in which they were located grew to such a point that occupation of those areas became essential. Moreover, rivalry from other European powers was keen and meant that the Portuguese enclaves had to be more effectively defended than they could be by the strategic fortresses alone. Dutch and English forces made ever bolder attempts to take over the lucrative trade routes, forcing the Portuguese to build more elaborate defences and take more land around the trading ports. The ﬂowering of the Manueline empire was based on the steady achievements of the preceding century or more. The ﬁrst arena\n\nTHE IMPERIAL CITY\n\n33\n\nof Portuguese overseas operation had been in North Africa at the beginning of the ﬁfteenth century. To capture territory from the erstwhile rulers of Iberia, the Moors, was a mark of singular symbolic signiﬁcance for the Portuguese crown. Patriotic fervour was at a high pitch, so that young members of the nobility were drawn to support a cause that would, in many cases, cost them their own lives. In 1415 a ﬂeet of 200 ships carrying 20,000 troops set sail from Lisbon to capture Ceuta, strategically placed on the African shore across from Gibraltar. In the face of the invaders’ overwhelming military superiority, the Moorish inhabitants of the town gave in without resistance. The town was then fortiﬁed into a stronghold guarding the vital Straits of Gibraltar. After this initial success, Dom Afonso V, known as the African, took his campaign right across Morocco, capturing AlcácerCeguer, Arsila and eventually Tangier itself (there had been an earlier attempt to take the town in 1437 which had failed). Portuguese African ambitions ended, some eighty years later, with the capture of Mazagão in 1514; the gradual decline of the North African domains which followed was underlined by the disastrous defeat of Dom Sebastião and the ﬂower of the nobility at AlcácerQuibir in 1578. Meanwhile, under the stewardship of Prince Henry the Navigator, maritime expansion into the Atlantic had started another imperial venture, which would prove more lasting than the African conquests. At Sagres, in the Algarve, Prince Henry founded an academy dedicated to navigational science. Myth as much as scientiﬁc achievement consolidated the reputation of the school. As one historian has put it, it was rumoured that far to the south on a lonely headland in Portugal, something strange was taking place. Ships were being launched into the Atlantic and were coming back with reports of unknown islands, of a huge coastline and of races of men no one had ever seen before.1\n\nPrince Henry’s programme was ambitious and he managed it with an obsessive attention to detail. The pace he set was relentless;\n\n34\n\nLISBON\n\none achievement spurred him on to the next venture. Nevertheless, the Portuguese did not have it entirely their own way. Traditional enemies were on the trail. The Canary Islands, ﬁrst declared to be Portuguese, were annexed by the Spanish by 1436. Greater success was achieved elsewhere: Madeira, the Azores and the Cape Verde Islands, as we have seen, were secured by the time of Prince Henry’s death in 1460. The ﬁrst expedition along the West African coast had taken place in 1434, led by Gil Eanes. Each year under the guidance of Henry, the ﬂeet penetrated further and further south, engaging on the way in trade and barter. After Prince Henry’s death, some of the exploration was done on a private-enterprise basis, with the state providing naval support, but later, by which time the ﬂeet had reached Senegal and Sierra Leone, the crown once again had taken charge. Just before the accession of King Manuel, Portuguese merchants had already reached the Niger delta and a ﬂourishing trade in gold, ivory, slaves and spices extended along the length of the Gold Coast. The supply of gold became a major source of wealth for the crown, which imposed a rigid control over the trade. The navy was called upon to fend off raids from the Dutch and the English, who were far from content to leave such a prized trade to the Portuguese alone. An unsuccessful attempt to ‘civilize’ the Congo by introducing Portuguese customs and culture was one of the more bizarre imperial experiments of the 1490s. The Congolese king converted to Christianity, donned European dress and styled himself as ‘Dom João I’. Meanwhile in the decade before King Manuel’s accession, the world’s horizons were opened up in both eastward and westward directions. In 1487 Bartolomeu Días rounded the Cape of Good Hope (which he called the ‘Cape of Storms’), raising the prospect of a direct sea route to India and the East Indies. Dom Manuel’s predecessor, King João II, had been prevented from launching an ofﬁcial expedition to India by the scepticism of his advisers in Lisbon; the cortes voted against the proposal. However, King João\n\nTHE IMPERIAL CITY\n\n35\n\nwas not going to be stopped. In 1487, he secretly commissioned Pero da Covilhã and Afonso de Paiva to sail eastwards in search of the fabled kingdom of Prester John. Prester John was believed to be a Christian monarch who ruled in Ethiopia and would be an ally in the struggle against Islam. The alliance was considered crucial to opening up the trade route to India. Covilhã himself made straight for India, arriving a year later, in 1488. He went to Calicut, the centre of the spice trade, and also visited Goa. It was only ﬁve years later, in 1493, that he actually reached Abyssinia.2 Dom Manuel was even more determined than his predecessor to prove the sceptics wrong. He commissioned an expedition of three ships to set sail under the command of Vasco da Gama in 1497. Da Gama followed a westerly course from the Cape Verde Islands, making towards Brazil before he ﬁnally sailed south, around the Cape of Good Hope. In Mozambique, as Camões was famously to celebrate in his Lusiads, Da Gama was well received by the Sultan of Malindi, who provided him with a pilot to cross the Indian Ocean to Calicut. His mission, to secure the valuable spice trade for the Portuguese crown, was stoutly resisted by the Arab traders who had been in control of it over the ages. Da Gama persisted, trying to convince native rulers of the beneﬁts of dealing with the foremost European nation. He returned two years later with half the crew he set sail with and one less vessel. It was said that the masts of the returning ships were sighted from the heights of Sintra entering the Tagus estuary. Da Gama was given a hero’s welcome. King Manuel sent word of his achievement around the courts of Christendom, boasting, in a letter of 12 July 1499, of the acquisitions of trading posts and rare cargoes of spices.3 Such was Dom Manuel’s enthusiasm for further exploration that within a short period he commissioned yet another ﬂeet, this time of 13 ships, to secure the valuable Indian trade. The commander of this considerable ﬂotilla was Pedro Alvares Cabral, a young nobleman. Cabral sailed westwards in early 1500 and reached the\n\n36\n\nLISBON\n\nshores of Brazil, considered to be part of a larger island rather than part of a new continent. In commissioning Cabral’s venture, Dom Manuel was making up for lost ground when Portugal had failed to back the Genoese navigator Christopher Columbus in 1492, giving the Spanish a lead in westward exploration. One of Cabral’s ships was sent back to Lisbon to announce the news of the discovery of this new land, already protected as Portuguese territory under the terms of the Treaty of Tordesillas agreed in 1494 after Columbus’s earlier voyage. The Treaty, brokered by the pope, made everything west of longitude 370 degrees west of the Cape Verde Islands Spanish, and east of it Portuguese, although given the vagaries of contemporary cartography that was not an entirely clear demarcation. Although Cabral lost a number of ships on this expedition, he returned to Lisbon with a valuable haul of spices. The imperial trade was beginning to provide substantial returns for the Portuguese crown. Protection of these overseas interests became the cornerstone of Portuguese foreign policy. The expansion eastwards continued apace — in 1503 the Seychelles were reached; Portuguese ships sailed along the Arabian coast to the Maldive Islands and to the coast of India itself. The Persian Gulf trade was secured by the taking of Ormuz. In 1505 Dom Francisco de Almeida was appointed the ﬁrst viceroy of India. His principal duty was to secure the spice trade in the interests of the Portuguese crown.4 Almeida was succeeded by Afonso de Albuquerque, another one of the great colonial explorers and administrators. There was a certain rivalry between these early captains of India; Albuquerque took the view that the routes eastwards to Malacca needed to be fortiﬁed. He made Goa his principal base. He modelled it on Lisbon and it was soon endowed with ﬁne public buildings and grand churches. Goa became the capital of the Eastern Empire. From earliest times, miscegenation (racial intermarriage) was encouraged, so that the metropolis spawned its own Indo-Portuguese population, whose cultural identity has remained distinct until the\n\nTHE IMPERIAL CITY\n\n37\n\npresent. As Albuquerque understood, the security of Goa meant that Portuguese control of the sea routes to the Far East became a viable proposition. Malacca was reached by 1509, the Indonesian island of Sumatra at the same time. Four years later, in 1513, Jorge Alvares was the ﬁrst Westerner to navigate the Chinese coast. By the middle of the century, Macao off the Pearl Estuary in southern China was leased; 5 by 1571 the Jesuits were established at Nagasaki, and Japan, hitherto closed to foreign commerce, was now opened to Portuguese ships. Dom Manuel attempted to maintain personal control over these expanding colonial territories. While the cascade of his numerous grand titles — Lord of the Seas, of Arabia, Persia and India — symbolized his imperial role, systematic reform of the administration at home was needed to ensure the proper regulation of trade and the accrual of the taxes and duties due to the crown. Cargoes of precious spices arriving on the waterfront at Lisbon needed to be efﬁciently transferred for storage in the royal palaces and warehouses. A price-ﬁxing system, ensuring distribution to every part of Europe, was put in place but needed to be efﬁciently administered. A new class of public ofﬁcials was drawn from the middle class, which in Lisbon included the Jews of the Baixa. They became pivotal in the business of empire, matching the actual achievements of the explorers, who were mainly drawn from the nobility. Their counterparts were employed in the factories abroad, beginning to create a vast body of colonial servants, some of whom did not return to Portugal at all but stayed overseas to found dynasties there. Top posts, such as governorships, remained royal appointments, ensuring that the king kept a personal grip on colonial policy. In some cases the king contracted rather than commissioned an individual to advance his interests. From 1512 Jorge Lopes Bixorda was chosen in this way to forward exploration in Brazil. In the ﬁrst decade of the new century, settlements were made in Pernambuco, Porto Seguro, São Vicente and mostly importantly Bahia (Salvador),\n\n38\n\nLISBON\n\nwhich was eventually to become the colonial capital. Colonization of the littoral was helped by the preference of native Indians to live in the interior forests rather than on the coastal plains. Moreover, the land that was occupied by the Portuguese settlers was found to be fertile and the climate less severe than in Africa. Sugar, cereals and exotic fruit and vegetables began to be cultivated in the hinterland around the ports. Wood was a major trading commodity and was exported to Europe. The search for minerals was not, at ﬁrst, productive. But eventually, when gold was discovered in Minas Gerais, a ﬂourishing culture developed around the old towns with their baroque churches and central squares of stately town houses. In the meantime the slave trade became an important if lamentable source of income, based in the northern city of Bahia, which spawned impressive mercantile mansions. To ensure the steady supply of wealth to the crown (which continued to collect up to 20 per cent tax on all transactions) Dom Manuel sent an annual ﬂotilla to guard the coastal waters where marauders and armed pirates as well as European rivals waited to intercept Portuguese ships on their way to and fro from Europe. Over the period from 1516 to 1530 this policy kept the shipping routes clear and allowed colonization of the interior to proceed without interference. Occasionally even Dom Manuel made a mistake. His personal dislike of Ferdinand Magellan eventually drove Magellan to the Spanish court in 1517, where he found backing for his famous circumnavigation of the globe.6 Dom Manuel took steps to match his status as a leading European monarch by rebuilding his royal residence in Lisbon. He wanted to show, in an ostentatious manner, that Portugal was now the leading nation of Europe, rivalling not only Castile but countries in the north such as Holland and England. It was time to move out of the old palace perched on the Alfama down to the river front, the commercial centre of the thriving port. A considerable space was cleared right on the river’s edge in a square known as Terreiro do Paço (the present-day Praça do Comércio).7 The construction of\n\nTHE IMPERIAL CITY\n\n39\n\nthe new palace — called the Paço da Ribeira — was started in 1500 and completed ﬁve years later in 1505. Records of the building project are incomplete; a ground plan has not survived. However, its somewhat austere appearance, remarked upon at the time by the Venetian secret agent Lunardo Masser in 1504, can be seen from contemporary drawings and etchings. 8 From its inception the palace was understood to be part of a complex of buildings that would symbolize the new, cosmopolitan role that the Portuguese crown played on the world stage. The architect chosen to oversee the building was João de Castilho, who was involved in the building of the Hieronymite monastery at Belém where he had chosen to use the new patriotic, Manueline style. Lack of details in the surviving documents leads us to speculate about the decoration he might have chosen for the palace but it is likely that he would have kept to Renaissance forms and motifs such as the overlay of classical ornament with putti, military trophies and the portrait medallions of Roman emperors. There is a possibility that he may have used the grotteschi or classical ornamentation associated with the rediscovered Golden House of Nero or Domus Aurea in Rome, which remained popular in Portugal until the eighteenth century.9 Whilst the outside appearance was kept fairly simple and even austere, the inside was ﬁlled with luxurious furniture, decorations and paintings in the full cluttered style favoured in courts all over Europe. The scale of the complex was ambitious — with overlapping courtyards, great wings and internal patios forming a dense mass of building. Not only was the palace to serve as the king’s residence, but it had to function as an internationally prominent court where foreign diplomats could be received. Of even greater signiﬁcance was the fact that it had become the administrative centre of the far-ﬂung empire, the focal point for national and commercial interest. The windows of the palace looked right on to the river; a chapel dedicated to St Thomas was installed within. The northern\n\n40\n\nLISBON\n\ncourtyard bordered the Casa da India, the centre for the administration and running of the eastern trade. Nearby was the Casa de Flandres, where the clerks supervised the onward export trade to the Portuguese factory at Antwerp. In other wings of the complex were the higher tribunal and the ﬁnance department. The money exchange and the military arsenal abutted the royal buildings. Within the palace itself, the enormous wealth of the crown was most evident. According to some authorities, Dom Manuel revived an old tradition of commissioning portraits of his ancestors to line the corridors of the antechamber. Chinese ceramics (which the king much admired) and natural specimens from Africa and Asia were part of the royal collection. Although the inventory of the building’s contents made in 1522 is incomplete, Flemish paintings are shown as having been bought, as well as a considerable number of large tapestries. The tapestries, ordered from Tournai, were divided into 26 panels celebrating Vasco da Gama’s discovery of the sea route to India. Precise, detailed instructions were given about the subject matter of each panel. Dom Manuel’s commanding position, as king, was underlined by a scene that showed him giving da Gama his instructions as he set sail from the Tower of Belém. Although some of the historical detail in the panels was drawn from the illuminated manuscripts of the Conquest of India, which was in the royal library, the real purpose of the tapestries was to glorify, in a suitably majestic aesthetic, the achievement of the crown. They were there to bolster the image of the court as the leading centre of Europe to all the diplomats and foreigners who would be in attendance at the Ribeira Palace.10 The move of the royal residence to the river’s edge had considerable signiﬁcance for the future development of the city. The centre of gravity had shifted from the medieval heights to the Baixa or lower ﬂatland on the seaboard of the Tagus. Building spread westwards towards Santos where the king built another palace much admired by Francisco de Holanda.11 The aristocracy and merchant class, anxious to maintain a close proximity to the\n\nTHE IMPERIAL CITY\n\n41\n\nmonarch, began to move into the same area, as did foreigners like Bernard Fechter, an aristocratic Danzig merchant who was in the shipping business. Portuguese ﬁdalgo families such as the Teles de Melo, the Tavoras, the Alegretes and Marialvas all built houses along the river; some were placed in the Chiado just up the hill from Cais do Sodré. Whilst these were the residences of the grand old families — such as the Albuquerques — others belonged to merchants (including foreigners) who had grown afﬂuent as the commercial importance of the city increased. While the physical face of the city was being transformed by its commercial activity, Lisbon still relied on agricultural support from its hinterland to remain fed. Some houses were reputed to be of great luxury, something which could attract royal disapproval if taken beyond the status of the king’s palace. One such residence was the Casa dos Bicos (on the site, as we have seen, of ancient Roman remains), where Brás de Albuquerque, the son of the famous viceroy, is said to have lived in a lavish style. Whether the story was exaggerated or not, a rumour had it that an African queen had a hoard of jewellery stored for her in the house. Similar ostentatious, nouveau riche features began to appear in decorative effects of other houses in the area. Meanwhile, Dom Manuel assembled a court, which in scale and glamour matched the imperial status that he coveted for Portugal. The poet Garcia de Resende records in a ﬂowery eulogy that the royal conclave might number as many as ﬁve thousand. No other court in Christendom, Resende says, can compare in magniﬁcence and cultivation to the Portuguese. The king showered honours upon the aristocratic ﬁdalgo families, whose coats of arms were emblazoned on the ceiling of the Sala dos Brasões, under the royal coat of arms, at Sintra Palace. The nobility and the merchant class of Lisbon, which included foreigners like the Florentine banker Lucas Giraldes, were prospering and began to look for ways of showing off their wealth and status by cultivating a lavish style\n\n42\n\nLISBON\n\nof living, which included patronizing the arts on a grand scale. Dom Manuel set an example by gathering a glittering array of noblemen, commanders of ﬂeets and merchants and mixing them with artists, musicians and writers at court. If the likes of Da Gama and Albuquerque represented the great men of action, Garcia de Resende, Bernadim Ribeiro, Francisco de Holanda and Gil Vicente represented men of letters and the arts. It was a heady mixture that resembled and was meant to resemble the Renaissance courts of the Italian princes. The imitation of the Italian princely style had been introduced by King João II, Dom Manuel’s immediate predecessor. He was a dedicated Italophile and encouraged a more foreign, sophisticated taste to develop among the aristocracy. Andrea Sansovino, the sculptor, was one of the outstanding Italian artists that he lured to Lisbon. Of the artists and writers, Garcia de Resende was probably the most inﬂuential at court.12 He had been the personal conﬁdant of King João II and became a favourite of Dom Manuel as well. Having the ear of two successive monarchs meant that Resende was in the position to set the tone for cultural life. He chose to do so in a highly cultivated, cosmopolitan manner so that the verse and music of the Portuguese court became accepted in the Spanish courts and further aﬁeld in Italy itself. His major literary effort was to gather an anthology of Portuguese verse of the previous hundred years, which, together with Gil Vicente, he produced in the celebrated Cancioneiro Geral. He also wrote, in a romantic vein, the famous trovas or moving verse on the subject of the death of the Spanish courtier Inês de Castro.13 Gil Vicente himself was a less cosmopolitan but no less talented artist than Resende.14 He hailed from the north of Portugal and the typical sound of the cantiga, the popular verse of the villages, was in his ears. If Vicente had had the upper hand in the composition of the Cancioneiro, this more populist, indigenous style might have been more pronounced in the collection. In any case Gil Vicente went on to express himself in many genres — from comic farce to\n\nTHE IMPERIAL CITY\n\n43\n\nserious religious works and allegories in the classical style. His characters too show the sweeping range of his imagination — from recognizably human types to gods and mythological beasts in the classical manner. Sometimes he uses dramatic personiﬁcation — for example in his Triunfo do Inverno (1529) where the serra or mountain of Sintra makes an appearance as a character. Vicente’s artistic impulse was to bring vernacular Portuguese into his dramatic and lyrical structures. That concern with the rhythms of early Portuguese has earned him a place in the canon of literary founders of the national culture. The coincidence of his literary intention and a political belief that the drift to Lisbon and the court was depopulating the countryside and undermining its traditional social structure adds a remarkably modern edge to his artistic expression. Nevertheless, Vicente did not fail to pay due respect to the crown — Sintra is described as a terrestrial paradise which was bestowed upon the kings of Portugal by Solomon himself. The House of Avis is thereby given a status usually reserved for the ancient monarchs of Persia and India. In a court where the pastoral mood was being linked to the philosophical, it is not surprising to ﬁnd a penchant for the Virgilian eclogue, which could encompass the aesthetic with the social. Francisco de Sá de Miranda was the master of this genre. A native of Coimbra, he had travelled to Spain and Italy, meeting the Neapolitan classicist Sannazaro, whose Arcadia (1504) deliberately echoed Virgil, Horace and Ovid.15 Sannazaro’s writing celebrated, in a somewhat idealized way, the pastoral life. His work is replete with shepherds, in idyllic Arcadian settings, accompanied by fauns and nymphs. Sometimes these idealizations were based on marine images, something which reﬂected the maritime ﬂavour of the incipient Portuguese national mood. Sá de Miranda, who was courtly as well as cosmopolitan, took his classics seriously. After a bout in Dom Manuel’s glittering court, he retired in Horatian manner to his country manor in the Minho where he pursued his classical and literary studies, having\n\n44\n\nLISBON\n\na deep empathy with the works of Petrarch and Dante, among others. Like Gil Vicente, Sá de Miranda was also concerned with the independence of Portugal in a court where the Castilian inﬂuence threatened dominance. He also shared Vicente’s unease about the effect of the pull of Lisbon and the court on the traditional social order. There is a strong suggestion in his work that there is wholesomeness about life on the land which contrasts favourably with the artiﬁcial life of the city. Highly stylized and polished, Sá de Miranda also has his place in the development of the national culture. The last of the prominent Manueline court writers was Bernardim Ribeiro.16 Sá de Miranda’s contemporary and friend, Ribeiro was very much the courtly poet, who lived in a tower of the old Moorish castle at Sintra. His ﬁrst works appeared in the Cancioneiro Geral of Resende, but his most celebrated work, Menina e Moça, was only posthumously published in 1554. A contributor to the eclogue form, Ribeiro wrote in Latin, Hebrew and Castilian as well as in Portuguese. His interest in Hebrew and in all aspects of Jewish lore suggests that he may himself have been a new Christian or converted Jew. Adherence to Jewish culture was a dangerous proclivity in an increasingly intolerant religious climate. Ironically, Ribeiro, like the other court poets, lamented the passing of an idealized, rustic existence. His work is permeated by nostalgia for a lost, Arcadian past; there is a deep melancholy that heralds the Portuguese penchant for regret or saudades. But in Ribeiro this lyrical whimsicality is underlined by a philosophical complexity, quite modern in its tone. For Ribeiro is much concerned with questions of identity; as an artist he recognizes a multiplicity of voices within himself and he searches for the ‘true’ expression of his vision. In this questioning Ribeiro appears very much like a predecessor of the modernists, presaging the mood and tone of twentieth-century writers Mario de Sá Carneiro and Fernando Pessoa. Ribeiro seems to be struggling with the concept of the subconscious centuries before it was deﬁned; his\n\nTHE IMPERIAL CITY\n\n45\n\nnovel is written in the female voice with a distinct psychological undertone. Inﬂuenced by the natural setting of the pastoral, the poet is a brooder who tries to make sense"
