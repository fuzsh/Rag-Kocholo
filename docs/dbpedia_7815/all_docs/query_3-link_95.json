        "text": "Relations between Brazil and Portugal go far beyond the historical dimension. There is mutual interest in using the bilateral political capital to increase trade and investment flows and to establish new partnerships in science, technology, culture, and education.\n\nTrade has been growing steadily and has become more balanced. In addition to the 600 Portuguese companies established in Brazil, Portuguese entrepreneurs have shown increasing interest in investing in infrastructure projects in the country. Brazilian investments in Portugal are also increasing. Portugal’s investment stocks in Brazil reached EUR 2.3 billion in June 2018, and the Brazilian investment stocks in Portugal totaled EUR 3.2 billion (5.1% more than in 2017).\n\nPortugal has diversified its political and commercial partnerships. In this context, Brazil plays a relevant role in the future of the economic and trade relations of that country. For this reason, the Portuguese government supports the Free Trade Agreement negotiations between MERCOSUR and the European Union.\n\nPartnerships in science and technology reflect the convergence of the Brazilian interest in professional training and the Portuguese interest in the occupation of its renowned academic and laboratorial structure. Recent initiatives in innovation, nanotechnology, biotechnology, and energy demonstrate the vitality of the technological agenda between the two countries.\n\nHigh-level bilateral meetings are held constantly, which stresses the relevance of bilateral relations for the two countries. The presidents and foreign ministers of Portugal and Brazil participated in the Summit of the Community of Portuguese Language Countries (CPLP), held in Cabo Verde in July 2018. On October 10, 2018, then foreign minister Aloysio Nunes met with his Portuguese counterpart Augusto Santos Silva in Lisbon. In the meeting, which was followed by a press conference, issues concerning the promotion of the Portuguese language, the MERCOSUR-EU agreement, bilateral trade, the agreement to avoid double taxation, air services, manufacturing and purchase of the KC-390 aircraft were addressed.\n\nBilateral trade is growing again, reaching $ 2.31 billion in exchanges in 2018. In this context, Brazil exported a total of $1.45 billion, composed mainly of fuels (26.8%), ores (14.4%), iron and steel (12.5%). National imports totaled $ 858 million, the most important Portuguese products were fats and oils (30.8%), fish (9.7%), and fuels (9%).\n\nThe Brazilian community in Portugal is one of the largest in the world, estimated at around 116,000 people. It is composed mainly of students and liberal professionals. There are Brazilian consular offices in Lisbon, Porto, and Faro.\n\nChronology of Bilateral Relations\n\n2018 – Visit of Minister Aloysio Nunes Ferreira to Portugal (Lisbon, October 9-10)\n\n2017 – Visit to Brasilia of the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Augusto Santos Silva (March 29)\n\n2016 – 12th Brazil–Portugal Summit (Brasilia, November 1)\n\n2016 – Work meeting of Minister Mauro Vieira with the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Portugal, Augusto Santos Silva, on the margins of the Supporting Syria and the Region international conference, in London (February 4)\n\n2015 – Visit to Brasilia, Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo of the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Portugal, Rui Machete (May 4-7)\n\n2014 – Visit of the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Luiz Alberto Figueiredo, to Portugal (March 20)\n\n2013 – The 11th Brazil-Portugal Summit is held (June 10)\n\n2013 – Visit of the President of the Republic, Dilma Rousseff, to Portugal (June 10)\n\n2013 – Visit of the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Antonio de Aguiar Patriota, to Portugal (April 10-11)\n\n2013 – Visit to Brazil of the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Portugal, Paulo Portas (May 22)\n\n2012 – Visit to Brazil of the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Portugal, Paulo Portas (September 3-8)\n\n2012/2013 – Celebration of the \"Year of Brazil in Portugal\" and the \"Year of Portugal in Brazil\".\n\n2011 – Visit to Brazil of the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Portugal, Paulo Portas (July 26-28)\n\n2011 – Visit of President Dilma Rousseff to Portugal (March 29-30)\n\n2011 – Visit to Brazil of the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Portugal, Luís Amado (February 18)\n\n2010 – Visit to Portugal of president Lula to participate in the 10th Brazil-Portugal Summitt (Lisbon, May 19)\n\n2003 – Signing of the Agreement on the Facilitation of People Circulation, the Agreement on Reciprocal Employment of Nationals and the Cooperation Agreement for the Prevention and Repression of the Illicit Trafficking of Migrants\n\n2000 – Signing of the Friendship, Cooperation and Trade Treaty.\n\n1996 – Creation of the Community of Portuguese Speaking Countries (CPLP)\n\n1991 – First Brazil-Portugal Summit\n\n1972 – Delivery of the mortal remains of Emperor Pedro I to Brazil\n\n1953 – Signing of the Friendship and Consultation Treaty\n\n1914 – Elevation of the diplomatic representations of Brazil and Portugal to Embassy status.\n\n1825 – Portugal recognizes the Brazilian independence through the Treaty of Peace and Alliance\n\n1822 – Declaration of the independence of Brazil\n\n1815 – The United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and Algarves is created\n\n1808 –The Portuguese court is transfered to Rio de Janeiro and the ports are opened\n\n1775 – Creation of the Vice-Kingdom of Brazil\n\n1549 – The Governor-General of Brazil is appointed\n\n1532 – Establishment of hereditary captaincies in the Brazilian territory"
