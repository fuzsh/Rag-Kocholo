        "text": "The Royal Arms\n\nFor a little three hundred years, Portugal was ruled by princes from the Burgundian House. Alfonso I, who succeeded his father Henry in 1112, accepted the royal title around 1139. We do not know what Henrys arms looked like. His reign also seemed quite early for the carrying of a coat of arms except that, as a crusader, he could have put a cross on his armor. A coat of arms is attributed to him with a blue cross on a silver field. These arms is, however, only described many centuries after his death for the first time so that there is no certainty about that. [1]\n\nCharter from 1139 of Alfonso Henriques signed Æ po rt ug al rex.\n\nIn the text he calls himself alfonsus portrugalensium rex. (Arquivo da Torre do Tombo).\n\nThe same source responsible for the attribution of the arms with the cross to Henry, also reports on two shields that would have been kept in the monastery of the Holy Cross in Coimbra. The first is attributed to Alfonso I and it is depicted in an engraving as a norman shield with damaged upper edge. According to the caption, there would have been nineteen shields on this, of which seventeen remained. Five are in cross form, the two on the sides with the points inwards. Four smaller ones in the four quarters, also with the points to the heart. Finally, the 10 (8) remaining are on the edge of the shield. The shields are each studded with 13 besants (3,3,3,3,1) and further connected by a cord per bordure, per cross and per saltire\n\nThe second shield would have belonged to Sancho I. It shows five shields connected by a cord. [2]\n\nWhether the shields were actually available or this is just a propaganda item, in any case these shields have disappeared and it can no longer be verified whether they were authentic or not.\n\nNotwithstanding, Sancho Is arms are confirmed by contemporary seal material. A two-sided wax seal has been kept of this monarch on a document dated 1 March 1195. It shows on both sides an elongated shield with round upper corners on which clearly five shields in cruciform form have the same shape as the main shield. Even it remains possible that in the upper corners and in the tip three more such shields have stood. Due to the poor condition in which the seal is, the edge lettering is unreadable. It is also impossible to see whether the plaques are studded with medals or that merely a relief has been applied to them [3]\n\nLater Developments, the Crest.\n\nThe arms did not undergo any significant changes in the following century. The number of castles continued to vary, as did the number of besants on the escutcheons. After the death of King Ferdinand I in 1383, a battle arose for his succession. He himself had appointed his son-in-law John of Castile as his successor, but this was not acceptable to the Portuguese who feared a Castilian domination. Instead, they preferred a bastard son of Peter I (1357-67) John I who could ascend the throne in 1385. John I had previously been the grand master of the Order of Aviso and the royal house of which he was the forefather therefore was named the House of Aviso. On the royal coat of arms, John I added the cross of the Order, a green lily cross, in between the shield and its bordure.\n\nThe Order of Aviso had arisen from a group of high-ranking Portuguese who had formed an army around 1144 to fight the Moors. After conquering Mafra castle in 1162 that they were allowed to keep, King Alfonso, Alfonso turned the group into a spiritual knighthood. It was named after the conquered city of Evora until 1166, when in 1187 it conquered the fortress city of Aviso and received it as a gift. [15]\n\nFrom 1482 to 1485, the improvement of the royal arms was on the agenda of the Cortes that had been called by King John II. Eventually it was decided to leave out the cross of the Order of Aviso as a heraldic anomaly in the future. At the same time, the escutcheons on the sides of the quinas were set upright and the number of castles was set at seven.\n\nA crest appears on the arms for the first time in the coat of arms of the herald Gelre. [16] It is a castle from the bordure of the arms. The arms represented must be attributed to King Ferdinand I (1367-83).[17]\n\nKing John I also introduced a new crest. It occurs for the first time in his coat of arms of the Order of the Golden Fleece, which, however, arose only after the death of John I. It is a golden dragon issuant that can be seen here as the attribute of St. John the Evangelist and thus as an allusion to the name of King John. It is by no means excluded that the crest was taken over from the Castilian House that was extinct in 1367 but which included the grandmother of John I, Beatrix (daughter of King Sancho IV of Castile). Meanwhile, the House of Trastamare, which had come to power in Castile, used the Castle of Castile as a crest. By the way, John I who was also related to the House Aragon, of which King Peter IV (1336-'87) certainly had a dragon issuant as a crest since 1363. Insofar as the Portuguese kings were members of the Order of the Golden Fleece, their arms were also surrounded by the collar of this order.[18]\n\nThe royal arms with the crest still occurred until the middle of the 18th century.\n\nDuring the rule of the Portuguese kings from the House of Bragança (1640-1853) the arms were usually represented with a royal crown only. In the 19th century the arms are sometimes surrounded by a crowned mantle.\n\nAfter the death of King Henry, Cardinal of Lisbon, in 1580, the throne was claimed by King Philip II of Spain who was a cousin of the last kings by his mother Isabella of Portugal. After he had taken Portugal, he added the coat of arms of Portugal to his royal coat of arms. Despite the fact that Spanish rule in Portugal ended in 1640, it remained in the Spanish arms until the reign of King Charles III.\n\nAn achievement was introduced in the 14th century by adding two angels for supporters. These were replaced by dragons by the House of Brangança in the 17th century.\n\nFrom then on the achievement consisted of the ancient Portuguese arms covered with a crowned helmet guardant from which rises a green dragon with red wings. Around the shield is a collar to which the star of the Order of Avis hangs. As supporters serve two dragons as in the crest of which the dexter keeps a banner with the quinas, the sinister a banner of castles of the bordure of the shield. In the 19th century the achievement is sometimes surrounded with a crowned mantle.\n\nIn the French period, the heir to the throne, John VI, took refuge to the Portuguese colony of Brazil where in 1808 he proclaimed an independent kingdom. When he succeeded his mother in Portugal in 1816, Brazil and Portugal were united in a personal union into a commonwealth named Reino Unido de Portugal, Brasil e Algarves (the Algarve was a kingdom that was always a fief of the Portuguese heir to the throne). The arms of this united kingdom remained the ancient arms of Portugal, crowned with a royal crown but placed on a golden armillary sphere on a blue background. The Armillary-sphere is surrounded by a wreath of olive and oak branches.\n\nNa het uitroepen van de republiek op 5 october 1910 werd in 1911 een nieuwe wapencompositie vastge­steld. Deze bestond uit het oude Portugese wapen dat geplaatst was op een gouden armiliaarsfeer waar­achter een rechtopstaande fasces. Rondom de armili­aarsfeer een krans van olijf- en eiketakken. Niet lang daarna verviel de fasces.\n\nWith the disintegration of the United Kingdom in 1822, the Armillary-sphere bearing the Portuguese arms also disappeared. Amongst others on coins from the successors of John VI, the coat of arms of Portugal is depicted on a crowned accolad shield surrounded by a wreath of olive and oak branches.\n\nJust a coat of arms only occurs in the time of the House of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha\n\nAfter the proclamation of the republic on 5 October 1910, a new achievement was adopted in 1911. This consisted of the old Portuguese arms placed on a golden armillary sphere. It symbolized the Portuguese empire as defined in the constitution of 1822:\n\nThe Constitution of 29 of Aprtil 1826 stipulates that the territory of the Kingdom of Portugal and Algarves consists of\n\nARTIGO 2.°\n\nO seu Território o Reino de Portugal e Algarves, e compreende:\n\n§1.° - Na Europa, o Reino de Portugal, que se compõe das Provinciasd do Minho, Trás-os-Montes, Beira, Estremadura, Alentejo, e Reino do Algarve e das Ilhas Adjacentes, Madeira, Porto e Açores.\n\n§ 2.° - Na África Occidental, Bissau e Cacheu; na Costa da Mina, o Forte de S. João Baptista de Ajudá, Angola, Benguela, e suas dependências, Cabinda e Molembo, as Ilhas de Cabo Verde, e as de S. Tomé e Principe, e suas dependências; na Costa Oriental, Moçambique, Rio Sena, Sofala, Inhambane, Quelimane, e as Ilhas de Cabo Delagado.\n\n§ 3.° - Na Ásia, Salsete, Bardez, Goa, Dão, Diu e os Estabelecimentos de Macau e das Ilhas Solor e Timor.\n\nWhich were briefly defined in the constitution of 1911 as the Portuguese territory at at the date of the procla-mation of the Republic:\n\nARTIGO 2.°\n\nO território da Nação Portuguese é o existente à data de proclamção da República. [19]\n\nEven though the Portuguese empire gradually lost all its overseas territories in the 20th century, the last part  Macao - was lost in 1999, this had no consequences for the arms of state in which the Portuguese arms and the symbol for the overseas territories continued to form a whole."
