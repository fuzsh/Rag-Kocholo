It will be seen that the maps, plans, and charts, are illustrated by copious tables, placed in immediate connection with them ; thus rendering the work, for consultation on the topics to which it is devoted, in the highest degree, convenient. The great number of the maps, and the vast amount of matter of a geographical, historical, commercial, and statistical nature, embraced in the volume, together with the convenient mode of arrangement, it is believed will make the work of particular value to all classes of readers. No pains have been spared, to render it correct ; and it is hoped, as well as , believed, that it may be relied upon as an authentic book of reference. Many of the plans and charts in this work are new, and these are thought to be not merely curious and interesting, but important, as they serve to convey accurate impressions, where imperfect or erroneous ones are likely to prevail. As to the utility of works like the present, devoted to general statistics, and embrac- ing exact geographical and historical data, for reference, there can be no doubt. There is no class of works of higher estimation in Europe, and their importance is beginning to be duly appreciated in this country. It is hoped that the present volume may contribute to a more deep conviction of their value, and a more active circulation of statistical knowledge among us. Although the materials for the Tables have been compiled from a great variety of sources, yet there are several works which have been more particularly made use of, and from some of which whole paragraphs or tabular statements have been taken, with little or no modification. Among these works are Balbi's Abrege de Geographic ; Murray's Encyclopaedia of Geography ; Huot's edition of Make Brun's Precis de la Geographic Universelle ; the volumes of the American Almanac and those of the Companion to the British Almanac ; the Encyclopaedia Britannica ; Malchus's Statistik and Staatenkunde ; Macul- loch's Commercial Dictionary, &c. Beside these works, Humboldt's Voyage aux Regions Equinoxiales and Essai sur la Nouvelle Espagne ; Lyell's Principles of Geology ; Balbi's Atlas Etbnographique du Globe ; the Weimar Statistischer Almanach ; Bottin's Almanach du Commerce ; Edward's Quarterly Register ; Niles's Weekly Register ; Hazard's Pennsylvania Register ; Minor's Railroad Journal ; the Missionary Herald ; Darby's Gazetteer of the United States ; Macgregor's British America, &c., have furnished valuable data, or served as useful guides. It is only an act of justice to acknowledge, that the two tables forming the Political Chart of the Globe, are a modification of the elaborate chart of Balbi, to whose other works the compiler is very much indebted on almost every subject treated of in these tables.

Geology has nothing to do with the question of the origin of things, or with the creation of the world ; it merely aims at a careful examination of the records of its former state, inscribed upon its actual surface, and of the evidences of former life, afforded by the organic remains preserved in its strata. History, tradition, and observation show that the earth's surface is undergoing a perpetual change ; the currents of rivers and oceans are forming accumulations of land in some places and washing away the surface in others ; the waters of lakes and seas deposit succes- sive beds of ever-forming rocks ; the summits or flanks of mountains undermined and sapped by rains and frost are plunged into the valley below ; and lofty mountains and deep valleys are formed by the eleva- tion or subsidence of the surface occasioned by earthquakes. Geology goes farther and shows us that these changes have been going on from times anterior to historical or traditional knowledge ; by an examination of the structure and position of the layers, which compose the crust of the earth, it is able to determine their relative ages and the mode of their formation, whether from alluvial accumulations or by deposition from aqueous or igneous solution ; and by studying the ani- mal and vegetable remains which they contain, it proves that the whole or nearly the whole of the present land was once at the bottom of the sea, and has been uplifted by the mighty convulsions of nature. By the term rocks in geology, we understand a great mineral mass, composed of one or several mineral substances, whatever be the state of their aggregation ; thus we include clay and sand in the class of rocks. Those rocks which have been deposited from a liquid, probably water, are said to be of Neptunian origin ; those that bear the marks of having been formed from a state of igneous solution are termed Plutonian or ignigenous rocks. It was long thought that it was vain to look for order or regularity in the composition and arrangement of the great masses of which the crust of the earth is composed, but modern science has proved this notion to be erroneous. These structures may be described as follows : 1. Structure of Mountain Rocks. The kinds of structure occur- ring in mountain rocks are the following ; the compact structure, in which the mass is uniform, and when broken exhibits various fractures, as common compact quartz ; the slaty, in which the rocks split readily into layers, as common roofing slate ; the granular, when the rocks are composed of granular concretions or imperfect crystals, as primitive limestone or statuary marble ; the porphyritic, in which there is a basis or ground with imbedded ciystals, as porphyry ; amygdaloidal, when the basis contains amygdaloidal cavities, whether empty or filled with mine- rals; and conglomerated, when the rock is composed of fragments imbedded in a basis. 2. Structure of Strata and Beds. When a hill is composed of tabular masses of the same kind of rock, extending through the hill, it is said to be stratified, and the tabular masses are called strata ; if tabular masses of a different rock occur these are called beds. Several varieties are discoverable in the structure of individual strata or beds ; thus in some beds, the rock is arranged in columns, as in basalt ; in others in tables as in porphyry ; or in balls as in gi-anite. 3. Structure of Formations. All those rocks which appear to have been formed at the same time, and in similar circumstances, and which agree in position, structure, petrifactions, &c., are said to belong to the same formation. Simple formations are those principally com- posed of one rock, as for example granite ; compound formations of more than one species, as the coal formation, which contains sandstone, . slate, limestone, coal, and ironstone. 4. Structure of Veins. Veins are tabular masses that intersect the strata and beds where they occur. Like the latter they vary in position, being horizontal, or vertical, or more or less inclined. They also vary in dimensions from an inch to several fathoms in breadth, and to several miles in length and depth. Veins appear to have been originally open rents or fissures traversing the strata, which have been filled by an after- process with the mineral matters they now contain. The formations that constitute the crust of the earth are generally arranged and named as follows : 1. Primitive Rocks. The rocks of this class lie under those of the succeeding classes. Countries in which they predominate are in general more rugged and broken than those composed of rocks of the other classes ; the strata of primitive mountains are often highly inclined, a circumstance which contributes to increase the inequalities of the surface of primitive regions. Primitive rocks are of a crystalline nature, and exliibit such characters as indicate formation from a state of solution. They contain no organic remains, and hence are inferred to have been formed before animals and vegetables were called into existence. They abound in metalliferous minerals, and no metal has been met with which does not occur either exclusively or occasionally, in this class of rocks ; gems also occur in great variety. The following species of rocks belong to this class : 1. Granite. 2. Sye- nite. 3. Protogine. 4. Trap. 5. Serpentine. 6. Porphyry. 7. Gneiss. 8. Mica Slate. 9. Clay Slate. 10. Quartz Rock. 11. Limestone. 2. Transition Rocks. The rocks of this class, in the regular suc- cession, rest immediately upon those of the primitive class. Most of them are distinctly stratified, and the strata are frequently vertical, and like those of the primitive class, exhibit the same direction throughout extensive tracts. They are distinguished from primitive rocks by the occurrence of fossil Crustacea, shells, and corals. The extensive deposits of limestone, particularly of the variegated kinds so much prized for ornamental purposes, which they contain ; the fine granites and porphy- ries which they afford, and the ores of lead and copper distributed among them, give them importance in the arts. This class comprises the following rock : 1. Greywacke. 2. Transi- tion Clay Slate. 3. Gneiss and Mica Slate. 4. Quartz Rock. 5. Red Sandstone. 6. Limestone. 7. Glance Coal or Anthracite. 8. Granite. 9. Syenite. 10. Porphyry. 11. Trap. 12. Serpentine. The five last do not differ very materially from the primitive rocks of the same name. 3. Secondary Rocks. This class of rocks rests, in the regular suc- cession, immediately upon those of the transition class. Much of the mineral matter of which they are composed appears to have been depos- ited from a state of mechanical suspension, a circumstance which distin- guishes them in some measure from the transition rocks, in which chem- ical deposits prevail over those of a mechanical nature. They abound in organic remains, and in them we first meet with vertebrated animals. Coal, which occurs in small quantities in transition deposits, is profusely distributed among secondary formations. Of ores the most abundant are those of iron and lead. The rocks of this class are 1. Sandstone. 2. Slate. 3. Limestone. 4. Gypsum. 5. Coal. 6. Granite. 7. Porphyry. 8. Trap. In the primitive and transition classes geologists have not observed any determinate arrangement among the Neptunian deposits, but in this class it has been found to prevail throughout the whole series. The fol- lowing is a sketch of the order of succession beginning with the oldest formation : 1. the old red sandstone ; 2. metalliferous limestone, or car- boniferous limestone ; 3. the great coal formation, which is compound, consisting of sandstone, slate, clay, limestone, coal, and ironstone ; 4. magnesian and alpine limestone ; 5. variegated sandstone, or new red sandstone, comprising, beside the sandstone, beds of marl, with gypsum and rock salt ; 6. the shell limestone ; 7. red ground, composed princi- pally of sandstone, marls, and dolomites with salt and gypsum ; 8. lias and oolite limestones and Jura limestone ; 9. weald clay and Purbeck stone ; 10. chalk formation. 4. Tertiary Rocks. In the regular succession the rocks of this class rest immediately upon the chalk or uppermost member of the secondary class. They are looser in texture than those of that class, yet among them beds occur equally compact with those of the latter. They abound in fossil remains of animals and vegetables, containing many species dif- ferent from those now existing. The rocks of this class are 1. Plastic Clay. 2. Calcaire Grossier or London Clay. 3. Gypsum with Bones. 4. Superior marirve Sandstones and Sands. 5. Upper fresh water Formation. 6. Trachyte. 7. Basalt. 8. Greenstone. 9. Wacke. 10. Amygdaloid. 11. Clinstone. 5. Alluvial Rocks. Under this head are included the various cal- careous deposits, peat, clays, loams, sands, gravels, and rolled masses or holders, which in the regular succession rest upon the newest or upper- most rocks of the tertiary class. Remains of vegetables and animals are of frequent occurrence in this formation. Neither remains of human industry nor human bones have been found in the older alluvia, but skel- etons and bones of quadrupeds abound ; some of these quadrupeds are of extinct species of existing genera as the elephant, rhinoceros, tapir, &c. ; some of species of extinct genera, as the mastodon and megathe- rium ; and others belong to existing species. 6. Volcanic Rocks. These rocky masses which owe their origin to volcanoes, are divided into ancient and modern or extinct and active. Ancient volcanic rocks comprise those connected with volcanoes, that have not been in a state of activity since the commencement of our his- tory. They resemble basalt, and have been sent from the interior of the earth in the form of streams or currents ; they are accompanied by puzzolana, and scoriae similar to those of active volcanoes. Modern volcanic rocks are lavas, scoriae, ashes, sands, &c. ejected from active volcanoes, or from quiescent volcanoes that have been known to be in a state of activity. CAVES. Caves. Caves or Grottoes are cavities of greater or less extent, which have been formed by different causes in the crust of the earth. They are either open to day or are more or less completely concealed in the inte- rior of the earth. External Caves. External caves are those hollows which are open to day, and which occur in the faces of cliffs on the sides of valleys, and in steep cliffs and precipices near the coast, or which hang over the sea. Internal Caves. Internal caves are situated either in the centre of mountains, and without any direct communication with the air, or they are situated in the interior of rocks, but communicate with the external air by means of passages of greater or less extent. Formation of Caves. There are many different modes in which caves are formed. Those in limestone and gypsum appear to have been produced by the dissolving power of water, winch has thus hollowed out the rock, and carried off the dissolved materials. Those in lava and trachyte are produced by the expansive power of gases or vapors, oper- ating upon the rocky mass in a state of fusion, or softened by heat. Others are the effect of rents in the crust of the earth, occasioned by earthquakes. Stalactites and Stalagmites. Stalactites and stalagmites are formed by the filtration of water containing calcareous matter, through the pores or fissures in the roofs of limestone caverns. When the water deposits its lime as it drops from the roof of the cavern, it forms long rode of stone hanging down like icicles, which are called stalactites ; but when the water falls to the floor or trickles down the sides of the cavern, the calca- reous crust formed by its evaporation is called a stalagmite. The masses thus produced, whether pendent from the roofs or rising from the floor, often assume shapes resembling objects of nature or art, and frequently give the cavern a highly brilliant appearance. Contents. Beside the depositions thus formed by the percolation of water, caverns often contain great accumulations of organic matter, plants, shells, and bones. In some cases these organic remains belong to spe- cies or genera now extinct, and very frequently to those now foreign to the region in which the caves are situated. In many cases they are found covered with layers of more recent deposits, or buried under alluvial accumulations. Some caves emit peculiar vapors ; others contain clear springs ; from some there is a continual rush of wind ; some are trav- ersed by currents of water, and others are remarkable for the constant noises heard from them. CAVES OF AMERICA. The cave of Guacharo near Caripe in Venezuela is so called from the vast number of nocturnal birds ofthat name which frequent it, and which are killed in great numbers for their fat. It is 85 feet broad and 77 high at its opening, and preserves these dimensions for the distance of about a quarter of a mile. A river issues from it, but it has never been ex- plored. Near the Duida Mountain in the valley of the Orinoco there is the vast cave of Ataruipe, remarkable as containing the skeletons of an extinct tribe of natives, and urns filled with bones, which have been prepared by drying in the sun, or by being besmeared with resins or some coloring matter. Nickojack cave in the northwestern part of Georgia, which is 50 feet high by 100 wide, and is traversed by a stream of considerable size, has been explored to the distance of three miles. Weyer's cave in Virginia contains a series of large halls extending for the distance of half a mile, and adorned with glittering stalactites. Mammoth Cave in Edmonson county Kentucky, is one of the most extensive known ; it extends 10 or 12 miles, containing a great number of long passages and vast halls; one of these called the chief city is said to be 8 acres in extent, with a roof 100 feet high unsupported by a single pillar ; from this five avenues lead to several other apartments little infe- rior in size. Saltpetre has been manufactured from the soil of this and other caves in this region, and Glauber and Epsom salt are also procured from them. CAVES IN EUROPE. One of the most remarkable of these is Fingal's Cave in the island of Staffa. Its entrance, 66 feet high by 42 wide, leads into a natural hall above 200 feet in length, which is bounded on all sides by regular col- umns of basalt. It was not discovered till 1772. The Peak cavern in the High Peak, near Castleton, Derbyshire, is a huge gulf 42 feet high, and 120 feet long, at the foot of perpendicular cliffs of amazing height. Thence the visiter is conducted through a suc- cession of dark cavernous apartments, and ferried along a subterraneous river, above which the rocks lie so close, that he is obliged to he flat on his face. This tenninates at the distance of about 2,000 feet. Poole's Hole near Buxton is chiefly remarkable for the large masses of stalactite and other petrifactions, with which it is filled. It derives its name fiom its having been the retreat of a famous robber of the 16th century. Baumann's Cave in the Hartz consists of a series of rooms, six in num- ber, having a total length of 760 feet ; and in the same region is Biel's Hole, formed of 15 apartments, of 650 feet in length. Near Grenoble in France is the cave of our Lady of Balme, composed of several apartments, glittering with stalactites, resounding with cascades, and containing a subterranean lake which the visiter crosses by the glare of torches. Among the 1000 caves found in the mountains of the Austrian king- dom of Illyria, the Adelsberg is the most remarkable. It is stated to be five miles in length ; it is a perfect labyrinth, composed of long, steep, and winding passages, terminating in lofty, and spacious apartments, decorated with stalactites of the most fantastic and picturesque groupings, traversed by a boisterous torrent, whose tumultuous roarings are repeated by the echoes of the vaults, and containing great quantities of organic remains. Magdalen's cave in the vicinity is less extensive but more lofty, and its stalactites resemble colossal caryatides, sustaining high arches. The Grotto del Cane or Dog's Cave near Naples is a small aperture, deriving its interest from the exhalations which issue from it, strongly impregnated with carbonic acid gas. It is usual to plunge a dog into this suffocating air for the amusement of visiters ; on being withdrawn, the animal, which had become apparently lifeless, immediately recovers its powers. The cave of Trophonius was celebrated among the ancients for its oracle ; it was a small deep hole in Bceotia, down which the person con- sulting the oracle was obliged to descend, and in which he was sub- jected to a number of fatiguing and terrifying rites ; as he usually returned pale and dejected, it became a proverbial expression in regard to a mel- ancholy person ; He has just come from the cave of Trophonius. The celebrated grotto of Antiparos, in one of the Grecian islands, is a spacious cave 350 feet long, 325 broad, and about 175 high, situated at the bottom of a succession of steep, winding galleries, near 1500 feet be- low the surface of the ground. Colossal pillars of crystallized alabaster rise from the floor to the roof, and stalactites of the same substance hang like huge icicles from the roof, decorated with festoons, curtains, &c., of shining white rock and glittering crystals. NATURAL BRIDGES. Akin to these natural saloons, and often accompanying them, are the natural bridges formed by solid arches stretching over chasms, or by large masses of rock, which having fallen into a cleft have been arrested in the descent by the narrowness of the fissure, and have thus bridged over the otherwise impassable gulf. The most remarkableof these are the natural bridges of Icononzo near Bogota in New Grenada; that of Rumichaca near Pasto; that of the Ay in Cuba ; that of the Mother of God in Mexico ; the celebrated Rock- bridge of Virginia; the natural bridge of Veja, near Verona, &c. The bridges of Icononzo extend over a crevice, at the bottom of which flows the torrent of Summa Paz ; the upper bridge is a natural arch 40 feet broad by 50 long, 318 feet above the stream ; the lower is 64 feet be- neath this, and is formed of three enormous blocks, which have fallen so as to sujjport each other. The Natural Bridge of Virginia is 60 feet wide, 90 long, and 250 high from the bottom of the fissure, over which it extends. MINE RAL S. Arrangement of Minerals. That department of natural history which makes us acquainted with the properties and relations of simple nrinerals is called mineralogy. The arrangement of simple minerals has been a subject of division among mineralogists; some contend for a chemical arrangement, according to which the species are grouped in conformity with their chemical composition and characters ; others rejecting the pure chemical, adopt the mi.Tced method, in wliich the species are arranged and determined according to the conjoined ciicmical and external characters ; while others prefer the natural method, or the arrangement according to the external characters alone.

Almost all springs are impregnated with some foreign ingredients, which render tiiem more agreeable to the taste, and more nutritious than pure rain water. But it is only those waters which contain such a portion of foreign matter as gives them a sensible flavor and a specific action upon the animal economy, to which we give the name of mineral waters. Ingredients of Mineral Waters. The number of metals, earths, acids, and alkalies held in solution by different springs, comprehends almost all known substances ; but the most common and abundant are lime, iron, magnesia, silica, alumine, soda, and the carbonic and sulphu- ric acids. Different Classes of Springs. Mineral Springs are divided in respect of temperature into the cold and the thermal or warm springs. In regard to their ingredients they are commonly divided into four classes; the acidulous or carbonated ; the saline ; the chalybeate or fer- ruginous; and the sulphureous. AciDDLOus Waters. Those waters which contain carbonic acid in its free state, or in combination in excess with a base, are called acid- ulous or carl)onate<l waters. They are distinguished by their slightly acid taste, and by their sparkling when they are poured fi'om one vessel to another ; both of which properties they lose on exposure to the air. Beside carbonic acid they generally contain common salt, and some of the earthy carbonates. To this class of waters belong those of Vichi and Mont d'Or in France; the famous Seltzer waters of Niederselters in Nassau ; the Carlsbad Springs in Bohemia ; the Sweet Springs of Munroe county, Virginia, &.c. Sulphureous Waters. This class of mineral waters contain sulphu- retted hydrogen. They are distinguished by their odor, and by their causing a piece of silver immersed in them to turn black. Beside sul- phuretted hydrogen they contain alkaline and earthy sulphates and muriates, and they may be subdivided into two kinds; those which have sulphuretted hydrogen in a free state, and those in which it is com- bined with an alkali or an earth. The general effects of these waters are stimulant, and they are more often used in the form of a bath than internally. They are service- able in gout and rheumatism, in sprains and bruises, in cutaneous dis- orders, &c. Among the sulphureous springs maybe mentioned those of Aixla Chapelle in Rhenish Prussia; of Enghien in France; of Harrowgate in England ; of Moffat in Scotland ; the White Sulphur Springs of Green- briar county, the Red Sulphur of Giles county, and the Salt Sulphur of Munroe county, Virginia ; the Olympian Springs and the Blue Licks in Kentucky, &c. Chalybeate Waters. These waters contain iron, and are known by their peculiar taste, and by their becoming black when mixed with an infusion of nutgalls. In some the iron is combined with sulphuric acid, in more with carbonic acid ; when this is in excess the waters pos- sess acid properties, and form acidulous chalybeate waters. Chalybeate waters are tonic and aperient, and are used with advantac^e in cases of debility and chronic diseases. Among the most noted springs of this class are those of Tunbridge and Brighton, in England ; of Spa in Belgium ; of Pyrmont in Waldeck ; the fourteen springs of Langen- schwalbach in Nassau ; the springs of Bailston ; Bedford, York,''and Brandywine Springs in Pennsylvania; the Yellow Spring in Ohio, &c. Saline Waters. Saline waters are those which contain the saline ingredients generally found in mineral waters, but which have very little or no iron or sulphuretted hydrogen, and have not carbonic acid in excess. These are subdivided into alkaline, containing alkali in a free state or combined with carbonic acid ; hard waters or those which con- tain carbonate or sulphate of lime ; salt waters, in which salt abounds ; and purgative waters, which contain chiefly sulphate of magnesia or Epsom salt. The most celebrated thermal saline waters are those of Bath, Buxton, and Bristol in England ; of Dunblane and Pitcaithley in Scotland ; Plom- bieresand Bourbon-Lancy in France ; Carlsbad and Teplitz in Germany ; Lucca and St. Julian in Italy ; and the Warm Springs of North Carolina. Among the cold saline springs are those of Saratoga in New York, and of Harodsburg and Grenville in Kentucky ; Epsom and Cheltenham, Leamington, Scarborough, and Malvern, in England ; and Sedlitz and Seidschutz in Bohemia. When there is a considerable quantity of carbonic acid they become more grateful to the taste, and when iron is present, as is sometimes the case, they acquire tonic and stimulant powei\"s. Thermal Waters. This class includes individual springs of all the classes ; a thermal spring being one which, whatever are its chemical properties, possesses a temperature more or less elevated above that of the region in which it is situated, and the changes of which do not coin- cide with those of the external atmosphere. principal thermal waters.

CONTINEXTS. Ortelius and Mercator in the 16lh century conceived the idea of dividing all known lands into tliree great divisions; tlic Old World, comprising Europe, Asia, and Africa; the New World or America; and the Terra Australia or Magellanica, Austral or Southern World; to which Varenius added the Arctic World. At a later period, when the knowledge of the Pacific became more extensive, but the notion of a Southern or Antarctic continent still prevailed, l)e Brosses proposed the names of Australia for the island of New Holland and the surrounding groups; Polynesia, for the groups scattered over the Pacific; and Magellania, for the supposed Southern Continent. Finally geographers have agreed to consider tlie Island World of the Pacific Ocean as a third continent, under the name of Oceania. Adopting this classification, Walckenaer divides the land area of the globe into three great continents called worlds, which are completely separated from each other by the circumfluent ocean: Old World, subdivided into Europe, Asia, and Africa. Nev/ World, subdivided into North America and South America. Maritime World or Oceania, subdivided into Malaysia, Australia, and Polynesia. The whole land area of the globe has been differently estimated ; the most recent and accurate calculations make it 50,200,000 square miles, distributed as follows: Divisions. Old World or Eastern Continent, Europe, . - - - . Asia, . . - - . Africa, . . - . - New World, America, or Western Continent, North America, . - - South America, - . - Maritime World or Oceania, - - . Square Miles, 31,230,000 3,724,000 16,152,000 11,354,000 8,000,000 6,800,000 14,800,000 4,132,000 THE OCEAN. Although the ocean presents the appearance of a barren waste, and in the infancy of human art seems to interpose an impassable barrier to the intercourse of nations whom it separates, yet in the eye of philosophy it is the great reservoir of the vapors which feed the rivers and fertilize the earth; and to civilized man it becomes a high- way connecting the most distant parts of the globe. Its bosom contains an inex- haustible supply of food, and its comparatively equable temperature, renders it a source of refreshing coolness in the burning climates of the tropics, and of kindly warmth in the more inclement regions, remote from the equator. The ocean, with all its inland bays and seas, covers an area of nearly 147,800,000 square miles, or about three fourths of the surface of the globe. Laplace has calcu- lated from the influence of the sun and moon upon our planet, that the depth of the sea cannot exceed 26,500 feet. If we suppose its mean depth to be about two miles, its cubic contents will be nearly 300,000,000 cubic miles. The ocean forms in fact a single mass of fluid surrounding the land, and penetrat- ing the continents with numerous indentures. But geographers generally divide it into five great basins: The Pacific Ocean, 11,000 miles in length from east to west, and 8,000 in breadth, covers an area of 50,000,000 square miles: The Atlantic, 8,600 miles in length from north to south, and from 1,800 to 5,400 in breadth, covers about 25,000,000 square miles: The Indian Ocean, lying between 40 degrees S. and 25 degrees N. Lat., is about 4,500 miles in length and as many in breadth, covering a surface of 17,000,000 square miles: The Antarctic Ocean, lying round the South Pole, and joining the Indian Ocean in the latitude of 40 degrees S., and the Pacific in 50 degrees, embraces an area of about 30,000,000 square miles : The Arctic Ocean surrounds the North Pole, lying to the north of Asia and America, and having a circuit of about 8,400 miles. See the Tables Pacific Ocean, Atlantic Ocean, and Northern and Southern Hemispheres. SEAS. The terms sea, bay, and gulf, are applied with little discrimination to inland branches of the universal ocean, whether like the Baltic and the Mediterranean they penetrate the land by a narrow passage and then spread out into a broad expanse, or like North Sea and the Gulf of Mexico open into the ocean by several mouths, or like the bay of Biscay and the Sea of Bengal present a wide front, imperceptibly mingling their waters with the main sea, from which they are separated by no dis- tinct natural line. Bodies of water completely surrounded by land, like the Caspian Sea, are improperly so called. Those inland seas which open to the west are not influenced by the general oceanic tides, but they have commonly local tides, varying from one to three feet. The most considerable European Seas are the Mediterranean, which is about 2,000 miles in length, and varies in breadth from 100 to 650 miles; its area, including the Adriatic and Archipelago, but exclusive of the Black Sea, is not far from 1,000,000 square miles; river domain about 1,500,000: The Black Sea, of which the Sea of Azoph is merely a bay, receives the waters of a surface of about 950,000 square miles ; its waters are tlierefore quite fresh, and have a constant efflux through the Dardanelles: The North Sea or German Ocean, is quite open on the north, and also communi- cates with the ocean on the south ; it is traversed by immense sand-banks ; area about 160,000 square miles: The Baltic Sea, like the Black Sea, has an efflux current, and receives the di-ain of a surface of about 800,000 square miles ; the tides are perceptible only as far as the Sound, and the Great, and Little Belt, and the waters are nearly fresh ; the area of the Baltic, inclusive of the Skagerac, Cattegat, and its interior gulfs, is not less than 175,000 square miles; though the surface covered by the Baltic in a narrower sense is somewhat leas than 100,000 square miles : The Great Mediterranean of the American continent is an open sea, having nu- merous entrances from the east between the West India Islands, and the main land; it is formed by the coasts of the continent sweeping round in a circular form from the Capes of Florida to the Gulf of Paria in South America, and has been appro- priately styled the Columbian Sea; the peninsula of Yucatan divides into two great branches, the Caribbean Sea, and the Gulf of Mexico, which together cover a sur- face of about 1,400,000 square miles. It is probably destined to be the theatre of a more active and extensive commerce, the seat of freer communities, and, let us hope, of a higher and more perfect civilization, than even the Mediterranean of the eastern continent. LAKES. A lake is an inland body of water not connected with the ocean or any of its branches. In regard to the position of their beds, there are two classes of lakes; those formed in deep hollows among the mountains, and fed by springs or torrents; and those formed in level countries by the surplus water of rivers or in consequence of the want of a general declivity in the ground. Thus there is a system of the for- mer class in the great Alpine girdle of the old continent, including the lakes of the Pyrenees, the Alps, the Apennines, and those of the Taurus, Caucasus, and Altaic chains; to the north of this great mountain band are the numerous lakes of the vast northern plain of Europe and Asia, belonging to the latter class, and comprising the numerous lakes of Prussia, Sweden, Russia, and Siberia; to the south of die moun- tainous zone, in Africa for instance, the lakes are few. There is a similar disposition in the New World; a chain of mountain lakes accompanies the Andes through their whole course, including Titicaca, Nicaragua, Chapala, the small lakes of the Mexican Valley, Timpanogos, &c., and while the great eastern plains of South America are nearly destitute of them, the regions around the Hudson contain an astonishing number of lakes, corresponding in num- ber, character, and geographical situation to those which skirt the shores of the Baltic and the Frozen Ocean. Another division of lakes is founded upon the manner in which they receive or discharge their waters, and in this point of view they form four classes: 1. Those which receive streams of water and have an outlet to the ocean are the most numer- ous and extensive: 2. Those which receive rivers, without having any visible outlet, such as the Caspian Sea, Lake Tchad, in the interior of Africa, &c.: 3. Those which receive no running water, but have an outlet; these are fed by springs: 4. Those which neither receive running water, nor have an outlet: these are small. Lakes are also distinguished according to the quality of their water into saline and fresh ; those which have no outlet, and those situated in a region, whose soil is im- pregnated with salt, are of the latter class.

The Eastern and Western continents, and New Holland, are, strictly speaking, three great islands, washed on all sides by the ocean; but setting these aside under the name of continents, we generally restrict the application of the term islands to smaller masses of land lying in the midst of seas or lakes. Islands are sometimes detached, oftener collected into groups or archipelagos; in some cases they are little more than low sand-banks, ledges of rocks, or coral reefs, and in others rising to a considerable elevation above the surface of the water, and spreading to a considerable extent, they present in miniature all the features of the continents, hills, valleys, plains, lakes, streams, &c. They are often the summits of submarine mountainous-chains, and as such are in- timately connected with each other, and with the neighboring continent; and in general they are considered as appendages to the nearest main-land. Many of them are evidently tlie production of submarine volcanoes, which heave them up from the bosom of the waters, and fertilize their surface by the matter ejected from their bowels. The largest islands of the globe are Borneo, New Guinea or Papuasia, Greenland (1), Sumatra, Madagascar, Niphon, Cuba, Great Britain, &c. MOUNTAI*^S Uses of Mooktaihs. In the benevolent purposes of Providence these great elevations of the earth's surface jire made subservient to the well being of the animal creation. Ris- ing into regions of perpetual ice, they serve in hot climates to cool the burning air, and to fan the panting inhabitants with refreshing breezes ; they are the reservoirs of rivers, sup- plying their shrinking streams in the dry seasons of the lower countries with copious tor- rents^iw^ the melting snows; they are the storehouses of the richest minerals; they increas^the surface of the earth, and give diversity and richness to its vegetable products; and often have they not served to stay the march of the conqueror, and to shelter in their fasnesses the last champions of freedom ! DimJbbution of Mountains. Single detached elevations of great height are rare; but n|»o4ntains are generally found in elevated bands, consisting either of one central chain, j«ith branches running off at right angles, or of several chains or ridges running parallal 10 each otlM^ ; and in both cases often accompanied by subordinate chains, of a smaller elevation* — A group of mounUiins is a collection of several chains ; a system of mounCaUis is a C(Jte«tion of groups. The most general view of mountain systems shows us a vjst mountainous zone almost completely surrounding the basin of the Great Pacific Ocean i; rising frjun the southern e.\\tremityof South America, the lofty rampart of the AndHa.e^tcnds al»i*g the western coast of the American continent at no great distance from the sea, through a length of 9,000 miles, and sweeping round in a semicircle through Asia, a continuation of ..Uie same great barrier, under the various names of the Altai, Himalaya, and Taurus, crowns the summit of the declivity down which the great Asiatic rivers descend into the jctan. The Caucasus, the Carpathian, and Alpine chains are a'pro- longa^n through £urope of this colossal girdle. MoyjiiTAiNs oF-A^EHicA. All the mountains of the New World may be classed in seven systemi) three of which are in South America, two in North America, and two in the great Archipelago^,' which belong to this continent. South' America consists of one vast expanse of little elevation, bounded on the west by the lojfg chains ofthe Andes which stretch uninterruptedly from Cape Horn to the Gulf of Paria^ and contain some summits little inferior in height to the loftiest colossuses of the Himalaya Mountain!?. These mountains are remarkable for the number, height, and terri- ble activity of their volcanic vents. In Bolivia and Peru the Andes extend in two prin- cipal cMins, but to the north of Popayan they divide into three chains of which the eastern and (fflncipal curves round the northern coast of Venezuela, forming the Sierra of Merida or Cardccas ; the central chain or Quindiu Mountains separate the valleys ofthe Cauca and the iMaadalena, and the western chain or Choco Mountains sink down in the northwestern cornerw New Grenada.

Parts of it are known under the local names of Sierra of Parima, Sierra of Pacaraina, and Sierra of Tumucumaque. The highest known summit is the Peak of Duida, 8,320 feet high. The Brazilian Mountains are another series of low ridges extending over a great por- tion of Brazil. The Serra do Mar runs along the coast from Cape St. Roque nearly to the Banda Oriental. The Serra do Espinhano stretches from the San Francisco, Lat. 10\", to the Uruguay, Lat. 28\". The Serra dos Vertentes separates the valleys of the San Francisco and the Tocantin, and winding round to the west divides the confluents of the Amazon from those of the Parana. The highest summit, Itacolumi, is only 6,000 feet high. North America is traversed by one great mountainous system which may be consid- ered a prolongation of the Andes. Riging in the Isthmus of Panama, through which it extends under the name of the Cordillera of Veragua, it runs through Central Amer- ica, where it is called the Cordillera of Guatemala, and is distinguished by the great number of its volcanoes, into Mexico. Here it is called the Mexican Cordillera, Sierra Madre, Sierra de los Mimbies, &c., and passes into the United States under the name of Rocky Mountains, a designation, whith the principal chain retains till it sinks down and disappears in about Lat. 02\". A mofe westerly ridge, which may be called the Mari- time Chain, extends through California, Oregon District, and Russian America. The Ozark or Masserne Mountains of Arkansaw are'^a spur of this great mountain system.

We are less accurately acquainted with the courses, connections, and heights of the mountainous chains of Asia, but with our present knowledge of them, we may compre- hend them all in four principal systems. These are the great Eastern System, comprising the Himalaya, Altaic, Teenshan, and Kwanlun groups, and the mountains of Japan ; the Uralian Mountains ; the Tauro-Caucasian System, and the Hindoo System. The Oroup of the Altai surrounus the sources of the Irtish and Yenissei, and extending : into the east under the names of the Sayanian, Upper Kentai, Daourian, and Jablon- noikhiehet Mountains, advances along the Sea of Okotsk. The Teenshan Oroup is in about 42\" N. Lat. Its western prolongation is the Mustag. A transverse chain, called the Beloor Tag, running from north to south, connects this group with the Kwanlun ; this latter chain runs parallel to the Teenshan in Lat. 35, into the Chinese province of Shensi. The Hindoo kho is its western prolongation. ( The Himalaya Mountains separate the valleys of Cashmere and Nepaul, from Bootan and Thibet, and contain the most lofty summits in the known world. | //imakyas— Chamoulari ft. 28,100 ?

Plains. We give the name of plains to extensive tracts, whose sur- face is in the main level or but slightly broken by gently swelhng and subsiding eminences, or by inconsiderable and almost imperceptible de- pressions. They are found at all degrees of elevation above the sea and of every stage of fertility, from the inexhaustible fecunditj' of the Egyptian Delta to the irreclaimable sterility of the sandy deserts. America contains several vast plains. One of these, which Balbi pro- poses to call the Mississippi-Mackenzie, extends from the shores of the Arctic Sea to those of the gulf of Mexico, and from the Rocky Mountains to the Alleghanies ; it embraces the valleys of the Mississippi, the St. Lawrence, the Nelson, the Churchill, and most of those of the Missouri, the Mackenzie, and the Coppermine, including an area of 3,240,000 square miles. Another great plain comprises the central part of South America, extending over an area of 3,000,000 square miles, including more than half of 13razil, the southern part of New Grenada, the eastern part of the Equator and Peru, and the northern part of Bolivia ; its moist and warm climate, clothes it with a pomp and vigor of vegetation nowhere equalled. The plain of the Plata extending from the mountains of Bra- zil to the Strait of Magellan, comprehends the whole of the southern part of South America east of the Andes, with an area of 1,620,000 square miles. The plain of the Orinoco, including the region extending from the Caquetato the mouths of the Orinoco, has an area of 350,000 square miles. These two are distinguished from the great plain of the Amazons by the absence of trees and the wide grassy tracts which cover their surface. The most extensive plain on the surface of the globe is the vast tract stretching from the shores of the North Sea to the Pacific Ocean, and broken only by the Ural Mountains. It has an average breadth of 1400 miles, and a length of 6,000, comprehending an area of 6,500,000 square miles. It comprises large heaths, sandy deserts, and steppes, or open pastures, but has few considerable forests. Table Lands. Table-lands or Plateaux are elevated plains, forming in some instances the nucleus of the great masses of land, above the gen- eral surface of which they rise. They often contain chains of mountains, plains, and valleys, and their declivities present to the inhabitants of the low countries at their feet the appearance of a long chain of mountains. The whole of Central Africa is supposed to be a vast table-land descend- uig by successive terraces towards the coasts on all sides. The interior of Asia is composed of a succession of these lofty plains, among which the following are the most remarkable : the Persian table- land comprises nearly all the country south of the Caspian and Black seas, from Asia Minor to the Indus, including Armenia, Georgia, Curdistan, Persia, Afghanistan, &c. ; this region is from 2,500 to 6,000 feet above the sea: Zungaria and the adjacent region is from 2,000 to 2,500 high ; Mongolia lies at an elevation of from 8,000 to 12,000 feet, and Thibet is still more elevated. There are some masses of this kind in Europe but of less extent ; the central part of Spain is a lofty plain of about 2,200 feet in height, and be- tween the Alps and the Jura is the Swiss table-land about 3,500 feet high. One of the most remarkable of these masses is the Mexican table-land not less remarkable for its extent than its elevation. On the eastern and western coasts are low countries, from which on journeying into the inte- rior you immediately begin to ascend, climbing to all appearance a suc- cession of lofty mountains. But the whole interior is in fact thus raised into the air from 4,000 to 8,000 feet. This conformation of the country has most important moral and physical results ; for while it gives to the table-land, on which the population is chiefly concentrated, a mild, tem- perate, and healthy climate, unknown in the burning and deadly tracts of low country into which a day's journey may carry the traveller, it also shuts out the former from an easy communication with the sea, and thus deprives it of ready access to a market for its agricultural productions. Carriages pass without difficulty on the summit of the table-land for hun- dreds of miles from Mexico to Santa Fe, but can descend to the eastern and western coasts only at a few points. A large part of New Grenada and the Equator is situated at an eleva- tion of from 5,000 to 9,000 feet, and contains populous cities, such as Quito, Bogota, &c., 8,000 or 10,000 feet above the level of the sea. Another of these table-lands includes an extensive tract in Peru, Boli- via, and the States of the Plata, stretching from 6° to 26\"^ S. Lat. and raised above the sea to the height of from 4,000 to 10,000, and even 12,000 feet. These three great plateaux were each the centre of a native American civilization at the time of the discovery of the continent. Deserts. Deserts are tracts of greater or less extent utterly sterile, and incapable of supporting vegetable or animal life. — These frightful solitudes, destitute of water or verdure, present plains of sand or shingle, interspersed with not less barren and arid heights, and exhibiting no in- dications of animated beings. In some parched by a scorching sun, burning winds, charged with poisonous exhalations, and columns of moving sands add to the horrors of the scene. Even these desert regions are, however, generally interspersed here and there with little fertile tracts rising like green islands out of the sandy ocean, well- watered and well- wooded, and affording shade and refreshment to the exhausted traveller; these spots are called oases or wadies. The most extensive of these desert tracts, is the great sandy zone which stretches from the Atlantic Ocean across Africa and Central Asia nearly to the Pacific Ocean, or to 120 E. Lon. It includes nearly one fourth of the two continents, through which it passes, covering an area of 6,.500,000 square miles. Sahara or the Great Desert of Africa, Arabia, and the Pla- teaux of Persia and Thibet, present the most continued surface of sand. America is characterised by an almost entire absence of deserts, and it has been estimated that, although its surface is less than half of that of the Old World in extent, it contains at least an equal quantity of useful soil. The only true sandy deserts are that of Atacama, a belt of sand extending with considerable interruptions fi-om the northern part of Peru to Copiapo in Chili, a distance of about 1700 miles, with a width of from 10 to 50 ; and the desert of Pernambuco which is also an arid waste of sand ; but other tracts to which this name has been applied are, though incapable of culture, yet not destitute of vegetation. Steppes, Pampas, Karroos, &-c. The surface of the earth contains several extensive tracts, which, although possessing a productive soil, are yet in their natural state entirely destitute of trees, and in general spread out into wide unbroken plains. Such are the extensive open pastures of the great plain of northern Europe and Asia, called steppes, the jun- gles of India, the karroos of Southern Africa, the prairies of North Amer- ica, the llanos and pampas of South America, and the heaths of Europe. While the whole Atlantic slope of North America south of the St. Lawrence, and the region west of the Rocky Mountains were naturally covered with a dense forest, the great plain before described formed what Darby calls the grassy or prairie section, consisting chiefly of un- wooded, but fertile plains, covered with a rich herbage and affording immense natural pastures, though occasionally degenerating into bare and arid wastes. An extensive tract of several hundred miles in width on the east of the Rocky Mountains approaches to the character of a desert, and much of the northern part of the continent exhibits the same features. In Venezuela the wide plains called llanos are for half the year cov- ered with a luxuriant verdure, but during the dry season become parched and burned so as to resemble sterile wildernesses. The pampas, which occupy a large part of the plain of the Plata, are dotted here and there with palm groves, and in some places overgrown with thistles or incrusted with salt ; but for the most part are covered with rich herbage, feeding countless herds of cattle. Some of the steppes of Asia are merely sandy plains, bearing a few stunted shrubs and exhibiting only occasional spots of verdure ; others are covered with herbage, and afford good pasturage for the numerous herds of the pastoral tribes that roam through them ; others bear saline and succulent plants, or are coated with saline incrustations. The karroos of Southern Africa are tracts of arid clay-land, bearing some succulent plants, but the zneagre vegetation which clothes them with green and adorns them with flowers during the rainy season, disap- pears during the heats of summer, giving the country the aspect of a parched and barren plain. The jungles of India are tracts covered with dense and impenetrable masses of vegetation crowded and twined together, consisting of thorny and prickly shrubs of every size and shape, canes, which in a few months shoot up to the height of sixty feet, and creeping plants and bushes, and forming impassable barriers even to an army. Valleys. Valleys are the spaces lying between opposite ridges of mountains or hills, and their lowest part is commonly the bed of some torrent or river, which has its sources in the higher grounds. Those between high mountains are in general narrow and long, resembling large clefts or fissures. Some valleys lying between opposite mountainous chains are of great extent, comprising whole provinces or countries. Such are the great val- leys of the Ganges in Asia, and of the Mississippi in North America. Some are situated far above the level of the Ocean, although sunk deep below that of the adjoining country. — Such are that of Chota near Quito which is 5,000 feet deep, and that of Rio Catacu in Peru, which is 4,000. Boo- tan, Thibet, and Nepaul, are deep valleys of Asia. Those of the Po, of Savoy, the Tyrol, &c. in Europe, are of less extent. TABULAR VIEWS, ILLUSTRATING THE CHARACTER, FORMATION, HEIGHT, ice. OF CATARACTS. When a river bed suddenly changes its level, so that the stream is plunged down a considerable distance, a cataract, cascade, or fall is formed ; when the change of the level is less abrupt, and the inclination is yet such as to render the current violent and broken, we give it the name of rapids. Falls are generally formed by the descent of rivers or streams from primitive mountains to secondary countries; compact, durable rocks are requisite for producing a j)ermanent effect of this kind ; such are the cataracts of the Nile, the Ganges, and other rivers. Some cataracts, like those of Tunguska in Siberia, have gradually lost their elevation by the wearing away of the rocks over which they are precipitated, and have become merely rapids, and the same effect is pro- duced in others by the gradual filling up of the gulf into which they plunge. \" Cataracts,\" says Lamouroux, \" must have been both more numerous and more lofty in the ancient world than they are at present. They are daily diminished both in number and height by the action of the universal leveller, time, and perhaps in some future age the cataracts of the Nile and the Ganges, the Falls of Niagara, and the cascades of Tequendama will be looked upon as a fiction of poetry.\" The Falls of Niagara have been found to be gradually receding from lake Ontario ; this great body of water is hurled over a ledge of hard limestone, below which is a layer of soft shale, which decays and crum- bles away, so that the superincumbent limestone is lefl without a foun- dation, and falls from time to time in large masses. The bed of the river below tlie falls is strewed over with the huge fragments, tliat have been thus detached and plunged into the abyss. Within the last forty years the falls have receded nearly fifty yards, and there is little doubt that they were once at Queenstown, about seven miles below their actual site. Should they continue to recede at the rate above stated or a little more than one yard annually, it will be 30,000 years before they reach Lake Erie. Some of the most beautiful cataracts have been created, at least in part, by human labor. The celebrated cascata del marmore at Terni, \"which,\" says Byron, \" is worth all the cascades and torrents of Switz- erland put together,\" is attributed to a work of Curius Dentatus (270 B. C), who caused the rock to be cut through for the purpose of draining the marshes, and making an oudet for the Velino. Some cataracts owe their celebrity to the vast volume of water, which is poured in an unbroken sheet over a great descent, as with Niagara; others are remarkable only for the vast height from which the^ fall, whe- ther they plunge down the abyss at a single leap, or dash themselves successively from shelf to shelf till they reach the bottom of the preci- pice ; some falling in a small riband-like current over the edge of the rock, are dispersed before they reach the ground into thin spray, forming glittering showers of brilliants, or gaudy rainbows : others driven for- ward by the force of the current, fall over in a continuous arch, between which and the bottom of the ledge from which they have fallen, the vis- iter may pass; and yet others are visited and admired chiefly for the pic- turesque beauties of the glen, the grandeur of the precipices, or the gloomy horrors of the deep chasms which sun-ound them. \"If it be difficult,\" says Humboldt ( Vues des CordilUres), \"to describe the beauties of cataracts, it is still more difficult to make them felt by the aid of the pencil. The impression they leave on the mind of the ob- server depends on the occurrence of a variety of circumstances. The volume of water must be proportioned to the height of the fall, and the scenery around must wear a wild and romantic aspect. The Pissevache and the Staubbach in Switzerland are lofty, but their masses of water are inconsiderable ; the Niagara and the falls of the Rhine on the contrary furnish an enormous column of water, but the height even of the former does not exceed 170 feet. A cataract surrounded by hills merely, pro- duces much less effect, than the waterfall which rushes into the deep and narrow valleys of the Alps, and still more of the Andes. Independ- ent of the height and body of the column of water, the figure of the landscape, and the aspect of the rocks, it is the luxuriant form of the trees and herbaceous plants, their distribution into groups or scattered thick- ets, the contrasts of the craggy precipices to the freshness of the vege- tation, which give a peculiar character to these grand scenes of nature. The Niagara, which in a northern sky is in the region of oaks and pines, would be still more beautiful, were its drapery composed of heli- conias, palms, and arborescent ferns.\" TABLE OF REMARKABLE FALLS IN EUROPE.

Thus the little stream of Ache in Bavaria throws itself over an elevation of 2,000 feet, and there is said to be a cascade of equal height in the island of Nukahiva. REMARKABLE FALLS OF ASIA, &c. Some of the most remarkable cataracts of Asia, with which we are acquainted are the fall of Garispa in the Indian Ghauts, 1000 feet high ; the Birra Chuki 100 feet, and the Gunga Chuki 200 feet in the Cauvery ; and those of Bilohi 400, Chachai 362, Tonse 200, and Booti 400 feet in height in Bundelcund. There are many beautiful and magnificent cas- cades in the Ghauts, and the Ganges, Indus, and Burrampootra exhibit many falls which have not been described. The cataracts of the Nile, so much celebrated by the ancients, have an elevation of not more than ten or twelve feet. RIVERS. Rivers. Rivers are natural drains which convey to the sea that portion of the waters falling upon the earth, tluit does not pass off by evaporation, or go to nourish organic bodies. They invariably occupy the lowest parts of the surface of the dis- tricts which they drain, and these districts are called their basins or valleys. Basins. The basin is bounded by high lands which are sometimes mountainous; the water descending from these collects into brooks, the brooks unite into rivulets, the rivulets united form the main trunk or river, which conveys the waters of the whole to the sea. All these descend over inclined planes, so that the lowest point of each brook, is that where it joins the rivulet, of each rivulet that where it joins the main stream, and of the whole system, that where the main river falls into the sea. These basins form natural divisions of the earth's surface. Dimensions. In estimating the actual dimensions of a river it is necessary to determine its length and depth, the area of its basin, and the amount of its annual discharge of waters. In estimating its length we may trace its windings by its channel from its source to its mouth, or compute only its principal detours; and it is this dift'erent manner of estimating the length of the river-courses, added to other causes of error, that leads to so many apparently inconsistent statements in this respect. The table given below states the length obtained by allowing only for the principal bends, and it is often necessary to add from one fourth to one sixth, to give the entire length of the channel.

Influence of Elevation upon Temperature. As climate is chiefly influenced by distance from the equator, and elevation above the sea, in ascending high mountains we pass through diflferent zones of vegetation, answering to the dif- ferent climates of the successive elevations reached, until we arrive at tlie snow-line or zone of perpetual snow, the frigid zone of the mountain. The following table of the ratio of decreasing temperature at different altitudes, in the equatorial zone between 0 degrees and 10 degrees Lat., and in the temperate zone between 45 degrees and 47 degrees, shows that the mean decrease is about 1 degree for 340 feet. In the first thousand yards it is 1 degree for 310 feet; in the second 1 degree for 524 feet, but in the third and fourth stages of ascent the fall of temper- ature is more rapid. Height.

The elevation at which constant frost takes place is called the Snow-Line or line of perpetual congelation. The limit of perpetual snow does not exactly coincide with the height at which the temperature is equal to 32 degrees of Fahrenheit. In the torrid zone perpetual snow commences at an elevation where the mean temperature is a little above the freezing point, the snow maintaining its situation because it falls as fast as it melts ; but in the temperate zone, where the quantity of aqueous vapor is less, and the days of summer much longer, it commences only at an elevation, at which the mean temperature is five degrees below the freezing point.

The greatest variety of vegetation in a given space is displayed in ascending a lofty mountain of the torrid zone. Under the burning sun of the regions at its foot, ananas and plantains grow profusely; oranges and limes occur a little higher up; then succeed fields of maize and luxuriant wheat, and still higher com- mences the series of plants found in the temperate zone. On the summits of temperate regions the variety is rather less, but the change is not less striking. We may begin the ascent of the Alps, for instance, in the midst of warm vineyards, and pass through a succession of oaks, sweet chestnuts, and beeches, till we gain the elevation of the more hardy pines and stunted birches, and tread on pastures, fringed by borders of perpetual snow. At the elevation of 1,950 feet the vine disappears, and at 1,000 feet high the sweet chestnuts cease to thrive ; 1,000 feet farther, and the oak is unable to maintain itself ; the birch ceases to grow at an elevation of 4,680, and the spruce fir at the height of 5,900 feet, beyond which no tree appears. The rhododendron ferrugineum then covers immense tracts to the height of 7,800 feet, and the herbaceous willow creeps two or three hundred feet higher, accompanied by a few saxifrages, gentians, and grasses, while the lichens and mosses struggle up to the imperishable barrier of eter- nal snow.

The limitation of groups of distinct species of animals to regions separated from the rest of the globe by certain natural barriers, has long been recognised by naturalists as a general law in the geographical distribution of organic beings. The discovery of America revealed a race of indigenous quadrupeds, all dissimilar from those previously known in the Old World; the elephant, tlie rhinoceros, the hippopotamus, the camelopard, the camel, the drome- dary, the buffalo, the horse, the ass, the lion, the tiger, the apes, the baboons, and numerous other species of mammalia, were nowhere met with on the new continent ; while in the old, the American species of the same great class — the tapir, the lama, the pecari, the jaguar, the couguar, the agouti, the paca, the coati, and the sloth — had never been seen. Naturalists have accordingly divided the earth into eleven zoological re- gions, or provinces, each of which is the residence of a distinct set of quad- rupeds : 1. The first of these provinces is the Ardfic region, which contains the white bear, the rein deer, the Arctic fo.x, and other tribes common to both of the great continents. Tlie communication established between the shores of the Old and New World by means of ice, renders the passage from one to the other practicable to such animals as are fitted to endure the intense cold of this region : 2. The temperate regions of the eastern continent form a second distinct zoological province, over which the same tribes of animals are spread from the Atlantic to the Pacific : 3. But the quadrupeds which inhabit the temperate zone of North America, the bison, the musk ox, the moose, &c., are peculiar tribes : 4. The intertropical parts of Asia are inhabited by the tiger, the Asiatic elephant, the camel, the wild ass, the djiggatai, the grunting ox, the musk, &c. : 5. While the torrid zone of Africa is characterised by the lion, the African elephant, the rhinoceros, the hippopotamus, &c. : 6. And that of America is inhabited by the lama, the vicugna, the jaguar, the whole family of sloths, &c. : 7. Malaysia or the Indian Archipelago approximates in regard to its native quadrupeds nearer to Africa than to Asia, containing the hippopotamus, wliich does not exist in the Asiatic rivers, the rhinoceros, the tapir, &c. : 8. The southern extremity of Africa, separated from the northern temperate zone by "
