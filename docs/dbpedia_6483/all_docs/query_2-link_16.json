        "text": "The November midterm results are (mostly) in. How do they compare to our 2022 polling?\n\nIn this ret­ro­spec­tive, NPI’s founder and exec­u­tive direc­tor assess­es what our 2022 elec­toral poll find­ings were able to tell us about state and coun­ty-lev­el races on the midterms ballot.\n\nJulie Anderson concedes 2022 Secretary of State contest to incumbent Steve Hobbs\n\nAnder­son­’s deci­sion to run against a Demo­c­ra­t­ic incum­bent for a par­ti­san office as an unaf­fil­i­at­ed can­di­date iron­i­cal­ly left her elec­toral­ly reliant on fick­le, ultra MAGA Repub­li­can vot­ers who want vote at home abol­ished, cir­cu­late con­spir­a­cy the­o­ries, and believe that the 2020 pres­i­den­tial elec­tion was not fair­ly conducted.\n\nPatty Murray, Kim Schrier, Steve Hobbs improve in second count of 2022 midterms\n\nThe Wash­ing­ton State Demo­c­ra­t­ic Par­ty’s three high­est pro­file 2022 can­di­dates each man­aged to build on their strong Elec­tion Night per­for­mance on the sec­ond day of count­ing, putting more dis­tance between them­selves and their opponents.\n\nSteve Hobbs leads Julie Anderson for Secretary of State, write-in vote totals 3%+\n\nIn Elec­tion Night returns, Demo­c­ra­t­ic incum­bent Steve Hobbs had 49.97% — just shy of the mag­ic num­ber of fifty — while chal­lenger Julie Ander­son, the Pierce Coun­ty Audi­tor, had 46.92%. Anoth­er 3.1% of votes cast were for a write-in can­di­date, pre­sum­ably Repub­li­can Brad Klip­pert, who was endorsed by the Wash­ing­ton State Repub­li­can Party.\n\nBrad Klippert’s write-in candidacy could give Steve Hobbs the edge over Julie Anderson for Secretary of State, NPI poll suggests\n\nAn ultra MAGA Repub­li­can’s write-in can­di­da­cy could play a piv­otal role in keep­ing the office of Wash­ing­ton’s Sec­re­tary of State in Demo­c­ra­t­ic hands this year, a poll con­duct­ed this week for the North­west Pro­gres­sive Insti­tute indicates.\n\nPoll Watch: KOMO/Strategies 360 confirms Patty Murray has double digit lead; Hobbs and Anderson tied for Secretary of State\n\nWash­ing­ton’s Demo­c­ra­t­ic U.S. Sen­a­tor Pat­ty Mur­ray con­tin­ues to enjoy a dou­ble dig­it lead over Repub­li­can chal­lenger Tiffany Smi­ley, while Sec­re­tary of State hope­fuls Steve Hobbs and Julie Ander­son are tied at 38% apiece with less than a month until the midterms, a new poll from Strate­gies 360 and KOMO has found.\n\nPoll Watch: Elway finds solid lead for Murray; Steve Hobbs barely ahead of Julie Anderson\n\nWith less than a month until bal­lots drop, Elway Research has found a thir­teen point lead for Democ­rats in Wash­ing­ton’s 2022 U.S. Sen­ate race along with a sta­tis­ti­cal tie in the Sec­re­tary of State contest.\n\nWell, that’s embarrassing: Republicans won’t have a candidate for Washington Secretary of State listed on the general election ballot\n\nWith three counts now com­plet­ed, it looks like Demo­c­ra­t­ic incum­bent Steve Hobbs will be fac­ing unaf­fil­i­at­ed can­di­date (and Pierce Coun­ty Audi­tor) Julie Ander­son this fall, leav­ing Repub­li­cans shut out of the final round for an office they con­tin­u­ous­ly con­trolled from the 1950s until last year.\n\nWashington’s once sleepy special election for Secretary of State is now on the media’s radar\n\nIn the 2022 Top Two elec­tion, incum­bent Steve Hobbs faces three Repub­li­cans — Kei­th Wag­oner, Mark Milos­cia, and Bob Hag­glu­nd, along with Pierce Coun­ty Audi­tor Julie Ander­son, who is run­ning as an inde­pen­dent, plus a con­spir­a­cy the­o­rist, Tam­borine Bor­rel­li, an unaf­fil­i­at­ed can­di­date named Kur­tis Engle, and one oth­er Demo­c­ra­t­ic can­di­date, Mar­quez Tig­gs, who is run­ning with­out mon­ey or par­ty support.\n\nPoll Watch: Crosscut/Elway finds twenty point lead for Patty Murray and Democrats\n\nFor the sec­ond time in as many weeks, a new poll has been released that cor­re­lates NPI’s recent statewide poll find­ings demon­strat­ing that it’s the Demo­c­ra­t­ic Par­ty that is head­ing into the midterms in Wash­ing­ton State with momen­tum and vote enthusiasm.\n\nMidterms marvel: Seattle Times endorses a Democratic-only slate in marquee races\n\nIn what may come as a pleas­ant sur­prise to the major­i­ty of its read­ers, The Seat­tle Times is rec­om­mend­ing a Demo­c­ra­t­ic-only slate of can­di­dates in each of the mar­quee con­tests that’s on the 2022 ballot.\n\nSteve Hobbs leads crowded field for Secretary of State (WA), with most voters undecided\n\nWhile a sig­nif­i­cant major­i­ty of vot­ers (56%) said they were unsure, which was unsur­pris­ing con­sid­er­ing the num­ber of choic­es in the ques­tion, Hobbs was the clear leader among those who did offer an opin­ion, with 17% say­ing they would vote for him. No oth­er can­di­date received sup­port beyond 6%.\n\nFiling Week surprise: Fundamentalist Mark Miloscia jumps into Secretary of State contest\n\nMilos­ci­a’s sud­den entrance into this race is an odd devel­op­ment. If his heart was set on run­ning for office again, why did­n’t he declare six months ago and start lay­ing the ground­work? Only two months remain until bal­lots show up in vot­ers’ mail­box­es. That isn’t much time in which to build a statewide campaign."
