        "text": "Looking ahead to the 2015-2016 County Budget\n\nUnderstanding the county budget:\n\nThe county has two types of funds: Dedicated and General. Dedicated Funds comprise the largest portion -- 83%-- of the total county budget. These funds include contracts for services, fees, and levies that have been collected for specific purposes and must be allocated by law toward those purposes. For example, bus fares must go toward paying for transit; sewer fees toward paying for wastewater treatment; and the voter-approved EMS property tax levy to fund Emergency Medical Services.\n\nGeneral Fund\n\nThe General Fund (see pie chart to right), which is about 17% of the total budget, has more flexibility. This fund pays for the traditional functions of county government, such as the Sheriff's office, and critical day-to-day services that are not supported by dedicated revenues. Almost 73% of the general fund goes to support state-mandated criminal justice and public safety services. The remainder pays for other programs, such as health and human services.\n\nThe General Fund and the many services it provides to county residents are supported by two principal sources of tax revenue: property tax and sales tax.\n\nKing County is the property tax collector for all taxing districts within the county. Although you pay your property tax to King County, the County receives only 18 cents of every dollar. The rest goes to other agencies, including over 50 cents to schools, 18 cents to cities and towns, and 8 cents to other taxing districts (see graph to right).\n\nAlthough King County residents pay an average sales tax of 9.5 percent, the state keeps 6.5 percent while 1.8 percent goes to Metro Transit and Sound Transit, and 0.2 percent is set aside for criminal justice, mental health and substance abuse services. The remaining 1 percent is split between cities and the County. (See graph to right.)\n\nWhy is there a budget shortfall?\n\nKing County is now the 14th most populous county in the nation, with over 1.9 million residents, and King County’s government is the second largest provider of public services in Washington State. However, as the County has grown as federal and state governments have made significant reductions to their support of vital human services and left other critical needs unfunded. These service responsibilities have come without additional funding from the state or other sources to meet the expenses they incur. Thus, in addition to the services they usually provide to residents, counties have had to fill the gap.\n\nCounties have only two principal sources of tax revenue to support public services—property tax and sales tax—a structure that dates back to the farm-based economy of the 1850s.\n\nIn the 1990’s, by voter initiative, the amount of property taxes levied by counties was capped at 1 percent per year, plus revenue from new construction. As a result, revenues counties receive grow at a much lower rate than the cost of maintaining services to residents. This gap is called the “structural gap,” and is one of the reasons the county has experienced a shortfall.\n\nListening is the beginning of understanding and your input is valuable to me as my colleagues and I begin the budget process. With that in mind, I’d like to invite you to attend one of our four Budget and Fiscal Management Town Halls and provide your perspective on what you would like to see in the 2015-2016 King County Budget.\n\nThe dates and locations are as follow:\n\nWednesday, October 8 – Fall City—Chief Kanim Middle School (the Commons Area) 32627 SE Redmond-Fall City Rd\n\nTuesday, October 14 – Bellevue—City Hall, Council Chambers 450 110th Avenue NE\n\nThursday, October 23 – Kent—Norm Maleng Regional Justice Center, Courtroom 3F, 401 Fourth Avenue N\n\nWednesday, October 29 – Seattle—King County Courthouse, Council Chambers 10th Flr. 516 Third Ave.\n\nAll meetings begin at 6:30 p.m.\n\nI encourage you to contact my office at (206) 477-1007 or email me at pete.vonreichbauer@kingcounty.gov if you have any questions, comments or concerns. Also, please visit my Facebook Page for updates about my activities at the King County Council.\n\nWith Best Wishes,"
