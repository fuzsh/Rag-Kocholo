He was reappointed to two of the governor’s drug and alcohol prevention and treatment task forces (the Opioid Task Force and the Data and Evaluation Task Force). He says, “Everyone likely knows someone adversely affected. We have made progress decreasing the number of opioid prescriptions, their day’s supply, and strength. However, we now see the statistics indicating increasing utilization of stimulants and amphetamines, especially in the 30–59 age group. This is a national trend that we will now focus on, without sacrificing gains made against opioid abuse. As everyone knows, the COVID pandemic sent several projects into a holding pattern. We are back to moving forward.”\n\nLouis Collette is among the first Peace Corps volunteers to return to overseas service since the agency’s unprecedented global evacuation in March 2020. “The Peace Corps is the best organization for foreign volunteer service.
