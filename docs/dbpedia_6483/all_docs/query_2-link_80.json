        "text": "Introduction\n\nA common definition of health, established by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 1948, specifies that health is ‘a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity’ (Svendsen & Løber, 2020, p. 1). In 1984, WHO proposed a modified definition of health as \"the extent to which an individual or group is able to realize aspirations and satisfy needs and to change or cope with the environment. Health is a resource for everyday life, not the objective of living; it is a positive concept, emphasizing social and personal resources, as well as physical capacities\" (WHO. Regional Office for Europe, 1984).\n\nExperience shows that a human life is influenced by both material and immaterial (spiritual) realities. These are both visible in health, which combines the material, mental and spiritual dimensions of an individual. In this sense, health is associated with integral human development. An individual having a coherent, integrated personality and positive relationships with other people finds it easier to solve everyday dilemmas. It conducive to their development and health, which is also revealed in the spiritual domain of their personality. However, to achieve such integrity, young people need the support of wise educators who are reflective, experienced practitioners in spiritual health as well as in other fields.\n\nOne proposal for helping young people reach maturity is educational accompaniment, which comprises the support in spiritual health that they receive. This concept takes many forms, but it seems that educational accompaniment—which draws on the 500-year-old Ignatian tradition (Lowney, 2003)—can be significant for contemporary education. The search for relationships between the material and spiritual realms was a trend in antiquity, when materiality and corporeality were placed at one pole and spirituality at the other.\n\nThe term spirituality is also found in the literature of the patristic era (fifth century). Originally, the term was given a religious significance, thereby exposing the inner experiences of the believer which arose from the relations that they had established with God and their social environment (Chmielewski, 2002, pp. 226–232). In this sense, spirituality refers to the progress or spiritual development of a person. The term was also often used to denote human religiosity.\n\nIn the social sciences, the question of spirituality is gaining an increasingly prominent place. It has shifted from religious reflection and been reinterpreted by relating spiritual content to spheres of human life such as awareness and self-awareness, wisdom, understanding, feelings, sensitivity, morality, creativity, aesthetic sense and world view. All these areas relate to health issues, both individually and socially.\n\nThe Research Subject and Functions of Accompaniment Pedagogy\n\nAs a pedagogical theory the pedagogy of accompaniment deals with cognition, studying, describing, explaining and interpreting a fragment of social reality, which is the process of educational accompaniment. As it stems from the Ignatian tradition, the source of knowledge of this process is experiences interpreted through the spiritual exercises of Ignatius of Loyola. In order to be studied, they must be viewed through the spirit of the humanistic paradigm (e.g. subject participatory or synergistic/participatory) using qualitative methods of data collection, analysis and interpretation. Similarly, spiritual exercises and Ignatian pedagogy appreciate the subjectivity of the educator and the pupil, while the research related to the pedagogy of accompaniment appreciates the subjectivity of the researcher and the subject.\n\nThis theory of educational accompaniment performs the functions attributed to pedagogical theories, namely diagnostic, evaluative and prognostic. The diagnostic function of the pedagogy of accompaniment is realised by valuing the contexts in which an experience takes place. The contextual interpretation of the experience makes it possible to diagnose the life situation of both the pupil and the educator.\n\nAccording to the assumptions of the pedagogy of accompaniment experience should be reflected upon, allowing one to identify the causes of a given situation and to form a plan for achieving a particular goal. In performing the evaluative function, the pedagogy of accompaniment verifies that the actual state of experience corresponds with a certain ideal; it uses the achievements of transcendent pedagogy, which provides access to knowledge through natural and religious knowledge.\n\nThe primary advantage of this approach is that it provides new knowledge and enables a person to broaden their horizons regarding the key questions about human existence. The prognostic function requires hypotheses about the future of the pupil. The pedagogy of accompaniment derives these hypotheses from analysed experiences, thereby basing the research process on respect for the dignity and freedom of the individual.\n\nThis theory also has a therapeutic function, reflected in the continual process of healing from the many difficulties and hardships that are faced along the way. Understanding them from the proper perspective becomes a benefit derived from the mature accompaniment of an educator whose spiritual competences are very high. Such an educator is likely to share their experience from the spiritual/healing path that they have taken."
