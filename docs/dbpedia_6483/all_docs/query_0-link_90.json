        "text": "Testimony in support of SB 5224 – concerning advisory votes\n\nEliminating Eyman’s push poll tax advisory votes from the ballot\n\nWashington State House Committee on State Government & Tribal Relations\n\nSteve Zemke – Tax Sanity March 11, 2019\n\nThe Washington State Ballot for the last ten years has been cluttered with nonbinding push poll questions on tax measures passed by the Legislature.\n\nThese so called “tax advisory” questions” were put there as part of Tim Eyman’s Initiative 960 as an attempt to increase public resentment to any “tax” measures despite their benefit to the larger public. The ballot title for each is basically written as an anti-tax push poll based on Eyman’s ballot title language in Initiative 960 that stipulated the polling question wording.\n\nThey carry no Legislative weight as they only record voters’ opinions. They are like a public opinion poll paid for by taxpayers. But Eyman tries to use them to build public opposition to funding public services by wording them such that voters will be inclined to respond negatively to any tax increase. Under Eyman’s definition of tax increases he also includes any efforts by the Legislature to repeal any tax exemptions or tax expenditures even if they are no longer needed or are no longer meeting the state priorities of government.\n\nDeciphering Eyman’s ballot title language is very tricky and confusing to voters. They seem purposely written to try to get voters to vote to repeal any tax increase passed by the Legislature. And unlike initiatives, the write-up on these so-called tax advisory votes in the voter’s pamphlet contain no explanatory statement, no pro and con statements, and no fiscal impact statement.\n\nIn fact, the State Attorney General has no real ability to even try to fairly explain the issue in the ballot title since Eyman’s initiative 960 required that the ballot title be worded as he wrote it:\n\nThe legislature imposed, without a vote of the people, (identification of tax and description of increase), costing (most up-to-date ten-year cost projection, expressed in dollars and rounded to the nearest million) in its first ten years, for government spending. This tax increase should be:\n\nRepealed . . .[ ]\n\nMaintained . . .[ ]\n\nPlease end this waste of taxpayer dollars to promote Tim Eyman’s anti-tax propaganda and misuse of the public ballot to further his self-serving anti-tax initiative promotion business. Vote to move SB 5224 out of committee to Rules and to the House floor for passage by the full House. Push polls to promote a private business deserve no place on Washington State’s ballot.\n\nUpdate Information SB 5224 was prime sponsored by Senator Patty Kudder and Senators Hunt, Takko, Keiser, Nguyen, Darneille, Das, Wellman, Saldana, McCoy, Hasegawa, and Pedersen. The bill has been heard in the House Committee on State Government & Tribal Relations. Please contact your Representatives and urge they vote for this bill by clicking on this link SB 5224 and then clicking on “comment on this bill.” Thanks.\n\nTestimony in support of SB 5513 – the Tax Exemption Transparency and Accountability Act\n\nWashington State Senate Ways and Means Committee, Jan. 18, 2018\n\nSteve Zemke – Tax Sanity\n\nThank you for this opportunity to testify on this legislation.\n\nThis is the fifth year this bill has been before you and each year it picks up additional support. Senate SB 5513 has 14 sponsors and its companion bill in the House, HB 1500, has 33 sponsors. This is almost one third of our state Legislators.\n\nLegislation to create a Tax Expenditure Budget has been increasingly supported by numerous groups in our state, including the Washington State Budget and Policy Center, All in for Washington, the Washington State Labor Council, the League of Women Voters of Washington, Washington’s Paramount Duty, the Washington State Democratic Party, the Washington Education Association, SEIU 775, Northwest Progressive Institute, Washington Federation of State Employees, Washington State Council of Firefighters, Faith Action Network, Puget Sound Advocates for Retirement Action, and others\n\nWhy are these groups supporting this legislation? Because they believe that a system of tax expenditures that gives away more in revenue from the tax base than it collects is a broken system. They believe that tax exemptions need transparency and accountability and fairness. That does not exist now.\n\nTax Exemptions, preferences, deductions, credits, and deferrals are off budget expenditures. They lack the transparency and accountably that exists for other expenditures the state makes as part of the biennial budget process. According to the Department of Revenue’s projection in their 2016 Tax Exemption Report for the 2015 to 2017 biennium they projected that while the state would collect some $7.4 billion in B&O taxes, they would exempt from the same tax base some $11.4 billion. This gap has widened since the last biennium.\n\nIncluding the rest of the tax exemptions in their report, the Department of Revenue projected that off budget tax expenditures would total almost $40 billion while only collecting revenue totaling some $32.6 billion.\n\nOf the 694 tax exemptions in that report about 450 are discretionary. The Department of Revenue projected that in the 2017 to 2019 Biennium that of the $54 billion in projected tax expenditures, some $30 billion would fall into “potential revenue gains”.\n\nThis legislation does not mandate wholesale repeal of tax expenditures. It asks for accountability and transparency and biennial review and gives the legislature the ability to act to end exemptions if they do not meet the priorities of government the same as expenditures in the regular biennial operating appropriations budget must.\n\nConcern about the current system includes a quickly dated Tax Exemption report by the Department of Revenue that is only updated once every 4 years. Most other states in the country update their report every 2 years or less. California updates their Tax Expenditure report every year.\n\nCompanies like Microsoft, Starbucks, Expedia, Adobe and Boeing all must report to their stockholders every year and issue quarterly profit and loss statements. Their financial statements are scrutinized by their stockholders. It does not make sense that Washington State only updates its Tax Exemption Report every 4 years. It will next be updated in 2020. It should at a minimum be updated two years just as the state biennial budget is..\n\nOnly 73 of the 694 listed exemptions in the 2016 Tax Exemption Report have sunset provisions. This means 89% of the tax expenditures have no sunset provision and never require the Washington State legislature to ever vote on them again. Meanwhile all expenditures in the regular operating appropriations budget are scrutinized and voted on every 2 years with adjustment made in the 2nd year of the biennium.\n\nAlso in the Tax exemption report, 54 exemptions are listed as “unable to disclose” the amount of revenue involved. Businesses and other entities are benefiting from state tax law in getting exemptions and lower or no taxes. The public has a right to know the value of these exemptions.\n\nThe public has a right to know that these exemptions are creating jobs or providing valuable services to Washington State citizens just as they expect expenditures in the regular budget appropriations bill to produce.\n\nWe require that accountability in the regular budget appropriations process – we don’t say we’re spending state revenue but the public doesn’t have the right to know because the recipient doesn’t want us to know what they are getting.\n\nWith the current lack of accountability and transparency and sound fiscal review and evaluation as to whether current tax expenditures meet the state priorities of government and have clear measurable objectives as to their effectiveness in meeting state needs, taxpayers and citizens in this state increasingly believe state government and the legislature are not doing their job.\n\n.Please step up and vote to fix this broken tax expenditure system that severely lacks needed transparency, accountability and sound fiscal management of our total state budget.\n\nSteve Zemke\n\nDirector Tax Sanity\n\nsteve@taxsanity.org\n\nwww.taxsanity.org\n\nJoint statement from Seattle State Senators last night\n\nDavid Frockt Reuven Carlyle Jamie Pedersen Rebecca Saldana\n\nMarilyn Chase Bob Hasegawa\n\nFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE — July 20, 2017\n\nFailure to pass capital budget will hit Seattle communities hard\n\nOLYMPIA — Seattle area state senators warned today that the Senate’s failure to pass a capital budget will have dramatic effects on proposed investments for the Seattle area in K-12 education, community colleges, housing and health care, including mental health, among other critical needs.\n\nThough capital budget projects around the state were agreed to by Democratic and Republican negotiators on Tuesday, Senate Republicans continued to insist that a separate water rights bill be resolved first before they would agree to vote on the budget and its corresponding bonds. As a result, the Legislature adjourned from its third special session with no action on this vital budget that historically makes critical investments in Washington’s future.\n\nThe negotiated $4 billion dollar budget would have created thousands of jobs in all parts of Washington, including throughout the Seattle area.\n\nThe budget provided state matching funds for over $1 billion in school construction projects already approved at the local level, including at least $35 million for schools in Seattle, $15 million for Lake Washington School District and $8 million for Edmonds School District among others. Additionally, the budget provided for hundreds of millions of dollars in buildings for the higher education system from community colleges in this region to the University of Washington. At UW, the budget provided matching funds for the Burke Museum as well as the new Population Health Science building, leveraging the UW’s partnership with the Gates Foundation to make Seattle the world leader in global health. There was an additional $40 million to UW for advanced materials and clean energy test beds, the Evans School’s Parrington Hall, and renovation of the Medical School’s Health Sciences T-Wing.\n\nThe agreed-upon budget would have provided over $100 million for the Housing Trust Fund, including investments in local housing projects through innovative modular housing and tiny home projects to a new workforce housing development in Mt. Baker. It contained a first-of-its-kind investment in Community Health Centers to address Washington’s ongoing dental health crisis for the poor, who often lack access to dentists and wind up in local emergency rooms.\n\nThe budget would have built on the state mental health system by providing new facilities in a number of regions where the lack of treatment options is acute and where the state is under court order to find remedies. It would have invested in critical water infrastructure and flood control projects east of the mountains while also providing record investments in stormwater controls and conservation and restoration in the Puget Sound area.\n\n“Having negotiated for the Senate Democratic Caucus and having reached across the aisle to reach an agreement on all of the proposed expenditures, I am very disappointed that this budget agreement was essentially held hostage to a resolution of a separate water rights bill,” said Sen. David Frockt, D-Seattle. “I recognized that that was an important issue, but the fact is we just ended the longest session in Washington State history without a new biennial capital budget for the first time in decades. These two issues – the budget and the water rights bill — need to be delinked for the good of the entire state. That is what we are supposed to be doing. Regrettably, they weren’t delinked, even though there were solutions on the table that would have provided immediate relief for rural property owners to dig wells.”\n\n“The governor has indicated an openness to a continued effort to resolve this impasse so that these critical investments in Washington can be made. I will continue to work with him and with both parties to get this budget passed and funded.” Said Frockt.\n\n“The Senate Republicans have taken it upon themselves to deprive our community of important projects and economic development investments that our most vulnerable depend on,” said Sen. Rebecca Saldaña, D-Seattle. “From critical affordable housing for seniors and the homeless, to community and arts centers and parks, my constituents will feel the impact of the GOP’s inability to govern.”\n\n“The failure of Senate Republican leadership to pass a capital budget is both disappointing and frustrating,” said Sen. Jamie Pedersen, D-Seattle. “This reckless decision will prevent investments in schools, community healthcare, and the arts and cost thousands of jobs.”\n\n“The Republicans’ refusal to allow the passage of this budget, approved by all but one Republican in the other chamber, is nothing less than a dereliction of their duties as public servants,” said Sen. Maralyn Chase, D-Shoreline. “They have committed to a course of action that will harm Washingtonians in every corner of our state.”\n\n“Our infrastructure and quality of life will deteriorate, and all Washingtonians will share the pain to varying degrees,” said Sen. Bob Hasegawa, D-Beacon Hill. “It doesn’t make sense to hold a $4 billion jobs and infrastructure bill hostage for the right of developers to trump other people’s senior water rights.”\n\n“I remain deeply committed to resolving this crisis, and finding a path forward in the weeks and months ahead,” said Sen. Reuven Carlyle, D-Seattle “I was proud to have secured funding to reduce class sizes through school construction and am devastated the deal has fallen apart. I’m not giving up and will fight to secure these vital dollars. Our Seattle delegation is 100-percent on board to support a responsible capital investment budget.”\n\nHad it passed, the budget would have funded these projects in in Saldaña’s 37th District:\n\n $3 million for Othello Homesight;\n\n $3 million for Aging in PACE;\n\n $2 million for Valley City Recovery Place;\n\n $1.5 million for the Amara Building;\n\n $1.3 million for the Multicultural Community Center in Seattle;\n\n $1.1 million to clean up Mt. Baker Properties for new housing;\n\n $750,000 for the Georgetown Steam Plant Historic Steam Plant;\n\n $737,000 for El Centro e la Raza;\n\n $600,000 for the Filipino Community Innovation Center;\n\n $520,000 to expand Pratt’s Campus\n\n $400,000 for Washington Care Services;\n\n $400,000 for Ethiopian Community Affordable Senior Housing;\n\n $360,000 for the Cherry Street Fellowship;\n\n $315,000 for Children’s Playgarden;\n\n $250,000 to increase dental clinic capacity via the Seattle Indian Health Board;\n\n $200,000 for the Seattle Indian Health Board; and\n\n $141,000 for the Mount Baker Community Club.\n\nIn Pedersen’s 43rd District, the budget would have funded:\n\n $1.855 million for the Country Doctor Community Health Centers;\n\n $1.5 million in renovations to the Asian Art Museum;\n\n $1.5 million for the Campaign for Town Hall;\n\n $1.5 million in improvements to Hugo House;\n\n $1.3 million for Neighborcare;\n\n $1.1 million to the University YMCA;\n\n $750,000 for upgrades to the 5th Avenue Theater;\n\n $643,000 for preservation of the historic University Heights Center;\n\n $600,000 for University YMCA;\n\n $500,000 to purchase the Lambert House;\n\n $491,000 for upgrades to the Paramount Theatre;\n\n $475,000 for redevelopment of the Arboretum Waterfront Trail;\n\n $354,000 for the Cornish Playhouse;\n\n $257,000 for Lighthouse No. 83;\n\n $257,000 for Phase Three rehabilitation of the Stimson-Green Mansion Building;\n\n $75,000 for NW Choirs;\n\n $29,000 to replace the deck of the MV Lotus; and\n\n $21,000 for Nikkei Herigate.\n\nIn Chase’s 32nd District, the budget would have funded:\n\n $50 million for the Dept. of Ecology for leaking tank model remedies at the Strickland Chevron in Lynnwood;\n\n $37.7 million for the Edmonds Community College’s Science, Engineering, Technology Building;\n\n $3.5 million for Allied Health, Science & Manufacturing in Shoreline;\n\n $2.8 million for an addition to the Public Health Lab South Laboratory;\n\n $2.5 million for an addition to a Newborn Screening Wing;\n\n $2.2 million for the South Snohomish County Community Resource Center in Lynnwood; and\n\n $650,000 to increase dental clinic capacity at International Community Health Services in Shoreline.\n\nIn Hasagawa’s 11th District, the budget would have funded:\n\n $7.5 million via the Department of Ecology for Floodplains by Design;\n\n $3.5 million in construction loans for the Georgetown Wet Weather Treatment Station;\n\n $3.05 million for Sunset Neighborhood Park in Renton;\n\n $698,000 for roof repairs to the Museum of Flight;\n\n $500,000 to develop the Lake to Sound Trail;\n\n $500,000 for Geriatric Diversion;\n\n $412,000 for the Sunset Career Center in Renton;\n\n $11 million for conservation projects; and\n\n $2.6 million for Community and Technical College projects.\n\nIn Carlyle’s 36th District, the budget would have funded:\n\n $1.5 million for improvements to the Seattle Opera at the Center;\n\n $900,000 for improvements to Interbay PDAC;\n\n $400,000 in improvements to the Seattle Aquarium;\n\n $258,000 for renovations to the PONCHO Forum;\n\n $167,000 in improvements to the Millionair Club;\n\n $65,000 in improvements to the Seattle Opera; and\n\n $30,000 for renewal of the lower Yamasaki Courtyard.\n\n\n\nIn Frockt’s 46th District, the budget would have funded:\n\n $2 million for renovations at the Magnuson Community Center;\n\n $1.2 million for Lyon Creek Fish Barrier Removal at Lake Forest Park;\n\n $250,000 for improvements to Moorlands Park in Kenmore;\n\n $250,000 for improvement to the Kenmore Public Boathouse in Kenmore; and\n\n $75,000 for improvements to the St. Edward State Park Environmental Learning Center.\n\n###\n\nA list of all statewide and local capital budget projects is available upon request.\n\nFor information: Rick Manugian, Senate Democratic Communications, 360-786-7569\n\nEND TAX EXEMPTIONS AS OFF-BUDGET SPENDING\n\nBY ADDING THEM AS TAX EXPENDITURES TO THE STATE BUDGET!\n\nWashington State currently gives away more revenue from its tax base than it collects. This is a broken tax system built up over many years.\n\nThe Washington State Department of Revenue in their 2016 Tax Expenditure Report projected for the 2015 -2017 biennium that off budget tax expenditures would total almost $40 billion while only collecting revenue totaling some $32.6 billion.\n\nWe don’t generally think of them as such but these tax exemptions, preferences, deductions, credits and deferrals are off budget expenditures. They lack the accountability and transparency that exists for other expenditures the state makes as part of the biennial budget process.\n\nThe Governor must as part of the biennial budget process evaluate all expenditures according to a Priorities of Government protocol. Unfortunately tax exemptions do not have the same criteria or scrutiny. The result is that while the state legislature is seemingly unable to comply with the Washington State Supreme Court’s McCleary decision to fulfill Washington’s “paramount duty” under the Washington State Constitution to fund public education, it excludes from tax collection billions of dollars.\n\nTaxpayers deserve better accountability and transparency of the state’s tax and revenue system. They deserve to know who is receiving these tax exemptions, how much money is involved and for what reason they are given. They deserve to have a system that prioritizes state needs, not exemptions for special interests and the wealthy that benefit from a system where 90% of the exemptions have no sunset provision while the state budget has a biennial review and vote as to funding.\n\nAccording to the Washington State Department of Revenue’s 2016 Tax Exemption Study, while the State expects to collect some $7.4 billion in B&O tax revenue in the current 2015 -2017 biennium, it exempts from collection some $11.4 billion. When sales and use taxes were included with the analysis, the results are similar – the state expects to collect some $18.9 billion in revenue from sales and use tax, while exempting some $16.9 billion in revenue\n\nWashington State has created some 694 tax exemptions over the years. Over 450 of these are discretionary tax exemptions, not required by Federal or State constitutional law. These discretionary tax exemptions will account for over $28.3 billion in B &O and sales/use tax revenue not collected in the current biennium..\n\nIncluding property tax exemptions the 2016 Department of Revenue Report projects that in total, Washington State will see as off budget tax expenditures almost $40 billion in tax exemptions this biennium while only collecting revenues of $32.6 billion for the Legislature to fund its biennial budget.\n\nHB 1500 introduced by Rep.Pollet and 32 other sponsors would require the governor to propose and the state legislature to adopt a Tax Expenditure Budget every 2 years as part of the biennial omnibus operating appropriations act. A companion bill, SB 5513 has been introduced in the WA State Senate by Senator David Frockt with 12 other sponsors.\n\nHB 1500 / SB 5513 would give the Washington State Legislature an opportunity to periodically evaluate the need and effectiveness of the state’s tax exemptions in meeting current state needs. They would do this at the same time they are making budget decisions about prioritizing other state expenditures for public services as part of the biennial budget appropriations process.\n\nWhat would HB 1500 /SB 5513 – the Tax Exemption Transparency and Accountability Act do?\n\nThis measure would require new and existing discretionary tax exemptions to be authorized every two years in a tax expenditure budget. It will add much needed transparency and accountability to the hundreds of exemptions and preferences, along with their cost and how each decision to spend money on an exemption or preference is a choice to expend funds for this purpose with particular beneficiaries.\n\nThe tax expenditure budget would detail the fiscal impact, purpose, and effectiveness in meeting the purpose of each tax exemption.\n\nTax exemption not included in the tax expenditure budget would expire at the end of the calendar year in which the budget is adopted.\n\nContact your Legislators at www.leg.wa.org and urge them to support the Tax Exemption Transparency and Accountability Act.\n\nAction item – Urging your Legislators to pass HB 1500 and companion bill SB 5513 is easy. You can leave them a message by going to www.leg.wa.gov, entering 1500 or 5513 for the bill number after clicking the bill information link and then clicking on “comment on this bill.” Or call the Legislative hotline at 1-800-562-6000 and leave a message to for your legislators and the Governor to support HB 1500 and SB 5513 to prioritize state spending, accountability and transparency by creating a Tax Expenditure Budget as part of the biennial budget appropriations process.\n\nBe sure to thank your legislators if they are a sponsor of this legislation.
