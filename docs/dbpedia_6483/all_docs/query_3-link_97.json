        "text": "SEATTLE â€” Democratic Sen. Maria Cantwell and Republican Susan Hutchison will face off in November for a Washington Senate seat.\n\nCantwell, who is seeking her fourth term, easily outpaced all other candidates in the Tuesday Democratic primary. Under Washington's primary system, the top two vote getters go on to November, regardless of party. Cantwell is Washington's junior senator and the ranking member of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee. Hutchison, a former GOP state party chair, was finishing second in the voting.\n\nIn a closely watched open congressional race, Republican Dino Rossi was leading a crowded ballot and easily advanced to the general election. Rossi is a former state senator who had unsuccessful runs for governor and U.S. Senate.\n\nIncumbent Republican U.S. Rep. Dave Reichert is retiring from the 8th Congressional District after more than a decade.\n\nAmong the dozen candidates on the ballot, one of three Democrats are expected to advance: Issaquah pediatrician Kim Schrier at 18.87% in early returns, former King County deputy prosecutor Jason Rittereiser at 17.51%, and former federal public-health official Shannon Hader, also a physician, from Auburn, at just over 12%.\n\nWashington is a vote-by-mail state, and voters had a deadline of 8 p.m. to have their ballot postmarked or placed in a drop box. In some of the more competitive races, results may not be known for days as most counties will update vote counts only once a day.\n\nFor all the election results >>> Washington 2018 primary results\n\nDistrict 8 includes Seattle's eastern suburbs of Sammamish and Issaquah, which have seen their populations grow on the back of Microsoft, Google and other expanding technology companies. The district also includes more rural economies that are heavily dependent on agricultural exports.\n\nThe other nine U.S. House seats are also contested in the primary, with the incumbents seeking re-election.\n\nIn the 5th Congressional District in eastern Washington, Republican incumbent Cathy McMorris Rodgers advanced, along with Democrat Lisa Brown, a former chancellor of Washington State University who previously served as majority leader in the state Senate. Brown and McMorris Rodgers were nearly tied in early returns.\n\nMcMorris Rodgers -- the fourth ranking member of the GOP leadership in the U.S. House -- was only about 500 votes ahead in early returns against Brown.\n\nIn the other surprise, in the 3rd Congresional District in Southwest Washington, incumbent GOP Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler was only about 4 percentage points ahead of Democrat Carolyn Long, a professor at Washington State University-Vancouver.\n\nEarlier on Tuesday, Nicholas Hentges, 27, of Spokane, dropped his ballot off in downtown. Hentges said he was motivated by dissatisfaction with the actions of President Donald Trump, and wanted to help defeat McMorris Rodgers.\n\nThe expected face-off between McMorris Rodgers and Brown in November has seen a flurry of television attack ads in the Spokane market, and may be driving interest in the election.\n\nIn Spokane County, the return rate for mail-in ballots was running at 34 percent on Tuesday afternoon, well above the state average of 26 percent.\n\nWashington Secretary of State Kim Wyman said nearly 27 percent of primary ballots had been returned as of late afternoon."
