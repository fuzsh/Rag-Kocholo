        "text": "Lawmakers will be holding a town hall meeting on Saturday, 2/17/18, in Capitol Hill. We need constituents from the 43rd LD to attend and tell Speaker Chopp and Representative Macri how important it is to repeal the death penalty. Determined and courageous Senators from both sides of the aisle voted Wednesday to strengthen Washington State’s criminal justice system by repealing the death penalty. We will have signs to help you thank Sen. Jamie Pedersen, who led the effort on the Senate floor. Please come out and make your voice heard! Pick up a sign near the entrance to increase your impact!\n\nBelow are targeted messages that will be the most persuasive to the lawmakers in the 43rd LD:\n\nRepeal the death penalty now, because doing so strengthens our criminal justice system.\n\nEnding the death penalty saves limited criminal justice resources.\n\nRepealing the death penalty now allows for equal treatment across the state.\n\nEnding the death penalty ensures swift and sure justice for families that have lost a loved one to homicide.\n\nThe 43rd Legislative District covers parts of Seattle - specifically Downtown, First Hill, Capitol Hill, South Lake Union, Washington Park, Madison Park, Eastlake, Montlake, Portage Bay, Wallingford, Fremont, the University District (including the UW campus), Green Lake and parts of Phinney Ridge and Ravenna.\n\nNot sure of your district? Check here.\n\nAbove: Front of postcard\n\nIf you have not already signed the postcard for your legislators, please do! We will be making more deliveries in these final 2 weeks of session!\n\nThe House Judiciary Committee will have a hearing on the bill (HB 1935) next week (day & time not yet scheduled). The bill must be voted out of the committee by Friday 2/23 in order to make it to the House floor. The bill must then pass the House floor by Friday March 2!\n\nPostcard text:\n\nDEAR REPRESENTATIVE/SENATOR,\n\nAs your constituent, I urge you to support legislation to repeal Washington’s death penalty. The death penalty has failed Washington. There are many reasons to repeal the death penalty. It is not a deterrent and does not keep us safe.\n\nEach death penalty case in Washington costs an average of $1 million more than a similar case where the death penalty was not sought.\n\nStudies show that jurors in Washington state are more than four times more likely to recommend a death sentence for a black defendant than for a white defendant in a similar case.\n\nThere is a risk of killing innocent people - since 1973, 160 men & women have been exonerated from death rows across the U.S.\n\nThe death penalty is a failed public policy that doesn't keep us safe and routes money away from programs that serve our communities.\n\nSincerely,\n\n(Name)\n\n(Address)"
