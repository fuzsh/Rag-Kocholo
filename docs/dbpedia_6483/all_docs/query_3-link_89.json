        "text": "Patrick Henry was perhaps the most outspoken Christian of the Founding Fathers. He is also one of the most forgotten, except for his speech to the Second Virginia Convention at St. John’s Church. He sat at the feet of the great Virginia preacher Samuel Davies in his early years, next to his devout Christian mother. He rose through the ranks of the frontier lawyers then among the Tidewater Grandees of the House of Delegates. Always outspoken, always with enemies arrayed against him, Henry stood on principles and did back down from those who would challenge them. He led Virginia to Independence and through the War, then opposed the Constitution for its granting too much power to a president, though the first one would be his friend George Washington. An example to generations of young Americans, Patrick Henry needs to be better known today.\n\nOne of the boldest stratagems of the Second World War involved the bombing of Tokyo shortly after the attack on Pearl Harbor. Jacob DeShazer, one of the Doolittle’s raiders who participated in that assault, led a life fleeing from God until his captivity as a prisoner of the Japanese. His story and that of the commanding Japanese pilot in the attack on Pearl Harbor, Mitsuo Fushida, intertwine in a way only God could orchestrate through a series of remarkable providences. This story shows the hand of God in the lives of two relatively obscure warriors, which in the end resulted in the conversion of many Japanese people and the witness of the Gospel to untold thousands of others in the post war world. History is not only stranger than fiction, it displays the glory of God in amazing ways.\n\nSecular Humanism is a pagan religion based on the sovereignty of man. Following America’s Civil War, a number of theologians and philosophers stepped forward to promote that religion in a variety of disciplines. One of the most progressive philosophers who rejected the biblical view of man and God, defined what education should become. John Dewy became the high priest of the public school movement. We will examine his presuppositions and his success in molding government-controlled education and its implications for today’s United States.\n\nOur children are the future of our country and the Church. They must be trained to stand in the day of battle, lead when others falter, and live lives that exemplify character, courage, and perseverance. We do not have to invent historical examples of such leaders, nor despair because such men are hard to find today. The exemplary lives of Washington, Lee and Churchill provide ample illustration and witness of the kind of men whose lives can inspire our children today. Pre-registration is required. Cost per registration is $10.\n\nWalt, my husband, and I will talk about the slowly dawning truth that we could not make our children love Jesus, but we could train them in obedience, (albeit with inconsistencies in our discipline of them) and show the Grace of Christ to us, by being willing to ask forgiveness and repent of our own sins to them. Setting an atmosphere of grace and love in the home is paramount to representing His love to them.\n\nBound by our own rules of what godliness means, besides following the 10 Commandments, each of us as Christians, slowly begin to recognize our own desire to be approved of by God and by everyone who knows us. As we learn to focus on what Christ did, while learning to understand that we must love Him with every fibre of our being, we gradually see that our lives are all about bringing glory to HIM, and not to ourselves. Our journey of understanding His grace happened in one year, tho‘ we had certainly been sure of our salvation for many years. From living to be seen by others, falling constantly under condemnation, and then seeing the audience of ONE, our lives were changed!\n\nI will share with you ladies some verses that have changed my life, as I want to encourage you to focus on our Loving Father who knew us before we were born, and will watch over every step of every year of our lives, until He takes us to Heaven. I will seek to encourage you to live by the Spirit, trusting His Word implicitly, and endeavoring to have a close walk with Jesus Christ. Pre-registration is required. Cost of registration per person is $12.\n\nChoosing curriculum and making sure that your children are on the right track academically can be extremely overwhelming and cause you to lose sight of the most important aspects of homeschooling – discipline and discipleship. Many parents try to add a little character training here or there and miss the crucial daily opportunity for spiritual training. This workshop will deal with the vital aspect of laying a strong spiritual foundation in your children’s lives and keeping academics in their proper place.\n\nAs women, we can experience a wide range of emotions each day. What we do with the emotions that we face is crucial to living a life of focus and peace. This workshop will stir you up to be serious about dealing with your emotions in a biblical way, and in turn encourage you as a homeschool mother in the midst of the emotional challenges that you may face with your children.\n\nEvery homeschool mom can always do with a good dose of encouragement, and reminders of the confidence and joy that is readily available in Christ. Come and hear Rachel share about the faithfulness of God in her homeschool journey and the hope that we can have, despite the many challenges, as we commit the education of our children to Him.\n\nIn this workshop we will discuss not only why parents should cultivate a love for science in their kids but how they can actually do it. Our starting point will be a robust belief in and gratitude toward the Lord of all creation (from a biblical young earth creation perspective). We will explore the reasons why biology is often taught in a boring way and we will discuss very practical solutions to remedy this tragic situation.\n\nThe main goal in this workshop is to see the creation through new eyes. Often when we observe common familiar creatures, our initial reaction is “been there, seen that, ho hum” when there really is nothing ho hum about it. I will survey a few animals, plants, and fungi that we deem boring, and then (without exaggerating) showcase God’s handiwork by unveiling the hidden yet awe-inspiring features of these living masterpieces. We will find out that the boringness is in us, not in the animal, plant, or fungus.\n\nIn a similar vein as the “Magnificence of the Mundane” we will take a closer look at this familiar group of insects. By taking a quick tour of some of the more interesting species of ants, we will be flabbergasted at the complexity, diversity, and behavior of these ordinary, yet extraordinary insects. All these talks are meant to be more than entertainment. They will show us that wonders surround us at every turn. We just need, as teachers, to remove the curricular cataracts that prevent us from seeing these creatures with childlike wonder.\n\nThis talk will be a visual delight (filled with pictures of animals we filmed around the world) while I discuss why, where, and how we filmed “The Riot and the Dance”. I will show a teaser trailer (or two) and tell some exciting stories from our adventures overseas and even in this country. Lastly, I will talk about the TV series “The Riot and the Dance” that we plan to make and then open it up for questions.\n\nMany girls try to change their wrong actions, but never learn to discern the wrong thinking behind the actions. As girls learn to identify lies which are the root issues behind struggles they face and replace them with truth, they will see how God’s Word will transform each area of their lives as the truth sets them free! In this session Sarah will include many stories, illustrations and practical tips for both mothers and daughters as she discusses topics such as a girls’ emotions, purity, an understanding of who God is, and a proper view of who we are in light of the truths from Scripture.\n\nMany parents say that one of their biggest struggles at home is the bickering and fighting that occurs between their children. In this session, Sarah and her dad, Harold, will share how their family learned to work through pride, offenses, and irritations in relationships, and learn to become best friends. This presentation, including Scripture, ideas, insights, stories, and personal testimonies, is recommended for the entire family. Sarah is the co-author of Making Brothers and Sisters Best Friends, with her siblings.\n\nIt is easy to underestimate the tremendous potential we have as families for the Kingdom of God. In this workshop, Harold and Sarah, speaking as a father-daughter team, will share how important it is for every family to be serving the Lord together. When a family works together for the Lord, the young people are given motivation and vision, the family learns to overcome struggles and work in harmony, and mighty works are accomplished for God’s kingdom. This workshop will give encouragement, direction, and practical ideas for developing a “ministry mindset” in children and ministering together as a family. Enjoy watching Sarah’s chalk talk during the presentation.\n\nIn this session Sarah shares key lessons the Lord has taught her about trusting the Lord in the area of singleness. The Lord gave her amazing opportunities in her single years, before getting married at age 41. Yet, it wasn’t always an easy road. Sarah will share honestly about the joys and the challenges of singleness, encouraging single women of all ages to trust God’s timing and pour themselves out for the Lord. She will share ways the Lord encouraged her when she needed it, and insights from Scripture that helped her through the journey.\n\nIllustrated with a chalk drawing, Harold Mally, together with his daughter, Sarah Hancock, will share lessons and perspectives as they look back on their homeschool years. They will challenge families to stay Christ-focused, to remember their ultimate goal in their education, to i incorporate God’s Word into daily life, and to trust in God’s faithfulness and power. Harold will share the importance of the father’s role in homeschooling, and Sarah will share from a daughter’s perspective some of the things she appreciated most about her homeschool years.\n\nMany parents say that one of their biggest struggles at home is the bickering and fighting that occurs between their children.

Though we may feel it’s pushing us to our limits, it provides opportunities for our kids to learn responsibility, independence, and self-control. Kathie Morrissey, mother of 8 children, will share many practical tips and ideas to make your school time more productive, and your job easier.\n\nThe most important thing we can do as we raise our kids is strive to win and keep their hearts! When we have their hearts, we are able to influence them and their values. That is one of the main reasons many parents feel led to home school their children – so THEY can be the ones influencing their children’s values. When we fail to win their hearts, or that heart connection becomes weak, our kids will often begin to look to their friends for relationship, and no longer be open to our teaching. Kathie will share some things to avoid that often lead to losing their hearts, and then give 6 key things to help you win & keep their hearts.\n\nKathie shares how to use God’s word all through the day, and how she has taught her children to love God’s Word, and get excited about it. You will be encouraged as she shares the blessings that have resulted in her family as they practiced these ideas. Included will be suggestions on making Scripture memory fun and easy!\n\nThe battle for our children’s life should be fought on our knees! Prayer is the most important part of rearing our children. Why? Because God can do what we cannot do. Kathie will share several practical prayer ideas, as well as suggestions for some the things we should pray for regarding our children. Being a praying parent makes a difference, and we need to commit to praying daily for our kids.\n\nThe moment every parent dreads: a social worker knocks on your door. What do you do? Knowing beforehand how to respond can mean the difference between quickly resolving a CPS investigation and being subjected to the difficulty of an unnecessary, potentially traumatic experience. During this talk, Amy will equip you with an easy-to-understand explanation of the 4th Amendment, preemptive strategies, and instructions for how to respond if an official shows up at your door.\n\nBetween a worldwide pandemic and a new administration, the face of homeschooling looks dramatically different than it did even a year ago. Amy will talk through what you should expect for homeschooling freedom, potential influences from the federal and state legislation, and why there are so many reasons for hope.\n\nHSLDA membership? That’s some kind of legal thing, isn’t it? If you think you know what membership in HSLDA is all about, think again! From one-on-one advice from our educational consultants to nationwide store discounts, HSLDA provides so much more than legal peace of mind for your homeschool. Discover the ins and outs of HSLDA and why your membership might be the best $12-a-month investment around. Note to Gina – lunch presentation\n\nLooking for ways to engage your student in the political process, but don’t know where to start? Generation Joshua, HSLDA’s offshoot for youth engagement, assists parents in raising up the next generation of Christian leaders and citizens by equipping them to positively influence the political processes of today and tomorrow. As an HSLDA attorney and GenJ alumna, Amy will share how GenJ empowers through relationships and how it will inspire your student to engage in the political process.\n\n“Growing up” shouldn’t be a passive activity. But do you know what it takes to get from childhood to adulthood? I’m not talking about the trend-of-the-week parenting success advice—do you know the foundational, unchanging principles every generation needs to become effective adults? This inspirational conversation will teach you the principles you need to understand yourself, your path, and the kind of difference you can make in the world.\n\n“Go to school, get good grades, get into a good college so you can get a good job and live The American Dream!” Well, the American Dream is broken and many students are broke when they graduate college. Come learn about crowd dynamics, groupthink and how to make sure you’re on the right side of the incredible changes, opportunities and challenges happening in Higher Education today… regardless of what the crowd is doing.\n\nIn the last year, we have seen the world of education change drastically. A constantly- expanding number of online and homeschooling options for higher education can make choosing an educational route harder than ever before. Today’s students need a solution that prepares them for adapting to the daily changes of real life.\n\nAt Unbound, we focus on helping students develop the skills needed for success in any field: communication, conflict resolution, teamwork, decision-making, and turning ideas into reality. Our project-based education program equips students through academic webinars, student-chosen projects, in-person events, and interacting with peers and professionals. With the flexibility of online coursework, we focus on unique opportunities to truly make the world your campus both during your educational journey and into whatever the Lord has prepared for you afterwards.\n\nMark will discuss efforts to create a voucher system in WA state to ensure that money follows children instead of public school teachers’ unions.\n\nHe will also help you understand how to communicate most effectively with your legislative representatives to positively influence our state and encourage homeschooled youth to become politically engaged.\n\nMany will dismiss what the Bible says simply because they believe the Bible can’t be trusted in the arena of historical accuracy. Egyptian Chronology is the lynch pin for this. This seminar includes the latest in archaeology as it relates to Egyptian Chronology, and is a great help to those teaching early history.\n\nProbably the least understood of subjects in earth history is the Ice Age and how it fits into a biblical worldview. We’ll examine the evidence for an Ice age caused by the Genesis Flood, how it could fit into the period between Noah and Abraham, and reinforce confidence in what the Bible says historically.\n\nHow does a Christian effectively obtain a job in the modern world? After discussing the idea of “working in exile,” Ben and Bethany will delve into the design of a resume and its application toward obtaining a job, internship, or volunteer or ministry position. Also learn about the importance of concepts such as a cover letter, search engine optimization, and online job applications. This session is geared toward students but is applicable to job hunters of all ages!\n\nThe high school years offer a prime opportunity for parents to together with their teens to review and to evaluate their teens preparation for adulthood. They can determine a plan of action how to equip and solidify their teen’s beliefs, skills, and relational abilities necessary for future success and passionately following Christ. Whether male or female, single or married, specific training is necessary to be able to face the demands of these roles with confidence and ease.\n\nGet creative with your penmanship while learning practical uses for this artistic skillset. Participants will learn basic modern calligraphy techniques, receive instruction on artistic letter design, and be given calligraphy reference guides for use beyond the workshop. The goal of this workshop will be to create a hand-lettered scripture or hymn print. Workshop participants will have the opportunity to display their artwork in a gallery at the CH conference. While a prior knowledge of cursive writing is not necessary, it will prove helpful in this workshop. Anyone 9 years and older can register for one of the workshops. Pre-registration is required.\n\nCost per registrant – $5. Limit each workshop to 30 people"
