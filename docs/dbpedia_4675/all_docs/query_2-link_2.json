        "text": "Joan Bennett (February 27, 1910 - December 7, 1990) played Elizabeth Collins Stoddard, Naomi Collins, Judith Collins Trask, Elizabeth Collins Stoddard (PT), Flora Collins, and Flora Collins (PT) in the original Dark Shadows, as well as reprising her role of Elizabeth Collins Stoddard in the motion picture House of Dark Shadows.\n\nBiography[]\n\nPrior to Dark Shadows, she was a famous movie star, appearing in such notable films as The Woman in the Window, Scarlet Street, and Little Women. Unfortunately, in 1951 her then-husband Walter Wanger shot her agent in a jealous rage; the resulting scandal - tame by today's standards - virtually ended Joan's film career. Aside from TV movies, she made only seven more theatrical films.\n\nBennett came from a famous theatrical family. Her father was noted theatre matinee idol, Richard Bennett. She was one of three sisters. Constance Bennett was also a movie star, and for some time overshadowed her sister. The second sister, Barbara Bennett, married singer Morton Downey, Sr.; their son was the late controversial talk show host Morton Downey, Jr.\n\nJoan was very close with Dark Shadows costar, Louis Edmonds. They were the only two actors who appeared in both the first and final episodes of the original series. She was also famous for not taking herself too seriously - in a 1986 interview, for example, she said \"I don't think much of most of the films I made, but being a movie star was something I liked very much.\"\n\nAfter Dark Shadows, Bennett went on to act in other films, most notably Dario Argento's Suspiria. She also published her autobiography, The Bennett Playbill (written with Lois Kibbee) in 1970.\n\nJoan Bennett died of a heart attack on December 7, 1990 at age 80.\n\nAppearances[]\n\nElizabeth Collins Stoddard (264 episodes)[]\n\n1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 15, 16, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 26, 27, 29, 32, 33, 36, 38, 39, 41, 42, 44, 47, 48, 50, 51, 53, 54, 55, 56, 59, 63, 64, 65, 66, 70, 72, 73, 74, 76, 77, 80, 81, 84, 85, 86, 88, 89, 91, 93, 96, 97, 98, 104, 105, 107, 108, 111, 112, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 121, 127, 129, 130, 132, 134, 135, 140, 143, 144, 146, 150, 151, 152, 153, 155, 156, 158, 160, 191, 192, 194, 195, 196, 197, 198, 200, 201, 203, 205, 206, 208, 210, 211, 212, 213, 216, 218, 220, 223, 224, 228, 238, 242, 243, 244, 246, 249, 252, 254, 257, 259, 262, 266, 267, 268, 269, 270, 271, 272, 275, 277, 278, 280, 281, 282, 287, 298, 300, 301, 302, 324, 325, 326, 327, 330, 331, 335, 337, 338, 339, 348, 350, 354, 356, 364, 365, 461, 463, 467, 471, 473, 474, 491, 495, 501, 502, 504, 506, 513, 514, 516, 519, 520, 569, 570, 571, 576, 577, 603, 604, 610, 614, 617, 624, 625, 626, 629, 637, 638, 639, 641, 642, 644, 645, 646, 647, 648, 649, 650, 651, 652, 655, 671, 672, 679, 680, 681, 685, 686, 689, 691, 692, 694, 891, 894, 899, 902, 903, 904, 906, 907, 908, 910, 911, 913/914, 916, 917, 918, 929, 936, 941, 945, 946, 952, 956, 958, 963, 966, 968, 1071, 1073, 1074, 1080, 1086, 1088, 1089, 1094, 1095, 1198\n\nNaomi Collins (36 episodes)[]\n\n366, 367, 368/369, 376, 377, 382, 389, 390, 392, 393, 395, 397, 402, 407, 409, 413, 414, 415, 416, 424, 426, 432, 434, 438, 441, 444, 445, 446, 447, 448, 451, 452, 455, 456, 457, 458,\n\nJudith Collins (50 episodes)[]\n\n702, 703, 704, 705, 707, 709, 713, 714, 716, 717, 719, 722, 723, 725, 726, 733, 737, 739, 744, 746, 747, 750, 752, 758, 764, 765, 766, 767, 768, 771, 774, 775, 776, 777, 778, 784, 785, 788, 789, 790, 791, 861, 862, 863, 870, 878, 879, 880, 884\n\nElizabeth Collins Stoddard (PT) (18 Episodes)[]\n\n969, 970, 976, 977, 981, 983, 990, 1007, 1016, 1024, 1026, 1030, 1033, 1034, 1043, 1049, 1050, 1053\n\nFlora Collins (16 episodes)[]\n\n1086, 1111, 1117, 1123, 1126, 1149, 1151, 1152, 1163, 1164, 1167, 1171, 1176, 1179/1180, 1194, 1198\n\nFlora Collins (PT) (16 episodes)[]\n\n1188, 1194, 1198, 1199, 1201, 1204, 1209, 1210, 1211, 1212, 1215, 1220, 1226, 1227, 1228, 1234, 1240, 1245\n\nElizabeth Collins Stoddard[]\n\nHouse of Dark Shadows\n\n[]"
