        "text": "In This Article\n\nOrigin, Meaning, And History Of Joan\n\nJoan is the feminine version of the name John in the English-speaking world. On the other hand, in the Catalan-Valencian and Occitan languages, John is the masculine given name. In all instances, the name is descended from the Greek and Latin phrases Ioannes and Ioanna, making it cognate with John and connected to all of its many forms. John is a typical male given name in the English language that has its roots in Hebrew.\n\nThe Greek name Ioannes and its feminine variant Ioanna were the sources of the name, which spread worldwide into many languages and civilizations. It derives from the Hebrew word Yohanan, which means “Yahweh is Gracious,” just like John. Rarely the name Josephine, which is likely to be of Hebrew origin, is shortened to Joan. The Old French feminine variations of the male names Johannes, Johanne, and Jehanne brought the Anglosphere female name Joan into the English language.\n\nJoana is its feminine equivalent in these languages. Historical variants of John in medieval Portuguese included Joan and Joam. While Joana, like in Catalan and Occitan, continues to be the feminine form for Portuguese speakers, the Lusophone world later diverged and adopted Joao as its native form of the masculine John.\n\nThe most common spellings of this name are Jaana, Jana, Jane, Janet, Jan, Jean, Jeanne, Johanna and Johanne, Joanne, Juana, Juanita, Joana, Ivana, Jovana, and Jovanka. In the year 1932, a total of 21,045 infants were born under this name, which was the greatest reported usage from 1880 to 2018. The name “Joan” appeared 486,365 times in the SSA public database between 1880 and 2018. Twelve newborns were given the name for the first time in 1880.\n\nA fictitious character on the AMC television program Mad Men is named Joan P. Holloway Harris. She is played by Christina Hendricks, who earned nominations for Primetime Emmy Awards for her work.
