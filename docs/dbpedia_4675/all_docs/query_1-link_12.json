        "text": "Post by petrolino on\n\nThe Bennett Sisters\n\n\"The beautiful Bennett sisters were jewels of Hollywood's golden age. Born of an aristocratic, regal theatrical background, Joan and Constance Bennett had that special touch of class that shines so uniquely on screen. The daughters of stage matinee idol Richard Bennett and actress and literary agent Adrienne Morrison, were the fifth generation of actors on their mother's side of the family. The oldest sister Constance was born in 1904, middle sister Barbara, the least known of the three was born in 1906. Barbara Bennett, the mother of talk show host Morton Downey, Jr., had brief fame as a dancer and unfortunately led a basically unhappy life, never reaching the success of her sisters. The baby of the family Joan was born in 1910. Later Joan fondly recalled: \"With all of Constance's juggling of dates over the years, I started out as the youngest, then became her twin and finally wound up as the oldest sister.\"\n\nThe Bennetts were every bit as distinguished a theatrical family as the Barrymores and just as colorful. Richard Bennett was as known for his spirited antics as his close friends Lionel and John Barrymore. Bennett was famous for having battles with critics of the day and wrote scathing letters not only when they panned his performances but when they praised them as well. The entire Bennett family was known for their arguments with the press. Once during a well-publicized dispute, Joan had a de-scented skunk delivered to powerful Hollywood columnist Hedda Hopper. Hopper later gave the skunk to James and Pamela Mason as a companion for their cats, but not before christening it \"Joan.\". Her contemporaries were shocked that Joan had the nerve to do such a thing to Hopper, who it was thought had the power to make and break careers; however, Joan had no qualms about it.\"\n\n- Dana Di Mambro, 'The Glamorous Bennett Sisters'\n\nConstance Campbell Bennett (born October 22, 1904, New York City, New York, U.S.) {Libra}\n\nBarbara Jane Bennett (born August 13, 1906, Palisades Park, New Jersey, U.S.) {Leo}\n\nJoan Geraldine Bennett (born February 27, 1910, Fort Lee, New Jersey, U.S.) {Pisces}\n\n\"And then there's JOAN BENNETT. By 1977, the woman who was almost Scarlet O'Hara found herself delivering amazingly absurd dialogue in an Italian giallo film. Her career progression didn't happen all at once, to be sure. You don't go from being Fritz Lang's favorite leading lady to taking a supporting role in a movie like SUSPIRIA in a single bound. A combination of age and scandal closed a lot of doors for her as the '60s began. Her appearance in HOUSE OF DARK SHADOWS, a film that might accurately be called an \"American giallo,\" probably made her decision to appear in SUSPIRIA less difficult. None of this is to suggest that Bennett should have been ashamed or embarrassed by her appearance in SUSPIRIA. But, the 1970s introduced a new world of cinema, most of which probably looked alien to her, if not utterly offensive.\"\n\n- Cousin Barnabas, 'Dark Shadows : 50 Years'\n\n\"I thought it would be fun to do a film in Rome. It wasn't.\"\n\n- Joan Bennett on shooting 'Suspiria'\n\nRare clip of the Bennett Family at home :\n\n\"She dated Herman Wouk, Sidney Sheldon, Stan Kenton, Ralph Kiner, and Kirk Douglas, and turned down a marriage proposal from Ronald Reagan. Then, in 1955, she started seeing a rugged studio executive named Jennings Lang. “I was a swinging girl, but then I met Jennings, and he was a titan,” she said. “We had a fantastically successful marriage for forty years, which shocked everybody.” In his own swinging days, Lang had a notorious confrontation with the producer Walter Wanger, who was married to Joan Bennett. “Walter was a lunatic,” Monica Lewis said. “He thought Joan and Jennings were having an affair, so he followed them to a parking lot and shot Jennings. Everybody always said Walter shot him in the ball, but it wasn’t true. It was in the groin area—I saw the scar.” And were they having an affair? “I’m sure they were,” she said. “Big deal!”\n\nThough Lewis made eyes at Mickey Rooney in “The Strip” and Victor Mature in “Affair with a Stranger,” and got yelled at by both Charlton Heston and Lorne Greene in “Earthquake,” she never quite graduated from starlet to star. “Look at the wall,” she said, indicating a wall of photos. “The one in black, that’s when M-G-M wanted me to be a femme fatale like Lana Turner. I ran into Lana at Saks Fifth Avenue, and she told me, ‘I’m pregnant, and they’re scared sh*tless, and they’re trying to make you into me. Don’t do it. Be yourself!’ Well, it was tough. The next day, they dressed me up like Janie Powell, like a little girl”—she pointed to another photo, in which she looked exceedingly demure. “I never got to play a part I loved, a part where I wasn’t just somebody’s idea of t*ts and legs.”\n\nHer mood turned wistful. “The only one from my era who’s still around and still a friend is Tony Bennett.” She sang a snatch from “Cheek to Cheek,” which Bennett and Lady Gaga had performed at the Grammy Awards, her voice bright and warm and full of mischief. “Sinatra, who’d be a hundred this year, he’s gone. Peggy Lee is gone. Eydie Gormé is gone. Ava Gardner, one of my best friends, and Betty Bacall—we were in ‘Johnny 2 x 4’ together, and she had the measles—they’re gone.” Lewis folded her hands in her lap. Ten days later, she would die in her sleep.\"\n\n- Tad Friend, 'Monica Lewis ~ Hollywood Sunset' (writing in the New Yorker)\n\n\"The classic femme fatale had many attributes. She was always sexy. She was usually greedy. And she was never ever to be trifled with. All of that is bound up in our basic idea of the femme fatale, the beautiful dame with death at her back. What is perhaps less readily apparent is the reality that the noir goddess is usually the smartest person in the movie. She is wised up and cynical, and the men she leads to destruction are usually a few steps behind her. A lot of noirs, after all, end with the antihero finally figuring out what the femme fatale has known all along. She holds all the answers, however terrible those answers might be. Perhaps no one personified this quality better than Joan Bennett.\"\n\n- Jane Hinkson, 'Noir's Hard Luck Ladies'\n\nRare interview with Joan Bennett :\n\n\"Let's sing of Lamarr,\n\nThat Hedy so fair\n\nIs it true that Joan Bennett,\n\nWears all her old hair?\"\n\nPost by petrolino on\n\nIn Troy Szebin's labour of love ‘The Yellow Brick Road And Beyond’ (2009), musical directors Allan Arkush, John Badham and Rob Marshall join fans of ‘The Wizard Of Oz’ (1939) to revel in its songbook magic. Judy Garland was born Frances Ethel Gumm on 10th June, 1922 in Grand Rapids, Minnesota. She sang with her sisters Mary Jane Gumm and Dorothy Virginia Gumm as the Gumm Sisters. At the age of 16, Judy Garland played the role of Dorothy in ‘The Wizard Of Oz’, a role that propelled her to superstardom ...\n\nThe Gumm Sisters\n\nJudy Garland & Lana Turner\n\n\"I didn’t even know what a joint was when I made Goodbye Yellow Brick Road. That all changed when I made the next record, but in 1973 I was very naïve. And the naiveté is the most pleasant thing about this record, probably. On my first few albums, I didn't get to use my touring band. When I came to America in 1970, we’d been playing live for about a year or so in England and really doing the opposite to what the Elton John album was about. We played the same songs, but we played them in a completely rock n' roll style, piano, bass, and drums. When I did go to that momentous day at the Troubador in Los Angeles and I got the review from Robert Hilburn, it was a shock to people in the audience. They weren't expecting it, but that was how we were. I do think the band was a little wounded since they weren't on The Tumbleweed Connection or Madman Across The Water. It was important to me that they play on Goodbye Yellow Brick Road.\"\n\n- Elton John, Rolling Stone\n\n'Goodbye Yellow Brick Road'\n\n\"I was a huge Marilyn Monroe fan, as well as Elvis Presley. When you saw them, they looked like they came from another planet. In the Fifties when I had my hair cut and I first saw a picture of Elvis Presley in Life magazine, I thought, 'My God, who is this guy?' And with Marilyn Monroe, it’s like, 'That’s the most glamorous woman that’s ever been.' I mean, her and Elizabeth Taylor…There will never be two more glamorous people. And they kind of changed the world.\"\n\n- Elton John"
