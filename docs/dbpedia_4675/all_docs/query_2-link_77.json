        "text": "I am embarrassed to admit that, as a senior citizen, I know so little about Black history. Yes, I know that Blacks were slaves, that President Lincoln’s Emancipation Declaration freed them from slavery and that the country witnessed the civil rights movement, such as those in Selma, that brought attention to the plight of Black people in America. But, I didn’t know enough. In fact, what I don’t know far outweighs what I know.\n\nPeople have been taking to the streets in astounding numbers to protest police brutality, particularly in the death of George Floyd, murdered in cold blood on the streets of Minneapolis. Had we not seen the video of his death, many of us may not have been awakened to the social and political systems that have for centuries suppressed and frightened our Black brothers and sisters and the nightmares they have lived for centuries. As a white mother of five children, I have never had to have “the talk” to my children as to how to protect themselves from law enforcement when they are singled out. I can’t imagine that even President Obama had to have this talk with his girls. What kind of a world are we living in?\n\nYou may be outraged or in denial that our whiteness is described as white privilege. But it is real. We whites don’t normally think of ourselves as privileged, especially if we don’t have much or are not very affluent, but the fact is that the color (whiteness) of our skin protects us from a host of abuses, be they cultural economical, educational or political. If you don’t believe me, just sit down and talk to a Black person about their perspective on “white privilege.”\n\nIn an attempt to better understand the oppression of Black people, I decided to do a simple thing. I asked Google (on my smart phone) when did the first shipload of Black slaves come to America? Answer: in 1619, a British ship overcame a Portuguese ship with slaves and brought them to Virginia, some 20-plus slaves. I have since learned more from other readings as to when slaves were shipped to America.\n\nThe next question I asked was “why African slaves.” I was stunned by the answer: Black leaders sold their own people into slavery! What? How could that happen? Why did they do that? It appears that many countries purchased slaves from Africa. Can you imagine how it must have felt to the poor African people to be uprooted from their homes and sold into slavery and taken away from their homes and families? I can’t fathom that.\n\nSo here we are some 400 years later and Black people are still living in fear, no matter how deep or buried that fear is. Our country has thrived on Black labor, has benefitted from Blacks serving in the military and has enjoyed the contributions of Black scientists, doctors, teachers, journalists and more. It is far past time to put aside any prejudices and bigotries and recognize that we are all one people and that the color of our skin is only one aspect of our humanness. I hope to continue to learn more about Black history and learn how I can be a part of the solution to ethnic oppression.\n\nHow about you?\n\n— Joan Bennett/American Canyon"
