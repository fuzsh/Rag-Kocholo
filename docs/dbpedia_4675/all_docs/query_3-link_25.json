        "text": "biography\n\nBorn in Palisades, New Jersey, on February 27, 1910, glamorous actress Joan Bennett was the daughter of stage and screen actor Richard Bennett. Unlike her sister, actress Constance Bennett, she initially lacked an interest in performing onstage. However, when she divorced her first husband in the late 1920s, she turned to the family profession as a means to support her herself and her infant daughter. Surprisingly, Bennett found good roles quickly and became well known in a string of 1930s films. Bennett continued to work after her second marriage to writer Gene Markey and after giving birth to a second daughter. Filmgoers sometimes confused Joan Bennett with lookalike sister Constance Bennett, who was a bigger star in the 1930s. In 1938, at about the time Bennett's marriage to Markey ended, she dyed her blond locks black for a lead role in the comedy Trade Winds; this gave her an identity apart from her more-famous sister and transformed her career virtually overnight.\n\nLEFT: Late 1930s studio photo. CENTER: With sister Constance Bennett in the late 1930s. RIGHT: With Zachary Scott in a play bill photo for an off-Broadway production of Bell, Book, and Candle in the summer of 1953\n\nBennett remained a brunette for the rest of her life and became one of the 1940s most popular film noir femme fatales. Her best film noir titles include The Woman in the Window (1944; with Edward G. Robinson and Raymond Massey) and Scarlett Street (1945; with Edward G. Robinson). In 1940, she married her third husband, famed producer Walter Wanger, and the union produced two more daughters for Joan Bennett in 1943 and 1948. She continued starring in numerous films through the late 1940s. By the turn of the decade, Bennett was nearing 40 and getting too mature to play temptresses, so she began a transition to matrons in the comedies Father of the Bride (1950; with Spencer Tracy and Elizabeth Taylor) and Father's Little Dividend (1951; with Spencer Tracy and Elizabeth Taylor). Unfortunately, just at that time her career hit an icy patch when Bennett's husband Walter Wanger discovered Bennett was having an affair with her agent, Jennings Lang. In a jealous rage, Wanger shot Lang. Although Lang survived the injury, the ensuing scandal and resulting bad publicity cratered Bennett's film career. Joan Bennett had no screen work for three years until she was approached by Roger Corman to star as the villainous Mrs. Cummings in the excellent low-budget Allied Artists film noir release Highway Dragnet (1954; with Richard Conte and Mary Beth Hughes). Her acting career picked up somewhat later in the 1950s, mostly in television, but a big comeback would have to wait until the mid 1960s.\n\nthe films of joan bennett\n\nDisraeli (1929)\n\nWith George Arliss in the Warner Bros. sound feature Disraeli\n\nDoctors' Wives (1931)\n\nWith Minna Gombell, Warner Baxter, and Cecilia Loftus in the Fox drama Doctors' Wives\n\nTwo for Tonight (1935)\n\nWith Bing Crosby in the Paramount musical Two for Tonight\n\nThe Man in the Iron Mask (1939)\n\nFrom James Whale's The Man in the Iron Mask, one of Whale's last directorial efforts\n\nThe House Across the Bay (1940)\n\nWith George Raft in the early film noir vehicle The House Across the Bay\n\nThe Son of Monte Cristo (1940)\n\nWith George Sanders in the swashbuckler The Son of Monte Cristo\n\nNob Hill (1945)\n\nWith frequent co-star George Raft in the musical Nob Hill\n\nScarlett Street (1945)\n\nBennett as femme fatale Kitty March in Fritz Lang's Scarlett Street\n\nThe Macomber Affair (1947)\n\nFrom the United Artists release The Macomber Affair\n\nSecret Beyond the Door (1948)\n\nAs Celia Lamphere in Fritz Lang's film noir thriller Secret Beyond the Door\n\nThe Reckless Moment (1949)\n\nWith James Mason in Columbia's film noir feature The Reckless Moment\n\nFather of the Bride (1950)\n\nFrom the MGM comedy Father of the Bride.

She made a big comeback portraying the matriarch Elizabeth Collins Stoddard on ABC's popular 1966-1971 gothic horror soap opera Dark Shadows, which she stayed with for the entire run as well as for the film House of Dark Shadows (1970; with Jonathan Frid and Grayson Hall). After the show left the air, Bennett went into semi-retirement in the early 1970s, working infrequently. Her last theatrically released film was Dario Argento's cult classic horror flick Suspiria (1977; with Jessica Harper and Udo Kier). Sadly, Joan Bennett passed away on December 7, 1990, at the age of 80. She was survived by her fourth husband, four daughters, and thirteen grandchildren."
