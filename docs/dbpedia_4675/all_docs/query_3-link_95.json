        "text": "Joan Bennett, a native of Camden, passed away peacefully on November 18, 2023 at her home. She was 88 years old.\n\nJoan was born on December 6, 1934, the daughter of Albert “Foggy” Bennett and Neva (McDermott) Bennett. She graduated from Camden High School in the class of 1953. Shortly thereafter, she moved from Camden to Portland and lived at the YMCA and worked nights in a local restaurant. She went to Northeastern University days. The following year she moved to Quincy, Massachusetts, and worked nights as a car hop at a Howard Johnsons Drive In restaurant and days at the Granite Trust Company.\n\nIn 1957, she was employed by Merchants Bank of Boston where she worked for the next thirty years. She was initially hired as a Loan Closing Processor in the Real Estate Department and later was promoted to Assistant Vice President with the responsibility of establishing a Consumer Loan Department, which enabled the Bank to offer an entire line of new products. In 1982, she was promoted to Vice President of the Commercial Real Estate Division and was responsible for the administration and servicing of the Bank’s commercial and construction loan portfolio. She completed courses from the American Institute of Banking in the Consumer Loan Course and the Real Estate Appraisal Course 101.\n\nJoan was a member of the Greater Boston Builders Association, the Community Bank Club and the Young Executive Club. Joan also was a member of the Boston Rotary Club and served for two years on the Board of Directors. During this time, she was involved with the Cardinal Cushing School in Hanover, Massachusetts as a Big Sister.\n\nJoan retired in the early 1990s and returned to Camden in 1994 to be near her mother, whose health was failing. She immediately became involved in St. Thomas Episcopal Church where she had been baptized and confirmed and in her early years sang in the choir. Joan re-entered the parish and began her own ministry of servicing St. Thomas. She was a member of the Alter Guild for 20 plus years, served on the Vestry, the Care Committee and was a Receiving Treasurer. She worked on all of the summer and winter fairs, rummage sales and bake sales and was always ready to work in the kitchen on suppers or wherever she was needed. She also was called upon to do Oblations and serve as usher.\n\nJoan joined the Camden Garden Club in 1998 and served for eight years on the Board of Directors as the Club’s Tour Treasurer. Joan felt this was rewarding as monies from the garden tours all went back into the beautification of Camden and for high school scholarships. She was also a member and served on the Board of the Camden, Rockport Historical Society. Joan loved music and served as a volunteer for the Bay Chamber Concert Series. She also served the local food pantry, and the free “Soups On” program during the winter months on Wednesdays at the Congregational Church.\n\nJoan was a sports enthusiast and was always up for a good game of basketball or softball. She loved to dance, ski, roller skate, ice skate, bowl and more recently enjoyed watching golf and was a faithful Red Sox fan. She enjoyed reading good novels, playing the piano and would spend hours working on jig saw puzzles and going to the Pen Bay YMCA. In 2015, she discovered coloring for adults and found it very enjoyable and great for consuming idle time.\n\nShe was predeceased by her father, mother, and brother Albert Bennett and his wife Jane.\n\nShe is survived by her brother Roy Bennett and his wife Jeanne Call Bennett of Solana Beach, California; her sister, Mary Alice Yohe of Lewisberry, Pennsylvania; ten nieces and nephews and ten grandnieces and grandnephews; her furry companion, Cali, whom she loved dearly.\n\nThe family would like to thank all caregivers from Hospice, especially Donna and Brandy.\n\nA graveside service will be held Friday, December 1, 2023, at 11 a.m., at the Rockville Cemetery on Rt. 17, Rockport, where Joan will be laid to rest next to her mother.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, donations may be made in Joan’s name to the Camden Food Pantry, 128 Mt Battie Street Camden, Me 04843."
