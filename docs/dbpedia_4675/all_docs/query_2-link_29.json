        "text": "Joan Geraldine Bennett was an American stage, film, and TV actress. Starting from the silent era to the talkies, she acted in 78 films, besides several stage and television productions. Born in in a family of actors, she wasn’t interested in acting in the beginning, but later took-up acting to support herself and her child. She essayed a wide variety of characters, and is known more for her film noir glamorous roles in Fritz Lang movies, such as ‘Man Hunt,’ ‘The Woman in the Window,’ among others. Later, a scandalous event affected her career and Bennett turned towards stage and TV. She toured the nation with several stage productions and was nominated for an ‘Emmy Award’ for her performance in the long-running soap-opera, ‘Dark Shadows.’ She was an active member of ‘Hollywood Democratic Committee’ and ‘The Hollywood Anti-Nazi League.’ Bennett got married four times and had four daughters. She died of heart-failure at the age of 80."
