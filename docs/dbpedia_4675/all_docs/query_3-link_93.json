        "text": "It’s something to watch an actor play against type. Sometimes it’s a revelation, of unexpected depths and talents; as when Bette Davis, who’d been playing peroxided cuties in piffling comedies, blazed out like lightning in 1934’s Of Human Bondage, and a star was born.\n\nAnd sometimes it’s…weird. Take dashing, dynamic Errol Flynn attempting to submerge himself into cold-fish Soames Forsyte in That Forsyte Woman. What, our strutting, spirited Errol as a stiff? I mean, it’s…interesting, but—c’mon. Or James Cagney, that bred-in-the-bone city dweller, hangin’ out on the prairie as The Oklahoma Kid (which I wrote about here). Cagney’s own strut, his bounce, his thrumming walk, his bedroom eyes…they just don’t belong midst the sagebrush and tumbleweeds. And when saucy-eyed Kay Francis turned up as saintly Florence Nightingale in The White Angel (a performance I like), contemporary critics and audiences deemed her way miscast, unfortunately to Kay’s permanent career detriment.\n\nAs for Clark Gable’s portrayal of the Irish nationalist statesman Parnell…the less said, the better…\n\nAll this brings me to Paul Henreid in the 1948 B-noir Hollow Triumph. Suave, soft-spoken, genteel, with a dash of continental niceness setting hearts a-throb (but in a nice way), Henreid became famous as the swoonily nice-guy romantic lead in Now, Voyager—unhappily married and unable to leave his wife, he finds a little corner of illicit joy in Bette Davis’s spinster arms. His Mr.-Nice-Guy image was further burnished (or ossified) as the impossibly noble (and nice) resistance leader Victor Laszlo in Casablanca, fighting the good fight with Ingrid Bergman at his side—and, frankly, I always figured Bergman would end up with Henreid. The Production Code wouldn’t have allowed it any other way. A case of the Nice Guy finishing first (courtesy of Breen Office rules).\n\nMr.-Nice-Guy roles persisted, like a recurrent rash, in Henreid’s career. He’s a nice-guy medical student getting the bird from slutty waitress Eleanor Parker in the 1946 version of Of Human Bondage; he’s a nice-guy musician haplessly entwined in a weird love triangle with Bette Davis and a riotously scene-stealing Claude Rains in Deception (which I wrote about here); and he’s nice-guy composer Robert Schumann afflicted with seven kids and a touch of madness in Song of Love. Even as a pirate in The Spanish Main, Henreid is a nice pirate, turning to buccaneering only because he’s been shafted by the Spanish authorities, then battling corrupt politicians as well as honest-to-God nasty pirates (who, unlike Paul, like being nasty). It’s Victor Laszlo redux, just at sea with a cutlass and thigh-high boots.\n\nAt this point, I’m thinking, Paul Henreid must’ve been itching for a change…\n\nThat he found in the crime story Hollow Triumph. Per Eddie Muller’s TCM intro, Henreid acquired the film rights and brought the property to Eagle-Lion, a studio specializing in low-budget, independent movies (I wrote about one of them, a quirky little comedy called Out of the Blue). The film was essentially Henreid’s project, one he nurtured, produced, may even have partially directed. He plays an ex-con on the run from a casino owner he’s robbed, and, hiding out in the unaptly named City of Angels, hatches a plan to change his identity. The elaborate plot takes its time—Henreid’s hood doesn’t get started on his ruse until a half-hour in—which gives us leisure to watch Henreid settle in, develop his role, dig into the twists and angles of his character. One that takes him way beyond the familiar, friendly, and nice Paul Henreid persona.\n\nAnd Henreid’s part is different. No more Mr. Nice Guy here. Henreid’s just-released convict, Johnny Muller, is a cold-blooded sociopath who rejects flat out the warden’s offer of a chance at a “decent job and a nice life.” Nice lives were what Henreid’s nice film characters wanted. But Johnny wants action, sizzling hot and right from the grill. The friend who picks Johnny up while he’s still shaking prison dust off his used shoes has a floozy stashed in the car, so Johnny can right away catch up with what he’s been missing in stir. (What else are friends for?) Then it’s right away to Johnny planning his casino heist with his old thieving pals, who, much to Johnny’s dismay, are no longer looking for thrills. They only desire what’s safe and sure—one of them bragging how his work in a poker joint “even give[s] me free chips.” Everyone’s got one of those decent jobs and nice lives that, Johnny sneers, are “comfortable and crummy.” Crummy is not what Johnny’s been waiting for.\n\nBut it’s after the heist goes south, and a pair of un-nice contract killers are set on his tail, that Johnny encounters a guy (also played by Henreid) who happens to look just like him. A bizarre (and convenient) coincidence, but one which gives Johnny the idea to ‘disappear’ by becoming this fellow—to burrow so deeply into this other self, those stone-faced assassins will never sniff him out. And it’s here the film takes a K-turn and shifts gears, away from its man-on-the-run narrative into…something else. Now we watch Johnny meticulously plan, not a fast heist, but a slow takeover—of another person’s life. A plan that includes murder.\n\nYeah, I get it—Henreid’s going against type here. He’s stretching himself, he’s letting audiences see other facets of his talent. For the film’s first half Henreid enacts mean, snarling Johnny Muller, and during this half I kept thinking how off Henreid is. His dialogue—classic American movie-criminal argot, terse, slangy, punctuated by a fast, jabbing rhythm—doesn’t fit his voice or way of speaking. Henreid’s Austrian accent, his smooth, cultured tones, his almost musical intonation, jarred on my ear every time he uttered a slangy line. Phrases like “You guys,” “a good setup,” “Now listen,” “Hello, big boy!”, sound fake issuing from his mouth. Sure, the lines are fake—arch, clichéd, standardized. But when spoken by a Cagney or Garfield, in hard, quick voices born of American streets, distilling street life and essence in every breath, such lines achieve a stylized naturalness, a heightened urban cadence. Whereas Henreid’s own inflections sound not urban but urbane. At best he sounds like he’s slumming, at worst he sounds clueless. Had Henreid fallen into the cast-against-type trap—showing him not in a fresh light but out of his depth?\n\nBut it’s during the film’s second half, as we watch Johnny study his prey, one Victor Bartok, Consulting Psychologist (coincidentally, Johnny studied psychology in college)—learning about his life, taking on his mannerisms, copying his habits (such as compulsive chain-smoking), even incising into his cheek the scar that marks his double’s face (the film’s re-release title was The Scar)—that Henreid really does settle in, take control, and change into something different. And strangely—revelatory.\n\nThe thing about Victor Bartok, Consulting Psychologist (oh, how 1940s cinema loved Psychology), is that he’s, superficially, a typical Henreid film character—smooth, cultured, continental, marked by that soupçon of aristocratic reserve that marked Henreid’s own film persona. He’s even got that surface niceness, of polite behavior and good manners. And it’s something to watch Henreid/Johnny take on Bartok’s personality, see how he alters his walk (slightly stiff, body held in, head angled high), stance, and vocal inflections. It’s like watching Paul Henreid become…Paul Henreid. As if Henreid’s playing not just Johnny Muller’s double but his own doppelgänger—as if he stepped outside himself, clinically observed who he was, and then reassembled, and reabsorbed himself into—who he is.\n\nWith one big difference, which is (without revealing spoilers)—Victor Bartok really isn’t a nice fellow. Oh, he’s got all the exteriors. He’s courteous to strangers, he’s kind to his patients, he’s respectful to colleagues, he’s charming with his friends. Staff and associates like him, friends enjoy him, patients trust him. You can imagine how anyone who knows Bartok, in that shallow, trivial, unintimate way we tend to know most people, would say—oh, that Dr. Bartok, he’s such a nice fellow. Without bothering to know much else. But as I watched, I could sense something odd in Bartok, an offness in him, which Henreid/Bartok lets us see—letting us know, with small gestures, glances, tones, that this fine fellow isn’t what he seems.\n\nAs we watch Henreid/Johnny take on this ‘new’ persona—as if it is wholly new and revelatory (note Johnny’s look of wonder when listening to Bartok’s patients confess their small, not-nice feelings in therapy sessions), see him adjust to sudden changes and surprises (such as a previously unknown Bartok girlfriend), and then absorb and sink into this entity represented to the world as one Victor Bartok—you see more than Henreid’s double act. You see what it reveals of the human personality—how persons present plausible exteriors of themselves, constructing them as an actor does a role. You’re reminded of that cliché, of not knowing people until you walk in their shoes (Johnny does it literally), but you also realize…that knowledge is a process, one that may never end. So much of who we are, our layers, accretions, character strata, can only be revealed and understood as one reveals an unknown civilization in archeological digs—slowly unearthing levels we, in our own skins, may never fully comprehend, even to our own Selves.\n\nThe film itself is similarly layered, braiding in several narrative strands, each unfolding new facets of the Johnny/Bartok saga. Chief is that of Evelyn, Bartok’s secretary and quondam lover, who also falls in love, separately, with Johnny, and whom Johnny uses to access Bartok’s home and files. As played (superbly) by Joan Bennett, Evelyn is, seemingly, the echt noir dame: Cool, sarcastic, hard; one who’s been around the block and seen all the angles. But Johnny gets to her, gets past her defenses, to where she wonders if they could make “a nice, decent life together.” (There’s that word…) His callous rebuff breaks her, like an egg, exposing the raw, hard-bitten—and bitter—woman beneath. “It’s a bitter little world,” is her (and the film’s) famous line, and Bennett delivers it with a slicing edge, of one who knows her secret dream—husband, family, home—has become, as per the title, a mere hollow triumph. With only bitterness left to savor.\n\nLike co-star Henreid, Joan Bennett also underwent a film-career change. Starting out, as had Davis, playing pert, blonde, “dewy-eyed heroine[s],” she then (with a dye job) emerged in film noir “as one of the more memorable of the species femme fatale.” Unlike Henreid, though, Bennett in film noir was the real thing. She had a gut feeling for such fatal dames, in classics like The Woman in the Window and (especially) Scarlet Street, portraying lethal sirens who are poison-dipped wet dreams, offering a fast ticket to nowhere. Yet her Evelyn in Hollow Triumph shows us something different but equally noir—a weary, disillusioned woman, who can’t find a good man, who knows there’s none to be found, and, hell, who’s not getting any younger. Like a subtle theme in a musical composition, Evelyn reveals to us another slant, an unexpected angle, one Johnny can’t figure: What is the good life? What is the big score, the final payoff, that leads to the nice, decent way to live? That Johnny can’t find the answer reveals what a bitter little world it is indeed."
