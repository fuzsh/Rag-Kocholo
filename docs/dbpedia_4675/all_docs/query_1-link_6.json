        "text": "The Film Noir Odyssey\n\nWriter: Herb Meadow and Jerome Odlum\n\nStory: U.S. Andersen and Roger Corman\n\nDirector: Nathan Juran\n\nCast: Richard Conte, Joan Bennett, Wanda Hendrix\n\nCinematography: John J. Martin\n\nMusic: Edward J. Kay\n\nStudio: Allied Artists\n\nRelease: January 27, 1954\n\nI have a real weakness for movies like “Highway Dragnet.” It’s preposterous, but that’s okay. And at 70 minutes, it knows it’s not here for a long time, but here for a good time.\n\nRichard Conte stars as Korean war vet Jim, who is in Vegas to visit a friend but gets in a flirt fight (I hate it when that happens) with a former model (Mary Beth Hughes, nailing her cameo) who ends up strangled dead by a strap of some kind in the morning (I hate it when that happens). Jim is clearly suspect number one, and since his buddy is apparently off on a secret mission now, he escapes from custody and hitches a ride with photographer Mrs. Cummings (Joan Bennett), her model Susan (Wanda Hendrix) and Mrs. Cummings’ mysteriously leash-less dog Tiger. Meanwhile, the cops close in as Susan develops almost instant Stockholm Syndrome and falls in love with Jim.\n\nLogic questions remains after the film ends. If Jim has a meeting set with his undercover friend two days from now at his old house, why doesn’t he just tell the cops that? How can there be quicksand over concrete? And why doesn’t Mrs. Cummings’ very white dress ever get dirty, no matter how long they spend stranded in the desert? Do these questions really matter much while you’re watching the movie? Well… yes… but it’s easy enough to overlook them because the movie is instantly on to the next thing.\n\nAnd in case you weren’t able to connect the strap that killed the model with the leash that is mysterious missing from Tiger’s neck (the poor dog is felled by a car on the highway moments after its introduction. RIP.), then the fact that Joan Bennett is in a role that is otherwise throwaway for most of the running time should clue you in to who the real murderer is. And yes, it’s a BIG coincidence that Jim hitches a ride with her, but noir is all about fate, so whatever. Just smile and go with it.\n\nThe screenplay is filled with quirk and fun character moments. My favorite is how Mrs. Cummings communicates to a hotel owner (Harry Harvey, who is fantastic) that a fugitive is in his midst, and the owner then rushes into his lobby telling everyone that the killer is there… but they should remain calm and not tell anyone. I was in stiches, but even moreso when Jim corners him and he nervously calls him “Mr. Strap.” There are two credited writers and two credited for the story (including Roger Corman’s first movie credit), and they keep things moving at a good clip. I especially love them setting the final showdown in a half-submerged house at the Salton Sea.\n\nConte is quite good, especially in the early scenes where he is sparring with various police officers and detectives. His moments with Reed Hadley as a Lieutenant who assumes his guilt especially crackle – the men have fantastic chemistry with one another. Bennett has almost nothing to do for most of the running time, and doesn’t even try to elevate the material, which she clearly could have. I wouldn’t go so far as to say that she seems to be eyeing the craft services table that is just offscreen, but I wouldn’t put it past her. Then again, when her final moment involves her standing in waist deep water claiming she’s being sucked into quicksand, I don’t blame her. Hendrix is really, really good and clearly having fun, but despite her ample sparks with Conte can’t quite sell her character’s sudden obsession with him.\n\nThe director is journeyman Nathan Juran, who started out as an art director before segueing into directing the excellent horror programmer “The Black Castle” and several wild sci-fi flicks with names like “The Deadly Mantis” and “Attack of the 50-Foot Woman.” He also collaborated a few times with the legendary Ray Harryhausen on movies like “The 7th Voyage of Sinbad” and “20 Million Miles to Earth.” His strength here is exploiting the various settings for everything they’re worth, like Vegas in the opening, the resort in the middle and that half-drowned house at the finale. There’s an odd moment in the house where part of the frame seems drawn on in front of an actor for no reason – was there a mic in frame somewhere?\n\nIf you approach “Highway Dragnet” as a serious film, you’ll loathe it. But if you put your tongue firmly in its cheek, you’ll have a rollicking good time. This is the type of movie you put on at 10 p.m. when you’re a little tipsy but not quite ready to go to bed. And I mean that as a compliment.\n\nScore: ***1/2\n\nThe Film Noir Odyssey\n\nWriter: Silvia Richards\n\nStory: Rufus King\n\nDirector: Fritz Lang\n\nCast: Joan Bennett, Michael Redgrave, Anne Revere, Barbara O’Neil\n\nCinematography: Stanley Cortez\n\nMusic: Miklos Rozsa\n\nStudio: Universal\n\nRelease: December 24, 1947\n\nFritz Lang is one of the master storytellers in all of film history – a man with more masterpieces to his name than just about any director not named Akira Kurosawa, Charlie Chaplin or Martin Scorsese. At this point in Lang’s career, he was far from the uber-budgeted productions he made in Germany like “Metropolis,” but was still producing and directing studio films with good casts and production values, even if some were low budget. “Secret Beyond the Door” was made between his masterpiece “Scarlet Street” and the very good “House by the River,” both of which feel like Lang movies through and through. So what do I make of this terrible movie, one that rips off at least four Alfred Hitchcock films freely and quite obviously. It doesn’t feel like something Lang would put his name on and, though it is visually resonant, that can’t make up for the shitty story and shittier casting choices at play here.\n\nJoan Bennett plays some idiot called Celia, a rich woman who has put off marriage through ten (!) engagements, only to have sexy eyes made at her one day in Mexico by penniless architect Mark (Michael Redgrave). The two are married immediately, but Celia just-as-immediately realizes her husband is a terrible person and may in fact be a murderer. She returns to his gigantic home, where she meets his seemingly normal sister Caroline (Anne Revere), the clearly psycho housekeeper Miss Robey (Barbara O’Neil) and his teenage son David (Mark Dennis). Despite having no money, Mark “collects rooms” in his home… buying all the contents from rooms where famous murders took place and recreating them exactly as they were after the killings. But there’s one room in that hallway hidden behind a locked door… what could be inside? Spoiler: it’s Celia’s room, and Mark wants to kill her!\n\nIn case you are playing Hitchcock bingo, here we go. Celia marries Mark on a whim and then suspects he’s going to kill her, just like “Suspicion.” She’s now the lady of a gigantic home run by a woman who is unstable and ultimately burns it all down, just like “Rebecca.” Celia wants to fix Mark by figuring out the root cause of his psychological problems, just like “Spellbound.” There’s a long sequence of Celia trying to get her hands on an important key, just like “Notorious.” I’m honestly surprised screenwriter Silvia Richards (“Ruby Gentry”) didn’t find a way to wedge “Lifeboat” somewhere in there too. Does the movie manage to transcend any of the warmed-over tricks and storylines from those Hitchcock films? No. And that’s a really low bar, considering I dislike “Suspicion” and “Spellbound.”\n\nThe one good scene in the movie comes early, when Celia is on vacation in Mexico and witnesses two men fighting to the death over a woman. The crowd runs, not wanting to be hurt, but she stays and watches – barely flinching when an errant thrown knife impacts the table right next to her. In fact, Celia looks completely turned on when this happens. The scene goes a long way to show that danger makes her horny, which allows the viewer to put up with her idiotic behavior concerning her husband up to a certain point.\n\nThat said, Mark is clearly fucked up in a way that isn’t going to be fixed. He hates women and mentions it almost every time the script gives him a chance. Even grosser, the movie explains away his want to murder Celia with the excuse that women domineered him all his life… and the only evidence of that I can see onscreen or spoken in dialogue is that they voice their opinion out loud every now and then, which is apparently way too much for Mark to take. Celia’s first experience seeing Mark and his son together is to watch Mark berate the young boy for nothing in particular and then slap him in the face. She barely blinks when this happens. And, to be clear, Mark genuinely is going to murder Celia and plans the murder for weeks, prepping his murder room to look exactly like Celia’s bedroom. But when he walks in with a cloth in his hands to strangle her, she decides not to run and instead psychoanalyze him. Yes, you read that last sentence right… even with the knowledge that he wants to murder her in cold blood and has been plotting for weeks, she still wants to stay with him! And, spoiler alert for the final scene, she does just that! In the immortal words of Whoopi Goldberg: “Molly, you in danger, girl.”\n\nAnd how does the extraordinary Bennett handle a stupid character whose decisions are impossible to act? The answer is “not well.” She has much too strong of a presence for such a weak person, and you keep expecting her to kick ass and take charge of the situation. It’s a terrible miscasting, but not as bad as Redgrave, who is heinous here. He’s not terrifying at all and looks like he could be felled by a simple punch to the arm, and his sexual energy (which is played up through Celia’s voiceover) is nonexistent. He’s a vaguely handsome wet blanket, nothing more. The supporting cast of Revere, O’Neil and Lovey Howell as the doddering aunt do their best to make things interesting… but there’s not much you can do to patch the Titanic, unfortunately.\n\nLang works well enough with Cinematography Stanley Cortez (“The Night of the Hunter”), despite Lang saying after the fact that Cortez couldn’t achieve the shots he wanted. There are some glorious atmospheric sequences in hallways, and the climactic fire is well rendered. But those murder rooms that are so important to the plot never look like anything other than a boring empty room with a few bloodstains… whoops.\n\nI’m actually not sure how much I should blame Lang for the film. Apparently Universal was very unhappy with his first cut and hired an outside director (I’m not sure who) to reshoot most of it. Though Lang was ultimately allowed to come in and reinsert his vision into the final cut, who knows how much actually was him and how much was the other guy. Whatever the case, Lang dislikes “Secret Beyond the Door” with a passion in every interview I read, and I can’t say that I disagree with him.\n\nScore: *\n\nThe Film Noir Odyssey\n\nWriter: Dudley Nichols\n\nBased on “The Bitch” by Georges de La Fouchardiere\n\nDirector: Fritz Lang\n\nCast: Edward G. Robinson, Joan Bennett, Dan Duryea\n\nCinematography: Milton R. Krasner\n\nMusic: Hans J. Salter\n\nStudio: Universal Pictures\n\nRelease: December 28, 1945\n\nPercent Noir: 80%\n\nIn my other articles covering noir films directed by Fritz Lang, I often discuss how Lang likes to find interesting twists on the established formula for the genre. The femme fatale with a soul in “Clash by Night.” The gullible hero who is smarter than he looks in “Human Desire.” And so on. But then we come to “Scarlet Street,” in which all the filmmakers seemed to approach the project desiring to make the ultimate film noir… even though they had no idea the genre even existed yet. The gullible hero is such a pushover that his ineptitude is stunning. The femme fatale is the epitome of a sociopath. And the ending is pitch black – perhaps the darkest in a genre of endings where hope is snuffed out on a regular basis.\n\nEdward G. Robinson stars as the unhappily married banker unfortunately named Christopher Cross. One night on his way home from a party, he happens upon Kitty (Joan Bennett) being accosted by her snake of a boyfriend Johnny (of course his name is Johnny), played by Dan Duryea. Christopher thinks it’s a robbery (and doesn’t see Johnny’s face) so he grabs a policeman. Kitty thanks him for “saving” her, allows him to take her out to dinner, and before you know it Christopher is paying for a new wardrobe, a new apartment and is taking great care to paint her toenails.\n\nSpeaking of painting, Christopher paints as a hobby and lies to Kitty that he’s a well-respected artist. His art is interesting, but he admits that it needs perspective (Get it? He needs perspective too! Could it be any more obvious?). Johnny steals several paintings to try to sell on the street, and several high-profile art dealers take interest, so Johnny lies and says that Kitty is the artist. When Christopher finds out, he goes along with it because, as previously established by every sentence in this recap, he is the worst. Before you know it, things are spiraling out of control, Christopher is killing Kitty with an ice pick in a jealous rage and Johnny is put to death for the murder. But Christopher’s conscience won’t let him escape cleanly, and the guilt ruins him in every way possible.\n\nWhy did Lang want to make this movie… and why make it so pitch black? I suspect the answer has a lot to do with his previous film “The Woman in the Window.” The films share many similarities in story, including the interest in artwork. But they also share several of the same filmmakers: Lang & cinematographer Milton R. Krasner behind the camera, and Robinson, Bennett & Duryea in front of the camera, all playing variations on the same role in both.\n\n“Woman in the Window” wasn’t as savage as “Scarlet Street.” Robinson’s character in that one had some smarts and Bennett’s femme fatale had a conscience. It’s a very good film until the end, where the production code refused the original dark finale and insisted it be replaced with an “it’s only a dream” twist that all but hobbles the entire movie.\n\nIt’s easy to see Lang responding to this with a big old “fuck you” and then deciding to take all the best aspects of the previous film but triple down on all the darkness. He got the rights to a French novel whose title is literally translated as “The Bitch.” He made sure he could pull everything he wanted to do off by being one of the main producers here, and somehow got the Production Code to okay allowing Christopher to get away with the murder at the end.\n\nThe results are, quite simply, stunning. It’s Lang’s best American film by a wide margin and ranks among the masterpieces in his entire filmography, one that includes achievements like “M,” “Metropolis” and “The Testament of Dr. Mabuse.”\n\nAll this even though you actively hate all three main characters throughout the film. Christopher is such a pushover. Kitty is so lazy. Johnny is so brutal. And yet you can’t look away from the trio any time they are onscreen. Lang used his history with the trio of actors to fine tune their performances – they may be terrible, but they are always interesting.\n\nYou also get the feeling that you are watching the filmmakers get away with something wicked – there are moments of tremendous viciousness where you can’t believe the writer and director have managed to get it through the censors. I’m trying to think of a murder more brutal during this time period than when Christopher stabs Kitty to death in a jealous rage, and I’m coming up empty. We see Kitty pull her silken blanket over her head in the same shot as Christopher picks up an ice pick, and Lang simply sets the camera down in a medium shot, showing Christopher stab the blanket savagely over and over while Kitty screams and writhes in pain under it. The moment would be savage even in today’s films, though they would probably add a smattering of blood.\n\nIf you want to introduce someone to the genre of film noir, you can’t do much better than “Scarlet Street.” It’s right up there with “Detour,” “The Postman Always Rings Twice” and “Double Indemnity” as movies that perfectly encapsulate everything excellent about this world of darkness and shadows. All of the stars in this film went on to give great performances in other noirs, but their work here is the ideal encapsulation of the three “types” you can find in this genre of film. Add in some foot fetishizing, a bunch of venetian blinds and a bloody ice pick and you have a great movie.\n\nScore: *****\n\nThe Film Noir Odyssey\n\nWriter: Mel Dinelli, Robert E. Kent, Henry Garson & Robert Soderberg\n\nBased on “The Blank Wall” by Elisabeth Sanxay Holding\n\nDirector: Max Ophuls\n\nCinematographer: Burnett Guffey\n\nMusic: Hans J. Salter\n\nCast: Joan Bennett, James Mason, Geraldine Brooks\n\nRelease: December 29, 1949\n\nStudio: Columbia\n\nPercent Noir: 80%\n\n“The Reckless Moment” was dumped right after Christmas in 1949 by Columbia with no fanfare. The reviews ranged from indifferent to scathing – with professional asshole Vincent Canby from The New York Times gleefully revealing the finale in his panning of the film. Even James Mason, who was good friends with the director Max Ophuls, said the movie was bad. And as for Ophuls, the film was the last straw that sent him back to France, where he would subsequently make several masterpieces, including “The Earrings of Madame de…,” which is often considered one of the best films of all time.\n\nThe movie languished, even after film critics reassessed it after realizing that Ophuls was a genius. Columbia chose not to release it on any of the Film Noir box sets, nor as mainstream physical release. I’m a huge fan of Ophuls, and I could only find it by buying a $40 DVD from Korea. So was it worth it?\n\nYes. Yes, it was.\n\n“The Reckless Moment” is, in many ways, unlike any other film noir I have ever seen. Ophuls takes chances with his visuals and soundtrack which are completely unexpected. The storyline isn’t the norm for noir… and yet the film still retains that specific mood one desires from this genre.\n\nThe great Joan Bennett stars here as Lucia, matriarch of the Harper family who is trying to keep it together while her husband is in a different country for weeks or months at a time for work. Her father-in-law (Henry O’Neill) and her son David (David Blair) are already a handful, but her big problem of late has been her daughter Bea (Geraldine Brooks). 17-year-old Bea is dating an older gross guy named Darby (Shepperd Shrudwick, appropriately oily), and seems determined to destroy her own life. “Mother, can’t you trust me?” Bea asks while sitting in a robe, her legs wide open. Lucia obviously saw “Mildred Pierce” and knows she’s got to cut this shit off pronto, but later that night Bea handles it herself when she gets some sense and breaks it off with Darby.\n\nEnd of movie? Nope. The next morning Lucia discovers Darby’s body impaled on an anchor on the beach (he fell on it), assumes her daughter did it and goes into full-on beast mode, disposing of the body like a boss. But then a man named Martin (James Mason) shows up with Bea’s love letters to Darby… wouldn’t it be awful if the police got these? Martin insists on $5000, which is way too much for Lucia even if she has a maid, several cars and a boat. But then an odd thing happens – Martin almost immediately falls head over heels for Lucia. He wants to call the whole thing off, but his blackmailing partner Nagel (Roy Roberts) isn’t going to give in… no matter what it takes.\n\nBennett was beloved by foreign directors who came to America, working with Ophuls, Jean Renoir and multiple times with Fritz Lang. They understood the balance between her hardness and softness much better than any of her American directors, who often reduced her either to the “bitch” role or made her lean too hard on her softness, forgetting what makes her interesting as a performer. This is the best performance from her I’ve seen – watching as she bravely attempts to keep her shit together in front of her family as her entire life implodes around her is watching a master in full control of her craft. I doubt many other actresses could pull off the long, dialogue-free sequence where Lucia discovers the body and, without missing a beat, begins to plot how to dispose it and save her family, but Bennett excels here.\n\nAnd about that sequence – Ophuls makes the brilliant decision here to drop all the music, leaving the film silent except for sound effects. With no guiding notes telling us how to react to the situation, the results are excruciatingly suspenseful to watch… the maestro is telling us that anything could happen at any moment by refusing us a fundamental building block of filmmaking that usually guides our feelings.\n\nAnd that’s just one of his many genius touches here. Anyone who has heard of him knows that Ophuls keeps the camera in motion constantly, and this film is no exception. Here the movement is purposeful, keeping in step with Lucia as it follows her through her day, watching her react first to normal problems and later with extraordinary ones. His collaboration with cinematographer Burnett Guffey (“My Name is Julia Ross,” “Scandal Sheet”) also deserves mention. There is an amazing single-take shot that follows Lucia from the kitchen/dining room area of her home, which is warm with bright lights and the love of her family, into the sudden shadows of the dark living room where Martin waits to explode her life that is simply astonishing. It’s one of my favorite shots in all noir, creating the perfect metaphor for her frame of mind.\n\n“The Reckless Moment” is also interesting in how forthright it is about its characters’ feelings. One of the hallmarks of noir is the grey area that holds most of its characters’ motivations. Does she really love him? Is he plotting to kill him? How much can we trust her? But here, everyone just spells out everything. Bea doesn’t hide her love of the asshole. Lucia is honest about not being able to get the money. Martin bluntly states early and often that he has fallen for Lucia. This miraculously works in the story’s favor because it often causes more complications for our hero.\n\nMason has a difficult needle to thread in his performance… appearing at first menacing and villainous to us before turning on a dime and becoming a tragic romantic hero. Thank God Mason is Mason, because I don’t think any other actor except possibly Ray Milland could have pulled this off. But Mason made a career of these inherently flawed, good at heart men. He’s not quite as good here as he is in “A Star is Born,” but he comes close.\n\nThe film isn’t perfect… it feels much longer than its 80 minute running time, thanks primarily to a section in the middle where Lucia attempts to raise the $5000 herself. While wearing a mink coat (because of course), Lucia wanders from bank to loan company to pawnbroker. The scenes are all quiet, devoid of tension and these visits would have been much better suited as a montage.\n\nRegardless, this is essential noir. Ophuls brings a bunch of new toys to the game and goes out of his way to reframe and create new permeations of the crime genre in every scene. He was perfectly matched with Bennett and Mason, and I only wish he had more films noir once he returned to France.\n\nScore: *****\n\nThe Film Noir Odyssey\n\nWriter: Frank Davis, Jean Renoir, adaptation by Michael Hogan\n\nBased on the novel “None So Blind” by Mitchell Wilson\n\nDirector: Jean Renoir\n\nCinematographer: Leo Tover, Harry J. Wild\n\nMusic: Hanns Eisler\n\nCast: Joan Bennett, Robert Ryan, Charles Bickford\n\nRelease: June 7, 1947\n\nStudio: RKO Radio Pictures\n\nPercent Noir: 70%\n\n“The Woman on the Beach” is one of those many films that is more notable for its behind-the-scenes happenings than anything in the movie itself. RKO had famously made director/co-writer Jean Renoir reshoot somewhere between a third and half of the film after a disastrous preview audience laughed derisively at the first cut.\n\nThe story concerns a veteran named Scott (Robert Ryan) who is suffering from PTSD after some sort of naval disaster. He’s engaged to Eve (Nan Leslie), but finds himself attracted the mysterious dame of the title, Peggy (Joan Bennett), who is married to Tod (Charles Bickford). Tod was one of the most in-demand painters in the world, but after Peggy accidentally blinded him, he is now incapable of doing what he loves. Peggy and Scott begin an affair, but Scott suspects that Tod may not be as blind as he seems.\n\nIt’s all fairly straightforward noir storytelling, with Tod’s suspect blindness an interesting wrinkle. This should be a grand slam for all involved – Bennett is best in dark noir turns (“The Woman in the Window,” “The Reckless Moment”), and Ryan would go on to give great performances both as a homewrecker (“Clash by Night”) and an emotionally vulnerable alpha male (“The Set-Up”). Renoir, of course, is one of the greatest directors of all time (“Grand Illusion,” “The River”), and his French noir prototype “The Bitch” was remade in America by Fritz Lang as the masterpiece “Scarlet Street,” which just happened to star Joan Bennett.\n\nBut “The Woman on the Beach” doesn’t work.\n\nSure, there are a few outlier critics who keep trying to insist that this is some undervalued masterpiece and one of the best portraits of an imploding marriage ever placed on film — but they obviously are watching a different movie called “The Woman on the Beach.” Most historians and critics place all the blame squarely on executives at RKO – they never quite write “Everything bad about the movie was forced in by RKO and everything good was put in against RKO’s will by Renoir,” but they might as well have. That’s a fun narrative. It’s easier to blame faceless execs, despite the fact that RKO was, on a regular basis, producing the best crime films in the industry and were, on the whole, very supportive of their filmmakers. The truth is probably somewhere in between, with everyone genuinely doing what they thought was best to make a good movie… and not succeeding.\n\nWatching the film is an odd experience, because you can feel both points of view pushing and pulling right in front of you. Renoir wanted to bookend the film with fire and water, but upend expectations, with the water in the opening representing destruction and the fire at the end representing rebirth. And the execs obviously looked at Ryan’s non-chemistry with Bennett and panicked, forcing Hanns Eisler’s score to be so loud in certain sections it overwhelms everything around it.\n\nAnd, to the movie’s credit, there are a couple very good things about it. Ryan’s maritime nightmare sequence, which opens the movie, is dripping with great imagery (no pun intended). And despite not being able to sell the affair with Ryan, Bennett still gives a very good performance as a possible femme fatale – the camera loves her cold features and I loved how you could never quite get a handle on when she was lying and when she was telling the truth. Finally, there’s a scene between Peggy and Tod where Tod admits that, no matter how old the couple gets, he’ll always think of Peggy as a young, beautiful woman from the moments before he went blind.\n\nMost everything else, though? Yikes.\n\nFirst, Ryan does not give a good performance – he is unable to sell the drama of someone recovering from a trauma, and his interactions with Bennett are devoid of any heat or romance, despite Bennett trying hard. Was his frustration at having to reshoot all of his romantic scenes coming through in the finished product? Perhaps.\n\nSecond, the dialogue throughout is atrocious. Bennett somehow manages to sell most of her lines, but even she can’t pull off the following exclamation at her husband: “I wish I’d never heard of painting! Or artists!” Oooh, you tell him, girl. In another scene, Tod shows off his paintings, dropping this none-too-subtle exposition bomb: “They’re safe here, just as long as I’m alive.” Film noir really needs crackling dialogue, and all we get here are vacant babblings.\n\nThere are many other inane moments sprinkled throughout, none more inadvertently laughable as the one where Scott (who still suspects Tod isn’t blind), leads the guy off a cliff. It’s almost as funny as the follow-up moment where Tod forgives Scott and insists that the near-murder is perfect evidence that the two should become besties.\n\nIn case you can’t tell, it’s impossible to relax and surrender to the storytelling. Every time there’s a genuinely good moment, it’s undercut by three moments that just don’t work. I haven’t even brought up the unfortunate Eve subplot, which takes up probably a quarter of the movie’s running time, but is so useless that you find yourself forgetting it exists the second Renoir cuts away to anything else.\n\nDespite being only 71 minutes, I’m struggling to come up with a valid excuse for you to watch the movie. All the creators did better work elsewhere that definitely deserve your attention before this. Perhaps “The Woman on the Beach” is best forgotten, a footnote in the careers of all involved and nothing more. What a shame.\n\nScore: **\n\nThe Film Noir Odyssey\n\nWriter: Nunnally Johnson\n\nBased on the “Once Off Guard” novel by J.H. Wallis\n\nDirector: Fritz Lang\n\nCinematographer: Milton R.

But something has always bugged me about the fact that Paste Magazine counts it as the best noir of all time in a list I’m not going to bother to link to… which is weird because I don’t normally care much about rankings (let’s face it: their only use is to legitimize the status of newer films and inform the new generation of important, great older films). Perhaps part of this is because it is so obviously a warm-up for Fritz Lang/Edward G. Robinson/Joan Bennett’s second go-round with noir in the following year’s “Scarlet Street,” which I consider to be a masterpiece.\n\nAnd yeah, I’m pretty sure a lot of it has to do with that fucking cop out ending.\n\nBut we’ll get there when we get there. First, the set-up: Robinson plays Richard Wanley, a seemingly content middle-aged professor who sends his wife and kids off to vacation before finding himself drawn to a painting of a pretty woman that is posted (wait for it) in a window. When Richard runs into the real version of the woman, whose name is Alice (Bennett), they end up back at her swanky apartment, but before anything too pre-code can happen, Alice’s other lover shows up and becomes hysterical, forcing Richard to stab him to death with scissors in self-defense. They dispose of the body and promise never to contact one another again, but things are complicated when Richard realizes the dead man was a person of importance, and Richard’s best friend, a district attorney named Frank (Raymond Massey) is investigating the crime. Things get more complicated when straw-hat wearing Heidt (Dan Duryea) begins blackmailing Alice. It gets delightfully dark, with Richard committing suicide while Alice concurrently finds Heidt’s dead body and desperately tries to contact him to let him know they are free…\n\n… and then it all turns out it was a dream. A fucking dream.\n\nFucking Hays code.\n\nThe movie doesn’t even play fair with its twist ending – often going outside Richard’s point-of-view over the course of the movie with long scenes of which he knows little or nothing. That said, it does marginally pay off the film’s Freudian thematic material… but if I’m very honest, the introduction of that material isn’t handled well in the first act either. Richard is hanging out with Frank and another friend in a swanky club (the kind of place where you can tell a rando employee to wake you up at 10:30 and they actually will) and Frank spoon-feeds “Richard” i.e. the audience some atrocious exposition about what type of person he is and why he behaves the way he does etc. This is AFTER like a two-sentence opening, which I’m betting was a Hays Code addition, of Richard in his classroom saying self-defense means murder is okay.\n\nBut while the exposition is clunky, director Lang’s visual interpretation of those motifs is superb. The way he uses reflections both in mirrors and glass to showcase the two sides of Richard’s personality, and the way he uses Alice’s perfect reflection in the window directly over her painting is inspired. Later, he frames Richard and Alice behind metal bars of a fence when they are discussing the second murder.\n\nThe film improves exponentially after Richard meets Alice, and the murder scene and aftermath are one of Lang’s best set-pieces. Note the viciousness with which Richard stabs Alice’s lover over and over contradicted by his attempts at calm as they clean up the mess. And his rain-soaked ride out to dump the body is filled with delightful bits of suspense that Lang pulls off like no other filmmaker.\n\nAnd as clammy as having your best friend investigating your crime could have been, screenwriter Nunnally Johnson has a ton of fun with the concept. Richard accidentally lets fly some details about the murder before Frank tells him them. Then, when they visit the dump site, Richard absentmindedly begins walking toward where he left the body before Frank can lead him there. By the time they note that the killer cut his hand on the fence right next to some poison ivy, Richard can’t help but show his own infected cut and make a joke that he’s the killer. There are other great swatches of great dark humor, as when we see the boy scout who discovered the body interviewed about what happened, or when Alice just stands there and lets her blackmailer search her apartment.\n\nRobinson is aces as Richard throughout, though he falters a little in the epilogue twist (then again, who wouldn’t?). I love the bit where he calmly and logically explains exactly what needed to happen concerning the blackmailer. Bennett is fascinating to watch because you keep expecting her to become more evil than she actually becomes – by the time she is trying to poison a man, you are more engaged with her emotional journey than Richard’s – and I love how she treated him straight the entire time. Duryea plays his small role like a silent actor, hamming it up and going overboard on the mannerisms, which fits the character well.\n\nThose three actors, Lang and cinematographer Milton Krasner would reunite a year later for the aforementioned “Scarlet Street,” which had the actors playing variations on these same characters and a painting (well, a few paintings) driving the storyline. That movie is one of the pillars of film noir, and this one is damn good too – though better if you pretend the last four minutes don’t exist.\n\nScore: ****"
