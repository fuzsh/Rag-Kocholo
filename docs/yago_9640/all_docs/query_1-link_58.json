        "text": "With the release of Wrong Turn 5 just around the corner, is there any other horror film that can give the “inbred killer” genre a run for its money? Based on what I’ve seen from Inbred so far, it could be Wrong Turn 5‘s biggest competition. The film, by director Alex Chandon, is slated for a September 21st theatrical release, followed by a DVD/Blu-ray release in October of 2012.\n\nThe DVD/Blu-ray will be jam-packed with special features including the director’s diary, making of Inbred, clips from the set, interviews, and deleted scenes. For all other information on this title, read the press release below.\n\n“THEY CAME IN PEACE. THEY LEFT IN PIECES\n\nSTARRING: Jo Hartley, James Doherty, James Burrows, Seamus O’Neill, Dominic Brunt\n\nINBRED, Directed by ALEX CHANDON (Cradle of Fear), is one of the most hotly anticipated genre films of 2012. Officially selected for 2011’s FRIGHTFEST, the film has grown and grown in notoriety and now the wait is finally over as this dark, witty, yet hilariously twisted tale is unleashed in cinemas 21 September with a DVD/ Blu-ray release in October.\n\nStarring JO HARTLEY (This is England 86/88, Ill Manors) andSEAMUS O’NEILL (Dead Man’s Shoes, War Horse) as well as upcoming stars; JAMES BURROWS (Ridley Scott’s Robin Hood) and Nadine Rose Mulkerrin (Waterloo Road), INBRED boasts some stunningly realistic visual effects as well as an appearance from The Horror Channel’s EMILY BOOTH and an unexpected but inspired cameo from Emmerdale’s DOMINIC BRUNT as a chainsaw wielding henchman called ‘Podge.’\n\nSynopsis: Four young urban offenders and their care workers embark on a community service weekend in the strange, remote Yorkshire village of Mortlake, which prides on keeping itself to itself. Visiting the local pub, ‘The Dirty Hole’ which serves home-made (and suspiciously hairy) pork scratchings, they quickly realise they’ve made the wrong holiday choice.\n\nA minor incident with some local inbred youths rapidly escalates into a blood-soaked, deliriously warped nightmare for all involved and it’s just a case of who will survive, and what will be left of them?”"
