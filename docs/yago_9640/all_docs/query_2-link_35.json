But that afternoon he is on a ferry to a resort island with his wife Carly (Amy Locane) and his daughter Teresa to try to repair the damage his obsession with Maureen h as done to his marriage. They settle into a beach house by the shore.\n\nMeanwhile at Darden, Maureen seduces and kills an attendant along with two others and escapes in disguise.
