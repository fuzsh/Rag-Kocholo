        "text": "For a long, hard while, I wondered why people hated JoJo Siwa so incredibly much. I saw an innocent girl that just wanted to wear bright clothes and sell bows. Really, I was welcoming of the fact that there was a child for other kids to look up to that wasn’t desperately trying to be an adult by drinking, drugging, and longing to open an OnlyFans the day she turned eighteen (*cough* Bhad Bhabie *cough*). It was relieving to see a child star depart from childhood relatively unscathed and without a mugshot. To be frank, I have always lightheartedly joked about her brand, but I didn’t quite comprehend the amount of vitriol she received.\n\nAaaaaaand then she went and released Karma.\n\nThis song is a disgrace to not just music, but to humanity itself, and it managed to make me physically cringe upon my first listen. Suddenly, I was longing to once again hear the previous object of my irritation, Beyonce’s Texas Hold Em (that is not a freaking country song, fight me).\n\nMusically, it is every bit as contrived and unoriginal as ninety percent of the pop charts are at this moment. Nothing new there. The lyrics, however? Those are where this gets truly cringe-inducing, especially considering the literal content warning she posted on her instagram in preperation for its release.\n\nI was a bad girl, I did some bad things\n\nI swear I did it all for fun and it meant nothing\n\nLike what, selling bows? Pulling your hair into too tight of pony tails?\n\nI was a wild child, you always knew it\n\nIt was a matter of time before I blew it\n\nYeah, we knew you were just livin’ it up in that Candyland-themed bedroom of your’s. For all we know, you were giving Nikki Sixx a run for his money (and daily $1,000 worth of heroin).\n\nKarma’s a bitch, I should’ve known better\n\nIf I had a wish I would’ve never F’d around\n\nWhen I saw the pics of you and her I felt thе knife twist\n\nKarma’s a bitch, and she’s with you right now…\n\n“F’d around” guys! That’s it, there’s the reason for the content warning! She put Miley to shame, forget that twerking and wrecking ball swing, this is the child star scandal of the decade!\n\nWhile I am not of the opinion that all the hate JoJo has received is necessary, I will also absolutely add to the “What in the hell is this?” discourse currently taking over the internet. If you are going to give the overdramatic content warning she did, then you’d better be entering your Miley era. Hell, even a Demi or Britney one. Because for all the memes and cringes they created, Miley, Demi, and most certainly Britney delivered the bops for us on a silver platter. JoJo couldn’t even bother to write a solid tune or sing the word “fuck” with full conviction.\n\nAnywho, have a wonderful Good Friday and Easter Sunday. Go listen to some tolerable music, maybe even some with some sustenance. At least something other than this trash."
