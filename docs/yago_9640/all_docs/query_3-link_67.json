        "text": "Hey folks. Only one real thing to note before heading into the rankings - I have not seen a single Indy film before this week, so there will be zero nostalgia or expectations influencing the opinions here. Additionally - all of the films have been watched during a span of a few days so all of the impressions are incredibly fresh, without the long pause between releases that most people here probably experienced.\n\nMy reasons for jumping are that a) I wanted to experience a classic I never had a chance to before and b) as a historian by trade I wanted to see what they do with it. So, here it is:\n\nLast Crusade\n\nThis movie immediately shot into my top 10 of all time. It is such a triumph in so many ways. It's fun, the chemistry between characters is incredible, the actors stellar, the script fantastic and the action exceptional. Even in points when I could consider certain action pieces to be \"too long\", they were at no point unexciting. The practical effects do so much to elevate the sense of danger. If I had to actively seek a single negative to this film, it would be that the antagonists lack that small pinch of charisma that Raiders and Dial had. And whoever picked Sean Connery as Indy's dad needs a medal.\n\nRaiders of the Lost Ark\n\nThe first and deservedly a classic. I had seen the face melting scene through cultural osmosis but I had zero context as to why it was happening and who the characters were. Like Crusade, this is just good fun. It has my favorite Indy love interest, some great comedic scenes (the gun vs saber scene is 10/10), great introduction to Indy as a character and just a general solid starting point for a franchise. I have very little to complain about here, I just liked Crusade better.\n\nDial of Destiny\n\nGreat intro, great ending, Mads was amazing as a villain, movie locations were interesting (to me). The problems I have with this movie can be summarized into three points: 1) The two main protagonist's chemistry is not quite there, 2) The chase scenes can be too long for no real purpose (a problem I also have with Skull), 3) The movie itself is also a bit too long.\n\nBut this particular movie was tailored to me in one particular aspect - the places they were visiting and the things they were investigating. I cannot explain to you how giddy I was that Archimedes was the main hook of the investigation plot. You can't understand how much I love it and how ecstatic I am that he was finally given such a spotlight in a blockbuster film. And the whole siege of Syracuse had me dance on my couch. It made me so happy, in fact, that I forgave the whole time traveling business and the many logical problems it causes (I hate it as an SF device).\n\nTemple of Doom\n\nI have no idea where this movie stands but I am going to guess it's very nostalgic for people. For me, this one does nothing bad but it also does not stand out in any particular way. It being a prequel is also an odd choice considering in the very next year (in which Raiders takes place) Indy is all like \"I'm a big smort scientific man, I don't believe in magical juju\" while literally witnessing what happened in that fire pit and experiencing what the blood did to him.\n\nWhile the lows of both Dial and Skull are lower than any point in this film, Doom did the one thing a movie of this genre should not do - it simply bored me. It's just one huge flat line from beginning to end, with a small uptick being the fire pit scene because - \"Damn, they let this slip into a PG movie?\"\n\nKingdom of the Crystal Skull\n\nWhen this movie started (up until about the later half), I had more fun with it than with Temple. Hell, if I take the first part of the movie alone, I would put it above Dial easily. There are two glaring issues in the movie for me:\n\nFirst: about halfway into the jungle chase scene, the whole plot just goes off a canyon. Not only is the chase too long, too contrived and too forced, the resolution to the plot itself is incredibly weak, cliched and felt completely un-Indiana Jones to me. While all the movies up until this point have had supernatural endings, this one in particular felt like it went way too overboard. When Dial also started doing similar things with the whole time rift business I was kinda worried we'd get a similar problem but even outside my own thematic preference I feel like it did the supernatural element better.\n\nSecond: The whole alien plot about teaching \"advanced techniques\" to ancient humans and adding hyperdiffusion bullshit is something I have grown to deeply despise, especially due to the rise of pseudohistory. I have zero stomach for it and it's just not fun anymore. Alarms already started going off in my head when the alien hand was shown at the beginning but the rest of the movie was solid enough that I let it go… until I couldn't anymore.\n\nBut - again - first part of the movie was fine, Cate Blanchett's role was pretty great and having Marion back was an unexpected surprise.\n\nIt got good reviews, and an excellent audience rating on RT for instance. It seemed only hated by the usual right wing youtubers with imagined anti-woke conspiracy theories, hence my surprise.\n\nThat's definitely not the case, I promise you.\n\nThe DNA of an Indiana Jones movie, the one thing it needs to get right above all else, is comic action: breathtaking, action-packed sequences that are loaded with sight gags and amusingly ironic twists of fate. Willie diving for a diamond and having it get lost in a ton of ice. Prof. Jones downing a plane by scaring birds into its flight path. Sallah's friends turning their escape route into an instant merchant bazaar so the Nazis lose them. Indy smugly waving goodbye to Lao Che and then closing the plane door with Lao Che's name on it. Indy using a flagpole as an impromptu jousting pole. Young Indy using a train loader arm as an escape but then ending up right back in front of the same bad guys because the train is moving. Shooting the guy with the sword.\n\nThe other movies are chock full of these moments. Dial doesn't bother with them at all. It plays every single action scene completely straight: no goofs, no wit, no moments where acts of aggression are cleverly turned back around on the aggressor in a moment of instant karma. The closest it ever gets to this is when the kid handcuffs the Nazi inside the flooding tunnel, and even then the film doesn't even seem to know it just did something potentially amusing.\n\nA great example of this kind of thing is the underwater sequence with the eels. Any other Indy movie would have made those eels actually dangerous, made them an interesting obstacle to Indy's goal. Instead they just... swim around, Indy freaks out a bit, gets what he's there for without any real challenge, and then just leaves. It's just one in an entire movie of wasted action opportunities. All of the action is so, so boring.\n\nAlso, that kid with the puberty mustache is a complete charisma vacuum and yet gets a massive amount of screen time. In terms of child actors Ke Huy Quan had more entertainment value in his pinky finger than that kid had in his whole body."
