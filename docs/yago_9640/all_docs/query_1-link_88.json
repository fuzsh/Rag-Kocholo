        "text": "Plot\n\nFour young offenders: Tim, Sam, Dwight, Zeb and their caretakers: Kate and Jeff travel to a Yorkshirian village called Mortlake to do community service, staying in a little cottage. On their first day they decide to have a drink at the local pub where they meet Jim: the bartender. The next day they go salvage abandoned trains where Tim and Sam are attacked by 3 inbreds. Jeff tries to scare them away but falls on a metal shard, cutting open his femoral artery.\n\nThey go back to the pub to get help, but Jim chops Jeff's head off with a cleaver and trap the others in the cellar. The inbreds take Zeb away and pin him to the ground in a barn. It turns out he's being used for a show for the Mortlakers. They bring in a horse and have it walk around Zeb while the others pick the lock off the cellar door and escape. The horse then crushes Zeb's head killing him. The others escape but Dwight gets recaptured and used for another show. Dwight gets tied to a chair and has fecal matter pumped inside his body, popping his eyes and blowing up his stomach. The others get back to the cottage where they're staying.\n\nKate goes to check the shed but when she opens the door Jim is there. She locks the door but he shoots the lock and her fingers off. Later, Kate runs outside to distract them and save Tim and Sam. She tries to run away but hits a beartrap, one of the inbreds then saws her leg off. She tries to crawl away but Jim shoots her dead. Tim checks the basement and finds a lot of booze, he tries to lure the inbreds down into the basement while Sam runs away. The inbreds go down and find Tim holding a molotov cocktail. He tries to light it but Jim tells him that the alcohol isn't strong enough to burn and they kill him. When they find Sam running away outside they bet on how she'll die, she steps on a landmine and tries not to move, but a ferret crawls up her pant leg and makes her move, blowing her up.\n\nThe film ends with the inbreds walking back to the pub for a pint\n\nCast\n\nJo Hartley as Kate\n\nSeamus O'Neill as Jim\n\nJames Doherty as Jeff\n\nJames Burrows as Tim\n\nNeil Leiper as Gris\n\nChris Waller as Dwight\n\nNadine Rose Mulkerrin as Sam\n\nTerry Haywood as Zeb\n\nDamien Lloyd-Davies as Rats\n\nDerek Melling as Greg\n\nMark Rathbone as Ron\n\nDominic Brunt as Podge\n\nEmily Booth as June\n\nSimon Coomes as Toby\n\nProduction\n\nInbred was mainly shot in, and around Thirsk in North Yorkshire because co-writer Paul Shrimpton lives there. Locals did object to the film, leading to local councilor and mayor Derek Adamson to say, \"We don't want that sort of publicity. ... It’s quite probable that people will think the characters in the film are like real Thirsk people and that is not a good impression.\" He also expressed concerns based on Chandon's earlier movies: \"If it’s anything like his previous work then I don't think he will be really welcome here\". However, Chandon says Adamson's opinions changed later on: \"Once he learned it was a comedy he got on board, but his little quote got us so much publicity worldwide. He was integral to the whole Inbred machine.\"\n\nThe bulk of the special effects were done physically with some CGI for things that were difficult to replicate.\n\nThe company in charge of the production arrangements was Split Second Films.\n\nRelease\n\nThe film did the rounds of festivals, premièring at FrightFest in August 2011, before going on general release around Britain in September 2012.\n\nThe film was released on DVD and Blu-ray in the UK in October 2012. XLrator Media released it on video-on-demand 22 August 2013 and on DVD 24 September 2013.\n\nReception\n\nThe reviews from professional critics has been largely negative. Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports that 13% of eight surveyed critics gave the film a positive review.\n\nThe Daily Telegraph's review was: \"Patience-sappingly foul British horror film in which a brood of ravening yokels torment inner-city teens on a weekend retreat.\" Mike McCahill reviewed the film for The Guardian and said that \"both the comedy and horror rake over old ground. The warped variety show the kids stumble into ... owes too much to Python, The League of Gentlemen and Channel 4's late-night gem Focus North\". Total Film concluded \"All-out gore is the USP, but it’s served with such pernicious cynicism (is casting people with genuine disabilities as freaks OK?) and terrible dialogue ... only the persistent will stick around to count all The League Of Gentlemen steals.\" The Radio Times flagged up \"weaknesses in pacing, plot and characterisation\" but, thanks to the enthusiastic acting and gory special effects, \"[t]hese crowd-pleasing elements distract from a multitude of sins\"."
