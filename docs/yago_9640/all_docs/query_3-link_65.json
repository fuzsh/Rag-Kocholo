        "text": "Alex de Campi writes comics. She is best known for her critically-acclaimed teen survival thriller NO MERCY and the groundbreaking, digital-native comic VALENTINE. Her bestselling, criticially-acclaimed comics and graphic novels TWISTED ROMANCE with various artists, MAYDAY with Tony Parker, NO MERCY with Carla Speed McNeil, DRACULA MOTHERF**KER and PARASOCIAL with Erica Henderson, BAD KARMA with Ryan Howe, and SCRAPPER with Cliff Bleszinski and Sandy Jarrell are all published by Image Comics. She was nominated for an Eisner for her first comic work, Smoke, and it's all been downhill from there. Alex also directs music videos, and has worked with acts as diverse as Grand Duchy (Frank Black / Violet Clark), Joan As Police Woman, and Amanda Palmer to the retro-fabulous Puppini Sisters.\n\nAlex's background is a three-whisky conversation and involves several continents. She is a single mother of an awesome daughter; they live in the Stephen Kingdom (Downeast Maine) with two dogs. She has an opinion on nearly everything. You can peruse them, along with stupid photos and memes, at @alexdecampi on most social media."
