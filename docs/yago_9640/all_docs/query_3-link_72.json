She tried teaching me Karma Theory when I was a very young lad.\n\nBut when I started realising it more and more when I had correlated it with my actions plus cause and effect. - “What goes around comes around in the same or some other form” that is Karma.\n\nWe can clearly see it in a real example where Karma is in action with Air India. JRD Tata started Tata Airlines in 1938, which flew its airmail between Karachi and Mumbai. In 1946 the airline was renamed Air India. In 1953, the Indian Government nationalised all private airlines, including Air India.\n\nDaily, look out for opportunities to add value to others.\n\nWe can change the state of the World by just being kind to one another!!\n\nWrite a Gratitude Journal - think of at least three things/people you are thankful for in a day and write them.\n\nYour people and emotional skills play a major role in your success than your technical skills.\n\nRemember, it is not what you have…it is what are you going to do with what you have!!\n\nA few words of wisdom from the Sri Bhagavad Gita: “A Karma-yogi acts by body, mind, intellect, and senses, without attachment, only for self-purification.” “Do your work with the welfare of others always in mind.”"
