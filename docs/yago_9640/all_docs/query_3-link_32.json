        "text": "Bad Karma (stylized in all caps) is the second extended play by American singer-songwriter Gabbie Hanna. It was released independently on May 15, 2020.[1]\n\nBackground[]\n\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic delaying the release of her debut studio album This Time Next Year, Hanna decided to release an EP of songs that didn't quite make the cut to keep her fans entertained.\n\nHanna officially announced the EP and its lead single \"Dandelion\" on April 11, 2020. Dandelion is also the name of Hanna's second book of poetry which will be released on October 13, 2020.[2]\n\nThe songs are mostly about Hanna's portrayal as a \"toxic villain\" in the media and how no one ever cares to see her side of the story and instead spread hate about her from a far. She also writes that despite all of the hate she gets she will always keep going and never give up. It also includes Hanna's first ever love song, written about boyfriend Payton Saxon.\n\nChart performance[]\n\nThough Bad Karma didn't enter the Billboard 200 like former EP 2WayMirror, it did find its way onto three other Billboard charts. The EP debuted on the Heatseekers Albums, Top Album Sales, and Top Current Albums charts at #22, #71, and #45 respectively.[3]\n\nSingles and music videos[]\n\nAlthough only two tracks on Bad Karma were released as singles, all five songs received music videos.\n\n\"Dandelion\" was released on April 17, 2020 as the EP's lead single, its animated music video being released alongside it.\n\n\"Glass House\" was released as the second and final single form the EP on May 1, 2020, its music video coming out the same day.\n\n\"Bad Karma\" was accompanied by a music video the day after its release on May 16, 2020.\n\n\"Special\" received a music video on June 14, 2020. All four music videos to this point were directed by Hok.\n\n\"Happy\" received a music video on September 1, 2020 that was shot entirely on her and her boyfriend Payton Saxon's iPhones, Saxon directing it.\n\nTrack listing[]\n\nBad Karma No. Title Writer(s) Producer(s) Length 1. \"Glass House\" Gabbie Hanna • Alina Smith • Elli Moore Alina Smith & Ellie Moore\n\n(collectively known as \"Lyre\") 2:03 2. \"Bad Karma\" Hanna • Smith • Moore Lyre 2:44 3. \"Special\" Hanna Lyre 3:03 4. \"Dandelion\" Hanna • Smith • Moore Lyre 2:41 5. \"Happy\" Hanna • Smith • Moore Lyre 3:29 Total Length: 14:03\n\nReferences[]"
