The short premiered on 16 September 2009[11] and was released as segment of the anthology film Zombieworld in February 2015 on DVD.[12]\n\nMusic videos\n\n[edit]\n\nChandon's relationship with Cradle of Filth has also produced music videos for the songs \"From the Cradle to Enslave\", \"No Time to Cry\" and \"Her Ghost in the Fog\", as well as documentaries on their DVDs PanDaemonAeon and Heavy, Left-handed and Candid.[13]\n\nFilmography\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Film Credited as Director Producer Screenwriter Actor Film editor Cinematography Role 1982 Nightmare Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes 1988 Chainsaw Scumfuck Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes 1989 Bad Manor Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes 1991 Bad Karma Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Shape Shifter 1992 Drillbit Yes Yes Yes No Yes Yes 1997 Night Pastor Yes No Yes Yes Yes Pervirella Yes No Yes Yes Yes Yes Savage Dynamite 1998 Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels No No No No No No Art Department Cradle of Filth: PanDaemonAeon Yes No No No No No Co-Director Siamese Cop No No Yes No No No Witchcraft X: Mistress of the Craft No No No Yes No No Agent Roberts 2000 Peaches No No Yes No No No Storyboards 2001 Cradle of Fear Yes Yes Yes No No No 2003 The Sick Room No No Yes No No No 2005 BV-01 No No No Yes No No Voice-Over 2006 Borderline Yes No Yes No No No 2007 Gerry Judah Yes No Yes No No No Slash Hive No No No No No No Digital FX 2008 The Bill No No No No No No Digital FX Neon Killer No No No No No No Digital FX Comedy Lab - Peter Slater No No No No No No Digital FX 2011 Inbred Yes Yes No No No No\n\nMusic videos\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Title 1999 \"From the Cradle to Enslave\" by Cradle of Filth 2000 \"Her Ghost in the Fog\" by Cradle of Filth 2001 \"No Time to Cry\" by Cradle of Filth \"Scorched Earth Erotica\" by Cradle of Filth 2007 \"Insect\" by Mainstream Distortion 2008 \"KONFAB\" by Runonsentence 2010 \"Its So Cold\" by The Dark Poets \"Endless Zoom\" by The Dark Poets \"Sarah's Tribute to Oscar Wilde\" by The Dark Poets\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
