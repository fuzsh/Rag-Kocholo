        "text": "The old JoJo Siwa can’t come to the phone right now. The 20-year-old singer released her new dance pop song “Karma” on Friday (April 5), along with a truly wild music video for the upbeat track that marks an extreme departure from the kid-friendly persona she’s played since finding Dance Moms fame in 2015.\n\nThe video finds Siwa getting very up close and personal with a cast of female dancers, performing sensual choreography in a number of different bejeweled costumes across several lavish, exotic locations. At one point, she emerges from the ocean looking like a glitzy sea monster, slinking onto the shoreline of a small island to engage in a steamy makeout sesh with a red leotard-wearing love interest.\n\n“Karma’s a b—h, I should’ve known better,” the YouTuber superstar sings on the track. “If I had a wish, I would’ve never effed around/ When I saw the pics of you and her, I felt the knife twist.”\n\nDescribed as a “180° turn” from her previous music, “Karma” marks Siwa’s first release as part of a full rebrand she’s slowly been teasing on social media over the past few weeks. Gone are the days of hair bows and songs like “Boomerang” or “Every Girl’s a Super Girl.”\n\n“I am so stoked because this has been such a long time coming and so much work getting to this point,” Siwa said of the new song in a statement. “For ‘Karma’ to finally be here and finally be in the world’s hands is incredible. WE DID IT. It hasn’t been easy, it’s been hard as s–t, and the criticism has been real, but we did it, and I am just so happy, so proud and so ready for the world to enjoy the show.”\n\nThe So You Think You Can Dance? alum first gave fans a taste of her new image earlier this week at the 2024 iHeartRadio Music Awards, where she stepped out in edgy black face paint, a faux-hawk and glam-rock bodysuit reminiscent of Gene Simmons’ signature stagewear. The KISS frontman himself endorsed the makeover, telling TMZ: “Never be ordinary. Always be extraordinary. JoJo is extraordinary and she looks cool.”\n\nWatch Siwa’s “Karma” music video above."
