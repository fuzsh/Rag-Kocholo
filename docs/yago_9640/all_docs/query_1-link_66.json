        "text": "Chainsaw Scumfuck (1988) | Dir. Alex Chandon | 7 min.\n\nEvery day in October, a recommendation from John D’Amico of a horror movie or TV episode available for free on YouTube. Enjoy:\n\nUltra-violent British short made by lunatic teenagers. This is moonshine 100-proof horror filmmaking. Five minutes of screaming, shaking pure monkey rage. If the infected from 28 Days Later had a cinema, it would look like this. Total anarchic joy, it’s infectious and makes you want to pick up a camera and out-do it. Can’t ask for anything more, can ya?\n\nDirector Alex Chandon went on to make the bloodbath Drillbit and a lot of Cradle of Filth videos."
