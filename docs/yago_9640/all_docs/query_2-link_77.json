        "text": "Spoiler Alert! — Film Review and Basic Analysis\n\nRunning on Karma as a Buddhist Film\n\nIt is said that films about Buddhism can make us think about the ‘big questions in life,’ like why we are here, what the meaning of life is, and how to live. Running on Karma is able to offer Buddhist interpretations of reality and clearly presents philosophical concerns regarding karma throughout the film for the audience to think about.\n\nThe Concept of Karma in the Film\n\nThe Fruit of Karma\n\nBig explains how he is able to see people’s past life and deduce their upcoming death. The visions he sees can be considered as karma, in which the actions in one’s previous life, and the death he foresees is vipāka, the fruit of karma.\n\n“One thought Heaven, One thought Hell”「一念天堂，一念地獄」\n\nAs Big helps catch the culprit the CID was pursuing and stops the raging police sergeant when he was about to kill the murderer, he explains the concept of “One thought Heaven, One thought Hell,” which is similar to the theory of an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.\n\nNyanaponika states that “Greed, hatred and delusion are the roots of unwholesome kamma; unselfishness, amity and wisdom are the roots of wholesome kamma.” In this case, Big tries to prevent the sergeant from unwholesome karma, which was accumulated by his hatred towards the culprit. By doing so, he can prevent bad outcomes produced by karma.\n\nBig Experiencing “The 4 Noble Truths” in Running on Karma\n\nThe Four Noble Truths (Cattāri Ariyasaccāni) constitute a huge part when the Buddha was struggling for enlightenment. It is the heart of his teachings which he passed on to his five student monks:\n\n1) Dukkha [The Noble Truth of Suffering]\n\nAccording to the Buddha, suffering never ends. There are two types of suffering — physical and mental suffering. In Running on Karma, Big experiences both:\n\nPhysical Suffering: Big is “tortured” in the police station and experiences physical pain.\n\nMental Suffering: The movie puts more focus on his mental pain, which involves happiness in life. Buddha states that suffering occurs when one experiences the end of happiness, and it is bound to end. Big experiences separation from the people he loves, like his childhood friend, Siu Chui and later on Lee Fung-yee. He suffers from anger and sadness brought by these events.\n\n2) Samudaya [The arising or origin of dukkha]\n\nThere are mainly two causes of Suffering Dukkhas, namely craving (tanhā) and ignorance.\n\nIgnorance: Big goes through this when he chooses to escape from the fact that he could see into people’s past lives.\n\nCraving: He lives a luxurious life that goes against the values of a monk, like, smoking, drinking and being surrounded by girls etc.\n\n3) Nirodha — The cessation of dukkha [THE ENDING OF THE MOVIE]\n\nBig encounters the Third Noble Truth, Nirodha when he finally reaches epiphany at the end of the movie. Nirvana cannot be described; it is only understood truly by a person who has experienced it. Thus, it is only normal that audience are left baffled with the sequence.\n\nThey start to meditate and Big explains the follows:\n\nHe forgives the murderer of Siu Chui, Suen Guo, and brings him to the police. This may reflect that he has let go of the past and reached enlightenment.\n\n4) Magga — The path leading to the cessation of dukkha\n\nBig comes across the Fourth Noble Truth throughout his 5-year stay in the mountains. Before experiencing The Third Noble Truth, he has been living a luxurious life, with wealth and girls. However, his other self shown on screen is another extreme in which he lives a life with no comfort and filled with hatred towards Suen Guo. After he experiences The Third Noble Truth, he strikes a balance and goes through The Middle Path, in which he lives in the mountains and gets along with Suen Guo with peace and brings him to the police at the end.\n\nWhat Do the Directors Want us to Think About?\n\nJohnnie To invites us to ponder about whether karma is just. “An action (kamma), once it is performed, is finished so far as its actual performance is concerned. It is also irreversible.” In other words, you cannot get rid of karma. The film effectively contradicts fairness with the inevitability of destroying or compensating good and bad karma from one’s past life.\n\nBig tells Lee Fung-yee, “The Japanese soldier isn’t Lee Fung-yee, Lee Fung-yee isn’t the Japanese soldier. It’s just that the Japanese soldier killed people, so Lee Fung-yee has to die.” Lee becomes frustrated and exclaims, “Do you think this is fair?” and he answers that he knows it is fair, but this is also why he quit being a monk. He does not explain why he thinks it is fair, and leaves the audience hanging.\n\nAs spectators, we tend to take Lee’s side, questioning whether the way karma works is fair. The film doesn’t cease the audience’s frustration, but instead tells us to accept this fact. Lee later accepts that “Nothing can be brought away, only the karma that follows (萬般帶不走, 唯有業隨身),” and decides to die a meaningful death."
