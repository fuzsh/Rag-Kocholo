It's a Jack the Ripper thriller made by the guy who did Escape to Witch Mountain, and all the nude scenes in the first 10 minutes were shot by the studio and added after the fact. Anyway, the movie plays out nearly exactly as you might imagine if someone described the premise",

Halfway through this movie I turned to Audrey and said \"This is an erotic Jack the Ripper thriller that's shot like an episode of 'Wishbone'.\"\n\nTurns out I wasn't THAT far off. It's a Jack the Ripper thriller made by the guy who did Escape to Witch Mountain, and all the nude scenes in the first 10 minutes were shot by the studio and added after the fact.\n\nAnyway, the movie plays out nearly exactly as you might imagine if someone described the premise to you, right down to the final ambiguous \"twist,\" but it doesn't matter -- I found myself compelled the whole time by the melodramatic dialogue, which basically the whole cast delivers with a uniformly melodramatic stiltedness, that isn't helped by basically the whole thing being post-dubbed, and many of the lines sounding like someone desperately trying to improvise to explain the plot.\n\nThe one exception is the lead murderess, played by Patsy Kensit (I best recognized her as the love interest from Lethal Weapon II) -- she really commits and damn near makes some of this work, despite the absurdity.\n\nOh, and this movie supposedly takes place in Rhode Island, despite clearly being shot in England and having a climax at a big castle."
