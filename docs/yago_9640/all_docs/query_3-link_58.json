        "text": "Enjoy my dance video out-take. A glimpse into the patience my darling daughters must have when helping Mom film üòâ\n\nHere is my rant:\n\nI am experiencing a wee bit of bad karma this past week. I shall not fret about it as I know I must endure a little bit of bad karma in order to appreciate the good karma in my life. But to give you an idea, me, madame polite and composed (OK a wee bit flamboyant at times too) nearly got herself removed form the Super Store yesterday. I had had enough. I spend 2 thousand dollars a month, that is 24 thousand dollars a year in that store and I am treated poorly. I did not have a loonie, thus I could not get a cart. I needed a cart as to shop without one always puts my back out. I waited in line for 15 minutes to purchase a loonie. No, I could not‚Äìthey told me to use the debit machine to get money and then they would make change for me. I waited in line at the debit machine‚Äìthey were going to charge me 3 dollars extra to use the machine. Waited in line again. I said, ‚ÄúI am not paying three F-ing (I used the word F-ing as it is written, I did not swear) dollars just to use a cart to shop in this store! I am planning on spending over $100 in this store today. All I want is a cart.‚Äù\n\nThe service desk people freaked, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going to have to calm down maam, you‚Äôre going to have to calm down. You can buy a bag and then get change.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want a bag,‚Äù I said, holding up my eco-friendly shopping bags. ‚ÄúI just want a cart!‚Äù\n\nThey said they‚Äôd lend my a dollar‚Ä¶ if I returned it afterward. That meant another trip to the parking lot and all the way back into the store to return the loonie.\n\n‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to borrow the loonie. I am in a hurry, ‚ÄúI just want to buy a loonie now, so I can find a cart now, so I can shop.‚Äù\n\nI asked to speak with the manager. He wanted to just give me a loonie. He was missing the point. I did not want charity. I just wanted a cart. I asked if I bought a case of oranges (oranges I was going to purchase anyway, that were in eye shot) would he give me enough change so I‚Äôd have a loonie? Yes, he would. So, as I stood in line yet again with the oranges, I debated if I should just leave and say F it.\n\nI stayed, got my loonie, got a cart, shopped, spent over $1oo dollars and then went home feeling like having a good cry. And then I decided, that was it. I am never shopping at Super Store ever again. If I am going to spend $24,000 dollars a year in a store, I want a friggin cart waiting for me each day. Grocery shoppers need to revolt. We need to boycott stores that charge for carts‚Äìboycott for one day. See how fast that little coin slot disappears.\n\nAnd further more, this grey boring weather sucks too. Pip is home with a bad cough and me (her mom) is blah and wanting to sleep late and go to bed early."
