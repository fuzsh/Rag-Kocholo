        "text": "They came in peace. They left in pieces.\n\nThere had been a bit of positive buzz surrounding the release of Alex Chandon’s Inbred after Frightfest in 2011, so much so that it got me wondering how or why a generic film about a bunch of demented mutant freaks managed to stand out amongst piles of other similar titles. After getting to see the film at ‘Monster Fest’ last November, I think I have a pretty solid idea why.\n\nThe film’s plot is pretty generic for a story of this type, it centers around a group of teenage juvenile criminals and their caretakers, who decide to take the youth on a trip to Yorkshire countryside to learn how to work together as a team in order to build their communication skills and work ethic. While there, the group unfortunately run into the demented townsfolk who have other twisted plans in mind.\n\nWhile director Alex Chandon clearly had the best intentions in mind while directing Inbred, the film does take a while to kick start. After a pretty promising opening, it drags its feet until the real star of the film arrives, the special effects. With that said, the film’s strongest point are it’s amazing kills, gore and effects, all of which are predominantly practical. I haven’t been this impressed with practical effects in film since the days of George A. Romero’s Day of the Dead (1985), and the effects team should be commended for their work here in Inbred. In terms of acting, the leads all do a decent enough job as the victims but Seamus O’Neill, who plays Jim, the comically twisted pub landlord is the only real standout in the film. Inbred also tends to be more ‘gross’ opposed to ‘frightening’ but does have it’s moments of dread here and there, I did feel however, that the film lost some of its momentum and charm during its final act.\n\nBut Really, we all watch these types of films for their kills, and Inbred delivers the goods in that department. It’s just a shame, had more effort gone into the story and final act, Alex Chandon could have had a ‘real’ winner on his hands, although I can see the film might pick up a bit of a cult following in the future. Definitely worth a watch if you are interested.\n\n3 / 5 – Good\n\nReviewed by Mr. Movie"
