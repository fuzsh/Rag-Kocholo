It's been awhile since I watched something from Alex Chandon and since this one has been on my list for awhile I figured I'd knock it out while I was in the mood.

Chandon always brings the gore I crave to his explosive films and having Van Bebber narrate only made this 100x better, so while I don't love this one as much as I loved his other film Bad Karma it's still a great flick as far as I'm concerned- I mean that giant penis monster at the end was absolute nightmare fuel and really not something you're gonna be finding from any mainstream horror.
