Bad Karma on the Kippur was created for Film Racing (www.filmracing.com), a 24-hour film contest where movies have to be written, cast, directed, edited and scored in less than a day!Â The assigned theme of the contest was karma, and someone had to water a plant within the body of the short.Â While most of the other films in the contest really hit the karma theme nail on the head, Alex Grossman, the writer and director, decided to go for a looser interpretation.Â The film was a finalist in the competition, but really took on a life of it’s own when someone posted it on YouTube, where it’s garnered over 30,000 hits in just a few days.

CONVERSATION: Do you have similar tales of holiday scalping? Does Grossman’s depiction ring true? Are synagogues just trying to survive? Is there something culturally perverted in the dynamic between American Jews and their houses of worship?
