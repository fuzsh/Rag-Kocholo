Mark-Paul Gosselaar has gotten married again (though we maintain Zack Morris + Kelly Kapowski = 4ever).

The former “Saved by the Bell” actor, currently starring in TNT’s “Franklin & Bash,” exchanged vows with advertising executive Catriona McGinn on Saturday at a winery in Santa Ynez, People reported.

“He was so excited to have found the woman of his dreams,” Neil Lane, who designed the couple’s engagement rings and wedding bands, told the mag. “He couldn’t wait to propose!”

Gosselaar, 38, has two young children, Michael and Ava, from his previous, 14-year marriage to Lisa Russell.

“Catriona’s great with my kids,” the actor said last August, when they got engaged. “My kids absolutely adore her.”
