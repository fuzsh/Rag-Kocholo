Saved By The Bell executive producer Peter Engel shattered hearts everywhere after he gave his opinion on the fairy tale love of characters Zack Morris and Kelly Kapowski.

When asked by TVLine if their marriage would have lasted today, he said: 'Probably not. Well they'd be married - but not to each other.'

The high school sweethearts eloped to Las Vegas one year after graduating from Bayside High School.

Zack was played by actor Mark-Paul Gosselaar, 42, and actress Tiffani Thiessen, 42, played the character Kelly.

Their nuptials became a film, called Saved By The Bell: Wedding In Las Vegas.

Peter developed and produced Saved By The Bell, which ran from 1989 until 1993; the high school series debuted 27 years ago.

Throughout the series, Zack fought for the popular cheerleader's heart.

Peter also described to TVLine what present-day Zack would be doing.

He said 'Zack would probably be the host of a game show or talk show, or he'd be managing a hedge fund.'

Kelly 'would be married with children and have a cooking show on the Food Network. which [Tiffani Thiessen] has - and I watch!'

He also spoke on the other four main characters: Albert Clifford 'A.C' Slater, played by Mario Lopez; Jessie Spano, played by Elizabeth Berkley; Samuel 'Screech' Powers, played by Dustin Diamond; and Lisa Turtle, played by Lark Voorhies.

Peter revealed that 'Slater would be a high school football coach' and 'Screech would be Bill Gates.'

The producer concluded that while Jessie 'would have just lost to Donald Trump, Lisa 'would probably be Vera Wang or a buyer at Neiman Marcus.'

He also served as producer for additional projects for the franchise, including Saved By The Bell: The College Years and Saved By The Bell: The New Class.

Tiffiani hosts a cooking show called 'Dinner At Tiffani's; her upcoming special 'Christmas At Tiffani's,' airs on Sunday, December 4th on the Cooking Channel.

Mark-Paul and his wife Catriona McGinn are set to appear on her holiday cooking special.
