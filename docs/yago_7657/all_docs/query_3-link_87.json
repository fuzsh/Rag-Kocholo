        "text": "01 of 07\n\nMark-Paul Gosselaar (Zack Morris)\n\nAfter popping up in episodes of The Twilight Zone, The Wonder Years, and Punky Brewster, Mark-Paul Gosselaar landed a starring role on Saved by the Bell as Zack Morris. He played the preppy high schooler for three years, also bringing Zack to the short-lived Saved by the Bell: The College Years, Saved by the Bell: Wedding in Las Vegas, and an episode of Saved by the Bell: The New Class. He wrapped his run as the character in the '90s, going on to land small-screen roles on Hyperion Bay and D.C.\n\nIn 2001, Gosselaar joined NYPD Blue as Det. John Clark Jr. He spent four years in the role and followed it up with turns on Commander in Chief, John From Cincinnati, and Raising the Bar. The actor also starred as Peter Bash on Franklin & Bash; joined the beloved 2016 series Pitch as Mike Lawson; and appeared on Nobodies, The Passage, mixed-ish, and Will Trent. Gosselaar reprised his role as now Governor Zack Morris in the 2020 reboot of Saved by the Bell.\n\n02 of 07\n\nMario Lopez (A.C. Slater)\n\nAfter appearing in episodes of a.k.a. Pablo and Kids Incorporated, Mario Lopez found his spot in Saved by the Bell's Bayside High as resident jock A.C. Slater. He continued the role on Saved by the Bell: The College Years, Saved by the Bell: Wedding in Las Vegas, and Saved by the Bell: The New Class. Soon after, he joined Pacific Blue as Bobby Cruz, wrapping the gig in 2000. He then did an extended stint on The Bold and the Beautiful in 2006, played Dr. Mike Hamoui on Nip/Tuck, and lent his voice to the children's program The Chica Show.\n\nLopez has largely focused on unscripted television in his career, serving as a host, reporter, and correspondent on shows like Entertainment Tonight, America's Best Dance Crew, The X Factor, and Extra, but that doesn't mean he's left the sitcom world behind. In February 2020, he debuted the comedy The Expanding Universe of Ashley Garcia, which Lopez co-created with Seth Kurland, telling EW, \"I am excited for the opportunity to partner with Netflix to tell a universal, family-friendly story with a Latin flavor.\" Lopez was back, sans mullet, as Slater for the Peacock revival series.\n\n03 of 07\n\nElizabeth Berkley (Jessie Spano)\n\nElizabeth Berkley landed an early role as Saved by the Bell's Jessie Spano, an involved student with big dreams. After saying goodbye to the character in the early-'90s, Berkley hit the big screen in Showgirls (1995), The First Wives Club (1996), The Real Blonde (1997), and Any Given Sunday (1999). In the 2000s, the actress popped up in episodes of NYPD Blue, Titus, CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, The L Word, and CSI: Miami.\n\nShe continued to work on the small screen, competing on Dancing With the Stars and appearing in episodes of Melissa & Joey and New Girl. Coming full circle, Berkley returned for the revival of Saved by the Bell. To quote Jesse, \"Can you believe that was, like, 30 years ago?\"\n\n04 of 07\n\nLark Voorhies (Lisa Turtle)\n\nLark Voorhies enrolled at Bayside High as the popular, well-dressed Lisa Turtle. She held the role in the series and its spin-offs, going on to join Days of Our Lives as Wendy Reardon. She continued her '90s soap opera work as The Bold and the Beautiful's Jasmine Malone, and went on to earn credits for How to Be a Player (1997), How High (2001), and episodes of In the House and The Parkers.\n\nShe largely stepped back from acting in the early-2010s, instead devoting her time to writing books. In an appearance on The Dr. Oz Show in early 2020, Voorhies said she was \"hurt\" by being excluded from the reboot and not being invited when the SBTB cast got together, but surprise! She ended up returning for a cameo after all.\n\n05 of 07\n\nTiffani Thiessen (Kelly Kapowski)\n\nTiffani Thiessen landed her first major role as Saved by the Bell's Kelly Kapowski. She played the high school hottie throughout the series and on the spin-off projects, also popping up in episodes of Charles in Charge, Married... With Children, and Blossom. She then landed a mid-'90s gig as Valerie Malone on Beverly Hills, 90210, and went on to earn credits for 2000's Ivans xtc and The Ladies Man, and episodes of Two Guys, a Girl and a Pizza Place, Just Shoot Me!, Fastlane, Good Morning, Miami, and What About Brian.\n\nThiessen wrapped her five-year run as White Collar's Elizabeth Burke in 2014, and immediately kicked off a gig hosting her own Cooking Channel show, Dinner at Tiffani's, from 2015 to 2017. In addition to reprising the role of Kelly on the Saved by the Bell revival, fans can also watch Thiessen on Netflix's Alexa & Katie and MTV's food-related clip show, Deliciousness.\n\n06 of 07\n\nDustin Diamond (Samuel \"Screech\" Powers)\n\nThen a relatively-unknown actor, Dustin Diamond signed on to play the geeky Samuel \"Screech\" Powers on Saved by the Bell, continuing the role on Saved by the Bell: The College Years, Saved by the Bell: The New Class, and Saved by the Bell: Wedding in Las Vegas. Diamond then spent the 2000s picking up credits for independent films and playing himself in movies like 2003's Pauly Shore Is Dead and Dickie Roberts: Former Child Star.\n\nThe actor subsequently published a 2009 tell-all, Behind the Bell, which he would later claim was ghostwritten. He ran into personal problems in 2014, culminating in a short prison sentence. Diamond was not part of the revival, with the show explaining his absence by saying Screech was living \"on the International Space Station\" with his robot Kevin.\n\nDiamond died on Feb. 1, 2021, from stage 4 lung cancer at age 44. Prior to his death, the actor's reps told EW he was in talks about possibly reprising his role in season 2 of the revival series.\n\n07 of 07\n\nDennis Haskins (Mr. Richard Belding)\n\nAfter kicking off the '80s with appearances in episodes of CHiPs, Knots Landing, and The Dukes of Hazzard, Dennis Haskins joined Saved by the Bell as Bayside's principal, Mr. Belding. He played the educator for more than 10 years, starring in the spin-off Saved by the Bell: The New Class after the original series' wrap.
