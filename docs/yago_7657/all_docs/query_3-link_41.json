        "text": "The Mamas and the Papas is the twelfth episode of the first season of Saved by the Bell.\n\nSummary[]\n\nFor a class assignment everyone is put into pairs to act out married life so they are prepared when they grow up: Zack and Kelly, Jesse and Slater, Screech and Lisa. However, Slater sets out to ruin Zack and Kelly's marriage with Screech's aid, because he wanted to be married to Kelly.\n\nPlot[]\n\nCast[]\n\nMain Cast[]\n\nMark-Paul Gosselaar as Zack Morris\n\nMario Lopez as A.C. Slater\n\nDustin Diamond as Screech Powers\n\nTiffani Thiessen as Kelly Kapowski\n\nElizabeth Berkley as Jessie Spano\n\nLark Voorhies as Lisa Turtle\n\nDennis Haskins as Richard Belding\n\nGuest Cast[]\n\nEd Alonzo as Max\n\nQuotes[]\n\nZack Morris: \"Mr. B, what are you doing here?\"\n\nMr. Belding: \"I'm here to marry you\"\n\nZack Morris: \"Sorry Sir, You're Not My Type\"\n\nMr. Belding: \"Zip it, or you'll be honeymooning in Detention\"\n\nZack Morris: \"Zipping Sir\"\n\nKelly: \"Well I think humor is very important in keeping a marriage together.\"\n\nA.C. Slater: \"Oh yeah..other things are important too.\"\n\nKelly Kapowski: \"Well I think humor is very important in keeping a marriage together.\"\n\nA.C. Slater: \"Oh yeah..other things are important too.\"\n\nJessie Spano: \"Really, Slater?\"\n\nA.C. Slater: \"Sure. Trust, understanding, and great legs.\"\n\nZack Morris: \"Yeah!\"\n\nJessie Spano: \"You macho pig.\"\n\nA.C. Slater: \"Oink, oink, baby!\"\n\nScreech: \"No way I'm taking off THESE magic underpants.\"\n\nZack Morris: \"So I can watch The Young and the Restless.\"\n\nJessie Spano: \"It's more the Blonde and the Useless.\"\n\nScreech: \"Really, Slater?\"\n\nA.C. Slater: \"Sure. Trust, understanding, and great legs.\"\n\nZack Morris: \"Yeah!\"\n\nJessie: \"You macho pig.\"\n\nA.C. Slater: \"Oink, oink, baby!\"\n\nScreech: \"No way I'm taking off THESE magic underpants.\"\n\nZack Morris: \"So I can watch The Young and the Restless.\"\n\nJessie: \"It's more the Blonde and the Useless.\"\n\nTrivia[]\n\nWhen Lisa asked why she had to go with Screech, Mr. Belding said that he put them in alphabetical order. This is a blooper, as Screech's surname name starts with a P and Lisa's last name starts with a T.\n\nMr. Belding pulls Zack, Slater, and Screech into his office to discuss their punishment for bringing their personal vendetta's into the assignment. Which is incorrect: Slater orchestrated with Screech to break up Zack and Kelly. For once, Zack is the victim as he had no knowledge about this at all, and should not have been punished."
