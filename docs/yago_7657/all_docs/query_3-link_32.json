        "text": "It seems not every ’90s TV couple is destined to end up like Full House‘s Becky and Jesse, or even Boy Meets World‘s Cory and Topanga.\n\n[pmc_inline_gallery]\n\nDuring a recent interview with Saved by the Bell executive producer Peter Engel, TVLine learned that Zack Morris and Kelly Kapowski — Bayside High School’s class couple of 1993, who went on to elope in Las Vegas just one year after graduation — simply weren’t built to last.\n\n“Probably not,” Engel said when asked if Zack and Kelly would still be married today. “Well, they’d be married — but not to each other.”\n\nOnce you’ve processed that revelation, here’s a rundown of where Engel thinks each member of the Bayside Six (sorry, Tori!) would be today:\n\nZack would probably be the host of a game show or talk show, or he’d be managing a hedge fund; Slater would be a high school football coach; Screech would be Bill Gates; Jessie would have just lost to Donald Trump; Lisa would probably be Vera Wang, or a buyer at Neiman Marcus; and Kelly would be married with children and have a cooking show on the Food Network, which [Tiffani Thiessen] has — and I watch!"
