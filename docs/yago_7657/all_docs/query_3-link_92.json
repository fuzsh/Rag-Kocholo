        "text": "Kelly Taylor (Beverly Hills 90210) vs Kelly Kapowski (Saved By The Bell) vs Kelly Bundy (Married With Children)\n\nGrowing up watching 90’s sitcoms, I never really paid attention to the clothes that the characters wore. As a kid, I attended a private school where we had to wear uniforms, so up until high school, I knew nothing about fashion. Now that I’m older, I still love watching reruns of Beverly Hills 90210, Saved By The Bell, and Married With Children among others. Just the other day I was watching an episode of the original Beverly Hills 90210 and I was looking at the clothes thinking how far the jeans have come since the early 90s. I find a lot of style inspiration in these old shows. Since fashion is known to repeat itself, a lot of 90s style clothing is being incorporated into the present.\n\nKelly Taylor is a blonde hair rich chick, who had a sense of style.\n\nKelly Kapowski is the most popular girl at Bayside High, she’s head cheerleader, captain of the swim, volleyball, and softball team. She’s also the love interest of that blonde-haired cutie Zack Morris. Through it all, she’s always remained stylish.\n\nKelly Bundy was first introduced to us as a bleach blonde grungy style chick, but later her style evolved into a more form-fitting short spandex dresses, leather-wearing style.\n\n~ VS ~\n\n~VS~\n\nTo recreate these looks, you can always check out your local thrift stores, where you’ll find tons of pieces that can be put together to create your own 90s look.\n\nBetween the three, I would have to go with Kelly Kapowski, I loved her style.\n\nLooking back at the early 90s, between Kelly Taylor, Kelly Kapowski, and Kelly Bundy whose style did you or can you relate to the most?\n\n♥"
