        "text": "Tiffani Thiessen, who dropped the “Amber” back in 2000, wed actor Brady Smith over the weekend.\n\nThiessen, who played high-school cheerleader Kelly Kapowski and giggly girlfriend of Mark-Paul Gosselaar’s Zack Morris, on Saved by the Bell in the early ’90s, was married Saturday at a private estate in Montecito, Calif. The marriage was confirmed Monday by Thiessen’s publicist, Amy Van Iden.\n\nThiessen, 31, and Smith, 33, were surrounded by friends and family for a daytime garden wedding, People magazine reported. It is the first marriage for both.\n\nAfter Thiessen’s breakthrough role in NBC’s teenage sitcom, she graduated to Fox’s Beverly Hills, 90210, where she played vixen Valerie Malone. She had a role in Woody Allen’s 2002 film, Hollywood Ending.\n\nShe was engaged to actor Richard Ruccolo for 11 2 years before splitting in spring 2003.\n\nHopefully she doesn’t earn any demerits\n\nAlanis Morissette is being sent to the principal’s office.\n\nThe singer-songwriter will guest star as a Canadian principal in The N’s teen drama Degrassi: The Next Generation Aug. 26.\n\nMorissette will join filmmaker Kevin Smith and actor Jason Mewes in the second part of the high-school soap’s three-part season finale. In the story arc, Smith and Mewes are filming a sequel to their 2001 film Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back. The fictional film, titled Jay and Silent Bob Go Canadian, Eh! sees the bumbling duo crossing the border to earn a high-school diploma because no U.S. high school will accept them.\n\n“The plot of the movie within the show is so funny, it almost makes me want to shoot the flick for real,” Smith said in a statement Monday.\n\nMorissette, who appeared as God in Smith’s 1999 film Dogma and became a U.S. citizen this year, will play the Canadian principal who accepts Jay and Silent Bob.\n\nHogwart’s magic can’t fix this flub\n\nA handful of people in Canada got a sneak peak of the latest Harry Potter book, but a British Columbia Supreme Court judge ordered them to keep it a secret.\n\nThe book was sold to 14 people who snagged a copy of J.K. Rowlings’ much anticipated Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, when it landed on shelves last Thursday at a local grocery store.\n\nThe book, officially set for release on Saturday, has been shrouded in secrecy and its debut has been highly orchestrated to enable everyone readers, reviewers, even publishers to crack it open all at once. It’s the sixth in Rowling’s seven-b1ook fantasy series on the young wizard.\n\nBut the store slipped up and sold 14 copies before realizing its mistake.\n\n“It was an inadvertent error on behalf of one of our staff,” said Geoff Wilson, a spokesman for the Real Canadian Superstore. He said the books were quickly removed.\n\nJustice Kristi Gill last Saturday ordered customers not to talk about the book, copy it, sell it or even read it before it is officially released at 12:01 a.m. July 16.\n\nThe order also compels them to return the novel to the publisher, Raincoast Book Distribution Ltd., until the official release. At that time it will be returned to them.\n\nAs an added incentive, Raincoast will include Rowling’s autograph and a gift pack.\n\nBrad battling the flu\n\nActor Brad Pitt has been hospitalized with a flu-like illness.\n\nPitt, 41, checked himself into an undisclosed Los Angeles area hospital Monday night complaining of flu-like symptoms, his publicist Cindy Guagenti said yesterday. There were no other details and the name of the hospital wasn’t disclosed for security reasons.\n\nPitt was in Ethiopia last week with his Mr. & Mrs. Smith co-star Angelina Jolie to pick up the actress’s newly adopted baby girl, the second child she has adopted. Guagenti said it wasn’t known if the actor contracted the illness while in1 Africa.\n\n“I think he has the flu,” the spokeswoman said.\n\nOriginally Published: July 13, 2005 at 12:00 a.m."
