        "text": "Saved by the Bell reunion\n\nA \"Saved by the Bell\" reunion took place on \"The Tonight Show,\" with Jimmy Fallon actually revisiting the set of Bayside High School.\n\n(NBC video still)\n\nTime out: Remember that time Jimmy Fallon was on \"Saved by the Bell?\" No? Well, the \"Tonight Show\" host reminded us by reuniting the \"SBTB\" cast -- Mark-Paul Gosselaar (Zack Morris), Mario Lopez (A.C. Slater), Tiffani-Amber Thiessen (Kelly Kapowski) and Elizabeth Berkley (Jessie Spano) -- for a fun look back at his times attending Bayside High School. Even Dennis Haskins (Mr. Belding) shows up, but Lark Voorhees (Lisa Turtle) and Dustin Diamond (Screech) apparently couldn't make it -- though Diamond has a good excuse for not being in class.\n\nJohnny Depp and Amber Heard are married! The 51-year-old actor tied the knot with his 28-year-old \"The Rum Diaries\" co-star at his home, according to E! News, days before a planned ceremony this weekend on his private island in the Bahamas. The pair started dating in 2012 after Depp broke up with Vanessa Paradis, his partner of 14 years, and became engaged early last year. It's the first marriage for Heard and the second for Depp, who was with makeup artist Lori Anne Allison from 1983 to 1985\n\n» Read more at E! News.\n\nScary: INXS guitarist Tim Farriss lost a finger in a boating accident last month. The 57-year-old band co-founder told fans this week he's recovering from two operations in an attempt to reattach his left ring finger after an incident with his boat's electric anchor. Billboard reports the '80s group \"retired\" in 2012 but still performs; it's unclear whether Farriss will be able to play guitar again. \"I'm overwhelmed by the outpouring of love and well wishes I'm receiving. Thank you all, I'm feeling the love and it's really helping me get through this nightmare,\" he wrote on Facebook.\n\nReality star Kendall Jenner appears topless in Love magazine, just like her big sister Kim Kardashian. The 19-year-old model appears wearing black high-waisted shorts, fishnet stockings, stilettos and a bizarre white ceramic mask over her face. But the really weird part is Jenner's body has been Photoshopped to make her breasts appear bigger, clearly fake considering she's posed nearly nude before and appeared on fashion runways in sheer tops without a bra. Love's Spring/Summer issue hits newsstands Feb. 9 -- let's hope 17-year-old Kylie Jenner also isn't in it.\n\n» See photos and read more at the Daily Mail.\n\nAnd\n\nKeira Knightley recreated the \"When Harry Met Sally\" orgasm\n\nscene for\n\nVanity Fair\n\nto prove there's a new British invasion happening. Considering big roles like Batman, Superman and Abraham Lincoln have gone to UK actors, they thought it'd be fun to have Eddie Redmayne, Benedict Cumberbatch, Judi Dench and other stars recreate famous American movies in the style of World War II newsreels. As for Knightley, we'll have what she's having.\n\nMore Buzz:\n\n» Suge Knight handcuffed to hospital bed with near-fatal blood clot (TMZ)\n\n» 'Sister Wives' husband divorces his wife, marries another (NY Daily News)\n\n» Avril Lavigne returns, looks healthy in teaser for new music video (MTV)\n\n» Bobbi Kristina's 'drug dealer friend' says he rescued her from bathtub (DM)\n\n» Bobby Brown's wife pregnant as daughter Bobbi Kristina is in coma (TMZ)\n\n» K-pop ster CL working on new music with will.i.am, Black Eyed Peas (Billboard)\n\n» Report: Sarah Palin returning to 'SNL' for 40th anniversary special (NYDN)\n\n» Steve Irwin's daughter Bindi, 16, says he told her not to date 'til she's 40 (DM)\n\n» 'Stop the Presses': R.E.M.'s Mike Mills sings about newspapers on rap (RS)\n\n» Sources: Kris Jenner had no idea Bruce wanted to become a woman (TMZ)\n\n» New 'Furious 7' trailer has pretty much everything fans want (Slash Film)\n\n» Grammys add Mary J Blige, Beck, Sia to performance lineup (NY Daily News)\n\n» Ian Ziering says a 'Beverly Hills, 90210' reunion is 'entirely possible' (E!
