        "text": "The first season of the Saved by the Bell reboot came to an end on Peacock recently, but viewers were left with one burning question surrounding Kelly Kapowski’s (Tiffani Thiessen) ex Jeff Hunter (William Patrick Muldoon III).\n\nFans will know Jeff as the manager of The Max, who briefly dated Kelly Kapowski after she broke up with Zack Morris (Mark-Paul Gosselaar) in the original series.\n\nNow, fans are starting to believe he could have a bigger part to play, after Kelly raised a few paternity doubts about her son Mac Morris (Mitchell Hoog) in one telling scene.\n\nThe recently-aired finale saw Mac ask Kelly the question: ‘Do I know my father?’\n\nKelly gave a nervous laugh and said: ‘You’re not Jeff’s.’\n\nIt’s led some to question whether Jeff could indeed be Mac’s father. Tiffani, however, isn’t so convinced.\n\n‘I promise you it’s not Jeff. I mean, look at him! [Mac] looks exactly like Mark-Paul. It was such a good line to add in there, wasn’t it? That’s [executive producer] Tracey [Wigfield] for you. No way that could happen, it would kill everything,’ Thiessen told EW, laughing off the theory.\n\n‘It’s just a funny, really good line. It’s those little lines that are just so great, but there’s no way. Mac looks exactly like Zack. It’s truly uncanny how they cast him. Mitchell is good, too. He’s such a good actor. All of the kids in the cast are so talented.’\n\nSaved By the Bell aired between 1989 and 1992, with spin-off The College Years on screens for one season, between 1993 and 1994.\n\nMeanwhile, Selena Gomez fans have been left fuming over a scene in the Saved By The Bell reboot, which appeared to mock her kidney transplant and the show later apologised for.\n\nSaved by the Bell is available to stream on Peacock in the US.\n\nGot A Story?\n\nIf you’ve got a celebrity story, video or pictures get in touch with the Metro.co.uk entertainment team by emailing us celebtips@metro.co.uk, calling 020 3615 2145 or by visiting our Submit Stuff page – we’d love to hear from you.\n\nMORE : Selena Gomez fans left furious as Saved By The Bell reboot ‘mocks her kidney transplant’"
