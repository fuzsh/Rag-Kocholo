        "text": "Tiffani Thiessen is best known for playing Saved by the Bell's Kelly Kapowski but has been working steadily for decades.\n\nShe won the hearts of many teenagers around the world in the popular series, which originally aired from 1989 to 1993.\n\nWho is Saved By The Bell's Tiffani Thiessen?\n\nTiffani-Amber Thiessen was born on January 23, 1974, in Long Beach, California.\n\nShe appeared in her first commercial after family members encouraged her to take up acting when she was eight.\n\nHer big break came when she was cast as cheerleader Kelly Kapowski on Saved by the Bell.\n\nShe would also star in Beverly Hills, 90210, and other television series during her career.\n\nThiessen also hosted her own food-based television series called Dinner at Tiffani's.\n\nShe is married to actor Brady Smith and they have two children.\n\nWho did she play in Saved by the Bell?\n\nThiessen starred as Kelly Kapowski alongside Mark-Paul Gosselaar (Zack Morris), Mario Lopez (A.C. Slater), Dustin Diamond (Samual Screech Powers), and Lark Voorhies (Lisa Turtle).\n\nKelly and Zack dated each other during the series and would end up together.\n\nThe teen sitcom ran from 1989 to 1993, although there were two spin-off shows: The College Years and The New Class, which lasted until 2000.\n\nShe also starred in three episodes of the 2020 reboot of the hit show.\n\nSpeaking with Buzzfeed, Thiessen shared that she is still fairly close with many of her co-stars.\n\n\"Well, most of us have kept in touch. Like, Mark-Paul and I are still very close — our spouses are very close,\" she said.\n\nSame with Mario and Elizabeth — I actually think the biggest reunion for me was with Ed because I hadn't seen him in years. It was definitely fun and sweet to see him since it had been so long. Also, seeing Lark was huge for us as well. It was really fun to have her back.\"\n\nWhere is she now?\n\nThiessen is hosting MTV's Deliciousness, a spin-off of the long-running show Ridiculousness.\n\n\"From food blunders to restaurant fails to kids in the kitchen and more, Deliciousness celebrates our greatest indulgences - food and drink,\" MTV said in a statement to Deadline.\n\n\"Helping to satisfy the foodie in all of us, each episode will showcase the internet’s most viral and entertaining videos.”\n\nPanelists for the show include Angela Kinsey, Kel Mitchell, and Tim Chantarangsu.\n\nThe tasty show premiered in December of 2020.\n\n“This is definitely more of a first, where I'm kind of hosting a group of people on a stage,” Thiessen told Forbes of her work on the show. “I have three of the most fun, talented role-with-the-punches sort of castmates on that couch with me, which makes my job very easy, easier than, I would say, maybe with other people."
