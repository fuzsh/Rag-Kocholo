        "text": "Everytime I watch an episode of Saved by the Bell I see that E/I icon at the bottom of the screen. That, of course, indicates that it's an educational program. Yet...after all these years I'm still not sure what I was supposed to learn from this show. That is why I decided to make a list of everything I did learn and see if there is anything there to convince me that SBTB deserves to be an educational show.\n\nWhat I learned from Saved by the Bell:\n\n1. No one will find it disturbing that SOMEHOW I managed to get poster of my school crush.\n\n2. My friends will kill my pet Lizard.\n\n3. High School has a population of 20 students.\n\n4. All my teachers are either deaf, blind, or an annoying fat guy!\n\n5. My friends will be in all my classes.\n\n6. I'll have enough time to participate in every school activity and sport.\n\n7. The Principal will not only be a sub for my class, but will trust me to install a CD player in his expensive car and deliver his baby when I'm trapped in the elevator with his wife.\n\n8. If I get in trouble enough times my mother will have her own parking space.\n\n9. I can hire an actor to pretend to be my father.\n\n10. I can throw birthday parties in the Prinicpal's office.\n\n11. The entire school will go out of their way to teach me a lesson.\n\n12. My enemy and I will become best friends.\n\n13. Caffeine pills will turn me into a crazy person.\n\n14. My 15 yr old girlfriend will dump me for a college student.\n\n15. At 17 I can go on a vacation to Hawaii by myself and hook up with a young MILF.\n\n16. Even though I'm a D-student I can still get a 1500 on my SATs and get accepted into Harvard.\n\n17. When I get to college I will finally realized that I'm hispanic!\n\nFeel free to add more!\n\n1. No one will find it disturbing that SOMEHOW I managed to get poster of my school crush.\n\nNot these days, you can pretty much get anything on eBay!\n\n2. My friends will kill my pet Lizard.\n\nThat was an accident. But yeah, never trust your friends to \"pet-sit\".\n\n3. High School has a population of 20 students.\n\nI wished! At least then I may have remembered everyone's names!\n\n4. All my teachers are either deaf, blind, or an annoying fat guy!\n\nThat's just a fantasy\n\n5. My friends will be in all my classes.\n\nAgain, another fantasy\n\n6. I'll have enough time to participate in every school activity and sport.\n\nIF you don't do your homework! Or sleep for that matter\n\n7. The Principal will not only be a sub for my class, but will trust me to install a CD player in his expensive car and deliver his baby when I'm trapped in the elevator with his wife.\n\nIf your Principal is as gullible as Mr. Belding was then nothing would surprise me.\n\n8. If I get in trouble enough times my mother will have her own parking space.\n\nWe like to do what we can to help our parents......\n\n9. I can hire an actor to pretend to be my father.\n\nSure you can. The thing is, can you afford it, and are you likely to get away with it?\n\n10. I can throw birthday parties in the Prinicpal's office.\n\nAnd speed up time while you're at it....Hell, you can freeze time!\n\n11. The entire school will go out of their way to teach me a lesson.\n\nWell, there ARE only 20 of them. And they do have no life outside of school as we have already established.\n\n12. My enemy and I will become best friends.\n\nGives us hope to continue being nice to people.\n\n13. Caffeine pills will turn me into a crazy person.\n\nNope, pills of any kind will turn you into a crazy person. I think that SBTB was too focused on young kids to go into serious drug territory, but let's face it, that was what they were hinting at.\n\n14. My 15 yr old girlfriend will dump me for a college student.\n\nPossible. We tend to like older men\n\n15. At 17 I can go on a vacation to Hawaii by myself and hook up with a young MILF.\n\nYour mother is sick of the sight of you?\n\n16. Even though I'm a D-student I can still get a 1500 on my SATs and get accepted into Harvard.\n\nAgain, never give up trying! You can accomplish anything!\n\n17. When I get to college I will finally realized that I'm hispanic!\n\nYeah.........erm.......every story has a great ending?\n\nt:"
