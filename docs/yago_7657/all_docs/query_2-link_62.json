        "text": "Highest Rated: 47% Hollywood Ending (2002)\n\nLowest Rated: 9% From Dusk Till Dawn 2: Texas Blood Money (1999)\n\nBirthday: Jan 23, 1974\n\nBirthplace: Long Beach, California, USA\n\nGoing from all-American teenage superstar to respected, grown-up working actress, Tiffani Thiessen never lost the affection she earned from fans with her breakthrough role as Kelly Kapowski on \"Saved by the Bell\" (NBC, 1989-1993). The endearingly cheesy Saturday-morning show was a phenomenon, and Tiffani-Amber Thiessen - as she was billed then - was chief among its charms as a good girl whose relationship with Zack Morris (Mark-Paul Gosselaar) became a romance for the Gen-X ages. Easily stretching to play the devious vixen Valerie Malone, Thiessen revitalized a post-Shannen Doherty \"Beverly Hills, 90210\" (FOX, 1990-2000). She also starred in a string of made-for-TV movies and brought her next-generation-Heather-Locklear touch to many troubled series, including \"Two Guys, a Girl and a Pizza Place\" (ABC, 1998-2001) and \"Fastlane\" (FOX, 2002-03). She worked with Woody Allen in his feature \"Hollywood Ending\" (2002) and settled comfortably into marriage, motherhood and a starring role on \"White Collar\" (USA Network, 2009-14). While she made her name as the queen of TV guilty pleasures, as an adult Thiessen proved she had talent and staying power to spare.\n\nHighest rated movies\n\n47% Hollywood Ending\n\n29% Speedway Junky\n\n19% Love Stinks\n\n14% Shriek If You Know What I Did Last Friday the 13th 11% The Ladies Man\n\n9% From Dusk Till Dawn 2: Texas Blood Money\n\nPhotos\n\nTiffani Thiessen Tiffani Thiessen at arrivals for THE SECRET LIFE OF PETS 2 Premiere, Regency Village Theatre - Westwood, Los Angeles, CA June 2, 2019.
