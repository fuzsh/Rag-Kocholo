        "text": "Welcome back to my Knight Fever blog. While there is a lot of baseball related topics that I want to report on from my days here in Nashville, I’d like to first start off with something that took place on Tuesday in the Trade Show.\n\nI was reunited with Mr. Belding!\n\nBack in 2010, I was working for the Reading Phillies, the Double-A affiliate of the Philadelphia Phillies. I spent two season with Reading as their PR Director and had an opportunity to do many things.\n\nIn back-to-back seasons, we welcomed Mr. Belding to the ballpark — the principal from one of my all-time favorite TV shows — Saved By the Bell. To say that I was a big fan of the show growing up would be an understatement. I watched every episode over and over again. I pretty much grew up with that show. Okay, yes, I wanted to be Zack Morris. I wanted to have the “Zack Morris” phone and date Kelly Kapowski.\n\nWhen we brought Mr. Belding in to FirstEnergy Stadium in 2010, I couldn’t wait to meet him. Of course I wanted to take a photo with him, but I was excited to interview him and get a chance to see someone who I grew up watching.\n\nMeeting him in 2010 and seeing the reaction from fans was priceless. He met thousands of people. Signed thousands of autographs. He was great to have around for the day. So great in fact, that we brought him back for the 2011 season.\n\nHis first appearance in Reading was special. He sang karaoke with fans and even spent time with our players. Matt Rizzotti even hit a home run for him!\n\nOver four years later, I had an opportunity to see Mr. Belding again. While we have stayed in touch over the years through Twitter, it was great to see him in person. We talked at the Winter Meetings Trade Show for a while. We spoke a lot about his time in Reading, having Matt Rizzotti hit a home run for him, and much more. Mr. Belding has a great memory!\n\nSo now, who knows… maybe we’ll see Mr. Belding in Charlotte in 2016 (fingers crossed). If you would like to see him at BB&T Ballpark in 2016, send me a Tweet to @Tommy_the_V or email me at tommyv@charlotteknights.\n\nHey, hey, hey… what is going on here!"
