        "text": "If you grew up in the 90s, no doubt you were in tune with the romantic goings on at Bayside High, a fictional school depicted in the popular teen television show Saved by the Bell.\n\nThe story centered around Zack Morris, played by Mark-Paul Gosselaar, and his dogged pursuit of All-American cheerleader Kelly Kapowski, played by Tiffani Thiessen.\n\nViewers got so wrapped up in the young couple’s relationship that NBC created a spin-off where they attended college and a few TV movies — and one where Zack and Kelly got married in Las Vegas.\n\nTwenty-some years later, Gosselaar is returning to the small screen where he’ll play a catcher for the San Diego Padres in the upcoming FOX series Pitch, a story about the first female player in the Major Leagues.\n\nWith the connection to the Padres, it’s only natural that Gosselaar would be invited to play in the Major League Baseball All-Star Celebrity Softball Game in San Diego Sunday night.\n\nThe game also featured appearances from several baseball mascots, including D. Baxter the Bobcat of the Arizona Diamondbacks, who is apparently a big fan of Saved by the Bell.\n\nIt got us to thinking … has anybody seen Screech or Lisa Turtle lately?"
