        "text": "The fashion. The hair. The teenage angst. The theme tune! For those of a certain age, Saved By The Bell was the ultimate must-watch. We were entranced with the lives of Zack Morris, A.C. Slater, Kelly Kapowski, Lisa Tuttle, Jessie Spano and, of course, Screech Powers, and our teenage dreams came true when Zack and Kelly finally got married after years of on-off romancing. So you can imagine our excitement when we first heard that the show is returning for a modern revival, with some of the cast returning for the ultimate nostalgia fest.\n\nNow, we're even more excited as the full length trailer has dropped.\n\nIn the trailer, Mark-Paul Gosselaar and Tifffani Thiessen reprise their roles as Zack Morris and Kelly Kapowski (they now have a son called Mac), with Mario Lopez and Elizabeth Berkley returning as A.C. Slater and Jessie Spano.\n\nZack is now the governor of California, who decides to send low-income students to Bayside, now a high-performing school full of overprivileged students, with AC Slater and Jessica Spano as teachers at their old school, guiding young minds through highs and lows. It's also clear that the tone has shifted slightly, with shades of satire and in-jokes.\n\nCan't wait? The series will drop on streaming service Peacock on November 25.\n\nMario shared a video on his Instagram earlier this year showing himself in a diner that looked familiar: it's a recreation of The Max, where the six best friends used to hang out\n\nHe wasn't alone: Elizabeth joins him in the booth.\n\n'Alright so we just shot our first scene, well not our first scene, more like a promo', Mario wrote. 'We're having fun right now.'\n\n'We're being dropped right back in...', Elizabeth added. 'Talk about being in a time machine.'\n\nDustin Diamond, who played Screech, is not thought to have been asked. In 2014, he was arrested for possessing a knife, which was alleged to have been pulled during a bar fight during which a man was stabbed.\n\nSaved By The Bell aired between 1989 and 1993, over 86 episodes. It inspired sequel series, spin-offs, feature-length TV movies and an unofficial musical."
