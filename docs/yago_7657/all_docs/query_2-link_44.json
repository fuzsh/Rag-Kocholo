        "text": "\"Saved by the Bell: Wedding in Las Vegas,\" the two-hour television movie that served as the series finale, aired Oct. 7, 1994, on NBC.\n\nIn it, Zack Morris (Mark-Paul Gosselaar) and Kelly Kapowski (Tiffani Thiessen) finally got married — hence the title — and Thiessen celebrated Kelly and Zack's 27th anniversary with a throwback Instagram post:\n\n\"Saved by the Bell\" aired for four seasons from 1989 to 1992 before spinning off into \"Saved by the Bell: The College Years\" for one season, beginning in May 1993 and wrapping in February 1994. \"Saved by the Bell: The New Class\" (1993-2000) was another spin-off, but Screech (the late Dustin Diamond) and Mr. Belding (Dennis Haskins) were the only original characters featured.\n\nThe iconic teen sitcom was revived by Peacock, and the first season began streaming last November. In it, Gosselaar reprises his role of Zack, who is now the Governor of California and has a son attending Bayside. Mario Lopez and Jessica Spano also returned as A.C. Slater and Jessica Spano, respectively."
