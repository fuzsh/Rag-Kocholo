        "text": "Tiffani Thiessen and Brady Smith have been married since 2005, and their near two-decade relationship is stronger than ever.\n\nAccording to a 2019 interview with Yahoo Lifestyle, the pair met while working on set for a TV show, and sparks started to fly almost immediately.\n\nEven though Smith claims to be smitten with the Saved By The Bell starlet, he insisted that Thiessen actually made the first move. Admittedly, Smith arranged their first date, but Thiessen took it from there.\n\n“Obviously I wanted to kiss her, but I wasn’t gonna be that dude that tries to kiss on the first date. But then she leaned in and laid one on me,” Smith told Yahoo. “And I don’t even remember the drive home.\"\n\n“Baby, you just swept me off my feet,” Thiessen added in jest. “What can I say?”\n\nSo, who is Tiffani Thiessen’s husband?

Following a year of dating, the couple got engaged.\n\n“I made a book, and I called it The Tiffani & Brady Chronicles,” Smith told Yahoo!. “Each page was trips we’ve taken, stuff that we had done together, special sweet moments. And then on the last page, I drew myself down on one knee proposing. And then when she got to that page, she looked up and I got down on one knee and proposed.\"\n\nThiessen and Smith wed in 2005\n\nOn July 9, 2005, the Beverly Hills 90210 alum married Smith at a private estate in Montecito, California.\n\nThiessen wore a French lace gown by Vera Wang, and Smith was fully clad in Kenneth Cole.

Boy, this kid has spunk,\" it read.\n\nThey wrote a book together\n\nIn 2019, Thiessen and Smith put their creative energies together and co-authored a children’s book, titled You’re Missing It.\n\nInspiration for the book came from the couple’s real life, when Thiessen noticed that her husband was spending too much time focused on his phone rather than their children.\n\n\"That's a conversation that's probably very much in the forefront in many households these days, and it's definitely been one of ours,\" Thiessen told USA Today in 2019.\n\nThey prioritize family time\n\nBoth the MTV host and the actor cherish their family time and try to make the most of ordinary moments, like spending time at the dinner table or swinging on the swing.\n\n“Dinner time is sacred, special. There’s no electronics. We sit down and we’re like, ‘How was your day?’ This is time to catch up and communicate,” Smith explained to Yahoo Lifestyle. “We think technology is a wonderful thing. Sometimes it’s too much.\"\n\nHe’s a thoughtful gift giver\n\nIn addition to being an attentive father, Smith has proven himself an exceptional gift giver.\n\n“My husband swung it out of the park a few years ago,” the author and host once told Page Six Style.\n\n“He surprised me by taking me down to the Porsche Experience, where you get to race a Porsche on the race track,” she gushed. “A lot of people don’t know this about me, but I love race cars. If I were to believe there were past lives, I think I must have been a race car driver.”"
