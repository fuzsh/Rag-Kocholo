Didn't watch a single episode, so no idea how they would rank with personality factored in.\n\nare you kidding? Kelly KaPOWski all day, any day. Don't be silly.\n\nHonorable mention to Lisa Turtle, but it isn't her fault. The competition was over before anyone else showed up.\n\nand yes, it's Turtle. Not Tuttle, dummie!\n\nImagine being THE guy who married Kelly Kapowski in real life (yes I see Instagram). What a story for that dude...\n\nThere's probably a reason the 90210 girls made her an outcast and she eventually left. Jealousy.\n\nImagine being THE guy who married Kelly Kapowski in real life (yes I see Instagram).
