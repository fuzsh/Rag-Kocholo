        "text": "The schedule for the Character Review posts will be changing to Friday (or Saturday at the latest from now on).\n\n*Warning: This post contains spoilers about the characters from the television show Saved by the Bell. Read at your own risk if you have not watched the program. There is something to be said about a well-written, human character. They leap off the page and speak to us as if they were right in front of us, as flesh and blood human beings, instead of fictional creations.\n\nFor every slacker in high school, there is an overachiever. This person wants more than good grades. They want to be part of every student organization. No goal is unreachable. In Saved by the Bell, this student is Jessie Spano (Elizabeth Berkley Lauren). Jessie is an outspoken feminist, a straight-A student, a tad neurotic, and driven to succeed.\n\nBest friends with Zack Morris (Mark-Paul Gosselaar) since they were kids, they are polar opposites. He is also the one who is finally able to get her off of her addiction to caffeine pills. The child of divorced parents, Jessie must contend with step-parents and step-siblings.\n\nOutside of school and her friendship with Zack, Jessie is also besties with Kelly Kapowski (Tiffani Thiessen) and has an/off relationship with A.C. Slater (Mario Lopez).\n\nAfter accepting that she will not be Valedictorian, Jessie attends Columbia University. In her adult life, she becomes the best-selling writer of parenting books, gives birth to her son Jamie (Belmont Cameli), and returns to Bayside as a guidance counselor.\n\nWhen we last see Jessie, her marriage has ended. While facing life as a single parent, she realizes that her feelings for Slater may have not ended with graduation.\n\nTo sum it up: What I like about Jessie is that she is a wash of contradictions. She has a need to be the best, but she is also fearful of not making her ambitions a reality. She wants love, but is not willing her sacrifice who she is to get that love.\n\nWhich is why she is a memorable character."
