Having been a fan of the PC original, I was really looking forward to this next installment.\n\nSome folks continue to refer to this game as a first-person shooter. Normally I wouldn't associate with such people but I overheard one of the guys on work release say something to that effect while he was cleaning my pool this weekend. After giving him a much-deserved drubbing with my walking stick, I calmly explained that Deus Ex: Invisible War is a science-fiction-based, conspiracy-laden RPG, first and foremost. As such, it's more about character development and story progression than about running around shooting everything that moves.\n\nThose of you who never played the original may (possibly) be forgiven for asking \"So what?\" Deus Ex took the same approach to story and narrative that Knights of the Old Republic took to morality. Both games actually shift in response to player decisions and actions. What you get is a game world that works according to logical consequences and one that allows gamers a chance to find their own way through the world rather than simply discovering the path the designers want you to follow. So it's an RPG, but you can play it as a shooter, I guess. Wicked.\n\nHead-to-Head Comparison!\n\nIGN Insiders can check out this detailed comparison between the Xbox and PC versions of Invisible War. We provide details on everything you need to know to make a smart buy or rent, including side-by-side screenshots.\n\nSo what are you waiting for? Click now!\n\nRead It Now! | Get the Guide\n\nIf you do play Deus Ex: Invisible War with a combat focus, you'll find it's very absorbing, not because of the mechanics of combat (and \"mechanical\" is definitely the word here) but because of the context of it all. Sure, most of us are content to shoot Nazis because, well, they're Nazis. But here, there's always a much deeper reason to the action; you'll be shooting because you've made the decision to be enemies with a particular person or group, not because the game designers thought you needed someone to shoot at.\n\nFor the record, we know that the developers considered it a flaw that you had to kill anyone at all to finish the first game. My own temperament and the exigencies of deadlines have kept me from trying to run through Invisible War without actually killing anyone. But even so, I started to feel bad that I was assassinating people, particularly when there was a equally tempting material reward for not doing so. Eventually I decided to let people live so long as they weren't shooting back at me. But even this gets complicated in the world of Invisible War. I let one character live and then was shocked to find that he did something incredibly evil later on. Maybe I should kill more people.\n\nThis is why you must play Deus Ex: Invisible War yourself -- those moments where you really feel that your decisions have consequences in the world. Better still, those consequences can seriously affect your decision-making. Towards the end of the game, I was understandably fed up with feeling like I was merely a pawn in this conflict. When one of my patrons decided to hold one of my lady-friends hostage pending successful completion of my next mission, I went nuts and gunned down the security force that was protecting her. This is despite the fact that I actually had a thing for one of the lady guards. I wasn't aggravated by the game, I was aggravated in it.\n\nMost games have a black and white standard for morality where a particular decision. Heck, it's even the entire focus of Knights of the Old Republic. But Invisible War is told more in shades of gray. (Very dark shades; I often made my decision based on which alternative was less evil.) For me, \"good\" merely indicated a standard of efficiency. Doing the \"right thing\" then became a matter of finding out how to make the most of my limited resources. Early on, you'll need to work for all the factions you can, not only to build up a considerable cache of practical loot but also to figure out just who the hell you want to work for. But once you feel like you can easily handle this servant of two masters routine, the game forces you into an either/or situation -- like when multiple factions want you to deliver a certain commodity to them, or when one faction asks you to kill someone another faction has ordered you to protect. Once you hit that point you will have to make some genuinely hard decisions.\n\nBetter still, Deus Ex: Invisible War mirrors the overall concept of a flexible narrative, with flexible puzzle and quest design. Nearly every objective in the game can be achieved three or four ways, primarily aligned along axes of violence and visibility. When infiltrating an office, you can sneak in through an air duct, hack your way in using computers, ask around until you find the door code, or simply blow the door down and go in shooting.\n\nLet's say a large group of enemies, along with a few killer bots, are guarding a door I need to get through. Not having enough ammo to take them all on at once, I sneak in behind them and take control of all but one of their robots and simply disable them. (The fact that the guards don't notice their warbot is now a sparking, hissing pile of metal beside them is an admittedly weak point in the design.) With only one bot left, I take control of that, shoot the guard beside him and have the bot run like hell to the nearest rival guardpost. Here two of my enemies kill each other for me while I cheerily walk through the gate.\n\nYou can tell the developers are proud of their physics system because they put a basketball in your apartment right at the start of the game. There's no goal (that comes later), but it's a nice way to get your hands on the physics of the game world right away. The basketball seems to be covered in double-sided tape, of course, and it stops rolling far too soon, and you can sometimes turn a whole house into shambles just by walking through a room and knocking the furniture against the walls -- but otherwise, the physics are pretty solid and can be used in some interesting ways. I once crouched behind a barrel to try to get past a turret mounted in the ceiling. Once the turret saw me, it started firing and the barrel went spinning up in the air, leaving me totally exposed. Not only is that good physics, that's good gameplay.\n\nWith this in mind, it seems overly fussy to complain that the game makes too many cuts in terms of less important details. Where the first Deus Ex had an elaborate skill system, it's been absorbed by the BioMod and weapon modification features. You can still play a character who focuses on sniping or computer hacking if you want but you'll need to express that more through actions than by choices on a character sheet. Some die-hard RPGers have a bit of a problem with that but it has less impact on the gameplay and merely adds one more boundary between the player and the game. Ditto for the single type of ammo now used by all the weapons in the game. This at least, has a vaguely plausible scientific basis but I still don't get how I'm using the same bullets in my flamethrower as I use in my dart gun.\n\nWhat's not overly fussy is complaining that you can walk into a coffee shop with a shotgun in your hands and no one seems to care. I seem to remember that this kind of thing is generally frowned upon so it would be nice if the characters in the game world had a similar response. But they're not terribly bright to begin with. Some enemies won't notice their buddies getting gunned down unless they actually hear it. Others won't care if you come in to their office and start snatching money right out of their lockers. Like Kelsey Grammar, you can put pretty words in their mouths but that doesn't make them smart.\n\nThe previous PC version suffered from a surfeit of controls. That means there were a lot of them. This time around, no doubt thanks to the Xbox version, we know have far fewer. In all, it's a good thing not to have to worry about each and every hotkey. The action key serves several purposes: lifting, talking, opening, and dropping. It also automatically equips your multitools if you try to perform an action on a lock. Crouching, walking and jumping round out the movement actions, while a brand new \"secondary\" fire buttons doubles the pleasure of each of your weapons. A few other keys allow you to activate certain biomods in a pinch. Even so, you can pause the game on either the inventory or biomod screen to grab just the thing you're looking for. I will admit it seems kind of gamey that you can simply pause the game, down three health packs and kick on your regeneration biomod in the middle of a firefight.\n\nIt took me a while to get used to \"mantling\" -- which is a fancy word for climbing. While you'll go up and down regular ladders just using movement controls (and quite stiffly, I might add), you have to use the jump function to climb up on crates and such. There's a bit of a problem with forward jumps knocking you backwards when you hit an object so it can be kind of a pain to get the timing right. After a few minutes of teary-eyed perseverance, I seemed to get the hang of it.\n\nThere was one thing I never quite got used to though. Like Morrowind, picking up every little tiny item your enemies drop is a real pain in the ass, particularly since nine out of ten times, a guy will fall right on top of his ammo clip and you'll only have to toss him down a well to get to it.\n\nI also have to criticize the HUD. Ion's got the best intentions in trying to create a heads-up display that mirrors the shape of the human iris. That whole eye-overlay thing looks fantastic...as long as it's seen on an eye. The problem is, Deus Ex; Invisible War is played on a computer monitor, not a human eye, so the circular conception of the interface (health bars and such) is intended to fit a format no one will play the game on. It's an aesthetic choice and Ion's heart is definitely in the right place but the round interface is just plain distracting.\n\nFinally, and I don't want to make too big a deal of this, Invisible War has a vast and tremendously great cast of female characters. The two heads of the Order, a few Tarsus students, the chief of the program, the female holo-star and numerous others really help flesh out the world and give it a sense of proportion that's missing from many other games. And some of these women are downright sexy, not in terms of polygons but in terms of personality. While we're talking about sex, I should say that the game definitely hints at some adult themes but does so tastefully and usually as point of the story.\n\nThough I don't give away too many specifics here, there are a few things I'd like to talk about in terms of the game's story. Those of you who whine when we say things like \"In Deus Ex: Invisible War you play a character named Alex D\" should stop reading at this point and go buy the game before you accidentally hear someone in the unemployment line mentions that it also has guns and levels. Or just jump to the next page. Either way.\n\nIf that's not sufficient warning for you, how's this?\n\nSPOILER! (aka briefly vague, vaguely brief, non-game-ruining comments on game)\n\nAlright, now that we've got rid of the crybabies...\n\nA lot of people have asked how this version of Deus Ex dovetails with the last. Since there were a few alternate endings depending on how you played the first game, gamers were understandably anxious to discover which of the endings were used as the background for the sequel. And although Ion has a firm grasp on the story here, they've done a good job of being vague about the specifics. You'll know that there was a massive worldwide Collapse -- note the capital \"C\" -- caused by JC Denton and you're given a few other details but we'll leave fnord it for you to discover exactly how the first game's plot was resolved. Those of you who haven't played the first game on the PC will likely be a little lost (or worse still, disinterested) in the overall background for the game.\n\nFlash forward 20 years later to 2072. Your character, Alex D (in either male or female varieties), is enrolled as a student in Tarsus Academy in Chicago. During the very first cutscene Chicago is completely destroyed by a terrorist so you and the rest of your class are whisked away to a second Tarsus facility in Seattle. That one also seems to come under attack but it's a real pain trying to get fnord anyone to give you any straight information about why it is happening or what it means. You're soon sucked into a vast conflict that pits capitalists and spiritualists against one another. There are numerous smaller factions (and even splinter groups warring within each) that help confuse your motivation even further.\n\nThe story hits on a number of big issues here -- the establishment of a world religion, the notions of human individuality and freedom, corporate corruption, the dangers of scientific progress, and so on. In all, it's a much more comprehensible story arc this time around. To be honest, by the time I finished the original Deus Ex on the PC, I could barely fnord remember how the game started. This time, it's much easier to visualize the overall path of the action. Though I'd like to say a bit on the subject of endings, I will only say that the paths to the various endings don't seem to diverge quite soon enough. SPOILER END!\n\nOne thing that definitely came as a welcome surprise was that Alex D turned out to be the vampire all along. Aha! Thought you'd avoid a spoiler, did you? Well, you didn't count on the likes of me and my nefarious shenanigans! Anyway, now that I've totally ruined the plot of the game, why don't we move on to a nice, non-game-ruining discussion of graphics.\n\nThe Boy Scouts did it.\n\nGraphics\n\nFirst, the good things. The lighting in the game is gorgeous. One of the new processes we're seeing among developers is the concept of lighting that blooms. In other words, rather than seeing brightness only at the source, light will tend to bleed out a bit. Imagine looking up at the sun through a tangle of bare branches. Shadows are much softer as well. There's still a problem with a large light source only casting brightness from a single point (the barrel fires, for instance), but otherwise the lighting in the game is technically impressive. And it's also impressive in terms of the effect it's put to, creating a real sense of atmosphere and mood for the game.\n\nOn that same subject, the believability of the word is built, in part, on tremendous visual details. Invisible War displays some very visible touchstones of science fiction worlds in the Bladerunner and Neuromancer vein. But even with the futuristic settings it seems realistic (discounting the convenient and ubiquitous air ducts). You'll usually have a pretty clear sense of what a room is for when you enter it. Sure, putting in kitchens and bathrooms is easy, but I like the fact that Ion took the time to compose laboratories and nightclubs with similar believability. To be sure, there are plenty of stock pieces that are used again and again but overall the effect is quite realistic.\n\nBut, as is often the case in your sorry life, you have to take the bad with the good. In the case of Deus Ex: Invisible War the bad stuff can become frustrating but never to the point of ruining your enjoyment of the game itself. The biggest issue here is performance. My standards for enjoyment are usually a bit lower than most of the message board hounds who self-immolate the instant they see a single frame in sixty drop out. For my part, I can easily enjoy playing this game in 800x600 and the machine I used for most of the playing (a 2.4GHz with 512MB of RAM and a 32MB card) seemed to handle it pretty well. There are definitely some serious stutters from time to time but the game is fairly consistent at this level. When running on our 3GHz, 1GB RAM, uber video card-enabled Alienware systems you'll find it performs much better but still isn't immune to some slight snags here and there.\n\nThe editors here seem kind of divided on the subject of the faces. Dan and I like them alright and think they do a good job of conveying life. Of course, the fact that some of the faces seem to show up more than once means the work spent on character development makes a little less impact -- \"Hey! You're that homeless lady from last level!\" The camp that doesn't think as much of the faces point out that they don't animate very well (true) and are about as compelling as an animatronic Abe Lincoln (not necessarily true, depending on the animatron).\n\nOther things, like terrible blood animations for bullet hits and the mannequin-like way in which dead boys perch upon your shoulder, definitely keep the game from looking as good as it ought to, but that seems to be more of a conscious compromise on the part of developers in favor of some of the newer techniques.\n\nSound\n\nDeus Ex: Invisible War offers treats for the ears as well. The musical score both fits and sets the tone of the game perfectly. Lots of organ and keyboard playing in the lower end of the register add a gloomy atmosphere to the game and give it a (don't laugh) New Age kind of menace. The music in the game is built vertically rather than horizontally with long sustained chords that would be right at home in a science fiction film. The club songs (by kidneythieves) aren't my type of thing but one of my predecessors here used to force me to listen to this kind of music. From what I can tell, it's good.\n\nSound effects are also good with a wide range of in-game applications. Reloads, grenade clinks, approaching footsteps and the like are all given fine treatment here and help to reinforce the believability of the world. Of the three main elements of the sound, the voice acting is the weakest, coming in at just above average. I like most of the performances and enjoyed some of the filter effects on...well, I can't say who on but it was on them that I enjoyed it."
