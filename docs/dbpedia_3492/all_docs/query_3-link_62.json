        "text": "Although the documentary The Invisible War is a film that features heroic War Veterans. It displays emotional and sympathetic stories that captures the attention of the viewers. It shamefully uncovers the secrets of sexual assault within the U.S. Military. Created by Academy and Emmy award winners, Amy Ziering and Kirby Dick. In this film Ziering and Dick try to convince their audience of the ongoing rape epidemic surrounding the U.S. Military. A film intended to reach an audience unaware of the issues, Ziering and Dick take their viewers on a mission to seek justice. In the beginning of the film Ziering and Dick use emotional stories told by victims of sexual assault. This approach quickly bonds with the audience. Therefore, setting the tone of the film as personal and serious. Kori Cioca, a former member of the U.S. Coast Guard. Was sexually assaulted by a senior officer. The emotion in which she relayed her story was strong and intense. Cioca explains the assault in detail which left her with a dislocated jaw bone. Trisha McDonald describes being drugged and raped over a period of four times by her senior officer. These stories weigh heavily on the emotions of the audience causing them to feel more connected to the subject. Military records show over 20 percent of female veterans have been sexually assaulted(Ziering and Dick The Invisible War). As well as being assaulted, these women are then told no further action will be taken. 33 percent of military women do not report their sexual assault because the person to report to was a friend of the rapist(Ziering and Dick The Invisible War). Those who do come forward are punished for making such allegations. As the film continues it begins to show overwhelming evidence of lack of ... ... middle of paper ... ...onal testimony from various members of the U.S. Military. The film gave accurate encounters regarding the physical and sexual assaults occuring within the military. It showed ample evidence of how the military covered up most of the crimes that were presented to them. The film discloses how the 27 million spent on addressing the issue only led to a higher rape count. On the other hand, the film may have appeared biased. Since the filmmakers never contacted any of the accused. Many which will never face future consequences. Leaving the audience pondering over the thoughts of the offenders. \"A film to really explore the issue of rape within the U.S. Military\"(Rainer The Invisible War: movie review). It depicts the horrific physical disabilities that some of the women are left with after being assaulted. A documentary that has left these issues no longer invisible."
