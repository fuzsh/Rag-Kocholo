        "text": "Written in a brilliant way, Ralph Ellison’s “Invisible Man” captures the attention of the reader for its multi-layered perfection. The novel focuses an African American living in Harlem, New York. The novelist does not name his protagonist for a couple of reasons. One reason is to show his confusion of personal identity and the other to show he is “invisible”. Thus he becomes every Black American who is in search of their own identity. He is a true representative of the black community in America who is socially and psychologically dominated everywhere. The narrator is invisible to others because he is seen by the stereotypes rather than his true identity. He takes on several identities to find acceptance from his peers, but eventually\n\nThroughout all of the history of the United States of America, race has been a prevailing issue. Although the ways in which racism presented itself has changed, the prevalence of the problem has not. Ralph Ellison’s The Invisible Man does an excellent job of allowing some insight into the way racism has and still does impact the life and self identity of affected individuals. In this book, the narrator is faced with the challenges that come with being an African American in mid 1900s. The struggle first becomes something the narrator is aware of when his grandfather utters some troubling advice on his deathbed. He said in order to succeed in a white man’s world, you have to\n\nRalph Ellison’s Invisible Man is a story about an unnamed African American man trying to find a place for himself in white America. Throughout his life, he believes that his whole existence solely depends on recognition and approval of white people, which stems from him being taught to view whites as superior. The Invisible Man strives to correspond to the values and expectations of the dominate social group, but he is continuously unable to merge his socially imposed role as a black man with his internal concept of identity. In the end, he finally realizes that it is only up to himself to create his own identity without depending on the acceptance of whites, but on his own acceptance of himself. Invisible Man represents the critical\n\nRalph Ellison is one of the few figures in American literature that has the ability to properly place the struggles of his characters fluidly on paper. His dedication to properly depict the true plight of African Americans in this exclusionary society gave birth to one of the greatest novels in American history. Invisible Man is a novel which tells the story of an African American man, and his journey through a society which continuously refused to see him for who he truly was. In the novel Ellison gives us a main character without a name, this at first may shock any average reader but once one falls into the enchantments of the novel,\n\nRalph Ellison’s novel Invisible Man makes many valuable points about the treatment of black men at the hands of white America. However, in examining stereotypes and issues that effect black men, Ellison does not fully examine other groups who experience discrimination. While the protagonist does seem to understand that he occupies a similar position in society to white women, the women themselves do not get a chance to fully articulate their thoughts on the matter. Additionally, black women have even less of a presence in the novel and issues relating to them are never discussed. While Ellison’s nameless protagonist defies many stereotypes about black men and embarks on a journey toward consciousness, female characters in the novel are used as a tool to help the protagonist achieve this and they do not gain visibility for themselves.\n\nThe book’s main focus is on the gradual disillusionment of the narrator and his personal battles. In particular, the book develops the battle the narrator faces when he discovers the truth about the Brotherhood organization. He eventually realizes that they are using him for their own purposes and encouraged him to incite the blacks to a riotous level so they will kill one another. The narrator develops feelings of hopelessness when it becomes apparent that he is being betrayed by both white and black cultures. His overwhelming feeling of emptiness comes to a climax when he falls into a manhole during a riot. While hibernating in the underground black community, the narrator struggles to find meaning in his invisibility and to come up with his true identity. The seclusion allows the reader to realize the disillusionment of the narrator. Ellison does an incredible job of getting inside the narrator’s character and describing his emotional battle. At times it feels as if the text is purely his thoughts transcribed directly onto the page. The narrator traces back his history\n\nRalph Ellison’s Invisible Man tells the story of an intelligent black man who has been oppressed by various people throughout his life. Ellison’s novel proves to be deeply existential, showing the essence of what it means to be a human being and actually existing with others while at the same time being independent. The nameless protagonist deals endlessly with authenticity, absurdity, and alienation—conditions Ellison links to the harsh realities of being black in America. This protagonist tries to find meaning in the life that he is living, but ultimately discovers that no place in the world . Meaning becomes illusive when forced to live with dehumanization. He finds himself unable to actualize being in a society that fails to see his\n\nAfter arriving in New York, the protagonist encounters a yam seller on the street. The narrator comments that since the yams look good, he know they are going to taste good as well, the yam seller replies, “you right, but everything that looks good ain’t necessarily good”(264). Although the narrator believes this statement is just about yams, it actually links to all of the ideas the narrator held throughout the novel up to this point. While the narrator is attending the college, he notices the statue of the Founder lifting the veil off a slave’s head could be interpreted as the veil being lifted or the veil being pushed further down. The statue represents how the ideas of the Founder can be perceived as bad when one is not undermining the wishes of the whites, and they can be viewed as good by others who accept the white authority. This quote also can refer to the Battle Royal and the speech that the narrator gives at his graduation. The narrator believes that the Battle Royal is a good thing, because it means that he gets to present his speech to a white audience that will judge him properly, but in reality the Battle Royal was a terrible abuse of the authority the whites held over the young black men. The protagonist’s naivete creates turmoil and obstacles for him throughout the novel that help shape the narrator and lead to the revelation he has\n\nRalph Ellison's Invisible Man was published at a time when America was racially divided. The novel presents the theme of the lack of black identity – a theme supported by the fact that the protagonist, Invisible Man, has no name. The reader knows the names of Dr. Bledsoe, Ras-the-Exhorter, Brother Jack and others - but the reader does not know the name of the main character. Ellison's leaves it to the reader to decide who he is and, on a larger scale, how white America perceives black America.\n\nThe narrator’s invisibility first comes up in Chapter One, where he is invited to a community meeting consisting of prestigious white citizens. He comes to this meeting believing that he is to give a speech to represent his high school. He believes that in dictating a speech, the narrator will be recognized by the white community for his intelligence. Unfortunately, he is turned into entertainment when he is forced to fight in a “battle royal” with other black men. After being beaten blindfolded and pushed into an electrocuted carpet, the narrator still gathers up the strength to dictate his speech, only to find the white men “still [talking] and still [laughing], as though deaf with cotton in dirty ears” (p30). The author Ralph Ellison\n\nIn Ralph Ellison’s Invisible Man, we are presented with an unnamed narrator whose values and potentials are invisible to the world around him. Throughout the entirety of the novel, we see the unnamed narrator, also known as the Invisible Man, struggle in an attempt to uncover his identity buried beneath African American oppression and an aggregation of deception. Ellison shows us how lies and deceit may serve as a grave but invaluable obstacle to one’s journey to find their identity. Through the use of imagery, symbols, and motifs of blindness along with invisibility, Ellison portrays the undeniable obstacle that deception plays in one’s ability to establish their identity along with the necessity of it."
