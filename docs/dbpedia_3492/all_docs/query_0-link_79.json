        "text": "Angelique Vasquez\n\nProfessor Scala\n\nWGS 4100\n\nI recently saw the documentary, The Invisible War (Kirby Dick, Amy Ziering). The Invisible War exposes the epidemic of rape and sexual assault in the U.S. military, and by using personal stories and the government’s own figures and statistics from Department of Defense reports over the years, the film demonstrates what it means to serve in the military if you’re a woman.

Major General Mary Kay Hertog, who took over as head of SAPRO, fervently defends the military judicial system’s chain of command process and insists that “there is no conflict of interest.” Major General Hertog suggests to women who feel they were not given a fair and just investigation?
