        "text": "Deus Ex: Invisible War is player agency done right\n\nIt terms of gameplay I found it even jankier than OG, coupled with less interesting environments and less combat options, and it was a nightmare getting it to run on PC\n\nBut setting the gameplay aside, it was the story, characters, and player agency that grabbed me and kept me playing.\n\nMy hot take is that Invisible War has a better story than OG.\n\nThe OG may have allowed you to approach levels however you wanted, but it was still an incredibly linear game. JC Denton made no decisions, he just dumbly went along with whatever the latest voice in his ear told him to do.\n\nThe player in OG is given no choices that have real consequences. And without consequences, choices are meaningless.\n\nThen head into Deus Ex: Invisible War.\n\nStarting right out the gate, right after escaping from the first mission, Alex is immediately given free range to play the sides in the titular war.\n\nAt least when I was playing her, Alex was a conniving backstabbing double-triple-quadruple agent whose loyalties switched based on whoever most benefited her to side with at that particular moment.\n\nThe best example I can give of this is an anecdote:\n\nNot long after breaking my leash and being able to explore the first area, I found a night club. In it, the owner asked me to commit some crimes, in exchange I'd be allowed into the VIP lounge. Elsewhere in the club, there's also a police informant who will pay you money to report what goes on in the VIP lounge. So I do the crime, get the VIP access, and in there meet another criminal organization called the Omar that says \"hey, we'll give you a discount for our illegal augmentations if you steal something from the club owner.\"\n\nSo I did crime for the club owner for cash, then betrayed the club to the Omar for augmentations, and then betrayed the Omar to the police for more cash.\n\nAnd you know who told me to do all that? Nobody, that was just something I came up with and the game let me do.\n\nTHAT is player agency done right!\n\nAnd it was a side-quest! In the main quest, you basically get the option to backstab the faction you're working with every single mission!\n\nMy Alex had basically 0 loyalty, and was using the main factions just as much as they were using her.\n\nAnd it was amazing that the game lets you do this, and face the consequences of this behavior in the final mission. At which point I betrayed literally everybody, and accidentally ushered in a posthumanist apocalypse.\n\nIt was especially cathartic after playing OG Deus Ex, where JC gets led around the nose by everybody with his phone number and dumbly going along with whatever the latest voice in his head told him to do.\n\nEven if you choose to remain loyal to a faction, the option being there makes the choice to stay loyal more significant. Because you could have betrayed them, but chose not to.\n\nAs JC, you're constantly getting tricked.\n\nAs Alex, you can be the trickster.\n\nThis is my call to action for folks to stop hating Invisible War on reputation alone without having played it themselves. Give it a chance! (Assuming you can get the garbage PC Port to run)"
