        "text": "Summary: \"The Bible is clear: if you are a Christian, you are at war. But our approach to spiritual warfare usually falls into one of two extremes--either we place an undue emphasis on Satan and his powers or we completely ignore the existence of a personal enemy. The Invisible War offers a balanced look at what the Bible says on the subject. Based on Paul's teaching in Ephesians 6, this book shows every believer what we need to know about Satan, demons, and spiritual warfare. Find out how to: prepare yourself for spiritual battle; cultivate invincible faith; find freedom from demonic influence. \"Most Christians have no idea how much of their daily life is influenced by the subtle deception and lies of our adversary,\" says Chip Ingram. The Invisible War will help you understand your power and position in Christ, and how to practically put on the full armor of God, and stand firm against the enemy.\"--From publisher's website.\n\nAuthor Notes: Chip Ingram was born in 1954 in Columbus, Ohio.
