        "text": "Griffith was Gance’s hero, met him when Gance travelled to America to show his anti-war film ‘J’accuse’, and offered him facilities to work there. Honegger composed music for ‘Napoléon’, and Artaud acted the part of Marat in it. Cendrars worked as his assistant for a while. Eisenstein and Pudovkin visited him in France and thanked him for teaching them editing (Gance did Russian-style editing before the Russians)."
