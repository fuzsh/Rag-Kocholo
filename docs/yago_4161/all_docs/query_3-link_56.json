        "text": "A film by Abel Gance\n\nAcclaimed as one of cinema's finest anti-war movies, Abel Gance's rousing indictment of warfare is as powerful and relevant today as it was on its original release in 1938\n\nHaving experienced the horror of the First World War, idealistic poet Jean Diaz (Victor Francen, A Farewell to Arms) turns to technology in a bid to prevent further barbarity. But a meddling and unscrupulous bureaucracy allows Jean's plans to be hijacked as Europe slides towards another great conflict.\n\nUsing his epic 1919 silent version of the film as a template, Gance pits mankind's romanticism against its capacity for savagery. Originally released on the eve of the Second World War (and the same year as Jean Renoir's La Grande Illusion), J'accuse urges us to honour the memory of the fallen by learning the lessons of a catastrophic past.\n\nSpecial features\n\n* Presented in High Definition and Standard Definition\n\n* New audio commentary by Paul Cuff\n\n* Stills and special collections gallery\n\n* Illustrated booklet with full film credits, reviews and a new essay by Paul Cuff\n\nFrance 1938 black and white 119 minutes French language with English subtitles original aspect ratio 1.37:1 Cert 12 (Scenes of war horror, distressing scenes, injury detail)\n\nREVIEW\n\n'An impassioned plea for mercy.heart-rending' --Slant Magazine"
