        "text": "THIS FILM IS THE GREETING\n\nAND HOMAGE\n\nTO THE CINEMA OF THE GREATEST\n\nLIVING MASTER.\n\nThe Palace is the new film by Roman Polanski, produced by Eliseo entertainment by Luca Barbareschi with Rai Cinema, an international co-production made with Lucky BOB (Poland), CAB Productions (Switzerland) and RP Productions (France). A new production partnership that sees Polanski and Barbareschi together again after J’Accuse, winner of the Grand Critics’ Prize at the Venice Film Festival in 2019.\n\nIt is December 31, 1999 – New Year’s Eve of the new millennium. At the Palace Hotel, a sumptuous castle in the Swiss Alps, rich, vicious and spoiled guests converge welcomed by a host of waiters, porters, cooks and receptionists. The stories of the individual characters give life to an absurd, black, provocative comedy.\n\nThe screenplay was written by the director together with the great screenwriter Jerzy Skolimovski and Ewa Piąskowska. The cast boasts a shortlist of international characters: Oliver Masucci, Mickey Rourke, Fanny Ardant, John Cleese, Luca Barbareschi, Fortunato Cerlino.\n\nThe film, which will be released in 2023, will enjoy important visual effects and a shooting technique of the highest level. Added value will be given by the editing by Hervé De Luze and the music of the great composer Alexandre Desplat."
