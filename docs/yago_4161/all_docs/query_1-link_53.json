Made on a shoestring budget of less than $30,000 this painful, angry film has won over 120 Best Documentary Awards and film festival selections across the world and has become one of the key weapons in the ongoing fight for Holocaust Truth. J’Accuse! also powerfully challenges the silence of the EU, the UN, and NATO… and asks if the Holocaust has ceased to have moral meaning.\n\nDirector"
