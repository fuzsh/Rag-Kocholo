        "meta_description": "J’Accuse (1919)\r\nSilent film, directed by Abel Gance. \r\nAt once a denunciation of the Great War and a monument to those who fought in it, Abel Gance’s 1919 epic J’accuse explores the cataclysmic changes brought about by this conflict—from the age-old traditions of life before the war, to the unifying patriotism experienced at its outbreak, and finally to the immeasurable scope of its destruction.  Combing a fictional narrative with authentic footage from the front, Gance’s silent masterpiece remains as troubling today as it did almost 100 years ago.\r\nIntroduced by University of Texas Assistant Professor Herve Picherit.\r\nRuntime 166 minutes.\r\nThis screening is made possible by the French Embassy's Centers of Excellence grant, in partnership with the Center for European Studies, the Harry Ransom Center, Institut Français and the Department of French and Italian.",
