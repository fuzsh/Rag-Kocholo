        "text": "The Venice Film Festival played host to an uncomfortable scene this weekend, as director and convicted sex offender Roman Polanski garnered rapturous applause for his new film, J’Accuse. (English title: An Officer and a Spy.. Polanski—who fled the United States decades ago and was expelled from the Motion Picture Academy in 2018—did not receive the applause in person, though journalists reportedly cheered co-producer Luca Barbareschi’s assertion that the event was “a film festival, not a moral trial.”\n\nVulture documented the strange scene, which featured cast member Emmanuelle Seigner (also Polanski’s third wife) and star Louis Garrel sharing nothing but praise for the absent Polanski’s direction. Co-star Jean Dujardin reportedly wished all actors “the good fortune of one day working with Polanski;” attempts from journalists to reference Polanski’s criminal history were met with both shutdowns from producers and further applause.\n\nPolanski is alleged to have drugged and raped then-13-year-old Samantha Gailey in 1977 (he was 43 at the time), and was subsequently charged with distributing a controlled substance to a minor, perversion, a lewd and lascivious act upon a child, sodomy, and rape by use of drugs. He pleaded guilty to unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor, but fled the United States midway through a 90-day psychiatric evaluation for fear of serving further prison time. He has not returned since, and is speculated to have skipped the J’Accuse premiere in light of Italy’s extradition treaty with the United States.\n\nMultiple women have since come forth alleging Polanski sexually assaulted them. British actress Charlotte Lewis claimed in 2010 that Polanski forced himself on her when she was 16 years-old (her account was disputed in separate interviews), while in 2017 German actress Renate Langer alleged Polanski raped her in 1972, when she was 15 (Polanski declined to comment at the time). Artist Marianne Barnard also accused Polanski of sexually molesting her at the age of 10 years-old (Polanski’s lawyer, Harland Braun, denied the allegation). The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences expelled Polanski from their ranks in 2018, after having awarded him a best director Oscar for The Pianist in 2003.\n\nAs for the film itself, J’Accuse chronicles the early 20th century “Dreyfus Affair,” in which Alfred Dreyfus (played by Garrel in the film), a Jewish officer in the French Army, was fraudulently convicted of giving military secrets to the Germans, sentenced to lifetime imprisonment, and banished to a prison island. (He was later exonerated and freed.) Polanski made no secret of parallels to his own conviction in a recent interview with French writer Pascal Bruckner, who called the allegations “present-day neo-feminist McCarthyism.”\n\n“In the story, I sometimes find moments I have experienced myself, I can see the same determination to deny the facts and condemn me for things I have not done,” Polanski said in the interview, which was included in official film notes distributed to press. “Most of the people who harass me do not know me and know nothing about the case. . . . I must admit that I am familiar with many of the workings of the apparatus of persecution shown in the film, and that has clearly inspired me.”\n\nMovies\n\nReintroducing Humphrey Bogart: The Untold Stories of a Hollywood Icon’s Volatile Private Life\n\nThe Casablanca star’s career was shaped by his relationships with women, from his distant mother to the love of his life, Lauren Bacall. Those stories come to the forefront in a new documentary, Bogart: Life Comes in Flashes.\n\nMovies\n\nLiza Minnelli Is Writing a Memoir Because She’s “Mad as Hell”\n\nIn a statement to People, Minnelli expressed disappointment with other representations of her life and revealed that she’s releasing a memoir set to hit stands in spring of 2026: “It’s my own damn story.”\n\nAward Season\n\nVenice and Toronto Film Festival Lineups Raise Our Oscar Hopes\n\nHotly anticipated films like Joker: Folie à Deux and The Piano Lesson are mixed with some wild cards that could shake up awards season.\n\nAward Season\n\nNatasha Lyonne, Elizabeth Olsen, and Carrie Coon Hold Nothing Back in the Wrenching His Three Daughters\n\nThe three stars exclusively share the trailer for their widely acclaimed Netflix drama, and go deep on their vulnerable powerhouse performances: “I let go so completely.”\n\nAward Season\n\nHow Will the Presidential Election Affect This Year’s Oscar Race?\n\nThe outcome of the 2016 election was ever present at the Academy Awards that followed four months later. Could this year be the same?\n\nMovies\n\nWatch Timothée Chalamet Sing as Bob Dylan in First A Complete Unknown Trailer\n\nThe actor previously revealed that he worked with Austin Butler’s Elvis team to morph into the famed folk singer.\n\nHollywood\n\nDan Stevens Is Down to Get Weird\n\nMore than a decade after leaving Downton Abbey, the Cuckoo star reflects on what he’s learned—and passed on to costar Hunter Schafer: “I think it was refreshing and delightful for her to realize that not every job needs to be like Euphoria.”\n\nStyle\n\nRadhika Jones on Jenna Ortega’s Rise to Stardom\n\nThe VF editor in chief charts the September cover star’s trajectory from nine-year-old working actor to global name—and now a producer on Wednesday.\n\nMovies\n\nLee Isaac Chung’s Childhood Trauma Drew Him to Twisters\n\nIn the next installment of Vanity Fair’s What Is Cinema? series, director Lee Isaac Chung breaks down his inspirations for Twisters.\n\nMovies\n\nThe Dude Is Voting for Kamala Harris\n\nJeff Bridges, star of The Big Lebowski, hopped on the “White Dudes for Harris\" fundraiser call and pledged his support for the Democratic Nominee: \"I’m white, I’m a dude, and I’m for Harris.”"
