        "text": "Quick question. I've built a Drummer track and tweaked the track to my liking using the X/Y pad and other settings. However, I would really like to restrict the snare hits to rim shots during certain parts of the arrangement, without changing the complexity or velocity of the overall Drummer track. Is there a way to do this?\n\nAs a follow up question, how about when working with accents where you want a single kick & cymbal hit. I've gotten it to work with fiddling with the fill & X/Y pad, but didn't know if there was a better way.\n\nThanks."
