Obviously the chocolate track has a busy kick drum and Dollaly has a busy rimshot/extra snare working around the snare on 2 and 4.\n\nEffects would be reverb, compression and sidechain.\n\nCan you show me some screen shot of the pattern in sequencer like fl studio or ableton.\n\nI actually made a garage beat sort of on accident while jamming the other day, it really is exactly as described above by @anon64972012 . Rather than following formulas it will really help your production to just visualise it and jam, it won’t take you long to get there. just place kicks where you think they should be and then move onto the next track, tweak swing\n\nthat is no good. does not sound nothing like the above track drums…\n\nscreen shots please …\n\nPeople will probably not put the work in for you.\n\nIf you want to copy those two patterns, loop the track up and copy the beat tick by tick, sound by sound.\n\nThe above tutorials beat is a very good example, might not be the exact same thing, but it’s close enough, and it’s up to you to express yourself.\n\nTake tevtrack you like and find a section with just the drums. Put into Ableton and convert it to a midi track - it is pretty decent at picking out the kick, snare, and hihats.\n\nSorry I don’t have Ableton,\n\nOnly FL Studio.\n\nAny chance you can do it and show me some print screens (images).\n\nyou want us to make the track for you too ?\n\nlol …?\n\nThat will be great if you can please do it and YouTube the video url to me.\n\nNo problem, here you go\n\nlmao\n\nCan you please stop spamming …\n\nSerious post only.\n\nThank you.\n\nGoogle magic alakaxam!!!\n\nWe are nice, dropping links and guiding you in the right direction, perhaps you should work on your production skills. Learn how to copy a basic drum pattern like the one in sweet like a chocolate.\n\nBottom line, you gotta put in yer own work.\n\nWether you’re ripping it off or learning.\n\nUse a drum machine with swing.\n\nHomesss…check attackmagazine…there is a section BEAT DISSECTED …all you need!\n\ncheers"
