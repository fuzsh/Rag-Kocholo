        "text": "Below is the November 1988 review of Super Classics and the recently re introduced Black Beauty (bronze). It's a very thorough and also favorable review.\n\nThe last time we featured a Ludwig\n\ndrumkit in Product Close-Up was March of\n\n1986, when we covered that company's\n\nRocker II series. Since then, Ludwig has\n\nintroduced a new line, called the Super\n\nClassic series. These drums feature relatively\n\nthin (4-ply) maple shells with no reinforcing\n\nrings, in an effort to return to the\n\ntype of construction and sound that made\n\nLudwig drums the standard of the industry\n\nin the '50s and '60s. But the kits also feature\n\nLudwig's top-of-the-line Modular series\n\nhardware, so they are by no means\n\nhistorical recreations or throwbacks. The\n\nSuper Classics are offered by Ludwig as\n\nhigh-quality, professional drums, intended\n\nto provide an alternative sound to the majority\n\nof the kits on the market today.\n\nThe kit we tested was the LS-4426-MM\n\nmodel, and consisted of a 16x22 bass drum,\n\n9x10 and 11x12 deep rack toms, and 12x13\n\nand 13x14 suspended \"floor\" toms. A 6 1/2\n\nx14 Supra-Phonic snare drum is standard\n\nwith the kit. The kit was finished in Ludwig's\n\nClassic Mahogany stain, and was fitted with\n\nLudwig's Silver Dot Rocker heavy-duty bat-\n\nLudwig Super Classic Kit\n\nters and clear Rocker bottom heads. The\n\nbass drum featured a black Rocker Ludwiglogo\n\nfront head.\n\nThe Sound\n\nLet's start with the most important element\n\nof any drumkit: its sound. These drums\n\nsound terrific! The thin shells allow for a\n\ntremendous amount of resonance, and a\n\nbright, cutting attack. I used the kit on several\n\nof my gigs, and my band commented\n\non how huge they sounded—especially the\n\nbass drum. I was impressed by the timpanilike\n\nsustain that the toms provided; I actually\n\nhad to muffle them a bit to keep them\n\nunder control (which I normally never do\n\non any drum). This means that they still\n\nhad lots of \"headroom\" for power and resonance,\n\nshould it have been necessary.\n\nThe bass drum was deep and boomy,\n\nowing to the depth of the shell and the intact\n\nfront head. Concerned at first about\n\nthis boominess, I originally planned to cut\n\na hole in the front head to control some of\n\nthe overring. But I found that a small piece\n\nof suede taped to the batter head a couple\n\nof inches below the beater impact point\n\ndeadened the impact just enough to keep\n\nthe bass drum controlled without losing\n\nthat big, fat sound. I was able to use the\n\ndrum at moderate volume and still retain a\n\nfull, round, bottomy character; when I really\n\nhit the drum hard, I swear I could see\n\nplaster falling off the ceiling of the club.\n\nNow, I must point out that all of this\n\ntremendous sound was produced by the\n\ndrums after I made a significant drumhead\n\nchange. When we first received the kit, it\n\nwas fitted with Ludwig's Silver Dot batters\n\non all the toms and the bass drum. Everyone\n\nat MD played the kit, and we all agreed\n\nthat the heads did not serve the kit well.\n\nThey tended to sound too thin and \"attacky\"\n\n(owing to their single-ply construction\n\nand thick plastic dot) on drums that\n\nalready had a bright sound with a lot of\n\ncut. The bass drum especially sounded thin\n\nand high-pitched. The bottom heads\n\nseemed to resonate just fine; the problem\n\nseemed restricted to the top heads. So we\n\nchanged them over to Remo Pinstripes on\n\nthe toms, and a clear Emperor on the bass\n\ndrum. The difference was amazing! The\n\ndrums seemed to come into their own, producing\n\ndepth and tone and projection that\n\nwere truly impressive.\n\nPart two-\n\nIn fairness to Ludwig's drumheads, keep\n\nin mind that the qualities desired from a\n\ngiven head selection will vary with every\n\ndrummer. You might find that the attack\n\nproduced by a Silver Dot head in combination\n\nwith a Super Classic drum is just\n\nwhat you're looking for. With any new set\n\nof drums, an experienced drummer is likely\n\nto experiment with many different brands\n\nand types of drumheads in order to find the\n\nbest combination for his or her personal\n\ntastes and needs. This just serves to illustrate\n\nhow important it is not to judge the\n\nperformance of any kit on the basis of a\n\ncouple of whacks with a stick in the dealer's\n\nshowroom.\n\nIn terms of overall pitch relationships, I\n\nwould have preferred a kit with more traditional\n\nfloor tom sizes. I know that smaller,\n\nsuspended toms are quite popular today—\n\nespecially for recording. But although the\n\nindividual sound of each drum on our test\n\nkit was quite large and powerful, and the\n\nintervals between them quite distinct, there's\n\nno way to achieve the pitch of a 16x16\n\nfloor tom on a 13x14 suspended drum.\n\nHowever, Ludwig has already considered\n\nthis, and notes in its catalog that this same\n\nkit configuration is available with drums in\n\nseveral different sizes, including a 14x15\n\nsuspended tom as the largest size. I certainly\n\nwould like to have heard a 16x16\n\ntraditional floor tom from this series; I tend\n\nto think it would have rivaled a timpani!\n\nThe Supra-Phonic snare drum has been\n\none of Ludwig's most popular snares for\n\nyears. It is a fine, well-designed, good sounding\n\nchrome snare. Our test drum had\n\nall the qualities you would expect from a\n\nmetal snare drum: cut, projection, a loud,\n\ncracking rimshot sound, and crisp snare\n\nresponse. The 6 1/2\" shell depth gave the\n\nsnare a full-bodied sound. As is the case\n\nwith most metal snares, any attempt to bring\n\nthe pitch of the drum up too high resulted\n\nin a soup-kettle clanginess. (If you want a\n\nhigher-pitched snare, Ludwig offers a 5\"\n\nmodel in this same series.) The Ludwig\n\nwhite-coated Rocker batter head sounded\n\nfine on the drum when the appropriate\n\namount of ring control was applied. (I used\n\na medium Noble & Cooley Zero Ring.)\n\nDesign And Construction\n\nThe overall workmanship and quality\n\ncontrol on our test kit was absolutely flawless.\n\nParticularly nice was the fact that the\n\ndrumshells were stained on the inside and\n\noutside, including even the bearing edges.\n\nThis gave a very rich, deep appearance to\n\nthe overall kit, considering the clear bottom\n\nheads that allowed a view of the insides\n\nof the drums. Ludwig applies a clear\n\nlacquer to the insides of all Super Classic\n\nshells. This provides both a moisture seal\n\nand a reflective surface for sound that undoubtedly\n\ncontributes to the drums' cutting\n\npower.\n\nThe bearing edges of all the drums were\n\nperfect. Ludwig points out in its catalog\n\nthat every bearing\n\nedge is machine feathered\n\n\"for optimum\n\nshell-to-head\n\ncontact\" and then\n\nhand waxed. I could\n\nfeel the smoothness\n\nof the waxed bearing\n\nedge when I was\n\nchanging the heads,\n\nand can attest to the\n\nway the heads fitted\n\nquickly and evenly\n\non the drum. This\n\ncontributed to a very\n\neasy tuning process.\n\nAnother contribution\n\nto tuning was\n\nmade by the tension\n\nlugs and lug receivers.\n\nWhen loosened,\n\nevery tension lug\n\nspun smoothly and\n\nquietly on and off\n\neach drum with the\n\nmerest twirl of a\n\ndrumkey. (And remember,\n\nI changed\n\na lot of heads.) And\n\nyet, once tensioned,\n\neach lug stayed in\n\nplace; I had no\n\nproblem with needing\n\nto re-tune any of\n\nthe heads constantly.\n\nThis is evidence\n\nof excellent\n\nmachining—an attribute\n\nI found present\n\nthroughout the\n\nkit."
