        "text": "STICKINGS\n\nDrumline is a precision activity, and that means the players need to all use the same stickings. A good drumline arranger will always include stickings for snares, tenors, and bass drum unisons. Here is a description of the letters used:\n\n“R” - play with your right hand\n\n“L” - play with your left hand\n\n“B” - play with both hands\n\nSome arrangers will capitalize accented/loud notes and use lowercase for taps/quiet notes. This helps the reader see the dynamics through the sticking and can aid in learning new music more quickly and accurately.\n\nDYNAMICS\n\nAs in all music, dynamics are used to express the volume that notes should be played. There is nothing too different from traditional music notation in this regard, but it is worth noting that some arrangers will indicate stick heights instead of dynamics. A stick height is a measurement of how far the stick is from the drumhead when you strike it. Greater height with equal force translates to more volume. Here is a height system that is generally used:\n\npianissimo (pp) - one inch stick height\n\npiano (p) - three inch stick height\n\nmezzo-piano (mp) - six inch stick height\n\nmezzo-forte (mf) - nine inch stick height\n\nforte (f) - twelve inch stick height\n\nfortissimo (ff) - fifteen inch stick height\n\nACCENTS\n\nIn drumline notation, accents are crucial to creating interesting textures and musical phrases. Generally, an accent will indicate to play at the specified dynamic, while unaccented notes will usually be performed at a “piano” (p) dynamic. For example: the third measure of this example for the snare drums is a long triplet roll at “forte.” Because only the first note of the measure is accented, only that note is actually “forte,” and the rest of the roll would be played at “piano.”\n\nThis concept can be a little confusing at first. One idea that might help would be to remember that most notes in drumline music are piano, and we refer to them as “taps.” Let your accents reflect the written dyanmics, and let everything else (generally) be “piano.”\n\nROLLS\n\nOpen rolls and buzz rolls are distinguished by slashes on the stem of the note.\n\nOpen rolls, also know as double stroke rolls, are indicated with a single slash. This slash means two notes should be performed per every one written note.\n\nBuzz rolls, also know as multiple bounce rolls or press rolls, are indicated with a “Z” slash through the note. This means that multiple notes per hand should be performed per every one written note.\n\nSometimes longer note durations will be given without sticking. It would then be up to the performers to agree upon a “hand speed” (how many motions per roll they will perform). In my drumline compositions, I try to always indicate the hand speed to ease the burden on the performers. However, both methods are commonly used."
