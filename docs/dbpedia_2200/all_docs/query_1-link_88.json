        "text": "Small Size. Big Beats.\n\nRoland TR drum machines have impacted music for over 40 years—and they’re as influential now as ever. Based on the much-loved TR-8S, the compact and affordable TR-6S has the same speaker-pummeling, window-rattling, body-moving sound of its bigger sibling. Elevate your drum tracks, make beats on the go, and experience the joy of hands-on production. With the TR-6S, the sound of classic tracks, today’s trends, and tomorrow’s hits are always within reach.\n\nSix-track version of the TR-8S in a compact and affordable package\n\nDetailed circuit models of the Roland TR-808, TR-909, TR-606, TR-707, CR-78, and more\n\nLarge preset sample library with support for custom user samples\n\nEditable FM sound engine for futuristic tones\n\nProgram basslines with the newly developed TR-808 chromatic bass instrument\n\nMix and match sounds for exotic hybrid drum kits\n\nAdvanced sequencer with sub steps, flam, step loop, motion recording, probability, sub step probability, master probability, and more\n\nRuns on four AA batteries or USB bus power\n\nAlso functions as a high-quality USB audio/MIDI interface\n\nSix tracks of rhythmic bliss.\n\nWith the TR-6S, you get six tracks of advanced drum sequencing and the most iconic rhythm sounds in music history—all in a battery-powered box that fits just about anywhere. And like other Roland drum machines, it’s fun and inspiring. With the familiar step sequencer plus dedicated faders and knobs, it’s easy to craft custom beats with visceral, hands-on control.\n\nAll the sounds and more.\n\nThe TR-6S includes faithful recreations of the TR-808, TR-606, TR-909, TR-707, and TR-727, along with several modified versions. You also get the CR-78 CompuRhythm, a direct predecessor of the TR-808 that’s left its own indelible footprint on pop classics from the 1980s and beyond. And these aren't sample packs or cheap knock-offs—they're living, breathing replicas that sound and behave just like their vintage counterparts. Going further, you can mix and match these sounds with preset and custom samples and futuristic FM tones, creating exotic hybrid kits that reflect your unique taste and style.\n\nThe gold standard in drum programming.\n\nThe sound of today's music owes a lot to the classic step sequencer—particularly the “TR-REC” variety found in early Roland drum machines. The TR-6S employs the same tried-and-true approach, enhanced with real-time recording and modern features like sub steps for ratcheted parts, probability for creating unpredictability, and motion recording for 808 basslines that bounce and rhythms that move.\n\nPositive effects.\n\nCreate punch, space, warmth, or grit with the array of high-quality effects in the TR-6S. Vital compressors and EQs are at your fingertips, along with lush reverb, delay, and modulation effects. Push your creative boundaries with filters, LFOs, and wild new effects that incite sonic mayhem.\n\nConvenience and flexibility.\n\nThe TR-6S is a also a high-quality USB audio/MIDI interface, perfect for mobile or minimal production setups. And it fits in even the most space-starved studios or live rigs, so you can turn life into music whenever inspiration strikes.\n\nHardware meets software.\n\nEnhance your workflow with TR-EDITOR, a fluid computer-based editor and librarian for the TR-6S. Nimbly design and edit patterns and kits with the intuitive graphic interface, which features a wide array of onscreen parameters and access to deeper FM editing. And with the large display, it’s easy to manage your entire library. Download TR-EDITOR for free today through Roland Cloud Manager, the software interface for Roland Cloud content.\n\nTR-EDITOR\n\nSpecifications\n\nUser Drum Kit\n\n128\n\nUser Patterns\n\n128\n\nStep Sequencer\n\n6 instrument parts\n\n16 steps per 1 variation\n\n8 (A - H) variations per 1 pattern\n\n2 Fill-in patterns per 1 pattern\n\nINST tone\n\n(Tone can be assigned to each 6 instrument parts freely.)\n\nBASS DRUM: 11 ACB tones\n\nSNARE DRUM: 8 ACB tones\n\nTOM: 19 ACB tones\n\nRIM SHOT: 3 ACB tones\n\nHAND CLAP: 5 ACB tones\n\nHI HAT: 8 ACB tones\n\nCYMBAL: 8 ACB tones\n\nPERCUSSION: 24 ACB tones\n\nFM: 72 tones\n\nPRESET SAMPLE: 300 tones or greater\n\nUSER SAMPLE (imported form SD CARD for playback): Avarable format: WAV, AIFF\n\nTotal time for all samples: Approximately 600 sec (at 44.1 kHz, mono)\n\n* The maximum length of a single audio file that can be imported is approximately 180 seconds (at 44.1 kHz).\n\n* Available format of Sample:\n\nWAV 96 kHz maximum/8bits, 16 bits, 24 bits, 32 bits, 32 bits float (mono, stereo)\n\nAIFF 44.1kHz, 48kHz, 96 kHz/8bits, 16 bits, 24 bits, 32 bits, 32 bits float (mono, stereo)\n\nEffects\n\nINST FX: THRU, HPF, LPF, LPF/HPF, H BOOST, L BOOST, L/H BOOST, ISOLATOR, TRANSIENT, COMPRESSOR, DRIVE, COMP+DRV, CRUSHER, SATURATOR, FREQ SHIFT, RING MOD, SPREAD\n\nREVERB: AMBI, ROOM, HALL1, HALL2, PLATE, MOD, HA-DOU\n\nDELAY: DLY, PAN, TAPE ECHO, PITCH SHIFT\n\nMASTER FX: HPF, LPF, LPF/HPF, H BOOST, L BOOST, L/H BOOST, ISOLATOR, TRANSIENT, TRANSIENT2, COMPRESSOR, DRIVE, OVERDRIVE, DISTORTION, FUZZ, CRUSHER, PHASER, FLANGER, SBF, NOISE, FATTENER, VINYL SIM\n\nOther: SCATTER (as one of AUTO FILL IN function), SIDE CHAIN\n\nDisplay\n\n16 characters, 2 line (backlit LCD)\n\nExternal Storage\n\nSD Card (SDHC supported) for backup/restore function and import sample data\n\nConnectors\n\nPHONES jack: Stereo miniature phone type\n\nOUT(L/MONO, R) jacks: 1/4-inch phone type\n\nMIDI(IN, OUT) connectors\n\nUSB port: USB B type (Audio, MIDI)\n\nPower Supply\n\nNi-MH battery (AA, HR6) x 4\n\nAlkaline battery (AA, LR6) x 4\n\nObtained via USB port (USB bus power)\n\nCurrent Draw\n\n500 mA\n\nExpected battery life under continuous use\n\nAlkaline battery: Approx. 4.5 hours\n\nNi-MH battery: Approx. 5.5 hours (When using batteries having a capacity of 1,900 mAh.)\n\n* This can vary depending on the specifications of the batteries, capacity of the batteries, and the conditions of use.\n\nAccessories\n\nLeaflet \"Read Me First\"\n\nAlkaline battery (AA, LR6) x 4\n\nDimensions\n\n224(W) x 132(D) x 60.1(H) mm\n\n8-13/16(W) x 5-3/16(D) x 2-3/8(H) inches\n\nWeight (including batteries)\n\n705 g\n\n1 lb 9 oz\n\n<% for (var i=0,len=images.length; i <% } %>\n\nVideo Library\n\nTR-8S v3.0/TR-6S v2.0 Firmware Update Overview\n\nThe TR-8S and TR-6S Rhythm Performers continue their sonic evolution with TR-8S v3.0 and TR-6S v2.0 updates.\n\nA Few Minutes with Junior Simba\n\nFrom Africa to the United Kingdom, eclectic dance star Junior Simba shares his passion for infusing ethnic sounds into his songcraft.Read more…\n\nCR-78: The Whole Story\n\nBefore the TR-808 and TR-909 changed hip-hop and dance, the CR-78 changed pop.
