        "text": "Rimshot-Locs\n\nLoad and Lock\n\nby Dendy Jarrett\n\nIt happens— You’re playing your snare on a kickin’ song, and you suddenly realize that the drum is dropping in pitch.\n\nYou can’t stop it. Gravity and the laws of physics are working against you. When you play a snare (whether playing the rim or not), you're exerting a downward force. If you could capture each downward impact on the drum with an extreme slow-motion camera, you would see just how much force is impacting the drum. And as that downward force happens, the rim depresses slightly and for a split second, the tension rods are released from the rim's pressure. When this happens, they can turn a micro turn, which causes the drum to start to lose its tuning.\n\nAnd this is where Rimshot-Locs can help. This small, tubular bar has a threaded interior and a hex wrench receiver on the other end. If you were to take your drum apart and dissect the lug, you'd find that the Rimshot Loc looks very similar to the part that protrudes the lug casing and accepts your threaded tension rod.\n\nHOW IT WORKS\n\nTo use Rimshot-Locs, loosen all the drum's tension rods and then lift the rim with the rods still intact; turn if ever so slightly so that the tension rods are hanging free. Take a Rimshot-Loc for each tension rod and screw it on from the bottom of the tension rod to about the middle of the rod. After installing a Rimshot-Loc on each tension rod, align and re-install the tension rods. After you've achieved the desired tuning, simply take the small, provided wrench and torque the Rimshot-Locs to counter-tighten against the underside of the counter-hoop. This back pressure keeps the tension rod from backing out of tune.\n\nThis concept is so simple and has been used by DIY drummers in the past. Some would use proper size nuts tightened down against the tension rod receiver, and other companies have made plastic tabs that attempted to keep the lug from turning. Some companies provide a “loctite”-style adhesive material to their factory tension rods to keep them from becoming out of tune, but none of these has been a great solution.\n\nDo note that the Rimshot-Locs come in specific sizes based on the drum's manufacturer, so make sure you order the correct ones for your brand.\n\nUsing Rimshot-Locs is an extra step and requires that you tend to them with regular maintenance (just like you do your drum heads). And you should know that they involve an added extra step for tuning, because Rimshot-Locs must be backed off before you can remove a head. But if you're looking for your drums to stay in tune once you’ve taken the time to dial them in, then these simple devices are affordable insurance to maintain that crucial tuning. Load and lock - then play hard, and stay in tune.\n\nResources —\n\nOfficial Rimshot-Locs Website\n\nVideo:\n\nPurchase RimShot Locs at Musician's Friend\n\n_________________________________________________________________"
