        "text": "Rim-Shot Guy is a character in Drawn Together who made his first appearance in The One Wherein There Is a Big Twist, Part II. He is a Hawaiian tribesman of the Wanatuba Tribe, who randomly appears in certain episodes of the show and plays a rim-shot on a drum kit whenever a character makes a pun or corny joke.\n\nAppearances[]\n\nThe One Wherein There Is a Big Twist, Part II[]\n\n(Toot is eating a bunch of fish)\n\nTribesman: Wow, I haven't seen that much eating, since Lilith Fair come to island.\n\n(Rim Shot)\n\nFoxxy: Sure enough, everybody else had lost their minds, but not the Foxxy. She knew Sweetcake was up to no good. Foxxy's got a sixth sense for this kind of thing and six cents for a handy in the back alley.\n\n(Rim Shot)\n\nCaptain Hero's Marriage Pact[]\n\nSpanky: Some of the greatest songs have been based off of tragic deaths. Think Candles in the Wind, think Tears in Heaven, think Grandma got Run Over by a Reindeer.\n\n(Rim-Shot)\n\nClum Babies[]\n\nClara: You have an answer for everything, don't you?\n\nFoxxy: Yep. Except for math.\n\n(Rim Shot)\n\nA Tale of Two Cows[]\n\nCaptain Hero: Red eyes, foaming mouth. Zoinks! Live Action Cow has rabbis!\n\nClara: It's pronounced \"Rabies\", although they're both incurable diseases.\n\n(Rim Shot)\n\nCaptain Girl[]\n\n(Toot angrily eats Wooldoor and then craps him out)\n\nWooldoor: That's one irritable bowel.\n\n(Rim-Shot)\n\nSpelling Applebee's[]\n\n(Foxxy admits that she doesn't know how to spell)\n\nWooldoor: Well, that explains her obsession with Malcolm Q.\n\n(Rim Shot)\n\nLost in Parking Space, Part One[]\n\nDelivery Guy: I haven't had a delivery this bad since my wife's miscarriage.\n\n(Rim Shot)\n\nDelivery Guy: I've seen Home Alone like, 17 times.\n\n(In Confessional): Watching that adorable little kid running around is the closest thing me and my wife will ever get to having a real son.\n\n(Rim Shot)\n\nTrivia[]\n\nHe was in the audience of the episodes The Drawn Together Clip Show and American Idol Parody Clip Show but he didn't actually play the rim shot for any jokes.\n\nHe was seen wearing a Mexican hat in Mexican't Buy Me Love.\n\nIn Toot Goes Bollywood, instead of the screen cutting away to him as usual, he was briefly seen, joining the scene when they made the joke."
