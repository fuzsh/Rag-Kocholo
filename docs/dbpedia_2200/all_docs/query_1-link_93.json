        "text": "@Scott E said:\n\nWhat is it that you are trying to do but can’t?\n\n@John said:\n\nI *think* Icelander_1 wants to freely mix drums between EZX:s, not only exchanging a snare or a tom from one EZX to another but build the kit pieces freely.\n\nIt’s not even that ambitious. I’ll try elaborate:\n\nI’m essentially using my EZ Drummer 2 as the optimum sound plugin for my Band-in-a-Box music creation software. That application comes with loads of fantastic midi drum patterns, which I had hoped I could fully utilise via EZD. In the cases I’m currently looking at, I have a bossa brushes pattern that includes brushes _and_ congas. The thing is, BBox only has _one_ track (channel, if you prefer) designated for drums, so your mutual ideas of separate sets is out for me.\n\nThus, I had hoped that by buying the Hip-Hop EZX (which has the most slots of any kit), combined with the Perc EZX (to get some quality congas), I would load up the Hip-Hop kit and just replace the slots with the drums from Percs & Jazz where appropriate. Another, simpler scenario was my idea of ‘enlarging’ the Jazz kit, which has fewer slots than f.ex. the Modern Kit, by loading the Modern Kit and just replace each with drums from the Jazz kit and for the remaining slots use something that could fit the mould (i.e. not even the ambitious “Tom in a Crash Cymbal slot”, but just by using equivalent slots), such as from the Vintage kit (or even just leave the rest as is), and both these scenarios have the same caveat.\n\nSee, while this is theoretically possible, the caveat is that now I’ve discovered that drums like the brushes will _lose_ most of their articulations and only use articulations that are available in the kit I started off from. I hope I’m explaining myself properly here.\n\nThe disappointment of this discovery is further accentuated by not really having a sure way to find this out until _after_ spending (read:wasting!) the money on something which I otherwise am never going to use."
