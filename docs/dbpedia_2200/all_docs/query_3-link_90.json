        "text": "So...i was just jamming on my drums and started playing a solo where i held the sticks waaay at the heel with a VERY loose grip, with the stick pretty much parallel to the head of the snare drum (strainers off) and played kind of an accented 8th note on the rim. Anyway, this caused a pretty sweet sound because the tips would bounce off the head at 16th's sounding thing + I could throw in a rim shot sound on accents.\n\nWell, I'm sure I didn't invent anything new here, but it sounded cool as hell so I thought I'd share .\n\nI think they call 'em gravity blasts now. If I understand you correctly that is. I have no idea how that correlates to the technique - just metalhead logic I guess. You can hold the sticks shorter as well and get all kinds of one handed miracles including a closed buzz roll - with and without rimshots. There's some good youtube on the basics.\n\nOK so i guess it was a little different because I was holding the sticks way down at the base...but after watching those videos I tried holding them more in the middle. Hah, I had that mastered in like 2 minutes. Super easy! Blazing fast single handed rolls with ease. The only downside is that you can hear the rim sound in with the roll.\n\nTheres a Swedish guitar player of all things that demonstrates how to get around that. You place your hand within an inch of the rim and kinda press into it. Once you get the timing, the clicks and shots virtually disappear.\n\nYou've discovered the technique is a nobrainer. The trick is to control it. Slow the stroke down to quarter notes and try for smooth 8ths. A good drill is to do them simultaneously with a straight time hihat. This is pretty simple both hands play straight time and the gravi- taps form ghost notes. It might sound awkward at first but just work on the timing. You can shape the tone as you get more comfortable."
