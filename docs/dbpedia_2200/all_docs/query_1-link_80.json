        "text": "Hi,\n\nI use AUM and I have EG Pulse.\n\nIn the old days (start laughing), I had a Boss DR-550 MK2 physical drum machine. That was back before anyone ever said 'drum like a Boss'. It certainly had it's limitations. It was a lot of work sequencing background drums. You couldn't change the volume or timbre of a single pad within a song or pattern.\n\nIn my recording studio (PC based), I use both Groove Agent and EZ Drummer. I love the percussion sounds and there are tons and tons and tons of out of the box beats to start with. A kit in EZ Drummer has around 40 unique sounds. For example: snare with springs, snare without the springs, rimshot snare. For example: crash, and muted crash. I feel the sounds are fairly realistic. Maybe not perfect, but very close. There's lots of different kits, and even non-kit drums like bongos, congas, shakers, etc.\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS for iPad Drum Machine/Sequencer (to Run in AUM). I have EG Pulse, but I really, really don't like it. Some of the issues I struggle with are:\n\na single drum kit has 16 sounds and that's it\n\nunless you play or feed EG Pulse with a MIDI file you can't change the velocity (volume) on a single pad within a song (a louder kick in one pattern or one place, and a quieter kick in a different place)\n\nthe grid view won't enlarge well - especially if you have it set to 1/64th note divisions, you can't enlarge the screen to zoom in where you want to add/remove notes\n\nyou have to feed EG Pulse a MIDI message to change what MIDI note triggers the pad - there's no user interface where you can just type in the MIDI note number; while playing a keyboard seems easy - there's still connections and set up work\n\nThere are certainly great features about the app, no doubt.\n\nAlternative Recommendations?\n\nsomething with 30 - 40 pads?\n\nsomething with up to 64th note divisions\n\nsomething that allows notes or divisions to be grouped into triplets\n\nsomething that lets you set the note velocity per note in the pattern (so in one place in a pattern, the kick can be loud, in another place in the SAME pattern the kick can be set softer)\n\nsomething that lets me manually type in the MIDI mapping for each pad\n\nsomething that lets me load my own wave files for a pad (EG Pulse does this)\n\nsomething that lets me copy and paste patterns via CMD+C and CMD+V\n\nsomething that lets me create a song as a collection of patterns, with up to 120 patterns; possibly even looping segments or a smaller set of patterns within a song\n\nsomething that lets me 'record' a pattern by playing the drum pads\n\nAnything out there in this ballpark, or is EG Pulse really about it?"
