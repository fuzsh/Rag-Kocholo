        "text": "About\n\nA Rimshot is a tune played by drummers to emphasize an obvious pun stated by the comic. Due to it's comedic melody, and well timed usage, the rimshot has become a big part of pop culture, and is still being used to this day by talk show host \"David Letterman\".\n\nOrigin\n\nThe Rimshot was invented by the jazz and big band drummer Gene Krupa, and has since then been used over the years by many comedians and musicians. After the invention of the rimshot many other comedians and musicians have been playing this note to either refine their skills, or just highlight a really lame joke. The usage of the rimshot has been dated back since the 1960's during Gene's life time.\n\nUsage in Pop Culture\n\nThe Rimshot has been used in a variety of media and stage acts. The Rimshot is so common that it is unlikely that many people wouldn't be able to recognize the tune if played. The Rimshot has been used in many cartoons and shows like ''Spongebob Squarepants\", ''The Office'', \"My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic'', and many more. The Rimshot also has a Japanese derivative \"Cham Chum\" as used by Kakyoin from the anime \"JoJo's Bizarre Adventure\".\n\nRelated Memes\n\nRimshot Troll\n\nThe Rimshot Troll is another variation which is commonly used in Rage Comics. His usage is for puns that are derived from rage comics, and making a troll play this tune. However it was unable to catch on, unfortunately.\n\nSearch Interest"
