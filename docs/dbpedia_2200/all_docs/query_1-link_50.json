This sequencer has the ability to generate sequences with semi - predictable variation using just a few parameters.\n\nAn initial trigger starts a cascade of possible patterns from the input of the matrix. The matrix basically tells the sequencer its possible destinations after the current step, except for position 0 which is instantly triggered when the sequence restarts. You can also set a delay time for each step to wait before triggering (0 being no delay, 1 being a 16th note, and 16 being 1 bar, etc.). There is also a control for the probability of the delay of a step being applied or ignored. Step size is the note duration and it works on the same time system as the delay.\n\nWe also have the optional function to mute (choke) all other voices with each trigger, which can create some interesting variation and unexpected results on its own.\n\nCymbal - babumamusic\n\nCowbell - Melody Loveless\n\nRimshot - Onokio\n\nClap - Mjulev"
