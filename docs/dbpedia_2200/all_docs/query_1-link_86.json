        "text": "White Oak is very familiar to drummers as a material for drumsticks. The primary characteristics of oak are its hardness and resilience. The unique combination of hardness and density provides superior projection. The sound has a perfect balance of both high and low end frequencies. The White Oaks snare drum gives a unique sound – powerful tone and projection.\n\nHigh Edge Hoop\n\nWith a height of 20.5mm these hoops offer direct sound projection and focused sound. These hoops will respond to different stick positions to produce a wide variety of rim shot sounds.\n\nShell\n\n1ply Oak 4.5mm with Reinforcement\n\nA nylon nut is built in the strainer switch CSA-20S.Canopus’ switch is so designed to prevent “loosening of snare wire” during the performance by creating moderate friction on the tension adjustment dial by the torque controlled nylon nut.\n\nWhat is 1ply Series?\n\nWhen we look back on the history of snare drums we see a transition of crafting techniques. From hollowed one piece shell, to 1 ply shell, to plywood shell with reinforcement, plywood shell without reinforcement, and then block shell construction. Though this transition was in the pursuit of efficiency, each method of construction has resulted in a different sound.\n\nThrough Canopus’ research into the various combinations of materials, number of plies, and reinforcement we have continued to introduce a variety of new drums.\n\nWith the Zelkova snare drum Canopus has presented the ultimate sound for a one piece, hollowed shell. The notable characteristics of a 1-ply shell are a deep sound and pure tone. It has been a new challenge for Canopus to take advantage of these qualities and create new instruments displaying the diverse sound character of different wood materials."
