Mainly because if you use rim shots all the time you really have nowhere to go volume-wise if you want to take it up a notch.\n\nTodd's a monster player, I personally don't like his sound or his musical choices but i can appreciate he's a wonderful musician.\n\nI'm sure how he's playing in that clip sounds great thru a ginormous PA and works great for that music. no doubt he would tune different and hit different playing in a small club or with a different band, I admire his devotion to excellence but he doesn't do anything for me musically in that clip,that's just my personal taste.\n\nmichaelg said:\n\nTodd's a monster player, I personally don't like his sound or his musical choices but i can appreciate he's a wonderful musician.\n\nI'm sure how he's playing in that clip sounds great thru a ginormous PA and works great for that music. no doubt he would tune different and hit different playing in a small club or with a different band, I admire his devotion to excellence but he doesn't do anything for me musically in that clip,that's just my personal taste.\n\nYou may not like his sound... whatever that means... but he is in the pocket all the time.\n\nHe is also an accomplished drummer..other than Styx... started played at 18 months......went to Berkley...comes from a very musical family\n\nsingleordoubleheads said:\n\nI'm more of a middle guy too as opposed to rim shots all the time even tho I tend to use trad 90% of the time. Mainly because if you use rim shots all the time you really have nowhere to go volume-wise if you want to take it up a notch.\n\nThis is quite common misconception, that rimshots are automatically loud. If you hit them with force, sure they are louder than center shots, but it's possibly to use them softly too. I started learning them years ago and wanted to have them as versatile tool that delivers a certain sound, not a certain volume. The angle of the stick has to be just right , if you hit rimshots light, because there is no stick flex at all to compensate a bad aim.\n\nDon't remember which, Clyde Stubblefield or Jabo Starks was/is the master of playing rimshots lightly. You can see it clearly on the instruction video they did about 20 years ago. Also James Gadson is great playing low volume rimshots, check Bill Withers live clips for this.\n\nAbout the original question, I would say that go for the sound you want to achieve. BUT I would also find it weird not to learn the rimshot properly and not have it in your tool kit, since it's very usable and versatile technique and great way to get meaty sound out of pretty much any snare. Also, I have noticed that knowing this technique has suppressed the need to go through lot of snares, buy and sell, since I feel that I can get lots of different tones out of any snare.\n\nWhy limit your sound palette? At least do not let laziness be the reason. Only viable reason in my opinion would be that you absolutely hate the sound of rim shots.\n\nMarkkuliini said:\n\nI'm more of a middle guy too as opposed to rim shots all the time even tho I tend to use trad 90% of the time.

Rimshots add a little character, and at a lower height they can sound great. Rimshots are my go-to, if that isnt working then I wont use the rim..."
