        "text": "The SD1250 uses Bluetooth MIDI, not Bluetooth Audio. Bluetooth Audio devices are configured in the Settings app on your iOS device. To set up Bluetooth MIDI, launch the app you want to use the SD1250 with. For example, to use the SD1250 with Garage Band: press the “Gear” icon on the top right corner, select “Advanced,” then select “Bluetooth MIDI devices.” Press the Bluetooth button on the SD1250 so that it flashes, then select the SD1250 in Garage Band.\n\nPlease make sure you are using the Simmons Advanced app downloadable here, not the “Simmons Drums” app. Please also check the app download page, or set up auto-update on your iOS device, to see if a new version is available, and make sure that you have updated to the latest version of the app.\n\nMost of the pads on the SD1250 are dual-zone. On the cymbals, if you play the bow it triggers a different sound than the edge. This is also true over MIDI – the bow and edge trigger two different MIDI note numbers.\n\nPress Utility, then F5 (MIDI Note), then play that pad. You can assign the bow and edge of a cymbal to the same note number, or you can assign them to different sounds in your software.\n\nJust make sure that the MIDI note number lines up with something playing in your drum software, otherwise you won’t hear anything."
