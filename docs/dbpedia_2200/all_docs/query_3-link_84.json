I’ve lowered the midi velocity range and the Output curve, which should have some impact, but I’m not hearing any change at all. Any thoughts on what I could be doing wrong here? Or another way of going about what I’m trying to achieve? Thanks in advance.\n\nThe Output Curve works for incoming MIDI. So, if you are using the internal engine to play stuff you will not hear a difference. You need to either play it live on a controller, or lay the groove on a track (in your DAW) and have it feed BFD. Only then will the difference be noticeable.\n\nIf you ask me, the internal engine should follow the output curve too.\n\nFor predictable results, do as @SoundMILL suggests."
