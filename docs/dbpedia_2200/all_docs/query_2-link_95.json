        "text": "This is definitely being developed in the open, but don't count on any of the code being fully functional until a Release announcement.\n\nRimshot\n\nRealtime Issue Management with Speckle\n\nDuring the Great Lockdown of the last two years, in what has so quickly become a remote-working, online-first-meetings, broadcast only way of doing business. One really striking aspect of the AECO world, away from the Teams, Google Docs, Zoom and the like, was that the manner of Model Analysis and review has not been in the same class of technological delivery.\n\nI've sat through many dozens of streamed Navisworks sessions and engagement amongst teams has definitely waned or defaulted to a broadcast rather than a collaboration. Attention spent managing the remote experience means the analyst is taxed to the point of only making scant notes about issues, and contributors may not all be heard to register their input.\n\nFor this professional/social need I introduce Rimshot - Realtime Issue Management with Speckle.\n\nUtilising two aspects that I admire of Speckle:\n\nInformation Hub and low-friction data transfer.\n\nBring people to the Model. Speckle is multiplayer.\n\nWatch the submission video\n\nThe XYZ project stream used in the demo\n\nAnalyst view within Navisworks\n\nInstall the addin as a application plugin bundle\n\nLaunch Navisworks and select plugin\n\nSelect a project and workshop (already created in the rimshot database)\n\nSelect an issue to commit to.\n\nElements selected in Navisworks will be committed as Speckle Mesh to the corresponding branch (created new if not existing)\n\nSelecting Snapshot adds an image to the existing issue of whatever is visible in the viewport. If no issue is selected, snapshotting ceates a new issue and corresponding branch.\n\nContributors view\n\nThe analyst can share a unique secure URL to the workshop record. (https://rimshot.app/issues/{UNIQUE ID})\n\nAll visitors to that web page can see images and Speckle commits being added.\n\n\"Follow-mode\" scrolls to the issue currently being presented by the Analyst. Selecting a different issue cancels Follow Mode\n\nAll contributors can comment and edit the descriptive and the metadata fields.\n\nThe commited model can be viewed in the Rimshot app or the corresponding Speckle Server branch.\n\nThe workshop record can be downloaded as in CSV file format.\n\nThe hackathon submission consists of:\n\nGeometry and Data Connector for Navisworks\n\n* Full conversion of selected elements from Navis to Specklemesh * Full fidelity of Geometry @ real world coordinates * Full Property stack with nested Geometric and Non-geometric elements reflecting the Navis selection tree\n\nAn installed webview addin for Navisworks.\n\n* Model elements selected in Navis will be committed and synced to the app. * Model elements are converted on the fly while the discussion continues. * The addin allows for immediate viewport screen capture.\n\nAn Issue Mangement workshop capture interface.\n\n* Structuring the database around a collaborative experience aids quality of Issue resolution.\n\nA realtime multi-party data capture app and database for desktop and mobile devices.\n\nUsing a real-time database allows for all authenticate users to comment and properly describe and issue and its path to resolution.* The responsive app design scales to full screen to handheld.\n\nContributions can be immediate and collaborative.\n\nBackend webhook and cloud function support to reinforce the Navis<>App interaction and capture events that may fail due to connecttivity issues or lag. Both events may happen without conflict and eventual consistency is assured.\n\nA pattern for managing Model based issues within the Speckle interface.\n\n* Each issue is a separate Speckle branch. * Multiple sub-issues can be made as separate commits to the branch. * New issue branches are created automatically\n\nRoadmap Post Hackathon\n\nProper linking with Auth flow and project/stream selection.\n\nSyncing of Comments between the two databases - near realtime.\n\nMore responsive syncing. Allow Speckle to push to the app (perhaps closing out issues, 3rd party commits)\n\nSorting out the ðŸ”¥HOT MESSðŸ”¥ of the Navisworks geometry translation.\n\nIntegate the Speckle Viewer rather than embed views.\n\nResponsive Event driven model analysis to push metadata into the issue record."
