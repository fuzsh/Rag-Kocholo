Under user presets there is save, save as, and delete selections (those are presets that save the entire state of the plugin), under the part presets there are no such options, unless I'm completely missing something. I did contact Toontrack when SD3 first came out and they said the only option was to import \"parts\" from other presets that I had made. I don't remember seeing those part presets in the list in the original release. Maybe they added it in an early update?, But non the less, I still can't see how to actually save a part/mixer preset there. It's not my biggest worry as I've figured out work arounds, less convenient, that's all. Same with midi mapping. I never use or like GM mapping and I remap the kits so I can group all of a kit piece articulations together across my keyboard. In SD2 you could save mapping presets. Not in SD3. Keep in mind I'm talking about remapping the actual articulations to different midi notes, not the midi in/e-drum section. Again, it was easy breezy in SD2 and visually very clear and easy. Not in SD3, and no presets. I have figured out work arounds for this as well, but it just feels like moving backwards not forwards. The good thing is these things generally only need to be set up once and then their done.\n\nI went back and gave another close listen to the dynamic range of the new drums and also listened to some of the examples and opinions on that Gearslutz thread, and I'm still of the same opinion that they really missed the mark by leaving out harder hitting upper velocity hits. And it's not a matter of rim shot vs a hard hit center or mid center hit. Even within the center or mid center hits, the hardest hits are not hit as hard as a hard hitting drummer would hit them. It's the same for the toms. Of coarse there are going to be different opinions about how a drum should be hit and what is the \"right\" way and what is the \"wrong\" way, but there is no doubt they changed their approach to this from all of their previous releases. Like I've said, I'm not a metal guy and much of the time I work on mellow, ambient, chill stuff. In those cases the new kits are fine, and the Ayotte toms are a dream, especially the rim shots! So sweet at low velocities. But when I want some bashing beats and bombastic drum fills, these new kits don't cut it. I have The Hit Factory and Allaire for that, but as I've said, those kits only have 1 rack tom. I guess I'll have to look into another SDX that will fill that void for me -)\n\nThanks for that, yes I see that part preset section now, but I don't see a way to actually save anything there.

I guess I'll have to look into another SDX that will fill that void for me -)\n\nMy favorite SDX,if you can find it used(it pops up for sale occasionally)is Joe Barresi Evil Drums by Platinum Samples.\n\nPlatinum stopped making it as a Superior SDX but it's AWESOME!!!\n\nIf you want an SDX that rocks and you see someone selling it,grab it & yes it's EVIL!\n\nBut a drummer wouldn't be hitting the drum twice, which is what this solution is. I'm sure it would sound ok, but it's just more work and I'm still wondering why they made this conscious decision when all of their other SDX and EZX's included a full range of hits on each note.\n\nIn the other SDXs and EZXs, the center hits switched to rimshots at the higher velocities, now those are two separate articulations, but the default is snare center hits, so you don't need double hits, you just need to make the higher velocity notes into rimshots. A rimshot is hitting both the center and the rim simultaneously, giving it a lot more crack from the attack of the stick on the rim and forcing more vibration into the shell itself. A center hit can never have as much crack and volume as a rimshot. A rimshot also gives the impression of a larger stick because the angle at which the stick strikes the center of the head results in more surface area contact between the stick and head (more side than tip).\n\nAnother difference, is there appears to be absolutely no baked in saturation on the SD3 library. When you're recording real drums, you're almost always getting a bit more saturation on the hard hits from the analog gear which adds a sense of intensity to them, but the SD3 library was recorded clinically clean. So adding some saturation or emulation of saturation with a character of your choice can help.\n\nThe default kick drum articulations are also open now which is a rounder sound. Harder hitting drummers tend to dig into the head more getting a punchier drier sound. You can get that sound by switching to the hit articulation.\n\nAll that said, the hits may not be as hard as in some other Toontrack libraries. Although that might be a misleading way of saying it. It seems to me that the issue is more that none of the samples were done with a heavier stick size. In my opinion, medium sized sticks are appropriate for most genres. As a drummer, one of the things that comes across as fake in programmed parts is all the over use of high velocity hits.\n\nI was initially disappointed with the SD3 sounds, until a I realized what was causing the issues, now I actually prefer them to previous SDXs. Custom & Vintage is my favorite for baked in character, but the sampling is not near as deep as on the SD3 factory library."
