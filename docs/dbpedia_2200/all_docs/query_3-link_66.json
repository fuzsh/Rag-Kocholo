        "text": "Some good and bad stuff in here. Whats definitely cool is being able to fine-tune the playing style. selecting where on the snare the right-hand normal hits and where the left-hand hits. The type of beater on the kick, or the types of sticks you use. It's way deeper than I assumed it would be and I think it has a lot of potentials. The rooms are not great IMO. I'm just turning them off and using my own. Right out the bat, it has so much more energy than Superior Drummer. This MODO series is no joke. If they do a guitar series, they will have all my money.\n\nRight out the bat, it has so much more energy than Superior Drummer.\n\nMaybe so. I didn't really like what I heard in the IK demos, but I haven't tried it out for myself so maybe I'm missing something. Here's a clip of me playing SD3 from my midi keyboard. No quantize, no major editing, just deleted some bad notes and moved the different grooves closer together. I think there is a ton of realism and energy from these drums. I have a FabFilter Pro C on the drum bus and a Pro L2 on my master\n\nAttachments\n\nSD3.mp3\n\nMaybe so. I didn't really like what I heard in the IK demos, but I haven't tried it out for myself so maybe I'm missing something. Here's a clip of me playing SD3 from my midi keyboard. No quantize, no major editing, just deleted some bad notes and moved the different grooves closer together. I think there is a ton of realism and energy from these drums.\n\nno doubt. superior drummer is strong. It more often than not gets the job done. MODO's benefit is that you can be a bit more precise with what's happening. Not for everybody, but its a nice alternative.\n\nAs I've mentioned in other threads, I sometimes find modeling based products useful for setting the bar, in cases where the timbre or other aspects just don't cut it (especially for ultra-realism). Then I use those settings to try to match a sample library as closely as possible. Much easier than having no reference at all when tweaking a sample library's parameters. Education is worth an investment.\n\nJust finished downloading and installing it. Far too tired to really play with it yet, but the jazz preset sounds cavernous, so when I am awake the first thing I will try is some editing parameters that will tame that.\n\nInterface is similar to MODO BASS, and huge. Wasn't expecting it to be ready today, but downloaded it now anyway because I don't like slowing down the start of my day with procedural stuff.\n\nThanks for the input here, glad some are already able to enjoy MODO DRUM. Note that we have added more audio demos to our site at https://www.ikmultimedia.com/products/mododrum/index.php?p=audio\n\nThere are also some more basic and most times \"natural\" sounding simple demos by this user on Twitter: https://twitter.com/Minatnoy\n\nThis video is also a good watch, covers some of the more advanced/customization aspects of MODO DRUM too:\n\nSince IK Multimedia tech support was unable to answer my question directly, I'll try asking it here. Can this library produce a rim shot? (That where the tip of the stick comes down and strikes the head while the side of the stick simultaneously catches the rim, producing a nice sharp \"crack!\")\n\nAbsolutely MODO DRUM has rimshot. Please let me know your ticket number so I can make sure a \"teaching moment\" ensues. Thanks!\n\nWe know the cymbals are sampled (though they do swells well). What about the tambourine, cowbell and claps? Does this contain the very model of a modern MIDI cowbell?\n\nAs far as I can tell there is precisely one sampled cowbell across all the kits. You, therefore, cannot have more cowbell. It's the same for tambourine and claps by the looks of it.\n\nWhat does \"Requires AVX\" mean? I only know it has something to do with video cards. Are there only specific video cards that are supported? Which ones? How do we know? What doesn't work if we don't have AVX? Will it not load?\n\nSorry for so many questions, but I'm in the middle of a house move, and fairly disorganized in terms of access to information etc. I downloaded and tried it as soon as it became available, and didn't notice any problems, but also didn't have a chance to use it heavily yet, and won't for another month.\n\nI do not recall any serious limitations being posted, and probably assumed that it would run on anything that can run MODO BASS.\n\nMy only concern so far is that it doesn't appear that you can re-map the drums, and that it only supports General MIDI, which is pretty limiting when it comes to snares and hi-hats in particular. Unless one is just doing TR808/TR909 type stuff.\n\nThanks for a great review and walkthrough!\n\nNot my review, but I figured sharing it might help some people.\n\nIt is unfortaunte that its limited to general midi for the time being, but here's the drum map. Its actually pretty good with some interesting CC options as well. I have to say its quickly becoming my favorite drum library."
