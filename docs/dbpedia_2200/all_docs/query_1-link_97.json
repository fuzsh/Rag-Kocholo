        "text": "In the Baroque and Classical periods the percussion section of the orchestra was limited to the timpani. During the Romantic period the percussion section grew. Cymbals, triangles and bass drums became important parts of the untuned percussion section. The xylophone, glockenspiel and related instruments formed the tuned percussion section. In the Romantic period and beyond, the percussion became a much larger part of orchestral music.\n\nOne of the best-known African drums is the West African djembe (pronounced zhem-bay). It is shaped like a large goblet and played with bare hands. The body of the djembe is carved from a hollowed trunk and is covered in goatskin.\n\nThey are double-headed and belong to the family of hourglass-shaped pressure drums. They are played with a beater. The drums can be used to imitate speech patterns or as signals to make announcements or warnings. The pitch of the note is changed by squeezing or releasing the drum's strings with the arm.\n\nTabla are important in Indian classical music. Tabla are a pair of small drums placed side by side on the floor in front of the player. They are used mainly to keep the time, but tabla players sometimes interact with the soloist and may have short solos themselves. The tabla heads are made out of goatskin with a central area which has a coating made from iron filings and rice flour.\n\nTabla playing is very difficult and it can take years to master the different strokes, or bols. Some strokes are open (allowed to ring) and others are closed (dampened).\n\nThe percussion in popular music is mostly provided by the drum kit. The main roles of the drum players are to maintain a steady beat and to add rhythmic interest to pop song.\n\nThis term refers to the four crotchets in 4/4 time played on the bass drum. Four-to-the-floor is often used in disco music and electronic dance music."
