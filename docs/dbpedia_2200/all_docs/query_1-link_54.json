        "text": "USER MANUAL\n\nModor DR-2 user's manual, version 4 for firmware OS010 (English, 80pages, 2.6MB)\n\nModor DR-2 Key Combos and Parameter card for OS012 (47kB)\n\nDRUM MODELS\n\nThe DR-2 has 6 drum 'channels', drumsets made of 6 drum instruments. These channels don't have predefined instruments. You can choose freely which instruments you want in your 6-channel drumsets. The DR-2 works with drum models, of which you can pick one for every channel. You can consider these 'models', or synthesis algorithms, as a collection of small but dedicated drum synthesizers, of which you can pick 6 to form a drumset. There are models for bass drums, snares and cymbals, but also for some more unusual drum sounds, clicks and ticks. Read more about it here.\n\nMore models will be added with future firmware upgrades. Feel free to send us your ideas and requests!\n\nEvery model has up to 12 sound synthesis parameters: Pitch with pitch decay, curve and amount, amp volume with panning, amp decay and curve, and parameters X, Y, Z and T that have a different function in every model, see the table below.\n\nX Y Z T DRIVE BD Bandpass Filter Freq Bandpass Filter Resonance Drive Gain Dry/Wet Mix NOISE BD Noise Filter Freq Noise Mix Wave Clipping Drive Noise Env Decay SQUARE BD Lowpass Filter Freq Notch Filter Freq Lowpass Env Amount Lowpass Env Decay STRING BD Wave Asymmetry String Mix Wave Clipping Drive String Randomize RUMBLE BD Gate Delay Filter Cutoff Drive Gain Dry/Wet Mix BASIC SN Snare Noise Volume Harm FM Intensity Harmonics Spectrum Harm/Noise Env Dec MARCHING SN Middle Noise Volume High Noise Volume Middle Noise Freq Noise Env Decay ANALOG SN Snare Noise Volume Snare Noise Env Decay 2nd Osc Pitch 2nd Osc Decay ELECTRO SN Osc/Noise Balance Snare Noise Env Decay Osc 1/2 Balance Init Pulse Width HIHAT White Noise Volume - Cymbal Spectrum - RIDE CYMBAL Main Filter Freq Main Filter Bandwidth Cymbal Spectrum Hipass Filter Decay CRASH CYMBAL White/Cymbal Noise - Cymbal Spectrum Initial Env Decay FILTER HIHATS Filter Slope Filter Bandwidth Cymbal Spectrum Cymbal/Pink Noise CLAPS Drive Gain PitchFilter Resonance Retrigger Number Retrigger Time FILTER CLAPS Hipass Filter Slope Lopass Filter Slope Retrigger Number Retrigger Time ANALOG TOM Noise Volume Noise Filter Freq Wave Clipping Drive 3rd Osc/Noise Decay TENORDRUM Noise Volume Notch Filter Freq Tenordrum Spectrum Harmonics Decay RIMSHOT Drive Gain Hipass Filter Cutoff 2nd/3rd Osc Pitch 2nd/3rd Osc Decay RATTLE 1st Filter Cutoff 2nd Filter Cutoff Rattle Env Curve Rattle Retrig Number COWBELL Filter Cutoff Filter Env amount Cowbell Spectrum Noise Click Decay GLASS BOTTLE - 2nd Osc Group Decay Bottle Spectrum Noise Click Decay\n\nDISTORTION, COMPRESSION, EQUALISING AND MIXING\n\nAfter sound synthesis by the models, each of the 6 channels A-F has its own distortion, parametric equaliser, tilt filter and compressor to further finalise each sound and put it on a well defined position in the mix.\n\nThe distortion (gain parameter controlled with SHIFT+X) is a rather soft 'diode type' of saturation to add some extra overtones\n\nThe parametric equaliser enhances or suppresses a certain frequency range, with a central frequency (SHIFT+PITCH DECAY), a gain (SHIFT+PITCH CURVE) and Q setting (SHIFT+PITCH AMOUNT)\n\nThe tilt filter sets a filter slope (between +6dB/oct and -6dB/oct, SHIFT+Y) over the entire audio range\n\nThe compressor is a hard knee 8:1 compressor with sidechaining, of which you can control the treshold (SHIFT+Z) and attack time (SHIFT+T)\n\nCONNECTIONS\n\nThe DR-2 has an output jack connector for each of the 6 channels A-F, and 2 master L/R outputs. If there's no cable connected to a channel output, the corresponding channel is sent to the master L/R outputs. The individual channel outputs are mono, but have a panning parameter to give it a stereo position in the master mix.\n\nBut there is more! The A-F output connectors are actually insert points, you can use 6.35mm (1/4\") TRS jack connectors to route a channel out of the DR-2, and send it back in if you want. This way, you can use external effects, equalisers, compressors, ... on each of the 6 channels individually, and still have them panned and mixed in the master outputs of the DR-2.\n\nNext to the audio connectors, the DR-2 has 6.35mm (1/4\") TS connectors for 24/48PPQN clock input and output, and has classic din-5 MIDI IN, OUT and THRU connectors.\n\n128-STEP SEQUENCER\n\nThe sequencer of the DR-2 has a lot more options than just the classic 16-step sequencer. First of all: you can use 32nd notes, so the DR-2 doubles the resolution of a classic 16-step sequencer. The DR-2 has 16 step buttons but you can see 32 step leds on the front panel. Keep the '16/32'-button pressed to access the steps-between-the-steps.\n\nA pattern can use up to 4 of these 16/32-step pattern parts, these can be accessed with the 1-16/17-32/33-48/49-64 buttons. Using SHIFT + one of these buttons sets the pattern length. So, it's actually a 4x32 or 128-step sequencer.\n\nBut there's more: each instrument has it's own Accent, Flam, Tuplet, Break and Reverse patterns. Keep the ACC, FLAM, SHIFT+FLAM, BREAK or REV button pressed while using the step buttons.\n\nAccents can be added to individual tracks, and there's also a global accent track for all instruments simultaneously. Give the ACC button a single hit to access the global accent track, or keep the ACC button pressed to set accents on the current instrument's track alone.\n\nFlam creates double hits of a drum. You can set the Flam speed by turning the SWING/VALUE knob while keeping FLAM pressed.\n\na Tuplet creates multiple hits of a drum. You can set the Tuplet speed by turning the T-knob while keeping SHIFT+FLAM pressed, the number of Tuplet hits with SHIFT+FLAM+Z-knob and the velocity ramp (consecutive hits getting louder or weaker) with SHIFT+FLAM+Y-knob.\n\nBreak immediately silences a sounding drum.\n\nReverse makes the envelope generators run backwards. So, when the sequencer hits a 'Rev'-note, that sound makes a U-turn.\n\nUsing the accents, flams, reverses, etc... you can quickly program both quite natural feeling grooves and subtle to brutal sounding weird electronic drum riffs. You'll get in any case into programming drums that are unknown from existing drum machines.\n\nAnother peculiarity of the DR-2 are its 'polyclocks', or polyrhythmic stretched clocks. You can set a M:N stretch ratio for 2 polyclocks, that can be assigned to any instrument. These polyclocks then make M sequencer steps stretched over the time the main clock needs to make N steps.\n\nFinally, there is a Swing and a separate Swing32 parameter to alter the timing of the 16th and 32nd notes.\n\nFRONT PANEL KNOBS\n\nEach of the 6 channels has it's separate volume slider. Then, there are 11 parameter controls that work on the selected active drum (use A-F buttons): pitch, pitch env decay, pitch env curve, pitch env amount, amp env decay, amp env curve, pan, X, Y, Z and T. Finally there are 6 knobs on top of the sliders, controlling one selected parameter for every instrument, so you can have one parameter per instrument that can be controlled independently of the selected active drum."
