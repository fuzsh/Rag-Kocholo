        "text": "Born of the most famous and influential drum machines ever made, the TR-8S combines the best of its Roland heritage with modern production techniques and comprehensive sound design. The result? The most complete drum machine to date—a forward-thinking, performance-tuned instrument unlike any other. Build your dream kit from the most iconic drum sounds of all time, otherworldly FM sounds, and the finest selection of samples from our vast library—or go even further by importing your own custom samples. Tap, tune, and tweak with hands-on controls and production tools that make your patterns move and groove. And why keep this kind of percussive power confined to the studio?\n\nThe TR-8S was literally made to play live.\n\nDesign Kits with Authentic TR and CR Drums, FM Sounds, and Samples\n\nThe TR-8S comes loaded with the largest, most authentic collection of iconic Roland drum machines available. The powerful processor gives our next-generation ACB models a whole new level of detail and nuance with that classic boom, snap, and sizzle. Enrich the core drums with a spectrum of futuristic and editable FM sounds, plus preset and custom samples for unique hybrid and layered kits. Then enhance them all with specialized effects to inject professional sound design into the TR formula.\n\nTransistor Rhythms\n\nThe TR-8S includes faithful recreations of the TR-808, TR-606, TR-909, TR-707, and TR-727, along with several modified versions. You also get the CR-78 CompuRhythm, a direct predecessor of the TR-808 that’s left its own indelible footprint on pop classics from the 1980s and beyond. These are not sound-alike sample packs or mere recordings—each is a complete machine built with detailed, down-to-the-circuit models that sound and behave exactly like the original hardware. All these sounds are yours, at your fingertips, and ready to use in your own productions and performances.\n\nStellar FM Sounds\n\nThe FM sounds in the TR-8S are unlike anything this side of Mars, conjuring silvery drum hits and twisting tails to augment your tracks. Tap into the Morph parameter for a single, ultra-expressive macro control to sweep through an array of sonic variations, wildly manipulating FM depth, ratio, and feedback with simple knob movements. Or manually design six fully editable FM drum models, each with a unique parameter set for creating sounds sure to push sonic boundaries.\n\nACB Meets Samples\n\nToday’s rhythm tracks need a diverse set of sounds and production techniques, and it’s harder than ever to sound unique. While authentic TR and CR sounds are vital, layering your own mono or stereo samples, or pulling from the extensive onboard collection, opens a world of modern styles and the potential to craft your own signature sound. Like the ACB and FM sounds, you can deeply manipulate samples with hands-on control of tuning, decay, start points, speed, and direction. Create a kit entirely from samples. Or mix and match FM textures with classic Roland sounds for genre-defying drum tracks that demand attention.\n\nDrumatic Effects\n\nThe right effects make a drum part stand out by creating depth and space. Whether it’s delay on a rimshot, overdrive on a kick, filters on toms and cymbals, or just the right amount of reverb on select instruments, the TR-8S has an array of percussion-tuned effects that sound great. In addition to the Master FX knob, each channel has a customizable CTRL knob, placing all this sound-shaping power within easy reach. The attack of the kick, snap of the snare, phaser depth, distortion amount—whatever parameter you need direct access to—can be assigned to the knobs and saved with the kit. Both Instrument and Master Effects, along with their precise settings, are also saved with each kit, so your productions are always performance ready.\n\nCreate Evolving Patterns with Probability, Variations, Fills, and Motion\n\nPattern creation on the TR-8S feels natural and intuitive, thanks to the Roland ”TR-REC” step sequencer that’s been the beating heart of electronic music production for decades. And now, it’s been enhanced and modernized to be better than ever.\n\nFast, Fluid, and Fun\n\nYou can program on the 16 TR-REC buttons or use the velocity-sensitive performance pad to play live or record into the sequencer. And you can move seamlessly between either—playing, editing, and reshaping your drum parts without ever interrupting your flow. Create intricate grooves and detailed fills using velocity, accents, flams, and adjustable sub steps for modern rolls and ratcheting. Get experimental with unusual polyrhythms and complex meters by adjusting the length or \"last step\" of each drum part.\n\nKeep ’Em Guessing\n\nBring drum programming to life with a generous serving of probability. Set percentage values per step to instill your beat with evolving unpredictability—simply hold a step and set the amount. Then adjust master probability to offset the overall effect or uncover hidden notes waiting to be revealed. For further flux, try the random kit or instrument functions to flip your sounds on the fly.\n\nVariations on a Theme\n\nKeep things fresh and exciting, even during extended live sets. The TR-8S can store 128 patterns, each with eight variations and three kinds of fills. Patterns or variations can be triggered individually or chained together for evolving sequences. Copy patterns on the fly during performances, and even stay ahead of the beat and work on patterns that aren’t currently playing. Each pattern can include the tempo and the kit, along with its knob positions and effect settings. This gives you instant recall and enough flexibility to play an entire set without ever repeating a measure in the same way.\n\nFilling In\n\nWell-placed fills create thrilling moments in a track or a live set. Each pattern in the TR-8S can contain two fills that you can customize or create from scratch. There’s also an adjustable \"Scatter\" fill to slice and dice a measure into short bursts of cool and controlled chaos. But at times, your hands may be too busy to trigger every fill manually. AUTO FILL IN automates fills every 2, 4, 8, 16, or 32 measures, keeping your hands free and adding interesting dynamics to your performances.\n\nIn Motion\n\nProfessional-sounding tracks require detailed production techniques. The TR-8S not only makes crafting this detail possible—it makes it fast and fun. Locking parameters to steps or recording motion into patterns gives you everything from subtle movement to dramatic tonal shifts. Automate classic 808 basslines or go wild on snare pitch, panning, effects…whatever you want. Motion recording is immediate and effortless, and motion playback can be instantly enabled or disabled.\n\nAt Home in the Studio, Made for the Stage\n\nAfter the release of the TR-8, we listened to feedback from enthusiastic fans and artists from around the world—and it left us with a clear vision to make it even better, both for studio production and live performance. We’ve put these user-requested features—and more—into the TR-8S while keeping the immediacy and fun factor of the original TR-8 fully intact.\n\nEight Analog Outputs\n\nLike some of its famous siblings, the TR-8S has eight separate analog outputs, so you can process individual drum sounds through external effects or send them into separate channels of your mixer or DAW. Take control of your sound and decide which instruments or groups are sent to which outputs. And whatever you choose, know that the TR-8S sounds big, punchy, and spacious thanks to its high-resolution 24-bit/96 kHz digital-to-analog converters.\n\nTrigger Out, External In\n\nThe TR-8S has a dedicated trigger output as well as stereo audio inputs for external sources. And its assignable outputs can even be used as additional triggers. This lets you control external instruments and mix them with internal TR-8S sounds, greatly expanding your creative possibilities in the studio and performance possibilities on stage. Each pattern has a dedicated trigger track for access to all kinds of variations with no need to use up an instrument. Rimshots and triggered analog bass patterns? Yes, you can.\n\nAudio and MIDI Interface\n\nAside from being the most powerful drum machine ever made, the TR-8S is a complete multi-channel audio and MIDI interface. When you connect the TR-8S to a computer or AIRA Link host, you can transfer MIDI and high-resolution audio over a single USB cable. Record each drum instrument to a different channel for individual processing and recording, automate parameter movements from your DAW by CC messages, or sync the TR-8S to your computer or Roland MX-1 Mix Performer for live sets or late-night jam sessions.\n\nHardware Meets Software\n\nEnhance your workflow with TR-EDITOR, a fluid computer-based editor and librarian for the TR-8S. Nimbly design and edit patterns and kits with the intuitive graphic interface, which features a wide array of onscreen parameters and access to deeper FM editing. And with the large display, it’s easy to manage your entire library. Download TR-EDITOR for free today through Roland Cloud Manager, the software interface for Roland Cloud content.\n\nTR-EDITOR\n\nRefined Design with a Modern Touch\n\nAesthetic and ergonomic improvements can be found throughout the TR-8S, giving it a timeless design that fits any creative space. The shape, colors, and overall feel have been refined to be more substantial, elegant, and inviting. RGB color faders and TR-REC buttons let you customize the brightness, glow, and color of each element. Not only does it look amazing, but it gives crucial visual feedback about what’s playing, what’s muted, which instruments are grouped, and so on. And then there’s that lava lamp mode…\n\nTotal Recall\n\nThe life of a musician can be pretty unpredictable, whether it’s touring mishaps or studio calamities. Take comfort in the fact that every kit, every pattern, and every setting for literally everything can be backed up on an SD card. Just pop it into a fresh TR-8S and you’re back up and running.\n\nSpecifications\n\nUser Drum Kit\n\n128\n\nUser Patterns\n\n128\n\nStep Sequencer\n\n11 instrument parts and 1 exclusive part for trigger out\n\n16 steps per 1 variation\n\n8 (A – H) variations per 1 pattern\n\n2 Fill-in patterns per 1 pattern\n\nINST tone\n\n(Tone can be assigned to each 11 instrument parts freely.)\n\nBASS DRUM: 11 ACB tones\n\nSNARE DRUM: 8 ACB tones\n\nTOM: 15 ACB tones\n\nRIM SHOT: 3 ACB tones\n\nHAND CLAP: 5 ACB tones\n\nHI HAT: 8 ACB tones\n\nCYMBAL: 8 ACB tones\n\nPERCUSSION: 23 ACB tones\n\nFM: 72 tones\n\nPRESET SAMPLE: 300 tones or greater\n\nUSER SAMPLE (imported form SD CARD for playback): Available format: WAV, AIFF\n\nTotal time for all samples: Approximately 600 sec (at 44.1 kHz, mono)\n\n* The maximum length of a single audio file that can be imported is approximately 180 seconds (at 44.1 kHz).\n\nEffects\n\nINST FX: THRU, HPF, LPF, LPF/HPF, H BOOST, L BOOST, L/H BOOST, ISOLATOR, TRANSIENT, COMPRESSOR, DRIVE, COMP+DRV, CRUSHER\n\nREVERB: AMBI, ROOM, HALL1, HALL2, PLATE, MOD, HA-DOU\n\nDELAY: DLY, PAN, TAPE ECHO, PITCH SHIFT\n\nMASTER FX: HPF, LPF, LPF/HPF, H BOOST, L BOOST, L/H BOOST, ISOLATOR, TRANSIENT, TRANSIENT2, COMPRESSOR, DRIVE, OVERDRIVE, DISTORTION, FUZZ, CRUSHER, PHASER, FLANGER, SBF, NOISE, FATTENER, VINYL SIM\n\nOther: SIDE CHAIN (for EXT IN), SCATTER (as one of AUTO FILL IN function)\n\nDisplay\n\n16 characters, 2 line (backlit LCD)\n\n7 segments, 4 characters (LED)\n\nExternal Storage\n\nSD Card (SDHC supported) for backup/restore function and import sample data\n\nConnectors\n\nPHONES jack: Stereo 1/4-inch phone type\n\nMIX OUT (L/MONO, R) jacks: 1/4-inch TRS phone type\n\nASSIGNABLE OUT/TRIGGER OUT (1 – 6) jacks: 1/4-inch phone type\n\nEXT IN (L/MONO, R) jacks: 1/4-inch phone type\n\nTRIGGER OUT jack: Miniature phone type\n\nMIDI (IN, OUT) connectors\n\nUSB port: USB type B (Audio, MIDI)\n\nDC IN jack\n\nPower Supply\n\nAC adaptor\n\nCurrent Draw\n\n2,000 mA\n\nAccessories\n\nAC adaptor\n\nOwner's manual\n\nLeaflet “USING THE UNIT SAFELY”\n\nSize and Weight\n\nWidth\n\n409 mm\n\n16-1/8 inches\n\nDepth\n\n263 mm\n\n10-3/8 inches\n\nHeight\n\n58 mm\n\n2-5/16 inches\n\nWeight\n\n2.1 kg\n\n4 lbs. 11 oz.\n\n<% for (var i=0,len=images.length; i <% } %>\n\nVideo Library\n\nTR-8S v3.0/TR-6S v2.0 Firmware Update Overview\n\nThe TR-8S and TR-6S Rhythm Performers continue their sonic evolution with TR-8S v3.0 and TR-6S v2.0 updates.\n\nTR-8S Rhythm Perfomer v2.0 Update\n\nThe Roland TR-8S v2.0 Update adds a powerful FM sound engine that brings a whole universe of sonic textures to the modern drum machine classic.\n\nRoland TR-8S: Overview\n\nThis overview video introduces the new sound design and performance features in the TR-8S.\n\nRoland TR-8S: Sound Design\n\nThis video is Part 2 in an overview video series that takes a close look at the new Roland AIRA TR-8S Rhythm Performer.\n\nRoland TR-8S: Sequencing\n\nThis is the last video in a three-part overview video series that takes explores the new Roland AIRA TR-8S Rhythm Performer.\n\nBEC: TR-8S Berlin Sessions\n\nBEC (Second State label) is a rising star in the Techno scene.
