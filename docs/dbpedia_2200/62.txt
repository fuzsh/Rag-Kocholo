I know I don't usually post here, but I'm a drummer! It seems that most people think that a rimshot is that thing that you usually hear after a lame joke. Why do they call continue to call that a rimshot when a rimshot is just a way of striking the snare drum?

I just went on urbandictionary and they had this as the #1 most approved definition for rimshot:

Rimshot

that badum-CHING thing they do on a drum after a joke.

a man walked into a bar. OUCH!

*rimshot*

That comedy sting schtick on drums has always been called a rimshot. Deal with it.

Yeah, that goes back to the days of burlesque, the birthplace of stand-up comedy. Often the jokes alone were only so funny, but the well-timed "rimshot" added sort of a wiseass element that induced audience response. It caught on very quickly, and it was the drummers that, when asked what it was, dumbed it down to "rimshot." If they'd called it what it was in a notational sense, it would have a name consisting of what? 9 words?

So it's a theatrical buzzword?

That's exactly what it is.

Actually, the likely scenario is that the earliest "comedic rimshots" were actually what we'd call a rimshot. Subsequent variations which may or may not contain an actual rimshot, retained the simple slang.
