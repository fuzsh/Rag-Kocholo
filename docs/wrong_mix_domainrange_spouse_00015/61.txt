Jemima Khan drew on her own experience of cross cultural marriage, to former Pakistani prime minister and cricketer Imran Khan, when writing her new film What's Love Got to Do With it.

Directed by Shekhar Kapur, the rom-com follows a filmmaker as she documents her childhood friend and neighbour's arranged marriage to a bride from Pakistan.

Jemima Khan is a major documentary producer, a former journalist and associate editor of The New Statesman. Last year she produced the Emmy nominated series Impeachment: American Crime Story, about the President Clinton-Monica Lewinsky scandal.

What's Love Got to Do With it is being released in New Zealand cinemas from February 16.
