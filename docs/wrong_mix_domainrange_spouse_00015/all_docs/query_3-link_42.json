        "text": "The things that I heard that were on Twitter are not accurate. [MUSIC] [MUSIC] [MUSIC] [music] I have no idea what I did to Ally, I directed her in a play off broadway I had nothing but a great time with her, total respect for her. I have no idea why she was upset. [MUSIC] There are incredible voices, and I support it. I support change. [MUSIC] We listened, there were incredible people talking that night. They had a lot to say and. I am here to listen and to learn. Change my perspective where it is off. And I am completely willing and want to. [BLANK_AUDIO]\n\nJames Franco’s reputation has been marred by recent sexual misconduct allegations, but one person who has stuck with the actor is his girlfriend, Isabel Pakzad. After the 2018 Golden Globes, where Franco took home an award for The Disaster Artist, multiple women came forward to accuse him of sexual misconduct.\n\nFranco denied the allegations, “the things that I heard that were on Twitter are not accurate,” but adding that he plans to take responsibility for his actions. “The way I live my life, I can’t live if there’s restitution to be made. I will make it. So if I’ve done something wrong, I will fix it,” Franco said.\n\nThe conversation around Franco has since died down. He was not nominated for an Oscar for Best Actor, despite winning a Golden Globe in that category. He will continue to star in Season 2 of The Deuce, despite the allegations. And HBO isn’t the only one who’s sticking with Franco: His girlfriend, Isabel Pakzad, has remained with her man throughout the scandal. The two have been reportedly dating since early November, and have been spotted together as recently as Feb. 10.\n\nWhile neither of them have publically spoken about their romance, save for Franco mentioning his girlfriend “Isabel” on Howard Stern in December, they’ve been spotted out in public on multiple occasions, including after the sexual misconduct allegations surfaced. Pakzad was Franco’s date to the 2018 SAG Awards, where they were spotted smiling at each other inside the ceremony (above). The actor didn’t walk the red carpet at the event, and Pakzad cropped the person next to her out of the photo she posted to Instagram of her Dior dress.\n\nThe 24-year-old Penn State grad is currently a graduate student at the University of Southern California, where she’s getting a Masters in Integrated Design, Business, and Technology.\n\nJudging by her Instagram account, she’s also a seasoned world traveler, though we have no way of knowing whether she’s been taking these trips with Franco since he’s never appeared on her social media."
