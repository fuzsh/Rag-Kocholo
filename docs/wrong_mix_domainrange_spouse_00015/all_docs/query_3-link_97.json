        "text": "James Franco figures that since there are already so many rumors about him in the media lately, he may as well add another.\n\nOn the same day that the Child of God actor lashed out about Gawker’s “homophobic scoop,” an article written about himself and co-star Scott Haze living together, he decided to fuel another romance rumor, this time with songstress Lana Del Rey.\n\nJames Franco calls article out for “homophobic scoop” >>\n\nTaking to Instagram (Franco’s constant source of amusement) on Wednesday, the actor posted a black-and-white snapshot of himself and Del Rey, which he captioned, “Oh snap, we got married.”\n\nBut before you all frantically start Googling for pictures of the lovebirds on their big day, Franco clarified his comment by writing, “JUST KIDDING!!!”\n\nhttps://instagram.com/p/rXBzkzS9Yj\n\nFranco has been romantically linked to the “Summertime Sadness” songstress since her split from longtime beau Barrie-James O’Neill in June. During the past month, Franco has been sharing pictures of himself and Del Rey together, and he’s also been showing his support for her career, having recently taken to Instagram to share her Rolling Stone cover.\n\nThe Interview: Seth Rogen and James Franco finally say “I love you” >>\n\nBut the actor’s latest comment about being married to the star is his way of taking a stab at the media for the constant speculation about his personal life and relationships.\n\nYet it’s not the speculation about his relationship with the tattooed songstress that has the Pineapple Express actor all fired up. It’s the comments that Gawker made when it highlighted a New York Times article about him living with a man.\n\nLana Del Rey: I’ve “slept with a lot of famous guys” >>\n\n“But theirs is the kind of relationship — somewhat ambiguous, seemingly gay, probably romantic — that almost always sends The New York Times into a bizarre moral panic,” the article read."
