        "text": "James Franco dropped a small nugget in an interview with Stephen Colbert on The Late Show while talking about his persistent bachelorhood. “My brothers are both in very serious relationships,” Franco reminded the audience. “Davie, the youngest, is engaged, and is going to get married early next year, and Tom’s in a serious relationship.” Next year, as Patty in the break room keeps reminding you by saying \"see you next year!\" every time she leaves the office, is very soon indeed.\n\nBrie and Dave Franco are one of those Hollywood couples who you forget are engaged even though they star in a video-game commercial together and he has a really delightful “moment I knew I was going to marry that girl” story involving two 17-pound cats queued up for talk shows. They just seem normal! They record silly cat videos in bed!\n\nStill, when the wedding is going down was a hot topic on the youngest Franco’s promotional circuit for Neighbors 2: Sorority Rising and Nerve this summer. He dodged the wedding date question at a premiere in May and again on Andy Cohen in July, instead offering his feelings about planning. “When we got more into the details of planning the wedding, we realized that we’re both pretty horrible at it, and we don’t like to do it,” he explained. “We kept on simplifying it . . . so we might just elope and throw a party at the house.”\n\nAt least there’s this to look forward to in 2017: A January, February, March, or April elopement.\n\nVanity Fair has reached out to Franco and Brie for additional comment."
