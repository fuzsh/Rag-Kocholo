        "text": "On July 15, 1996, in a shabby little room at Court Number One, Somerset House, it took all of three minutes to dissolve the marriage of the century. H.R.H. the Prince of Wales and H.R.H. the Princess of Wales, neither of whom was present, were listed as Couple No. 31. Somerset House is less than a mile from St. Paul’s Cathedral, where, on another July day, a dashing prince had waited at the altar for the shyly smiling 20-year-old bride in the billowing ivory taffeta wedding dress.\n\nThe divorce deal had been sealed mainly on the terms Diana had asked for. Those terms included: the lump sum of £17 million ($26 million), £400,000 ($625,000) annually for Diana’s office, and Diana to be known as Diana, Princess of Wales, without the designation H.R.H. Diana had made one last attempt to salvage the H.R.H. before the decree, appealing to Sir Robert Fellowes, her brother-in-law, who was Queen Elizabeth’s private secretary. On behalf of the sovereign, he declined the request. For Diana, her son William’s response was the one that mattered. “Don’t worry, Mummy,” he told her when he learned that she was upset that she no longer had the title. “I will give it back to you one day, when I am king.”\n\nDiana got to keep her residence and have her office at Kensington Palace. She was not prohibited from a public role—that would be “for her to decide”—though her foreign trips, unless they were private holidays, would have to be signed off on by the Foreign Office and the Queen.\n\nLife After Charles\n\nDiana never looked better than in the days after her divorce. Divestment was the name of the game, in her life and in her looks. The downsizing started with her Kensington Palace staff, which she reduced to cleaner, cook, and dresser. The assiduous Paul Burrell became maître d’ of her private life, combining the roles of P.A., man Friday, driver, delivery boy, confidant, and crying towel. Burrell recalls in his memoir The Way We Were how Diana reinforced her break with married life by stuffing a heavy-duty garbage bag with a set of Prince of Wales china and then smashing it with a hammer. “Make a list of everything we need,” she told Burrell. “Let’s spend a bit more of his money while we can!”\n\nDiana now used police protection only when she attended a public event. Her favorite officer was Colin Tebbutt, who had retired from the Royal Protection Squad. A tall, well-built matinee idol, Tebbutt knew that by going to work for Diana he was effectively shutting the door to any future work with the Prince of Wales, but he had a soft spot for her. “There was always a buzz when she was at home. . . . I thought she was beginning to enjoy life. She was a different lady, maturing.” Tebbutt says she would always sit in the front of the car, unlike some of the other royals, such as the late Princess Margaret, who called him by his surname and, without looking up from her newspaper, would bark “Wireless!” when she wanted him to turn on the radio.\n\n“I drive looking in all three mirrors, so I’d say to Diana, ‘I’m not looking at your legs, ma’am,’ and she’d laugh.” The press knew the faces of Diana’s drivers, so to shake them off, Tebbutt sometimes wore disguises. “She wanted to go to the hairdresser one day, shortly before she died. I had an old Toyota, which she called the ‘tart trap,’ so I drove her in that. I went to the trunk and got out a big baseball hat and glasses. When she came out, I was dripping with sweat, and she said, ‘What on earth are you doing?’ I said, ‘I’m in disguise.’ She said, ‘It may have slipped your notice, but I’m the Princess of Wales.’”\n\nEvery Tuesday night, Burrell tells us, Diana would sit at her desk in her study at Kensington Palace, writing a steady stream of heartfelt thank-you letters and listening to Rachmaninoff’s Piano Concerto No. 2 and—her favorite—Manning Sherwin’s “A Nightingale Sang in Berkeley Square.” Maureen Stevens, a clerk from the Prince of Wales’s office who also happened to be a classically trained pianist, would give Diana a weekly private recital as she worked. You can almost hear Stevens’s piano rippling in the background as Diana writes a fulsome note to her close friend Liz Tilberis, the late editor of Harper’s Bazaar: “Dearest Liz, How proud I was to be at your side on Monday evening.… So deeply moved by your personal touch—the presents for the boys, candles at the hotel and flowers to name but few—but most of all your beaming smile, your loving heart. I am always here for you, Liz.” Sometimes Diana would stop and telephone the Daily Mail's Richard Kay—Ricardo, she called him—to help her with the phraseology of a letter. The palace was her fortress. On warm summer afternoons, she would vanish into its walled garden in shorts and vest and Versace sunglasses, carrying a bag of books and CDs for her Walkman. On weekends, when William and Harry were home, Burrell would see her in a flowing cotton skirt on her bicycle, speeding down the palace drive with the boys pedaling furiously behind her. On her 36th birthday, in July 1997, she received 90 bouquets of flowers, and Harry gathered a group of classmates to sing “Happy Birthday” to her over the telephone.\n\nDiana’s charity commitments were pared down from around a hundred to the six she cared most about: the Royal Marsden Hospital, the Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children, the English National Ballet, the Leprosy Mission, the National aids Trust, and Centrepoint, to benefit the homeless. The public announcement of this, which she insisted on, reaped her unnecessary flak and the resignation of her media adviser, Jane Atkinson, but Diana had a reason for being explicit. She wanted to avoid situations where she was just a letterhead. “If I’m going to talk on behalf of any cause, I want to go and see the problem for myself and learn about it,” she told the chairman of the Washington Post Company, the late Katharine “Kay” Graham.\n\nThere was a round of social purging. Elton John was in the deep freeze after a dispute with Diana and Gianni Versace about the fashion designer’s coffee-table book Rock and Royalty. (Pictures of members of the royal family, including one of the Princess and the boys, appeared amid a portfolio of semi-nude male models, and Diana feared that would upset the Queen. Royalties from the book benefited John’s aids foundation.) Sir Ronald Grierson was bounced after he made the mistake of offering a job to one of the many secretaries Diana froze out. And Fergie was back in Siberia, this time for good. The divorced duchess had cashed in with an anodyne memoir, some of which annoyed her sister-in-law—particularly one fatal line. She wrote that when she had worn a pair of Diana’s shoes she caught a verruca—plantar wart—from them. Goddesses don’t get warts. Despite Fergie’s pleading apologies, Diana never spoke to her again. In 1997 the Princess gave a birthday party for her friend David Tang, the Hong Kong entrepreneur, and told him he could ask anyone he wanted.\n\n“Anyone?” he asked.\n\n“Anyone.”\n\n“All right, then—Fergie.”\n\n“Absolutely not,” Diana replied, and would not be moved.\n\nA new and unexpected ally was Raine, Diana’s formidable stepmother. In 1993, Diana had finally made her peace with her. The painful years of separation from Charles made the Princess see her old adversary in a different light. Still grieving for Daddy, her greatest support, Diana was at last able to recognize that Raine had loved him, too. She invited her stepmother for a weepy reconciliation over lunch at Kensington Palace. For moral support, Raine brought along her French fiancé, Count Jean-François de Chambrun. The precaution turned out to be unnecessary. Afterward, the Princess and the countess were often sighted deep in tête-à-têtes in the grill at the Connaught hotel. According to Diana’s therapist, Simone Simmons, one of Raine’s cautions was to try to stay on friendly terms with Charles for the sake of the children. She told Diana that both she—Raine—and her mother, the romance novelist Barbara Cartland, had maintained warm relations with all their former husbands and lovers.\n\nDiana also made an improbable friend of Kay Graham. They had met in the summer of 1994, when Lucia Flecha de Lima, wife of the Brazilian ambassador to the United States, took Diana to Graham’s beachfront house, on Martha’s Vineyard. Two years later, Kay gave a luncheon at her Washington home for Diana and Hillary Clinton. At a British Embassy lunch on the same visit, Diana became re-acquainted with Colin Powell. He told her he had been nominated to lead her in the dancing at the gala that night to raise money for the Nina Hyde Center for Breast Cancer Research. Scotland Yard had been worried that at a ball in Chicago earlier in the year a stranger had cut in on Diana’s dancing partner. The general was deemed able to handle such an eventuality, but the Princess suggested she do a few practice spins with him in the embassy drawing room. “She was easy with any melody, and we did all right in our rehearsal,” says Powell. “She told me, ‘There’s only one thing you ought to know. I’ll be wearing a backless dress tonight. Can you cope with that?’” Flirting with the big boys—what bliss!\n\nDiana thrived in America. “There is no ‘Establishment’ there,” she told her fashion friend Roberto Devorik—wrongly, of course, but correct in the sense that America had no Establishment whose rules or members could possibly hurt her feelings. Richard Kay wrote shortly after her death that she thought of America as “a country so brimming over with glittery people and celebrities she could ‘disappear.’”\n\nA Royal Rummage Sale\n\nLike her life, Diana’s taste in fashion became pared down and emphatic after her divorce. “English style refracted through an un-English sensibility” was how Vogue’s Hamish Bowles defined it. Her new evening dresses were minimalist and sexy, a look that had been taboo when she was an in-house royal. “She knew she had great legs, and after her divorce she wanted to show them off,” said the designer Jacques Azagury. She wore his stunning red bugle-beaded tunic over a short pencil skirt in Venice in 1995 and his blue crystal-beaded cocktail dress six inches above the knee to an event in London in 1997. Diana actually looked her best at her most informal, jumping rangily out of her car for lunch at Le Caprice with Rosa Monckton, the former U.K. president of Tiffany. Wearing stonewashed jeans, a white T-shirt, a beautifully cut navy-blue blazer, and flats with bare feet (she was usually shod in Jimmy Choo’s black grosgrain “Diana” loafers), she was spectacular. Vanity Fair assigned the Peruvian-born photographer Mario Testino to capture her as she now wanted to be seen: a modern woman, active on the world stage—”vivid, energetic, and fascinating,” in the words of Meredith Etherington-Smith, the former fashion editor who introduced Diana to Testino. When Etherington-Smith first saw Diana at Kensington Palace, she was astonished at how different she was from the formal, public Princess of old. Now, she wrote, she was “a tall, electrifying figure,” wearing no makeup and “revealing the truest English rose complexion. Her hair—no longer a stiff helmet—free of lacquer and back-combing, flew around her head like a dandelion in the wind.” With her unerring sense of the dramatic, Diana timed Testino’s stunning shoot to appear on the cover of Vanity Fair on the first anniversary of her divorce.\n\nShe purged her closets of the past. Diana hated the sight of the froufrou’d and sequined relics of her roles as Princess Bride and Windsor Wife and Dynasty Di, embalmed in their suit bags. It was Prince William’s brainstorm for her to auction off her old gowns for charity in New York, and Diana loved the notion. It would be at once a glorious psychic gesture to her new life and a boon to the charities she chose, including the aids Crisis Trust and the Royal Marsden Hospital. A royal rummage sale had never happened before. Most of the Windsor women, including the Queen, consign their old private-occasion items to a discreetly respectable resale shop in London’s West End. Diana’s auction would be a first.\n\nOld clothes are often suffused with the emotions of the wearer. Meredith Etherington-Smith, who also worked as marketing director of Christie’s, was assigned by the auction house to help Diana choose and catalogue the items. They sorted through gowns every morning for a month while Diana relived the occasions on which she had worn them. “Out! Out!” she would cry, pointing at some star-spangled throwback, or “No! I can’t bear to give up this one!” In and out of the catalogue flew Victor Edelstein’s oyster dinner dress with a strapless bodice encrusted with white bugle beads and matching bolero, which she had worn that elegant night at the Élysée Palace with President and Madame Mitterrand. “It was such a happy evening,” she said. She had been afraid of the French being so chic, but she felt she had really pulled it off. She sighed over another Edelstein gown, an ink-blue silk-velvet creation. This was the dress in which she had wowed the world dancing with John Travolta at the White House. She relinquished it in the end, knowing it would get the auction’s top dollar. (An anonymous bidder snapped it up for $222,500.) In retrospect, wrote the fashion maven Suzy Menkes in the International Herald Tribune, all the high-glamour outfits of Diana’s past looked “like a dress rehearsal for the little black number worn on the evening Prince Charles confessed to adultery on prime-time television.”\n\nThat evening, June 29, 1994, at about the moment the Prince of Wales was heard on the air with Jonathan Dimbleby, his wife was stepping out of a limo to be the patron at Vanity Fair’s annual fund-raising event for the Serpentine Gallery, in Kensington Gardens, hosted by her friend Peter Palumbo and Graydon Carter. She was wearing what fashion editors would later call among themselves “her fuck-you dress,” a short, sexy, off-the-shoulder black chiffon number with a scarf panel wafting from the waist, and black silk high-heeled Manolo Blahnik shoes. The dress’s previously obscure Greek designer, Christina Stambolian, told the fashion commentator Georgina Howell that the Princess “chose not to play the scene like Odette, innocent in white. She was clearly angry. She played it like Odile, in black. She wore bright red nail enamel, which we had never seen her do before. She was saying, ‘Let’s be wicked tonight!’” The pictures of her that blew Charles off the front pages the next morning provided the perfect context for discussing the only line in the Dimbleby broadcast that anyone remembered—the one about adultery. Here was, as The Sun put it, “the Thrilla He Left to Woo Camilla.”\n\nBut now, in the year after her divorce, relations with Prince Charles were on a nicely even keel again. The arrival in 1996 of Mark Bolland as Charles’s deputy private secretary inaugurated an era of détente between the offices of the Princess and the Prince. Bolland was a shrewd go-to guy with a marketing background and a useful four years of experience as director of the Press Complaints Commission. He lived in the real world, not the palace bubble. He owed his job to Camilla Parker Bowles; he had come to Charles on the recommendation of her divorce lawyer, Hilary Browne-Wilkinson. In spite of that—or more likely because of it—part of his mandate was to end the war between the Waleses. It got in the way, he believed, of the necessary rebuilding of Prince Charles’s image. Bolland’s first act was to persuade Charles to rid the Prince’s office of those individuals who were holdovers from the bitter years of marital competition.\n\nDr. Khan, “The One”\n\nBetter than all of the above, however, was the fact that Diana’s love life had simplified in a wonderful way. In the fall of 1995, she had at last fallen for a man who was worthy of her affections, who wasn’t married, and who reciprocated her feelings: the 35-year-old Pakistani heart surgeon Dr. Hasnat Khan.\n\n“The One,” as she called him, was the oldest of four children from an affluent, closely knit, upper-middle-class family in Jhelum, north of Lahore. Diana met him at the Royal Brompton Hospital, where she had gone to visit the husband of her soother in chief, the Irish nurse-cum-acupuncturist Oonagh Shanley-Toffolo. Joseph Toffolo had suffered a massive hemorrhage during a triple-bypass operation. Dr. Khan, the senior resident working with the distinguished surgeon Professor Sir Magdi Yacoub, was in attendance. Khan, a young Omar Sharif figure in a white coat, arrived with his retinue of assistants when Diana was at the patient’s bedside. The doctor was entirely absorbed in Toffolo’s condition and took little notice of the Princess—which, for a woman used to having everyone fawn over her, was almost unbearably sexy. So was the blood on his operating shoes, and so were his caring, expressive eyes. “Oonagh, isn’t he drop-dead gorgeous!,” Diana hissed after Khan had left the room. So gorgeous, in fact, that the bemused Joseph had Diana fussing over him at his bedside for 17 days straight. In no time, the Kensington Palace apartment was fragrant with the scent of burning joss sticks. The Princess became a student of cardiology; her night table groaned under a fat copy of Gray’s Anatomy and piles of surgical reports. She watched Casualty, a hospital soap opera, every Saturday night. Her closet filled up with a colorful selection of shalwar kameezes, the silk tunics and trousers worn by Pakistani women. She even considered converting to Islam.\n\nDiana took to meeting with Dr. Khan in his small overnight room at the Royal Brompton Hospital. She asked if she could watch him perform open-heart surgery. “Anybody with courage enough to watch a heart operation can come in,” Khan told her. He couldn’t keep her away after that. Sky TV had arranged to film Sir Magdi Yacoub operating at the Harefield Hospital on a seven-year-old African boy, flown to the U.K. by the Chain of Hope charity. The organization asked Diana if she would attend to boost the viewership. The footage of her Bambi eyes with black eyeliner peering over the top of a white surgical mask in the operating theater was the focus of much satirical commentary. Awkwardly, in late November 1995, a photographer from the News of the World caught Diana at the hospital at midnight. She was due to meet Khan as he came off his shift. Borrowing the photographer’s mobile phone, she spoke to the paper’s royal correspondent, Clive Goodman (nicknamed “the Eternal Flame” by his colleagues because he never left the office—no longer the case, alas, since he was sent to jail this year for tapping into the Clarence House voice mail). She told Goodman that, yes, it was true, she was at the hospital comforting terminally ill patients. She did it, she told him, up to four hours a night three times a week. “I try to be there for them. . . . I seem to draw strength from them. . . . They all need someone. . . . I hold their hands, talk to them—whatever helps.”\n\nGoodman bit. my secret nights as an angel was the *News of the World’*s headline four days later. The story gave birth to an eerie new image of Diana as a compulsive ambulance chaser and death groupie. Private Eye came up with a “Di-no Card,” which said, “I, the undersigned, wish to make it clear that in the event of any injury, mental breakdown, life-threatening disease, or other such personal tragedy, I do not wish under any circumstances to be visited by the Princess of Wales.” But better to be the butt of jokes than to be busted for rendezvous with a young Muslim doctor.\n\nIt was worth it. The relationship with Hasnat Khan was the most fulfilling she had ever had. “I found my peace,” she confessed to Lady Bowker, widow of the diplomat Sir James Bowker, according to biographer Sally Bedell Smith. “He has given me all the things I need.” The doctor didn’t want anything from her. She reportedly offered to buy him a new car, and he proudly refused. He had a dread of personal publicity. He was not interested in high life or fashionability. His one-bedroom apartment in Chelsea was a mess, and there was a bit of a paunch under the old T-shirts he wore when he was off duty. He loved what was best about Diana—her compassionate nature, her desire to embrace humanitarian causes. Diana intended to turn the former equerry’s room in her apartment at Kensington Palace into a basement den for “Natty,” as he was known, so that he could pop open a can of Budweiser and sit around watching soccer. On weekends, when the staff was off, she would try her hand at cooking him dinner. “Marks & Spencer have got these very clever little meals that you just put in the microwave and you put the timer on and press the button and it’s done for you!” she marveled to Simone Simmons.\n\nShe would sometimes disappear for a whole day to Khan’s apartment, where she contentedly vacuumed, did the dishes, and ironed his shirts. On the night of her birthday, she reportedly went out to meet Khan wearing her best sapphire-and-diamond earrings, a fur coat, and, underneath, nothing. Paul Burrell helped run the affair behind the scenes. If there was a lovers’ quarrel, he would deliver a message to a pub where Khan hung out, near the hospital. Diana was practiced at keeping things secret. The press rarely found out about the men she was seeing if she didn’t want them to.\n\nShe made trips to Pakistan whenever she could to bone up on Hasnat’s heritage. Her new best friend was Jemima Khan, the beautiful 22-year-old daughter of Annabel and Jimmy Goldsmith. At the time Jemima was married to the Pakistani cricket legend Imran Khan. The two women would sit up talking late into the night about how to handle marriage to a traditional-minded Muslim. Diana asked Burrell to talk to a priest about the possibility of a secret marriage to Hasnat. The butler had a meeting with Father Tony Parsons at the Roman Catholic Carmelite Church, on Kensington Church Street, where Burrell’s son was an altar boy. The priest told him it was impossible to marry a couple without notifying the authorities—let alone without notifying the fiancé, as it turned out. Hasnat Khan was aghast when he learned of Burrell’s consultation and said to Diana, “Do you honestly think you can just bring a priest here and get married?”\n\nIn February 1996, Diana went to Pakistan with Annabel Goldsmith and her niece, Cosima Somerset, to visit Jemima and Imran in Lahore. The ostensible purpose of the visit was to raise funds for the Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital, founded by Imran in memory of his mother, who had died from the disease. But the real purpose was to flood the zone with images that would wow Hasnat’s family.\n\nDiana’s desire to impress Khan gave her new purpose. He was a serious man for whom she wanted to do serious things. She was looking for a cause that would passionately involve her, something in which her presence could produce a transformative result, as it had done in the mid-80s with aids. “She felt very strongly about getting involved with something that wasn’t a ballet charity,” said a friend. Mike Whitlam, then director general of the British Red Cross, had the answer. The Red Cross was among the charities Diana had dropped right after the divorce, but Whitlam understood her value and her temperament. He had seen how effective she was in ladling out soup to children in the Zimbabwe bush, but he had also taken note of why her participation on a special advisory committee of the International Red Cross in 1994 had failed. According to royal reporter Andrew Morton, Diana couldn’t cope with long, detail-oriented briefings on the Rwandan refugee problem. In committee meetings she had the attention span of a fruit fly. The Red Cross was in the network of global organizations campaigning for a ban on the use of land mines, their clearance, and help for their victims. Whitlam began sending Diana photographs and reports about the devastating effects of mines that had been left uncleared after wars. He saw this as the right cause for Diana at the right time.\n\nThe Princess in Africa\n\nOn January 13, 1997, wearing blue jeans and a blazer, Diana stepped into the throbbing heat of Luanda, the capital of Angola, after an 11-hour flight to southern Africa with Whitlam and Lord Deedes, the grand old man of The Daily Telegraph. The country was reeling from a 20-year civil war. During the war an estimated nine million mines had been scattered among a population of 10 million, and clearance had barely begun. The streets were populated with men, women, and children without legs, few of whom had wheelchairs or even crutches. Some 70,000 innocents had stepped on land mines; every 334th citizen was an amputee, but only a few hundred false limbs were fitted every month. Diana was galvanized by what she saw. In the wreck of Huambo, still a disputed and heavily mined city, she and her party had to walk in single file behind an anti-mine engineer to reach a small, godforsaken hospital that had no electricity and not enough beds. There was 16-year-old Rosaline, who had lost her right leg and the baby in her womb. And there was seven-year-old Helena, who had gone out to get water and stepped on a mine. It had blown out her intestines. A saline drip was keeping her alive. Flies buzzed around her. The photographer Arthur Edwards, who was covering the expedition for The Sun, says the child was lying exposed on her back when Diana got to her. “The first thing she did was something instinctive. She made the child decent, covered her up. It was the thing a mother would do. She was concerned for the child’s dignity.” The rightness of her gesture was something he never forgot, nor was the way she talked softly to the child and stroked her hand. After she moved on, Christina Lamb, the Sunday Times foreign correspondent, who spoke Portuguese, stayed with the dying child. “She said to me, ‘Who was that?’ And it was quite hard trying to explain Princess Diana to somebody who didn’t know. And I said, ‘She’s a princess from England, from far away.’ And she said to me, ‘Is she an angel?’”\n\nLittle Helena died soon afterward. “The last thing she saw,” reflected Lamb, was this “beautiful lady that she thought was an angel.”\n\nDiana had no celestial qualities in the eyes of various Tory M.P.’s and ministers in the government in London. She was “ill-advised,” a “loose cannon,” according to Lord Howe, a junior defense minister. Howe was offended that Diana’s support for a ban on land mines was out of line with Tory policy, which was to oppose a unilateral ban while working for a worldwide ban that would exempt “smart mines,” which are effective only for a short time. Peter Viggers, a Tory member of the Commons Defense Select Committee, popped a vein. Why, she was just like Brigitte Bardot banging on about saving cats! The Princess, he said, was “very ill-informed. . . . This is an important sophisticated argument. It doesn’t help to point at the amputees and say how terrible it is.”\n\nActually, it did help. It helped enormously. The “very ill-informed” Princess was backed by Tony Blair’s Labour opposition, by the Liberal Democrats, by Lord Deedes, and by military figures no less imposing than two Gulf War generals, Norman Schwarzkopf and Sir Peter de la Billière. She had landed herself in the middle of exactly the kind of controversy Henry Kissinger had warned her to avoid. Well, too bad. Angola was a snapshot of the woman Diana was about to be. “I never saw someone as much a project under construction as Diana,” said one of her friends from this period. “We usually do that stuff in the wings of our personalities, but with Diana you could almost see the plumbing and the wires as she was changing in front of you.”\n\nDiana’s land-mine commitment was not, to use one of the Queen’s favorite pejoratives, a “stunt.” It drew forth everything that was best about her in the service of a cause that was heartrending, underpublicized, and controversial. Chased in Angola by the press the day after the Tory smoke bombs went off in London, Diana did not engage in argument. “It’s an unnecessary distraction. . . . It’s sad. . . . I’m a humanitarian, not a politician.”\n\nAnd, indeed, few politicians would have had the courage to do what she did next. The Red Cross had decided that it was too dangerous to go to Cuito, believed to be Africa’s most heavily mined town, which was laced with booby traps. Seven children had just been killed playing soccer in an area that was supposed to have been cleared. But Diana would not hear of canceling. She pressed Whitlam, who was anxious about her safety. She lobbied the wife of the president of Angola. And the next day she was in Cuito and then in nearby Huambo, in a visor and body armor over a white cotton shirt and khaki pants, ready to be delicately guided through another allegedly cleared area—even though exposed and half-extracted mines were visible. The staff of the halo Trust, a British charity that clears mines, warned her to stay close to them. “I think by the end of the briefing she was beginning to wonder whether this was a good idea,” said Whitlam. “But she did it.”\n\nBringing to bear all the reckless bravery she’d once used to defy the royal family—but in a much better cause—she walked through a half-cleared minefield. “One or two journalists,” said Whitlam, “hadn’t quite got the shot they wanted and jokingly asked her if she’d mind doing it again.” To everyone’s astonishment, she agreed. “She realized that this was one of the shots that was really going to make a big impact around the world,” said Whitlam. “So she did the walk a second time.” This second walk was Diana’s purest synthesis of courage, calculation, and brilliantly directed media power.\n\nThe Tory government, having badly lost the public-relations battle, smoothed it over as a “misunderstanding” and promised support for “progress towards” a worldwide ban. Too late. It was just another sign that they were out of step with popular feeling.\n\nA few months later, the Tories lost the general election by a landslide. Tony Blair, Diana’s new supporter, was prime minister at the age of 43. His victory, on a bright day in May after 18 long years of Tory dominance, was welcomed with the euphoria of a new dawn. A young, modernizing, and empathetic prime minister and his independent, high-powered wife were pledging to end the corrupt, uptight ways of the crusty old Establishment. High five! Diana stayed up all night watching the results coming in on TV. She saw New Labour’s England as a place that would have all the best things about America—classlessness, freshness, and freedom from stifling tradition. And above all, of course, an appreciation of her.\n\n“How dare anyone criticize Diana, Princess of Wales, for taking up this heartrending cause?” wrote Clare Short, who was Tony Blair’s secretary of state for international development, in a July 1997 issue of The Spectator, referring to the land-mine campaign. “Diana’s stand on the issue deserves the utmost praise. Her public profile is able to give hope to millions of victims and campaigners that once and for all there may be a global ban on the manufacture and use of anti-personnel landmines.”\n\nThe Start Down\n\nI wish we could leave Diana’s story there. I wish we could leave her as I saw her one day that summer in New York, at the Four Seasons restaurant, in her mint-green suit and early tan, when she came for the wildly successful auction of her dresses. Then she was a woman of substance who had found her future. But Diana was always fragile in her new roles. Love, or the lack of it, always dragged her down. With that descent came an emotion that never bedeviled her pioneering efforts on behalf of land-mine victims or aids patients: fear.\n\nHasnat Khan was slipping away. He didn’t want to go public—which meant, in effect, that he didn’t want to marry her. Hasnat couldn’t face the onslaught of becoming Di’s New Guy in every tabloid newspaper. He recoiled from the prospect of his work at the hospital being invaded by reporters. There had been a nasty foretaste when the first story of a rumored affair appeared in the Sunday Mirror. Panicked when she heard that it was about to run, Diana turned to Richard Kay for a red-herring counter-story.\n\n“It”—the Mirror’s story—”is bull____,” Kay quoted Diana in the Mail, which was always happy to trash the competition. The Princess, wrote Kay, “is understood to be deeply upset at the allegations because of the hurt they will do William and Harry. Diana told friends ‘It has given me a lot of laughs. In fact, we are laughing ourselves silly.’” Khan did not share the purported mirth. He was as wounded by Diana’s silly denial as he had been irritated by the exposure in the first place. He got on fine with William and Harry—especially William, who had had a long session getting career advice from him one weekend—so that reference annoyed him, too. He was starting to receive racist threats in the mail, which he found stressful. For three weeks after Kay’s story, Khan refused all contact with Diana, rendering her predictably hysterical. The secrecy of their affair actually suited Khan, who had no desire to arouse the wrath of his own relatives.\n\nDiana was better qualified than anyone to know that you marry not just a man but his family. Hasnat Khan was a Pathan, a member of a group of peoples in Pakistan and Afghanistan descended from warriors and notable for their fierce attachment to their cultural traditions. His parents had tried twice, in 1987 and 1992, to marry him off to a suitable Muslim bride with equivalent social standing, and by 1996 they were impatient to try again. It is one of the ironies of Diana’s life that she was always searching to replace her dysfunctional family with one that didn’t want her. This time, as usual, the situation was doomed, but for a novel reason. With the Windsors, she was suitable but not desired. With the Khans, she was desired but not suitable. After Diana had spent 18 months misleading the press, an Express reporter landed an interview with Hasnat’s father, Rashid Khan, who offered a bruising assessment of Diana as a bridal prospect for his son. “He is not going to marry her,” the elder Khan said. “We are looking for a bride for him. She must belong to a respectable family. She should be rich, belonging to upper middle class. Preferably to our bradery (relations) or tribe which is Pathan. But if we do not find her in our own tribe, we can try outside it. But preferably she should be at least a Pakistani Moslem girl.” This was the first time a Spencer had been disdained as “not quite our tribe,” and it only challenged Diana to try even harder to nail Hasnat down.\n\nIt was a hopeless assignment. In May 1997, Diana biographer Kate Snell tells us, Diana’s lover was deeply upset when, without forewarning him, she used the cover of a three-day trip to Pakistan to raise funds for Imran Khan’s cancer hospital in order to descend without notice on Hasnat’s sprawling family in an upscale suburb of Lahore. They clustered around and took her picture and served her English tea until a simultaneous power and water failure drove them outside to sit in a circle in the garden of their walled compound, making pleasant, if stilted, conversation with the charming stranger from the United Kingdom. It was a surreal scene, especially when one considers that Diana pictured herself moving in with them as their new daughter-in-law. The Khans were all perfectly charmed by Diana, who ended the evening lying on the floor watching cartoons with the youngest kids, but charm was irrelevant. Hasnat’s mother had no intention of letting the union happen, and Hasnat had doubts of his own.\n\nHe loved Diana, yes. How could he not? This beautiful, radiant creature, adored by the world, had chosen him, an obscure Pakistani doctor, when she could have had her pick of any billionaire on earth. But it must have troubled Khan that the love he gave her never seemed to be enough. Was anyone’s? “Diana needed more love than perhaps any Englishman can give,” observes Diana’s girlhood friend and later Tory M.P. Hugo Swire. But there may have been no man alive who could have answered the clamorous needs brought on by Diana’s early abandonment by her mother, who chose her lover over her family when Diana was six.\n\nHasnat’s pager would go off 20 times a day on his medical rounds. For a woman so sensitive to the needs of others, Diana was strangely blind when it came to those of the people closest to her. She wanted to own his future, arrange his life. She wanted to re-arrange his surgical schedule so that he could travel with her. “Diana believed, against all the evidence,” opined the essayist Clive James in The New Yorker shortly after her death, “that there was some kind of enchanted place called Abroad, where she could be understood and where she could lead a more normal life.” James saw this place as a recurring theme in the last years of Diana’s life. Her dream was a marriage between two globe-trotting humanitarians, rushing to trouble spots with her compassion and his doctor’s bag. An overdose of public adoration had made her almost delusional. She told me over lunch that day in New York that she thought she could resolve the conflicts of Northern Ireland: “I’m very good at sorting people’s heads out.” She wanted to lift Hasnat out of the annoying grind and insane hours of the Brompton Hospital into some medical habitat where they could live together in sunny exile with a swimming pool—in Australia or South Africa. At an international think-tank dinner in Rimini, Italy, she found herself next to Professor Christiaan Barnard, the septuagenarian heart-transplant pioneer. She lobbied him hard to get Hasnat a position in South Africa and twice gave him dinner at Kensington Palace to discuss Hasnat’s future. The proud Dr. Khan went ballistic, according to Kate Snell, when, on finally meeting Barnard, he was asked to submit his résumé.\n\nIn June, the Khans arrived en masse in Stratford-upon-Avon for their annual holiday. Their presence must have deepened Hasnat’s doubts that a superstar princess could ever be absorbed into his close-knit Muslim family. It was clear to his relatives that he was wrestling with both his love for Diana and what he knew he had to do if he wished to pursue a serious medical career. A bad augury for Khan was a Sunday Mirror story on June 29 alleging that he and Diana had become unofficially engaged after the “astonishing family summit that sealed their love” in Pakistan in May.\n\nIn Snell’s account, Khan, forced into the open, expressed to a trusted Pakistani confidant his agony about what to do. His friend’s advice was unequivocal: “End the affair and get on with [your] life.”\n\nResolved to do that, Hasnat met Diana in an agreed-upon spot in Hyde Park at 10 o’clock one hot night in the second week of July. Knowing she was to be rejected, Diana reproached him with scalding words and tears. She could not really accept that it was over. But Khan was not a man who played games. In August the Khan family, returning to Lahore, gave Hasnat gifts for the beautiful princess who had visited them. He told them to mail them to her instead. He wouldn’t be seeing Diana anymore.\n\nDiana began to sink. She felt she had nowhere to go, no one to share her miseries with. She had cut off Simone Simmons. She was not on speaking terms with her mother— Frances Shand Kydd, sadly, had become a drunk. She had lost her driver’s license in 1996 after failing a Breathalyzer test. She told someone close to her that she had bicycled to a friend’s funeral and, because it started to rain, hitched a ride home in the hearse. She was increasingly indiscreet about the royal family, referring to them as “German dwarfs,” and said the Queen’s dresses looked like something from the Red Cross. Frances infuriated Diana by giving a paid interview to Hello! magazine in May 1997 in which she innocently remarked that her daughter’s loss of her H.R.H. title was “absolutely wonderful,” since it allowed her to find her own identity. More seriously, she angered the Princess with the ferocity of her objection to her daughter’s relationship with Hasnat Khan—”a Pakistani and a Muslim.” Diana cut her off after that. Frances’s letters apologizing to her were returned unopened.\n\nIncreasingly lonely, Diana became unhealthily dependent on Paul Burrell. His busybody influence only fueled her various paranoias. “He didn’t like anybody he thought was closer or had more access to her,” says Mervyn Wycherley, Diana’s former chef. Burrell had hardened her attitude to Fergie too. A friend of the duchess says Burrell whispered to Diana that Fergie, on her book tour in the United States, was using her relationship with the Princess to get publicity. In fairness, it was the TV interviewers, not Fergie, who kept bringing Diana’s name up.\n\nIn bad periods like this, the insecure Diana felt watched and spied on. She had her rooms at Kensington Palace twice swept for bugs. On a trip to Rome with her Argentinean friend Roberto Devorik, she startled him with her violent suspicions. A portrait of Prince Philip hanging on the wall evoked an outburst: “He hates me. He really hates me and would like to see me disappear.” She would wind up dead in a fake accident, she told Devorik. “I am a threat in their eyes. They only use me when they need me for official functions and then they drop me again in the darkness. . . . They are not going to kill me by poisoning me or in a big plane, where others will get hurt. They will do it when I am in a small plane, in a car when I am driving, or in a helicopter.” Devorik asked her why anyone should want to kill her. If she was so afraid, why didn’t she travel with a bodyguard, still available to her from the royal protection squad? She told him she thought they spied on her. She was fed up with being followed around.\n\n“She saw the protectors as assailants,” Clive James noted. “It seemed she would rather have gone down in a hail of broken glass than live in fear.” Diana did live in fear, but it wasn’t death she was afraid of. It was the thought of being dropped again in the darkness, as she put it to Devorik. She had carried that darkness inside her since she was a child. She had always fought it with her dazzle. Now more than ever, she feared being left alone in the dark.\n\n“Roberto, you are so naïve,” she told him. “Don’t you see, they took my H.R.H. title and now they are slowly taking my kids? They are now letting me know when I can have the children.”\n\nThe Big Problem: Camilla\n\nDiana’s feeling of being marginalized was most intense as August approached. The boys disappeared into the heathery wilds of Balmoral, and they loved it. After her divorce from the Prince of Wales, invitations to similar secluded aristocratic estates with shooting for the boys did not gush forth, and she was not inclined to ask her brother for help. With her, William and Harry were stuck in London or harassed at Disney World or forced to behave themselves at some nouveau riche billionaire’s country mansion. She told the writer Shirley Conran that she felt that nothing she could offer William and Harry as a vacation could compete with Balmoral. “They do all those manly, killing things,” she said, “and there’s that wonderful go-cart track.”\n\nThe propinquity of Eton to Windsor meant William had forged a close bond with the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh. Sometimes in the evening the boy would go for a walk in Windsor Great Park with Prince Philip, eagerly responding to his grandfather’s tough code and sense of humor, which Prince Charles had always scorned. Having failed with his own son, Philip saw William as the boy he had always wished he’d had. They shared a passion for military history. It pleased Diana, but it also made her jealous. William was her closest confidant. “She told me she had with her son William very private and very profound conversations,” Roberto Devorik said, “and he was an extraordinary moral support.” William was older than his years, burdened as much by his mother’s confidences as by his future responsibilities; she had taken him through the divorce terms before she agreed to them. She began including him in some of her lunches at Kensington Palace with the press.\n\n“All my hopes are on William now,” she told me. “I’m hoping he will grow up to be as smart about handling the media as John Kennedy Jr.” But William was not John F. Kennedy’s son. He was the heir to the British throne. However much William might look like her and smile like her, he belonged as surely to Prince Charles and the Crown as to Lady Diana Spencer—perhaps more. Inevitably, William would have to become Windsorized. As England’s future King, it was his destiny.\n\nDiana’s fear of exclusion was aggravated by the deterioration of her relationship with Charles. The promising thaw, in which she had invested hopes, did a nosedive once she perceived the key issue in Mark Bolland’s agenda. She had not reckoned that Bolland’s rehab plan for her husband’s image would be focused so intently on the selling of Camilla to the public. The Prince’s mistress would not have sponsored Bolland for the job if his agenda had not tallied with hers. Much of Bolland’s day was spent figuring out who was opposed to this agenda and making sure they left the employ of the Prince of Wales. As for Camilla herself, from not wanting to marry Charles because the status quo suited her, she had taken the opposite position. The divorce from Andrew Parker Bowles in March 1995 had reportedly left her short of money. When a friend went to have lunch with her at her house in Wiltshire after her divorce, he was startled when the doorbell rang and she rushed off to hide. “God, it’s the fishmonger—I haven’t paid him,” she exclaimed. “We have to hide until he’s gone.”\n\nCamilla, however, received good financial counsel to rescue her from the predicament created by Charles. After all, if not for Charles’s confession to Jonathan Dimbleby on television, Camilla wouldn’t have been divorced in the first place. The crux of the advice was that, with her million-pound half-share of the Parker Bowles marital assets, she should buy a house whose upkeep was suitable for her position. Then, on the grounds that the Prince of Wales must be entertained in the style to which he was entitled, he would be prevailed upon to meet the associated costs. Camilla had to be made “cash poor,” one of her friends said to Richard Kay, “to trigger in Charles not so much his sympathy as his responsibility towards the woman in his life.”\n\nIn May 1995, for £850,000 ($1,375,000), Camilla purchased Ray Mill House, a 17-acre estate on the banks of the river Avon, in Wiltshire, and began a campaign of expansion. The new residence slowly acquired a staff of two housekeepers, two gardeners, a chauffeur and car from Prince Charles’s fleet, a separately built security cottage complete with a Scotland Yard protection office, and stabling privileges at Highgrove. Bernie Flannery, the Highgrove butler, was instructed to do Camilla’s grocery shopping at the local Sainsbury’s supermarket whenever she wished—and to charge it to the Prince’s bill. Arguing, truthfully, that a visible royal mistress has to look good, Camilla was granted an annual dress allowance from the Wales war chest. Eventually, Charles is said to have covered her debt of around £130,000 ($210,000) at Coutts bank. Eventually, he granted Camilla her own stipend of £120,000 ($194,000) a year, later raising it to £180,000 ($291,000). Eventually, Camilla Parker Bowles became H.R.H. the Duchess of Cornwall. Eventually—at least my money’s on it—H.R.H. the Duchess of Cornwall will be the Queen. Now that Camilla’s image reversal is complete, former St. James’s Palace staffers are amused that the favored story line in the press is of the patience and fortitude of “the woman who waited.” From the inside, it sure didn’t look that way. “It was Bolland who invented that fiction,” said a former colleague of his. “And, I can tell you, it was quite an aggressive campaign.”\n\nCamilla’s rise hit Diana with blunt force when Charles chose Highgrove as the venue for his mistress’s 50th-birthday celebration, on July 17, 1997. The flagrant use of their former marital home was an unnecessary blow for Diana. It plunged her more deeply into her “darkness.” She was deeply envious as well as deeply hurt: while Charles had found his love, Diana had lost hers. Salt was rubbed in the wound by a flattering television documentary about Camilla—another plank in Bolland’s relentless campaign. Shirley Conran advised Diana not to watch it, but she couldn’t resist. After all this time, she still wanted one question answered: Why? Why was it this woman who had taken it all—her Prince, her emotional security, her destiny as Queen? After watching the program, Diana called her astrologer, Debbie Frank, in anguish. “All the grief in my past is resurfacing,” Diana told her. “I feel terrible . . . so frightened and needy.” She sounded, Frank said, “breathy, child-like, again.”\n\nA Surprise Invitation\n\nShe needed to get out of town. She had toyed for a bit with the idea of spending the summer in the United States, and asked Teddy Forstmann, the financier and a sometime beau, to find her a house near his in Southampton. “I found her something, but five days later she called back and said the security people had said the openness of the Hamptons wasn’t safe,” said Forstmann. It was a boon when the importunate bullfrog Mohamed Al Fayed asked her to bring the boys to stay at his villa in the South of France. There she would be fully protected, not just by the security men who always accompanied the royal boys but by Al Fayed’s own prodigious security. She wanted to nurse her wounds. When her hairdresser, Natalie Symons, arrived on the morning of July 11, after Diana’s breakup with Khan, she was packing for the villa holiday and sobbing her heart out. “I could tell she was totally distraught because she didn’t have any mascara on, and she always puts her mascara on before she does anything else,” Symons recalled.\n\nThe spiral had begun. As she used to say to Patrick Jephson, when he was her private secretary, “Stand by for a mood swing, boys.” But her last oscillations spun so fast that the contrasts seem more shocking. Dodi Al Fayed appeared three days into her holiday in the South of France, summoned by his father, and the vulnerable Diana fell for the bait. Within weeks she was on a cruise alone with Dodi. The woman whose feet disappeared into the green pile carpet covered in pharaohs’ heads aboard Mohamed Al Fayed’s private plane and squealed over Dodi’s gifts in Bulgari boxes was the same woman who, only weeks before, had driven in somber silence up Sniper Alley in the shattered city of Sarajevo to comfort land-mine victims. The woman who posed for a boatload of French paparazzi in a tiger-striped swimsuit and called the gossip columnist Nigel Dempster at the Daily Mail to cackle “we couldn’t just sit in KP (Kensington Palace) all summer” was the same woman who, encountering a woman tending her son’s grave in a Sarajevo cemetery, had tenderly embraced her.\n\n“God, we heard some terrible stories,” said Lord Deedes, who went with her into Sarajevo. “She very often interviewed somebody without an interpreter, and she would take some time over it. There was a widow who had lost her young husband. He had gone fishing and had hit a mine. When we went there the lady was absolutely brain-dead, but when we left she was revived. I really did think there that Diana had a healing touch. There is really no doubt.”\n\nThere is no doubt either that the press really preferred the Princess Di of the past. In Angola, Christina Lamb talked to the “royal hacks” in the bar of Luanda’s Hotel Presidente and heard them “wistfully recalling previous jaunts to Klosters and Barbuda, and longing for the Diana of old who went to balls and banquets and wore Versace instead of flak jackets.” They found that Diana again only a few months later, when Al Fayed’s yacht docked in Porto Cervo, in Sardinia, and Diana and Dodi went shopping. Diana came back to the Jonikal with armfuls of cashmere sweaters, because Dodi had bought her every color they had. She told Rosa Monckton she found his conspicuous consumption embarrassing, but that did not prevent her from making herself demeaningly complicit. Her mother became frantic at being unable to communicate her deep feelings of unease at the pictures appearing at home. Frances made repeated calls to the Queen Mother’s page, William Tallon, a favorite of Diana’s, begging him to try to talk her daughter into breaking her silence when she got back. Tallon had no success. Frances told an old family friend at this time, “I cannot see the sun shining on my daughter’s head again.”\n\nThe murder of the flamboyant fashion star Gianni Versace in South Beach, Florida, on July 15, while Diana was on Al Fayed’s yacht, was a meteor shower in the exploding sky of her final summer. Versace had bridged the gap between fashion and celebrity, just as Diana had bridged the gap between royalty and celebrity. Versace had turned hooker style into high fashion, adopted by movie stars and rock icons in the 80s and 90s. Even a princess could feel exciting in his clothes. He had sent Diana trunkloads of his slinky gowns for nights when she wanted to make a splash. “He was killed,” wrote La Repubblica, “like a prince laid low in his own blood, with one hand outstretched toward his oil paintings, his tapestries, his gold.” Diana at first assumed that the killing (which turned out to be the work of a gay psychopath) was a terrorist assassination. Dodi’s bodyguard Lee Sansum found her on the deck of the Jonikal very early the next morning gazing sadly out to sea. “Do you think they’ll do that to me?” she asked him. She made up with Elton John at Versace’s funeral in Milan, sitting beside him and Sting and patting Elton’s hand comfortingly.\n\nBack and forth she swung that last summer until the pendulum took her to Paris. And yet in the days in between her boat trips with Dodi she seemed to have such a clear new future outlined in London. She plotted with Shirley Conran something she’d never had: a career. “She wanted professional fulfillment,” said Conran. “She wanted to do something herself that would show she wasn’t an idiot.” The something was a great idea—to produce documentaries like the well-received film she had made with the BBC of her trip to Angola. She was all excited about the project—a film every two years, each one the centerpiece of a discrete humanitarian campaign. First, she told Conran, she would raise awareness of the issue, then produce a documentary in partnership with one of the television channels, and ultimately leave a structure in place to maintain her involvement with the cause. It was Diana’s version of a Clinton global initiative—and she had the idea first. The issue she wanted to start with was illiteracy.\n\nDiana, who had once described herself as “thick as a plank,” was getting herself an education after all. Mike Whitlam reminded her during their time in Angola, “Don’t forget there are ten million landmines left by the British in the deserts of North Africa.” She replied, “Mike, I think you’ll find it’s twenty-three million.” And she was right. “We had a public meeting on land mines,” says Lord Deedes, “and she really knew what she was doing. She wasn’t just a royal observer.”\n\nShe wasn’t just a royal anything. That was the beauty of it. Had she lived, losing her H.R.H. might have turned out to be the best thing that had ever happened to her, just as her mother had said. Yes, she was losing most of the perks and protections of the royal cocoon. But the power of her magic touch with the media and the public was something no one could take from her. And what she was gaining was freedom—the freedom to act without the constraints and limitations of palace and political bureaucrats, the freedom to embrace causes of her own choosing regardless of their potential for controversy, the freedom to make a difference on things that mattered and to see results.\n\nIn Ottawa, Canada, not long after her walk through the minefields, 122 governments agreed on a treaty banning the use of anti-personnel land mines. The Nobel committee awarded the campaign the Nobel Peace Prize, coupled with the name of the leading American campaigner, Jody Williams. In the House of Commons, during the second reading of the Landmines Bill, in 1998, the British foreign secretary, Robin Cook, paid handsome tribute to Diana, Princess of Wales, for her “immense contribution to bringing home to many of our constituents the human costs of land mines.”\n\nDiana was not there to hear it. She was alone on an island, in her grave at Althorp, the Spencer-family estate.\n\nTina Brown is a former editor in chief of Vanity Fair.
