        "text": "We are sad to announce the death of James Robert Franco Jr., who passed away at the age of 67 on January 13, 2023, after his battle with pancreatic cancer.\n\nJimmy was born on March 25, 1955, in Brooklyn, New York where he grew up in the Marlboro projects with his parents, James Robert Franco Sr. and Mary Starace Franco, and his younger brother John. It was here in Brooklyn where Jimmy graduated from Lafayette High School, learned to love the game of baseball, and made many of his friendships that would last for years. If there was anything Jimmy loved more than baseball it was his wife, Nancy. She was the love of his life, his anchor through hardships, and his ray of sunshine. Jimmy also loved seeing his nieces and nephews grow up and was proud to be their trusted uncle and godfather.\n\nPresident of Franco’s All-Star Baseball Camp, Jimmy was both coach and mentor to young aspiring baseball players ages 9 through 18, some of which were awarded college scholarships for their dedication to the sport. Jimmy touched the hearts of so many families and inspired children with his love of baseball. For him, the game was about putting in the time and effort, not making any excuses, and giving it your all on the field. Jimmy was also a member of the Brooklyn Baseball Association. While his roots were dug deep in Brooklyn, he eventually moved to Staten Island later in his life. Most recently, Jimmy became a proud member of the Cage Warriors Travel Baseball Program.\n\nJimmy is survived by his beloved wife Nancy, younger brother John, sister-in-law Rose, nieces and nephews Patricia, Antoinella, Alicia, Nicole, John James “JJ”, Ella, and baby Luca, and many more extended family and friends. Jimmy will be missed dearly. He will live forever in our hearts as the loving husband, loyal brother, devoted uncle, and dependable coach he was. May he rest in the sweetest peace."
