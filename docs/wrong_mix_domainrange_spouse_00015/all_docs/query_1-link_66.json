        "text": "The Mace\n\nThe mace carried by the macebearer in the academic processional symbolizes authority. The macebearer carries a mace created and crafted by alumnus Michael V. Jaszczak, â98. Jaszczak created the mace based upon the input of a committee charged with the task of bringing forth a new design utilizing the resources and wealth of talent available in Kent Stateâs School of Art.\n\nThe central motif of the university seal retains the sun of the state seal, signifying state ownership, and is symbolic of the light of knowledge and wisdom. The shield suggests the geographic shape of Ohio. The bird, which symbolizes leadership, is the chimney swift, a species that colonizes on campus and seems to be in constant flight. The university colors of blue and gold are incorporated in the enameled piece, which is set on top of a walnut pole. The mace rests in a walnut stand crafted by David Dalton, Ph.D., who taught for many years in the College of Education, Health and Human Services.\n\nThe Gonfalons\n\nGonfalons are long ceremonial flags or banners suspended from a crossbar. The use of ceremonial banners dates back to the 1500s. Italian towns, for example, each have a gonfalon, which is the official emblem of the town, showing its coat of arms.\n\nEach of the college gonfalons is emblazoned with the Kent State seal on an academic color of one of the collegeâs disciplines, established by academic protocol.\n\nThe Presidentâs Medallion\n\nThe presidentâs medallion symbolizes the responsibility in the Office of the President. Its central motif is the university seal, which retains the sun of the state seal, signifying state ownership, and is symbolic of the light of knowledge and wisdom. The shield suggests the geographic shape of Ohio. The bird, which symbolizes leadership, is the chimney swift.\n\nKent State University is one of the largest university systems in the nation, yet one of the closest families in the world. We embrace diversity and the culture it creates â promoting visionary ideas and bold thinking. From this environment, our students draw strength and support to stand for what matters and to take meaningful action for change.\n\nMore than 100 years after William S. Kent donated his valuable farmland so the state could build a teacher-training school for the area, Kent State is one of Ohioâs leading public universities and a major educational, economic and cultural resource far beyond the Northeast Ohio region it has served since its founding as Kent State Normal School in 1910.\n\nToday, poised to play a leading role in 21st century education, Kent State holds the esteemed distinction of being one of only five institutions in Ohio to be recognized as an elite research university by the Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education. Kent State is the highest-ranking public university in Northern Ohio on the Top Public Schools and Best National Universities lists by U.S. News & World Report.\n\nWith eight campuses spanning Northeast Ohio, a College of Podiatric Medicine, the Twinsburg Academic Center and academic sites in major world cities such as Florence, Geneva and New York, Kent State illuminates the way as a world-class institution. Its programs and partnerships boldly expand the boundaries of knowledge for faculty engaged in research and collaboration, and for students receiving life-changing experiences in experiential and study-away programs.\n\nThe student body comprises nearly 35,000 students, including more than 1,300 international students from 116 countries. The university earns worldwide recognition for its optimum balance of more than 360 undergraduate programs of study and more than 200 graduate programs of study.\n\nThe addition of new teaching and learning environments, from the sciences to the arts, and the development of exciting new academic programs characterize Kent Stateâs focus on transformational educational experiences. The university is accelerating its strategic investment in established areas of research expertise, including environmental science, population health, global understanding and materials sciences. Building upon its historic and foundational research in liquid crystals, Kent State's Advanced Materials and Liquid Crystal Institute embraces a leading international role in advanced materials and soft matter science and innovation.\n\nKent State recognizes its place in history with the May 4 Visitors Center and annual May 4 Commemoration, which pay homage to the seminal events of May 4, 1970, on the university's Kent Campus. The center and annual observances honor those who lost their lives, those who were wounded and those who survived.\n\nWorld-renowned, nationally ranked and regionally vital, Kent State proudly serves higher education and the world with graduates who are finding their purpose and making a difference with their contributions.\n\nWhile some people measure both history and success by tangibles, a Kent State professor emeritus suggests considering timeless intangibles that âcan be measured by the lump in your throat â¦ by walking tall.â On a sun-drenched July day in 1914, Kent Stateâs first graduation class of 34 members walked tall. They led the way for the many hundreds of thousands of Kent State alumni who live and work around the world. Proudly joining their ranks are todayâs newest members of the Kent State family on this glorious day of celebration.\n\nFor more information about Kent State, visit www.kent.edu."
