        "text": "Local media report on Tuesday claimed that Imran Khan’s ex-wife Jemima Khan had denied the claim that she had funded vloggers to increase support for the former prime minister who was imprisoned and his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party.\n\nAccording to Geo News, filmmaker and producer Jemima, who is based in the UK, refuted the assertions made by Asif Ali Zardari, the former president of Pakistan, on Monday.\n\nWhen asked about the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party’s likelihood of returning to Parliament with a two-thirds majority following the elections on February 8, the co-chairman of the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) said that Jemima had funded vloggers in an effort to increase support for the former PTI chief and his organization.\n\n“Please fear God! This is what vloggers settled abroad are saying. Jemima is giving money to these bloggers,” he was quoted as saying in the report.\n\nReplying to a post on social media platform X, Jemima rejected Zardari’s remarks and said, “This is obviously not true.” The 49-year-old British socialite added that she will only ever wish for “peace & prosperity in Pakistan”.\n\nDuring his interview with a private channel, the 68-year-old former president said there is a lobby supporting and financing the vloggers, adding that it had different intentions.\n\nZardari added that Khan, the PTI party’s founder, did not support parliamentary democracy and wanted presidential democracy.\n\n“He was running a cult democracy,” the PPP co-chairman was quoted as saying in the report.\n\nKhan, 71, has been in jail since August 5, when he was arrested after a conviction in the Toshakhana corruption case.\n\nThe former-cricketer-turned-politician is currently jailed at the high-security Adiala prison in Rawalpindi since September 26 in the cipher case for allegedly leaking state secrets and violating the laws of the country.\n\nHe has been facing several cases since he was ousted from power in April last year.\n\n(with inputs from PTI)"
