        "text": "Alison Brie and husband Dave Franco have been together for over a decade, and they just seem to fall deeper in love every year. They also seem to become greater collaborators every year, releasing movie after movie that they either co-star, co-write, or co-produce.\n\nHere’s the full timeline of how they met, married, and formed their creative partnership.\n\nMarch 2011\n\nIn 2011, the soon-to-be couple was enjoying Mardi Gras in New Orleans when a mutual friend introduced them. On an episode of The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon in 2020, Brie described the fated meet up.\n\n“I was there with some friends,” she recalled. “It was some incredible matchmaking done by my friend Jules after we ran into Dave at the airport.”\n\nThat same stellar friend invited him to dinner.\n\nBrie continued, “He was sitting next to her across the table, and my friend texts me under the table and was like, ‘You should hook up with Dave,’ and I responded with, ‘Yes, please’ with a lot of thumbs up emojis. A very enthusiastic response.”\n\nMeanwhile, the friend was checking on Franco’s response to the idea.\n\n“He was like, ‘I’m in!’” the actress said. “It was 48 hours of drugs, sex, a lot of making out.”\n\nAfter the big party, Franco went back to filming a movie in New York City that would later go to Paris. She joined him for some “wining and dining” and the “romantic portion of our meeting each other.”\n\n“He left a secret note in my sweatshirt on our last day of our trip which read, ‘Come with me to Paris,’” she said.\n\nJune 2011\n\nThe couple had been dating for three months when Brie threw her boyfriend a surprise birthday party. During an episode of The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon in 2018, he explained how it went downhill fast.\n\n“When we first started dating, my birthday came up in the first three months of the relationship,” he said. “She started planning a surprise party, which was very sweet. But it got out of control.”\n\nHe continued, “If you know me, you know I’m a pretty private person, and I don’t like to be the center of attention, and so I freaked out and to alleviate my anxiety, I chose to consume a weed cookie. It had the opposite effect I intended. I ran downstairs and had the first panic attack of my life.”\n\nBrie had to ask the guests to leave.\n\n“Alison and I still talk about how if we can survive my surprise party, we can survive anything,” Franco joked.\n\nApril 2012\n\nBrie told Metro that after a year of dating, she knew he was the one.\n\n“There was a semi-immediate click,” she said. “Probably about a year into our relationship, I was like, ‘Oh wow, this thing I thought I maybe never would do, I could definitely see myself doing it with you.’”\n\nMay 2013\n\nThe pair starred in a popular Funny or Die skit about Franco’s dream girl’s name.\n\nAugust 2015\n\nOn Aug. 25, 2015, Brie and Franco got engaged at Big Sur, California, according to E! News. In an interview with Larry King, Brie said it took her a minute to say yes because she was so surprised.\n\n“I was so shocked that I actually burst out laughing, and I asked him a number of times if he was being serious before saying yes,” she recalled.\n\nIt was confusing as well because he was wearing her old silver Mardi Gras mask and holding a fake ring so she could choose her own later.\n\nOn an episode of The Late Late Show with James Corden, Franco explained, “So, we go up to Big Sur, we’re on the back patio, she’s out overlooking the ocean. She turns around, I’m on one knee, I’m wearing the mask, I’m holding up the ring. And because it had been five years, she couldn’t place the mask. She didn’t know what it was.“\n\nHe added, “So, what she sees is me wearing this weird, stupid mask, holding up this janky stone ring. The entire proposal is her saying, ‘What is happening right now?’ And it’s me trying to explain how sweet it is that I kept the mask for five years.”\n\nSeptember 2015\n\nBrie told People, “I have an incredible fiancé. He’s so wonderful. He’s just the sweetest man I know, and he’s so funny and incredible in every way.”\n\nMarch 2016\n\nIn an interview with New York Post, the Community star admitted that she never imagined getting married.\n\n“I was just like, ‘Well, that’s not my life path because I’m choosing this crazy lifestyle,’” she shared. “And then, you know, I fell in love. So, blah, blah, blah, amazing. Acting is fulfilling, but it’s also not the only thing.”\n\nMarch 2017\n\nThe couple was married in March 2017, according to People, in an intimate wedding ceremony. On Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen, Brie shared what her favorite part of the big day was.\n\n“Probably our wedding vows because we wrote our own and didn’t know what the other person was going to say,” she said. “It’s funny to hear them out loud, and you feel like, ‘We said all the same things that we want to be for each other.’ That was very sweet.”\n\nFranco told Entertainment Tonight, “It was great, it was really special. It was intimate, and it was really fun.”\n\nJune 2017\n\nTheir first movie together, the romantic comedy The Little Hours, was released. In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, the two were asked what they learned while shooting. Franco joked, “We learned that Alison should not be on set while I’m having sex scenes with other women.”\n\nBrie answered, “I left for those. I did leave for those.”\n\nShe then added, “It was so wonderful to work together. So easy, so wonderful to work with someone that you’re getting married to.”\n\nSeptember 2017\n\nDuring an appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, Franco shared how he and Brie love their cats.\n\n“I don’t know how I became the quirky cat guy,” he said. “At one point in my life, I was the single guy with two 16-pound cats. It definitely weeds out a lot of potential dating partners. Alison loves them, thank God. She was really the only option [for marriage].”\n\nNovember 2017\n\n“Something about being married made me feel so settled, almost more free, I guess, rather than trapped,” Brie told People in 2017. “It’s great, so now, let’s go do whatever we want. Onward and upward.”\n\nDecember 2017\n\nThe couple collaborated again and appeared in The Disaster Artist.\n\n“It’s so nice to work with your person, to be on set with someone who is the person you feel the most comfortable with in the world,” she told Hello Giggles. “It's a really great feeling, especially to be intimate with them on set or to have romantic or kissing scenes with that person. It’s delightfully easy. He just makes a great point, and he and I talk about this all the time. We do really love working with each other.”\n\nJune 2018\n\nWhile talking to The Sunday Times Brie shared that she and Franco were not planning on having kids and focus their limited free time on their cats, Harry and Arturo.\n\n“It's great because I don’t have to worry about when should I get pregnant–between seasons [of Netflix's GLOW], while we’re shooting the show—I don’t think about it every day,” the actress said. “It would be nice, but I think of all the things that would be so stressful. I think about how much we're involved in our cats’ lives. Oh my God, if it was a child!”\n\nShe also shared more about marriage, saying, “We spend time together at night. We just like to hang out. Having a really supportive partner in my life and knowing that he loves me no matter what. I’ve found my person.”\n\nJanuary 2019\n\nFranco and Brie walked the red carpet at the 2019 Golden Globe awards, and Franco also helped his wife when she got caught up in her Vera Wang look.\n\n“She got her dress caught in the bush and I went in and took it out of the bush and then it became a big thing,” he explained after on the TODAY show. “I gotta look out for her.”\n\nHe added, “She put a lot of work into hair and makeup, and that dress ... We gotta make sure she’s looking perfect. She looked beautiful that night.”\n\nJune 2020\n\nTheir third film together, The Rental, was a co-writing project. Franco then directed, with Brie in the lead as Michelle.\n\n“We’ve acted together, and so we knew that we would get along well on a set, but we’ve obviously never worked together in this capacity,” he said of directing his wife. “But what I will say is that I’ve always known that she’s an amazing actress.”\n\n“To be able to go home to her every night and have someone who would build me up and remind me that things were going well and that I was doing a good job—it was invaluable, and I honestly don’t think I could have done this without her,” he told Moviemaker Magazine.\n\nShe was super proud of him though.\n\n“I enjoyed watching him work with everybody and seeing the crew fall in love with him because he was so collaborative and so passionate,” she told People. “His enthusiasm on set is infectious, and it made me fall in love with him all over again.”\n\nThat month, they did suffer a loss when their cat Harry passed away. Brie wrote a loving tribute to him on Instagram.\n\n“Said goodbye to this perfect [angel] today,” she wrote. “Harry… Harold… Harrison… my sweet boy. My old man. You were quite a talker these last couple of years. Your favorite place was in my arms. And your tail was wagging till the very end. The sweetest cat that ever lived.”\n\nApril 2021\n\nWhen talking to People about quarantining with Franco, Brie said it brought them closer.\n\n“Dave and I went through the first couple months in party mode, thinking we’re on vacation,” she said. “Let’s drink wine. Let’s make a lot of pasta. And then we’re like, it’s going on for longer, so let’s go into culinary experimental mode where we’re trying to make new dishes and things like that. And then we got into health mode, and then we also were in creative mode, and we were doing a lot of writing together. So, I mean, I think we feel closer than ever.”\n\nAugust 2021\n\nIn August 2021, the couple announced their plans for a new romantic comedy, Somebody I Used to Know, which they co-wrote during lockdown. Once again, Brie was the lead while Franco directed.\n\n“Alison and I love romantic comedies and were inspired by the classics from the ’80s and ’90s,” Franco said in a statement.\n\nApril 2022\n\nOn The Drew Barrymore Show, Brie shared the rules for how her and Franco’s marriage has lasted five years.\n\n“The first one is respect,” she shared. “I think we respect each other, and we are so kind to each other. We really take care with the way we speak to one another on a daily basis, and it makes a big difference I think.”\n\nThey also openly share their feelings.\n\n“Every day since [we met], I’m like, “God, I’m in love with you,’” she said. “‘I love you too.’ There’s something nice about that.”\n\nAugust 2022\n\nBrie and director Jeff Baena co-wrote the comedy Spin Me Round, and she attributed the project in part to her husband, according to People, because watching him get into screenwriting was so inspiring.\n\n“I think that was the impetus for any writing on my part—was watching Dave write The Rental with Joe Swanberg and seeing his excitement as he was trying out this new endeavor every day,” she said. She added he was “so empowered and electrified by the process” after working on The Rental.\n\nShe also told People more about how she and Franco approach filming sex scenes.\n\n“Dave and I usually do have some kind of conversation before any job, I think just to give the other person a heads up of sort of like, ‘Oh, I have some romantic scenes in this movie,’” she said. “You don’t want to blindside anyone, I think, with that information. But at the same time, it’s a part of our job. It’s a strange part, and I can see how to the outside eye [it might come off].”\n\nNovember 2022\n\nThe couple visited NYC together, stopping in at Ludlow Coffee Supply, Washington Square Park, Charles Prime Rib, and Broadway.\n\nFebruary 2023\n\nWhile watching Franco direct Somebody I Used to Know, Brie was even more enthused about her man.\n\n“He’s astonishing,” she said. “I’ve always known that he is an incredibly kind, genuine, curious person, but seeing him in action as a director and the way that he collaborates with the crew, it makes me fall in love with him every time, all over again. I know it sounds so cheesy.”\n\nDuring an interview with Entertainment Weekly, the pair said they love collaborating.\n\n“As actors, we would sometimes spend months apart and have very little control over when and where we would be working on other jobs,” Brie stated. “So we wanted to start making stuff together partially just to be around each other more.”\n\nThat month, they took the Couples Quiz, sharing an “error” from their first date.\n\n\"If you remember, I was 26 when we met. I just didn’t know what to do. We were late to dinner, and I was freaked out that we were late.
