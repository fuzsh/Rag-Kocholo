        "text": "While the phrase “nepo baby” has become an all-too-common way to say someone’s born into a famous family, there’s yet to be a word, or a phrase, to describe someone who married into one. After all, countless celebrities have now married other celebrities and have blended celebrity families.\n\nEmily Blunt, for example, is lucky enough to call her The Devil Wears Prada co-star Stanley Tucci not only a friend but her brother-in-law too. Tucci married Emily’s sister, Felicity, back in 2012. “They’re a culinary super couple,” the Oppenheimer star gushed of her sister and her husband back in 2021 during an appearance on LIVE With Kelly and Ryan.\n\nThe same goes for Ashlee Simpson, who not only is sister-in-law with Tracee Ellis Ross but became Diana Ross’s daughter-in-law after her marriage to Evan Ross back in 2014. Talk about a famous family!\n\nWe’ve got all of the celebrities you might not have realized were each others in-laws below!"
