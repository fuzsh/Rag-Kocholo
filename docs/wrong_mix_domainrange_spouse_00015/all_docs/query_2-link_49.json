        "text": "“My son is the polo team captain and is bringing honour to Pakistan. He is Nawaz Sharif’s grandson, not Goldsmith’s and he is not being raised in the lap of Jews,” she said.\n\nThen there was a barrage of messages to pacify and extend support to Jemima Goldsmith.\n\n“STAY STRONG @Jemima_Khan!!”\n\nSome even said PML-N Vice-President Maryam Nawaz proved that “money can’t buy you class or manners.”\n\n“Can’t wait for Bhabhi to annihilate this witch!”\n\nTeam Maryam clapped back too. Her supporters hailed her as the epitome of respect. Others said Jemima should blame Imran Khan for finding herself in the line of fire.\n\nPakistani politician Jawad Ahmad called Jemima Goldsmith a “nobody in Pakistan’s politics.”\n\nImran Khan’s real target clearly wasn’t Junaid, but he was trying to take a dig at the Sharif family’s alleged corruption.\n\n“The common man cannot play polo — a kings’ sport. You need a lot of money to keep a horse and play polo. So tell us where this dear grandson got this money from. It’s the people’s money”, Khan had said at the rally.\n\nAfter saying all this, Maryam insisted that she did not want to bring children into it, but Khan deserved a “befitting reply”.\n\nAlso read: ‘The Imran I knew…’: Ex-wife Jemima hits out at Pakistan PM over comments on rape\n\nEntry of Jemima Goldsmith\n\nNot a part of Imran Khan’s life or Pakistan’s politics for over a decade, Jemima Goldsmith spoke up too.\n\n“I left Pakistan in 2004 after a decade of antisemitic attacks by the media & politicians (& weekly death threats & protests outside my house). But still it continues.”\n\nAnd she clearly does have a point.\n\nDespite divorcing Imran Khan over 17 years ago, Goldsmith has been at the receiving end due to her relationship with the cricketer-turned-politician. Including the name Bhabhi, which she is still referred to as. And the occasional “Do you still love IK, Bhabhi” comment.\n\nAlso read: Who’s scared of Maryam Nawaz? PM Imran Khan, his party PTI, and their sexist jokes\n\nThen there’s the Opposition\n\nMaryam Nawaz did not take this one sitting either.\n\n“I have absolutely no interest in you, your sons or your personal lives because I have better things to do and say but if your ex drags in families of others out of spite, others will have nastier things to say. You have only your ex to blame,” she tweeted at Goldsmith.\n\nOne observer in Pakistan, author and banker Mir Mohammad Alikhan, rather interestingly summarised the entire exchange.\n\n“Watching Maryam N Sharif argue with Jemima_Khan is like watching….PHOOLAN DEVI argue with MOTHER TERESA.”\n\nThere is some murky history here between Imran Khan and Nawaz Sharif over Jemima. In 1998, Nawaz Sharif had booked Khan’s then-wife Jemima for allegedly smuggling antiques. She was reportedly sending tiles to her mother in London when the package was seized by customs authorities in Pakistan."
