        "text": "FERRAGAMO: FOOTWEAR, FASHION AND FILM\n\nA seminar in three parts about Italian aesthetics and Ferragamo’s associations to film, with tea break and Q&A.\n\nDr. Giuliana Pieri\n\nFrom Royal Holloway at University of London, introduced us to Italian aesthetics in Italy since 1945.\n\nStefania Ricci\n\nDirector of the Ferragamo Museum in Florence, talked to us about Salvatore Ferragamo’s beginnings in Hollywood and the House’s continuing work with film as well as about Ferragamo’s collaboration with stars such as Audrey Hepburn and Marilyn Monroe.\n\nVICTORIA AND ALBERT MUSEUM – SAT 5 APR | 2:00 – 5:00PM\n\nON-STAGE INTERVIEW WITH ENNIO CAPASA, FROM CoSTUME NATIONAL\n\nItalian fashion designer Ennio Capasa founded Costume National in 1986 with his brother Carlo. The label soon became famous for the timeless approach to style which finds its roots in an avant-garde aesthetic with a minimal-chic and rock ‘n roll attitude.\n\nA continuous search between tradition and innovation, craftsmanship and technology, past and future. The “New York Times” has defined Ennio Capasa as the designer who inspired and revolutionised the 90’s fashion, as Giorgio Armani did for the 80’s.\n\nEnnio Capasa joined fashion writer Camilla Morton for a unique on-stage interview, illustrated with images, about his career, his relationship with cinema and his interests.\n\nCINÉ LUMIÈRE – MON 7 APR | 7:00pm\n\nTHE DIRECTOR: AN EVOLUTION IN THREE ACTS\n\ndir: Christina Voros\n\nwith Frida Giannini, James Franco\n\nUSA | 2013 | 96 min | col | doc| cert. tba\n\nIn English and Italian with English subtitles\n\nIn 2004 Frida Giannini joined the house of Gucci as Head of Women’s Accessories. Two years later she was promoted to be the Creative Director, reviving Gucci’s Florentine roots, with a focus on sensuality, sophistication, Italian craftmanship and youthful freshness. This collaboration between producer James Franco and filmmaker and cinematographer Christina Voros looks at the work of a creative woman juggling the balance between shyness and public exposure, exceptional talent and self-effacement, career and personal life. This film is a must-see for fashion lovers, as well as being an informative documentary on the dynamics behind one of the most successful fashion brands – and the dreams of the people behind it.\n\nThis screening was a premiere in the UK and was preceded by an on-stage conversation between filmmaker Christina Voros and Jemima Khan, Vanity Fair European Editor-at-Large.\n\nCURZON MAYFAIR – TUE 8 APR | 8:30PM\n\nVALENTINO: THE LAST EMPEROR\n\ndir: Matt Tyrnauer\n\nwith Valentino Garavani, Giancarlo Giammetti\n\nUSA | 2008 | 96 min | col | doc | cert. 12\n\nIn English, French and Italian with English subtitles\n\nWith unprecedented access, for over two years writer Matt Tyrnauer followed the supremely glamorous existence of what is one of the most stable and enduring partnerships in the fashion world: that of designer Valentino Garavani and his business partner and companion Giancarlo Giammetti.\n\nThis documentary examines the empire they created together, with its ultimate aim of attaining beauty. Valentino is informative and dynamic, as well as tender, fascinating and hugely fun. Tyrnauer’s film offers a unique glimpse into a fertile partnership, as well as the end of an era and – essentially – a love story.\n\nFollowed by a Q&A with director Matt Tyrnauer\n\nCINÉ LUMIERE – WED 9 APR | 8:30PM\n\nL’AVVENTURA\n\ndir: Michelangelo Antonioni\n\nwith Monica Vitti, Gabrielle Ferzetti, Lea Massari\n\nItaly/France | 1960 | 143 min | b & w | cert. PG |\n\nIn Italian with English subtitles\n\nA meditation on love and its transience, L’avventura follows the search for Anna, who disappears on a boat trip to the Aeolian Islands in the South of Italy. During the search, Anna’s best friend, Claudia, becomes attracted to Sandro, the former’s boyfriend. Adriana Berselli’s costumes for the film, and the way they blend in with the landscape, are key to understanding the characters and the emptiness and futility around them.\n\nPreceded by an introduction\n\nCINÉ LUMIERE – THU 10 APR | 6:15PM\n\nLA DOLCE VITA\n\ndir: Federico Fellini\n\nwith Marcello Mastroianni, Anouk Aimée, Anita Ekberg\n\nItaly/France | 1960 | 174 min | b & w | cert. 12A\n\nIn Italian with English subtitles\n\nLa dolce vita captures the economic renaissance and modernisation of Italy while portraying the internal travails of journalist Marcello, who is torn between his nights out with Rome’s elite, and the infatuated love and conventional life offered by his girlfriend – all the while struggling to be a serious writer. The film’s costumes – which won Piero Gherardi the Academy Award for Best Costume Design in Black and White – portray a sophisticated, expensively dressed and sensually alluring Marcello, as well as an elegantly feline Anouk Aimée wearing black dresses and cat’s-eye sunglasses, and an impossibly glamorous Anita Ekberg.\n\nPreceded by an introduction\n\nCINÉ LUMIÈRE – SUN 13 APR | 4:30PM\n\nThe restoration of La Dolce Vita has been made possible by Gucci as part of a longstanding commitment to restore and preserve significant films through the work of The Film Foundation.\n\nRestored by Cineteca di Bologna at L’Immagine Ritrovata Laboratory in association with The Film Foundation, Centro Sperimentale di Cinematografia-Cineteca Nazionale, Pathé, Fondation Jérôme Seydoux-Pathé, Mediaset-Medusa, Paramount Pictures and Cinecittà Luce.\n\nRestoration funding provided by Gucci and The Film Foundation"
