        "text": "JAMES Franco and girlfriend Isabel Pakzad have been dating for a number of years since they first met in November 2017.\n\nFranco's co-worker and friend Seth Rogan has said that he will no longer work with the actor following a series of sexual assault accusations that have clouded him.\n\nDoes James Franco have a girlfriend?\n\nBorn January 2, 1993, Isabel Pakzad is an actress in her own right.\n\nThe 28-year-old has appeared in films such as Birds Of Prey, The Deuce and This is 25.\n\nIn November 2020, Franco, 42, opened up about his relationship with Pakzad to Variety, admitting that he's working harder on being there for her than he was with an ex.\n\n\"There was one instance, this old girlfriend was visiting me in New York,\" Franco said.\n\n\"I had come out here for school. My cat had scratched her in the eye. I had so much work to get done for the next day, I didn't take her to the hospital.\n\n\"I had my assistant take her. That moment haunted me so much. What kind of selfish, self-centered boyfriend are you?,\" he added.\n\nWas the sexual misconduct suit against Franco settled?\n\nActresses and ex-students of Franco - Sarah Tither-Kaplan and Toni Gaal - filed a sexual misconduct lawsuit against the actor in 2019.\n\nThe plaintiffs alleged Franco intimated students at an acting and film school he founded into gratuitous and exploitative sexual situations.\n\nTheir lawsuit claimed Franco pushed his students into performing in increasingly explicit sex scenes on camera in an \"orgy type setting\" that went far beyond those acceptable on Hollywood film sets.\n\nBoth Tither-Kaplan and Gaal, who first filed the lawsuit in 2019, have agreed to drop their individual claims under an agreement, according to court filing.\n\nAccording to The AP, both sides had been in discussions on a settlement for several months now, and the lawsuit's progress was halted while the parties talked.\n\nPlaintiffs' attorneys from the firm of Valli Kane & Vagnini, LLP confirmed the agreement in a statement to The AP on Saturday, February 20.\n\nThe firm added that it will be \"further memorialized in a Joint Stipulation of Settlement to be filed with the Court at a later date,\" but giving no further comment or details.\n\nLast month, actress Charlyne Yi spoke out about her experience working with James and Seth on the 2017 film, The Disaster Artist, in a lengthy Instagram post.\n\nCharlyne - who played costume designer Safowa Bright-Asare in the movie - said she tried to \"break legal contract\" and quit because she didn't feel \"safe\" working with James.\n\nThe Good Girls actress alleged that bosses \"bribed\" her by offering her a larger role on the movie.\n\nShe wrote: \"When I tried to break legal contract and quit Disaster Artist because James Franco is a sexual predator, they tried to bribe me with a bigger acting role.\n\n\"I cried and told them that that was the exact opposite of what I wanted, that I didn't feel safe working with a f**ing sexual predator.\"\n\nWhat did Seth Rogen say about working with James Franco?\n\nSeth Rogen said he won't work with James Franco after a series of sexual misconduct claims.\n\nHe further claimed he is \"ashamed\" of the joke he made during an episode of Saturday Night Live where they addressed James' alleged messages with a teen girl.\n\nIn an interview with The Sunday Times, Seth addressed the recent scandal surrounding James, who has been his co-star in several movies, such as Pineapple Express, The Disaster Artist, This Is The End, The Interview, Sausage Party, and many others.\n\nThe 39-year-old told the outlet when asked about actress Charlyne Yi who claimed James was a \"sexual predator\" while Seth was \"an enabler:\" \"What I can say is that I despise abuse and harassment, and I would never cover or conceal the actions of someone doing it, or knowingly put someone in a situation where they were around someone like that.\"\n\nThe Canadian actor further addressed the joke he made during an SNL skit in 2014 which made fun of the first allegations made against the 43-year-old.\n\nIn the skit, Seth told the audience: \"To make myself feel better I decided to prank James Franco.\n\n\"I posed as a girl on Instagram told him I was way young. He seemed unfazed. I have a date to meet him at the Ace Hotel.\"\n\nHowever, in light of the most recent allegations, Seth said about the joke: \"I do look back at a joke I made on Saturday Night Live in 2014 and I very much regret making that joke.\n\n\"It was a terrible joke, honestly. And I also look back to that interview in 2018 where I comment that I would keep working with James, and the truth is that I have not and I do not plan to right now.\"\n\nHowever, in light of the most recent allegations, Seth said about the joke: \"I do look back at a joke I made on Saturday Night Live in 2014 and I very much regret making that joke.\n\n\"It was a terrible joke, honestly. And I also look back to that interview in 2018 where I comment that I would keep working with James, and the truth is that I have not and I do not plan to right now.\"\n\nWhat is Franco's net worth?\n\nAs of 2020, Franco has amassed a net worth of $30million, according to Celebrity Net Worth.\n\nOne of his most critically acclaimed projects is the film 127 Hours, for which he was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor.\n\nFranco is also known for appearing in Sam Rami's Spider-Man trilogy, which released in the early 2000s.\n\nThe 42-year-old has appeared in films such as Pineapple Express, Rise Of The Planet Of The Apes, Spring Breakers, This Is The End and The Disaster Artist among others."
