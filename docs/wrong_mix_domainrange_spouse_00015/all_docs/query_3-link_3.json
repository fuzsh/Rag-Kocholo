        "text": "For the Spanish gymnast, see David Franco (gymnast).\n\nAmerican actor (born 1985)\n\nDavid John Franco (born June 12, 1985) is an American actor and filmmaker. He began his career with small roles in films such as Superbad (2007) and Charlie St. Cloud (2010). Following a starring role in the ninth season of the comedy series Scrubs, Franco had his film breakthrough as a supporting role in the buddy comedy film 21 Jump Street (2012).\n\nFranco has also starred in Fright Night (2011), Now You See Me (2013) and its sequel Now You See Me 2 (2016), Neighbors (2014) and its sequel Neighbors 2: Sorority Rising (2016), Nerve (2016), The Disaster Artist (2017), and Day Shift (2022). In 2020, he made his directorial debut with The Rental, which stars his wife Alison Brie.\n\nFranco was born in Palo Alto, California, to Betsy Lou (née Verne), a poet, children's book author,[2] and editor, and Douglas Eugene Franco (1948–2011), who ran a nonprofit agency[2] and a business;[2][3][4] the two met as students at Stanford University.[5][6][7] Franco's father was of Portuguese (from Madeira) and Swedish descent.[8] Franco's mother is Jewish (of Russian Jewish descent);[9] her parents had changed the surname from \"Verovitz\" to \"Verne\". Franco's paternal grandmother, Marjorie (Peterson) Franco, is an author of young adult books.[10][11] Franco's maternal grandmother, Mitzie (Levine) Verne, owned the Verne Art Gallery, a prominent art gallery in Cleveland, and was an active member in the National Council of Jewish Women.[12][13][14] Franco grew up in California with his two older brothers, James and Tom, both of whom are also actors.[15]\n\nHe studied at the University of Southern California, and originally envisioned himself as a high school teacher teaching creative writing, until his brother James Franco's manager guided him to a theater class when he was a sophomore, where he started learning acting skills.[16]\n\nIn 2006, Franco made his acting debut on The CW drama television series 7th Heaven. He appeared in television shows such as Do Not Disturb and Young Justice. Franco also had noticeable roles in films such as Superbad and The Shortcut. In May 2008, he was cast in The CW teen drama television series Privileged.[17] The series centered on a live-in tutor for two spoiled heiresses in Palm Beach. Franco was cast in an initial major recurring role. The series premiered on September 9, 2008, to 3.1 million viewers. Ratings continued to slip each week, with the series sixth episode reaching 1.837 million viewers. The CW did not renew the series for a second season due to low ratings.[18][19]\n\nIn August 2009, Variety announced Franco was cast in a regular role for the ninth season of the ABC sitcom series Scrubs. Portraying the role of Cole Aaronson; Franco went on to appear in all thirteen episodes of the ninth season and received praise from critics for his performance; however, the ninth was the final season of the series.[20]\n\nMTV Networks' NextMovie.com named him one of its \"Breakout Stars to Watch For\" in 2011.[21] In August 2011, Franco starred in the 3D horror comedy film Fright Night alongside Colin Farrell and Toni Collette. The film is a remake of the 1985 film of the same name and received positive reviews from critics and went on to make over $41 million worldwide.\n\nIn April 2012, Shalom Life ranked him and his brother James at number 2 on its list of \"the 50 most talented, intelligent, funny, and gorgeous Jewish men in the world\".[22] In March 2012, Franco starred in the Columbia Pictures action comedy film 21 Jump Street, which was based on the 1987 television series of the same name.\n\nIn 2013, he co-starred in the zombie romance film Warm Bodies, an adaptation of the best-selling novel of the same name.[23] The same year, Franco appeared in the ensemble crime thriller film Now You See Me.

Rivers persuaded Franco to show the card-throwing abilities he had learned and Franco expertly sliced half a banana into a further half with his hotel card.[24]\n\nFranco's 2014 roles included the Seth Rogen comedy Neighbors and a cameo appearance in 22 Jump Street.[25][26] For the former, Franco won an MTV Movie Award for Best On-Screen Duo, alongside Zac Efron.
