        "text": "James Franco was all smiles as he made his red carpet comeback alongside his girlfriend of seven years and actress Isabel Pakzad.\n\nIn 2019, the actor was sued by five students who attended his film school, Studio 4 and was accused of behaving inappropriately.\n\nThe 46-year-old was also alleged to have acted sexually toward them, even forcing one to perform oral sex.\n\nAlthough Franco’s attorney denied the allegations at the time, and eventually he settled the suit, the actor seemingly disappeared from the limelight.\n\nHowever, he made his return to attend the Kind of Kindness premiere in Cannes, France this week.\n\nRead more: Emma Stone dazzles in dramatic plunging gown at star-studded premiere\n\nFranco wore a black suit, with a white shirt and bow tie while actress Pakzad went braless under a plunging black blazer adorned with metal chains.\n\nThe 28-year-old added split-flared trousers and heels to her look as she supported her boyfriend.\n\nAlthough the filmmaker has not worked on a project since the accusations, Franco attended the premiere to promote his new film, The Razor's Edge with director Tommy Lee Jones.\n\nIt will be his first film appearance since The Deuce in 2018, aside from lending his voice in the animated Arctic Dogs which premiered the following year.\n\nDon't miss...\n\nEmma Stone dazzles in dramatic plunging gown at star-studded premiere [LATEST]\n\nMeryl Streep and Jane Fonda lead age-defying stars stealing the show at Cannes [PHOTOS]\n\nTyson Fury vs Oleksandr Usyk - how to watch live, fight and ring walk time [EXPLAINER]\n\nIn 2021, Franco opened up about the allegations in a podcast interview and reiterated his belief that any sexual contact between him and his students had been consensual.\n\n“Over the course of my teaching, I did sleep with students, and that was wrong,” he said.\n\n“I suppose at the time, my thinking was, if it's consensual, OK.”\n\nFranco continued: “At the time, I was not clear-headed. I was in recovery before for substance abuse. There were some issues that I had to deal with that were also related to addiction.\n\n“And so I've really used my recovery background to kind of start examining this and changing who I was.”\n\nFollow Daily Express US\n\nGet all the latest news, entertainment, sport and lifestyle updates from our dedicated American team.\n\nFollow Daily Express US on Facebook and Twitter @ExpressUSNews"
