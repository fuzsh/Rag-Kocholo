        "text": "Smoking and respiratory infections\n\nMany large national and international studies state that there is sufficient evidence that smoking is closely related to various respiratory infections, with a clear dose-response, including acute respiratory tract infection (ARTI) and particularly communityacquired pneumonia (CAP). The pathogens involved in these findings include bacteria, fungi, viruses, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Smoking cessation can reduce the risk of morbidity.\n\nSmoking and CAP\n\nCAP is a common respiratory infection, and pathogens related to CAP include Streptococcus pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and several respiratory viruses, among others. Smoking can substantially increase the morbidity and mortality risk of CAP whereas smoking cessation can reduce the risk of morbidity. Baik et al.69 reported that the risk of CAP in smokers is approximately 1.5 times that of non-smokers (95% CI: 1. 00–2.14), regardless of sex. For male smokers, who smoke more than 25 cigarettes per day, the rate of CAP can increase 2.54 times (95% CI: 1.40–4.59) that of non-smokers. Almirall et al.70 proved that for those who smoked more than 20 cigarettes daily, the risk was increased by 3.89 (95% CI: 1.75–8.64)70. As for older people, the risk of CAP in smokers is 2.3–3.1 times that of non-smokers71,72. Nuorti et al.73 confirmed that smoking is the strongest independent risk factor for invasive pneumococcal disease, and the morbidity of CAP in smokers is 4.1 times that of non-smokers (95% CI: 2.4–7.3). In addition, the CAP risk of passive smokers is 2.5 times that of non-smokers (95% CI: 1.2–5.1). Smoking cessation can reduce the risk of CAP. Compared with individuals who quit smoking for less than 1 year, the risk of CAP has been found to be significantly lower among individuals who had quit smoking for more than 4 years (OR=0.39; 95% CI: 0.17–0.89)74. After 5 years of smoking cessation, the risk of CAP in former smokers is nearly the same as that of non-smokers75.\n\nSmoking and acute respiratory tract infection (ARTI)\n\nGenerally speaking, ARTI is caused by viruses (70– 80%), including rhinovirus, coronavirus, adenovirus, influenza and parainfluenza virus, and respiratory syncytial virus. Another 20–30% of ARTIs can be attributed to bacteria. There is sufficient evidence that smoking increases the risk and recurrence rate of upper respiratory tract infections, whereas smoking cessation can reduce these. Cohen et al.76 showed that the risk of developing a clinical cold in smokers was 2.08 times that of non-smokers (95% CI: 1.18–3.70). Blake et al.77 found that the risk of ARTI among nonsmokers (95% CI: 1.1–1.8) is 1.46 times lower than that of smokers. An et al.78 discovered that in those who smoked on 1–4, 5–10, 11–20, or 21–30 days during the previous 30 days, the prevalence of one or more days of cough or sore throat increased by 5.8%, 9.5%, 8.9%, and 11.0%, respectively. Aronson et al.79 revealed that smokers are more prone to ARTI, with a longer cough duration (8.9 vs 6.8 days) and an increased risk of lower respiratory illnesses (57% vs 45%). Zhou et al.80 reported that passive smokers are 1.59 times more likely to have a cold than non-smokers (95% CI: 1.27–1.99). Guan et al.81 revealed that smoking habits among family members is an independent risk factor for recurrent ARTI in children. Smoking in the mother can cause fetal respiratory movement fatigue in the uterus, impair fetal respiratory function, and reduced respiratory defence function.\n\nSmoking can weaken the potency of influenza vaccines, reducing their protective effect and thereby increasing the morbidity of influenza and hospitalization. Godoy et al.82 discovered that hospitalization among smokers was 1.32 times that of non-smokers (95% CI: 1.04–1.68). Influenza virus subunit vaccines can help to protect smokers from hospitalization at a rate of 21% (95% CI: -2, 39%) whereas non-smokers have a protection rate of 39% (95% CI: 22–52%). Park revealed that there is a low rate of vaccination among ex-smokers (OR=0.734; 95% CI: 0.63–0.854). In addition, smokers have an increased influenza viral load after infection, which aggravates tissue lesions83. Lee et al.84 found that mice exposed to cigarette smoke had faster virus proliferation and higher viral load.\n\nSmoking and COVID-19\n\nThe current COVD-19 pandemic, which is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has caused more than 370000 deaths85. The relationship between smoking and COVID-19 is controversial86. Many studies show that smoking increases the incidence and severity of COVID-19. Smoking upregulates angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the receptor of SARSCoV-2 and SASR-CoV, increasing susceptibility to COVID-19 and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) infection87-91. High expression of ACE2 is also related with cytokine storm and immune system dysfunction, leading to lung injury in both COVID-19 and SARS patients92,93. A community-based cohort study of 387109 adults in the UK illustrated that smoking increases the risk of COVID-19 (RR=1.42; 95% CI: 1.12–1.79)94. Vardavas and Nikitara95 found that smokers were more likely to have more severe symptoms of COVID-19 (RR=1.4; 95% CI: 0.98–2.00) and were more likely to be admitted to the intensive care unit, require mechanical ventilation or die, in comparison with non-smokers (RR=2.4; 95% CI: 1.43–4.04). Liu et al.96 concluded that a history of smoking can lead to the progression of COVID-19 pneumonia (OR=14.285; 95% CI: 1.577– 25.000). Guan et al.97 analyzed the smoking status in 1099 COVID-19 patients, finding that smoking rate in patients with poor outcomes is higher than that without poor outcomes (25.8% vs 11.8%). In addition, males, with high rates of smoking, tend to have more serious complications in SARS and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)98-101. This sex predisposition can be observed in COVID-19, which indirectly suggests the relationship between smoking and COVID-19102.\n\nHowever, there are different views. The prevalence of smoking among people with COVID-19 was about 5.4% (95% CI: 3.5–7.7%)103, and such a low prevalence may not support that smoking increases the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Simon et al.104 found that active smoking was associated with lower odds of having a positive test result, which may be explained by selection bias and affected nasopharyngeal viral load by smoking. A meta-analysis by Lippi105 showed no significant association between active smoking and severity of COVID-19 (OR=1.69; 95% CI: 0.41–6.92; p=0.254). But Guo106 corrected the meta-analysis of Lippi and found that the pooled OR was 2.20 (95% CI: 1.31–3.67; p=0.003) and the latest meta-analysis by Roengrudee107 shows that smoking is a risk of disease progression in COVID-19 (OR=1.91; 95% CI 1.42– 2.59). In conclusion, currently limited epidemiological evidence are insufficient to draw a firm conclusion, but a warning for smoking cessation in the pandemic of COVID-19 is necessary102,108,109.\n\nSmoking and infection with different respiratory pathogens\n\nSmoking increases the risk of influenza infection and hospitalization. Kark et al.110 found that smokers are 1.44 times more likely to have influenza infection than non-smokers (95% CI: 1.03–2.01; incidence rate 60.0% vs 41.6%). Kark et al.111 also demonstrated that smokers are 2.49 times more likely to contract influenza than non-smokers (95% CI: 1.56–3.96; incidence rates 68.5% vs 47.2%). Mustafa et al.112 revealed that the risk of death for active smokers with influenza is 7.08 times greater than that of other groups. A multicenter case-control study of 2554 people aged >65 years in Spain showed that smoking is associated with an increased risk of hospitalization for influenza (OR=1.32; 95% CI: 1.04–1.68). The effectiveness of influenza vaccination for non-smokers is higher than that of smokers (39% vs 21%)82. Heavy smoking history (≥ 20 pack-years) is an independent risk factor for influenza occurrence in hospitalized patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (OR=3.056; 95% CI: 1.072–8.715; p=0.037)113.\n\nSmoking can increase the morbidity of pneumococcal disease. Research by Flory et al.114 showed that the incidence of streptococcus pneumonia in non-smokers is 5.1/100000 (95% CI: 4.2–6.2), and the incidence in smokers is significantly higher at 16.3/100000 (95% CI: 14.6–18.1), the risk ratio of smoking is 2.2 (95% CI: 1.7–3.0), and the attributable risk is 35.6%. A study in Australia also found that smokers are 3.7 times more likely to develop Streptococcus pneumonia than non-smokers115.\n\nSmokers are more likely to develop Legionella pneumonia than non-smokers. Straus et al.116 confirmed that the risk of Legionella pneumonia among smokers is 3.75 times that of non-smokers (95% CI: 2.27–6.17). The greater the daily smoking amount the higher the risk of Legionella pneumonia. Research by Doebbeling et al.117 also showed that smoking is an independent risk factor of Legionella pneumonia.\n\nThe risk of pulmonary fungal disease, such as coccidioidomycosis, cryptococcosis etc., is considerably increased in smokers. In Italy, a study conducted in 33 medical centers revealed that smoking can increase the risk of cryptococcosis among people with and without HIV118. Rosenstein et al.119 found that smoking in the previous 6 months is an independent risk factor of severe coccidioidomycosis, with a ratio of 2.4 (95% CI: 1.1–5.4).\n\nSmoking exposure during pregnancy may cause disease by altering RSV and changing neonatal immune responses, which can increase the risk of respiratory tract infection. Cheemarla et al.120 showed that intrauterine smoke exposure in a mouse model led to increased lung inflammation, with increased neutrophil influx into the airway of infected mice and delayed virus clearing; however, the authors found that RSV-specific CD8+ T cells had a decreased response.\n\nSmoking and tuberculosis infection\n\nBoth active and passive smoking can increase the risk of tuberculosis. The World Health Organization 2007 Global Tuberculosis Report clearly pointed out that smoking is one of the five major risk factors for tuberculosis infection. In 830000 patients newly diagnosed with tuberculosis, the increased risk of contracting the disease is attributed to smoking. The morbidity of tuberculosis in smokers is 1.6–2.5 times that of non-smokers121; a similar conclusion has been reached in several large meta-analyses122-124. Lin et al.125 demonstrated that smokers were 1.94 times more likely to have active tuberculosis than nonsmokers (95% CI: 1.01–3.73). Oztürk et al.126 proved that tobacco abuse (over 20 packs/year) and smoking from a young age (<16 years) is the key factor of active tuberculosis. David et al.127 found that the incidence of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) in non-smokers, previous smokers, and current smokers is 4.1%, 6.2%, and 6.6%, respectively; the risk of LTBI among non-smokers (95% CI: 1.1–2.9) was 1.8 times lower than that of current smokers. Bronner et al.128 conducted a case-control study in 146 patients from South Africa with tuberculosis and HIV coinfection. The authors discovered that the median CD4 cell count of the smoking group was lower (60/mm3 vs 81/mm3) and the median viral load higher (173/μL vs 67/μL) among current and past smokers with HIV, and the risk of tuberculosis in these individuals was 3.2 times (95% CI: 1.3–7.9) and 1.8 times (95% CI: 0.8–4.4) that of non-smokers with HIV.\n\nThere is evidence that smoking can adversely affect the therapeutic efficacy and prognosis of tuberculosis. Leung et al.129 found that current smokers with a history of tuberculosis have a significantly higher risk of tuberculosis recurrence than non-smokers (OR=2.48; 95% CI: 1.04–5.89). Abal et al.130 revealed that the duration of sputum negative conversion among smokers with tuberculosis is significantly prolonged. Tan et al.131 revealed that, with the same treatment, the sputum negative conversion rate among smokers is significantly lower than that of non-smokers. Chuang et al.132 confirmed that smokers have a higher rate of failure in tuberculosis treatment (33%) and a more serious x-ray classification of lung lesions. Smokers require a longer treatment period to convert the sputum culture from positive to negative (HR=1.12; 95% CI: 1.03–1.39). Xiong et al.133 reported that the lesion absorption rate in their non-smoking group (85.7%) was significantly higher than in the smoking group (54.5%). One possible reason for this is that smokers have lower serum albumin levels, which results in a lack of protein to supply lesion repair during treatment and slows sputum negative conversion. A significant increase in the mortality rate among smokers with tuberculosis has been reported. A prospective cohort study of 486341 adults in Taiwan showed that the tuberculosis mortality rate among smokers is 9 times that of non-smokers134. In India, Gajalakshmi et al.135 found that people with a history of smoking are 4.5 times more likely to die from tuberculosis than nonsmokers (RR=4.5; 95% CI: 4.0–5.0; the attribution rate of smoking is 61%).\n\nSmoking and other infections\n\nSkin infections\n\nA retrospective cohort study showed that smoking during pregnancy can increase the incidence of skin infections in those aged <17 years (HR=1.21; 95% CI: 1.13–1.30), especially for children under 1 year of age. Smoke-free pregnancy can reduce the rate of hospitalization for skin infections in children by 9.6%. Smoking during pregnancy may lower the child’s immunity and increase the risk of infection155.\n\nOtitis media\n\nBoth active and passive smoking can cause acute otitis media, recurrent otitis media, and middle ear effusion in children. In 2006, the U.S. Surgeon General’s Report pointed out that children whose parents smoked were 1.0–1.5 times more likely to have acute otitis media than those whose parents did not smoke. The rate of recurrent otitis media in children whose parents smoked was 1.37 times higher than that of children whose parents did not smoke (95% CI: 1.10–1.70). In 2013, a cohort follow-up study in 400 mother-child pairs showed that smoking habits of mother (current habit and former habits; HR=2.00; 95% CI: 1.19–3.36) can cause otitis media in children aged <4 years (HR=1.17; 95% CI: 1.05–1.31)156. Studies have shown that exposure to cigarette smoke among exposure of pregnant women is associated with an increased risk of otitis media in infants. A study of 72 patients with an acute ear infection showed that the risk of acute ear infection in infants is closely related to the daily smoking amount of mother during pregnancy, as follows: 1–9 cigarettes (OR=1.6; 95% CI: 1.1–2.5), 10–19 cigarettes (OR=2.6; 95% CI: 1.6–4.2), more than 20 cigarettes (OR=3.3; 95% CI: 1.9–5.9). The risk of subacute ear infection in infants is also closely related to the mother’s daily smoking amount: 10–19 cigarettes (OR=2.6; 95% CI: 1.4–5.0), and >20 cigarettes (OR=2.8; 95% CI: 1.3–6.0)157.\n\nPeriodontal infections\n\nSmoking can cause an increased rate of periodontal infection. Ojima et al.158 studied the data from two national adult sample surveys (dental disease survey and national nutrition survey) in Japan. They found that the prevalence of periodontitis and other severe periodontal infection in non-smokers, former smokers, and current smokers was 39.3% and 49.5%, 47.3% and 7.9%, 11.7% and 12.4%, respectively. Among people aged >40 years, the risk in current smokers of general periodontitis and more severe periodontal infection was 1.38 times (95% CI: 1.12–1.71) and 1.40 times (95% CI: 1.04–1.89) that of non-smokers, respectively. Tomar et al.159 reported that the rate of periodontitis among current smokers is 3.97 times that of non-smokers (95% CI: 3.20–4.93); as for previous smokers, the rate is 1.68 times that of non-smokers (95% CI: 1.31–2.17). Another study showed that the risk of periodontitis in those who smoke fewer than 9, 10–19, 20, 21–31 and >31 cigarettes per day was 2.79 times (95% CI: 1.90–4.10), 2.96 times (95% CI: 2.12–4.14), 4.72 times (95% CI: 3.46–6.43), 5.10 times (95% CI: 3.48–7.47) and 5.88 times (95% CI: 4.03–8.58) that of non-smokers, respectively. The risk of periodontitis in patients who have quit smoking for <2, 3–5, 6–10, and >11 years is 3.22 times (95% CI: 2.18–4.76), 2.27 times (95% CI: 1.26–4.07), 1.99 times (95% CI: 1.23–3.21) and 1.15 times (95% CI: 0.83–1.60) that of non-smokers, respectively.\n\nSmoking can lead to severe periodontitis and increased periodontal injury. Zhang et al.160 demonstrated that smoking is an independent risk factor for the onset of severe periodontitis in the elderly, and the morbidity of severe periodontitis in smokers is 3.160 times that of non-smokers (95% CI: 1.051–1.310). Kinane et al.161 confirmed that smokers have decreased periodontal pocket depth and adhesion levels than non-smokers after non-surgical or surgical treatment. Zhao et al.162 proved that the proportion of periodontitis is increased in smokers, and the greater the degree of smoking, the deeper the periodontal pockets and the greater the attachment loss.\n\nBacteremia\n\nStudies have shown that the incidence of bacteremia in smokers is significantly increased, which is an important risk factor for poor prognosis and mortality of bacteremia163. In a retrospective analysis of the clinical data of 67 patients in a Spanish hospital with positive blood cultures for Streptococcus pneumoniae from January 1999 to October 2010, investigators found that smoking was the main risk factor for pneumococcal bacteremia164.\n\nHIV Infection\n\nStudies have shown that smokers have a higher rate of HIV infection and morbidity of AIDS. Mdodo et al.165 reported that in patients with HIV, 42.4% (95% CI: 39.7–45.1%) were current cigarette smokers, 20.3% (95% CI: 18.6–22.1%) were former smokers, and 37.3% (95% CI: 34.9–39.6%) had never smoked. A 7.9-year longitudinal study in 924 women with low socioeconomic status found that smokers have a higher risk of developing AIDS (HR=1.36; 95% CI: 1.07–1.72) and a higher mortality rate. Smokers display weak viral immune responses and are more likely to have failure of immunotherapy166.\n\nThere are also increased opportunistic infections and a decreased treatment efficacy among HIVinfected smokers167. Clinical consequences of the cumulative effects of HIV infection and smoking may increase the risk of pneumonia, COPD, cardiovascular disease and non-AIDS cancer among smokers168-174. Cigarette smoking may have a cumulative immunosuppressive effect in HIV patients. Compared with HIV-infected non-smokers, a marked depression in lung CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes and suppressed spontaneous production of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1β and TNF-α can be observed in HIVinfected smokers167,175. Smoking in HIV infected people can lead to impaired function of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and increased intestinal bacterial translocation176. These may explain why smoking can lead to increased opportunistic infections like oral candidiasis, esophageal candidiasis and pneumocystis pneumonia in HIV-positive patients177. In addition, cigarette smoking is associated with decreased efficacy of treatment, resulting in reduced immunological reaction167."
