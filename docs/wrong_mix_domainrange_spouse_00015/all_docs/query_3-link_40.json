        "text": "The holidays are nearly upon us, which means that it's time for young people all over the world to take part in the season's most cherished traditions: spending time with loved ones, feeling thankful for their many blessings, and enduring probing, humiliating questions from their relatives about why they still haven't settled down with a nice special someone yet, dammit. If you are already dreading these interactions and mentally rehearsing your escape route to the nearest dive bar, perhaps it will be comforting to know that famous people are not even a little bit immune to this phenomenon. During his Thursday appearance on Stephen Colbert's Late Show, James Franco explained how his two younger brothers are doing him no favors in the Christmas dinner conversation arena:\n\nFRANCO, SHEEPISHLY: My brothers are both in very serious relationships. Davie, the youngest, is engaged, and is going to get married early next year, and Tom's in a serious relationship. But I'm not. So I'll be going back, and they'll be with their girlfriends—\n\nCOLBERT, IN A TONE THAT CONVEYS \"I'M HERE IF YOU NEED A HUG\": Is there pressure for you there? Do they look at you and say, \"Hey man, I know you're the oldest, but it's time for you to grow up,\" or anything like that?\n\nFRANCO, HEARTACHE ETCHED ON HIS FACE: Yeah, well, Tom's girlfriend, Iris, is from Mexico, and she says that there's a saying there that if the younger brothers or the younger siblings get married before the oldest, then the oldest never gets married.\n\nCOLBERT, IN A HUSHED VOICE USUALLY RESERVED FOR FUNERALS: Wow, wow.\n\nFRANCO, SUDDENLY PAINFULLY AWARE OF HIS OWN MORTALITY: I know. I got, like, two months!\n\nMan, we feel you, James. The holidays are already a minefield of grappling with unfulfilled family expectations. This year, Franco has to deal not only with his youngest sibling preparing to tie the knot, but also with the realization that if he doesn't somehow manage to beat his little brother to the altar, he might be stuck as a bachelor for life."
