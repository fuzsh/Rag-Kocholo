Jun Hyoseong (Hangul:전효성; Hanja: 全烋星; born October 13, 1989) often simply known as Hyoseong or Hyosung, is a South Korean idol singer and dancer. She is best known as being the leader, main dancer and lead vocalist of a popular South Korean girl group, Secret.

In 2005 she became a finalist on Mnet's "Battle Shinhwa" which led to her signing a recording contract with Good Entertainment. In 2007 she was to debut in the group 'Five Girls' along with G.NA, Wonder Girls's Yubin, After School's UEE and a former T-ara member and current Spica member Yang Jiwon. However, the group disbanded before they were able to debut due to the company's financial problems. Hyoseong was later discovered by TS Entertainment through a show that was aired on SBS MTV, called "Diary of Five Girls" and spent two years in the company as a trainee. In 2009 she debuted in a four member girl group called Secret along with Song Jieun, Han Sunhwa and Jung Hana.
