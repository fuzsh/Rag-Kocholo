        "text": "Bio\n\nAverage Age: 25\n\nAverage Height: 161cm or 5’3″\n\nAverage Weight: 45kg or 99lbs\n\nAverage BMI: 17.2\n\nSecret is also known for their transitions to cute and the girl-next-door image through songs like “Shy Boy” and “Starlight Moonlight” from the sexy and powerful image through “Magic”, “Madonna” and “Poison” while still retaining retro as the main theme for their sound. Although a commercial success with “Magic” and “Madonna” peaking at number two and number one respectively on the Gaon Charts, Secret failed to win a first place award on any televised South Korean weekly music shows such as M! Countdown, Music Bank and Inkigayo until “Shy Boy”. Seoulbeats wrote, “Secret embarked on an aegyo phase in their following release of “Shy Boy” although with much voiced displeasure from the members. Despite the radical change in their personalities, their style remained consistent in staying with and expanding upon their retro identity. The song became a major success as Secret traded in their sex appeal for a heavy dose of aegyo, resulting in much hardware for their chart-topping song.” Secret kept its cute imagery with their following single “Starlight Moonlight” until the release of “Love is Move” and “Poison”. During their promotions with “Poison”, Jun Hyoseong commented “Secret has always been known as a cute group that appeals to the general public. This time, however, we′ve escaped that and showed off our unique charms. Our visuals have also changed for the sexy.”Jun added, “We′re actually closer to Shy Boy in real life.”\n\nPersonal Favorite Song: YooHoo\n\n/// SECRET ||| SECRET \\\\\\\n\nHyosung (효성)\n\nBirth Date: 13 October 1989 (age 25)\n\nBirth Name: Jeon Hyo-Sung (전효성)\n\nHeight: 160cm or 5’2″\n\nWeight: 45kg or 99lbs\n\nBMI: 17.6\n\nJun Hyoseong was born in Cheongju, Chungcheongbuk-do, South Korea on October 13, 1989.
