        "text": "Jun Hyo-seong named PR ambassador for Hanbok\n\nK-pop singer and actor Jun Hyo-seong on July 28 was named PR ambassador for Hanbok (traditional clothing) this year by the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism and the Korea Craft & Design Foundation.\n\nJun’s fondness for Hanbok is well known through photos of her outfits she wears daily posted on her social media accounts. On March 1, she was featured in a billboard advertisement at New York’s Times Square to promote the beauty of Hanbok. Thanks to the ad, she received a letter of appreciation from the ministry.\n\nMinister of Culture, Sports and Tourism Hwang Hee said, “To introduce the beauty and charm of Hanbok, we chose Jun as PR ambassador since she has consistently shown her love for Hanbok.”\n\n“Through Jun Hyo-seong’s efforts, we hope to spread the perception of Hanbok as clothing that can be worn daily at any time instead of just on special occasions.”\n\nFormerly a member of the K-pop girl group Secret, Jun later turned to acting and appeared in dramas on TV and the web such as “Memorist” (2020) and “Green in My Heart” (2019)."
