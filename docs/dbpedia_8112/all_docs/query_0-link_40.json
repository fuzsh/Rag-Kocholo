Hyoseong’s lawyer stated “First, there are payments that Jun Hyo-seong has not received. TS Entertainment also transferred the management rights conferred by its exclusive contract with the singer to another party without the consent of Jun Hyoseong herself.\n\nNot only is this a clear violation of her contract, but it is also a source of instability in her promotions as a singer.” He also stated that it would be unlikely of Hyoseong to remain a member of Secret while under TS Entertainment given the situation and the lack of trust and communication between the agency and Hyoseong, effectively ending the group.\n\nLet’s meet the members!\n\nStage Name: Hyosung (효성)\n\nReal Name: Jeon Hyo Sung (전효성)\n\nPosition: Leader, Main Dancer, Lead Vocalist, Face of the Group\n\nBirthday: October 13th, 1989\n\nZodiac: Libra\n\nHeight: 5’3\n\nInstagram: @superstar_jhs\n\nTwitter: @Secretimehs\n\nFacts\n\n– She was born in Chungcheongbuk-do, South Korea.\n\n– She has a younger sister and an older sister.\n\n– As a 3rd grader, Hyosung and her family started delivering newspapers to get extra money.\n\n– In 6th grade, Hyosung decided she wanted to become a singer.\n\n– In middle school, she was the leader of her school’s dance team.\n\n– In 2007, she was supposed to debut with G.NA, Yubin (Wonder Girls), UEE (After School), and Jiwon (SPICA) as girl group Five Girls but they disbanded pre-debut.\n\n– She’s a member of the one time sub unit Dazzling RED with 4Minute’s Hyuna, KARA’s Nicole, After School’s Nana, & SISTAR’s Hyorin.\n\n– On February 28th, 2018, it was reported that Hyoseong was in legal disputes with her agency TS Entertainment.\n\n– The court decided that the exclusive contract between Hyoseong and TS Ent holds no validity.\n\n– On October 29th, 2018 it was announced that Hyoseong signed with Tommy & Partners Entertainment.\n\nStage Name: Hana (하나)\n\nReal Name: Jung Ha Na (정하나)\n\nPosition: Main Rapper, Lead Dancer, Vocalist\n\nBirthday: February 2nd, 1990\n\nZodiac: Aquarius\n\nHeight: 5’2\n\nTwitter: @supahana\n\nInstagram: @hanatheonly1\n\nTwitch: @poodlequeenj\n\nYoutube: HANA [오늘은 뭐하나?]\n\nFacts\n\n– She was born in Uijeongbu, Gyeonggi, South Korea.\n\n– She is an only child.\n\n– Her mother worked as a singer in the 1980s and her father worked as a bodyguard.\n\n– Her former stage name is Zinger.\n\n– She is close to EXID‘s LE.\n\n– She is also friends with 2NE1‘s CL and Wonder Girls‘ Sun while attending the same dance academy in middle school.\n\n– She acted in the drama “Jumping Girl” (2015).\n\n– Hana participated on “The King of Masked Singer” in May 2019.\n\n– She is the only Secret member who remained under TS Ent.\n\nStage Name: Jieun (지은)\n\nReal Name: Song Ji Eun (송지은)\n\nPosition: Main Vocalist, Maknae\n\nBirthday: May 5th, 1990\n\nZodiac: Taurus\n\nHeight: 5’3\n\nTwitter: @songjieun_55\n\nInstagram: @bimil_jieun\n\nYoutube: 뽀송지은[For SongJiEun]\n\nFacts\n\n– She was born in Seoul, South Korea.\n\n– She is an only child.\n\n– She auditioned for JYP at a young age and was supposed to debut with Hyorin (SISTAR) and U-JI (BESTie) but plans did not go well.\n\n– She acted on the Korean dramas: “Family” (2012, cameo), “Pure Love” (2013), “Longing for Spring” (2014), “The Superman Age” (2015), “Sweet Home, Sweet Honey” (2016), “My Secret Romance” (2017), “Melting Me Softly” (guest – 2019), “Wish Woosh 2” (2019).\n\n– On February 28th, 2018, Ji Eun has announced her departure from Secret on her Instagram.\n\n– On June 22nd, 2019 it was announced that Jieun signed with 6 Oceans.\n\nStage Name: Sunhwa (선화)\n\nReal Name: Han Sun Hwa (한선화)\n\nPosition: Vocalist, Visual, Maknae\n\nBirthday: October 6th, 1990\n\nZodiac: Libra\n\nHeight: 5’5\n\nTwitter: @seonhwazzz\n\nInstagram: @shh_daily\n\nFacts\n\n– She was born in Busan, South Korea.\n\n– She is the oldest in her family and had to tutor her younger siblings (a sister and a brother) when her parents worked.\n\n–Victon‘s Han Seungwoo is her younger brother.\n\n– When she was young she wanted to be an artist.\n\n– In 6th grade she watched a performance of BoA and immediately wanted to be a singer.\n\n– Her mother was only 20 when she had Sunhwa.\n\n– In 2012 she was paired with Kwanghee of ZE:A to be her husband on the TV show “We Got Married“.\n\n– She’s a member of the one-time sub unit Mystic WHITE with 4Minute’s Gayoon, KARA’s Jiyoung, After School’s Lizzy, & SISTAR’s Bora.\n\n– She acted in several Korean dramas: “Ad Genius Lee Tae-Baek” (2013), “God’s Gift – 14 Days” (2014), “Marriage Not Dating” (2014), “Rosy Lovers” (2015), “Radiant Office” (2017), “School 2017” (2017), “20th Century Boy and Girl” (2017), “My Husband Oh Jak Doo” (2018), “The Great Seducer” (guest – 2018), “Save Me 2” (2019), “Backstreet Rookie” (2020), “Undercover” (2021).\n\n– On September 25th, 2016, TS Ent. announced Sunhwa’s departure from the group.\n\n– On March 13th, 2020, it was announced that Sunhwa has signed an exclusive contract with KeyEast Entertainment.\n\nThanks for reading, I hope you enjoyed learning about Secret!
