        "text": "Jun Hyosung will be making her big screen debut!\n\nOn August 8, the production team of “Bound to be a Devil” (literal title) announced the casting of Jun Hyosung as the lead.\n\n“Bound to be a Devil” is based on a shocking true crime that occurred in May 2022 when a man in his 30s, known as A, brutally attacked a stranger, B, at the entrance of her apartment in Busan. The crime sparked public outrage after CCTV footage revealed A following, kicking, and dragging the victim’s body into a blind spot.\n\nJun Hyosung will taken on the role of victim Min Ah, whose life is completely shattered after being assaulted by a stranger she had never met before. Consumed by anxiety and fear that her attacker might come back for revenge, she experiences profound internal changes every day.\n\n“Bound to be a Devil” is expected to delve into the broader issues of random assaults and societal retaliation in Korea, incorporating elements from the Busan incident. Notably, the real-life victim has been involved as a consultant for the film’s script. The film will also mark Jun Hyosung’s first leading role in a film since debuting as a member of the girl group SECRET in 2009.\n\n“Bound to be a Devil” is scheduled to start filming in mid-August and aims for a 2025 release.\n\nWhile waiting for updates, check out Jun Hyosung in “Memorist” below:\n\nWatch Now\n\nSource (1)\n\nWhat are Cookies?\n\nWhen you visit any web site, it may store or retrieve information on your browser, mostly in the form of cookies.
