        "text": "3 photos\n\nPhoto: Geek\n\nThe August issue of Geek magazine will have South Korean Secret’s lead vocalist Jun Hyoseong on the cover. The 24-year artist is riding an Indian motorcycle while wearing sported black leather and mesh outfits.\n\nJun Hyoseong, best known as Hyoseong, is a South Korean idol singer and dancer. She is best known as being the leader, main dancer and lead vocalist of a popular South Korean girl group, Secret. Hyoseong turned her hotness button on in the photo shoot for the August issue of Geek magazine.\n\nAs far as we can tell, the Korean artist is riding an Indian Chief Classic, which is considered the pinnacle of American motorcycle beauty. And what a ride this baby is. Sculpted with mastery, it’s a powerful cruiser built with the purest necessities of Indian style.\n\nIts Thunder Stroke 111 engine delivers an impressive 119 lb-ft of torque and feature styling that pays tribute to legendary Indian Motorcycle engines of the past. Virtually every surface that could be chromed has been, from end to end, the beautiful, bright finish elevates the iconic style of this classic American two-wheeler.\n\nStandard equipment features ABS, cast aluminum frame with integrated Air-Box, Cruise Control, Keyless Start, Light Bar, and premium leather seats. Wrapped around the innovation of tomorrow, this ride looks even better having Hyoseong riding it, and you’ll have to agree with this one."
