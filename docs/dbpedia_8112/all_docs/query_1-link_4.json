        "text": "Back in 2021, second-generation K-Pop girl group SECRET member Jun Hyosung (also known as Jun Hyoseong) participated in a campaign led by the South Korean Ministry of Gender Equality and Family called “Hope Painting.”\n\nThe campaign, intended to raise awareness and call for the prevention of “gender-based violence,” interviewed 35 professionals—including celebrities—to share their thoughts on the different kinds of gender-based violence.\n\nIn her interview, Hyosung spoke against “dating violence.”\n\nThe term ‘dating violence’ means violence committed by a person who is or has been in a social relationship of a romantic or intimate nature with the victim and where the existence of such a relationship shall be determined based on a consideration of the following factors: the length of the relationship; the type of relationship; and the frequency of interaction between the persons involved in the relationship.\n\n— U.S. Department of Justice, Office of Violence Against Women\n\nHyosung commented that it’s critical for dating violence to be more recognized as an actual act of violence and for victims of dating violence to no longer feel like the “cause is with them and not the perpetrators.”\n\nI don’t think we understand the differences between what’s love and what’s violence. I was no different. The boundaries aren’t clear, so it came across as vague. I believe it’s one of the most confusing concepts that we struggle to grasp. But I learned that dating violence is a legitimate crime.\n\nBecause there’s such a lack of understanding, we tend to be lenient about the crime that is dating violence. This needs to stop because it leads to the victims finding faults within themselves. Dating violence is a crime and the cause is with the one who commits the crime. There’s no reason for victims to endure notions like, ‘You also contributed to the reason.’ It’s wrong.\n\n— Jun Hyosung\n\nHyosung concluded the interview hoping for a “safe Korea” where she and other Koreans could return home each night without having to be concerned about falling victim to violence.\n\nWhen night falls, I am afraid on my way home. I think, ‘Will I be able to make it home alive?’ And we ask each other all the time, ‘Hey, did you get home safely?’ But I actually don’t think it’s normal to be asking that. We just accepted it as normal.\n\n— Jun Hyosung\n\nFollowing the interview, Hyosung received mixed reactions. Female supporters found her interview to be inspiring, while some male viewers found her insight to be “hateful toward men.” Such men have gone as far to label her as an “anti-men feminist* (Far-right, misogynistic, anti-feminist, ilbe and ilbe-adjacent Korean men started using ‘feminist’ as a derogatory term)” and remained hostile toward the idol since.\n\nInside “Ilbe”: What Exactly Is This Korean Website And Why Has It Become So Problematic?\n\nThen, on July 1, Hyosung uploaded a behind-the-scenes video via her YouTube channel for her latest Netflix K-Drama, Celebrity. The video celebrated the show’s release, except it ended up receiving the attention of some men—the same ones who hold grudge about her “feminist” ideals. These men began cyber-bullying her in the comments section—bringing up the campaign video and mocking her for her past remarks.\n\n“You must have been terrified of the night. Was shooting on set and coming home from it OK?”\n\n[Jun Hyosung’s Response]\n\n“Love how she ‘uh-huh’ed this comment because it pissed her off. Doesn’t want to lose, ever. Huh? I feel bad for her. LMAO.”\n\n“HAHA. This is f*cking hilarious.”\n\n“Pissed her off alright. LOL.”\n\n“Nice.”\n\n“So cool.”\n\n“Stop pretending you don’t care. We know this pisses you off.”\n\n“LMAO.”\n\n“You don’t seem that scared to be out in the dark, though. What happened?”\n\n“I wonder if she ever regrets what she said…”\n\n“Don’t be a b*tch. LOL.”\n\n“HAHAHA.”\n\n“Aww. You go, miss superstar.”\n\nWhile Hyosung responded to such comments with class and sass…\n\nUh-huh.\n\n— Jun Hyosung\n\n…Korean women came together with much more frustrated reactions. When a screenshot of the malicious comments began circulating, different online communities saw an influx of responses from female users.\n\n“Ew… These comments all got 800+ likes. I can’t believe it.”\n\n“What’s wrong with them? So pathetic.”\n\n“Countless women fall victim each night, though. It sickens me to see men still mocking her like that.”\n\n“I feel bad for them now. So desperate.”\n\n“Leave her alone, for f*ck’s sake. I’m going to root for her. Her new K-Drama is good! She’s great at acting her part!”\n\n“Pathetic.”\n\n“But… regardless of gender, isn’t it recommended for all of us to be a little more aware and careful at night? I’m so confused.”\n\n“SO pathetic.”\n\n“These comments are proof that she was right in that video.”\n\n“How come these men are taking her fear of walking alone at night as a threat to themselves? LMAO. Have these men all be out and about at night, targeting women? Is that the reason? I don’t even understand the logic behind their rage.”\n\n“Um… Don’t men, too, get scared of super dark streets and stuff? I don’t get what’s so infuriating about her remark.”\n\n“I can’t believe how pathetic those comments sound. What makes them so mad? Is it because they know what they’ve been doing?”\n\n“I’m sorry. When women fall victim to violence at night, you blame it on us and say we should’ve stayed home. But you also don’t like it when women say we stay home because we’re scared to be outside at night…? Like, WTF do you want?”\n\n“What’s wrong with those losers?”\n\nHyosung’s fans are since working together to flush out the negativity with comments that are related to her work. Hyosung herself also has not interacted with the “trolls,” diminishing the situation.\n\nRegardless, both videos continue to see Korea’s most pressing social issue of “Gender War” in action."
