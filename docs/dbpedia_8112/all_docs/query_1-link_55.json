        "text": "If you’re a normal person, you likely either completely forgot about Hyosung’s “controversy” from 2021 or remember fondly that she spoke up about a social issue in Korea (and everywhere, really). The crux of it was essentially that she said dating violence is bad and sometimes she’s afraid to walk home at night alone, so society would be better if people didn’t have to be scared of things like that. Yeah, that’s about it.\n\nSomehow this made the incel population of Korean’s way-too-online denizens extremely mad, leading to her being put on the posters of anti-feminists in parades and all kinds of vile shit. And here we are two years later, and they’re still lurking in the YouTube comments of her recent behind-the-scenes vlog for her new Netflix drama Celebrity on YouTube.\n\nOne of them left a comment mocking what she spoke out about, saying, “You must’ve been scared at night, were you okay shooting and leaving?” Hyosung responded to that by basically dismissing it, saying “Uh-huh.“, and that set off a bigger mess in the replies.\n\nYeah.\n\n> Looks like you were freaking pissed off with only leaving a “ㅇㅇ” reply. You’re pitiful with how much you hate to lose. ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ\n\n> ㅋㅋㅋㅋ Fucking hilarious. ㅋㅋㅋㅋ\n\n> Are you tilted? ㅋㅋㅋ\n\n> Kyah!\n\n> You’re so cool~ (T/N: Sarcastic)\n\n> You said it with your own mouth that you were scared. Someone is being worried about you and you can’t even pretend to be a bit nicer with your reply?\n\n> She’s so pissed off but she’s pretending to be cool about it. ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ\n\n> ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ\n\n> You don’t look like you’re even scared at all? What happened?\n\n> Honestly don’t you regret what you said?\n\n> That attitude. ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ\n\n> ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ\n\n> Superstar-nim ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ Fighting~\n\nIt’s pointless to think about all this reasonably as they’re clearly far beyond that at this point, but yes, they’re acting like they’re victimized by Hyosung saying she feels unsafe at night. They’re mocking her for dismissing them like that while she’s been living in their heads rent-free for two years, so if we’re speaking on being triggered I can’t think of a better definition than that. These types of dudes are ironically exactly why she would say something like that about feeling unsafe, it’s literally deranged behavior.\n\nAnyway, thankfully others caught wind of this and seem to have flooded out everybody else with supportive comments for her.\n\nAlso, she’s quite impressive in Celebrity from what I’ve seen so far."
