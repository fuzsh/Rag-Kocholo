        "text": "Interview by Molly Louise Hudelson.\n\nBack in 2012, former My Chemical Romance rhythm guitarist and backing vocalist Frank Iero began writing a series of songs that would eventually become the aptly named Stomachaches (released August 25 via Staple Records). The album itself is weighty, heavy in the sense that the aches he was feeling- both physical, in his digestive system, and emotional, for love and acceptance- are palpable.\n\nAfter a secret show at Bowery Electric in New York City and a release day performance and signing at Vintage Vinyl in Fords, New Jersey last month, frnkiero and the cellabration began their very first tour at GameChanger World in Howell, New Jersey on Saturday night. In addition to several headlining shows and performances at Riot Fest in Chicago and Denver, they’ll be joining up with MCR’s old tourmates Taking Back Sunday and The Used.\n\nWhen I arrived at the venue early to meet up with Frank for an interview, fans had already lined up outside, excited for the show. As he counted and sorted merch, Frank talked about Stomachaches, the beginning of making music as frnkiero and the cellabration, and more. Read on for the full interview!\n\nCIRCLES AND SOUNDWAVES: For the record, could you state your name and a random fact about yourself?\n\nFrank Iero: My name is Frank Iero and I hate mushrooms.\n\nC&S: What is your least favorite mushroom?\n\nFrank: All mushrooms. No matter how they’re prepared, I feel like they’re all slimy and they taste like dirt.\n\nC&S: You released your record Stomachaches about a week and a half ago; how do you feel having it out so far?\n\nFrank: It’s pretty amazing because when making it, I didn’t ever really think about releasing it. It was kinda just like- I wanna make these songs.\n\nC&S: Right- it was recorded in your basement originally.\n\nFrank: Yeah, for the most part. I was just making these songs for myself. There was a moment where I felt like that was it- I was done. I [couldn’t] imagine feeling this bad and getting through.\n\nC&S: Feeling that bad physically?\n\nFrank: Yeah, this stuff with my stomach started to happen and I got this facial twitch and my head started to hurt; it was ridiculous. I’m sure most of it was in my head, too.\n\nC&S: At what point did you decide, “Okay, I’m going to take this and actually release it”?\n\nFrank: I didn’t think it. I played it for some friends of mine because they asked, “Hey, what have you been doing? Are you still making music?” I was like, “I’ve been writing these songs; I don’t really know what they are for.” He asked if I was starting a new band and I said, “I don’t think so.” They asked if they could hear it; I played it for them and they said, “Can I play this for somebody else? I think it’s really good.” I was like, “I’d rather you didn’t, but you know, maybe- okay.”\n\nHere’s the thing- I feel like you have to make art because you have to make it. But the end result of it- that last stage- you have to show it to somebody else to hopefully get a rise or reaction out of them- [to see] if it’ll affect someone else.\n\nC&S: So part of what art is, is how it affects other people?\n\nFrank: I think so. You can only hold on to something for so long and enjoy it just by yourself… what’s the point? It’s very selfish. For better or for worse, I feel like the point of all of this is to make someone feel something.\n\nC&S: So far, do you feel like you’ve been successful in making people feel something with it?\n\nFrank: I hope so. I feel like that’s subjective and I feel like it’s person-to-person. I don’t know if I’ll ever gain benefit from that, but I feel like I already got my benefit out of it- I made it. It came to fruition; that was really all I could ever ask for. The rest of it? I don’t know, man.\n\nC&S: Do you see yourself continuing to make records with frnkiero and the cellabration, or are you really not sure yet?\n\nFrank: Hm, you know what- here’s the thing. I feel like I’m definitely going to continue to make music. Is all of that music just going to be me and an acoustic guitar? Probably not. That’s really why I started this, because I wanted to signify that it wasn’t just me.\n\nC&S: Although on the record, you played everything but drums.\n\nFrank: Yeah. I played drums on one or two songs. But I wanted a band- something to signify the accompany musicians, that wanted to tour with it.\n\nC&S: Like Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers.\n\nFrank: Right, or Joan Jett and the Blackhearts. That was my homage to that. So will this continue? I feel strongly that it will. I can’t stop. I don’t know- I could die tomorrow. You never know.\n\nC&S: Well hopefully not, because in a couple days you’re meeting up to tour with The Used and Taking Back Sunday, both of which are bands that My Chemical Romance had toured with year ago. Because of that, do you feel like there’s any kind of expectation for the tour, or do you feel like you have the freedom to do this completely new project?\n\nFrank: I feel like there’s a big benefit to do this. This is the first time these songs have ever really come to life other than just being played by myself in my room. To do that amongst old friends- people that you’ve known for awhile and respect- it's…\n\nC&S: Comfortable?\n\nFrank: Maybe? [Laughs.] But I don’t know yet, because it could be real awkward.\n\nC&S: A big theme of the record is this search for love and acceptance and realizing that maybe there’s not a specific place where you belong; do you feel that that’s something that relates to your journey as a musician?\n\nFrank: It’s such a broad search. Even as a kid- do all kids think about this? I hope they don’t, I hope my kids don’t think about this- I was always thinking about, “Well, what are we doing? What is this all about?”\n\nAgain- why is it so important to me? Is it just because I’ve grown into it or was born into it or because it’s such a universal thing? There’s something very magical about music, and the way it makes you feel if you really love it.\n\nThe answer to your question is yes. But I don’t think it’s specific to just my music career- it’s me, as a whole.\n\nC&S: This is the first time that you’ll be performing as a lead vocalist and front man; what has that transition been like for you?\n\nFrank: It sucks! [Laughs.]\n\nC&S: What’s tough about it?\n\nFrank: Everything. It’s way more vulnerable than I ever wanted to be in front of people.\n\nC&S: When you realized you were going to release these songs and start performing, did you decide immediately that you were going to sing them, or was there ever a point where you were wondering who you were going to get to sing them?\n\nFrank: There’s lots of bands out there where somebody will write lyrics and somebody else will sing them. It works for a lot of people, but that feels weird to me. I don’t mean this in a bad way at all but it just feels fake.\n\nGrowing up I loved Less Than Jake. They’re a great band. I found out that the drummer, Vinnie, wrote the lyrics and I don’t know why but it kind of bummed me out. I guess in my heart of hearts, whether the person has a good voice or not I want [the songs] to come from them. I don’t know why. I have no good answer for that. I wish it didn’t have to be that way.\n\nC&S: You have this reoccurring anchor logo- what are the origins of it?\n\nFrank: It started in 2006. I was making this art project and messing around with the art of tarot cards and teaching myself Photoshop a little bit. I wanted to make a signature for myself and in doing that, I started to take images of the Byzantine cross. I wanted it to show the push and pull of good and evil- almost like a yin and yang, but not. I wanted it to [express] this sentiment of trying to be a good person in a bad person’s body.\n\nSo I made it, and I actually pitched it and was like, “Oh, maybe I should use it for the band.” But I liked it too much and I kept it. So I would put it on different art things that I did but I didn’t release much until I started to do these photo prints in 2010, maybe- and if you look, the embossing on all of those photo prints is that cross. These are cobras, so that’s what that is- the good and evil.\n\nC&S: In the middle of the Taking Back Sunday and The Used tour you’re doing Riot Fest; you’ll be on the road for about a month straight. What else do you have planned for the rest of 2014?\n\nFrank: We’re going to the UK in November. We have a couple of one-offs here and there that haven’t been announced yet and then we’re trying to do a headlining tour early next year. It’s gonna be a rough ride, I think, but it’s gonna be really fun. But one thing at a time.\n\nC&S: How do you respond to haters or anyone who doubts you as a musician?\n\nFrank: I don’t. I don’t have the time, I’m sorry! [Laughs.] There are so many things that are important, and it was a big thing with my dad being very sick. Having kids had a big effect on me, but nothing more than when they started to get older- that really made me realize how fleeting each moment is.\n\nAnd I don’t have the time for it, really. There’s so many things that I care about wholeheartedly.\n\nC&S: It seems like you have a good attitude with that.\n\nFrank: Or I’m just too busy!\n\nC&S: Thank you so much- anything else you want to say or anything else I should know?\n\nFrank: No, thank you so much- I had a good time."
