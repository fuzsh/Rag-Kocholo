        "text": "The new era of My Chemical Romance is here\n\nMy Chemical Romance have shared their first photo together since their surprise reunion on Halloween (31st October).\n\nThe band posted a black-and-white image on Instagram over the weekend of Gerard Way, Mikey Way, Ray Toro and Frank Iero and sat together on the floor of a rehearsal space while they prepare for their comeback gig in Los Angeles. It’s simply captioned ‘11.15.19’.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the post was met with widespread adulation from My Chemical Romance’s legions of fans and it’s been liked more than 332,000 times.\n\nIt’s the first time the quartet have been photographed together since they all attended Frank Iero’s 500-capacity gig at the Troubadour venue in May 2017.\n\nThe series of photos posted on social media two-and-a-half years ago sent their fans into meltdown and depicted the band laughing and hugging each other after the show, before they left in the same car.\n\nMy Chemical Romance officially confirmed their reformation after six-and-a-half long years away on 31st October when they announced a reunion show at the Shrine Expo Hall in Los Angeles on Friday 20th December.\n\nConfirming their return, MCR shared a black-and-white image of two sculptures intertwined and emblazoned with the word ‘Return’. They captioned the photo: “Like Phantoms Forever…”\n\nUnsurprisingly, the Los Angeles gig sold out in nanoseconds and the following week, My Chemical Romance announced additional shows in Australia, New Zealand and Japan.\n\nFingers and toes crossed some UK dates are announced very soon!\n\nMy Chemical Romance in their imperious live glory:\n\nMy Chemical Romance’s upcoming shows are as follows:\n\nDECEMBER 2020\n\nLos Angeles Shrine Expo Hall – Fri 20th – SOLD OUT\n\nMARCH 2020\n\nMelbourne, Download Festival Australia – Fri 20th\n\nSydney, Download Festival Australia – Sat 21st\n\nNew Zealand, The Outer Fields at Western Springs – Wed 25th\n\nMakuhari Messe, Download Festival Japan – Sun 29th"
