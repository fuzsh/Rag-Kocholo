        "text": "Frank Iero never wanted to make a solo record. The former My Chemical Romance guitarist has a history of intense digestive issues, and when that band officially dissolved in 2013, he began retreating into his home studio to churn out the raw, angst-ridden tracks that make up the aptly-named Stomaches LP (Staple Records), his debut as FrnkIero andthe Cellabration. Named after Iero’s admitted tendency towards typos, as well as a homage to the great backing band names of the past (The Heartbreakers and The Blackhearts), FrnkIero andthe Cellabration channels the low-fi energy of Iero’s New Jersey punk and hardcore past, coupled with the monster hooks that My Chemical Romance trafficked in so well.\n\nI caught up with Iero by e-mail to discuss the difficult writing and recording process behind Stomachaches, his thoughts on solo acts, and the lost art of the mix-tape. FrnkIero andthe Cellabration are on tour now, which includes a Montreal stop at Bar le Ritz PDB on February 24th. Tickets for that show are available here.\n\nWas it always your intention to release a solo record following the break-up of My Chemical Romance?\n\nNo, most definitely not. To be honest, I tend to hate when people come from a band and then go ‘solo’. It seems so cliché and douchey. Like, you couldn’t wait to see your name in lights type thing ha. Maybe subconsciously that’s why I misspell my name. Anyway, I found myself in a situation where I wrote a bunch music by myself and I wanted to play it live and put out a record. So I had 3 options:\n\nPut a bunch of people together and pretend we were a band from the start\n\nCome up with a pseudonym for myself, which is strange because if I was going to do that I should have done it years ago, or\n\nJust cut the shit and go ‘solo’.\n\nI went with #3.\n\nWhat is the significance of the band name? Were you wary of the “solo punk” tag?\n\nI don’t really know what the ‘solo punk’ tag is, but I suppose I was wary of any kind of solo comparisons. Like I said, I’ve always thought of that as a dumb move, so I guess that’s why I made it so difficult for myself with the name. Maybe I was just making fun of the whole thing. Also, I have a hard time typing for some reason, and sometimes letters get left out. Calling the band the CELLABRATION though, that was very calculated. I really wanted to name the band, something like the greats did. Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, Joan Jett and the Blackhearts, etc. etc. CELLABRATION, because the definition of celebration just spoke to me. I also thought it sounded non genre-specific, and that really appealed to me.\n\nWhat was the recording process like for the record?\n\nIt was quite lonely at times, but really fulfilling. I did most of it in my basement at my own pace. Live drums and some bass tracking were done at Northend studios with my good friend Ed Auletta engineering. And then we did my brother Evan’s vocals at Backroom studios with a very talented engineer, Kevin Antreassian. But for the most part, it was just me locked in a room fleshing out songs in my pyjamas.\n\nWas this the first time you channeled your stomach pain into something creative?\n\nI’d say it’s probably the biggest piece of work that came out of it. This record was definitely not supposed to be a record for public consumption though. This record was just my own personal treatment that ended up getting released.\n\nWere you surprised at how much you accomplished while being in such physical pain?\n\nThere was an element of shock when I looked back one day and realized there was an album’s worth of material. It’s like running as fast as you can for as long as you can, and finally taking a rest to catch your breath and you can hardly see your starting point anymore. It’s nice to surprise yourself like that sometimes.\n\nYou posted the lyrics to the album on your website before its release, was it important for you for fans to know what to expect from the album?\n\nYes. When I finally did decide to release the record, I wanted people to know what I was saying. It was the most important part. There’s no feeling quite like having people sing your lyrics with you, especially when they sing from their hearts.\n\nContinued on page 2."
