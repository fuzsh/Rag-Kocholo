        "text": "Remember My Chemical Romance? For most people my age, My Chem‚Äôs emotional hardcore (like any true fan, I‚Äôll never call it emo) provided the despairing soundtrack for the inevitable break down of our first poorly matched six-month relationships, their stone-cold images glared back from bedroom murals via Kerrang! posters. If you‚Äôre anything like me, you spent three years carefully recreating their glue-sniffer style pink eyes with a Collection 2000 colour palette and bawling ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Not Okay‚Äù into a pillow until you got a headache and a snotty face.\n\nWhile Gerard Way was the scene poster boy of the band, Frank Iero, the guitarist, was the punk guy in the background: the nervous, smiley one everyone fancied, who played on the wings, feeling a bit uncomfortable.\n\nMy Chem‚Äôs split last year could have spelt the end for the non-Gerard members, but Frank is something of a creative genius. He‚Äôs frontman of hardcore punk band, LeATHERMOUTH and in electro-hardcore band, Death Spells. He also dabbles in writing, art and photography (he‚Äôs always suffered from anxiety, as well as chronic stomach pains, and uses art as a release). Now he‚Äôs a full time frontman. His new solo project, under the name frnkiero and the cellabration, has put out Stomachaches, the result of a tummy pain so painful it inspired the whole album. It‚Äôs also one of the best punk rock releases of the year.\n\nIt met up with Frank on Black Friday, so I asked if he wanted to go pick up some records on the cheap. We met at a little store that‚Äôd just opened, Flashback Records, just off Brick Lane, to avoid laceration by remorseless Rough Trade mobs.\n\nWe were both wearing the punk rock uniform. I‚Äôm just grateful I decided not to wear my Vans that day.\n\nNoisey: When we spoke before you said you were nervous about being a frontman and preferred being in the background. How‚Äôs that going?\n\nFrank: I always wanted to be in bands. But now there‚Äôs nothing to hide behind, I can‚Äôt just hang with my eyes fixed in the corner, even if I‚Äôm having a bad night. It‚Äôs very nerve-wracking, but I am enjoying it more than I thought I would.\n\nSo, how did you get into collecting records?\n\nMy father gave me one of those small box-sized travel players when I was a kid and just a handful of records that he had. Zeppelin IV was one. The Beatles at the Hollywood Bowl, which is just about the worst record ever ‚Äì you can‚Äôt hear anything, just screaming in the background. I think there was maybe like an Animals record. And I just listened to them over and over again.\n\nLots of people love vinyl since the revival. It‚Äôs more unusual to hear of younger people that have always been into them.\n\nI hear ya. It definitely ruins things for the collector because now a lot of stuff is a lot harder to find. I do feel like people have started to not value the music but value the packaging and art and how they consume the music. It‚Äôs a hard thing because you wish that they‚Äôd value the music as much as the rest. Though it‚Äôs nice that in a suffering industry, something still holds value.\n\nAre you going to pass records down to your kids?\n\nYeah, I hope so. I don‚Äôt know how into it they‚Äôre going to be. Or how relevant they‚Äôll be anymore. Maybe it‚Äôll go back to 8-tracks or whatever. Man, I got really lucky with their taste. They like great stuff. They‚Äôre really into The Smiths. My one daughter‚Äôs goth as fuck. It‚Äôs incredible. [Picks up Neutral Milk Hotel ‚Äì In the Aeroplane over the Sea] Oh, I love this record.\n\nMe too. Why do you love it?\n\nI guess the makeshift quality about it. I think my least favourite thing to listen to is perfect songs, perfect performances. They don‚Äôt feel human to me and in that respect they lose any kind of sincerity. I don‚Äôt know why, it‚Äôs just my ears. So I like it when things are a little off, you know. And this record‚Äôs a little off!\n\nWhat else is your goth daughter listening to?\n\nThe 5.6.7.8‚Äôs. My daughters will dance to that all day long. And actually that‚Äôs what I hope for them, is that if they ever do god forbid follow their dream and play music for a living, they‚Äôre a Japanese garage girl band.\n\nThat‚Äôd be sick. Speaking of sick, how have your tummy aches been?\n\nI have good days and bad. I actually have a sack full of medication here [he opens bag and shows me a washbag of meds] so this is my regiment for days. Dairy‚Äôs real bad. Even if you‚Äôre not celiac you can be gluten sensitive or whatever. No red meat. I started to incorporate poultry and fish in for protein. I don‚Äôt eat too much soy either. It‚Äôs a delicate balance.\n\nWhat have you been eating over here this week?\n\nLet‚Äôs see. I have a stock pile of gluten free bars. It‚Äôs hard. A lot of PB and J on gluten free bread.\n\nSomeone sent this great song to me recently: Paws ‚Äì ‚ÄúSore Tummy‚Äú. In my mind, it‚Äôs about anxiety and having chronic tummy aches. You should check it out.\n\nI will! That‚Äôs what some of my medication is for. You know, I feel like I‚Äôd probably be alright if it wasn‚Äôt for the music. It makes you live in your head. With anxiety, it‚Äôs so hard to pull it back.\n\nEveryone‚Äôs anxious.\n\nYeah. I feel like, sometimes, I picked the wrong career for this. Everything I love about what I do I hate at the same time. When you get up there and do the thing that I do, you have to be purely yourself. That put-on-an-act-shit makes me very upset and I never want to do that, you know. But at the same time, getting up there and doing this takes its toll sometimes. That make sense?\n\nIt makes sense. Hey, you‚Äôve got a serious pile going on down there.\n\nThis is the most dangerous interview I‚Äôve ever done. The good thing is I can tell my wife it‚Äôs my job. I had to go record shopping today.\n\nHave you had an interview yet where someone hasn‚Äôt talked about My Chem? Seriously.\n\nThis could have been the one!\n\nThis doesn‚Äôt count!\n\nAlright, you can be the one interview. I think people are starting to become a little reluctant to bring it up now. Or find it awkward. You got to understand, I grew up with those guys. That was my schooling, you know. That was 12 years of my life and I‚Äôm extremely proud of everything so I have no problem with people bringing it up.\n\nCool. Well What have your top records of the year been?\n\nThe latest Against Me! record. I think that‚Äôs fantastic. I will go with Homeless Gospel Choir. That Twilight record with Thurston Moore on it, III: Beneath Trident‚Äôs Tomb. That‚Äôs phenomenal. The La Dispute record. The latest Godspeed record. The Joyce Manor record ‚Äì which is brilliant.\n\nDo you have any special vinyl in your collection?\n\nI have ‚ÄúPurple Rain‚Äù on purple vinyl. Oh Grinderman 2. I think you should get this.\n\nI will because you said so. You need to get a Shoreditch beigel while you‚Äôre here by the way. It‚Äôs a London rite of passage.\n\nA London beigel, eh? Okay, I will. Oh my god! American Pie! THIS IS MY LEAST FAVOURITE RECORD IN THE WORLD. I hate it. This has one of my two least favourite songs on it. I very rarely like to talk shit. Very rarely. But. My two least favourite songs are ‚ÄúAmerican Pie‚Äù and ‚ÄúHotel California‚Äù by Eagles. It‚Äôs something I can‚Äôt explain.\n\nDo they grate on you or is it something else?\n\nYou know that feeling when you chew cotton? Like when you put your shirt in your mouth and chew it‚Ä¶\n\nWait I‚Äôm going to do it right now. [Sucks shirt]\n\nEven just watching you do it is making me‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs a shock right?\n\nIt‚Äôs making me feel a bit sick.\n\nRight! Right. That‚Äôs how I feel every time I hear those songs. God, this interview has put me in a hole.\n\nA hole?\n\nA financial one. [Flicks through emo section].\n\nWhat do you think about the ‚Äúemo revival‚Äù?\n\nAll the reunions and stuff right? I think we‚Äôre hitting that point now where a lot of newer bands are starting to sound similar. So I think people are looking back and searching for something that they can‚Äôt find anymore. I think just trying to grasp something fresh but also go back to where everything started. Like, where did this new genre that I‚Äôm sick of start?\n\nWhat‚Äôs the last thing you‚Äôve heard where you‚Äôve gone, fuck, this is genuinely different. Mine was probably Babymetal.\n\nBabymetal? I haven‚Äôt actually listened to a record, I‚Äôve seen the YouTube clips. They were actually on our plane over here.\n\nNo way.\n\nI really don‚Äôt know much about the band, but I‚Äôve heard so many rumours that I don‚Äôt know what to believe. [Looks serious] I heard from someone that if one of the girls gets too tall, she gets kicked out and replaced. Does that happen?\n\nI hope so. Fuck tall people. Shall we go buy these now?\n\nPlease stop me. In America, Black Friday is like second Record Store Day, so we could have been stuck in a queue for hours. I thought it‚Äôd be packed.\n\nI‚Äôm looking forward to Grinderman.\n\nI hope you like it. If you don‚Äôt, it‚Äôs going to be awkward. Send it to me.\n\nI‚Äôll wait til you come back over and play and confront you.\n\nOr throw it at my head while I‚Äôm playing.\n\nI‚Äôll Frisbee it to the neck.\n\n‚ÄúYour taste sucks!‚Äù\n\nWhat Frank bought:\n\nYuck ‚Äì Glow & Behold\n\nMuddy Waters ‚Äì Live at Newport 1960\n\nThe London Muddy Waters Session\n\nThe Flaming Lips ‚Äì Yoshimi Battles The Pink Robots\n\nAlbert Collins ‚Äì Ice Cold Blues\n\nWhat I bought:\n\nThe White Stripes ‚Äì Self Titled\n\nGrinderman ‚Äì Grinderman 2"
