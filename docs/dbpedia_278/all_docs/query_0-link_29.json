        "text": "All four members are photographed together\n\nPhotos have emerged of all four members of My Chemical Romance reuniting at Frank Iero’s gig in West Hollywood last night (10th May).\n\nIndicating that they’re all on great terms with each other, Gerard Way, Mikey Way and Ray Toro showed support for their former band mate by attending Frank’s intimate 500-capacity gig at the Troubadour venue.\n\nIn a series of photos posted on social media that have sent their fans into meltdown, the quartet can be seen laughing and hugging each other after the show. They also leave in the same car.\n\nCast your corneas on the pictorial evidence below:\n\nJust last month, Gerard Way released two curiously titled tracks ‘Into The Cave We Wander’ and ‘Pogi’s Cavern’ on limited edition vinyl for Record Store Day. Both songs were co-written and recorded by Gerard and Ray Toro.\n\nSince MCR’s untimely split in 2013, Mikey Way formed Electric Century with Sleep Station vocalist David Debiak, appeared in Good Charlotte’s video for ‘Makeshift Love’ and has occasionally played bass for Waterparks.\n\nMikey also played bass on two songs (‘We Don’t Have To Dance’ and ‘Louder Than Your Love’) on Andy Biersack’s debut solo album ‘The Shadow Side’, while Gerard co-wrote ‘Louder Than Your Love’ in a collaboration with his brother of sorts.\n\nFrank Iero released the album ‘Stomachaches’ under his frnkiero and the cellabration moniker in 2014 and followed it up with Frank Iero and The Patience’s ‘Parachutes’ last year.\n\nAlthough there’s no talk of a My Chemical Romance reunion yet, the photos from last night will be a beacon of hope for their millions of fans across the globe.\n\nMy Chemical Romance split on 22nd March 2013."
