        "text": "Last night, I went with my friends to see Frnk Iero and The Cellabration. I had planned to be at the venue by 2pm since doors were at 5 and I really wanted barricade for Frank Iero. Sadly, I arrived at the venue rather late. However, my friends who I intended to meet up with for the show arrived at the venue before I did, so we met by the tour buses. My friends Jill and Kaitlyn decided that we possibly had a better chance of meeting people before the show than after if we waited in front of the venue instead of waiting in line. I was hesitant about this because I really wanted barricade for Frank Iero, but their strategy to wait in front of the buses before the show instead of afterwards intrigued me. I decided to give their plan a go. We had been waiting around for about an hour and a half outside the venue. During that period of time, we ended up meeting Derek Sanders of Mayday Parade, Alex of Mayday Parade, one member of Cartel! Here are the pictures that I got with them:\n\n(Alex was kind enough to postpone his post-jog shower and came back out to take a picture with myself and my friends. He also chatted with us for a bit. Thank you so much, Alex! That was sweet of you.)\n\nAfter we met those band members, I began to get antsy, seeing as the line was getting longer and Frank was nowhere to be seen. I had finalized my decision to leave and get in line. “You know what, guys, I think I’m going to get in line.” I said. Moments after this, my friends and I watched as Frank Iero excited the door of the building to our left that we were standing outside of. “Frank!”, I exclaimed excitedly. He made a “deer in the headlights” look in my direction the second I shouted his name. A slightly bewildered but still very sweet, Frank approached me.\n\n“Hey!” Frank said. He quickly gave me a hug before kindly “Shh”ing me. He backed into a corner outside of the building where no one else could see him. I followed in suit. “We have to keep this,” he continued. “Under the radar?” , I said, finishing his sentence, to which he nodded and said “Yeah.” “Got it, “I replied. I glanced down at my phone. “May I have a picture with you, please? ” I asked, looking into his (RIDICULOUSLY BEAUTIFUL) hazel eyes. They were the brightest green I’d ever seen with flecks of brown in them. “Sure,” he replied, to which I held up my phone and snapped a photo. Frank softly smiled at me as I put down my phone. “Thank you! I made you a gift,” I said, handing him a small silver box. “Oh!” Frank said quietly as he began to take off the lid. Since he seemed to be in a hurry, I decided to tell him what it was before he could finish opening it. (which I somewhat regret now) “It’s a badge like this!” , I said excitedly as I pointed at my handmade Frnk Iero and The Cellebration badge on my shirt. “Oh wow!” Frank said, looking at it in awe. “Yeah, It glows in the dark too!” I added. “Wow, thank you.” Frank said, putting the gift in his pocket. He continued to look at me. A brief moment of silence passed as I allowed myself to asses the situation and think of what I really wanted to tell Frank before he left and I lost the chance. “I’ve been a fan of My Chemical Romance since I was 10 years old and I’m 18 now and it honestly means so much to me that I get to meet you and I love you so much, ” I said. Frank smiled at me, surprise in his eyes as he said “Thank you.” I know that it may sound as though Frank did not say much during our interaction, but the vast amount expression that I could see in his eyes as I talked with him spoke louder than words. Also, I was in quite the amount of shock during our entire interaction, so some of our conversation may be lost somewhere deep within my mind as a result of that.I suppose a person would have had to be there in my shoes in order to understand what I mean by that. Haha. Perhaps someone out there in the universe and relate.\n\nPretty much everything after this was a daze for me because I was in so much shock that I met one of my heroes from when I was a child. I’m sure that everything is 100% accurate but it is pretty close. I do remember Frank taking the time to quickly take pictures with two of my other friends. He quickly greeted some other fans as a small crowd began to head in our direction. He greeted a few more before heading across the street to wherever he previously intended to go.\n\nHere is my selfie with Frank as well as some pictures my friend Jill Wilde took of my interaction with Frank:\n\n(Aside from being a great friend, Jill does amazing photography. Please check out her photography page here! https://www.facebook.com/JillianWildePhotography)\n\nAlso, here is a picture of the badge I gave to Frank! (The picture to the right was a prototype that I made for myself. Frank’s glows all over without any dark spots. haha I just forgot to take a picture of it glowing before I gave it to him!)\n\nMoments after Frank’s departure, I also ran into two of the members of Young Rising Sons who I had previously seen open for The 1975!\n\nAnd this FABULOUS man and his AMAZING dog followed after that!\n\nhttps://instagram.com/p/0k9z7Mwdvd/\n\n~Flash forward to the actual concert~\n\nDespite missing out on waiting in line to get into the venue, I managed to get a pretty decent spot to the far left of the stage, in the middle of the crowd. Having parted ways with my friends Jill and Kaitlyn, I was alone but not for long! “I love your merch!” I heard someone say. I looked to my right to see a pretty girl with a brown pixi cut and The Misfits inspired Frnk Iero and The Cellabration shirt. She smiled with excitement as she pointed at my badge. “Thank you! ” I replied. “It’s actually not merch, I made it!” I beamed, excited to have met a fellow killjoy. “What, really? That’s awesome!” she responded. From that point onward, I managed to befriend her, her internet friend, as long as my internet friend Phoebe, and another fellow Killjoy who runs a twitter page dedicated to Frank Iero! (Twitter: @OdetoFrnk) Together, we discussed topics such as my previous encounter with Frank, Frank’s performance at South By So What (that I sadly missed), my badge and its magical glow in the dark abilities, and how to get barricade for Frank! I don’t think I’ve ever made friends so quickly! I suppose that is why I love the MCR fandom so much. Most MCR fans that I have met are extremely affable, passionate, and creative. Despite our brilliant plan to get barricade for frank, we sadly did not manage to get barricade for Frank. However, we did come close! We were to the far left of the stage still, but right behind the front row of people who were on the barricade. Since we weren’t that close to Frank, we made up for it by shouting the lyrics as loud as possible during his set.\n\nHere are some pictures and videos I took during the show! (I zoomed in a lot, so it appears as though I am closer to barricade than I actually was. haha) :\n\nDriver Friendly:\n\nFrnk Iero and The Cellabration:\n\nAll in all, Frank’s set was phenomenal as expected. Despite not having barricade, I had tons of fun singing along and chatting with my new friends! After Frnk Iero and The Cellabration’s set ended, my new friends and I went to his merch table to purchase some treasures. I spent the rest of the night watching Cartel, The Maine, and Mayday Parade at the back of the venue with Jill and Kaitlyn. We still had quite the view! I also caught up with with some of my other friends from past shows and got to hang for a bit. It was a nice end to the night!\n\nIf you stayed all the way to the end of this, you deserve a treat. So here’s a 3 second video that I took of Frank Iero drinking coffee as he walked off stage!\n\nI hope that you have enjoyed my post and that you continue to stay with me on my adventures to come as I build this blog. Thank you for reading! -Alesandra 🙂"
