        "text": "Frank Iero has revealed the details of his new Reverb store where guitars, amps and other memorabilia from across his career will now be available for purchase by fans.\n\nAmong the most prized items is the 2000s Fender Telecaster 72 Deluxe Reissue he played in My Chemical Romance, with Frank saying that “…the time has come to pass it on to another deserving player” adding “I loved using this guitar on MCR’s The Black Parade touring cycle…[it] even appeared on [MCR’s] performance of ‘Famous Last Words’ when we played The Tonight Show with Jay Leno.”\n\nOther notable instruments and items on the store include…\n\nAn Ampeg 8×10 Bass Cabinet – ”If road-worn cabinets are your thing, this is the holy grail. Originally owned by Mikey Way, then gifted to me. This cabinet was originally stage used in MCR, then Leathermouth, by me in Reggie and the Full Effect, and in The Love Cats, then painted pink and black for [my solo projects].”\n\nA Nash T-72 DLX – ”This originally belonged to James Bowman, guitar player of Against Me! He played it when they toured with Green Day on the Revolution Radio Tour. I then purchased it from him and used it to record ‘The Unfortunate’ on ‘Barriers’, an album I did with the Future Violents that we recorded with Steve Albini in Chicago at Electrical Audio.”\n\nAn Epiphone Black Les Paul – ”This is the first Les Paul I ever owned, probably paving the way for my future affinity for Epiphone Les Pauls later on in life. This particular LP was smashed during a Pencey Prep show.”\n\nAn Orange 4×12 Guitar Cabinet – ”This cabinet has seen quite a few shows. Originally painted for ‘Danger Days: The True Lives of the Fabulous Killjoys’, this cab was stage used in MCR for the full run of that record cycle until the band’s last show in 2012. Later, the cabinet was painted over black and pink and used in all three [of my] solo incarnations.”\n\nIero’s first bass guitar, a Series 10 four-string bass, is also on sale, repainted white for the ‘Joyriding’ music video, as is a 1970’s Ludwig Blue Vistalite Drum Set that MCR used while writing ‘Danger Days’.\n\nYou will be able to purchase store items from Wednesday, June 28th at 10:00 a.m. Central Time and can preview the whole store until then right here.\n\nMore like this\n\nSpiritbox & Megan Thee Stallion Team Up For 'Cobra' Rock Remix\n\nThe unexpected collab we never knew we needed.\n\nSkindred Unveil Joyous Video For ‘If I Could’\n\nIt arrives after their win at the MOBO Awards for Best Alternative Music Act.\n\nPalaye Royale Release 'umakemenotwannadie' & Announce New EP\n\n'Songs For Sadness' arrives next week.\n\nNormandie Collab With Bury Tomorrow’s Dani Winter-Bates For New Single ‘Hourglass’\n\nThe band’s ‘Dopamine’ LP is set for release on February 09."
