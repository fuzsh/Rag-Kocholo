        "text": "A Friday night in Washington, D.C. is never a dull one. Frank Iero and the Patience (consisting of Frank Iero: Lead Singer + Guitar, Evan Nestor Guitar+ Backup Vocals, Alex Grippo: Bass, Matt Olson: Drummer + Backup Vocals) brought their sound to U Street! On their US run, they promoted sophomore album, “Parachutes” released last October. In the fall, the New Jersey based band will be heading to Europe and the UK to promote their music overseas.\n\nFrank, the lead singer and guitarist, started various projects after the breakup of the world known band, My Chemical Romance (MCR). Frank Iero and the Patience released their debut album, “Stomachaches” in 2014, still keeping the alternative rock scene that he brought to his past work.\n\nLoyal fans that reign from MCR continue to show support to his new music! The dedicated fans from DC mentioned how they saw him back in MCR and they were thrilled that he was back. The band put all their energy into their electric performance and interacting with the audience! Frank was overjoyed at the crowd and the enormous support he has received since.\n\nAfter the show, a few preview photos were released to get our readers excited for what’s to come. Frank’s fans quickly saw and the internet was ecstatic! They made sure to comment on his recent ‘hair makeover’. The first photos to debut it were the buzz on Tumblr and other social media!\n\nNeedless to say, the band put up an impressive performance and won DC over. Their fan base is strong and continuing to grow. We hope to hear great things from Frank Iero and the Patience soon. DC will definitely be waiting for their return to the local stages.\n\nKeep up with the band on Frank’s Twitter"
