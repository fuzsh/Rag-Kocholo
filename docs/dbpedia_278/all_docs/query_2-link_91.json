Thanks, Deisy!\n\nMy Chemical Romance\n\nThe Black Parade\n\nOne of the most legendary bands of the Punk rock/ Rock world is definitely My Chemical Romance. MCR officially debuted in 2002 with I Brought You Bullets, You Brought Me Your Love, they later signed with another label which released their major hit album Three Cheers For Sweet Revenge.\n\nMCR has many successful hits such as “Na Na Na,” “I’m Not Okay,” and “Welcome to the Black Parade” which are favorites among the fans.\n\nParsons Music Library has the album The Black Parade available for anyone to come listen to it. It has my top favorite songs which are “I Don’t Love You” and “Famous Last Words.” If you are looking to enter the Punk/Rock world, MCR is the place to go.\n\nEditor’s note: Arachnophonia is a regular feature on our blog where members of the UR community can share their thoughts about resources from the Parsons Music Library‘s collection.\n\nAll links included in these posts will take you to either the library catalog record for the item in question or to additional relevant information from around the web.\n\nToday’s installment of Arachnophonia is by student worker Olivia (class of 2019) and features The Black Parade, the third studio album by American rock band My Chemical Romance, aka MCR. Thanks, Olivia!\n\nMy Chemical Romance\n\nThe Black Parade\n\nIf you would care to, imagine a flustered 13 year old girl who cut her own ragged side bangs, refused to wear colors other than red and black, and printed out pages and pages of My Chemical Romance lyrics to memorize before bed each night.\n\nThis was my reality in middle school. My parents hated it. I loved it.\n\nWhen I began listening to MCR, they had recently released their 2006 album, The Black Parade, a musical narrative telling the story of ‘The Patient’ who falls ill and dies, experiences the afterlife and reflects on the life he led. With the album came the platinum hair of Gerard Way (he had a different hair color for almost every album) and the peak popularity of the band’s career. The most popular song on the album, “Welcome to the Black Parade,” I played during my 7th grade piano recital, to my parents’ horror (ahh memories). The music video very accurately characterizes the theme, energy, and story continued throughout the album.\n\nOne of the things I love most about MCR is how they weave each album’s music into a crazy, creative and awe-inspiring narrative, and continue that narrative through music videos and live performances. It makes listening to their music an active experience. This was also demonstrated through their 2010 album, Danger Days: The True Lives of the Fabulous Killjoys, which featured a corresponding comic book series published by Dark Horse as well as a full\n\ncharacter costume for each band member – and cherry red hair for Gerard Way.\n\nYou know I have every issue of that comic series in my room at home, by the way.\n\nThe extent to which I immersed myself in The Black Parade, (along with all of MCR’s albums) has made such a lasting impact on me. Twelve years later and I still consistently listen to my favorite band from middle school – those years are impactful and to this day I have not felt the same connection to any artist or group as I felt and still feel to My Chemical Romance."
