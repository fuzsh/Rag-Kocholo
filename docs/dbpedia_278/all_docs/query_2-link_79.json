        "text": "In the midst of his UK tour supporting Mallory Knox, I was lucky enough to sit with Frank and put just some of your many questions to him. Thanks to everyone for sending them in over the past few weeks and sorry we couldn’t answer them all – he had a show to get to! [Spoiler: He and the Cellabration absolutely killed it!]\n\nSo behold – Frank answers your questions about future tours, his favourite things…and Bon Jovi tattoos.\n\nYou’ve got a lot of history with the UK, what’s it like being back?\n\nIt’s great, what’s weird is that I don’t remember there being so many problems with getting hotels here. This entire run I think we’ve called maybe 40 hotels and everyone is sold out, every night of the week. It doesn’t matter if it’s a Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, it’s crazy!\n\nBut [the tour’s been] amazing, I really do like playing here. The travel’s hard, I don’t much enjoy travelling anyway and international travelling is extremely hard, but I enjoy the people and the shows. I feel like there’s a real love for music here and a real love for bands and artists that’s refreshing; that’s something that I miss about back home.\n\nWell we’re all enjoying it, so much so that so many people want to know when you’re coming back! Do you have any plans for a headline tour here or anywhere else?\n\nYes, that’s what we’re working on right now actually. We’re doing a headliner in the States and then trying to plan that, along with a couple of festivals. So we’re going to try to do the States and then come back, not just to the UK but to do Europe as well.\n\n(Russian fans, I asked especially for you if he would ever visit and he said he’d love to and to tell you he’s trying!)\n\nWhat bands do you want to tour with next? Do you have a wish list in your head?\n\nI do, yeah. We’re doing at least one show with the Bouncing Souls, then there’s a free show in Brooklyn coming up that’s literally just been announced. I don’t know who’s going to be playing on it, we have a few bands we’re asking but everyone seems to be busy, it’s crazy. For the US tour there’s someone we’re talking to but I don’t want to say anything until it’s announced. Unfortunately I think Youth Code can’t do it, so we’re upset about that, but we have two other people that we’re asking.\n\nThe Cellabration have a bit of their own following now – will the band line-up stay the same or will it have to change due to their other commitments?\n\nI hope it doesn’t change. I’d like it to stay the same but that’s the thing, everyone has other bands. I think Matt Olsson’s in like 14 different projects! But that’s the thing that works too, I’ve always enjoyed [having lots of projects] so I can’t fault anyone else for doing it. Y’know, it sucks too, I wish I disliked their other bands, but I like their bands so much that I would be like ‘of course you have to do that, how could you not do a Low Road show or a Science show?’ But hopefully we can plan the Cellabration stuff far enough in advance that we can work around schedules.\n\nDo you and the Cellabration have any pre-show rituals for this tour?\n\nThere’s a vocal warm-up that Evan and I do, we listen to a guy named Jamie Wigginton who’s very proper and very encouraging. It’s a CD where he tells you how awesome you’re doing but it’s recorded, so it’s really weird. So we do that and drink a lot of hot water and lemon, stretch a little bit and then before a show we put our hands together like a one-two-three thing, and what we say changes every night. Rob usually comes up with it, he’s very into it.\n\nYou should definitely put what you guys say every night on Twitter, any examples?\n\nOK, well the first night we got here, we got into one an elevator, but when it said ‘Doors closing’ all we heard was [puts on English accent] ‘George Clooney!’, so George Clooney happened a couple of nights, that’s a constant. We pulled into a parking lot and some guy came up to the window and to this day we have no idea what he said, but it sounded like ‘Spicy spears’, so that was one. It changes every night and you’d have no idea what it meant if I Twittered it. So, I’m glad I talked about it now [laughs].\n\nNow you’ve toured it for a while, do you have a favourite song and lyric from Stomachaches?\n\nThere’s a couple, I think Stitches has a lot of good one liners in it. That [first] verse in Weighted might be my favourite thing I’ve ever wrote. Ever. That was one that came out in a line and I was like ‘Oh shit, I’m not going to change any of that’ so those are still up there.\n\nDoes that mean Stitches will be the next single/video? Do you have an idea of what you’d like it to be?\n\nStitches won’t be the new single, but I’ve wrote a treatment for the next single video, I think it’s going to Prettiest Girl.\n\nYes! I polled that on Twitter before I came and that was the most popular, so we’re very excited about that.\n\nWow, really? That’s crazy! It’s funny, in talking to the label they wanted to go between Prettiest and Stage 4, but I feel like to play Stage 4 it would have to be our own show, I don’t know why. I’ve written a whole video for [Prettiest], so right now we’re working on it. The idea was to do it in-between the US tour and the UK tour but it just didn’t work out. We’re trying to make it work with Ghost Cow again, they’ve been really busy too and getting so much attention for the Drone boning thing, but I’m glad they are.\n\nWill it be bloodier than Joyriding, do you think that’s even possible?\n\n[Laughs] It’s very far removed from any of that and I don’t think I have to be in it at all, which I’m pretty excited about.\n\nI bet you did that deliberately right?\n\nNah, it’s funny, you would think so as I would love to not be in the video, but interestingly the way that the story goes it has nothing to do with me. I like the treatment and I’m hoping we can get it done as close to the vision as possible, but I think it’s going to be a bit hard. So we’ll see what happens.\n\nDo you get to keep any of the fanmail, gifts and art you receive or would you practically need another house to store it all in?\n\nThat’s the thing, yeah it’s hard. You receive it and you’re thankful to get it and then you enjoy it as much as you can, but then y’know, eventually you have to clear it out for the next stuff that you get. We try to share any candy we get as much as possible with the rest of the tour. Here’s the thing, I love when people give us artwork, I love that, but at the same time when I get home I can’t just have loads of pictures of me! How weird would it be if there was pictures of me everywhere? I mean, my kids would need therapy! It’s ridiculous, I couldn’t do that so I have to enjoy it for a while and then I have to part with it unfortunately.\n\nWell this is where you get to say what you’d like more of from us. Is there anything in-particular you want people to give you? Like more sweets, or cigarettes and money?\n\n[Laughs] Just a nice conversation is the best. I prefer a nice conversation over a picture, and this is just in my head, I feel like the memories are way better than any video or picture you could ever have. That’s just my feelings on it but I know people feel differently, so whatever they want is cool. Whatever they want to give is fine, they don’t have to give anything, I’d rather them not – save their money and just enjoy themselves and just say hi.\n\nA lot of people want to know about your favourite things, so here’s a quick fire. What’s your favourite:\n\nFilm?\n\nThat’s hard, usually I say Die Hard. It’s either Die Hard, Ghostbusters and even Home Alone is up there. Just things from my childhood.\n\nAlbum?\n\nOK I have a top three. I’ve been thinking about adding the fourth [laughs] but I’m not sure. So it’s Sgt Peppers by The Beatles, 36 Chambers by Wu-Tang Clan, and In Utero by Nirvana. And then the fourth is Aftermath by The Rolling Stones.\n\nBook?\n\nAh that’s hard, I feel like certain times call for different things. Definitely Catcher in the Rye is up there, however I feel like it’s not [Salinger’s] best work. Franny and Zooey and Nine Stories are maybe even better than Catcher. I’m rereading Slaughterhouse-Five again right now on my phone, which is fantastic. The fact that you can read your Kindles on your phone is amazing, I love it so much but I think it’s making me blind in one eye. Really anything by [Kurt Vonnegut I’ll read over and over again. I also thought The Book Thief was fantastic.\n\nOK, my favourite fan question (thanks to @Jaynebugs) – Is your ‘Keep the Faith’ tattoo a Bon Jovi reference?\n\n[Laughs] (By laugh I mean he shouted ‘HA!’) That’s a good question! It’s a bastardised Bon Jovi tattoo, because really where it came from for me is on Maniacal Laughter [by The Bouncing Souls]. At the end of ‘The BMX Song’ they yell ‘Keep the faith’ over and over again, so it’s actually about the Souls’ song. Sorry Bon Jovi fans, but I’m sure they got it from Bon Jovi!\n\nYou’ve already released music with your daughters [BFF – check it out if you haven’t heard it!], would you like to do this again in the future, or with the whole family?\n\nYeah, I mean Miles isn’t on that recording but we’ve done things together, like all of us, that are just for me. But I mean, whatever they want to do honestly. Like sometimes they’re way into it and sometimes they don’t want anything to do with it.\n\nBut that’s just because it’s their dad is doing it and that’s never cool, right?\n\nProbably, I can imagine that absolutely. Right now, they’re not into tours, they don’t like it all. Before I left for this one my daughter Lily told me, ‘I don’t think you should go on tour because I kinda feel like you’re going to die’. [Bursts into laughter] It was the day before I left, what a terrible thing to say!\n\nSo do you let them listen to any of your music?\n\nThey’ve heard some stuff, y’know, it’s hard to keep their interest unless it’s something that they’re really into, that’s the thing. I did theme songs for everyone, so they love that and want to hear it over and over again. It’s weird, Miles really likes Lily’s song! They like BFF because they did it, they like that kind of stuff. But they don’t like hearing your record, it’s like ‘Dad, you don’t have to play your record again!’\n\nEspecially with all those pictures you have up of yourself…\n\nYeah, yeah ‘you’ve got all these pictures of yourself, you’re serenading me and all these pictures that people painted of you, it’s so fucking weird!’\n\nAre there any plans for album number two? Have you been writing anything whilst on the road or just enjoying Stomachaches at the moment?\n\nI’m enjoying this at the moment, but there’s a song that won’t go away that I would really like to flesh out but I don’t think I can do it on this tour. I meant to do it before things got crazy but I couldn’t and I thought it was just gonna go away but it hasn’t, so that’s nice. There’s a song that I finished a while ago [with Matt on drums] and I think it’s going to be on a comp album coming out soon. And then there’s little riffs here and there. I have some titles for things, I don’t know what they mean yet but I’m looking forward to it. I think over Christmas break we’ll probably start writing a little bit, it’ll be fun.\n\nNot to add the pressure, but Death Spells and Leathermouth fans have been asking about those projects too. Do you have any plans for them or will you just focus on FIATC for now?\n\nYes, I’m focusing on this but I did get a couple of emails from [James] Dewees whilst I was out here, so we’ll see what happens. But yeah, it’s so hard to focus on multiple things at a time, especially for me as I feel so scattered with things. My resolution has been to try to focus and to live in the moment, because I feel like the more I scatter myself I feel like I’ve short-changed everything, y’know? So I’m trying not to do that.\n\nOK, let’s stop with all this future stuff then! Or everyone will hold you to everything you say and bug you about it.\n\nYes, sorry! Part of my problem too is that I feel like I’m a habitual people-pleaser, so I’ll just say shit to make people feel nice [laughs] and then later I’ll forget or y’know not hold true to it.\n\nNow for a difficult one, if you and The Cellabration were TV/film/cartoon characters, who would you all be?\n\n[To Matt who’s just walked past] Who would you be? Oh [Matt] would be Paul Giamatti! [Laughs] There’s a little bit of resemblance, in a very handsome way! I think he just took it the wrong way though… [Matt flips him the bird before he leaves]\n\nWhat about you?\n\nI don’t know, er, Pat from Saturday Night Live probably. We talked about Rob being the old guy who salts the walkway in Home Alone. I don’t know who Evan would be, he’s the nicest guy. He’ll talk to anybody for hours about anything. He’s amazing, like he’ll see the sketchiest character in the entire country and Evan’s like ‘we’ve traded phone numbers!’\n\nRight last few questions, what new music can you recommend to your fans?\n\nOh man, there’s a few actually. The van is always bumping the new Homeless Gospel Choir [I Used To Be So Young], which is a fantastic record and we’d like to tour with them at some point. The new Joyce Manor record Never Hungover Again is fantastic. Moose Blood [from this tour] are so good, it’s a great record. We’ve been playing the new Julian Casablancas+The Voidz record before we play, which I think is going to be fun. I still think that the Against Me! record [Transgender Dysphoria Blues] is one of the greatest of the year.\n\nYou should definitely tour with them!\n\nAh, it’d be amazing. I love that band, phenomenal. I definitely try to take a lot from them and especially from Laura. Like one of my favourite things about that band is you go see them and there’s no talking or like ‘How you all doing tonight?’ kind of thing, it’s always ‘Hey we’re Against Me!’ and then they’d just fucking play. I love that. I think it depends on the show, you can talk but actually a lot of times you’re like, ‘I don’t want to hear this banter!’ Unless there’s something important I have to say I’m not just going to kill time, like I want to be up there and slay it and let people enjoy the music. Let the music speak for itself. The person who pointed that out to me was actually my wife. And I agree, it’s a good excuse for me to not say a Goddamn thing.\n\nFinally, any messages to the fans or things you want us to know about?\n\nWell I will say that this tour more than any other, I don’t know why I want you to know this, but I have worn more layers than ever. I have my sweats on underneath my jeans [pulls up leg to confirm]. It’s so cold here! It’s so incredibly cold! I’m having such a hard time with it.\n\nSo forget other gifts, knitwear is what you want fans to bring you now right?\n\nOh yeah! [laughs] Any kind of outerwear is always appreciated! Yes, I love knitwear, this is true – long-sleeved everything. But yes we’re just having such a good time, definitely a bit homesick but I feel like the familiar faces and the kindness really helps. Just trying to stay healthy and give the best shows that we can. And thank you guys for understanding, it’s been nice.\n\n—"
