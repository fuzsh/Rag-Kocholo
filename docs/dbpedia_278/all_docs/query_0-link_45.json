        "text": "Singer/songwriter Frank Iero, the former guitarist for now-defunct rock act My Chemical Romance, has unveiled the third chapter in his career as a solo artist. Just this week, he’s announced a new band name (an ever-changing aspect that comes along with each new chapter of his solo endeavors), a brand new album, tour dates, and he’s now unveiled the first taste of music that people can expect from Frank Iero and the Future Violents. The new single, “Young and Doomed\"”, comes from the upcoming studio album Barriers, set to be released on May 31st via UNFD.\n\nFrank Iero and the Future Violents is comprised of Frank Iero, Evan Nestor, Matt Armstrong, Tucker Rule, and Kayleigh Goldsworth. The album was recorded and mixed by Steve Albini, while the video for “Young and Doomed” was directed by Steven Pedulla (from Thursday). In a press release, Iero stated the following in regards to the release of Barriers:\n\n“I never expected to do one solo record in my lifetime,” he chuckles, “let alone three. Every time I start a new record, I say to myself ‘This is it. This is the end. This is the last one.’ It got me thinking about how we set up these obstacles around ourselves. Sometimes they’re for protection and sometimes they’re to keep people out, and sometimes we even set them up so that we fail and we find solace in that failure. But whenever I find something that scares the shit out of me, that’s when I know I have to do it! And so these songs are about experiences that were either walls I wanted to break down or walls that I’d built up around myself in order to protect myself. But these songs were also things that I’d never attempted before but had always wanted to try.”\n\nBelow, you can view the album artwork, the music video for “Young and Doomed”, the track listing for Barriers, and the upcoming tour dates that the band have throughout this year.\n\nBarriers\n\n1.
