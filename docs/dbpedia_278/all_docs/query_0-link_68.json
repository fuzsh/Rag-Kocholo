        "text": "Frank Iero is a rock star. I doubt he’d welcome the title, but there it is – he plays guitar in a rock band called My Chemical Romance, he’s played stadiums, teenage girls scream for him and plaster their bedroom walls with his pictures. I am one of them (0nly WAY older, ahem). Anyway, the point is, he is actually different from your average rock star in that his head isn’t buried in his ass too much. Also he is heartbreakingly handsome. I know, because he has broken my heart and I don’t ever want it to get better. Anyway, I don’t know Frank. I’ve never even met him. But in typical fangirl style I have made a bunch of assumptions based on stalker like attention to what information there is out there about him, daydreams and wild fantasy. In an effort to understand why anyone would do such a thing to a fellow human being (who, presumably take a dump just like everyone else and has possibly been a prick on occasion), here are five pictures of him, gacked from the interwebs, that have contributed to my made up ideal of Frank Iero:\n\n1. I don’t know when this picture is from, but I’m guessing it’s relatively recent based on the trucker tash and his grown-up eyes. Frank has a thing for wearing his baseball caps a bit wonky and making questionable facial hair choices (I mean, I don’t question them. I embrace them – not literally, but like I would do that too if I could…and if it wouldn’t get me arrested…anyway…), but it can’t detract from how incredibly expressive his face is. That smile right there is saying all sorts of stuff. It’s saying, “I’m a guy who likes to laugh, sometimes at you”. It’s saying, “I don’t take shit too seriously”. It’s also saying – and this is important because this picture was taken by a fan and Frank has always treated his fans like gold- it kind of likes the person behind the camera. The best thing though is that there is joy in his eyes. You can’t fake that shit. I like thinking of Frankie as a joyful kind of guy.\n\n2. Along side the joyful is also the cheeky. Frank has cheek in spades. This pic looks like it’s from around the Three Cheers mark? Maybe earlier. I’m not sure. Actually, it must be earlier, because he doesn’t look like 75 thousand years of touring has taken it’s toll yet.\n\nIn other words: I don’t know. Whatever, this is a guy who’s either about to invite you to join him in dusting his bandmates underroos with itching powder, quickly, while no one’s on the tour bus; or waiting for you to realise he has dusted your gruts with said powder and whacky japes are but a moment from ensuing. Mirth. Joy. Naughtiness.\n\nAlso, this is my favourite Frank hair cut, randomly known in fandom circles as Frank’s Asshole Hair. I don’t know why. This guy isn’t an asshole, he’s Puck of Pooks Hill for crying out loud.\n\nThe thing about this picture is that it’s so engaging, he’s looking straight at you, asking you for…something…possibly just to take the damned picture already and let him get on with glad-wrapping the toilets seats. Whatever, it’s an inclusive face. Maybe the face of someone who thinks everyone is great off the bat…and reserves judgement until he’s found out whether or not you’re the kind of person who says ‘It’s not the heat, it’s the humidity’, or the kind of person who says, ‘Fuck me, it’s hot. Lets exchange this gatoraid for eco-detergent?!’\n\n3. This picture was taken early in 2010 when the band played a couple of shows in Japan as a warm up to what was to be the release of their fourth studio album…the one that never materialised, but instead turned into some kind of weird electronica freak-out that would take another six months to record. WTF.\n\nThat aside, this is a pic from then. I’m not fucking around here when I say this picture actually made me cry like a bitch. Look at it. At first I thought he looks slightly braindamaged. But then I realised this is just the face of a guy who is actually happy. (And maybe brain damaged. IDK. Japan can make you feel like you’ve been severely brain-dmamaged if you’re not prepared for it. He looks vague and sweetly innocent, which is the best place to be in when assaulted by the fact that you don’t have a fucking clue what’s going on and no matter what you do, you’ve not going to get a clue any time soon, also known as Toyko. Thankfully, Frank’s seemed a lot less vague and sweetly innocent since this was taken, though, so probably his head is a-ok. ) Maybe he’s taking the piss, in which case, bravo. Well, played! Because it is laugh-out-loud funny how simple he looks in this pic. Whatever, this picture is special to me because it had been so fucking long since MCR had done anything as a band and then, there they were, doing interviews, swanning around in Japan, firing their management team…rocking the fuck out. It was a dream come true, and that’s how Frank seems to me in this pic: Dreamy. Dreamy, with bonus trucker tash. *LOVES*\n\n4. No shit, Frank Iero loves his wife. And why wouldn’t he? Jamia Nestor (I don’t actually know if she changed her name or not.) is fucking awesome. Not only is she heartbreakingly pretty, but she’s kick-ass too. Frank has said that when he met her she was putting on and promoting underground punk shows in NJ with a group of her friends, entirely self funded and off their own backs – and it inspired the fuck out of him, because it was the first time he’d actually seen kids doing shit for themselves.\n\nJamia is now CEO of Skeleton Crew, the Ieros’ clothing, music and publishing company, and is about to give birth to their first kids – twin (possibly) girls. You wont see her online – she has a myspace, but it’s invite only – but you will see her at shows selling merch and promoting their bands because she is made entirely of win.\n\nThe reason I love this pic is because it is all about their love – Frank looks almost dopey with it and Jamia looks excited and delighted and really frikken happy. Also, you can see Jamia’s epic smile which I have heard tell is bright enough to power half of Trenton for 24 hours per smile. No shit. Also, it looks like the kind of hug everyone needs and very few people get. I go all misty eyed just thinking about how comfy and good that hug looks. Om nom nom nom!\n\n5. I think Frank’s dog obsession is pretty legendary by now. He has, I think, nine of them – some elderly rescues, some from god knows where, I can’t even tell what breed they are – That’s true love. I have two and want to gas the little fuckers every day for some new havoc they have wrought on my home and possessions, but that’s beside the point. The point is this picture is fucking insanely cute. It’s very recent, posted by Frank himself (perhaps taken by Jamia??) on twitter with the words: “Once bitten I am condemned to walk the earth forever, a Chihuahua of the night”.\n\n*sigh*\n\nThere are a few pictures of Frank with this dog, Peppers, about, but this is the one that actually makes my heart ache. That is a Dog in love. I know something about dog’s and their attachments, and when a dog wants to puppy pile with you it can mean only one thing – It think’s you’re good enough to be one of them. And as everyone knows, dogs are the living embodyment of everything that is wholesome and good in the world (except my two dogs, the exceptions which prove the rule) and the things we hold dearest in ourselves – honesty, loyalty and respect (anyone with a well trained dog knows what I mean). Three words which, incidentally, Frank has inked on his left arm to represent the kind of people he wants in his life, and the kind of person he wants to be. So yeah, in a meta kind of way, this is a picture about what kind of man Frank is. In other words, good enough to love."
