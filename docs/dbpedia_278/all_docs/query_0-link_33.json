        "text": "My Chemical Romance may be no more, but its members continue to spark their own brand of rock and roll creativity. This past Tuesday night (August 6), guitarist Frank Iero brought his punk rock project, aptly titled Frank Iero and the Future Violents, to Crescent Ballroom in downtown Phoenix. The group hit the road for the Barriers World Tour at the end of May in support of their newest release and third studio album, Barriers. Notable appearances on the tour include the 25th anniversary of Vanâ€™s Warped Tour and the 15th anniversary of Riot Fest. Supporting Iero on this West Coast leg of the run is singer/songwriter and long time friend, Geoffrey Rickly, who we all know from his work in Thursday. Check our gallery of the action below."
