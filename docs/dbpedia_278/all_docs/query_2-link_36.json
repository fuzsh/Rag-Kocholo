        "text": "After a bus crash in Australia, former My Chemical Romance guitarist Frank Iero and his band, the Patience, had to cancel their tour, including a date at Starland Ballrom, but their new record rocks!\n\nOct. 28 show at Starland Ballroom had to be canceled, but Iero's \"Parachutes\" will released the same day\n\n\"Parachutes\" was produced by Ross Robinson & Steve Evetts (Sepultura, Slipknot, The Cure)\n\nThe 12-song follow-up to the 2014 Vagrant debut \"Stomachaches\" features the single \"I'm a Mess\"\n\nIero and the Patience are expected to tour with Taking Back Sunday in early 2017\n\nSo I’ve got some bad news. Frank Iero and the Patience were in a car accident while touring in Australia that postponed their flight home and canceled their Oct. 28 show at Starland Ballroom, as well as my interview with their front man, the former guitarist of My Chemical Romance.\n\nAccording to Alternative Press, Iero's tour van was in front of Sydney's Twitter headquarters when a bus crashed into the back of it. The official My Chemical Romance Twitter then reported two of Iero's band members underwent surgery and that Iero was \"banged up pretty badly.\"\n\nBut I also have some good news. According to band spokeswoman Sue Marcus, Iero and Patience guitarist Evan Nestor, drummer Matt Olsson, and bassist Alex Grippo will be OK and will release “Parachutes,” their awesome second album for Vagrant/BMG Records, on Oct. 28.\n\nI’m glad that the band didn’t go splat in their accident and that Iero also had this album, along with the love of his family and music in general, to keep from hitting the ground too soon.\n\nLike a modern-day Stooges, MC5 and solo John Lennon, he metaphorically splits his heart open on “Parachutes” and spurts blood into all 12 tracks in a way that defies the uplifting title, especially compared to the heavier, chunkier and less manic 2014 Vagrant debut, “Stomachaches.”\n\nBut unlike a lot of angst-ridden punk-rock albums, the dozen raw, primal tracks have tasteful musical peaks and valleys most likely helped by the esteemed production team of Ross Robinson & Steve Evetts (Sepultura, Slipknot, The Cure).\n\nIn press material, Iero said working with them “was the most heartbreaking yet uplifting, depleting yet inspiring experience I have ever had. I found out things about myself and the songs I was writing that changed me forever. I am so proud of this record, it really took everything I had, and I know I could not have made it with anyone else.\"\n\nHigh praise for the oft-heralded pair, but apparently well-deserved because as good as “Stomachaches” was, “Parachutes” blows it away, along with most other records released this year. I especially love “Veins! Veins!! Veins!!!” and its choir that counters Iero’s crazed rant. A Nirvana-tinged single, “I’m a Mess,” also stands out with steely, meaty hooks, but there’s plenty other great stuff worth checking out, such as the snotty cacophony of “The Resurrectionist, or an Existential Crisis in C” and the romantic shipwreck that is “Viva Indifference.”\n\nTwo Jersey bands I would love to see Iero perform with are Will Wood and the Tapeworms and Crazy & the Brains. The mania they could share would whip an adoring crowd into a frenzy. Perhaps some smart promoter will put that bill together in 2017, the beginning of which hopefully will feature a Patience tour with Taking Back Sunday. You can keep tabs at http://frank-iero.com/.\n\nREAD: More Makin Waves\n\nJERSEY JAMS\n\nVarious Artists / “Guitar Rebel” / Mint 400 (www.mint400records.com/)\n\nMint 400 Records' tribute to rockabilly and instrumental rock guitar great Link Wray is a treat, especially Fairmont’s loving take on the six-string slayer’s signature “Rumble.” Fairmont, which is fronted by Mint 400 label owner Neil Sabatino, also contribute fun versions of “Comanche” and “Hidden Charms.” The latter also features the label’s young guitar slinger Jack Skuller, already a seven-year veteran of the music industry at only 21. His “Slinky” also stands out.\n\nAlong with Fairmont, more than half of “Guitar Rebel” also is in the able hands of Worcester, Mass.-based garage-surf rock band Thee Sonomatics, whose “Hang On,” “Radar” and “Black Widow” are superb. They are the only band on the collection not on Mint 400. But mint offerings were procured from the label’s The One and Nines (“Run Chicken Run”), The Limbos (“The Swag”), and Zach Uncles (“Jack the Ripper,” “Fallin’ Rain”). Would love to see a show built around this record because it’s well worth bringing to life.\n\nCollective Man / “Nothing Can Kill Me” (https://collectiveman.bandcamp.com/releases)\n\nOn their 10-song debut LP, “Nothing Can Kill Me,” Montclair’s Collective Man are a solid salute to the two greatest times for music: the late ’60s and early ’90s. Equal parts Zeppelin and Soundgarden, P-Funk and Primus, Pink Floyd and Chili Peppers, Beatles and Tool, and Capt. Beefheart and Modest Mouse, heavy, psychedelic jams are laced with sweet poppies that shoot up through a grungy garden of grooves. If allowed, they simultaneously or alternatively will rattle the spine and tickle the mind.\n\nWhether being silly on “Gimme a Ring,” sincere on “Witches” or just plain weird on “Fancy,” Collective Man live up to their name by digging deep into the crate, and realize the title of their album by folding those influences into a legacy of their own. See them on Nov. 5 when they open for The Black Clouds at The Stone Pony, along with Experiment 34, The Yorkshire Tenth and The Obvious.\n\nJERSEY TALK\n\n​Thanks to everyone who made the first-ever Makin Waves Rock Circus Showcase on Oct. 22 at Roxy & Dukes in Dunellen a success, especially Jim Parks, Paul Grzella, Dave Siminoffi, Carolyn Sampson, Jamila Robinson, The Black Clouds, Will Wood and the Tapeworms, Experiment 34, The Production, Vivi Noir, Vertical Fixation, Weird NJ, MikeRoMedia, Live from the Dining Room, 90.3 the Core, Jersey Rock, Electric Ballroom, Rock on Radio, New Jersey Stage, NJArts.net, You Don't Know Jersey, Jeff Crespi, Michele Amabile Angermiller, Alliene Lee, Rebekah Makin, and all the great people at Roxy & Dukes.
