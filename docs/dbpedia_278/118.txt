Come and Get Me Motherfucker

Frank Iero’s Come and Get Me Motherfucker photo print from 2010? It’s a photo taken by Frank while working on what turned out to be Danger Days - it’s rumoured that it’s THE photo that gave the album’s concept away after being released as a photo print in a limited run of 200.

If you look closely, you can make out the words TRANS AM on the notepad. The photo prints were signed, stamped and embossed with what was called the MCR logo but then turned out to be Frank’s personal logo.
