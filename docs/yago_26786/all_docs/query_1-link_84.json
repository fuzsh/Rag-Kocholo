        "text": "Happy Independence Day to Comoros! Today we are exploring the country’s intriguing culture and environment.\n\nComoros is an island off the east coast of Africa with many exotic elements, including an active volcano, plants that smell like perfume, breathtaking scenery, and luscious beaches. This country is composed of 3 islands off the coast of Mozambique. Although there are four islands in the Comorian archipelago, one of them, Mayotte, is under the French, and is France’s poorest region. On July 6th, 1975, three of the islands, Grand Comore/N’Gazidja, Anjouan/Ndzuwani, and Mohéli/Mwali gained independence from France. The country’s capital is Moroni.\n\nDue to volcanic activity, these islands rose from the bottom of the Indian Ocean. The active volcano in the country, Mount Karthala, is located in Grand Comore and has erupted over 12 times in the last 200 years.\n\n(Anjouan, Comoros. Haryamouji, CC BY-SA 3.0, via Wikimedia Commons )\n\nArab, Persian, Malagasy, and Bantu speaking groups are the first-known inhabitants of Comoros. Today, most Comorians are a mixture of Arabic, African, Malagasy, and French backgrounds, and the language, culture, and food reflect the Creolized nature of the people. Traditional women in Comoros adorn their faces with ground sandalwood and coral.\n\nTwarab music is a popular art form in the country that originated in Zanzibar. Comorians use the Arab ud, and the violin in their Twarab music form.\n\nThis country has 3 official languages: Comorian, Arabic, and French. The indigenous Comorian language, spoken in different dialects, is called Shikomoro or Comorian and is a Swahili-related Bantu language that community members write in Arabic."
