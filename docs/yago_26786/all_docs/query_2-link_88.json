        "text": "Abstract\n\nFrench is only spoken by a quarter of the population in Madagascar and Comoros, primarily in urban and educated circles, while almost everyone uses Malagasy and Comorian. Both countries were once French colonies and experienced a troubled history after independence, which Madagascar gained in 1960 and Comoros in 1975. French serves as a co-official language besides Malagasy in mainly Christian Madagascar and besides Comorian and Arabic in mainly Muslim Comoros. It enjoys a privileged status in administration, education, written media, and literature. Malagasy and Comorian are used in parliament debates and audiovisual media, too, and Malagasy also appears in official texts, newspapers, literature, and as a taught subject. Malagasy and Comorian French show phonetic, morphosyntactic, and lexical particularities, which are better described for the former than for the latter, especially on the lexical level. Deviations from standard French are generally evaluated negatively but sometimes also seen positively. They do not only occur in oral communication but also in media and literature.\n\nReutner, Ursula, Heidepeter, Philipp and Chalier, Marc. \"32 Madagascar and Comoros\".
