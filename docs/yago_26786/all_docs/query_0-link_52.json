        "text": "Swahili Placement Testing Information\n\nView the Swahili courses available in spring 2022.\n\nAbout Swahili\n\nSwahili is spoken across East Africa. It is mostly spoken in Kenya and Tanzania as a national and official language. It is also used in Uganda, Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Comoros Islands. Smaller numbers of its speakers can be found in Rwanda, Burundi, Northern Zambia and parts of Mozambique.\n\nThe word for Swahili language is Kiswahili and belongs to the Bantu family of languages. The origin of the word Swahili comes from the plural “sawahili” of the Arabic word “sahil\" which means the coast. Swahili has been greatly influenced by Arabic in its vocabulary while its grammar and syntactic structure is purely of Bantu origin. The language also contains a few vocabularies that originates from German, Portuguese, Hindi, Persian, English and French\n\nThere are approximately 5 million Swahili speakers in the world who use it their native language. There are an additional 135 million people for whom Swahili is a second or third or foreign language. Swahili is recognized as one of the official languages of the African Union and is the official language of the East African Community.\n\nWhy Study Swahili at OHIO?\n\nToday, African languages like Swahili are more in demand than ever before as the world becomes more globalized.

Also, students who are working toward related certificates or degrees in International Studies can also take Swahili as part of their course requirements.\n\nStudents enrolled in Swahili courses are eligible for a number of opportunities such as scholarships, grants, and other funding related to language learning and travel. Some of these Swahili related funding opportunities include: the Gilman International Scholarship, the Boren Awards African languages Initiative Scholarships and Fellowships, the Critical Language Scholarship Program, FLAS Fellowships and the Group Projects Abroad Fulbright Hays Swahili Program.\n\nSwahili is one of the few languages that qualifies students for the Critical Languages Scholarship.
