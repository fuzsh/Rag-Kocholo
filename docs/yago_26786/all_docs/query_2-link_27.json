        "text": "Comorian (Shikomori, or Shimasiwa, the \"language of islands\") is the name given to a group of four Bantu languages spoken in the Comoro Islands, an archipelago in the southwestern Indian Ocean between Mozambique and Madagascar. It is named as one of the official languages of the Union of the Comoros in the Comorian constitution. Shimaore, one of the languages, is spoken on the disputed island of Mayotte, a French department claimed by Comoros.\n\nComorianshikomori Ø´ÙÙÙÙ ÙØ±ÙâNative toComoros and MayotteRegionThroughout Comoros and Mayotte; also in Madagascar and RÃ©union\n\nNative speakers\n\n800,000 in Comoros (2011)[1]\n\n300,000 in Mayotte (2007)[2][3]Arabic\n\nLatinOfficial status\n\nOfficial language in\n\nComorosLanguage codesISO 639-3Variously:\n\nzdj â Ngazidja dialect\n\nwni â Ndzwani (Anjouani) dialect\n\nswb âMaore dialect\n\nwlc â Mwali dialectGlottologcomo1260G.44[4]\n\nLike Swahili, the Comorian languages are Sabaki languages, part of the Bantu language family. Each island has its own language, and the four are conventionally divided into two groups: the eastern group is composed of Shindzuani (spoken on Ndzuani) and Shimaore (Mayotte), while the western group is composed of Shimwali (Mwali) and Shingazija (Ngazidja). Although the languages of different groups are not usually mutually intelligible, only sharing about 80% of their lexicon, there is mutual intelligibility between the languages within each group, suggesting that Shikomori should be considered as two language groups, each including two languages, rather than four distinct languages.[5]\n\nHistorically, the language was written in the Arabic-based Ajami script. The French colonial administration introduced the Latin script, of which a modified version was officially decreed in 2009.[6] Many Comorians now use the Latin script when writing the Comorian language although the Ajami script is still widely used, especially by women."
