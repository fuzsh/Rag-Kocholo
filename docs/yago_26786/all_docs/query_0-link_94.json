        "text": "Origin and dialects\n\nThe Arabic language comes from the Afro-Asian language family and has its origin on the Arabian peninsula. The oldest written records date from the fourth to the fifth century B.C.E. In addition to pure native speakers, Arabic is spoken by over 400 million people as a second or foreign language. It is thus one of the most widespread languages in the world. The Quran gave it a significance that lasted some 1,400 years, and it is used far beyond the borders of what was then Arabia.\n\nLike most languages, Arabic is divided into different dialects. The spread of Islam in the seventh and eighth centuries created numerous widely dispersed communities, which in turn modified the language over time or allowed influences of formerly regional languages. Often the dialects differ only slightly in the written forms, while being quite different in pronunciation. Great influence took, e.g., the Persian, Aramaic or Greek languages. In the last two centuries, many loan words from English and French were added. Some of the dialects are similar to each other in written form, but their pronunciation is not intelligible, even to native speakers of High Arabic. The geographical classification alone assumes more than two dozen dialects today.\n\nArabic script and alphabet\n\nThe Arabic script consists of 29 characters and consists only of consonants and long vowels. It is written from right to left. Similar to the Latin script, the Arabic script is a Kurrentschrift, i.e., a way of writing in which the pen is only rarely lifted and the letters are connected with each other. Due to this only slightly interrupted line management and the increasing number of letters over the course of time, from the 800th century C.E. onwards, additional dots were added above and below the consonants in order to distinguish them better from each other.\n\nA special feature of the Arabic script goes back to the prohibition of pictures in Islam: Instead of representing things pictorially, people shifted to writing and developed numerous beautiful scripts with sophisticated calligraphy. This gave rise to the elegant inscriptions on religious buildings."
