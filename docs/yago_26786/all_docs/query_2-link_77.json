        "text": "Speakers\n\nMoroccan Arabic is spoken by about 20,000,000 speakers in Morocco and in immigrant communities in Western Europe.\n\nAlgerian Arabic has 22,000,000 speakers in Algeria.\n\nTunisian Arabic has 9,000,000 speakers in Tunisia.\n\nLybian Arabic is spoken by 4,500,000 speakers mainly in Lybia but also in Egypt.\n\nEgyptian Arabic is spoken by 84,000,000 Egyptians and understood abroad thanks to Egyptian movies.\n\nNorth Levantine Arabic is spoken by about 15,000,000 Syrians and Lebaneses, whereas South Levantine is used by an additional 6,000,000 Jordanians, Palestinians and Israelis.\n\nNorth Mesopotamian Arabic is spoken by 6,300,000 speakers mostly in Iraq but also in Syria and Turkey.\n\nThe Hijazi dialect is spoken by 6,000,000 people in Saudi Arabia and the Nadji dialect is a spoken by a further 10,000,000 speakers mainly in Saudi Arabia.\n\nVariations\n\nYou can learn several Arabic languages:\n\nModern Standard Arabic is the most popular with foreign students. This is a modernized version of the litterrary Arabic. It is used throughout the Arabic world for newspapers and television. The trouble is that nobody speaks it outside of books and medias. People speak in colloquial Arabic. Educated Arabs will know it, but you'd probably end up speaking English or French with them.\n\nLitterary Arabic is the language used in the Quoran, the holy book of Muslims. This language is not spoken as it sounds a bit as Old English \"Thou Art in a Shoppe\". It is the most difficult of the three brands of Arabic to be learned. Unless you are a Muslim or a scholar, you will probably never study littterary Arabic.\n\nColloquial Arabic is the spoken language. It changes from country to country, although for example you can learn the Levantine dialect understood in Lebanon, Syria, Jordan and Palestine. These dialects are almost exclusively spoken, people using Modern Standard Arabic when writing.\n\nGoing from Litterary to Standard Arabic is not very difficult, and acquiring a colloquial dialect thereafter is mainly a problem of vocabulary learning.\n\nThere are many Arabic dialects ('Colloquial Arabic') spoken across the Arab world. Although the media uses the same Modern Standard Arabic everywhere, most Arabs will either speak in their own dialect or use French or Arabic. Dialects are slightly different from city to city and change from one country to another. You can, however, learn 'standard' dialects :\n\nGulf dialect is the closest to Classical or Modern Standard Arabic.\n\nLevantine dialect is spoken in Jordan, Palestine, Syria and Lebanon\n\nThe Egyptian dialect is the most spoken Arabic dialect and widely understood outside Egypt thanks to the popularity of Egyptian movies\n\nNorth African dialect spoken in the Maghreb (Tunisia, Algery and Morrocco)\n\nThe differences between those Arabic dialects are similar to the differences between Romance languages. This means they are very close to each other and by knowing one you can learn another easily. It is actually a better strategy to learn one Arabic dialect rather than trying to speak Modern Standard Arabic with people. Although most people nowadays understand Modern Standard Arabic, only a minority can actually converse in it and those who can just don't do it. They'd rather speak their own dialect, French or English than Standard Arabic."
