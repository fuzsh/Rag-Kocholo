        "text": "Even for a continent with 54 very different countries, Africa has a lot of languages. It is estimated that between 1,500 and 2,000 languages are spoken here, many with their own set of varying dialects. To make things even more confusing, in many countries the official language is not the same as the lingua franca – that is, the language spoken by the majority of its citizens.\n\nIf you're planning a trip to Africa, it's a good idea to research both the official language and the lingua franca of the country or region you're traveling to. That way, you can attempt to learn a few keywords or phrases before you go. This can be difficult – especially when a language isn't written phonetically (like Afrikaans), or includes click consonants (like Xhosa) – but making an effort will be greatly appreciated by the people you meet on your travels.\n\nIf you're traveling to an ex-colony (like Mozambique, Equatorial Guinea or Senegal), you'll find that European languages can also come in handy. However, be prepared for the Portuguese, Spanish or French that you hear there to sound quite different than it would in Europe. In this article, we look at the official and most widely spoken languages in every African country, from Algeria to Zimbabwe.\n\nAlgeria\n\nOfficial Languages: Modern Standard Arabic and Tamazight (Berber)\n\nThe most widely spoken languages in Algeria are Algerian Arabic and Berber.\n\nAngola\n\nOfficial Language: Portuguese\n\nPortuguese is spoken as a first or second language by just over 70% of the population.
