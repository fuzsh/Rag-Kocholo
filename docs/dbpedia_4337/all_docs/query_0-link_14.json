        "text": "Dearly Beloved (Out of the Garage)\n\nThe Dearly Beloved were a garage band out Tucson, Arizona which had their roots starting in 1963 when they were first known at the Intruders.\n\nOriginal Members:\n\nTom Walker – guitar\n\nTerry Lee – guitar\n\nShep Cooke – bass\n\nPete Schuyler – drums\n\nOther Members:\n\nRick Mellinger (drums)\n\nLarry Cox (vocals) deceased\n\nLike so many garage bands, the Dearly Beloved got their recording start by winning a Tucson battle of the bands. This led to a recording on Gallantry Records.\n\nThey eventually had to change their name due to the national popular group of Intruders out of Detroit and so it was “The Quinstrels”. A Tucson disk jockey coaxed them into yet another name change – one they were none too fond of – that being the “Dearly Beloved”. (It was taken from a novel that the DJ Dan Gates had spotted).\n\nGates promoted several Tucson area bands another being one called “The Grodes”.\n\nThe same jockey convinced them to record a song he had written which would be their debut single on the small Boyd record label. Before long, it was picked up for national distribution by Columbia records but failed to dent the national charts although it did rise to number 1 for several weeks in Tucson.\n\nThe band traveled to California in 1967 to open a concert for the Leaves (“Hey Joe”) and were in line to sign a contract with White Whale Records.\n\nThe Dearly Beloved headed back to Tucson after that concert needing to get home quick for band member Larry Cox’s wedding. Tragedy struck – Their car veered off the highway when the driver fell asleep – Larry was killed in the crash.\n\nThe White Whale deal fell through due to contract language stipulating that all signing members must remain with the band. Dearly Beloved moved on to Split Sound Records recording the last song Cox had composed “Merry Go Round”.\n\nThat was about it for the group – They soon broke up. The group did record several tracks for what they were certain would be a long play for Columbia but the label tabled the project.\n\nTom Walker went on to join a group called “Butterscotch” which evolved into “Jon Sorrow”. Walker also played with a country band called “Sunset Limited”. He passed away in July of 2007.\n\nShep Cooke would become a “Stone Poney” backing Linda Ronstadt. He then started up the “Floating House Band”. Terry Lee, Rick Mellinger and Pete Schuyler went their non-music career ways.\n\nDearly Beloved/Quinstrells/Discography\n\n45 – The Intruders – Let Me Stay b/w Every Time It’s You – 1964\n\n45 – Intruders – Then I’d Know b/w My Name – 1964\n\n45 – Intruders – Now She’s Gone b/w Why Me – 1965\n\n45 – Quinstrells – I Got A Girl b/w Tell Her – 1965\n\n45 – Beloved One’s – Peep Peep Pop Pop b/w It Is Better – July, 1966\n\n45 – Dearly Beloveds – Peep Peep Pop Pop b/w It Is Better – September, 1966\n\n45 – Dearly Beloved – Wait Till The Morning b/w You Ain’t Gonna Do What You Did To Him To Me – December, 1966\n\n45 – Dearly Beloved – Merry Go Round b/w Flight Thirteen – December, 1967\n\nLP – Floating House Band (Shep Cooke) – “The Floating House Band” – 1970\n\nLP U.S. – Shep Cooke – “Shep Cooke” – 1976\n\n45 EP – Shep Cooke – “Forever” – 1978\n\nLP U.S. – Shep Cooke – “Concert Tour Of Mars” – 1979\n\nLP U.S. – Dearly Beloved – “The Dearly Beloved” – 1985\n\nCD LP – The Intruders/Quinstrels/Dearly Beloved – Let’s Talk About Girls – Music From Tucson – 1964-1968 – 1997\n\nCD LP – The Intruders/Quinstrels/Dearly Beloved – Think Of The Good Times – The Tucson Sound ’60s Sound 1959-1968 – 2002\n\n45 – Italy – 1966"
