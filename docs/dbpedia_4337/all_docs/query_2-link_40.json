        "text": "It’s almost two years since I featured The Twyford Code by Janice Hallett on Linda’s Book Bag but I never actually got round to reading it. Consequently, when it appeared on the list of possible choices for the reading group to which I belong I simply had to choose it because I had so enjoyed Janice’s The Christmas Appeal (reviewed here).\n\nThe Twyford Code was published by Viper on 21st July 2022 and is available for purchase here.\n\nThe Twyford Code\n\nForty years ago, Steven Smith found a copy of a famous children’s book by disgraced author Edith Twyford, full of strange markings and annotations. Wanting to know more, he took it to his English teacher Miss Iles, not realising the chain of events that he was setting in motion. Miss Iles became convinced that the book was the key to a secret code that ran through all Twyford’s novels. Then she disappeared on a class field trip, and Steven has no memory of what happened to her.\n\nNow, out of prison after a long stretch, Steven decides to investigate the mystery that has haunted him for decades. Was Miss Iles murdered? Was she deluded? Or was she right about the code? And is it still in use today?\n\nBut as Steven revisits the people and places of his childhood, seeking answers, it soon becomes clear that Edith Twyford wasn’t just a writer of forgotten children’s stories. The Twyford Code has great power, and he isn’t the only one trying to solve it…\n\nMy Review of The Twyford Code\n\nSteve Smith has a mystery to solve.\n\nWhat an intriguing story! I’m not entirely sure quite what I’ve just read as The Twyford Code is part mystery and part thriller told through the eyes of a not entirely honest protagonist who can be somewhat economical with the truth, so that I feel I really need to reread the story immediately to discover all the clues laid out along the way that I missed the first time. This makes for a highly engaging and intriguing reading experience.\n\nI found The Twyford Code really fascinating. It’s sinuous in its twists and turns so that the truth of its layers of narrative only become fully clear right at the end. Janice Hallett proves herself to be disconcertingly skilled at sleight of hand and obfuscation. Reading The Twyford Code is akin to watching a skilled magician at work and I did need to suspend my disbelief at times – just as I would when watching someone apparently sawn in half by an illusionist.\n\nI loved the allusion to Enid Blyton, the references to other books and the concepts of World War Two, duplicity and international history that are threaded through the story. I found the transcripts an innovative and intriguing way to convey the narrative and was beguiled by the multiple time frames and the Agatha Christie style denouement. The fact that it is Steve’s illiteracy that means he has to record his story felt authentic and affecting. And it is Steve who is the huge success of the novel.\n\nWhat I hadn’t bargained for here is the depth of feeling engendered by injustice, by Steve Smith’s sad and neglected upbringing and the way justice is seen to be done but actually can be so wide of the mark that it made my blood boil. The Twyford Code may be an entertaining mystery, but it is also a social commentary that strips back how we are shaped and constructed by our lives. I was incredibly touched by Steve’s story.\n\nThe Twyford Code is deceptive and I suspect it may divide readers. It feels like a light-hearted Enid Blyton-esque romp with added murder but it has a depth that takes time to be uncovered. Whilst I enjoyed being duped and manipulated by the narrative, it was the people, the reminder of those I’ve taught who were just like Steve Smith and found themselves in prison too, that made the book successful for me. It was the why of the story as much as the what that engaged me and made me think and I really enjoyed it.\n\nAbout Janice Hallett\n\nJanice Hallett studied English at UCL, and spent several years as a magazine editor, winning two awards for journalism. After gaining an MA in Screenwriting at Royal Holloway, she co-wrote the feature film Retreat. The Appeal was inspired by her lifelong interest in amateur dramatics. Her second novel, The Twyford Code, was published by Viper in 2022 and The Mysterious Case of the Alperton Angels in 2023. The Examiner will be published in August 2024. When not indulging her passion for global adventure travel, she is based in West London.\n\nFor more information you can follow Janice on Twitter/X @JaniceHallett, or find her on Instagram.\n\nI can’t believe it’s over three years since lovely Julia Roberts last appeared on Linda’s Book Bag. Then I was reviewing My Mother’s Secret in a post you’ll find here. Now Julia has a brand new book out, My Daughter’s Lies, and I’m thrilled to be able to share an excerpt with you.\n\nPublished by Bookouture, My Daughter’s Lies is available for purchase here.\n\nMy Daughter’s Lies\n\nIn the middle of my beautiful daughter’s eighteenth birthday party, silence falls as I unfold my speech, my heart bursting with everything I want to say. But when I look down I see a note, and my world stops: She’s not who you think she is.\n\nRuby was our miracle baby. I would have done anything to become a mother, and when she finally arrived, I held her in my arms, looked in her blue eyes and swore I would never let anything harm her. Now she’s everything I could have dreamed of. I don’t even think about all the years of heartache I went through before she was born.\n\nSo when I get the strange warning at her birthday party, I ignore it, hiding it in my bag with trembling hands. Someone is simply jealous of her.\n\nBut as I watch my daughter, things I’ve been trying to ignore come flooding back to me – Ruby’s odd disappearances, her whispered arguments with her best friend, and a memory from her sixth birthday which still breaks my heart to remember.\n\nI need to know the truth about who she really is, but digging into my daughter’s secrets might reveal my own. As the party draws to a close and the confetti is swept away, I gather my courage. I’ve spent eighteen years trying to forget my own mistakes, and it could only take a moment for everything to fall apart.\n\nDo I risk tearing my family apart to keep my daughter safe? Because when my secrets come out, I could lose my precious girl forever…\n\nAn Excerpt from My Daughter’s Lies\n\n“What part of “I DON’T WANT A PARTY” did you two not get?’ Ruby demands.\n\nShe clearly has no intention of calming down and a quick glance in Steve’s direction tells me he is now almost as wound up as she is.\n\nThere have been very few arguments between the three of us over the years, but after a moment of shocked silence, Steve replies at a similar volume to Ruby. ‘We’ll speak to whoever the hell we like!’\n\nI now feel like a spectator as the two of them lock eyes, glinting dark with anger. I’m pretty sure Ruby wasn’t expecting that reaction from her normally placid dad, and to be honest neither was I.\n\n‘We’re your parents,’ he continues equally forcefully. ‘While you live under our roof, you’ll show us a bit of respect, young lady.’\n\n‘Respect is not a given, it’s earned,’ she flings back. ‘How can I respect people who clearly have such little regard for my feelings?’\n\nI’ve been holding back tears as I witness the spectacle of the two people I love most in the world hurling abuse at each other, but now they pour freely down my cheeks.\n\n‘Stop it!’ I scream, stunning them both into momentary silence.\n\nSteve starts towards me, but I hold my hands up, the palms facing outwards as though to push him away if he tries to come any closer.\n\n‘Let’s just forget it. If Ruby doesn’t want a party to celebrate her eighteenth birthday, that’s up to her.’\n\nHe examines my face intently, searching for my true feelings. It seems like an age but is probably only a fraction of a second before he turns away from me to face our daughter. ‘No, I’m not having that,’ he says, his voice more controlled but his anger still evident. ‘It might be your birthday, Ruby, but it’s also the day your mother gave you life. You have no idea what she went through before she finally became pregnant with you; the years of negative pregnancy tests, hormone injections, miscarriages, until, when she had long since given up hope of having the one thing she craved more than anything in the world, she finally conceived you; our little miracle.’\n\nMy chest tightens at the words ‘our little miracle’. Ruby is not the only one who has no idea of the lengths I went to in my efforts to become pregnant. My breath is coming in shallow gasps, and although I’ve never previously experienced a panic attack, I fear I’m about to have one.\n\nRuby’s cheeks start to colour, but my normally mild-mannered husband hasn’t finished.\n\n‘She endured thirty-six hours of torturous labour,’ he continues, emotion now fuelling his anger, ‘before conceding that she would need to have an emergency caesarean section because your life was in danger.’\n\nRuby is gripping the edge of the table, and her eyes are filling with tears. I want Steve to stop, but he clearly isn’t done yet.\n\n‘She literally bears the scars of giving birth to you and you want to deny her the chance to celebrate your coming of age because of something that happened twelve years ago and was totally beyond our control? The volume of his voice is increasing with every word. ‘I thought we’d raised a nicer human being than that. You’re pathetic! No, I take that back,’ he rages. ‘You’re selfish and cruel.’\n\nSteve has gone too far, but before I can voice my opinion he slams out of the room, leaving silence in his wake, only broken by Ruby’s sobs.”\n\n****\n\nI don’t know about you, but I have a feeling things are not going to go well! My Daughter’s Lies sounds brilliant!\n\nAbout Julia Roberts\n\nJulia was born in West Bridgford, Nottinghamshire, and began her career as a professional singer/dancer. This enabled her to travel the world in her late teens storing up experiences she has since included in her writing.\n\nFollowing roles as a hostess on The Price is Right and a member of the Beadle’s About ‘hit squad’ in the 1980s, she became a TV Presenter and filmed features for Sky Sports before launching the QVC shopping channel in 1993 where she still presents today. Having always wanted to write, she penned her first book, a memoir sold on QVC, in 2013 and has since written seven full length novels, two novellas and several short stories.\n\nYou can follow Julia on Twitter/X @JuliaRobertsTV and visit her website. You’ll also find her on Instagram and Facebook.\n\nLife has been rather complicated of late and I’m struggling to fit in everything I’d like to, but I simply couldn’t let publication day for Allie Cresswell’s Salad Days go unmarked. You see, Allie has always been so generous to me as a reader, sending me copies of her books with no expectation that I’ll review, but just hoping I’ll enjoy reading them.\n\nAllie also provided a super guest post about mature characters when her book Widow’s Weeds was published that you’ll find here. Consequently, the least I can do is bring Allie’s new book, Salad Days to your attention – especially as it sounds fantastic.\n\nAvailable in ebook too, Salad Days is published in paperback today, 7th June 2024, and is available for purchase here.\n\nSalad Days\n\n“My earliest memory is of you, Arthur. We were children, running across the garden at Granny’s house. The sun on your hair made it look like copper wire. Then you stopped, and I cannoned into you. We both went headlong into the rockery. It was 1964, the summer before I started school, so I was nearly five. You would have been just three.\n\nIt’s strange, isn’t it? That my first memory is of you. Or maybe it isn’t very strange at all.”\n\nPrudence and Arthur take a nostalgic trip down memory lane to the sixties and seventies; turbulent, changeful years that contrasted with their idyllic childhood at ‘Salad Days,’ the market garden run by Prue’s extended family.\n\nBut was it idyllic? Tragedy makes uneasy waypoints in their journey of recollection, and Arthur’s overbearing father casts a dark pall. How did he inveigle himself into Prue’s close-knit family circle? What was his hold on them?\n\nAs Prue and Arthur retrace their youthful attempts to get to the facts, it’s clear that truth and memory aren’t always the same.\n\nWhat of the mysteries that defy the clarity of hindsight? The uncanny auspices of eccentric Mrs Glenister, latest in the line of ‘peculiar’ Glenister wives—why did she only materialise at times of calamity? And most oddly of all, why, in all their reminiscing, does Arthur never speak a word?\n\nMemory is a curious thing—unreliable and awkward. Shaping it into an account Prue and Arthur can both live with might take a lifetime. Or two.\n\n***\n\nDoesn’t that sound completely brilliant? I love the way the cover has a slightly indistinct quality, rather like the unreliable quality of memory explored in Salad Days. I think this sounds a very special book.\n\nAbout Allie Cresswell\n\nAllie Cresswell is the recipient of two coveted One Stop Fiction Five Star Awards and three Readers’ Favorite Awards\n\nAllie was born in Stockport, UK and began writing fiction as soon as she could hold a pencil.\n\nShe went on to do a BA in English Literature at Birmingham University and an MA at Queen Mary College, London.\n\nShe has been a print-buyer, a pub landlady, a book-keeper, and has run a B & B and a group of boutique holiday cottages. Nowadays Allie writes full time having retired from teaching literature to lifelong learners.\n\nShe has two grown-up children, two granddaughters and two grandsons, is married to Tim and lives in Cumbria.\n\nFor further information, visit Allie’s website, or follow Allie on Twitter/X @Alliescribbler, Facebook and Instagram.\n\nIt’s just over a year since lovely Emma Cowell stayed in with me to chat about The House in the Olive Grove in a post you can find here. Today, not only do I welcome Emma back to Linda’s Book Bag to tell me about her latest release, but there’s a wonderful giveaway for you too!\n\nLet’s find out more:\n\nStaying in with Emma Cowell\n\nWelcome back to Linda’s Book Bag Emma and thank you for agreeing to stay in with me once more.\n\nThank you for inviting me back! Did the baklava I baked last time that helped secure a return visit?!\n\nIt did indeed – that and the wonderful books! I rather think I know, but tell me, which of your books have you brought along to share this evening and why have you chosen it?\n\nI’ve brought along The Island Love Song– my third novel! It still feels strange to say that and I’m not sure how I’ve written three, and in the middle of drafting my fourth. But I feel very lucky to be living a dream and I wouldn’t be able to without the support of the readers and amazing bloggers like you, so thank you.\n\nIt’s always a pleasure to support authors Emma! And I understand today is The Island Love Song publication day, so congratulations.\n\nThe Island Love Song also marks another step away from how it all began with my first novel, One Last Letter From Greece, which was inspired by the death of my darling Mum. I so wish she was here to see everything that’s happened. Sorry to put a downer on the evening- I’m pouring you a shot of ouzo!\n\nThat’s not a downer Emma. Of course you should remember your Mum. I’m sure she would be very proud of you. Let’s drink a toast to her.\n\nWhat can we expect from an evening in with The Island Love Song?\n\nIt’s a story about love and family, which I’ve realised are unintentional themes in all my novels so far- though the stories are all unconnected. It’s about two sisters- Ella and Georgia- and their journey to an island called Hydra in Greece to scatter their mother’s ashes. But their relationship is strained to say the least! They’re both hiding secrets, hiding from themselves and from their past. All their troubles bubble up to the surface against a backdrop of blissful Greek paradise. They are both very different. Georgia is one of those women who plan and try to control everything so much that they forget to have fun. Ella is carefree with no urge to settle down, she lives out of a suitcase and follows her creativity wherever it takes her. There’s also a love song that has haunted Ella for decades. It was written about her by the man who broke her heart, and she has tried to escape it, but she can’t. The island forces them to confront their demons and face the truth… it isn’t all sunshine and crystal clear blue waters, but there’s a sweeping love story in there too.\n\nThat sounds gorgeous. I’m so glad I have The Island Love Song on my TBR pile.\n\nWhat else have you brought along and why have you brought it?\n\nLast time I inflicted the husky sounds of Leonard Cohen on you, so you’ll be thrilled to know I have my playlist that I wrote the book to. It has become part of my process to create a soundtrack, choose a candle and make a mood board to transport me into the world I’ve created. It’s filled with some of the greatest love songs- in my humble opinion- ever written. For the audiobook version of The Island Love Song, I wrote three original songs as music is an important part of the novel and such an integral part of my life- I couldn’t be without it.\n\nWow! As someone tone deaf I find that amazing!\n\nThe song that Ella is trying to avoid is one of those iconic songs that gets used for weddings, funerals and christenings, like Angels by Robbie Williams or Something by George Harrison- my personal favourite love song. Do you have a favourite, Linda?\n\nIt’s so hard to choose a favourite song but I think probably Love is the Drug by Roxy Music as I am somewhat obsessed with Bryan Ferry – I’ll make you look at my photos of me with him later!\n\nAnd of course, I’ve cooked Greek food for you which features heavily in all my writing.\n\nI was hoping you might say that!\n\nI’ve made a very simple dish of roasted vegetables- tomatoes, aubergine, onions, and courgettes with herbs, a little lemon and a sprinkling of capers- it’s my twist on a dish called Briam. Served with a classic Greek salad of course.\n\nThat sounds delicious…\n\nAnd there’s pudding…I’ve made Portokalopita which is the most delicious orange cake that I discovered in Greece years ago. It’s a light orange flavoured sponge, though the Greeks call it a pie, and is covered in a sweet orange and cinnamon syrup glaze and is absolute heaven. It’s mentioned somewhere in all of my books. I can’t go to Greece and not have a slice or four!\n\nYou might have to fight me for that actually…\n\nI also love that my readers have sought out some of the dishes featured in my stories and they send me pictures of their home cooking or taverna orders.\n\nHow brilliant.\n\nAnd before I go, I’d also like a re-match of our Backgammon tournament we had last time we stayed in…the dice weren’t kind to me then, but I’m always hopeful that luck may turn in my favour….\n\nI think they might be Emma.

That’s most definitely the case with Anne Montgomery’s new novel. However, I am delighted to find out more by staying in with Anne today.\n\nLet’s see what Anne told me:\n\nStaying in with Anne Montgomery\n\nWelcome to Linda’s Book Bag Anne. Thank you for agreeing to stay in with me.\n\nI’m happy to be here, Linda.\n\nTell me, which of your books have you brought along to share this evening and why have you chosen it?\n\nYour Forgotten Sons is my new novel that will be released on June 6, 2024, which is the 80th Anniversary of D-Day. The story details the life of Bud Richardville who was assigned to the Graves Registration Service during World War II where soldiers were tasked with locating, identifying, and burying the dead.\n\nHappy publication day for tomorrow Anne. That sounds like quite a task for the Graves Registration Service. What can we expect from an evening in with Your Forgotten Sons?\n\nBud’s story came to me in a strange way. I’d travelled to Baltimore at the request of a dear friend. She was facing a delicate, possibly life-changing surgery at Johns Hopkins Hospital and asked that I stand in as her healthcare power of attorney.\n\nThe night before the operation, Gina, handed me a Ziplock bag. Inside I found a packet of yellowed letters. We’d spoken of Gina’s elusive uncle—her mother’s handsome, rakish brother—on occasion over the years, and of the odd circumstances surrounding his death near the end of World War II.\n\nI followed Bud’s trail through the postmarks—dates and locations—on those letters and travelled with him from England, to the beaches of Normandy, to the Battle of the Bulge and beyond.\n\nI learned that those who served in the Graves Registration Service had arguably the toughest job in the military and that they rarely, if ever, got credit for their efforts.\n\nWow. That sounds like a brilliant catalyst for the novel. It has me completely intrigued.\n\nWhat else have you brought along and why have you brought it?\n\nWhen I think about Bud, I sometimes hear the popular music of the time. Big Band songs that young people danced to. Swing music with horns blaring. I can see Bud as he was before the war. He was easy-going and happy. People liked him, especially women. I’m guessing he could be a charmer. But war with its relentless cruelties beat him down.\n\nI imagine Bud’s experience was one so many went through. Thanks so much for staying in with me to chat about Your Forgotten Sons Anne. Happy publication day for tomorrow.\n\nYour Forgotten Sons\n\nBud Richardville is inducted into the Army as the United States prepares to enter World War II in 1943.\n\nA chance comment has Bud assigned to the Graves Registration Service, where his unit is tasked with locating, identifying, and burying the dead. Bud ships out, leaving behind his new wife, Lorraine: a mysterious woman who has stolen his heart but whose shadowy past leaves many unanswered questions.\n\nWhen Bud and his men hit the beach at Normandy, they are immediately thrust into the horrors of what working in a graves unit entails. Bud is beaten down by the gruesome demands of his job and losses in his personal life, but then he meets Eva, an optimistic soul who despite the war can see a positive future. Will Eva’s love be enough to save him?\n\nPublished by Next Chapter on 6th June 2024, Your Forgotten Sons is available for purchase online in all the usual places including here.\n\nAbout Anne Montgomery\n\nAnne Butler Montgomery has worked as a television sportscaster, newspaper and magazine writer, teacher, author, and amateur sports official.

It’s my absolute pleasure to share that review today.\n\nA Woman of Intrigue will be published by Mills and Boon in paperback on 6th June 2024 and is available for pre-order through the links here.\n\nA Woman of Intrigue\n\nScandals, seduction and secrets… and one woman’s quest to uncover the truth. The most intriguing historical romance of 2024, perfect for fans of Bridgerton.\n\nWallflower Lady Mary Montagu Douglas Scott has a secret. Moving effortlessly unnoticed amongst the ballrooms and palaces of Queen Victoria, her sharp intelligence and keen powers of observation allow her to quietly solve society crimes – coming to the rescue of those whose pride and fortune are at stake.\n\nOverlooked and underestimated, Mary finds missing money, recovers stolen jewellery and saves reputations. When she meets Colonel Walter Trefusis, an unlikely and spirited alliance is formed. But Mary has more than met her match in her sleuthing partner. As she battles the expectations of society and her family, Mary must follow her heart – whatever the cost…\n\nMy Review of A Woman of Intrigue\n\nLady Mary Montague Douglas Scott is not quite the wallflower she might appear!\n\nWhat a super story. I must say at the outset that I’m hugely impressed by the openness with which Sarah Ferguson acknowledges the input to A Woman of Intrigue from her writing partner Marguerite Kaye. Between the two authors they have blended both real and imagined characters and events into an entertaining, compelling and really interesting narrative.\n\nThe plot of A Woman of Intrigue is totally engaging because there’s lots of action, a tantalising physical attraction between Mary and Tre, and considerable intrigue, mystery and crime to capture the imagination. Indeed, I think there’s huge scope for more adventures featuring Mary and Tre.\n\nThe historical detail and the depiction of Victorian society are so well drawn that they place the reader right in the era. Balanced by Tre’s affliction that places him just slightly at a tangent to polite society, there’s a realism that I found truly refreshing. I thoroughly enjoyed the references to food, to gardening and to the running of large, wealthy households as well as the more prosaic aspects of life and the depiction of how lower classes live. Every aspect felt really vivid.\n\nI thought Mary was a wonderful character. She is determined, principled and adventurous. I so appreciated the way Sarah Ferguson avoids making her a constrained, simpering woman of heaving bosom and the vapours, so typical of her class and upbringing. Instead, she is quite prepared to put pragmatism before romance, and to identify what she wants for herself in a modern and feminist manner, rather than allow herself to be drawn into marriage as might be expected of her. This makes A Woman of Intrigue relevant to today’s society as well as an engaging historical read.\n\nSimilarly, although he is physically attractive, Tre is also not cliched. His physical affliction arising out of mental trauma is sensitively handled, realistic and makes him feel modern and appealing. His attitude towards Mary, respecting her autonomy, makes him all the more charismatic.\n\nThe more minor characters such as Charlotte and Louisa are also entertaining and interesting because they add texture to the story. It’s wonderful to discover older characters in historical fiction of this kind who find a new lease of life.\n\nNot being a fan of ‘celebrity’ books I confess that I began reading A Woman of Intrigue without great expectations. I was proved totally wrong. A Woman of Intrigue is a cracker of a read. It has a fast paced, interesting and exciting plot. It has rounded, engaging characters. It depicts the era, the roles of men and women and the sense of history with elan. A Woman of Intrigue entertains brilliantly and I thought it was such a smashing read.\n\nAbout Sarah Ferguson, Duchess of York\n\nSunday Times bestselling author Sarah Ferguson, Duchess of York, is also a bestselling memoirist and children’s book author, film producer, and has been a spokesperson for Weight Watchers and Wedgwood china.

T. Shearer last November when The Cat Who Solved Three Murders came out in hardback. You’ll find that post here.\n\nToday, in advance of the paperback release of The Cat Who Solved Three Murders, I’m delighted finally to share my review.\n\nThe Cat Who Solved Three Murders is published by Macmillan in paperback on 20th June 2024 and is available for purchase through the links here.\n\nThe Cat Who Solved Three Murders\n\nConrad the cat detective and retired police detective Lulu Lewis travel to Oxford on their canal boat and investigate a case of art theft in a grand country manor house.\n\nRetired police detective Lulu Lewis’s life changed forever when she met a street cat named Conrad. There’s something very special about Conrad, but it’s a secret she has to keep to herself.\n\nWhen Lulu takes her narrowboat to Oxford, she is planning nothing more stressful than attending a friend’s birthday party. And drinking a few glasses of Chardonnay.\n\nBut a brutal murder and a daring art theft means her plans are shattered – instead she and Conrad find themselves on the trail of a killer. A killer who may well strike again.\n\nMy Review of The Cat Who Solved Three Murders\n\nLulu and Conrad have a second case to solve.\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed The Cat Who Solved Three Murders. The premise of a talking cat, Conrad, acting as a detective is utterly bonkers, and yet it really works. In a sense, although Conrad is a physical Calico cat, he perhaps represents ex-Detective Lulu’s inner monologue so that he is a kind of sounding board for her theories and conclusions. Whatever the manifestation of Conrad, the story works highly entertainingly. It doesn’t matter at all that this is the second in LT Shearer’s Conrad the Cat Detective series, as Lulu’s back story and the reasons why she lives on a narrow boat with Conrad are skilfully woven into the narratives so that the story can be enjoyed completely independently.\n\nAs Lulu and Conrad investigate a burglary and killing at Lulu’s friend Julia’s home, the plot is full of action, crime and murder. It is pacy, engaging and interesting. The Cat Who Solved Three Murders is an excellent example of the current trend in cosy crime, but with a talking cat it has the edge of novelty too, so that it feels just a little bit different and all the better for it.\n\nThe setting is so clever because the majority of it takes place at Julia’s home so that the reader gets a real sense of the grandeur and scale of the mansion. I loved the descriptions of the rooms. It’s so easy to picture where the action happens as there is a filmic quality to the descriptions.\n\nThe narrative might feel essentially light in tone and an easy, diverting read, but there are deceptively deep themes too. The Cat Who Solved Three Murders contemplates friendship, family, marriage, loyalty and revenge. There’s a blurring of morality in doing the right thing for the wrong reason and the wrong thing for the right, or at least understandable, reasons. Lulu struggles with her conscience at times and through her conversations with Conrad we discover that choices are not always clear cut.\n\nIs The Cat Who Solved Three Murders the finest literary fiction I’ve ever read? Well, no. But it is extremely well plotted, absorbing and brilliantly entertaining. It would make a wonderful television series and I had a super time reading it. For those who want a well thought out narrative with an innovative extra in Conrad, The Cat Who Solved Three Murders is an absolute must read. I thought it was great!\n\nAbout L.T. Shearer\n\nL T Shearer has had a lifelong love of canal boats and calico cats, and both are combined in The Cat Who Caught a Killer, a one-of-a-kind debut crime novel which continues with The Cat Who Solved Three Murders.\n\nFor further information, find L.T. Shearer on Facebook.\n\nGiven that M.W. Craven is one of my favourite crime writers, when a surprise copy of his latest Washington Poe book, The Mercy Chair, arrived some months ago I could hardly contain my excitement. My enormous thanks go to Beth Wright at Little Brown for sending me a copy. It’s my absolute pleasure to share my review of The Mercy Chair today.\n\nYou’ll find my reviews of Mike’s other Washington Poe books here.\n\nThe Mercy Chair will be published by Little Brown imprint Century on 6th June 2024 and is available for purchase through the links here.\n\nThe Mercy Chair\n\nAre you sitting comfortably? Then I’ll begin . . .\n\nWashington Poe has a story to tell.\n\nAnd he needs you to listen.\n\nYou’ll hear how it started with the robber birds. Crows. Dozens of them. Enough for a murder . . .\n\nHe’ll tell you about a man who was tied to a tree and stoned to death, a man who had tattooed himself with a code so obscure, even the gifted analyst Tilly Bradshaw struggled to break it. He’ll tell you how the man’s murder was connected to a tragedy that happened fifteen years earlier when a young girl massacred her entire family.\n\nAnd finally, he’ll tell you about the mercy chair. And why people would rather kill themselves than talk about it . . .\n\nPoe hopes you’ve been paying attention. Because in this story, nothing is as it seems . . .\n\nMy Review of The Mercy Chair\n\nThere’s a man in therapy.\n\nI don’t think I’m going to be able to review The Mercy Chair. I’m sitting here stunned, trying to process what I’ve just read. The Mercy Chair is a magnificent crime thriller and really, all that there is to say is ‘Buy the book.’ Although The Mercy Chair can be read as a compelling stand alone with sufficient back story to Poe and Bradshaw uncovered by the presence of Linus, I’d urge readers to start from the beginning of the series, so that the emotional impact has all the more power. There are too many books published for me to bother with a series normally, but M.W. Craven’s Washington Poe books are ones I’d never miss. I have absurdly high expectations of the series and the multi-layered The Mercy Chair is, I think, the best yet.\n\nThe plot is sensationally good. With trademark short, pacy chapters, a real sense of place, witty dialogue and numerous cliff hangers and twists, M.W. Craven builds and builds the tension so that the story is enthralling and mesmerising. This is one of those stories that genuinely removes all free will from the reader. Certainly it’s a police thriller, but it has the added mystery of what Linus is there for, as well as Poe’s condition and how that came to be, making it all the more absorbing. Even given the breaks I needed to recover my equilibrium at what I was reading, I consumed The Mercy Chair over two days because I could not put it down. Meals, conversations – indeed, all normal life – were put on hold until I’d finished it. I’m not going to say anything further about the plot as I don’t want inadvertently to reveal anything, except to say that I don’t think I’ve ever been more successfully manipulated by a writer and I was certainly listening carefully! I thought the narrative was outstanding. I am, however, outraged and aghast too and desperate for the another book, but you need to read The Mercy Chair to find out why, and why I cried!\n\nIt’s also quite difficult to say too much about themes in The Mercy Chair because they are so intricately connected to the plot. There’s family, loyalty, relationships, religion, extremism, mental health, sexuality and so much more here. Each aspect is incorporated with mature understanding and is written about vividly, terrifyingly and convincingly. The Mercy Chair reverberates through the reader’s mind.\n\nAs in the other fabulous books in the series, the relationship between Washington Poe and other characters, especially Tilly Bradshaw, is riveting. I love the way Poe has evolved as a person over the series as a result of his interaction with Tilly and Estelle and yet he is still absolutely the curmudgeonly, tenacious Poe we expect, admire and love. I find it hard to accept that Poe is a fictional character and not a real person because he is so realistically depicted. Tilly, too, is simply wonderful and although in this story she is less present than Poe, her importance in forwarding the story, introducing light relief and adding emotional depth cannot be exaggerated.\n\nI am fully aware I’ve said nothing tangible about The Mercy Chair. When you’ve read it for yourself, and read it you must, you’ll see why I say it is going straight on my list of books of the year for 2024. Often brutal, surprisingly sensitive, totally brilliant and utterly captivating, The Mercy Chair must not be missed. I cannot recommend it highly enough. I thought it was fabulous.\n\nAbout M.W. Craven\n\nMulti-award winning author M. W. Craven was born in Carlisle but grew up in Newcastle. He joined the army at sixteen, leaving ten years later to complete a social work degree.
