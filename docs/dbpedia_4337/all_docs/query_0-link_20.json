        "text": "hey, I'm listening to his 1st album ( closing time ) and it sounds like a totally different person singing...once in a while there is an inflection of what he sounds like on all the other albums\n\nbut what the heck happened to change his voice to what it's been like since then?\n\nor is it all just a put-on? haha\n\nbtw I dig this album...big warm, well produced tunes.\n\nthx\n\nI remember reading that he purposefully screamed repeatedly into a pillow to screw up his voice. I have no idea if that's true or now... I mean, I'm sure he got to the point where he thought, \"it's getting rough, why not take it to the extreme?\" I can't see how whiskey and cigarettes would alone be enough to get him where he is today... he would have died of cancer or liver failure if he smoked and drank that much!\n\nI believe Tom enrolled in the Keef Richards Academy of Progressive Vocal Rot!\n\n(no books are needed, but prerequistes for the school are showing up for the first class wth a bottle of Jack Daniels and box of cigarettes - Marlboros or unfiltered Camels/ Old Gold preferred)\n\nCompare Keith's \"You Got the Silver\" '69 or \"Happy\" '72 to Keef's recent warblings like \"The Nearness of You\" and you can see how well the master progressed!\n\nwell, I think I found some info on the backing musicians....\n\nfrom http://www.keeslau.com/TomWaitsSupplement/Timeline/1949-1975.htm\n\nIn The Alley flier mentioning Tom Waits opening for The Floating House Band. Dave Robinson: \"In The Alley was a great music club in Escondido, a town about 40 miles northeast of San Diego. Tom opened for a group called The Floating House Band, a trio of former members of The Stone Ponies who were left behind when Linda Ronstadt went solo. Shep Cooke was one of the members of TFHB - he later played and sang on \"Closing Time\". Who knows? Maybe this gig is when Tom and Shep first met.\"\n\nStart tour promoting Closing Time April 1973 - August 1974 (album released March, 1973). 1973 shows - Tom Waits: vocals, acoustic guitar, piano. Bob Webb: standup bass. Rich Phelps: trumpet. John Forsha: guitar. 1974 shows - Tom Waits solo: vocals, acoustic guitar, piano. Further reading: Performances 1949-1975\n\nI saw some audience video footage of a recent UK show, and it looked like an incredible show.\n\nI love his voice, then and now. It is style, but it's necessary. I'm always indifferent when I hear \"real singers\" cover his material. I just can't seperate the two... that voice and those songs go hand in hand.\n\nI agree with John Moschella, this difference is basically a stylistic choice. You can hear Waits experimenting with the gravelly thing starting with his next album, \"The Heart of Saturday Night.\" He gradually got more and more interested in what that timber could express. It's in first full bloom on \"Small Change,\" but he kept on pushing and begain really going to its extremities on the early Island albums and later as he also began to use precessing and distortion in the recording to extend it even further. Now of course he he's at or over the very edge of it. I thought he had gone as far as he could in the direction on \"Bone Machine.\" On \"Mule Variations\" and the two subsequent sets for Robert Wilson productions, he occilates between that extreme and his softer singing styles. Of course, \"Real Gone\" is exactly that. Complete indulgence in the extreme sound and what it can still do. And not just in the vocals, but as the basic elements of the rythmic arrangements. I'm not sure yet what I think about it, but there are undeniable moments of power. I think the quip about Sinatra was right on: Rich and powerful, just not in the usual sense.\n\nL."
