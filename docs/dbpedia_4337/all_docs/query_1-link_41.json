        "text": "Ultra-Rare Tucson, Arizona (AZ) 1966 Garage 45\n\nIntruders (AKA Quinstells AKA Dearly Beloved)\n\nNow She's Gone / Why Me\n\nMOXIE M. R. C.-104\n\nVG+ condition, nice copy with some surface scuffs and a few tiny pressing dots!\n\nOne in a seemingly endless parade of garage bands to gig and record under the Intruders aegis, this particular act formed in Tucson, AZ, in 1963 -- originally comprised of guitarists Tom Walker and Terry Lee, bassist Shep Cooke, and drummer Pete Schuyler, the band started out playing Ventures-inspired instrumental surf covers, but following the onslaught of the British Invasion added a vocalist,Larry Cox. After winning a Tucson battle of the bands contest, the Intruders were awarded a record deal -- the \"recording studio\" turned out to be gear installed in their benefactor's living room, but nevertheless their debut single, \"Every Time It's You,\" appeared on the Gallant label in 1964.\n\nBy this time they rivaled the Grodes for the unofficial title of Tucson's most popular local band, and two more singles -- \"Then I'd Know\" and \"Now She's Gone\" -- followed on manager Dan Peters' Moxie label before pressure from a Detroit act also called the Intruders prompted a switch to the Quinstrells. Under this name the group issued a third Moxie single, \"I Got a Girl,\" before local disc jockey Dan Gates of station KTKT influenced another name change, this time to the Dearly Beloved. Gates also convinced them to record his song, \"Peep Peep Pop Pop,\" booking studio time at Phoenix's Audio Sound Recorders studio -- first issued on the New Mexico-based Boyd label in 1966, the label mistakenly credited the Beloved Ones, but the song nevertheless topped Tucson radio play lists throughout the summer months. This regional success resulted in a contract with major label Columbia and a national re-release of \"Peep Peep Pop Pop,\" this time correctly credited to the Dearly Beloved -- the single fell just shy of the Billboard Hot 100, and the group soon traveled to Los Angeles to record their first LP, cutting 20 songs over the course of three days. Only a single, \"Wait Till Mornin',\" ever saw official release -- Columbia shelved the rest of the tapes, and a frustratedSchuyler soon resigned, with Grodes drummer Rick Mellinger signing on as his replacement.\n\nWhile on a return trip to L.A. to open for the Leaves, the Dearly Beloved were spotted by representatives from the White Whale label, resulting in a contract offer. However, because Cox's wedding was scheduled to take place in Tucson the following morning, the band was forced to return home immediately following the gig, leaving L.A. at 3:00 a.m. and taking turns behind the wheel. Tragically, the driver fell asleep and the car crashed, killing Cox instantly. His death voided the White Whale contract before the ink was even dry, as terms dictated that the lineup remain intact. Before his passing, Cox wrote \"Merry Go Round,\" a gripping song about death made all the more eerie by his tragic demise -- the single appeared on the Splitsound label in 1967, with singer Jim Perry stepping into the frontman role for the session.\n\nSoon after, Cooke resigned to join Linda Ronstadt in her band the Stone Poneys, and the Dearly Beloved gradually dissolved -- their classic recordings were compiled in 1984 on Rough Diamonds: The History of Garage Band Music, Vol. 6. Cooke additionally recorded a pair of solo LPs for Vanguard.\n\nPlease check out my other auctions this week for more great records!\n\n______________________________________________________________________________\n\nPayment:\n\nPayment is due within 7 days of auction close.

These records are generally presumed to be mint, but that may not always be the case due to manufacturing defects, sleeve scuffing and minor warping. For these reasons I am unable to guarantee the condition of the record inside and sealed records are non-returnable if opened.\n\nM (Mint) – A perfect and seemingly unplayed record. This is the highest grade I will give a record that is not sealed and I use it rarely.\n\nNM (Near Mint) – A like-new record with only the slightest evidence that it has ever been played or handled.\n\nEX (Excellent) – Close to like-new with only very minor indicators of use that will not affect playback. EX records should satisfy all but the most critically demanding audiophiles. Covers will be very sharp with only slight imperfections.\n\nVG+ (Very Good Plus) – Used but well-taken care-of records that will exhibit only minor defects. VG+ records may show signs of wear including, but not limited to scuffing, minor scratches, slight warps, spindle marks, light ring wear, cutouts or other markings, and minor seam wear on covers and labels. VG+ records are great copies for all but the most discerning listeners.\n\nVG (Very Good) – Average, well-used records that still sound good enough for the majority of listeners to enjoy. These records will usually play with some surface noise from scratches, scuffs, and groove wear. They may lack the gloss of cleaner, factory-fresh records and can have scratches and visible groove wear. Covers will show conisderable signs of handling or storage, and may have writing, tears, seam splits and other wear.\n\nGood -- These records are not trashed, but will play back with considerable noise due to serious wear and scratches. They should not skip, but this may depend on turntable setup. Covers in this condition may show heavy wear but are not trashed. Tape, fully split seams, heavy writing and tears are common.\n\nFair & Poor -- These are basically \"play-at-your-own-risk\" which are in very rough condition all around and have been neglected or abused.\n\nI may amend a grade with a plus (+) or minus (-) indicating that the record is slightly better or worse than one of the standard grades but I do not use multiple plus or minus signs.\n\nFor example, a record that is somewhere between the two grades could be EX+ or NM- depending on which grade more accurately represents the perceived condition.\n\n______________________________________________________________________________\n\nReturn Policy & Feedback:\n\nYou are guaranteed to receive the item as described, otherwise all sales are final.\n\nJustifiable returns are fully refundable aside from shipping costs within 7 days of delivery, unless otherwise indicated. Buyers are responsible for return postage.\n\nIf there should be any problem with your item please contact me before you leave feedback.
