        "text": "Cuckoo Accordion\n\nAntiques give history context and history gives antiques context.\n\nLook what I stumbled on in Wonny. A cousin of my Cuckoo mouth organ, a diatonic button accordion where bellows blow the air over the reeds. It certainly would have seen better days, but its condition made it affordable. Cuckoo instruments were made for and trademarked by A. C. Cooke of Sydney.\n\nI found photos of a couple of others online slightly different with the Cuckoo in quotation marks, varying scrolling and badge plates – one displaying a trademark with a cuckoo (pictured). I wonder if mine is older and does anyone out there in cyberland know the manufacturer?\n\nThe accordion on the right may have been refurbished?\n\nDefinition of a gentleman – someone who can play the accordion but doesn’t.\n\nTwo With, One Without\n\n8 Ball Aitken\n\n8 Ball Aitken’s recent single Missing You, from his highly acclaimed album Ice Cream Man 2, has a smooth hip blues groove. A co-write with George Thorogood and The Destroyer’s saxophone legend Buddy Leach on those old chestnuts; love, loss and regret. 8 Ball’s harp wails the heartache to perfection. Do yourself a service and wrap your lug holes around this one.\n\nIn the sky all the whispers are swirling\n\nA tempest is building now in the sky\n\nThe heavens crumble. The drunk gods all stumble\n\nThe old ways are over now\n\nIn The Sky, Greg Arnold\n\nGreg Arnold\n\nSpeaking of ice cream, Greg Arnold’s tune In The Sky from the album of the same title, has a catchy melody – of course it does. Fans of nineties band Things Of Stone And Wood will enjoy this ditty. Although no harmonica from Justin Brady, I can hear it ghosting in the distance. Greg reveals the album was inspired by the MeToo movement, and he had considered naming it “Check Your Privilege”. He suggests, “it’s a noble pursuit but a crap name for an album, but it crops up all over the album. In The Sky is a flagship of that spirit: embrace the change. Recognise the privilege and question it. The irony of it is not lost on me,” Greg adds, “that I’m singing at the top of my lungs about how I should shut up and listen.”\n\nThe Dusty Dimes\n\nHill Country Blues inspired The Dusty Dimes, a guitar harmonica duo from Bayside Melbourne, have landed a cracker EP Get Me Where I’m Going. This is their second such release and it’s all about the vibe and off to the music room it goes. Love their rendition of Jumpin’ Jack Flash. Released last month, the lads have a couple of free gigs over in Dad’s old haunts, where I’m sure you could pick up a physical copy. Their appearing at The Edinburgh Castle, Brunswick on Sunday 17 December, 4pm and then the Bar Open, Fitzroy, Wednesday 27 December, 5pm.\n\nHuff’n’Puff\n\nHuff’n’Puff returned to 3MDR late last month with Peej (and Simon from the band 2 Inch Tape) via the dog and bone. I sent Peej a recorded riff providing listeners an opportunity prior to the call to ‘Name that Riff before Shep Sings’. That’s the prize Peej – me not singing. Can you guess it? Lucky Simon did! We also had another popular segment ‘Something from Short Stop’ – not quite as far out as left field. It was Gimme Shelter by New Model Army featuring Tom Jones (1993) and it has Mark Feltham blowin’ the mouth harp. Plenty of banter was had as per usual and nothing like a shout out! Enjoy your FREE coffee ☕️.\n\nP C Spouse\n\nAustralian Harmonica Champion P C Spouse’s 1927 recording of Verdi’s Anvil Chorus was one of eleven new soundtracks added to the National Film and Sound Archive’s Sounds of Australia registry for 2023. In their final summation they laud his skills with, “Spouse’s quintessential ‘vamping style’ is clearly evident in Anvil Chorus, where the melody is accompanied by a vamped chord playing in a different rhythm.” A nice recognition of Ray Grieve’s efforts in locating and preserving Percy’s recordings.\n\n45 rpm\n\nFollow up single to Cool Emotive Wave (better known as Locomotive Weave), Herald Free Stuff, also known as Fart Reed Shuffle, but better known as Ruffled Feathers, has had a little delay. Look out for it in good and bad record stores in the new year.\n\nWonthaggi Warblers\n\nA couple of photographs added to Wonthaggi Warblers. A clearer image of Phil Spooner with his Wonthaggi Magpie teammates and Pete Hasson’s miners tag.\n\nLittle Jackie\n\nHave also been trying to have Little Jackie, the pit pony who lost her life in the 1937 Mine disaster, recognised. There is no mention of her at the Shaft 20 Memorial, the State Coal Mine or the Museum. I’ll keep you informed on any developments.\n\nTwenty Twenty Four\n\nA segue to (in the year) Twenty Twenty Four’s first of the month blawg – they’re Pictorials. We’ve already had a couple this year The Big One and War Blues – they’ll give you an idea on what to expect.\n\nLast month’s feature was the epic – Who Made Who. Next month a more slim downed version – Bluey Watkins & the Harmonica Humbugs.\n\nWot’s in the Box?\n\nA recent purchase was this display box. Can you deduce the occupants? Find out what’s inside in next year’s Review Dawg Blawg.\n\nA Quick Year In Review\n\nWe hit the year running with my instrumental single Locomotive Weave hitting the airways.\n\nI discovered D Davis from Sydney trademarked the True Tone mouth organs in 1924. Pat ‘Guru’ Missin sent HRR the trademarks for A P Sykes models Bess O’ Th’ Barn and Rozella – Otto Weidlich the manufacturer. A G. E. Ohl Crackshot mouth organ discovered by a metal detector in the Aussie bush.\n\nMy little harmonica instrumental receives a spin on ‘The Rocking Magpie’ program on Novaradio Newcastle, UK.\n\nAnother Jazz Master added to the collection.\n\nA move from the mountains to the seaside town of Wonthaggi. Officially now a flat lander – the Hermit of Frog Hollow.\n\nBenoit’s ‘Mountain’ (follow up to ‘Valley’) released with a launch at the Selby Folk Club. The lead track off the album, I’ve been stranded out on my own along with Sometimes words, they’re not even needed receive airplay on local radio stations.\n\nA Hohner Lone Star Rider and a Cuckoo mouth organ added to the collection.\n\nPat ‘Guru’ Missin discovers the Boss Cracker mouth organ is made by Ands. Koch. I locate a 1925 trademark for Cuckoo musical instruments by A. C. Cooke of Sydney confirming it was made for the Australian market.\n\nA Cuckoo accordion makes its way in amongst the mouth organ menagerie.\n\nHuff’n’Puff is back by popular demand with an edition recorded at Shep’s Shanty in Wonny. 3MDR’s Tuesday Brekky host Peejy made a special trip to South Gippsland. A couple of phoners also went live to air.\n\nCome they told me……..a newborn King to see.\n\nThe Ol’ Harp Hound Hisself wishes all you Riff Raffers a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year. 🎅 🥳 See ya then."
