        "text": "Is Swedish house mafia Swedish?\n\nThe Swedish House Mafia is a group of three house DJs: Axwell, Steve Angello and Sebastian Ingrosso. They are all Swedish.\n\nHow many albums did Blind Faith record?\n\nBlind Faith only recorded one album before splitting. The name of the album is the same as the group, Blind Faith. Although when it was remastered in 2000, as a Cd, they added a lot of outtakes, demos and rehearsals to make it into a double album."
