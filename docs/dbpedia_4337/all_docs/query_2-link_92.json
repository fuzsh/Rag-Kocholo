There were appartments above it and to avoid disturbing tenants with applause, patrons would snap their fingers. (This was probably the start of the finger-snapping beatnik!) For years, the two were L'Abbaye's only performers and they built quite a following.\n\n\"Scarborough Fair\" goes back to 17th century England and may have been recorded by others along the way, but Heath & Payant's is the earliest I've found so far.\n\nSimon & Garfunkel's version was inspired by Martin Carthy's treatment of the song, who had picked up the tune from the Ewan MacColl/Peggy Seeger songbook The Singing Island. Martin's distinctive acoustic guitar arrangement helped spur a mid-'60s UK folk revival and \"Fair\" became one of his signature songs. During a 1965 stay in London, Paul Simon attended a Carthy performance and, following the show, had Martin show him \"Scarborough Fair's\" delicate guitar part. This incident reached legendary status, with various supposed locations and famous people in attendance. Rumors aside, Simon obviously made the most of the lesson; when his & Garfunkel's version (with added \"Canticle\" counterpoint) came out, it was credited to the two of them. And their album was titled after \"Fair's\" refrain, Parsley, Sage, Rosemary & Thyme. Martin Carthy became known as \"the man who gave away 'Scarborough Fair'\" and he & Simon had no further contact for years. Then at a 2000 Paul Simon concert in London, Simon ushered his surprise guest on stage. Thirty-five years after their initial encounter, he and Carthy played \"Scarborough Fair\" together, as whatever ill will existed had been put aside.\n\nScarlet Ribbons (For Her Hair) Jo Stafford (10-31-49)\n\nCapitol 785 Juanita Hall (11-4-49), Harry Belafonte, Kingston Trio, Browns, Sinéad O'Connor\n\nJuanita Hall is often cited as the first to cut \"Scarlet Ribbons,\" but assuming these recording dates are accurate, Stafford's preceded hers.\n\nScrub-Board (aka Hold Back The Night) Trammps 1972\n\nBuddah 321 Tramps (1975 as \"Hold Back The Night\"), Graham Parker & Rumour (as \"Hold Back The Night\")\n\n\"Scrub-Board\" was an instrumental B-side that the Trammps then added vocals to, remixing and editing it to be longer, creating their hit \"Hold Back The Night.\" There is some evidence the Trammps did \"Hold\" in 1973, two years before it was issued, but that's not definitive. Regardless, \"Scrub-Board\" preceeded it.\n\nSea Cruise Huey Smith & Clowns w/ Bobby Marchan & Gerri Hall 1958 (cut for Ace)\n\non CD Ace 2021 Rock 'N' Roll Revival (1990) Frankie Ford (9-58)\n\nFrankie Ford's hit used the same backing track, with added sound effects, as Smith's.\n\nSealed With A Kiss Four Voices 1960\n\nColumbia 41699 Brian Hyland, Gary Lewis & Playboys, Bobby Vinton\n\nSeasons In The Sun Rod McKuen 1961 (summer)\n\non lp In 1003 (1963) Kingston Trio (12-2-63), Rod McKuen (many times for various labels: Warner Bros., Buddah etc.), Terry Jacks\n\nAdapted by Rod McKuen from Jacques Brel's 1961 composition \"Le Moribond\" (\"The Dying Man\"). McKuen sent out test pressings of the In label lp in hopes of getting other artists to record his songs and to gather quotes for the album jacket. Years later Terry Jacks produced a version by the Beach Boys. The group declined to release it (now available online to hear), so he did \"Seasons\" himself. Rod was on a trip to Mexico at the time and, upon his return to the States, was pleasantly surprised to find Jacks' record at the top of the charts.\n\nSee See Rider Blues (aka C C Rider aka See See Blues) Ma Rainey & her Georgia Jazz Band 10-16-24\n\nParamount 12252 Chuck Willis, LaVern Baker, Animals, Mitch Ryder & Detroit Wheels et al.\n\nSome pressings of Rainey's Paramount 78 list the title as \"See See Blues.\"\n\nSee You Later Alligator see Later Alligator\n\nSelf Control RAF 1984\n\nItalian Carrere A 4223 Laura Branigan\n\nSend In The Clowns Glynis Johns 3-18-73\n\nColumbia AE7-1070 Frank Sinatra, Judy Collins\n\nGlynis' recording is from the A Little Night Music cast album.\n\nSend Me The Pillow (That You Dream On) (aka Send Me The Pillow You Dream On) Hank Locklin 6-49\n\n4 Star 1360 Hank Locklin (1957 for RCA Victor), Browns, Johnny Tiltotson, Dean Martin\n\nSentimental Lady Fleetwood Mac 1972\n\nReprise 1093 Bob Welch\n\nBob Welch was a member of Fleetwood Mac when he wrote and (they) first recorded the song.

Stevenson 1973\n\nRCA Victor 74-0952 Three Dog Night\n\nAlthough Stevenson's reached #66 on Billboard's Hot 100, it was overshadowed by Three Dog Night's hit version. The song has a confusing history and misinformation is rampant.\n\nThree Dog Night heard writer Daniel Moore's demo and committed to cutting it, assured that they had an exclusive shot at the song. Meanwhile, Moore played his demo tapes for RCA, hoping to get signed as an artist. Label exec David Kershenbaum passed on signing Moore, but then produced Stevenson's take on \"Shambala,\" insisting it would just be an album track (which it clearly was not). Three Dog Night had a busy touring schedule and hadn't finished their recording until after Stevenson's was completed. Radio stations began playing his and Three Dog Night's was rushed into release. RCA even took out music industry magazine ads touting B.W.'s as the original, but the public went for Three Dog Night's.\n\nShame On The Moon Rodney Crowell 5-81\n\non lp Warner Bros 3587 Mac Davis, Bob Seger\n\nShame, Shame Keith Colley 1968\n\nColumbia 44410 Magic Lanterns\n\nShanghai Noodle Factory Jay & Americans 1967\n\nUnited Artists 50222 Traffic (11-68)\n\nThis wasn't a hit for Traffic but it was a popular album track (from Last Exit). I find it interesting that an American group like Jay & The Americans would be the first to record an early composition by Brits Steve Winwood and company, although it was produced by co-writer and Traffic producer Jimmy Miller.\n\nShangri-La Matty Malneck & Orch. 2-7-46\n\nColumbia 37877 Robert Maxwell (1953,1964), Four Coins, Vic Dana\n\nCo-writer and harpist Robert Maxwell was a member of Malneck's band. He had previously used parts of this melody in a composition titled \"Fantasy For Harp,\" recorded around 1943 as a member of Rudy Vallee's US Coast Guard Band. Jackie Gleason laters used \"Shangri-La\" as theme music for his Reggie van Gleason TV character.\n\nSharing The Night Together Arthur Alexander 1976\n\nBuddah 522/602 Lenny LeBlanc, Dr. Hook\n\nArthur Alexander and Lenny LeBlanc cut theirs (unbeknownst to each other) around the same time, while both were living in Muscle Shoals, Alabama.

This prompted Diamond to leave the label for Uni Records. The first \"Shilo\" 45 was released though around September, 1967.

Redman did bring the arrangement and play on its session, but didn't really compose \"Infirmary.\" As with many songs that floated about, the first to properly register it typically became the designated writer. Publisher Irving Mills often also took credit under the pseudonym Joe Primrose.\n\nSt. Louis Blues Prince's Band 12-18-15\n\nColumbia A-5772 Bessie Smith, W.C. Handy (many times), Louis Armstrong, Billy Holiday, Duke Ellington, Bob Wills, Benny Goodman, Django Reinhardt, Cab Calloway, Ella Fitzgerald et al.\n\nIt's not certain who was the first to cut \"St. Louis Blues,\" but Prince's Band is as likely a candidate as any.\n\nStack o' Lee Blues (aka Stagger Lee, aka Stackolee) Waring's Pennsylvanians 10-16-23\n\nVictor 19189 Frank Westphal (10-18-23), Ma Rainey, Mississippi John Hurt, Woody Guthrie, Archibald, Lloyd Price, Professor Longhair, Tommy Roe, Wilson Pickett, Taj Mahal et al.\n\nThere are numerous title spellings of \"Stagger Lee\" as well as variations in its melody and lyrics. The song was probably first published in 1910. For more on \"Stagger Lee\" see Greil Marcus's book Mystery Train and his extensive article in the January 1996 issue of Mojo. There is also a book called Stagolee Shot Billy by Cecil Brown.\n\nBoth Fred Waring's and Frank Westphal's were instrumentals(!).\n\nMississippi John Hurt's December 28, 1928 recording (Okeh 8654) was the model for most subsequent recordings.\n\nStardust (aka Star Dust) Hoagy Carmichael & Pals 10-31-27\n\nGennett 6311 Hoagy Carmichael (vocal,1929), Larry Clinton, Billy Ward & Dominoes, Nino Tempo & April Stevens, Willie Nelson et al.\n\nCarmichael whistled a tune that became \"Stardust\" while looking to the sky one late summer night in 1927. Hoagy later wrote of the session, done on Halloween that year (as an instrumental), \"This melody was bigger than I was. It wasn't a part of me. It didn't sound familiar in the playback. I wanted to shout 'Maybe I didn't write you, but I found you.'\"\n\nStarting All Over Again Sam & Dave 1971\n\non CD Rhino 8122-71253 Sweat 'N' Soul: Anthology (1965-1971) (1993) Mel & Tim\n\nPhillip Mitchell wrote this with Sam & Dave in mind, as he thought they were about to start over again (by 1971 their career had waned). For whatever reason, the duo's recording wasn't issued until years later.\n\nState Of Independence Jon & Vangelis 1981\n\non lp Polydor 6326 The Friends Of Mr. Cairo Donna Summer\n\nStatesboro Blues Blind Willie McTell 10-17-28\n\nVictor 38001 Taj Mahal, Youngbloods, Allman Bros., David Bromberg, Pat Travers, John Hammond\n\nStay Glenn Jones 1990\n\non lp Jive 1181-1 All For You Eternal\n\nStay In My Corner Dells 2-19-65\n\nVee Jay 674 Dells (1968 for Cadet)\n\nStay Together Young Lovers Ben Aiken 1965\n\nRoulette 4649 Brenda & Tabulations\n\nSteamroller (aka Steamroller Blues) James Taylor 12-69\n\non lp Warner Bros. 1843 Sweet Baby James Masqueraders, Elvis Presley\n\nDespite numerous online references and discographies that list the Masqueraders' version (Bell 932) as being from 1968, it was issued in 1970, after Taylor's original.\n\nStep By Step Superiors 1987\n\nMotown 1895 New Kids On The Block\n\nStep By Step Annie Lennox 1992\n\non UK CD single BMG 10089 2 Whitney Houston\n\nStewball Greenbriar Boys 1961\n\non lp Vanguard 9096 New Folks Peter, Paul & Mary, Joan Baez, Hollies\n\nThere are numerous songs titled \"Stewball,\" but in this case Peter, Paul & Mary's popular version is the one being referenced.\n\nThe title comes from \"Skewbald,\" an animal (usually a horse) with patches of brown on a coat of a color other than black. An Irish ballad of that title, dating back to the 18th century, came out of an actual horse race in which a skewbald surprisingly beat a grey mare. \"Skewbald\" evolved into \"Skewball\" and alternately \"Stewball.\"\n\nThere have been recordings concerning the race by Woody Guthrie, Leadbelly, the Weavers, Cisco Houston, Memphis Slim and the Coasters. Greenbriar Boys member Bob Yellin adapted the lyrics (particularly Cisco Houston's) and used a different melody, albeit one that's similiar to Johnny Ace's 1955 hit \"Pledging My Love.\" (Subsequetly, John & Yoko used the tune for their \"Happy Xmas [War Is Over]) Peter, Paul & Mary's hit used Yellen's melody but they wrote their own race horse lyrics.\n\nThe New Folks album also includes cuts from Hedy West, Jackie Washington and David Gude.\n\nStir It Up Bob Marley & Wailers 1967 (early)\n\nJamaican Wail 'N' Soul M (no #)\n\nJohnny Nash, Wailers (1973 for Island)\n\nStoned Soul Picnic Laura Nyro 1-9-68\n\non lp Columbia 9626 Eli & The Thirteenth Confession 5th Dimension\n\nStoney End Laura Nyro 7-13-66\n\nVerve Folkways 5024 Laura Nyro (11-66 on lp Verve Folkways 3020 More Than A New Discovery), Peggy Lipton, Barbra Streisand\n\nNyro's single and album versions use the same backing track but the vocal takes are different, including some lyric variations.\n\nStop Your Sobbing Kinks 8-64\n\non lp Reprise 6143 You Really Got Me Pretenders\n\nFor whatever significance it is, Pretenders vocalist Chrissie Hynde and Kinks singer Ray Davies had a daughter in 1983.\n\nStormy Monday see Call It Stormy Monday\n\nStormy Weather Leo Reisman & Orch. w/ Harold Arlen\n\n2-28-33\n\nVictor 24262/24716 Guy Lombardo (4-12-33), Ethel Waters (5-3-33), Duke Ellington (5-16-33), Lena Horne, Five Sharps\n\nThe song was written for a revue at Harlem's famed Cotton Club, with the intent of having Cab Calloway introduce it. Calloway was not appearing at the club at the time though and the song's writers (Harold Arlen and Ted Koehler) decided it was equally suited for a woman. Ethel Waters became their choice but before she debuted it, Arlen cut it and had a hit. Waters recorded hers a few months later and \"Stormy Weather\" became her signature tune.\n\nStraight From The Heart Ian Lloyd 1980\n\non lp Scotti Bros. 7110 3WC (Third Wave Civilization) Bryan Adams\n\nStraight Life, The Sonny Curtis c. 5-68\n\nViva 630 Bobby Goldsboro (5-13-68), Bing Crosby (11-21-68), Glen Campbell\n\nStranded In The Jungle Jayhawks 1956\n\nFlash 109 Cadets, Gadabouts, New York Dolls\n\nThe Jayhawks' record charted well in its day, but I think it's been lost to history, having been completely overshadowed by the Cadets' (and others).\n\nStrangers In The Night (as \"Beddy Bye\") Bert Kaempfert 3-8-66\n\non lp Decca 74750 A Man Could Get Killed ost Bert Kaempfert (4-4-66 on lp Decca 74795 Strangers In The Night), Jack Jones (4-4-66), Frank Sinatra (4-11-66)\n\nOnly early pressings of the soundtrack album list the title as \"Beddy Bye.\" Both of Kaempfert's recordings were instrumentals.\n\nWhile Bert Kaempfert is the credited writer of the song (with English lyrics by Charles Singleton and Eddie Snyder), others, including Avo Uvezian and Ivo Robić, lay claim to composing its melody. It's likely the true source will never be known.\n\nStrawberry Letter 23 Shuggie Otis 1971\n\nEpic 10798 Brothers Johnson\n\nStreets Of Bakersfield Homer Joy 1972\n\nCapitol 3476 Buck Owens (11-6-72), Dwight Yoakam & Buck Owens\n\nStreets Of London Ralph McTell 11-68\n\non lp UK Transatlantic 177 Spiral Staircase Ralph McTell (1974 for UK Warner Bros./US 20th Century), Joan Baez, Anti-Nowhere League (often wrongly identified as the Sex Pistols), Sinéad O'Connor\n\nMcTell, born Ralph May, changed his name in tribute to Blind Willie Mctell. He wrote \"Streets\" in the mid 1960s while busking around Europe and reluctantly recorded it for his second album, prompted by producer Gus Dudgeon. Unlike his first LP (Eight Frames A Second), Spiral Staircase wasn't released in the States. An alternate take of the first \"Streets\" (with overdubs) was included though on a repackaged version of McTell's 1971 You Well-Meaning Brought Me Here album, issued on US Paramount 6015.\n\nSubstitute Righteous Bros. 1975\n\nCapitol/Haven 7014 Clout, Gloria Gaynor\n\nSuch A Night Clyde McPhatter & Drifters 11-12-53\n\nAtlantic 1019 Johnnie Ray (2-16-54), Bunny Paul, Elvis Presley\n\nSue Me, Sue You Blues Jesse Davis (aka Jesse Ed Davis) 1972\n\nAtco 6873 George Harrison\n\nGeorge Harrison wrote \"Sue Me, Sue Your Blues\" in response to the protracted legal battles following the Beatles' breakup and issues with their collective company Apple Corps.\n\nSugar On Sunday Tommy James 1968\n\non lp Roulette 42023 Crimson And Clover Clique\n\nSugarbush (Vastrap) Josef Marais & His Bushveld Band 1-29-46\n\nDecca 23691 B Doris Day & Frankie Laine, Josef Marais & Miranda (1952 for Columbia), Eve Boswell\n\n\"Sugarbush\" was adapted from the South African song \"Suikerbossie,\" that country's national flower.\n\nMarais' original was issued as part of a six disc 78 set (Decca A-471), Songs Of The South African Veld, Volume One.
