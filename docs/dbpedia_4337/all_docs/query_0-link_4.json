        "text": "This is the first-ever CD reissue of the 1976 and 1979 privately-released solo albums by Tucson, Arizona-based singer-songwriter Shep Cooke, now remastered in a 24-bit remaster. Cooke was a former member of '60s bands The Dearly Beloved and Stone Poneys with Linda Ronstadt, and he also played on Tom Waits' Closing Time. Shep Cooke is an extraordinarily excellent acoustic guitar player, songwriter, and singer, and both albums are smattered throughout with country-blues-fueled acoustic jams, crooning ballads, and some lite-rock groovers. This CD includes both Cooke's self-titled 1976 solo debut and 1979's Concert Tour Of Mars. Housed in a miniature replica paper sleeve, with extensive liner notes and photos."
