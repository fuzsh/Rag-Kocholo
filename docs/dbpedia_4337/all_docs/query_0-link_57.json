While she found treating children with cancer enormously rewarding, she became increasingly aware of the importance of basic research in understanding disease better and therefore treating patients more effectively. This experience led her to seek an opportunity to study basic science in the US. After working in the field of cancer biology as a postdoctoral fellow at the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, Texas, Dr. Esumi wanted to learn molecular biology to dissect the pathogenic mechanisms of human diseases at the molecular level. She found such an opportunity in eye research at the National Eye Institute. Since then, Dr. Esumi's research interests have been in eye research. She joined the Wilmer faculty as a research associate in 1997. Her research focus has been on the regulation of gene expression in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), an essential cell type for supporting the health and function of retinal photoreceptor cells. The RPE is also important as the primary site of damage causing age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Therefore, her research focus has gradually shifted from basic molecular biology to understanding of the molecular process of eye diseases, particularly AMD.\n\nPersonal profile: As a child, I loved mystery books and wanted to be a detective.

Kellam, M.D.\n\nProfessor Emeritus, School of Public Health\n\nProfessional profile: Sheppard Kellam was appointed Professor and Chair of the Department of Mental Hygiene in 1982, now the Department of Mental Health, and continued to serve as chair until 1993. Before coming to Johns Hopkins, he completed his medical degree at the University of Maryland, medical internship at Bellevue Hospital, two years psychiatric residency at Yale. He then spent 4 years at the NIMH in studies of psychiatric wards and communities and the role of the new psychiatric medications. He then moved to the Southside of Chicago with help from NIMH, the Chicago Board of Health, the University of Chicago and support from Chicago’s Woodlawn community, where the team worked through trust with a Board of Woodlawn citizen community leaders. With oversight of the Board the public health team carried out developmental epidemiological studies of 4 consecutive annual cohorts of 1st graders in 12 elementary schools, periodically throughout elementary and well into adulthood. These studies revealed early risk of attention and aggression behavior problems in early first grade that proved to be important antecedents and possibly correctable in first grade and possibly beyond.\n\nWorking in close partnership with the Baltimore City Public School system, Kellam led three generations of large-scale epidemiologically based randomized field trials systematically testing universal preventive interventions in classrooms directed at early antecedents of long-term problem outcomes. An intervention of particular importance was the “Good Behavior Game,” a classroom behavior management method for socializing children to the role of student while offering teachers a method for managing classroom behavior in a way that does not compete for instructional time. By young adulthood, significant and meaningful reductions were found, mainly among males, compared to randomized control groups for all the problem outcomes cited (drug and alcohol abuse and dependence, daily regular tobacco use, antisocial personality disorder, delinquency and incarceration, use of school-based services, and school failure). This work began in 1984 and is continuing.\n\nIn 1996, Kellam was awarded the Rema Lapouse Award for lifetime contributions to public health and prevention science by the Mental Health, Epidemiology, and Statistics Sections of the American Public Health Association. In 1999, the World Federation for Mental Health presented him their Distinguished Public Mental Health Award for his work in advancing the science for prevention of mental and behavioral disorders.

Her years as pathology faculty at the University of Wisconsin (1970–72), UCLA (1972–94) and Johns Hopkins (1995–present) formed her passion for her specialty. She has made major contributions to the diagnostic criteria used in cytopathology. A 10-year National Institutes of Health RO1 grant supported the development of automated and computerized screening systems for review of Pap tests. These efforts contributed to the currently available commercial Pap test scanners. For that research, Rosenthal received the UCLA Woman of Science Award in 1989.\n\nMost recently, Rosenthal led international colleagues in defining a paradigm shift for the cytologic diagnosis of bladder cancer, prompting the President’s Award from the American Society of Cytopathology (2016) and the Papanicolaou Society’s Lifetime Achievement Award (2017). She has served as president of the ASC and the International Academy of Cytology and has received from each their highest honors for her contributions to cytopathology. Although officially retired from Johns Hopkins in 2014, she still mentors house staff and young faculty with their clinical research projects. As a featured speaker at professional meetings, she continues her fondness of travel, learning about various cultures from direct interaction with those who host her. Rosenthal is very excited to be a founding member of The Academy.\n\nPersonal profile: My husband, Bill Nerenberg, and I have four children and eight grandchildren whom we visit whenever possible.
