        "text": "Oh, I've got all of the Nelson Riddle albums and they're all very good. I somehow just always liked the \"What's New\" album the best, probably because she covered a lot of my Sinatra favorites on that one!\n\nI did NOT know that the \"Sentimental\" album was originally planned to be a double album and more importantly with JOBIM as a guest, as mentioned by \"WILKIE\"! That would have been GREAT!\n\nChris C\n\nTube mastered by Doug Sax! And the second album of the Nelson Riddle trilogy, LUSH LIFE, has lots of gems too. I bought it when it first came out in '85....it's a target label disc, and it sounds great to this day.\n\nWhat's even more unbelievable is that Capitol listed that track as \"Composer Unknown\". Bobby Kimmel wrote the song, and got around to recording it himself in 1972 on The Floating House Band album...along with another former Stone Poney, Shep Cooke. Which brings up another issue...I'm convinced that this is not an out-take from Hand Sown...Home Grown, but is actually an older song recorded by The Stone Poneys. Not only did Bobby write it, but that's Kenny Edwards on banjo and background vocals. Since Kenny left the group (and the country) early into the recording of the third Poneys' album, it becomes even more obvious this song came from an earlier session.\n\nAs far as the other \"Composer Unknown\" track from The Capitol Years, \"Kate\", that's definitely Glen Frey singing lead, and Don Henley on drums. Since the song sounds a little like an early version of \"Heartache Tonight\" it would surprise me to to find the composer was too far removed from that group.\n\nBut I'd have to agree that this compilation is an excellent collection of Linda's work during this era. For me just the inclusion of the unreleased live version of \"Long, Long Time\" makes it a must-have CD.\n\nI guess you are referring to the CD. Thanks for the info -- that confirms my suspicions. I was wondering why that CD sounded so great. I actually listened to the album for the first time on the CD (back in the late 80's, I believe), and I immediately tracked down the vinyl counterparts.\n\nLinda headlined the Edmonton Folk Music Festival last evening with Ann Savoy and an all acoustic band. BTW, it was the furthest thing from a greatest hits show.\n\n(I work backstage in Performer Hospitality and was on shift during the concert set so I was unable see all of it.)\n\nThe set included:\n\na few songs from the Adieu False Heart including mid-set their gorgeous rendition of the Left Banke's \"Walk Away Renee\"\n\na very nice arrangement of Tom Petty & The Heartbreaker's \"The Waiting\"\n\n\"Telling Me Lies\", the Linda Thompson song from Trio\n\none of the McGarrigle sisters songs, could have been \"All I Left Behind\"\n\nand the band might have done a song or two from either Frenesi or Canciones de Mi Padre\n\nfinal song before encore and encore song were both from Simple Dreams, \"Poor Poor Pififul Me\" and \"Blue Bayou\"\n\n_________________________________\n\nSoon as \"Blue Bayou\" finished Linda walked off stage where I drove her and 3 others including her tour mgr. directly off-site to a waiting car, where my brother drove them back to the hotel. She was very nice.\n\nHer voice is still very strong.\n\n_________________\n\nReview from today's Edmonton Journal.\n\n\"...Linda Ronstadt stood just about motionless before a full acoustic band, looking down from time to time, as if for inspiration. Her voice...remains an absolute marvel. In the chilly night air, her haunting interpretations of songs by artists like Kate and Anna McGarrigle, Linda Thompson and most improbably, Tom Petty and The Heartbreakers were, musically and atmospherically heartbreaking.\"\n\n____________________\n\nI could not see from where I was watching (stage left and stage right), however, the lookng down could have possibly been a telepromter?"
