        "meta_description": "Pest control is one of the areas in which population dynamic theory has been successfully applied to solve practical problems. However, the links between population dynamic theory and model construction have been less emphasized in the management and control of weed populations. Most management models of weed population dynamics have emphasized the role of the endogenous process, but the role of exogenous variables such as climate have been ignored in the study of weed populations and their management. Here, we use long-term data (22 years) on two annual weed species from a locality in Central Spain to determine the importance of endogenous and exogenous processes (local and large-scale climate factors). Our modeling study determined two different feedback structures and climate effects in the two weed species analyzed. While Descurainia sophia exhibited a second-order feedback and low climate influence, Veronica hederifolia was characterized by a first-order feedback structure and important effects from temperature and rainfall. Our results strongly suggest the importance of theoretical population dynamics in understanding plant population systems. Moreover, the use of this approach, discerning between the effect of exogenous and endogenous factors, can be fundamental to applying weed management practices in agricultural systems and to controlling invasive weedy species. This is a radical change from most approaches currently used to guide weed and invasive weedy species managements.",

        "text": "Site and sampling\n\nA 22 year study (1985–2007) was conducted at El Encin Experimental Station (Alcala de Henares), Madrid, Spain (latitude: 40° 29′ N, Longitude: 3° 22′ W; Altitude: 610 m) using a cropping system based on a 2-year cereal-legume rotation. The experimental site has a north-Mediterranean climate, with mild and humid winters and dry-hot summers Average annual rainfall during the 22-year study period was 480 mm, with a maximum precipitation of 670 mm and a minimum of 230 mm. The average temperature was 13.1°C. All crops were grown under no-tillage and minimum tillage practices, maintaining plant residues close to the soil surface. During the wheat rotation phase, fertilizers were applied at relatively high rates (76 kg N, 120 kg P, 40 kg K ha −1). Herbicides were sprayed for control of dicotyledonous weeds. No fertilizers or herbicides were applied in the legume rotation phase. Detailed information about the experiment is given in [12].\n\nWeed population densities were sampled annually except in 1990 and 1997. The sampling times and procedures used to quantify weed population density varied slightly depending on the type of crop (cereal or legume) and the weed population density. In the wheat rotation phase, sampling took place from February to March. In the legume rotation phase sampling was slightly later (March to April). In the first three years of the experiment 5 destructive samples (30×33 cm) were taken along an M shape itinerary in each plot (20×40 m in size). Thereafter, 10 samples were taken in each plot except in 1995 when 20 samples were taken (10 along each of two transects). The collected material was kept in plastic bags and transported to the laboratory, where individual species were identified and counted. The different sampling intensities among years were due to the different weed densities present."
