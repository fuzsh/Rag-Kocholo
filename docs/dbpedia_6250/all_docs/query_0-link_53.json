        "text": "This article presents results from a multidisciplinary research project on the integration and transfer of language knowledge into robots as an empirical paradigm for the study of language development in both humans and humanoid robots. Within the framework of human linguistic and cognitive development, we focus on how three central types of learning interact and co‐develop: individual learning about one&#39;s own embodiment and the environment, social learning (learning from others), and learning of linguistic capability. Our primary concern is how these capabilities can scaffold each other&#39;s development in a continuous feedback cycle as their interactions yield increasingly sophisticated competencies in the agent&#39;s capacity to interact with others and manipulate its world. Experimental results are summarized in relation to milestones in human linguistic and cognitive development and show that the mutual scaffolding of social learning, individual learning, and linguistic ca...\n\nThis paper presents the results of a behavioral experiment conducted between February 2020 and March 2021 at UniversitA Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, Milan Campus, in which students were matched with either a human or a humanoid robotic partner to play an iterated Prisonerâ€™s Dilemma. The results of a Logit estimation procedure show that subjects are more likely to cooperate with human rather than with robotic partners; that they are more likely to cooperate after receiving a dialogic verbal reaction following a sub-optimal social outcome; and that the effect of the verbal reaction is not dependent on the nature of the partner. Our findings provide new evidence on the effects of verbal communication in strategic frameworks. The results are robust to the exclusion of students of Economics-related subjects, to the inclusion of a set of psychological and behavioral controls, to the way subjects perceive robotsâ€™ behavior, and to potential gender biases in human-human interactions."
