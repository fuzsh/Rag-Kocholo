        "text": "Round 16 - Leicester Lions v Albion\n\nBy Happy Knees\n\nFebruary 1 2024\n\nIt's a weekend of catching up as Albion travel to Leicester Lions to fulfill the fixture that was postponed a couple of weeks ago.\n\nAlbion have experienced a poor run of form of late culminating in losing their unbeaten home record to Darlington Mowden Park Last week. They will be looking at 11th placed Leicester to return to winning ways, particularly on the road.\n\nLeicester, meanwhile have seen an upturn in their fortunes, winning the last three of their fixtures, with good away wins against Blackheath and Richmond. Albion will certainly have a game on their hands.\n\nAlbion have a much higher try scoring rate with an average of over 4 a game whilst Leicester have a little over 2Â½. Similarly Albion have conceded 3 a game with Leicester conceding nearly 4. However, as previously mentioned, recent fortunes do not reflect the performances of the first half of the season.\n\nNoteably, Leicester are extremely vulnerable to the threat posed by front rows, one of Albion's strengths, whereas they are stronger amongst the backs, particularly through the centres. So whilst Albion could be expected to play a tight game and draw out penalties, Leicester will look to spread it wide and increase the pressure towards the end of each half.\n\nWeather - A moderate to strong breeze will blow from the western corner. This will keep temperatures up whilst the rain will stay away.\n\nForecast - This could go either way - Albion ought to win, but current form says otherwise. Could be a long trip back."
