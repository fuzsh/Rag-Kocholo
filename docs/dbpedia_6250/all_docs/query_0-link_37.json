Farewell to O’Brien, the second time around BY DAVID DORE NEW LEADER STAFF WRITER NORTH BROOKFIELD — Claiming it would prevent teacher layoffs <strong>and</strong> the elimination of music, art <strong>and</strong> sports, School Committee Chairman Brent Hildick urged selectmen last week to present voters with a $460,000 Proposition 2 1/2 override in a couple of weeks. BY DAVID DORE NEW LEADER STAFF WRITER LEICESTER — Mary O’Brien had been the Leicester Senior Center outreach coordinator for about a decade when she decided in October 2003 it was time to retire. But not everyone in town agreed with her. “They had a petition around to bring me back,” said O’Brien. David Dore photos Mary O’Brien st<strong>and</strong>s with gr<strong>and</strong>daughter Kate Cotillo, 10, of Northborough at her retirement party Thursday, May 26 at the Leicester Senior Center. However, selectmen said they wanted to see how negotiations with the teachers’ union on health insurance <strong>and</strong> wage concessions went first before making a decision. That decision could come as soon as Tuesday, May 31 — after the Spencer New Leader’s press deadline. According to Hildick, the school district is facing a “That was dress rehearsal, I guess.” “I didn’t start it, but I did support it,” said Janice Nowicki, the Senior Center director at the time. O’Brien changed her mind <strong>and</strong> stayed on for another eight years. On Thursday, May 26, the Senior Center marked her retirement for the second time. It was her final day of work, except for some appointments this week. “This day is bittersweet for me,” O’Brien told the family, friends <strong>and</strong> dignitaries who gathered for her retirement party. “As you might Turn To O’BRIEN page A16 $460K override sought for North Brookfield schools Brent Hildick $460,464 deficit in next year’s $6.47 million budget.

Imagine no more. Just head to the West Brookfield Town Common on Saturday, June 4 for a Civil War living history encampment. “It will interest a lot of people,” said Nancy Parker, of the West Brookfield Historical Commission. “We’re hoping the events <strong>and</strong> features will bring people in. It’s for everybody.” Event-goers will see a true depiction of a Union camp, a witness to how the soldiers lived, what they ate, where they slept <strong>and</strong> what hardships they endured. A horse-drawn covered wagon will also be on h<strong>and</strong> to give rides to guests. There will also be Union military drills, a rifle-firing demonstration <strong>and</strong> other re-enactments, including detained Confederate soldiers. All soldiers will wear authentic war regalia. “They have to perform just like if they’d been in the Civil War,” Parker said. “When they are there, they live like they are in the war. They just do so much.” Doing the reenacting will be the 15th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry Re-enactors. The re-enactors will be portraying soldiers in the 15th Volunteer Infantry, which, back 150 years ago, was the Civil War company that comprised members of the Brookfields. “They were one of the top fighting regiments in the Civil War, <strong>and</strong> in all the major battles,” Parker said. The event will be held from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. at the Town Common, routes 9 <strong>and</strong> 67. The rain date is Sunday, June 5. One of the biggest benefits is that visitors are invited to chat with those in the encampment, who have a wealth of knowledge, Turn To CIVIL WAR page A15"
