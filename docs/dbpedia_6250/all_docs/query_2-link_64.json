        "text": "IN the South of England I dont remember significant snow that often in the 70's.\n\nI recall one year in the late 70's where there was disruption for 3 or 4 days during the Xmas holidays,then in the 80's we seemed to get 3 or 4 days each January or February .\n\nIn the 90's we were lucky to get any snow settling.\n\nAnd this year we had a couple of days of snow.\n\nRegarding Summer ,its definitely hotter every year (bar this year) than it was ever in the 70's except for 1976.\n\nPeople always blame the extreme heat on global warming yet this year we've had one hot day and dozens of wet days.\n\nBut Jack Frost does seem to come out less each year.\n\n0\n\nNo doubt I'm not alone in remembering those halcyon days of the seventies when winters usually meant snow and summers were warm and sunny.\n\nDo you remember them?\n\nIt's so different now, should we blame global warming or can we explain it by natural fluctuations in climate?\n\nActually your memory deceives you slightly, because most Winters in the 1970's were in fact mild. Only 1969/70, 1977/78 and 1978/79 were anything like really snowy. Also, not all of the Summers were hot. In fact by today's standards, one or two were distinctly cool.\n\n1970's Winters\n\n1969/70: Quite cold and snowy, but some mild spells\n\n1970/71: Mostly mild and snow free, but Christmas 1970 was snowy. A truly white Christmas.\n\n1971/72: Mostly mild, but a brief severe cold spell at the end of January, beginning of February, but it didn't produce much snow.\n\n1972/73: Mild and quite dry at times. Very little snow.\n\n1973/74: Mostly very mild. Again, very little snow\n\n1974/75: Very mild, very wet. Hardly any snow.\n\n1975/76: Mild and fairly dry. One cold snap in February, but it didn't produce much snow.\n\n1976/77: Overall, near normal temperatures with a few snowy spells in December and January, but February was very mild. There were reports of snowflakes the size of saucers in the East Midlands during a blizzard on the 11th January.\n\n1977/78: After a mild start, January and February were cold, and there were some major snow events, most notably in the North East in January, where one snowstorm was unusually accompanied by thunder and some forked lightning. Also in the South West in February where an exceptional blizzard caused widespread chaos.\n\n1978/79: Very cold and snowy. There was widespread and frequent snow all over the country from late December through to early March, with only brief milder spells.\n\n1970's Summers\n\n1970: Mostly hot June and early July with many severe thunderstorms, but the remainder of the Summer was a disappointment with quite a bit of rain, and cool.\n\n1971: Appalling wet June, remainder of the Summer better, but not brilliant.\n\n1972: Abysmally wet and cold June, worse than 1971. July quite sunny and warm after a bad start. August dry but cool. Hail reported as 27mm thick during a violent thunderstorm over Nottingham on the 23rd July.\n\n1973: Mostly average. A hot spell burnished the middle part of August.\n\n1974: Cool and wet ~ a poor Summer\n\n1975: classic ~ hot and dry\n\n1976: super classic ~ very hot and dry. Broke late August with some spectacular thunderstorms, mostly confined to the far South West, just rain elsewhere.\n\n1977: Below par Summer, with another poor June in particular.\n\n1978: A distinctly chilly and rather unsettled Summer. The fine hot days at the start of June flattered to deceive.\n\n1979: Very average.\n\n0"
