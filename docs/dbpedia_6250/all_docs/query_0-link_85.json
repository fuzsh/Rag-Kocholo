        "text": "BackgroundThe National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment (HTA) programme supports research tailored to the needs of NHS decision-makers, patients and clinicians. This study reviewed the impact of the programme, from 2003 to 2013, on health, clinical practice, health policy, the economy and academia. It also considered how HTA could maintain and increase its impact.MethodsInterviews (n = 20): senior stakeholders from academia, policy-making organisations and the HTA programme. Bibliometric analysis: citation analysis of publications arising from HTA programme-funded research. Researchfish survey: electronic survey of all HTA grant holders. Payback case studies (n = 12): in-depth case studies of HTA programme-funded research.ResultsWe make the following observations about the impact, and routes to impact, of the HTA programme: it has had an impact on patients, primarily through changes in guidelines, but also directly (e.g. changing clinical practice); ...\n\nTo examine the methods used in health technology assessments (HTAs) produced for the Medical Services Advisory Committee (MSAC) reviewing the effectiveness of a technology or procedure. Data were extracted from the effectiveness section of HTA application assessment reports published between 1 January 1998 and 17 July 2006 and available on the MSAC website. Only HTAs of effectiveness interventions were examined, as the methods used to undertake such reviews are well established. Variables reflecting methods used in the HTAs to evaluate the effectiveness of health technologies or procedures. Of 56 MSAC HTA reports available, 31 met the inclusion criteria. Considerable variability was shown to exist between the various indicators of quality and the methodology used within the HTAs. Reports did not describe potential conflicts of interest of participants. The majority of reports (19/31) did not formally state the research question that the assessment was attempting to answer. Just over...\n\nHealth technology assessment (HTA)--the provision to decision makers of information on the value of treatments and tests--has come of age in the last two decades. But it has deep roots in health care, with notable landmarks in (1) the mid eighteenth-century development of empiricism, (2) the twentieth century interest in outcomes and variation in health care, and (3) the pioneering work of Archie Cochrane and others in the 1970s. Three main forces have driven the recent developments of HTA: a combination of concerns about the adoption of unproven technologies, rising costs, and an inexorable rise in consumer expectations. The HTA response, essentially initiatives supporting the provision of reliable synthesised research information on the effects and costs of health technologies, have been well supported in the United Kingdom and internationally. We can be sure that HTA is here to stay.\n\nHealth technology assessment (HTA) has increasingly become a valuable tool to examine effectiveness, quality of care, patient outcomes, and cost-effectiveness of health care technologies. In 1994 and 1995, a survey was conducted to document the scope of worldwide HTA activities; 103 organizations from 24 countries responded. This paper summarizes the results of this international survey, including a description of each country&#39;s program, types of technologies assessed, methodologies used, and dissemination approaches. Results for Canada, the United States, and European and other countries are presented separately."
