In Leicester, the chance of a wet day over the course of February is decreasing, starting the month at 28% and ending it at 22%.\n\nFor reference, the year's highest daily chance of a wet day is 31% on November 2, and its lowest chance is 21% on April 27.\n\nOver the course of February in Leicester, the chance of a day with only rain decreases from 26% to 21%, the chance of a day with mixed snow and rain remains an essentially constant 1% throughout, and the chance of a day with only snow remains an essentially constant 0% throughout.\n\nRainfall\n\nTo show variation within the month and not just the monthly total, we show the rainfall accumulated over a sliding 31-day period centered around each day.\n\nThe average sliding 31-day rainfall during February in Leicester is essentially constant, remaining about 1.3 inches throughout, and rarely exceeding 2.6 inches or falling below 0.4 inches.\n\nThe lowest average 31-day accumulation is 1.3 inches on February 22.\n\nAverage Monthly Rainfall in February in Leicester\n\nSun\n\nOver the course of February in Leicester, the length of the day is rapidly increasing. From the start to the end of the month, the length of the day increases by 1 hour, 48 minutes, implying an average daily increase of 3 minutes, 52 seconds, and weekly increase of 27 minutes, 3 seconds.\n\nThe shortest day of the month is February 1, with 9 hours, 2 minutes of daylight and the longest day is February 29, with 10 hours, 50 minutes of daylight.\n\nThe latest sunrise of the month in Leicester is 7:47 AM on February 1 and the earliest sunrise is 55 minutes earlier at 6:52 AM on February 29.\n\nThe earliest sunset is 4:49 PM on February 1 and the latest sunset is 53 minutes later at 5:42 PM on February 29.\n\nDaylight saving time is observed in Leicester during 2024, but it neither starts nor ends during February, so the entire month is in daylight saving time.\n\nFor reference, on June 20, the longest day of the year, the Sun rises at 4:40 AM and sets 16 hours, 52 minutes later, at 9:32 PM, while on December 21, the shortest day of the year, it rises at 8:13 AM and sets 7 hours, 38 minutes later, at 3:51 PM.\n\nThe figure below presents a compact representation of the sun's elevation (the angle of the sun above the horizon) and azimuth (its compass bearing) for every hour of every day in the reporting period. The horizontal axis is the day of the year and the vertical axis is the hour of the day. For a given day and hour of that day, the background color indicates the azimuth of the sun at that moment.

Lower dew points feel drier and higher dew points feel more humid. Unlike temperature, which typically varies significantly between night and day, dew point tends to change more slowly, so while the temperature may drop at night, a muggy day is typically followed by a muggy night.\n\nThe chance that a given day will be muggy in Leicester is essentially constant during February, remaining around 0% throughout.\n\nFor reference, on August 9, the muggiest day of the year, there are muggy conditions 0% of the time, while on October 1, the least muggy day of the year, there are muggy conditions 0% of the time.\n\nHumidity Comfort Levels in February in Leicester\n\ndry 55Â°F comfortable 60Â°F humid 65Â°F muggy 70Â°F oppressive 75Â°F miserable\n\nWind\n\nThis section discusses the wide-area hourly average wind vector (speed and direction) at 10 meters above the ground. The wind experienced at any given location is highly dependent on local topography and other factors, and instantaneous wind speed and direction vary more widely than hourly averages.\n\nThe average hourly wind speed in Leicester is gradually decreasing during February, decreasing from 12.9 miles per hour to 12.4 miles per hour over the course of the month.\n\nFor reference, on January 6, the windiest day of the year, the daily average wind speed is 13.3 miles per hour, while on July 26, the calmest day of the year, the daily average wind speed is 9.5 miles per hour.\n\nThe hourly average wind direction in Leicester throughout February is predominantly from the west, with a peak proportion of 39% on February 1.\n\nWater Temperature\n\nLeicester is located near a large body of water (e.g., ocean, sea, or large lake). This section reports on the wide-area average surface temperature of that water.\n\nThe average surface water temperature in Leicester is essentially constant during February, remaining around 41Â°F throughout.\n\nThe lowest average surface water temperature during February is 41Â°F on February 18.\n\nGrowing Season\n\nDefinitions of the growing season vary throughout the world, but for the purposes of this report, we define it as the longest continuous period of non-freezing temperatures (≥ 32Â°F) in the year (the calendar year in the Northern Hemisphere, or from July 1 until June 30 in the Southern Hemisphere).\n\nThe growing season in Leicester typically lasts for 7.0 months (214 days), from around April 11 to around November 11, rarely starting before March 13 or after May 4, and rarely ending before October 15 or after December 7.\n\nThe month of February in Leicester is very likely fully outside of the growing season, with the chance that a given day is in the growing season gradually increasing from 0% to 4% over the course of the month.\n\nTime Spent in Various Temperature Bands and the Growing Season in February in Leicester\n\nfrigid 15Â°F freezing 32Â°F very cold 45Â°F cold 55Â°F cool 65Â°F comfortable 75Â°F warm 85Â°F hot 95Â°F sweltering\n\nGrowing degree days are a measure of yearly heat accumulation used to predict plant and animal development, and defined as the integral of warmth above a base temperature, discarding any excess above a maximum temperature. In this report, we use a base of 50Â°F and a cap of 86Â°F.\n\nThe average accumulated growing degree days in Leicester are essentially constant during February, remaining within 2Â°F of 7Â°F throughout.\n\nSolar Energy\n\nThis section discusses the total daily incident shortwave solar energy reaching the surface of the ground over a wide area, taking full account of seasonal variations in the length of the day, the elevation of the Sun above the horizon, and absorption by clouds and other atmospheric constituents. Shortwave radiation includes visible light and ultraviolet radiation.\n\nThe average daily incident shortwave solar energy in Leicester is increasing during February, rising by 1.0 kWh, from 1.0 kWh to 2.0 kWh, over the course of the month.\n\nAverage Daily Incident Shortwave Solar Energy in February in Leicester\n\nAverage Daily Incident Shortwave Solar Energy in February in LeicesterFeb112233445566778899101011111212131314141515161617171818191920202121222223232424252526262727282829290.0 kWh0.0 kWh0.5 kWh0.5 kWh1.0 kWh1.0 kWh1.5 kWh1.5 kWh2.0 kWh2.0 kWh2.5 kWh2.5 kWh3.0 kWh3.0 kWh3.5 kWh3.5 kWh4.0 kWh4.0 kWh4.5 kWh4.5 kWh5.0 kWh5.0 kWhJanMarFeb 11.0 kWhFeb 11.0 kWhFeb 292.0 kWhFeb 292.0 kWhFeb 111.4 kWhFeb 111.4 kWh\n\nTopography\n\nFor the purposes of this report, the geographical coordinates of Leicester are 52.639 deg latitude, -1.132 deg longitude, and 213 ft elevation.\n\nThe topography within 2 miles of Leicester contains only modest variations in elevation, with a maximum elevation change of 167 feet and an average elevation above sea level of 228 feet. Within 10 miles contains only modest variations in elevation (1,043 feet). Within 50 miles also contains very significant variations in elevation (1,722 feet).\n\nThe area within 2 miles of Leicester is covered by artificial surfaces (99%), within 10 miles by cropland (45%) and grassland (30%), and within 50 miles by cropland (58%) and grassland (23%).\n\nData Sources\n\nThis report illustrates the typical weather in Leicester, based on a statistical analysis of historical hourly weather reports and model reconstructions from January 1, 1980 to December 31, 2016.\n\nTemperature and Dew Point\n\nThere are 3 weather stations near enough to contribute to our estimation of the temperature and dew point in Leicester.\n\nFor each station, the records are corrected for the elevation difference between that station and Leicester according to the International Standard Atmosphere , and by the relative change present in the MERRA-2 satellite-era reanalysis between the two locations.\n\nThe estimated value at Leicester is computed as the weighted average of the individual contributions from each station, with weights proportional to the inverse of the distance between Leicester and a given station.\n\nThe stations contributing to this reconstruction are:\n\nEast Midlands Airport (EGNX, 50%, 16 mi, northwest, 92 ft elevation change)\n\nRAF Cottesmore (EGXJ, 30%, 21 mi, east, 246 ft elevation change)\n\nBirmingham Airport (EGBB, 20%, 29 mi, southwest, 112 ft elevation change)\n\nTo get a sense of how much these sources agree with each other, you can view a comparison of Leicester and the stations that contribute to our estimates of its temperature history and climate. Please note that each source's contribution is adjusted for elevation and the relative change present in the MERRA-2 data.\n\nOther Data\n\nAll data relating to the Sun's position (e.g., sunrise and sunset) are computed using astronomical formulas from the book, Astronomical Algorithms 2nd Edition , by Jean Meeus.\n\nAll other weather data, including cloud cover, precipitation, wind speed and direction, and solar flux, come from NASA's MERRA-2 Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis . This reanalysis combines a variety of wide-area measurements in a state-of-the-art global meteorological model to reconstruct the hourly history of weather throughout the world on a 50-kilometer grid.\n\nLand Use data comes from the Global Land Cover SHARE database , published by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.\n\nElevation data comes from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) , published by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.\n\nNames, locations, and time zones of places and some airports come from the GeoNames Geographical Database .\n\nTime zones for airports and weather stations are provided by AskGeo.com .\n\nMaps are © OpenStreetMap contributors.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThe information on this site is provided as is, without any assurances as to its accuracy or suitability for any purpose. Weather data is prone to errors, outages, and other defects. We assume no responsibility for any decisions made on the basis of the content presented on this site.\n\nWe draw particular cautious attention to our reliance on the MERRA-2 model-based reconstructions for a number of important data series. While having the tremendous advantages of temporal and spatial completeness, these reconstructions: (1) are based on computer models that may have model-based errors, (2) are coarsely sampled on a 50 km grid and are therefore unable to reconstruct the local variations of many microclimates, and (3) have particular difficulty with the weather in some coastal areas, especially small islands.\n\nWe further caution that our travel scores are only as good as the data that underpin them, that weather conditions at any given location and time are unpredictable and variable, and that the definition of the scores reflects a particular set of preferences that may not agree with those of any particular reader.\n\nPlease review our full terms contained on our Terms of Service page."
