Vehicles were among the categories to post a sales decline. Above, a dealer in Highlands Ranch, Colo. DAVID ZALUBOWSKI/ASSOCIATED PRESS looking at rental units that it defines as affordable. The group finds only seven million homes affordable for people with extremely low incomes (defined as at or below the poverty line, or below 30% of the median income in their area). But 3.3 million of those homes are occupied by people who aren’t extremely low income, leaving only 3.7 million affordable homes actually available to the lowestincome households. Because there are 11 million such households, and 3.7 million affordable units, the NLIHC puts the gap at 7.3 million units. That isn’t the same as a shortage in the overall stock of homes. In fact, the group calculates more rental units than renters. The NLIHC therefore cautions that raising overall supply won’t necessarily address the shortfall of affordable homes. In theory, when new homes are built, “households with sufficient income move into the new housing, making available their previous and older housing to other households, who in turn leave behind even older units, and so on,” a process called filtering, it says. In practice, it says, this chain often breaks down before the lowest-income households benefit. In weak markets, many properties will simply be abandoned or put to different use; in strong markets, older units become targets for rehabilitation. Fannie Mae also looks at affordability, but for renters and homeowners. It examines “affordable housing,” for those earning as much as 60% of median income, and “workforce housing,” for those earning 120%, and comes up with 4.4 million too few houses at these price points. Fannie concludes the U.S. needs to not just build units but preserve existing units: “In most metros, the rehab of an existing unit to extend its useful life is cheaper than building a new unit.” Up for Growth estimates the total number of units needed as the number of households, plus the number of households that should have formed but didn’t beTHE NUMBERS | By Josh Zumbrun How Many Homes the U.S. Really Needs How many new homes does the U.S. need to build to restore normalcy to the housing market? While everyone seems to agree there’s a housing shortage, there’s little agreement on its magnitude. The National Low Income Housing Coalition says the U.S. has a shortage of 7.3 million units, Realtor.com says 6.5 million, mortgage-finance company Fannie Mae says 4.4 million and Up for Growth, a policy group focused on the housing shortage, says 3.8 million units. John Burns Research & Consulting, a realestate industry consultant, puts it at just 1.7 million. Even in a country like the U.S., with around 142 million housing units, that’s quite a range. The reason is that the estimates aren’t all making the same claim. It shows how asking slightly different questions about the same problem can lead to significantly different answers. An economist would say that so long as prices are free to adjust, a true shortage doesn’t exist: There are homes available to anyone willing to pay the going price. That’s of little comfort to anyone who has been to an open house with a line snaking around the block, or searched in frustration just for something in somewhat decent shape in a somewhat decent location that meets their budget. To most people, if homes available aren’t affordable, that’s a shortage. “There’s a sense that it feels right because housing is so expensive,” said John Burns, his firm’s CEO. It’s fairly straightforward to count the number of U.S. housing units—the Census Bureau does. As recently as 2010, Census takers drove or walked every street in the U.S. In 2020, they used satellite imagery. The tricky part is figuring out how many homes there ought to be. Realtor.com’s approach is to compare new houses to new households. It puts new household formation since 2012 at 15.6 million and the number of single-family homes that began construction in that period at 9.03 million, yielding a gap of 6.5 million. But not everyone lives or aspires to live in a singlefamily home. Apartments and condos are an important part of the U.S. housing stock. Accounting for those units, the gap shrinks to 2.3 million, according to Realtor.com. (The Wall Street Journal and Realtor.com are both owned by News Corp.) The National Low Income Housing Coalition begins by cause housing wasn’t available, plus 5% to account for normal vacancy rates as housing units turn over. Up for Growth assumes that people should have formed households at the same ages as they did in the year 2000. The fact that they haven’t, the group concludes, reflects a shortage. No doubt some people haven’t formed a household for that reason, but since 2000, people spend more time in school, marry later and have kids later, which could all delay household formation. So these estimates might overstate the number of units that need to be built. Mr. Burns’s firm looks at demographics and vacancies, concluding that fewer households should have been formed than you would expect looking at the year 2000, and noting that housing vacancies were still elevated until the past few years—implying that many places in the U.S. were overbuilt from the early 2000s housing boom. As a result, it thinks the shortage is 1.7 million, lower than most other estimates, but “still a big number,” Mr. Burns said. If his number is right it’s a reason for some optimism that shortages can be resolved with a few years of solid construction, rather than requiring an unprecedented and sustained housing boom. The number of households formed over the past decade exceeds the number of housing units where construction has started. Lower construction over the past 10 years followed a period of heavy building during the early 2000s.

Declining retail sales “is the type of slowing policy makers would want to see,” said Sonia Meskin, an economist at BNY Mellon Investment Management. “The consumer has remained overall remarkably resilient in the face of rate rises by the Fed,” she said. The U.S. economy grew at a solid pace in the first quarter, recent data indicate, in part reflecting a surge in January retail spending. The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta’s gross domestic product tracker on Friday estimated a 2.5% growth rate for GDP in the first quarter, only slightly slower than late last year. S&P Global Market Intelligence on Friday estimated 1.9% growth in the first quarter, and a 0.2% contraction in the second quarter. The Commerce Department’s first-quarter GDP reading is due later this month. The retail-sales report mainly captures spending on goods rather than most services such as travel, rent and utilities, offering only a partial picture of spending. The Commerce Department will release more complete figures later this month. Spending on air travel was robust in March, but outlays on other services such as hotels declined, transaction data from Bank of America credit and debit cards showed. And the cost of shelter has increased faster than the overall rate of inflation, federal data show. Some Americans have had to make adjustments to allow them to keep spending. Victor Mendez, 64 years old, recently started working as a substitute teacher in Orange County, Calif., partly to supplement his Social Security income. “It’s pretty good money, and I can pick the days I want to work,” he said. Mr. Mendez looks for savings where he can and recently purchased a new Subaru vehicle with a good financing deal and “decided at that interest rate it would be OK.” While his rent has gone up, he said he had noticed some prices starting to come down, such as chicken breasts at the grocery store. Recent data suggest many consumers are more cautious about purchases of goods they often have to borrow money to buy. In March, spending declined in big-ticket categories including vehicle sales, electronics, furniture, and at home-improvement and department stores. “The current challenges in the used auto industry are well documented,” CarMax Inc. Chief Executive Bill Nash said on a call with analysts this week, “with affordability pressured by broad inflation, climbing interest rates, tightening lending standards and prolonged low consumer confidence.” Consumer sentiment ticked up slightly in April but remained at a subdued level, the University of Michigan said Friday. Spending increased online in March, and rose slightly at bars and restaurants, the Commerce Department said. Analysts say lower tax refunds compared with last year were also a factor holding down spending in March. The amount refunded to taxpayers through March 31 was 10.4% lower than in 2022, the Internal Revenue Service said. And an extra boost in food-stamps assistance for low-income households that Congress authorized at the start of the pandemic ended in a number of states in March as well. From a year earlier, retail sales increased 2.9% in March, the smallest gain since June 2020. American consumers cut their retail spending for the second straight month in March, adding to signs of a slowing economy. Shoppers pulled back on purchases of items such as vehicles, furniture and appliances amid climbing interest rates. Overall purchases at stores, restaurants and online declined a seasonally adjusted 1% in March from the prior month, the Commerce Department said Friday. Consumers also spent less on gasoline, reflecting a downward trend in prices. The decline in retail sales could suggest that higher interest rates are working to slow the economy as Federal Reserve officials have intended. They think economic activity needs to ease to bring down inflation, which has cooled recently but remains stubbornly high. Fed officials have signaled they could raise rates again at their meeting early next month. Manufacturing output, which is also sensitive to interest rates, declined 0.5% in March from the prior month, and is down from a year earlier, the Fed said in a separate report.

Median rent fell 0.4% to $1,937 in March from a year ago, according to a report released Friday by Redfin Corp. It was the first annual decline since March 2020, when the pandemic began, the real-estate company said. The drop brought rents to their lowest level in 13 months. Rents remained 19.9% higher than they were at the pandemic’s beginning three years ago, Redfin said. Rents grew over much of the pandemic as a rise in homesale prices kept some people from buying and drove demand for rentals. In recent months, rents have been falling. Analysts say that is because of an increase in new apartment construction along with weaker consumer sentiment, which may be drawing people away from signing pricey leases. Rents peaked in 2022 as wages rose and millennials started families, leading them to seek bigger places, Redfin said. Still-high inflation has people paying more for groceries and many other items, said Daryl Fairweather, Redfin’s chief economist. That has some looking to save on housing, sometimes by getting roommates, she said. “There are fewer people willing to splurge on rentals right now,” Ms. Fairweather said. “If one landlord charges too much, they can go to the next,” she added. Other surveys have shown recent rent declines. Renters with new leases in January paid a median rent that was 3.5% lower than they would have paid last August, according to estimates from listing website Apartment List. It was the first time in five years that rent fell every month over a six-month period, according to the same estimates. According to Redfin, the biggest decline was in Austin, Texas, where rents fell 11% in March, to $2,104, from the same month a year ago. In Chicago, they fell more than 9%, to $2,206. Big cities that saw rent declines of 3% or less included Atlanta, Houston, Las Vegas, New Orleans and Phoenix. Rents rose the most in Raleigh, N.C., up nearly 17% to $2,080. In Cleveland, they were up more than 15%, to $1,530. BY JOSEPH PISANI AND TALAL ANSARI Rent Prices Post First Yearly Fall Since 2020 Fed’s Waller Touts Further Tightening A Federal Reserve official said he was prepared to approve another interest-rate increase because recent banking-system stresses haven’t produced a significant pullback in lending while high inflation remains supported by strong growth. “Monetary policy needs to be tightened further,” Fed governor Christopher Waller said in a speech Friday in San Antonio. “I would welcome signs of moderating demand, but until they appear and I see inflation moving meaningfully and persistently down toward our 2% target, I believe there is still more work to do.” The Fed raised its benchmark interest rate by a quarter percentage point last month to a range between 4.75% and 5%, extending the fastest pace of rate hikes since the early 1980s. Some central-bank officials this week signaled support for pausing rate rises after one more increase at their next meeting, May 2-3. But Mr. Waller pointed to stronger-than-anticipated economic activity so far this year and stubbornly high inflation in concluding that the outlook currently supported tighter monetary policy. Moreover, slow progress in bringing down inflation suggests “monetary policy will need to remain tight for a substantial period of time and longer than markets anticipate,” Mr. Waller said. Mr. Waller acknowledged greater uncertainty stemming from the failures of two midsize banks that has fueled fears of a broader lending pullback, particularly if changes to banks’ business models prompt them to curtail lending. Surveys of bank lending officers had pointed to tighter lending standards before last month’s bank failures prompted the Fed to intervene. The banking-sector stress “might have solidified and pulled forward factors that were already working to tighten lending conditions, or it may be that credit conditions will now be even tighter than they were on track to be,” he said. “All else equal, a significant tightening of credit conditions could obviate the need for some additional monetary policy tightening, but making such a judgment is difficult, especially in real time.” —Nick Timiraos\n\nTHE WALL STREET JOURNAL. **** Saturday/Sunday, April 15 - 16, 2023 | A3 U.S. NEWS BOSTON—Jodi Swenson was working a nursing shift at Boston’s Brigham and Women’s Hospital 10 years ago when patients started flooding in with blast and shrapnel wounds. On a typical day, she would expect one or two trauma patients at a time. But on April 15, 2013, two pressure-cooker bombs had just exploded near the Boston Marathon finish line. “We’re getting patient after patient after patient and we’re like, oh my God,” she said. Saturday marks the 10- year anniversary of a terrorist attack and its aftermath that led to four deaths and more than 260 injuries. The city will mark the moment with events including wreath layings. And then two days later, the 127th Boston Marathon will be run on Monday. Ms. Swenson’s first patient after the blasts was Gillian Reny, an 18-year-old injured while cheering on her sister’s run with her parents. Her right leg was particularly hurt, with significant bone loss and muscle damage, according to the hospital. She would spend more than a month, combined, in that hospital and a rehabilitation facility. On Monday, Ms. Swenson, still a nurse in the ER, will run her first Boston marathon to raise money for the trauma-research center Ms. Reny’s family launched. Ms. Reny will be cheering from a tent on the course’s “Heartbreak Hill,” and her sister, father and fiancé are running, too. They are among many Bossaid of the marathon. Those injured at the bombing sites included 17 people who would lose parts of one or both legs. First responders, medical volunteers and local trauma centers acted swiftly, and everyone who was transported to hospitals from the scene survived. “They did amazing work,” said Paul Norden, a Stoneham, Mass., man who lost one of his legs above the knee. His brother also lost part of a leg. Boston EMS Chief Jim Hooley said the department had prepared for years by studying tragedies in other places, including the 9/11 attacks and Oklahoma City bombings. Marc Fucarile lost his right leg above the knee and nearly lost his left. The 44-year-old said he also still has metal shrapnel in his heart. “I’m reminded every day,” he said. Mr. Fucarile now works as a motivational speaker. He plans to participate in this year’s race on a handcycle to raise money for a local foundation that helps families hit by tragedies. Some bombing survivors speak to a sense of responsibility they carry to serve as ambassadors for the city’s resilience. Gabe Martinez, a U.S. Marine Corps veteran who lost his legs to an improvised explosive device in Afghanistan, told marathon survivors that they had to allow for those tough moments. “You can have your ‘amputee days,’ ” he said, which he described as “a day where you can say life sucks.” Mr. Martinez quickly flew to Boston after the bombing from Colorado, with backing from the nonprofit Semper Fi & America’s Fund, along with other wounded veterans to support the bombing survivors.

U.S. NEWS the pandemic, mifepristone has been available to women up to 10 weeks pregnant, and they have been able to get prescriptions through telehealth appointments and have the medication sent by mail. By 2020, more than half of U.S. abortions were done with medication, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research organization that supports abortion rights. Mifepristone also has other uses, including for miscarriage management. In the Biden administration’s emergency appeal, U.S. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar said the lower-court orders “would upend the regulatory regime for mifepristone, with sweeping consequences for the pharmaceutical industry, women who need access to the drug, and FDA’s ability to implement its statutory authority.” Danco Laboratories in its petition said the lower-court rulings created “debilitating uncertainty for Danco that threatens its very existence.” An antiabortion lawsuit challenging mifepristone’s approval should have been thrown out at the outset, the government said, because the plaintiffs’ objection to the drug is based on opposition to abortion, not any harm they personally have suffered from its approval decades ago. The challengers, although they include doctors, “neither take nor prescribe mifepristone, and FDA’s approval of the drug does not require them to do or refrain from doing anything,” the government said. The mifepristone case is the latest aftershock of the Supreme Court’s 2022 decision rescinding abortion rights the justices had recognized in 1973. In overturning Roe v. Wade, which set out women’s constitutional right to end pregnancy before fetal viability, the court said it was ending a 49-year effort to impose a nationwide settlement on a divisive question of public policy and personal morality. “We do not pretend to know how our political system or society will respond to today’s decision,” Justice Alito wrote for the majority in Dobbs v.

Officials from the VA and Oracle Corp., which last year acquired the company that developed the system, are in discussions about changes in the contract designed to provide the VA with a record system. The system was adopted, in large part, because it is used by the Department of Defense and the Coast Guard and is designed to provide seamless medical records for troops from the time they enlist until the day they die. While some in Congress have called for cancellation of the project, VA officials said they needed to push forward to replace the agency’s VistA electronic health record system. The new system, developed by Cerner Corp., has had problems from the start. Such systems provide a digital version of a patient’s paper chart, allow authorized providers to share information with other providers and afford access to information relevant to a patient’s care. Since the contract was signed in 2017, only five of the VA’s more than 170 locations have adopted it. It has been linked to patient safety issues, including difficulties with prescription processing, medication management, clinical referrals and identifying patients at risk of suicide. Oracle acquired Cerner nine months ago and Ken Glueck, an Oracle executive vice president, said the parent company has been working to improve the system. —Ben Kesling NEW JERSEY DEP Faults Itself for Damaging Habitat New Jersey’s Department of Environmental Protection has charged itself with damaging habitat for threatened and endangered birds that it was supposed to protect.

The department acknowledged it sent a violation notice and threatened penalties against its own Division of Fish and Wildlife regarding unauthorized work in February and March at the Glassboro Wildlife Management Area in Clayton, Gloucester County. It was unclear how any penalties might work when the DEP is both the accuser and the accused. It also wasn’t immediately clear whether any money might actually change hands.

In a unanimous decision, the justices said people and businesses subjected to administrative proceedings at the Federal Trade Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission can seek to enjoin, or block, those proceedings by suing in U.S. District Court and raising constitutional arguments there. The opinion dealt with two related cases, Axon Enterprise v. FTC and SEC v. Cochran. While it addressed a narrow jurisdictional question, it highlighted the court’s increasing skepticism toward administrative tribunals run by agencies. Writing for the court, Justice Elana Kagan said all the relevant factors “point in the same direction—toward allowing district court review of…claims that the structure, or even existence, of an agency violates the Constitution.” Plaintiffs will now move forward in lower courts with arguments that administrative law judges are too difficult for the president or his appointees to remove, violating the separation of powers. Friday’s decision didn’t address those questions. Justice Kagan wrote that the FTC isn’t well-suited to deciding constitutional questions about its own power. While joining the unanimous decision, Justice Clarence Thomas wrote a separate opinion to reiterate his concerns about tribunals run by administrative agencies. The FTC and SEC argued the parties to the administrative proceeding must wait to lose at the agency tribunal before they can raise such constitutional questions in federal court. The FTC case dates back to 2018, when Axon Enterprise, based in Scottsdale, Ariz., said it was buying a smaller competitor in the market for police body cameras, Vievu LLC, for $13 million. In January 2020, the FTC brought an administrative action to unwind the consummated merger, saying the deal had lessened competition in a concentrated industry. Axon sued the FTC, seeking an order blocking the enforcement action. Axon raised constitutional arguments about the FTC’s structure more broadly, arguing the agency tramples on due-process rights by combining “investigatory, prosecutorial, adjudicative, and appellate functions within a single agency.” The federal judge assigned to Axon’s case dismissed it, saying the company first has to raise its constitutional arguments in the FTC’s in-house tribunal. Axon eventually asked the Supreme Court to weigh in. In the SEC case, Michelle Cochran, an accountant accused of professional misconduct, disputed the commission’s ability to bring an enforcement action seeking to suspend her in its administrative law court. Ms. Cochran in 2019 asked a federal district court to find the SEC’s in-house courts unconstitutional because its judges can’t be easily removed by the president or his appointees. She was aided by a Supreme Court ruling the prior year, which found the government’s practice for hiring SEC administrative-law judges to be defective. “We are thrilled that the Supreme Court has unanimously vindicated Michelle Cochran’s right to have her day in court to challenge the constitutionality of the administrative apparatus she has fought for nearly a decade against the SEC,” said Ms. Cochran’s lawyer, Latham & Watkins partner Gregory Garre.

MIKE SEGAR/REUTERS ganization, but whatever that may be, “the authority to regulate abortion must be returned to the people and their elected representatives.” But if the Supreme Court thought it had washed its hands of the issue, the mifepristone case demonstrates that litigation will remain a central arena where abortion rights are contested. The lawsuit, Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine v. FDA, was filed in November by a group of antiabortion doctors and healthcare organizations who allege the government’s 2000 approval of mifepristone was so flawed that it must be voided now. Although they don’t prescribe mifepristone themselves, they argued that the drug’s approval in 2000 put them at risk of having to treat a patient who might suffer complications from its use. Judge Kacsmaryk’s 67-page decision, which said that mifepristone cannot have therapeutic benefit because pregnancy isn’t an illness, was to take effect Friday absent appellate court intervention. Almost immediately after, a federal judge in Spokane, Wash., Obama appointee Thomas Rice, issued an opinion preventing the FDA from changing access to mifepristone in the 17 states and the District of Columbia that had filed a suit arguing that current regulations on the drug’s dispersal were more restrictive than federal law allows. Wednesday’s decision from a divided three-judge panel of the Fifth Circuit found it was likely too late to contest the 2000 approval but left intact Judge Kacsmaryk’s injunction of subsequent changes in regulations while litigation proceeded. “We look forward to explaining why the FDA has not met its heavy burden to pause the parts of the district court’s decision that restore the critical safeguards for women and girls that were unlawfully removed by the FDA,” said Erin Hawley, a lawyer with Alliance Defending Freedom, an advocacy group that represents the plaintiffs. WASHINGTON—The Supreme Court temporarily blocked lower court orders that would have limited access to the abortion drug mifepristone beginning Saturday, preserving the pill’s availability while the justices weigh the Biden administration’s emergency request to leave Food and Drug Administration approvals in place during a legal battle with antiabortion groups. In a pair of orders Friday, Justice Samuel Alito, who oversees emergency matters for the lower courts that limited or suspended approval of the widely used abortion pill, gave the antiabortion groups until noon Tuesday to file briefs in response to appeals filed by the FDA and Danco Laboratories LLC, which makes the branded version of the drug, Mifeprex. The temporary orders expire at 11:59 p.m. Wednesday, suggesting a high court decision on whether and to what extent mifepristone will remain available during litigation may come by then. Antiabortion plaintiffs are challenging both the FDA’s 2000 approval of mifepristone and subsequent regulations starting in 2016 that relaxed the stringent conditions for the drug’s administration, such as a requirement for three in-person doctor visits. A late Wednesday order from the Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans rolled back mifepristone access to the pre-2016 regulations, which limited its use to women pregnant for seven or fewer weeks, required three inperson doctor visits to receive and barred sending to patients through the mail. That decision partially blocked an opinion the previous Friday by a federal district judge in Amarillo, Texas, Matthew Kacsmaryk, that would take the drug off the market by suspending its 2000 FDA approval.

Ron DeSantis late Thursday signed into law a bill banning abortion after six weeks of pregnancy, a strict measure that could garner him support from Republican primary voters if he runs for president but that also carries political risks among the broader electorate. The law has limited exceptions, including for rape and incest, and for certain medical emergencies. It isn’t poised to take effect immediately but is contingent on any of several potential occurrences, most notably the state Supreme Court ruling that the state constitution contains no right to abortion in a pending case challenging the current 15-week ban. The bill earlier Thursday passed the Florida House 70 to 40, mostly along party lines with a handful of Republicans voting against it. It passed the Senate earlier this month, also with a couple of Republican senators in more vulnerable districts voting against it. —Laura Kusisto\n\nTHE WALL STREET JOURNAL. ****** Saturday/Sunday, April 15 - 16, 2023 | A5 U.S. NEWS the bill say it is unclear what would happen if TikTok users employed a workaround to download the app, such as a virtual private network that makes it seem their devices are logging in from outside Montana. Friday’s vote in Helena was the latest setback to TikTok’s campaign to remain operating in the U.S. Despite Montana’s relatively small population of a little more than one million people, the company had hired Helena-based lobbyists and recruited local TikTok creators to appear in newspaper ads to fight the bill. Some TikTok leaders were concerned that a statewide ban in Montana could trigger a domino effect that could lead other states—and perhaps Congress—to follow suit, The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this month. Helena has become the latest demonstration of the bipartisan and nationwide momentum to ban TikTok over national security concerns. In Washington last month, Democrats and Republicans at a congressional hearing grilled TikTok’s chief executive over his company’s ties to China. A Pew Research Center survey a week later found that 50% of Americans supported a TikTok ban, with 22% opposed and 28% indicating they were unsure. The Biden administration recently asked TikTok to separate itself from its parent company ByteDance or to face a possible ban, the Journal reported last month. Some Congress members and Biden administration officials said they are concerned that the Chinese government could force TikTok to spy on its 150 million U.S. users or to distribute propaganda. TikTok said it would refuse to comply with such a request—and that it has proposed a $1.5 billion plan to the Biden administration that would silo its U.S. operations from China’s influence. Montana lawmakers on Friday approved a first-of-itskind bill to ban TikTok across the state, setting the stage for future court battles that could determine the fate of the popular, Chinese-owned socialmedia app in the U.S. The Montana House voted 54-43 to send the bill to Gov. Greg Gianforte’s desk. The governor’s office declined to say whether he would sign the bill but noted Mr. Gianforte had previously banned TikTok on government-issued devices and urged the state university system to do the same. The bill says the ban would go into effect on Jan. 1, 2024. It would prohibit TikTok, owned by Beijing-based ByteDance Ltd., from operating within the state, and would also bar app stores from offering TikTok within the state. It would fine any entity violating this law $10,000 per violation. It is unclear how some elements of the legislation would be enforced. Once the governor receives the bill, he has 10 days to act on it before it automatically becomes law. The bill’s authors ahead of the vote said they expect legal challenges that could ultimately reach the U.S. Supreme Court should Mr. Gianforte sign the legislation. Critics including the American Civil Liberties Union said the bill amounts to censorship and violates free-speech rights protected under the First Amendment. A TikTok spokesperson said the company will “continue to fight for TikTok users and creators in Montana whose livelihoods and First Amendment rights are threatened by this egregious government overreach.” App store-providers Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google didn’t respond to a request to comment.

Ahead of Friday’s sentencing, the Justice Department recommended a nearly 16-year prison term for Mr. McCaughey. Mr. McCaughey’s defense lawyer, Dennis Boyle, earlier suggested a year-long sentence but said at Friday’s hearing he would “concede that is too low” and instead recommended a two-year prison sentence. “Jan. 6 is over. It’s done,” Mr. Boyle said. The sentence fell below the 10-year prison term that Thomas Webster, a former New York City police officer, is currently serving after being convicted of violently assaulting a police officer in a melee outside the Capitol. That remains the longest sentence ordered in a case related to the Jan. 6, 2021, attack. Federal prosecutors described Mr. McCaughey’s conduct as “heinous” and recounted a violent scene where dozens of rioters joined him in a “heave-ho” push against a police line defending a door into the Capitol. Mr. McCaughey gained control of a police shield, prosecutors said, and headed to the front of the mob, where he came face-to-face with D.C. Metropolitan Police Officer Daniel Hodges. Mr. McCaughey apologized for his role in the Capitol assault, describing his conduct as the “greatest embarrassment of my life.” From now on, he said, anyone can go online and find a “video of me behaving like a thug.” In an address to Judge McFadden, Officer Hodges said a day doesn’t pass without him remembering the Jan. 6 attack and police officers’ efforts to defend the Capitol. “Of all the weapons used that day, the most effective was the mob,” he said. Of Mr. McCaughey, Officer Hodges added, “He was not just part of the mob. He was at the vanguard of the assault.” WASHINGTON—Among the most searing images of Jan. 6, 2021, was a police officer, bloodied and pinned inside a doorway, screaming for help as a rioter at the front of a proTrump mob pushed against him with a stolen riot shield. More than two years later, that rioter received one of the lengthiest prison sentences to date in a prosecution stemming from the attack on the U.S. Capitol. A federal judge on Friday sentenced Patrick McCaughey of Connecticut to 7½ years in prison after finding him guilty in September of assaulting police and obstructing Congress’s certification of the 2020 presidential election results. Mr. McCaughey elected to have a so-called bench trial, leaving it up to Judge Trevor McFadden rather than a jury to review evidence and render a verdict. Handing down the sentence, Judge McFadden said Mr. McCaughey, 25 years old, had become a “poster-child of all that was dangerous and appalling” about the Capitol assault.

DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE/ASSOCIATED PRESS ‘Of all the weapons used that day, the most effective was the mob.’ SAN FRANCISCO—Nima Momeni stabbed Cash App founder Bob Lee to death after the pair left the apartment building where Mr. Momeni’s sister lived, prosecutors alleged in a court filing Friday. While prosecutors would not say what occurred in the apartment, a court filing said the two men discussed the suspected killer’s sister earlier in the day and that Mr. Momeni had been angry at Mr. Lee. San Francisco District Attorney Brooke Jenkins gave the most detailed account of Mr. Lee’s final day alive in a motion to detain Mr. Momeni without bail filed Friday and in a news conference later in the day. Mr. Momeni was arrested on suspicion of murder Thursday in a case that has rocked Silicon Valley. Ms. Jenkins didn’t provide a specific motive for the killing, which occurred in the early morning hours of April 4. But much of the narrative her office presented revolved around Mr. Momeni’s younger sister, identified by Ms. Jenkins as Khazar Momeni. Earlier Friday, a judge ordered that Mr. Momeni be held without bail while awaiting his arraignment, which was postponed until April 25 because the lead defense attorney is out of town. Robert Canny, an attorney for Mr. Momeni, said the facts of the case will come out during the course of the trial. Mr. Canny didn’t respond to a request to comment on the filing Friday afternoon. Ms. Momeni could not be reached for comment. Her husband, a prominent San Francisco plastic surgeon, did not respond to requests for comment. The couple declined to speak with the media before Friday’s court hearing. According to the filing, Mr. Lee and Ms. Momeni were drinking and talking with others on the afternoon of April 3 at a home in San Francisco, a witness told police. The witness said that Mr. Momeni’s sister “was married but the relationship had possibly been in jeopardy.” Ms. Jenkins said that Mr. Lee was a friend of Ms. Momeni but declined to elaborate. Mr. Lee and the witness left and went to the Cash App founder’s hotel room, where Mr. Lee and Mr. Momeni engaged in a phone conversation about Ms. Momeni. Mr. Momeni questioned Mr. Lee “regarding whether his sister was doing drugs or anything inappropriate,” the witness told police. Mr. Lee reassured Mr. Momeni that nothing inappropriate occurred, the witness said. Later that night, Mr. Lee allegedly went to the Millennium Tower, an expensive San Francisco apartment building where Ms. Momeni lived. Surveillance video showed Mr. Lee, wearing black clothing, entering the building at 12:39 a.m., the filing said. Mr. Lee and Mr. Momeni rode down the elevator at the Millennium Tower together at around 2:03 a.m. and got into Mr. Momeni’s white BMW Z4, according to the filing. The pair drove a short ways before getting out of the car. The two figures stood together for about five minutes, after which Mr. Momeni stabbed Mr. Lee three separate times, including twice in the chest, prosecutors alleged. “One of the stab wounds, showing a direct and clear intent to kill, penetrated [Mr. Lee’s] heart,” the filing said. Mr. Momeni then threw down the kitchen knife he had used and drove away, leaving Mr. Lee to die, according to the court filing.

Bird flu, which spreads and kills easily, has felled 58 million farmed birds in the U.S. BRANDON BELL/GETTY IMAGES The Federal Aviation Administration said it has sent more than 250 cases of unruly passengers to the Federal Bureau of Investigation since 2021. The FAA said that of the thousands of unruly airline passengers in recent years, it referred some of the most violent ones to the FBI. They had assaulted flight attendants, released the evacuation slide and tried to enter the flight deck, among other things. The FBI reviews the cases to determine whether the unruly passengers should face criminal charges in addition to fines from the FAA, the agencies said. It is against federal law to harass, assault or threaten a crew member. “If you act out on a plane, you should just stay at home because we will come after you with serious consequences,” Acting FAA Administrator Billy Nolen said Thursday. “We have zero tolerance for unruly behavior.” There have been more unruly passengers in the skies since the coronavirus pandemic began, according to FAA data. BY ALYSSA LUKPAT To stop the devastating global bird-flu outbreak that has killed over 100 million poultry, the U.S. and Europe are embracing a tactic many countries have long resisted: vaccines. The U.S. and parts of Europe don’t routinely inoculate poultry against bird flu, which emerges every few years and spreads and kills easily, but typically recedes after domestic birds are culled. Groups representing U.S. poultry companies have historically opposed vaccinating birds over concerns that inoculation could imperil trade. There are also questions about the logistics and cost of administering shots that must be injected into each chick or egg. But the unprecedented destruction of this outbreak, which has felled 58 million farmed birds in the U.S. and is running into its third year in Europe, has driven governments and businesses to search for options. Animal-health and pharmaceutical companies including Zoetis Inc., Ceva Animal Health, Boehringer Ingelheim and Merck & Co. have developed vaccines that are in testing. The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s research service expects results from tests of four vaccines in chickens in late May or early June, said Erica Spackman, a bird-flu expert at the agency. Two test vaccines were made by USDA labs and two were developed for past flu outbreaks by Merck and Zoetis. Tests in turkeys and ducks will follow. If effective, any vaccine would need additional approval within the agency before wider use. France, the world’s top producer of foie gras, this month said it intends to buy 80 million vaccine doses and invited companies to bid for government contracts. The current dominant strain globally is a version of the H5N1 virus that triggered destruction in Europe in 2021. It was detected in U.S. wild birds in January 2022, and a few weeks later was found in commercial turkey flocks. More than 58 million commercial or backyard birds have died, with detections of the virus in wild birds in 49 states, according to the USDA. In the past few months, South American countries have reported contagious, deadly bird flu for the first time. It has also sickened and killed mammal species including skunks, raccoons, bobcats, bears, seals and mountain lions. The seasonal virus has shifted to linger for years in wild birds, which pass it to commercial birds. “It’s a biological change in the virus,” said David Swayne, a former director of a USDA laboratory that studied the disease. “I don’t think we know genetically what’s changed, but it’s changed such that it’s spread through the wild bird population.” The persistent circulation in wild birds is “absolutely novel” for the Americas, said Richard Webby, an influenza virologist at the Department of Infectious Diseases at St. Jude’s Children’s Research Hospital in Memphis, Tenn. Water birds are likely hosts of the virus, and with the spring migration to the North- “Traditionally, countries have not traded with countries that vaccinate,” said John Clifford, a former chief veterinary officer at the USDA and a consultant on trade for the USA Poultry and Egg Export Council. Objections range from concerns that some vaccinated birds will still get sick to the high cost of surveillance required of flocks after a vaccination round, Dr. Clifford said. The National Chicken Council, which represents companies that produce about 95% of U.S. chickens bred for meat, opposes vaccination because it would threaten $5 billion in annual chicken exports, said spokesman Tom Super. France has backed tests of two vaccines in ducks, including an RNA vaccine made by French company Ceva tailored to the current strain of the virus. Another set of French tests involve a vaccine developed by German pharmaceutical and animal-health company Boehringer Ingelheim that contains a synthetic birdflu virus surface protein, hemagglutinin, that is injected into the birds, said Jean-Luc Guérin, chair of avian biosecurity at the National Veterinary School in Toulouse. In preliminary results reported in March, one research group said that two of four vaccines tested protected chickens against infection by the current variant and prevented the transmission of the disease, according to Sjaak de Wit, professor of veterinary medicine specializing in poultry viruses at Utrecht University in the Netherlands and a member of the team that conducted the tests. The two effective vaccines, one made by Ceva and the other by Boehringer Ingelheim, both involve a harmless turkey virus that is engineered to include genetic instructions to make hemagglutinin, the bird-flu protein. It isn’t clear how to stop the virus among wild birds, said Daniel Perez, a virologist at the College of Veterinary Medicine at the University of Georgia. “We have to think beyond the chickens in the chicken house,” Dr. Perez said. ern Hemisphere under way, scientists are watching for a surge in cases. Some countries have endemic versions of the bird-flu virus and regularly vaccinate poultry.

He is in a Mexican prison and the U.S. has requested his extradition. The other so-called Chapitos remain at large. Some of the indictments offered a detailed and brutal history of how the Chapitos consolidated their rule over much of the Sinaloa cartel in recent years, expanding their fentanyl business since 2014 when Ovidio Guzmán set up the cartel’s first laboratory. During one meeting in 2022, Ovidio Guzmán acknowledged that fentanyl users can die if the mixture is just a little “off,” the indictment said.

The Sinaloa cartel uses a network that includes aircraft, submanyl for distribution in the United States,” Mr. Garland said. The U.S. Treasury also imposed sanctions on two firms in the People’s Republic of China and five people based in China and Guatemala for their alleged role in supplying precursor chemicals to Mexican drug cartels. Over the past 18 months, the Drug Enforcement Administration has infiltrated the Sinaloa cartel and the cartel faction led by Mr. Guzmán’s sons, said DEA head Anne Milgram. That faction, called the “Chapitos,” are Iván Guzmán, 40 years old, Alfredo Guzmán, 37, Joaquín Guzmán López, 36, and Ovidio Guzmán, 33, U.S. authorities said. The agency had obtained “unprecedented access to the definite state of above-normal inflation among the biggest risk factors. The banks had to pay more for funding, which will likely be even more damaging for the smaller banks that start reporting earnings next week. Executives said recession chances have increased. And with some institutions like First Republic Bank still in trouble, the banking turmoil could make a broader economic downturn more likely. JPMorgan, Wells Fargo and Citigroup all built up their rainy-day funds in the first quarter. Together, the three banks set aside nearly $2 billion for potential bad loans. Wells Fargo said its stash partly reflected an increase for commercial real-estate loans, particularly office loans, which have been under pressure throughout the industry. “We expect to see more stress over time,” Wells Fargo Chief Financial Officer Mike Santomassimo said on a call with analysts, referring to the office market. What’s more, clients big and small are battening down their own hatches. Mortgage underwriting has collapsed in the face of high interest rates. Investment banking and underwriting remain slow. Trading revenue at JPMorgan and Citigroup slipped. More Americans started to fall behind on car loans and credit cards last year, according to the New York Fed, pressured by interest rates and higher prices on staples like food and gasoline. At all three banks, credit-card delinquencies ticked up from a year ago, and more borrowers carried over balances each month. The chances of recession have risen, said Citigroup finance chief Mark Mason, though the bank expects any downturn to be mild. “What’s going to matter is how mild or how severe the recession is,” he told reporters. “When you look at the economic indicators, that’s still tough to tell.” In minutes released this week, the Fed disclosed that its staff forecast last month that the U.S. economy could enter a recession this year. Fed officials said last month that the bank turmoil is expected to lead to a pullback in lending, which would slow economic growth. The big banks said Friday they weren’t materially changing their own lending plans. “I wouldn’t use the word credit crunch,” JPMorgan Chief Executive Jamie Dimon said on a call with analysts. Despite the windfall from some smaller-bank customers, deposits are becoming less plentiful and more expensive. The stress at banks has prompted some customers to move their money to Treasurys and money-market funds. Between the end of December and the end of March, deposits rose at JPMorgan, but fell at Citigroup and Wells Fargo as businesses and wealthy customers moved their money in search of higher rates. Wells Fargo said it could continue to see “moderate” declines in overall deposits in the coming months as banks compete for customers. JPMorgan expects some of the inflows it got in March to leave the bank later this year. “By definition, these are somewhat flighty deposits because they just came into us,” said Jeremy Barnum, JPMorgan’s finance chief, on a call with analysts. “It’s prudent and appropriate for us to assume that they won’t be particularly stable.” —Charley Grant and Peter Rudegeair contributed to this article. damaged several others. Yet they were a boon for the big banks, which were able to rapidly increase the amount they charge for loans to consumers and corporate giants. The glut in deposits they have collected over the past several years means they aren’t under as much pressure to increase deposit rates as some smaller banks. The difference is minting revenue for them. JPMorgan’s net interest income—what it makes on loans minus what it pays depositors—rose 49% to a record $20.71 billion. At Wells Fargo, it rose 45% and at Citigroup it was up 23%, both to more than $13.3 billion. For 2023, JPMorgan now expects to earn around $81 billion in one measure of net interest income, an increase of $7 billion from its forecast three months ago.

There remain many more opportunities for which the timing might be more fitting as presidential leadership becomes even more necessary.” Mr. Pompeo, a former Kansas congressman who did stints atop the Central Intelligence Agency and State Department in the Trump administration, has suggested for months that he would seek the Republican Party’s nomination. But he failed to generate much enthusiasm among core GOP voters, who remain loyal to Mr. Trump. Others have shifted support to Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who is second in most polls. Mr. DeSantis is expected to soon join the contest but has seen his standing slip against Mr. Trump. The former president has rallied Republicans around him as he faces an indictment in New York on hush-money charges and other legal difficulties, portraying himself as a victim of a Democratic conspiracy. Mr. Trump cited his improved position in polls in a speech Friday before the National Rifle Association.

BY ALEX LEARY AND LINDSAY WISE Pompeo Rules Out ’24 Bid for President\n\nTHE WALL STREET JOURNAL. **** Saturday/Sunday, April 15 - 16, 2023 | A7 the National Assembly. The judges, however, struck down some articles of the legislation, such as measures to help senior workers find employment. The law is set to take effect on Sept. 1, concluding its tumultuous journey through France’s legislative system. But the judges’ decision is unlikely to silence the uproar that has shaken the nation. The overhaul has come at a steep political price for Mr. Macron, sowing uncertainty about the stability of his government and the health of French democracy. Mr. Macron and his allies went into the fight confident that Parliament would approve the twoyear rise in the retirement age to 64 by 2030. When lawmakers rebelled, Mr. Macron exercised Article 49.3 of the French constitution, allowing him to circumvent Parliament. The fallout has left Mr. Macron’s parliamentary ranks in disarray, while fueling national debate about whether it is time to rein in the presidential powers. It also has fueled support for far-right leader Marine Le Pen, who opposes the measure. More than a million people have marched in weekly protests, some of them violent, calling for Mr. Macron’s resignation. “Tonight, there are no winners or losers,” French Prime Minister Élisabeth Borne said. Mr. Macron faces an uphill battle in enacting the rest of his pro-business agenda. His government is working on a labor bill to reduce unemployment. He also wants to require companies that buy back shares to give employees bonuses. Thousands of protesters took to the streets Friday as the council delivered its ruling. “The Constitutional Council’s decision won’t change the mind of an entire nation, which is determined not to let this pension reform pass,” said farleft lawmaker Mathilde Panot. Some union leaders and opposition lawmakers have vowed to continue their fight, saying the changes will penalize people who started working at a young age and often have physically demanding jobs. Mr. Macron’s pension-system revamp lies at the center of his efforts to make France’s economy more competitive and reduce the national deficit. He says the measures are necessary to preserve the pension system without raising taxes or increasing the debt. Polls show the French public is overwhelmingly opposed to the change, and the president’s approval rating has reached its lowest point since the yellow-vest protest movement plunged his first term into a crisis in 2018. The French leader’s party no longer has the commanding majority in Parliament that defined his first term in office. Ms. Le Pen, who leads the largest opposition party in the National Assembly, has tried to channel the public’s frustration with the overhaul into votes for her far-right National Rally. A recent survey of 1,808 people by polling firm Elabe showed Ms. Le Pen would be elected president by a 10-point margin if elections were held this month with the same candidates as last year. “But what do you want me to do? Burn cars? We’ll just tell the French: Vote for the National Rally,” she said this week. PARIS—President Emmanuel Macron’s plan to raise the country’s retirement age cleared the final hurdle to becoming law with the approval of France’s Constitutional Council, providing relief to his embattled government after a monthslong showdown with unions and millions of protesters. The court’s nine judges ruled that Mr. Macron’s government didn’t violate the constitution in shepherding the legislation through Parliament. That process included the government’s contentious use of constitutional powers to pass the overhaul without a vote in BY NOEMIE BISSERBE French Court Approves Plan to Increase Retirement Age Hezbollah, Hamas and others marks a growing threat to Israel—and a challenge for the U.S. while other powers such as China and Russia are attempting to play larger roles in the Middle East. Among Tehran’s chief objectives is to prevent its neighbors from establishing diplomatic ties with Israel. In the past two years, Iran has publicly warned them against participating in U.S.-backed efforts to create a regional alliance to isolate Tehran. Saudi Arabia’s surprise agreement to renew diplomatic ties with Iran was a significant blow to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s main foreign-policy goal of normalizing relations with Riyadh— and a reminder that the Islamic Republic remains a potent force in the region, as the U.S. has frequently warned.

The details of the attack were finalized in Gen. Qaani’s meetings in Beirut, including with Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh and his deputy Saleh alArouri and Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah, the people said. Rockets also were fired at Israel from Gaza and Syria, and Israel responded by launching airstrikes against what it said were militant targets in those areas. Israel fears more onslaughts on multiple fronts, and the country’s military said it has reinforced its Iron Dome air defense. Israel has cause for concern. Gen. Qaani’s effort to unite Tehran’s allies is a sharp escalation in the undeclared war between Iran and Israel after Israel carried out hundreds of attacks targeting Iran and its proxies across the Middle East. It also reflects the growing influence of Gen. Qaani, who succeeded Qassem Soleimani, the charismatic Quds Force leader who was killed in a U.S. airstrike in Baghdad in 2020. Gen. Qaani generally has played a quieter, less visible role than his predecessor. But his recent work marshaling fire, Israeli forces remain on high alert for further cross border attacks.

Tensions usually are high on Quds Day, but this year Jews and Muslims celebrate overlapping holidays—the Passover festival and Ramadan—with thousands of people congregating in the Old City of Jerusalem, which is a flashpoint for confrontations. Then there is growing military confrontation between Iran and Israel. Iranian officials have said recent Israeli strikes in Syria killed several IRGC military advisers. Iran often avoids publicly blaming Israel for attacks that kill its personnel in Syria and at home, as that would put pressure on Tehran to retaliate. This time was different; among those killed was also a close adviser to the IRGC leadership, the people said.

Suspect Is Charged Over Leak launches a broad U.S. effort to exert pressure on Russia. Mr. Gershkovich now faces what specialists in Russia’s legal system said will be a lengthy court process with scant hope of acquittal. Mr. Gershkovich addressed the letter to his “dear family”—his mother, father Mikhail and sister Danielle. The family recently spoke out for the first time since their son’s arrest, in a video interview with the Journal. Ms. Milman, 66, said she felt “great joy” upon receiving the letter, because she is finally hearing first-hand how he is doing. “These are my son’s words, not someone else telling me,” she said. “And his spirit is shining.” As he faces allegations of espionage, all of Mr. Gershkovich’s prison meetings and correspondence will be monitored by Russia’s security services, and court proceedings will be held before a judge behind closed doors, according Continued from PageOne The platform’s chief legal officer, Clint Smith, said in a blog post Friday that the document disclosures were originally shared in a small, invite-only server on Discord, in an apparent violation of the platform’s rules, which prohibit using it for illegal or criminal purposes. But while the original server has been deleted the documents have appeared on other servers, he said. Airman Teixeira has held a top secret security clearance since 2021 as required for his job, according to the charging document. He serves in an intelligence unit of the Massachusetts Air National Guard and is a junior Air Force communications specialist, according to his service record. He had been serving under a federal status, U.S. officials said, making him eligible to potentially face charges under the Uniform suit, had entered the courtroom in Boston shortly after 10 a.m. Friday and conferred with his public defender, Brendan Kelley, ahead of the hearing. A person in the courtroom yelled, “Love you, Jack,” as he was led away after the hearing. Airman Teixeira was ordered to be held in custody until a detention hearing on Wednesday. The two charges against him bear a maximum combined penalty of 15 years in prison. According to a charging document, investigators were able to check logs of classified information kept by government computer systems and see that the airman had accessed some of the documents that had been posted online in February. Discord turned over server records to the FBI, according to the complaint, which led federal agents to be able to identify Airman Teixeira. leaker of the documents. The leak appears to have exposed details of U.S. surveillance of adversaries and allies, touching off diplomatic storms with U.S. partners and raising worries about undermining Ukraine’s fight against Russia. President Biden, in a statement on Friday, said he had “directed our military and intelligence community to take steps to further secure and limit distribution of sensitive information.” Attorney General Merrick Garland told reporters Friday, “This is not just about taking home some documents, that is, of course, itself illegal. This is about both the unlawful retention and transmission of the documents.…There are very serious penalties associated with that.” Airman Teixeira, shackled and wearing a tan prison jumpthe charging document said. A member of that group told investigators that Airman Teixeira initially posted government information to the group as paragraphs of text but began posting photographs of documents in January, according to the charging document. The group member told investigators that Airman Teixeira mentioned in a conversation that he had become concerned about being discovered making transcriptions of text at work, so he began taking documents home and photographing them. In April, as the documents spread online, the airman used his government computer to access classified intelligence reporting to search for the word “leak,” in what investigators say was an attempt to assess whether the intelligence community knew the identity of the ment, the classified material started appearing online as early as December 2022. The charging document unsealed Friday also offered glimpses into how investigators identified Airman Teixeira as the suspect with the help of billing records from Discord and through interviews with at least one other member of the tightknit group that the airman allegedly ran on that platform. The group was formed “to discuss geopolitical affairs and current and historical wars,” Continued from PageOne to the Russian legal specialists. So far, Mr. Gershkovich has only been allowed visits from his Russian lawyers. He has not yet been allowed to see friends or officials from the U.S. Embassy in Moscow, despite repeated demands for access. In the letter, Mr. Gershkovich confirmed he received a care package, arranged by a friend and containing sundries such as toiletries, slippers, clothes and pens, to ease his life in confinement at Moscow’s notorious Lefortovo prison, run by Russia’s Federal Security Service, or FSB, the successor to the KGB. “I now have more clothes and stuff than mom and dad at home, I think,” he wrote. Lefortovo traditionally has held high-profile inmates including Soviet author Alexander Solzhenitsyn, several 1991 coup plotters against Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev and former U.S. Marine Paul Whelan, who has been held since 2018. Mr. Gershkovich is the first overseas journalist to be charged with espionage by Russia since the Cold War. In a nod to the emotional toll his imprisonment is taking on his family members, he acknowledged that they would probably like to smack him. “Don’t worry. You will have your chance to do it,” he wrote. He signed the letter with his nickname: “Until we meet soon. Write me. Vanya.” Translation from the Russian of the last excerpt of the letter: “I love you very-very much and hug you tightly. I received your words of support from the lawyers yesterday. Thank you very much. Until we meet soon. Write me - Vanya.” ELLA MILMAN Journalist ‘Not Losing Hope’ Watch a Video Scan this code for a video on the handling of classified documents. The people in the online spaces where Airman First Class Jack Teixeira spent his time and allegedly leaked highly classified documents had many things in common. In obscure game forums and private online chat rooms, his friends posted violent slurs against Black, gay and trans people, Jews, Ukrainians and pretty much everyone else. Everyone, that is, except Russians. Members of that small community, hosted on the socialmedia app Discord, admired President Vladimir Putin’s regime and its war on Ukraine. Airman Teixeira was arrested by federal agents in Dighton, Mass., on Thursday and charged in a Federal courthouse in Boston with unlawfully taking and sharing what appeared to be briefing materials for high-level civilian and military leaders. Charging documents tie him to his online community by using billing records from Discord and interviews with at least one other member of his online community. Those documents, however, revealed little about why the 21-year-old low-level analyst from a small town in Massachusetts allegedly stole and shared details of U.S. surveillance of adversaries and allies. The leak has set off diplomatic storms between the U.S. and its allies, and most acutely, has spilled into public view material that could undermine Ukraine’s fight against Russia. Airman Teixeira’s life online offers a window into a particular subset of game culture, where trolling is common and the line between opinion and provocation blurred. That culture increasingly mirrors the wider U.S. political discourse where pundits and aspiring lawmakers have found fame and power in strategically deploying the profane, the offensive and the absurd—often in the form of a meme or a quickwitted online repartee. As federal authorities began closing in, Airman Teixeira appears to have purged much of his online presence, but The Wall Street Journal attempted to reconstruct his activities from web archives. They reveal a young man with an intense interest in weapons and videogames—and the places where both converged. On the popular videogame platform Steam, he was in groups with names like “3rd Light Infantry Company” and “The Cobalt Brotherhood”— communities that brought people together where they could jointly play online games while at the same time trash-talking on voice-and-chat services like Discord. Handles associated with Airman Teixeira also had accounts on websites dedicated to collecting weapons and swapping tactical gear. From a young age, he nursed a fascination with history, especially the minutiae of weapons and armaments used in famous battles, a classmate recalled. “He was just really into the whole, like, gun and war thing, more than, like, normal people were,” said Brooke Cleathero, 21, who said she attended history class with Airman Teixeira at Dighton-Rehoboth Regional High School. “He just wore a lot of camo.” The case also shows the difficulty of keeping secrets online. Airman Teixeira allegedly shared the documents with a small group of associates in an invite-only space, according to the criminal complaint filed by the U.S. government. He first transcribed and later posted photographs of classified material in the Discord server “Thug Shaker Central,” itself an obscene and racist reference. The server was set up “to discuss geopolitical affairs and current and historical wars,” says the criminal complaint. But one of those online friends took the classified documents Airman Teixeira allegedly smuggled out and shared them with an even larger internet community, where they were eventually noticed by mainstream media outlets, Russian Telegram propaganda accounts and eventually federal authorities, who arrested Mr. Teixeira after a short investigation. The member of the Discord group who distributed the documents to a wider audience was a California teenager named Lucca Swinson. Mr. Swinson appears to have nursed an interest in the continuing war in Ukraine and the activities of Russian troops. On Feb. 3, a post on a Twitter account associated with Mr. Swinson, which has now been deleted, requested to buy combat patches of Wagner, the Russian paramilitary force notorious for extrajudicial executions, from a British YouTuber who as antiwar. “He was just into collecting militaria and other gear goods,” wrote Vahki, a member who used a cartoon of a Russian soldier as the image for his avatar on Steam, a popular gamer community. Tweets from both accounts are now no longer visible to the public. The original Discord channel inside Thug Shaker Central where Airman Teixeira allegedly leaked hundreds of classified documents was called “Bears vs Pigs,” a name that echoes Russian memes that depict Ukrainians as hapless pigs mauled by the mighty Russian bear. Airman Teixeira appears to have scrubbed his social media clean in the anticipation of his arrest. The affinity for Mr. Putin, displayed by members of Airman Teixeira’s community, echoes the sympathies for Russia sometimes found in the populist strain of American conservatism, where Mr. Teixeira is now being viewed with sympathy. Almost immediately after Thursday’s arrest, Airman Teixeira was treated as a hero by several prominent members of the populist wing of American conservatism, where many have vocally supported Mr. Putin and criticized the Biden administration’s multibillion-dollar assistance to Ukraine. “He told the truth about troops being on the ground in Ukraine and a lot more,” tweeted Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R., Ga.), who has campaigned to end aid to Ukraine. “A 21-year-old gamer might have just prevented WWIII,” posted Jack Posobiec, a former Navy intelligence officer who promoted the Pizzagate conspiracy theory that led to the QAnon movement. Top Republicans in Congress took a different view. House Foreign Affairs Committee chairman Michael McCaul (R., Texas) has called the leaks “a serious breach of U.S. national security” and praised authorities for the arrest. —Daniella Cheslow, Till Daldrup and Alicia Caldwell contributed to this article. had just returned from Russian-occupied eastern Ukraine. The next day, a post from the Twitter account showed a screenshot from a video that had been released by Wagneraffiliated social media showing the execution of Ukrainian soldiers. Last month, another post added that he only likes Russia more than Ukraine because of its superior music. His SoundCloud account, viewed by the Journal, includes songs of the Russian proxy militia in the Donbas. Calls to numbers associated in public records with one of Mr. Swinson’s social-media accounts, and to his father, went unanswered. A woman at a residence in Southern California linked to his father said Mr. Swinson wasn’t home. Reached by phone, Mr. Swinson’s mother said she had no comment.
