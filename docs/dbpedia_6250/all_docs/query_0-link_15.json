We learn from Washington that Mr. McCulloch is con¬ templating the issue this month or in October of the long delayed five per cent Government loan. He has by law the power to emit, if necessary, gold-bearing bonds, to represent the 73 millions of temporary deposits he is now paying off, and also the certificates of indebtedness, and other shortdated obligations which he has already met. There is also no doubt that the time will come when five per cent, bonds of the United States will command par both here and abroad. Two or three months ago we favored the proposal that an experiment should be made of issuing with the most circum¬ spect caution a small amount of five per cent, bonds to be followed by further issues if the temper of the public mind should justify it. At the time when this suggestion was made, every thing seemed to conspire to make this movement a probable success, the chief points we relied on being that NO. 62. during the dead season of the financial year the money mar¬ ket was easy; while capital was abundant, and might proba¬ bly become more so, inasmuch as foreign capital would, in the disturbed state of things abroad, flow naturally to this side, and seize upon so eligible an investment as a long five per cent, bond, the principal and interest of which are pay¬ able in gold. This propitious aspect of our financial affairs, however, was not continued. The procrastination of financial measures by Congress, and still more, the unfortunate sales of Govern¬ ment gold in May last disturbed all - calculations. And at this moment Ten-forties have scarcely reached par ; although the dull season is over, the money market is beginning to be more active, and the most propitious opportunity for putting out the loan has passed away. In the interests of economy we wish we could believe that the five per cents would stand a fair chance of being successfully negotiated ; but our appre¬ hensions are all the more confirmed by the experience of last year, when, by a singular fatality, the inert summer season was allowed to pass without any Treasury negotiation; and in October, ^when business was becoming active, and the crops South and West were being moved, a loan of 50 mil¬ lions was put out, the consequence being a perturbation of the money market, and a decline of some 20 millions in the temporary deposits in the Sub-Treasnry. If, however, a five per cent, loan would, for the present, have little prospect of success, there is another course that has been suggested, to which there seems less objection. The sixes of 1SG5, it is urged, are now selling at a handsome premium. The Treasury gets no benefit from this premium, which is absorbed and engrossed by speculators. Mr. McCulloch, it seems, should therefore sell for cash at the market price a daily amount of bonds, so that he may gain for the public coffers some of the benefit resulting from the im¬ provement of the public credit. We believe the Secretary has sold few bonds for more than 1 per cent, premium ex-in¬ terest, and no bonds whatever at a higher rate for cash than 3 per. cent, premium. He will now have the opportunity of selling them at considerably higher rates, and will thus add to his available Another resources. objection to the project of putting out a five per cent, loan at the present moment is the obstacle it would of¬ fer to any efficient contraction of the currency. To keep a five per cent, loan floated now would require an inflation'of the currency, and the mischievous results on general prices, on the cost of living, and on the well-being and comfort of the masses of our fellow-citizens, are too obvious, too unpopular THE CHRONICLE. 258 and have been too often realized to need word of that they [September 1,1866. available.

REGISTERED BONDS vs. COUPON BONDS. The only absolute security for the owner of a coupon bond It has often been remarked upon as a matter of surprise, is to have it exchanged for a registered bond. If he loses it, that so large a part of our national debt is in the unsafe form of coupon bonds, liable to be destroyed by fire, lost by nobody but himself can draw the interest when due, nobody val from disappro¬ draw the or same rate of interest, mature at the same time, and the coupon bonds may be converted into the registered bonds at&he will of the owner, who has only to take the trouble of sending them to Washington for that purpose. There are several points suggested by this anomaly which merit exami¬ nation. As to the immediate cause The bonds in which it exists twenties of are not so convert your us. purloined by thieves. We might suppose, at first sight, that the registered bonds being safer, would bring a larger price in the market. But this is not so. However con¬ trary to antecedent probability the reverse is true, as a glance at our Stock Exchange report will show. For the first time in the history of the Government, a singular anomaly has, in the past week, been exhibited, of a difference of four per cent, between the quotations for registered United States bonds and coupon bonds of the same issue. Intrinsically, the two species of bonds are of the same value; for they aooident, • a 1862, which of it there is are known no as doubt at the old all. five- but himself claim the principal at maturity. The safety is thus as complete as, in the nature of things, human care and legislative arrangements can make it. But there is an¬ other difficulty. Suppose the owner of a registered bond wants to convert it back again. He cannot do it, and this very circumstance prevents many persons from* converting their coupon bonds, for the latter are more easily bought and sold. If you wish to sell a coupon bond, all you have to do is to deliver it to the buyer, to get your money on the spot, and the transaction is closed. With a registered bond, there is the delay of sending it to Washington for transfer, and, for two months of every year, you cannot even do this, for the books close during the months of April and October, preparatory to the May and November payment of interest, and in the interval you cannot transfer your bonds to a pur¬ chaser on the Government books. This difficulty has been met by an assignment in blank, as it is termed, which really takes away for the time being the special security of the registered bond, as a fraudulent bolder might avail himself in the blank assignment which you have signed, and might thus be enabled probably to sell the bond. Rather than submit to these inconveniences, most persons prefer to hold the coupon bonds. Now it has been suggested that these and other inconveni¬ ences attaching to the ownership of registered bonds might be obviated by having the transfer books kept in New York. can exclusively dealt in in Europe that no other species are a good delivery in fulfill¬ The bonds of 1865, which are really ment of contracts. more valuable as they have three years longer to run, are not as yet known in the European market, though an effort is making to get them introduced there. Hence it is that the orders from abroad run exclusively on the old five-twenties, and of course registered bonds are useless for exportation, Nine-tenths of the business in Government securities is done coupon bonds being alone negotiable abroad. Now it is in this city, and it is obviously for the convenience of the easy to see that when from any circumstances a very lively foreign demand springs up for our bonds, the coupon old oeople, for the interest of bond-holders, and, therefore, for the five-twenties will exclusively be called for, and the supply in interest of the Government, that the transfers should be made market being limited, their price will go up, while that of lere, instead of a at place so far removed as Washington from the other bonds may be either stationary or will at least be the great metropolitan centre of trade/ finance and com¬ ' less lively in their upward movement.

This, however, is not quite the whole of the case. We our own citizens we must, for we can, protect them.

The promptness with which European population has flowed hither to fill the vacuum caused by the war is an illustration of the readiness with.which the irregularities in the world’s labor market are adjusted. It is in this very principle of self-regulation that we must confide for recovery from the effects of the loss of producing population during the last four years, and for such a re-inforcement of the ranks of labor as will restore the lost equilibrium between produc¬ tion and consumption, and assist to bring us back to the former range of values. The efforts of the agents might have been very reasonably anticipated that the circumstances connected with the war would materially in¬ terfere with the course of emigration to the United States.

He venerated -'Hume as a good man and a great philosopher, and entertained little respect for the clergy, yet, at the same time, had a special admiration of Calvin, and a profound interest in the old theologians, from Tertullian downward. He held in the ex¬ istence of Truth beyond what appeared to the senses—phenomenal existence. “ The sphere of our belief,” said he, “ is much more ex tensive than the sphere of our knowledge; and, therefore, while I deny that the infinite ,can by ns be known, I am far from denying that by us it is, must, and ought to be believed.” Yet, he positive¬ ly declared that it was impossible to speculate about the Absolute. Sir William holds that the central fact of the phenomenal of dual¬ ism or antithesis of two series of phenomena, given immediately in consciousness—the one constituting the ego or mind, and the other, was a phenomenal is not a dualism at all, simply a stream, a flow, a succession of feelings, sensations, or states of consciousness. All knowledge, all belief, all known exist¬ ence has been generated out of this succession of sensations, or 16,464,264 66 Treasury with Sinking thoughts.

Atlantic Telegraph see end of this lcttc r. [From our own Correspondent.] London, Saturday, August 18,1S66. For latest news b y position of affairs has at length substantially improved, the Di¬ England having reduced their minimum rate of discount to the extent of two, or to eight per cent. The point at which it previously stood was ten, and was raised to that figure ou the 12th of May last. The ten per cent, rate of discount was therefore in existence for a period of more than three months, and for a longer time than has been recorded in past crisis. With the greatly increased resources of their establishment, the Bank Directors could have followed no other policy ; and as it was generally known on Wednesday last that the stock The mortgage bonds Erie shares, 100 dollars, all paid Illinois Central. 100 dollars, all paid...

The progress of the Bank toward a full recovery of strength has been more rapid than was at this period last week anticipated. The money market may [now be considered to have regulated itself. The continuance of stringent terms of discount having caused so considerable a falling off in trade, and in the requirements of the the leading communinity, that the supply of capital has m a slight degree exceeded the demand. Nevertheless, it is still maintained that the Bank directors committed an error in not reducing their quo¬ tations on the 21st of June last, when the state of the resources would have permitted them to have ventured on such a movement. At that date the reserve of notes and coin in the banking department was greater than at the present time, and it is held now as then, that had the Bank then lowered their rate, confidence would have been rapidly restored both at home and abroad. While instead of foreign capital being withdrawn from this country, supplies of money would been forwarded hither, in order to secure the tempting rate of interest in considerable offered. of discount Vas creating danger in the foreign and provincial capitalists considered, so long as it remained at that point, it was imprudent and unavoidable to lend money, except on the very best security, is pretty generally admitted.

Thk Money Market.—The disbursement of over $20,000,000 by the Sub-Treasury, during the week, on account of redemption of the Temporary Loan, has had less effect upon the money market than was anticipated. A part of the amount paid by the SubTreasury has been in the form of checks, and as many of the checks have not yet been presented for payment the full effect has not been felt. At the same time, there has been a steady movement of cur¬ 700 100 600 1,550 Westward ; which, to a certain extent, has counteracted the 1,50q tendency toward ease. There is, however, a very great abundance of unemployed funds 200 3,550 upon the market; and demand loans are generally made at 4 per 200 4,500 cent., with exceptions both at 3 per cent, and 5 per cent. 500 Discounts are unusually quiet for this season of the year.
