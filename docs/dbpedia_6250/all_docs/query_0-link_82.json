Questionnaire was used to collect the primary data from targeted groups in the population. The findings of this study suggest that the security situation in Kogi state has become a major challenge for investors, and this could pose a threat for its economy with implication for investment and job losses. The present security challenge could diminish the stateâ€™s ability to command local and international respect. The study recommended among others that government of Kogi state should overhaul the security agencies in the state to meet the current security challenges. Provision of new infrastructure as well as mending of dilapidate ones should be carried out in the state. It should be ensured that the major cities have functional street lights to enhance security. Similarly, the state government should create more job opportunities for the teeming number of unemployed youths.in the fair value hierarchy would increase comparability in accounting practice among entities."
