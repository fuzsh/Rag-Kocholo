St Louis (21), Rockefeller (21), Berkeley (20), Yale (18), Illinois (Urbana-Champaign) (18), Pennsylvania (16), Imperial College, London (14), LSE (14), and Liverpool (8), maintain their own impressive lists of Nobel Prizewinning alumni, but their criteria for deciding who is an alumnus vary wildly, and are on the whole different to those here. If only Undergraduate and Graduate Students are counted as having studied at an institution then these totals drop to perhaps 37 for Columbia and 29 for Chicago (compared to up to 48 for Harvard). By the same criteria, Cambridge loses Compton, Hicks, Fowler, Walker, Debreu, Kohler, Greengard, Weinberg, Brenner, Stiglitz, Ramakrishnan, Gurdon and Queloz leaving 83 who were actually students here."
