        "text": "Lived 1903 – 1997.\n\nJohn Eccles was a neurophysiologist. He was awarded the 1963 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for showing how messages pass between nerve cells in mammals, including humans. It was already known that these messages could be excitatory or inhibitory. Eccles discovered that both excitatory and inhibitory processes are chemical in nature, rather than electrical.\n\nAndrew Huxley and Andrew Alan Hodgkin, who were working independently in the same field, also won one-third shares of the 1963 Nobel Prize.\n\nAdvertisements\n\nPersonal and Career Details\n\nFamily and School\n\nJohn Carew Eccles was born on January 27, 1903 in the city of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. His father was William James Eccles and his mother was Mary Carew. Both were teachers. John was homeschooled to age 12, as were his two sisters.\n\nHe attended Warrnambool High School and Melbourne High School. He won a scholarship to study Medicine at the University of Melbourne, where he enrolled at age 17. An enthusiastic athlete, he broke the Australian Universities’ pole vaulting record.\n\nDegrees and Oxford\n\nEccles graduated from Melbourne with first class honors in 1925, age 22.\n\nA Rhodes Scholarship took him to the University of Oxford, where he was awarded a PhD in 1929. His research work was supervised by Charles Scott Sherrington, whose work on neurons earned him the 1932 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. Sherrington coined the term synapse to describe the gap between neurons, and he was a powerful influence on Eccles’s future work. Despite an age gap of 46 years the two became close friends.\n\nAfter the award of his PhD, Eccles continued research work at Oxford for a further eight years, then returned to Australia.\n\nCareer\n\n1937: Director of Pathology at the Sydney Hospital, Australia.\n\n1944: Professor of Physiology at the University of Otago, New Zealand.\n\n1952: Professor of Physiology at the Australian National University, Canberra. He described this time as his scientific golden years: he completed his Nobel prize winning research and published over 400 papers.\n\n1966: Member of the Institute for Biomedical Research, Chicago, USA\n\n1968: Distinguished Professor of Physiology and Biophysics at the State University of New York, Buffalo, USA\n\n1975: Retired.\n\nKarl Popper and Thinking Big\n\nDuring his time in New Zealand, Eccles enjoyed exchanging ideas with the philosopher of science, Karl Popper. Eccles claimed his future work was strongly influenced by Popper’s view that scientific progress is maximized when scientists put forward big, bold, challenging theories with sufficient content to be falsifiable.\n\nGod\n\nEccles was a Christian and occasionally a practicing Roman Catholic. He believed in a Divine Providence that operated over and above the materialistic happenings of biological evolution.\n\nHonors\n\n1958: Knighted for services to physiological research, becoming Sir John Eccles\n\n1962: Royal Medal\n\n1963: Nobel Prize\n\n1963: Australian of the Year Award\n\n1990: Companion of the Order of Australia\n\nPersonal Life\n\nEccles was known to his friends as Jack. In 1928, age 25, he married the New Zealander Irene Frances Miller, a devout Catholic. The couple had nine children: five daughters and four sons. One of his daughters, Rosamond, became a neurophysiologist and worked with him.\n\nIn 1968, when Eccles was 65, Australia’s Civil Service forced him to retire from his job. Eccles moved to America to continue working. At the same time he divorced Irene and married his colleague, the Czechoslovakian neurophysiologist Helena Táboríková. In America he became estranged from his large family in Australia.\n\nDuring his career, Eccles published 19 books (12 as sole author) and more than 500 scientific papers.\n\nAt age 72, he retired and, with his second wife, Helena, relocated to the small Swiss town of Contra. In retirement he wrote prodigiously on the mind-brain problem, which had fascinated him for most of his life.\n\nSir John Carew Eccles died, age 94, in the hospital in Locarno, Switzerland on May 2, 1997. He was survived by Helena and buried in Contra, Switzerland.\n\nAdvertisements\n\nAuthor of this page: The Doc\n\nImages digitally enhanced and colorized by this website. © All rights reserved.\n\nCite this Page\n\nPlease use the following MLA compliant citation:\n\n\"John Eccles.\" Famous Scientists. famousscientists.org. 16 Mar. 2018.
