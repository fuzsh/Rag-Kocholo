        "text": "When Huxley and Hodgkin began their collaboration, in the summer of 1939, Hodgkin had already given the first experimental demonstration of the mechanism by which electrical impulses activate the next segment of a nerve fibre, and had begun to work with the recently discovered giant nerve fibre of the squid.\n\nAt Hodgkin’s invitation, Huxley went down to the Plymouth Marine Laboratory to join him in his research. They strung the fibre up, pushed an electrode down inside it and obtained a direct recording of the voltages across the nerve membrane, the first time that this had been done.\n\nThe chemical processes involved in nerve impulses had been postulated as early as 1902 and were believed to be associated with the permeability of the nerve membrane to potassium ions. According to this theory, the voltage produced by the impulse could not exceed the resting potential of the potassium ions inside the fibre.\n\nTo Huxley’s and Hodgkin’s astonishment, when they stimulated the fibre the range of voltage readings was far higher than they had been led to expect. They repeated the experiment several times and obtained the same results, but the nature of the mechanism responsible was still obscure when the Second World War broke out.\n\nWhen hostilities finally came to an end, Huxley and Hodgkin returned to their research and finally solved the problem. Previously it had been supposed that while the resting membrane was permeable to potassium ions, it was not permeable to sodium ions.\n\nHuxley and Hodgkin suggested that during the rising phase of a nerve impulse, the nerve membrane becomes permeable to sodium ions which diffuse into the fibre, bringing the potential very nearly to the higher resting potential of the sodium ions. During the falling phase of the impulse, potassium ions diffuse out.\n\nIn 1946 they showed that a nerve fibre lost potassium when it was repeatedly stimulated. The next year Hodgkin and Bernard Katz demonstrated that the amplitude of the voltage changed in a predictable way when the sodium concentration in the external solution was changed.\n\nIn the early 1960s Huxley used a post-war computing machine, resembling a typewriter with figures instead of letters, to solve the set of simultaneous equations describing this basic ionic theory of nerve impulses, for which he, along with Hodgkin and Eccles (an Australian physiologist who did related work on nerve cells in the spinal cord), were awarded the Nobel Prize in 1963. The so-called Hodgkin-Huxley model laid the foundations for all subsequent research into the functioning of animal nervous systems.\n\nAndrew Fielding Huxley was born in Hampstead, north London, on November 22 1917 into a notable scientific and literary family. His grandfather was the 19th-century scientist and writer Thomas Henry (TH) Huxley, famously a champion of Darwin; Andrew’s father, Leonard, was for a time a Classics master at Charterhouse and later took up a literary career, writing biographies and editing the Cornhill magazine.\n\nThe children of Leonard’s first marriage included Sir Julian Huxley, the biologist, and the writer Aldous Huxley. After his first wife’s death, Andrew’s father married Rosalind Bruce; Andrew was the younger of the two sons of this second marriage. In later life he recalled that, notwithstanding his father’s literary interests, his parents encouraged his interest in science and practical engineering. There were microscopes in the house and when Andrew was about 12, he and his brother David were given a lathe.\n\nHuxley became intensely interested in microscopy and was soon delighted by his ability to design, make and assemble mechanical objects of all kinds. These practical interests stayed with him throughout his life and, in many important ways, provided the bedrock for his research.\n\nHe was educated at University College School and Westminster, from where he won a scholarship to read Natural Sciences at Trinity College, Cambridge.\n\nAt first, he hoped to specialise in Physics, but stumbled into Physiology almost by accident: “I had to do a third science, as well as the obvious subjects of maths, physics and chemistry. A chum of mine a few years older told me that physiology was a most vital subject, and I would be learning things that were still controversial.” Huxley decided to specialise in the subject, and after graduating in 1939 began working with Hodgkin.\n\nFor the first year of the war Huxley was a clinical student, but when medical teaching in London was interrupted by the Blitz, he changed to work of more immediate use and spent the rest of the war on general operational research in gunnery, first for Anti-Aircraft Command and later for the Admiralty, working in a team under Patrick (later Lord) Blackett.\n\nHodgkin, who was involved in separate work with the Air Ministry on the development of radar, later recalled how, when he was having problems with the development of a new type of gun sight, he relayed his problem to Huxley, who did a few sketches, borrowed a lathe and produced what was required.\n\nIn 1941 Huxley was elected to a research fellowship at Trinity College, Cambridge. He took this up at the beginning of 1946, together with a teaching appointment in the Department of Physiology. He continued to hold college and university posts in Cambridge until 1960, when he became Jodrell Professor and head of the Department of Physiology at University College, London, and from 1969 Royal Society Research Professor.\n\nFrom 1946 to 1951, in addition to his work with Hodgkin, Huxley carried out research with R Stömfli on myelinated nerve fibres. In 1952 he turned to muscle contraction, and developed an interference microscope for studying the striation pattern in isolated muscle fibres. He developed mathematical equations for the operation of myosin “cross-bridges” that generate the sliding forces between actin and myosin filaments, which cause the contraction of skeletal muscles. These equations brought a greater understanding not only of the processes of muscle contraction, but of almost all the movements of cells above the level of bacteria.\n\nHuxley was an editor of the Journal of Physiology from 1950 to 1957, and also of the Journal of Molecular Biology. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1955, and served on its Council from 1960 to 1962.\n\nHe worked at Woods Hole, Massachusetts, in 1953, as a Lalor Scholar. He gave the Herter Lectures at Johns Hopkins Medical School in 1959, and the Jesup Lectures at Columbia University in 1964. In 1961 he took part in an exchange scheme between British and Russian professors and lectured on Neurophysiology at Kiev University.\n\nHe served as president of the Royal Society between 1980 and 1985, using his presidential address in 1981 (as had his ancestor TH Huxley in 1860, defying the wrath of the bishops) to put forward a robust defence of the Darwinian explanation of evolution, countering new theories which suggested that the fossil record tells a story of periods of rapid change when new forms of organisms suddenly appeared. At the same time he admitted that there were lacunae in Darwin’s theory, noting that the question of the origins of life on earth, barely touched upon by Darwin, lay in the realms of speculation and analogy. The biggest problem for biology, “too often swept under the carpet”, was the existence of consciousness.\n\nIn 1983 Huxley defended the Society’s decision to elect Margaret Thatcher as a fellow on the ground of her support for science even after 44 fellows had signed a letter of protest.\n\nHe was elected Master of Trinity, Cambridge, in 1984, after the request of the previous master, Sir Alan Hodgkin, to be allowed to stay on after his 70th birthday had been narrowly and controversially rejected by the fellows. Huxley’s appointment broke the tradition whereby the mastership alternates between a scientist and an arts man.\n\nHuxley was held in great affection by the Trinity fellows and remained Master until 1990. He was as proud of the college as it was of him, and liked to remind interviewers that Trinity had notched up more Nobel Prize winners than the whole of France.\n\nHe was president of the British Association for the Advancement of Science (1976-77) and of the International Union of Physiological Sciences (1986-93).\n\nHe was knighted in 1974 and appointed a member of the Order of Merit in 1983.\n\nAndrew Huxley married, in 1947, Jocelyn Richenda Pease, the daughter of the geneticist Michael Pease and his wife Helen Bowen Wedgwood, a daughter of the 1st Lord Wedgwood. She died in 2003; they had five daughters and a son."
