He was named Chairman of the Department of Surgery in 1884. In 1898, he started the first research laboratory dedicated to studying cancer. It now bears his name.\n\nWhen President McKinley was shot in Buffalo in 1901 at the Pan American Exposition, Dr. Park was summoned to leave an operation in Niagara Falls to go to Buffalo. Before he knew the patient's identity, he reportedly said that he would not leave, \"even if it were for the President of the United States.\" True to his word, he arrived just as another surgeon, Dr. Mann, was finishing up.\n\nReferences:\n\n1.

Gage and Chardack to develop an implantable cardiac pacemaker. Mr. Greatbatch \"constructed several models in his workshop in Clarence, New York.\" After initial animal experiments, the device was tested in human patients at the VA. The pacemaker was deemed safe for use in 1960 and was implanted in patients with chronic heart block and heart rhythm disturbances. In 1996, Dr. Gage wrote: \"The frustrations of the early years of pacing are attenuated by the successful outcome of the work.\"\n\nReferences:\n\n1.

Huxley and Dr. Alan L. Hodgkin, Dr. Eccles came to work at the University at Buffalo. The trio were awarded the prize for \"for their discoveries concerning the ionic mechanisms involved in excitation and inhibition in the peripheral and central portions of the nerve cell membrane.\" A new neurobiology unit was created for Dr. Eccles on the Ridge Lea Campus.\n\nReferences:\n\n1.

His method allowed for earlier detection of PKU using blood instead of urine. In an essay published in Medical History in Buffalo 1846-1996, Dr. Guthrie explained that the filter-paper blood specimen was his \"most important contribution\" since it made it possible to screen one newborn for a variety of different conditions.\n\nReferences:\n\n1.

Carl and Gerty Cori came to Buffalo in 1922 and worked at Roswell Park, which was called the State Institute for the Study of Malignant Disease. Dr. Carl Cori was an assistant professor of physiology at UB from 1927 to 1931. After leaving Buffalo, the Coris were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1947 \"for their discovery of the course of the catalytic conversion of glycogen.\" That year, the prize was shared with another researcher, Bernardo Alberto Houssay.\n\nReferences:\n\n1.

Dr. Rahn and his colleagues at the University of Rochester investigated whether \"operational altitude of [US] Air Force personnel could be increased by breathing oxygen under pressure.\" He continued in this line of inquiry at Buffalo, looking into blood-gas exchange at high and low altitudes. This led to a project studying deep sea divers in Korea and Japan. In his later years, Dr. Rahn focused on gas exchange in avian eggs and its role in embryonic development.\n\nReferences:\n\n1.

His book, Treatise on Human Physiology, was completed in 1859. He was also well known for another title, Topographical Anatomy of the Brain, which was published in 1885.\n\nReferences:\n\n1.

Along with Dr. Isaac Djerassi, Dr. Klein invented a way to separate \"whole blood into its components of plasma, red blood cells, platelets, and white blood cells.\" These components could be used to address specific deficiencies. An added benefit was that it made more effective use of blood donations. In 1972, Dr. Klein was award the Lasker Award for developing \"local antitumor chemotherapy for neoplasitc cutaneous lesions.\" He is credited with pioneering modern immunotherapy and devising the first effective treatment for Kaposi's sarcoma.\n\nReferences:\n\n1.

In 1941, the Department of Bacteriology and Immunology was created and Dr. Witebsky became the head. He served in this role until 1967, when he helmed the newly formed Center for Immunology. Dr. Witebsky's contributions to the field were great. One of these contributions was \"the conditioning of universal donor blood for emergency transfusions.\"\n\nUntil his death in 1969, Drs. Rose, Milgrom, and Beutner worked alongside Dr. Witebsky in the Department of Bacteriology and Immunology (later called Microbiology and Immunology) and the Center for Immunology.\n\n\"The Father of Autoimmunology,\" Dr. Rose led the Center for Immunology from 1969-1973. He came to Buffalo in the early 1950's and started in Dr. Witebsky's lab. Dr. Witebsky asked him to prepare \"an antigen specific to the thyroid,\" called thyroglobulin. The goal was to determine whether an \"organism would generate an immune response when challenged with its own antigens.\" Dr. Rose was able to prove that an immune response was triggered when thyroglobulin was administered in rabbits, and the field of autoimmunology was born.\n\nDr. Milgrom's career at UB spanned nearly forty years (1958-1995) and he was chair of the department from 1967-1985. Before moving to the United States, he \"developed a simple test\" for syphilis \"that could performed on a drop of dried blood.\" He \"described a factor in human serum which was termed anti-antibody\" and conducted research about graft rejection in kidney transplantation.\n\nDr. Beutner worked at UB from 1956 to 1997. His research focused on \"understanding the links between human immune system components and skin disorders.\" He \"helped define and standardize labeled antibody techniques for microscopy leading to improved diagnostic tests.\" He was internationally recognized for his work in immunodermatology.\n\nReferences:\n\n1.
