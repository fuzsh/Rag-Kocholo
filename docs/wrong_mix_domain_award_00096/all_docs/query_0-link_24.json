For demonstrating the chemical processes involved in transmission of nerve impulses, Huxley and Hodgkin were awarded the 1963 Nobel Prize in Medicine, sharing the honors with neurophysiologist John Eccles. Huxley also served as editor of the scientific reviews Journal of Physiology and Journal of Molecular Biology.\n\nHis grandfather, Thomas Henry Huxley, was a noted 19th-century writer and biologist, and his father, Leonard Huxley, wrote a famous biography of the elder Huxley.
