        "text": "Company Introduction\n\nWe are a holding company incorporated in the Cayman Islands. As a holding company with no material operations of its own, we conduct our operations through our operating subsidiaries established in HongÂ Kong, mainland China, and the Netherlands, primarily in the sale, design and manufacturing of interconnect products, including connectors, cables and wire harnesses. We have a diversified global customer base located in more than 25 countries throughout Asia, Europe and the Americas.\n\nInterconnect products are essential components that form physical or logical connections between two electronic devices or networks. We specialize in customized interconnect products, including connectors, cables and wire harnesses that are used for a range of applications in a diversified set of industries, including industrial, automotive, robotics, medical equipment, computer, network and telecommunication, and consumer products.\n\nWe produce both OEM (âoriginal equipment manufacturerâ) and ODM (âoriginal design manufactureâ) interconnect products for manufacturing companies that produce end products, as well as electronic manufacturing services (âEMSâ) companies, who procure and assemble products on behalf of such manufacturing companies. OEM products refer to products we manufacture based on design and specifications provided by customers, while ODM products refer to those products that we design, develop and manufacture based on the specifications provided by customers. Many of our customers are global name-brand manufacturers, such as Linak, Danfoss, Bitzer, Maersk, Universal Robots, Philips, Osram, Flextronics, Harman and Vtech, with whom we have established long-term working relationships.\n\nWe work closely with our customers in developing products and providing solutions that meet their specific requirements for the end applications, and believe that our focus on customersâ needs has contributed to our steady growth in the last two decades. We strive to achieve high customer satisfaction by (1) providing value-added services such as our âdesign for manufacturingâ (âDFMâ) analysis, through which we routinely analyze product design and specifications based on end application requirements to ensure final products achieve optimal results for customers, and (2) providing prompt and effective responses to customer inquiries and requests by utilizing our in-house management information system, which management information system is designed to store, track and analyze data collected from various operational units, including sales, procurement, production, quality control, and engineering. Additionally, in order to better service our growing customer base in Europe, in 2016, we established our Netherlands subsidiary, CCSC Interconnect NL, which has since served as our Europe logistics and service hub.\n\nWe seek to deliver quality products at competitive prices through a vertically integrated production process. CCSC Interconnect DG, our PRC subsidiary, is our manufacturing and product development hub. CCSC Interconnect DG leases a facility in Dongguan, Guangdong Province, where more than 250 employees carry out design and development, engineering, manufacturing and assembly, and quality control of our products. While we strive to achieve efficiency and low costs by standardizing and optimizing certain processes across the production cycle, we understand the importance of maintaining the quality of our products. Our team of more than 20 quality assurance specialists strictly enforce our quality control protocols at every step of the production process.\n\nOur product research and development capabilities has been a cornerstone of our success. Our engineering team that is responsible for product research and development currently has 37 employees, many of whom are experienced mechanical and electrical engineers. We own the rights to 68 patents registered with the intellectual property agency of mainland China and CCSC Interconnect DG has been certified as a High and New-Technology Enterprise (HNTE) (the âHNTEâ) since 2016. In July 2023, CCSC Interconnect DG was selected by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) of China as a âSpecialized Refinement Differential Innovation Little Giant Enterpriseâ, a recognition given to small and medium-sized enterprises that specialize in niche sectors and boast strong innovative capability. We intend to continually invest in our engineering team and further enhance our research and development capabilities.\n\nNote:\n\nCCSC Interconnect NL is to CCSC Technology Groupâs wholly-owned subsidiary, CCSC Interconnect Technology Europe B.V., a private limited liability company organized under the laws of the Netherlands.\n\nCCSC Interconnect DG, or Dongguan CCSC Interconnect Electronic Technology Limited, a company incorporated on June 28, 1993 in Dongguan, China."
