        "text": "Gale Business Insights: Global provides students and researchers with the broad yet detailed coverage of international business they need to develop into savvy professionals that can compete and succeed working across the countries and cultures of the world. Gale Business Insights: Global is the most convenient and comprehensive way to access timely case studies, full-text articles, and robust data sets coupled with authoritative references and tools for analysis. This unique resource empowers users to not only research topics but also to interpret their research. Deep business intelligence powered by statistical data lets researchers spend less time searching and more time connecting their discoveries to practical applications.\n\nThe Labour Studies Index offers over 6534 citations of journal articles, books, book chapters, theses, and other literature relating to Canadian labour issues, as of May 2016, and continuing to grow.\n\nWhile the Index emphasizes open access publications, they also have indexed a number of recent books (including publisher descriptions), journal articles, and reports.\n\nScope of the Index (as of May 2016)\n\nOpen access is a key criterion for what is included in the Index. The following three scholarly journals are indexed comprehensively: Labour/Le Travail (1976-, open access except for the current year), Just Labour. A Canadian Journal of Work and Society (2002-2014, open access), and Relations industrielles/Industrial Relations (1945- , open access since 1964 except for the current two years). Work has been completed on the first two journals, while the latter is still in the process of being indexed. Just Labour, published by York Universityâ€™s Centre for Work and Society, appears to have been indexed previously only by Google Scholar.\n\nAll other publications or resources are indexed selectively with priority given to recency (i.e., since 2000). They include research (e.g., theses, dissertations) in institutional repositories, Canadian university presses (e.g., Athabasca), Canadian publishers (e.g., Fernwood), commercial academic publishers, commissioned reports (e.g., Statistics Canada, Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives), and reviews.\n\nAnalyze important global issues and events through topic overviews, international viewpoints, news, and multimedia content.\n\nNot a pro and con database, Global Issues in Context ties together sources to present a rich analysis of issues - social, political, military, economic, environmental, science related, health related, cultural - and headlines in world hot spots. It provides information seekers with a framework to better understand 21st-century issues and events while highlighting global connections and the interdependence of all nations.\n\nGlobal Issues in Context focuses on broad issues, such as war, genocide, terrorism, human rights, poverty, famine, globalization, world trade, nuclear proliferation, and global warming, as well as more specific events and topics in the news that are related to these broader issues. It also includes detailed information on nations to provide a foundation for cross-cultural studies and, International periodicals and news sources that bring additional insight and currency.\n\nGlobal Issues in Context includes a variety of sources and media formats:\n\nOverviews summarizing background information, historical context, and contemporary stances\n\nExpert perspectives analyzing an issue or event through multiple aspects\n\nReference documents providing background information on all issues and nations\n\nFull-text international magazines, academic journals, and news sources\n\nPrimary sources\n\nStatistics, including interactive graphs, tables, and charts\n\nMultimedia elements\n\nLinks to Web sites, including government sites and organizations\n\nGlobal Issues in Context also features tools such as a curriculum standards search, Lexiles reading scores for periodicals, a translation feature, research tools and guide, a link to Discovery Education's streaming, a vast digital media library, for customers who subscribe to streaming, and more!\n\n(Description provided by the database publisher, Gale/Cengage)\n\nProvides access to archival issues of over 4,500 scholarly journals across most academic disciplines. Includes primary source materials.\n\nThe collections are the following: Arts & Sciences I to XV, Business IV, Hebrew Journals, Ireland, Life Sciences, Lives of Literature, Public Health, Security Studies, Sustainability, Global Plants, Struggles for Freedom in Southern Africa, World Heritage Sites: Africa, and 19th Century British Pamphlets.\n\nJSTOR also now includes over a half-million images from the ArtStor \"public collection\", described as \"images, videos, documents, and audio files from museums, archives, libraries, and faculty collections\". Eventually all 1.3 million images currently accessible on the ArtStor platform will also be on the JSTOR platform.\n\nAuthentication note: If you create your own personal account within the UPEI institutional account, you can access everything UPEI has licensed by logging into that account directly from on or off campus without going through our proxy server. That is good for 365 days and can be easily renewed.\n\nFaculty: If you want an entire class to have their own accounts, you can provide collections@upei.ca with a list of student email addresses, and we can upload them all in a batch - students will get email invites that they need to accept, but it makes the process much easier, if you want to use the collaborative research tools in the \"JSTOR Workspace\".\n\nThis link goes to the public version of the New York Times. Robertson Library does not have a paid license to this site.\n\nThe Library does have full text access to recent NYT issues via the Gale databases (1985 - present, may be delayed by one business day).\n\nThe free Archives search offers 1851-present. Full text may be available on this site from 1851-1922 but access to full articles may be blocked by an account requirement. Library staff can help you place Interlibrary Loan (ILL) requests for any articles you need.\n\nRobertson Library also has the NY Times on microfilm from 1923-1986. Ask library staff for assistance.\n\nThis subscription package to over 35,000 ebooks and 6,000 videos includes primarily computer science, but with many engineering and business books too. It also includes hundreds of interactive tutorials and an AI-like \"answers\" feature for technical questions.\n\nTechnical access issues:\n\nYou will need to use UPEI's login system to use these books even if you are on campus.\n\nThe first time you use it, you will see a popup that mentions sending you an email, but that's doesn't apply to us and you won't get any email.\n\nYou should only have to do this sequence once per computer/web browser.\n\nWe recommend using any browser OTHER THAN Chrome, because Chrome does not render many mathematical equations properly.\n\nIf you copy a URL in this product to make persistent link (for example, to a chapter), you need to use this link conversion tool so that link will work properly later (otherwise it won't).\n\nIf you are ever starting with a link into this product that insists on getting your email address first, use that same link conversion tool (in a browser other than Chrome) and retry with the modified link.\n\nThe \"mobile app\" provided by the platform for offline reading will not work with UPEI's login authentication system. You should however find that the normal web platform is acceptably \"responsive\" to small screens like smartphones.\n\nThis collection of over 450 streaming videos on the SAGE Research Methods platform offers support on the practical skills that you need to successfully complete your research. Key areas such as writing a research proposal, planning and designing a research project, and securing ethical approval are explicitly covered. Practical skills such as project management, writing for publication, presenting work, and building networks are also presented through helpful explanatory videos. This video collection will give you the confidence to successfully navigate your research, take responsibility for your professional development and identify the transferable skills needed to progress your careers.\n\nTopics covered in the videos include:\n\nProject Management\n\nWriting a research proposal\n\nSecuring ethical approval\n\nWriting for publication\n\nComputer applications\n\nApplied research\n\nResearch careers & building networks\n\nPresenting at conferences\n\nBuilding Networks\n\nand many more topics\n\nThere are more research methods videos in the SRM Core package\n\nIntegrates data on over 60,000 topics from over 18,000 sources onto a single professional platform.
