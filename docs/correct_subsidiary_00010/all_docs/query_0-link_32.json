        "text": "Implant\n\nOur brain-computer interface is fully implantable, cosmetically invisible, and designed to let you control a computer or mobile device anywhere you go.\n\nImplant\n\nBiocompatible Enclosure\n\nThe N1 Implant is hermetically sealed in a biocompatible enclosure that withstands physiological conditions several times harsher than those in the human body.\n\nImplant\n\nBattery\n\nThe N1 Implant is powered by a small battery charged wirelessly from the outside via a compact, inductive charger that enables easy use from anywhere.\n\nImplant\n\nChips and Electronics\n\nAdvanced, custom, low-power chips and electronics process neural signals, transmitting them wirelessly to the Neuralink Application, which decodes the data stream into actions and intents.\n\nImplant\n\nThreads\n\nThe N1 Implant records neural activity through 1024 electrodes distributed across 64 threads. These highly-flexible, ultra-thin threads are key to minimize damage during implantation and beyond.\n\nSurgical Robot\n\nThe threads of our implant are so fine that they can't be inserted by the human hand. Our surgical robot has been designed to reliably and efficiently insert these threads exactly where they need to be.\n\nSurgical Robot\n\nBase Structure\n\nThe base structure and motion stage provide the structural platform for the robot head and the primary 3 axis linear motion used to position the robot head and needle."
