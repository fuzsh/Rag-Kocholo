These firmware give to the devices the access by software application through InterLINK protocol on communication channels supported. For further details please visit CommSEC website - www.commsec.it -. CommSEC: InterLINK protocol The protocol consist of operative text messages, ASCII formatted, organized in sets of commad and its parameters. The protocol syntax is very simple and easy to learn and the text format is very useful for the software application to develop. Communication channels Software applications communicate with hardware architecture to manage through InterLINK protocol on the following channels: • Serial Terminal RS-232 or RS-485 or Serial-USB • Ethernet / Internet through TELNET Terminal and through Web-Browser HTTP • Ethernet / Internet TCP/IP protocol Software applications InterLINK protocol is utilized by software applications that implement the automation. These applications could be local, near the installed devices, or remote in whatever place reachble by data connectivity. The application developing is very simple thanks to the string text based protocol: is only necessary sending text string on serial or ethernet channel. Example of common platforms and languages utilizable: LabView, Java, .Net, Python, Javascript, Processing. InterLINK protocol examples of text string: • reading “_RI,0,2,4_ ” • writing “_WH,0,4,3,128,x80,sAB_“ Applications • software Hardware devices • browser Communication channels • Eurogi Eulogic devices with • USB monitor • USB pre-installed InterLINK firmware • Telnet prompt • Ethernet • different firmware licences • Modbus offer different functionalities\n\n2.

Available resources are: Input and Output, Display and push-buttons events, RTC, internal memory, etc.. The device must only be configured with necessary parameters to establish InterLINK connections ( like IP address, logging server, etc.). Software applications can access, through communication channels, at all the device functionalities.
