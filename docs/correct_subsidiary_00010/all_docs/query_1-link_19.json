REVOCABILITY OF PROXIES Any proxy given pursuant to the solicitation may be revoked by the person giving it at any time before its use by delivering to the Secretary of the Company a written notice of revocation or a duly executed proxy or by attending the Annual Meeting and voting in person. 3 VOTING AND SOLICITATION Each stockholder is entitled to one vote for each share of Common Stock held by such stockholder on the Record Date on all matters presented at the Annual Meeting. Stockholders do not have the right to cumulate votes in the election of directors. The required quorum for the transaction of business at the Annual Meeting is a majority of the votes eligible to be cast by holders of shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding on the Record Date. Shares that are voted \"FOR\", \"AGAINST\" or \"WITHHELD FROM\" a matter are treated as being present at the meeting for purposes of establishing a quorum and are also treated as shares entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting (the \"Votes Cast\") with respect to such matter. While there is no definitive statutory or case law authority in Delaware as to the proper treatment of abstentions, the Company believes that abstentions should be counted for purposes of determining both (i) the presence or absence of a quorum for the transaction of business and (ii) the total number of Votes Cast with respect to a proposal (other than the election of directors). In the absence of controlling precedent to the contrary, the Company intends to treat abstentions in this manner. Accordingly, abstentions will have the same effect as a vote against the proposal. Broker non-votes will be counted for purposes of determining the presence or absence of a quorum for the transaction of business, but will not be counted for the purposes of determining the number of Votes Cast with respect to the particular proposal on which the broker has expressly not voted. Accordingly, broker non-votes will not affect the outcome of the voting on a proposal that requires a majority of the Votes Cast (such as the approval of a plan). However, with respect to a proposal that requires a majority of the outstanding shares (such as an amendment to the certificate of incorporation), a broker non-vote has the same effect as a vote against the proposal. The cost of soliciting proxies will be borne by the Company. The Company has retained Boston Equiserve to provide proxy solicitation services in connection with the Annual Meeting at an estimated cost of $1,000. In addition, the Company may reimburse brokerage firms and other persons representing beneficial owners of shares for their expenses in forwarding solicitation material to such beneficial owners. Proxies may also be solicited by certain of the Company's directors, officers and regular employees, without additional compensation, personally or by telephone or telegram. STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS TO BE PRESENTED AT NEXT ANNUAL MEETING Stockholders are entitled to present proposals for action at a forthcoming meeting if they comply with the requirements of the proxy rules promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Company's bylaws. Proposals of stockholders of the Company intended to be presented for consideration at the Company's 1999 Annual Meeting of Stockholders must be received by the Company no later than August 27, 1999 in order that they may be included in the proxy statement and form of proxy related to that meeting. The Company's bylaws further provide that for any business to be properly brought before the Company's 1999 Annual Meeting by a stockholder, the stockholder must also give proper notice to the Company no later than August 27, 1999, in compliance with the notice provisions set forth in such bylaws. 4 PROPOSAL ONE ELECTION OF DIRECTORS NOMINEES A board of five directors is to be elected at the Annual Meeting. Unless otherwise instructed, the proxy holders will vote the proxies received by them for the five nominees named below. In the event that any such nominee is unable or declines to serve as a director at the time of the Annual Meeting, the proxies will be voted for a nominee who shall be designated by the present Board of Directors to fill the vacancy. In the event that additional persons are nominated for election as directors, the proxy holders intend to vote all proxies received by them in such a manner as will assure the election of as many of the nominees listed below as possible, and, in such event, the specific nominees to be voted for will be determined by the proxy holders. The Company is not aware of any nominee who will be unable or will decline to serve as a director. Each director elected at this Annual Meeting will serve as a director until the next Annual Meeting of Stockholders or until a successor has been duly elected and qualified. VOTE REQUIRED The five (5) nominees for director receiving the highest number of affirmative votes of the shares entitled to be voted for them shall be elected as directors. Votes withheld from any director are counted for purposes of determining the presence or absence of a quorum, but have no other legal effect under Delaware law.

The 5% and 10% assumed rates of appreciation are mandated by the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission and do not represent the Company's estimate or projection of future Common Stock prices. The gains shown are net of the option exercise price, but do not include deductions for taxes or other expenses associated with the exercise of the option or the sale of the underlying shares. The actual gains, if any, on the exercise of stock options will depend on the future performance of the Common Stock, the option holder's continued employment through the option period, and the date on which the options are exercised. (2) Options vest as of 9/48th of the option shares after nine months from the vesting commencement date and as to 1/48th of the option shares each month thereafter, with full vesting occurring on the fourth anniversary of the vesting commencement date. 9 (3) Options were granted at an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the Company's Common Stock. Exercise price may be paid in cash, promissory note, by delivery of already-owned shares subject to certain conditions, or pursuant to a cashless exercise procedure under which the optionee provides irrevocable instructions to a brokerage firm to sell the purchased shares and to remit to the Company, out of the sale proceeds, an amount equal to the exercise price plus all applicable withholding taxes. (4) Option was granted under the 1996 Director option plan at an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the Company's Common Stock on the date of grant. Options vest as to 1/48th of the option shares each month, with full vesting occurring on the fourth anniversary of the vesting commencement date. These options expire ten years from the date of grant. (5) Option was granted under an agreement between Mr. Braniff and the Company, whereby Mr. Braniff was to act as Interim Chief Executive Officer until a full-time Chief Executive Officer was hired. Options vest as to 1/12th of the option shares each month, with full vesting occurring on the anniversary of the vesting commencement date. Options are also subject to certain acceleration clauses. (6) Options vest as to 1/84th of the option shares each month with full vesting occurring on the seventh anniversary of the vesting commencement date. According to the terms of these grants, if the average share price in effect on the grant date doubles and the increased price is sustained over a one month period, the options will accelerate their vesting by one year. Thereafter, an additional year of vesting will accelerate for every $5 of incremental value added to the Company's average stock. The stock must retain its increased value over a one month period in order for any acceleration of options to occur. The performance based option grant will carry a two year minimum vesting schedule regardless of acceleration factors.

EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS AND CHANGE IN CONTROL ARRANGEMENTS Mr. Berkeley and Mr. Barth each have entered into letter agreements with the Company which provide for severance payments if they are terminated without cause. Mr. Berkeley will be entitled to severance payments equal to twelve months salary, Mr. Barth will be entitled to severance payments equal to six months salary. All of the Named Executive Officers' employment with the Company is terminable at will. In addition, each of the Named Executive Officers has entered into a change of control severance agreement which provides for acceleration of all unvested stock options and/or restricted stock held by such officer upon an involuntary termination without cause of such officer within twelve (12) months of a change of control transaction. DIRECTOR COMPENSATION Members of the Company's Board of Directors that are employees of the Company do not receive compensation for their services as directors. The Company's 1996 Director Option Plan provides that options will be granted to non-employee directors of the Company pursuant to an automatic nondiscretionary grant mechanism. Upon joining the Board of Directors, each new non-employee director will automatically be granted an option to purchase 15,000 shares of Common Stock and each non-employee director will subsequently be granted an additional option to purchase 3,750 shares of Common Stock annually, each such option to be granted at the fair market value of the Common Stock on the date of grant. The initial option grant of 15,000 shares vests at a rate of 1/48th of the shares per month following the date of grant, and the subsequent option grant of 3,750 shares vests at the end of four years. In addition, the Company reimburses the reasonable travel expenses of the directors. COMPLIANCE WITH SECTION 16(a) OF THE EXCHANGE ACT Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act of 1934 requires the Company's executive officers and directors, and persons who own more than 10% of a registered class of the Company's equity securities, to file reports of initial ownership and changes in ownership with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") and the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. Executive officers, directors and greater than ten percent stockholders are required by SEC regulation to furnish the Company with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file. Based solely on its review of the copies of such forms received by it, or written representations from certain reporting persons, the Company believes that during fiscal 1998 all executive officers and directors of the Company complied with all applicable filing requirements. REPORT OF THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE The following is the Report of the Compensation Committee of the Company describing the compensation policies and rationale applicable to the Company's executive officers with respect to the compensation paid to such executive officers for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1998. The information contained in the report shall not be deemed to be \"soliciting material\" or to be \"filed\" with the Securities and Exchange Commission nor shall such information be incorporated by reference into any future filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, except to the extent that the Company specifically incorporates it by reference into such filing. General. The responsibilities of the Compensation Committee are to administer the Company's various incentive plans, including the Company's 1992 Stock Option Plan and the 1996 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, and to set compensation policies applicable to the Company's executive officers. The Committee's fundamental policy is to offer the Company's executive officers competitive compensation opportunities based upon overall Company performance, their individual contribution to the financial success of the Company and their personal 11 performance. It is the Committee's objective to have a substantial portion of each officer's compensation contingent upon the Company's performance, as well as upon such officer's own level of performance. Accordingly, each executive officer's compensation package comprises three elements: (i) base salary, which is established primarily on the basis of individual performance and market considerations; (ii) annual variable performance awards payable in cash and tied to the Company's achievement of financial performance goals and the executive's contribution; and (iii) long-term stock-based incentive awards, which strengthen the mutuality of interests between the executive officers and the stockholders. Base Salary. Base salary is primarily used by the Company as a device to attract, motivate, reward and retain highly skilled executives. The Committee reviewed and approved fiscal year 1998 base salaries for the Chief Executive Officer and other executive officers at the beginning of the fiscal year or at the date of their appointment. Base salaries were established by the Committee based on an executive officer's job responsibilities, level of experience, individual performance, contribution to the business, the Company's financial performance for the past year and recommendations from management. The Committee also took into account the salaries for similar positions at comparable companies, based on each individual Committee member's industry experience. In reviewing base salaries, the Committee focused significantly on each executive officer's prior performance with the Company and expected contribution to the Company's future success. In making base salary decisions, the Committee exercised its discretion and judgment using these factors. No specific formula was applied to determine the weight of each factor. Annual Incentive Bonuses. Each executive officer's bonus is based on qualitative and quantitative factors. Bonuses are intended to motivate and reward executive officers by directly linking the amount of the bonus to specific Company-based performance targets. Annual incentive bonuses for executive officers are intended to reflect the Committee's belief that a portion of the compensation of each executive officer should be contingent upon the performance of the Company. To carry out this philosophy, the Board reviews and approves the financial budget for the fiscal year. The Committee then establishes target bonuses for each executive officer as a percentage of the officer's base salary. The executive officers, must successfully achieve these performance targets, which are submitted by management to the Committee for its evaluation and approval at the beginning of the fiscal year. Company-based performance goals are tied to different indicators of Company performance, such as the operating results of the Company. The Committee evaluates the completion of the Company-based performance targets and approves a performance rating relative to the goals completed. This scoring is influenced by the Committee's perception of the importance of the various corporate goals. The Committee believes that the bonus arrangement provides an excellent link between the Company's earnings performance and the incentives paid to executives. Stock Options. The Committee provides the Company's executive officers with long-term incentive compensation through grants of stock options under the Company's 1992 Stock Option Plan. The Committee believes that stock options provide the Company's executive officers with the opportunity to purchase and maintain an equity interest in the Company and to share in the appreciation of the value of the Company's Common Stock. The Committee believes that stock options directly motivate an executive to maximize long-term stockholder value. The options also use vesting periods that encourage key executives to continue in their employment with the Company. All options granted to executive officers to date have been granted at the fair market value of the Company's Common Stock on the date of grant. The Committee considers the grant of each option subjectively, considering factors such as the executive officer's relative position and responsibilities with the Company, the individual performance of the executive officer over the previous fiscal year, and the anticipated contribution of the executive officer to the attainment of the Company's long-term strategic performance goals. Stock options granted in prior years are also taken into consideration. The Committee views stock option grants as an important component of its long-term, performance-based compensation philosophy. CEO Salary. The compensation of Mr. Berkeley, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, consisted of base salary, an annual bonus and incentive stock options. The Board of Directors periodically reviews the CEO's base salary and bonus and revises his compensation based on the Board's overall evaluation of his performance toward the achievement of the Company's financial, strategic and other goals, with consideration given to his length of service and to comparative chief executive officer compensation information. The Compensation Committee believes that the Company's success is dependent in part upon the efforts of its Chief Executive Officer. In fiscal 1998, Mr. Berkeley earned a base salary of $276,000 as set by 12 the Compensation Committee and earned a bonus of $70,629 which was based on performance objectives. Mr. Berkeley also received an option to purchase 367,300 shares of Common Stock of the Company (with an exercise price of 100% of market value of the Common Stock on the date of grant). Option Repricing Report. In February 1998, all employees who held outstanding options under the Company's stock options plans, including all executive officers, were given the opportunity to reprice outstanding stock options to the then current market price of $4.88 per share in return for changing the vesting start date of the option to a point six months after the original start date. The Company took this action to retain key employees at a time of intense competition for experienced personnel. There were no separate analyses of the impact of the repricing on the overall compensation of the executive officers or any other employees. The following table provides the specified information concerning all repricings of options to purchase the Company's Common stock held by any executive officer of the Company since August 15, 1996, the date of the Company's initial public offering: TEN-YEAR OPTION REPRICINGS <TABLE> <CAPTION> Number of Length of Original Securities Market Price Option Term Underlying of Stock at Exercise Price Remaining at Date Options Time of at Time of New of Repricing or Repriced or Repricing or Repricing or Exercise Amendment Name and Position Date Amended Amendment Amendment Price (months) ----------------- ---- -------- --------- ---------- ----- -------- <S> <C> <C> <C> <C> <C> <C> Augustus J.

As of June 30, 1998, 627,131 options were exercised under the 1992 Plan, options to purchase 1,509,883 shares were outstanding under the 1992 Plan, with exercise prices ranging from $.70 to $16.25, a weighted average exercise price of $4.19, and expiration dates ranging from January 28, 2000 to June 24, 2005, and 170 persons were eligible to participate in the 1992 Plan. The Board of Directors now seeks shareholder approval of the amendment to the Company's 1992 Plan to increase the number of shares of the Company's Common Stock available for issuance thereunder by 150,000 shares from a total of 2,405,000 shares to a total of 2,555,000 shares. An increase in the number of shares reserved for issuance under the 1992 Plan is needed to enable the Company to continue to grant options to employees in accordance with its existing compensation policies. Management of the Company believes that the ability to grant options to employees is essential to the Company's ability to attract and retain highly qualified employees. A summary of the principal provisions of the 1992 Plan is set forth below: 1992 Stock Option Plan. The Company's 1992 Stock Option Plan (as amended, the \"1992 Plan\") was adopted by the Board of Directors in June 1992, approved by the Company's stockholders in July 1992 and amended in June 1996. In June 1996 and July 1996, the Board of Directors and the stockholders approved an increase in the number of shares of Common Stock reserved under the 1992 Plan by 1,000,000 shares to 2,105,000 shares. In October 1997 and February 1998, the Board of Directors and the stockholders approved an increase in the number of shares of Common Stock reserved under the 1992 plan by 300,000 shares to 2,405,000 shares. The 1992 Plan provides for grants of incentive stock options, restricted stock and stock purchase rights to employees (including officers and employee directors) and consultants of the Company. The purpose of the 1992 Plan is to attract and retain the best available personnel to the Company and to encourage stock ownership by employees, officers, and consultants of the Company to give them a greater personal stake in the success of the Company. The 1992 Plan is presently being administered by the Board of Directors, which determines optionees and the terms of options granted, including exercise price, number of shares subject to the option and the exercisability thereof. The terms of options granted under the Plan generally may not exceed ten years. However, the term of all incentive stock options and nonstatutory stock options granted to an optionee who, at the time of grant, owns stock representing more than 10% of the Company's outstanding capital stock, may not exceed five years. The vesting of all stock option grants is determined by the Board of Directors. Generally options granted under the 1992 Plan vest and become exercisable starting nine months after the date of grant, with 9/48th of the shares subject to the option becoming exercisable at that time and an additional 1/48th of such shares subject to the option becoming exercisable each month thereafter. No option may be transferred by the optionee other than by will or the laws of descent or distribution, and each option may be exercised, during the lifetime of the optionee, only by such optionee. An optionee whose relationship with the Company or any related corporation ceases for any reason (other than by death or permanent and total disability) may exercise options in the 30-day period following such cessation (unless such options terminate or expire sooner by their terms) or in such longer period as is determined by the Board of Directors. In the event of a merger of the Company with or into another corporation, all outstanding options may either be assumed or an equivalent option may be substituted by the surviving entity or, if such options are not assumed or substituted, such options shall terminate as of the date of the closing of the merger. The exercise price of incentive stock options granted under the 1992 Plan must be at least equal to the fair market value of the shares on the date of grant. The exercise price of nonstatutory stock options granted under the 1992 Plan is determined by the administrator. With respect to any participant who owns stock possessing more than 10% of the voting rights of the Company's outstanding capital stock, the exercise price of the any incentive stock option or any nonstatutory stock option granted must equal at least 15 110% of the fair market value on the grant date. The consideration for exercising any incentive stock option or any nonstatutory stock option may consist of cash, check, promissory note, delivery of already-owned shares of the Company's Common Stock subject to certain conditions, delivery of a properly executed exercise notice together with irrevocable instructions to a broker to promptly deliver to the Company the amount of sale or loan proceeds required to pay the exercise price, a reduction in the amount of any Company liability to an optionee, or any combination of the foregoing methods of payments or such other consideration or method of payment to the extent permitted under applicable law. No incentive stock options may be granted to a participant, which, when aggregated with all other incentive stock options granted to such participant, would have an aggregate fair market value in excess of $100,000 becoming exercisable in any calendar year. The affirmative vote of a majority of the Votes Cast will be required to approve this proposal. The Company's Board of Directors has approved this proposal. THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS A VOTE \"FOR\" THE AMENDMENT OF THE 1992 STOCK OPTION PLAN PROPOSAL THREE AMENDMENT TO THE 1996 EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN The Company's stockholders are being asked to approve an amendment to the Company's 1996 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the \"Purchase Plan\") which will increase the number of shares authorized to be issued thereunder from 350,000 to 600,000. As of June 30, 1998, 198,213 shares have been issued under this plan. The Board of Directors now seeks shareholder approval of the amendment to the Purchase Plan to increase the number of shares of the Company's Common Stock available for issuance thereunder by 250,000 shares from a total of 350,000 shares to a total of 600,000 shares. An increase in the number of shares reserved for issuance under the Purchase Plan is needed to enable the Company to continue to issue shares to participating employees in accordance with its existing compensation policies. Management of the Company believes that the ability to offer this plan is essential to the Company's ability to attract and retain highly qualified employees. A summary of the principal provisions of the Purchase Plan is set forth below: 1996 Employee Stock Purchase Plan. The Company's Purchase Plan was adopted by the Board of Directors in June 1996 and approved by the stockholders in July 1996. A total of 350,000 shares of Common Stock has been reserved for issuance under the Purchase Plan. The Purchase Plan, which is intended to qualify under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, is administered by the Board of Directors or by a committee appointed by the Board. Employees (including officers and employee directors of the Company) are eligible to participate if they are customarily employed for at least 20 hours per week and for more than five months in any calendar year. The Purchase Plan is implemented by a series of overlapping offering periods, each consisting of approximately twenty-four months duration. Each offering period contains four six month purchase periods, the initial offering period under the Purchase Plan began on the effective date of the Company's initial public offering and subsequent offering periods begin on the first trading day on or after November 1 and May 1 of each year. 16 The Purchase Plan permits eligible employees to purchase Common Stock through payroll deductions, which may not exceed 15% of an employee's compensation; provided, however, that in no event will any employee have eligible compensation in excess of $50,000 in any one purchase period. Each participant is granted an option on the first day of the offering period and such option is automatically exercised on the last date of each purchase period. If the fair market value of the Common Stock on any purchase date is lower than the fair market value on the start date of the offering period, then all participants in that offering period will be automatically withdrawn from such offering period and reenrolled in the immediately following offering period. The purchase price of the Common Stock under the Purchase Plan will be equal to 85% of the lesser of the fair market value per share of Common Stock on the start date of the offering period or on the date on which the option is exercised. Employees may end their participation in the Purchase Plan at any time, and participation ends automatically on termination of employment with the Company. In any event, the Purchase Plan will terminate in June 2006, unless sooner terminated by the Board of Directors. The affirmative vote of a majority of the Votes Cast will be required to approve this proposal. The Company's Board of Directors has approved this proposal. THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS A VOTE \"FOR\" THE AMENDMENT OF THE 1996 EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN PROPOSAL FOUR RATIFICATION OF APPOINTMENT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS The Board of Directors has selected PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, independent accountants, to audit the financial statements of the Company for the current fiscal year ending June 30, 1999.
