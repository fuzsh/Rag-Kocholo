        "text": "The Company will also showcase other cutting-edge advancements in electrochemical gas sensing\n\nIRVINE, Calif., June 18, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Interlink Electronics, Inc. (NASDAQ: LINK), a world-leading provider of sensors and printed electronic solutions that support a wide range of applications, including Human-Machine Interface (\"HMI\"), environmental sensing, and Internet-of-Things (\"IoT\") devices, is thrilled to introduce a significant addition to its broad portfolio of electrochemical gas sensors and systems. These new sensors, specifically designed for use in Outdoor Air Quality (OAQ) monitoring solutions, are particularly crucial for accurate reporting of air quality as impacted by wildfires. The families of sensors being launched include devices for Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2), Carbon Monoxide (CO), Sulphur Dioxide (SO2), and Ozone (O3).\n\nThese sensors will be on display at Booth 1153 at the Sensors Converge Conference in Santa Clara, CA, on June 25 and 26. This prestigious event brings together industry leaders, innovators, and experts from the sensor technology domain, offering a unique platform for networking, knowledge sharing, and exploring the latest advancements in this dynamic field.\n\n\"Our team has significantly innovated on our technology platforms to deliver compelling sensor solutions that are tuned for OAQ monitoring. These highly selective sensors feature the right sensitivity and response time levels that make them ideal for outdoor use,\" said Dr. Sreeni Rao, General Manager of Interlink's Gas and Environmental Sensors Division. \"This solution is unique because we have identified the four most critical gases needed for OAQ monitoring as impacted by wildfires. Because of the inherent advantages of Interlink's electrochemical sensors, including ultra-low power operation, very small size, and easy deployability, these sensors are ideally suited for OAQ applications.\"\n\n\"Developing these sensors was a crucial step in our mission to mitigate the enormous and increasing human and economic impact of wildfires,\" added Steven N. Bronson, CEO and President of Interlink. \"Undertaken as part of an SBIR R&D award from the US NOAA agency that Interlink received only eight months ago, these sensors are a testament to our commitment to environmental safety. Interlink's sensors will play a pivotal role in collecting real-time air quality data, both for early warning and for wildfire prevention.\"\n\nAbout Interlink Electronics, Inc.\n\nInterlink Electronics is a world-leading provider of sensors and printed electronic solutions that support a wide range of applications, including Human-Machine Interface (\"HMI\") devices and Internet-of-Things (\"IoT\") solutions, utilizing our expertise in materials science, manufacturing, firmware, and software to produce in-house system solutions for custom specifications.
