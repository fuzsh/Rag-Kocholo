Welcome to the largest online encyclopedia on African American and Global African history on the Internet.\n\nMore description from an online review:\n\nBlackpast is a free website with thousands of encyclopedia articles on African American and Global African history spanning 1526 to the present, as well as transcripts of speeches and primary documents, articles, bibliographies, and guides. Topics are chosen for their “clearly evident impact on African America, the United States, or the world.”\n\nBlackpast started as an online reference center by University of Washington (UW) faculty in 2004. The project expanded beyond UW, and the Blackpast.org website went live on February 1, 2007. Their Academic Advisory Board is made up of fifteen noted scholars in US, African, and African American history from around the US and Canada. Contributors are unpaid independent and academic historian volunteers from around the world; each has a profile so users can see their background and relationship to the topic.\n\nThe online encyclopedia’s entries average around 500 words and provide introductions to individuals and events with significant impact on Black history. Every entry also lists its sources. There are transcripts of more than 300 speeches, 63 from global figures and events, and 243 from African American history. The “Perspectives Articles” by academic historians describe lesser-known yet important events or offer viewpoints about historical developments shaping the contemporary Black world.\n\nThe content can be navigated to by using the basic search bar located at the top of every webpage, or one could browse topics under African American history, Global African history, or by the main and special features. At the bottom of the page, users can browse African American and Global African history by categories: “People,” “Places,” “Groups & Organizations,” “Events,” “Primary Documents,” “Institutions,” “Speeches,” and “Perspectives.”\n\nThe transcripts of American and international primary documents and the fun, visual timeline potentially could be of particular use for research and classrooms.\n\nBlackwell Synergy -- See Wiley Online Wiley Online is a multidisciplinary collection of online resources covering life, health and physical sciences, social science, and the humanities.

If you input Queen Victoria then 976 results are returned. Documents which contain both words will occur only once in the results set, but will be more highly ranked within that set because both words have been found.\n\nIf you search for queen AND victoria, the system will look for documents which contain both of those words (please note that the AND must be in upper case for this to work), and in this example finds 76 results. If you input the search term \"queen victoria\" within double quotes the search will look for that exact string of characters (again the case is not significant) and will find only 71 results.\n\nIn the last example, the use of the - (minus) sign instructs the system firstly to find all documents containing the word queen, but then to exclude from the results any of those it has found which also contain the word victoria.\n\nERIC (EBSCOhost) Provides access to education literature and resources.
