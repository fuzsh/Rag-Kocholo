        "text": "Steven Zolman\n\nSteven Zolman\n\nMy Money is on YOU, and I am ALL IN!\n\nPublished Feb 23, 2022\n\nBREAKING: The Mainframe is not dead. While smaller companies continue to get off the mainframe, it’s still too soon to write an obituary, as mid-sized businesses grew mainframe consumption from 5 to 15% and large enterprises grew from 15 to 20% in 2021. Recent analyst reports suggest that as much as half of the world’s information is still processed on the mainframe. The mainframe was a $2.3 Billion Industry in 2021, is expected to increase another 8% in 2022, and is projected to grow at a 3.2% CAGR from 2021-2029.\n\nMajor hardware, software, and services companies that stand to benefit from this decade of mainframe market growth include Atos, BMC, CA, Cognizant, Dell, DXC, Fujitsu, HCL, Hitachi, Infosys, Kyndryl, IBM, Unisys, Wipro, and others. See related articles:\n\nTop 10 India-Based IT Services Companies for 2022\n\nTime to Defuse Your Kyndryl Deal BEFORE it Detonates\n\nSix Major Industries Still Use Mainframes Extensively:\n\nBanking\n\nRetail\n\nInsurance\n\nHealthcare\n\nGovernment\n\nTravel and Transportation\n\nMainframes continue to play a pivotal role in client data processing needs in these six major industries but also remain prevalent in the Utilities and Telecom industries as well as any industry that needs high security and/or is transaction-intensive.\n\nMainframe Resilience in face of Onslaught. Despite record levels of digital transformation initiatives, workload migrations to the cloud, and enterprise modernization efforts, the mainframe market remains enormous, and mainframe dependency in the top industries remains intact with impressive market share and dominance. Cloud providers such as AWS, Azure, and Google all have mainframe migration programs, and customers continue to make headway with digital transformation efforts designed to migrate workloads to the cloud. As a result, while IBM is certainly suffering from a diminishing role in the modern enterprise, mainframes are still gainfully employed at:\n\nAll 10 of the world’s largest insurers\n\n92 of the world’s top 100 banks\n\n90% of all credit card transactions are processed on mainframes\n\n18 of the top 25 retailers\n\n70% of the Fortune 500\n\n68% of the world’s production IT workloads\n\nIBM z-Series Mainframes (“z” stands for zero-downtime) are currently on version z15, which is based on the z15 chip and was introduced on September 12, 2019. IBM has previously advised that the z16 will come out in ‘early 2022’ based on the Power10 chips with fat cores (meaning 8 threads per core and 15 cores per chip) which became generally available in September 2021. With recent supply chain issues, the exact release date remains unclear. However, if you need to process billions of ultra-secure business-critical transactions, the mainframe is likely still a vital part of your business landscape and you will almost assuredly be interested in looking at upgrading to IBM's z16 when it becomes generally available.\n\nIBM’s latest mainframe (the z15) packs up to 190 configurable cores (up from 170 in the previous generation), can be upgraded to 40TB of memory (that’s 40,000 GB for those of you who are scoring at home), and can survive a massive earthquake without missing a beat. Capable of handling up to 1 trillion secure web transactions per day on a single system, its processing power is equivalent to running 2.4 million containers. Those touting the death of the mainframe will find this easier said than done on a rack of commodity servers. Although plenty of customers are trying as they seek to avoid huge legacy costs and onerous licensing terms, as well as retiring old hardware, and migrating to hybrid cloud environments where they can rely on lower cost and plentiful resources versus a critical shortage of expensive COBOL experts.\n\nMainframes are Budget Hogs. For our clients in those 6 major industries with mainframes, they know how all-consuming these monoliths can be with an average of 56% of IT budgets being consumed by mainframes, the systems that support them, the software that runs on them, and the people who program and operate them. The median mainframe programmer salary is $76,282 according to PayScale, which is $11,806 higher than the median salary for computer programmers in general.\n\nWhen it comes to software, most people can only name a small handful of suppliers and do not realize that there are 576 Independent Software Vendors (ISVs) that have developed software for the mainframe:\n\n324 of them still have software that runs in active mainframe environments\n\n252 of them have either gone out of business or have since been acquired\n\nMarch is a big time of the year for ISVs in the Mainframe space, as suppliers such as CA, BMC, and Compuware all have fiscal-year ends in March. This creates some added market activity around this time of the year where many of those renewals come due, which has also created a big month for replacement opportunities for the likes of IBM and others who seek to continue to capture market share by taking it from their competitors.\n\nExecutive Summary\n\nThe combination of a proprietary operating environment and no real system alternatives leads to monopolistic pricing control, and the predatory pricing behavior of the mainframe oligarchs generally results in an untenable, extremely expensive, and unsustainable situation for those customers who seemingly have no way out. However, we can help you escape from the tyranny of your mainframe cost albatross, and it is easier than you think, so take the first step and contact us today!\n\nMainframe Costs are Exorbitant Compared to Cloud. Mainframes cost as much as 4,500% more to operate than equivalent Cloud solutions. This figure is compounded by a scarcity of development resources and rising licensing and maintenance fees for ancillary mainframe utilities, applications, and databases.\n\nGetting Off the Mainframe. Most clients do not realize that migrating mainframe batch workloads requires no refactoring. Clients can “lift and shift” COBOL batch processing workloads (along with the JCL) and move them to (for example) an EC2 instance on AWS. This process is easy and can be done with low risk. Clients can also migrate OLTP environments (such as CICS) to the cloud, and while they can scale those instances vertically, they can also direct the user interface to an elastic load balancer with multiple EC2 instances to offer a performance-centric solution that minimizes the risk of any processing bottlenecks. Depending on the nature of transaction volumes and peak loads, clients not only see significant cost savings, but they can also see improved performance and throughput. This methodology also enables clients to easily eliminate those additional instances when not needed during off-peak processing times, saving them huge money in the process. In addition to COBOL and CICS, relational databases such as DB2 also port nicely to RDS - and even hierarchical databases such as IMS/DB can be normalized (with some minor code changes). Even the security protocols of RACF have simple migrations to tools as commonplace as Active Directory.\n\nThird-Party Products. The best way to save money on CA, BMC, ASG, and others is to get off their products. Comparable products such as job schedulers run in the cloud in the same way they run on a mainframe, but for a tiny fraction of the cost.\n\nStaying on the Mainframe. Most clients who chose to stay on the mainframe can work to reduce their MIPS footprint to achieve significant savings. Carefully evaluate third-party contracts in this case, which generally do not allow for MIPS reductions during the terms of these agreements, so clients will often plan these moves strategically to coincide with contract expirations.\n\nMIPS Usage. In conjunction with a cloud migration strategy, where applications and workloads are moved to the cloud, the resulting processing capacity reductions will generally reduce your costs, but not linearly, as certain volume incentives may be lost in the process. Still, it is very much worth the exercise to find out how much you can save.\n\nHow Much Can You Save? We have seen clients with exotic use cases save 80-90% in mainframe operating expense, but 50-60% savings achievement is more common with a standard technology stack. Bottom line, significant savings can be achieved by migrating workloads and applications off your mainframe and onto lower-cost platforms.
