        "text": "Getting Started in Telecommunications\n\nBY JERRY MCBRIDE\n\nFollow Jerry McBride as be unveils the mysteries of the modem and illuminates the simplicity of telecommunications.\n\nOf all the equipment related to home computers, none are so cloaked in mystery as are modems. Born during a dark time in computer history, when terms like \"user friendly\" hadn't even been dreamt of, modems have often been considered peripherals better left to hackers and computer scientists.\n\nAll that has changed - sort of. Modem use is now enjoyed by millions of computer owners and things have certainly gotten easier for the typical user. But because of subtle differences in the way computers communicate over the phone, the home-modem user must deal with a number of special terms and control settings that can often be confusing.\n\nWith a little help, however, you'll find that modems are not hard to use. The following article will guide you through the cryptic world of telecommunications, covering such oblique subjects as baud rates, Hayes-compatibility, uploading and downloading. Along the way you'll also find out how to choose the modem and modem software that's right for you.\n\nWhat is a Modem and What is It Good For?\n\nA modem (modulator/demodulator) is a hardware interface that lets a computer communicate with other computers through telephone lines. This means that you can send and receive all sorts of information -including text, programs and pictures -right at your home computer.\n\nModems let you retrieve anything from stocks and securities to news reports and information on ST hardware/software. There are even complete magazines that only exist \"online.\" (Editor's Note: START Magazine accepts submissions via modem. See the end of \"Dialog Box\" for information on how and where to send it.)\n\nBut that's not all! You can also interact with the world around you. For example, you can make travel reservations, pay many of your bills or buy discounted goods from cameras to automobiles. Professional online services (called bulletin board services or BBSs) provide these kinds of services.\n\nThere are also many local BBSs run by computer hobbyists. Local BBSs are operated by people like you and me and do not charge an hourly fee, though some have a one-time or yearly membership fee (ranging from $5 to about $25). You won't find stock quotes or the other exotic capabilities of a professional service but you will find text-based games and many public domain/shareware programs. There are even programs, like MichTron's BBS 3.0, that let you set up your own BBS.\n\nVirtually all BBSs, professional or hobby, provide a service called electronic mail, which lets you exchange messages with the other people on that BBS. You can even correspond with software developers and ST hardware manufacturers. This is a great way to get news, ask questions or receive program-related items (like printer drivers, etc.).\n\nWhich Modem Should You Buy?\n\nWhen modems were first introduced for widespread use, the Hayes Corporation and U.S. Robotics battled for control of the fledgling market. Naturally, each companies' modems were incompatible (each required a different program to run it.)\n\nHayes eventually won out and today their modems are the defacto standard in the computer industry. Hayes' success (and high prices) soon inspired other companies to make Hayes-compatible modems; units that are identical to the Hayes but at a much lower cost.\n\nModems for the ST fit into the Hayes mold and all telecommunications programs for the ST are written for Hayes-compatible modems. Therefore, when you buy a modem, make sure that it's 100-percent \"Hayes-compatible.\"\n\nSpeed (baud rate) is the next consideration. Modems with baud rates of 300, 1200 and 2400 are most common. Three hundred-baud modems are very slow and are not recommended for serious use. Twelve hundred-baud modems offer serviceable speed at an affordable price (around $90). If you plan to become a modem maniac you should get a 2400-baud modem (for around $170). Most modems let you select any of the slower speeds in case you call a BBS that operates at a slower baud rate.\n\nA brief word concerning 9600-baud modems: steer clear of them. They're still in their formative stages and no single standard has emerged. The incompatibilities with these modems are far more serious than with existing modems. All breeds of 300-, 1200- and 2400-baud modems can talk to one another (as long as you set the faster modem to the slower modem's speed). Different breeds of 9600-baud modems cannot talk to one another at all. This is because each type of 9600-baud modem uses a completely different transmission scheme.\n\nHayes Microcomputer\n\nProducts, Inc.\n\nP.O. Box 105203\n\nAtlanta, GA 30348 (404) 449-8791\n\nSmartmodem 1200, $399. RS232C Serial Interface, CCITT, 1200 baud, External.\n\nSmartmodem 2400, $499. RS232C Serial Interface, CCITT, 2400 baud, External.\n\nSmartmodem 9600, Si ,999. RS232C Serial Interface, CCITT, 9600 baud, External.\n\nFinally, buy a modem that has a built-in speaker. This is for two reasons: first, the speaker lets you hear if the number you're calling is busy. Otherwise you would have to wait 20 or 30 seconds for the modem to say \"call incomplete\" or something equally uninformative. Second, you can tell if you've dialed a wrong number. A speaker lets you hear the person on the other end saying \"Hello? Hello?\" Without the speaker you might try that number five or 10 times, thoroughly terrorizing the answering party.\n\nSoftware, Hardware, Setup\n\nWhich software should you buy? In the May 1989 issue, START ran a comparison of telecommunications programs for the ST. A sidebar following this article offers a brief description and recommendation of the major players in the telecommunications-software field: Flash, Shadow, Interlink ST and ST Talk Professional.\n\nIn addition to software, you'll need to buy an RS-232 cable to connect your ST to the modem. When you buy the modem ask the dealer for a cable to go with it. RS-232 cables generally cost around $25. Do not buy a \"null modem\" cable. This is a special cable specifically designed to connect two computers in order to transfer information directly from one to the other. It attaches through the RS-232 port but a modem is not necessary.\n\nNow that you've bought a modem, software and a cable, what next? First, connect the modem to your ST using the modem cable (pay attention to the sex of the connector ends; one end is male, the other female). Next, connect a phone line to the proper jack in the back of the modem. Modems have a second jack that you can run to a normal telephone. This lets you use your phone and the modem off the same wall jack.\n\nTouchbase\n\n160 Laurel Ave.\n\nNorthport, NY 11768\n\n(516) 261-0423\n\nWorldPort 1200, $199. Fully Hayes compatible, RS-232C Serial Interface, CCITT, 1200 baud, External (Portable).\n\nWorldPort 2400, $359. Fully Hayes compatible, RS-232C Serial Interface, CCITT, 2400 baud, External (Portable).\n\nWorldPort 2400/MNP, $499. Fully Hayes compatible, RS232C Serial Interface, CCITT, 2400 baud, External (Portable), MNP Level 5.\n\nAll modems have a series of small \"DIP\" switches on the back. Although these switches are usually preset at the factory, read the manual to double-check their proper settings. If the modem has a \"VOICE/ DATA\" button, set it to DATA. Set the modem to the desired speed (300-baud modems only have one speed).\n\nNow, boot your ST and run your telecommunications program. From now on the modem will be invisible to you, since you'll be dealing exclusively with the telecomm program (which in turn tells the modem what to do).\n\nIf you accidentally leave your modem on it will always answer the phone and send out a hideous screeching noise. This is rather annoying to anyone who tries to call you. The horrible noise is normal -the modem is trying to make contact with the \"calling computer,\" which in this case may be your Aunt Martha.\n\nAlso, if you have call waiting, disable it before you use your modem - an incoming call could cause the BBS to drop you. Ask your phone company for the code that disables call waiting. Note that disabling your call waiting is not a one-time prcedure. You must shut it off each time you're ready to log on.\n\nUnderstanding Telecommunications Programs\n\nTelecommunications programs have two main operating modes. In effect, these modes determine whether you're controlling your computer or the BBS.\n\nCapture-buffer mode controls the ST and is usually equipped with easy-to-use drop-down menus. Here you can change modem-related settings, edit the automatic-dial directory or edit text that is in the capture buffer. You cannot communicate with another computer while in this mode.\n\nTerminal mode lets you communicate with the outside world. Once you log on, any text you enter is sent right to the BBS. A handy feature in terminal mode is the status bar, an information read-out at the bottom of the screen that tells you what baud rate is selected, how full the capture buffer is and other key pieces of information.\n\nIn telecomm programs, such as Flash, you can switch between the capture buffer and the terminal mode by a simple right-click of the mouse button. If you're logged onto a BBS, you can switch to the capture buffer mode if you want. All communications will be suspended temporarily, but the BBS will wait patiently for your return.\n\nTransferring Files (Uploading and Downloading)\n\nTelecommunications software allows several methods for moving information from modem to modem. These varying methods are known as transfer protocols. and each one has a special function. All transfer protocols (except the ASCII protocol) check for errors in the transmitted data. To spot errors the ST and BBS \"compare notes\" each time a predetermined amount of data (a \"block\") has been sent. If a block contains an error, the protocol tells the BBS to send that block again.\n\nSome common transfer protocols include:\n\nXmodem (CHK or CRC): checks transmitted data accuracy every 128 bytes and is probably the most commonly used transfer protocol. Xmodem is a good choice if your phone lines are noisy (i.e., there's lots of static or other intereference). Sometimes a BBS makes you choose between \"Xmodem CHK\" and \"Xmodem CRC.\" Always choose \"Xmodem CRC\" because it's faster.\n\n(If you're uploading or download-ing data from CompuServe, \"CompuServe B\" protocol is recommended over Xmodem.)\n\nXmodem 1K: also known as Ymodem, it's the same as Xmodem except that it checks for errors in 1K blocks. It's a little faster than Xmodem, but only if your phone lines aren't noisy.\n\nYmodem Batch: completely different from Ymodem, lets you download (or upload) a whole group of files automatically.\n\nAtari Corporation\n\n1196 Borregas Ave.\n\nSunnyvale, CA 94086\n\n(408) 745-2000\n\nSX212, $99.95. Fully Hayes compatible, 1200 baud, External, Capacity for 8-bit port.\n\nCompuserve B Protocol: super fast and more reliable than other protocols in that CompuServe does all the work for you. It even tells your ST to start the data transfer.\n\nASCII: can be used when transferring straight text. It does not check for transmission errors and is therefore faster than other protocols. The ASCII protocol relies on the fact that text can incur an occasional error and still be usable.\n\nOn a side note: at the end of a transmission, a BBS will usually display a message such as \"Xmodem Transfer Completed, 1 Error(s).\" When you see this message don't be alarmed. It's simply telling you that Xmodem caught an error and had that portion transmitted again. Transfer protocols make it virtually impossible to receive bad data during a download.\n\nEverex\n\n48431 Milmont Dr.\n\nFreemont, CA 94538\n\n(415) 498-1111\n\nEvercom 24E, $249. Fully Hayes compatible, RS-232 Serial Interface, 2400 baud, External.\n\nEvercom 24E+, $299. Fully Hayes compatible, RS-232 Serial Interface, 2400 baud, External, MNP 5.\n\nEverFax 24/96E, $499. Fully Hayes compatible, RS-232 Serial Interface, 2400 baud, External, MNP 5, 9600bps Fax Modem.\n\nCompany Calls\n\nPeople in management or research positions often want to call their company mainframe from home. Many of these computers require your ST have off-beat \"terminal emulation modes\" (see the glossary sidebar). If you fit into this category make sure the telecommunications program you buy has the proper terminal emulation mode.\n\nConclusion\n\nAlone, the ST is a powerful machine. With a modem, it's even more powerful. Considering the thousands of wonderful things you can do online. a modem is more than worth the investment."
