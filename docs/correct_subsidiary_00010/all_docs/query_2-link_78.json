        "text": "Hardware replacements and software tools for digital control computers\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nWalker, R.A.P.; Wang, B-C.; Fung, J.\n\n1996-01-01\n\nTechnological obsolescence is an on-going challenge for all computer use. By design, and to some extent good fortune, AECL has had a good track record with respect to the march of obsolescence in CANDU digital control computer technology. Recognizing obsolescence as a fact of life, AECL has undertaken a program of supporting the digital control technology of existing CANDU plants. Other AECL groups are developing complete replacement systems for the digital control computers, and more advanced systems for the digital control computers of the future CANDU reactors. This paper presents the results of the efforts of AECL's DCC service support group to replace obsolete digital control computer and related components and to provide friendlier software technology related to the maintenance and use of digital control computers in CANDU. These efforts are expected to extend the current lifespan of existing digital control computers through their mandated life. This group applied two simple rules; the product, whether new or replacement should have a generic basis, and the products should be applicable to both existing CANDU plants and to 'repeat' plant designs built using current design guidelines. While some exceptions do apply, the rules have been met. The generic requirement dictates that the product should not be dependent on any brand technology, and should back-fit to and interface with any such technology which remains in the control design. The application requirement dictates that the product should have universal use and be user friendly to the greatest extent possible. Furthermore, both requirements were designed to anticipate user involvement, modifications and alternate user defined applications. The replacements for hardware components such as paper tape reader/punch, moving arm disk, contact scanner and Ramtek are discussed. The development of these hardware replacements coincide with the development of a gateway system for selected CANDU digital control\n\nComputationally efficient methods for digital control\n\nNARCIS (Netherlands)\n\nGuerreiro Tome Antunes, D.J.; Hespanha, J.P.; Silvestre, C.J.; Kataria, N.; Brewer, F.\n\n2008-01-01\n\nThe problem of designing a digital controller is considered with the novelty of explicitly taking into account the computation cost of the controller implementation.

Through various examples it is shown that these\n\nDigital computer control of a research nuclear reactor\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nCrawford, Kevan\n\n1986-01-01\n\nCurrently, the use of digital computers in energy producing systems has been limited to data acquisition functions. These computers have greatly reduced human involvement in the moment to moment decision process and the crisis decision process, thereby improving the safety of the dynamic energy producing systems. However, in addition to data acquisition, control of energy producing systems also includes data comparison, decision making, and control actions. The majority of the later functions are accomplished through the use of analog computers in a distributed configuration. The lack of cooperation and hence, inefficiency in distributed control, and the extent of human interaction in critical phases of control have provided the incentive to improve the later three functions of energy systems control. Properly applied, centralized control by digital computers can increase efficiency by making the system react as a single unit and by implementing efficient power changes to match demand. Additionally, safety will be improved by further limiting human involvement to action only in the case of a failure of the centralized control system. This paper presents a hardware and software design for the centralized control of a research nuclear reactor by a digital computer. Current nuclear reactor control philosophies which include redundancy, inherent safety in failure, and conservative yet operational scram initiation were used as the bases of the design. The control philosophies were applied to the power monitoring system, the fuel temperature monitoring system, the area radiation monitoring system, and the overall system interaction. Unlike the single function analog computers that are currently used to control research and commercial reactors, this system will be driven by a multifunction digital computer. Specifically, the system will perform control rod movements to conform with operator requests, automatically log the required physical parameters during reactor\n\nCentralized digital computer control of a research nuclear reactor\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nCrawford, K.C.\n\n1987-01-01\n\nA hardware and software design for the centralized control of a research nuclear reactor by a digital computer are presented, as well as an investigation of automatic-feedback control. Current reactor-control philosophies including redundancy, inherent safety in failure, and conservative-yet-operational scram initiation were used as the bases of the design. The control philosophies were applied to the power-monitoring system, the fuel-temperature monitoring system, the area-radiation monitoring system, and the overall system interaction. Unlike the single-function analog computers currently used to control research and commercial reactors, this system will be driven by a multifunction digital computer. Specifically, the system will perform control-rod movements to conform with operator requests, automatically log the required physical parameters during reactor operation, perform the required system tests, and monitor facility safety and security. Reactor power control is based on signals received from ion chambers located near the reactor core. Absorber-rod movements are made to control the rate of power increase or decrease during power changes and to control the power level during steady-state operation. Additionally, the system incorporates a rudimentary level of artificial intelligence\n\nCANDU Digital Control Computer upgrade options\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nDe Jong, M.S.; De Grosbois, J.; Qian, T.\n\n1997-01-01\n\nThis paper reviews the evolution of Digital Control Computers (DCC) in CANDU power plants to the present day. Much of this evolution has been to meeting changing control or display requirements as well as the replacement of obsolete, or old and less reliable technology with better equipment that is now available. The current work at AECL and Canadian utilities to investigate DCC upgrade options, alternatives, and strategies are examined. The dependence of a particular upgrade strategy on the overall plant refurbishment plans are also discussed. Presently, the upgrade options range from replacement of individual obsolete system components, to replacement of the entire DCC hardware without changing the software, to complete replacement of the DCCs with a functionally equivalent system using new control computer equipment and software. Key issues, constraints and objectives associated with these DCC upgrade options are highlighted. (author)\n\nLow cost highly available digital control computer\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nSilvers, M.W.\n\n1986-01-01\n\nWhen designing digital controllers for critical plant control it is important to provide several features. Among these are reliability, availability, maintainability, environmental protection, and low cost. An examination of several applications has lead to a design that can be produced for approximately $20,000 (1000 control points). This design is compatible with modern concepts in distributed and hierarchical control. The canonical controller element is a dual-redundant self-checking computer that communicates with a cross-strapped, electrically isolated input/output system. The input/output subsystem comprises multiple intelligent input/output cards. These cards accept commands from the primary processor which are validated, executed, and acknowledged. Each card may be hot replaced to facilitate sparing. The implementation of the dual-redundant computer architecture is discussed. Called the FS-86, this computer can be used for a variety of applications. It has most recently found application in the upgrade of San Francisco's Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) train control currently in progress and has been proposed for feedwater control in a boiling water reactor\n\nDigital control computer upgrade at the Cernavoda NPP simulator\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nIonescu, T.\n\n2006-01-01\n\nThe Plant Process Computer equips some Nuclear Power Plants, like CANDU-600, with Centralized Control performed by an assembly of two computers known as Digital Control Computers (DCC) and working in parallel for safely driving of the plan at steady state and during normal maneuvers but also during abnormal transients when the plant is automatically steered to a safe state. The Centralized Control means both hardware and software with obligatory presence in the frame of the Full Scope Simulator and subject to changing its configuration with specific requirements during the plant and simulator life and covered by this subsection\n\nTest and control computer user's guide for a digital beam former test system\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nAlexovich, Robert E.; Mallasch, Paul G.\n\n1992-01-01\n\nA Digital Beam Former Test System was developed to determine the effects of noise, interferers and distortions, and digital implementations of beam forming as applied to the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite 2 (TDRS 2) architectures. The investigation of digital beam forming with application to TDRS 2 architectures, as described in TDRS 2 advanced concept design studies, was conducted by the NASA/Lewis Research Center for NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center. A Test and Control Computer (TCC) was used as the main controlling element of the digital Beam Former Test System. The Test and Control Computer User's Guide for a Digital Beam Former Test System provides an organized description of the Digital Beam Former Test System commands. It is written for users who wish to conduct tests of the Digital Beam forming Test processor using the TCC. The document describes the function, use, and syntax of the TCC commands available to the user while summarizing and demonstrating the use of the commands wtihin DOS batch files.\n\nAdvanced digital computers, controls, and automation technologies for power plants: Proceedings\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nBhatt, S.C.\n\n1992-08-01\n\nThis document is a compilation of the papers that were presented at an EPRI workshop on Advances in Computers, Controls, and Automation Technologies for Power Plants. The workshop, sponsored by EPRI's Nuclear Power Division, took place February 1992. It was attended by 157 representatives from electric utilities, equipment manufacturers, engineering consulting organizations, universities, national laboratories, government agencies and international utilities. More than 40% of the attendees were from utilities representing the majority group. There were 30% attendees from equipment manufacturers and the engineering consulting organizations. The participants from government agencies, universities, and national laboratories were about 10% each. The workshop included a keynote address, 35 technical papers, and vendor's equipment demonstrations. The technical papers described the state-of-the-art in the areas of recent utility digital upgrades such as digital feedwater controllers, steam generator level controllers, integrated plant computer systems, computer aided diagnostics, automated testing and surveillance and other applications. A group of technical papers presented the ongoing B ampersand W PWR integrated plant control system prototype developments with the triple redundant advanced digital control system. Several international papers from France, Japan and U.K. presented their programs on advance power plant design and applications. Significant advances in the control and automation technologies such as adaptive controls, self-tuning methods, neural networks and expert systems were presented by developers, universities, and national laboratories.

The design philosophy adopted was to specify the system dynamics in terms of a desired system transfer function, and realizing the design synthesis through state-variable feedback technique, thus ensuring both stability and optimization in the state space sense. The control design was also tested by carrying out digital simulation transient response runs (step, ramp, impulse, etc.) and agreement between the predicted desirable response and actual response of the overall design was achieved. Furthermore the performance of the controller is verified against a reference non-linear model for purposes of assessing the accuracy of the linearized approximation model. The results show that state-variable feedback policy can rank as an effective optimal technique for designing control algorithm for an on-line computer of a nuclear power plant. 41 figs. 43 refs\n\nPrecision digital control systems\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nVyskub, V.

A classification of such systems is considered along with aspects of stabilization, programmable control applications, digital tracking systems and servomechanisms, and precision systems for the control of a scanning laser beam. Other topics explored are related to systems of proportional control, linear devices and methods for increasing precision, approaches for further decreasing the response time in the case of high-speed operation, possibilities for the implementation of a logical control law, and methods for the study of precision digital control systems. A description is presented of precision automatic control systems which make use of electronic computers, taking into account the existing possibilities for an employment of computers in automatic control systems, approaches and studies required for including a computer in such control systems, and an analysis of the structure of automatic control systems with computers.

The authors evaluated a prototype digital camera system (GE STARCAM) in which all of the analog acquisition components are replaced by microprocessor controls and digital circuitry. To compare the relative effects of acquisition matrix size on image quality and to ascertain whether digital techniques could be used in place of analog imaging, Tc-99m bone scans were obtained on this digital system and on a comparable analog camera in 10 patients. The dedicated computer is used for camera setup including definition of the energy window, spatial energy correction, and spatial distortion correction. The display monitor, which is used for patient positioning and image analysis, is 512/sup 2/ non-interlaced, allowing high resolution imaging. Data acquisition and processing can be performed simultaneously. Thus, the development of a fully integrated digital camera-computer system with optimized display should allow routine utilization of non-analog studies in nuclear medicine and the ultimate establishment of fully digital nuclear imaging laboratories\n\nDigital design and computer architecture\n\nCERN Document Server\n\nHarris, David\n\n2010-01-01\n\nDigital Design and Computer Architecture is designed for courses that combine digital logic design with computer organization/architecture or that teach these subjects as a two-course sequence.

Digital system upset is a functional error mode that can occur in electromagnetically harsh environments, involves no component damage, can occur simultaneously in all channels of a redundant control computer, and is software dependent. A strategy is presented for dynamic upset detection to be used in the evaluation of critical digital controllers during the design and/or validation phases of development. Critical controllers must be able to be used in adverse environments that result from disturbances caused by an electromagnetic source such as lightning, high intensity radiated field (HIRF), and nuclear electromagnetic pulses (NEMP). The upset detection strategy presented provides dynamic monitoring of a given control computer for degraded functional integrity that can result from redundancy management errors and control command calculation error that could occur in an electromagnetically harsh operating environment. The use is discussed of Kalman filtering, data fusion, and decision theory in monitoring a given digital controller for control calculation errors, redundancy management errors, and control effectiveness.\n\nAn introduction to digital computing\n\nCERN Document Server\n\nGeorge, F H\n\n2014-01-01\n\nAn Introduction to Digital Computing provides information pertinent to the fundamental aspects of digital computing.

These computer control capabilities have been applied to a commercially available servomanipulator, the TeleOperator Systems SM-229. All of the servo drive and control circuitry has been replaced with commercially available digital controls and amplifiers, and a customer software - package has been developed at ORNL. This conversion to digital computer control resulted in significant improvements in force-reflection characteristics, ease of operation, diagnostic capabilities, indexing features, and potential increased reliability.

Instead, this paper will describe the architectural evolution of SLAC's computer based accelerator control systems with respect to the distribution of their intelligence. However, the use of the word centralized in the title is appropriate because these systems are based on the use of centralized large and computationally powerful processors that are typically supported by networks of smaller distributed processors\n\nProceedings: Distributed digital systems, plant process computers, and networks\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\n1995-03-01\n\nThese are the proceedings of a workshop on Distributed Digital Systems, Plant Process Computers, and Networks held in Charlotte, North Carolina on August 16--18, 1994. The purpose of the workshop was to provide a forum for technology transfer, technical information exchange, and education. The workshop was attended by more than 100 representatives of electric utilities, equipment manufacturers, engineering service organizations, and government agencies. The workshop consisted of three days of presentations, exhibitions, a panel discussion and attendee interactions. Original plant process computers at the nuclear power plants are becoming obsolete resulting in increasing difficulties in their effectiveness to support plant operations and maintenance. Some utilities have already replaced their plant process computers by more powerful modern computers while many other utilities intend to replace their aging plant process computers in the future. Information on recent and planned implementations are presented. Choosing an appropriate communications and computing network architecture facilitates integrating new systems and provides functional modularity for both hardware and software. Control room improvements such as CRT-based distributed monitoring and control, as well as digital decision and diagnostic aids, can improve plant operations. Commercially available digital products connected to the plant communications system are now readily available to provide distributed processing where needed. Plant operations, maintenance activities, and engineering analyses can be supported in a cost-effective manner.

The reactor achieved its first criticality in 1971. An analog control system has been used for almost over 20 years and the power regulating function is found gradually out of order. Therefore, we decided to develop a digital control system to replace the existing analog one. A prototype system has been developed and under on-line test now. The proposed ZPRL digital control system consists of three personal computers. These computers are used as (1) operator console, (2) data acquisition and control system, and (3) auxiliary and backup system. The operator console contains all the man-machine interface functions in the form of graphic display. The data acquisition and control system converts the analog signals into digital ones and feeds to the other two computers. The auxiliary and backup system normally emulates a strip chart recorder for the linear and logarithmic neutron powers and also acts as a transient recorder to keep the trace of the operating conditions on demand or when the reactor scrams. On-line test shows that the system does assure a satisfactory performance. It is not only as good as the analog system but also has the advantages of flexibility, testibility, and a user friendly man-machine interface.

The program can be targeted toward exploiting the time domain because other programs in the Center are pursuing research on parallel optical systems, exploiting optical interconnection and optical devices and materials. Using a general purpose computing architecture as the focus, we are developing design techniques, tools and architecture for operation at the speed of light limit. Experimental work is being done with the somewhat low speed components currently available but with architectures which will scale up in speed as faster devices are developed. The design algorithms and tools developed for a general purpose, stored program computer are being applied to other systems such as optimally controlled optical communication networks.\n\nElectronic digital computers their use in science and engineering\n\nCERN Document Server\n\nAlt, Franz L\n\n1958-01-01\n\nElectronic Digital Computers: Their Use in Science and Engineering describes the principles underlying computer design and operation.

In recent years there has been a trend towards the use of manipulators for tasks requiring increasing precision of tip positioning. In order to meet this requirement, a digital controller has been designed to replace the analogue controller board used in almost all manipulator control systems. The new controller allows the programming of a wide range of closed loop control algorithms.

It provides practical and powerful tools to model, simulate, analyze, design, measure, and control complex and dynamic systems such as robots and aircrafts. Gene networks are also complex dynamic systems which can be studied via digital signal processing and control. Unlike conventional computational methods, this approach is capable of not only modeling but also controlling gene networks since the experimental environment is mostly digital today. The overall aim of this article is to introduce digital signal processing and control as a useful tool for the study of gene networks.\n\nDistributed and recoverable digital control system\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nStange, Kent (Inventor); Hess, Richard (Inventor); Kelley, Gerald B (Inventor); Rogers, Randy (Inventor)\n\n2010-01-01\n\nA real-time multi-tasking digital control system with rapid recovery capability is disclosed.

The advent of the digital computer introduced a powerfully new element that promises to transform the relation between them. This paper outlines the thesis that the effect of the digital computer on mathematics, already widespread, is likely to be radical and far-reaching. To articulate this claim, an abstract model of doing mathematics is introduced based on a triad of actors of which one, the 'agent', corresponds to the function performed by the computer. The model is used to frame two sorts of transformation. The first is pragmatic and involves the alterations and progressive colonization of the content and methods of enquiry of various mathematical fields brought about by digital methods. The second is conceptual and concerns a fundamental antagonism between the infinity enshrined in classical mathematics and physics (continuity, real numbers, asymptotic definitions) and the inherently real and material limit of processes associated with digital computation. An example which lies in the intersection of classical mathematics and computer science, the P=NP problem, is analysed in the light of this latter issue.\n\nScintillation camera-computer systems: General principles of quality control\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nGanatra, R.D.\n\n1992-01-01\n\nScintillation camera-computer systems are designed to allow the collection, digital analysis and display of the image data from a scintillation camera. The components of the computer in such a system are essentially the same as those of a computer used in any other application, i.e. a central processing unit (CPU), memory and magnetic storage. Additional hardware items necessary for nuclear medicine applications are an analogue-to-digital converter (ADC), which converts the analogue signals from the camera to digital numbers, and an image display. It is possible that the transfer of data from camera to computer degrades the information to some extent. The computer can generate the image for display, but it also provides the capability of manipulating the primary data to improve the display of the image. The first function of conversion from analogue to digital mode is not within the control of the operator, but the second type of manipulation is in the control of the operator. These type of manipulations should be done carefully without sacrificing the integrity of the incoming information\n\nComputer based plant display and digital control system of Wolsong NPP Tritium Removal Facility\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nJung, C.; Smith, B.; Tosello, G.; Grosbois, J. de; Ahn, J.\n\n2007-01-01\n\nThe Wolsong Tritium Removal Facility (WTRF) is an AECL-designed, first-of-a-kind facility that removes tritium from the heavy water that is used in systems of the CANDUM reactors in operation at the Wolsong Nuclear Power Plant in South Korea. The Plant Display and Control System (PDCS) provides digital plant monitoring and control for the WTRF and offers the advantages of state-of-the-art digital control system technologies for operations and maintenance. The overall features of the PDCS will be described and some of the specific approaches taken on the project to save construction time and costs, to reduce in-service life-cycle costs and to improve quality will be presented. The PDCS consists of two separate computer sub-systems: the Digital Control System (DCS) and the Plant Display System (PDS). The PDS provides the computer-based Human Machine Interface (HMI) for operators, and permits efficient supervisory or device level monitoring and control. A System Maintenance Console (SMC) is included in the PDS for the purpose of software and hardware configuration and on-line maintenance. A Historical Data System (HDS) is also included in the PDS as a data-server that continuously captures and logs process data and events for long-term storage and on-demand selective retrieval. The PDCS of WTRF has been designed and implemented based on an off-the-self PDS/DCS product combination, the Delta-V System from Emerson. The design includes fully redundant Ethernet network communications, controllers, power supplies and redundancy on selected I/O modules. The DCS provides field bus communications to interface with 3rd party controllers supplied on specialized skids, and supports HART communication with field transmitters. The DCS control logic was configured using a modular and graphical approach. The control strategies are primarily device control modules implemented as autonomous control loops, and implemented using IEC 61131-3 Function Block Diagram (FBD) and Structured\n\nA computer control system for a research reactor\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nCrawford, K.C.; Sandquist, G.M.\n\n1987-01-01\n\nMost reactor applications until now, have not required computer control of core output. Commercial reactors are generally operated at a constant power output to provide baseline power. However, if commercial reactor cores are to become load following over a wide range, then centralized digital computer control is required to make the entire facility respond as a single unit to continual changes in power demand. Navy and research reactors are much smaller and simpler and are operated at constant power levels as required, without concern for the number of operators required to operate the facility. For navy reactors, centralized digital computer control may provide space savings and reduced personnel requirements. Computer control offers research reactors versatility to efficiently change a system to develop new ideas. The operation of any reactor facility would be enhanced by a controller that does not panic and is continually monitoring all facility parameters. Eventually very sophisticated computer control systems may be developed which will sense operational problems, diagnose the problem, and depending on the severity of the problem, immediately activate safety systems or consult with operators before taking action\n\nOrganization of the in-core control system connection with the M-6000 computer\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nGolovanov, M.N.; Duma, V.R.; Levin, G.L.; Filatov, V.P.\n\n1978-01-01\n\nProblems of organizing communication of a digital computer with the equipment of the in-core control system (CC) are discussed. Three possible modes of joint operation of the CC equipment and the digital computer are given. The off-line control device provides data collection, preliminary processing and recording servicing of peripheral requests, and data exchange with the digital computer; computer-controlled operation of the equipment makes it possible to control input-output operations of the CCS equipment, and also to retain the working capacity of the CCS system when the off-line control device is failed; during file exchange the data are transferred between the computer and the CCS equipment. Requirements for the communication unit design are drawn up. An analysis of existing methods of a digital computer interface with the equipment is presented, and substantiation of the proposed variant of connection of the communication unit directly to the branch highway is given. Operation of the CCS equipment under various conditions is considered. The flowsheet and description of the interface of the M-6000 computer with the CCS equipment are given\n\nA monitor for the laboratory evaluation of control integrity in digital control systems operating in harsh electromagnetic environments\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nBelcastro, Celeste M.; Fischl, Robert; Kam, Moshe\n\n1992-01-01\n\nThis paper presents a strategy for dynamically monitoring digital controllers in the laboratory for susceptibility to electromagnetic disturbances that compromise control integrity. The integrity of digital control systems operating in harsh electromagnetic environments can be compromised by upsets caused by induced transient electrical signals. Digital system upset is a functional error mode that involves no component damage, can occur simultaneously in all channels of a redundant control computer, and is software dependent. The motivation for this work is the need to develop tools and techniques that can be used in the laboratory to validate and/or certify critical aircraft controllers operating in electromagnetically adverse environments that result from lightning, high-intensity radiated fields (HIRF), and nuclear electromagnetic pulses (NEMP). The detection strategy presented in this paper provides dynamic monitoring of a given control computer for degraded functional integrity resulting from redundancy management errors, control calculation errors, and control correctness/effectiveness errors. In particular, this paper discusses the use of Kalman filtering, data fusion, and statistical decision theory in monitoring a given digital controller for control calculation errors.\n\nDirect digital temperature control of the A-1 nuclear reactor\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nKarpeta, C.\n\n1975-01-01\n\nThe application is described of one of the modern control methods for designing an experimental digital temperature control system for heavy water moderated gas cooled reactors.

Two kinds of reactivity computers, analog and digital, have been widely used in the pressurized water reactor (PWR) core physics test. The test data of both reactivity computers are displayed only on the strip chart recorder, and these data are managed by hand so that the accuracy of the test results depends on operator expertise and experiences. This paper describes the development of the computer-aided digital reactivity computer system (DRCS), which is enhanced by system management software and an improved system for the application of the PWR core physics test\n\nDigital control for the Penn State Breazeale reactor\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nRaiskums, G.A.\n\n1991-01-01\n\nDigital control has been an integral part of Canada deuterium uranium (CANDU) nuclear power reactor technology since the 1960s. Much of the high CANDU production reliability can be attributed to the fault-tolerant and flexible control algorithms achievable with digital control. Atomic Energy of Canada Limited (AECL) has now transported this technology to research reactors, using industrial-grade microcomputers to solve equipment aging and spares obsolescence problems so prevalent at older installations. The open architecture of the Intel 8086-based computers provides for wide availability and reasonably priced, quality hardware from numerous sources. AECL recently supplied the Pennsylvania State University Breazeale Reactor (PSBR) with a new console containing a digital control and monitoring system. The reactor safety system (RSS) was also replaced with hardwired relay logic and truly analog state-of-the-art wide range nuclear instrumentation supplied by AECL's subcontractor, Gamma-Metrics. Retaining analog hardware for the mandated RSS functions was key to minimizing licensing efforts and the extensive verification and validation that would be required for safety system software. This paper elaborates on the digital control and monitoring portion of the PSBR console replacement, with emphasis on the key system objectives\n\nDigitized adiabatic quantum computing with a superconducting circuit.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nBarends, R; Shabani, A; Lamata, L; Kelly, J; Mezzacapo, A; Las Heras, U; Babbush, R; Fowler, A G; Campbell, B; Chen, Yu; Chen, Z; Chiaro, B; Dunsworth, A; Jeffrey, E; Lucero, E; Megrant, A; Mutus, J Y; Neeley, M; Neill, C; O'Malley, P J J; Quintana, C; Roushan, P; Sank, D; Vainsencher, A; Wenner, J; White, T C; Solano, E; Neven, H; Martinis, John M\n\n2016-06-09\n\nQuantum mechanics can help to solve complex problems in physics and chemistry, provided they can be programmed in a physical device. In adiabatic quantum computing, a system is slowly evolved from the ground state of a simple initial Hamiltonian to a final Hamiltonian that encodes a computational problem. The appeal of this approach lies in the combination of simplicity and generality; in principle, any problem can be encoded. In practice, applications are restricted by limited connectivity, available interactions and noise. A complementary approach is digital quantum computing, which enables the construction of arbitrary interactions and is compatible with error correction, but uses quantum circuit algorithms that are problem-specific. Here we combine the advantages of both approaches by implementing digitized adiabatic quantum computing in a superconducting system. We tomographically probe the system during the digitized evolution and explore the scaling of errors with system size. We then let the full system find the solution to random instances of the one-dimensional Ising problem as well as problem Hamiltonians that involve more complex interactions. This digital quantum simulation of the adiabatic algorithm consists of up to nine qubits and up to 1,000 quantum logic gates. The demonstration of digitized adiabatic quantum computing in the solid state opens a path to synthesizing long-range correlations and solving complex computational problems. When combined with fault-tolerance, our approach becomes a general-purpose algorithm that is scalable.\n\nCloud computing and digital media fundamentals, techniques, and applications\n\nCERN Document Server\n\nLi, Kuan-Ching; Shih, Timothy K\n\n2014-01-01\n\nCloud Computing and Digital Media: Fundamentals, Techniques, and Applications presents the fundamentals of cloud and media infrastructure, novel technologies that integrate digital media with cloud computing, and real-world applications that exemplify the potential of cloud computing for next-generation digital media.

The proposed design exhibits improved performance, at low operating powers, a,s compared to existing controller types. The continuous-time controller design is performed systematically via the Linear Quadratic Gaussian/Loop Transfer Recovery method, followed by gain adaptation allowing controller operation in the entire power range. Digital implementation of the controller is accomplished by a digital redesign which results in matching the digital and continuous-time system and controller states. It is only at this stage of the control system design process that issues such as microprocessor induced quantization effects are taken into account. The use of computer-aided-design software greatly expedites the design cycle, allowing the designer to maximize the controller stability robustness to uncertainties via numerous iterations. This inherent controller robustness can be exploited to tolerate incipient plant faults, such as deteriorating U-tube heat transfer properties, without significant loss of controller performance\n\nScenario-Based Digital Forensics Challenges in Cloud Computing\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nErik Miranda Lopez\n\n2016-10-01\n\nFull Text Available The aim of digital forensics is to extract information to answer the 5Ws (Why, When, Where, What, and Who from the data extracted from the evidence. In order to achieve this, most digital forensic processes assume absolute control of digital evidence. However, in a cloud environment forensic investigation, this is not always possible. Additionally, the unique characteristics of cloud computing create new technical, legal and architectural challenges when conducting a forensic investigation. We propose a hypothetical scenario to uncover and explain the challenges forensic practitioners face during cloud investigations. Additionally, we also provide solutions to address the challenges. Our hypothetical case scenario has shown that, in the long run, better live forensic tools, development of new methods tailored for cloud investigations and new procedures and standards are indeed needed. Furthermore, we have come to the conclusion that forensic investigations biggest challenge is not technical but legal.\n\nREVIEW OF NRC APPROVED DIGITAL CONTROL SYSTEMS ANALYSIS\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nMarkman, D.W.\n\n1999-01-01\n\nPreliminary design concepts for the proposed Subsurface Repository at Yucca Mountain indicate extensive reliance on modern, computer-based, digital control technologies. The purpose of this analysis is to investigate the degree to which the U. S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) has accepted and approved the use of digital control technology for safety-related applications within the nuclear power industry. This analysis reviews cases of existing digitally-based control systems that have been approved by the NRC. These cases can serve as precedence for using similar types of digitally-based control technologies within the Subsurface Repository. While it is anticipated that the Yucca Mountain Project (YMP) will not contain control systems as complex as those required for a nuclear power plant, the review of these existing NRC approved applications will provide the YMP with valuable insight into the NRCs review process and design expectations for safety-related digital control systems. According to the YMP Compliance Program Guidance, portions of various NUREGS, Regulatory Guidelines, and nuclear IEEE standards the nuclear power plant safety related concept would be applied to some of the designs on a case-by-case basis. This analysis will consider key design methods, capabilities, successes, and important limitations or problems of selected control systems that have been approved for use in the Nuclear Power industry. An additional purpose of this analysis is to provide background information in support of further development of design criteria for the YMP. The scope and primary objectives of this analysis are to: (1) Identify and research the extent and precedence of digital control and remotely operated systems approved by the NRC for the nuclear power industry. Help provide a basis for using and relying on digital technologies for nuclear related safety critical applications. (2) Identify the basic control architecture and methods of key digital control\n\nDevelopment of new process network for gas chromatograph and analyzers connected with SCADA system and Digital Control Computers at Cernavoda NPP Unit 1\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nDeneanu, Cornel; Popa Nemoiu, Dragos; Nica, Dana; Bucur, Cosmin\n\n2007-01-01\n\nThe continuous monitoring of gas mixture concentrations (deuterium/ hydrogen/oxygen/nitrogen) accumulated in 'Moderator Cover Gas', 'Liquid Control Zone' and 'Heat Transport D 2 O Storage Tank Cover Gas', as well as the continuous monitoring of Heavy Water into Light Water concentration in 'Boilers Steam', 'Boilers Blown Down', 'Moderator heat exchangers', and 'Recirculated Water System', sensing any leaks of Cernavoda NPP U1 led to requirement of developing a new process network for gas chromatograph and analyzers connected to the SCADA system and Digital Control Computers of Cernavoda NPP Unit 1. In 2005 it was designed and implemented the process network for gas chromatograph which connected the gas chromatograph equipment to the SCADA system and Digital Control Computers of the Cernavoda NPP Unit 1. Later this process network for gas chromatograph has been extended to connect the AE13 and AE14 Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) analyzers with either. The Gas Chromatograph equipment measures with best accuracy the mixture gases (deuterium/ hydrogen/oxygen/nitrogen) concentration. The Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) AE13 and AE14 Analyzers measure the Heavy Water into Light Water concentration in Boilers Steam, Boilers BlownDown, Moderator heat exchangers, and Recirculated Water System, monitoring and signaling any leaks. The Gas Chromatograph equipment and Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) AE13 and AE14 Analyzers use the new OPC (Object Link Embedded for Process Control) technologies available in ABB's VistaNet network for interoperability with automation equipment. This new process network has interconnected the ABB chromatograph and Fourier Transform Infrared analyzers with plant Digital Control Computers using new technology.

The dual ''safety computers'' monitor coolant temperature and flow in each of the 600 fuel assemblies in the reactor. The system provides alarms and automatic reactor shutdown (SCRAM) if these variables exceed predetermined setpoints.

It was found that approximately 20% of the cable connector assemblies inspected showed signs of degradation. These findings raised the concern of an increased risk of random short-circuit faults at the very heart of the station control system. Given the excellent reliability of the Gentilly 2 DCCs and their inherent design robustness, it was decided to proceed with the replacement of all of the complete cable connector assemblies within a reasonable time frame. It is planned to replace all assemblies of DCCX and DCCY during the 1991 annual outage. The degradation of the insulation was traced to a material incompatibility problem originating during cable manufacture. A migration of the plastifier contained in the PVC of the transparent sheaths, surrounding many of the cable conductors to terminal block connections, resulted in the chemical attack of the conductor insulation. This paper summarizes the problem identification and disposition process followed by Gentilly 2 Technical Unit personnel\n\nIntegrated Computer Controlled Glow Discharge Tube\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nKaiser, Erik; Post-Zwicker, Andrew\n\n2002-11-01\n\nAn \"Interactive Plasma Display\" was created for the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory to demonstrate the characteristics of plasma to various science education outreach programs. From high school students and teachers, to undergraduate students and visitors to the lab, the plasma device will be a key component in advancing the public's basic knowledge of plasma physics. The device is fully computer controlled using LabVIEW, a touchscreen Graphical User Interface [GUI], and a GPIB interface. Utilizing a feedback loop, the display is fully autonomous in controlling pressure, as well as in monitoring the safety aspects of the apparatus. With a digital convectron gauge continuously monitoring pressure, the computer interface analyzes the input signals, while making changes to a digital flow controller. This function works independently of the GUI, allowing the user to simply input and receive a desired pressure; quickly, easily, and intuitively. The discharge tube is a 36\" x 4\"id glass cylinder with 3\" side port. A 3000 volt, 10mA power supply, is used to breakdown the plasma. A 300 turn solenoid was created to demonstrate the magnetic pinching of a plasma. All primary functions of the device are controlled through the GUI digital controllers. This configuration allows for operators to safely control the pressure (100mTorr-1Torr), magnetic field (0-90Gauss, 7amps, 10volts), and finally, the voltage applied across the electrodes (0-3000v, 10mA).\n\nLow cost SCR lamp driver indicates contents of digital computer registers\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nCliff, R.

This architecture is compared to currently developing VHSIC systems. Using demonstrated multichannel acousto-optic devices, a figure of merit can be formulated. The focus is on a figure of merit termed Gate Interconnect Bandwidth Product (GIBP). Conventional parallel optical digital computer architecture demonstrates only marginal competitiveness at best when compared to projected semiconductor implements. Global, analog global, quasi-digital, and full digital interconnects are briefly examined as alternative to parallel digital computer architecture. Digital optical computing is becoming a very tough competitor to semiconductor technology since it can support a very high degree of three dimensional interconnect density and high degrees of Fan-In without capacitive loading effects at very low power consumption levels.\n\nDigital remote control system for power supplies of particle channel magnetooptical elements\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nVetrov, P.B.; Ermolina, G.P.; Kuznetsov, V.S.; Mojbenko, A.N.\n\n1986-01-01\n\nCurrent control of magnetooptical elements of accelerator particle channels is based on control of reference voltage of current stabilizers.

A digital control system of 30 spatially remoted power supplies of magnetooptical elements of particle channels on the basis of the ''Elektronika-60'' microcomputer is described. The microcomputer is connected by the standard communication line (20 mA) with the SM-4 computer. The ''Summa'' crate is connected with the microcomputer through the branch driver.

This program includes measurements of the geometric accuracy, optical density performance, signal to noise ratio, and presampled modulation transfer function. The variability of the measurements was less than plus or minus 5%. Measurements were made on a group of two clinical and two laboratory laser film digitizers during a trial period of approximately four months. Quality control limits were established based on clinical necessity, vendor specifications and digitizer performance. During the trial period, one of the digitizers failed the performance requirements and was corrected by calibration.\n\nControl of horizontal plasma position by feedforward-feedback system with digital computer in JIPP T-II tokamak\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nToi, K.; Sakurai, K.; Itoh, S.; Matsuura, K.; Tanahashi, S.\n\n1980-01-01\n\nIn the resistive shell tokamak, JIPP T-II, the control of horizontal plasma position is successfully carried out by calculating the equilibrium equation in a thin resistive shell from a large-aspect-ratio approximation every 1.39 msec with a digital computer. The iron core effect also is taken account by a simple form in the equation. The required strength of vertical field is determined by the control-demand composed of a ''feedback'' term with Proportion-Integration-Differentiation correction (PID-controller) and ''feedforward'' one in proportion to plasma current. The experimental results have a satisfactory agreement with the analysis of control system. By this control system, the horizontal displacement has been suppressed within 1 cm throughout a discharge for the plasma of 15 cm-radius with high density and low q(a)-value obtained by the second current rise and strong gas puffing.

The digital plasma control system (PCS) has been in place at DIII-D since the early 1990s and continues to expand and improve in its capabilities to monitor and control plasma parameters for DIII-D fusion science experiments. The PCs monitors over 200 tokamak parameters from the DIII-D experiment using a real-time data acquisition system that acquires a new set of samples once every 60 micros. This information is then used in a number of feedback control algorithms to compute and control a variety of parameters including those affecting plasma shape and position. A number of system related improvements has improved the usability and flexibility of the DIII-D PCS. These include more graphical user interfaces to assist in entering and viewing the large and ever growing number of parameters controlled by the PCS, increased interaction and accessibility from other DIII-D applications, and upgrades to the computer hardware and vended software. Future plans for the system include possible upgrades of the real-time computers, further links to other DIII-D diagnostic measurements such as real-time Thomson scattering analysis, and joint collaborations with other tokamak experiments including the NSTX at Princeton\n\nDigital control card based on digital signal processor\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nHou Shigang; Yin Zhiguo; Xia Le\n\n2008-01-01\n\nA digital control card based on digital signal processor was developed. Two Freescale DSP-56303 processors were utilized to achieve 3 channels proportional- integral-differential regulations. The card offers high flexibility for 100 MeV cyclotron RF system development.

We illustrate the intertwined history of these ideas, starting with the early theoretical work of John von Neumann and the pioneering experimental work of Nils Aall Barricelli. We argue that evolutionary thinking and artificial life will continue to play an integral role in the future development of the digital ...\n\nDigitally Controlled Point of Load Converter with Very Fast Transient Response\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nJakobsen, Lars TÃ¸nnes; Andersen, Michael Andreas E.\n\n2007-01-01\n\nvoltage mode control and very fast transient response.

Even a trip of a single nuclear power plant (NPP) causes an extravagant economical loss and deteriorates public acceptance of nuclear power plants. Therefore, the replacement of the instrument and control devices with proper consideration of the aging effect is necessary in order to prevent the inadvertent trip. In this paper we investigated the optimal replacement periods of the control computer's components of Wolsung nuclear power plant Unit 1. We first derived mathematical models of optimal replacement periods to the digital control computer's components of Wolsung NPP Unit 1 and calculated the optimal replacement periods analytically. We compared the periods with the replacement periods currently used at Wolsung NPP Unit 1. The periods used at Wolsung is not based on mathematical analysis, but on empirical knowledge. As a consequence, the optimal replacement periods analytically obtained and those used in the field show a little difference.

The regulation is applied to thermal processes. The sampled data systems theory permits to choose the type of an efficient and simple digital compensator, and to establish a diagram which gives the values of the correcting parameters (obtained by minimizing the difference between the output and the input when perturbations occur). The programme execute, in simultaneity, supervision and regulation. Complex possibilities of printing out measures and alarms existed. The computer works out an incremental correction which makes step motors to turn. These motors act on the heating organs. The theoretical values and answers have been confirmed. The accuracy was limited essentially by the input quantification (1/1000 th). The comfort of such a system has been noticeable.

However, advances in digital technology, both in performance and cost, allow considerably more than simple control and monitoring. This, coupled with increasing demand for higher performance and monitoring capabilities, has made it appealing to integrate such technology into power supply designs. This paper will review current trends in the use of such advanced technology as embedded DSP controllers, and the application of real-time algorithms to the regulation and control of power supplies for accelerators and other large-scale physics applications\n\nDigital control in Finnish power industry applications and some research and development activities\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nHaapanen, P.; Winter, M.\n\n1986-01-01\n\nFirst applications of digital control systems in Finnish power plants stem from a few years time. There are at present in operation two conventional peat fuelled district heating power plants and two others are under construction. In existing nuclear power plants digital control systems are not used. Feasibility studies of a new fifth nuclear power plant have been carried out and also preliminary design exercises on its control systems has been done. It seems that the use of a digital control system in this plant is an alternative worthy of consideration. The existing digital control applications and future plans for their use in the Finnish power industry are described. The rest of the paper is devoted to the reliability questions. Software reliability is a new problem area emanating from the use of programmable digital systems. A description of a cooperative project on these questions between VTT and OECD Halden Project is given. VTT has also developed an interactive computer program, RELVEC, for plant and control system reliability analysis. The structure and use of this system is described\n\nA digital controller for the Omega West Reactor\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nMinor, M.M.; Kaufman, M.D.; Smith, T.W.\n\n1992-05-01\n\nA new nuclear reactor control system for the Omega West Reactor (OWR) has been designed to replace the aging and hard to maintain controller presently installed. The controller uses single board computers, digital and analog input and output modules, and stepping motor indexers installed on a standard bus (VME bus). The eight poison control rod drive motors are replaced with stepping motors. The control algorithm for the OWR was not changed in order to expedite approval for installation. This report presents the results of the development of the new control system. Included in the report are copies of some of the software that drives the new controller\n\nBattlefield awareness computers: the engine of battlefield digitization\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nHo, Jackson; Chamseddine, Ahmad\n\n1997-06-01\n\nTo modernize the army for the 21st century, the U.S. Army Digitization Office (ADO) initiated in 1995 the Force XXI Battle Command Brigade-and-Below (FBCB2) Applique program which became a centerpiece in the U.S. Army's master plan to win future information wars. The Applique team led by TRW fielded a 'tactical Internet' for Brigade and below command to demonstrate the advantages of 'shared situation awareness' and battlefield digitization in advanced war-fighting experiments (AWE) to be conducted in March 1997 at the Army's National Training Center in California. Computing Devices is designated the primary hardware developer for the militarized version of the battlefield awareness computers. The first generation of militarized battlefield awareness computer, designated as the V3 computer, was an integration of off-the-shelf components developed to meet the agressive delivery requirements of the Task Force XXI AWE. The design efficiency and cost effectiveness of the computer hardware were secondary in importance to delivery deadlines imposed by the March 1997 AWE. However, declining defense budgets will impose cost constraints on the Force XXI production hardware that can only be met by rigorous value engineering to further improve design optimization for battlefield awareness without compromising the level of reliability the military has come to expect in modern military hardened vetronics. To answer the Army's needs for a more cost effective computing solution, Computing Devices developed a second generation 'combat ready' battlefield awareness computer, designated the V3+, which is designed specifically to meet the upcoming demands of Force XXI (FBCB2) and beyond. The primary design objective is to achieve a technologically superior design, value engineered to strike an optimal balance between reliability, life cycle cost, and procurement cost. Recognizing that the diverse digitization demands of Force XXI cannot be adequately met by any one computer hardware\n\nDigital optical computer II\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nGuilfoyle, Peter S.; Stone, Richard V.\n\n1991-12-01\n\nOptiComp is currently completing a 32-bit, fully programmable digital optical computer (DOC II) that is designed to operate in a UNIX environment running RISC microcode. OptiComp's DOC II architecture is focused toward parallel microcode implementation where data is input in a dual rail format. By exploiting the physical principals inherent to optics (speed and low power consumption), an architectural balance of optical interconnects and software code efficiency can be achieved including high fan-in and fan-out. OptiComp's DOC II program is jointly sponsored by the Office of Naval Research (ONR), the Strategic Defense Initiative Office (SDIO), NASA space station group and Rome Laboratory (USAF). This paper not only describes the motivational basis behind DOC II but also provides an optical overview and architectural summary of the device that allows the emulation of any digital instruction set.\n\nComputer aided system for segmentation and visualization of microcalcifications in digital mammograms\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nReljin, B.; Reljin, I.; Milosevic, Z.; Stojic, T.\n\n2009-01-01\n\nTwo methods for segmentation and visualization of microcalcifications in digital or digitized mammograms are described. First method is based on modern mathematical morphology, while the second one uses the multifractal approach. In the first method, by using an appropriate combination of some morphological operations, high local contrast enhancement, followed by significant suppression of background tissue, irrespective of its radiology density, is obtained. By iterative procedure, this method highly emphasizes only small bright details, possible microcalcifications. In a multifractal approach, from initial mammogram image, a corresponding multifractal 'images' are created, from which a radiologist has a freedom to change the level of segmentation. An appropriate user friendly computer aided visualization (CAV) system with embedded two methods is realized. The interactive approach enables the physician to control the level and the quality of segmentation. Suggested methods were tested through mammograms from MIAS database as a gold standard, and from clinical praxis, using digitized films and digital images from full field digital mammograph.

The method uses unique redundancy management techniques to achieve recovery and restoration of redundant elements to full operation in an asynchronous environment. The system includes a first computing unit comprising a pair of redundant computational lanes for generating redundant control commands. One or more internal monitors detect data errors in the control commands, and provide a recovery trigger to the first computing unit. A second redundant computing unit provides the same features as the first computing unit. A first actuator control unit is configured to provide blending and monitoring of the control commands from the first and second computing units, and to provide a recovery trigger to each of the first and second computing units. A second actuator control unit provides the same features as the first actuator control unit.\n\nReliability Estimation for Digital Instrument/Control System\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nYang, Yaguang; Sydnor, Russell [U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, D.C. (United States)\n\n2011-08-15\n\nDigital instrumentation and controls (DI and C) systems are widely adopted in various industries because of their flexibility and ability to implement various functions that can be used to automatically monitor, analyze, and control complicated systems. It is anticipated that the DI and C will replace the traditional analog instrumentation and controls (AI and C) systems in all future nuclear reactor designs. There is an increasing interest for reliability and risk analyses for safety critical DI and C systems in regulatory organizations, such as The United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Developing reliability models and reliability estimation methods for digital reactor control and protection systems will involve every part of the DI and C system, such as sensors, signal conditioning and processing components, transmission lines and digital communication systems, D/A and A/D converters, computer system, signal processing software, control and protection software, power supply system, and actuators. Some of these components are hardware, such as sensors and actuators, their failure mechanisms are well understood, and the traditional reliability model and estimation methods can be directly applied. But many of these components are firmware which has software embedded in the hardware, and software needs special consideration because its failure mechanism is unique, and the reliability estimation method for a software system will be different from the ones used for hardware systems. In this paper, we will propose a reliability estimation method for the entire DI and C system reliability using a recently developed software reliability estimation method and a traditional hardware reliability estimation method.\n\nReliability Estimation for Digital Instrument/Control System\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nYang, Yaguang; Sydnor, Russell\n\n2011-01-01\n\nDigital instrumentation and controls (DI and C) systems are widely adopted in various industries because of their flexibility and ability to implement various functions that can be used to automatically monitor, analyze, and control complicated systems.

Overexposed X-rays can be qualitatively enhanced by means of controlled manipulation of contrast and brightness and by means of the use of various digital filtering techniques. With underexposed X-rays an equalized grey scale can be achieved by means of regulating contrast and brightness. Digital filtering is not required. To assure a high degree of anatomical detail (periodontal ligament) in the digitalized image a maximum pixel of 0.1 mm was defined as a qualitative norm. Since in every digitalization process resolution is diminished, it proved best to select for interactive manipulation out of the total image only the section of interest.\n\nATCA digital controller hardware for vertical stabilization of plasmas in tokamaks\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nBatista, A. J. N.; Sousa, J.; Varandas, C. A. F.\n\n2006-01-01\n\nThe efficient vertical stabilization (VS) of plasmas in tokamaks requires a fast reaction of the VS controller, for example, after detection of edge localized modes (ELM). For controlling the effects of very large ELMs a new digital control hardware, based on the Advanced Telecommunications Computing Architecture trade mark sign (ATCA), is being developed aiming to reduce the VS digital control loop cycle (down to an optimal value of 10 Î¼s) and improve the algorithm performance. The system has 1 ATCA trade mark sign processor module and up to 12 ATCA trade mark sign control modules, each one with 32 analog input channels (12 bit resolution), 4 analog output channels (12 bit resolution), and 8 digital input/output channels. The Aurora trade mark sign and PCI Express trade mark sign communication protocols will be used for data transport, between modules, with expected latencies below 2 Î¼s. Control algorithms are implemented on a ix86 based processor with 6 Gflops and on field programmable gate arrays with 80 GMACS, interconnected by serial gigabit links in a full mesh topology\n\nA general digital computer procedure for synthesizing linear automatic control systems\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nCummins, J.D.\n\n1961-10-01\n\nThe fundamental concepts required for synthesizing a linear automatic control system are considered. A generalized procedure for synthesizing automatic control systems is demonstrated. This procedure has been programmed for the Ferranti Mercury and the IBM 7090 computers. Details of the programmes are given. The procedure uses the linearized set of equations which describe the plant to be controlled as the starting point. Subsequent computations determine the transfer functions between any desired variables. The programmes also compute the root and phase loci for any linear (and some non-linear) configurations in the complex plane, the open loop and closed loop frequency responses of a system, the residues of a function of the complex variable 's' and the time response corresponding to these residues. With these general programmes available the design of 'one point' automatic control systems becomes a routine scientific procedure. Also dynamic assessments of plant may be carried out. Certain classes of multipoint automatic control problems may also be solved with these procedures. Autonomous systems, invariant systems and orthogonal systems may also be studied.
