        "text": "How do you improve the SEO of your website? Follow these suggestions to improve your search engine optimization (SEO) and watch your website rise the ranks to the top of search engine results pages (SERPs).\n\n1. Publish Relevant, Authoritative Content\n\nWe believe that on-page SEO is the key to improving search engine success on Google and other search engines. Quality, authoritative, authentic content is the number one driver of your search engine rankings and there is no substitute for great content—this is especially true when doing SEO marketing. Quality content created specifically for your intended user increases site traffic, which improves your site's authority and relevance. Fine-tune your web writing skills and present yourself as an authority on the topic you are writing about.\n\nKeywords\n\nIdentify and target a specific keyword phrase for each authoritative content page on your website. Think about how your reader might search for that specific page with search terms like:\n\nonline masters in engineering management\n\nwhat is biomedical engineering?\n\ntitle IX education resources\n\nphotographing northern lights\n\nhow to apply for scholarships?\n\nwhen is the FAFSA deadline?\n\nwhat is the difference between engineering and engineering technology?\n\nMultiple Keyword Phrases\n\nIt is very difficult for a webpage to achieve search engine rankings for multiple keyword phrases—unless those phrases are very similar. A single page may be able to rank for both \"biomedical engineering jobs\" and \"biomedical engineering careers\". Ranking for \"student affairs\" and \"dean of students\" or \"gender discrimination\" and \"violence reporting procedures\" with a single page is unlikely.\n\nIf you want to rank for multiple keywords phrases with your website, you will need to make a separate webpage for each keyword phrase you are targeting.\n\nPlacing Keywords\n\nOnce your keyword phrase is chosen for a given page, consider these questions:\n\nCan I use part or all of the keyword phrase in the page URL (by using keywords in folders)?\n\nRemember characters to avoid in URLs\n\nCan I use part or all of the keyword phrase in the page title?\n\nCan I use part or all of the keyword phrase in page headings and subheadings?\n\nAnswering yes to these questions can improve your search engine ranking. Be natural and user-friendly, though. For instance, you do not want the word \"engineering\" to show up three or more times in the URL or have the phrase Northern Lights repeated in the page title and also every heading. Readability and usability still trump search engine optimization.\n\nContent\n\nBeyond page URL, title, and headings, content is most influential on search engine rankings. Optimizing your content is often referred to as 'on-page SEO' or 'page optimization.' Repeat your keyword phrase several times throughout the page—once or twice in the opening and closing paragraphs, and two to four more times throughout the remaining content. Be authoritative. Strategically link to relevant sources and additional information—both within your organizations broad website and even to other websites which are useful to your end user. The content that you create is key to improving your SEO.\n\nExperience and Expertise\n\nWhen developing your content, it is especially important to lend your experiences and your expertise to your target audience. This will help your content stand out against everyone else's—including the plethora of content being created by generative artificial intelligence (AI) each day. Experiences and expertise builds credibility, engages users, and fosters long-term success. It aligns with search engines' goals of delivering high-quality, relevant information to users and can contribute to a strong online presence and improved SEO performance.\n\nSEO Formatting\n\nDon't forget to use bold, italics, heading tags (especially an H1), and other emphasis tags to highlight these keyword phrases—but don't overdo it. You still want your language and writing style to read naturally. Never sacrifice good writing for SEO. The best pages are written for the user, not for the search engine.

Search engines do, too. Regularly updated content is viewed as one of the best indicators of a site's relevancy, so be sure to keep it fresh. Audit your content on a set schedule (semesterly for example) and make updates as needed. Introduce new sources where appropriate, make additions and modifications, and keep your content fresh for your audience.\n\nBlogging\n\nWriting additional content, rich with keyword phrases, on your departmental news blog can also boost your search engine rankings. Blog posts can even be shorter updates about the specific topics you are targeting. Interlink your related CMS webpages and blog posts when it helps give the reader a better picture or additional information about the topic.\n\n3. Metadata\n\nWhen designing your website, each page contains a space between the <head> tags to insert metadata, or information about the contents of your page. If you have a CMS site originally produced by the UMC web team will have pre-populated this data for you. However, it is important for you to review and update metadata as your site changes over time.\n\nTitle Metadata\n\nTitle metadata is responsible for the page titles displayed at the top of a browser window and as the headline within search engine results. It is the most important metadata on your page.\n\nFor those with a CMS website, the web team has developed an automated system for creating the meta title for each webpage based on your page title. This adds to the importance of using well-thought-out page titles rich with keyword phrases.\n\nDescription Metadata\n\nDescription metadata is the textual description that a browser may use in your page search return. Think of it as your site's window display—a concise and appealing description of what is contained within, with the goal of encouraging people to enter. A good meta description will typically contain two full sentences. Search engines may not always use your meta description, but it is important to give them the option.\n\nKeyword Metadata\n\nKeyword metadata is rarely if ever used to tabulate search engine rankings. However, you should already know your keyword phrases, so it doesn't hurt to add them into your keyword metadata. You'll want to include a variety of phrases. As a general rule, try to keep it to about 3-7 phrases with each phrase consisting of 1-4 words. A great example would be \"computer science degree.\"\n\nUse alt tags\n\nAlways describe your image and video media using alt tags, or alternative text descriptions. They allow search engines to locate your page, which is crucial—especially for those who use text-only browsers or screen readers.\n\nUse Schema.org Markup\n\nWhile Google and other search engines are advanced at understanding content, we have found that implementing Schema.org markup on our webpages—especially published and modified dates—has helped our content crawl and recrawl rates and has influenced how our content shows up in SERPs.\n\n4. Have a link-worthy site\n\nA webpage which is content-rich, authoritative, unbiased, and helps visitors learn more about what they are interested in is most likely to attract links from other websites, which improves your search engine optimization.\n\nImprove your authority and credibility by adding relevant links within the text. Instead of having \"click here\" links, try writing out the name of the destination. \"Click here\" has no search engine value beyond the attached URL, whereas \"Michigan Tech Enterprise Program\" is rich with keywords and will improve your search engine rankings as well as the ranking of the page you are linking to. Always use descriptive links by linking keywords—it not only improves search engine optimization, but also adds value to your readers, including those with disabilities or who are using screen readers.\n\nSEO Rankings\n\nUse tools such as Google Search Console, Bing Webmaster Tools, or Moz to keep track of your SEO rankings. After 4-6 months, you should begin to see an increase in your search engine impressions. Over the next few months, these impressions should translate into clicks, which you can within your SEO tools and also your web analytics.\n\nNow, you are able to future optimize your content to make improvements, rise up the rankings, and serve your target audience.\n\n5. Optimize for mobile and execute technical SEO\n\nEnsure your website is mobile-responsive and offers a seamless user experience on smartphones and tablets. Remember to optimize images and other media for faster loading on mobile devices. You can test your website's mobile-friendliness using tools like Google's Lighthouse testing tool.\n\nWork with a strong web development to implement best practices for technical search engine optimization. This includes providing a fast, seamless user experience that is intuitive and high-performing. Compress images, minimizing HTTP requests, and enabling browser caching. Use a clean and organized URL structure that is easy for both users and search engines to navigate. Implement schema markup to enhance rich snippets and improve the visibility of your content in search results.\n\nWhy Prioritize Content Creation Over Off-Page SEO?\n\nOff-page SEO involves actions taken outside your website to influence search engine rankings. While opinions on its importance vary within the SEO community, we believe that dedicating time and resources to creating valuable content for your target audience yields greater benefits for your business.\n\nQuality content establishes your brand as a trusted source, attracting and engaging users, and encouraging return visits and content sharing. While off-page SEO tactics may offer short-term gains, content creation fosters long-term relationships and organic growth. By focusing on relevant content creation, we have achieved better results that scale compared to relying on off-page SEO strategies.\n\nThese are only a few of the many methods for how to improve your search engine ranking.
