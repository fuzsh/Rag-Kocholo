        "text": "In 1994, a pivotal year in technological advancement and innovation, the World Wide Web emerged, reshaping the landscape of technology and business for years to come.\n\nMeanwhile, the ASTech Awards celebrated outstanding achievements across diverse fields, ranging from journalism to biotechnology and industrial research\n\n1994’s Other Winners Include:\n\nMr. Arthur Heller, winner Journalism: General Public, developed Science, Technology and Society, a seven-part series of fifteen-minute video programs that provide real-life examples of complex topics. Produced through Access TV’s Edmonton facility, the series is aimed at senior high school students, although the topics covered are also of interest to more general audiences. Among the issues explored are how scientific knowledge develops, and the influence of society on scientific and technology research.\n\nWinner of Outstanding Commercial Achievement in Alberta Science and Technology, Broadband equipment innovator IDACOM Telecom Division, a division of Hewlett-Packard Canada, was recognized for its commercial achievement for its specialized high-performance protocol testing solutions. This homegrown Alberta company grew from technology originally developed by AGT (Alberta Government Telephones) Limited (now Telus) – and in 1993 had revenues exceeding $30 million."
