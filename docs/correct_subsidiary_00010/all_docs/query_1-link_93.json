Command-line interfaces, which have been around since the 1960s, require users to type in commands in order to interact with computers. In the 1980s, graphical user interfaces were developed to make computers more user-friendly. These interfaces used windows and icons to represent commands and data. In the 1990s, as the internet grew in popularity, web-based interfaces replaced traditional methods. Then, in the middle of the 2000s, smartphones and tablets appeared, leading to the era of touch-based interfaces and radically changing the ways in which we engage with electronic gadgets. The road map of UIs development over the years is depicted in Fig. 1.\n\nThe advancement of modern technology like AI, the IoT, digital twins, AR, VR, and MR is now leading us to a new generation of UIs lee2021all . These modern technologies are blurring the distinction between real and virtual environments. This seamless and highly efficient blending of the physical environment with the digital realm creates endless possibilities for highly immersive, interactive experiences. Spatial computing is one such technology that encompasses many enabling technologies, including the IoT, digital twins, ambient computing, AR, VR, and AI. The term spatial computing was first coined by Simon Greenwold in 2003, whereby it refers to the interaction between humans and machines, in which a machine has the ability to retain and manipulate referents to real-world objects and surroundings greenwold2003spatial .\n\nMany digital technologies, such as MR, AR, and VR, may facilitate virtual immersion. These technologies may be summed up as XR and belong to the immersive technologies category. The future of ”Spatial Computing” will be significantly influenced by XR technologies. Spatial computing technologies enable us to transition from an existing global data network with flat or restricted dimensions to an emerging immersive global data ecosystem that improves performance and senses by giving virtual features to actual things and vice versa. Creating connections between data and representations in larger physical dimensions requires creating a new, complex, multimodal user interaction paradigm as well as the supporting infrastructure. As a result of the paradigm shift from representational to localised and often embodied content creation and consumption, bodily awareness and self-presence are created within the material and the information it conveys. This is seen in an entirely different way as a hybrid or virtual synthetic human experience mystakidis2023immersive . In 2023, spatial computing gained traction because of Apple’s Vision Pro, a headgear with AR, VR, and MR capabilities waisberg2023apple . Spatial computing devices map the surroundings of the user by using data from cameras and other sensors. To determine the geometry of the objects surrounding the user, this data is often passed through one or more algorithms. The classification of the items in the area of vision may also involve image recognition on more sophisticated devices. The technology can superimpose virtual objects that integrate with the real world once it has a spatial map of the area and an understanding of the objects inside.\n\n1.1 Related works and Contributions\n\nSpatial computing had a market value of around $102.1 billion in the year 2021.

The authors came to the conclusion that spatial computing technology has the potential to improve the well-being of people with visual impairments masalkhi2023apple .\n\nAn experiment conducted by Soyoung Jung et al. aimed to evaluate the impact of spatial embodiment in augmented reality on medical attitudes towards the self. In this study, the presence was shown through a variety of devices, such as a two-dimensional screen, a three-dimensional dummy, and the participant’s own bodies. A total of 90 college students took part in the experiment. They watched advertisements that showed virtual pictures of foetuses and X-rays of the lungs. The results of the study showed that public service announcements with increasingly detailed physical interfaces improve the feeling of ”being there,” which is also called ”spatial presence.” This evoked adverse emotions towards smoking. When the dual model process is mediated by the spatial presence, it raises adverse attitudes towards smoking that increase the behavioural intention of participants to engage with the campaign jung2019augmented .\n\nIn order to investigate how ambient temperature and virtual tourism audio-visual settings affect tourists’ thermal perception and comfort level, Xiao-Ting Huang et al. carried out an experimental laboratory investigation. A 3×2×23223\\times 2\\times 23 × 2 × 2 experimental design was used in the investigation, and 180 individuals made up the participant group.

Digital content refers to any information related to virtual objects, animations, holograms, etc. Within a given space, spatial context involves understanding and interpreting virtual objects, entities, and events with respect to their physical location and the geometric relationships between them. By utilizing these relationships, spatial computing ensures that virtual objects are placed correctly to interact with real objects and respond accurately to user movements and actions.\n\nIn traditional HCI experiences, users interact with the user interfaces of websites and mobile devices. The goal of spatial computing is to enhance HCI by providing intuitive ways of engaging with digital content as if it were part of their physical environment clifton2016design .\n\nAR: AR involves overlaying digital information, such as images, videos, or 3D models, onto the real world. AR enhances our perception of reality by adding virtual elements that interact with and augment our physical environment. AR can be experienced through devices like smartphones, tablets, smart glasses, or heads-up displays. It allows users to see and interact with virtual content while still being aware of the real world xiong2021augmented .\n\nVR: VR aims to create a fully immersive digital experience by simulating a virtual environment that users can interact with using specialized hardware, such as VR headsets. VR completely replaces the user’s real-world surroundings and transports them to a simulated, computer-generated environment. Users perceive themselves as being present in a different world and can explore and interact with virtual objects and spaces scavarelli2021virtual .\n\nSpatial Computing: Spatial computing is a broader concept that encompasses both AR and VR but goes beyond them. It refers to the use of technology to understand and interact with the physical world in a spatial context. Spatial computing combines the real and virtual worlds, allowing users to perceive and interact with digital content within their physical environment.

Despite these, it played a significant role in shaping the future trajectory of the industry. The HoloLens employs “waveguide” optics, a flat optical system that fuses real-world vision with computer graphics. Utilizing a diffraction grating, a type of Diffractive Optical Element (DOE), the waveguide bends or “incouples” the light so it undergoes Total Internal Reflection (TIR) within the glass waveguide. The light then rebounds off the flat surfaces within the glass, encounters a triangular “fold zone,” and is directed towards an “exit zone” DOE. Here, the angle of the light is reduced so it no longer experiences TIR and can exit the glass towards the viewer’s eye. Despite being a technological marvel, this intricate optical system has been associated with high manufacturing costs and low yield rates, potentially affecting the affordability of the HoloLens for consumers ref1 .\n\nOne notable limitation of the HoloLens was its Field of View (FoV).
