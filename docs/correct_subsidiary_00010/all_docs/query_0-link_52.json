        "text": "Panelists for the Maze War 30 Year Retrospective\n\nAt the Vintage Computer Festival 7.0\n\nPanel to be held at the Vintage Computer Festival\n\nSunday November 7, 2004, 1:00 pm (track 01) at the\n\nComputer History Museum, Mountain View, CA\n\nSee this session and Sunday's tracks described here\n\nGreg Thompson\n\nGreg Thompson , Chief Video Architect, Cisco’s Video Networking Business Unit\n\nIn September 2003, Greg Thompson joined Cisco as the Chief Video Architect for their Video Networking Business Unit (VNBU) now part of the Broadband Edge & Midrange Routing (BEMRBU) focused on developing products and leadership in video transport and processing for MSO and Telco operators, building on Cisco’s existing leadership in DOCSIS-based high speed data, GigE switching, and IP routing technology.\n\nPrior to Cisco, Greg Thompson was the Chief Technology Officer for nCUBE, responsible for directing research and development strategies. Focusing on the company's video server development and video-on-demand (VOD) products, Mr. Thompson analyzed and promoted access network architectures, standards and other technologies applicable to video servers and broadband video delivery. Starting in 1993, Mr. Thompson was involved in the early VOD and interactive TV market trials for nCUBE at British Telecom, Bell Atlantic, and elsewhere.\n\nPrior to nCUBE, Mr. Thompson was a co-founder and consulting engineer of Interlink Computer Sciences, where he was a primary architect of DECnet and TCP/IP products for IBM’s MVS and VM systems used at major corporations. Before that, Mr. Thompson was a consultant with Digital Equipment Corporation.\n\nMr. Thompson is a graduate of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, with a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science and Engineering. He is a member of the Society of Cable Telecommunications Engineers (SCTE), Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers (SMPTE), and Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE) computer societies.\n\nGreg Thompson's Maze History\n\nIn 1974 I took the original Imlac Maze implementation developed at NASA/Ames by Steve Colley and Howard Palmer to the MIT Project Mac DMS lab and enhanced it into a full networked multi-player game. This was in co-operation with Dave Lebling who did the ITS/PDP-10 side multiplexor, robot generator, and server program. Later in Fall 1976 I also did the Maze processor design for the 7400-series TTL logic 3D hardware version implemented for the MIT 6.111/6.112 digital design lab along with Mark Horowitz who did the display processor and George Woltman who did the firmware (which included robots) in 512 bytes of memory.\n\nPowerpoint delivered by Greg Thompson, The aMazing History of Maze:\n\nHTML version of presentation, or\n\nPowerpoint version of presentation (4.4MB)\n\nHoward Palmer\n\nHoward Palmer got his start in computing in 1969, as a junior in high school, through the NASA Ames Student Space Biology Program. Together with Steve Colley, another high school student at Ames, they conceived and implemented the original Maze program on the Imlac PDS-1. Howard and Steve continued to work at Ames in a small group of students under the direction of Jim Hart. Mainly through the use of Imlac workstations, this group greatly expanded the availability of interactive computer graphics to researchers at Ames.\n\nThis group was also central to early networking research at Ames. They designed and implemented hardware and software to support a network of Imlac workstations, served by a custom operating system on an IBM 1800. Howard implemented an ARPAnet Network Control Program (NCP) running on DOS-11 on a PDP-11/45. That may help to explain why Howard's undergraduate adviser at Stanford, Vint Cerf, was unable to interest him in working on a new protocol, called TCP/IP. As he explained to Dr. Cerf, \"I've done networking. I came here to get into artificial intelligence.\"\n\nHoward soon became disillusioned with AI, at least as it was practiced at that time, and did eventually wise up about networking, building a long career around TCP/IP and other protocols, and ultimately winning financial freedom in the lottery that was Netscape. Since early 2001, he has been taking a break to pursue personal interests. Besides life, the universe, and everything, these interests still include artificial intelligence, which Howard feels is finally on the right track. His most recent projects have been in the area of genetic programming. Howard can be reached as user hep at the domain acm.org.\n\nSee Howard's early history of Maze here. Howard is doing special development for this event including: an Imlac assembler, modifications to the MIT mazewar source to work on Tom Uban's Imlac PDS-1D, a Java server which shuttles packets between the Imlac and the network, and a Windows mazewar client. Thanks Howard!\n\nKen Harrenstien\n\nMaze at INTEROP in 1992, thanks to Oracle and Ken Harrenstien\n\nKen worked on the Oracle version of Maze for INTEROP in 1992. More here soon.\n\nTom Uban\n\nTom Uban became interested in computers during his high school years when he would spend time on the Plato terminal at Valparaiso University, playing one of the many multi-user games such as empire, trek, or dogfight. While at Purdue University, where he acquired his BSEE, he had the opportunity to use two Imlac terminals, a PDS-1 and a PDS-1D, again generally for playing games such as space war. Tom was not directly exposed to mazewar at this time.\n\nFollowing college, Tom's interests and work took him to Bolt, Baranek, and Neuman (in Cambridge, MA), where he helped to port the CMU Mach operating system to both the Butterfly and TC2000 massively parallel computers. Following BBN, he started a successful consulting company through which he performed work for a number of fortune 500 companies until returning to the midwest to design pinball games for Williams Electronics Games in Chicago. While at Williams, besides working on a number of game titles, he was also the system architect for the Pinball 2000 platform, which utilized an innovative 3-D virtual image married with the conventional pinball table. Tom is currently a technical leader at Cisco Systems.\n\nAmong Tom's interests are vintage computers, including the Imlac PDS-1D which he used while at Purdue University, and which he has maintained in a functional state over the years.\n\nBruce Damer is co-founder and Curator of the DigiBarn Computer Museum in the Santa Cruz Mountains of the Bay Area of Northern California. He has a passion for both the history of visual computing and a practice in the virtual worlds business as CEO of DigitalSpace Corporation and the author of the first book on Avatars and multi-player games on the Internet. So... his mania to bring Maze to a modern audience is understandable. Bruce will introduce Maze with a brief presentation and then moderate the panel. Working with DigiBarn crew Bruce will also bring some historic systems running Maze for hands-on experiencing during the VCF. More about Bruce's wacky life here.\n\nReturn to Maze War 30 Year Retrospective Event Page"
