        "text": "CAMARILLO, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Interlink Electronics, Inc. (OTC: LINK) announced today the launch of their new Hardware Development Kits that offer out of the box sensor technologies solutions, ready to be implemented in all next generation products that require force & position sensors and mouse & pointing solutions.\n\nPackaged for testing and learning about FSR® technology, the Hardware Development Kits (HDKs) provide all the necessary components for engineers and developers to realize their own designs.\n\nThe Hardware Development Kits include:\n\nThe FSR® 400 series kit - ideal for implementation in human touch control of electronic devices such as automotive electronics, medical systems and industrial PCs. Force Sensing Resistors (FSR®) are robust, polymer thick film (PTF) devices that exhibit a decrease in resistance when increased pressure is applied to the surface of the sensor.\n\nThe VersaPad® kit includes a versatile touchpad module intended for integration by OEMs into laptops, military and rugged computers, panel PCs and medical devices. With smoothness and sensitivity internally enhanced by true pressure measurement, it offers all customary mouse functions - mousing, tapping, dragging, and scrolling. The module's tough, moisture and grime resistant surface can be used with a finger or stylus, even in wet or dirty environments and it operates over an extended temperature range of -20°C to +60°C.\n\nThe 4-zone mousing Hardware Development Kit (HDK) is the perfect tool to evaluate this unique mouse pointing solution. The HDK provides all the necessary components to understand and evaluate how to implement accurate 360-degree mouse control.\n\nThe Ring Sensor kit enables intuitive scrolling and menu navigation functionality for consumer electronic devices in an easy to integrate, high resolution, ultra low-power package. It is ideal for media players, mobile phones, control panels, medical instruments, and home entertainment devices to control streaming media, audio, balance, menus, play lists and gaming functions that involve rotation and steering. The sensor can be integrated directly into the device's host processor without the need for a dedicated microprocessor.\n\nThe Interlink Force Sensing Linear Potentiometer (FSLP) is a linear position sensor for menu navigation and control. It functions as a linear potentiometer with the ability to detect a user's force for high rate scrolling and a more intuitive user experience. The FSLP is an easy to integrate, high resolution, ultra low-power package.\n\nThe MicroModule is a finger-actuated \"mouse\" pointing module that provides complete 360-degree directional control and accurate speed control simultaneously. It is ideal for computer cursor control in rugged mobile computers, hardened keyboards, navigation systems, machine control panels, pan and tilt controllers, motion controllers, CNC controllers and medical control equipment. It's a durable, maintenance-free \"miniature\" solution that works well in tight spaces and is capable of delivering \"mouse\" lifetimes of more than 3 million actuations.\n\nThe Micro Joystick Hardware Development Kit (HDK) includes the high-precision Micro Joystick solution which is an innovative, intuitive, OEM pointing system that delivers simultaneous 360-degree control of direction and speed at the touch of a fingertip.\n\n\"Our objective with these development kits was to make it simple for designers and engineers to understand the versatility, simplicity and ease of use of our technology,\" said Declan Flannery, Chief Operating officer of Interlink Electronics.\"In today's competitive environment short development time can provide a critical advantage.The kits will save designers and engineers valuable time, effort and money while at the same time shortening the product development cycle.\"\n\nThe out of the box Hardware Development Kits from Interlink Electronics are turnkey solutions for any engineer or developer ready to design a successful next generation product.
