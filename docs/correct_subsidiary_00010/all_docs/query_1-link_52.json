        "text": "Our Staff\n\nMatt Chuah\n\nProgrammer\n\nMatt Chuah came on board as a full-time programmer in the Berrien Springs office after several years as a contract worker. He previously worked as a web developer for four years doing primarily intranet web applications.\n\nPrior to that, Matt graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from the University of Florida, though he has spent the majority of his life in the Berrien Springs area.\n\nMatt and his wife enjoy baking cakes and trying new restaurants together.\n\nIn his hypothetical free time, Matt also enjoys reading science fiction, playing video games and working on small programming projects.\n\nTo contact Matt, please send email correspondence to matt@ilsw.com.\n\nJim Garber\n\nProgrammer and Postal Specialist\n\nJim Garber of Ohio, helped form Interlink with his brother, Bill, in 1980.\n\nHe earned his bachelor of science degree in Physics, Business and Education with a minor in Math from Andrews University in Michigan.\n\nJim’s areas of expertise are Postal Presort, Earned Income and Close Issue. He also is responsible for the Ad Billing program.\n\nJim’s hobbies are bird watching, photography and travel. He is married to “a wonderful wife” and enjoys the antics of their two Maine Coon cats.\n\nTo contact Jim, please send email to jim@ilsw.com.\n\nWilliam (Bill) E Garber\n\nFounder / Chairman\n\nIn February 1980, Bill combined a keen interest in journalism, printing and technology by founding Interlink. Always an opportunist, he had earned his way through college as a printer, having previously learned composition at a California Job Case and pressmanship in front of a Chandler and Price “snapper” as a pre-OSHA child in his uncle’s job shop.\n\nWith an undergraduate degree in English and math from Andrews University in Michigan, an M.A. in Journalism from Michigan State University, and a Ph.D. in mass communication from the Scripps School of Journalism at Ohio University, Bill founded Interlink after a 13-year teaching career in California, Tennessee, Ohio and Michigan.\n\nBill left his Alma Mater, Andrews University, as chair of the communication department, and its teaching staff of eight, to found Interlink with his brother, Jim, and cousin, Ed.\n\nInterlink began with a vision of leveraging consumer technology to create inexpensive, high-value solutions to community newspaper publishing needs. From its original digital writing and editing system linked to Compugraphic typesetters in 1980, to today’s newspaper circulation management and mailing system that leverages the Internet and virtual machines on high-powered commodity servers, Bill has kept Interlink true to his vision.\n\nToday Bill’s interests also include skiing, a sport he took up in his mid-fifties, and SCUBA, a sport he took up in his mid-sixties, as well as reading and debating the issues of the day by email with nearby and distant friends.\n\nTo contact Bill directly, please send email correspondence to bill@ilsw.com.\n\nBrad Hill\n\nCEO\n\nAs CEO of Interlink, Brad Hill is passionate about ensuring an exceptional experience across all touch points with Interlink. He began working with Interlink in 2001 as a technical contractor after leaving his previous position as Network Administrator for a private school system in Tennessee. Recognizing his ability to bridge the gap between technical issues and non-technical people, Interlink offered Brad a permanent position handling the integration of Interlink Circulation into new customers’ business systems. Brad moved into his current position to support a like-minded focus on shaping and meeting customer expectations and delivering an unprecedented quality of service in the industry.\n\nWhile studying Computer Science at the University of Tennessee in Chattanooga, he honed his soft skills by working as a “Saloon Keeper” (glorified bartender) at a local fine-dining restaurant. Brad is a Microsoft Certified Systems Engineer and works closely with Interlink’s development efforts to promote features and usability in line with customer needs.\n\nAs the father of three young children, Brad believes his work at Interlink complements his role as a parent increasing his effectiveness at both. When not working with Interlink, Brad’s interests include traveling to warm locations with his wife and dabbling in the world of amateur photography, with a primary interest in portraiture.\n\nTo contact Brad directly, please send email to brad@ilsw.com.\n\nLarina Hollivay\n\nClient Solutions Representative\n\nLarina Hollivay joined Interlink the summer of 2013 as a member of the Client Solutions team in the Berrien Springs office, and became supervisor of the team as of June 2015. Her experiences include more than 10 years working in technical and customer support, as well as in sales and sales retention. Larina, in her roles as team manager, department supervisor and operations manager, provided technical and customer support for the Dell and Gateway call center in Mississippi.
