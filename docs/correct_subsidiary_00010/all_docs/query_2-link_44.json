We even just submitted our concept for exactly this in the recent ARPA-H BAA.\n\nEssentially, current molecular diagnostic systems cannot be utilized in largescale surveillance such as those for indoor air quality due to reagents use per test, as well as their inherent non-real time nature. This problem also presents in food and water testing where volumes are inherently large (opposite to personalized genomic diagnostics).\n\nWe're building cheap sampling systems to selectively concentrate bacteria from large sample volumes, and a real-time label free imaging systems that use machine learning on optical scattering data to solve exactly this. In fact for Tuberculosis, we showed our sampling system increases performance of microscopy from 50% to over 90% in real patient samples, at a fraction of PCR costs! These systems have diagnostic use in global health, remote and rural health diagnostics, food and water safety testing, and are/being designed for scalability especially in lower-middle income countries and communities.\n\nWe're really excited that moving to a preventative model of diagnostics is a priority.We're looking for companies that already have some product in technical areas 2 and 3, are preferably based in the US, and understand the vision of BREATH as a priority. We're a small company, and our cutting edge products are experimental - ideal partners would be flexible to allow for iterations, and help lead ARPA-H's PRD.Technical area 1: creating indoor air biosensors;e-sensBrian Cummings, Presidentbcummings@e-sens.comalalonde@e-sens.comSalt Lake City, UtahWe specialize in fully automated, state-of-the-art drinking water, waste water, and air quality quantitative monitoring using proprietary silicon-based sensors and microfluidics to revolutionize the current state of quality testing.At e-sens, we understand the importance of collaboration and integration of cross-disciplinary teams\n\nto create revolutionary technology to disrupt the status-quo.

We were the first to measure airflows in the built environment using thermal dispersion technology. We are the only solution provider to use individually calibrated bead-in-glass thermistors as the basis of measurement. Each airflow node is individually calibrated up to 16 points to a NIST traceable standard within +/-2% of reading and +/-0.08°C, providing mass and volumetric measurement. This unique solution provides an array of individual flow and temperature measuring points with industry leading accuracy in a package that provides long term stability and no further calibration. We are the only solution that uses velocity weighting of our average temperature measurement and have incorporated humidity and barometric pressure for a patented solution. We have several solutions with multiple data acquisition methods, including a bi-directional bleed sensor that can measure small pressure differentials as low as 0.05Pa.\n\nEBTRON promotes IAQ in the built environment through industry education, standards development, and publicly supporting programs such as the Clean Air in Buildings Challenge, Efficient and Healthy Schools program, Healthy Buildings 2021 and Indoor Air 2024.\n\nEBTRON is looking to partner on a team that understands that buildings and their HVAC systems are complex, have many interactions, and are under constant change. Understanding the fate and transport of bioaerosols are directly impacted by mechanical HVAC systems; that dynamic changes external and internal to a building or between spaces interact with the HVAC system; that interaction between HVAC systems or other external or internal forces can cause instability to operation; that conditioning a space, maintaining pressurization control, and avoiding unplanned airflows requires ongoing measurement and control of individual system airflows. It is important to also understand that operators can make changes that can inadvertently impact the performance of the HVAC system and without adequate sensed parameters, may go undetected and result in the failure to provide a healthy space. Additionally, as degradation within a system occurs, it is essential to trend changes of the rate of airflow, temperature, or moisture within the systems for both preemptive corrective action and fault detection.Technical area 3: optimizing building systems for healthier indoor air;Building4Health, Inc.Stephanie Taylor, MD, CEOstephanie@b4hinc.competer@b4hinc.comStowe, VTWe have developed a medically based, health index for airborne exposures within the existing thermal environment. Our index reflects the short and long term physiological impact of both individual and combined air constituents. To implement our index to protect occupant health, we measure indoor and outdoor thermal conditions and contaminant concentrations, analyze the health impact, report findings and recommend remediation prompts when the indoor index is suboptimal. Because we monitor both indoor air and outdoor air, we give the most effective and energy efficient indoor air quality improvement recommendations.We need a partner to tie our indoor air remediation prompts to the building automation system.Technical area 2: developing respiratory risk assessment software;Technical area 3: optimizing building systems for healthier indoor air;Technical area 1: creating indoor air biosensors;UGAKenan Song, Associate Professorkenan.song@uga.eduks62267@uga.eduAthens, GAKenan Song's research can significantly contribute to the development of indoor air biosensors through his expertise in advanced materials, microfluidics, and sensor technology.

This is crucial for the practical deployment of indoor air biosensors in diverse environments.\n\nThe ability to produce components on a micro-scale using 3D printing can also reduce the cost and complexity of sensor manufacturing, facilitating wider deployment.\n\nMultiplexed Detection Systems:\n\nKenan Song’s expertise in developing multiplexed systems could be instrumental in creating sensors that can detect multiple types of pathogens and allergens simultaneously. His approach could involve the integration of various sensor modalities within a single device to provide comprehensive monitoring capabilities.\n\nEmerging Technologies for Enhanced Diagnostics:\n\nExploring the integration of molecular diagnostics techniques, such as PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) amplification or CRISPR-based methods, into microfluidic devices could further enhance the capabilities of indoor air biosensors. These technologies would allow for not only detecting but also quantifying and even identifying unknown biological particles based on genetic information.\n\nIn summary, Kenan Song's research can substantially advance the field of indoor air biosensors by applying his expertise in microfluidics, advanced materials, and sensor technology to develop innovative, effective, and multiplexed bioaerosol-sensing devices. This aligns well with the goals of monitoring and improving indoor air quality through the detection of pathogens and allergens.Molecular Biologists:\n\nExpertise in genetic and molecular diagnostic techniques, such as PCR, RT-PCR, and CRISPR-based biosensors. This expertise is essential for incorporating molecular diagnostics into the biosensors to identify and quantify pathogens and allergens.\n\nBioengineers:\n\nSpecialization in integrating biological components with engineering systems, is crucial for designing and optimizing the interfaces where biological samples interact with detection technologies within the device.\n\nChemical Engineers:\n\nExperience in aerosol technology and fluid dynamics to improve the capture and processing of airborne particles. Chemical engineers can also contribute to the development of materials and coatings that enhance particle capture efficiency and specificity.\n\nPublic Health Experts:\n\nProvide insights into the most significant pathogens and allergens to monitor, based on public health priorities. Their knowledge helps in tailoring the biosensor development to meet real-world needs and regulatory requirements.\n\nRegulatory and Compliance Specialists:\n\nImportant for navigating the complex regulatory landscape of medical and environmental devices to ensure that the biosensors meet all necessary standards and approvals before they can be deployed.Technical area 1: creating indoor air biosensors;University of Maryland-BiologyJoshua Weitz, Professor of Biology and Clark Leadership Chair in Data Analyticsjsweitz@umd.eduCollege Park, MarylandJoshua S.

As a signal, this intentional cough is a rich source of biometric and biomarker data that represents detectable features indicating changes or specific disease signatures.\n\nFrom this very data-rich signal, we are able to:\n\n• Diagnose specific diseases in ~90 seconds\n\n• Monitor, detect, and score both subtle and gross impacts to a given individual’s respiratory system that could result from exposure to pathogens, environmental toxins, pollution, chemical/biological agents, wildfire smoke, or any other potentially harmful threat\n\nOur technology architecture is completely digital. Our software-only approach to diagnostics and respiratory monitoring affords us numerous advantages over lab-based or hardware-based capabilities:\n\n• Our solutions are completely non-invasive;\n\n• Users only need a smart phone and an internet connection, eliminating the need for expensive testing infrastructure or specialized hardware and devices.\n\n• Cough sound submissions can be stored and used repeatedly with no degradation of quality;\n\n• We have no manufacturing costs, no production delays, no supply chain at risk of disruption, and no consumables creating waste;\n\n• Results from diagnostic tests or monitoring activity are available in under 2 minutes;\n\n• Our systems are incredibly scalable – at present we can process 20,000 tests per second.\n\n• All usage and results data can be easily integrated into any existing system or platform.\n\nWe are interested in incorporating our FCV analytics solutions into the BREATHE program as a method of identifying and measuring potential impacts to individuals that may be caused by poor indoor air quality and also act as an additional form of early-warning threat detection. Some additional information is below:\n\nRAIsonance has developed proprietary Forced Cough Vocalization (FCV) analysis technology that tracks impacts and resulting alterations to respiratory function. Our tools detect changes in an individual’s unique FCV using advanced audio processing, specialized feature extraction, machine learning, and proprietary artificial intelligence models and techniques. This specialized technology can identify minuscule, potentially high-risk changes that take place in an individual’s FCV by comparing current coughs to a baseline profile for that individual.\n\nOur AI engines are trained to identity these changes no matter what the cause: pathogen, environmental toxin, chemical exposure, or other harmful respiratory threats. While our FCV wellness solutions do not diagnose any conditions or distinguish between pathogens, toxins or chemical agents, they are designed to provide a fast, biometric, early-warning signal of a potential health issue for any user.\n\nOur AI-powered cough analytics solutions are ideally suited to enable individuals to check for any potential impacts from poor indoor air quality. Our \"FCV Sentinel\" solution gives individuals the ability to check their FCV Score on-demand and from anywhere by providing a few intentional coughs into a smartphone app. The solution does not require any sensors, hardware, or specialized devices other than their own smartphone. From the user-friendly mobile app, users can track their FCV Scores, log symptoms, and enter other vital signs.\n\nFCV Scores of multiple users within an organization can be aggregated and viewed via FCV Sentinel dashboards, or integrated directly into other monitoring platforms to give administrators an FCV Score view alongside other sensor data. When viewed at an aggregate level, unusual or sudden occurrences of multiple individuals all experiencing low FCV Scores can indicate a more systemic issue within the building itself that needs immediate investigation and possible remediation, such as the presence of an infectious disease or some toxins or chemicals or other hazardous substances in the air.\n\nTechnical area 1: creating indoor air biosensors;Technical area 3: optimizing building systems for healthier indoor air;Technical area 2: developing respiratory risk assessment software;University of MichiganXudong (Sherman) Fan, Professorxsfan@umich.eduAnn Arbor, Michigan(1) Our lab developed novel automated and portable (~1 kg, small shoebox in size) comprehensive 2-dimensional gas chromatography (GC) device for rapid (~10 minutes) high resolution indoor air quality (volatile organic compounds - VOCs) analysis and aerosol analysis (after aerosol collection and evaporation) at a low cost (low ownership cost and low recurring cost)\n\n(2) By using our unique vapor detectors, our VOCs detection limit can reach <0.01 ppt (in 1 L of air sample).

Leveraging our experience in aerosol science and engineering, we propose to extend our current focus to include a novel, physics-based technology for high throughput separation of room air particles from 1nm to 10 µm for downstream classification.\n\nWe are engineers with strong backgrounds in aerosol sciences. To implement the project goals we favor a modular architecture connected by innovative initial collection and separation of air samples based on our design innovations. Furthermore, our DMA-based detector is well suited for viral pathogens. We need teammates to fulfill the BREATHE vision. We seek partners in risk assessment software, building systems, biosensor technologies for bacteria and spores/allergens, and other orthogonal and complementary technologies.

IBAC-2 relies on the principle of Ultraviolet Laser-Induced Fluorescence (UV-LIF); a laser tuned for biological cofactors continuously monitor air for fluorescent fingerprints associated with bioaerosols. UV-LIF is widely used to sort biological particulates. IBAC-2 is a rapid trigger and sample collector that can be used as a standalone bioaerosol trigger or in concert with a confirmatory biological analyzer. Further, FLIR has recently engineered the IBAC-2 into Class 1 unmanned aerial system (UAS) payload called MUVE B330 for standoff detection and collection of biological aerosols as part of the JPEO-CBRND’s NBCRV SSU program. This next generation system has key improvements including exponential increase in the computational power of the system. The core optical cell and detection algorithm used in the IBAC-2 and MUVE B330 are identical. Teledyne FLIR has recently been researching the ability to presumptively identify biological aerosols (bacteria, fungi, molds, viruses, allergens) by their unique UV-LIF fingerprints. We propose this technology as a low-cost, rapid bioaerosol detector, collector, and presumptive identification system within footprint of a bio-trigger.Teledyne FLIR seeks to partner with a Prime that has capabilities in TA2 and TA3, as well as a confirmatory biodetection company in TA1. Teledyne FLIR proposes to improve the IBAC-2 by modifying the COTS sensor with AI algorithms that enable rapid (1 Hz) detection, collection and presumptive identification of bioaerosols. The Aerosolized Biological Intelligence & Collection Utility System (ABICUS) is a highly-SWaP reduced version of IBAC-2 that can be physically integrated with confirmatory sensing platforms (eg. PCR or Lateral Flow Assays) or can be networked to provide real-time baseline aerosol particle counts, background measurements and presumptive indication.
