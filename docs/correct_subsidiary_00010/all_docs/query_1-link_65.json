        "text": "There has never been before such an opportunity for new ideas and products to reach a global market as we have today via the Internet. A small team of individuals can rapidly build and offer new products or services worldwide in a matter of days and weeks instead of months and years, and at a far lower cost than it took our parents and grandparents to achieve the same level of achievement, An offering that addresses a real need can reach millions in revenue and become a market leader even before the companies and products it obsoletes knows what happened, while new offerings that fail to find an audience can be rapidly terminated or pivioted without waisting a lot of time, effort and fortune.\n\nWhat has made this entrepreneurship opportunity possible is a combination of business and development strategies, including Lean Startup, Incubators and Accelerators and Agile Development, combined with modern open source, mobile web, cloud computing, multimedia, and networking technologies. You do not have to turn your ideas into a viable company by yourself. You can leverage, combine and build upon what others have already created to craft your solution to a common customer problem in a unique, efficient and elegant way. This enables you to rapidly transform your ideas into code, product and service offerings, getting them in front of customers, measure and learn from those offerings, and then drive improvements in a rapid continuous cycle. Innovation is what drives economic opportunity and today's technology has never before made it easier."
