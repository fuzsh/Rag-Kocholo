The Glasgow Poets IT would be an interesting study to discover whether town or country is more congenial to the production of the \"maker.\" The country indeed possesses all those appeals to the senses — the sights, sounds, and scents of nature — which are popularly supposed to offer the first themes for poetry. But there is room to question whether these sights, sounds, and scents are most keenly and consciously enjoyed by him who lives always among them. The senses, after all, are not our finest instruments of perception. Memory and imagination remain more subtle, and project infinitely rarer pictures on the mind. So it may be that the clerk in his city attic, with nothing in sight but the roof- tops and the sky, has visions of green lanes and laughing seas, meadows of blue forget-me-not and moors of yellow asphodel that are seen in no such perfection by the mere dweller in their midst. B 2 THE GLASGOW POETS Whatever the reason, it is surprising to find how many poets are born, or at least discover their genius, in town. Of this fact the unwritten record of Glasgow affords substantial proof. The city indeed, within modern times, seems never to have been without makers of sweet or amusing song.1 i Glasgow itself has been a theme of poetic inspiration from a sufficiently early date. Before the year 597 St. Columba, the great missionary of the Hebrides, paid a visit to the aged St. Mungo at his cell on the bank of the Molendinar. In memory of their converse in that green and holy place, the two old men, it is said, exchanged their staves, and Columba composed a hymn. Of more recent date, but yet old enough, are the lines by John Barclay, minister of Cruden, printed in Skene's \"Succinct Survey of Aberdeen\" in 1685. They are interesting for the sake of comparison with descriptions of the city by such later poets as John Mayne, John Wilson, Alexander Smith, and Robert Buchanan. Glasgow, to thee thy neighb'ring towns give place. 'Bove them thou lifts thine head with comely grace. Scarce in the spacious earth can any see A city that's more beautiful than thee. Towards the setting sun thou'rt built, and finds The temperate breathings of the western winds. To thee the winter colds not hurtful are, Nor scorching heats of the Canicular. More pure than amber is the river Clyde, Whose gentle streams do by thy borders glide. And here a thousand sail receive commands To traffic for thee unto foreign lands. A bridge of polished stone doth here vouchsafe To travellers o'er Clyde a passage safe. Thine orchards full of fragrant fruits and buds Come nothing short of the Corcyran woods, INTRODUCTION 3 The roll of these makers opens with a picturesque figure. It was in the time of Charles I., and the poet was no less a personage than the minister of the Barony, the grim, perfervid, brave old Zachary Boyd. If proof were needed that the citizens of Glasgow have been by no means Gallios, caring for none of these things, it would be enough to recall the fact that the manuscript poems of \"Mr. Zachary\" have been carefully preserved in the University library for nigh two hundred and fifty years. And blushing roses grow into thy fields In no less plenty than sweet pasture yields. Thy pastures, flocks ; thy fertile ground, the corn ; Thy waters, fish ; thy fields the woods adorn. Thy buildings high and glorious are, yet be More fair within than they are outwardly. Thy houses by thy temples are outdone — Thy glitt'ring temples of the fairest stone. And yet the stones of them, however fair, The workmanship exceeds, which is more rare. Not far from thee the place of Justice stands, Where senators do sit and give commands. In midst of thee Apollo's court is placed, With the resort of all the Muses graced To citizens in the Minerva arts Mars valour, Juno stable wealth, imparts. That Neptune and Apollo did, rtis said, Troy's famed walls rear, and their foundations laid ; But thee, O Glasgow ! we may justly deem That all the gods who have been in esteem, Which in the earth and air and ocean are, Have joined to build with a propitious star. 4 THE GLASGOW POETS For a century after the time of Boyd there is no record of poetry in Glasgow. Doubtless, however, there were makers of song in the city to keep company with poets like Hamilton of Gilbertfield in the neighbourhood, and Allan Ramsay's nest of singing-birds in the capital. At any rate we know that the instinct for melody was by no means absent. Stenhouse, in his notes to Johnson's \" Museum,\" puts it on- record that the lively air of \" Duncan Gray \" was composed by a carter or carman of that name in Glasgow about the beginning of the eighteenth century, and that the tune was taken down from his whistling it two or three times to a musician in the city. Towards the middle of the same century even the Glasgow bellman, Dougal Graham, had caught the poetic infection, and in his own rude fashion sang the city and its ways. And from that day to the present the record remains of an unbroken train of singers. The marvel is that for so long a time the claim of St. Mungo's city to be an alma mater of poets has not been fairly recognised. In this respect justice has hardly been done to the city by the trumpet of fame. In the many descriptions of Glasgow it seems to have been the last thing dreamt of to consider the town as a place of inspiration for poets. As a matter of fact, nevertheless, no town in Scotland, INTRODUCTION 5 excepting perhaps Edinburgh itself, can boast so long and illustrious a roll of \" makers.\" For a century and a half the Glasgow poets have poured forth a stream of minstrelsy, gay with humour, tender with pathos, fierce with invective, riotous with mirth — as rich as it is varied, and as brilliant as it is full of character and is sincere. Each of the long train has given his share — some song, at least, that cannot be forgotten — to enrich the nation's treasury. The birthplace of Campbell and Motherwell and Henry Glassford Bell, and the home of John Mayne and James Grahame, Alexander Rodger and George Outram, William Miller, Alexander Smith, and David Gray, with some two -score other singers of note, Glasgow has no need to solicit respect for her tale of poetic achievement. Three collections of poetry, mostly native to the city, have been made in Glasgow. Between the years 1795 and 1798 the bookseller -poets, Brash & Reid, issued from their shop in Trongate, in a series of penny numbers, a collection entitled \" Poetry, Original and Selected.\" Some of the pieces are signed, and the authorship of others is easily identified, but many, after every effort, remain anonymous. The collection, when completed, made four small volumes, which stand among the prizes of the book-collector. In 1832, again, was published 6 THE GLASGOW POETS the first of four series of the delightful and enter- taining \" Whistle-binkie.\" It was edited and partly contributed by John Donald Carrick, and was published by David Robertson from his shop at the foot of Glassford Street. The snuggery behind that shop was a literary howfF of much the same character as Allan Ramsay's in Edinburgh a century before ; and \" Whistle-binkie \" took shape there in much the same way as the \" Tea-Table Miscellany \" took shape in the Edinburgh resort. Its chief con- tributor and subsequent editor was Alexander Rodger, but it contained some of the best pieces of William Motherwell, William Miller, and other kindred spirits. The contributions were by no means exclusively drawn from Glasgow, but the work of the writers mentioned gave the characteristic tone to the pro- duction — a ring of homely tenderness, shrewd wisdom, and pawky humour, which was as dis- tinct as it was irresistible. \"Whistle-binkie\" keeps its place as a quaint classic, and of itself, though it stood alone, would bespeak Glasgow a city of poetic memories. At half a century's later date came the volumes of the Glasgow Ballad Club. For a prototype to this club, if it had a prototype, it is necessary to go back to that Easy Club of the early years of the eighteenth century, at which the author of \"The INTRODUCTION 7 Gentle Shepherd \" and the other \" ingenious gentle- men \" of his coterie recited their own verses, sang their own songs, and in other characteristic ways sped the jovial hours.1 Founded in 1876 by Mr. William Freeland, the Ballad Club, during the twenty-five years of its existence, has counted among its members most of the men of poetic gift in the city and its neighbourhood. Of the compositions read before the club two volumes have been pub- lished, under the title of \"Ballads and Poems,\" in 1885 and 1898 respectively. The contents of these remain as various as the professions of their authors, but between the boards are poems — satires, songs, and narrative pieces, light vers de socitt^ kindly conceits, and impressions of country and town — enough to, at least, maintain the poetic tradition of the city. So, it will be seen, Glasgow has had her guilds of \"makers\" no less than of other crafts. The tale of her poetic production is both ancient and i Count is not taken here of the Anderston Social Club of Glasgow, which, in the years before Waterloo, had among its members such poets as William Glen and Alexander Macalpine, author of the once famous \"Mail -Coach.\" This and other convivial coteries of that time, described in Dr. Strang's delightful book, \"Glasgow and its Clubs,\" enjoyed, and even kept record of, the original lyrics sung by their members, but they were not literary clubs in the first sense of the term. 8 THE GLASGOW POETS honourable. And of her sons of song, the long roll is not yet at an end.1 TAs a pledge that the inspiration of St. Mungo's city has by no means become exhausted, it may be allowable to quote some lines of the very beautiful poem written by Mr. William Canton on occasion of the centenary of the Glasgoiv Herald 'vn. February, 1882: — A hundred years ago ! As in a dream, All things have changed along the human stream. The thousand roaring wheels of traffic pass Where the maids spread the linen on the grass ; The mighty ocean liners outward bound Heave o'er the spot where windmill wheels went round. The haystacks of the Trongate, where are they ? Where the green meadows which produced the hay ? Who were the last vain lovers (who can tell ? ) That gazed beneath the alders at Arn's Well ? Oh ! quaint arcadian city which appears In the bright vista of a hundred years ! The ancient merchant in his scarlet cloak, Grey wig and silver buckles, if he woke From his archaic slumber, would he know Th' Havannah of a century ago ? In that brave year of seventeen eighty-two The stars looked out of smokeless heavens and knew The city by its nine dim lamps. At dawn The glimmering vapours from the bens were drawn, And Lomond with a cheery face looked down Through the clear morning on the thriving town. ZACHARY BOYD No name is better remembered in the annals of bygone Glasgow than that of Zachary Boyd. Traits of his character and tales of his deeds and sayings have been handed down by tradition, and, along with his manuscripts, the University has preserved his portrait and his bust. Though no longer a force in the world of letters, he was a force in the pulpit in his day. In spirit, no less than in appearance, he presented a striking likeness to John Knox, and of the strenuous Presbyterian ministers of his time — the time of Charles I. and Cromwell— he re- mains an outstanding type. Descended from the Boyds of Pinkill in Carrick, a branch of the noble house of Kilmarnock, he was born, probably at Kilmarnock, in 1585. He studied at Glasgow University, took his degree at St. Andrews, and when twenty-two years of age passed to the University of Saumur in France. Of that University he was made a regent in 1611, and afterwards refused the principalship. For four years, also, he was minister of a French Protestant church. In 1623 he returned to Scot- land, and after a few months was appointed minister of the Barony, or landward parish of Glasgow, a charge in which he remained for thirty years. It was a troublous period in Church and State, and twice Boyd came into conspicuous contact with the rulers of his time. On I7th June, 1633, the day after the Scottish coronation of Charles I., the minister of the Barony met the king in the porch of Holyrood, and addressed to him a Latin panegyric. Alas for that praise ! Charles before long was pushing prelacy on Scotland, and the name of his panegyrist was signed to the covenant of resistance. And later, in 1640, when the royal army was defeated at Newburn, Boyd wrote a curious poem on the subject, stigmatising as a \"beastly fool\" every one who drew a sword for the cause of the king. The second incident occurred in 1650, io THE GLASGOW POETS Cromwell had defeated Charles II. and the Presbyterian army at Dunbar, and on his progress through the country had come to Glasgow. On Sunday, I3th October, he attended the Cathedral instate. Zachary Boyd was the only one of the magistrates and ministers who had been brave enough to remain in town, and he took occasion in his sermon to rail fiercely against the \" Malignants,\" as Cromwell and his Indepen- dents were called by the Presbyterian party. Secretary Thurlow, it is reported, more than once whispered to Cromwell for leave to \" pistol the scoundrel.\" \"No, no,\" was the General's answer, \"we will manage him in another way.\" \" He therefore asked the minister to dine with him, and concluded the entertainment with prayer, which lasted for three hours, even until three in the morning. \" Boyd, nevertheless, seems to have taken no active part in the politics of the day. His life was almost entirely that of a preacher and writer. Probably it was during his residence in France that he produced his best poetical work, \" Zion's Flowers,\" most of which remains still in manuscript. The popular tradition ran that this was a rendering of all the sacred scriptures into verse — \"Zachary Boyd's Bible.\" His work, however, was confined to a series of twenty-three episodes, such as \" The Historic of Jonah \" and \" The Tyrannic of Pharaoh.\" Selections from the \"Flowers\" were edited by Gabriel Neil, and published in 1831 and 1855. The other work on which the fabric of his fame must rest is written in prose. The strange occasion of the production of this work, ' ' The Last Battle of the Soul in Death,\" is told by Boyd himself. In 1626 he had been sick to death of fever, and on his recovery found in his study, among his books, the winding-sheet which had been made ready for his corpse. This startling discovery set him to describe, for the good of others, the soul's struggle with its last enemies. The book was addressed, in English, Latin, and French, to Charles I. and his queen, and printed at Edinburgh in two parts by the heirs of Andro Hart in 1629. A new edition, edited by Gabriel Neil, was printed at Glasgow in 1831. Boyd's chief published works, besides these, were \"The Battle of Newburn,\" reprinted in Laing's \" Fugitive Scottish Poetry of the Seventeenth Cen- tury\"; \"Four Letters of Comforts on the Deaths of Lord Haddington and Lord Boyd,\" 1640, reprinted in 1878 ; \" The Garden of Zion,\" a series of poems on Biblical subjects in 1644; and his metrical version of the Psalms, which reached a third edition in 1646. Glasgow University, ZACHARY BOYD n however, has 26,000 lines of his works in MS., a list of the contents of which was given by Gabriel Neil in an appendix in 1831. Not the least interesting feature of Boyd's life was his connection with Glasgow University. He was thrice elected Dean of Faculty, thrice Rector, and thrice on the Assembly's commissions of visitation. He was also Vice- Chancellor from about 1644 ; and at his death he left to the College a large sum of money, some ,£20,000 Scots, with his books and MSS. His injunction to the University authorities, never- theless, to print his manuscripts, has never been carried out. He was married, first to Elizabeth Fleming, who died in 1636, and afterwards to Margaret Mure, a daughter of Mure of Glanderstone. From certain bitter remarks on women in his writings it has been supposed the latter union was unhappy. But his extant references to his \"loving spouse\" are kind and tender, and he provided for her generously in his will. She was, however, much younger than himself, and there is a story about her which may stand for what it is worth. When he was drawing up his \"Last Testament,\" the tradition runs, she ventured to suggest that he should leave something to Mr. Durham, minister of the Inner High Church. Zachary's answer was character- istic : \"I'll leave him naething,\" he said, \"but what I canna keep frae him, and that's your bonnie sel'. \" And, as if to corroborate his surmises, eight months after Boyd's death she married Mr. Durham. An early memoir of Zachary Boyd appeared in the \" Christian Instructor,\" and full accounts of his career are furnished in the intro- ductions of his editor, Gabriel Neil. As a prose writer he was among the clearest and most forcible of his age in Scotland. He was one of the earliest Scottish authors to express himself in Southern English, yet his style would do no discredit to the best writers of the present day. The opening sentences in \"The Last Battle\" give a fair idea of that style : — \" My Bodie is sicke, my Soule is wounded. God's wrath is fearefull ; it burneth to the bottom of Hell. The heate thereof already maketh my Soule to sweate. I can find no Skrine or Sconce to set between mee and this fire.\" As a poet, on the other hand, it must be admitted that he is entitled to no very lofty place. His muse is apt to walk when it should soar. Some of his anachronisms, too, are not a little amusing ; as when he makes the daughter of Herodias dance a strathspey, and Joseph reason with Potiphar's wife in the words of the New Testament. Injustice, 12 THE GLASGOW POETS however, has been done to his reputation by the quoting of nondescript burlesque verses of other derivation as \"from Zachary Boyd's Bible.\" It is certain he did not succeed in his great object — the object of all the Reformers from John Knox to his own time — to substitute Biblical subjects for the popular \"fables, love-songs, ballads, Heathen husks, youth's poyson,\" in the mouths of young men and maidens. Yet it is impossible not to respect the earnest spirit shining behind the verse ; and as a homely and didactic poet he is entitled to his place. By far his finest piece is \"Joseph Tempted by Potiphar's Wife.\" The subject is a delicate one, but it is managed with no little skill and dramatic instinct, fine images and descriptions are scattered through its lines, and again and again the verse rises to a note of real passion. Though not to be compared with those other \"Flowers of Zion\" of Boyd's con- temporary, Drummond of Hawthornden, this piece, at least, of the Glasgow poet's composition cannot be passed by. JOSEPH TEMPTED (From \"Zion's Flowers\") Potiphar's Wife.— My heart is like a spider who, confined In her web's centre, hurried with each wind, Moves in a trice if that a buzzing fly Stir but a string of her thin canopy. I cannot tell what thing is this I find Both night and day still stirring in my mind. This youth new come, he hath a lovely face, Whate'er he doth, it is adorned with grace. He ruddy lips hath, and a smiling eye, His comely cheeks are of a purer dye Than any rose, and, for mine eyes' delight, The other parts are like the lily, white. ZACHARY BOYD 13 I see in him, which well affirm I can, The rarest beauties that adorn a man. Him more than all I inly do admire, And do him still behold with young desire. I do not know what after shall ensue. If I this passion shall of love pursue Or not, I doubt. I know not what infection The tinder kindleth if this hot affection Which fires my mind and wak'neth my desire, So that my lust me setteth all on fire. Desist I would, for fear of world's shame ; Persist I must, though I should lose my name. Than death love's stronger, as we may perceive ; I'll rather die than want what love would have. I jewels have that are both rich and rare ; I will them have thick dangling on my hair. Pearls, rubies, and the topaz shall me deck, With sapphires hanged about my snowy neck. My gowns, pasmented with the richest gold, And dangling ribbons pleasant to behold, Shall give me lustre. When he hath me seen Deck'd like a lady, rather, like a queen, His lust will kindle, and him quickly move With such a beauty to be sick of love. Now I will send my Nurse to him, that he May in some chamber see me quietly Without a witness, for a place alone Is fitting most for such temptation. Ho, Nurse, see that in haste ye ready be That Hebrew youth cause quickly come to me ; i4 THE GLASGOW POETS For to my husband he must letters write, Some secret purpose which I shall indite. Tell ye him that I'm in the chamber here : Let no man know, but sound it in his ear. Nurse. — I go, madam, according to your will ; What ye require I shall the same fulfil. While ye were young, I on my breasts you fed, , And by the sleeves I here and there you led. I you a babe did dandle on my knee : My heart is glad when I your glory see. I'll say no more. In haste I'll go away. As ye have spoke I'll to the Hebrew say. Potiphar's Wife. — This my design requires great secrecy. My Nurse, I think, was fittest all to try. She trusty is, she no deceitful will Hath in her heart. She will not me beguile. I thought her fittest for to do this thing For me, her nursling, whom she up did bring. She is most faithful, diligent, and chary Her nursling's errands to and fro to carry. But what is this that in my breast I feel ? The thoughts of love still up and down do reel Within my heart. The pleasant comely face Of the Hebrew youth me grieves in every place. I'm sick of love. I have sure quaffed up The brim and bottom of some Stygian cup ZACHARY BOYD 15 Wherein some philtre kindled hath this fire That makes my flesh burn with such hot desire ! Nurse. — Sir, ye shall know, my mistress hath me sent To tell you that ye come incontinent To write some missives of great importance Unto her lord. She minds you to advance To higher honours, even to bear her cup. Some other things in heart she hoardeth up, As I perceive, which ye will better know When she herself will tell the same to you. She in her speeches still doth you commend. She is in grief if that your finger-end But ache a little. Thus ye clearly see How much to her ye now beholden be. Ye will be welcome when ye to her go : What needs me trumpet everything I know. Joseph. — I gladly hear what ye the Nurse do say. I am a servant, and I must obey. Most willingly I'll strive to do her pleasure ; I of her love deserve not such a measure. Yet shall I strive that all the house may see That I am upright, and no guile's in me. I for my master and my mistress ever Shall still be loyal, but a pilferer never. Nurse, tell the mistress when I this have done That's in my hand, I'll to her come anon. 16 THE GLASGOW POETS Nurse. — I see indeed those things most needful be. When ye have done see that ye follow me. Madam, as ye me to the Hebrew sent, At your command I went incontinent. As I perceived, my words did much him move When I him told of your respect and love. When he hath done some things that needful be He then anon will follow after me. A gallant youth he seems, as I have seen. As I esteem, he of some lord hath been The darling son • but beggars by the way Him far from doors have found and stolen away. PotiphaSs Wife.— Your thought is mine. Since first I saw his face And civil carriage als in every place, So mild, so meek, so humble, free of scorn, I could not think that he was basely born. Sith Providence hath brought him us unto, He shall well know that he hath not to do With churlish merchants who, which is a vice, Have no respect to persons, but to price. I hope one day, when he nothing shall want, He'll say our house yet never breathed scant. Since I was lady of this house so fair I never yet a servant had so rare. What say I ? Servant ! Service to despatch ! To any lady he might be a match ! I see no man that hath so comely face. Whate'er he doth it is adorned with grace. ZACHARY BOYD 17 Joseph. — Madam, ye know I use not to be slow. What I have done ye will it well allow When ye it see. As soon as it was done I came unto your ladyship anon. In everything as I shall understand I mind to do as ye shall me command Only and truly. It becomes me so, As ye direct, either to come or go. It's not for servants to be dainty, nice, And slow in pace, but in a twinkling trice To go to work, and that in every way, Ere crowing heralds summon up the day. I hope, madam, that ye will not refuse What I have said for a most just excuse. Potiphar's Wife. — While I him hear I wot not what a grace, What divine beam reflecteth on his face. If I no children had for to inherit, He might be heir of all I have by merit. If I were barren, as is many a one, He surely should be mine adopted son If Potiphar himself were in >his grave I surely should no other husband have, I may this think, but cannot speak the same ; It seemly is a wife be veiled in shame. Young man, to you my Nurse I quickly sent That you should come to me incontinent. i8 THE GLASGOW POETS I heard your reason, I will it allow : I by my Nurse each circumstance do know. Some secret things I must this day indite. Come to my cabin that ye may them write. I loved you aye, and yet I do not vary, Therefore I here you make my secretary. This place is quiet, far aback from din ; None will without hear what's here said within. This, this, and this my husband write unto ; As I indite you shall so write, and so. Joseph. — All is well written as I do suppose. Is it your will that I the letters close ? PotiphaSs Wife.— O that this youth did know my ladyship ! 0 that in love's cup he would once but sip, And after that, carousing, by and by Would all quaff off, and leave the goblet dry. His rosy lips most gladly would I kiss, But woman's shame restraineth me from this. 1 wonder, while such beauty here he sees, That I perceive not in his modest eyes Some sign of lust. If favour could him move He clearly sees great tokens of my love. If he would look and see me on each side, He would me see adorned like a bride. ZACHARY BOYD 19 I farded have my face with fard most rare ; To fire his eye my lily breast is bare : Pearls, rubies, and the topaz do me deck, With sapphires hanged about my snowy neck. My gowns pasmented are with richest gold, And dangling ribbons, pleasant to behold, Do give me lustre. He me thus hath seen Deck'd like a lady, rather, like a queen. Yet for all this, as I behold his eye I no appearance of his lust can see. It may be so that all he sees without Not shew my mind, and therefore doth he doubt If inly I him such affection bear ; Therefore, except he from my mouth it hear, He dare not well such matters now propound, Lest that he guilty should at last be found, If to my husband I should shew the same, And by this means that he should come to shame. I fain would speak, and tell him all my mind, How in mine eyes that he doth favour find ; But oh ! again I blush, I cannot speak ; It seems the man should from the woman seek. That man is doltish, and hath little skill, That cannot soon signs of a woman's will Read in her face, her gestures, and her eye. What shall I say ? For love I'm like to die. Ho youth, the missives as I do perceive Ye orderly them all now written have As I desire, therefore I shall allow None to write missives \\ I will have but you. 20 THE GLASGOW POETS See that the morrow ye go not from home : At afternoon unto my cabin come. Joseph. — I shall, madam, do as ye me command In everything that I do understand. What shall you please I mind it still to seek ; I wish I could do better than I speak. Now by your leave, madam, I must go hence T* o'ersee the servants, that with diligence They work ; for they need more a spur than bridle. It's sin and shame that servants should be idle. This woman's looks do lustful seem and vain. With such a one great danger's to remain. She's like a tinder-box to kindle fire, To waken lust and foolish youth's desire. It is my part at morn, and als at even, Yea at all times, to pray the God of Heaven Me to direct, that by her promises And beauty she gull not my simpleness. O Lord, thou know'st that I nothing can do But what thy Spirit enables me unto. And yet, while I such outward tokens find, It may be no such thing be in her mind. While we in cabin secret were together She not a word that wanton was did utter. Such is our nature and our frail condition That without ground we often have suspicion. They who in life are still most innocent Are least suspicious of an ill intent. ZACHARY BOYD 21 Yet when men see the ivy-bush hang out They know the change-house. So at least we doubt If such be chaste whom we always do see So vain, so wanton, with a rolling eye. PotiphaSs Wife.— I wot not what in me is come to pass — In me this whilom, who most gladly was Set to o'ersee my maids in business, And now I lusk in sloth and laziness. Love's working I not able am to stanch ; The fire is kindled which I cannot quench. This youth I so do carry in my mind That I no rest within my heart can find. It sucketh sorrow, and doth on it feed ; I dizzy am, as fed with darnel seed. I yesterday had time, but could not use it ; I thought it precious, but I feared t' abuse it. A woman's heart a thousand doubts doth frame — Whiles tossed with fear, and whiles als crossed with shame. So to attempt I durst not well be plain, But thought by pearls and smiles my point to gain. I see him coming as we left at last. The appointed hour it is not fully past. It gives me hope, sith that he keeps his hour, That yesternight of love he felt the power. A gallant lady with a smiling face, With speaking gestures in a secret place, 22 THE GLASGOW POETS May kindle fire within the chastest breast Both of the greatest and als of the least. Joseph. — I see yon woman in a rich attire ; To deck her thus her maid will surely tire. Whenas her lord did with her here remain She in apparel was not half so vain. I must go to her ; I it cannot shun. 0 Lord me save, and, as thou hast begun, Continue with me, that, unto the last, 1 both in heart and gestures may be chaste. PotiphaSs Wife.— Ho ! youth, come hither that I may indite Important missives which ye now must write To send abroad. Men must not idle stand In hulk at sea, or in an house on land. Lest time be spent before our turns are done, Let us both go into my cabin soon. Now doors are closed, my husband is afield, Sweet youth, I wish that ye to me would yield My earn'st desire. I hardly can it tell, But by my gestures ye may know it well. The matter's such it not conceal I can. Even ye yourself are now the only man Who can me comfort, pining thus away With thoughts of you by night and als by day. Ye know my meaning ; I it blush to tell, ZACHARY BOYD 23 But by my gestures ye may know it well. The doors are closed ; none's here but you and I ; Stol'ri water's sweet, as every one may try. Thousands of servants would this well approve That such a mistress would them dearly love. Joseph. — 0 God forbid ! God's eye, a shining taper, Sees all that's done. Your door's a sconce of paper, Will not us hide from his all-seeing eye. To him the darkness shineth like the sky. PotipUaSs Wife.— What can this be ? I whiles am in a flame, And whiles as with an ague chilled I am. My heart is swol'n with sighs and sorrows great : Both day and night my soul within doth fret. 1 wish, if I such follies could forbear, That I a dormouse were a thousand year, That I might sleep a sleep so uncontrolled, To shun the ill that waking I behold. What can this be ? The fire yet swiftly seeks To pass the paths and all the crooked creeks Within my heart. Love's passions are more eager, They on all sides this heart of mine beleaguer. Thoughts, as fell hornets from their drowsy nest, Come buzzing so within my troubled breast With risking train, that I must by and by, Stitch'd full of stings, with pain lie down and die — 24 THE GLASGOW POETS Yea, die for him whom I cannot attain, Who for my love still meets me with disdain. What ! Shall I die ? I him yet will assail, If that my card and compass do not fail. Now time is come. My heart it springs for haste, About his neck my milk-white arms to cast. I'll hold him, hug him, saying Welcome mine ! Dear mine thou art, and I am also thine ! Here's fair occasion ; why desire we thus To sport in love ? None is to hinder us. While we have time now let us do with speed. Lovers must dare, and for no dangers dread. Why burn we daylight ? We have time and place — My dearest Heart, now let me thee embrace ! Joseph. — Madam, madam ! now far misled ye are ! Think that ye are the wife of Potiphar. My noble lord, who doth us all command, He would not look to get this from your hand. Sith as ye hear the matter's so and so, Now loose your grips, and quickly let me go. If from you I this favour cannot find, I'll rather choose to leave my cloak behind. PotiphaSs Wife.— 0 dule, O dule ! Help, help ! O dule, O dule ! 1 am abused by a slave — a fool ! Is none here near to hear my shrillest cry ? ZACHARY BOYD 25 I blush to tell what he hath done. Fy, fy ! Ho servants, hear ! come to my help anon. Or with a slave I'll surely be undone. Nurse. — What now, madam ? What is't that ails you there ? What is't that hath dishevelled all your hair ? Potiphar's Wife.— My nurse, my nurse ! this base and beggar loon Hath throttled me, and also cast me down. I'm shamed for aye, though no more were than this— Ere even I wist, this slave my mouth did kiss. He crafty came to me in stealing way, When I was sleeping in the canopy. I blush for shame to tell it — O the slave ! The Jew, the rascal, the base Hebrew knave, The vilest villain that hath ever been Within my doors ! Where hath the like been seen Or heard of ever ? that a basest slave Durst but a kiss of his own lady crave. This day I have received such disgrace That I for shame cannot lift up my face. TOBIAS SMOLLETT 1721-1771 IN the latter half of the eighteenth century there was a well-known physician in Glasgow named Dr. Gordon.1 When talk turned upon the latest quarrel engaged in by a certain novelist of the time, as it was apt to do in his company, he never failed to put in a fair word for the delinquent. With a smile of reminiscence, as he helped himself to a pinch of snuff, he would say \" Gie me my ain bubbly-nosed callant, wi' a stane in his pouch.\" For Tobias George Smollett had once been an apprentice in the shop of Mr. John Gordon, surgeon and apothecary. One incident of the \"callant's\" early days in that surgeon's shop has been remembered. It was a winter morning, and a snow battle was going on among the boys outside, when the stout little surgeon came in. A certain prescription was not ready, and the shopman excused the delay by explaining that he had been hit by a snowball from the street, and had run after his assailant. \"A likely story!\" answered the surgeon. \" I am sure I might stand here long enough before any boy would fling a ball at me.\" He had no sooner said the words, however, than a snowball from the door corner hit him straight in the face. The boy Smollett had been within earshot, and the psychological moment had proved too much for him. This was Smollett's failing throughout life. He could never resist the telling moment for attack, and in consequence, to his last day he was rarely without a quarrel on hand with one person or another. Son of a younger son of Sir James Smollett of Bonhill, the poet- novelist was born at Dalquhurn, near Renton, in what is still, notwith- 1 In his later days Gordon assumed as a partner Dr. John Moore, author of the novel \" Zeluco,\" and father of the future hero of Corunna. TOBIAS SMOLLETT 27 standing its smoky chimney-stacks, the beautiful Vale of Leven.1 The mother, early left a widow, supported herself by farming, and the boy got his schooling in Dunbarton, a mile or two away. A little later he became the surgeon's apprentice in Glasgow, and attended the College there. But the example of Thomson and Mallet, Scotsmen who had lately found fame in London, had fired his fancy, and in 1738, throwing down pestle and spatula, he set off for the south. He did the journey partly on foot, partly on packhorse and carrier's waggon, and, like Samuel Johnson, who had reached the city in the previous year, he carried a tragedy in his pocket. Alas ! this tragedy, \" The Regicide,\" on the assassination of James I. at Perth, failed to get a hearing, and its author was glad presently to sail as surgeon's mate on the \" Cumber- land,\" 8o-gun ship of war. In this position he served for three years, and was present at the futile siege of Carthagena. Then, during some stay in Jamaica, he met a planter's daughter, Miss Anne Lascelles, who afterwards became his wife. In 1744 Smollett returned to London and set up as a doctor in Downing Street. But patients were few, and the Scotsman was not complaisant. \" If you have time to play at being ill,\" he said to one invalid, \" I have no leisure to play at curing you. \" At the same time he had not for- gotten his poetic hopes. It was in 1746, when London was jubilant with the news of Culloden ; the tales of \"Butcher\" Cumberland's atrocities among the Highland glens stirred him to wrath, and he wrote \" The Tears of Scotland.\" It is said that when he read the six original stanzas in a coffee-house, one of the company pointed out the danger the author ran of giving offence to the Government. By way of reply Smollett took his poem to a side table, and added a seventh stanza more biting in its invective than all the others together. Next year he married Miss Lascelles, and in 1748 published 1 1 am indebted to Captain Telfer Smollett of Bonhill for the information that the exact spot of the poet's birth was a knoll at the back of the Volunteer Drill Hall in Renton, and exactly opposite Dalquhurn works gate. The house is shown in an oil painting preserved by the family. It has long been demolished, but some of its stones are built into the garden wall of the neighbouring Place of Bonhill. A local tradition declares that Smollett's mother was seized with the pains of labour while sitting at the foot of a tree which overhung the road at hand till last year. Some say the child was actually born out of doors, others that the mother had time to get into the house. 28 THE GLASGOW POETS \" Roderick Random,\" which at once gave him a place beside Richard- son and Fielding among the creators of the modern novel. Full of adventure, bustle, and broad humour, it detailed a good deal of his own experience, and included an account of the attempt on Carthagena. His next book, \" Peregrine Pickle,\" included the notorious \"Memoirs of a Lady of Quality,\" said to have been furnished him by their subject herself, the frail, beautiful Frances Hawes, Lady Vane. Smollett was now a great author, and the loss of most of his wife's fortune of ^\"300 a year forced him to turn his reputation to account. Among other work for the booksellers he put his name to translations of \" Gil Bias \" and of \" Don Quixote,\" a \" Compendium of Voyages,\" and a \"Universal History.\" He became editor of \"The Critical Review,\" and supported Lord Bute with a weekly paper, \"The Briton.\" At the same time, in his house at Chelsea he entertained lavishly on week-days most of the men of letters of the time, and on Sundays the less fortunate brothers of the pen for whom he found work at opportunity. In 1755 he paid a visit to Scotland. His mother was living with her son-in-law, Mr. Telfer of Scotstoun, in Peeblesshire, and the dignified, handsome visitor had himself introduced to her as \"a gentleman from the West Indies.\" For a time, while he continued to frown, the deception succeeded ; but as Mrs. Smollett kept looking fixedly at him the attempt broke down, and in a moment his mother's arms were about his neck. \"My son, my son!\" she cried, \"that auld kent smile o' yours has betrayed ye ! \" At the same time he visited Glasgow and his birthplace in the Vale of Leven. Next year he undertook a complete \"History of England,\" and finished it amid great eclat in fourteen months. And in 1757, Garrick, forgiving him his sarcasms, produced \"The Reprisals, or the Tars of Old England,\" a play which remained a never-failing stock piece for a century. Meanwhile his quarrels had been growing more serious, and for a libel on Admiral Knowles, which he avowed in the \" Critical Review,\" he was fined .£100, and spent three months in prison. A worse blow, however, fell upon him in the death of his only daughter at the age of fifteen. From this shock Smollett never fully recovered. He went abroad, and as the fruit of two years' sojourn he wrote \" Travels through France and Italy,\" for the petulance of which he was satirized as \"Smelfungus\" by Sterne in the \"Sentimental Journey.\" TOBIAS SMOLLETT 29 But grief, the strain of constant toil, and the bitterness of controversy were wearing him down, and when he took his blue-eyed Creole wife to Scotland and Glasgow in 1766 he was a dying man. The old humour, nevertheless, was yet to flash forth its best. \" The Adventures of Count Fathom \" had appeared in 1752, and \" Sir Lancelot Greaves,\" earliest of serial novels, in the \" British Magazine,\" of which he was editor, in 1758. But it was in 1770, at the little village of Monte Nuova, near Leghorn, whither he had gone as a last resort, that the wearied man wrote his brightest and most racy book, \"Humphrey Clinker.\" At Leghorn itself in the following year he died. It is as a novelist that Smollett is most remembered. His tales, for amusing delineation of the stronger humours and absurdities of character, occupy a place by themselves, and preserve a full-coloured picture of the manners and morals, or lack of them, in that hard-drink- ing time. His few poems, nevertheless, remain most notable achievements, and in them, and not in the novels, it is worthy of remark, the real character of Smollett — proud, hot-hearted, and generous — is to be found. His longest pieces, the satires \" Advice \" and \" Reproof,\" are not his best. Fiercely scathing in their time, they are mostly pointless now, since their allusions are out of date. His few \" songs,\" again, run mostly in the affected fashion of that day. His memory as a poet, therefore, depends on some three or four pieces. THE TEARS OF SCOTLAND Mourn, hapless Caledonia ! mourn Thy banished peace, thy laurels torn ! Thy sons, for valour long renowned, Lie slaughtered on their native ground ; Thy hospitable roofs no more Invite the stranger to the door ; In smoky ruins sunk they lie, The monuments of cruelty. 30 THE GLASGOW POETS The wretched owner sees afar His all become the prey of war ; Bethinks him of his babes and wife, Then smites his breast, and curses life. Thy swains are famished on the rocks Where once they fed their wanton flocks ; Thy ravished virgins shriek in vain ; Thy infants perish on the plain. What boots it then, in every clime, Through the wide-spreading waste of time, Thy martial glory, crowned with praise, Still shone with undiminished blaze ? Thy towering spirit now is broke, Thy neck is bended to the yoke. What foreign arms could never quell By civil rage and rancour fell. The rural pipe and merry lay No more shall cheer the happy day : No social scenes of gay delight Beguile the dreary winter night ; No strains but those of sorrow flow, And nought be heard but sounds of woe ; While the pale phantoms of the slain Glide nightly o'er the silent plain. Oh, baneful cause ! oh, fatal morn, Accursed to ages yet unborn ! The sons against their father stood, The parent shed his children's blood. TOBIAS SMOLLETT 31 Yet when the rage of battle ceased, The victor's soul was not appeased ; The naked and forlorn must feel Devouring flames and murdering steel ! The pious mother, doomed to death, Forsaken wanders o'er the heath ; The bleak wind whistles round her head ; Her helpless orphans cry for bread. Bereft of shelter, food, and friend, She views the shades of night descend, And, stretched beneath the inclement skies, Weeps o'er her tender babes, and dies. While the warm blood bedews my veins, And unimpaired remembrance reigns, Resentment of my country's fate Within my filial breast shall beat, And, spite of her insulting foe, My sympathising verse shall flow. Mourn, hapless Caledonia, mourn Thy banished peace, thy laurels torn ! ODE TO LEVEN WATER On Leven's banks, while free to rove And tune the rural pipe to love, I envied not the happiest swain That ever trod the Arcadian plain. Pure stream, in whose transparent wave 32 THE GLASGOW POETS My youthful limbs I wont to lave, No torrents stain thy limpid source, No rocks impede thy dimpling course, That warbles sweetly o'er its bed, With white, round, polished pebbles spread, While, lightly poised, the scaly brood In myriads cleave thy crystal flood — The springing trout, in speckled pride, The salmon, monarch of the tide, The ruthless pike, intent on war, The silver eel and mottled par. Devolving from thy parent lake, A charming maze thy waters make , By bowers of birch and groves of pine And edges flowered with eglantine. Still on thy banks, so gaily green, May numerous herds and flocks be seen, And lasses, chanting o'er the pail, And shepherds, piping in the dale, And ancient faith, that knows no guile, And industry, embrowned with toil, And hearts resolved, and hands prepared The blessings they enjoy to guard ! ODE TO INDEPENDENCE Thy spirit, Independence ! let me share, Lord of the lion heart and eagle eye ! Thy steps I follow with my bosom bare, Nor heed the storm that howls along the sky. TOBIAS SMOLLETT 33 Deep in the frozen regions of the north A goddess violated brought thee forth, Immortal Liberty ! whose look sublime Hath bleached the tyrant's cheek in every varying clime. What time the iron-hearted Gaul, With frantic superstition for his guide, Armed with the dagger and the pall, The sons of Woden to the field defied, The ruthless hag, by Weser's flood In Heaven's name urged the infernal blow, And red the stream began to flow : The vanquished were baptised with blood.1 The Saxon prince in horror fled From altars stained with human gore, And Liberty his routed legions led In safety to the bleak Norwegian shore. There in a cave asleep she lay, Lulled by the hoarse resounding main, When a bold savage passed that way, Impelled by destiny, his name Disdain. Of ample front the portly chief appeared ; The hunted boar supplied a shaggy vest, The drifted snow hung on his yellow beard, And his broad shoulders braved the furious blast. He stopped, he gazed, his bosom glowed, And deeply felt the impression of her charms. He seized the advantage Fate allowed And straight compressed her in his vigorous arms. 1 Charlemagne, having forced 4000 Saxon prisoners to undergo Christian baptism, ordered their throats to be cut. D 34 THE GLASGOW POETS The curlew screamed, the Tritons blew Their shells to celebrate the ravished rite. Old Time exulted as he flew, And Independence saw the light. The light he saw in Albion's happy plains, Where, under cover of a flowering thorn, While Philomel renewed her warbled strains, The auspicious fruit of stolen embrace was born. The mountain Dryads seized with joy The smiling infant to their charge consigned ; The Doric Muse caressed the favourite boy ; The hermit, Wisdom, stored his opening mind. As rolling years matured his age He flourished bold and sinewy as his sire, While the mild passions in his breast assuage The fiercer flames of his maternal fire. Accomplished thus he winged his way, And zealous roved from pole to pole, The rolls of right eternal to display, And warm with patriot thoughts the aspiring soul. On desert isles 'twas he that raised Those spires that gild the Adriatic wave,1 Where tyranny beheld, amazed, Fair Freedom's temple where he marked her grave. He steeled the blunt Batavian's arms To burst the Iberian's double chain ; And cities reared, and planted farms Won from the skirts of Neptune's wide domain.2 Venice. 2 The Netherlands. TOBIAS SMOLLETT 35 He with the generous rustics sate On Uri's rocks in close divan, And winged that arrow, sure as fate, Which ascertained the sacred rights of man.1 Arabia's scorching sands he crossed, Where blasted Nature pants supine, Conductor of her tribes adust To Freedom's adamantine shrine. And many a Tartar horde forlorn, aghast, He snatched from under fell Oppression's wing, And taught, amidst the dreary waste, The all-cheering hymns of liberty to sing. He virtue finds, like precious ore, Diffused through every baser mould. Even now he stands on Calvi's rocky shore And turns the dross of Corsica to gold.2 He, guardian genius ! taught my youth Pomp's tinsel livery to despise — My lips, by him chastised to truth, Ne'er paid that homage which my heart denies. Those sculptured halls my feet shall never tread Where varnished Vice and Vanity, combined To dazzle and seduce, their banners spread, And forge vile shackles for the free-born mind, While Insolence his wrinkled front uprears, And all the flowers of spurious Fancy blow, 1 The arrow of William Tell. 2 The reference is to the stand made by Paschal Paoli against the aggressions of the French. 36 THE GLASGOW POETS And Title his ill-woven chaplet wears, Full often wreathed around the miscreant's brow ; Where ever-dimpling Falsehood, pert and vain, Presents her cup of stale Profession's froth, And pale Disease, with all his bloated train, Torments the sons of gluttony and sloth. In Fortune's car behold that minion ride, With either India's glittering spoils oppressed. So moves the sumpter-mule in harnessed pride, That bears the treasure which he cannot taste. For him let venal bards disgrace the bay, And hireling minstrels wake the tinkling string, Her sensual snares let faithless Pleasure lay, And jingling bells fantastic Folly ring. Disquiet, doubt, and dread shall intervene, And Nature, still to all her feelings just, In vengeance hang a damp on every scene, Shook from the baneful pinions of Disgust. Nature I'll court in her sequestered haunts By mountain, meadow, streamlet, grove, or cell, Where the poised lark his evening ditty chaunts, And Health and Peace and Contemplation dwell. There Study shall with Solitude recline, And Friendship pledge me to his fellow swains, And Toil and Temperance sedately twine The slender cord that fluttering life sustains ; And fearless Poverty shall guard the door, And Taste unspoiled the frugal table spread, And Industry supply the humble store, TOBIAS SMOLLETT 37 And Sleep unbribed his dews refreshing shed. White-mantled Innocence, ethereal sprite ! Shall chase far off the goblins of the night, And Independence o'er the day preside — Propitious Power ! my patron and my pride. THY FATAL SHAFTS Thy fatal shafts unerring move ; I bow before thine altar, Love ! I feel thy soft resistless flame Glide swift through all my vital frame. For while I gaze my bosom glows, My blood in tides impetuous flows ; Hope, fear, and joy alternate roll, And floods of transport whelm my soul. My faltering tongue attempts in vain In soothing murmurs to complain ; My tongue some secret magic ties — My murmurs sink in broken sighs. Condemned to nurse eternal care, And ever drop the silent tear, Unheard I mourn, unknown I sigh, Unfriended live, unpitied die. DOUGAL GRAHAM 1724-1779 A COMPENDIUM of the Glasgow poets could not be considered complete without some mention at least of the famous Skellat Bellman. Born of humble parents in the village of Raploch, near Stirling, he was deformed in person, and of the scantiest education ; yet his native wit made him a marked figure in his day in Glasgow; he composed a metrical account of \" the '45 \" which, though not indeed to be ranked as fine poetry, possesses not a little of the merit of the early chronicles ; and his chapbooks remain among the most famous and entertaining of their class of literature. For a time Dougal was servant to a small farmer near Campsie ; but the wandering spirit was in his blood; like his own John Cheap he became a pedlar, and for some years plied his craft throughout the country. When the Rebellion of 1745 broke out, and the Jacobite army marched south, the pedlar seized his chance, joined the High- landers as they crossed the Fords of Frew, and followed the fortunes of the Chevalier till they finally broke at Culloden. The probability is that Graham was not a soldier but a sutler. Nevertheless he saw the whole campaign, and no sooner was it over than he proceeded with no little ingenuity to turn it to account. In five months he had written and published at Glasgow his rhymed \"History of the Rebellion.\" The book was at once popular, and eight editions appeared before 1809. Settling in Glasgow Graham apparently became the rhyming chronicler of passing events, issuing his broadsides in rhyme and prose under the name of \"John Faikirk,\" the \"Scots Piper,\" and the like. At the same time he still carried on his business of pedlar, or ' ' merchant ; \" is said by M'Ure to have become a printer and set up his own works as he composed them at the press; and latterly filled the post of DOUGAL GRAHAM 39 bellman to the city. In this last character his ready wit was as con- spicuous as his rhyming faculty. At every corner where he rang his bell a crowd of boys gathered to hear his rhyming tags, and woe to the wight who tried to \" take him off.\" \" The story goes,\" says his editor, \" that Dougal was on one occasion passing along the Gallowgate making some intimation or other. Several officers of the 42nd High- landers, then returned from the American War of Independence, where their regiment had been severely handled by the colonists, were dining in the Saracen's Head Inn. They knew Dougal of old, and they thought to have a joke at his expense. One of them put his head out of the window, and called to the bellman — ' What's that you've got on your back, Dougal ? ' This was rather a personal reference, for Dougal had the misfortune to be ' humphie backit.' But he was not put out by the question, for he at once silenced his interrogator by answering — ' It's Bunker's Hill ; do you choose to mount ? ' \" Such stories were once common tradition regarding him. Dr. Strang, in \" Glasgow and its Clubs,\" thus describes Graham — \" Only fancy a little man, scarcely five feet in height, with a Punch-like nose, with a hump on his back, a protuberance on his chest, and a halt in his gait, donned in a long, scarlet coat nearly reaching the ground, blue breeches, white stockings, shoes with large buckles, and a cocked hat perched on his head, and you have before you the comic author, the witty bellman, the Rabelais of Scottish ploughmen, herds, and handi- craftsmen.\" Caldwell, his publisher, said \"he could screed aff a bit penny history in less than nae time. A' his warks took weel — they were level to the meanest capacity, and had plenty o' coarse jokes to season them.\" A just criticism of Graham's \"History\" is that of Robert Chambers in his \"Illustrious Scotsmen\" — \"The poetry is, of course, in some cases, a little grotesque, but the matter of the work is in many instances valuable. It contains, and in this consists the chief value of all such productions, many minute facts which a work of more pretension would not admit.\" Graham's other short pieces run in the same vein of humour. \"John Highlandman's Remarks on Glasgow\" furnish a curious picture of the city in the middle of the eighteenth century. \"Tugal M 'Tagger\" is a satire of no little shrewdness, and \"Haud awa' frae me, Donald,\" attributed to Graham by Stenhouse in his \" Lyric Poetry and Music of Scotland,\" remains a classic of its kind. Burns admired \"The Turnimspike\" on account of its local 40 THE GLASGOW POETS humour, and Sir Walter Scott declared that piece alone enough to entitle its author to immortality. The collected writings of Dougal Graham, with a memoir and notes, were edited by Mr. George MacGregor and published at Glasgow in two volumes in 1883.

For a' the houses that be tere Was theekit wi' blue stanes, And a stane ladder to gang up, No fa' to break her banes.

He had a staff into his hand To fight me an he could, But hersel be rin awa' frae him ; His horse be unco proud. But I be rin around about, And stand upon the guard,2 Where I see the deil chap the hours ; 3 Tan me grew unco feared. * The statue of King William III., set up at Glasgow Cross, was cast in classic dress, including sandals. 2 The Guardhouse, at foot of Candleriggs. 3 A clockmaker had in his window a time-piece in which Satan was seen striking the hours. 44 THE GLASGOW POETS Ohon ! ohon ! her nainsel said, And where will me go rin ?

ROBERT COUPER 1750-1818 SON of a Wigtownshire farmer, Robert Couper was born at Balsier, in the parish of Sorbie. He entered Glasgow University in 1769, and studied at first for the Church of Scotland. On the death of his parents, however, he was forced to go as tutor to a family in Virginia, and proposed to take orders in the Episcopal Church. This intention also was baulked. The outbreak of the American War of Independence in 1776 sent him back to Glasgow. Returning to the old University in High Street, he studied medicine, and qualified as a surgeon. For a time he practised at Newton- Stewart in his native county, but on the recommendation of Dr. Hamilton, professor of midwifery, was appointed physician to the Duke of Gordon, and settled at Fochabers in 1788. At the same time he took the degree of M.D. at Glasgow, \"to prevent people, no wiser than himself, from dictating to him,\" and married Miss Stott, daughter of the minister of Minnigaff, Kirkcudbrightshire. He left Fochabers in 1806, and died at Wigtown twelve years later. He was the author of two volumes of \"Poetry, chiefly in the Scottish Language,\" published at Inverness in 1804. His best-known song, \"Kinrara,\" or \"Red gleams the sun,\" refers to Kinrara Lodge, the summer residence of the Duchess of Gordon. Another, \"Red, red is the path to glory,\" was written in 1799 at the desire of Lady Georgiana Gordon (afterwards Duchess of Bedford), regarding her brother, the Marquis of Huntly, then with his regiment in Holland. A few days after the writing of it news arrived that the Marquis was wounded. The song was set to a beautiful air, \"Stu mo run,\" picked up by Lady Georgiana in the Highlands. A manuscript Life of Dr. Couper existed, from which most of the above particulars were contributed to the \"Additional Illustrations\" for Johnson's \"Scots Musical Museum.\" 48 THE GLASGOW POETS RED GLEAMS THE SUN Red gleams the sun on yon hill-tap, The dew sits on the gowan, Deep murmurs through her glens the Spey, Around Kinrara rowin'. Where art thou, fairest, kindest lass ? Alas ! wert thou but near me, Thy gentle soul, thy melting eye Would ever, ever cheer me. The laverock sings amang the clouds ; The lambs they sport so cheery ; And I sit weeping by the birk — O where art thou, my dearie ? Aft may I meet the morning dew, Lang greet till I be weary ; Thou canna, winna, gentle maid, Thou canna be my dearie. RED, RED IS THE PATH Red, red is the path to glory ! See yon banners floating high ; O, my Geordie, death's before ye ; Turn and hear my boding cry. Joy of my heart, Geordie, hear me ! Joy of my heart, Stu mo run ! x '\"My own!\" ROBERT COUPER 49 Turn and see thy tartan plaidie Rising o'er my breaking heart ; O my bonnie Highland laddie, Wae was I wi' thee to part ! Joy of my heart, etc. But thou bleedst, O bleedst thou, beauty ? Swims thine eye in woe and pain ? Child of honour, child of duty, Shall we never meet again ? Joy of my heart, etc. Yes, my darling, on thy pillow Soon thy head shall easy lie ; Soon upon the bounding billow Shall thy war-worn standard fly. Joy of my heart, etc. Then again thy tartan plaidie — Then my bosom, free from pain, Shall receive my Highland laddie : Never shall we part again. Joy of my heart, etc. THE SHEILING Oh ! grand bounds the deer o'er the mountain, And smooth skims the hare o'er the plain ; At noon the cool shade by the fountain Is sweet to the lass and her swain. E 50 THE GLASGOW POETS The evening sits down dark and dreary ; Oh ! yon's the loud joys of the ha' ; The laird sings his dogs and his dearie, — Oh ! he kens na his singing ava. But oh ! my dear lassie, when wi' thee, What's the deer and the maukin to me ? The storm soughin' wild drives me to thee, And the plaid shelters baith me and thee. The wild warld then may be reeling, Pride and riches may lift up their e'e — My plaid haps us baith in the sheiling That's a' to my lassie and me. MRS. GRANT OF LAGGAN 1755-1838 IN the middle of the eighteenth century the Goosedubs of Glasgow was. a respectable quarter. There Anne M' Vicar was born. Her father was an officer in a Highland regiment, and on her mother's side she was descended from the Stewarts of Invernahyle. Soon after her birth her father's regiment was ordered across the Atlantic, and took part in the conquest of Canada. M' Vicar afterwards resigned his commission and settled in Vermont on his military grant of 2000 acres, which he added largely to by purchase of the grants of brother-officers. Misfortune, however, attended him. Forced by ill-health to return to Scotland in 1768, in 1776, on the outbreak of the War of Independence, he was deprived of his property and reduced to a meagre subsistence as barrack - master at Fort Augustus in Glen More. There, in 1779, Anne mairied the Rev. James Grant, the military chaplain, who forthwith accepted the parish of Laggan close by. He was related to some of the best families in Badenoch, and there the pair led an uneventful life for twenty-two years. Something of the metal the minister's wife was made of can be guessed from the fact that, in order to fit herself for her duty in the parish, she studied and mastered the Gaelic tongue. She had already acquired Dutch for the sake of the Dutch friends with whom she stayed in America. Her courage and force of character, however, were to be put to a sterner proof. She had been the mother of twelve children, and eight survived to her when in 1801 her husband died. She then found herself not only without means, but considerably in debt. Her home, too, the manse, must be given up to her husband's successor. Many women would have sunk in despair, but the minister's widow was made of stronger stuff. She took a small farm in the neighbourhood, and set to work to retrieve the position. 52 THE GLASGOW POETS The most brilliant part of her life was yet to come. From her earliest days she had shown an instinct for letters. In the American colonies the sergeant of the regiment who had taught her writing had given her a copy of Henry the Minstrel's \"Wallace,\" and helped her to read it. \"I conned it so diligently,\" she wrote in after days in her memoir, ' ' that I not only understood the broad Scottish, but caught an admira- tion for heroism, and an enthusiasm for Scotland, that ever since has been like a principle of life.\" In her sixth year she had read the Old Testament, and pored with delight over \"Paradise Lost.\" At nine years of age she had made imitations of Milton ; and at Glasgow, after the return from America, she had written several pieces of merit. Now, in 1803, at the urging of friends, she gathered her verses and published them. Three thousand copies were subscribed for, and she was able with the proceeds to pay all her debts. She moved then to Stirling ; and in 1806 her \"Letters from the Mountains,\" a collection of charming epistles describing Highland lore and character, which she had written to friends from Laggan ; and in 1808 her \" Memoirs of an American Lady \" — a Madame Schuyler, with whom she had lived for several years at Albany — established her as an author. In 1810 she removed to Edinburgh, where her literary accomplishments and brilliant conversa- tion made her house the resort of men of letters like Lord Jeffrey, Henry Mackenzie, and Sir Walter Scott Her \"Essays on the Superstitions of the Highlands,\" \"Popular Models and Impressive Warnings,\" and other productions, were all successful books, and with the proceeds of them, with several legacies from friends, and with a pension of ;£ioo a year granted her in 1825, she found a comfortable provision till her death at the age of 83. In the Gentleman's Magazine for January, 1839, appeared a de- tailed account of her life and writings ; and a collection of her letters, with a memoir by her son, was published at London in 1844. She was styled Mrs. Grant of Laggan to distinguish her from that other Mrs. Grant \" of Carron,\" author of \" Roy's Wife of Aldivalloch. \" The pre- servation of many interesting Highland traditions was owed to her. One of these, quoted by Hill Burton in his \" Life of Lord Lovat,\" from a MS. of Mrs. Grant, gives an idea of her vivid style. It describes the last interview between Prince Charles and Lovat at the house of Gortuleg, near the Falls of Foyers, just after Culloden. \"The Prince and a few of his followers came to the house ; Lovat expressed attach- MRS. GRANT 53 ment to him, but at the same time reproached him with great asperity for declaring his intention to abandon the enterprise entirely. * Remem- ber,' said he fiercely, 'your great ancestor, Robert Bruce, who lost eleven battles, and won Scotland by the twelfth.'\" So great was the repute of Mrs. Grant's knowledge of Highland character, custom, and legend, and her power of depicting them, that for a time she was thought to be the author of \" Waverley \" and \" Rob Roy.\" O WHERE, TELL ME WHERE?1 \"O where, tell me where, is your Highland laddie gone? O where, tell me where, is your Highland laddie gone ? \" \" He's gone with streaming banners, where noble deeds are done, And my sad heart will tremble till he comes safely home. He's gone with streaming banners, where noble deeds are done, And my sad heart will tremble till he comes safely home.\" \" O where, tell me where, did your Highland laddie stay ? O where, tell me where, did your Highland laddie stay ? \" \" He dwelt beneath the holly trees, beside the rapid Spey, And many a blessing followed him the day he went away. He dwelt beneath the holly trees, beside the rapid Spey, And many a blessing followed him the day he went away.\" i This piece, like Robert Couper's \"Red, red is the path,\" was written on the absence in Holland of the Marquis of Huntly with the forces under Sir Ralph Abercrombie in 1799. It was obviously suggested by \"The blue bells of Scotland,\" sung by Mrs. Jordan, printed in the \"Town and Country Songster for 1801,\" and reproduced in Johnson's \"Scots Musical Museum,\" vol. vi., in 1803. 54 THE GLASGOW POETS \" O what, tell me what, does your Highland laddie wear ? O what, tell me what, does your Highland laddie wear ? \" \" A bonnet with a lofty plume, the gallant badge of war, And a plaid across the manly breast that yet shall wear a star. A bonnet with a lofty plume, the gallant badge of war, And a plaid across the manly breast that yet shall wear a star.\" \" Suppose, ah ! suppose, that some cruel, cruel wound Should pierce your Highland laddie, and all your hopes confound ! \" \" The pipe would play a cheering march, the banners round him fly ; The spirit of a Highland chief would lighten in his eye. The pipe would play a cheering march, the banners round him fly ; And for his king and country dear with pleasure he would die. \"But I will hope to see him yet in Scotland's bonnie bounds ! But I will hope to see him yet in Scotland's bonnie bounds ! His native land of liberty shall nurse his glorious wounds, While wide through all our Highland hills his warlike name resounds. His native land of liberty shall nurse his glorious wounds, While wide through all our Highland hills his warlike name resounds.\" MRS. GRANT 55 COULD I FIND A BONNIE GLEN Could I find a bonnie glen, Warm and calm, warm and calm — Could I find a bonnie glen, Warm and calm ; Free frae din and far frae men, There my wanton kids I'd pen, Where woodbines shade some den, Breathing balm, breathing balm — Where woodbines shade some den, Breathing balm. Where the steep and woody hill Shields the deer, shields the deer — Where the steep and woody hill Shields the deer ; Where the woodlark singing shrill, Guards his nest beside the rill, And the thrush, with tawny bill, Warbles clear, warbles clear — And the thrush, with tawny bill, Warbles clear. Where the dashing waterfall Echoes round, echoes round — Where the dashing waterfall Echoes round ; And the rustling aspen tall, 56 THE GLASGOW POETS And the owl at evening's call, 'Plaining from the ivied wall, Joins the sound, joins the sound — 'Plaining from the ivied wall, Joins the sound. There my only love I'd own, All unseen, all unseen — There my only love I'd own, All unseen ; There I'd live for her alone, To the restless world unknown, And my heart should be the throne For my queen ! LEAVE ME NOT Oh, my love, leave me not ! Oh, my love, leave me not ! Oh, my love, leave me not — Lonely and weary. Could you but stay a while, And my fond fears beguile, I yet once more could smile, Lightsome and cheery. MRS. GRANT 57 Night, with her darkest shroud, Tempests that roar aloud, Thunders that burst the cloud, Why should I fear ye ? Till the sad hour we part Fear cannot make me start — Grief cannot break my heart Whilst thou art near me. Should you forsake my sight Day would to me be night ; Sad, I would shun its light, Heartless and weary. ON A SPRIG OF HEATH Flower of the waste ! the heath-fowl shuns For thee the brake and tangled wood ; To thy protecting shade she runs ; Thy tender buds supply her food. Her young forsake their downy plumes To rest upon thy opening blooms. Flower of the desert though thou art, The deer that range the mountain free — The graceful doe, the stately hart — Their food and shelter seek from thee. 58 THE GLASGOW POETS The bee thy earliest blossom greets, And draws from thee her choicest sweets. Gem of the heath, whose modest bloom Sheds beauty o'er the lonely moor ! Though thou dispense no rich perfume Nor yet with splendid tints allure, Both valour's crest and beauty's bower Oft hast thou decked, a favourite flower. Flower of the wild, whose purple glow Adorns the dusky mountain's side ! Not the gay hues of Iris' bow, Nor garden's artful varied pride, With all its wealth of sweets could cheer, Like thee, the hardy mountaineer. Flower of his heart, thy fragrance mild Of peace and freedom seems to breathe. To pluck thy blossoms in the wild, And deck his bonnet with the wreath, Where dwelt of old his rustic sires, Is all his simple wish requires. Flower of his dear-loved native land ! Alas ! when distant far more dear ! When he, from some cold foreign strand, Looks homeward through the blinding tear, How must his aching heart deplore That home and thee he sees no more. MRS. GRANT 59 THE GRAMPIANS1 All hail, ye frowning terrors of my way, Rude Grampian mountains, crowned with lasting snow ! No flowery vales, or plains with verdure gay, Could bid my soul with purer joy o'erflow. Barriers of holy freedom ! your stern brow With guardian frown o'erlooks her last retreat ; When tyrant rapine roamed the plains below, Among your winding glens she found a seat. Beyond those dark defiles thy narrow vale, Green Laggan ! soon shall cheer my weary sight ; Young voices sounding on the mountain gale Shall fill this anxious bosom with delight ; While ruddy innocence with raptured smile Shall cling to this fond heart, by absence torn erewhile. 1 This sonnet is included in a rhyming itinerary of the author's Jive days' journey from Glasgow to Laggan, the second longest piece in her first volume. JOHN DUNLOP 1755-1820 AMONG the poets of Glasgow have been counted all ranks of the citizens, from the humble skellat bellman to the stately Lord Provost himself. The memory of John Dunlop may be said to survive by reason of one, or at most two, short songs. Wherever Scotsmen gather to see the old year out and the new year in, \" Here's to the year that's awa' \" is as likely to be sung, almost, as \" Auld Langsyne \" itself. The author was a typical Glasgow citizen, social and hospitable, who took much pleasure in listening to Scottish songs, and could sing them himself to good effect. Born at his father's residence, Carmyle House, in the parish of Old Monkland, near Glasgow, he was a young man when the red-cloaked \" tobacco lords \" were strutting their proudest at the Tron; he saw the crisis of their downfall during the American War; and, as a successful merchant himself, when Glasgow was beginning to build its fortunes on new foundations, he was Lord Provost in 1796. He afterwards became Collector of Customs, first at Bo'ness, then at Port-Glasgow, where he died. During his life, in 1817 and 1819 respectively, Dunlop printed privately ten copies each of two volumes of his poetry, and he is said to have left four volumes in manuscript. His son, who was Sheriff of Renfrewshire, and author of a \" History of Fiction,\" printed privately in 1836 fifty copies of a further small collection of Dunlop's pieces; and in \"Dunlop of that Ilk,\" by Ex-Bailie Archibald Dunlop, pub- lished at Glasgow in 1898, the poems of John Dunlop were included, with a portrait of their author. Several of the poet's \"Epitaphs\" on deceased members of the Hodge- Podge Club, to which Dunlop belonged, were included in the club minutes, and are quoted in JOHN DUNLOP 61 \" Glasgow and its Clubs \" by Dr. Strang, and two appear in the \"Coltness Collections\" printed by the Maitland Club. Two other of Dunlop's pieces were printed from his MSS. by Dr. Charles Rogers in the \"Modern Scottish Minstrel.\" George Farquhar Graham, when including \"The year that's awa'\" in his collection, gave the following details : — \" Mr. Robert Donaldson, printer in Greenock, now in Glasgow, having been reading Dunlop's poems, thought the song so good as to be worthy of an air ; and calling upon Mr. W. H. Moore, then organist there, now in Glasgow, hummed over to him what he considered might be a melody suited for it. This Mr. Moore re- modelled considerably, and published, probably about the year 1820. It was afterwards taken up by some of the public singers, and became very popular.\" THE YEAR THAT'S AWA' Here's to the year that's awa' ! We will drink it in strong and in sma' ; And here's to ilk bonnie young lassie we lo'ed While swift flew the year that's awa'. And here's to ilk, etc. Here's to the sodger who bled, And the sailor who bravely did fa' ! Their fame is alive, though their spirits are fled On the wings of the year that's awa'. Their fame is alive, etc. Here's to the friends we can trust When the storms of adversity blaw ! May they live in our song and be nearest our hearts, Nor depart like the year that's awa' ! May they live, etc. 62 THE GLASGOW POETS DINNA ASK ME Oh ! dinna ask me gin I lo'e thee ! Troth I dar'na tell : Dinna ask me gin I lo'e thee ! — Ask it o' yoursel'. Oh ! dinna look sae sair at me, For weel ye ken me true : ' Oh ! gin ye look sae sair at me I dar'na look at you ! When ye gang to yon braw, braw toun, And bonnier lasses see, Oh, dinna, Jamie, look at them, Lest you should mind na me ! For I could never bide the lass That ye'd lo'e mair than me ; And oh, I'm sure my heart would break Gin ye'd prove false to me ! LADY FRANCES STEWART For beauty and for youth let others weep ! Laid by the hand of death in life's last sleep, Their fate lament, their merits blazon o'er, Lost to the world that ne'er shall see them more. JOHN DUNLOP 63 Though neither youth nor beauty slumbers here, Yet age and virtue claim the parting tear — A tear to grace the spot where wisdom lies, Wit without malice, truth without disguise. Here rests religion, void of vain pretence, Founded on reason and matured by sense, With every Christian attribute adorned, By all who knew, who felt its influence mourned. Blest be the heart that heaves the generous sigh — Sacred the drop that springs from sorrow's eye ! Yet reason shall our selfish grief restrain, And check the tear that now must flow in vain. Far, far removed from sorrow's sighs and tears, Thy holy spirit dwells in heavenly spheres, Welcomed by angels to their high abode, Pure as themselves, and reconciled to God. JOHN MAYNE 1759-1836 AMONG the Scottish poets who were writing at the same time as Burns, John Mayne possesses a peculiar interest. His \"Hallowe'en\" obviously formed the model for the famous piece on the same subject by the Ayrshire bard, and not only the idea but the actual refrain of his \" Logan Braes\" was annexed by Burns for his \"Logan Water.\" On his own merits, besides, Mayne is entitled to high consideration. His \"Siller Gun,\" which describes a relic of ancient wapinschawing surviving in his day in Dumfries, remains one of the raciest and most humorous examples of a time-honoured vein of Scots poetry, the vein of James V's \"Christ's Kirk on the Green\" and Fergusson's \" Leith Races.\" And his poem \"Glasgow,\" besides affording an excellent picture of the city at the end of the eighteenth century, stands among the most readable of Scottish topographical pieces. Born and educated in Dumfries, the poet was employed for a time on the Dumfries Journal, but removed early to Glasgow, where he lived at the Greenhead, and served an apprenticeship of five years as a printer with the celebrated brothers Foulis. He settled in London in 1787, and spent the remainder of his life in the metropolis as printer, editor, and part proprietor of the Star newspaper. A brief account of Mayne's somewhat uneventful career appeared in the Gentleman's Magazine for May, 1836, and in The Annual Obituary for 1837 ; and some supplementary dates were furnished by his son, an official in the India House, for Laing's Additional Notes to Johnson's \" Museum.\" \"The Siller Gun,\" Mayne's chief work, was the slow growth of fifty- nine years. Twelve stanzas were printed on a single quarto sheet at Dumfries in 1777 ; in 1779 it was published in two cantos ; it was three cantos when it appeared in Ruddimaris Magazine in 1780, four when JOHN MAYNE 65 it was printed in London in 1808, and five when the author sent it out finally in 1836. In the same way the two first stanzas of \" Logan Braes\" were written and sung at Glasgow in 1781, and printed in the 6Varnewspaper in 1789, but the final edition of the lyric, three stanzas long, was only printed in the preface to \"The Siller Gun\" in 1836. Stanzas which appeared in the Paisley Repository in 1806 and in the Pocket Encyclopedia of Songs at Glasgow in 1816, were probably not all Mayne's. The song was written to replace a somewhat indelicate old ditty, beginning — \" Ae simmer nicht on Logan Braes I helped a lassie on wi' her claes, First wi' her stockings,\" — etc. \" Glasgow \" again, was printed first in outline in The Glasgow Magazine for 1783, and might have remained there, but Dr. Geddes having called the attention of the Society of Antiquaries to it in flattering terms in 1792, Mayne was induced to take it up again and extend it. The complete poem was published in 1803. \" Hallowe'en \" appeared first in Ruddimarfs Magazine for November, 1780, and again in an edition of \" The Siller Gun\" in 1783, but Burns's \" Hallowe'en \" superseded it so completely that it does not seem to have been printed again till 1896, when it was included among Mayne's productions in the Abbotsford Series volume, \"Scottish Poetry of the Eighteenth Century.\" Other of Mayne's pieces were printed in the columns of his own paper and the pages of Ruddiman's and the Gentlemarfs Magazine. Of Mayne's private character, Allan Cunningham, who knew him well, said \"a better or warmer-hearted man never existed\" ; and of his works, \" 'The Siller Gun,' \" Sir Walter Scott declared, \"surpassed the best efforts of Fergusson, and came near to those of Burns.\" Mayne's \" Logan Braes,\" again, matched on its own ground, fairly excelled the \" Logan Water \" of the Ayrshire poet. 66 THE GLASGOW POETS THE SILLER GUN Opening description. For loyal feats and trophies won Dumfries shall live till time be done ! Ae simmer's morning, wi' the sun, The Seven Trades there Foregathered, for their Siller Gun x To shoot ance mair. To shoot ance mair in grand array, And celebrate the king's birthday, Crowds, happy in the gentle sway Of ane sae dear, Were proud their fealty to display, And marshal here. O George ! the wale o' kings and men ! For thee in daily prayer we bend. With ilka blessing Heaven can send May'st thou be crowned ! And may thy race our rights defend The world around ! i The \"siller gun,\" a small silver tube like a pistol barrel, was presented by James VI. as a prize for the best marksman in Dumfries. The actual weaponshawing described by Mayne was that of 1777. JOHN MAYNE 67 For weeks before this fete sae clever, The folk were in a perfect fever, Scouring gun-barrels in the river — At marks practising — Marching wi' drums and fifes for ever — A' sodjerisin'. And turning coats and mending breeks, New seating where the sark tail keeks ; (Nae matter though the clout that ekes Be black or blue) ; And darning, with a thousand steeks, The hose anew. Between the last and this occasion Lang, unco lang, seemed the vacation To him wha wooes sweet recreation In Nature's prime, And him wha likes a day's potation At ony time. The lift was clear, the morn serene, The sun just glinting ower the scene, When James M'Noe began again To beat to arms, Rousing the heart o' man and wean Wi' war's alarms. Frae far and near the country lads, Their joes ahint them on their yads, 68 THE GLASGOW POETS Flocked in to see the show in squads, And, what was dafter, Their pawkie mithers and their dads Cam' trotting after. And mony a beau and belle were there, Doited wi' dosing in a chair. For, lest they'd, sleeping, spoil their hair, Or miss the sight, The gowks, like bairns before a fair, Sat up a' night. Wi' hats as black as ony raven, Fresh as the rose, their beards new shaven, And a' their Sunday's deeding having Sae trim and gay, Forth cam' our Trades, some orra saving To ware that day. Fair fa' ilk canny cadgy carl ! Weel may he bruik his new apparel, And never dree the bitter snarl O' scowling wife ! But, blest in pantry, barn, and barrel, Be blithe through life ! Hech, sirs ! what crowds cam' into town To see them mustering up and down ! Lasses and lads, sunburnt and brown, Women and weans, JOHN MAYNE 69 Gentle and simple, mingling, crown The gladsome scenes. At first forenent ilk deacon's hallan His ain brigade was made to fall in ; And while the muster-roll was calling, And joy-bells jowing, Het pints, weel spiced to keep the saul in, Around were flowing. Broiled kipper, cheese and bread, and ham, Laid the foundation for a dram O' whiskey, gin frae Rotterdam, Or cherry-brandy, Whilk after, a' was fish that cam' To Jock or Sandy. Oh, weel ken they wha lo'e their chapin, Drink mak's the auldest swak and strappin', Gars care forget the ills that happen, The blate look spruce, And even the thowless cock their tappin, And craw fu' crouse. The muster ower, the different bands File aff in parties to the sands, Where, 'mid loud laughs and clapping hands, Gley'd Geordie Smith Reviews them, and their line expands Alang the Nith. 70 THE GLASGOW POETS But ne'er, for uniform or air, Was sic a group reviewed elsewhere : The short, the tall, fat folk, and spare, Syde coats and dockit, Wigs, queus, and clubs, and curly hair, Round hats and cockit. As to their guns — thae fell ingines, Borrowed or begged, were of a' kinds, For bluidy war, or bad designs, Or shooting cushies — Lang fowling-pieces, carabines, And blunderbusses. Maist feck, though oiled to mak' them glimmer, Hadna been shot for mony a simmer, And Fame, the story-telling kimmer, Jocosely hints That some o' them had bits o' timmer Instead o' flints. Some guns, she thrieps, within her ken, Were spiked, to let nae priming ben ; And as in twenty there were ten Worm-eaten stocks, Sae, here and there, a rosit-end Held on their locks. And then, to show what difference stands Atween the leaders and their bands, JOHN MAYNE 71 Swords that, unsheathed since Prestonpans, Neglected lay, Were furbished up, to grace the hands O' chiefs, this day. \" Ohon ! \" says George, and gae a grane, \" The age o' chivalry is gane ! \" Syne, having ower and ower again The hale surveyed, Their route and a' things else made plain, He snuffed, and said : \" Now, gentlemen ! now mind the motion, And dinna this time mak' a botion — Shouther your arms ! — Oh, haud them tosh on, And not athraw ! Wheel wi' your left hands to the ocean, And march awa'.\" Wi' that the dinlin' drums rebound ; Fifes, clarionets, and hautboys sound ; Through crowds on crowds, collected round, The corporations Trudge aff, while Echo's self is drowned In acclamations. Their steps to martial airs agreeing, And a' the Seven Trades' colours fleeing, Bent for the Craigs — oh, weel worth seeing ! They hied awa' ; 72 THE GLASGOW POETS Their bauld convener proud o' being The chief ower a'. Attended by his body-guard He stepped in gracefu'ness unpaired, Straught as the poplar on the swaird, And strang as Samson. Nae e'e could look without regard On Robin Tamson. His craft, the Hammermen fu' braw, Led the procession, twa and twa ; The leddies waved their napkins a', And boys huzzayed, As onward to the waponschaw They stately strade. Close to the Hammermen, behold, The Squaremen come, like chiefs of old ; The Weavers, syne, their flags unfold ; And after them The Tailors walk, erect and bold, Intent on fame. The Sutors, o' King Crispin vain, March next in turn to the campaign ; And, while the crowd applauds again, See, too, the Tanners Extending far the glittering train O' guns and banners. JOHN MAYNE 73 The Fleshers, on this joyous day, Bring up the rearward in array ; Enarmed they mak' a grand display — A' jolly chiels, Able, in ony desperate fray, To fecht like deils. The journeymen were a' sae gaucy, The apprentices sae kir and saucy, That, as they gaed alang the causey, Ahint them a' The applauding heart o' mony a lassie Was stown awa'. GLASGOW Hail, Glasgow ! famed for ilka thing That heart can wish or siller bring ! May Peace, wi' healing on her wing, Aye nestle here ; And Plenty gar thy childer sing The lee-lang year ! Within the tinkling o' thy bells How mony a happy body dwells ! Where they get bread they ken themsels But I'll declare They're aye bien-like, and, what precels, Hae fouth to spare. 74 THE GLASGOW POETS If ye've a knacky son or twa, To Glasgow College send them a', Wi' whilk, for gospel, or for law, Or classic lair, Ye'll find few places hereawa' That can compare. There ane may be, for sma' propyne, Physician, lawyer, or divine. , The gem, lang buried i' the mine, Is polished here, Till a' its hidden beauties shine, And sparkle clear. Nor is it students, and nae mair, That climb in crowds our College stair. Thither the learned, far-famed, repair To clear their notions, And pay to Alma Mater there Their warm devotions. Led by a lustre sae divine, Ev'n Geddes visited this shrine. Geddes ! sweet favourite o' the Nine ! Shall live in story, And like yon constellation shine In rays o' glory. O ! Leechman, Hutcheson, and Wight ! Reid, fu' o' intellectual light ! JOHN MAYNE 75 And Simpson, as the morning bright ! Your memories here, Though gane to regions o' delight, Will aye be dear ! 'Mang ither names that consecrate, And stamp a country gude or great, We boast o' some that might compete, Or claim alliance Wi' a' that's grand in Kirk or State, In art or science. Here great Buchanan learnt to scan The verse that mak's him mair than man. Cullen and Hunter here began Their first probations, And Smith, frae Glasgow, formed his plan- \" The Wealth o' Nations.\" In ilka house, frae man to boy, A' hands in Glasgow find employ ; Even little maids, wi' meikle joy, Flower lawn and gauze, Or clip wi' care the silken soy For ladies' braws. Their fathers weave, their mothers spin The muslin robe, so fine and thin That, frae the ankle to the chin, It aft discloses 76 THE GLASGOW POETS The beauteous symmetry within — Limbs, neck, and bosies. Look through the town ! The houses here Like noble palaces appear ; A' things the face o' gladness wear — The market's thrang, Business is brisk, and a's asteer The streets alang. Clean-keepit streets ! so lang and braid, The distant objects seem to fade ; And then, for shelter or for shade Frae sun or shower, Piazzas lend their friendly aid At ony hour. O for the Muse o' Burns, so rare, To paint the groups that gather there ! — The wives on We'n'sdays wi' their ware, The lads and lasses In ferlying crowds at Glasgow Fair, And a' that passes ! But oh ! his Muse, that warmed ilk clod, And raised up flowers where'er he trod, Will ne'er revisit this abode ; And mine, poor lassie ! In tears for him dow hardly plod Through Glasgow causey. JOHN MAYNE 77 Wond'ring, we see new streets extending, New squares wi' public buildings blending, Brigs, stately brigs, in arches bending Across the Clyde, And turrets, kirks, and spires ascending In lofty pride. High ower the lave St. Mungo rears His sacred fane, the pride of years, And, stretching upward to the spheres, His spire afar To weary travellers appears A leading star. 0 happy, happy were the hours When first, afar on Crawford moors 1 hailed thee bright through sunny showers, As on I came Frae murmuring Nith's romantic bowers, My native hame ! Blythe days ! ower happy to remain : The sire wha led my steps is gane ! Yet wherefore should the Muse complain In dirge-like lines, When Heaven has only ta'en its ain For wise designs ? Still happy, happy be their hours Wha journey, Clydesdale, through thy bowers ! 78 THE GLASGOW POETS And blest amang the angelic powers, Blest be the man Wha saved St. Mungo's hallowed towers Frae ruin's han' ! And O, eternal Truth, all hail ! May thy pure dictates aye prevail ! But ne'er sic times let Scotia wail, When Re"
