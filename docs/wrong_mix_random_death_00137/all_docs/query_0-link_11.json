Although altogether unwilling to occupy with the expression of our own feelings the space which we would nore gladly see filled by the communications of our Friends, we cannot resist availing ourselves of the op- Dortunity afforded us by the commencement of a Volume ;o express our gratification at the approval which has at- tended the step of beginning A New Series, and the no ess general satisfaction with which the Index to the First Series has been received.

SUrrEAGAN BISHOPS. At. the present time, when suffragan bishops are so urgently required to assist the overtasked bishops of England, the following list, taken from my complete, but unpublished \" Book of the British Hierarchy,\" may prove interesting. Well would it be if bishops in bad health, or incapable of efficiently administering their dioceses from their magnitude, were supplied with coadjutors. Churches eminently adapted for being episcopal sees are in every diocese : Westminster for Lon* don, Southwell for Lincoln, St. Germains for Cornwall, Bath for Bath and Wells, Bristol for Gloucester and Bristol, St. Alban's for Rochester, Beverley for York, Middleham for Ripon, Co- ventry for Lichfield, Bury for Norwich, St. Neot's for Ely ; while it woidd be easy to suggest Romsey, Dorchester, Wrexham, Shoreham, Bre- con, Slirewsbury, &c., for the remaining sees. By 28 Henry VIIL c. 14. the following suffra- gan sees were proposed to be erected ;■ Cambridge, Hull, Berwick, St. Germains, Thetford, Ipswich, Grantham, Huntingdon, Southampton, Guildford, Leicester, Nottingham, Shrewsbury, Penrith, Mol- ton, Bridgwater, Isle of Wight, Colchester, Lei- cester. The following five were suffragan sees for a time : Taunton, Shaftesbury, Marlborough, Dover, and Bedford. Gloucester, Bristol, Ox- ford, Peterborough, and Chester, were perma- nently erected. Westminster was a bishopric, 1540-50. In the xxxvth Canon of 1603, suffragans are named as ministering Holy Orders. And in King Charles ll.'s Declaration from Breda, he stated his intention to found suffragans in every diocese. Formerly suffrngans were consecrated to serve in the absence of the diocesans on embassies, at court, or attendance on civil affairs. Sometimes they had no titles : they consecrated and recon- ciled churches, administered orders and confirma- tion. It appears from Strype, that in the Primate's Hall, they occupied an inferior place at table. An Act of Parliament was passed for consecrating coadjutors in Ireland, 1812, 52 Geo. III. c. 62.

(Jamaica.} What has become of Dr. Walker's noble pro- posal to endow a See of Cornwall, acknowledged in Parliament and by both Houses of Convo- cation ? M.A.CKENZIE ^VALCOTT, M.A, ETYMOLOGIES, \" Merry England.\" — This expression, I appre- hend, conveys an erroneous idea to the minds of persons .in general. It is usually supposed to refer to the gay, joyous character of the English people of the olden time ; whereas, as I hope I shall be able to show, it is like \" La Belle France,\" and such terms indicative of the nature and ap- pearance of the country, not of the character of the people. The origin of our word merry is the Anglo- Saxon mipis, a word seemingly peculiar to that language, for I have not met any term resembling it in any of the cognate dialects. Its proper meaning seems to be pleasant, cheerful, agreeable. Thus in the Canterbury Tales, the Person e says : \" I wol yow telle a mery tale in prose ; \" and this tale is a grave \" Treatise on Penitence,\" to which merry, in its present acceptation, could never be applied. In like manner it is said of Chaunticlere the cock : \" His vols was merier than the mevT/ orgon,\" which is not merry in our sense of the word. But merry is also used of places : \" Of erbe yve that groweth in our yerd that mery is.\" \" That made hem in a cite for to tarie, That stood full mery upon a haven sj'de.\" Lincoln is termed merry in the ballad of \" Hugh of Lincoln;\" we also meet with Merry Carlisle and MerrylaxiA Town, in which the reference is plainly to the site, &c., of the place, rather than to the character of the inhabitants. Merry England is then, we may say, England that abounds in comforts, and is pleasant to live in, 1 cannot help thinking that merry in its original NOTES AND QUERIES. [2«'ds. N0 27., JnLY5,'56. sense ^iieuld, in some cases, pretty accurately ex- press the peculiar Portuguese term saudoso. The Lusitanian lexicographers define the substantive saudade, \" grief arising from the absence of the beloved object, accompanied by the desire of see- ing it again ; \" which is something like desiderium. But we find saudoso in connections where this is not the exact sense. Thus we meet with olhos saiidosos, \" mery eyen,\" and Camoens says : \" Nos saiidosos campos do Mondego,\" in both of which places it is the pleasure of pre- sence, rather than the {)ain of absence, that is in- dicated. As I am on the subject of etymology I will give the origin of saiidade, saudoso, of which I have seen no derivation. As then an older form is so'idade, so'idoso, 1 would say, having in view the syncopating character of the Portuguese language, that the root of them, as of the French souci, is sol'icitus. I may add that souci and saiidade are names of the same flower. \" Good Cheer.\" — I have given cheerful as a sense of merry, jjnd it is curious to mark the pro- gress of the word cheer. There can, I think, be hardly a doubt that the origin is Kc'pa, \" head ; \" retained by the Spaniards in cara, and changed by the Italians to cera, ciera, and by the French to chere, all signifying \" face.\" Hence o\\jr cheer usually denotes aspect, countenance ; then it was applied to the mind, as in \" Be of good cheer ; \" and finally, indicative, some might say, of the English character, good cheer came to signify good eating and drinking! There were also the verbs to cheer and to cheer up, the last contracted to chirp, as in — \" He takes his chirping pint and cracks his jokes.\" \" Lechery.\" — This word is usually derived from the French lecher, to lick ; but this is evidently incorrect, for both it and licorous must come from luxuria, which is exactly the same with it in sense. ThOS. KEIGHTIiEY. DUKE THE POET. It may perhaps be doubted whether Richakl Duke deserved the honour of being immortalised by the pen of our great moralist ; but, since the thing has been done, it seems only a proper mark of respect to Johnson to make a note of anything that may assist in filling up his sketches, and carrying out his purpose. Tliis is especially the case when the biographer was at a loss for mate- rials ; and I believe that of all the Lives of the Poets that of Duke is the shortest and most superficial. In my copy it does not occupy so much as one full page ; and what little there is quite accords with the opening words — \" Of Mr. Kichard Duke I can find few memorials.\" More of his circumstances and personal history may, I think, be learned from a document which I lately found, while searching for something else, among some family deeds and papers in my possession. How it, and several other documents to which Duke was a party, came to be where they are, I cannot tell; but I think that (if room can be made for it) this one is worth printing as it stands; for it seems as if it could not be materially abridged without losing some part of the character or in- formation. It is written on parchment, and en- dorsed \"A Cop[)ie of Mr. Richard Duke his Discharge to his iFathers Executors, 1679 :\" \"Know all men by these presents that I, Richard Duke, Batchelor of Art, eldest sonne and heire of Richard Duke, late Citizen and Scrivener of Lon- don, deceased, anil now of the full age of one and twenty yeares, doe hereby acknowledge, and de- clare, that I have received and had, at and before thenseuleing and delivery hereof, of and from Robert Cliilcott, Citizen and Merchantaylor of London, George Dashwood of London, esquire, and Thomas Goodwin, Citizen and Scrivener of London, executors of the last will and testament of the said Richard Duke my said late father, de- ceased, my share, and the better share to my owne content, of all my said fathers printed books, which he, in and by the said will, did will and appoynt should be devided betweene his two sonnes (namely), mee the said Richard Duke, and my brother Robert Duke; and that I should have the better share.

Allow me, however, to add a Query. Johnson states that the poet is said to have been tutor to the Duke of Richmond ; and this seems not impro- bable. The duke must have been about seven years old when the poet came of age and gave this discharge. I shall be much obliged to any one who will tell me, either through \"N. & Q.\" or directly, where I mny find the particulars of the young Duke of Richmond's conversion to ' Popery, and re-conversion to Protestantism.

Under the head of \" Tabula?,\" the writer of that article has referred to certain \" ancient waxen tablets,\" said \"to have been discovered in one of the gold mines near the village of Abrud- bianya, in Hungary, and which were described by M. Massmann of Munich in his Libellus Aurarius, sive TabulcB ceratce, et AntiquissiihoB et unicce Ro- mance, Leipsic, 1840, 4to. The date assigned to these tablets is A. d. 167, and, supposing them to be genuine, they would afford us the earliest existing specimens of cursive minuscule Roman writing ; but the fact is, that they have been long proved to be fictitious by the continental scholars and palaeographers ; and a statement to that effect was published by Silvestre in the Paleographie Uni' verselle, published in 1839-1841, and, more re- cently, repeated in the English translation of that work, 1850, vol. i. p. 255. I may add, from ray own testimony, that these very tablets, or similar ones, were offered to me for purchase several years ago, but were rejected at once as palpable forgeries. F. Madden.

P. H. MARRIOT THK GREAT EATER. In that amusing and really instructive work, John Duntons Life and Errors, may be found the following paragraph : \" The air of New England was sharper than at London, which, with the temptation of fresh provisions, made me eat like a second Mariot of Gray's Inn.\" Upon which Dunton's editor, Mr. J. B. NichoL^, has this note ; \" Of this celebrated eater no other record, it is probable, now remains.\" Not so. In Smith's Obituary, edited for the Camden Society by Sir Henry Ellis, I find the following entry : \"25 Nov. 1653, Old Marriot of Gray's Inn (y* great eater) buried.\" Sir Henry Ellis is silent about this Gray's Inn worthy. Not so Charles Cotton, Walton's associate in The Complete Angler, who, in his Poems on Seve- ral Occasions, 1689, has two copies of verses on the Gray's Inn cormorant ; one (p. 349.) called \" On the Great Eater of Gray's Inn,\" the other (p. 417.) \"On Marriot.\" From the former we learn that he was spare and thin : \" Approaching famine in thy physnomy.\" The other has this line : \" Mariot the eater of Gray's Inn is dead.\" The readers of John Dunton and Charles Cotton will probably make a note of this communication. Peter Cunningham. Kensington. THE liASS OF RICHMOND HILL. In the Memoirs of Mrs. Fitzherbert, by the Hon. Charles Langdale, lately published, there is the following quotation from the above song : \" I'd crowns resign To call thee mine, Sweet lass of Richmond Hill ! \" And it is stated, upon the authority of the late Lord Stoiirton, that the song*was written to cele- brate the charms of the above lady. With all due deference to his lordship's opinion, I consider this to be a mistake, and I beg to enumerate two or three other individual ladies, for whom it has been asserted it was compiled. A Miss Smith, who resided on the Hill near the Terrace, at the period 2nd s. No 27., July 5. »56.] NOTES AND QUERIES. wben the song first appeared, had the general re- putation of being the person for whom it was de- signed. The Rev. Thomas Maurice published Richmond Hill, a poem, in which, under the name of Mira, he introduces a Miss Cropp as the Lass of Richmond Hill, who committed suicide for her lover on the 22nd April, 1782 ; but this has been regarded merely as poetic fiction with regard to the song. Another account we have, in Personal Sketches of his own Times, by Sir Jonah Barring- ton, vol. ii. pp. 47 — 52. ; in this it is stated Mr. Leonard MacNally wrote the song on a Miss Janson, daughter of Mr. Janson, a rich attorney of Bedford Row, Bloomsbury, who had a country- house on Richmond Hill. There were great ob- stacles to his marrying her, but perhaps from making the lady the theme of his poetry, and being also the author of Robin Hood, a comic opera of great merit, he ultimately obtained her hand. But notwithstanding all these authorities, I am inclined to think the song was not intended for any particular person, but written by Mr. Wm. Upton, author of Poems on several Oc- casions, 8vo., 1788, and A Collection of Songs sung at Vauxhall, and who was the poet of Vaux- hall Gardens 1788—1789. I believe it first ap- peared in the Public Advertiser oi'M.onAiiy, Aug. 3, 1789, where it is stated to be a favourite song sung by Mr. Incledon at Vauxhall, and composed by Mr. Jas. Hook (the father of Theodore). It is said Incledon sang the song in such a fascinating manner, that it led to a superior and permanent engagement at Covent Garden Theatre, as, after the season of 1789, he never again appeared at Vauxhall. *. Richmond. \"grenvillb papers:\" george iii.'s letter to LORD temple, correction OF. In the Grenville Memoirs of the Cabinets of George III. is a remarkable letter from the king to Lord Temple, written on the occasion of his \"surrender\" to the coalition ministry of Epx and Lord North ; which, like everything else of his private correspondence published, is highly cha- racteristic of the firm unaffected character of the man, and of that remarkable power of letter- writing in a pure English unpretending style, which completely refutes the aspersions thrown by adverse or disappointed politicians upon his un- derstanding and education. In this letter there is, however, one trace of that haste in writing, which the king notoriously had in speaking, and which sometimes made it difficult for those he addressed to follow or under- stand him. The editor of the Grenville Papers undertakes to correct the obscurity, but has done so, as I think, clumsily, and without effect. The sentence, as printed verbatim from the original, is this : \" The seven cabinet councillors named by the Coalition shall kiss hands tomorrow ; and then form their arrange • ments ; as the former negociation theij did not condescend to open to many of their intentions.\" The obscurity is in the clause printed in Italics, and the editor, in a foot-note, corrects it thus : \" As (in) the former negociation they did not conde- scend to open to(o) many of their intentions.\" It appears to me that this emendation is partly incorrect ; I would re-write the sentence thus : \" As (m) the former negociation, they did not conde- scend to open to m(e) any of their intentions.\" This would reduce the king's mistake to the omission of an in, and the running of me, any, into many ; while it is at once more intelligible, and more expressive of that sense of offended dignity at the treatment he experienced at the hands of the Coalition, which pervades every line of the letter. This indignation has, as seems to me, in another sentence led the king into a form of expression which rather oversteps the bounds of correctness ; he calls his \" besiegers \" — \" The most unprincipled coalition the annals of this or any other nation can equal.\" I may be wrong in my criticism, and should bow to correction, but this sentence seems somewhat to conform (as I humbly submit.) to that mode of expressing intensity, in which Sir Boyle Roche, in the Irish parliament on some occasion of national calamity, affirmed that, — \" Singh misfortunes never come alone, and the greatest of all possible misfortunes is generally followed by a much greater.\" A.

SHAKSPEAKE AND BABNFIELD. Being at present busily engaged in the prepa- ration and printing of my new edition of Shak- speare's Plays and Poems, with a revisal of the text and notes of my former impression of 1843 and 1844, I am very desirous of obtaining all the information I can procure regarding Richard Barnfield, who has had the honour, as it now ap- pears, not of having poems by him imputed to Shakspeare, but of having poems by Shakspeare imputed to him. The general belief, for about the last century, has been, that certain produc- tions in verse, really by Barnfield, and published by him in 1598, had been falsely attributed to our great dramatist ; but not long since I wrote a letter to The Athenaum, the effect of which, I apprehend, would be to deprive Barnfield of the pieces in question (inserted in The Passionate Pilgrim, 1599), and to restore them to their actual author, Shakspeare. The matter now seems to He in a nutshell : — They were printed as Barnfield's in 1598 ; they were printed as Shakspeare's in 1599 ; and when Barnfield reprinted his productions in 1605, he excluded those which had been printed in 1599 as Shakspeare's. The inference seems to me in- evitaMe, that they were by Shakspeare and not by Barnfield. I formerly thought that Barnfield had, in a manner, reclaimed his property in 1605 ; but the very reverse is the fact : and those poems in The Passionate Pilgrim, which are there as- signed to Shakspeare, but which were formerly supposed to be Barnfield's, may now, without much hesitation, be taken from Barnfield and given to Shakspeare. Hence we may perhaps conclude that W. Jaggard, the publisher of The Passionate Pugrim, was not quite as much of a I rogue as was formerly imagined. It then becomes a question how Shakspeare's poems, in The Passionate Pilgrim of 1599, came to be published as Barnfield's in 1598. Bara- 2nd S. NO 27., July 5. '66.1 .Js^OTES AND QUERIES. 9 field's Encomion of Lady Pecunia was \" printed by G. S. foi' John Jaggard\" in tliat year. Al- though a thin tract, it is divided into four parts, and every part has a separate title-page and im- print, but the first only bears the name of the author, \"Richard Barnfeild, graduate in Oxford:\" neither does the first title-page mention any of the three other distinct portions of the volume. It is to be observed also (a circumstance that escaped my notice when I wrote to The AthencBum), that after \" The Encomion of Lady Pecunia,\" * forming the first portion of the volume, and which alone has the name of Barnfield upon the title- page, a new set of signatures at the bottom of the page begins. \"The Encomion of Lady Pecunia\" begins on A 2 (A 1 having formed the fly-leaf), and ends on C 4. Then we arrive at a new title- page, \" The Complaint of Poetrie, for the Death of Liberalitie,\" which begins on sig. A 1, and ends on sig. C 2. The title-page of the third division of the work, \" The Combat betvveene Conscience and Covetousnesse in the Minde of Man\" is upon sig. C 3, and it goes on as far as sig. D 4. The fourth division of the work, \" Poems in Divers Humors,\" has its separate title-page on sig. E 1 ; and on sig. E 4 the whole ends. The imprint upon the four title-pages is precisely in the same ■vrords and figures, viz., \" London, printed by G. S. for lohn laggard ; and are to be solde at his shoppe neere Temple-barre, at the Signe of the Hand and starre, 1598.\" The poems, formerly in dispute between Shakspeare and Barnfield, are in the fourth division of the volume, \" Poems in divers humors.\" My mistaken notion, twelve years ago, was, that Barnfield, in 1605, had republished the whole of what had first appeared in 1598. This is not so. In 1605 he prefixed a general title-page, men- tioning only three of the four divisions of his original work, viz. — 1. \"Lady Pecunia, or The Praise of Money.\" 2. \" A Combat betwixt Con- science and Covetousnesse;\" and 3. \" The Com- plaint of Poetry, or the Death of Liberality.\" He says not one word about what had been his fourth division in 1508, \"Poems in divers humors;\" but still, on the very last leaf of the impression of 1605, Barnfield places \"A Rernembrance of some English Poets,\" which had appeared as one of the \" Poems in divers humors,\" in 1598. All the rest he seems purposely to have excluded, as if they were not his. As I have the necessary books upon my table, I will subjoin an enumeration of the contents of \" Poems in divers humors,\" including, of course, those which I now suppose Shakspeare to have written, and which are mixed *up with other pieces, some of them of a personal nature. 1. Six lines, at the back of the title, \"To the learned and accomplisht Gentleman, Maister Ni- cholas Blackleech of Grayes Inne,\" without any signature. 2. \" Sonnet to his friend Maister R. L. in praise of Musique and Poetrie :' this is No. \"VIII. in The Passionate Pilgrim (see my edit., vol. viii. p. 566.). 3. \" Sonnet against the Dispraysers of Poetrie :\" it mentions Chaucer, Gower, Lord Surrey, Sir P. Sidney, Gascoigne, and the King of Scots. 4. \" A Remembrance of some English Poets,\" in eighteen lines : it speaks of Spenser, Daniel, Drayton, and Shakspeare. 5. \" An Ode,\" beginning \" An it fell upon a day:\" it is inserted in 27te Passionate Pilgrim, No. XXL (see my edit., vol. viii. p. 577.). The poem beginning \" Whilst as fickle fortune smilde,\" which I treated as a separate production, is here united with that which precedes it. 6. Some lines thus headed \" Written at the request of a Gentleman under a Gentlewoman's Picture :\" it consists of six fourteen-syllable lines. 7. \" An Epitaph upon the Death of Sir Philip Sidney, Knight, Lord-governour of Vlissing :\" it is in ten long lines in couplets. 8. \" An Epitaph upon the Death of his Aunt, Mistresse Elizabeth Skrymsher :\" it is in twenty- four long lines, in couplets. \"A Comparison of the Life of Man :\" it is a seven-line stanza, followed by the word \" Finis.\" This, as well as \" A Remembrance of some En- glish Poets,\" is reprinted in Barnfield's edition of 1605. The two impressions of \" Lady Pecunia,\" in 1598 and in 1605, I have before me. I have also copies of Barnfield's Affectionate Shepheard, 1594 (Ritson, by mistake, dates it 15t6); and of his Cynthia, with certaine Sonnets, 1595. In the ad- dress \" to the courteous gentleman Readers,\" be- fore the last, Barnfield repudiates \" two books,\" which had been untruly imputed to him : he pro- bably means Greene's Funerals, 1594, and Or- pheus his Journey to Hell, 1595, both of which were put forth with his initials. Therefore, in 1598, it would have been no novelty to him to have other men's productions printed as his, since the practice had begun in 1594, and he had com- plained of it in 1595. In reference to \" As it fell upon a day,\" it may be noticed, that thcmgh published as Barnfield's in 1598, and as Shakspeare's in 1599, the real authorship of it was so little ascertained in 1600, that it was printed in that year in England's Helicon, under the signature of Ignoto.

Monson Township in Massachusetts. — Among the intelligent contributors on the other side of the Atlanuc to \"N. & Q,\" some one may be able to explain whence originated the name of Monson Township in Massachusetts. Some members of a younger (Catholic) branch of the Monson family are believed to have emigrated to the United States about 160 years ago, and the name is said to be not uncommon there. Are any particulars known of their early colonial lineage, or could they be obtained from provincial histories or any documents like parochial registers ? Monson. Gatton Park.

Two occur closely together in Latimer's Sermons (ed. Parker Society), p. 176. : \" Ezekias did not follow the steps of his father Ahaz, and was well allowed in it.\" And again, p. 177. \" Much less we Englishmen, if there be any such in England, may be ashamed. I wonder with what conscience folk can hear such things and allow it.\" Of course in this sense the word is de- rived from ad, and laudare. E. G. R. Butler Posse.ssions in Wiltshire, Bedfordshire, and Essex. — In 13 Hen. IV. Sir William Butler, on his son's marriage with his wife Isabella, settled a moiety of East and West Grafton and Woolton, in Wiltshire ; a moiety of the manor of Stoppesley (near Luton), called Halynges, in Bedfordshire ; a moiety of the manor of Chalk- well in Essex ; and a messuage called Houghton's, and one hundred acres of land, and twenty acres of pasture, with the appurtenances, in Berdfield in the same county. These possessions occur in family deeds of the Butlers in 9th, 19th, and 31st Hen. VI., 20 Rdw. IV., and 14 Hen. VIL All of them, except perhaps Stoppesley, appear to have been originally a portion of the possessions of the great family of Clare ; and the IButlers, who held them as mesne lords, probably acquired them by the marriage of some co-heiress. Any of your readers acquainted with county history will confer a favour by stating how and when the Butlers acquired the above properties. B. Cor.sican Brothers : Nicholas and Andrew Tre- maine. — In the Church of Lamerton, near Tavi- stock, are the effigies of Nicholas and Andrew Tremaine, twin brothers, born in that parish, of whom it is related that not only were they so alike in person that their familiar acquaintances could not always distinguish them apart, but that an extraordinary sympathy existed between them, for even when at a distance from each other they performed the same functions, had the same appe- tites and desires, and suffered the same pains and anxieties at the same time. They were killed to- gether at Newhaven in 1663.* Can any of your correspondents authenticate these, or furnish any further particulars relating to these individuals ? Under what circumstances did they die ? R. W. Hackwood.

The names are never fully printed, and the notes are rather copious than explanatory. Perhaps some of your readers may assist me to the meaning of the blanks in the following passage, and say whence is taken the strange Latin of which it is an imitation : \" Elate to soar above a silent vote Upsprings the D — e to speak what H — wrote, But horrors unexpected check his speed.

Temple the Regicide. — By the act of the Com- mons of England for the trying and judging of Charles Stuart, King of England, as set out in the State Trials, I find, named amongst the com- missioners, three of the name of Temple, viz. Sir Peter Temple, Knight Baronet, James Temple and Peter Temple, Esquires. Sir Peter Temple was no doubt the second baronet of that name, the eldest son of Sir Thomas Temple, created in 1611, the progenitor of the Buckingham family. Sir Peter seems to have shrunk from sitting under this commission, for I do not find bis name amongst those who attended at the various meet- ings which took place during the trial ; but the other two, James and Peter Temple, seem to have been men of different pith, and not to have been ashamed or afraid of acting under a commission which declared its bold purpose, \" To the end no chief officer or magistrate whatsoever may here- after presume traiterously or maliciously to imagine or contrive the enslaving or destroying of the English Nation, and to expect impunity for so doing ; \" for I find their two names recorded at nearly every meeting of the commissioners, and also signed to the death warrant. Can I be in- formed through your columns of what branch of the Temple family these bold patriots were ? Were they related to Sir Peter the timid, and bow ? Wh^t became of them at the Restoration ? and whether any of their descendants can still be traced? and where I should be likely to obtain information ? Sir Thomas, the first baronet, is said to have had thirteen children, but he would scarcely have two sons named Peter ? R. G. Temple. The Lache, Chester. Monti's '■'■Death of Basseville.\" — In Forsyth's Remarks on Antiquities, Ai'ts, and Letters, during an Excursion in Italy, it is said, with relation to Vincenzo Monti, author of several tragedies, that \" his Death of Basseville made him a public man.\" Can you afford any information respecting the subject of the latter work, or otherwise illustra- tive of the passage quoted from Forsyth. T. H. [Hugo Basseville, the hero of Monti's most celebrated performance, was born at Abbeville about 1755. In com- pliance with the paternal wish he entered on the study of theology, but from the natural bent of his own mind devoted himself to literary pursuits, and repaired to Paris in quest of fame and fortune. Visiting Berlin he became acquainted with the elder Mirabeau, which gave rise to an intimate friendship with that celebrated indi- vidual. From Berlin he proceeded to Holland, where he wrote several works, tainted with that impious licence of profane wit exercised by Voltaire with such a deso- lating and filial effect. At the commencement of the Revokition Basseville adhered with commendable fidelity to the ro3'al cause, and conducted a daily journal, the Mercure National, which had for its motto, \" II faut un Eoi aux Fran9ais.\" At this time none of his friends sus- pected any inclination in him towards that excess of democratic fanaticism to which, whether impelled by poverty, or by a guilty ambition, he presently abandoned himself. In 1792 he was nominated Secretary of Lega- tion at the Court of Naples. In the following year a few of his countrj'men, more reckless than himself, were too successful in urging him to the rash experiment of which his life was the forfeit. This event occurred on Jan. 14, 1793, when it appears that, with a view of obtaining a demonstration of the public feeling, Basseville appeared in the streets of Rome wearing the badge of revolutionary principles, the tricolored cockade. This dangerous step excited the populace to a pitch of phrenzy, and the envoy was stabbed in the stomach by a person of the lowest class. How bitterly he repented his folly may be inferred from the words that escaped his lips almost with his latest breath, \"Je meurs la victime d'un fou.\" The poem, The Death of Basseville, is the production of Monti on which his fame chiefly rests in his own country, where it is familiarly styled the Bassevilliad, and often cited as the masterpiece of the author, and of later Italian poetry. The poem had an astonishing success ; eighteen editions of it appeared in the course of six months. Ajx English translation was published anonymously in 1845, but at- tributed to Adam Lodge, Esq., M.A., which contains a biographical sketch of Hugo Basseville, and some charac- teristic notices of the poetical genius of Monti.] Palavacini. — There are some well-known lines about Baron Palavacini, but they have escaped my memory, and as I do not know where to find them, I shall feel obliged if any of your readers 2nd s.

Henry Kensington. [Sir Horatio Palavacini, a Genoese, was one of the col- lectors of the Pope's dues in the reign of Queen Mary, which, having sacrilegiously pocketed in the time of Queen Elizabeth, enabled him to purchase two estates, one at IJabrahani (formerly spelt Baberham), and the other at Shelford, which came to his two sons, who were knighted by Islizabeth and James I. (Morant's Essex, i. 8. 26.) Sir Horatio was naturalised by patent in 1586, and is mentioned in the tirst edition of Walpole's Anecdotes of Painting, vol. i. p. IGO., as an \"arras-painter;\" in the second edition of tiiat work is the following epitaph, quoted from a MS. of Sir John Crew of Utliington : \" Here lies Horatio Palavazene, Who robb'd the Pope to lend the Queene. He was a thief. A thief ! Thou lyest ; For wide? he robb'd but Antichrist. Him Death wyth besorae swept from Babram, Into the bosom of oulde Abraham. But then came Hercules with his elub. And struck him down to Beelzebub.\" Sir Horatio died July G, IGOO, and on July 7, 1601, his widow married Sir Oliver Cromwell, the Protector's uncle. (See Noble's 3femoirs of the Cromwells, vol. ii. p. 178., and Burke's Landed Gentry, art. Cromwell.) Palavacini was one of the commanders against the Spanish Armada in 1588, and his portrait is preserved amongst those heroes in the borders of the tapestry in the House of Lords, en- graved by Pine. He was also employed by Queen Eliza- beth in his negotiations with the German princes.

The salmon holding a gold ring in its mouth, which forms a conspicuous figure in the armorial bearings of the Church of Glasgow, is a comme- moration of an incident related in Jocelin's Life of St. Kentigern, cap. xxxvi. p. 273., ap. Vitas antiquas SS. Scoto-Britannice, Lond. 1789, pub- lished by Pinkerton. This saint is commonly called St. Mungo. The recovery of a lost ring, or other small ob- ject, in this manner is attested by many ancient, and even modern storie# — by history, by legends, by observation, and perhaps I might add without any irreverence, by the account of the miiacu- lously found tribute money recorded by St. Mat- thew and by St. Mark. The classical reader will at once remember what Herodotus has related of the ring of Polycrates. The ancient Indian drama of Sacontala has a similar incident. In the Life of St. Kenny, Abbot of Aghaboe, who lived in the same age with Sr. Kentigern, there is a similar narrative. St. Kenny is related to have fettered the feet of one of his disciples (\" alligavit pedes ejus compede ne vagus esset, et clavem compedis ejus, S. Cainnicus projecit in mare \"), and then to have thrown the key of the fetter into the sea, between Ireland and Britain. The legend then proceeds to tell how the disciple remained thus fettered for seven years, and that then St. Kenny, knowing what was to happen, ordered him to depart from Wales, and to return to Ireland, and there to make his abode in what- ever place he should find the key of his fetter. He accordingly went his way, and having arrived in Leinster, and having met some fishermen on the banks of the LifFey, he obtained from them a large fish, within which he found the key of his fetter. This I quote from the privately printed Vita S. Cainnici, Dublin, 1851, cap. xv. The editor in a note has adduced various incidents of the same kind from several sources. Among them are those of the ring of Polycrates ; the miracle of the tribute money ; Sacontala's ring ; the legend of St. Kentigern ; the legend of St. Nennidh, re- lated by Animchadh, one of the biographers of St. Bridget (Colg. Tricis,p. 559.) ; and the similar story of St. Maughold, Bishop of Man, which is told by Jocelin in the Life of St. Patrick, cap. clii. (Colg. Tr., p. 98.) But perhaps more in- teresting are the facts which are enumerated from modern history, such as the loss and recovery of Sir Francis Anderson's ring, related by Brand in his History of Newcastle-upon-Tyne, a valuable topographical work, which the editor of the Life of St. Kenny complains that he could not find in any of the libraries of Dublin. He adds severAl 14 NOTES AND QUEKIES. [2'\"i S.

I should give the entire of the annotation, which I could readily augment by some more recent cases, only that the editor has announced his intention to reprint the book for publication in a series of similar hitherto unpub- lished legends. Besides this Dublin edition of the Vita S. Cain- nici, there is another, but also privately printed, the cost of which was entirely defrayed by the late Marquis of Ormonr), who munificently pre- sented the copies to the Kilkenny Archaeological Society. Artebus. Dublin. The fish and the ring in these arms refer to an old legend in connection with St. Mungo, or Kentigern, the founder of the see. A Imly lost her ring while crossing the Clyde, and her hus- band thinking she had bestowed it upon some favoured lover, became very jealous and angry. In this dilemma she sought the advice of St. Kentigern, who, after fervent devotions, asked one who was fishing to bring him the first fish he caught ; this was done, and in the mouth of the fish was found the lady's lost ring, which being restored to her husband, he was convinced of the injustice of his suspicions. This device appears on the seal of Bishop Wishart, of Glasgow, as early as the reign of Edward II. This legend of the fish and the ring, like many others, is to be found in most countries : it is re- lated in the pages of Herodotus and Pliny, and occurs in the Koran ; one instance of it is re- corded at Newcastle-upon-Tyne, and another carved on a monument in Stepney Church. Moule's beautiful and interesting volume on the Heraldry of Fish notices the subject at length. NoRRis Deck. Cambridge. A tradition given by Archbishop Spottiswoode professes to explain the fish and the ring in these arms : \" In the daj's of St. Kentigern, a ladj' having lost her wedding-ring, it stirred up her husband's jealousv, to allay which she applied to St. Kentigern, imploring his help for the safety of her honour. Not long after, as St. Kentigern walked by the river, he desired a person that was fishing to bring him the first fish he could catch, which was accordingly done, and from its mouth was taken tlie lady's ring, which he immediately sent to her to remove her husband's suspicion.\" In confirmation of this Bishop Wishart's official seal, as seen from the chartulary of Glasgow, in 1279, has been noticed. One compartment showed the bishop seated, while before him knelt a person holding a fish with a ring in its mouth. In the middle division stood the king with a drawn sword in his right hand, and on his left the queen crowned, and having in her right hand a ring. The bishop in his robes knelt praying, in the lower compartment. The legend circumscribed was \" Rex furit, haec plorat, patet aurum dum sacer orat.\" If the Glaswegians of a former day had been fiXmous for their imaginative faculties, the follow- ing lines by Dr. Main, once professor of the theory and practice of physic in our Universitj', might be taken as expressive of the thoughts which led them to fix on the present armorial bearings : \" Salmo maris, terrieque arbor, avis aeris, urbi, Promittunt, quicquid trina elementa ferunt: Et campana, frequens celebret quod numinis aras [ Urbs, superesse Polo non peritura docet : Neve qnis dubitet sociari aeterna caducis, Annulis id pignus conjugiale notat.\" \" As s3'mboled here, the sea, the earth, the air, Promise unto our town whate'er thej' bear. To worship at the shrine the bell doth call, Our queenly town, thus guarded shall ne'er fall. Let no one doubt that thus are linked to heaven The things of earth : the union pledge is given.\" The derivation most generally accepted of the word Glasgow is the Gaelic clais-ghu, a black or dark ravine ; this name being given, it is supposed, originally to a glen, on a little stream east of the cathedral, in which St. Mungo set up his abode. Another etymology is Eaglais-dhu, the black church, i.e. church of Blackfriars; while Glas's dhii, grey and black, points to a period also of monkish rule. Universitatis alumnus. Glasgow. I have a copper coin or penny-token with these arms on one side, and the motto \"Let Glasgow Flourish \" around it. On the other side a river- god, with \"Clyde\" inscribed on his urn, from which a stream issues, and \"Nunquam arescere mdccxci\" as motto ; but the remarkable point is that around the edge, instead of milling, are the words \"Cam- bridge, Bedford, and Huntingdon x.x.x.\" How can the occurrence of these words on a Glasgow token be explained ?

Diet., Lond. 1816) mentions a Richard (called sometimes Ar- machanus and Fitz-Ralph), Archbishop of Ar- magh in the fourteenth century, whose opinions so displeased the friars that they procured him to be cited before Pope Innocent VI. at Avignon. The age was not prepared to listen to him, and the Pope decided in favour of the friars. He died at Avignon, not without suspicion of poison, 1360. See also Fox's Book of Ma7'tyrs. 6. The Hoe. — The derivation given is pro- bably correct. The word is also found spelt hogh. Richardson derives it from Anglo-Saxon heah, and gives the following : \" That well can witnesse yet vnto this day The westerne hoyh. Spenser, F. Queens, b. 11. c. 10. \" All doubtful to which party the victory would go, Upon that lofty place at Plymouth called the Hoe Those mighty wrestlers met.\" Draj'ton, Poly-Olbion, 5. 1. R. S. Charnock. St. Richard (2\"^ S. i. 470.) — ■ Richard (de Wyclie) was born at Droitwich, in Worcester- shire. Having pursued a course of studies at Oxford, Paris, and Bologna, and so perfected him- self in the canon law, he was appointed by Ed- mund, Archbishop of Canterbury, his chancellor, and was also appointed Chancellor of the Univer- sity of Oxford. In 1245, he was elected (by the chapter) Bishop of Chichester, in opposition to an unfit nominee of Henry III. And Richard's election was confirmed, as it had been promoted, by Pope Innocent. The Bishop died in 1253, at Dover, in his fifty-seventh year, and was after- wards canonised by Pope Urban IV., a.d. 1261. Mr. Boask may find a brief account of \" Bishop Richard \" in Parker's Calendar of the Anglican Church, in Brady's Clavis Calendaria, in Cosin's Notes on the Book of Common Prayer, or in Mant, Wheatly, or any other annotator on the English Calendar, under the third of April, on which day he died. J. Sansom. St. Richard was Bishop of Chichester, and died at Dover, April 3, 1253, on which day he is still commemorated in the English Calendar. He vras appointed bishop in opposition to the nominee of Henry III., and it was only by the interference of the pope that he was allowed, after two years' de- privation, to take possession of his see, which he presided over more than five years, dying at the age of fifty-seven. His emblems, in reference to various legends connected with him, too long for insertion here, are a plough and a chalice. NoBRis Duck. Cambridge. There is an account of a S.'Richardus, rex apud Anglo- Saxones in Britannia, to be found in torn. ii. Febr. p. 69. of the Acta Sanctorum of BolLindus.

In a former number I was able to furnish some particulars relative to this gentleman. I now propose to make an addition to my previous com- munication. The late John Ring, Escpi, surgeon, in London, was an excellent scliolar and an enthusiastic ad- mirer of Virgil. Dissatisfied with the previous trans- lations, he published in 2 vols., 8vo., London, 1820, a mosaic edition, partly original and partly altered from the text of Dryden and Pitt. This having fallen into Mr. Clapperton's hands, was anxiously perused and greatly admired by him; so much so, that he was induced to write to Mr. Ring. This led to a correspondence, in the course of which numerous faulty lines were pointed out and amended by Clapperton. Ring felt much grati- fied by the praise and assistance of his correspon- dent, and learning that his circumstances were far from opulent, intimated a wish to recompense him ; this the poet would not listen to, but agreed to accept a pprtrait of his new friend, which was sent without delay, in a handsome frame, and was duly received by Mr. Clapperton, who placed the honoured portrait in the most conspicuous place in his apartment. Mr. Ring died in Dec, 1821, an event which retarded the projected new edition. Clapperton nevertheless went on with his translations and emendations, and in 1835 published, by subscrip. tion, the jiEiieid, in two small volumes, 12mo. There were copies, few in number, on large paper: these are now very scarce. The Georgics were not included in this edition, Mr. Clapperton being of opinion that they required very little emenda- tion, and in truth caring nothing about them. I had forgotten the greater part of the above legend, when my memory was refreshed by seeing poor Clapperton's highly prized portrait of Ring amongst various paintings exposed for sale by Mr. Nisbet, in his far-famed sale rooms in Edin- burgh. For \" Auld lang syne,\" and out of re- spect to the memory of Ring and Clapperton, both of whom were most excellent and worthy persons, I became, for a small consideration, the purchaser. The painting is an excellent one, and I have no doubt is very like Mr. Ring. It is not improbable that some person • connected with the deceased gentleman can tell me who the painter was, or put me in the way of obtaining that knowledge. J. M. (2.) PHOTOGRAPHIC CORRESPONDENCE. Photographic Portraits. — The Art of Photography is at length taking its place beside that of engraving in the publication of Portraits. We have several specimens now before us. Dr. Diamond has been induced to issue some of his Portraits of the Men of the Time ; and we doubt not many an old King's College man will be glad to have the opportunitj' of securing the admirable like- ness which Dr. Diamond has produced of the Rev. Dr. Major, the learned and excellent Master of King's Col- lege School ; while the many friends who appreciate the literary acquirements and social character of the Author of The Handbook of London, will be no less delighted with the genial and characteristic likeness of Mr. Peter Cunningham, which Dr. Diamond has succeeded in catching. These are separate publications. But Messrs. Maull & Polyblank have commenced a work of greater pretension. It is entitled Photographic Portraits of Living Celebrities; and appears monthly, each portrait being accompanied by a Biographical Memoir. The First Number contains Professor Owen, and a more charac- teristic portrait of the \" Newton of Natural History \" cannot well be imagined. The Second Number furnishes us with a portrait of Mr. Macaulay. The likeness is satisfactory, thoughtful, and characteristic. As a por- trait of the great historian silent, it is indeed admirable — but is deficient in that animation which, when talking, lights up the whole countenance of one who talks so well. Hardwich's Photographic Chemistry. — This little vo- lume, indispensable to every photographer, has been thoroughly revised, and now appears in a third edition. Everything has been omitted froWI it which does not possess practical as well as scientific interest. The chapters on Photographic Printing have been entirely re- written, and include the whole of the author's i:nportant investigations on this subject. Lastly, Mr. Hardwick has endeavoured as far as possible to recommend the em- ployment of chemical agents which are used in medicine, and vended by all druggists. How useful this may prove can only be judged bj' those who have suffered from practising photography in remote localities, far from the reach of purely photographic chemicals. Vapliti to Mirxav ^ntxlti. Bishop Butts (2\"^ S. i. 34.) — I observe in your number for Jan. 12, an answer to the Query of K. H. S. respecting Dr. Butts. This bishop was not the only prelate slandered by Cole. Passing by his calumnies, I inform K. H. S. that Bishop Butts was the seventh child of Rev. W. Butts, formerly rector of Hartest, Suffolk : that he was not quite destitute of merit, as Cole asserts, may be inferred from his brother clergymen having elected him as their Convocation Proctor in 1727, he being then rector of Chedburgh ; he was also rector of Ickworth, lecturer of St. Max-y's, Bury St. Edmunds, and chaplain to George II. ; and successively Dean of Norwich, Bishop of Nor- wich, and Bishop of Ely. His first wife was not a daughter of Dr. Eyton, but of Rev. A. Pycher, formerly rector of Hawstead ; and he died, aged sixty-three ; about which age Cole makes him marry a second wife, which he certainly did, but at a much earlier age. He was descended of an ancient family, inheriting a property descending through many generations from before the time of Edward II. to James II., situated at Shouldham Thorp, Norfolk, in the church of which place 18 NOTES AND QUERIES.

Burn has given so short a list of books which he has at hand for a history of Henley, omitting some of general information, that I would first refer him to Hastings Past and Present, Lond. 1 855, Append, pp. i. Ixii., the last work I am acquainted with, as giving a long list of works which have reference to the locality it treats of. They cannot of course be transferred at once to a Henley Past and Pre- sent, but they will indicate sources of information which he must have recourse to, more or less, if he would do his work well.

Anon. Special Report from Committee of House of Commons (2°'^ S. i. 461.) — The Committee of the House of Commons referred to by N. E, was ap- pointed Feb. 22, 1719 (House of Commons Journal, p. 274. b.). The Committee reported March 18 {Id. p. 305. a.), and the House resolved that several informations given before the Committee tending to accuse the Attorney-General \" of corrupt and evil practices are malicious, false, scandalous, and utterly groundless,\" 4he report and other papers to be printed, and that Mr. Speaker do appoint the printing of the said report {Id. 310. b.). The Committee again reported April 27 {Journal, p. 341.), and the House came to a resolution that the subscribers having acted as corporate bodies without legal authority, \" and thereby drawn in several unwary persons into unwarrantable under- takings, the said practices manifestly tend to the prejudice of the publick trade and commerce of the kingdom ;\" and a Bill was ordered \" to re- strain the extravagant and unwarrantable practice of raising money by voluntary subscriptions for carrying on projects dangerous to the trade and subjects of this kingdom.\" And Mr. Secretary Craggs, Mr. Walpole, Mr. Comptroller, Mr. Chan- cellor of the Exchequer, do prepare, and bring in the same {Id. 351. a.). Mr. Lowndes was added May 2 {Id. 353. b.). Parliament was prorogued June 11. The Reports are printed in the House of Com- mons Journals.

There is a copy of this Report in the library of Trinity College, Dublin, from which I shall have pleasure in copying any extracts desired by N. E. Dublin. « Writers bribed to Silence (2\"'' S. i. 471.) — In- formation has lately been sought in \" N. & Q.\" for any information respecting writers who may have been bribed to silence. It would be equally curious and interesting to trace the extent of bribery in modifying or altogether changing a journal's politics. In 1816, the Journal de VEmpire, an influential French newspaper, published the following : \" We are assured the English Journal called The Courier, has received 500.000 francs from the bankers of M. de Blacas to write against France. At first 10,000 Louis were offered to the Journalist ; but was seriously angry, and protested that he was not a man to allow himself to be corrupted for such a trifle.\" William Mudford, author of half a dozen novels now forgotten, and of several miscellaneous works, including the greater part of the Border Antiqui- ties of Scotland, generally regarded as the sole off- spring of Sir Walter Scott's brain, edited the Courier at this period, and replied : \" Five hundred thousand francs, nearly 21,000/. sterling ! — The Paris Editor, at least, shows by the magnitude of the sum of what importance he thinks our support of any 2-JdS.

So far we are obliged to him, and we shall be farther obliged to him to add, in the next journal he pub- lishes after the receipt of our paper of to-day, that there was not one word of truth in his assertion.\" This contradiction was not regarded as conclu- sive or satisfactory by many of the contemporary prints. The Antigallican said : \" It is no easy matter to discover whether the charge or reply be the more correct, but thus much we have had an opportunity of knowing, that the Governments of France have had English Journalists in their pay since the Revolution. Indeed those persons who were in the hiibit of reading the Courier last summer, must have seen that that paper was not very friendly to the Bourbons ; now, however, it is suddenly changed, as if touched with a magic wand. \" Not long since a charge of a similar kind was pre- ferred against a Morning Paper, viz. of 10,000/. having been received by its proprietor from Blacas.\" It would be curious to elicit accurate informa- tion on this subject. William John Fitz-Patrick. The Silver Greyhound (2\"'^ S. i. 493.) — About seventy years ago the king's messengers always wore this badge when on duty, and it is one of these officers whom Sir Walter Scott, in his tale of \" Aunt Margaret's Mirror,\" calls the man with the silver greyhound on his sleeve. J. de W. Sir JEdivard Coke (P' ^.'iv. passim.) — The cor- rect spelling of the surname of this great lawyer is to be found in an \" Epistle Dedicatorie \" to him of,- \"A Discourse of the Damned Art of Witchcraft, so farre forth as it is revealed in the Scriptures, and manifest by true experience. Framed and Delivered by Mr. William Perkins, in his ordinarie course of Preaching, &c. Printed by Cantrell Legge, Printer to the Univer- sitie of Cambridge, 1613,\" namely, — \" To the Right Honourable Sir Edward Cooke, Knight, Lord Chief Justice of his Majesties Court of Common Pleas, Grace and Peace,'' &c. The author discusses the subject of witchcraft with considerable ingenuity, as it prevailed in England at that date; and with a zealous sincerity, in A Resolution to the Countryman, proving it utterly unlawfull to buie or use our yearely Prog- nostications, he endeavours to put down what had been the almanacks in circulation. G. N. Order of St. John of Jerusalem (2\"'> S. i. 197. 264. 461.) — To W. W., who informs me that \" all masonic degrees are separate and distinct,\" I beg to reply that I am quite aware of this ; but they are occasionally united in the same services, and under the same laws and regulations. I gave two instances, the latter being from a book of Laws and Regulations, of which the first article provides that the five orders of masonic knighthood in be united under one general administration, and subject to one code of laws. I need not repeat the names of these five orders, having specified them in a former communication. F. C. H. Poniatowski Gems (2°'^ S. i. 471.) — About ten or twelve years ago these gems were in the pos- session of a gentleman named Tyrrell, then re- siding in Craven Street, Strand, and he employed an Irish scholar named Pendergast to compile a Catalogue JRaisonnee of his treasure. At Mr. Tyrrell's house I saw, I think, the whole work, but certainly a part, in print. If it was completed, a"
