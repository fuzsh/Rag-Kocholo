        "text": "Whodunit, indeed! The creator of the detective story—America’s strange genius, Edgar Allan Poe—was supposedly himself murdered! If not, then what mysterious fate actually befell him?\n\nGenius Afoot\n\nEdgar Allan Poe, the American writer best known for his macabre poems and stories, was born January 19, 1809, in Boston. His parents were young actors—David Poe, who soon disappeared, and Elizabeth, who died of consumption when her son was only two (Edwards 2022, 22). Poe was raised by his godfather, a wealthy Richmond, Virginia, merchant named John Allan. Allan (or at least his wife) had been childless (Shanks 1937, 22).\n\nAllan opened a branch of his firm in Great Britain, and young Poe was taken to England and Scotland for a classical education from age six to eleven (1815–1820). That continued back in Richmond. In 1826, he spent a few months at the University of Virginia studying the classical languages Latin and Greek, as well as such Romance languages as French, Italian, and Spanish.\n\nHowever, at about seventeen, Poe, always headstrong, had accrued gambling losses that his guardian punished by pulling him from school. Then, returning to Richmond, Poe discovered his supposed sweetheart, Elmira Royster, had married. He went off to Boston where he had his first serious involvement with literature, sensing his destiny by publishing a pamphlet of verse titled Tamerlane (1827). Many of the poems, imitative of Lord Byron, concerned Poe’s lost love.\n\nImpoverished, Poe joined the army, using the name Edgar A. Perry. However, the death of his foster mother intervened, causing him to buy his way out of his commitment, then seek an appointment to West Point. Before leaving, he published a new volume of poems—leaning toward John Milton and Thomas Moore (the Irish romantic)—titled Al Aaraaf (1829). At the academy, he flouted attendance to seek expulsion, and yet again, with his familiar admixture of genius and poverty, this time he found himself in New York with another volume of verse. Titled simply Poems (1831), it nevertheless contained what critics have not hesitated to call “several masterpieces” (Cestre and Mabbott 1960, 103).\n\nReturning to Baltimore, Poe now began to write short stories. In 1833, he won $50 from a city weekly with his celebrated “A MS Found in a Bottle.” In two more years, he had returned to Richmond, this time with the editorship of the Southern Literary Messenger. He made his name there as a critical reviewer—his first of several such positions. Poe finally wed but even then did so raising eyebrows: He married his cousin Virginia Clemm, not yet fourteen. He seems to have proved a devoted husband (Dawidziak 2023, 20).\n\nPoe was dismissed from his Richmond job, apparently due to drink: “His drinking was the bane of his life. To talk well in a large company he needed a slight stimulant, but a glass of sherry might start him on a spree; and although he rarely succumbed, he was often seen in public when he did. Poe probably did not use drugs but did experience occasional psychotic episodes” (Cestre and Mabbott 1960, 103).\n\nBack again in New York, Poe published a lengthy prose work, The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym (1838), that combined fact with wild fancy. The following year he became editor of Philadelphia’s Burton’s Magazine, where, inspired by a contract for a monthly feature, he penned “William Wilson” and “The Fall of the House of Usher”—classic Poe tales of supernatural horror. Later in 1839 (but dated 1840), his Tales of the Grotesque and Arabesque appeared.\n\nPoe’s Invention of the Detective Story\n\nPoe resigned from Burton’s Magazine about June 1840, but then he returned the following year to become editor of its successor, Graham’s Magazine. The significance of what Poe did next can hardly be overstated.\n\nIt was in Graham’s Magazine that Poe printed the first detective story—not the first mystery, nor even the first “locked-room mystery,” but the first one to present a detective per se in the solving role. Poe created three such stories, each starring his amateur detective, Monsieur C. Auguste Dupin, as the coldly logical hero of what Poe called his “ratiocinative tales” (Benet’s Reader’s Encyclopedia 1987, 283). He did not call them “detective” stories (the word detective not yet being fully in use); neither did he apply the word to Dupin or use it in any of his stories.\n\nThis first Poe story, “The Murders in the Rue Morgue” (1841) relates the horrific murders of a reputed fortuneteller and her daughter in a locked-room mystery that baffles the Parisian police. (In the tale, Poe specifically acknowledges his debt to Eugène François Vidocq [1775–1857] the real-life “first detective” of history.1)\n\nPoe reprised Dupin for his next detective story, “The Mystery of Marie Rogêt” (1842–1843) described by Charles Baudelaire, an early translator of Poe, as a “masterpiece.” The story was based on a real-life case, the death of “the beautiful cigar girl,” Mary Rogers, which Poe transposed from New York City to France. By carefully studying newspaper accounts, Dupin is able to deduce what actually happened to Marie Rogêt, whose body was discovered in the River Seine (Nickell 2010).\n\nThis second Poe story thus introduced what would become the proverbial “armchair detective.” And it featured a crime writer determining to actually solve a real crime—as later prominent crime writers such as Arthur Conan Doyle and Erle Stanley Gardner would likewise attempt (Edwards 2022, 25). (The practice otherwise generally teaches how different the processes and skills of creating a mystery with those of actually solving a real one are; Nickell 2010.)\n\nFor Dupin’s third and final case, “The Purloined Letter” (1842–1843), Poe cleverly made the tale of the crucial missive one of hiding in plain sight. Although this ended his trio of detective stories, Poe did pen two additional stories of the mystery genre: His “The Gold-Bug” (1843) won a $100 prize from the Philadelphia Dollar Newspaper and, featuring buried treasure with a secret cipher, indulged Poe’s fascination with cryptography. His fifth and final mystery, “Thou Art the Man” (1844), is at once light-hearted and heavy-handed, but its use of unlikely suspects and a villain’s deceiving clues became mainstays of later whodunits (Edwards 2022, 25–26).\n\nCelebrity\n\nWith his work as a significant editor and his increasingly popular stories, Edgar Allan Poe had arrived. Handsome, if somewhat idiosyncratic, he was appreciated for his sound judgement—he admired both Alexander Pope and Shakespeare—as well as for his own dramatic power as a storyteller. He read aloud poetry, his own and others, it is said, “in a voice of surpassing beauty.” And he had a definite sense of humor as evidenced by a gag he tried out alluding to his immediately famous poem, “The Raven” (1845): He quipped a mock apology to a visitor for not keeping a pet raven (Cestre and Mabbott 1960, 103–104).\n\nIn 1844, he was again in New York and in 1845 became editor of the short-lived Broadway Journal. It was during this year that poet Frances Sargent Osgood became attracted to Poe. His ill wife did not object, although Osgood’s indiscretions and open writings caused scandal.\n\nVirginia died in January 1847. The following year, Poe traveled to Rhode Island where he became briefly engaged to poet Helen Whitman. He subsequently also had “platonic entanglements” with other women who assisted him financially and were rewarded with verse tributes (Cestre and Mabbott 1960, 103; Shanks 1937, 74–78).\n\nThe genius of Poe became recognized abroad as, belatedly, it did in America—the credit in both instances largely going to his French admirers, Charles Baudelaire and Stéphane Mallarmé. The year 1849 would be his last. He published his lecture Eureka, a supposed transcendental “explanation” of the universe—hailed alternately by critics as a masterpiece or nonsense.\n\nPoe expressed some forebodings about death in late September when he left Richmond for Baltimore, just weeks into the second half of his fortieth year. He was on a celebratory spree. Toasting a lady at her birthday party, he reportedly began drinking heavily, and, well, that is the question: What really happened to Edgar Allan Poe?\n\nA Mysterious End\n\nThe death of the creator of detective stories is ironically mysterious in its own right. On his final sojourn, Poe said goodbye to an old flame he had reunited with and planned to marry, Elmira Royster. He intended to travel via Richmond to Baltimore by steamer, then take a train to his home in New York, and on the way stop off in Philadelphia. However, after an illness of some five days, there came a tragic press report that Poe had died and was soon buried in Baltimore! The date was October 7, 1849 (Edwards 2022, 20–21; Walsh 2000, 32–35).\n\nJust what might really have happened has become the subject of many theories—if some can even be called that. Poe biographers playing sleuths themselves have suggested for the cause of Poe’s death everything from a longstanding heart condition, epilepsy, diabetic coma with liver damage, cerebral meningitis, delirium tremens (induced by alcohol or another toxic disorder), hypoglycemia, and even a case of rabies. One long-claimed “explanation” for what happened to Poe was something called “cooping”—an unbelievably crude form of electoral fraud in which some ill or intoxicated victim would be kidnapped then forced to vote repeatedly for some candidate. This idea was spread by anti-Poe gossips for many years, including a jealous enemy of Poe, the Rev. Rufus Griswold (Shanks 1937, 78–80; Symons 1978, 155–170; Geiling 2014).\n\nJohn Evangelist Walsh, in his Midnight Dreary: The Mysterious Death of Edgar Allan Poe, cataloged these ideas and more (2000, viii–xii, 54–60). But Walsh set his own sights on an even more sinister possibility.\n\nMurder?\n\nWalsh2 advanced his own belief that Poe was murdered. According to him, Poe was likely set upon in Philadelphia by Elmira’s three brothers. When Poe proceeded on to Baltimore, the trio attacked him again, forced him into drunkenness, and perhaps even put out the cooping story as a diversion. But why would the brothers do all this? Their motive was supposedly their opposition to Poe marrying their widowed, and quite wealthy, sister.\n\nSupposedly there existed elements that Walsh could marshal into such a scenario. Poe had had a bad feeling about his trip. On his journey, he twice heard men seated behind him talking about killing him (Walsh 2000, 71–73, 77–83). Much is made of Poe hanging out at Ryan’s Tavern, where his attackers plied him with drink. (Actually, it was just an old country inn.) He babbled a “dying message” about someone named Reynolds and was found on the street in a “manic” condition. When questioned, his answers were unsatisfactory (Symons 1978, 153).\n\nBut there were more strange elements. Poe wore a hat that belonged to someone else (Dawidziak 2023, 143). Previously, at times he had been “hallucinatory” and “suicidal” (Walsh 2000, 36–67, 75–83; Edwards 2022, 20–21). This seems not to sound like a murder story. There were still more bizarre factors. The reference to Reynolds in Poe’s delirium seemed only to name Jeremiah Reynolds, who inspired Poe’s story about Arthur Gordon Pym’s final and mysterious end (Walsh 2000, 122–123). A doctor was adamant that Poe did not suffer from intoxication. And he had no trouble swallowing, so his illness was not rabies (Dawidziak 2023, 183, 187).\n\nCritics and historical sleuths have long attempted to solve Poe’s last mystery: that of his own death. I have, I believe, now discovered in all the strangeness several real clues that suggest a new possibility. Taken together they are symptomatic of a disease that can take many different forms and was not so well known in Edgar Allan Poe’s time. Today, we know it as Parkinson’s disease or as a group of similar disorders called parkinsonism.\n\nToward a New Poe Theory\n\nParkinsonism is any of a group of serious nervous disorders tending to occur after the onset of middle age. It is associated with brain cells that in their destruction produce dopamine in the brain. The result affects the central nervous system, tending to yield slow movement, muscular tremor, partial facial paralysis, and sometimes a peculiarity of posture and gait. However, the variations of symptoms are numerous, and different people may be affected differently. For example, “In his addled state, Poe was likely combining vivid hallucinations with actual hazy memories” (Dawidziak 2023, 29).\n\nIn earlier times, Parkinson’s production of hallucinations was not so well known, but that element can be seen in Poe’s visualizations of shadowy killers and the like. These are internal rather than external sources. Also, retroactive diagnosis of Parkinson’s is highly indicated by Poe’s tremors being mistaken for delirium tremens. In 1849, Poe had extreme mood swings, “dark forebodings” as he said, in fear he might be killed. Recall that Poe had overheard men planning to murder him: Hallucination surely! The disease is named for English doctor James Parkinson who described it in his An Essay on the Shaking Palsy (1817) (“Parkinson’s Disease” 2023).\n\nWe can now understand how Poe was seen “moving rather stiffly” or how he appeared to have a “fit of delirium tremens, complete with visions” (Walsh 2000, 1–2). Again, we might see how he would move from a wonderful performance to a “weary and despondent arrival” (Walsh 2000, 19–20) or be found “laboring under an attack of mania a potu, and in a most shocking condition” (Walsh 2000, 36). Yet again, he was described with “tremor of the limbs … or active delirium … and vacant converse with spectral and imaginary objects on the walls” (qtd. in Walsh 2000, 41).\n\nPoe was once stuck in a “stooping position” (Dawidziak 2023, 124), which was likely caused by Parkinson’s (see “Parkinson’s Disease” 2023). Sometimes people claimed Poe had been drinking although they had not witnessed the fact. In so many other ways could Poe’s Parkinson’s have given a very mistaken idea. For instance, the final blow to his head was less likely from an attacker or a “drunken fall” (Walsh 2000, 116) than a fall caused by his Parkinson’s—which possibility no one apparently ever considered. The same may be said of an instance of Poe’s inability to walk (Walsh 2000, 44) and instances of other such states and events (Walsh 2000, 44–56).\n\nThe new theory of what probably caused many of Edgar Allan Poe’s reported behavioral elements during his final five days—his hallucinations, notable tremors, and so on—as being caused not by drink but by Parkinson’s disease should cause major revisions in Poe’s biography. It should indeed replace the excessive disparagement of Poe’s final years with a more truthful, insightful, and respectful portrait of this important American genius. It is a solved mystery of great consequence.\n\nNotes\n\nVidocq rose from petty criminal to police informer to undercover operative to the founder of the French Sûreté Nationale in 1811. He is also credited with creating the first private detective agency. Vidocq published his ghost-written memoir in 1829, popularizing the proverb “set a thief to catch a thief” (Morton 2012).\n\nWalsh (1963) was an erstwhile promoter of the authenticity of the Turin Shroud.\n\nReferences\n\nBenet’s Reader’s Encyclopedia, third edition. 1987.
