        "text": "Edgar Allan Poe, 40, passed October 7th 1849 in Baltimore of congestion of the brain. He was born Edgar Poe on January 19th 1809 in Boston, MA to David Poe Jr. and Elizabeth Poe, later John Allan and France's Allan. He was married to his first cousin, Virginia Clemm Poe on September 22nd 1835, who died of tuberculosis at age 24. He wrote short stories about his struggles in life and his misfortunes. He survived by his siblings, William and Rosalie Poe. He did not have any children or remaining immediate family. His stories will forever be a part of American Literature as pieces of art.\n\nOthers still think it was more than just alcohol that left Poe in such distress. During a medical conference in 1996 an anonymous patient named E.P was presented to a group of doctors. Their assignment was to examine E.P’s symptoms and from there conclude what caused his death. The article The (Still) Mysterious Death of Edgar Allan Poe explains,\n\nEdgar Allan Poe’s death was caused by the infamous act of cooping. He was found outside of a bar during voting time; delirious and dressed in second hand-clothes, he was later sent to Washington College Hospital to be taken care of. This theory is the most plausible because it explains why he was drugged, how they found him in other people’s clothes, and the reason why he was a victim of cooping.\n\nEdgar Allen Poe, known for his crazy writings, but what people question the most beside his stories is how did he die? There have been many theories circling around for how he has died. Two theories aare that he had rabbies or abused alcohol. Many people believe in different things and argue from very different points. However, Poe died of alcohol because, he has had a past with it in his younger years. Even though he gets sick from just one glass, he could of wanted to kill himself or had a withdraw and craved it.\n\n1). Poe went so far that he got into a point that he drank absinthe and brandy which is a really dangerous mixture (Poe, Drugs and Alcohol 27). Between the many possible causes of Edgar Allan Poe’s death, his problem with alcohol is really considerable as one important reason of his early death (Scharf, Douglas 1).\n\nThere are many theories of how Edgar Allan Poe died. One of the theories is alcohol. Poe was a heavy drinker as a young man so it is possible. Another theory is rabies. This is also a possible theory because of the symptoms he had in the hospital.\n\nHow did Edgar Allen Poe really die? It is a question that has been asked for years now that people are still trying to answer. There are numerous theories of how Poe died, the most popular being alcoholism and rabies. Most people at the time attributed Poe's death to alcoholism because of his dark past with alcohol. However, Poe died of rabies because he exhibited many signs of rabies, including hallucinations, delirium, and anger.\n\nHow did Edgar Allen Poe die is a question that has been pondered by people for centuries. Although we can not say for a fact how Poe died there have been many theories throughout the years some more likely than others. Although other theories provide good evidence and reasoning to how Poe died, it seems all of Poe’s symptoms were a classic case of rabies.\n\nThe death of Edgar Allen Poe is quite the mystery. No one knows what really happened to the failed poet that cold night, while he lay on the street. Many theories suggest that Poe was murdered by one of his many enemies or that he has brain cancer and died on the street. One theory I support is that Poe died from alcohol poisoning, there is quite a bit of evidence that supports Edgar Allen Poe passed from alcohol poisoning such as he became addicted to alcohol after his wife passed, he was found near a pub, and he had brain symptoms that pointed to alcoholism.\n\nOn Oct. 7, 1849, Edgar Allan Poe died mysteriously. While there are many theories about why or how he died, I believe that it is a unknown illness or cholera. First, a document by Poe it suggest that Edgar Allan Poe had contracted cholera weeks before arriving in Richmond and had a manic episode. Next, According to Susan Archer Talley, Poe was pale and trembling. His condition was serious enough that two doctors though he was in “imminent danger” and that another “attack would kill him. Then, in addition, John Moran claims that Poe had arrived at the hospital unconscious and remains in that condition from 5:00 pm until 3:00 am. When he wakes up he trembles and sweats profusely until the following day. Although no one will ever know for certain\n\nEdgar Allan Poe was known worldwide for his infamous and wicked tales of murder and revenge, which makes it ironic that his death is surrounded by controversy and suspicion. It is believed that Poe had many different causes of death - suicide, murder, cholera, Hypoglycemia, rabies, syphilis, and influenza. With much evidence to back this claim up, the most reasonable conclusion about Poe’s death was that he died of rabies.\n\nEdgar Allen Poe was a mysterious writer that was famous in the early 1800’s for his horror stories and mystery writings and poems. He died on October 7th, 1849, but his death cause is unknown and a very controversial topic. Two of the main guesses as to what Poe’s cause of death was is alcoholism and rabies. I believe that Poe’s death was caused by rabies because Poe’s symptoms were of rabies when he died, two doctors, Dr. Pollin and Dr. Benedetto, tried disproving his theory but could only do it with false information, and another well known doctor, Dr. Benitez backs up his theory that Poe died of rabies with scientific support that can’t be refuted.\n\nAccording to the CDC, over 88,000 people die every year due to the excessive use of alcohol in the United States. Now this proves that alcoholism is a very serious and common issue in our country. Poe’s death to this day has been thought of as a great mystery, most believing he died from either alcohol or rabies. According to several sources saying that Poe was sent to the hospital after being to drunk, not being able to tell doctors the names of his family members/where he lived, and the fact that his cat, Caterina, was proven to not have rabies, I believe he died from alcohol.\n\nEdgar Allen Poe Synthesis Essay: Alcoholism Edgar Allen Poe was a great writer who had a tragic death., and is a long controversy about how he died. There are many different theories of how he died, but no one knows how. One theory tells us that he could’ve died from alcoholism. Another theory points to rabies as a possible cause of death. However, alcoholism is the most reliable source because there is more information about his death of alcoholism than rabies."
