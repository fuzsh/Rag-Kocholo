        "text": "No subject regarding Edgar Allan Poe ignites as much controversy as his sudden death at the age of forty, which remains shrouded in mystery. What we know is that Poe planned trip from Richmond, Virginia to New York City, during which he traveled by steamer and stopped in Baltimore on September 28, 1849. His actions and whereabouts throughout the next five days are uncertain.\n\nWas Alcohol Involved?\n\nOn October 3, 1849, printer Joseph Walker found Poe inside or near Gunner's Hall tavern, and sent a note for J.E. Snodgrass, one of Poe’s acquaintances in Baltimore. Walker described Poe as appearing in \"great distress.”\n\nSnodgrass noted that the clothes Poe wore looked disheveled and out of place: \"he had evidently been robbed of his [own] clothing or cheated in an exchange.\" Snodgrass and his uncle, Henry Herring, both presumed that Poe was in a drunken state and agreed to send him to Washington College Hospital. Once there, Poe was taken to a room reserved for patients who were ill due to intoxication.\n\nPoe lapsed in and out of consciousness for the next few days, and according to Dr. John J. Moran, who questioned Poe about his condition, Poe's answers were incoherent and unsatisfactory. Moran also prevented visitors due to Poe’s “excitable” condition.\n\nMoran later noted in a letter to Maria Clemm, Poe’s mother-in-law, that during a period of consciousness, Poe held \"vacant converse with spectral and imaginary objects on the walls. His face was pale and his whole person drenched in perspiration.\" Poe died quietly before sunrise on Sunday, October 7, 1849.\n\nIt may be logical to assume that alcohol played a role in Poe's death, given that it intermittently surfaced as a negative influence during his adult life. But how does it explain why Poe was wearing somebody else's clothes? Nor does it provide any insight into the circumstances that caused him to be found in such an unfortunate state.\n\nWas Poe a Victim of Cooping?"
