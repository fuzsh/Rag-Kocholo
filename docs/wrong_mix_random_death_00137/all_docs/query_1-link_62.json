        "text": "A famous writer, a renowned poet, and a American hero, Edgar Allan Poe has helped shaped modern day literature. Taught in schools as being a tortured soul, Poe’s dark writing has shaped American English for the better. Edgar Allen Poe’s early demise came as a shock to many during the time. Poe left this world in a mystery, much like some of his most famous works. The way in which Poe died, is never as simple as it seems. The limited details of his demise has left a hole in American literature and history. Modern day textbooks such as Great American Stories detail his death in zero to none detail, “A week later, he was found near Baltimore tavern-delirious, his clothing torn and wet from a raging storm. He died four days later” (95). This\n\nDid you know that they still don’t know what caused the death of the famous spooky poet and author Edgar Allan Poe? Edgar was an American author and poet from the 1800’s who died from undetermined causes. There is still a great mystery surrounding Poe’s death and there are two main theories of what caused him to die. He died of alcoholism because he had a history with drinking, had a very rough life, and the rabies theories has some holes in it.\n\nEdgar Allen Poe, known for his crazy writings, but what people question the most beside his stories is how did he die? There have been many theories circling around for how he has died. Two theories aare that he had rabbies or abused alcohol. Many people believe in different things and argue from very different points. However, Poe died of alcohol because, he has had a past with it in his younger years. Even though he gets sick from just one glass, he could of wanted to kill himself or had a withdraw and craved it.\n\n1). Poe went so far that he got into a point that he drank absinthe and brandy which is a really dangerous mixture (Poe, Drugs and Alcohol 27). Between the many possible causes of Edgar Allan Poe’s death, his problem with alcohol is really considerable as one important reason of his early death (Scharf, Douglas 1).\n\nDying October 7, 1849, Edgar Allen Poe’s death has been studied by numerous experts. Living a life of heartbreaks and often struggling financially, Poe adopted the career of writing. The Cooping Theory, formulated by John R. Thomas, accurately justifies his death in comparison to opposing theories. Cooping is when political gangs kidnap people and force them to drink and continuously vote in order to increase their selected candidate’s chances of winning. A plethora of experts have claimed that Edgar Allen Poe died based on The Cooping Theory.\n\nPoe was taken from a tavern to the hospital days before death. He was seen in a drunken stupor, but some say this is not true. Others say that he was taken from a tavern but not drunk, rather sick from the elements. Another is he was found drunk on stairs. That theory is very unlikely for what every other source says.\n\nHow did Edgar Allen Poe really die? It is a question that has been asked for years now that people are still trying to answer. There are numerous theories of how Poe died, the most popular being alcoholism and rabies. Most people at the time attributed Poe's death to alcoholism because of his dark past with alcohol. However, Poe died of rabies because he exhibited many signs of rabies, including hallucinations, delirium, and anger.\n\nHow did Edgar Allen Poe die is a question that has been pondered by people for centuries. Although we can not say for a fact how Poe died there have been many theories throughout the years some more likely than others. Although other theories provide good evidence and reasoning to how Poe died, it seems all of Poe’s symptoms were a classic case of rabies.\n\nOn Oct. 7, 1849, Edgar Allan Poe died mysteriously. While there are many theories about why or how he died, I believe that it is a unknown illness or cholera. First, a document by Poe it suggest that Edgar Allan Poe had contracted cholera weeks before arriving in Richmond and had a manic episode. Next, According to Susan Archer Talley, Poe was pale and trembling. His condition was serious enough that two doctors though he was in “imminent danger” and that another “attack would kill him. Then, in addition, John Moran claims that Poe had arrived at the hospital unconscious and remains in that condition from 5:00 pm until 3:00 am. When he wakes up he trembles and sweats profusely until the following day. Although no one will ever know for certain\n\nThe alcoholism theory cannot be true because the curator at the Poe museum said that Poe couldn’t touch alcoholism at his older age or he would get very sick. In all, I believe that Poe’s death was caused by rabies because Poe’s symptoms were of rabies when he died, two doctors, Dr. Pollin and Dr. Benedetto, tried disproving his theory but could only do it with false information, and another well known doctor, Dr. Benitez backs up his theory that Poe died of rabies with scientific support that can’t be refuted. At the end of the day though, none of us really know how Poe\n\nAccording to the CDC, over 88,000 people die every year due to the excessive use of alcohol in the United States. Now this proves that alcoholism is a very serious and common issue in our country. Poe’s death to this day has been thought of as a great mystery, most believing he died from either alcohol or rabies. According to several sources saying that Poe was sent to the hospital after being to drunk, not being able to tell doctors the names of his family members/where he lived, and the fact that his cat, Caterina, was proven to not have rabies, I believe he died from alcohol.\n\n“Mr. Poe could not possibly send forth a book without some marks of his genius, and mixed up with the dross we find much sterling ore.” — (From a review of Poe’s Tales, September 6, 1845.) In 1845, Poe, 27, and Virginia, 13, married, and were happy for a time. In 1842, Virginia ruptured a blood vessel; the first sign of the ill health that plagued her short life. Poe turned to alcohol to cope with her illness and the stress of his dying wife. Two years later, Virginia died of tuberculosis, and Poe’s own death would follow shortly two years after that.\n\n“[He] attended a lot of funerals. When he wasn’t going to funerals, he wrote stories about dead people (or soon-to-be-dead people) living in torture chambers, haunted houses, and other creepy locales with zero chance of escape….” an author writes in Edgar Allan Poe's biography. Poe is an author who has experienced multiple catastrophic events could have done this. With much experience in death, Edgar Allan Poe had a brutal, devastating, and depressing life. Authors often write what they feel and experience in life. Surrounded by death most his stories too were about death. In the story The Tell-Tale Heart Poe writes about a man is killed because he has a hideous eye. One of his bestsellers, the Raven, is about a man who believes that a bird\n\nEdgar Allan Poe was an American writer, poet and critic. Poe is famous for his tales and poems of horror and mystery. During his lifetime he had multiple relatives that died from Tuberculosis. “Tuberculosis (TB) is a disease caused by bacteria that are spread through the air from person to person. If not treated properly, TB disease can be fatal” (CDC 1). During his childhood, his biological father left his mother and the year after that his mother died from TB. When he was orphaned he got “adopted” by John and Frances Allan in Virginia. Thanks to John he attended the University of Virginia where he had his first meetings with drinking and gambling. Poe was “forced to withdraw from the University of Virginia after only one year because of gambling debts” (Railton 1); Afterwards, because he was unable to support himself, he joined the United States Army, however the “court-martialed and dismissed from West Point for dereliction of duty”"
