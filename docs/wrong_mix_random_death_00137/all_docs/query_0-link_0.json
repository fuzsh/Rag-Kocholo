Other film roles include Joe Conner in Shooting Dogs (2005), Grigg Harris in The Jane Austen Book Club (2007), Luke Brandon in Confessions of a Shopaholic (2009), Adam Raki in Adam (2009) and Ted in Martha Marcy May Marlene (2011). On television, he portrayed criminal profiler Will Graham in the NBC television series Hannibal (2013–2015), Cal Roberts in the Hulu original series The Path (2016–2018) and Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex, in the Channel 4 miniseries Elizabeth I (2005); the latter role earned him a Primetime Emmy Award nomination. Dancy currently portrays Senior Assistant District Attorney Nolan Price on NBC's revival of the original Law & Order (2022–present).\n\nEarly life[]\n\nDancy was born in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire,[1] and raised in Newcastle-under-Lyme.[2] His mother, Sarah Ann Dancy (née Birley, born 1952),[3] works in academic publishing.[2] His father is philosophy professor Jonathan Dancy (born 1946), who teaches at the University of Reading and at the University of Texas at Austin.[3][4]\n\nHugh is the oldest of three children, followed by brother Jack Dancy (born 1977), who is co-director of the travel company Trufflepig Travel,[3][5] and sister Katharine Sarah Redman (née Dancy, born 1980). From the age of 5 to the age of 10, Dancy was educated at Edenhurst Preparatory School[6] in Newcastle-under-Lyme. At age 10, Dancy attended boarding school at the Dragon School in Oxford, then, at 13[1] at Winchester College.[2] At age 18, he acted in the Winchester College Players production of Twelfth Night, which was performed in both Winchester and at the Minack Theatre in Cornwall. He went on to study English at St Peter's College, Oxford.[1]\n\nCareer[]\n\nAfter graduation, Dancy moved to London, where a chance conversation in a cafe led to his meeting casting director Ros Hubbard and agent Dallas Smith, who signed him.[1] In 1999, Dancy appeared in the second series of Cold Feet in the role of Danny, who had a fleeting romance with Rachel, one of the show's main characters. In 2002, Dancy played Daniel Deronda in the BBC's adaptation of George Eliot's novel Daniel Deronda.[7]\n\nNotable roles from film include Dancy's Prince Charmont from the 2004 Disney film Ella Enchanted alongside Anne Hathaway and, from the same year, Galahad in King Arthur alongside later Hannibal co-star Mads Mikkelsen.[8] In 2005, he starred as Adam Raki in Adam, an independent film which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in 2009 and follows the story of a young man with an autism spectrum disorder.[9] He went on to appear in various other films.\n\nIn theatre, Dancy has appeared in MCC Theater's The Pride, written by Alexi Kaye Campbell, at the Lucille Lortel Theatre in New York City. The off-Broadway production was directed by Joe Mantello and co-starred Ben Whishaw and Andrea Riseborough. In 2007, Dancy had a starring role on Broadway as Captain Dennis Stanhope in Journey's End (Belasco Theatre). From 2010 until 2011, he starred in Manhattan Theatre Club's Broadway production of Venus in Fur alongside Nina Arianda. His performance was praised by The New York Times theatre critic Charles Isherwood.[10] In August 2018, it was announced he would appear with Stockard Channing in Roundabout Theatre Company's off-Broadway premiere of Apologia, written by Alexi Kay Campbell, in the dual roles of Peter and Simon.[11]\n\nIn March 2012, NBC announced that Dancy had been cast as Will Graham in Hannibal, the television adaptation based on the main character of Thomas Harris' 1981 novel Red Dragon.[12] The show received critical acclaim and was nominated for numerous awards. It was cancelled after three seasons and concluded in 2015, though there are hopes for its revival.[13] From 2016 to 2018, he appeared for three seasons as Cal Roberts, a lead character in Hulu's The Path, alongside Aaron Paul and Michelle Monaghan.[14][15] In November 2021 Dancy was announced as one of the leads in NBC's 2022 revival of Law & Order, playing an assistant district attorney.[16]\n\nPersonal life[]\n\nDancy met American actress Claire Danes on the set of Evening in Newport, Rhode Island, and they began dating.[17] In February 2009, they announced their engagement.[17] The couple married in France in 2009 in a private ceremony.[18] They have two children together, born in 2012[19] and 2018.[20][21]\n\nThey live in the West Village neighbourhood of New York City.[22]\n\nFilmography[]\n\nFilm[]\n\nYear Title Role Notes 2001 Black Hawk Down SFC Kurt Schmid Young Blades D'Artagnan 2003 Tempo Jack Ganzer The Sleeping Dictionary John Truscott 2004 King Arthur Galahad Ella Enchanted Prince Charmont 2005 Shooting Dogs Joe Connor 2006 Basic Instinct 2: Risk Addiction Adam Tower 2007 The Jane Austen Book Club Grigg Harris Evening Buddy Wittenborn Savage Grace Sam Green Blood & Chocolate Aiden 2009 Confessions of a Shopaholic Luke Brandon Adam Adam Raki Nominated–Satellite Award for Best Actor in a Motion Picture, Drama 2010 Coach Nick Direct-to-DVD The Wildest Dream Andrew Irvine Voice\n\nDocumentary 2011 Our Idiot Brother Christian Martha Marcy May Marlene Ted Nominated–Gotham Independent Film Award for Best Ensemble Performance Hysteria Dr. Mortimer Granville 2013 Legends of Oz: Dorothy's Return Marshal Mallow Voice Poe Edgar Allan Poe Voice 2018 Joseph Pulitzer: Voice of the People Alleyne Ireland 2019 Late Night Charlie Fain 2022 Downton Abbey: A New Era Jack Barber\n\nTelevision[]\n\nYear Title Role Notes 1998 Trial & Retribution Robert Belini 2 episodes The New Adventures of Robin Hood Kyle Episode: \"Orphans\" 1998–1999 Dangerfield Charlie Paige 2 episodes 1999 Cold Feet Danny 2 episodes Kavanagh QC Michael Woodley Episode: \"The More Loving One\" 2000 Relic Hunter Michael Previn Episode: \"The Last Knight\" David Copperfield David Copperfield Television film Madame Bovary Leon Television film 2002 Daniel Deronda Daniel Deronda 4 episodes 2005 Elizabeth I Earl of Essex 2 episodes\n\nNominated–Primetime Emmy for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Miniseries or a Movie\n\nNominated–Satellite Award for Best Actor in a Miniseries or a Motion Picture Made for Television 2011 The Big C Lee Fallon 8 episodes\n\nNominated--Gold Derby TV Award for Comedy Guest Actor (2012)\n\n2013–2015 Hannibal Will Graham 39 episodes\n\nInternational Online Cinema Award for Best Actor in Drama Series (2013)\n\nSaturn Award for Best Actor on Television (2015)\n\nNominated–Chainsaw Award for Best TV Actor (2015, 2016)\n\nNominated–Critics' Choice TV Award for Best Actor in a Drama Series (2014, 2016)\n\nNominated–Saturn Award for Best Actor on Television (2014) 2015 Deadline Gallipoli Ellis Ashmead Bartlett 2 episodes\n\nNominated–Silver Logie for Most Outstanding Actor (2016) 2016, 2018 Robot Chicken Various roles Voice\n\n2 episodes 2016–2018 The Path Cal Roberts 36 episodes\n\nAlso producer 2020 Homeland John Zabel 6 episodes 2020–2021 The Good Fight Caleb Garlin 4 episodes 2021 The Abominable Snow Baby Albert Voice\n\nTelevision film\n\n2022 Roar Detective Bobby Bronson Episode: \"The Woman Who Solved Her Own Murder\" 2022- Present Law & Order E.
