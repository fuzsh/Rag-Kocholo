        "text": "Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary … about how many Edgar Allan Poe sites there are on the east coast and why I needed to solve this mystery. I’d been on a road trip for over a year as I made my way up the east coast. The trip took several months, and as I went, I became confused; it seemed like every major city I visited had an Edgar Allan Poe house, room, site or museum. But how many could there be, I wondered? As I drove, they kept popping up, so I decided to figure out how this happened.\n\nEdgar Allan Poe was an American writer, poet, editor, and literary critic. He is best known for his poetry and short stories, particularly his tales of mystery and macabre. He was one of the first to write intuitive, psychological horror; his most famous is “The Raven.” Although Poe didn’t make much from The Raven, it led to international success and opportunities enabling him to become the first American writer to live entirely from his earnings.\n\nWhen I travel, I frequently visit the sites attributed to writers and artists, and Poe was an intriguing study, especially as I kept stumbling upon Poe sites. It seemed they had no end.\n\n1 EDGAR AND ANNABEL LEE IN CHARLESTON, SOUTH CAROLINA\n\nI was in Charleston on a late-night ghost walk when I learned of my first Edgar Allen Poe site. While there, I heard the story told a few different ways about a possible Poe love story. I had no idea he had a Charleston connection, but the story I heard was juicy. The guides say Annabel Lee Ravenel, the teenage daughter of one of the city’s wealthiest families, had an “unworthy” lover, forbidden by her father from 1827–1828.\n\nIt’s said the father went to extreme lengths to keep the lovers apart, and when the girl died from one of the common diseases, he had her buried in an unmarked grave in the Unitarian Graveyard so her lover wouldn’t know where she was and couldn’t visit. The girl, brokenhearted even in death, is said to haunt the old graveyard still, looking for her lost lover and wearing the unworn wedding dress she’d bought for a planned elopement.\n\nDuring the same time, Poe, who had lied about his age and used a false name, was in the Army. He went by the name Edgar Perry and was stationed at Fort Moultrie on Sullivan’s Island in Charleston. The last poem he published more than 20 years later is “Annabel Lee.” It reads in part:\n\nAnd this was the reason that, long ago,\n\nIn this kingdom by the sea,\n\nA wind blew out of a cloud, chilling\n\nMy beautiful Annabel Lee;\n\nSo that her highborn kinsman came\n\nAnd bore her away from me,\n\nTo shut her up in a sepulchre\n\nIn this kingdom by the sea.\n\nWhat a mystery! Sites in Charleston named for Poe include the Poe Library, 1921 Ion Ave., and Poe’s Tavern, both on Sullivan’s Island.\n\n2 THE POE HOUSE AND DORM IN RICHMOND, VIRGINIA\n\nAs I made my way up the coast, I stopped in Virginia. Before I knew it, I heard about more Edgar Allan Poe sites.\n\nAs a child, in 1811, Poe’s mother died in Richmond, where he was adopted and later attended the University of Virginia at Charlottesville. They’ve enshrined Poe’s old dorm and called it “The Raven’s Room.” It’s used by, wait for it, the Raven Society. You can see it through a plexiglass partition. Find it at 3 West Range on the University of Virginia campus.\n\nA few years before he attended the college, however, he was part of a junior honor color guard that escorted Revolutionary War General Marquis de Lafayette around the city. They stopped for a visit with the family living in Richmond’s Old Stone House. That house is now The Poe Museum, which holds the most extensive collection of the author’s original writing and possessions. Find it at 1914 E Main Street, Richmond, VA 23223.\n\nPoe would come back to Richmond repeatedly and live there for several years.\n\n3 EDGAR ALLAN POE HOUSE AND MUSEUM IN BALTIMORE, MARYLAND\n\nPoe not only lived in Baltimore, but it’s also where he died and is buried. As a taphophile, who often visits famous graves, this is where I started to get interested in unraveling the many sites of Poe. I began by visiting his former home.\n\nThe Edgar Allan Poe House and Museum is where he lived in with his aunt Maria Clemm and her daughter, Virginia, during much of the 1830s. It’s now a museum and displays exhibits about the writer’s life. The house is a small two-and-a-half-story brick duplex on the end of a series of row houses.\n\nAt the Poe house, you enter a small parlor. Now it’s the gift shop, with memorabilia, artifacts and information mixed with a display of glassware and china, a telescope used by Poe, a traveling desk and other items. Each of the five rooms has period-appropriate artifacts and signage detailing Poe’s life in Baltimore. The most interesting part is the upstairs attic.\n\nYou reach it by a tightly winding staircase so narrow you nearly must crawl into the room at the top. The ceiling slopes dramatically on either side, like the letter A. There was a rough cot bed, a chair and a chest with pair of men’s boots next to it. A book, candle, quill and ink well sat on the chest, where he likely penned many stories. A black raven perches in the window.\n\nFind Edgar Allan Poe House and Museum at №3 Amity, Baltimore.\n\nFun Fact: In a confusing turn, there is yet another “Edgar Allan Poe House” in Fayetteville, North Carolina. But this house and this person have nothing to do with the poet. It is an entirely different person, not related. How’s that for odd?\n\nLater in life, Poe would come back to Baltimore, only to die a tragic and mysterious death, but before he died, he lived in a few other places, and I was about to stumble upon the next one.\n\n4 EDGAR ALLAN POE SITES IN PHILADELPHIA, PENNSYLVANIA\n\nAs I traveled up the east coast to visit Philadelphia, I wasn’t surprised to find another of the Edgar Allan Poe sites.\n\nUnable to find work in the late 1830s, Poe moved to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and lived six years in various places. His only surviving residence is a small house within walking distance of the Liberty Bell and Independence Hall. Today the National Park Service maintains the home as the Edgar Allan Poe National Historic Site.\n\nFun Fact: This home the author once rented has been preserved as it was when he lived there. One fun feature the guides point out is the original floorboards are loose and creaky, and historians speculate it may be where Poe got the idea for “The Tell-Tale Heart.” A story about a man who hides the body parts of a victim under his floorboards!\n\nFind it at 532 N. 7th Street, Philadelphia, P\n\n5 POE IN BOSTON\n\nWhen I was in Boston, I learned, to nobody’s surprise, that Poe was born there and briefly lived there for some time in adulthood. It’s where he published his first book “Tamerlane and Other Poems” under the pseudonym “A Bostonian.”\n\nPoe was born in Boston on Jan. 19, 1809, in a house the city has since demolished, but city leaders renamed a plaza across the street, not far from Boston Common, the “Common Edgar Allan Poe Square.” On the square, they’ve put a bronze statue of Poe that looks like he’s rushing down the street, a raven flying next to him.\n\nFun Fact: Poe disdained Boston residents and called them croaking “Frogpondians,” in reference to the Frog Pond in the Boston Common near where his statue now resides.\n\n6 THE EDGAR ALLAN POE COTTAGE IN NEW YORK CITY\n\nAs I travel up the coast and look for things to see and do, I’m hardly surprised to find other Edgar Allan Poe sites to which there now seems no end. It is here, in the Bronx, where Poe had a small country cottage and found fame after publishing “The Raven” in 1845.\n\nNYC Parks maintains the Edgar Allan Poe Cottage in New York City, where Poe works as an editor and critic.\n\nFun Fact: The city moved the home from its original location a few blocks north to widen a road.\n\nIf that’s not enough Edgar Allan Poe sites, there’s also a building in Greenwich Village. There you’ll find a plaque dedicated to Poe, who briefly lived there too. NYU’s Furman Hall replaced the building, but architects made its façade resemble the original 1845 structure. It’s where he would have lived while editing “The Raven” for publication. A room in Furman Hall is also dedicated to Poe.\n\n7 & 8 POE GRAVE SITE(S)\n\nShame on you if, by now, you thought Poe had only grave. Of course, he has two. After New York, Poe moved back to Richmond, Virginia, and on Sept 26, 1849, set sail on a trip with a stop in Baltimore. What happened after he disembarked is a mystery. There is no record of anyone seeing him again until Oct. 3, when people at a tavern in Gunner’s Hall in Baltimore believed him severely drunk and had him taken to a hospital. Poe was delirious and raving mad at the hospital, where he continued nonsensical raving and could not tell anyone what had happened. After four days of madness, he died.\n\nHis family buried him in a family plot in the back of the Westminster Burying Grounds, in an unmarked grave. Over the years, the site became derelict, so supporters raised funds to move it to the front of the cemetery. They had Poe exhumed and buried under a large memorial marker with Virginia and Aunt Clemm at the front of the church.\n\nThe square granite monument is 6 feet on each side and features a bas-relief bust of Poe, with the dates 1809 and 1849. And thus, the mystery of the many Edgar Allan Poe site ends. Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.”"
