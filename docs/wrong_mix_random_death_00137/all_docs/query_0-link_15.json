This was even more true of Canada than of the United States, for the initial settlement of most of the English-speaking portions of British North America took place later than occurred in the United States. Not surprisingly, any good university research library has several hundred feet of shelves filled with books, monographs, and journals that describe and analyse the process of migration from the Old World to the New. What is surprising is that almost all of the historical literature, both as pertains to Canada and to the United States, is devoted to discussing emigration from the Old World and immigration into the New as an abstract process or an aggregate phenomenon. That is, there are sophisticated statistical studies of the nineteenth-century data on the migration flow, and there are innumerable general descriptions of the general background of the immigrants in their homeland and accompanying assertions of how these affect them in their new homelands. But studies that deal with actual migrants and which trace the lives of a significant number of real people - not aggregated census numbers - from one side of the ocean through their successive residences and careers on the other, are very rare. The most notable exception is Jon Gjerde's From Peasants to Farmers: The Migration from Balestrand, Norway, to the Upper Middle West (Cambridge 1985). Of course, there are numerous biographies of individual migrants and even more numerous pieces of family history put together by filially pious genealogists, but these are too unsystematic, too tiny a subset, to permit their being the basis of meaningful conclusions about migrants in general. One notes with admiration the many local studies of nineteenth-century ethnic communities, but almost invariably these start with the group's arrival on this side of the Atlantic and do not document with adequate precision the origin of the various individuals in the given community in the Old World. Thus,\n\nxvi\n\nForeword\n\nobservations about the nature of migration and about the process of cultural transfer cannot be drawn with the confidence that one would like. That is why Bruce Elliott's study is such a breakthrough. He traces with precision the life paths of hundreds of individual migrants, pinpointing their place of origin in the Old World and tracing with equal precision their life, course in the New. This is done with a significant number of individuals drawn from a similar background, so that one can generalize about the migration process as it occurred in this group. Most important, one can draw these generalizations not from frequently misleading aggregate statistics, but from observations of the lives of specific individuals. Elliott's methods, if widely adopted, have the potential to do for nineteenth-century migration history what the development of prosopography did for classical studies. Because historians for the most part have been dismissive of the activities of genealogists - who has not been inconvenienced in some archive or research library by enthusiasts tracing their family histories? - there is likely to be resistance among historians to undergoing an apprenticeship in the techniques of genealogical research. Also, scholars in search of a topic that will pay off quickly are apt to be put off by the sheer amount of hard slogging that is required in such research. However, that Elliott could trace 775 families should be taken not only as a monument to his own scholarly devotion (which certainly it is), but also as an indication that nineteenthcentury migration studies indeed can be done without taking the shortcuts that have become virtually habitual in the field. The people whom Elliott studies, the Irish, were the largest non-French ethnic group in nineteenth-century Canada. Among the Irish, Protestants were in a roughly 2:1 ratio to Catholics. Thus, in dealing with a group of Irish Protestants, Elliott is not studying an exotic species, but one of the major groups defining the cultural complexity of this country during the last century. One hopes that this book will be read as much by historians of the United States as by those of Canada, for the Irish in the United States are one of the most important of nineteenth-century immigrant groups and one of the least understood. Despite the existence of hundreds of studies of the Irish in North America, there is not a single book that traces at a satisfactory level of accuracy and analytical sophistication the paths of a significant number of migrants to, and through, the United States or Canada. In that context, Bruce Elliott's work serves as a useful model. Donald Harman Akenson, FRSC Queen's University, Kingston\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nA microstudy of 775 families soon assumes major proportions, and inevitably one's debts to others increase proportionally. I am grateful to the Ontario Ministry of Colleges and Universities, the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, and Carleton University for the awards which supported me during the research and writing of this study, to Professors Fernand Ouellet, S.F. Wise, and B. Carman Bickerton who wrote in support of my applications, and to the Advisory Research Committee of Queen's University for material assistance during revision of the manuscript. The book has been published with the help of a grant from the Canadian Federation for the Humanities, using funds provided by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada. This study has benefited from the comments and interest of academics and fellow students. Among the former I must note Donald Akenson, Marilyn Barber, John Clarke, David Fitzpatrick, Robert and Peter Goheen, Keith Johnson, and especially S.R. Mealing, my critical yet tolerant thesis supervisor at Carleton University, and among my fellow students Joe Goski, Jim Kennedy, Glenn Lockwood, Mary Lu MacDonald, Christina Thiele, and John D. Blackwell (who alone of the six can claim Tipperary ancestry). Catharine Anne Wilson provided an especially useful critique of the manuscript. I am grateful also to Dan Brock, whose MA thesis on the Richard Talbot emigration is the starting point for any study of the Tipperary Protestants in the Canadas, for generously sharing his early settler files and for giving me access to his own material and to the files of London Branch, Ontario Genealogical Society, then in his keeping. Jemima Thompson of Port Coquitlam, BC, first directed me to Dan's thesis. Those familiar with the \"Leicester School\" of English local history will notice some of its influences in these pages. The exploration of settlement patterns and of contrasting communities, and the estate typology, among other things, owe something to my time at Leicester. Carleton University, the\n\nxviii Acknowledgments\n\nUniversity of Ottawa, Algonquin College, the Ottawa, London, and Kingston branches of the Ontario Genealogical Society, the Carleton Place Historical Society, the Historical Society of Ottawa, the Ontario Historical Society, and the Canadian Historical Association all provided forums in which I presented earlier drafts of several sections of this work. The assistance of the archivists and librarians of the various repositories listed in the note on sources was essential to the success of this project. The co-ordinating efforts of the Ontario Genealogical Society enabled me to tap into an indispensable network of 180 correspondents, listed in the note on sources. Special thanks are due to Lois Long of Nepean and Gail Clothier and Laurena Storey of London, Ontario. All three shared a wide range of genealogical information on a regular basis and put me in contact with other people of Tipperary background. Gail and Bill Clothier and the Storey family provided me with places to stay during research trips to London, as did Bruce and Twyla Atchison. Providing accommodation when I was researching in the other London were Margaret Horton of Berkhamsted, Herts, and, for especially lengthy periods, Sally Jollans Butler, formerly of Stoke Newington but now of Onehunga, Auckland. I have also to thank Sally for obtaining New Zealand death certificates for me since moving to the South Pacific. I am grateful to John D. Blackwell for providing me with accommodation in Kingston, and in Toronto I was housed by Colm J. Brannigan and, on numerous occasions, by J. Brian Gilchrist. At the production stage, I am grateful to Ross Hough for redrafting many of the maps, and to my copy-editor, Rosemary Shipton. My greatest debt is to my own family, who have no connection with North Tipperary, but who have inevitably come to know more about the place than anyone else who has no particular interest in it. They will, nonetheless, be happy to have the documentation of these Irishmen off the living-room floor, and out of three other rooms of the house it now largely occupies.

Staunch supporters of the established Church of Ireland at home, most of the Tipperary Protestant emigrants supported the United Church of England and Ireland in Canada. The first Anglican service in London Township was held in 1822 in the barn of William Geary, son-in-law of the rector of Templeharry, King's County. The frame church was built the following year. It was extensively rennovated by carpenter John Haskett in 1845 and was replaced by the present brick building in 1875. In the churchyard lie the remains of many of the earliest members of the township's Tipperary community.

As superintendent of the Richmond military settlement, Burke located some of Richard Talbot's Tipperary settlers in Goulbourn and Nepean townships in 1818. Burke, a native of Tipperary himself, had known some of the emigrants in Ireland. A member of an old Catholic gentry family, he was nonetheless required as an army officer to be a Protestant. However, most of his family remained Catholic, and the Anglican minister of Bytown officiated at Burke's interment in the Roman Catholic cemetery at Richmond.

As resident agent in Biddulph Township for the Canada Land Company, Hodgins encouraged many of his fellow Tipperary emigrants to settle there. Violent, intemperate, and quarrelsome, Hodgins nonetheless won for himself a favoured position in the new land. In return for leading gangs of Tipperary bully boys at the elections in favour of Canada Company candidates, he was rewarded with land and the posts of magistrate and lieutenant-colonel of militia.

Frank emigrated in 1821 to Montreal, where he joined a small cluster of friends from Tipperary for a few years, working as a sawyer to build up capital to commence a farm. He moved to Nepean in the Ottawa Valley around 1828. Never an extensive landowner, he used his influence in the Orange Order to secure apprenticeships for his sons as printers with local Orange newspapers.

It is only through this type of study, linking Irish and Canadian experiences, that we can begin to answer certain important questions about the nature of immigration and settlement and about the economic and societal consequences on both sides of the Atlantic of the massive nineteenth-century displacement of Irish population. Sources for the study of Irish emigration to Canada consist of runs of aggregate statistical material, supplemented by a few collections of qualitative and nominal information. The latter are particularly rich for atypical assisted movements such as those of the government-sponsored Peter Robinson emigrants of the 18205. Even the statistical material is problematic, however, and we are almost totally lacking passenger lists for the pre-i855 period when Irish emigration to Canada was most intensive.1 Cecil Houston and William Smyth recently attempted to study Irish immigration indirectly through the use of a \"better source,\" the Canadian census. Houston and Smyth, and Donald Akenson in a similar article, manipulated aggregate ethnicity and religion data from the printed census abstracts to describe the characteristics of Ontario's Irish immigrants in the broadest terms. Their studies have shown that two-thirds of the Irish in Upper Canada were Protestants throughout the nineteenth century and that, contrary to stereotype, the Irish, both Protestants and, to a slightly lesser degree, Roman Catholics, were as rural a people as the rest of the Canadian population.2 Unfortunately the aggregate approach, however useful, cannot help us to answer a number of more specific, important questions. In the absence of nominal lists of passengers and of immigrants we cannot begin even to link\n\n4 Irish Migrants in the Canadas\n\nrecords of immigration with those of settlement. As a consequence we must find other ways to discover the geographical and social origins of immigrants, the directions and volumes of migration corridors, the settlement patterns in the new land, and the direction, nature, and volume of subsequent internal migration. The only way of doing this is to study the migrants individually to determine their social and regional origins, their economic circumstances at home, their dates of departure and subsequent migrational histories, their process of settlement in Canada and their lives there, and then to move beyond to try to understand the key decisions of the life course in terms of the people's own aims and strategies. The technique amounts to family reconstitution and individual biography pursued on a wide scale. Most family reconstitution projects have been undertaken within strictly delimited municipal boundaries, and the authors of such studies have consequently been criticized for basing their demographic profiles of society on the possibly atypical experiences of non-migrants. Discussion of migrants has been limited to determining mobility rates (generally found to have been high)3 and to tracing the broad demographic characteristics of those who left a particular place. We learn nothing about the experiences of the migrants before they arrived in the subject community nor about their destinations or ultimate fates following their departures from it. Even when one does undertake the laborious task of tracking the destinations of those who left a particular municipality, the results of the investigation will not always provide evidence of the processes involved, for political boundaries often cut apart and render unrecognizable the areas from which the migrants are drawn or in which they settle.4 Chain migration, in which one emigrant is followed by another, who is followed by others in turn, draws upon kin groups, the members of which need not necessarily have lived close together before the move.5 For this reason, the most sensible way to commence a study of internal migration using family reconstitution techniques is to begin with immigration. An investigation such as the present one requires the linkage of records on both sides of the Atlantic to build up the individual cases,and eventually a profile of the immigrants generally. We can have no idea even of the make-up of the immigrating family until the genealogy has been completed using records dating from many years both before and after the move in which the investigator is interested. This wide-ranging approach to family reconstitution may be new to Canadian academics,6 but its necessity is a commonplace to genealogists, who confront the individual implications of high rates of population mobility every day in their research. Linkage on such a massive scale does necessitate some regional limitation, and in this study I have traced the movements around Ontario and Quebec of people coming from a common overseas place of origin, North Tipperary,\n\n5 Introduction\n\nIreland, delimiting the region of origin in terms of social rather than political boundaries, but remaining cognizant of movement to other parts of the world. Understanding the migrants in such a context also requires a detailed examination of the communities at both ends of the migration corridors investigated. The present study is therefore, to some degree, also an exercise in Irish and Canadian local history. A study focusing on actual Irish men and women and linking their experiences at home and abroad can at least attempt to avoid the mythologies about the Irish that have grown up on both sides of the ocean. The biased and erroneous perceptions that prevail at home and abroad are not unrelated. To a major degree it is the folksy image North Americans have of Irish society which lies behind their tendency to view the Irish emigrant as ill-equipped for pioneer life - as a failure, a belligerent rebel, and a fundamentally emotional and irrational soul.7 The Atlantic islands and the rocky, scenic west still largely define Ireland to the academic no less than to the tourist, but North Tipperary was very different from the regions studied by the Victorian reformers and romantics and by twentieth-century anthropologists. Such studies have focused upon marginal communities tied to the sea more than to the land, isolated by poor communications, where the Gaelic language survives, or did till recently, where the population was Roman Catholic, where estates were large and the landlords seldom seen, and where the farms were miserably small and dependent upon potato culture.8 By contrast, North Tipperary in the early nineteenth century was an area of commercial agriculture and improving communications, with both large and small farms aggregated into the small estates of a numerous, resident, but economically precarious minor gentry. North Tipperary was economically more backward than the southern parts of the county, but this was as true in the sixteenth century as it was in the nineteenth. The mountains hemming in the district may have facilitated the survival of partnership farming and primitive agricultural methods in the hills themselves, but the strong demesne agriculture of the Ormond plain is merely one of many elements that gave evidence of a strong market orientation. Culturally, too, North Tipperary was not a traditional society. The Irish language was dead in the region by i82O.9 Faction fighting in the region was viewed as barbarous both by Dublin Castle and by O'Connell's Association, but it has not been proved that faction fighting was a traditional form of violence. It has recently been suggested, indeed, that such struggles may have been led by members of an emerging middle class.10 Neither were the agrarian disturbances for which the area became infamous in the second quarter of the nineteenth century traditional in the region. They reflected the people's conservative, defensive attachment to the status quo, but that status quo was of the nineteenth century. The disturbances themselves were a reaction against the economic consequences\n\n6 Irish Migrants in the Canadas\n\nof the nineteenth-century conjuncture of North Tipperary's distinctive social and tenurial structure with an atypically high continuing rate of population growth. Akenson has argued that the Irish emigrant adjusted well to North American rural life. He had typically been the manager of a small-scale commercial farm at home and the skills necessary to succeed in pioneer agriculture were certainly not beyond his abilities and have in any case been vastly exaggerated.11 Akenson has shown that in one Ontario township on the St Lawrence River the Protestant Irish were not only successful farmers but possessed a sense of group identity and an aggressive assertiveness that enabled them to assume cultural and political dominance in their adopted region. What is perhaps more surprising is his demonstration that the small Catholic community there was apparently even more prosperous than the Protestants.12 However, the aims of the Irish as farmers and the means by which they succeeded, as opposed to the statistical evidence that their farms were more developed than those of their Canadian-born neighbours,13 remain unexplored, and we are not told how or why the members of the small Catholic community succeeded so well, merely that they did. Culturally, too, the Irish of Leeds and Lansdowne remain anonymous followers of the Orange politician Ogle Gowan. We are not told where they came from or why, we are given only broad suggestions of when they arrived, and we learn little about their individual as opposed to their collective objectives. Success can be measured in many ways. Objective measures of relative economic success mean little in areas like those settled in greatest numbers by the Tipperary emigrants, where the Irish were among the earliest inhabitants and where they constituted a majority of the population. The cultivation of a large acreage in itself is evidence neither of success nor of rationality. One Canadian social historian has argued that the expansion of acreage was a counterproductive squandering of valuable resources.14 We must judge the success of the Irish in terms of their own aims and ambitions. The Irish of this study were rational men and women who crossed the Atlantic after weighing carefully the advantages and disadvantages of remaining where they were. Immediate economic difficulties provided a reason to move but were not paramount in their deliberations. Betterment of self was less important to them than was providing a secure start in life for the rising generation.15 Migration in this sense was a strategy of heirship and, as such, it was sometimes merely one of a number of options.16 The family played another role in migration, too. If the prospect of economic distress stimulated the decision to migrate, the location of distant kin, more than soil capability, nearness of markets, and transportation routes, influenced the choice of destination. Even those who emigrated as victims in the Famine years of the 18408 made their way to relatives who had gone to Canada before\n\n7 Introduction\n\nthem. The family, like class, is not so much a structure to be quantified as a functional socio-economic unit which must be understood. There are several reasons for limiting this study to Protestants. Some of them are practical. Though sources for the study of Protestants in Tipperary leave much to be desired, materials concerning the Roman Catholic population are in a much worse state. Despite the destruction of some Church of Ireland parish registers in the bombardment of the Four Courts in 1922, many of those surviving for North Tipperary date from early in the nineteenth century and several date back to the eighteenth. Catholic registers were not in the Four Courts during the Civil War, but they generally begin very late. Few date from before the late 18205, and many start only in the 18305 or 18405; only one antedates 1800.n The paucity of register information is more serious in the case of Catholics than it is for Protestants because of the lack of alternative sources with which to identify emigrating families. The index to diocesan marriage licence bonds identifies many Protestant emigrants with the region, but Catholics were married by licence only when marrying across religious lines. The Catholic population was nearly twelve times as numerous as the Protestant in North Tipperary, and Catholic families bearing the more common surnames numbered in the hundreds. It is impossible to identify an emigrating John Ryan with any of dozens of that name in tithe and valuation records without further information. In addition, the large county of Tipperary was divided among several socio-economic regions, any one of which can be meant by a Canadian reference to \"Tipperary,\" the most accurate statement of origin one usually finds. It is therefore difficult to delineate regional patterns of migration of the Catholic population, but easier to do so for the Protestants, who were far fewer in numbers, left better records behind them, and lived mostly in two areas in the northernmost baronies of the county. The Tipperary Catholics remained a distinct people. Some emigrating Protestant families were of ultimate Catholic descent and a few were of \"mixed\" religion, but of the 775 families followed in this study the numbers of mixed families can be counted on the fingers of two hands. There was very little intermarriage between the two groups in Canada. Because family was the major mechanism of chain migration, the process may be studied adequately by confining detailed research to Protestant and mixed families. Identified origins of the residents of the Tipperary Catholic communities in Biddulph and Nepean suggest that these two settlements drew upon the same northern baronies as did the adjacent Protestant colonies, and certainly their presence there was due to earlier Protestant emigration. Therefore, brief accounts of the major North Tipperary Catholic colonies are included in chapter 6.18 This study begins in Ireland by examining the geography, economy, and society of the North Tipperary region, probing the origins and spread of the\n\n8 Irish Migrants in the Canadas\n\nProtestant population there, examining the social and economic conditions that disposed them to look favourably upon emigration, and pinpointing the stimuli that initiated the flow of people to the Canadas. After examining the course and character of Protestant emigration from Tipperary, the focus switches to Canada, where a general consideration of Irish settlement patterns is followed by an examination of the origins and growth of the two largest Tipperary colonies in the context of the settlement history of the regions in which they were located. Internal migration, pointing up the continuance of chain migration as a major mechanism of population movement, emphasizes the continuing importance of the family in Canada, and the work closes by viewing migration as one of several strategies adopted by families in the pursuit of their desire to provide for the rising generation. One of the most articulate members of a North Tipperary emigrant family summed up her own story in words that have a wider application: \"In Canada we are developing a pattern of life and I know something about one block of that pattern. I know it for I helped to make it, and I can say that now without any pretense of modesty, or danger of arrogance, for I know that we who make the patterns are not important, but the pattern is.\"19 Often these patterns change, or are obscured by the passage of time. It is then the historian's task to recreate the patterns by tracing the individual lives and histories of those who made them. The writer of those words, author and pioneer feminist Nellie McClung, is herself the best argument against urging the primacy of patterns over the importance of the individual. But the historical individual assumes meaning as he or she exemplifies or departs from the pattern, and the pattern becomes reality, rather than an analytical abstraction, only when it can be proved to reflect the collective tendencies of individuals.\n\nCHAPTER TWO\n\nThe Protestants of North Tipperary\n\nTHE NORTH TIPPERARY SOCIAL REGION\n\nThe North Tipperary of this study is not an artificial unit that serves political, administrative, or data-collecting functions but means little on the ground. The area to which I refer for ease of reference as North Tipperary constitutes a geographical entity even though for most of recent history it has not been organized as a single political unit. Separated from surrounding areas by major topographical features, the various administrative zones that in different eras have subdivided this section of the Shannon Valley have historically as well as geographically had more in common with one another than with the political entities that lay beyond the region's natural boundaries of hill and bog. The term North Tipperary as used here is therefore a form of shorthand, sometimes used by the emigrants who are the focus of this study, by which the Offaly panhandle and the border parishes are meant as well as the northern part of the administrative county of Tipperary. At the time of the Cromwellian invasion in the 16405 North Tipperary had a scattered population and was essentially pastoral, while the southeastern baronies of the county were dotted with small farming villages and numerous corn mills.1 Well into the nineteenth century North Tipperary remained more economically backward and less densely populated than the more fertile lands of the Suir Valley immediately to the south. It was these very circumstances, however, that facilitated the clearance of new cultivated lands from the wood and bog by new English settlers in the late seventeenth century. The descendants of these colonists, numbering some ten thousand in i82O,2 formed the only appreciable concentration of Protestant population in County Tipperary apart from clusters in the towns and administrative centres of the southern part of the county. As in most of Ireland, the people of Tipperary have depended for a living upon agriculture. The county comprises several distinct farming regions distinguished by differing soils and economies, set apart by low, rugged hills of thin soil resting on slate and sandstone. Much of the southern and central\n\nio Irish Migrants in the Canadas\n\nMAP i County Tipperary was an administrative unit, but not a social region. We are concerned with the area north of the mountain range, including the panhandle of King's County that sticks southwest into Tipperary, between Cloughjordan and Roscrea. Source: Lewis' s Atlas, 1837.\n\n11 The Protestants of North Tipperary\n\nportion of the county consists of \"lime-rich drift-covered lowlands drained by the river Suir,\"3 a region \"exuberantly fertile.\" To the west, on the borders of Limerick, lie the heavy grasslands of the Golden Vale. The northern third of the county, to the north of the Keeper range, comprises the Shannon plain of North Tipperary with which this study is concerned. In the early nineteenth century the low mountain ranges that mark its southern limit were wild tracts of territory forming barriers more formidable than their height, measuring in the hundreds of feet, would suggest.4 The lowland of North Tipperary is for the most part flat, though it becomes gently rolling as it descends to the northwest towards the Shannon. As in the Ottawa Valley to which many of its residents emigrated in the nineteenth century, the line of low, rocky hills that marks its perimeter is always visible on the horizon. The vale of North Tipperary so defined measures roughly twenty miles wide by thirty miles long, commencing some ten miles east of the City of Limerick and lying between the River Shannon and the gentle northeastward sweep of the Keeper, Silvermine, Devilsbit, and Slieve Bloom mountains. These heights form a single range of hills forty miles in length, declining from slate mountains in the west into low sandstone hills to the east. These natural features roughly enclose the baronies of Upper and Lower Ormond in Tipperary and the western panhandle of King's County, now known as County Offaly. To the northeast, beyond Birr, the plain of occupied land deteriorates to a maze of small pieces of arable and pasture scattered in patches amongst extensive bogland that becomes ever more dominant and emerges in central Offaly as Ireland's vast Bog of Allen. On the northwestern boundary of Tipperary the Shannon widens to form Lough Derg, on the northern shore of which lies the village of Mountshannon. Isolated by mountains from the rest of County Galway,5 the social links of Mountshannon's people were across the river with Tipperary. The same comment largely applies to other border parishes such as Ogonnelloe and Killaloe, in Clare, and Stradbally (Castle Connell) in County Limerick. As a social region, North Tipperary may be said to dip south through passes in the mountains as far as the estate market town of Templemore, but beyond that area the historical associations and migratory and surname patterns of the people were quite distinct.6 Historically, as well as geographically, economically, and socially, North Tipperary may be viewed as a distinct region. The area defined above as North Tipperary corresponds almost exactly with the eastern portion of the Church of Ireland diocese of Killaloe,7 which perpetuates the ancient boundaries of the medieval diocese of that name. In Ireland, as in England, the diocesan boundaries derive from civil boundaries existing at the time of diocesan organization, in Ireland the twelfth century.8 The diocese of Killaloe, centred upon the cathedral town of that name on the Shannon between Clare and Tipperary, approximated the ancient boundaries of the principality of\n\n12\n\nIrish Migrants in the Canadas\n\nMAP 2 North Tipperary parishes and dioceses. Source: Adapted from LDS Irish Probates Register.\n\nThomond, and comprised all of County Clare, the parishes of Inniscaltra and Clonrush (the Mountshannon area of Galway), the Ely O'Carroll territory in what is now the Offaly panhandle, and the North Tipperary baronies of Ikerrin, Upper and Lower Ormond, and the western half of Clanwilliam. The County Limerick portion of Thomond, except the Union of Stradbally (Castle Connell), was separated from Killaloe and attached to Limerick probably as a result of forfeitures following the Desmond rebellion. For a short period in the late twelfth century the portion of the diocese east of the Shannon became a separate see centred upon Roscrea, where the remains of some of the structures associated with this period may yet be seen, but the new diocese was soon after reunited with Killaloe.9 More recent administrative divisions perpetuate later events in the civil history of the region, from the incursion or infiltration of Irish clans up to the eve of the Cromwellian invasion in the 16405, but the socio-economic region of North Tipperary corresponds closely with eastern Thomond, a principality bounded here by natural geographical barriers. It has been noted by a number of authors that the tenurial and social relics of ancient Irish culture lingered in North Tipperary long after they were extinct in most of the country outside the far west. To a very large degree this was due to the expulsion from the region of the twelfth-century Anglo-Norman\n\n13 The Protestants of North Tipperary\n\ninvaders following a rebellion in the thirteenth century by the O'Kennedys, the dominant family in what were to become the Ormond baronies. The more prosperous southern baronies of the county underwent manorialization in the medieval period, but the north retained its Gaelic traditions and system of common ownership until the Cromwellian conquest of the mid-seventeenth century.10 The Anglo-Norman Butlers recovered their great castle at Nenagh and took control of the manor of that name in the 15305 and were recognized as overlords by the O'Kennedys and their followers, but the shiring of the Ormonds as a part of the Butlers' County Palatine of Tipperary actually aided the retention of the O'Kennedys' independence and the survival of Irish laws and institutions in the region. Hostile clans and English officials alike hesitated to interfere with a jurisdiction exempt from royal government and in the hands of the Butler family, now the powerful earls of Ormond.11 James i pursued a policy of extinguishing the old clan-like tenures in Ireland. Though the policy of surrender and regrant was successful at the level of the great lords, the old tenures survived among the lesser Irish of the Ormonds and the Cromwellian inquisitions showed the land still held in undivided fractions by members of a family, quite unlike the Norman individual freeholds in the southern part of the county.12 Some features continued into the nineteenth century. Ingeborg Leister found evidence of numerous clachans, small open-field farming hamlets, on the 1840 Ordnance Survey maps of Tipperary, all north of the Devilsbit-Keeper Hill range.13 In the mountainous baronies of both Kilnamanagh and Owney and Arra that fringe the region to the south and west, partnership farming was still practised in half the townlands in 1850.14 North Tipperary, defined as a geographical rather than as a political entity, therefore constituted a social, economic, and cultural region distinct from surrounding areas. \"On the edge of the more commercialized farming regions\" in the nineteenth century,15 it displayed in its landholding and settlement patterns numerous traces of the Celtic past, and historically it had been quite distinct from the Norman southern part of the county. Its geographical situation in the Shannon Valley, ringed by wild stretches of mountain and bog, preserved its essential unity as a region despite its political dismemberment into parts of several counties in recent centuries. PROTESTANT SETTLEMENT IN NORTH TIPPERARY\n\nThe Protestant population of the North Tipperary region was of predominantly English descent, but the pattern of Protestant settlement that may be mapped using the parliamentary religious returns of i83i16 reflects the cumulative effects of population movements, conversions from Catholicism, village foundations, and the encouragement of Protestant colonies in previous centuries as well as the earliest influx of English immigrants. Protestants\n\n14\n\nIrish Migrants in the Canadas\n\nMAP 3 Percentage of Protestants, 1831, by parish. Protestants accounted for 8.5 per cent of the population of the region, but they were most concentrated in the vicinity of Borrisokane and Cloughjordan, and in the parishes of the King's County panhandle to the east. Source: HC (1835) xxxm.\n\nnumbered some 17,000 of a total population of some 200,000 in 1831, or 8.5 per cent.17 Though they nowhere became a majority of the population as they did in parts of northern Ireland, in some parishes they nevertheless constituted a quarter of the population, and the collection of statistics at the parish level conceals the clustering of people into Protestant colonies in areas smaller than a parish, as on the Dunalley estate in the eastern half of Modreeny parish. Map 3 reveals that the Protestant population occupied the lowland areas, particularly in the eastern part of the region - in the Borrisokane-Modreeny area of Lower Ormond and the adjacent parishes of Clonlisk barony in the King's County panhandle. These parishes formed the heartland of English settlement. The King's County panhandle came under limited English plantation in the early seventeenth century, but the Ormond baronies of County Tipperary that form the central part of the region came under secure English control at the time of the Cromwellian invasion in the 16405, and extensive English settlement there awaited the Restoration and royal confirmation of the\n\n15 The Protestants of North Tipperary\n\nCromwellian confiscation of Irish lands. Protestant colonization continued through the eighteenth and even into the early nineteenth centuries, especially in parishes on the fringes of the region. The Protestant concentrations at Mountshannon and Templemore both represent late eighteenth-century foundations established by landlords desirous of encouraging a Protestant tenantry. However, after the seventeenth century such Protestant colonies were formed by internal movements of population rather than by further immigration from England. Infiltration of English settlement up the River Shannon from Limerick may to some extent have predated the Cromwellian incursions. Certainly John Strangman had purchased land in Castletownarra parish from the O'Briens before 1640, and the earl of Cork had bought property there and in neighbouring Youghalarra and Kilmastullaparishes.18 There was also a small colony of miners on the slopes of the mountains southwest of Nenagh, at the Silvermines in Kilmore parish, but some of the miners were killed and most of the remainder fled to Limerick at the outbreak of the 1641 Rebellion.19 Nonetheless, most of the English population at mid-century must have been Cromwellian. The greatest concentration of English in the Cromwellian poll-tax and hearth money returns lived on the lower Shannonside lands at the foot of the Arra Mountains between Killaloe and Newport, extending northeastward through the vale between the Arra Mountains and the Keeper Hill range to Nenagh. The Shannon parishes of Dromineer, Monsea, Kilbarron, and Lorrha also were home to important concentrations of Protestant settlers.20 This predominance was not to last. In the nineteenth century the Protestant population of the Castletownarra area was miniscule, and by 1850 almost non-existent. The town of Newport, to the south, was home to 115 Protestant families in 1766, nearly as many as lived in the important administrative centre of Cashel in the southern part of the county, but in contrast to the situation in most of the region the numbers there were no larger in 1831. Kilbarron and Lorrha lost most of their Protestant populations much earlier than this, probably to the new town of Borrisokane, founded on better soil inland in the second half of the seventeenth century.21 By 1660 there was also a scattering of English settlers throughout Ballybritt and Clonlisk baronies of King's County and in the adjoining Tipperary parishes. They were fairly numerous in the Lower Ormond border parishes of Ballingarry, Uskane, and especially Modreeny, and in the lowlands of Upper Ormond, notably on the Cole (later the Cole Bowen) estate in Ballymackey, and in Lisbonny and Aghnameadle, as well as in the mountainous Borrisoleigh neighbourhood to the south and in the garrison town of Roscrea. This distribution suggests that there may have been some movement into the area from an earlier English plantation in southwestern Offaly. Plans for the plantation of central Ireland had been advanced in the sixteenth century in\n\n16\n\nIrish Migrants in the Canadas\n\nthe same period that such policies were pursued with success in Ulster and America. The Ely O'Carroll territory (the baronies of Ballybritt and Clonlisk in the King's panhandle) was severed from Tipperary and attached to Offaly by order-in-council in 1606 for plantation purposes.22 An English colony was planted in the 16205 at Birr, thereafter known also as Parsonstown for the family name of the proprietorial family who later held title as earls of Rosse.23 The Parsons family actively promoted their town of Birr and in 1660 the parish had the largest English population in the region.24 The exempt jurisdiction of the Butler earls of Ormond had preserved the Tipperary part of the region from the grasp of Elizabethan land sharks, but following the abolition of the Palatine jurisdiction by James I in 1621 after a quarrel with the earl, proposals were also advanced to plant the Ormond baronies in order to secure the Shannon against the men of Connaught. Strafford held inquisitions in North Tipperary in the 16305 and had the area surveyed in 1639, but plans to advance the Ormond plantation were cut short by the outbreak of hosilities between the king and parliament at home and by the 1641 Rebellion in Ireland.25 Persistent oral traditions assert that Tipperary's Protestants are descended from Cromwell's soldiers, but this can be true in only a few instances.26 Though the English government met its financial obligations to the army in Ireland and to the merchant adventurers who financed it by issuing debentures redeemable for confiscated lands, and allocated most of the North Tipperary region seized from the native Irish to satisfy the claims of the military, including the baronies of Upper and Lower Ormond, Owney and Arra, and Clonlisk,27 very few of the common soldiers settled in the country. Their debentures were worth little and lack of capital would have prevented the men from developing their lands even if they had redeemed them for small acreages surrounded by hostile, dispossessed Irish. The vast majority instead sold out to their officers, often for paltry sums, and returned to England.28 A number of senior officers invested heavily in debentures and secured grants to large territories in the conquered country.29 Some of these colonels and a number of lesser officers settled upon their new estates in North Tipperary and became the ancestors of such landed gentry of later centuries as the Sadleirs, Pritties, Poes, Gasons, Abbotts, Andrewses, Cambies, Tolers, Breretons, Wallers, and Atkinsons.30 The titles of many were confirmed after the Restoration, for the new king had not the power to expel them, but there was some shuffling of lands which may have contributed to the shift eastward of the focal point of Protestant settlement. Col. James Hutchinson, for example, left his earlier location in Youghalarra for Knockballymeagher near Roscrea.31 However, half the lands in the Ormond baronies were allocated under the new monarch to \"land sharks, nepotists, and Court favourites.\"32 This left the door open to speculation in Irish lands and the acquisition of estates by those arriving in the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries.\n\n17 The Protestants of North Tipperary\n\nSome of these later gentry families acquired their Tipperary estates by marriage, as exemplified by the Heads of Deny Castle on Lough Derg, who descend from a Waterford wool buyer who married the heiress of Captain Samuel Wade, a Cromwellian grantee.33 Others with capital immigrated from England after the 1688 Revolution and acquired property. George Stoney of Kettle well, Yorkshire, mortgaged a maternal estate and emigrated to Ireland in this period and is reported to have settled at Knockshegowna in Ballingarry. The next generation leased the later family seat at Greyfort in Borrisokane from the Saunders family, who had acquired part of the Stopford grant.34 Trafficking in lands by non-residents continued, a major example of speculation being the purchase of the town and lordship of Roscrea in 1727 by John Damer, an Englishman whose uncle had begun a family tradition in the i66os by investing in Irish military debentures. The Darners were always non-resident, but the property descended through a female line to the earls of Portarlington in the Queen's County, who let it out on long-term lease but held the fee until i858.35 The Cromwellian officers and their assignees formed the new landlord class, but the gentry made up only a small proportion of the later Protestant population. It was nevertheless this landlord class that provided the initial stimulus to general English settlement and founded much of the later village network to house their English tenantry. Only a minority of Tipperary's later Protestant population descended from settlers who actually arrived in the Cromwellian era. Some sixty of the just over two hundred non-Irish surnames borne by nineteenth-century Protestant emigrants to Canada are to be found in the hearth money rolls of the i66os, a defective transcript of which provides our only long list of seventeenthcentury inhabitants. Cromwellian officers account for a half dozen of these sixty, and many of the remaining surnames are so common (Brown, Cox, Taylor, etc.) that the existence of any genealogical link with later residents of the same name in the same region - often in distant parishes - is not at all certain. However, some twenty names are sufficiently distinctive or sufficiently uncommon in the region to suggest that the individuals recorded are the ancestors of the later bearers of these names. Examples include Abbott, Acres (found in the hearth money returns at Ballingarry and Borrisokane as Akers and Eggers), Alloway (Attaway in the returns), Blackwell, Boate, Farmer, Goulding, Harding, Hardy, Rivington (variously Revington, Remmington, and Riddington in seventeenth- through nineteenth-century sources), Sharpley, Sheppard, Smallman (the probable interpretation of the transcription Swallman and Swatman entered at Corbally; Smallman occurs later at Roscrea), Stanley, and Watkins.36 Some of these individuals may have been soldiers who remained in Tipperary without exchanging their debentures,37 but it is more likely that such names represent early English immigrants, perhaps tradesmen or retainers and employees of the new gentry.\n\n18\n\nIrish Migrants in the Canadas\n\nThe ancestors of the majority of the emigrants studied here, and of the Protestant population of North Tipperary generally, below the ranks of the gentry, came into the region after the i66os and settled in new villages and on new farms that they cleared in underpopulated areas. North Tipperary before the confiscations was a backward rural area, and Lower Ormond in particular had a notably high proportion of woodland, scrub, and bog with few nucleated settlements.38 The Civil Survey conducted in 1654 reflects the devastation of the Cromwellian wars in its references to small numbers of houses and cabins, vast areas lying waste, and numerous ruined castles.39 Apart from ports and monastic settlements, almost all towns and villages in Ireland date from the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, and North Tipperary is no exception to this generalization.40 The Civil Survey records a few insignificant villages of a half-dozen or so cabins clustered around ruined castles or old monastic foundations, but most were so small as to dispel any pretensions to an urban character. There were few enough villages, but the only towns were the old monastic centres of Birr, by this time part of the King's County and under English plantation, and Nenagh and Roscrea, all small by English standards and bearing marks of the recent war. Nenagh may have shrunk to little more than a hamlet by the early seventeenth century. In the Civil Survey it boasted a \"large stronge castle wth sixty cottages & thatcht houses,\" but they were \"lately built & the castle lately repayred by Collonell Abbott,\"41 the Cromwellian governor.42 At Roscrea were \"a large castle & a bawne in repayre many thatcht houses and cabbins a ruined Abby a corne mill upon a brooke [and] a markett weekely on Thursday a Fayre twice a yeare.\"43 Most of the villages existing in the early nineteenth century were built by the new landlords. Among the oldest and most important are Borrisokane and Cloughjordan. There is no trace of either in the Civil Survey. Both came into being in the late seventeenth century as a result of a deliberate policy of plantation by the Cromwellian grantees. All of Borrisokane parish apart from Tombrickane was granted to Captain James Stopford, along with lands in Modreeny.44 Stopford laid out the village, a long tapering street, adjacent to the ancient parish church, and a \"pretty English settlement\" was reported therein i69i.45 Captain John Harrison redeemed his debentures around Cloughjordan. At that time there was no centre of population on his estate, for the terriers to the Down Survey note only \"several cabbins, disperst in ye said parish\" of Modreeny.46 Either John (d. i697)47 or his son James (d. I727)48 built the street village of Cloughjordan and populated it with \"disbanded soldiers,\" according to one account,49 or more likely by importing tenants from England.50 The village of Cloughjordan, which received a market grant in I706,51 and the farmland nearby, which became the centres of Protestant population on the estate, were the most sparsely settled parts of Modreeny parish before Harrison arrived. The Down Survey map depicts Harrison's 919\n\n19 The Protestants of North Tipperary\n\nplantation acre52 grant of Garrane and Cloughjordan53 as two very large units with high proportions of bog and woodland.54 The later townlands that were created there and became the homes of the Protestant population bear names like Burnwood, Newtown, Islandwood, Stoneyacre, and Oxpark, names that testify to their origins in the clearance of marginal scrubwood and bog by English settlers. The establishment of the new English on sparsely populated marginal land has been noted elsewhere as typical of North Tipperary in general55 and underlines the fact that wholesale removal of the Irish population at the time of the Cromwellian confiscations proved impractical. One historian has noted, however, that Tipperary landowners transplanted to Connaught were accompanied by unusually large numbers of retainers. Though most of the Irish population stayed behind, the landowners who remained were transformed into tenants.56 In the second quarter of the eighteenth century the Harrison estate passed to the Prittie family of Kilboy by reason of the marriage of James's daughter in 1702 to Henry Prittie, grandson of Col. Henry Prittie, a Cromwellian grantee who resided in Kilmore parish south of Nenagh. The fifth Henry Prittie was elevated to the peerage as the first Baron Dunalley in 1800. This major Protestant colony was thus in the nineteenth century part of the Dunalley estate, which in 1876 totalled 18,000 acres.57 Though the continuing high concentration of Protestants on the Dunalley estate at Cloughjordan and also at Borrisokane suggests that large numbers of the people descended from English settlers imported by the new gentry, others were later migrants from surrounding counties. The process was ongoing, and continued far beyond the end of the seventeenth century. The Quaker Boakes moved to Cloughjordan from settlements of Friends in Queen's County early in the eighteenth century,58 the Hoppers moved to Roscrea in a step-wise migration from mid-King's County in the late eighteenth century,59 and the Kingsmills and Howards came to Templemore from the east later still. One later emigrant, William Geary, was himself an immigrant, a native of England who had gone to Ireland to promote agricultural equipment and married locally.60 Geary was, however, exceptional. Though some Canadian families of Tipperary descent have heard oral traditions that suggest that their families lived in Ireland only a short time, most of these accounts minimize the time spent there by telescoping unknown generations.61 The ramification of surnames suggests that most families had been in central Ireland, if not in North Tipperary itself, since at least the early eighteenth century. Most of the surnames of the Protestant population were English, though a few such as Colbert are problematical. A few interestingly are Welsh Evans, Jones, Lewis, Morgan, Owens, and Powell certainly, and possibly Edwards, Roberts, and Williams. Most of these Welsh names occur in the seventeenth-century hearth tax rolls, but how they came to Tipperary is uncertain. A number of the Powell families of North Tipperary must descend\n\n2O Irish Migrants in the Canadas\n\nfrom a Limerick family of the name, for many use the forename Caleb, and Lenihan records Caleb as a name that ran in the family of Robert Powell, an officer who settled there in i649-62 The only name that is surely Scottish is McLeod, and a Caesar McLeod, the name borne by an emigrant of a later generation, is found at Borrisokane in ijj6.63 Scottish settlement in Ireland was confined almost entirely to the North, where Prebyterianism serves as a reasonable surrogate for Scottish origins. A very few North Tipperary Protestants bear the names of Palatine families who migrated east from County Limerick in the eighteenth century. The Shouldices of Glankeen and Switzers of Templederry bear names of Palatine Germans settled at Rathkeale around 1709. The Sparlings of Killaloe migrated eastwards more recently,64 while those at Rathnaveoge were possibly an English family.65 Palatine names are much more common further south in the Kilcooly region of Tipperary, where a deliberate policy of recruitment attracted such families in the I77OS.66 Several dozen emigrant Protestants also bore the names of Irish Catholic families long resident in the North Tipperary region, though often single families account for the appearance of these names in the list.67 Such families descend from ancestors who conformed to the Church of Ireland for secular reasons during the penal time or converted as a result of intermarriage in the late eighteenth century when religious tolerance was widespread and before the 1798 Rebellion and deteriorating economic conditions again sharpened social cleavages.68 The Reformation had technically followed the same course in Ireland as in England, but despite the loss of church buildings and lands the people of Ireland did not, of course, become Protestants. The monasteries were dissolved and churches seized but the church lands were granted to Irish families, and many of the new clergy and even the first Protestant bishop of Killaloe were native Irish whose reformation was not based upon strong conviction. Serious attempts to eradicate Roman Catholicism were not made until the enactment of the Penal Laws in the reign of Anne.69 Secular reasons for conversion were greatly reduced as legal disabilities against Roman Catholics were eased in the late eighteenth century; the later emigrant, Captain George T. Burke, however, a member of a family of Roman Catholic gentry that managed to retain some of its ancestral lands near Borrisoleigh, though holding under Protestant head landlords,70 converted to Anglicanism in order to secure a commission in the British Army.71 Intermarriage became less common following the upheavals of the 1798 Rebellion. Nevertheless, a few of the emigrating families were of \"mixed\" religion in Ireland, and remained so in Canada, some members adhering to the Protestant faith and others being Roman Catholic. For example, Jane Giles of Bourney, wife of Michael Ryan, a Roman Catholic who settled near Belleville, was initially Protestant,72 and other mixed families included the Searsons of Killea,\n\n21 The Protestants of North Tipperary\n\nOakleys of Carney, Armitages and Baskervilles (these last from Youghalarra, an area with a tiny Protestant population), and the Somervilles of Ballymacegan and Birr. In the case of the John Morgan and William Derham families the Catholic parties to the marriages seem to have converted to Protestantism before emigrating, and a single Irish baptism in both cases provides the only evidence of Catholicism.73 Nonetheless, both saw a child marry a Catholic in Canada. The Protestant population of North Tipperary was therefore not of uniform background, though the majority descended from families of English origin who arrived in the region in the post-Cromwellian period. The Cromwellian confiscations were crucial, however, for the new tenurial framework and the new English gentry were the stimuli that brought about the firm establishment of a Protestant population in Tipperary. Though many of the new arrivals cleared lands that were underused or left waste by the existing population, the privileged status of the English settlers, both in law and in the eyes of the landlords, remained a cause of bitter discontent for the Roman Catholic majority. ENCOURAGEMENT AND SPREAD OF THE PROTESTANT POPULATION\n\nThough some early concentrations of Protestant population have persisted from the seventeenth century to the present day as at Birr, Cloughjordan, and Borrisokane, others originated more recently. Establishment of Protestant colonies on estates continued through the eighteenth century and even into the nineteenth. In some cases this involved town or village foundation, in others merely a determined effort to establish dependable Protestant tenants as freeholders on large farms. By the eighteenth century such colonies were founded by attracting settlers from the growing populations of existing estates or by drawing Protestants from neighbouring counties rather than by the direct importation of settlers from England. Thus the spread of the Protestant population to other estates in the region was in part due to the desire of the gentry to develop a Protestant tenantry in the eighteenth century. It would be a mistake, however, to attribute population movement solely to incentives offered by landlords. The existence as well as the foundation of a village or market town inevitably drew shopkeepers, tradesmen, and labourers, and in rural parishes the lack of a village did nothing to obviate the need for such ubiquitous craftsmen as blacksmiths, weavers, and shoemakers. While the destruction of records makes it impossible to trace each family back to its first appearance in North Tipperary and so to assess the relative importance of each of the factors above in fostering the growth and spread of the Protestant population, it is certain that in many instances the bearers of a\n\n22\n\nIrish Migrants in the Canadas\n\ncommon surname must also share a common ancestor.74 This conclusion is supported by the manner in which many surnames localized within the region in the early nineteenth century. It is likewise apparent that a sense of kinship solidarity persisted, fostered by personal inclination as well as by the growing necessity of family assistance in providing for the rising generation; the nineteenth century was economically insecure, particularly for a privileged but threatened minority being gradually overwhelmed by a burgeoning Catholic population. This sense of kinship is suggested by the widespread custom of burying in an ancestral parish for generations after a family had left its former residence75 and by the general use of customary naming patterns. We shall see family solidarity in action when we come to consider the mechanisms of emigration and we shall observe that many of the cultural byproducts of such a sense of family persisted amongst the descendants of the emigrants in Canada into the late nineteenth century. It remains for us to examine in greater detail the manner in which the granting of freehold tenure and the foundation of villages and towns facilited the growth and spread of the Protestant population. Protestant Freeholders In the eighteenth century the Protestant population benefited both from the anti-Catholic legislation of the reign of Anne and from the desire of landlords to lease out their estates to improving tenants. The Cromwellian and Williamite settlements of the seventeenth century had taken most of the land in the country out of Catholic hands, and the penal laws of the early eighteenth were designed, amongst other purposes, to perpetuate this situation. Other laws crippled Irish trade in the interest of promoting English manufactures, and the Irish economy reverted to a dependence upon agriculture. Landlords sought a secure income by leasing their estates on generous terms and in large acreages to dependable Protestants whom they encouraged to improve the land.76 Leases for a term of lives or in perpetuity for a fixed rent became increasingly common in the early eighteenth century, as the lump-sum payment or fine paid by the lessee on taking up a lease helped meet the immediate cash needs for which the more profligate of the Anglo-Irish gentry became legendary.77 After the land was enclosed78 and as the economy improved, especially with the easing of restrictions on the export of Irish agricultural produce, now needed to feed industrializing England, the gentry became content with a regular income easily obtained and let their estates to large Protestant farmers. It was believed that security of tenure at a fixed rent would encourage farmers to improve their lands at their own expense. In many cases the lessees sublet all or part of their tenancies; as demand for land by a growing population drove up rents, these \"middlemen\" became the recipients of increasing incomes that stood in stark contrast to the fixed sums\n\n23 The Protestants of North Tipperary\n\nMAP 4 Modreeny parish freeholders, 1776. Protestant farmers on the Dunalley estate held their lands on leases for the term of three lives. Secure tenure was intended to foster agricultural improvement - and to boost a tenantry of loyal Protestant voters. Sources: freeholders list, NLI, ms 787; extent of Dunalley estate, PRO, Dublin, TAB 27 N/I4 (1826/7).\n\nthey in turn were required by the terms of their leases to pay the head landlords. It is no coincidence that many of the progenitors of the nineteenth-century Protestant emigrants are first traceable in surviving estate and Deeds Registry records of the mid-eighteenth century, for many of them became the recipients of long-term leases at that time. The old Harrison estate in Modreeny parish, for example, was let out to Protestant tenants by the Pritties, the non-resident owners who lived to the west at Kilboy.79 The 1776 freeholders list enumerates some three dozen such tenants there, bearing names that were to become familiar in nineteenth-century Tipperary communities in Canada: Anglesey, Carter, Coates, Guest, Hodgins, Lewis, Mooney, Ralph, Rimington, Shoebottom, Tydd, and Williams.80 There had been a significant Protestant population in Modreeny since the\n\n24 Irish Migrants in the Canadas\n\nMAP 5 Estates and Protestant settlement in the Mountshannon area. Two approaches to promoting a Protestant tenantry: the Croasdailes gave leases to substantial freeholding farmers in the 17408, while the Tandys later in the century encouraged labourers to locate in the village of Mountshannon. By the 18205 the freehold farms were much subdivided, and the labourers were impoverished.

In other cases, Protestant populations were attracted to estates hitherto occupied solely by Catholic Irish as the result of deliberate attempts by landlords to foster a Protestant tenantry. Such recruitment was responsible for Protestant settlement in some of the areas on the borders of the North Tipperary region: on the Croasdaile estate in the parish of Clonrush on the Galway side of Lough Derg, and on the Otway estate in the southern mountains. By the late seventeenth century the western portion of the parish of Clonrush, known as Ballenruane, had come into the hands of the Croasdaile family of Cloghstoken, County Galway. In 1742 Henry Croasdaile of Woodford, a few miles to the north of Ballenruane, secured title to that property by paying the debts of his uncle. He moved to Ballenruane soon after and began actively to develop the estate, operating iron works there and\n\n25 The Protestants of North Tipperary\n\nleasing large portions of the estate for lives to farmers who, by reason of holding very large farms of close to one hundred Irish acres, were sometimes termed \"gentlemen.\" By 1760, subdivisions of Ballenruane were held by John Long (Ballynagough), William Burke (Cartron), Henry Watson, Thomas Burke, and Mr Benn (parts of Geenenny), George Clarke, Henry Watson again, and Edmond Burke (parts of Clonolia).81 While the Burkes were probably Roman Catholic gentlemen of the family that still held Tintrim in the eastern part of the parish in the nineteenth century, the remaining lessees were Protestants. It appears that Croasdaile brought these families in from County Clare, to the west, for Clarke's lease of 1746 describes him as of Ballyheige, County Clare, farmer,82 and Long's in 1745 was witnessed by Thomas Long, a farmer of Killaloe in Clare. Clarke's lease connects with County Clare another family that soon appeared in Ballenruane, the Pages, described as also of Ballyheige.83 Thus the Croasdaile estate in Clonrush was planted with a small but socially and economically dominant class of Protestant freeholders. Another documented example of landlords planting Protestant tenants on their lands as freeholders in the mid-eighteenth century comes from the Castle Otway estate in the mountains southwest of Money gall. This property formed the grant of the Cromwellian Captain John Otway, a native of Westmoreland, England.84 In 1759 and 1760 Thomas Otway (1731-1786) granted freeholds to the ancestors of the Canadian Shouldice and Sifton families.85 Although not all of Otway's original leases survive, a rent roll of 1806 indicates that ten leases for three lives and two for two lives were then in effect (see Table i). Tenancies at will and life leases were fairly evenly divided between Protestant and Roman Catholic tenants, though the latter made up by far the greater proportion of the population in the surrounding parishes. Typically, eleven of the twelve leases for lives appear to have been held by Protestants.

Nicholas settled in the Ottawa Valley, but Charles followed his sons to London; a descendant became Laurier's immigration minister.

If those reponsible for theft of property from the demesne were not discovered, he charged his cottiers as a group the full value of the items stolen, and he set escalating scales of fines for refusing to work on a holy day other than Sunday and for minor infractions such as neglecting to tip a cart on end after unyoking the animals. The punishment for a fifth offence of the last type was demolition of the cottier's house.86 It is no surprise that an intolerant landlord like Thomas Otway attempted to build up a tenantry of substantial Protestant farmers. The Shouldice, Sifton, Wright, and Lee families that are known to have been on the estate by I76487 had by 1806 been joined by other Protestant families named Ackland, Ardill, Armitage, Baskerville, Brereton, Carter, Dagg, Harrington, Hodgins, Kent, Mills, Mooney, Morgan, Oakley, Oldfield, Searson, Short, Tucker, Wall, Wallace, and Watson. All were probably recruited from older Protestant colonies on the plain to the north, for at least half of these names were also to be found on the Dunalley estate at Modreeny and most were in evidence somewhere else in North Tipperary. Promotional activity continued into the nineteenth century. The minister at Templederry, the parish in which the Otway s' residence of Castle Otway was located, reported in 1820 that the fifty Protestant families there, an estimated 4 per cent of the population, represented an increase in the last few years \"in consequence of encouragement from the landlords to settle here.\"88 Village and Town Foundations The foundation of villages and market towns revived in the late eighteenth century under the auspices of landlords anxious to upgrade their estates and enlarge their rent rolls. The date of establishment of a village may often be guessed at by examining the physical layout. Louis Cullen has pointed out that a triangular green, such as that which may still be traced in maps of the oldest part of Birr, is \"the hallmark of early seventeenth-century settlement.\" The other villages in the North Tipperary region, which date from after this period, do not display this feature, which is common in Leix and Offaly to the east. North Tipperary market centres established in the late seventeenth century consist of lines of houses clustered on either side of a long, gradually widening street, as at Borrisokane, Cloughjordan, and Shinrone.89 The second spate of town-building, in the second half of the eighteenth century,90 coincided with the prosperous period following the termination of the Seven Years' War in 1763 and again following the revolution in America. Centres established at this time tend to display the Georgian love of symmetry by the incorporation into their plans of stylish squares, as in the newer additions to Birr, or the laying-out of regular rectangular marketplaces and the provision\n\n28 Irish Migrants in the Canadas\n\nof scenic vistas as at Templemore. Where an attempt to increase the Protestant population was an integral part of the town-building scheme, such an effort may represent a reaction by the landlord to the relaxation of the penal laws against Roman Catholics in this period. This was certainly the case in some rural settlement schemes of the era.91 The foundation of a village in conjunction with the establishment of a Protestant population is best exemplified by the village of Mbuntshannon on the Gal way side of Lough Derg. While the Protestants of the parish of Clonrush to the east were \"generally farmers,\" descendants of the freeholders established there by Croasdaile in the 17405, the Protestant population of Mountshannon's Inniscaltra parish in the early nineteenth century consisted of \"a few farmers; others Carpenters & Shoemakers; most, weavers & labourers, very poor.\"92 The establishment in Inniscaltra of a village inhabited largely by Protestant labourers provides the explanation for the contrast. The parochial union of Inniscaltra, Clonrush, and Moynoe which came to centre upon the parish church at Mountshannon thus provides evidence of two distinct responses by landlords to their desire to develop a Protestant tenantry. It is claimed locally that Messrs Reade and Tandy, London bankers, acquired Inniscaltra parish about two hundred years ago through the bankruptcy of William Woods, the former owner.93 However, Philip Reade, Esq., claimed in 1836 that the owner of the fee \"above a century past, leased in perpetuity to two persons; one of whom has resided this last year; the other does not, but resides in Ireland,\" the former being Reade and the latter Mrs Tandy.94 In any case, the parish comprised two estates, with the Reades living at Woodpark in the western part of the parish and the Tandys possessing the eastern half and in the mid-nineteenth century living there (see Map 5). Though the Reades were resident, they did nothing to encourage Protestant tenants and their estate remained populated with Roman Catholics. The Tandys, however, redeveloped the Daly village of Mountshannon into a classic estate village of large stone houses lining the roadway, with a new Protestant church on the north side of the street, a handsome market hall on the south, and eventually the Tandy residence at the eastern end. The Tandys populated their village with Protestant labourers and tradesmen.95 In 1831 there were 516 Protestants in the parish, mostly in the village, to the Roman Catholics' I682.96 The most important town foundation in the region in this period is the market town of Templemore in the parish of that name, which in its present form appears to have been established by the Garden family only in the 17805. The 1766 census of religions shows only ten Protestant and seventy \"papist\" families in the parish, with at least seven of the ten Protestant families headed by gentry or clergy.97 That something dramatic occurred thereafter is indicated by the fact that the population rose nearly thirteen-fold by 1831, the Protestant population alone by over seven-fold.98 The town is in the townland\n\n29 The Protestants of North Tipperary\n\nMAP 7 Templemore town and park, 1840.

The laying out of the demesne and the creation of Templemore Lake probably date from the same period as the establishment of the town, for the ruins of the old church lie deep within the park while the new church is contemporaneous with the town foundation. The appearance of the town is dramatic and its landlord origins are unmistakable, for it consists of substantial houses built around a huge rectangular marketplace. The naming of the road at the western end of the marketplace for King George is typical of eighteenth-century foundations, and Church Street to the northeast is aligned specifically to provide a vista of the tower of the new Protestant church consecrated in 1794.\" The establishment of Templemore provided more employment opportunities for Roman Catholics than it did for Protestants, if the population figures are any guide. Nevertheless, the town soon gained a respectable population of Protestant tradesmen to add to the small number of gentlemen that had been\n\n3O Irish Migrants in the Canadas\n\nthe denomination's main representatives in the parish a generation before. The parochial registers100 yield the names of twenty-three tradesmen who settled in the town between 1791 and 1803. Their occupations indicate that Templemore was a typical rural service centre with a small weaving sector noticeable after 1799. The register reveals the presence of four shopkeepers, two shoemakers, two whitesmiths, a butcher, mason, tailor, saddler, cooper, and woolcomber, and seven weavers, one of them a stuffweaver and another a weaver of carpets. A local story states that Sir John Garden brought thirty weavers who were Orange Protestants from the North in the late eighteenth century and built houses for them in New Row, but that the experiment failed after fifteen or twenty years and the weavers returned to the North or emigrated to America.101 This story could not be documented, but most of the names of weavers listed in the parish register before occupations ceased to be given in 1803 are names familiar in the North Tipperary region, and a number of Templemore weavers later emigrated to Canada. The destruction of contemporaneous records from other parishes makes it impossible to trace the origins of most of the migrants into Templemore but certainly a substantial number did come from within the region. Two families, the Guests and Whites, came from the neighbouring rural parish of Killea, the Hardys probably from Nenagh, the Dolmages no doubt from the Palatine colony at Kilcooly to the south, the Evanses, Prowds, and Dudleys from the King's County panhandle, the Talbots from Roscrea in the same area, and Henry Sides probably from Queen's County to the east. There are some traces of chain migration into Templemore in this period. William Evans arrived in 1797, married a Guest who had moved in from Killea, and settled down as parish clerk. Two years later George Evans of Moystown, King's County, arrived and married another Guest. William Dolmage, who appeared in 1802, was followed by John in 1803, and a large interrelated contingent of Talbots, Fitzgeralds, and Howards, many of them weavers, arrived beginning around 1801. Thus a parish which had contained an insignificant number of Protestant inhabitants in the mid-eighteenth century secured the beginnings of a large Protestant concentration by gradual migration from surrounding parts of the region. This core grew increasingly until maps and valuation records of the 18405 showed a densely populated town with many people living in rows of houses erected by early tenants in lanes off the central marketplace,102 and a population in 1841 of 3685.103 Twelve-per cent of the population in 1831 was Protestant, a large proportion for the region. Landlord promotion of town-building is documented also at Dunkerrin in 1767 and at Kinnitty some fifty years later. The Rolleston family drafted a prospectus of its village of Dunkerrin, which was in the heartland of local Protestant settlements in the King's County panhandle. However, nothing came of Mr Rolleston's vows \"forthwith to build several Houses in the Town\n\n31 The Protestants of North Tipperary\n\nand to Expend a Good deal of Money he is now borrowing in such building and for the Encouragement of Manufactorers in his said Town.\" Dunkerrin remained a hamlet.104 A modest but more successful attempt at village promotion occurred further north at Kinnitty in the early nineteenth century. The Rev. Mr Maude noted in 1820 that the Protestant population there \"must have increased within a few years, as Kinnitty is a new place, & the bulk of the protestants reside there.\"105 Thus Protestant colonization continued into the early nineteenth century, frequently at the expense of the local Roman Catholic population as landlords indicated a preference for Protestant tenants or employees. Additional Protestant \"colonies\" developed in the North Tipperary area in parishes at a distance from those established by the new gentry in the late seventeenth century, sometimes as communities of privileged freeholding farmers, and sometimes as populations of tradesmen or labourers residing in newly established towns and villages. In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, however, these colonies were the product of internal migration, largely from within the region, rather than of immigration from England. T H E S H I F T I N GP R O T E S T A N T CATHOLIC BALANCE\n\nWhile Louis Cullen has recently written that Ireland's rate of population increase was unusual only prior to 1750, and that after that date the continued increase was more or less in line with general European levels,106 Ireland was different from England in that this rise in population was neither caused nor accompanied by industrialization. Ireland remained a rural country, with the exception of the Belfast region in the hitherto backward north. Though it now appears that demographic adjustments by the residents of the island slowed this rate of increase in the twenty-five years before the Famine of the 18405, this accommodation was made less effectively in the impoverished western counties.
