        "text": "It has been one of the great mysteries of the literary world: the strange death of Edgar Allan Poe, perhaps the most famous American horror writer of all .\n\nSince he died, raving insanely in a hospital bed, Poe's demise has been the subject of a multitude of theories, ranging from murder to mugging to alcoholism to political skulduggery to catching an infectious disease such as rabies. Now a leading American author, who has written a novel about Poe's death, believes that he has come up with convincing evidence that could at last solve the puzzle: brain cancer.\n\nMatthew Pearl, author of The Poe Shadow, spent three years researching Poe, especially the circumstances of his death. He had hoped to uncover new evidence to solve a mystery that has perplexed experts for more than 150 years.\n\nHe thinks he has unearthed proof that Poe had a terrible brain tumour, which could explain why he died so dramatically. 'It would explain his hallucinations and his mental state before he died,' Pearl told The Observer.\n\nPoe's death was the stuff of which mystery is spun. The acclaimed poet and writer, whose poem 'The Raven' is one of the world's best known pieces of horror writing, had travelled to Baltimore, Maryland, where he disappeared for several days . He was discovered by strangers late at night, dishevelled and raving outside a notorious city saloon, the Gunner's Hall.\n\nA doctor friend of Poe's named J Snodgrass found Poe in a terrible state and wearing somebody else's clothes. Snodgrass assumed he was so drunk that he needed to be checked into hospital. Poe's condition did not improve. Over the next few days he lapsed in and out of consciousness. When he was awake he would shout random phrases and repeated the name 'Reynolds! Reynolds!' No one has ever identifi ed whoever Poe was referring to.\n\nPoe died in the early hours of 7 October, 1849. Even his final words were uncertain. One account had him saying 'Lord, help my poor soul!', while another had him reciting a poetic verse about God and demons.\n\nThe strange circumstances of his death prompted a huge bout of speculation, fuelled by a searing obituary published by an enemy of Poe who accused him of various crimes and scandalous sexual affairs.\n\nMany later scholars have assumed that Poe was an alcoholic who died because of binge drinking. Others believe he contracted a disease, such as cholera or rabies, neither of which would have been uncommon in 19th-century America. But there have been shadier theories, too. Some have held Poe to have been murdered, either by muggers who beat him into his demented state, or by rivals or enemies of the controversial literary figure.\n\nStill another theory holds that Poe was the victim of a notorious political tactic called 'cooping'. This was where citizens were often press-ganged off the streets by political campaigns and forced to vote several times in local elections.\n\nThey were often bribed with drinks and given new clothes in order to disguise their identity. Gunner's Hall was a pub which was also used as a ballot station and was notorious for the practice.\n\nBut Pearl has now discovered evidence that Poe died of brain cancer, which may explain why he had suff ered from hallucinations and delusions. Pearl's evidence came in the form of several old newspaper stories written about the exhumation of Poe's body 26 years after his death. Poe's coffin was being moved to a more prominent spot in the cemetery and the onlookers were amazed to see that his shrunken brain was still visible inside his skull. It was described as being 'dried and hardened in the skull' in an 1878 article in the St Louis Republican newspaper, whereas a letter in the Baltimore Gazette claimed that: 'The cerebral mass... evidenced no sign of disintegration or decay, though, of course, it is somewhat diminished.'\n\nPearl contacted a friend's wife who worked as a forensic pathologist. She pointed out that the descriptions could not possibly have been of a brain, as it is one of the fi rst parts of a corpse to rot after death. But she said some forms of brain tumours can calcify after death and leave a hardened mass. One account described the brain as almost rattling around inside Poe's head. Pearl also looked up pictures of calcified tumours and discovered that some resembled shrunken brains.\n\nProfessor James Hutchisson, a Poe expert at the Citadel Military College in South Carolina, said that Pearl's evidence backed up his own theories . 'Matthew is really on to something. If you look back at the rest of his life and his physical condition and ailments, it backs up the idea that he suff ered from a brain tumour,' Hutchisson said.\n\nHowever, given the enduring popularity of Poe's work and the immense sense of the macabre that it conveys, it is unlikely that a brain tumour as cause of death will ever be fully accepted.\n\n' After all, you can have a brain tumour and still get actually killed by something else,' Pearl said."
