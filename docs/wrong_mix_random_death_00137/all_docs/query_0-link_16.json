In 1989 Shane worked as the penciller on issues 1 to 6 of \"Mister X\" volume two. Since then Shane has contributed to several anthology titles, such as\" Negative Burn\" and \"The Big Book of Urban Legends\", even drawing an issue of Neil Gaiman's legendary \"Sandman\".\n\nAlbion\n\nOakley is probably best known for his co-creation of the Wildstorm mini series \"Albion\", with Alan Moore, Leah Moore, and John Reppion which ran from 2005 until 2006. The series revived many long forgotten UK comic book characters such as the Steel Claw and Grimly Feendish, some of whom had not been in print since the 1950s.\n\nRecent Work\n\nShane worked as a concept artist for Frazer Lee's horror film \"Urbane\".\n\nIn 2007 he illustrated an adaptation of Edgar Allan Poe's \"The Fall of the House of Usher\" written by Dan Whitehead and published in Self Made Hero's \"Nevermore\" anthology.\n\nBoom! Studios' \"Cthulhu Tales\" #2 (published April 2008) featured a story entitled \"No Hiding Place\" written by Steve Niles and illustrated by Oakley. Shane has also provided covers for several issues of \"Cthulhu Tales\" and \"Zombie Tales\".\n\nBibliography\n\n* Moore, Leah; Reppion, John; Moore, Alan; Ilustrated Oakley, Shane. \"Albion\".
