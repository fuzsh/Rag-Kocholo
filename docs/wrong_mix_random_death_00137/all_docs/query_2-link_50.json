        "text": "It is October, the anniversary month of Edgar Allan Poe’s mysterious end.\n\nRe-reading international best-selling author Albert Jack’s piece on Poe’s death got us thinking again: the crucial facts of Poe’s demise are so far just that, a collection of random facts, and much of these facts come from unreliable witnesses. In terms of public awareness, an understanding of Poe’s death is exactly where it was the day after Poe’s death in 1849. There’s a laundry list of theories, but all are mere guesses. Nothing in the case has “come together” with any specificity or causal certainty.\n\nPoe scholar John Walsh (Midnight Dreary: The Mysterious Death Of Edgar Poe, 1998) did the world a great service by demolishing the “cooping theory” and putting Poe’s contemporary, author Elizabeth Oakes Smith’s, published claim that Poe was physically assaulted, back on the table. Unfortunately Oakes Smith didn’t tell us enough, and Walsh’s own theory that Poe was murdered by Poe’s fiance Elmira Shelton’s brothers requires too much “filling-in,” relying on too many things that might have happened.\n\nTo see Poe’s death as foul play, we need to do two things: first, separate what might have happened from what actually did happen. Secondly—and Poe’s own fictional detective, Dupin, provided his readers with this advice: seek out elements joined by a cause, by what cannot be mere coincidence or accident. In other words, we add coincidence to coincidence until it can no longer be a coincidence. Applying these two principles to the widest possible field of factual evidence of Poe’s recorded, social existence, we find the following:\n\nDr. Joseph Snodgrass. He is crucial for the following reasons:\n\n1. Location, location, location.\n\nPoe was found near-death, at an unplanned stop in Baltimore, on a 240 mile journey from Richmond to Philadelphia. Poe’s 240 mile journey ended—for a reason no one has ever ascertained—a couple of blocks from Snodgrass’ home. For this single fact alone, Snodgrass should be a “person of interest.” This is the first coincidence.\n\n2. Joseph Walker and the Sun\n\nPoe left Richmond on September 27 and his whereabouts are unknown until October 3. We know that a man named Joseph Walker found Poe, because on October 3rd, Walker wrote a note to Dr. Joseph Snodgrass:\n\nThere is a gentleman, rather the worse for wear, at Ryan’s Fourth Ward Polls, who goes under the cognomen of Edgar A. Poe, and who appears in great distress, & he says he is acquainted with you, and I assure you, he is in need of immediate assistance. Yours, in haste, Jos. W. Walker.\n\nWalker, like Snodgrass, worked for the Baltimore Sun.\n\nFor seven days, upon leaving Richmond, Poe is off the radar, until two employees of the Baltimore Sun (Snodgrass the writer, Walker, a typesetter) discover him, the world-renowned author, in a life-threatening condition on October 3, and here is the only thing the Sun has to say about the whole matter, on October 7:\n\nWe regret to learn that Edgar A. Poe, Esq., the distinguished American poet, scholar and critic, died in this city yesterday morning, after an illness of four or five days. This announcement, coming so sudden and unexpected, will cause poignant regret among all who admire genius, and have sympathy for the frailties too often attending it.\n\n3. Snodgrass and the “Bestial Intoxicatin” alteration\n\nJoseph Walker, the Baltimore Sun mechancial who wrote the note to Dr. Snodgrass, disappears and is never heard from again. Of that crucial window on October 3rd—when Poe turns up, “rather the worse for wear”— Snodgrass’s published remembrance is all we have to go on. In one of his published reflections, Snodgrass informed his reading public that Walker’s note did not say “worse for wear,” but instead, according to Snodgrass,”bestial intoxication.” Snodgrass, a Temperance Man, changed the note in public view in order to libel Poe in a manner commonly used by Poe’s enemies.\n\n4. The sole witnesses are…\n\nThere are no other witnesses to Poe’s discovery on October 3, even though Ryan’s, a tavern and polling place on that election day on October 3, was crowded. According to Snodgrass, when he arrives at Ryan’s on the afternoon of October 3, Henry Herring, a uncle-by-marriage of Poe’s, is there. Herring, who doesn’t like Poe, refuses to take him into his home.\n\nSnodgrass and Herring give Poe to the care of a lunatic physician at a decrepit hospital—Dr. Moran later publishes unreliable and melodramatic reports of Poe’s death.\n\nNo other witnesses recognized Poe; except for the bedside ravings of Moran, it is only Snodgrass himself, armed with Walker’s (convenient?) note, who informs the public of Poe’s demise. Only the testimony of Dr. Snodgrass (and the typsetter Walker’s note) places Poe at Ryan’s Tavern at all.\n\n5. As Poe dies at the hands of a “friend” and Baltimore Sun journalist, the whole world is kept in the dark\n\nFrom October 3rd to the 7th, when Poe’s death is briefly announced in the Sun, no other members of Poe’s family, nor any of his friends, are told anything—except for Neilson Poe, Poe’s cousin.\n\n6. Hasty burial without an autopsy overseen by…\n\nNeilson Poe and Joseph Snodgrass oversee Poe’s hasty burial—without an autopsy.\n\n7. And the final coincidence…\n\nSeveral years prior to Poe’s death, there is a window of many months in which Poe and Snodgrass corresponded, and in that correspondance Poe confesses to Snodgrass how much he hates his cousin, Neilson Poe.\n\nIn summary: No autopsy, hasty burial, and “found” by Baltimore Sun libeler 2 blocks from detour on a 240 mile journey, who was sole witness to the “finding,” and teamed with hated family members to keep everything as murky as possible.\n\nCoincidence?"
