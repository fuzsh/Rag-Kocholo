        "text": "This book is a brief review of poetry translation theorem. The three pieces are the poems by Kahlil Gibran, William Shakespeare, and Robert Frost which are translated into Thai poetry of a Thai poet -- Chettapat Wisaijorn who is the author of the book himself. Chettapat Wisaijorn is the pseudonym of Thanachate Wisaijorn. After he won the Young Thai Artist Award in 2004 and 2005 respectively, his collections of poetry -- On the BTS Sleeper and The Holy War -- were published by Nanmee Books. He also had his Spanish - Thai translation published. The book is titled as \"Los Siete Poderes\" by Alex Rovira Celma.\n\nAlthough International Poetry Review (IPR) reserves space for works originally written in English, it emphasizes the English translation of works written in another language. The successes and failures of any translation arise from the complex relationship between author and translator, including their respective languages and cultures. Translations can even be thought of as rewrites, given that translators follow the seismic traces of an author's thought processes in the original text, then recreate them for a new audience. Translations recreate these moments in a new light for a new audience. The reader's relationship with the translator, then, depends upon trust. This issue of IPR is dedicated to translators, whose work provides this journal with its distinctive mark.\n\nTrying to reformulate a poem in English is a way of going deeply into the mind of a poet who has spoken to me. It’s a kind of appreciation, a kind of touching. Maybe a way of “taming” a mind that lives in another language. And it’s a way of probing the nature of the poet’s language and my own. These translations are an anthology of poems that appeal to me, poems that express themes that I write about in my journals and in my own poems. The collection includes translations from 13 languages: Dutch, Afrikaans, Swedish, German, Yiddish, Hebrew, Turkish, Russian, Spanish, Ladino, Portuguese, French, and Italian.\n\nTranslating poetry is the challenge of capturing the meaning and the beauty in a poem in one language and transferring them to another language. This essay revolves around my experience for over fifty years in translating Korean, English, Malay, Bruneian, and Persian poetry into Arabic, and translating Arabic, Persian, Turkish, and Indian poetry to English. In the essay, I discuss the difficulties I encountered and the strategies I have used in translating all these literary poetic works. The essay recounts a pioneering experience in translating Eastern works of literature, including Korean, Malaysian, and Bruneian poetry.\n\nAbstract: A poem in translation goes through various changes! The article tries to explain and analyze the factors, which affect the process of translation. Bringing poem from a source language to target language is influenced by key factors like Tradition and History of the Literature, Poet, Medium (Language) and Translator. How each factor plays an important role while a poem is being conceived and later on expressed is also explained in the article. Similarly, when the process of translation initiates how these factors become a challenge for the translator is emphasized followed by the analysis of the role of the translator. The „uniqueness‟ of the poem created due to these factors is also discussed in the article which subsequently emerge as fundamental questions for the translator with an expectation for an answer. However, the product of translation is not discussed much in the article, as the focus of the article is the process of translation of a poem. Keywords:\n\nThis paper is an attempt to describe the process through which a translator needs to go when translating poetry. Poetry has been part of human civilization since the earliest times; it has derived from the oral tradition and has evolved through centuries into a distinct genre with particular characteristics in terms of structure, form, style, language and other specific features which differentiate it from prose. In the past, poetry has been translated mostly by poets; nevertheless, it seems possible that an individual who has been properly trained and with some practice and passion can produce good quality translation of poetic works. An exercise in translation of a seventeenth-century poem by Andrew Marvell in this paper is based on theory of equivalence to show several aspects of translating, namely the visual, semantic and aesthetic ones, which could pose challenges for translators but which could be addressed and overcome with adequate training. The translator needs to approach..."
