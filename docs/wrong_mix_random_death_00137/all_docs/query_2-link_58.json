I had a\n\nhighly fashionable audience, but Norfolk is a small place\n\n& there were 2 exhibitions the same night.\n\nNext Monday I lecture again here & expect to have\n\na large audience.

Poe is\n\nstill among the living. The newspapers, in announcing\n\nhis death, have only told a truth, which we may weep\n\nover & deplore, but cannot change. He died on Sunday\n\nmorning, about 5 o'clock, at the Washington Medical\n\nCollege, where he had been since the Wednesday pre-\n\nceding. At what time he arrived in this City,\n\nwhere he spent the time he was here, or under what\n\ncircumstances, I have been unable to ascertain.\n\nIt appears that, on Wednesday, he was seen & recog-\n\nnised at one of the places of election in old town,\n\nand that his condition was such as to render it nec-\n\nessary to send him to the college, where he\n\nwas tenderly nursed until the time of his death.\n\nAs soon as I heard that he was at the college, I\n\nwent over, but his physicians did not think it\n\nadvisable that I should see him, as he was very\n\nexcitable  The next day I called & sent him\n\nchanges of linen &c. and was gratified to\n\nlearn that he was much better, & I was\n\nnever so much shocked, in my life, as when,\n\non Sunday morning, notice was sent to me\n\nthat he was dead. Mr Herring & myself immediately\n\n-- Page 2 --\n\ntook the necessary steps for his funeral, which took\n\nplace on Monday afternoon at four o clock. He\n\nlies alongside his ancestors in the Presbyterian\n\nburying ground on Green Street \n\nI assure you, My dear Madam, that, if I\n\nhad known where a letter would reach you, I would\n\nhave communicated the melancholy tidings in\n\ntime to enable you to attend his funeral \n\nbut I was wholly ignorant how to address you  The\n\nbody was followed to the grave by Mr Herring, Dr\n\nSnodgrass, Mr. Z. Collins Lee, (an old classmate) and\n\nmyself. The service was performed by the Rev\n\nWm T. D. Clemm, a son of James L. Clemm. Mr\n\nHerring & myself have sought, in vain, for the\n\ntrunk & clothes of Edgar. There is reason to believe\n\nthat he was robbed of them, whilst in such a condition\n\nas to render him insensible of his loss \n\nI shall not attempt the useless task of\n\nconsoling you under such a bereavement  Edgar\n\nhad seen so much of sorrow  had so little reason to be\n\nsatisfied with life  that, to him, the change can\n\nscarcely be said to be a misfortune  If it\n\nleaves you lonely in this world of trouble, may I\n\nbe allowed the friendly privilege of expressing\n\nthe hope that, in the contemplation of the\n\nworld to which he has gone & to which we\n\nare all hastening,  you will find consolations\n\nenduring & all sufficient  I shall be glad, at\n\n-- Page 3 --\n\nall times, to hear from you, & to alleviate, in\n\nevery way in my power, the sorrows to which\n\nthis dispensation may expose you  I only wish\n\nmy ability was equal to my disposition \n\nMy wife unites with me in expressions\n\nof sympathy.\n\ntruly your friend & servant\n\nNeilson Poe\n\nA letter that talks about Poe's death as the possible result of \"cooping\"\n\nImages courtesy of University of Virginia Library Special Collections\n\nClick the image to view the full-size document.

Moran never explains the cause of Poe's death, assuming that Mrs. Clemm already knew about the disease that led to his death. Many have speculated about this. If you'd like to try your hand at solving this real mystery, try this online adventure.\n\n/> /> Your browser does not support the audio element.\n\nAudio:\n\nTranscription:\n\nBalte. City & Marine Hospital, Nov. 15/49\n\nMrs. Clemm,\n\nMy dear Madam,\n\nI take the earliest oppor-\n\ntunity of responding to yours of the 9th Inst., which came to hand by\n\nyesterday's mail.\n\nYour deep solicitude, Madam, in reference to\n\nthe \"last moments\" of him of whom you write, does not surprise me.\n\nIt falls to the lot of but few, to enjoy the extensive popularity\n\nthat was unquestionably his. Wherever talent  mental worth, nay\n\nGenius, was prized, there \"E. A. Poe\" had warm friends. To his rarely\n\ngifted mind are we indebted for many of the brightest thoughts that\n\nadorn our literatureto him is Belles Lettres indebted for the purest\n\ngems her Casket Contains, \"Poe is gone\"! How many hearts have\n\nheaved a sigh in uttering these three words! How many thousands\n\nwill yet, and for years to come, lament the premature demise\n\nof this truly great man! Nor can there be found, in the list\n\nof his enemies ( what great man ever lived without them?) one\n\nindividual, who will withhold from him the meed of praise to which\n\nyou refer  when you speak of his \"nobility of soul.\" Posterity\n\nwill not hesitate to award him a place in the Catalogue of\n\nthose whose pens have strewn flowers in the pathway of life-flowers\n\ntoo, whose fragrance will last for the enjoyment of unborn mil-\n\nlions, thereby preserving a memorial more lasting than the\n\nSculptor's Chisel or the Art of the Statuary could ever fabricate\n\nor invent  But now for the required intelligence\n\n-- Page 2 --\n\nPresuming you are already aware of the malady of which\n\nMr. Poe died I need only state concisely the particulars of\n\nhis circumstances from his entrance until his decease \n\nWhen brought to the Hospital he was unconscious of\n\nhis condition  who brought him or with whom he had been\n\nassociating. He remained in this condition from 5. Ock in\n\nthe afternoon  the hour of his admission  until 3 next morning.\n\nThis was on the 3rd Oct.\n\nTo this state succeeded tremor of\n\nof the limbs, and at first a busy, but not violent or active de=\n\n=lirium  constant talking  and vacant converse with spectral\n\nand imaginary objects on the walls. His face was pale and\n\nhis whole person drenched in perspiration  We were unable\n\nto induce tranquillity before the second day after his admission.\n\nHaving left orders with the nurses to that effect, I was\n\nsummoned to his bedside so soon as conscious supervened, and\n\nquestioned him in reference to his family  place of residence \n\nrelatives &c. But his answers were incoherent & unsatisfactory.\n\nHe told me, however, he had a wife in Richmond (which, I have\n\nsince learned was not the fact) that he did not know when\n\nhe left that city or what had become of his trunk of clothing\n\n. Wishing to rally and sustain his now fast sinking hopes\n\nI told him I hoped, that in a few days he would be able to\n\nenjoy the society of his friends here, and I would be most\n\nhappy to contribute in every possible way to his ease & comfort.\n\nAt this he broke out with much energy, and said the best\n\nthing his best friend could do would be to blow out his\n\nbrains with a pistol  that when he beheld his degradation\n\nhe was ready to sink in the earth &c\" Shortly after giving\n\n-- Page 3 --\n\nexpression to these words Mr. Poe seemed to dose & I left him for a\n\nshort time, When I returned I found him in a violent delirium,\n\nresisting the efforts of two nurses to keep him in bed. This state\n\ncontinued until Saturday evening (he was admitted on Wednesday) when\n\nhe commenced calling for one \"Reynolds\", which he did through the\n\nnight up to three on Sunday morning. At this time a very\n\ndecided change began to affect him. Having become enfeebled\n\nfrom exertion he became quiet and seemed to rest for a short\n\ntime, then gently moving his head he said \"Lord help my poor\n\nSoul\" and expired!\n\nThis, Madam, is as faithful an account\n\nas I am able to furnish from the Record of his case.\n\nMrs. Chapman was not with him. but he lacked nothing\n\nwhich the utmost assiduity of nurses and myself could sup\n\nply. Indeed we considered Mr. Poe an object of unusual regard.\n\nMedical men & Students of the House sympathized earnestly\n\nwith him, Your imperative request urges me to be candid,\n\nelse I should not have been this plain. Rather far would I\n\ncancel his errors than even hint a fault of his.\n\nHis remains were visited by some of the first individuals\n\nof the city, many of them anxious to have a lock of his hair.\n\nThose who had previously known him pronounced his corpse the\n\nmost natural they had ever seen. Z. Collins Lee Esq. and\n\nNelson Poe with many other respectable individuals attended\n\nhis funeral  The Revd. Mr. Clemm of this city attended officially on\n\nthe occasion.\n\nI have, thus, complied with your request, Madam,\n\nand therefore subscribe myself respectfully yours\n\nJ. J. Moran, Res.
