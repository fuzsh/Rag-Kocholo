        "text": "Sir Rex Harrison, who excelled as the ever-so-proper Professor Henry Higgins in both the stage and screen versions of My Fair Lady, grew accustomed to several faces in real life. Like Henry VIII  his portrayal of whom in 1948's Anne of a Thousand Days earned him his first Tony Award  he had six wives (none of whom were Elizabeth Taylor, his co-star in Cleopatra). Harrison's fourth wife, actress Rachel Roberts, became particularly well-known for her drunken antics during the filming of the disastrous Doctor Doolittle. Sadly, she committed suicide several years after their divorce.\n\nNext Henry VIII"
