        "text": "Rex Harrison (born March 5, 1908, Huyton, Lancashire, England—died June 2, 1990, New York, New York, U.S.) was an English stage and film actor best known for his portrayals of urbane, eccentric English gentlemen in sophisticated comedies and social satires.\n\nAfter graduating from secondary school at age 16, Harrison began a stage apprenticeship with the Liverpool Repertory Theatre. He first appeared on the London stage in 1930, the same year his first film, The Great Game, was released. Throughout the 1930s, Harrison divided his time nearly equally between the stage and the screen, scoring a noted stage success with his role in Noël Coward’s Design for Living (1939–41). During World War II, Harrison served as a flight lieutenant in the Royal Air Force. He achieved stardom after the war with highly praised roles in the films Blithe Spirit and The Rake’s Progress (both 1945). His first American film was the popular Anna and the King of Siam (1946).\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nOscar-Worthy Movie Trivia\n\nFrom the late 1940s through most of the ’50s, Harrison spent much of his time on the New York stage. Harrison won a Tony Award for his performance as Henry VIII in Anne of the Thousand Days (1948–49). His greatest stage triumph came during the 1956–59 seasons with his portrayal of Henry Higgins in My Fair Lady, Lerner and Loewe’s musical adaptation of George Bernard Shaw’s Pygmalion. Because he was hopeless as a singer—Loewe once remarked that Harrison had a vocal range of one and a half notes—Harrison developed a technique of talking his way through songs that proved highly effective. For his performance, he won a second Tony Award. He repeated the role for Warner Brothers’s lavish 1964 screen adaptation and was awarded the Oscar for best actor.\n\nDuring the 1970s Harrison continued to appear in motion pictures and on New York and London stages, and in 1980 he recreated the role of Higgins in a successful touring production of My Fair Lady. Harrison, who once stated that Shaw was his “contemporary in thought and feeling,” gave the greatest performance of his later years as the philosophical and mystical Captain Shotover in the 1983 Broadway and London productions of Shaw’s Heartbreak House, which was adapted into a television film in 1986. Harrison’s final performance was in a 1990 revival of Somerset Maugham’s The Circle, in which he appeared until one month before his death. He was knighted in 1989."
