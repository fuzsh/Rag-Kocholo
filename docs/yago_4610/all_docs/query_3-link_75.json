        "text": "NEW YORK -- Stage and screen actor Sir Rex Harrison, whose Professor Henry Higgins in 'My Fair Lady' was the most unforgettable role in a distinguished career, died Saturday of pancreatic cancer three weeks after dropping out of a hit Broadway show. He was 82.\n\nHarrison quit 'The Circle' May 11, one week before its scheduled closing, in the belief that he was suffering from a gall bladder inflammation. He was not hospitalized, but remained at his Manhattan apartment reading plays 'to see what he would do next,' according to his attorney, Harold Schiff.\n\nWith him when he died early Saturday was his sixth wife, the former Mercia Tinker, and two sons by prior marriages, Noel and Carey Harrison.\n\nSchiff said a memorial service will be held June 18 at the Church of the Transfiguration in New York, the so-called Little Church Around the Corner that has many actors in its congregation. Funeral services will be private.\n\nHarrison, whose primary residence was in Monaco, opened in a revival of W. Somerset Maugham's comedy 'The Circle' last Nov. 20, co-starring with stage and screen veterans Glynis Johns and Stewart Granger. They were enthusiastically received by critics and audiences and the play was nominated for a best revival Tony Award.\n\n'The last three weeks of the run, he was in pain, but we were told he had gallstones,' said Elliott Martin, producer of 'The Circle' and three previous Broadway plays starring Harrison. 'One day he stood in the middle of the stage and told me, 'The next play we do, we must use a different kind of set.'\n\n'He was a consummate artist, a stickler for perfection on stage and, if anything was out of line or not in good taste, he would blow up. He really loved the stage and all it stands for in our lives.'\n\nHarrison's passion for the theater started in 1915 when, at age 7, he saw a Christmas pantomime in his native England and rushed home to imitate it. He began acting with the Liverpool Repertory Company and moved to London to work in West End theaters in 1927, changing his name from Reginald Carey Harrison to Rex Harrison.\n\n'I wasn't a success overnight,' he once said. 'I just slowly worked my way up, and some times were quite rough. I had no education, maybe because I simply wasn't able to take one in.'\n\nHe found his metier in the 1930s in such sophisticated comedies as Noel Coward's 'Design for Living' and Terence Rattigan's 'French Without Tears' and soon became known as 'the greatest actor in light comedy in the world.'\n\nHe first appeared on Broadway in 'Sweet Aloes' in 1936 and subsequently starred in 'Bell, Book and Candle' and as an unforgettable Henry VIII in 'Anne of a Thousand Days,' which won him his first Tony Award.\n\nHollywood was quick to seize on the 6-foot-2, slender and handsome talent, and Harrison starred as Caesar in 'Cleopatra,' for which he won a Tony nomination, 'Major Barbara,' 'Blythe Spirit,' and 'Dr. Dolittle.'\n\nBut his most memorable role was Higgins in 'My Fair Lady,' a musical adaptation of George Bernard Shaw's 'Pygmalion,' a role Harrison created on Broadway in 1957 for another Tony Award, and recreated on the screen in 1964, winning an Academy Award.\n\nHe returned to Broadway in 1981 for a rerun of 'My Fair Lady' and in 1985 for a revival of Frederick Lonsdale's 'Aren't We All,' opposite Claudette Colbert.\n\nHe was knighted by Queen Elizabeth in 1989, a honor many -- including Harrison -- thought long overdue. He attributed the delay to his residence outside Great Britain to avoid income taxes.\n\n'The queen doesn't like that,' he said in a 1985 interview with United Press International.\n\nHarrison voiced a vague regret that the role of Higgins overshadowed his distinguished career and even his complicated and much publicized private life. He tried to redress the balance in an autobiography, 'Rex,' written in 1974 at the suggestion of former British Prime Minister Harold Macmillan.\n\nThe portrait that emerged was the one the public had divined long before -- a man whose professional charm harked back to prewar matinee idols and whose meticulous dress and manners could only have derived from his own chosen lifestyle, that of a debonair, occasionally gruff English gentleman.\n\nHarrison's contemporaries admired his acting techniques. Sir Laurence Olivier was one of those influenced by it. Noel Coward, in a double-edged tribute, said: 'Rex never listens to other actors.'\n\n'Good actors will always make you listen,' Harrison said when told of Coward's comment. 'But if they're terribly bad, it's better not to listen.'\n\nHis autobiography did shed some new light, but mostly on the loves and marriages that earned him the nickname 'Sexy Rexy.' He was able to deny the claim of his second wife, actress Lilli Palmer, that he divorced her and married his third wife, actress Kay Kendall, only because he knew she was dying from leukemia and wanted to ease her last days.\n\nHis first wife, Colette Thomas, was the mother of his son, Noel. Miss Palmer was the mother of his other son, Carey.\n\nHis fourth wife, actress Rachel Roberts, committed suicide in 1971. She blamed herself for the breakup of their marriage and the biggest quarrel of the divorce was who would get custody of their basset hound. Rex won.\n\nHis fifth wife, Elizabeth, beautiful and tempestuous daughter of Lord Ogmore and former wife of actor Richard Harris, said she was content with a 'generous' settlement but dropped more than a hint about the cause of the divorce.\n\n'He insisted that at a quarter to 12 and a quarter to 6 every day, ice had to be put in the morning room, the drawing room and his study so he could have a drink wherever he decided,' she said. 'It mustn't be put out at 10 to 12 or 20 to 6, but exactly at a quarter to.\n\n'We always changed for dinner even if it was the two of us. He'd get very upset if I didn't.'\n\nHarrison's married his sixth wife, Mercia, a beautiful Anglo-Indian, in Monte Carlo in 1979.\n\n'I used to think that actors should be married to actresses, but now I see that is garbage,' Harrison said at the time. 'Actors should be married to wives. From Mercia, I have learned the art of living and loving at last.'\n\nWhen he was offered the role of Higgins by 'My Fair Lady' author and composer, Alan Jay Lerner and Frederick Lowe, he almost turned it down.\n\nBut he and his wife at the time, Kay Kendall, were looking for a reason to stay in the United States. He said that was the only reason he accepted.\n\n'I had terrible doubts about it in rehearsal,' he said. 'After all, the only previous musical adaptation of Shaw had been simply terrible. I suppose I did put an awful lot of myself in, including that bloody cardigan, but it became a double-edged sword in that it took me years to escape from the character afterwards.'\n\nLerner and Lowe may have had their own doubts. They once half jested that Harrison had a vocal range of one and a half notes. But Harrison's performance was not that of a singer. On stage, he was a superlative actor pretending to sing, but really talking on pitch.\n\nHe had a financial deal that made him wealthy: 10 percent of the gross and 5 percent of the huge record sales.\n\nIn the revival of 1980-81, he was paid an estimated $50,000 a week.\n\nReginald Carey Harrison was born March 5, 1908, in a suburb of Liverpool. At 16, stimulated by unexpected applause in a school play, he was given a chance by the Liverpool Repertory. He played the husband in 'Thirty Minutes In a Street.' The manager, he once recalled, came backstage after the performance 'and begged me with tears in his eyes' to give up acting.\n\nThat was March 30, 1924.\n\nMore than 65 years later, on June 17, 1989, Harrison was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II. He opened on Broadway last November with Glynnis Johns and Stewart Granger in a revival of 'The Circle,' by W. Somerset Maugham, a play about a British member of Parliament whose career in a romantic scandal.\n\nOn Nov. 26, 1927, he made his London debut as the Hon. Freddie Thrippleton in 'Getting George Married.'\n\nHis first film role came in 1929 when Alexander Korda offered him a $100-a-week contract. He made his New York stage debut in March 1936 at the Booth Theater in 'Sweet Aloes.' His first real triumph came in London in November of that year in Terence Rattigan's 'French Without Tears.'\n\nSix-foot-2, slender and handsome, Harrison was much in demand and plum roles followed each other -- Coward's 'Design for Living,' and, after two years' war service in the Royal Air Force Voluntary Reserve, Coward's film, 'Blithe Spirit' and more plays -- T.S.Eliot's 'The Cocktail Party,' 'Bell Book and Candle' in New York and London, 'Venus Observed,' 'The Love of Four Colonels.'\n\nThe summit of his career came in 1956 with 'My Fair Lady' and a performance ranked by critics alongside John Gielgud's 'Hamlet' and Olivier's 'Richard III.'\n\n'I wasn't an overnight success,' Harrison once said. 'I just slowly worked my way up. And some times were quite rough. I had no real education, maybe because I simply wasn't capable of taking one in.'\n\nWhen he was offered the role of Higgins in 'My Fair Lady' by the author and composer, Alan Jay Lerner and Frederick Lowe, he almost turned down one of the greatest roles in musical comedy history. But he and his wife at the time, Kay Kendall, were looking for a reason to stay in the United States. He said that was the only reason he accepted.\n\n'I had terrible doubts about it in rehearsal,' he said. 'After all, the only previous musical adaptation of Shaw had been simply terrible. I suppose I did put an awful lot of myself in, including that bloody cardigan, but it became a double-edged sword in that it took me years to escape from the character afterwards.'\n\nLerner and Lowe may have had their own doubts. They once half jested that Harrison had a vocal range of one and a half notes. But Harrison's performance was not that of a singer.

At a time when stars tried to cultivate the man-next-door image, he was nobody's neighbor. He sometimes took artistic chances. He and Richard Burton played homosexuals in the film 'Staircase' before gay liberation became an organized cause.\n\nElizabeth Taylor, then married to Burton, said they were two of the few in Hollywood able to camp without suspicion because of their legendary masculinity."
