Invitations were fiercely fought for, but one man had been top of the guest list: Rex Harrison, after years on the fringes of Hollywood fame, was suddenly the man every movie-maker wanted. After a smash hit on Broadway in My Fair Lady, Harrison, an elegant 49, was in Hollywood to negotiate a $1 million fee to star in the movie. He had a new love in his life - 29-year-old comedy star Kay Kendall. Life surely could not be better for the man Hollywood regarded as the typical English gentleman\n\nIn fact Rex Harrison was living a tragic lie. Only a few close friends knew that Kay Kendall, with whom he had starred in the movie The Constant Husband, the woman he was about to marry, had less than two years to live. And that secret was not shared by Kay herself. Harrison needed all his acting skills to pretend that things had never been better. But the sophisticated veneer was destined to finally crack that night ... and the unwitting cause was Frank Sinatra.\n\nKay was in Hollywood making an MGM musical, Les Girls. She had no idea she was dying of leukaemia but complained of tiredness. Excited to be in Hollywood she dragged Rex to all the fashionable parties. He knew she should be at home resting but dared not say so for fear of arousing her suspicions. Around midnight she found Kay out on the chilly terrace chatting to Frank Sinatra, a man he had never liked. Worry and jealousy finally got the better of him. \"Come home at once,\" he snapped. \"It's past your bedtime.\"\n\n\"But I'm so admiring Frank's shirt,\" she protested with a smile. \"Don't you think it's beautiful \" \"I don't give a damn about his shirt\", snarled Harrison, seizing her arm. \"Come home.\"\n\n\"It's just an old shirt, Rex,\" said Sinatra. \"A bit off-white -sort of yellow. That's your favourite colour isn't it \"\n\nRex Harrison knew instantly what he meant. Nine years earlier his lover Carole Landis had committed suicide mainly it was claimed through Rex Harrison's heartless behaviour. He had found her body but immediately left the scene fearing bad publicity. On the day of her funeral he was playing golf.\n\nSinatra had declared at the time that Rex Harrison was yellow and now he repeated it. Harrison lunged forward and slapped his face. Sinatra repeated: \"It's still yellow\" and Harrison struck him again. Kay Kendall screamed and ran away from the scene. A friend pulled Rex away and Sinatra calmly walked back into the house. As an onlooker later reported: \"Frank's self-control was amazing. He could have torn the guy apart.\"\n\nBut no one could deny that the often heartless Harrison was now deeply devoted to Kay Kendall. Her doctor had broken the news of her incurable illness to him and he had decided not to tell her. Instead he would marry her and take care of her for as long as she had to live. They married in New York in June 1957 and honeymooned in Switzerland where they visited Charlie Chaplin.\n\nThey moved into a EeAu100 a week chalet in St Moritz but Kay became so ill that she was rushed to a clinic. Miraculously she recovered and was back on the ski slopes four days later.\n\nNot even Columbia Pictures knew the truth about her health - the routine medical check for insurance purposes did not include a blood test - and she accepted a starring role in Once More, With Feeling opposite Yul Brynner. But a week or two into shooting she came down with a fever.\n\n\"She was very brave,\" remembers director Stanley Donen. \"Everything was now a major effort. I think she now knew her state of health was serious because she said to me one day: 'Can we shoot as much as possible today I don't know if I'll be here tomorrow...'\n\nHer prophesy was tragically accurate. The next day she collapsed on the way to the studio and doctors recommended a spell in hospital. Rex Harrison booked the best room in the London clinic and flew his wife over by private plane.\n\nAt the door of the clinic Kay turned to reporters and said: \"I'm only here for a couple of days for a rest.\" But when she came out it would be in a coffin. Rex kept a round-the-clock vigil as she was given blood transfusions and appeared to rally. But hope was short-lived. On September 5, 1959, she said to her husband: \"Rex, I'm not going to die am I \" \"Of course not,\" he snapped. \"Don't be so stupid. See you tomorrow.\" Then he went outside the room and wept.\n\nSoon afterwards Kay Kendall went into a coma and died the next morning without regaining consciousness. Rex was holding her hand. She was 32. She told friends that her time with Rex was the happiest of her life.\n\nFor several hours that long afternoon no one could find Rex Harrison. It was years later that he revealed he had gone into a nearby church. Did he go to pray \"No, I just sat. Kay would have laughed at the thought of anyone praying for her, especially me.\"\n\nWhen Rex Harrison died aged 82 in 1990 his sixth wife, Mercia Tinker, was by his bedside. She had not told her husband that he had terminal stomach cancer. \"I did for Rex what he had done for Kay,\" she said. \"It seemed the least I could do...\"\n\n(Follow timesofoman.com on Facebook and on Twitter for updates that you can share with your friends.)\n\nMuscat Press and Publishing House SAOC 2012\n\nProvided by Syndigate.info an Albawaba.com company"
