        "text": "English Woman – Mar 11th 1961\n\nMY LIFE STORY continued by\n\nDIRK BOGARDE\n\n“The dressing-room walls were going to crush me!”\n\nMAKING a decision to buy a house of your own is a landmark in anyone’s life. I decided to buy Beel House in the Buckinghamshire town of Amersham in January, 1954, three months before my thirty-third birthday. It marked a turning point in my life.\n\nFor the first time I acknowledged that I could afford roots of my own, that I had found, built, and could perhaps keep, a way of life both satisfactory and rewarding.\n\nThis was a new outlook for me, for nothing had ever seemed very permanent before. Till I was twenty I’d struggled for the chance to be an actor. Then, when success came so swiftly alter six years of war, I hadn’t really believed it could last.\n\nWhen Rank had given me a seven years’ contract it was optional, on their part. I had never really believed they would take up those options to employ me in the making of twenty films in seven years. But they did, and had now given me another contract.\n\nIT was with this knowledge that I walked with Kay Kendall, always Kate to me, across the muddy fields from my rented home, Bendrose, to look at Beel House, which was for sale. It was a horror.\n\nBleak and empty, few of its twenty-six rooms caught the sun, and the garden surrounding it was a tangle of overgrown rosebeds, dank shrubberies, laurel and ivy.\n\nInside it seemed a labyrinth of corridors and stone passages. It was painted throughout in dejected yellow and brown, and each room had a rusty gas fire in it.\n\nKate walked round with me in increasing gloom. A man and woman who had finished viewing it met us. “Don’t waste your time,” the woman said with a shiver. “It’s impossible.” That decided me. ‘I’m going to buy it,” I told Kate. “I can demolish all that warren of passages at the back, strip all the muck away and let some sunlight get to the place.” When this was done I moved in and began the work of restoring the house to the mellowed pleasantness of the Georgian period to which it belonged.\n\nI spent every spare moment finding bits and pieces which went with the character of the lovely old rooms.\n\nSoon Beel became the sort of home I’d envisaged, welcoming, comfortable, and run on silk-smooth wheels by an Austrian husband and wife, Hans and Agnes.\n\nTo any of my friends who visited me at Beel – Rex Harrison, Joshua Logan, his wife, Moss and Kitty Hart, Margaret Leighton, Laurence Harvey – it was Hans and Agnes who were famous. They took over my home and ran it to perfection.\n\nEven when I was away, filming, any of my friends who were tired could go to Beel and stay, knowing they would be looked after and fussed over by Hans and Agnes in what Kate had dubbed as “the home of rest and the outpatients’ department.”\n\n“The outpatients’ department” was the huge glass garden room which looked on to the gardens and caught the day’s full sun.\n\nSITTING in the “outpatients” one day Kate asked if she could bring Rex Harrison down for a rest. She was filming with him in a comedy, The Constant Husband.\n\n“He’s nice,” said Kate emphatically. “He’d fit in. You’d like him.”\n\n“But do you think Rex will like our sort of gardening, pottering-about weekends?” I asked her doubtfully.\n\nRex did, and insisted on spending his first afternoon planting out all my antirrhinums. In this he set a pattern. It seemed that all my friends wanted to garden.\n\nTowards the end of 1955 when I had finished making Doctor At Sea, the American director Lewis Milestone asked me if he could bring “a couple of kids down.”\n\nThey arrived, a pretty girl and her husband, a youngish looking man who wore glasses.\n\nHis name was Alan Jay Lerner and after Sunday lunch he told me be bad just written a musical with composer Fritz Loewe. “It’s Bernard Shaw’s Pygmalion, and we’re calling it Lady Liza,” he said.\n\nI exploded on the spot. “Pygmalion a musical! It’s preposterous.” Alan smiled the smile of a man well used to such indignation. “I’m in England because I want to persuade Rex Harrison to play Professor Higgins.” “Well, you’ll never get him,” I told him decidedly, “he wouldn’t help turn Shaw into A musical!”\n\nAgain Alan smiled that under- standing smile. “D’you think you could just listen to the lyrics?”\n\nI have no piano in my house. He played the now famous melodies from Lady Liza, which was retitled My Fair Lady, on an old spinet I had, sang the words of “Wouldn’t It Be Loverly” “The Rain in Spain” and some of the others.\n\n“We’ve found it impossible to meet up with Rex,” said Alan quietly.\n\n“I know he’s a friend of yours. Do you think you could possibly arrange an ‘accidental’ meeting here?”\n\nAlready the music and the brilliant lyrics fascinated me. I asked Rex and Kate down to tea. They stayed till long alter dinner and that was how My Fair Lady, with Rex playing Professor Higgins, started.\n\nAnd that is how,eighteen months later, when Rex was the king of Broadway, he telephoned me from New York: “Come over here for Christmas, Dirk, and be my guest for a change.”\n\nKate had already gone over to New York before travelling on to Hollywood where she was to make her first American picture, Les Girls.\n\n“If you come, too, we can all be together for Christmas,” she urged. It was my first visit to New York, and Kate and Rex had the keys of that exciting city to give me.\n\nIt is difficult to describe, without sounding exaggerated, the impact which Rex and My Fair Lady had made upon America, and especially New York. He was being treated like royalty.\n\nAs a retreat from this constant excitement and lionising he escaped to a beautiful country house on Long Island whenever he could. It was here he invited Kate, Cathleen Nesbitt. Margaret Leighton, Tony Forwood and his son Gareth, and me, to spend Christmas.\n\n“I’m taking charge,” Kate announced, “and it’s going to be absolutely gorgeous.”\n\nWhen we arrived at the house, Christmas poured out of its doors. The place glowed with holly, flowers, candles, trees and great log fires. Magnums of champagne stood on ice. There was a huge turkey and real English plum pudding.\n\nAnd then there were the presents which Kate had piled into stockings. She couldn’t wait for us to open them.\n\nIn the play Rex wore a cashmere sweater, which he liked because it was comfortable as well as suitable for the part.\n\nKate had been to a big New York department store and bought up every cashmere sweater they had in Rex’s size and favourite colours.\n\nBeside the great pile of sweaters was a valuable miniature of Byron she knew be admired and a rare first edition of Byron’s works, most beautifully bound in vermilion calf and tooled in gold.\n\nFor me there was a slim box. Inside it was a fountain pen of solid gold with my initials on it. There was also a great pile of records which I hadn’t been able to get in England.\n\nThe packages went on and on, for each of us something costly and wonderful. And with each exclamation of delight Kate swooped about the room hugging herself with excitement. It was characteristic that she had bought nothing for herself.\n\nDarling Kate, who knew what it was to be broke when she couldn’t get work for months on end, had given us all this fabulous Christmas – but how?\n\n“Kate, how on earth have you managed to pay for all this?” I asked worriedly as soon as I could get her to myself for a minute.\n\nShe gave me a big wink. “Why do you think I’m making Les Girls?” she asked. “I’ve borrowed ten thousand dollars in advance from the studio so we could all have a lovely Christmas together.”\n\nI think she must have spent every one of those dollars, but none of us will ever forget Kate’s Christmas. On New Year’s Eve she and Rex insisted I should go with them to the most wonderful traditional party in New York which is given by Gilbert Miller, the great theatrical impresario, and his wife Kathryn.\n\nI hate big parties. “You know I always get stuck with someone’s aunt who’s interested in museums,” I protested to Kate.\n\n“Well, you won’t at this one,” she promised. “You’ll meet everyone you’d like to meet.”\n\nThere are only two women in the film world I have ever longed to meet: Garbo and Judy Garland.\n\nThe door of the Millers’ luxurious apartment opened to admit us and to let someone out. I caught a glimpse of a pale, beautiful face as a tall, slender figure in crimson chiffon brushed past me. I realized, too late, it bad been Greta Garbo.\n\nRex and Kate were immediately engulfed by people, and I, as usual, found myself talking to someone who promptly asked me if I was interested in archaeology.\n\nKate came to drag me off to meet someone else. “No more… please, Kate…,” I began. “But you must,” said Kate. “She’s just dying to meet you.”\n\nShe tapped someone on the shoulder who spun round, held out both her hands and said in a richly familiar voice: “Dirk Bogarde, I am just MAD about you on TV.” It was Judy Garland.\n\nAll my films are shown on American television and Judy promptly started telling me about them. Meeting her was extraordinary.\n\nOne moment I had been rather ill-at-ease in a huge crowd of people I didn’t know. The next, I was sitting talking to Judy as though we had known each other all our lives. For me it suddenly began to be a wonderful party which ended too soon, but not before I bad arranged to meet Judy and her husband Sid Luft again, and they bad promised to come and stay with me at Beel.\n\nThis was the beginning of a deep and endearing friendship.\n\nJust before my holiday ended Rex asked me to take Kate to the airport to put her on the plane for Hollywood. It was a matinee day and he couldn’t leave the theatre. “Come back afterwards,” he said. “Tell me how she went off, and we’ll have some food together.”\n\nKate was grief-stricken at leaving Rex. For a long time I had seen they loved each other, and I knew now that they hoped to marry in a few months’ time.\n\nI tried to cheer her up on the way to the airport, but she would have none of it. “It’s such a waste of time,” she kept saying. “Weeks and weeks and weeks away from Rex.” “But Kate,” I protested, “this is a tremendous chance for you, and you’ll be with him again soon.”\n\n“You doo’t understand Dirk.” she said piteously. “It’s weeks, all wasted, just wasted.”\n\nBut Kate was always emotional and, apart from acknowledging that separation from Rex for a while meant a tremeodous amount to her, I didn’t think a great deal more about it.\n\nWhen I got back to the theatre Rex demanded to be told every detail of her departure. He had lent me his town apartment on Park Avenue for the rest of my stay, but when the time came for his evening performance, be said suddenly: “Don’t go back to the apartment. Come down to Long Island with me after the show and we can have a goed talk.”\n\nSomething in the way he said this made me agree, though again I put it down to nothing more than loneliness for Kate. I did not know, till many weeks down. I was afraid there was something terribly wrong with her. I only saw her at intervals now, and at each meeting I was shocked by her increasing pallor and fatigue. But, because he was with her constantly, I wondered if this steady deterioration could be as apparent to Rex as it was to me. When you see someone every day the gradual change in their appearance is often not so noticeable.\n\nMANY times I intended to ask Rex if he realised this desperate change in Kate, and always, some- thing stopped me.\n\nHe was so wonderful to her in every way and their happiness together was sueh a tremendous thing to see, that it seemed to me insufferable to ask him such a question.\n\nI had also noticed that while he was never over-solicitous when she was all right, he never left her for even an hour when he was not working.\n\nYet, though she looked ill and tired, when she badly wanted to do a play The Bright One with Gladys Cooper, he made no atkmpt to stop her, so determined was he that she should have no idea of the gravity of her condition. But he produced the play and so remained constantly at her side.\n\nWhen she bad another small collapse I could stand the uncertainty of my own fears no longer. Rightly or wrongly I told a friend of mine, a medical specialist, all the changes I had noticed in Kate.\n\nLater, when her collapses increased he admitted: “It sounds as though she has leukaemia.”\n\nThen I felt sure that Rex must know. Yet, such was the superbly convincing attitude he maintained about the future, making plans with Kate for all they would do together, that even I began to believe that what the doctor had told me, and what I saw, must be wrong.\n\nIn the late autumn when I had finished my twenty-ninth film, The Doctor’s Dilemma, I decided I would retum to the theatre again.\n\nThe decision was an important one for me. I was thirty seven, a highly paid film star, three times voted the most popular film actor. three times awarded the trophy for the best actor of the year, established and successful. But I was not happy.\n\nI could not analyse my own unease. It was not discontent, but something deeper than that. A restless, disturbing sense of unfulfilment, an emptiness which made me depressed and moody.\n\nWhen such a sense of oppression persists one becomes introspective, seeking its causes, and its remedies. And, I think, in seeking out the real causes one is often dishonest with oneself and tries to evade them. I did this.\n\nI could have looked at myself honestly and judged that though I was a successful film actor I was also a deeply lonely man with all the selfishness that an unshared personal life can bring.\n\nInstead, I left this personal, intimate judgment on one side then, though I was to make it later.\n\nIn its place I chose to believe that much of my depression and feeling of futility came from the fact that my work was not wholly satisfying.\n\nI thought if I could give the full, taxing and continuous performances that the stage demands or an actor, instead of the brief, highly concentrated but once-only portrayal which filming needs, I would know that satisfaction which comes from the knowledge of work well done.\n\nBut I had already returned to the stage three times since I signed my film contract in 1948, and each time it had been an ordeal of nerves.\n\nIn 1950 I played opposite Mai Zetterling in Point of Departure, Jean Anouilh’s compelling modern version of the classical story of the ill-fated Greek lovers, Orpheus and Eurydice. In the play Mai and I met as strangers on stage and, by looking at each other, had to transmit to ourselves and to the audience the unspoken fusion of love between us.\n\nThen, throughout the rest of the play both we, and the audience, had to be aware that as our love grew stronger so did the presence of death and tragedy.\n\nIt was a powerful play, emotionally draining. Our parts demanded everything an actor should want to give, and Mai Zetttrling was superb. I should have been glad to get into the theatre every night. Instead, I dreaded it.\n\nI stood in the wings sweating with nerves waiting for the insect-like whirr of the curtain going up.\n\nOnce on the stage I felt trapped there. The sets were small and boxed in, the lighting harshly gloomy. An unbearable sense of claustrophobia seized me and I began to see people not as people but as figures moving inside red blurred outlines.\n\nAnd all the time I was on stage I was haunted by a terrible feeling that the walls of my dressing-room were moving in to crush me, and when I returned there, they would press me to death.\n\nFearful that anyone should think I was going out of my mind I knew I must prove once and for all that those walls were moving. Each night, before I went down to the wings, I placed strips of paper along the floor against each wall.\n\nIf, when I had returned they had moved then I would know the walls had moved, too.\n\nI had only five minutes off-stage in the whole of the play, but in those five minutes I would race back to my dressing-room to look fearfully at my strips of paper.\n\nEach time they had moved. I used to stand gazing at them in sickened horror, my heart thumping. Then I’d go back to the stage, soaked in cold perspiration.\n\nIt never occurred to me to reason that every time anyone opened my dressing-room door. including myself, the draught would blow the flimsy pieces or paper about.\n\nThe tumult of my mind had gone beyond such reasoning. I couldn’t sleep, and every day was a torment of hours leading to the terror of that dressing-room and stage each night.\n\nIn the end I went to see a nerve specialist who told me bluntly: “You must leave the play. You must have five or six days of deep sleep and at least six weeks’ rest. You’ve been overworking, you’re overstrained, and you’ve got a nervous breakdown.”\n\nBut hearing my terror, claustrophobia and imaginings pinned down into the one familiar phrase “nervous breakdown” such a relief that I was perfectly sure I could go on again that night.\n\nThe specialist forbade it. But I had to go on. I struggled through the performance, feeling all the time as though I was choking.\n\nI kept saying the magic words “nervous breakdown,” as though they could be a spell to ward off all evil, but the walls of my dressing-room pressed relentlessly in on me and the paper still moved.\n\nThe next day I had to give up. I rested for a short while and then, somehow, resumed until the end of the run. But it had been a frightening experience and might have broken my nerve for the theatre.\n\nTo keep my “theatre nerve” I used the only two breaks I had in filming to return to the theatre twice after that: in a revival of Noel Coward’s The Vortex and then in a lighthearted play by Ugo Betti called Summertime.\n\nNow I was offered another play by Jean Anouilh, Jezabel, and once again, depressed and dissatisfied with myself, I decided to do it. I opened in Brighton as Kate went into rehearsal for The BrigHt One.\n\nI no longer had the same claustrophobic terror of going on stage and the play started with a great success. But all the time I felt so ill, so much at the end of everything for no reason, that when I collapsed I didn’t care whether I lived or died.\n\nI Was taken home to Beel with acute pneumonia and pleurisy. But it was the doctors, not I, who fought for my life.\n\nWhen they told me: “We’ve pulled you through the crisis,” I asked them one question: “Why?”\n\nI was obsessed with the idea that there was no particular reason for me to live.\n\nOne thing shamed me out of my depression and apathy.\n\nMy bedroom was filled with flowers, books and fruit, from Rex and Kate and all my friends.\n\nThe first telephone call I was allowed to take came from Kate, sweet, concerned and full of promise that she was feeling so much better, “and so must you, too.”\n\nHer own play, The Bright One, had folded disastrously, but now she was full of plans to make another film, Once More, With Feeling!\n\nTONY FORWOOD, who, several years before, had relinquished his career in the theatre to become my manager, and whose counsel and advice have contributed so much to my success, came in after one of these calls from Kate.\n\nHe had a film script in his hand. Columbia wanted me to make my first American film for them, the life story of Franz Liszt.\n\n“Take it away,” I said wearily. He left the script on the table by my bed. I thought or Kate, and of Rex’s courage, and despised myself. Nine months later I found a new reason for living when I went to America to make the film of Liszt and met my leading lady, Capucine.\n\nOnly three months after that my beloved Kate Kendall, who was indeed The Bright One, was dead."
