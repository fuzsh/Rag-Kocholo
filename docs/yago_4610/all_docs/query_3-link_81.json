        "text": "The Washington Star-News, Early 70s: Rex Harrison, urbane, relaxed and oozing charm from every pore, gave a low-key performance at the National Press Club luncheon yesterday that left his audience of mostly women-of-a-certain-age sighing.\n\nAs is traditional at these lunches, he started out with a speech but he just rambled a little and sort of petered out after about 10 minutes when he was ready for questions.\n\nThe most remarkable thing about playing at the Kennedy Center (he is starring in Pirandello’s “Emperor Henry IV” at the opera house there), he told his adoring audience, was, “They keep the stage door a total mystery.” At smaller theaters, students and fans come ‘round to see him after a performance but, “They can’t find me at the Kennedy Center.”\n\nAs the questions were read to him, he thought them over carefully, sometimes repeating them. “Where do I stand on women’s lib?” he mused. “Well, I really would like to stand on it,” he said, savoring the pun as the women laughed and clapped in approval.\n\n“I think it’s a very unattractive thing,” he said.\n\n“ I think it is very attractive having women dependent on men,” said the five-times wedded star of “My Fair Lady,” in which he played Henry Higgins, the classic Male Chauvinist Pig.\n\nHe was promptly asked if he was worried that his remarks would bring a picket line of outraged women to his stage door. But he had no fear. “If they can find me at the Kennedy Center,” he said with a victorious smile.\n\nHis wife, the former Elizabeth Harris, who wore a big floppy gray hat so you could only see her when you looked at her head-on, was asked, “What is the real Rex Harrison like?”\n\n“Impossible and adorable,” she said without stopping to think, and sat down.\n\nThere was a whole sheaf of questions from people who wanted to know where he got the nickname “Sexy Rexy.” “From that late lamented Walter Winchell,” said Harrison, “because it rhymed.”\n\n“If I’d been called Larry, I’d have been called something else,” he added, as the audience laughed at the possible variation on his nickname.\n\n“I want to ask you a question,” he said, in the chatty, sitting-around-in-the-living-room manner that characterized his appearance. “Do you know anyone who was christened Rex? I never have. I wasn’t christened Rex. I was christened Reginal. I never liked the idea of Reginald, actually, so I called myself Rex rather early on.”\n\n“What do I think of today’s films?” he mused. “I had the feeling things were going to swing away from brutality and sex, but I was wrong. I used to go to the films that made me laugh, but there’s not much entertainment-value these days.”\n\nHarrison was at his suave best when asked which Eliza Doolittle was his favorite. “I’ve been asked that question many times,” he drawled. When he got the Oscar for his film version of Henry Higgins in “My Fair Lady,” he was given the award by Audrey Hepburn (who played Eliza in the film) while Julie Andrews (the stage Eliza) “was being given the award for something else.”\n\nIt was a sticky wicket, Harrison implied. He said that there is a greater intimacy in working with other actors in a stage play than in a film, but he was chivalrously reticent about the relative performances of Audrey and Julie.\n\nHenry Higgins was his “most rewarding” role. “The audience came with high hopes and an enormous feeling of elation. Even before the curtain went up you could hear them buzzing out there.”"
