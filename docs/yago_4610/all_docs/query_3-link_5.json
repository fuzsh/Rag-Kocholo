        "text": "One story about Harrison comes from his longtime friend Alan Jay Lerner's accounts of the MY FAIR LADY rehearsals. For those who know the play, this occurred during the scene in Act II when Higgins is at his mother's house arguing with Eliza. The actress who played his mother, Cathleen Nesbitt (who would play the role for 25 years in fact, reprising it during Harrison's last go at the role in the early 1980s when he was in his 70s and she was in her 90s) was deaf in one ear.\n\nPer Lerner, Rex was complaining of indigestion all day, and during the scene that night he delivered his line to Nesbitt, then, again per Lerner, \"Rex let out the loudest fart ever to occur on the Broadway stage, so loud it could be heard in the balcony\".\n\nLerner said the audience was shocked but kept it together until Nesbitt, who had not heard it, spoke her next line: \"Henry dear, stop grinding your teeth\", at which point the play had to stop for about five minutes. (Rex was not amused and Ms Nesbitt had to be informed later what happened.)\n\n\"I thought his last girlfriend/wife died of Leukemia. Kay something? \"%0D %0D Kay Kendall, who was one of the most enchanting comic actresses of all time. But she wasn't his last wife, she was the third out of six. After she died, he married three more times.%0D %0D In Lili Palmer's book (she was wife #2?), I recall that he was having an affair with Kendall while married to Palmer, and that was when Kendall was diagnosed with the leukemia that killed her. Nobody ever told Kendall herself what was wrong with her, there was no treatment in those days and keeping the patient in the dark was thought to be the kindest thing to do. Anyway, various people told Harrison that he had to marry Kendall and stay with her until the end, and I don't remember if Palmer (wife #2?) was one of them.\n\n[quote]Anyway, various people told Harrison that he had to marry Kendall and stay with her until the end, and I don't remember if Palmer (wife #2?) was one of them.\n\nKendall was wife #3. After she died, he told wife #2, Lilli Palmer, that he had only left her because he felt sorry for Kendall. At that point, he wanted to re-marry Palmer, who declined the offer.\n\nR2, the rumor is that he was trying to force girlfriend Carole Landis into getting an abortion, and she killed herself instead when he wouldn't leave Lilli Palmer for her after she got pregnant.\n\nI also have heard a persistent rumor that Landis was still alive when Harrison found her after she OD'd on Seconal, but he declined to call a doctor for some reason. Indeed, if you look at photos from the scene, Landis' body appears to still be in a position of trying to pull herself off the floor. It's kind of creepy and makes you wonder if she was trying to save herself.\n\nHarrison was bad news.\n\nHe is still fascinating in films like BLITHE SPIRIT, THE HONEYPOT and his Caesar in CLEOPATRA.%0D %0D Lilli Palmer (wife 2) seems to have tolerated his many affairs - perhaps she was having affairs of her own?; he did the decent thing by Kendall by marrying her in 1957 knowing she would die in a few years (which she did in 1959), by then Palmer had married Argentine actor Carlos Thompson, Rex went to marry English actress Rachel Roberts - they both drank a lot and created scenes at various hollywood parties - she never got used to not being Mrs Harrison any more and killed herself by swallowing poison in 1980 (Rex had married 2 more times by then). %0D %0D It seems Carole Landis had tried to commit suicide several times but was always discovered in time, but in 1948 she had forgot the next day was a public holiday so her maid did not arrive in time to save her, it seems Rex found the body and left the scene. %0D %0D Lilli had a good story in her book about trying to decide what to wear to the funeral of her husband's mistress - black was thought too much so she settled for wearing navy ! %0D %0D Her book \"Change Lobsters And Dance\" (its still available) is a great read on them all - she detested Kendall whom everyone else (including me) loved as one of England's greatest glamorous comediennes. Lilli was also great friends with Noel Coward. %0D %0D One interesting story: Rex had a fling with Austrian star Romy Schneider in hollywood in '63 (he was filming My Fair Lady, and she was making Good Neighbour Sam) - he called to her room one afternoon to find her in slumped in a coma from an accidental overdose of cocaine and he fled the scene again, fearing another scandal like the Landis one, so that was the end of him and Romy. She died 20 years later of a rumoured heart attack so drugs may have been a factor in that - she was much younger than Sexy Rexy but she had made 2 films with Lilli in Germany in the 50s so may have initially met him then and perhaps it amused her to get her chance with him in the 60s. %0D %0D Lilli's husband Carlos killed himself 4 years after Lilli dying and when Harrison died part of his ashes were scattered on Lilli's grave in L.A. %0D %0D Today's stars are not quite as interesting !\n\n\"George Bernard Shaw got it right when he wrote 'Pygmalion' - he had Eliza leave Prof. Higgins at the end, because he's impossible. When the story was made into a musical the writers had her come back, apparently out of sheer conventiality. They couldn't bear to see a man and a woman go through much together and then go their seperate ways, even if they are totally incompatible.\"\n\nR37 is correct. Sorta. MY FAIR LADY is based more on the 1938 film (starring Leslie Howard and Wendy Hiller) than the play, which introduced several elements that made it into the musical (i.e. \"The rain in Spain stays mainly in the plain,\" \"Where the devil are my slippers\"). Furthermore, the screenplay was written by.... George Bernard Shaw himself (and won an Oscar for it, to boot!) so you should say instead, \"He got it right the first time.\"\n\nRex Harrison was cancer to women. Poor Carole Landis!\n\nIn early 1947 with Horace in New York, Carole met Rex Harrison on the set of “Out of the Blue”. Within days, they were spending every spare moment together. Carole was in love again but Rex was just looking for another conquest. He was still very much married to actress Lilli Palmer who spent their marriage looking the other way.\n\nOne Sunday afternoon, Carole had planned a pool party with an intimate dinner with Rex. He told his friends later that, after dinner, he told Carole the affair was over. It must have been too much for her damaged heart to endure. When Rex left, she took all of her personal files and mementos, sorted them into two bags with a note on one for Rex. One bag was found in the house, the other in the driveway of the house where Rex was staying with friends. The following morning, while Carole’s maid was making breakfast in the kitchen, Harrison burst into the house. He asked the maid to go up and check on Carole. “I think she is dead”.\n\nIn the summer of 1948, Carole had planned a pool party for that Sunday afternoon with an intimate dinner with Rex. He told his friends later that, after dinner, he told Carole the affair was over. It must have been too much for her damaged heart to endure. When Rex left, she took all of her personal files and mementos, sorted them into two bags with a note on one for Rex. One bag was found in the house, the other in the driveway of the house where Rex was staying with friends. The following morning, while Carole’s maid was making breakfast in the kitchen, Harrison burst into the house. He asked the maid to go up and check on Carole. “I think she is dead”.\n\nThey found Carole sprawled on the bathroom floor. An empty pill bottle lay nearby. Harrison, who claimed he felt a slight pulse, fled the house, ostensibly to call the doctor or police. He did neither until a full hour later when he returned. But they had already been called. The coroner determined Carole had been dead 12 hours. Since notes were found (one to Rex and one to her mother) a brief inquest declared the death a suicide. The note to Rex was never disclosed and was among the articles later burned by Harrison and his wife. Harrison bribed a police officer to destroy it. But Hollywood, the press and Carole’s fans would hold Rex Harrison responsible.\n\nIn the suicide note she left for her mother was written: “Dearest Mommie, I’m sorry, really sorry, to put you through this but there is no way to avoid it. I love you darling, you have been the most wonderful mom ever. And that applies to all our family. I love each and every one of them dearly. Everything goes to you—look in the files and there is a will which decrees everything. Good bye, my angel. Pray for me, Your Baby.”\n\n[quote] Well, [R33], Julie Andrews, despite being a child performer, was really in over her head at the beginning of MFL rehearsals. She might have been fired but Moss Hart spent a lot of time with her and worked really hard to get her to improve, which she obviously did.\n\nWell, remember she had been a star on the West End stage already in THE BOYFRIEND, so it wasn't as if she didn't know how to give a hit performance. Her biggest problem was Liza's Cockney accent--her voice teacher when she was a child singer had stressed enunciation over everything else, which is why all Julie Andrews imitators always overdo it. But that emphasis on proper enunciation made it very hard for Julie to mimic a Cockney accent, and so ultimately Moss Hart took her aside for a weekend and told her if she didn;t learn it properly by the end of the weekend they'd have to find another Liza.\n\nHarrison was no help to her, and increased the stress on her before she learned how to do the accent correctly by loudly calling her a cunt in rehearsals every time she flubbed the accent (which of course only made her more nervous and flub more often). I once remember not too long ago a Datalounger actually DEFENDING him for calling her a cunt! Only on Datalounge.\n\nThe endings to the original PYGMALION play, the 1938 Leslie Howard/Wendy Hiller movie, and the musical all sucked! The former, because it left everything ambiguous. The play ends with Eliza stating she's marrying Freddy and storms out, and Higgins laughing it off. The 1938 film has Eliza returning to Higgins, implying a happy ending and romance, which the musical copied. Terrible, terrible, all around!\n\nI much prefer the ending Shaw rewrote for the 1920 revival, in which the final scene plays out as before, with Higgins pleading Eliza to return to Wimpole Street, and Eliza brushing him off, intent on marrying Freddy and forging her own life. But instead of merely laughing it off, Higgins ponders a moment, then goes out to the balcony to watch Eliza's departure. After a moment, he exclaims \"Galatea!\" (meaning the statue has come to life at last), and then the curtain falls.\n\nThat is the point of the play. Eliza was a lump of clay that Higgins molded into a refined lady, but she didn't 'come alive' until that very moment, when she becomes independent of Higgins. But he's not mocking her when he smiles and makes the exclamation (as in the original play), nor is he despondent that she won't come back , until she does (as in the film/musical). He has done his duty, and Eliza has no use for him anymore. There's no need for the two of them to be romantically linked. The play works better with an EDUCATING RITA ending. in that play/movie, the professor and student also don't get romantically involved and part ways."
