She studied ballet and began her professional life with a music-hall tour in an act with her sister Kim. She made an uncredited film debut in ‘Fiddlers Three' in 1944. She then won a featured part in 1946's ‘London Town' which unfortunately proved to be one of the biggest flops in British film history and she returned to theatre and bit parts. After earning a contract with the J. Arthur Rank film company, she starred in the popular hit ‘Genevieve' in 1953 which was followed the next year by another smash, ‘Doctor in the House.' In 1955 she co-starred with Rex Harrison in the comedy ‘The Constant Husband' during which they entered into an affair; they married in 1957. She made her American screen debut in ‘Les Girls' that same year for which she won a Golden Globe Award. She then costarred in 1958's ‘The Reluctant Debutante' with her husband. She had by this time been diagnosed with leukemia, but was allegedly never told of her illness. Her last role was in ‘Once More, With Feeling' which was released posthumously. She succumbed to illness at age 32. She is often remembered for her beauty and charm which were matched by her faultless comedic timing.\n\nSources\n\nKay Kendall Wikipedia article\n\n\"England and Wales Birth Registration Index, 1837-2008,\" , FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:QV3V-3FQV : 2 October 2014), Justine K K Mccarthy, 1927; from \"England & Wales Births, 1837-2006,\" database, findmypast (http://www.findmypast.com : 2012); citing Birth Registration, Patrington, Yorkshire, England, citing General Register Office, Southport, England.\n\n\"New York, New York Passenger and Crew Lists, 1909, 1925-1957,\" database with images, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:24PP-HS6 : 2 March 2021), Justine Kay Mccarthy, 1947; citing Immigration, New York City, New York, United States, NARA microfilm publication T715 (Washington, D.C.: National Archives and Records Administration, n.d.).\n\nFind a Grave, database and images (https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/5635/kay-kendall: accessed 20 October 2023), memorial page for Kay Kendall (21 May 1927–6 Sep 1959), Find a Grave Memorial ID 5635, citing St John-at-Hampstead Churchyard, Hampstead, London Borough of Camden, Greater London, England; Maintained by Find a Grave.\n\nJustine Kay Kendall McCarthy at FamilySearch"
