        "text": "Rex Harrison, the suave British actor who won a Tony in 1957 and an Academy Award in 1964 for his portrayals of Prof. Henry Higgins in ''My Fair Lady,'' died of pancreatic cancer yesterday at his home in Manhattan. He was 82 years old. The actor, who was knighted in July 1989, played a wide variety of roles during his long career in theater and films, but he was best known for his portrayal of the waspish professor of phonetics in the musical based on George Bernard Shaw's play ''Pygmalion.''\n\nSir Rex made his last stage appearance on May 11 in a revival of ''The Circle,'' a comedy by Somerset Maugham. The production, in which he co-starred with Glynis Johns and Stewart Granger, opened Nov. 20, 1989 at the Ambassador Theater.\n\n''He wanted to be on the stage - that was it,'' said Sir Rex's attorney, Harold Schiff. ''He didn't care about retiring.''\n\n''He died with his boots on, no question about it,'' said Elliot Martin, producer of ''The Circle.''\n\nA popular actor who loved his craft, Mr. Harrison was known for his wit and charm. He was tall and elegant and was often cast as a man of wealth and refinement. In ''The Circle'' he played a British lord whose scandalous past comes back to haunt him.\n\nSerious but unpretentious about his work, the actor once said: ''There's always a struggle, a striving for something bigger than yourself in all forms of art. And even if you don't achieve greatness - even if you fail, which we all must - everything you do in your work is somehow connected with your attitude toward life, your deepest secret feelings.''\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
