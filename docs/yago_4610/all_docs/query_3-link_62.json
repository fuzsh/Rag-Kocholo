        "text": "REX HARRISON'S reputation as a fellow on whom the females dote—let's see, now, Sexy Rexy is the sobriquet they've given him, we believe—is traded upon with broad good humor and more than a trace of spoof in the British comedy \"The Constant Husband,\" which came to the Plaza yesterday. It could even have been the inspiration for this flighty and photogenic farce.For here we have Mr. Harrison as a seemingly normal British gent who, under the influence of a strong case of amnesia, discovers to his amazement that he has been quite a successful Romeo. \"Successful\" is putting it mildly. He discovers that he has been a bird who, in one occupation or another, has accumulated no less than seven wives. And all of them are beauties who are perfectly willing to take him back. This is a frightening discovery for a fellow to make about himself.First, he discovers that his most recent and presumably most expectant wife is a chic photographer, played by Kay Kendall (who has actually become Mrs. Harrison since this film was made). No sooner has he made her happy with his bewildered return to their home than he is grabbed by a couple of Soho characters and hustled off to be rejoined with a previous wife.This one turns out to be a lady whose professional occupation is that of being shot out of a cannon controlled by a mammoth gentleman. The situation is precarious, but the lady—Nicole Maurey—is delighted to welcome back her long-lost husband. Too delighted for his taste! He clambers out of her clutches and bedchamber as rapidly as he can.And so it goes with this poor fellow—one wife after another is revealed—until he lands in the dock at Old Bailey being tried for bigamy. The only hitch is—well, you'll probably guess it: his barrister is a crafty dame who is determined to be the next on the scorecard. It is a role that Margaret Leighton plays.Let's not pursue the obvious further. Sidney Gilliat and Val Valentine have fitted this trifle with cute plot twists and some occasionally quite witty words. And everyone plays it brightly, though Mr. Harrison is haggard as the gent, which is, of course, the likely and thus amusing condition for him to he in. Cecil Parker is a baffled psychiatrist and Michael Hordern is a thoroughly foggy judge.This film was previously shown on television in this area, which was an odd and inconsiderate reverse of the usual routine, for it certainly exposed it disadvantageously. It ran for less than an hour on that occasion, and was in the customary black-and-white. Now it runs for eighty-eight minutes and is in color that thoroughly flatters the dames.What's more, some of the little touches that were out on television are now in. They have to do with the reason the ladies are so interested in this man.\n\nThe CastTHE CONSTANT HUSBAND, original screen play by Sidney Gilliat and Val Valentine; directed by Mr. Gilliat; produced by Mr. Gilliat and Frank Launder for London Films; released by Stratford Pictures.
