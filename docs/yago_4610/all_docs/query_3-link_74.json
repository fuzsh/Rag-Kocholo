Given co-starring or featured roles in British films of the 1930s, Harrison always appeared to be overshadowed or out-acted by his colleagues, particularly Vivien Leigh in Storm in a Teacup and St. Martin's Lane, two films that should have helped the actor's career. As the King in Anna and the King of Siam, and as the jealous symphony conductor in Unfaithfully Yours, Harrison at last gained a substantial audience, but gossip concerning the suicide of Carole Landis, with whom he had had an affair, effectively ended his first Hollywood career.\n\nThis tragedy, rather than hurting Harrison, helped in the long run, for it allowed him to refine his acting on stage, and to recreate the image of the suave, urbane Englishman suggested by some of the actor's early films, such as Blithe Spirit and The Rake's Progress, but never fully developed. Harrison's portrayal of Professor Henry Higgins in My Fair Lady, of course, epitomized the new characterization, and it was further developed in The Yellow Rolls-Royce. Nevertheless, one should not categorize Harrison. Cleopatra gave him, out of everyone in the cast, an opportunity to dominate the scene as Caesar, and to rise above the banal script and production (and his first Oscar nomination). Yet again, in The Agony and the Ecstasy, as Pope Julius II, he was able to overcome the poor production, while Staircase presented him with a rare opportunity for \"camp\" comedy.\n\nFollowing Staircase until his death in 1990, Harrison appearing only infrequently in films and only in supporting roles, including two swashbuckling failures, Behind the Iron Mask and Crossed Swords. He found more success on the stage in this period, however, including another go at Caesar in George Bernard Shaw's Caesar and Cleopatra, touring revivals of My Fair Lady, and up to a month before his death a lead role on Broadway in W. Somerset Maugham's The Circle. Over a 65-year career, Harrison had established himself as a top-notch performer of sophisticated roles on stage and on screen, and had secured a permanent place in the film pantheon as Professor Henry Higgins.\n\n—Anthony Slide, updated by David E.
