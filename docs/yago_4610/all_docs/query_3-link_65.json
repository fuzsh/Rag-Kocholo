        "text": "Rex Harrison, the suave British actor who won a Tony in 1957 and an Academy Award in 1964 for his portrayals of Professor Henry Higgins in My Fair Lady, died of pancreatic cancer Saturday at his home in New York. He was 82. The actor played a wide variety of roles during his long career in theater and films, but he was best known for his portrayal of the waspish professor of phonetics in the musical based on George Bernard Shaw's play Pygmalion.\n\nHarrison made his last stage appearance May 11 in a revival of The Circle, a comedy by Somerset Maugham. The production, in which he co-starred with Glynis Johns and StewartGranger, opened last November at the Ambassador Theater in New York.\n\n\"He wanted to be on the stage _ that was it,\" said Harrison's attorney, Harold Schiff. \"He didn't care about retiring.\"\n\n\"He died with his boots on, no question about it,\" said Elliot Martin, producer of The Circle.\n\nA popular actor who loved his craft, Harrison was known for his wit and charm. He was tall and elegant and was often cast as a man of wealth and refinement. In The Circle he played a British lord whose scandalous past comes back to haunt him.\n\nSerious but unpretentious about his work, the actor once said: \"There's always a strug\n\ngle, a striving for something bigger than yourself in all forms of art. And even if you don't achieve greatness _ even if you fail, which we all must _ everything you do in your work is somehow connected with your attitude toward life, your deepest secret feelings.\"\n\nHarrison gained international fame with his award-winning stage and film portrayals of the sharp-tongued professor Higgins in the Alan Jay Lerner-Frederick Loewe musical. His co-stars as the cockney flower girl Eliza were Julie Andrews on Broadway and Audrey Hepburn in the movie.\n\nHe was nominated for an Academy Award in 1963 for his other favorite film role, Julius Caesar in Cleopatra, in which Elizabeth Taylor played the title role.\n\nHe appeared in more than 40 films and many stage productions over the decades, in the United States and Britain, including his portrayal of Henry VIII in Anne of the Thousand Days (1948), for which he won his first Tony, and The Love of Four Colonels (1953), which he also directed.\n\nHarrison's film role in 1967 as Dr. Dolittle, the fanciful jungle gentleman who conversed with wildlife, introduced him to a new generation of young moviegoers.\n\nDespite all his theatrical experience, Harrison, a musical duffer, had to work hard on his performance in the first stage production of My Fair Lady.\n\n\"Originally, I had a block about appearing in a musical,\" he recalled years later. \"I went to a voice teacher for a while, but that did no good. My range is about one and a half notes. I ended up talking the musical numbers, which was revolutionary at the time.\"\n\nAfter successful warm-up performances out of town, there were still moments of panic during the Broadway opening, on March 15, 1956, at the Mark Hellinger Theater. Lerner recalled later in his autobiography, On the Street Where I Live, that the New York audience was disappointingly hushed during the first scene, which had generated much laughter out of town. Aghast, the director, Moss Hart, rushed up to co-workers in the rear of the theater, crying: \"I knew it! It's just a New Haven hit! That's all! Just a New Haven hit!\"\n\nHart erred. A review in the next morning's New York Times read: \"Bulletins from the road have not been misleading. My Fair Lady is a wonderful show. As Professor Higgins and Eliza, Rex Harrison and Julie Andrews play the leading parts with the light, dry touch of top-flight Shavian acting.\"\n\n\"Although Mr. Harrison is no singer,\" the review went on, \"you will probably imagine that he is singing when he throws himself into the anguished lyrics of A Hymn to Him in the last act.\"\n\nHarrison recalled in his autobiography, Rex, which was published in 1974: \"My contract for My Fair Lady was for nine months only _ but how could you leave a show like that? It was all far too exciting, and I stayed with it for two years.\"\n\nHarrison later returned to the role of Professor Higgins, to repeated standing ovations, in a 1981 Broadway revival of My Fair Lady, in which he was given total artistic control.\n\nRex Carey Harrison was born on March 5, 1908, in Huyton, England, a granite-quarrying town six miles east of Liverpool.\n\nStagestruck from boyhood, he went to work backstage for the Liverpool Repertory at the age of 16. His first part was one line; he moved on to other acting parts, then toured for nine years in road companies of successful plays before he made his mark, initially on the London stage, where he appeared for the first time in 1930 and for the last time in 1988, in The Admirable Crichton.\n\nHarrison never attended drama school, but had no regrets on that score. \"The important thing is to learn through experience,\" he said in an interview last year.\n\nHarrison was married in 1934 to Marjorie Noel Collette Thomas, with whom he had a son, Noel; to actress Lilli Palmer in 1943, with whom he also had a son, Carey; to actress Kay Kendall in 1957; to the actress Rachel Roberts in 1962; and to Elizabeth Rees Harris in the early 1970s. All the marriages ended in divorce except the one to Miss Kendall, who died in 1959.\n\nHarrison is survived by his sixth wife, Mercia Tinker, whom he married in 1978, and by his sons.\n\nThe funeral will be private, but there will be a public memorial service on June 18 at the Little Church Around the Corner in Manhattan, Schiff said.\n\n_ Information from the Associated Press was used in this report."
