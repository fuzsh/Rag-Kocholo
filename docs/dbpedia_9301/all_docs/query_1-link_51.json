        "text": "LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA: Kenneth Brian Edmonds, well known by his stage name as \"Babyface\", recently said he was \"honored\" when asked to sing 'America The Beautiful' as part of the Super Bowl LVII pre-show in February.\n\nThe Grammy-winning artist, producer, and performer, age 63, admitted to TMZ that he had never imagined being able to get involved in the major game day preparations on February 12. \"I can safely say that I never saw this one coming, he stated. \"I was honored that I got the call.\" In a message on social media, the platinum-selling musician stated that he was \"truly excited and honored to perform America the Beautiful at Super Bowl LVII and to be a part of this pregame lineup.\"\n\nREAD MORE\n\nWhy are Babyface and Nicole Pantenburg divorcing? Fans want him to date Toni Braxton\n\n'INSANE': Chris Stapleton to sing national anthem at Super Bowl LVII, fans say 'that man can sing!'\n\nThe hitmaker, who has been creating music for more than 40 years, said he was anxious about playing in front of a large audience. '\"I'll be completely rattled. As much as I'm going to try to be comfortable with it, I know I'm gonna be nervous, because you think about how many people you're actually performing for and what that moment means,\" as cited by Daily Mail.\n\nAbout Kenneth Edmonds\n\nKenneth \"Babyface\" Edmonds, a singer-songwriter-producer/multi-instrumentalist who has won 11 Grammy awards, has produced and written or co-written numerous major hits since the 1990s, including Madonna's 'Take a Bow,' Tevin Campbell's 'Can We Talk? 'and I'm Ready, and Boyz II Men's 'I'll Make Love to You,' 'Water Runs Dry,' and 'End of the Road,' which was one of the longest-running No. 1 hits in pop history, as per Song Hall. Additionally, everyone from Whitney Houston to Michael Jackson, Mariah Carey, Johnny Gill, Pink, Ariana Grande, and Beyonc√© have covered his songs.\n\nHow did he get the nickname Babyface?\n\nEdmonds was born on April 10, 1959, in Indianapolis, Indiana, the fifth of six brothers, including Melvin and Kevon Edmonds, both future members of the R&B band After 7. Kevon also enjoyed a solo career. In high school, Edmonds began creating songs and learning to play the guitar and keyboards.\n\nAs reported by IndyStar, the moniker \"Babyface\" refers to Edmonds' appearance, which is young for his age. Edmonds has claimed in numerous interviews that he received the nickname while performing in the band of 1980s funk singer William Earl \"Bootsy\" Collins. He first opposed the moniker, but after his bandmate, Darnell \"Dee\" Bristol addressed him by it on stage after he sang 'Sweet November' in 1985, he decided to embrace it. \"Suddenly, at the end of the show, I had girls coming up asking where Babyface was,\" Edmonds said to Cincinnati Enquirer in 2014. \"They never asked where Kenny Edmonds was.\"\n\nWhat is Kenneth Edmonds' net worth?"
