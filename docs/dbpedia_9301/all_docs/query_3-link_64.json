You think you own a piece of me because you knew my name. If it's the last thing I do, you’ll bow to babyface. Why’d you gotta make it all about my body? I played the part you said to be, you still forgot me. Do you wanna cut me up? And dissect me? Split me at my seams to try to understand me. Do I fascinate you? So calm yet so disruptive. I intimidate you? Jealousies so unattractive. Sorry, i will not remain, trapped inside your little cage, running on a wheel until you kill me when your feelings changed. I will never heal from all the shit you left, I watched someone I love turn into someone else. I will never heal from all the shit you left, but at least I hate you more now than I hate myself. You think you know who I am because you’ve seen my face. You think you know what I've done and who I've done it with.You think you own a piece of me because you knew my name. If it's the last thing I do, you’ll bow to babyface. And if you think she’s still alive, that girl is dead to me, do I gotta be in the ground before you let me be? I know we share the same blood but go by different names, if it’s the last thing I do, you’ll bow to babyface. If it’s the last thing I do, you’ll bow to babyface. If it’s the last thing I do, you’ll bow to babyface. I will never heal from all the shit you left (If it’s the last thing I do, you’ll bow to babyface) but at least I hate you more now than I hate myself (if it’s the last thing I do) You think you know who I am because you’ve seen my face. You think you know what I've done and who I've done it with.You think you own a piece of me because you knew my name. If it's the last thing I do, you’ll bow to babyface. And if you think she’s still alive, that girl is dead to me, do I gotta be in the ground before you let me be? I know we share the same blood but go by different names, if it’s the last thing I do, you’ll bow to babyface.\n\n3.\n\nWhat in the post-apocalyptic fucked up shit is this? I’ll tell you how you save the kids, you’ve got to let them live. I don’t wanna be here anymore, this place is fucking sickening. I don’t wanna be here anymore, we’re scapegoats for all your killing. Bones sit on the throne and they are cutting all our throats, these demons from the past have vowed to kill us all. I wasn’t born to take your shit (not listening) 6000 years and this is it? (not listening) I’m suffocating You don’t wanna know (over and over) You don’t wanna know (over and over) Everything is burning but you wanna cut me down, I’m suffocating. But you don’t wanna know. FLASCH Watch me rise from the ashes and give you all my disease, wipe the blood off my fingers, turn up 100 degrees. Crawling out of the shadows, my hands rise out of the grave. If our existence is fragile, why are you all so afraid? Our overdue resurrection, the one that crashes the sea. Everything that you fear is hiding underneath. If you’re afraid of the monsters well then you just wait and grieve. Maybe this is the moment you thought you’d never live to see. They’re always watching (watching), but they learn nothing (nothing). They’re always watching (watching), but they learn nothing (nothing). Oh will we ever learn to just leave well enough alone? You dug too deep and dug our graves, you’ve sentenced all the kids you saved. They’re always watching, but they learn nothing. History repeats itself. You don’t wanna know (over and over) You don’t wanna know (over and over) Everything is burning but you wanna cut me down, I’m suffocating. But you don’t wanna, but you don’t wanna know. You don’t wanna You don’t wanna know You don’t wanna.\n\n4.\n\nSertraline (feat. STRAIGHT GIRL) 03:23\n\nAll of my friends are crazy, they’re passed out on the floor. We’re bored and sad and lonely, so what’s a little more. None of my friends are happy. We’re not kids anymore, I don’t know what to say, I don’t wanna be here anymore. Looks like we’re on our own, with nowhere left to go. They pump us full of meds as soon as we hit all time low. Are you watching? Are you watching me? Eyes are on me, all eyes on me. We’re born and die alone, the rest is all for show. I lost my head last weekend, it’s not in the lost and found. I sold my soul on Monday, just for a mess about. All of my friends are crazy, they’re passed out on the floor. We’re bored and sad and lonely, so what’s a little more. None of my friends are happy. We’re not kids anymore, I don’t know what to say, I don’t wanna be here anymore. I don’t wanna be here anymore. I don’t wanna be here anymore. STRAIGHTGIRL I said no photography Lest you meet my insanity I’m the banshee queen of psychosis everybody wants a piece of these ADH double D’s and they say eat the bourgeoisie don’t even try to come for me cos I’m kinda, like, crazy They profit off our suffering, load us up on sertraline, but doctor STRAIGHT GIRL recommends we give them all guillotine they want to make us sick, make us beg, make us stay, fuck that, put up your fists, show em your teeth, and make them pay parasites take until there’s nothing left so until that day comes I say ‘“off with their heads” make them know our names, make them feel our pain, I will make them meet my rage All of my friends are crazy, they’re passed out on the floor. We’re bored and sad and lonely, so what’s a little more. None of my friends are happy. We’re not kids anymore, I don’t know what to say, I don’t wanna be here anymore.\n\n5.\n\nTemple 03:24\n\nWelcome to your reckoning, the consequences echoing. My body is a temple and I’ll burn yours to the ground. I’ve waited for this moment to arrive, the day the scene started to die. You hide behind your mates, posts coming up at alarming rates. Waited for the day it starts to burn, so many lessons you could learn. Instead, white knights come in, to cover their backs and dump you in it. No cloaks and daggers in this mess. What part of this must I dissect? The predator in the pen? Or the buzzards in the back protecting him. Hey, welcome to your reckoning, the consequences echoing. My body is a temple and I’ll burn yours to the ground. Statement, statement. Accusation, accusation. Oh, you love the sensation! You’ll watch me burn yours to the ground. Oh how’d you like it now? I’ll do just what I wanna. Didn’t stop when she said no? You parasite, piranha. Anything of worth inside? I bet your blood’s such a pretty colour. I’ll paint this whole town red, to ward off all your brothers. I’ll watch the life drain from your eyes, the day the scene started to die. Hey, welcome to your reckoning, the consequences echoing. My body is a temple and I’ll burn yours to the ground. Statement, statement. Accusation, accusation. Oh, you love the sensation! You’ll watch me burn yours to the ground.\n\n6.\n\nI'm So Sorry 02:04\n\nI would like a second of your time, for once in my whole life I don’t wanna lie. Everything around me falls apart, no object permanence makes love so hard. I can’t tell if I’m gonna hurt you, or if I’d even mean to. I’ve got no choice but to push you away, it’s the only way that I can keep you safe. I’m self-destructive, too disruptive, no one kept me safe, got so much anger, this disaster is why I have to say I’m so sorry I’m so sorry I’m so sorry I’m so sorry\n\n7.\n\nWallflower 03:58\n\nYou seem to really hate me. There’s no rose without a thorn. My existence makes you angry, that’s not my problem anymore. You think you’re poison ivy? You’re just as parasitic. You drain the life from people and still get shocked when they won’t sit and take it. I’ll have you pushing up the daisies, dead and buried you hear me? You are no wallflower. Is it fun inside your ivory tower? Wallflower, you’re rotting from the inside out. I’ll cut you down, I’ll rip you out. I’ll cut you down, I’ll rip you out. Darling you’re too faced and far too disloyal, you’re too self-obsessed to see you are the problem. Everyone left but you still take no blame, look and the loneliest mess you have made. I’m so sick and tired of you wiping your feet, on all of my friends and just all over me. You think I’m the issue but you are mistaken. If I’m the bad friend here then you must be satan. You are no wallflower. Is it fun inside your ivory tower? Wallflower, you’re rotting from the inside out. I’ll cut you down, I’ll rip you out. I’ll cut you down, I’ll rip you out. You seem to really hate me. There’s no rose without a thorn. My existence makes you angry, that’s not my problem anymore. You think you’re poison ivy? You’re just as parasitic. You drain the life from people and still get shocked when they won’t sit and take it. So you wanna test my patience? Fuck around and find out. So you wanna pick a fight now? Well I’ll pull you straight out of the ground.\n\n8.\n\nYou're Not My Home 02:28\n\nI don’t know, if I wanna know, how you feel, when you think about me. I’ll try to keep you around, and I say that you’ll wait even thought that I’m wrong. Just say the word honey, I’ll go away. Give you the word if you’d take it from me cuz all I ever wanted was a home. Hold you in my arms and I feel so alive, dancing all night drinking whisky and I haven’t felt this awake in a long long time. But after all this I’m just not your type? She’s pure riot orange, I’m singing the blues. I’ll look away but I’m looking at you. I’d give all my Sundays for you even though, you’ll never say that you love me too. Just say the word honey, I’ll go away. Give you the word if you’d take it from me cuz all I ever wanted was a home. Tell me your feelings, I’ll throw mine away. If you’re not around it’s a waste of a day. All I ever wanted was a home. But you’re not my home. You’re not my home. I wish that you were but I don’t light a fire in your soul.\n\n9.\n\nYou're An Arsonist 04:07\n\nI won’t ask for much, I just want your everything all at once. You be my puppet and I’ll pull the strings. Making you nervous is pure poetry, you’ll never want me to stop. I don’t need anything. All I want is you to give in to me, surrender your spirit I’m eager to please. Bend your wil,l I’ll break your soul. You’d be better off alone, you broke my heart, I’ll break your spine. It’s not love but you’re still mine. Light me up, light me up, light me up, baby. Who needs a heart when you’re so damn lonely? Light me up, light me up, light me up, baby. Who needs a heart when you’re so damn lonely? I really tried for you, I’m out of time for you. Won’t give my life for you. You won’t ask for much. But it’s all I have and then some so just savor the taste, I’ll be all that you need, I hope that all things will remind you of me. Get on your knees and pray to me, and I will answer willingly. Bend your will, I’ll break your soul. You’d be better off alone, you broke my heart, I’ll break your spine. It’s not love but you’re still mine. Bend your will I’ll break your soul. You’d be better off alone, you broke my heart, I’ll break your spine. It’s not love but you’re still mine. You’re still mine. I really tried for you, I’m out of time for you. Won’t give my life for you. No. Light me up, light me up, light me up, baby. Who needs a heart when you’re so damn lonely? Light me up, light me up, light me up, baby. Who needs a heart when you’re so damn lonely? I really tried for you, I’m out of time for you. Won’t give my life for you.\n\n10.\n\nEven thought you’re gone, I still hear you all the time. You’re running through my head when I close my eyes and I, Thought that antivenoms would be potent. But I guess that somethings can’t be forgotten. (Made me believe) Was everything you said a lie? I wish I could believe you but now I can’t change my mind, Again. And I’m done, My friend. The person that you knew thought they were better off dead. I’ve changed my name and changed my mind but you still haunt my head time to time. I’ve changed my name and changed my mind but you still haunt my head time to time. I’ve changed my name and changed my mind but you still haunt my head time to time I’ve changed my name and changed my mind but you still haunt my head. Made me believe that I caused all your problems, made me believe. But you’re a liar, liar you set my house on fire, fire. Oh, the nerve of you to take my fear and make it so exciting, the butterflies were in my gut and now they’re slowly dying. Oh, the nerve of you to take my fear and make it so exciting, the butterflies were in my gut and now they’re slowly dying.\n\n11.\n\nWisdom Teeth 02:23"
