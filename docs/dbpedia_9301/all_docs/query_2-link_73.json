        "text": "On November 11, WBLS Presents Circle of Sisters brought together musical luminaries at the Theater at MSG, headlined by none other than the maestro of melodies, Kenny \"Babyface\" Edmonds. With an incredible lineup, the audience was treated to a once-in-a-lifetime R&B experience.\n\nThe evening kicked off with DJ Funkmaster Flex on the turntables. He introduced Jon B, who not only transported the crowd back to the golden era of 1990s R&B, but also celebrated his 49th birthday. The night took an unexpected turn when a musician from Jon B's band took center stage for a proposal to his background singer. Love was definitely in the air.\n\nFollowing this romantic interlude, the stage was graced by Al B. Sure! who, remarkably, had recovered from a coma just one year prior. At 55 years old and still on the mend, Al proved he could still command the stage and, while getting emotional, thanked the audience for their support and prayers. Al brought the house down with renditions of his classics, including the 1990 slow jam \"Secret Garden,\" which he sang while walking through the audience.\n\nNext up was the up-and-coming October London, whose soul-stirring voice channeled the spirit of Marvin Gaye. His three-song performance showcased his crisp voice and served as a refreshing departure from the overproduced R&B of today. If October London is a name you do not know, look up his music immediately.\n\nHowever, it was Babyface who took the spotlight and elevated the night to legendary status. At 65 years old, the musical genius and 11-time Grammy winner exhibited vocal prowess, instrumental mastery, comedic storytelling, and even some choreography that belied his age. Every song felt like an encore, from \"Change the World\" to \"Whip Appeal\" to \"Never Keeping Secrets,\" 'Face had the crowd in a frenzy. One of the many highlights of the evening was a reunion with Jon B to perform 1995's \"Someone to Love,\" marking the first live rendition of the song in 25 years, according to Babyfaceâ€”a moment that brought the audience to their feet.\n\nBabyface's journey through the classics he penned for Bobby Brown, TLC, Toni Braxton, Tevin Campbell, Boyz II Men, and more was a masterclass in musical artistry. His pitch-perfect performance and the seamless interplay of vocals and instruments left the audience in awe, reaffirming his status as a true musical genius. There was also a moving tribute to the late great Whitney Houston, whom 'Face worked with several times.\n\nI have seen countless artists over the years, but Babyface was arguably the best live performer I have ever witnessed.\n\nIn the end, WBLS Presents Circle of Sisters with Babyface wasn't just a concert; it was a celebration of stone-cold R&B, and a testament to the enduring power of musical legends.\n\nBy clicking Subscribe, you confirm that you have read and agree to our Terms of Use and acknowledge our Privacy Policy.
