        "text": "New York, NYâApril 25 2024 â The Apollo today announced this yearâs honorees for its Spring Benefit, the historic theaterâs largest annual fundraising event Â on Tuesday, June 11, 2024. Â Kenneth âBabyfaceâ Edmonds, one of the most celebrated creative forces in music history, will receive the inaugural Legacy Award at the Spring Benefit and be inducted into The Apolloâs legendary Walk of Fame the day prior, on Monday, June 10. Multi-platinum global superstar and eight-time Grammy Award-winning artist USHER will be honored at the celebratory benefit concert with the Icon Award.\n\nâ\n\nâI am humbled to receive the inaugural Legacy Award. For nearly a century, the theater has been a constant symbol of excellence in Black entertainment. So for The Apollo to honor my legacy feels nothing short of amazing,â said Babyface.\n\nâ\n\nâItâs an honor to be receiving this award from such an iconic and historic cultural institution in New York City â one that has hosted and paved the way for so many prominent people. Iâm humbled to be this yearâs recipient and look forward to seeing everyone soon,â said USHER.\n\nâ\n\nMarking the nonprofit organizationâs 90th anniversary as a home for artists and a champion of Black culture, the evening will feature special appearances by Hip Hop legend Big Daddy Kane, with Music Direction by GRAMMY and EMMY Award-winner Adam Blackstone and more to be announced.\n\nâ\n\nThe Theater also announced that it will induct Babyface into its Walk of Fame on Monday, June 10 at 11:30am, the day before the Spring Benefit. Babyface joins esteemed luminaries whose influence has shaped culture for generations and have performed on the iconic Apollo stage over the last nine decades, including Aretha Franklin, Quincy Jones, Richard Pryor, Patti Labelle, Smokey Robinson, Jackie âMomsâ Mabley, Gladys Knight, Lionel Richie, Ella Fitzgerald, Temptations, and most recently, Mary J. Blige. Inductees are honored with a plaque on the Apollo Walk of Fame, installed under the Theaterâs iconic marquee on 125th Street.\n\nâ\n\nThe Apolloâs 2023-2024 Season has featured signature programs, audience favorites, and exciting new works from artists pushing the boundaries of their art forms â from music and dance to theater, film, and beyond.\n\nâ\n\nâThe Apollo has stood as an enduring beacon in Harlem, nurturing artists, fostering education, and sparking creativity across the world,â said Michelle Ebanks, President & CEO of The Apollo. âIâm thrilled to celebrate the ongoing legacy of our organization and our commitment to arts and education at the Spring Benefit. It will be an unforgettable evening of performances and a time to honor our cultural icons.â\n\nâ\n\nAll proceeds will support the non-profit organizationâs year-round, world-class artistic, education, and community programs, as well as its commitment to articulating and projecting the African American narrative using arts and culture, and creating a 21st century performing arts canon.\n\nâ\n\nThe Apollo has been a place of dynamic energy and forward motion for more than 90 years. This year, the nonprofit organization celebrates its first-ever expansion with The Apollo Stages at The Victoria at 233 West 125th Street, just down the block from its Historic theater, which will undergo restoration later this year, further solidifying the organization as a civic and economic cornerstone of Harlem and New York City.\n\nâ\n\nThe Spring Benefit begins with red carpet arrivals at 5:00 PM followed by the Benefit concert and awards ceremony at 7:00 PM. The evening will also include the eventâs legendary afterparty designed by celebrated event designer and Apollo board member Bronson Van Wyck.\n\nâ\n\nWatch for upcoming announcements as The Apollo unveils a thrilling line-up of special honorees and performers.
