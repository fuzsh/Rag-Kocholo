        "text": "Babyface has spent a lifetime writing love songs with his inner child in mind. Growing up in Indianapolis in the 1960s, the producer-songwriter born Kenneth Edmonds was so enamored with the idea of romance that, decades later, he would tap into those sacred adolescent emotions whenever he created a record. “I would write songs and try to remember those feelings of puppy love,” he explains over Zoom, his eyes hidden behind reflective shades he never removes. “It was much more powerful than adult love, when there are many more complications. We were naive. We didn’t know everything. And it was nice to not know everything.”\n\nThat obsession with love blossomed into a career of singing, writing, and producing bleeding-heart records like the clever 1987 ballad “Two Occasions” (from his early group the Deele) and his own sleek, pleading solo single “Whip Appeal,” released a few years later, at the start of his his most commercially successful decade. For 1995’s Waiting to Exhale soundtrack, he pulled off the incredible feat of commissioning R&B’s coolest and most unparalleled vocalists—Whitney Houston, Mary J. Blige, Toni Braxton, Brandy, and more—to power a whirlwind of songs about tenderness, commitment, and fury-inducing heartbreak.\n\nHis forthcoming 11th album, Girls’ Night Out, is an attempt to replicate that soundtrack’s alchemy with a new generation of women. Instead of penning all the songs himself, he co-wrote and recorded with each artist in separate one-day sessions; his collaborators include Doechii, Yung Baby Tate, Kehlani, Ari Lennox, and Ella Mai, heard on the dulcet lead duet “Keeps on Fallin’.”\n\nSitting in his Los Angeles recording studio, the 63-year-old spoke about the songs that have soundtracked his life, giving the sense he’s still writing for the boy who got his heart broken in middle school. “It all goes back to the same thing, that puppy love,” he says, wistfully. “Only the song structures change, not the feeling behind it.”\n\nLesley Gore: “It’s My Party”\n\nBabyface: I remember riding in the car—a Studebaker—and hearing that song. I was living in Indianapolis, on the north side. I can picture everybody in the car: my father driving, my mom. That emotion hit me early on, and it stuck with me. It wasn’t a lot of riffs—just a simple tone. I learned something from that: It wasn’t so much about being an amazing singer, it was about having a good tone that made people feel good. I had no idea who sang it, and it wasn’t until years later that I discovered that Quincy Jones had produced it. I was looking at who produced that kind of song—how versatile he was, doing something like that, then going into scoring, and from that to Ella Fitzgerald. I wanted to be like Quincy.\n\nArchie Bell & the Drells: “Tighten Up”\n\nThe most interesting thing about Indianapolis was that there were so many garage bands competing. My brother Melvin was in one of the main ones, Soul Innovations, and he influenced me to want to make music in the first place. “Tighten Up” was one of those songs people were trying to play in their garages. Of course, Archie Bell had that party voice, and nobody could quite [replicate] that. But it was really about the groove. Listening to those songs helped prepare me for when I had to start getting out of slow songs. When I joined a group years later, they kept calling me “Waterfall” because everything I made was pretty and waterfall-y.\n\nGladys Knight & the Pips: “Neither One of Us (Wants to Be the First to Say Goodbye)”\n\nI was always falling in love and being in love with love. There was a girl that I fell for in sixth grade through eighth grade, till she broke my heart. I fell back in love again with another girl, and she was going away for the summer, so neither one of us came in at the right time. This song was me imagining what we were saying. Gladys hit those notes; she hit that feeling. I was always pulled into songs that had emotion—not just the melodies and lyrics, but who was singing it. Did they tell a story? Did they make you feel that? Gladys made you feel it every time she’d sing one note. It was one of those songs I would play again and again, not even knowing it was helping shape me as a songwriter. She spoke to me, always.\n\nEarth, Wind & Fire: “September”\n\nWhen Earth, Wind & Fire came out, it was a mystical journey—I was writing songs completely differently because of them. I went through a period where I was writing for whatever situation I was in, but not writing as commercially as I should have. Earth, Wind & Fire was the beginning of my getting serious about being in a band and wanting to go beyond just falling in love. At that point, I was in a group called Manchild. We started at the end of ninth grade between ’73 and ’74. We played every Earth, Wind & Fire song; we were so Earth, Wind & Fire that, years later, one kid who went away to college came back and saw Earth, Wind & Fire and said, “I just saw some group that stole everything you guys do. You need to sue.”\n\nDeBarge: “Time Will Reveal”\n\nI remember being in Cincinnati, Ohio, and never going to clubs. But one time, I went to the club and heard Chaka Khan’s “Ain’t Nobody,” and—I think for the first time—went to the dancefloor. Then they played “Time Will Reveal,” and I had to slow dance. But I didn’t mind it because that song hit me perfectly. I thought, Who is this, and how do they know to play these chords and get this feeling? It comes so naturally. I learned later, working with El DeBarge, that’s just who he is. Part of the magic is that it comes from the church. These kids were raised in the church, and they know those chords you play that can make you want to get saved—and they were able to figure out how to take those and put them on love songs. To this day, it stays magical to me.\n\nAl B. Sure!: “Nite and Day”\n\n“Two Occasions” came out around the same time as “Nite and Day,” and it was one of the songs that stopped us from going to No. 1. But when I heard that song, I said, “Oh my God, it’s genius.” Al B. Sure! was killing it with the soft, pretty voice. Once again, it was: How do I keep writing commercial songs that feel good? It’s a pretty song that was grooving, and that’s a great combination. It kept us from getting to the top of the chart, understandably. You’re never trying to write songs just so that you can make money. It’s writing songs so that everybody will sing the words, which may translate to money at some point.\n\nJanet Jackson: “That’s the Way Love Goes”\n\nThe feel of that song is so sexy, so right. You don’t even have to hear the words; you can fall in love as much on a groove as you can with a ballad. The way the guitar was used, the smoothness of it, the chill, the laidback feel—it was perfection. [Producers] Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis figured out the special sauce and kept doing it. Most of my career was about trying to be as versatile as Jimmy and Terry, and writing as many hits as they were writing. Part of being a good writer and producer is appreciating your contemporaries and learning from their work.\n\nBeyoncé: “Crazy in Love” [ft. JAY-Z]\n\n“Crazy in Love” was the beginning of Superstar Beyoncé. She doesn’t play around; whatever you did [as a producer] had to have more pep in the step, because she changed the game. It was like when Janet did Control—a moment that we saw a woman take control, and own it. Ever since that moment, Beyoncé has never let it go. As a producer and songwriter, it’s not always just the music. It’s also about the attitude behind those artists and how they carry it. Not just any girl could come out and do “Crazy in Love.” If you’re going to write that, make sure you got somebody that can do it. At that point, you’re just trying to write to get on Beyoncé records.\n\nT.I.: “Whatever You Like”\n\nT.I. is a rapper who came singing. It wasn’t the best singing, but it felt so good. That’s the incredible thing about music: You don’t always have to be the best singer, you just have to be the best deliverer of pain or feel-good. For “Whatever You Like,” the swag he had was perfect. Some people thought it wasn’t really singing. But people can try to sing like Drake or Kanye, and it won’t feel as good. There’s a magic to it; it’s how they do it. I respect that because they know what their audience wants to hear. It’s important for me to listen to that and not judge it. I listen to see: What about it makes me feel good?\n\nLorde: “Royals”\n\nWhen she came out, it was like, Who is this kid? And at the time, it seemed rambunctious and rebellious, which is so rare. The whole concept of it was great. It’s not easy to grab a big moment like that, and keep it going. Some people only change the game for themselves; they didn’t open doors for other people, because it’s such their lane that nobody else can come in and do it. There lies Bruno. Ed Sheeran. Adele. There lies Rihanna. They carved their space, and no one’s going to threaten that. The Lorde song was one of those songs that caught everybody off guard. Girls were doing this, from Avril to P!nk. And then you have Lorde, and we end up with a Billie Eilish, who’s been given permission to sing about more than just puppy love.\n\nFrom 55, it became important for me to listen in a different way. If you want to stay in the game and keep making music, you have to understand what moves people. Not what moved them yesterday, but what moves people today. Some people will put music out and not care who it reaches. As a songwriter, I like to think that it reaches new people. After I did the Verzuz with Teddy Riley, I ended up picking up a lot more fans that were younger that I didn’t know that I had.\n\nElla Mai: “Boo’d Up”\n\nThis song reminded me of things we’ve done before but with a new voice, which is what I was doing initially. I’d hear Smokey Robinson and other writers and tweak it for my age group. That’s what “Boo’d Up” represented. It was clever. For me, it was one of the beginnings of the new R&B, a chance for R&B to reintroduce itself. That was an important record that gave people the license to say, OK, maybe we can roll like this again and not have to be completely hip-hop oriented. Their voices are different than the women of yesterday. They’re far more independent and not afraid to cuss. There was a time back in the day when I would’ve been like, “You can’t say that.” But I learned from younger artists that it’s OK to be free, but within that freedom in songwriting, there should still be some structure. There are things that make a difference in terms of how long something lasts and how many people you can reach."
