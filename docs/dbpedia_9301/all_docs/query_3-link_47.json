        "text": "When most music aficionados think Babyface, the images conjured are of one of the most lionized producers in pop history. Kenny “Babyface” Edmonds has written and produced 26 No. 1 R&B hits and has won 11 Grammy awards for his work behind the board.\n\nEdmonds has produced some of the most legendary figures to ever step behind the microphone. Michael Jackson, Barbra Streisand and Stevie Wonder are just some of the iconic vocalists to work with Edmonds.\n\nBut Edmonds is also an accomplished singer-songwriter. Performing Sunday at the Keswick Theater, he is touring behind his latest album, \"Return of the Tender Lover.\" The project, his first solo album in a decade, is filled with warm, gentle love songs.\n\nEdmonds, 57, is the master of the romantic track. Such albums as 1989’s “Tender Lover,” 2004’s “A Love Story” and 2005’s “Grown & Sexy” are filled with songs about relationships.\n\nExpect plenty of love songs when Edmonds takes the Keswick stage. But where is the love, as in love songs these days? So many contemporary artists are all about conspicuous consumption when it comes to the heart of songs.\n\n“That’s what it is today,” Edmonds says while calling from Los Angeles. “Pop culture doesn’t push love. Music is like fast food. It’s about being immediate and love isn’t fast. But it’s not just music that’s guilty of this. It’s our lives. It’s how we buy clothes. We order everything online. You don’t go to the record store to pick out CDs. You go online. The whole art of buying anything in person is gone. The whole idea of love is not something you can reach out and touch anymore.”\n\nHowever, there are exceptions. Adele’s “21” has sold over 20-million albums and is the best-selling album of the past decade. Adele's follow-up, \"25,\" also comprised love songs and has nearly matched those figures. If a recording artist makes a great album of love songs, it will sell since everyone can relate to love.\n\n“I totally agree with that,” Edmonds says. “It’s just that there aren’t as many people making those kind of albums anymore. But I’m still doing it.”\n\nThe prior album Edmonds crafted full of love songs is one of the finest of his storied career. “Love, Marriage and Divorce,” a collaboration with vocalist Toni Braxton, dropped in 2014. The release is a tour de force that takes the listener through the stages of what is a common contemporary relationship.\n\nBoth Edmonds and Braxton, longtime friends and collaborators, suffered through recent splintered marriages. But Edmonds insists the tracks are inspired by Braxton’s experience.\n\n“It’s not difficult to be the passenger in life and that’s what I was with that album,” Edmonds says. “I was the passenger with Toni driving. She went through a really rough time and we’ve been working together for so long that she’s like my kid sister. We had a great time making songs that mean something to us. But I generally always have a great time in the studio. The same goes for this album. Fun in the studio with love songs. I love making music.”\n\nThe experiences Edmonds has had in the studio screams book. Edmonds is often asked what it was like to work with the King of Pop.\n\n“Michael was beyond extraordinary,” Edmonds says. “Before I worked with him, another hero I worked with, Lionel Richie gave me some great advice. He told me not to get pulled in by Michael’s magic. He said, ‘if you do that, you’ll be working for him forever and it’ll take forever for you to get paid.’ So I didn’t get pulled in by Michael’s magic and there was magic, which came from him. There’s no doubt about that. I watched guys who were so hardened by this industry just turn to pudding around him. I actually had conversations with him. I didn’t get blown away while working with him.There was a wow factor with Michael but the key to producing is not to become too close with anyone.”\n\nTwo recording artists consistently cracked up Edmonds. “I loved working with Whitney Houston,” Edmonds says. “She was so nice to work with and she was funny. TLC was hilarious and believe it or not, Stevie Wonder is one of the silliest guys you’ll ever meet.”\n\nEdmonds is always thinking ahead. He’s planning another solo album.\n\n“That’s the way I am,” he says. “Right now I’m jotting down notes and getting ready for what I’ll do in the future. I’m fortunate since I love my work. I can’t get enough of music, whether I’m producing or writing with someone or making my own album.”\n\nKenny \"Babyface\" Edmonds appears Sunday at the Keswick Theatre, Glenside.
