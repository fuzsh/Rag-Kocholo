        "text": "Kenneth \"Babyface\" Edmonds, known for his smooth sound beloved by fans, has been serenading audiences for over 45 years. His hits, including \"When Can I See You Again\" and \"Whip Appeal,\" have endured over time.\n\nThough, of all his songs, there isnât one he considers a favorite.\n\n\"It's a group, it is the collection that is more important because all the artists that I worked with throughout the years, it is hard to put anyone on top of anyone. I don't have a favorite song, it's like saying a favorite child,â said Edmonds.\n\nFans clearly have their preferred tracks. The singer, songwriter and producer boasts 125 Top 10 Hits, 45 No. 1 R&B hits and 16 No. 1 pop hits.\n\nHis influence extends far, having penned songs for icons such as Whitney Houston, Mary J Blige, Aretha Franklin, Madonna, Beyonce and Jay-Z.\n\nSpeaking about Black music genres, like R&B and soul, Edmonds said they are emotional art forms.\n\n\"For me, it is just who we are. It is what comes out of us and the stories, the pain, the happiest, the love, all of that, writing about that, being able to put that in melody has always been something I strove for. I think that there is something that happens when it is coming from our culture, we express it a little bit differently,â he said.\n\nEdmonds co-founded Laface Records with music producer L.A. Reid, and helped launch the careers of numerous superstar artists, including Usher.\n\nIn the 1980s, he was a member of the band The Deele. Recently honored at the Apollo theater for his achievements, the Indianapolis native reminisced about his early struggles in New York City during the 1970s.\n\n\"I was in a group called Manchild, we stayed here and we couldn't afford to pay the hotel bill and they wouldn't let us take our luggage out and we got stuck,\" Edmonds said of the Edison hotel.\n\nReflecting on his career, Edmonds expressed gratitude, telling a crowd of fans that God has blessed him for decades and he hopes to continue making music people love.\n\nâI'm going to keep on doing whatever I've been doing and hopefully people like what I'm writing,â he said."
