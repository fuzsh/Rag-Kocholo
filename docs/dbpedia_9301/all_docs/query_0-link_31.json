        "text": "Kenneth Brian Edmonds (born April 10, 1959), known as Babyface, is an American R&B musician, singer-songwriter, and record producer. He has written and produced over 26 No. 1 R&B hits throughout his career, and has won 11 Grammy Awards.\n\nEarly Life[]\n\nEdmonds was born on April 10, 1959, in Indianapolis, Indiana, to Marvin and Barbara Edmonds. Barbara was a production operator at a pharmaceutical plant. Edmonds, who is the fifth of six brothers (including future After 7 band members Melvin and Kevon Edmonds, the latter of whom went on to have a modestly successful solo career), attended North Central High School in Indianapolis, Indiana, and as a shy youth, wrote songs to express his emotions. When he was in eighth grade, Edmonds' father died of lung cancer, leaving his mother to raise her sons alone. At this stage, Edmonds became determined to have a career in music.\n\nMusic career[]\n\nEdmonds later played with funk performer Bootsy Collins, who tagged him \"Babyface\" because of his youthful look. He also performed in the group Manchild (which had a 1977 hit \"Especially for You\" with band member Daryl Simmons) as a guitarist. He played keyboards in the light-funk and R&B group the Deele (which also included drummer Antonio \"L.A.\" Reid, with whom he would later form a successful writing and producing partnership). One of his first major credits as a songwriter for outside artists came when he wrote the tune \"Slow Jam\" for the R&B band Midnight Star in 1983. The tune was on Midnight Star's 1983 double-platinum No Parking on the Dance Flooralbum, and while it never was a single, it received massive radio airplay and the song is still played on quiet stormradio stations. Babyface remained in the Deele until 1988, when both he and Reid left the group.\n\nHis album Playlist consists of eight cover songs and two original works. It was released on September 18, 2007. It was the first album on the newly re-launched Mercury Records label.\n\nOn February 4, 2014, he released a Grammy Awards winning duets album with Toni Braxton titled Love, Marriage & Divorce on Motown Records.\n\nOther ventures[]\n\nWriting and producing[]\n\nIn the late 1980s, he contributed to the creation of new jack swing, writing and producing music for the likes of Bobby Brown, Karyn White, Pebbles, Paula Abdul and Sheena Easton.\n\nIn 1989, Edmonds co-founded LaFace Records with Reid. Three of the label's early artists TLC, Usher, and Toni Braxton were very successful. TLC's second album CrazySexyCool, for which he wrote and produced some of the hits, became the best selling album of all time by an American girl group. Toni Braxton's first two albums, Toni Braxton (1993) and Secrets (1996), for which he wrote the majority of the songs, went on to sell a combined total of over 10 million copies in America alone.\n\nBabyface helped form the popular late-1990s R&B group Az Yet. Edmonds also helped to mold and worked closely with some of his former wife Tracey Edmonds acts such as Jon B and producer Jon-John Robinson.\n\nEdmonds has worked with many successful performers in contemporary music. “I’m Your Baby Tonight” (1990), produced for Whitney Houston, was his first No. 1 Top 40 hit in the US. He also wrote and produced Boyz II Men's 1992 \"End of the Road\" and 1994 \"I'll Make Love to You\", both of which established records for the longest stay at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. He co-wrote, co-produced, and provided backing vocals on Madonna's 1994 Bedtime Stories, which featured the seven-week No. 1 hit \"Take a Bow\", and shared billing with Eric Clapton on the chart-topping Grammy winner \"Change the World\" from the Phenomenon soundtrack. He also wrote and produced the No. 1 hit \"Exhale (Shoop Shoop)\" for Whitney Houston as well as the rest of the critically acclaimed 10 million-selling Waiting to Exhale soundtrack in 1995, which spawned additional hits for Houston, Brandy and Mary J. Blige.\n\nAdditionally, Edmonds has produced and written music for many artists including Carole King, Jessica Mauboy, Patti LaBelle, Chaka Khan, Aretha Franklin, Madonna, Janet Jackson, Faith Evans, Al Green, Beyoncé, Diana Ross,Sheena Easton, Toni Braxton, Michael Jackson, Michael Bolton, Paula Abdul, Eric Clapton, Pebbles, Tevin Campbell, Bobby Brown, Whitney Houston, Brandy, Mary J. Blige, Tamia, Shola Ama, 3T, Sisqó, Dru Hill, Fall Out Boy, Céline Dion, Samantha Jade, Honeyz, Katharine McPhee, Mariah Carey, Vanessa L. Williams, Chanté Moore,En Vogue, Zendaya, Kenny G, Kristinia DeBarge, Lil Wayne, Japanese singer Ken Hirai, P!nk, Colbie Caillat, Marc Nelson, TLC, Ariana Grande, Ella Henderson, Jessica Mauboy, Xscape, K-Ci & JoJo, N'SYNC and Phil Collinsamong others. He received three consecutive Grammy Awards for Producer of the Year in 1995–1997.\n\nBabyface was in the studio for about two years with Ashanti to produce her album The Declaration (2008).\n\nHe worked on the Lil Wayne album Tha Carter III (2008), on the Kanye West-produced \"Comfortable\". He also worked with R&B singer Monica for her sixth studio album Still Standing (2010).\n\nIn 2013, Babyface served as producer for Ariana Grande's debut album Yours Truly, producing the majority of her songs, including her second single, \"Baby I\".\n\nIn September 2014, Babyface collaborated with Barbra Streisand on her album Partners, performing a duet on the track \"Evergreen\" and background vocals for other album tracks.\n\nBabyface also collaborated with Foxes on her sophomore album, All I Need (2016), producing and co-writing \"Scar\".\n\nPersonal life[]\n\nBabyface married his first wife during his young adult years. In 1990, Babyface met Tracey Edmonds when she auditioned for the music video for his song \"Whip Appeal\". They married on September 5, 1992, and have two sons, Brandon and Dylan Michael Edmonds. In January 7, 2005, Tracey filed for divorce in Los Angeles County Superior Court, citing irreconcilable differences. In October 2005, Babyface and Tracey announced that they were ending their marriage of thirteen years.\n\nIn 2007, Babyface began dating his backup dancer Nicole \"Nikki\" Pantenburg (former backup dancer for and personal friend of Janet Jackson). In September 2008, Babyface and Nicole welcomed a daughter, Peyton Nicole Edmonds. The pair married on May 17, 2014.\n\nOn December 2, 2012, Babyface worked at a local Nathan's for charity. All proceeds went to Toys for Tots.\n\nIn 2015, Babyface donated money to the presidential campaign of Republican Senator Marco Rubio.\n\nLegacy[]\n\nIn 1999, a 25-mile (40-km) stretch of Interstate 65 that runs through Indianapolis was renamed Kenneth \"Babyface\" Edmonds Highway."
