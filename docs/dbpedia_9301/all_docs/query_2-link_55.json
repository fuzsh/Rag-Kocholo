        "text": "Four Winds Casino in New Buffalo announced this week it has added three major R&B artists to its 2023 concert schedule.\n\nOn Saturday, July 1st, 12-time Grammy Award winner Kenny “Babyface” Edmonds will hit the stage at the Silver Creek Event Center. On Saturday, October 14th, hit-makers Ashanti and Ginuwine are set to perform.\n\nTickets for both shows go on sale Friday at 11 a.m. and can be purchased at Ticketmaster.\n\nBabyface\n\nAs a recording artist, songwriter and producer, Babyface is one of the most celebrated creative forces in music history. In addition to his Grammys, he is the only producer to win the Producer of the Year category four times. He is also co-founder of the record label LaFace, which launched the careers of artists like Usher, Toni Braxton, TLC, Outkast, and Pink.\n\nFrom humble beginnings in Indianapolis, Babyface has written and produced hits for artists including: Bobby Brown, Boyz II Men, Eric Clapton, Madonna, Beyonce, Ariana Grande, Mary J Blige, Celine Dion, Aretha Franklin, George Michael, Michael Jackson, Justin Bieber, Phil Collins, Janet Jackson, Chaka Khan, Anita Baker, Faith Evans, Jay Z, Stevie Wonder, Chris Brown, John Mayer, Lionel Richie, Michael Bolton, Kenny G, Lil Wayne, Luther Vandross, Barbara Streisand, Puff Daddy, Bruno Mars, and countless others.\n\nThroughout his career, Babyface has won the BMI Pop Songwriter of the Year trophy seven times, received a total of 51 BMI Awards, as well as 4 American Music Awards, 5 Soul Train Awards, and 5 NAACP Image awards.\n\nMore information on Babyface can be found at www.babyfacemusic.com.\n\nAshanti and Ginuwine\n\nGrammy Award-winning singer/songwriter, actor and author Ashanti burst onto the music scene with her self-titled debut album, Ashanti. It landed the #1 spot on both the Billboard Top 200 and R&B album charts, selling a 504,593 units in its first week. This set a SoundScan record as the most albums sold by any debut female artist in the chart’s history and earned her a spot in the Guinness Book of World Records.\n\nOver the span of her 20-year career, Ashanti has released six studio albums and received a number of illustrious rewards including eight Billboard Awards, a Grammy, two American Music Awards, two Soul Train Awards and six ASCAP Awards.\n\nElgin B. Lumpkin, better known by his stage name Ginuwine, is a Grammy-nominated Icon Award recipient, legendary American singer, songwriter, dancer, actor, and philanthropist. Ginuwine’s career began as a member of Swing Mob, an R&B/hip-hop collective consisting of artists and record labels based in Rochester, New York. The record label and music compound were founded by Donald Degrate, better known as “DeVante Swing,” a popular 90’s R&B group Jodeci.\n\nGinuwine signed to Epic Records as a solo artist in the mid-1990s, releasing several and platinum-selling albums and singles. His commercial success came from his first four albums featuring hit singles “Same Ol’ G,” “So Anxious” and “None of Ur Friends Business.”"
