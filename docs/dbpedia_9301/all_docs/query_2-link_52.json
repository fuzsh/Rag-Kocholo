        "text": "On Thursday, September 5, four-time Grammy Award-winning singer SZA and 12-time Grammy Award-winning mega-producer Babyface will be honored at this year’s BMI 2024 R&B/Hip-Hop Awards. The ceremony honors the most prolific musicians and creatives within the R&B and hip-hop community.\n\nSZA will be honored with the BMI Champion Award, acknowledging her unwavering dedication and contributions to fostering the next wave of music creators. Following a landmark year marked by her chart-topping sophomore album, \"SOS,\" SZA clinched three Grammy Awards, solidifying her status as one of the most influential female artists in the industry. Her exceptional songwriting talent was underscored by the success of her single \"Snooze,\" for which she is the sole lyricist. A vocal advocate for musicians across all stages of the creative process, SZA continues to champion the cause of artistic empowerment.\n\nBabyface will be the main honoree of the night as the songwriter and producer will receive the BMI Icon Award. Babyface's multi-decade career has contributed to over 800 million records sold and over 800 billion streams. He has worked with the biggest names in music, like Aretha Franklin, Janet Jackson, Kenny G, Lil Wayne, Beyonce, Ariana Grande and Michael Jackson. Babyface has crafted a unique legacy as one of few musicians to have a highly successful career as a musician and producer. With 11 studio albums under his belt and dozens of production credits, Babyface has weaved his imprint into the history of recorded music.\n\nThe evening will be hosted by BMI President & CEO Mike O’Neill and Vice President, Creative, Atlanta, Catherine Brewton. The private event, to be held at Fairmount Century Plaza, will return to Los Angeles for the first time in nearly 10 years. “We’re excited to honor the legendary Babyface with the BMI Icon Award in celebration of his incredible talent and gift of prolific songwriting which has influenced decades of hits amongst all genres,” said Brewton.\n\n“We’ll also recognize the exceptional industry-shifting career of SZA, who challenges conventions and has a unique vibe that continues to transform and inspire a new feel of R&B that we have grown to love. It will be a phenomenal night of music celebrating BMI’s award-winning songwriters, producers and music publishers that we’re so fortunate to represent.”\n\nThroughout the evening, BMI will also salute the songwriters, producers and music publishers of the past year’s 35 most-performed R&B/Hip-Hop songs from BMI’s repertoire of more than 22.4 million musical works. The BMI R&B/Hip-Hop Songwriter, Top Producers, Producer and Publisher of the Year will also be named during the ceremony."
