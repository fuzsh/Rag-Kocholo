        "text": "For those who don’t know, Kenneth “Babyface” Edwards is a singer, songwriter, producer and label executive. He has been involved in many huge pop music projects ever since he began his commercial career in the 80s. Notable projects he was involved in include: Bobby Brown’s “Every Little Step,” Whitney Houston’s “I’m Your Baby Tonight” and Madonna’s “Take a Bow”. He is also the co-founder of LaFace Records and contributed to the development of acts such as Toni Braxton, TLC, Outcast and Usher.\n\nHe was born in Indianapolis, Indiana in 1959. He played in R n B bands as a teenager. Babyface admitted in an interview with Oprah Winfrey that in 1972 that he posed as a reporter so he could interview Jackson 5. The group inspired him to pursue music. Where does the name “Babyface” come from, you might ask. Early in his career Kenneth was working with Bootsy Collins, a member of the rock and roll hall of fame, who gave him the nickname, because he looked so young.\n\nIn the early 80s Babyface teamed up with Antonio “L.A.” Reid and started a funk group called The Deele. The musical group had several hit singles, and their first full length record hit number 77 on Billboard’s R&B charts. The two sort of went their separate ways after the third The Deele album. They did however co-found the LaFace record label. His solo career didn’t take off until 1986 when he was marked as one to watch. In 1989 “Tender Lovers”, his first solo album was a huge success.\n\nHe was nominated for the Album of the Year Grammy in 1992 for his production on the Bodyguard soundtrack featuring pop icons like Celine Dion, Mariah Carey and Mary J. Blige. He won his first grammy for Best Male R&B Vocal in 1994 for “When Can I See You Again”. This song could be classified as a ballad, it is a slow tempo song with acoustic guitar as the focus and bongos. It’s really a beautiful song with simple and honest lyrics and a catchy melody. He won another Grammy for Record of the Year as producer of Eric Clapton’s “Change the World.”\n\nMore recently (in 2006) Babyface was inducted into Songwriters Hall of Fame. He co-wrote and co-produced several songs on Ariana Grande’s “Yours Truly”, a number one album in the U.S. Love, Marriage & Divorce in 2014. He also won a Grammy Trustees Award in 2021.\n\nThere are very few singers, songwriters and producers that have as many accolades and recognition as Babyface. He has won numerous awards and topped different billboard charts multiple times. He has left a mark on the music industry and will continue to be influential for generations."
