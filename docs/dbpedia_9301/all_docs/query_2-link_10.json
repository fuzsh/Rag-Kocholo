        "text": "Babyface has grown up\n\nC\n\nincinnati is the place where Kenneth Edmonds caught a break in the music business, teaming with Queen City native L.A. Reid in the ’80s R&B band the Deele. The pair would go on to tremendous success on the business side of the music business, forming LaFace Records, home to acts such as TLC, OutKast and Usher.\n\nThere’s another reason why Cincinnati looms large in Edmonds’ career. It’s where he became Babyface, master of the feel-good slow jam.\n\nEdmonds – who in December returned to the top of the R&B charts for the first time since 1997 with “Hurt You,” a duet with Toni Braxton – talked about the importance of his stage name and discussed the legacy of those Babyface solo hits from the ’90s.\n\nQuestion: Did Bootsy Collins give you your nickname? That story seems too good to be true.\n\nAnswer: It is true. It happened in Cincinnati. Gosh, what was the name of the studio, the studio that was there for years?\n\nQ: QCA on Spring Grove Avenue?\n\nA: QCA, that’s it. We were there in 1984. We were doing some work, the Deele. L.A. and Kayo (from the Deele) were helping do some demos with Bootsy. I came down while they were working, and he saw me, and he yelled out, “Babyface.” Everybody just laughed. It’s just a name that started to stick. I fought it for a while, till one day we went out on tour in 1985. There was a song I would sing called “Sweet November.” After I’d sing it, Dee (his band mate) would say, “That was Kenny Edmonds.” There’d be a little bit of applause. Then one night, he goes, “That was Babyface.” Well, in saying that name, suddenly, at the end of the show, I had girls coming up asking where Babyface was. They never asked where Kenny Edmonds was.\n\nQ: Why didn’t you like the name at first?\n\nA: I thought it was a little soft. But then I didn’t mind softness when the girls were coming up after the show.\n\nQ: Would you be who you are today if you had remained Kenneth?\n\nA: I don’t think so. Just like L.A. and Babyface, the ring that had. It wasn’t Babyface and L.A. That didn’t sound right. The way it rolls off your mouth, even the branding as related to doing production work. Had that name never come, I don’t think things would have been the same.\n\nQ: What’s your fondest memory from your days in Cincinnati?\n\nA: Those are the beginning years of the Deele and the struggle. We were living in one house. We had to cook our own food. There used to be a 7-11 or something like that. We used to go up and play Ms. Pac-Man. We used to watch “All My Children” all the time. Life was about waking up and writing music, a little fun in between, but the bottom line was figuring out how to make it in this business.\n\nQ: You popularized a contemporary R&B sound that permeated the airwaves in the 1990s. What’s the legacy of that sound?\n\nA: I just did a show with Toni Braxton. We’re out doing this duets album. We opened up the show with “Give You My Heart,” which was on the “Boomerang” soundtrack. The way the audience reacted and what I felt was like, “Wow, that feels so good.” Just now it’s starting to hit me that there’s a point where music can be dated, and you don’t want to hear it because it sounds too old school. And then at some point there’s a line that it gets beyond old school. And it’s just great music that you kind of love to hear at any point again. I think we’re getting to that point where the music that was quality and felt good, it’s gonna feel good forever now. ¦\n\nBabyface on disc\n\n? Lovers (1986)\n\n? Tender Lover (1989)\n\n?
