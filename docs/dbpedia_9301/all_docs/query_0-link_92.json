        "text": "Kenneth âBabyfaceâ Edmonds, a 13-time Grammy-Award winner, was inducted into the Apollo Walk of Fame in Harlem on Monday.\n\nIt was a star-studded event outside the theater with Clive Davis, Mary J. Blige and Fat Joe in attendance.\n\nThey sang his praises as a recording artist, songwriter and producer.\n\nIn receiving the honor, Babyface thanked his music partners, fans and God.\n\nâI never imagined that I would get this,â he said. âI never saw myself actually being here at the Apollo. I didnât want to perform here because I didnât want to get booed. I didnât get booed, so I am so glad I came here to the Apollo.â\n\nMondayâs event with Babyface was the preview to the Apollo Spring Benefit, which is being held Tuesday evening.\n\nThe acclaimed artist will receive the Apolloâs inaugural Legacy Award during the benefit.\n\nMulti-platinum recording artist Usher, will also be honored at the benefit with the 2024 Icon Award."
