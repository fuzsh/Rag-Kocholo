        "text": "(born 1959). Between his own multi-platinum albums; a string of hits he wrote and produced for such artists as Boyz II Men, Toni Braxton, Mariah Carey, Eric Clapton, Celine Dion, Aretha Franklin, Whitney Houston, and Madonna; and the platinum-selling soundtrack for the 1995 hit feature Waiting to Exhale, Grammy Award-winning Babyface was one of the most successful stars in American pop music at the end of the 20th century.\n\nKenneth Edmonds was born on April 10, 1959, in Indianapolis, Indiana. One of six brothers, Kenny grew up in a musical family. By high school, he was already performing with bands in clubs throughout the Midwest. Joining a regional group called The Deele, he met Antonio (L.A.) Reid, with whom he would later write and produce some of pop and R & B’s biggest hits. Dubbed Babyface early in his career by Bootsy Collins of Parliament-Funkadelic, Edmonds adopted the name to use professionally.\n\nIn the mid-1980s Babyface recorded three albums with The Deele and cowrote their biggest hit, “Two Occasions” (1988). Although his solo debut album, Lovers (1987), met with a lukewarm reception, he left the group in 1988 to pursue a solo career as a writer and producer. In collaboration with L.A. Reid and later Daryl Simmons, Babyface produced a number of pop and R & B hits, including: the Whispers’ “Rock Steady”; the Boys’ “Dial My Heart” and “Lucky Charm”; Sheena Easton’s “The Lover in Me”; “Ready or Not” and “Can’t Stop” by After 7, a group that included Babyface’s brothers Melvin and Kevon Edmonds; Bobby Brown’s “Don’t Be Cruel”; Whitney Houston’s “I’m Your Baby Tonight”; and TLC’s “Baby, Baby, Baby” among others.\n\nBabyface’s second solo album, Tender Love (1989), which featured the hit singles “It’s No Crime,” “Tender Lover,” “Whip Appeal, ”and “My Kinda Girl,” sold multi-platinum. That same year he founded LaFace Records, an offshoot of Arista Records, which quickly became a major force in producing black and pop music with hit albums, including Toni Braxton’s debut Toni Braxton (1993) and TLC’s mega-hits Ooooooohhh...On The TLC Tip (1992) and Crazysexycool (1994).\n\nIn 1992 Babyface wrote and produced Boyz II Men’s Grammy Award-winning smash hits “End of the Road” and “I’ll Make Love To You.” The following year he released his third solo album, For The Cool In You, featuring his most successful pop single to date, “When Can I See You.”\n\nBabyface embarked on his first solo tour at the end of 1994, co-headlining with Boyz II Men. Having already established himself as a premier songwriter, he proved himself as a consummate performer as well. In late 1995 the feature film Waiting to Exhale was released. The movie soundtrack, featuring Babyface’s songs arranged for an all-female vocal cast, quickly soared to the top of the pop and R & B charts. Babyface also wrote and produced Eric Clapton’s hit single “Change the World” from the feature film Phenomenon."
