If Arsenal returning to the top of the Premier League table felt like a statement before Jurgen Klopp’s side were held by Manchester United in the final fixture of the weekend, it also sends a message ahead of what is shaping up to be one of the defining clashes of the campaign on the Saturday before Christmas. As Manchester City jet off to the Club World Cup amid their worst run of form in years under Pep Guardiola, it leaves a clear top two in the Premier League table: they meet at Anfield next weekend.\n\nAfter defeat at Aston Villa, who may feel they should also be in the conversation after their late win at Brentford, returning to winning ways was the objective here for Mikel Arteta’s side. They managed to do so against a Brighton team whose struggles in the Premier League continued after hitting further heights in Europe in midweek. Arsenal had almost all the chances and almost all the shots against Roberto De Zerbi’s visitors and for the first time in 33 top-flight matches, Brighton failed to score.\n\nArsenal break Brighton spell to set up early Premier League title showdown\n\nArsenal‘s ‘positive' Champions League campaign\n\n10:50 , Mike Jones\n\nMikel Arteta believes his Arsenal side have shown enough in the group stage to prove they can compete back in the Champions League.\n\n“Overall, I think, very positive,” he said in his press conference when asked how Arsenal’s return to the Champions League had gone.\n\n“Having not been in the competition for six or seven years and having a team that hasn’t got that much experience, I think we’ve competed really well.\n\n“I really liked the approach of the team in every single game, the way we’ve tried to play. We had some big results and big experiences, like the one we had in Seville or Lens, or even today looking at how the team can act and how fair it is to give certain players that exposure when you make so many changes.\n\n“Overall finishing first with a game to play we have to be really happy. Now we have to now close that chapter until February and make sure that when that chapter opens up again that we’re in the best place to compete against another top side.”\n\nMan City faced with frustrating form irony just as they look to win crown of world’s best team\n\n10:45 , Mike Jones\n\nManchester City have often been described as the best team in the world. The penultimate step to officially claiming that title falls on the 25th anniversary of a historic low. On 19 December 1998, City lost 2-1 to York: their fifth consecutive league game without a win left them 12th in the old Division 2, rendering them the 56th best team in England. On 19 December 2023, they face Urawa Red Diamonds in the semi-final of the Club World Cup. Win then and only Fluminense or Al Ahly stand in their way in Friday’s final.\n\n“Years ago we could not imagine to be there and we are there,” said Pep Guardiola. “I’m very pleased and excited to go there to try and win it.” It has been a remarkable rise, albeit one facilitated by about £2bn of investment from Sheikh Mansour and one clouded by 115 Premier League charges. But now, a quarter of a century after City were 15 points behind Walsall, City have one of the greatest managers in history and a treble only previously achieved by Manchester United in a season when their neighbours were a third-tier club.\n\nNow they arrived in Saudi Arabia as favourites to retain both the Premier League and the Champions League. And yet, for a club on the brink of adding a fifth trophy of 2023 and an achievement that would symbolise a time of dominance, at something of a low.\n\nMan City faced with form irony as they look to win crown of world’s best team\n\nChampions League more important than Club World Cup says Guardiola\n\n10:40 , Mike Jones\n\nManchester City boss, Pep Guardiola is excited to take his side to Saudi Arabia to participate in the Club World Cup but confirmed that the club’s priorities are on the mainstream competitions including the Champions League.\n\nHe said: “The Champions League is more important, absolutely.\n\n“But to play this tournament that we have never played before – you need to be there. And we are going to fly there and see the environment, how it is, and play against Urawa the best as possible to deserve to get to the final.\n\n“Of course, it’s nice. Years ago we could not imagine to be there and we are there.”\n\nPep Guardiola excited for Club World Cup\n\n10:35 , Mike Jones\n\nPep Guardiola says he is “very pleased and excited” that Manchester City are taking part in the Club World Cup in Saudi Arabia over the coming days.\n\nThe treble winners go into the tournament after a slump in results, dropping points in five of their last six Premier League games to leave them fourth in the table.\n\nPlaying Club World Cup matches on Tuesday and Friday, they do not return to league action until December 27, by which time there could be a considerable gap between them and the top of the table.\n\nGuardiola siad: “We love to go to play the (Club) World Cup. To go there you have to win the Champions League. I’m very pleased and excited to go there and try to win it, of course.\n\n“The schedule is what it is, the results are what they are and you have to accept it.”\n\nAnother cruel comeback sees Newcastle perish in group of death\n\n10:30 , Mike Jones\n\nIt was the sequel Newcastle United did not want, the second cruel comeback in as many Champions League games. For some 45 minutes, including half-time, they could savour the sight of a table that showed them in second, permitting them to imagine a date with Real Madrid or Bayern Munich in the knockout stages. And then, little more than half an hour, they were ejected from Europe altogether.\n\nChristian Pulisic’s equaliser threatened to condemn them to the Europa League. Samuel Chukwueze’s winner instead meant that spot goes to AC Milan. The group of death went down to the dying minutes, but Newcastle have perished. They had savoured a return to Europe but there will be no continental trips for them in the spring of 2024.\n\nAnother cruel comeback sees Newcastle perish in group of death\n\nThe latest centurion\n\n10:25 , Luke Baker\n\nOn the opening matchday of this year’s campaign Bayern Munich’s Thomas Müller became just the third player in history to record 100 Champions League wins (in 143 games).\n\nCristiano Ronaldo (115 wins in 183 games) and Iker Casillas (101 wins in 177 games) are the other two players to reach the landmark.\n\nBayern went unbeaten through the group stages and look like potential challengers for to claim the European title this year.\n\nA surprise entry\n\n10:20 , Mike Jones\n\nFC Copenhagen have qualified from their Champions League group for the second time, having previously done so in 2010/11.\n\nThey are the only Danish club to have finished in the top two in a Champions League group having beaten out Manchester United and Galatasaray to finish behind Bayern Munich in Group A.\n\nThey are in the unseeded pot and could come up against Manchester City or Arsenal in the last-16.\n\nHow Manchester United’s worst-ever Champions League campaign unravelled — and who is to blame\n\n10:15 , Mike Jones\n\nAs the final whistle blew on Manchester United’s European campaign, the cast list on the pitch included Jonny Evans, Kobbie Mainoo, Facundo Pellestri and Hannibal Mejbri. One represents the past, another may be the future, two are likely to be footnotes in any account of United. The understudies – in some cases, the unknowns – representing a club who have spent £400m in 18 months, some £1.5bn in 11 years since Sir Alex Ferguson retired were the unwitting indications of how plans went awry. They ended up beaten by Bayern Munich with the kind of line-up likelier to be found in a pre-season friendly.\n\nIn different ways, it had gone wrong for their supposed superiors. Marcus Rashford’s Champions League season was curtailed early: United were 2-0 up against FC Copenhagen, looking likely to qualify when his accidental stamp on Elias Jelert brought a sending off then a suspension, before illness ruled him out of the Bayern match. For Casemiro, too, his final contribution was a red card, sent off in the second game against Galatasaray, the victim of one of Andre Onana’s blunders, banned and then injured thereafter. So much for the idea a multiple Champions League winner could have the same effect at Old Trafford. His sidekick in success at Real Madrid, Raphael Varane was an unused substitute when United conceded three goals in Istanbul to take their destiny out of their own hands.\n\nHow Man Utd’s worst-ever Champions League campaign unravelled — and who is to blame\n\nWhat are the rules of the draw?\n\n10:10 , Mike Jones\n\nThe group winners are seeded and will be drawn against one of the eight runners-up.\n\nTeams from the same countries cannot play each other in the last 16, and you cannot be drawn against a team you’ve already played in the group stages.\n\nThe group winners will be at home for the second leg.\n\nWhat will the last-16 fixtures take place?\n\n10:05 , Mike Jones\n\nFirst legs: 13/14/20/21 February 2024\n\nSecond legs: 5/6/12/13 March 2024\n\nChampions League last-16 draw\n\n10:00 , Mike Jones\n\nManchester City and Arsenal are the only two Premier League representatives in the Champions League knockout rounds after both teams finished top of their groups.\n\nManchester United and Newcastle were both eliminated from Europe entirely due to fourth place finishes.\n\nCity and Arsenal’s positions are group winners mean they will be placed in the seeded pots and should, in theory, end up with a favourable draw for the last-16.\n\nWho is through to the last-16?\n\n09:55 , Mike Jones\n\nRunners-up:\n\nRB Leipzig\n\nPSV Eindhoven\n\nFC Copenhagen\n\nNapoli\n\nInter Milan\n\nPorto\n\nParis Saint-Germain\n\nLazio\n\nWho is through to the last-16?\n\n09:50 , Mike Jones\n\nGroup winners:\n\nManchester City\n\nBayern Munich\n\nArsenal\n\nReal Sociedad\n\nReal Madrid\n\nAtletico Madrid\n\nBorussia Dortmund\n\nBarcelona\n\nWhen is the Champions League last-16 draw?\n\n09:45 , Mike Jones\n\nThe draw will take place on Monday 18 December.
