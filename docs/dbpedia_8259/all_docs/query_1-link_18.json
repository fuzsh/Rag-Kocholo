        "text": "The legendary midfielder leaves for Granada CF after a great career at Villarreal CF\n\nVillarreal CF and Granada CF have reached an agreement for Manu Trigueros, who will join the Andalusian side. As a way of paying tribute to him, the club will recognise the legendary midfielder with a tile in the Passeig Groc, Villarreal CF’s walk of fame, located in the outside wall of the Tribuna Stand at the Estadio de la Cerámica.\n\nThe midfielder from Talavera de la Reina brings his successful time at Villarreal CF after 14 seasons with the Yellow Submarine, 12 of them being part of the first team. He has played a total of 477 matches for the Yellows, making him the footballer with most matches in Villarreal CF history.\n\nIn his career as a Yellow, Manu Trigueros was a key part of all of the Submarine’s recent successes. He was part of the squad that returned Villarreal to the top flight in 2013, he won the UEFA Europa League in 2021, and reached the UEFA Champions League semi-finals in 2022.\n\nThere is no doubt that he is one of the most legendary footballers to defend the Villarreal CF shirt. As a Yellow, he scored 38 goals, some of which are among the most important in the history of the club, including one in the semi-finals of the UEFA Europa League against Arsenal FC (2021). He also has the honour of being the footballer to have played the most matches in the top flight with Villarreal CF.\n\nVillarreal CF would like to thank him for his hard work, dedication and professionalism during his long and successful career with the club, and would like to wish him the best of luck in the next stage of his professional career.\n\nThis will always be your home, Manu."
