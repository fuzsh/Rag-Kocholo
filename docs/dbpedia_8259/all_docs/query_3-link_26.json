        "text": "Newcastle United will host Arsenal in aPremier League fixture at St. James' Park on Sunday.\n\nWatch Newcastle vs Arsenal live on SlingTV in US!\n\nThe visitors have kept 29 clean sheets against Newcastle in the Premier League â€“ no side have kept more against a specific opponent in the competition's history after the reverse fixture between Arsenal and Newcastle in January this season ended 0-0.\n\nArticle continues below\n\nHowever, the Magpies haven't avoided defeat in both Premier League meetings with Arsenal in a season since 2010-11 and the Gunners would be desperate to better their record as they are gunning for the league title.\n\nThey are winless in their last three Premier League away games (D2 L1) and Mikel Arteta would want to fix this malaise as quickly as possible.\n\nMeanwhile, Newcastle would want to strengthen their grip on the third spot with another win. They have won their last three Premier League fixtures and have scored 13 goals in the process. And in the absence of William Saliba in Arsenal's defence, Eddie Howe's troops would fancy their chances against the second-placed team.\n\nGOAL brings you details on how to watch the game on TV in the U.S., UK and India as well as how to stream live online.\n\nKick-off time\n\nThe game is scheduled for April 23 at St. James' Park. It will kick off at 12:30 pm EDT in the USA.\n\nHow to watch Newcastle United vs Arsenal online - TV channels & live streams\n\nTV channels & streaming options\n\nIn the United States (US) it can be watched on USA Network, Telemundo Deportes En Vivo, and Telemundo. It will be available for streaming via Fubo, Sling TV, & NBC Sports App/Website.\n\nTeam news & squad\n\nArsenal team news\n\nArsenal will miss long-term absentees Mohamed Elneny, Takehiro Tomiyasu, and William Saliba. Meanwhile, Gabriel Magalhaes is a doubt with a foot injury which he picked up against Chelsea.\n\n\"We'll have to see tomorrow how he is, but he could not finish the game [against Chelsea], so that was obviously a big sign for us,' Mikel Arteta said about Magalhaes.\n\nThe Spanish manager might start Jakub Kiwior again but might choose to pick Leandro Trossard ahead of Gabriel Martinelli.\n\nArsenal possible XI: Ramsdale; White, Kiwior, Holding, Zinchenko; Xhaka, Partey; Saka, Odegaard, Trossard; Jesus\n\nNewcastle team news\n\nNewcastle will miss the services of Jamal Lascelles, Sean Longstaff and Emil Krafth due to injuries while Ryan Fraser remains banished from the first team.\n\nHowever, Allan Saint-Maximin has started training and might feature at some point in the match.\n\n\"Alan has trained. He trained yesterday, and it was great to see him back on the grass. He trained very well, too, so we'll make a decision on whether he will be involved,\" stated Howe.\n\nEither Callum Wilson or Alexander Isak will start upfront along with Miguel Almiron.\n\nNewcastle Possible XI: Pope; Trippier, Schar, Botman, Burn; Willock, Guimaraes, Joelinton; Murphy, Isak, Almiron\n\nHead-to-head record\n\nUseful links"
