They play in the Premier League and are one of the most successful clubs in English football, having won 13 First Division and Premier League titles and 10 FA Cups. They hold the record for the longest uninterrupted period in the English top flight and are the only side to have completed a Premier League season unbeaten.\n\nArsenal were founded in 1886 and, in 1893, became the first club from the south of England to join the Football League. They won their first major trophies—five League Championship titles and two FA Cups:—in the 1930s. After a lean period in the post-war years they became the second club of the 20th century to win the League and FA Cup Double, in the 1970–71 season, and in the 1990s and 2000s recorded a series of successes – during this time Arsenal won a Cup Double, two further League and FA Cup Doubles, and became the first London club to reach the UEFA Champions League Final.\n\nThe club's colours, traditionally red and white, have evolved over time. Similarly, the club have moved location; founded in Woolwich, south-east London, in 1913 they moved north across the city to Arsenal Stadium, in Highbury. In 2006 they made a shorter move, to the Emirates Stadium in nearby Holloway.\n\nArsenal have an estimated 27 million fans worldwide, and the fans have long-standing rivalries with several other clubs; the most notable of these is with neighbours Tottenham Hotspur, with whom they regularly contest the North London derby. Arsenal are also the third-richest club in the world as of 2009, valued at over $1.2 billion. The club have regularly featured in portrayals of football in British culture. Arsenal Ladies are the most successful English club in women's football and are also affiliated with the club.\n\nCurrent squads[]\n\nFirst Team Squad[]\n\nAs of 30 August 2016.\n\nPlayers out on loan[]\n\nReserve Squad[]\n\nManagement and coaching staff[]\n\nCurrent coaching staff[]\n\nClub alumni[]\n\nFormer players[]\n\nManagers[]\n\nClub honours[]\n\nDomestic league[]\n\nDomestic cup[]\n\nEuropean competition[]\n\nStatistics and records[]\n\nAttendance[]\n\nTransfers[]\n\nRecord results and performances[]\n\nClub league highs and lows[]\n\nClub goal records[]\n\n[]"
