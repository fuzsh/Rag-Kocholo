        "text": "JUST one more Champions League embarrassment to add to the catalogue for Gunners.\n\nWhile many Arsenal fans were hopeful after being drawn against Bayern Munich in the last 16, few were that surprised to see their side so heavily beaten.\n\nEmbarrassing defeats and early exits are as commonplace as a Premier League finish anywhere between second and fourth.\n\nKeep up to date with ALL the Arsenal news, gossip, transfers and goals on our club page plus fixtures, results and live match commentary\n\nUnder Arsene Wenger, they have made it through the group stage in every season since 2001 — but only won a total of eight knock-out ties in those 17 years.\n\nWith much to choose from, we’ve picked Arsenal’s nine most embarrassing Champions League losses.\n\nSpartak Moscow 4 Arsenal 1 — second group stage, 2000-01\n\nAFTER consecutive group stage exits, it was third time lucky for Arsenal.\n\nAnd they even made it through the second phase — but only after a hammering.\n\nThe Russian side, who would finish bottom, came from behind to hammer the Gunners with three second-half goals.\n\nArsenal 0 Inter Milan 3 — group stage, 2003-04\n\nIN the Premier League no one could beat Arsenal that season — but it was a different story in Europe.\n\nJulio Cruz, Andy van der Meyde and Obafemi Martins put Inter three-up before half-time in a Highbury mauling.\n\nHowever, Arsenal recovered to top the group and even win a knock-out match for the first time — against Celta Vigo.\n\nBraga 2 Arsenal 0 — group stage, 2010-11\n\nTHIS is your typical Arsenal away group game which they don’t take seriously and costs them top place every single season.\n\nThe fact that Andrey Arshavin, Marouane Chamakh and Carlos Vela were on the score sheet in an opening day 6-0 win shows the level of the opposition.\n\nBut in their second meeting, Braga netted twice in the final seven minutes and Arsenal finished behind Shakhtar Donetsk — who drew Roma — and faced a last-16 tie with Barcelona.\n\nMilan 4 Arsenal 0 — last-16, 2011-12\n\nSEASON two of Arsenal’s consecutive last-16 elimination run.\n\nIt was Barcelona a year earlier and, until now, this was the Gunners’ heaviest defeat.\n\nGoals from Kevin-Prince Boateng, Zlatan Ibrahimovic, as well as a Robinho double put this tie to bed, although Arsenal did produce a typically heroic, but pointless fightback to win the return 3-0.\n\nArsenal 1 Monaco 3 — last-16 2014-15\n\nLOSING becomes a habit and, when it comes to Champions League last 16 defeats, nobody does it more spectacularly than Arsenal.\n\nFinally, it appeared Wenger and Co had been given an easy tie — but goals from Geoffrey Kondogbia and Dimitar Berbatov either side of half-time put Monaco in control.\n\nAlex Oxlade-Chamberlain pulled a goal back in stoppage time, yet there was still time for further implosion as Yannick Carrasco netted a comical third.\n\nDinamo Zagreb 2 Arsenal 1 — group stage, 2015-16\n\nLIKELY to be the worst team in Champions League history to have beaten Arsenal.\n\nJosip Pivaric and Junior Fernandes put the Croats in control, before Theo Walcott pulled one back back and Olivier Giroud saw red.\n\nDinamo would earn no more points — and this season finished bottom of their group with no goals and a 100 per cent loss rate.\n\nArsenal 2 Olympiakos 3 — group stage, 2015-16\n\nIT WENT from bad-to-worse as Arsenal looked intent on trying to bow out at the group stage for the first time in 16 years.\n\nArsenal twice came from behind before going down to an Alfred Finnbogason goal less than a minute after netting their second equaliser.\n\nWenger’s decision to replace Petr Cech with David Ospina backfired as the Colombian had a stinker.\n\nBayern Munich 5 Arsenal 1 — group stage, 2015-16\n\nTHEIR first win in the competition came against competition favourites, Bayern.\n\nBut it was a third group stage defeat when they met again.\n\nBayern were three-up at half time — and Thomas Muller finished off the scoring on 89 minutes.\n\nBayern Munich 5 Arsenal 1 — last-16 2016-17\n\nAN ALEXIS SANCHEZ penalty just before half-time brought Arsenal level — and there was some hope of a different outcome.\n\nBut the Gunners just fell apart after half-time as Robert Lewandowski and Thiago Alcantara took in turns to score and, again Muller added a fifth just before the end.\n\nIt’s incredible how Arsenal never learn their lesson."
