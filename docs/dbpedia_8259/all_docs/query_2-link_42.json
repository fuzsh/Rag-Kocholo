        "text": "United Manager Chris Hughton said:\n\n\"I have to say the second goal, I thought, was offside and most definitely if it wasn't we thought Mike Williamson was impeded. Of course at 2-0, you have got to open up your game a little bit to give yourselves a chance to get back in and what you can't afford to do is make fundamental mistakes.\n\n\"Unfortunately we did and they had the quality to capitalise on them but we showed a lot of spirit. It was a young side, it was a different side but we certainly kept going to the end and had our own chances.\n\n\"We will put this one behind us because what we do have is a very big game on Sunday and I can guarantee you that, come Sunday, the lads will be very much focused and will know what the magnitude of the game is.\"\n\nPS: a short statement released late on Wednesday by Newcastle United read:\n\n\"Chris (Hughton) is our manager, and he'll remain our manager, and we will renegotiate his contract at the end of the year.\"\n\nAsked if renewed speculation pre-match over his position had affected him, Hughton said:\n\n\"It is difficult not to be, we are all aware about what goes on television, what is shown on television but I cannot do anything about that, I can just do the best job possible.\n\n\"I had the remit last season of trying to get this club back in to the Premier League - that I was able to do and I have a remit this season of keeping this club in the Premier League and we are a short way into this vision and we are doing okay.\n\n\"We have had our ups and downs this season but the league table says we are doing okay, so I can't affect anything that is said. It is of course very unfair, but that is the industry we work in.\n\n\"As far as I am concerned I am a strong character and you have to work around these situations....\"\n\nThey Said\n\nArsene Wenger commented:\n\n\"I am pleased with the performance. Saying that, the first goal was certainly the turning point in the game because we had a lot of domination but didnt take our chances early on in the game. Then Newcastle defended with numbers behind the ball and it became difficult to score.\n\n\"We were lucky with the first goal just before half time - that was certainly a blow for Newcastle. It put us in a position where we could break much more because Newcastle had to come out and thats basically what happened in the second half.\n\n\"I have to see if Bendtner blocked the central defender on purpose or not (leading up to the second goal). I have to see that again. For me Walcott was well in front of the central defender anyway so I dont think that has influenced the goal."
