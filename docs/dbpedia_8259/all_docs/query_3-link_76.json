(36.8 pct.).\n\n- ISU shot 40 pct. or above from beyond the arc in 14 games.\n\n- At 8.6 3FG made per game, ISU led the Big 12 and ranked 13th nationally in 3-pointers made per game.\n\n- Iowa State averaged 8.4 3-pointers per game in conference games to lead the league.\n\n- ISU broke the school record for 3-pointers made in a season with 275, eclipsing the old mark of 236 set in the 2008-09 season.\n\n- The Cyclones were second in the Big 12 in free-throw percentage in conference games only at 77.1 percent (175-227 FT).\n\n- ISU averaged 74.8 ppg to rank fifth in the Big 12 and 39th nationally...it is the best scoring average since the 2005-06 season (77.3).\n\n- ISU ranked sixth in the Big 12 and 85th nationally in free-throw pct. (overall games) at 72.1 pct, the best team percentage since 2001-02 (74.8 percent).\n\n- ISU shot 85 percent or better from the free-throw line in seven of 16 Big 12 games.\n\n- In six of ISU's 16 losses, the Cyclones had the lead or were tied with under a minute to play in regulation, including in four Big 12 losses.\n\n- In the losses vs. Oklahoma State (six-point lead), Kansas State (four-point lead) and Oklahoma (three-point lead) the Cyclones had the lead with under a minute remaining.\n\n- Nine of ISU's 16 losses were by six points or less.\n\n- ISU made 10 or more treys in 13 games.\n\n- ISU outshot 18 of 32 opponents this season, going 15-3 in those games.\n\n- ISU was 9-2 when outrebounding its opponent and 7-1 when shooting 50 percent.\n\n- ISU was 9-0 when holding an opponent to under 60 points.\n\n- The Cyclones held 12 teams to below 40 percent shooting, including three below 30 percent (Alabama State, Drake, Dartmouth).\n\n- ISU had five players averaging over 10.3 points per game who accounted for 85.1 percent of the scoring...ISU was one of three teams in the nation to have five players average double figures (Missouri, Detroit) in scoring.\n\n- ISU had at least three players score in double figures in 26 games, had four players score in double figures in 18 games and had five or more players score in double figures in seven games.\n\n- ISU had three players rank in the top-10 in the league in minutes played (1st- Diante Garrett, 36.7; 2nd-Scott Christopherson, 35.8; 9th-Jake Anderson, 33.3).\n\n- Garrett (38.8) and Christopherson (38.1) ranked No. 1 and No. 2 in the Big 12 (league games only) in minutes played.\n\n- ISU had equal or more assists than turnovers in 24 games this season, ranking third in the Big 12 in assist/turnover ratio at 1.2 a/t.\n\n- ISU ranked 42nd nationally in assists (15.0 apg) and 49th nationally in a/t ratio (1.2).\n\n- ISU won four Big 12 Rookie of the Week Awards this year: Jake Anderson (11-15, 2-21); Melvin Ejim (11-22, 12-13).\n\nIndividual Honors\n\nDiante Garrett\n\n- All-Big 12 Second-Team (Coaches; Associated Press)\n\n- USBWA All-District VI\n\n- Global Sports Hy-Vee Challenge MVP\n\n- Invited to Portsmouth Invitational\n\n- Cousy Award Nominee\n\nScott Christopherson\n\n- All-Big 12 Honorable Mention (Coaches)\n\nMelvin Ejim\n\n- Big 12 All-Freshman Team (KansasCity.com)\n\n- Big 12 Rookie of

All-Tournament\n\nBubu Palo\n\n- Second-Team Academic All-Big 12\n\nFred Hoiberg\n\n- Basketball Times National Rookie Coach of the Year\n\nExperienced Backcourt\n\n- Iowa State's squad was low in numbers and young in the post, but the backcourt had plenty of experience.\n\n- Starting senior guards Diante Garrett (99 starts) and Darion \"Jake\" Anderson (106 starts) had a combined 205 starts in Division I.\n\n- Add in junior Scott Christopherson, the Cyclones' other starter in the three-guard attack, who has 46 career starts, and that total increases to 251 career Division I starts in the backcourt for the Cyclones.\n\n- The backcourt trio scored a combined 3,603 points in their careers and accounted for 58.0 percent of Iowa State's scoring this season.\n\n- Garrett and Anderson both eclipsed the 1,000-point total in their respective careers...Garrett has 1,364 career points and Anderson has 1,563 points in his career.\n\n- The last time Iowa State had two 1,000-point scorers in its lineup was in 2005-06: Curtis Stinson (1,651) and Will Blalock (1,078).\n\nThe Cyclones Dig The Long Ball\n\n- Iowa State, with its arsenal of efficient shooters dotting the lineup at all times, thrived by the deep shot during the 2010-11 season.\n\n- The Cyclones ranked fifth in the Big 12 in 3-point accuracy (36.8 percent) and led the Big 12 in 3-pointers made per game (8.6 3fg).\n\n- ISU ranked 13th in the nation in 3-pointers made per game (8.6).\n\n- Iowa State's 275 3-pointers during the season set a new single-season school record, eclipsing the old mark of 236 treys set by the 2008-09 team.\n\n- ISU ranked 63rd nationally in 3-point shooting percentage (36.8 percent).\n\n- ISU made nine or more treys in 16 games, including 14 vs. Baylor and Kansas, which ties for the second-best single-game total in school history.\n\nMost Prolific 3-Point Shooting Teams in Iowa State History (3-pt. pg)\n\n2010-11 8.59\n\n2008-09 7.37\n\n2005-06 6.70\n\nMost 3-Pointers Made in a Season by an Iowa State Team\n\n2010-11 275\n\n2008-09 236\n\n2009-10 209\n\n2006-07 203\n\n2005-06 201\n\nShort In Numbers\n\n- The Cyclones only had 11 players eligible to play during the season.\n\n- Of the 11 players on the active roster, eight had never played a game for the Cyclones prior to the season (Palo, Anderson, Ejim, Railey, Godfrey, McKnight, McBeth, Mitchell).\n\n- The Cyclones were forced to add two members of the football team as walk-ons to help fill out the roster...Austin McBeth and Drew Mitchell joined the team prior to the Northern Illinois game on Jan. 3.\n\n- It marked the first time that an ISU football player joined the men's basketball team since Hughes Suffren did it in the 1988-89 season.\n\n- Iowa State had five current players on the roster who sat out under NCAA transfer rules (Chris Babb, Chris Allen, Anthony Booker, John Lamb, Royce White).\n\nRelying On The Starters\n\n- Because of its limited bench, Iowa State's starters all averaged over 27.8 minutes per game and accounted for 85.1 percent of the team's scoring.\n\n- All five starters averaged over double figures in scoring, one of three teams in the nation to have five players in double-digit scoring (Missouri, Detroit).\n\n- Diante Garrett tallied nine complete games, tying for sixth on ISU's season chart.\n\n- Garrett played in 620 of a possible 655 minutes in Big 12 action, ranking first in the Big 12 in minutes played (38.8) in conference games.\n\nCyclone Marksmen: Scott Christopherson And Jamie Vanderbeken\n\n- Two of the best outside shooters in Iowa State history were among the Cyclone starting five in senior Jamie Vanderbeken and junior Scott Christopherson.\n\n- Christopherson currently has the best 3-point field goal percentage clip in Cyclone history (minimum of 50 makes) at 43.7 percent (131-300 3FG).\n\n- Vanderbeken is third on the list at 42.4 percent (108-255 3FG)...the 6-11 center was a difficult matchup for opposing bigs with his ability to stretch the defense.\n\n- The duo combined for 43.1 pct. from downtown (239-555 3FG) in their careers.\n\n- The pair carried over their success to this season, as Christopherson was 86-of-195 (44.1 percent) and Vanderbeken was 65-of-153 (42.5 percent) from 3-point range.\n\n- Christopherson was third in the Big 12 and 11th nationally in 3FG percentage (44.1%) and ranked second in the Big 12 and 33rd nationally in 3-pointers pg (2.8).\n\n- Vanderbeken was fourth in the Big 12 in 3-point accuracy (42.5 percent)...he was seventh in the Big 12 in 3-pointers made per game (2.2).\n\n- Christopherson has made a 3-pointer in a school-record 34-straight games and had 24 games with two or more treys on the year, including eight with four or more.\n\n- Christopherson tallied two games with seven 3-pointers (California, Iowa) and Vanderbeken made seven treys vs. Baylor and six vs. Northern Arizona, Oklahoma St.\n\n- With over 50 treys made by Christopherson (86), Vanderbeken (65) and Diante Garrett (59), it marks the first time in school history where three Cyclones recorded 50 or more 3-pointers in a season.\n\n- Christopherson (86) and Vanderbeken (65) are just the second Cyclone duo to make over 60 3-pointers in a season: Fred Hoiberg (89) and Hurl Beechum (65) in 1994-95.\n\n- Christopherson earned honorable mention all-league honors by the Big 12 Coaches.\n\nConsecutive Games With A 3-Pointer By A Cyclone\n\n1. 34, Scott Christopherson 2010-\n\n2. 27, Mike Taylor 2007\n\n3. 21, Dedric Willoughby 1996-97\n\n4. 16, Lucca Staiger 2009-10\n\n16, Tim Barnes 2003\n\nGarrett Was The Leader\n\n- Iowa State senior Diante Garrett was the undisputed leader of the Iowa State team, pacing the team and ranking in the top-six in the Big 12 in scoring (17.3, 5th), assists (6.1, 1st) and steals (1.7, 6th).\n\nu Named All-Big 12 Second Team by the league's coaches and Associated Press...was also a USBWA District VI pick.\n\n- Garrett was arguably one of the most improved players in the nation, increasing his scoring by 8.1 ppg from last season (9.2-17.3 ppg).\n\n- Finished career as Iowa State's all-time leader in games played at 128.\n\n- Totaled the second-most assists in Iowa State history (611) and ranks ninth in career steals (153) in the ISU record books.\n\n- Ranks 16th all-time in career scoring at ISU with 1,364 points.\n\n- His 611
