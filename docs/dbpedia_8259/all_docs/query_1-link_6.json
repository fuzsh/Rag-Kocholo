        "text": "Chris Brunskill/Getty Images\n\nArsenal’s tumultuous season is slowly coming to an end and as the season draws close, the Gunners find themselves seven points behind Manchester United with a game in hand.\n\nArsenal still have an outside chance of clinching a first league title since the era of the \"Invincibles\" and they will require some magic from their players if they are to pull off this comeback.\n\nLast season it was Cesc Fabregas, Robin van Persie, Thomas Vermaelen who were key in Arsenal’s title quest and this year there were several match-winners for the Gunners.\n\nBut there have already been plenty of heroes so far in the season. We have witnessed the meteoric rise of Jack Wilshere—from talented player to an indispensable cog in the Arsenal midfield.\n\nThen there has been Arsenal’s Petit Prince, Samir Nasri who has been in scintillating form this season.\n\nThat is not to forget the likes of Robin van Persie, Theo Walcott, Bacary Sagna.\n\nBut which one of these Gunners was the real hero—who was Arsenal’s best player of the 2010-11 season?\n\nFind out and do voice your opinion if you think I have left out any player. Here is a look at the top five players of Arsenal’s topsy turvy season.\n\nClive Brunskill/Getty Images\n\nBacary Sagna\n\nSagna has been one of the most consistent performers for the Gunners and has displayed plenty of heart and commitment this season.\n\nHe has been rock solid at the back and has been dynamic in attack and has slowly established himself as an integral part of this Arsenal side and is now one of the best right backs in the league.\n\nAndrei Arshavin\n\nIf football was merely based on statistics, then Arshavin would have been one of the favorites for Player of the Year.\n\nBut sadly the game is deeper than that. Despite scoring 10 times and providing a mind blowing 17 assists, his lazy and indifferent attitude sees him miss out on a spot.\n\nTheo Walcott\n\nArsenal’s English winger has finally started to show plenty of potential and has done a lot to silence his critics with 11 goals and 10 assists to show for his improvement this season.\n\nHe has been key for the Gunners and would have made the cut had in not been for the constant and unfortunate injuries.\n\nLaurent Koscielny\n\nHe might have got off to a torrid start but as the season progressed he came good and formed a formidable partnership with Johan Djourou.\n\nBut his poor form earlier in the season and torrid partnership with Djourou sees him miss out.\n\nWojciech Szczesny and Lukasz Fabianski\n\nThe answer to Arsenal’s goalkeeping crisis lies in the hands of these two Polish keepers who have been brilliant for the Gunners this season with Fabianski justifying Wenger’s faith in him and with Szczesny showing why all the hype has been surrounding him.\n\nBoth were extremely solid throughout the season.\n\nScott Heavey/Getty Images\n\nYes, you read it right, Arsenal’s very own, Manuel Almunia. You wouldn’t have expected him to make the cut but this season he did two things right:\n\n1) Got himself injured at the right moment which allowed the rise of Fabianski and Szczesny\n\n2) Played as least as possible and still cost Arsenal games against West Brom, not once but twice, then against Leyton Orient among other notable achievements.\n\nAlmunia’s injury was the best thing that happened to Arsenal this season as it not only saved Arsenal fans endless disappointment of seeing their goalkeeper throw away matches, it gave the two Polish keepers playing time, a move they capitalized on brilliantly.\n\nScott Heavey/Getty Images\n\nSome may object to the inclusion of Arsenal’s summer signing pointing to his recent struggles, but he did perform for the Gunners at the start of the season. He was integral in sustaining Arsenal’s title bid in the absence of Robin van Persie and Cesc Fabregas.\n\nWhen Robin van Persie became injured in August, the goal-scoring duties fell on Chamakh and the burden was increased with the injury to Danish striker, Nicklas Bendtner.\n\nBut thankfully for Arsenal, Wenger’s decision to sign Chamakh on a free transfer drew instant success and he played brilliantly for the Gunners, scoring goals, getting assists. Opposition players received four red cards as a result of fouls on him and he earned his team four penalties this season.\n\nHe scored 10 goals in all competitions until November but since then has slotted in only a solitary goal against Leyton Orient in the 5-0 thrashing in the FA Cup.\n\nHis goal-scoring streak in the earlier part of the season was a run which included goals against Wolverhampton Wanderers, Aston Villa, Tottenham Hotspurs and Bolton Wanderers. He might have struggled ever since, but considering this was his first season in the Premier League, his performances were admirable.\n\nMany of his goals were headers with Chamakh scoring against Bolton, Partizan, Blackpool, Wolves with his head, something we don’t usually see from Arsenal. His arrival meant that Arsenal now had a physical threat in the box—someone who could win the headers.\n\nChamakh’s strength lies in his fantastic heading ability but he proved that he can play with his feet as well and linked up brilliantly with the midfielders and the likes of Arshavin and Nasri.\n\nChamakh might be struggling to score but in recent weeks he has looked sharp and has had a good effect when coming on as a substitute, despite Wenger’s reluctance to start him.\n\nAlex Livesey/Getty Images\n\nOver the last few years, Robin van Persie has established himself as one of the most injury-prone players, not just in an injury ravaged Arsenal side, but also in the league.\n\nRarely does he play 30 games in a season and this means that Arsenal have to often play without their best striker for large parts of the season.\n\nThis season too he has been injured but much to the delight of Arsenal fans, lesser than previous seasons. He has already played more matches than last season and has scored more as well.\n\nThis season despite close to three months with injury, he has already outscored the likes of Anelka, Drogba and Rooney. Van Persie also contributed eight assists this season.\n\nArsenal boast one of the best attacking lineups in the league and despite that one can’t help but get the feeling that they desperately require, van Persie in their starting lineup to fire on all cylinders.\n\nWhile Marouane Chamakh maybe an able striker he is of a completely different mould of Fabregas. While he is mainly a target man, van Persie often drops into the wings or he drops deep which brings out the best in the likes of Walcott and Fabregas.\n\nHis movement and creativity increases Arsenal’s attacking prowess and immediately after his return, Arsenal’s form increased manifold as they beat the likes of Chelsea, Barcelona and began to comprehensively beat teams with van Persie at the heart of things, scoring his first hat-trick against Wigan and braces against Newcastle, West Ham and Wolves.\n\nHis influence on this team has been profound this season and that can be highlighted by the plain fact that in the league, Arsenal has never lost when van Persie has started.\n\nDavid Ramos/Getty Images\n\nArsenal is a team normally accused of having a leaky defense, but this season with the impressive return of Djourou, the Gunners have formed one of the most solid defenses in the entire league.\n\nArsenal have never lost with Djourou in the team and have conceded a mere four goals in the league.\n\nSummer signings, Laurent Koscielny and Sebastian Squillaci struggled to form a good partnership and the two of them have struggled to say the least. But when they have partnered Djourou there has been a remarkable improvement in their form, with Koscielny and Djourou forming one of the league’s most solid defenses.\n\nWith the transfers of Mikael Silvestre, Sol Campbell and William Gallas and thanks to the injury to Thomas Vermaelen, Arsenal were short on Premier League experience in the defensive department and needed a player to step up and Johan Djourou proved to be that man.\n\nHe added leadership and experience to the backline and with him in the defense, Arsenal performed admirably in defense against the likes of Manchester City, Chelsea and Barcelona.\n\nDjourou’s injury has seen Arsenal’s defense weaken immediately and Arsenal will require him to return if they are to win the league.\n\nMike Hewitt/Getty Images\n\nArsenal’s Petit Prince, considered by many to be the next Zidane has been on song this season and was easily Arsenal’s best player in the first half of the season.\n\nThe only reason he is not first is because he has not been able maintain the same level of form; but that does not mean he has been poor in any sense of the word.\n\nDespite not scoring many goals recently he still remains Arsenal’s best player and is just a goal away from getting back to top gear.\n\nIn his previous two seasons he only showed glimpses of his immense potential but it has been this season that he has performed at the top level scoring an impressive 14 goals in all competitions including a brace against Fulham, a match in which he single-handedly won the match for Arsenal.\n\nHis dribbling skills are unmatched in the Arsenal side and his quick feet and impressive footwork has seen him score many a brilliant goals this season. He scored goals against the likes of Tottenham, Aston Villa, Leeds United but most notably he scored two goals against Fulham.\n\nIn that match he showed great balance, poise and dribbling ability to score two goals for Arsenal and get them all three points.\n\nChris Brunskill/Getty Images\n\nSecondly, his attitude has been top class and has displayed the fighting characteristics that he have longed to see in this Arsenal side. The game against Barcelona at the Camp Nou showed that while his teammates have a tendency to give up and quit, he never stops trying and always gives his best shot.\n\nIt is not common to see a teenager became an integral part of the team, but Wilshere has established himself as one of Arsenal’s best players this season and has been their most consistent performer.\n\nFollowing his impressive loan spell at Bolton Wanderers, many expected him to have a breakthrough season this year—but not to this extent.\n\nWilshere has stamped his authority in the Arsenal midfield and without his drive in midfield, Arsenal would definitely not have gone this far this season.\n\nFabregas’ claim as Arsenal’s best midfielder has come in doubt thanks to the brilliant performances from the Englishman. What he lacks in experience he makes up with enthusiasm and his brilliant work rate.\n\nThis season, he has already managed to make 42 appearances in all competitions, with only Andrei Arshavin having made more and looks the favorite to clinch the PFA Young Player of the Year award and rightfully so.\n\nWilshere has scored two goals and has nine assists to his name.\n\nThe statistics hardly depict how important and effective he has been for the Gunners."
