        "text": "All information is complete to and including England's last match, the third of the 2010-11 season, against Switzerland on 7 September 2010.\n\nDiary\n\nSunday, 7 February 2010 - England will re-unite with one of their oldest rivals when they meet neighbours Wales in their UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying campaign, but they'll also face Montenegro for the very first time. ngland also take on Switzerland, who were Fabio Capello's first opponents as England manager almost two years ago to the day. The other Group G opponent will be Bulgaria.\n\nMonday, 15 March 2010 - At a meeting in ZÃ¼rich the participant countries of Group G failed to reach agreement over the fixture progamme for the Euro 2012 qualification games.\n\nThursday, 25 March 2010 - UEFA have completed the draw for the qualification process for Euro 2012 at UEFA ExCo in Israel, with England now knowing their fixture schedule in Group G. England begin with Bulgaria at home on Friday 3 September, before travelling to Switzerland four days later.\n\nSunday, 3 October 2010 - Fabio Capello has revealed that he is still unsure of picking Newcastle United youngster Andy Carroll but that Jack Wilshere features in his plans to play against Montenegro. According to Sky Sports, Capello said that he will consult with under-21 coach Stuart Pearce before deciding on Carroll, who has started the season impressively for Chris Hughton's Newcastle. Capello said, \"With Andy Carroll, I heard he has this injury. I have to speak with Stuart Pearce.\"\n\nHowever, he did confirm that 18-year-old Arsenal star Jack Wilshere will feature in his squad, although the youngster will first play for the under-21s against Romania. Capello said, \"Yes, there will be some new faces. Wilshere is one of these...He will play the first game with the Under 21s. If he is fit, he will play for the Under 21s versus Romania. After, he will be with us.\"\n\nThe England coach also said that Liverpool's Joe Cole will be in his provisional squad, but that West Ham's Robert Green is one of four goalkeepers in contention for a slot. Capello commented, \"Joe Cole will be in the provisional squad, the 34-35 players. He is one of the players I know very well, and he is playing all the games. He has a chance of making the squad. It is possible.\"\n\nThe England manager wanted to name the Emile Heskey into his squad. With Jermain Defoe, Gabriel Agbonlahor and Bobby Zamora injured, and Wayne Rooney still recovering from an ankle problem, the England management team contacted Heskey, 32, on Wednesday afternoon to ask him to come out of retirement as a one-off. He refused to make himself available. \"I saw Heskey against Wolves and he played very well and he is in a good moment,\" Capello said.\n\nAny slight hope Michael Owen might have had of adding to his 89 appearances under Capello will have been extinguished by the news that Capello would rather go back to Heskey, who announced his retirement after the World Cup.\n\nMonday, 4 October 2010 - Fabio Capello has called up uncapped Bolton striker Kevin Davies for his Euro 2012 squad. Davies, 33, is joined by Wayne Rooney, who has recovered from his ankle injury, with Darren Bent and Peter Crouch the other forwards. Also included by Capello are John Terry, Rio Ferdinand, Joe Cole, Aaron Lennon and goalkeeper Rob Green. Arsenal's Jack Wilshere has been named in both the under-21 and senior squads.\n\nIn both matcheserton's Phil Jagielka produced towering performances in central defence, lessening the impact of the absence of Ferdinand and Terry. If Jagielka keeps his place, Capello faces a tricky selection dilemma when he names his starting line-up. Davies' inclusion owes much to injuries to Tottenham striker Jermain Defore, Fulham's Bobby Zamora and Aston Villa forward Gabriel Agbonlahor while Capello has also overlooked Newcastle United's Andy Carroll who had been tipped for a call up.\n\nFriday, 8 October 2010 - Phil Jagielka has been ruled out of England's Euro 2012 qualifier against Montenegro with a hamstring injury. The 28-year-old missed a training game at Arsenal's London Colney complex on Friday after experiencing some tightness in his hamstring beforehand. He then underwent a scan which confirmed he would not be fit in time for Tuesday's match at Wembley. Gary Cahill of Bolton Wanderers has been called up as his replacement.\n\nSaturday, 9 October 2010 - Stewart Downing has been called into England's squad after Aaron Lennon suffered a back injury. Aston Villa's Downing, 26, has not played for England since March 2009. Tottenham winger Lennon missed training on Friday after reporting the problem and after further tests on Saturday morning, it was decided to send him back to his club for further treatment.\n\nSunday, 10 October 2010 - John Terry has pulled out of the England squad with a back injury. Terry is the third player to withdraw from the game. The Football Association say there will be no further call-ups. An FA statement said: \"Terry was assessed by England medical staff on Sunday and will not be fit to play any part in Tuesday's game.\" It means Manchester United's Rio Ferdinand is set to start alongside either Cahill or Manchester City's Joleon Lescott on Tuesday as Fabio Capello's side look to maintain their 100% record in qualifying.\n\nEarlier, despite Stuart Pearce trying to convince Fabio Capello otherwise, Arsenal's Jack Wilshere will link up with the senior squad instead of remaining with the Under-21 squad for their trip to Botosani, Romania, where they will defend a hard-earned 2-1 lead from Friday night's first leg, which was watched in person by the England boss."
