Ever since she appeared in the popular films Abgeschminkt (Making Up!,1993), Der bewegte Mann (Maybe...Maybe Not, 1994) and Stadtgespräch (Talk of the Town, 1995), Katja Riemann has been one of the most important actresses in Germany. She studied at the Hochschule für Musik und Theater Hannover and at the Otto Falckenberg School of the Performing Arts in Munich. In 1987 she began her theatre career as a member of the Münchner Kammerspiele's ensemble before moving to the Schillertheater Berlin. Riemann continues to be at home on the stage: the best-known productions that she's starred in over the past few years include Hedda Gabler, Anna Karenina and Drei Schwestern (all directed by Amina Gusner).

Katja Riemann's notable television and cinema productions include Ausgerechnet Sibirien (Lost in Siberia, director: Ralf Huettner, 2012), Die Fahnderin (The Investigator, director: Züli Aladağ, 2014), Die Abhandene Welt (The Misplaced World, director: Margarethe von Trotta, 2015), the film adaptation of Sarah Kuttner's Mängelexemplar (Too Hard to Handle, director: Laura Lackmann, 2016), Der Andere – Eine Familiengeschichte (The Boy Who Wants to Live, director: Feo Aladağ, 2016), and Goliath96 (director: Marcus Richardt, 2019). Riemann can also be seen in Enfant Terrible, Oskar Roehler's new feature film about Rainer Werner Fassbinder, which was part of this year's (virtual) Cannes Film Festival and will be released in autumn 2020. Riemann is also active as a musician and radio play author and producer. In 2010 she was honoured with the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany. At the Gorki Katja Riemann can be seen in Sibylle Berg's play UND SICHER IST MIT MIR DIE WELT VERSCHWUNDEN.
