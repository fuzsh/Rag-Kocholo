        "text": "...but not worth watching unless you're into chick flicks, which I am\n\nnot. I have to give Bandits credit for trying to get artistic, but really,\n\nit's a dumb movie with a dumb storyline and pretty bad acting. I\n\ndon't usually go around saying things are \"dumb,\" but I really did\n\nthink this movie was dumb. First of all, it's about 12 to 15 years\n\nlate. 1985-87 were the years to make a chick flick based on a\n\nmusical band of runaway convicts, not 1997. Secondly, there is\n\nno balance between art and reality. You've got to have some sort\n\nof realism, or good humor, if you want the audience to sympathize\n\nwith the characters. This movie lacked both. The scenes involving\n\nanger were too fake, the characters not well developed, the\n\nstoryline too unbelievable (for lack of a better word), and not only\n\ndid it drag on for too long, but what a disappointing and spiritless\n\nending! I liked the music though. I think it was too tame for the\n\nstory and not consistent with the girls' characters, especially since\n\nthe most violent girls (Luna) is the founder and singer. They\n\nneeded more umph. I gave Bandits a 6 because of the effort, but if it weren't for the\n\nphotography, colors, etc. I'd have given it a 3.\n\nThis is a refreshing and offbeat German film that keeps the viewer's interest even when the situation becomes a bit improbable. The fact that the music that these four women inmates make is likable enhances the quality of the movie, in my opinion (early on when the band does a cover, in English, of \"All Along the Watchtower,\" an obvious yet inspired choice, I decided at that point the film was going to have merit...). Also while each of the characters has a \"story,\" there isn't a lot of on screen emphasis given to their individual backgrounds per se.\n\nFor a film that offers a different twist on female convicts and somehow blends music, satire and the bonds of friendship, this is worth taking a look at.\n\nHey, this definitely is one to watch. A one of a kind \"German Females Shawshank Redemption goes Rock'n Roll.\" It was a big hit in Germany, though of course that is usually a deterrent for some odd reason. Don't let it be. If you follow video and DVD Releases, you will know it has been available for a few months now (finally) in the USA, where, I believe a movie like this would be a huge success. That is of course if it were in American English and starred Julia Roberts, instead of Katja Riemann, a big star in Germany, but of course a nobody in the US, in spite appearing in the only German movies released in the US in the past 5 years including Der Bewegte Mann - MAYBE, MAYBE NOT, and the COMEDIAN HARMONISTS. She is awesome in this role. If you like prison films, and triumph of the underdog, seemingly against all odds, run and rent this film. It is for you. As the Shawshank Redemption remains the second top-rated movie of all time here, it would follow that BANDITS should be a comparable success in the foreign film department. Additionally, it has all that female bonding which men (who usually make up over 52% of the audience) and I believe most emancipated women love to watch. See it now. You never know when these European films suddenly go out of print. In Germany, it will always be available, and is already a classic, as the previous comment indicates, and represents the majority opinion here. But no one can pinpoint why German movies are just being totally ignored since the 80s, when in fact, they have experienced a rebirth, and have become so much more accessible, so much more American, as has been the trend in almost everything in post World War II Germany. (RUN, LOLA, RUN to many is not really a movie, but a series of music videos according to many, and so can not really be called an exception.) But BANDITS is a real movie, not particularly German AT ALL. Most people will really get a kick out of it if they only gave it a shot. Watch it."
