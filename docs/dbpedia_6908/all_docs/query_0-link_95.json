Their on-the-spot perspective, particularly regarding theater in Germany, as well as Angelika’s collection of current articles and photos, kept us on track and up to date, and we are most grateful. For their personal insights into a range of topics, we would like to thank Seyhan Derin, Hans Lehmann, Klaus Meyer, Marlis Mueller, Ulrike Wittwer, and Harald Zils. For the photographs to supplement our collection, we are also indebted to Dieter Scholl and David Miller. Finally, we thank our editors at ABC-CLIO for their encouraging and constructive feedback.\n\nChronology\n\n1871\n\nAfter the Franco-Prussian War, a number of German states was united under Prussian leadership.\n\n1888\n\nKaiser Wilhelm II, grandson of Queen Victoria, came to power.\n\n1914–1918\n\nWorld War I.

The Austrian writer Elfriede Jelinek was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature.\n\n2005\n\nThe Holocaust Memorial was dedicated in Berlin. The CDU returned to power under Angela Merkel with a very narrow majority, which resulted in the first grand coalition (leftright) government in forty years. She is Germany’s first female chancellor.\n\nxiii\n\nIntroduction\n\nFlorian Illies and Constantin Gillies, two German authors with curiously similar sounding names and born in 1971 and 1970, respectively, have written books about their generation, a generation that in the United States would be classified as Generation X. Illies has entitled his books Generation Golf: Eine Inspektion (Generation Golf: An Investigation) and Generation Golf zwei (Generation Golf Two), whereas Gillies’s title is Wie wir waren: Die wilden Jahre der Web-Generation (The Way We Were. The Wild Years of the Web Generation). The www alliteration is, of course, intentional. Illies gives his readers a series of detailed snapshots of his childhood, teenage, and young adult years, beginning his first book with an image of a twelve-year-old on a typical Saturday evening. He takes his fellow Golfers (the reference is not to the game, but to the Volkswagen model that was introduced in 1974, shortly after his birth, and that gained popularity with these now thirty-plus-year-olds) on a nostalgia trip, reminding them of their favorite foods, fashions, trends, and tastes. Gillies, in contrast, focuses on his peers’ dot-com careers, how they enthusiastically embraced the brave new world of computing and the Internet, how they founded companies, conducted business by their own rules, and, sadly, floundered as they discovered that their ideals lacked practical underpinnings. Why it seemed necessary to chronicle a generation that still has to prove itself is initially unclear. As Illies was writing his first book (published in 2000), the German economy was still in good shape. The unification of the former German Democratic Republic with the Federal Republic of Germany had certainly made a dent in the smooth, comfortable way of life in the west, but most of the unemployment woes were in the east, where a certain level of adjustment had been expected. There were still adequate funds—and regulating policies—to ensure that the unemployed and those unable to work for reasons of health could be supported by a generous welfare system. But by the time Generation Golf zwei and Wie wir waren came out (both in 2003), this was no longer the\n\nxvi\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\ncase. As the new century was taking its first steps, it soon became apparent that the comfortable, secure life that generation had been born into was about to change. While Illies’s first book has a lighthearted, affectionately mocking stance toward the goals and values of his peers, the later books have a darker tone and portray their fears and disappointments, and even their follies are discussed in a critical rather than sympathetic tone. In this book, we will use this relatively sudden switch from carefree and comfortable to concerned and cautious as the prism for an examination of German popular culture since the end of World War II. It is not a grandiose attempt to trace the rise and fall of a nation as is done in studies such as Deutschland. Der Abstieg eines Superstars (Germany: The Decline of a Superstar), by Gabor Steingart. Rather, we will look at various aspects of culture and its manifestations, frivolous and otherwise. We will frequently move back in time (mainly to the early postwar years, but also to the prewar era) to examine the traditions on which German culture in the new millennium is founded, what it was that the parents passed on to their children, what each generation rebelled against, how the culture was shaped by the advent of the new technology and travel, and what people did, ate, played, wore, saw, and watched, and try to place all of this into some kind of context. The parents of these young Germans belong to a group known as the ’68ers, a name that refers to the year in which the students at German universities demonstrated against the way they were taught, the authoritarian way they had been brought up, and the political systems that were in place, which they considered to be too conservative. The ’68ers also criticized their parents’ generation—those born in the first three decades of the twentieth century—for their unwillingness both to confront the atrocities of the recent past and to distance themselves sufficiently from the fascist government of Adolf Hitler, a man they had elected to power either through active support or passive apathy. The issue of coming to terms with the past is one that surfaces again and again in many areas of everyday life and high culture in Germany, and the reader will find frequent cross-references both to this and to other topics to illustrate the interrelatedness of areas that are discussed separately. We also use such references to avoid repetition and to allow for nonlinear reading or dipping into the book for information on specific topics. Reacting against their parents, the ’68ers brought their children up with a strong antiauthoritarian bias, even offering them alternative versions of some children’s books that they had read in their own youth. The chapter on literature offers more insights into what it was that children were given to read and how these books helped to form their character. Of course, Illies’s and Gillies’s schoolmates probably preferred\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\ntelevision much of the time, and this, too, is discussed, along with film and theater. The latter might be considered high rather than popular culture to some, but in Germany, theater plays a major role in politics and city administration and as a barometer of attitudes and social change. The three eras represented by the generations—the postwar years, the time of rebellion, and the present post-unification era—will be addressed throughout the book. We present both basic current information about the various topics, including the official structures, and a historical survey. The problems of the present day—that is, the years after the turn of the millennium—cannot be understood without considering the times that preceded them. In the main text of each chapter we offer an admittedly subjective, impressionistic survey emphasizing attitudes and examples; the sections entitled “From A to Z” near the ends of the chapters offer a more objective listing of facts and definitions to serve as a reference to the topics under discussion. Therefore, the main text uses quotations, summaries from popular magazines, descriptions from local papers, and comments by individuals, not necessarily experts, to explore various topics, whereas the “From A to Z” sections, which are sometimes quite extensive and detailed, focus on facts rather than perspectives. Here we also offer references to official brochures and Web sites. Additional Readings appear at the end of each chapter, and a Bibliography can be found at the back of the book. Our goal throughout is to present a balanced mixture of raw data and impressions and attitudes.\n\nAdditional Readings Gillies, Constantin. Wie wir waren. Die wilden Jahre der Web-Generation.

Craig, the doyen of German cultural studies, “that the Germans, chronically torn and divided . . . throughout most of the modern period, seemed during the Middle Ages, and particularly between the tenth and twelfth centuries, to be politically more mature, and closer to establishing effective political institutions, than their neighbors. . . . Records dating from the tenth century speak of a regnum teutonicorum as an accomplished fact, which suggests that a recognizable national identity or self-consciousness also existed” (Craig, 1982, 16). However, this identity did not continue to develop because active commerce and the relatively early emergence of urban civilizations in the German states resulted in an increase of economic prosperity that also added “to the strength and pretensions of local princes, who were . . . restive under the domination of Imperial power” (ibid.). Today the legacy of these local princes can be seen in the number of small castles that dot the German landscape as well as in designations such as Residenzstadt (city of residence) for quite minor towns that once knew better days as seats of the local ruler. (See 1: From A to Z, “Historical overview, ancient to modern.”) The revival of the papacy from its earlier weakness and the political results of the Reformation led eventually to the dualism that has become so characteristic of German history, “the dualism between central authority and princely power, which, in the end, destroyed the former and fastened upon the realm the particularism that was to affect all aspects of German life in the modern period” (ibid., 16–17). Although one might argue that in the years since Craig wrote these words Germany has achieved some kind of central authority, a closer look reveals that each region has also retained its own characteristics and culture.

As a consequence, legal systems and many other aspects of daily experience were determined for Germans by the regions in which they lived (see 3: The Role of Religion). The region was the Lebensraum (living space) with which they identified, and to a large degree, it still is. (For detailed information on the various regions, with geographical data, see 1: From A to Z.) Yet, this regionalism has never excluded an overarching cultural identity that is essentially German. Indeed, Germany may have even profited from the lack of political centralism, as the classical dramatist Friedrich Schiller (author of the Swiss “national” play Wilhelm Tell) remarked in his later years. “No capital and no court exerted its tyranny on German taste. There are as many lands and streams and customs, as there are own inclinations and types” (quoted in de Bruyn 1991, 22). These views were shared by many intellectuals in the eighteenth century. When the poet Johann Christoph Gottsched founded his “German Society” in Leipzig, when the dramatist Gotthold Ephraim Lessing tried to establish a theater in Hamburg, which was to belong to the whole German nation, when the intellectual Justus Möser from Osnabrück saw the regional pluralism of the Germans not as something disturbing but as something fertile, and when the philosopher Johann Gottfried Herder recognized that the language, the songs, the poetry, the customs, and the traditions are the essence of a nation, it became clear that this feeling of something uniquely German, the feeling of solidarity and the sense\n\n3\n\nof a common bond, existed in spite of the political disunity (ibid., 21–22). In the early nineteenth century, Napoleon’s attempts to conquer more land for France contributed to the awakening of political nationalism all over Europe. In Germany, the new impetus was most distinctly and vividly expressed in the poem “Deutschland, Deutschland über alles” (Germany, Germany Above All [1841]) by Heinrich Hoffmann von Fallersleben, a poem later misunderstood by many (see 2: Symbols and Memorials). Hoffmann’s verses did not imply a political world dominance—as many interpreted it after 1933— but only the desire to place the idea of a unified Germany over the many independent and rivaling principalities and cities, a dream that Otto von Bismarck was only partly able to realize at the end of the nineteenth century with the creation of the second German Reich (empire). But the nation that came into being under his rule was tainted, first by the emperor, Kaiser Wilhelm II, and then, of course, by Adolf Hitler. Hitler’s Third Reich was designed to appeal to both the idea of nation and the idea of regionalism, that is, to regional history and customs as well as a united Germany that encompassed all. More than the Weimar Republic, which was founded as a confederacy of individual regions, it stressed the Gau (tribal districts). The boys and girls in the Hitler-Jugend (Hitler Youth) and Bund deutscher Mädel (Association of German Girls) learned all the traditional folksongs and dances, and traditions were exploited for nationalistic propaganda purposes. As a result, in the years following World War II, Germans had an even more difficult time coming to terms with their national identity. Not only did the more or less positive tension between centralism and regional-\n\n4\n\nP O P C U LT U R E G E R M A N Y !\n\nism continue, but now the term “nation” and national traditions were associated with and dominated by a cruel war and the Shoah (see 1: Coming to Terms with the Past; From A to Z, “Historical overview, postwar years”; “Holocaust”). The ambiguous attitude Germans have toward their own identity—Friedrich Dieckmann referred to Negatividentität (negative identity) in his study Was ist deutsch? (What Is German? 2003, 19)—can be observed frequently, particularly among the ’68ers. But times are changing, and the younger generation, including the Golf group and their younger siblings, is more positive. (See 4: Lifestyle and Fashion, for the account of a designer who is doing her bit to change this attitude.) On a larger political scale, however, this “negative identity” has been one of the driving forces behind the German effort to help create a new Europe (see 1: From Two to One). Many saw the introduction of the European passport as an emotional blessing that downplayed Germanness and stressed the membership in a larger geographical and political unit less tainted by recent history. A twist on the negative identity issue can be seen in the National Day of Mourning (Volkstrauertag, see 5: Holidays and Local Festivals). Whereas other nations commemorate their fallen soldiers, Germans remember “the victims of war and tyranny” as inscribed in Germany’s central war memorial in Berlin. On a local scale, even monuments from the 1870/1871 Franco-Prussian War can be found hidden behind shrubbery or displayed prominently depending on the various prevalent attitudes in a given era. This uneasiness with history has become so much of the German identity that even German textbooks for foreigners often in-\n\nTypical monument for the 1870/71 War. The inscription at the base of the monument reads: To the Brave Warriors 1870/1871—Our Souls to God—Our Bodies to the Enemies—Donated by the Citizens of Reinheim 1900.\n\nclude it in their culture sections. Blaue Blume (Blue Flower) (Eichheim et al. 2002) points out that before World War II, every German and Austrian village had a war memorial next to its cemetery where wreaths were laid on certain days. These memorials were demolished in both countries after 1945 because they could be interpreted as glorifying war and nationalism. In Switzerland, in contrast, a neutral country that has not been engaged in a war for 200 years, such memorials are still preserved. In this context, it should not be forgotten that most of the graves of soldiers killed in World War II are outside Germany and are tended by the War Graves Association. Today, when a former soldier is\n\nT H E G E R M A N S ’ A M B I VA L E N T AT T I T U D E\n\nburied in Germany, a brass band plays the song “Ich hatt’ einen Kameraden, einen besseren find’st du nicht” (I Had a Comrade, You Won’t Find a Better One) rather than the national anthem (ibid., 177). Yet another new twist to the age-old question of national identity was caused by the unification of the Federal Republic and the German Democratic Republic in 1990. It showed that Willy Brandt (whose goal as West German chancellor was to bring about a new relationship with the FRG’s neighbors to the east; see 1: From Two to One) was correct when he spoke of two states and one nation, making the distinction between political entities and culture. In 1989, when the GDR had just celebrated its fortieth anniversary, the slogan of protest raised by the citizens of the GDR against their dictatorial and undemocratic government, “Wir sind das Volk” (We are the people), soon changed to “Wir sind ein Volk” (We are one people) when the possibility of unification emerged. And the emotional welcome of the GDR population by the West after the fall of the Berlin Wall confirmed the feeling of one nation. There were tears, hugs, and champagne, as at a family reunion. However, once the new Germany was legalized, the wall, this time as an imaginary divide in the minds of the people, was stronger than ever, leading over the years to an Ostalgie (nostalgia for the lost east, see 1: From Two to One), which is, in effect, a new version of regionalism.\n\nComing to Terms with the Past Even after more than half a century, the shadow of Adolf Hitler has not disappeared (see Aust et al., 2004), although its impact is changing. (For a short general historical\n\n5\n\noverview, see 1: From A to Z.) Richard Lord was only partly correct when he wrote: “For most Germans, history is a mega-nightmare that they can’t simply awaken from” (Lord 2004, 40). Today, alongside the old feelings of guilt, a new sense of pride in the nation is noticeable among young Germans, as found in the German lyrics of bands such as the young Berlin group Mia (see 8: Music): “Fragt man mich jetzt, woher ich komme, tu ich mir nicht mehr selber Leid” (Now if someone asks me where I’m from, I don’t feel sorry for myself anymore). Yet, the wish to wipe out the twelve years of the Third Reich, to forget them, may have been one of the reasons that Konrad Adenauer, the first chancellor after the war, attained the stature that he did and remained pretty much unchallenged over the decades. He placed at the very top in popularity polls even as late as 2003, and, by a clear majority, he was still seen as the most important and greatest of Germans (see Knopp et al., 2003). Certainly, this selection was partly due to his willingness to continue business as usual during his term as political leader without forcing the nation to undergo a genuine reappraisal of its recent past. His was quite a different attitude from the one Theodor W. Adorno expressed in exile in New York City in 1944: “The thought that life could continue in a ‘normal’ way after this war or that even the culture could be ‘reconstructed’ again—as if reconstruction of culture were not in itself the negation of it—is idiotic. Millions of Jews have been killed, and that is supposed to be just an interlude and not the catastrophe itself. What is this culture actually still waiting for?” (quoted in Glaser 2002, 224). Pragmatism won the day. Continuity and stability characterized\n\n6\n\nP O P C U LT U R E G E R M A N Y !\n\neveryday life in the first thirty years after World War II. Most Germans simply wanted to forget and have others forget what had happened in the Nazi era. The media went along with this wish to fabricate an intact world in which the recent past had no place. The two broadcasting channels emphasized harmless entertainment, keeping to this pattern for years. Similarly, family life maintained its pattern, often reflecting the TV programs. Many households ate their supper at 8 P.M. to coincide with the nightly news, and every Saturday at about 10 P.M., water consumption would reach a peak: This was the hour at which the first segment of the evening’s entertainment ended with the drawing of the lottery numbers, giving viewers a break to go to the bathroom (Eichheim et al. 2002, 207; see also 7: Radio and Television). Political slogans of “Keine Experimente!” (No experiments), a carefully structured silence about fascist atrocities in school classrooms, and above all daily routines suppressed any unwelcome memories. And after the official Nuremberg Trials by the Allies and a few others in the 1950s and 1960s, indifference set in. In the early years (primarily in the late 1940s and 1950s), horrifying images and movies of past atrocities were shown to a few elementary and high-school children without any explanation of the context. There was little or no attempt made to explain the past atrocities or to educate the young people in their ethics, religion, and history classes about other cultures and religions in a detailed way. The opportunity to inform the new generation about Judaism and its customs and rites, holidays, and beliefs was missed, and the history curriculum always ended before reaching the years of the rise of fascism. A whole gener-\n\nation grew up without an official education about their recent past, which seemed as taboo a topic as sex. The ’68ers searched for books on their own and tried to inform themselves without teachers. Meanwhile, intellectuals suggested creating Goethegemeinden (Goethe societies) to help reinstill the most vivid examples of the German spirit, the most noble music and poetry, into the hearts of Germans (Glaser 2002, 224; see also 8: Theater and Dance). As the director of a cabaret explains to a Kriegsheimkehrer (returnee from the war) in Wolfgang Borchert’s play Draußen vor der Tür (Outside the Door, 1947): “Be positive! Positive, my dear friend! Remember Goethe! Remember Mozart! Joan of Arc, Richard Wagner, Schmeling, Shirley Temple!” And instead of undergoing a soulwrenching self-accusation and cleansing process of remorse, former Nazi officials were rapidly reintegrated into German life as fast as could be justified. The Allies followed the same pattern with Nazi scientists, integrating them into their research teams if they could advance their nuclear or missile programs, even though these very same scientists had used inmates of slave labor camps for their work (see “Concentration camps” in 1: From A to Z). If they were useful, their direct or indirect participation in the fascist system was overlooked. They were regarded as apolitical people who had only done their duty. Peter Weiss expressed this attitude explicitly in his play Die Ermittlung (The Investigation, 1965) when he had one of the accused say: We all I would like to emphasize again only did our duty even if it was often difficult for us and when we almost despaired because of it.\n\nT H E G E R M A N S ’ A M B I VA L E N T AT T I T U D E\n\nToday when our nation once again has reached a leading position we should worry about other things than about accusations which come under the statute of limitations. (Quoted in Glaser 2002, 247)\n\nOne could not expect everyone to become a hero like Paul Schneider, a priest who defended his Christian faith of brotherly love until his death in a concentration camp. Sixty years later, he is as forgotten as he was in the years after the war—at least in the general consciousness. Few resistance fighters and antifascists have experienced later fame or even recognition. An exception are the brother and sister Hans and Sophie Scholl, who were at the core of a student resistance movement, called “Die Weiße Rose” (The White Rose), in 1942/ 1943, and Claus Graf Schenk von Stauffenberg, who attempted to assassinate Hitler in 1944. They were voted among the top 100 greatest Germans in 2003. In East Germany, the Nazi past was equated with capitalism, and the persecution of Communists by Nazis was emphasized. The new socialist GDR government abolished capitalism and stressed the fact that Communists were among the first inmates of concentration camps, thereby absolving itself of any responsibility for the Nazi era. West Germany had no such explanation, and its government had to accept the burden of the past. The FRG’s relative silence about the fascist era during most of the first two decades after the war was an unpleasant stain on the fabric of the young democracy, though it was occasionally interrupted by official ceremonies and speeches that contained just enough an-\n\n7\n\ntifascistic rhetoric to satisfy any critic. In 1967, the psychologists Alexander and Margarete Mitscherlich analyzed the situation in hindsight in their book Unfähigkeit zu trauern (Inability to Mourn), stating that the German ability to avoid facing the past provided the foundation for the materialistic expansion that followed. The economic miracle (see 10: Consumer Culture versus Green Awareness) was possible only because of this pragmatic attitude. The loss of the historical conscience freed the nation from self-destruction, and the twelve years under Hitler could be interpreted as an aberration. In his Kleine Kulturgeschichte Deutschlands im 20. Jahrhundert (Brief Cultural History of Germany in the 20th Century, 2002, 245), Hermann Glaser enumerated the most obvious shortcomings of the era, which were foreshadowed in the East German film Die Mörder sind unter uns (The Murderers Are Among Us, 1946; see 7: Film). There was Adenauer’s close associate Hans Globke, who was a former legal commentator of the Nuremberg race laws of 1935. There was the banker Hermann Abs, who sat on many executive boards during the Nazi years as well as in the years after the war. In his influential positions, he had helped the Hitler regime in the Arisierung (literally Aryanization, the transferral of ownership from Jews to Germans) of banks and firms. In the postwar West German democracy, he became one of the financial advisers to the new government. There was Theodor Oberländer, who had been a member of the NSDAP (Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei, National Socialist German Workers’ Party) since 1933 and had held important positions in the party. From 1953 to 1960, he was minister for refugees and exiles under\n\n8\n\nP O P C U LT U R E G E R M A N Y !\n\nAdenauer until a public outcry over his past forced him to resign. There were only a few lawyers who survived with a clean slate, such as Fritz Bauer, who initiated the Auschwitz trials in 1965 (Wojak 2004, 814– 830), and Martin Hirsch, member of parliament. But not one judge or prosecutor was sentenced under Adenauer because of judicial crimes committed during the Third Reich, although as many as 40,000 sentences of capital punishment may have been given to Volksschädlinge (enemies of the state) during the Hitler era. In 1951, a law was passed that guaranteed employment to almost all Nazi bureaucrats as well as compensation for their period of unemployment. Compensation for Zwangsarbeiter (slave workers), in contrast, was not regulated until the year 2000, when a bill established a foundation called Erinnerung, Verantwortung und Zukunft (Remembrance, Responsibility and Future). Finally, the various German firms involved were persuaded to contribute their share after long and cumbersome negotiations. Most of them had profited from the Hitler era and were bouncing back from their near-destruction in the postwar years, but they saw little connection between their present status and their past. Not until 1958 did the ministers of justice of the individual German states establish a Zentrale Stelle der Landesjustizverwaltung zur Aufklärung nationalsozialistischer Verbrechen (Central Agency of the State Judicial Administration for the Investigation of National Socialist Crimes). But in spite of extensive investigations by its director, the resulting legal proceedings were minimal. In 1984, the newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung took stock and remarked: “In spite of information stored in Ludwigsburg on more than 1.3 million index cards that\n\nwere systematically evaluated, in spite of 4,802 pre-1958 and 13,000 preliminary proceedings since 1958—the final balance must be unbearable to all those victims who have survived Auschwitz or Majdanek, Theresienstadt or Treblinka. Out of 88,587 persons who had been accused of Nazi crimes by January 1, 1983, only 6,465 had been sentenced, 12 for capital punishment, 158 for a lifelong sentence, 80,355 were found not guilty and for 1,767 accused, the trial is still pending; but there is little expectation of further severe sentences” (quoted in Glaser 2002, 246; see also for general reference, Werle and Wandres 1995). In 1987, Ralph Giordano spoke of a second guilt: the suppression and minimization of the Nazi crimes. Even now, the discussion on this topic has not been laid to rest, and many events, both small and large, have fueled the debate. In 1985, commemorating the fortieth anniversary of the end of the war, Richard von Weizsäcker, as president of the Federal Republic, made a point of stating that Germany had not lost a war but had been liberated from a terror regime. But there was also the Historiker Streit (Historians’ Debate), a series of essays in prominent newspapers in 1986/1987 about the possibility of comparing Stalin’s and Hitler’s atrocities and thereby negating the uniqueness of the inhumanity of the Holocaust. Such academic arguments were seen by many as indications that a genuine understanding of the past was still lacking. “Vergangenheit, die nicht vergehen will” (The Past which Will not Pass Away), the title of the first article that began the Historians’ Debate, seemed indicative of an attitude among many Germans that favored continuing the suppression of the topic, implying that there already had been too\n\nT H E G E R M A N S ’ A M B I VA L E N T AT T I T U D E\n\nmuch emphasis placed on these years and that the emphasis ought to stop. It was argued that the past should not influence the current politics of the new Germany. This opinion also seemed to be at the core of a speech delivered by the writer Martin Walser when he received the Friedenspreis des deutschen Buchhandels (Peace Prize of the German Book Trade) in 1998. At least many understood him that way when he stated that the Holocaust should not be used as a political tool. Ignatz Bubis, president of the Zentralrat der Juden in Deutschland (Central Committee of Jews in Germany), left the room after Walser’s remarks, which he regarded as a “geistige Brandstiftung” (intellectual arson). These controversies were full of complex nuances and only showed the difficulty Germans have had in coming to terms with their past; the anti-Israeli pamphlets distributed in 2002 by Jürgen Möllemann, a member of the Freie Demokratische Partei (FDP, the German liberals), were much more blatant and shocking in their attempt to cater to German right-wing voters. In the early 1980s, Peter Sichrovsky, born in 1947 of Jewish parents who had emigrated to England during the war, sought to gauge the attitudes of Jews living in Germany and Austria forty years after the camps had been liberated. He published his findings in a set of narratives, or Protokolle, using a genre that had been developed in the German Democratic Republic as a cross between investigative journalism and literary writing. (In the GDR, Protokolle were often controversial, and authors often had difficulties finding publishers who dared to print them.) The somewhat cumbersome title of his book, published in 1985, would translate as We Don’t Know What Tomorrow Will Bring, We Know Well\n\n9\n\nWhat Yesterday Was: Young Jews in Germany and Austria. Sichrovsky interviewed a number of people and wrote their responses (without including his questions) in the form of reflective autobiographical statements. Among those who were willing to talk about their status were Jews who had lived in Israel and chosen to return to Germany, married couples with different perspectives on the situation, and children of camp survivors who were angry about their parents’ submissive attitude. In a later book, Born Guilty: Children from Nazi Families (1987), Sichrovsky gathered statements from people whose parents had been supporters of the Nazi regime, asking them how this had affected their lives. One suffered from the burden of inherited guilt and wished to seek atonement for the sins of the fathers. Another Protokoll is given in the form of a dialogue in which a daughter defends her officer father against criticism from her dropout brother. In this case, the reader’s sympathies tend to gravitate toward the daughter as she points out how well her father treated his family, in contrast to the son, who appears to take pleasure in shocking the bourgeois family but has no scruples about living off those whom he despises. Nevertheless, in many communities the 1990s were also a time when ways of remembrance were discussed and ways found to take at least a first step. St. Georgen, once a farming village in Baden-Württemberg and today a suburb of the city of Freiburg, though it retains a village character, is a good example. Its local newspapers provide insights into everyday life, how customs are retained, revived, or modified, and how German culture is evolving in the twenty-first century. They also report about St. Georgen’s dark side, a side some\n\n10\n\nP O P C U LT U R E G E R M A N Y !\n\nmight wish to forget. During the Nazi era, the village was the location of a factory that made sacks and used forced labor from countries that had been invaded by Hitler’s regime. Fortunately, this cloud has developed a rather special silver lining. In May 2004, one of these Zwangsarbeiter (forced laborers) returned to Freiburg for a reunion with others from the Ukraine, Slovenia, and France as guests of the mayor to unveil a memorial at the site of the camp where most of them had lived while working at the factory. Andrés Dirk Kylstra from Groningen, Netherlands, pointed out at the reunion that he was one of the luckier ones. Not only did he have the good fortune to live with a local family rather than in the camp, he was befriended by someone who made sure that he got to attend theater and concert performances. He also met his future wife in Freiburg. Later, Kylstra became a professor of older German literature in Groningen. He also suffered in his native Netherlands, however, in the early postwar years, when there was still animosity toward Germans. His mother was not happy about his marriage to a German woman, and for a long time being a professor of German literature aroused suspicion about loyalty to his home country. His fellow forced laborers from Eastern Europe also suffered when they returned home if they were suspected of having collaborated with the Nazis (Der Sonntag, May 9, 2004, 8). One way in which the city of Freiburg—a city that had a Jewish population of around 1,400 in 1933 and was declared “free of Jews” ten years later—is dealing with its Nazi past is by literally tripping up its citizens as they walk the city streets. The Cologne artist Gunter Demnig came up with the idea of Stolpersteine (literally,\n\ntripping stones), small cobblestones about 4 inches (10 cm) long that have a brass plate fitted into them that is engraved with the name and birth and death dates of individuals who suffered at the hands of the Nazis—Jews, Sinti and Roma gypsies, political enemies of the state, freemasons, and homosexuals. The stones are imbedded in sidewalks outside of houses the citizens are known to have lived in up to their deportation or flight. Demnig’s idea gives the victims of the Nazi persecution a name and address and forces present-day citizens to confront the past and perhaps recall neighbors who suddenly moved away. In Freiburg, the decision to adopt Demnig’s idea was made in December 2002, and the first stone was set in the Goethestraße (Goethe Street) outside the guest house of the university. It commemorates a professor of law (Robert Liefmann) who was deported with his two sisters, Else and Martha, and taken to Gurs, a camp in the French Pyrenees. He died there in 1941. In memory of that camp, there is a road sign in downtown Freiburg that looks like any\n\nExample of a Stolperstein. Inscription reads: Here lived/Kurt Adler/ Born 1918/Deported 1940/Dead on 26 January 1941 in /Gurs (The usual abbreviation for “died” was not used.)\n\nT H E G E R M A N S ’ A M B I VA L E N T AT T I T U D E\n\nThe Gurs Memorial is both the road sign to the location and the plaque in the foreground providing information. (The monument in the background is to a local dignitary, Carl von Rotteck.)\n\nother but points to Gurs and bears a small plaque explaining its meaning. As of May 2004, 170 additional Stolpersteine had been set in the sidewalks, all based on verified information, but there is a long waiting list of names and addresses deserving similar recognition. The city’s coordinator for the program notices that many passersby avoid stepping on the stones, but she hopes to correct this. The brass plates need physical contact to make them shine and stand out to other passersby. If they are avoided or ignored, they will become dull and no longer stand out from their surroundings to catch the at-\n\n11\n\ntention of those who may not be aware of their hometown’s involvement in the Nazi regime. The project is funded through private support with donations of 95 euros per stone, and has a Web site (www.freiburgim-netz.de/stolpersteine) where one can check the location of the stones and the history behind those that have been laid thus far (Amtsblatt, April 30, 2004, 3). On the one hand, guilt and shame are part of the German character; on the other, a new self-assuredness has reaffirmed itself in politicians such as former Chancellor Gerhard Schröder, Chancellor Angela Merkel, and President Horst Köhler, who were born at the end of the war or even after it. Symptomatic of the new attitude was the Deutschland Kampagne (Germany Campaign): Du bist Deutschland (You are Germany) that tried to instill pride and confidence into German citizens. In pop culture, representatives of this attitude may be seen in the group Virginia Jetzt! which proclaimed: “Das ist mein Land, meine Menschen” (This is my country, these are my people) (quoted in Aust 2005, 195). Germans remain ambivalent about the topic of remembering and forgetting, however, something Ernestine Schlant addressed well in her study The Language of Silence: West German Literature and the Holocaust: Germans—sometimes more than the citizens of other countries—have tried to address the Holocaust. They have done so not always convincingly, and they have been ambivalent and conflicted about their motives and their efforts. For half a century, literature has reflected these tortured, convoluted, even brazen and self-saving struggles and has fashioned many languages of silence to cope with the knowledge and the legacy of the atroci-\n\n12\n\nP O P C U LT U R E G E R M A N Y !\n\nties committed. While the private silences have become public debates, literature has begun to chart new areas. It has begun to express sorrow and mourning, and has started to acknowledge and include the Jewish presence in Germany. One should expect that as the seismograph of unconsciously held values German literature will persevere in its search for new articulations in its continuing efforts to come to terms with the Holocaust. (Schlant 1999, 243–244)\n\nFrom Two to One In 1945, before there were two Germanys, there was only one defeated and destroyed nation, physically and psychologically damaged, the Stunde Null (zero hour), as it was called by some historians. For most Germans at the time, it did not feel as if Germany had been liberated from an evil dictator by the Allies, but rather that they were regarded as a ferocious enemy and occupied in order to be subdued. According to the Berliner Erklärung (Berlin Declaration) by the victorious powers on June 5, 1945, Germany had to accept any and all demands that would be imposed then and in the future. All aspects of life, all governmental structures, down to the level of the community, were in the hands of the Allies. In Berlin, the Alliierter Kontrollrat (Allied Control Council) was in charge of all affairs in regard to Germany as a whole. The four supreme commanders were to make all decisions unanimously and then translate them into action at their discretion in the zones that they occupied. That was the theory, but their interests were too divergent and, in practice, each one of the four used the given discretion quite broadly in the respective zones.\n\nOwing to the main difference between the occupying powers, which was in regard to the question of the reparations that Germany was to pay (the USSR was interested in large payments, whereas the West was more interested in getting the German economy working again), Germany was divided into two spheres of influence. Stalin emphasized again and again his support of a unified Germany (also driven by his desire to get his share of the future wealth of the Ruhrgebiet, the main industrial region in Germany), but at the same time he consolidated his hold on the eastern part of Germany, restructuring the whole region politically following the Soviet model. When the United States feared in 1947 that Stalin’s intent was expansionistic, its answer was to join the American and British zones into one economic unit and to begin the European Recovery Program, the Marshall Plan, which was accepted by the Western powers but rejected by the East. The currency reform in 1948 led systematically in 1949 to the creation of the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG) and the German Democratic Republic (GDR). In the West German Bundestag (lower house of parliament), Konrad Adenauer, leader of the Christlich Demokratische Union (Christian Democratic Union, CDU), was chosen as the first chancellor by only one vote over Kurt Schumacher, the leader of the Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands (Social Democratic Party of Germany, SPD). The first election for the Volkskammer, the East German parliament, resulted in an overwhelming victory for the Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands (Socialist Unity Party of Germany, SED). Both Germanys were organized into Länder (states) (see 3: The Political System). In 1952, the government of the Ger-\n\nT H E G E R M A N S ’ A M B I VA L E N T AT T I T U D E\n\nRegions of the GDR. Source: Introducing the GDR. Berlin: Panorama DDR, 1978:22\n\nman Democratic Republic decided to restructure into fourteen districts (in 1961, Berlin became the fifteenth district) in order to adjust the state structure to the new economic necessities, to strengthen the central authority, and to widen the influence of socialist democracy. The Länder of the FRG were: Baden-Württemberg, Bayern, Berlin (special status), Bremen, Hamburg, Hessen, Niedersachsen, NordrheinWestfalen, Rheinland-Pfalz, Saarland, and Schleswig-Holstein. The districts of the GDR were: Berlin, Cottbus, Dresden, Erfurt, Frankfurt/Oder, Gera, Halle, KarlMarx-Stadt (formerly and now Chemnitz), Leipzig, Magdeburg, Neubrandenburg, Potsdam, Rostock, Schwerin, and Suhl. In the following years, the FRG did not officially recognize the existence of a sec-\n\n13\n\nond, Communist, Germany. West Germany’s constitution regarded the division of Germany as temporary and saw the citizens of the GDR legally as citizens of the FRG. Therefore, they called the GDR the Sowjetisch Besetzte Zone (Soviet Occupation Zone, SBZ), or the “so-called GDR,” in a policy formulated in 1955, the year of Germany’s official return from an occupied territory to a sovereign state. Known as the Hallstein-Doktrin (Hallstein policy, named after the undersecretary of state, Walter Hallstein), it allowed all GDR refugees to the West to automatically receive a West German passport along with a small amount of financial startup support when they arrived. The Hallstein policy stressed that the Federal Republic alone had the right to represent Germany on the world stage and threatened to break off diplomatic relations with states that recognized the GDR (Müller 1986, 354). The West German constitution was called the Grundgesetz (Basic Law), not the Verfassung (constitution), and Bonn was always regarded as a temporary capital (provisorische Hauptstadt). The preamble of the Basic Law, passed in 1949, stated that the population of the three western occupation zones also acted for those Germans who were not permitted to be involved. All German people were called upon “to complete the unity and freedom of Germany in free self-determination” (ibid., 332; for excerpts of the Grundgesetz, see Thiele 2004, 646–655). The constitution of the Deutsche Demokratische Republik (DDR, in English GDR) changed over the years. In 1968, the GDR still saw itself as a “socialist state of German nationhood” and its mandate as overcoming the division of Germany caused by imperialism; the constitution of 1974 avoided such references to\n\n14\n\nP O P C U LT U R E G E R M A N Y !\n\nLeft to right, Walter Hallstein (after whom the Hallstein-Doktrin was named), Chancellor Konrad Adenauer, Herbert von Blankenhorn (head of the political department in the office for foreign affairs) in 1954. (Bettmann/Corbis)\n\na German nation, and the republic defined itself only as “a socialist state of workers and farmers” (Armbruster 1981, 17). The desire for unity was stressed on both sides, although only in political matters, and over the years the strength of the desire waxed and waned. It was not nurtured in the new generation, perhaps because both Germanys feared a nationalistic revival. As a result, even geographical knowledge of the other Germany was minimal in the youth growing up in their respective states. Maps in schoolbooks focused on the territories of the republic in which the book was published. The “other” Germany was Ausland (a foreign country), and maps produced in the GDR went so far as to have merely a blank space beyond the western borders.\n\nWhereas East Germany was ravaged by the Soviets and had a difficult time building up its economy, West Germans enjoyed the results of the Wirtschaftswunder (economic miracle) based on U.S. help. West Berlin was kept artificially alive through its lifeline to the West. Even the Berlin blockade by the USSR in 1948 was not able to stop the support of this island within its territory. The importance of Berlin was demonstrated not only by the Luftbrücke (airlift) but also by the Notopfer Berlin (literally, sacrifice for Berlin in need), a special tax and a 2-pfennig stamp for every letter mailed inside Germany, starting in 1949 and lasting until 1956. Berlin was not only an island of Western influence in the middle of communism but also a billboard advertising the wonderful\n\nT H E G E R M A N S ’ A M B I VA L E N T AT T I T U D E\n\nworld of capitalism, especially through its Kaufhaus des Westens (KaDeWe), the largest department store on the European continent. Like Harrod’s in London, its major rival in terms of size, KaDeWe had a magnificent food hall with a dazzling array of meats, cheeses, breads, pastries, vegetables, and chocolate, much of it available for the shopper to sample. The contrast with the limited range of foods available in the eastern part of the city was striking, and intentionally so. Just as West Germans looked longingly to the colorful, wealthy world they imagined in the United States, East Germans were fascinated by West Germany. And many came and stayed. Some 200,000 arrived in 1952, and 300,000 in 1953. The numbers did not diminish much after the Soviets demonstrated their ruthlessness in suppressing the riots by East German workers on June 17, 1953, sending tanks against people armed with a handful of pebbles. To stop the “brain drain” and not be faced suddenly with a state that had a government but no people, GDR bureaucrats decided to fortify their borders, to construct fences, and, in 1961, to close the last hole still existing on the border—to build, in Berlin, a 45-km-long wall with barbed wire and post armed guards along it. They called it the antifaschistischer Schutzwall (protective wall against fascist aggression). On the border between the eastern and western sectors, a so-called “death strip” was constructed from the Baltic to the border of what was then Czechoslovakia, a barren strip of land fenced with barbed wire on either side and planted only with landmines. Here too, border guards were posted in towers at intervals to watch for those trying to cross illegally. This was not so easy from the east,\n\n15\n\nMain entrance of Kaufhaus des Westens (commonly abbreviated KaDeWe).\n\nsince there was also limited access to the area just east of the border, and coastal areas of the Baltic were also put out of reach. One positive result of this is that Germans from both regions now enjoy some pristine beaches and countryside that remained undeveloped for many years. All of these measures to strengthen the border seemed like the final step to an everlasting separation between the Germanys. And in 1968, the GDR gave itself a new constitution in which the socialist aspect of the state was emphasized, although it still saw itself as part of a German nation. In 1970, Willi Stoph, the prime minister of the GDR, continued the policy of socialist self-identification and of the separation of the two Germanys, claiming, “Today the socialist German Democratic Republic and the monopolistic capitalist Federal Republic exist as two separate independent states. Their citizens live and work under conditions completely opposed to one another. . . . In reality, the two sovereign states, GDR and FRG, cannot be united,\n\n16\n\nP O P C U LT U R E G E R M A N Y !\n\nbecause social orders contrary to one another cannot be united.” But Willy Brandt, the architect of the new Ostpolitik in 1970, did not give up hope. He stated: “The concept of the nation forms the link that binds divided Germany together. Nation means more than just a common language and culture, more than a state and social order. The nation has its foundations in the ongoing sense of belonging together among the people. Nobody can deny that there is and there will be in this sense a German nation.” In 1972, the Hallstein policy was officially abolished and a treaty signed that affirmed the inviolability of the border between the two Germanys, as well as the fact that neither has the right to act in the other’s name in its internal or external affairs. This treaty opened a new chapter in the relationship between the GDR and the FRG. The Berlin Wall lasted for a total of twenty-eight years. But then, in 1989, the year of the GDR’s fortieth anniversary, the wall collapsed after another mass exodus of GDR citizens. This time they left their country not across the border from East to West Berlin but from East to West Berlin via Czechoslovakia and Hungary, the neighboring Communist states, which refused to serve as border guards for the GDR. The chief editor of the November 1989 issue of the GDR Review, published as the November/December issue a few weeks late owing to the upheaval in the GDR, wrote in his last editorial preface, “Speaking on Our Own Behalf”:\n\nwith most people in our country, we are struggling night and day for answers, explanations, admissions or rejections of guilt. What seemed valid yesterday is what we ourselves put in question today. I ask you, the reader, for your understanding in this respect. . . . We, who have described to you the GDR in word and picture for years and in some cases decades, are now faced with the painful question: Have we deceived you, our readers, our friends, those who have placed their hopes for socialism specifically in our country, have we wilfully spread lies? For myself and my journalist colleagues I can and must reply with a clear conscience and a straight answer: No. But . . . [within] the scope given to us we painted a picture of the GDR which did not encompass all aspects of the reality. New homes at low rents?—Yes, for millions of people, above all from the working class. But also the increasing dilapidation of buildings, particularly in the old town centres of which only a few have been restored. And therefore people continue to live under poor conditions. No unemployment?—Yes, but at the same time weeks and months when working time has not been used to capacity in many enterprises, because the materials for production were not there, because fossilised economic structures prevented a feasible and necessary increase in work efficiency. Participation from workers and employees in decision making?—What is the use of attested rights when bureaucratic, ossified and outdated leadership would recognise only\n\nDear readers of GDR REVIEW and friends of the GDR in many countries!\n\nwhat it wanted to hear?

Along\n\nstated issues and many, many more.\n\nT H E G E R M A N S ’ A M B I VA L E N T AT T I T U D E\n\nThe upheaval in the GDR was a completely unexpected turn of events. Just a few weeks before the events of November 9, 1989, Erich Honecker, the leader of the GDR, had given a speech in front of the wall that supposedly stood for his state’s invincibility and proclaimed that it would stand for another century. He had underestimated the desire for reform that Mikhail Gorbachev had encouraged and also ignored the warning Gorbachev had given him during his state visit for the fortieth anniversary of the GDR: “Those who do not change with the times, will be punished by life.” The citizens who did not leave began to demonstrate. The most famous protests were the so-called Monday night demonstrations in Leipzig, when the chant “Wir sind das Volk!” (We are the people) resounded through the city and beyond. The question arose as to whether the GDR government should use force to subdue the protests, but there was no support for such an action by the Soviet Union. GDR officials realized that Honecker’s time was over. The new reality was Gorbachev’s perestroika (restructuring), and Egon Krenz replaced the outgoing Honecker. Krenz promised change. On the evening of November 9, 1989, the guards at the Berlin Wall apparently had been instructed to open the gates, and the rumor spread quickly. Within hours, thousands of people crossed the border. The Berlin Wall had fallen. After decades apart, families were united. Tears of joy flowed as well as champagne. The slogan “Wir sind das Volk” had changed to “Wir sind ein Volk.” At the highest level of government, changes continued. Egon Krenz was replaced by Hans Modrow, the mayor of Dresden, who was seen by many as one of\n\n17\n\nthe leading reformers. Arrangements were made for the first free elections, which took place in March 1990. The eastern branch of the CDU scored a victory, replacing the SED as the largest single party. (The fact that bananas and oranges, something of a scarce luxury in the past, were suddenly being sold in eastern Germany, along with exotic looking products from the West, no doubt influenced many of the voters.) With amazing speed, driven by the fear that the window of opportunity might close again, the two Germanys moved toward unification. And on October 3, 1990, the forty-one-year-old division of Germany came to an end. It was not a true reunification but an expansion of the German Federal Republic of Germany: the addition of five new Länder. Many historians (and politicians), therefore, prefer the term ‘unification’ to ‘reunification.’ Unfortunately, the politicians missed their chance to create the same sense of responsibility toward their fellow GDR citizens that they had once been able to muster for the Berlin citizens when they had established the Notopfer Berlin. Was the reason for this the timing, the fact that back then, in the early 1950s, people were still familiar with hunger pangs? Now in the 1990s, hunger was something suffered only far away in the Third World. Was it that the West Germans regarded the newcomers as a different kind of guest worker after the two states had officially recognized each other as the result of Willy Brandt’s Ostpolitik? Or was it the fear that if they stressed the emotional aspect of the one people too much, a new nationalism would awaken? In any case, the spirit of the early postwar years had vanished. There was little talk of a new Verfassungsversammlung (constitutional committee)\n\n18\n\nP O P C U LT U R E G E R M A N Y !\n\nto work out a new joint Verfassung (constitution). The new Germany was not really to be a “new Germany” but only a larger West Germany. And the expansion happened fast: On November 9, 1989, the border opened; on July 1, 1990, the currency union became official (the GDR was given the deutsche mark); on October 3, 1990, the GDR was politically integrated into the FRG; and on June 20, 1991, the decision was made to select Berlin as the capital of the new Germany, now called the Berliner Republik. Was it because of this purely political solution to an emotional question that the wall did not completely disappear, but instead was reerected in the minds of the people? There were the Wessis (westerners) on one side and the Ossis (easterners) on the other. One group (Wessis) felt superior, the other (Ossis) resentful because they had definitely been on the wrong side in this struggle. They were also the poorer cousins. Their run-down factories could not be compared with the world-class equipment of the other Germany. But they had worked hard under much worse conditions and they had built up a state that was a leading economic power in the environment they had lived in before unification came. They also could boast of some social and educational achievements. There were many ideas that might have proven beneficial to the West. Since unification, many have left East Germany. The population has dropped by about 10 percent. According to Richard Lord, “In certain cities, the decline has been even more dramatic. For instance, the former heavy industrial bastion of Hoyerswerda saw its population plunge from roughly 75,000 to 45,000 in the 13 years following unification” (Lord 2004, 76). But\n\nmany of these relocated Germans have not adjusted to the West. They feel a loss of a certain human dimension. They miss camaraderie, the willingness to accept others on their own terms. After more than a decade, the division is still present in almost all aspects of life, as a detailed survey from 2004 in the magazine Stern proved. A chart reflecting the satisfaction people feel in regard to their home towns showed the dividing line as the old border between east and west. On the left of the map (the west), a green color indicating high to very high satisfaction was dominant; on the right (the east), yellow, orange, and even red were prevalent, where red meant deep dissatisfaction. On the next chart, which showed the degree of anxiety people had over losing their jobs, the division was very similar: low anxiety in the west, high anxiety (almost 60 percent) in the east. Not surprisingly, the same color distribution was also found in answers to the question about the social net: Should the individual or the state be in charge? The majority of the citizens of the new German states regard the state as the caretaker. On other questions, some regions in the west concur with regions in the east and vice versa. But the difference in opinion between west and east is always more pronounced than the north-south comparison. No wonder that “Ostalgie” (an obvious word play on nostalgia) is so popular and has become an entertainment hit at the turn of the millennium. TV shows and films such as Goodbye Lenin have been boxoffice hits (see 7: Film). In March 2004, the New York Times offered readers of its Styles section a lighthearted perspective on recent German history in connection with a theater hit. The play in question was “I Am My Own Wife” by Doug Wright,\n\nT H E G E R M A N S ’ A M B I VA L E N T AT T I T U D E\n\nabout the transsexual Charlotte von Mahlsdorf, but the focus of the article was the toy model Trabant cars that Wright had bought in 1994 when in Berlin conducting research for the film. These little toy Trabis are described as one of the souvenirs available in the category of “East German relics,” along with fragments of the Berlin Wall, Stasi uniforms and ID badges, and snow globes with zero visibility. The sixinch Trabis appealed to Wright as being the one “benign” memento among the “ominous” ones. He described the car as “the little comically inept Trabi that never ran.” To one who recalls sitting with knees pressed against her chest in the back seat of one and smelling the fumes of many others puttering around, the image of them not running is distorted. They ran, but with attendant noise and polluting gases. The New York Times journalist David Colman talked of a more widespread urge to “paint over East Germany’s blacker past with a drab coat of Trabi beige” and see the Trabi as “a dryly humorous stand-in for a reality many prefer to forget.” He noted that production for the Trabi and its “two-stroke, smokebelching engine” began in 1957 and that the basic model, the Trabi 601, went relatively unchanged until the car went off production in 1991. Nevertheless, there was a waiting list for the Trabis of up to ten years at times. Today the souvenir toy models are sold on e-Bay, reportedly fetching $15 apiece in March 2004. Colman remarked that “It’s strange to see the Trabi aligned with reunification rather than Communism, but all’s fair in memory and marketing” (New York Times, March 14, 2004). In the years before the Berlin Wall fell, those in the West, with access to a wide range of consumer goods, would send care packages to their less favored friends and\n\n19\n\nrelatives in the former German Democratic Republic, but it would seem that the situation has been reversed fifteen years later. A report in the online newsletter of the magazine Brigitte on November 22, 2004, with the heading “Ost-Päckchen” (East Packages), lists products that were well known in the GDR that are now available again for those who hanker after the good old days. Perhaps it is the popularity of recent films such as Sonnenallee and Goodbye Lenin that has made Germans from eastern and western states long for such products as Knusperflocken, a chocolate bar made of milk chocolate and crisp bread, or toothpaste with the cute name of Putzi. The signs that pedestrians followed when crossing the street—a little red man with a hat standing at attention, his feet together and arms outstretched, which commanded citizens to wait on the curb; and his complementary green man striding along, which encouraged those same citizens to cross the road (see 2: Symbols and Memo-\n\nEast German pedestrian traffic lights.\n\n20\n\nP O P C U LT U R E G E R M A N Y !\n\nrials), have long been favorites on postcards and T-shirts. They, too, are available online. Of course, all the talk about Ostalgie has a negative side to it as well and may easily lead to a falsification and belittlement of a dictatorial regime that was responsible for murders and the incarceration of political opponents, whose suffering could easily be forgotten in such a rosy portrait of the former GDR (see Osang 2003, 212–222, and Haußmann 2003, 221).\n\nFrom A to Z Canals for shipping: The longest one in Germany is the Mittellandkanal in central Germany (321 km), followed by the Dortmund-Ems Canal (269 km), the MainDanube Canal (171 km), and the North Sea–Baltic Sea Canal (99 km). Checkpoint Charlie: The Western Allies could not prevent the building of the Berlin Wall, but they could ensure at least access to East Berlin based on postwar treaties through the world-famous border control, Checkpoint Charlie (see www.mauermuseum.com). Haus am Checkpoint Charlie, a museum located in the last building before the wall, was established in 1963 and has been constantly expanded since then. Its exhibits are devoted to the theme of freedom and document the many escape attempts of GDR citizens. In 2005, the museum was in the headlines because of an argument between the city and the director of the museum over the maintenance of the display of the crosses for victims killed at the wall.\n\nClimate: Germany has a moderate climate without extreme cold or hot periods. The northwest has a lot of rain, the southwest is known for its sunshine (Freiburg, Kaiserstuhl). Eastern Germany has a typical continental climate. Especially mild is the island of Mainau on Lake Constance, where palm trees, orchids, and citrus trees grow as well as other subtropical plants. Concentration and extermination camps: Not all concentration and extermination camps were built outside German territory. Many were in everyone’s view, even in the centers of German culture. Weimar was not only the cultural capital of Germany, as it has been proclaimed again today—the center of the German classic era and enlightenment, the place where Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and Friedrich Schiller lived and wrote—but also, during the 1930s, a conservative stronghold. In 1925, the progressive leaders of the Bauhaus school (see 9: Visual Arts; From A to Z) had to leave and move to Dessau. After his electoral victories, Hitler was welcomed with great enthusiasm. In 1937, Buchenwald, one of the largest concentration camps, was established about 5 miles northwest of Weimar. One of Buchenwald’s subcamps was Dora-Mittelbau (also known as DoraNordhausen or Nordhausen) in the Harz Mountains, in legend famous for Walpurga’s Eve (see “Tourist Attractions/places of myths and legends,” below). It was the horror place where Wernher von Braun (the later “father” of the U.S. moon landing, who was chosen in 2003 as one of the top 100 most important Germans) helped to develop the V2 rocket (V for Vergeltung, vengeance) built by forced laborers. One account reported: “Until the spring of 1944,\n\nT H E G E R M A N S ’ A M B I VA L E N T AT T I T U D E\n\nprisoners were kept mostly underground, deprived of daylight and fresh air, and enclosed in unstable tunnels. The mortality rate was higher than at most other concentration camps. Prisoners too weak or ill to work were sent to Auschwitz-Birkenau or Mauthausen to be killed” (Holocaust Atlas, 162). One of the very early camps was the Dachau camp 10 miles from Bavaria’s capital, Munich. It was established in March 1933, one month after Hitler came to power, and remained operational during the entire period of the Third Reich, until April 1945. The Ravensbruck concentration camp, 56 miles north of Berlin and established in 1938, was the largest concentration camp for women. In addition to many other camps throughout Europe, Germany also had Sachsenhausen and Oranienburg even closer to Berlin, and Bergen-Belsen in the Lüneburger Heide (Lüneburg Heath), where Anne Frank died. Dams: The largest dam in Germany is Bleiloch (Saale) (215 million cubic meters [m3]), followed by Schwammenauel (Ruhr) (205 million m3) and Edersee (Eder) (202 million m3). Deutschland Kampagne: (Germany Campaign) In the fall of 2004, an initiative with the title “Partner für Innovation” (Partners for Innovation) was begun by German companies. They collaborated in promoting Germany as the best country for foreign investment. They also discussed ways of overcoming the economic crisis of the turn of the millennium which had created a skeptical and negative attitude among the German population. Oliver Voss (b. 1966), of the advertising agency Jung von Matt, created the slogan: Du bist Deutschland\n\n21\n\n(you are Germany) which resulted in much controversy as it reminded many of the Nazi years and the wrong kind of nationalism. The website of the campaign is: www. du-bist-deutschland.de. Historical overview, ancient to modern: Many historians begin German history with Hermann or Arminius, a chieftain of the Germanic tribe of the Cherusker who defeated three Roman legions in 9 C.E. (see Hermannsdenkmal, monument of Hermann in the Teutoburger Wald [www. hermannsdenkmal.de]). The first internationally known historical figure is Charlemagne (Karl der Große), claimed by both French and Germans as a national hero. And the claim is not incorrect, because his empire embraced both what would become France and what would become Germany. After his death, the empire was split, at first into three parts. But the middle section, Lorraine/Lothringen, did not survive for long, although even in the third millennium the claims for an independent nation have not died out completely in the Alsace Lorraine region. In 911 C.E., the eastern empire elected its own ruler, the first truly “German” emperor. With the coronation of Otto I as Imperator Romanorum in 961, the Holy Roman Empire began, characterized by conflicts between the emperors and the church. Martin Luther’s (1483–1546) Reformation, beginning in 1517, and the Thirty Years’ War (1618–1648) stand out as particularly important examples of this ongoing conflict. In contrast to its neighbor, France, Germany was an empire in name only. The power rested primarily with the individual kingdoms and principalities (see also 1: Overcoming Regionalism). After Napoleon had forced the last em-\n\n22\n\nP O P C U LT U R E G E R M A N Y !\n\nperor of the Holy Roman Empire to abdicate in 1806, and after a failed attempt at establishing a democracy in 1848 (in the wake of a growing nationalism in all of Europe), Prussia forged a new German unification following victories over Austria in 1866 and France in 1871. The new Reich was proclaimed in Versailles outside of Paris; the Prussian king was annointed Kaiser (emperor), and Otto von Bismarck, who had orchestrated the whole event, became chancellor. The German parliament did not have much power, yet Bismarck was an intelligent statesman. He did not strive for German dominance in Europe but followed a policy of balance among the major powers. He also strove to avoid social unrest in the booming industrial era and introduced far-reaching social legislation (see 3: The Social Net). By 1900, Germany was the second-largest industrial producer in the world, after the United States. It was a model for university education (see 3: The Educational System) and for science, research, and inventions (see 10: Innovation and Production). But in 1888, the emperor, Wilhelm I (1797–1888), died. His son, Friedrich (1831–1888), whose reign many liberals had looked forward to for a change of political climate, died in the same year after having been emperor for just ninety-nine days. His son, Wilhelm II (1859–1941), filled the void in this tragic Drei-Kaiser Jahr (Three Emperors Year). Under him, Germany began its actual rise as a military power and its fledgling attempts as a colonial power, stepping on British, French, and Russian toes. A clash of interests was predictable. World War I, the Great War in which the two old German powers (the Prussians and the Habsburgs) united against the rest of Europe, was the result.\n\nAfter the war, in early November 1918, the first German republic was proclaimed—actually two different republics (which would be remembered and would be imitated after World War II). The social democrat Philipp Scheidemann proclaimed the Deutsche Republik (German Republic) from a window of the Reichstag, and the leader of the Spartakusbund (the forerunners of the Communist Party), Karl Liebknecht, proclaimed the Freie Sozialistische Republik (Free Socialist Republic) from the balcony at the Berlin City Palace. At that time, a division into two Germanys was avoided following both street fighting and parliamentarian discussions. But the turmoil forced the parliament to leave the capital in Berlin and convene in Weimar, which gave its name to the new republic: the Weimar Republic. In Versailles, the place of the founding of the second German Reich, the peace was dictated by the Allies. The new German government, under the leadership of the moderate leftist Social Democratic Party, found itself with a difficult task to accomplish: It needed the support of the rightwing, antidemocratic military to help suppress the Communists. It even tolerated Freikorps (volunteer units) that had murdered two prominent and respected leaders of the radicals: Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Liebknecht. The new German government also needed to appease the Allies. The result was that the ruling politicians made themselves popular with the various factions of German society but barely survived a right-wing uprising, the Kapp Putsch (the putsch was mounted by a group of conservatives representing agrarian interests led by Wolfgang Kapp, director general of the East Prussian agricultural credit banks). The great inflation, the\n\nT H E G E R M A N S ’ A M B I VA L E N T AT T I T U D E\n\nfinancial terms of the Versailles Treaty, and punitive reparations proved too much for politicians not well versed in democratic strategies and policies. The problem was made worse by the Weimar representative voting system, which allowed for many small parties. The result was an unstable government and bickering coalitions that could not agree on necessary decisions. The feeling that this type of democratic government could not deal with the problems of a modern society eventually led to the ascension of Adolf Hitler, a native Austrian who became a German citizen in 1932. Historical overview, postwar years: May 8, 1945: Germany surrendered and the Allies took control of Germany (dividing it into four zones of occupation); May 23, 1949: The Federal Republic of Germany was founded in the three western zones (parliamentary democracy with a written constitution known as the Grundgesetz [Basic Law]); October 7, 1949: The German Democratic Republic was founded in the eastern zone (officially a parliamentary democracy, but dominated by the monopoly of power held by the governing SED). 1961: The Berlin Wall was constructed; 1966–1974: Willy Brandt’s Ostpolitik prevailed (Brandt began as secretary of state and continued as chancellor; the new secretary of state was Walter Scheel); November 9, 1989: The fall of the Berlin Wall took place after a flood of refugees left the GDR and following the so-called “Monday demonstrations” for democratic reform; July 2, 1990: A monetary, economic, and social union was established between the two Germanys; October 3, 1990: Unification completed. Although the economic problems that followed unification did not\n\n23\n\nbring down Helmut Kohl’s government in the elections of 1994, the second Grand Old Man (the first one was Konrad Adenauer) was defeated by Gerhard Schröder, the leader of the opposition party, in 1998. For the first time, the Grünen (Greens) entered the national government and became junior partners (see 10: Consumer Culture versus Green Awareness; 5: Holidays and Local Festivals; 5: From A to Z, “Days of Remembrance”). The new millennium brought more unemployment, and the reforms of the RedGreen coalition were seen by many as lacking a social conscience. Many left the SPD. Schröder called for a vote of confidence (see 3: The Political System), which he lost. The result was the announcement of early elections in September 2005, which brought no clear decision and much political maneuvering until the new große Koalition (grand coalition, meaning the coalition of the SPD and CDU) government with Angela Merkel as chancellor was established. In November 2005, Matthias Platzeck (b. 1953) was chosen as the new leader of the SPD. However, he had to resign shortly afterwards, due to health reasons. Since April 2006, the new leader is Kurt Beck (b. 1949), who has been Ministerpräsident (governor) of Rheinland-Pfalz (Rhineland-Palatinate) since 1994. Historiker-Streit: Historians’ Debate. While conservative historians (among them Ernst Nolte, Andreas Hillgruber, Michael Stürmer) demanded a relativization of the Nazi crimes, more liberal and leftist-oriented participants in the controversy (among them Jürgen Habermas, Martin Broszat, Jürgen Kocka, Wolfgang Mommsen, and Hans Mommsen) attacked these opinions, which they perceived as\n\n24\n\nP O P C U LT U R E G E R M A N Y !\n\napologetic tendencies. The primary venue for the exchange of arguments was the press.\n\nChiemsee (82 sq. km), the Schweriner See (60.6 sq. km), and the Starnberger See (57.2 sq. km).\n\nHolocaust: The term ‘Holocaust’ (from Greek ‘holos’, completely, and ‘kaustos’, burned sacrificial offering), rejected by some, became widely used in Germany after the American TV series Holocaust was shown on German TV in 1979. Before that time, Germans had used Nazi terms such as Endlösung (final solution) or Judenvernichtung (extermination of the Jews). The term “Shoah” (Hebrew for ‘destruction’ and ‘catastrophe’) is rarely used in Germany.\n\nMarshall Plan: An informal name for the European Recovery Program, named after U.S. Secretary of State George C. Marshall (1880–1959).\n\nInoffizielle Mitarbeiter: IM, unofficial collaborator. With unification and the opening of the records of the GDR secret police, many were shocked to learn how much information had been gathered about them by “unofficial collaborators.” There may have been as many as 100,000 IMs, in addition to the 100,000 official members of the state security apparatus (Carr et al. 1995, 339). Islands: The largest and best-known German island is Rügen (930 sq. km), followed by Usedom (445 sq. km; 373 sq. km belonging to Germany), Fehmarn (185 sq. km), Sylt (99 sq. km), and Föhr (83 sq. km). Jugendweihe: Youth consecration. A secular act of consecration in the GDR, developed as a parallel ceremony to the Protestant Konfirmation (Confirmation) and the Catholic Kommunion (First Communion). Lakes: The largest lake in Germany is the Bodensee (Lake Constance) (445 sq. km; 305 sq. km belonging to Germany), followed by the Müritz (110.3 sq. km), the\n\nMemorials and museums: The psychological difficulty for Germans in dealing with the past became especially visible in the long, drawn-out debate about the Holocaust memorial in Berlin, prominently placed at the site next to the Brandenburg gate, designed by the American artist Peter Eisenman. It was dedicated on May 10, 2005, the sixtieth anniversary of the end of World War II (see also 2: Symbols and Memorials). Mountains: The highest mountain in Germany is the Zugspitze in the German Alps (2,962 m), followed by the Watzmann (German Alps, 2,713 m), the Feldberg (Black Forest, 1,493 m), the Großer Arber (Bavarian Forest, 1,454 m), the Fichtelberg (Erzgebirge, Saxony, 1,215 m), and the Brocken (Harz, Thuringia, 1,142 m). Nazi trials: In 1958, the Zentrale Stelle der Landesjustizverwaltung zur Aufklärung nationalsozialistischer Verbrechen (Central Agency of the State Judicial Administration for the Investigation of National Socialist Crimes) was instituted. It proceeded very slowly in its work because of bureaucratic obstacles, a questionable legal system that was still linked in many ways to the system of the Third Reich, and the difficulties its members encountered in locating reliable evidence and witnesses. Its most spectacular trial was the Auschwitz Trial in 1964. In\n\nT H E G E R M A N S ’ A M B I VA L E N T AT T I T U D E\n\nIsrael, the Eichmann Trial in 1961 had ended with the execution of Adolf Eichmann, who had been in charge of deporting millions of Jews from German territory into the death camps. The reports on that trial by the philosopher and political theorist Hannah Arendt, compiled in Eichmann in Jerusalem: A Report on the Banality of Evil, were very controversial at the time of publication but have become a classic in the debate over fascism. Population: With about 82 million inhabitants, Germany is the third most densely populated country in Europe. Postal codes: As in the United States, postal codes in Germany consist of five digits (see also 10: Communication; 10: From A to Z, “Postal service”). Postal codes in Austria, Liechtenstein, and Switzerland have four digits. When mail is sent between countries in Europe, the international abbreviations that were first seen on car stickers are used for the country names. Examples: D = Deutschland (Germany) FL = Fürstentum Liechtenstein A = Österreich (Austria) CH = Confoederatio Helvetia, Schweiz (Switzerland) Principalities: There has been a constant flux of borders within Germany over the centuries as principalities came into existence, merged, and disappeared. The most important ones were Prussia, Austria, Saxony, and Bavaria. The original Königreich Preußen (Kingdom of Prussia) was restricted to the former area of the duchy of Prussia that was not under the jurisdiction of the Holy Roman Empire. Yet, the kings\n\n25\n\nof Prussia (who used the title of king rather than duke) were also the rulers of the Kurfürstentum (electorate) of Brandenburg. They expanded their domain in several wars, and the king of Prussia became emperor of the new German Reich in 1871 following the end of the Franco-Prussian War. This Reich collapsed after World War I. The Weimarer Republik (Weimar Republic) was its successor. After Napoleon dissolved the Holy Roman Empire, the electorate of Saxony became the Königreich Sachsen (Kingdom of Saxony). Napoleon also elevated Bavaria (Bayern) to a kingdom, and both joined the new union with France. After the defeat of Napoleon, they were part of the new German union, and after 1871 they became part of the new Reich. Even today, Bavaria emphasizes its history and independence in using the term Freistaat Bayern (Republic of Bavaria), which is found on border crossings. Only in smaller letters does the information Bundesrepublik Deutschland (Federal Republic of Germany) follow. The Erzherzogtum Österreich (archduchy of Austria) became the Austrian-Hungarian Monarchy after the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806, and after World War I the Austrian Republic. Regions: Frankfurt is Germany’s financial capital, the home of the nation’s banking institutions and the European Central Bank. It is also known for its annual book fair (see 6: Publishers). Being situated on the river Main and featuring an almost U.S.style skyline, it is also called Mainhattan. The Ruhrgebiet (Ruhr Valley) in the state of North Rhine–Westphalia is Germany’s industrial heartland with its steel industry and coal mining. It is also known as the Kohlenpott (coal pot). The Schwarzwald\n\n26\n\nP O P C U LT U R E G E R M A N Y !\n\n(Black Forest) in the state of BadenWürttemberg is one of Germany’s bestknown regions because of its cuckoo clocks and liquor-laced chocolate cake. The area around München (Munich) tops the polls for the best place to live in Germany. Berlin is seen as the most exciting city. Resistance: Due to the German population’s ambivalent attitude toward the Third Reich (in spite of the atrocities of war, the suppression by the Gestapo [secret police], and slowly emerging general awareness of the Holocaust, the myth of a well-run state looking after its citizens lingered on), the resistance against the Nazi regime was barely mentioned in the first years after the war. Only slowly did Claus Graf Schenk von Stauffenberg, leader of the plot to assassinate Hitler in 1944, and Hans and Sophie Scholl and their group, the Weiße Rose (White Rose), become part of the general consciousness. Since then, admiration and respect for them has grown. Johann Georg Elser’s early assassination attempt in 1939 to prevent the war that he saw coming, in contrast, remained controversial. Resistance by well-liked generals such as Erwin Rommel, the Wüstenfuchs (desert fox), and Wilhelm Canaris, in charge of counterintelligence, became part of the legends about these German Nazi officers. Official groups such as the Kreisauser Kreis (Kreisau Circle), named after the estate of Graf (count) Moltke, and the Bekennende Kirche (Professing Church) were explained in history books, but many individuals, including priests and others, are forgotten or only mentioned on memorials. Films about resistance and rescue of Nazi victims include Michael Verhoeven’s Die weiße Rose (The White Rose, 1982),\n\nPercy Adlon’s Fünf letzte Tage (The Five Last Days, 1982) about Sophie Scholl, Hannes Karnick and Wolfgang Richter’s Rebell wider Willen. Das Jahrhundert des Martin Niemöller (Revolutionary against His Own Will. The century of Martin Niemöller, 1985), Steven Spielberg’s Schindler’s List (1993) about Oscar Schindler, Eric Till’s Bonhoeffer—Die letzte Stufe (Bonhoeffer—The Last Step, 1999) about the theologian Dietrich Bonhoeffer, Margarethe von Trotta’s Rosenstraße (English title: Women of Rose Street, 2003) about German women who demonstrated in Rosenstraße in Berlin in 1943 for the release of their Jewish husbands, Volker Schlöndorff’s Der neunte Tag (The Ninth Day, 2004), and Marc Rothemund’s Sophie Scholl—Die letzten Tage (Sophie Scholl— The Last Days, 2005). Rivers: The main rivers are the Rhein (Rhine, 1,320 km; 865 km in Germany), the Elbe (1,165 km; 700 km in Germany), the Donau (Danube, 2,858 km; 686 km in Germany), the Main (524 km), the Weser (440 km), the Spree (382 km), the Neckar (367 km), and the Mosel (545 km; 242 km in Germany). SBZ: Sowjetisch Besetzte Zone (Soviet Occupied Territory). The term was used for the GDR by the West. Stasi: Staatssicherheit (State Security Forces). The secret police of the GDR, founded in 1950, penetrated all aspects of life through an extensive network that also included unofficial informers (see “Inoffizielle Mitarbeiter,” above). For decades, its director was Erich Mielke (1907–2000). Besides observing their own citizens, Stasi operatives were also responsible for exter-\n\nT H E G E R M A N S ’ A M B I VA L E N T AT T I T U D E\n\nnal spying. Their most spectacular success was the placing of a spy, Günter Guillaume, in the office of Chancellor Willy Brandt, which led to his resignation in 1974 (the topic of Michael Frayn’s play Democracy, 2003). States: The following list contains the names of the states (with English names in parentheses where they differ from the German), followed by the capital (in citystates, it is the same name), its size in square kilometers, and its population, based on the official information from 2003 (Beck 2003).

Tourist attractions/places of myths and legends: The Brocken, the highest mountain of the Harz mountain range (see “Mountains,” above) in Saxony-Anhalt, is the place where, in German mythology, witches meet on the night of April 30 for Walpurga’s Eve (see 5: Holidays and Local Festivals). Burg Eltz, above the wine village Moselkern, belongs to the top ten tourist attractions in Germany even though it can only be reached on foot after a hike of more than an hour. It is well worth the effort, however, because it is one of the bestkept medieval castles, with historical records dating back to 1157.
