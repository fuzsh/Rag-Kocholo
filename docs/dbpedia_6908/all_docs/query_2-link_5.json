        "text": "German actress Katja Riemann has enjoyed substantial critical and professional success in her native land for her film work, while making time for additional creative pursuits as a writer of children's books and a recording artist. The daughter of teachers, Riemann first wished to be a dancer before shifting her focus to drama and music, both of which she studied in Hamburg and Hanover. After her initial stage performances, she earned top billing in her first onscreen role, the TV movie \"Summer in Lesmona.\" Further work followed, including another lead spot, in the short-lived series \"Regina on the Ladder to Success.\" She earned critical acclaim (and German film awards) for subsequent parts in the romantic comedy \"Talk of the Town\" and the drama about an all-girl band comprised of prison inmates, \"Bandits,\" for which she also co-wrote the music. More attention and accolades came her way for performances in \"Rosenstrasse,\" a tale of Jewish guilt and history, and the quirky, sexually charged comedic drama \"Agnes and His Brothers.\" Riemann released two albums, including a collection of jazz favorites, which she promoted by touring around Germany, and she has written children's books illustrated by her sister, Susan."
