        "text": "The feverish libidos wreaking emotional havoc in Oskar Roehler's infantile sex comedy \"Agnes and His Brothers\" are a quintessentially Germanic mixture of kinky, obsessive and sentimental. The movie's view of the centrality of sex and its quasi-incestuous connection to family history unapologetically genuflects to Freud. Watching the film, you might imagine that the founder of psychoanalysis was as up to date as Dr. Phil, and that repression, shame and hysteria are still the rage a century after Freud discovered and diagnosed them.\n\nThat Freudianism is filtered through the cinematic influence of Rainer Werner Fassbinder, the German titan who casts a long shadow over the movie's jarring mood swings. The changes the comically tormented siblings go through are viewed from an off-center, Fassbinder-like perspective that weaves along a circuitous path from dark comedy to melodrama to mush. At different moments, the film wants to elicit laughter, disgust and tears of empathy. But aside from appreciating the movie's sturdy performances, my reaction to this satire of the middle-class, all-German family swung from revulsion to mystification.\n\nThe movie's siblings are Agnes (Martin Weiss), a lonely male-to-female transsexual and nightclub performer, and her brothers Hans-Jörg (Moritz Bleibtreu), a single, sex-starved librarian, and Werner (Herbert Knaup), a rising politician who is married with children. The source of all trouble is their dreaded father (Vadim Glowna), an affluent hermit with a long, shaggy mane who suggests a near-catatonic acid casualty from the 1960's. The one emotion uniting the brothers is their fear and loathing of this weirdo, who, once upon a time, might have molested Agnes.\n\nEarly in the movie Agnes, the most likable of the three, is kicked out of the house by her loutish boyfriend. Much later, she has a mawkish reunion with an American lover from her pre-op days who has become a sports star with an entourage. Her character is a tear-jerking cliché of the sexual outsider as saintly victim.\n\nThe gist of the humor focuses on Hans-Jörg, who attends a 12-step program for sexual addiction and keeps a mannequin in his apartment for stimulation. At work he regularly steals away from his desk to the bathroom, where he masturbates while spying on beautiful women through a peephole in the next stall. Finding it impossible to meet a partner (women smell his desperation from a mile away and head for the hills), he finds the answer to his prayers by going into the pornography business.\n\nWerner, also perpetually in heat, is repeatedly rejected by his haughty wife, Signe (Katja Riemann), who would prefer to massage sunscreen onto the back of their outrageously spoiled teenage son Ralf (Tom Schilling). This arrogant little monster likes to sneak around the house taping his father doing things like defecating on the floor.\n\nIt isn't until the very end that \"Agnes and His Brothers\" begins to resolve itself in the most unsatisfying way. Beneath the accumulated resentment, contempt and alienation, it seems that love will hold things together. This unearned sentimentality undermines the satire and leaves you simply baffled.\n\nMight its message be that the secret of happiness in modern Germany lies in proper toilet training? If so, let's hear a round of applause for clean diapers.\n\nThe movie is not rated. It has sexual situations and profanity.\n\nAgnes and His Brothers\n\nOpens today in Manhattan"
