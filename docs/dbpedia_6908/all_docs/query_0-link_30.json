        "text": "This thesis explores the complex relationship between the concepts of Heimat and Fremde in a number of contemporary Austrian films. Firstly, by revisiting and re-examining a variety of Heimatfilme, from the genre’s inception in the 1920s up until the present day, I aim to draw on the ideas posed by scholars including Johannes von Moltke which challenge the common assumption that Heimat exists in direct opposition to Fremde, and argue that the two seemingly contradictory concepts are in fact mutually contingent on one another. Then, focussing on key works by the New Austrian Filmmakers, Houchang Allahyari (I Love Vienna, 1991), Florian Flicker (Suzie Washington, 1998) and Barbara Albert (Nordrand, 1999), I demonstrate the manner in which these filmmakers continue to draw on the semantics and syntax of the Heimatfilm genre in order to re-evaluate the complex relationship between Heimat and Fremde within the context of post-1990 Europe. These filmmakers, as this thesis demonstrates, return to the Heimatfilm genre as a means to probe issues of space, place, identity and belonging, which, I maintain, also undergo a series of renegotiations and redefinitions within their films. By drawing on contemporary globalisation and migrant and diasporic film studies, and by critically engaging with contemporary Heimat discourse, this thesis seeks to investigate the manner in which these New Austrian Filmmakers attempt to renegotiate and deterritorialise the concept of Heimat in response to the changing needs of an increasingly globalised and multicultural society.\n\nIn his film Halbe Treppe, Andreas Dresen uses stylistic elements and modes of production similar to exilic filmmakers, as described by Naficy in his book An Accented Cinema, in an attempt to portray both a sense of exile and a desire for freedom in his characters. Since exile is inextricably bound-up in questions of both homeland and identity, the film invites comparison not only to exilic cinema but also to certain aspects of New German Cinema, particularly issues of German identity that many critics argue have been too often ignored by other young German filmmakers. By emphasizing the importance of Frankfurt/Oder as the setting for his characters’ experience of exile, Dresen creates a connection between identity and “place” that encourages the spectator to reflect upon the traditional notion of “Heimat” and how it might be re-imagined in a new multicultural, unified Germany.\n\nIn the 1970s, cities across the United States and Western Europe faced a deep social and political crisis that challenged established principles of planning, economics and urban theory. At the same time, film industries experienced a parallel process of transition, the effects of which rippled through the aesthetic and narrative form of the decade's cinema. The Cinema of Urban Crisis traces a new path through the cinematic legacy of the 1970s by drawing together these intertwined histories of urban and cultural change. Bringing issues of space and place to the fore, the book unpacks the geographical and spatial dynamics of film movements from the New Hollywood to the New German Cinema, showing how the crisis of the seventies and the emerging 'postindustrial' economy brought film and the city together in new configurations. Chapters cover a range of cities on both sides of the Atlantic, from New York, Philadelphia and San Francisco to London, Paris and Berlin. Integrating analysis of film industries and production practices with detailed considerations of individual texts, the book offers strikingly original close analyses of a wide range of films, from New Hollywood (The Conversation, The King of Marvin Gardens, Rocky) to European art cinema (Alice in the Cities, The Passenger, Tout va Bien) and popular international genres such as the political thriller and the crime film. Focusing on the aesthetic and representational strategies of these films, the book argues that the decade's cinema engaged with - and helped to shape - the passage from the 'urban crisis' of the late sixties to the neoliberal 'urban renaissance' of the early eighties. Splicing ideas from film studies with urban geography and architectural history, the book offers a fresh perspective on a rich period of film history and opens up new directions for critical engagement between film and urban studies. Reviews: Selected as a Choice Outstanding Academic Title, 2016. “The Cinema of Urban Crisis is instantly a classic study on the relationship between the city and the cinema. The breadth and scope of this magnificent work is remarkable; Webb . . . has a seemingly limitless knowledge of urban history, political movements and ideology, and film. . . . This is an outstanding and important work. . . . Essential.” (Choice) https://www.aup.nl/en/book/9789089646378/the-cinema-of-urban-crisis\n\nThe term \"Berliner Sonderschule' appears both in a humorous scene in Jan Ole Gerster’s 2012 film \"Oh Boy\" (English: \"A Coffee in Berlin\") and in a media interview with Gerster using it to refer to his cinematic aesthetic. He thereby consciously sets his work apart from Berlin School films. Exploring cinematic and narrative techniques in \"Oh Boy\"—including how the director spotlights the city’s palimpsestuous architectural objects and displays the influence of German history on present-day Berliners—we reveal what Gerster might mean with his use of the tongue-in-cheek designation Berliner Sonderschule. We demonstrate how the director reinforces his distance from the Berlin School and refers to his kaleidoscopic aesthetic with self-deprecating humour. In \"Oh Boy,\" Gerster confronts the interconnectedness of past and present, critiques the state of cinema in post-Wall Germany, and is not afraid to laugh at himself in the process.\n\nThis extract provided by Edinburgh University Press includes the full introduction, the table of contents, and a link to the book's page on the EUP website. Abstract: Over the past two decades road cinema has become an increasingly popular form of expression for European directors. Focusing on a corpus of films from France, Belgium and Switzerland, including works by Ismaël Ferroukhi, Bouli Lanners, Aki Kaurismäki and Jacqueline Audry amongst many others, French-language Road Cinema contends that nowhere is the impulse to remap the spaces and identities of ‘New Europe’ more evident than in French-language cinema. Drawing on mobility studies, cultural geography and film theory, this innovative work sketches out the flexible yet distinctive parameters of contemporary French-language road cinema, and argues for an understanding of the ‘road movie’ not as a genre but as a thematic and formal template that crosses cinematic categories to bring together a wide array of films that narrate the movements of migrants, tourists and business executives."
