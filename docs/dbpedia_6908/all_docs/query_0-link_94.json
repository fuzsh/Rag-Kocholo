New generations of writers and filmmakers call for a reassessment and remapping of the German past and are pushing at the boundaries of cultural taboos and political correctness, delving into the complex question what constitutes the German nation today.\n\nVisiting Germany during the summer of 2006, one came upon a country whose usual gloom and doom was supplanted by a party atmosphere not seen since the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. Germany was hosting the soccer world championship and had invited the entire world to drop in and experience a people that was proudly waving its flag and chanting the national anthem. The event with the official motto ‘Die Welt zu Gast bei Freunden’ offered Germany a grand opportunity to present itself as a hospitable and generous country, open, multicultural, and far from being xenophobic. For four weeks the German nation became a model of perfect harmony, united within itself and united with the rest of the world. 1 The question though was whether this sense of belonging, rarely encountered among the German people, would outlast the event or national concerns about immigration, the still visible divide between East and West Germany, and the never-ending debate about the country’s identity would not take center stage once again. Certainly not everybody was pleased with the seemingly ardent display of German patriotism, dubbed by the German media as ‘partyotism,’ and warnings about the dangers of hoisting the flag on every building and singing the national anthem, exploited and infused by the Nazis with undertones of cultural supremacy, were voiced. 2 It would seem that not even an innocuous event such as a soccer game would allow the German nation some respite from questions and concerns about its past. Yet, despite the criticisms of the Germans for their open display of national pride, the tournament proved to be an immensely successful boost for Germany’s image around the world. 3\n\n2\n\nChristine Anton\n\nIn the last few years, headline news from Germany have indeed conveyed an impression of a progressive and open-minded society, cooperating on a global level, and trying to build economic and political partnerships with friends and foes alike. Endeavors such as changing the German citizenship laws 4 to guiding the eurozone out of a financial meltdown in 2010 and becoming the dominant force ensuring stability among European member states, illustrate Germany’s striving to exercise a leadership role in global affairs, and, simultaneously, to lead by example. Yet, despite achievements in its domestic and foreign policy, and having been world champion in exporting goods until only recently, not all is well in the republic, at least in the country’s own perception. ‘Hat der deutsche Bürger keinen Grund zum Jammern, wird er unzufrieden,’ writes Swiss journalist Roger de Weck. 5 It is no exaggeration to say that Germans have a tendency to be their own worst critics – ‘Champions im Volkssport, das eigene Land schlechtzumachen.’ 6 The nation’s biggest pet peeves to date are the ailing economy, even though this has become a worldwide phenomenon; the enormous costs gobbled up by Germany’s unification and its rebuilding of the East; outsourcing and the disappearance of jobs caused in part by globalization; a diminishing living standard especially resulting from the Hartz Reforms and their intended restructuring of unemployment and social security benefits; widespread right-wing extremism and a growing crime rate in the former East; the debate about Turkey’s ambition to join the E.U.; the constitutionality of Germany’s mission in Afghanistan; and, last but not least, the apparently unreachable goal of obtaining a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council. These days, several years after having hosted the World Cup, the nation’s aura of ‘united we can’ has been replaced with what can only be called a genuine sense of apprehension and frustration. Germany is struggling with how it is perceived by the world around it, whether or not it has garnered global respect, and, moreover, how its own self-perception measures up to an objective and factual evaluation of its state-of-affairs. Much has been written in recent years about Germany’s identity crisis and quest for a viable, ‘normal’ national consciousness and platform. 7 From the politically controversial concept of ‘Leitkultur’ to Jürgen Habermas’s plea for a ‘constitutional patriotism,’ the debates about the meaning of national identity are fierce and multi-faceted. 8 One of the underlying issues is\n\nRepositioning German Identity\n\n3\n\nwhether or not Germany should call itself a country of immigrants, and if the concept of cultural hegemony has become a thing of the past. 9 Does, for instance, multiculturalism support the idea of indigenously controlled cultural institutions, and should immigrants be forced to integrate rather than be given time to gradually assimilate? If so, does compulsory integration into a leading culture with core beliefs and values not eventually lead to ghettoization and a degree of indigence and racial discrimination? The danger here, of course, is that social and ethnic segregation can lead to violent demonstrations and riots as has been the case in several European states in recent years (e.g., France, the Netherlands, Denmark, and the Czech Republic). As in many other countries, the problem of immigration pushed the German government to come up with a sweeping reform, and after several years of negotiations between the then ruling parties of SPD and the Greens and the oppositional forces of CDU and FDP, the new immigration act took effect at the beginning of 2005, requiring immigrants to take mandatory language as well as integration courses to learn about the country’s history, culture, and laws. 10 Immigration, however, is by far not the sole factor that has forced Germans to reexamine their identity. The onslaught of debates about German identity started with the fall of the Berlin Wall, the end of the Cold War, and the unification of the two Germanys. The ‘Literaturstreit’ that ignited after Christa Wolf’s publication of her book Was bleibt? in 1990, and the ensuing revelations that Wolf and other prominent dissident East German writers (most notably Heiner Müller, Rainer Schedlinski and Sascha Anderson) collaborated with the ‘Stasi,’ East Germany’s secret police, and the opening of the ‘Stasi’ files to the public in 1992, led to a whole firestorm of recriminations and defenses, and initiated a discussion about how to come to terms with the GDR past. The East German ‘Vergangenheitsbewältigung’ regarding its socialist past in turn sparked a renewed emergence of the West German past and its significance for the present and future of a united nation. 11 It became quite obvious that the Nazi past was still an open sore in the nation’s collective psyche when the ensuing public discourse engaged in tackling issues such as how Germany has confronted its past, what Giordano calls the ‘Leichenberg im Keller der deutschen Geschichte,’ 12 what lessons, if any, have been learned, and whether or not the discussion about the Holocaust and the German guilt has reached a saturation point. In addition, a plethora of studies\n\n4\n\nChristine Anton\n\non this subject were published during the 90s, repeating the arguments put forth by the ‘Historikerstreit’ that gripped the West German nation in the late 80s. 13 The debate between the main participants Ernst Nolte and Jürgen Habermas played out mostly through newspaper articles and editorials in the FAZ and Die Zeit and centered on a couple of key issues: Were the Nazi crimes a defensive response to Stalin’s dictatorship and Soviet brutality? Was Nazism an inevitability, i.e., is there something innate in the German character that led to Hitler’s popularity? And how much responsibility does the German nation bear for the Holocaust and for how long? Thus, when a decade later Daniel Goldhagen’s controversial dissertation Hitler’s Willing Executioners was published in 1996, its author found fertile ground for his theses. Arguing that it was not only a small minority of party leaders and SS-officers who were involved in the mass killings of Jews, but that the entire nation willingly acquiesced to the extinction of millions of innocent people, Goldhagen provoked renewed engagement in an objective and moral reflection on the meaning of the Nazi past. Certainly, Goldhagen was not the first to question the actions of ‘ordinary’ citizens during the Hitler regime, but he did succeed in challenging a widespread complacency among Germans who had put the past behind them, buried it, and assuaged their conscience. 14 Undoubtedly, German ‘Vergangenheitsbewältigung’ has undergone several stages since 1945. When in the aftermath of Germany’s capitulation Allied Forces took full control of German everyday life, one of their first initiatives was to ‘denazify’ the German population and to establish the foundation for a new democracy. Denazification, however, did not completely accomplish what was intended, namely removing all Nazi personnel from positions of influence and reeducating the populace, partly because many ex-Nazis successfully hid their true identity or escaped to countries sympathetic to the Nazi ideology, partly because by 1948 the U.S. government redirected its attention to matters of greater importance – its response to what became known as the Cold War. As a result, a number of former Nazis were reemployed in West Germany’s newly formed government, or were even hired by the U.S. for their expertise in espionage or the sciences, as in the case of the rocket engineer Wernher von Braun who in time became responsible for launching America’s space program. 15 Reconstruction efforts and the implementation of the Marshall Plan facilitated West Germany’s economic miracle in the 50s, which kept\n\nRepositioning German Identity\n\n5\n\nthe nation busy and made it easier to evade a constructive confrontation with its immediate past as the Mitscherlichs in their ground-breaking work Die Unfähigkeit zu trauern laid bare. 16 Consequently, the shock effect of the Frankfurt Auschwitz Trials from 1963 to 1965 was especially profound when it brought to light the unspeakable horrors that were committed by low ranking Nazi officials and sympathizers. If West Germans were under the illusion that the Nuremberg Trials of the late forties had put an end to prosecuting and condemning the country’s horrific crimes during the Third Reich, they now were forced to listen to an even more detailed account of what went on behind the barbed wires of the concentration and extermination camps. It was these public revelations about the Holocaust and, consequently, the exposing of ‘die zweite Schuld,’ 17 that laid the ground for Germany’s slow and arduous path towards coming to terms with its past. The West German nation’s obstinate silence and twenty-year-long cover-up of the gruesome murders shook particularly younger people into action to explore their parents’ activities during the Nazi regime. ‘Anti-fascism,’ ‘anti-establishment,’ cleaning the country of the ‘dust from thousand years’ were the slogans of the radical student movement of the late sixties. The student protests of 1968 were instrumental in giving a voice to the concerns of the second generation, those born during or shortly after the war, and who since have been the driving force for working through the legacy of Hitler’s Third Reich, the genocide of Jews, and the extermination of countless other victims of the Nazi ideology. Many expressed their anger, regret, and their mourning through writing. In the mid-70s appeared a corpus of literature known as ‘Väterliteratur’ that is a testament to the deep psychological troubles the young generation faced in uncovering their fathers’ involvement in the Nazi Party. Part fiction, part autobiography, these texts reveal a moral and ethical distancing from the generation of parents and grandparents, creating a major rift between the two generations that fundamentally shaped the direction of West Germany’s political, social and cultural future. 18 The next decade saw many attempts by the West German government to not only publicly acknowledge the country’s political and moral obligation to the victims of National Socialism, but also to apologize and to seek ways to make reparations to the surviving family members. Two events in 1985 made it clear that the German government was well-intentioned\n\n6\n\nChristine Anton\n\non one hand, but, on the other, went about it like the proverbial elephant in a china store. One was U.S. President Reagan’s clumsily planned visit of the grave site of Waffen-SS officers at Bitburg, 19 the other German President Weizsäcker’s speech at the ceremony commemorating the fortieth anniversary of the end of World War II, in which he referred to it as ‘the day of liberation from the inhuman system of Nazi tyranny.’ 20 As the result of Germany’s unification, the notion of remembrance and commemoration was expanded, as similar questions about identity, growing up under a totalitarian regime, and denial of the past had to be faced and dealt with, and new impetus was given to the postHolocaust discourse. The nineties were also a time when the German nation was called upon to settle monetary claims made by Holocaust survivors as well as former forced laborers. In 1999, the German government under Chancellor Schröder announced plans to pay reparations to victims of Nazi atrocities from funds provided by some of the country’s largest companies. In August 2000, a German law establishing the foundation ‘Erinnerung, Verantwortung und Zukunft’ took effect. 21 By the end of 2006 when payments were concluded, 1.7 million survivors and their heirs in almost 100 countries had received a total of €4.47 billion. 22 While murder and torture cannot be compensated monetarily, the question remains how Germany will continue remembering its moral obligation. Consequently, since the nineties the term ‘Vergangenheitsbewältigung’ has come under strict scrutiny because of its implication of seeking to ‘overcome or master the past,’ something that can simply never be accomplished. Nowadays, scholars increasingly use the more neutral term ‘memory acts’ when referring to the act of remembering the past. Additionally, analyzing the psychological impact of ‘postmemory’ or ‘secondary memory’ on post-war generations has become the focal point of many Holocaust studies. 23 For the last decade, the discussion about memory and mourning, postmemory and trauma has taken on a rather abstract and theoretical trait, which is troubling to an extent as it shifts the attention from palpable immediacy to the realm of intellectual and academic study. 24 Since the start of the new millennium a new phase of coping with ‘Vergangenheitsbewältigung,’ which can only be summarized as the ‘institutionalization of the Holocaust,’ has entered the public consciousness. In 2001, the Jewish Museum opened in Berlin, and in\n\nRepositioning German Identity\n\n7\n\n2005, the Holocaust Memorial, commemorating the murdered Jews of Europe, was inaugurated. In 2008, two more memorials were added to the list: One is dedicated to the persecuted homosexuals and was inaugurated in May of that year; 25 the other site will honor the murdered Sinti and Roma who had voiced criticism of the Berlin Holocaust Memorial as it appears to single out the Jewish victims, when in fact there were many more victims such as gypsies, homosexuals, communists, and other political and religious prisoners. 26 Additionally, the German government successfully lobbied for moving the secretariat of The Task Force for International Cooperation on Holocaust Education, Remembrance, and Research, initiated in 1998 by the Swedish prime minister, to its permanent location in Berlin where it opened in March 2008.27 Concentration and extermination camps such as Buchenwald, Dachau and Auschwitz have long been sites of commemoration and education, and visiting them has been incorporated into the German school curriculum for decades. Many critics fear that this institutionalization signals the end of the German attempt to deal actively with the past, while supporters believe that institutionalization guarantees the continuation of remembering the past through its de facto visibility and tangibility. Yet, it seems that even the legacy of the Holocaust and German guilt has succumbed to the Zeitgeist of political correctness as the German nation is simply trying to be all things to all people. The main objective of the foundation ‘Erinnerung, Verantwortung und Zukunft’ and the building boom with respect to Holocaust memorials certainly is the recognition of those who suffered persecution or violence during the Hitler regime, and to promote the recovery of suppressed individual and family memory. However, the emphasis on a spirit of reconciliation, harmony and pluralism is starting to have a negative effect on the distinction between the ‘real’ victims of National Socialism and those who were ‘only’ indirectly victimized. The issue thus becomes whether or not it is morally justifiable to recognize every person’s suffering, no matter to what side those who suffered the violence belonged. 28 Hence, does the German nation, too, have the right to call itself a victim of Nazism, specifically considering air attacks and bombing raids during World War II, as this particular question has become a direct by-product of the political correctness when talking about the twelve years of Nazi terror?\n\n8\n\nChristine Anton\n\nIn the mid-nineties it seemed there was no end in sight to the German self-flagellation over past atrocities. There had been the unexpected success of the Goldhagen book, the opening of the exhibition ‘Verbrechen der Wehrmacht,’ and the 1995 publication of Victor Klemperer’s diaries detailing everyday life in Nazi Germany. 29 Yet the overall fanfare in the media regarding these three events also resulted in opening the door to a major shift in perspective by adding a new dimension to the study of the Holocaust and Nazi ideology that has become known as ‘the partial pardoning of the German nation.’ Naturally, the insistence on examining the German past would almost automatically have to lead to an eventual evaluation of the current state of the nation by comparing and contrasting ‘Germany then’ with ‘Germany now’ as well as predictions for the country’s future. Thus, on the one hand the renewed interest in the German past thrust the German nation once again into closely examining the scale of their forefathers’ involvement with the Nazi party, but on the other it also provided the incentive to finally exonerate those who openly defied Nazism or at least covertly tried to undermine the Nazi power structure. Had the notion that Germany itself had been a victim of Nazism once been taboo, it now received what some call its ‘due attention’ not only in the press but also in films, documentaries, and in literature. In 1997, W. G. Sebald gave a series of lectures titled ‘Luftkrieg und Literatur’ at the University of Zurich in which he criticized the members of ‘Gruppe 47’ for having failed by and large to write about the German victimization in Allied air attacks. Sebald contends that this part of German war history received only sparse literary interest which amounted to a virtual taboo in German culture. Only a handful of writers constitute an exception to the rule; yet, either they did not achieve a long-lived interest among their readers or were faced with indefinite delays in the publication of their works. Though, for example, Heinrich Böll wrote his novel Der Engel schwieg as early as 1949, the book was passed from publisher to publisher until its eventual publication in 1992. Likewise, Alexander Kluge’s work Der Luftangriff auf Halberstadt am 8. April 1945, written in 1970, did not get published until 1977, more than thirty years after the end of the war. Sebald’s critique is directly aimed at the passivity of German writers who, Sebald opines, chose silence over political and historical discourse. His theses sparked intense criticism from the left who ac-\n\nRepositioning German Identity\n\n9\n\ncused Sebald not only of blurring the distinction between perpetrators and victims, but also of wanting to revise German history, a lashing out against the author akin to what Martin Walser experienced after his speech at the Frankfurt Book Fair in 1998. 30 Nonetheless, Sebald has posthumously been credited for starting the literary discourse on the German trauma of World War II and the national debate about collective versus personal memory. His essay ‘Luftkrieg und Literatur,’ based on his lectures, and in particular his novel Austerlitz (2001) have tapped into a hitherto repressed chapter of wartime memory which Sebald sought to free from its taboo status in order to engage in a comprehensive dialogue about the Holocaust, its representation, and about commemoration, memory and identity. Another work that has since received a lot of attention is Jörg Friedrich’s Der Brand which chronicles the Allied bombing of civilian targets during World War II. Its accusation that British attacks were a ‘sinnlose[] Vergeltungs- und Strafaktion gegen eine schutzlose Zivilbevölkerung’ was harshly reprimanded by the German media, yet the book achieved considerable literary success. 31 Thus, when Günter Grass in 2002 published his novella Im Krebsgang about the sinking of the German military ship Wilhelm Gustloff by a Soviet submarine, the deadliest disaster in sea history, the issue of collective amnesia had already been hotly debated. 32 Though tragic, the Gustloff’s close association with Hitler’s ‘Kriegsmarine’ ensured that the enormous loss of lives would not be empathetically recognized and this made the tragedy a footnote in maritime history. More than fifty years later, however, talking about this unprecedented disaster and the plight of German refugees in the latter days of the war was no longer perceived as an audacious act on part of the German people. Other significant publications over the last decade that have dealt with displacement, war refugees, and the German collective silence include Hans-Ulrich Treichel’s Der Verlorene; Tanja Dückers’s Himmelskörper; Reinhard Jirgl’s Die Unvollendeten; Walter Kempowski’s Alles umsonst; the four-part Spiegel series ‘Die Deutschen als Opfer;’ and the TV documentaries ‘Die Vertriebenen. Hitlers letzte Opfer,’ and ‘Die grosse Flucht.’ 33 From a psychological standpoint, Germany’s new ease with which it approaches its own memories of the collective traumatic events in the latter days of World War II should be an encouragement for the nation to engage in a mourning process and halt the transgenerational transference of a repressed trauma which, if\n\n10\n\nChristine Anton\n\nunexpressed, could ‘function as a powerful transmitter of an unmastered inheritance.’ 34 A nation’s historical trauma calls for mourning, but the distinction between victims and perpetrators as to their ‘subject position’ with respect to historical trauma cannot and must not be blurred or conflated. ‘Not everyone traumatized by events is a victim,’ LaCapra writes. He continues: There is the possibility of perpetrator trauma which must itself be acknowledged and in some sense worked through if perpetrators are to distance themselves from an earlier implication in deadly ideologies and practices. Such trauma does not, however, entail the equation or identification of the perpetrator and the victim. 35\n\nThe debate about historiography, personal versus collective memory, and a German identity crisis has definitively had an effect on the German/Jewish relationship. When Walser rejected what he called the ‘Auschwitz moral cudgel,’ he was immediately labeled an antiSemite, and his earlier books were subsequently carefully re-analyzed and generally branded as being anti-Jewish. 36 Undoubtedly, Germany’s grappling with repressed memories has to be closely watched and evaluated to prevent mythologization and decontextualization of historical facts. 37 Jewish Holocaust survivors and their families in particular judge Germans’ new-found role as war victims to be a role reversal and detraction from their own status. Germany’s ‘problems with guilt, shame, and forgiveness cannot be expected to be solved by the victims.’ 38 At the same time, the neglect of these historical facts ‘would run the risk of being a distortion of historical truth.’ 39 Even taking into consideration the possible misuse of blurring the perpetrator/victim dichotomy, the necessity ‘ein […] umfassenderes Perspektivenspektrum auf jene historische Zeit zu entwerfen und dadurch ein hoffentlich vollständigeres und richtigeres Bild zu konstruieren’ is real. 40 As such the ‘current developments [are] necessary stages in the historical process.’ 41 Therefore, it is paramount that both sides engage in an open dialogue that does not perpetuate an endless cycle of blame and apologetic gestures, nor tries to whitewash history or eradicate memory. ‘If Germans feel they can criticize forms of memory or even the Jews without being accused of anti-semitism, and if Jews can criticize Germans without fear of giving rise to antisemitism, then “normal” dialogue will be possible, and resentments deriving from the suppression of true opinion overcome.’ 42\n\nRepositioning German Identity\n\n11\n\nClearly, the German government does its utmost to placate Jews and the State of Israel as well as its own Jewish-German citizens and assures them that their plight and connection to the German past and present is a constant focal point of the country’s political agenda. A milestone, albeit a contentious one as mentioned before, was reached with President Weizsäcker’s speech in 1985, another one when President Köhler gave his speech on the sixtieth anniversary of the end of WWII in which he told the assembled parliament that Germany forever bears ‘die Verantwortung, die Erinnerung an all dieses Leid und an seine Ursachen wachzuhalten,’ and that the German nation has ‘dafür [zu] sorgen, dass es nie wieder dazu kommt. Es gibt keinen Schlussstrich.’ 43 Relations between Germany and Israel have indeed undergone a transformation for the better. Next to the United States, Germany has become Israel’s most important economic partner and military ally, and Israel’s concerns are an ‘unumstößliche Maxime deutscher Politik,’ as Köhler pledged in an address to the Knesset in Jerusalem in 2005 to mark the fortieth anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between the State of Israel and the Federal Republic of Germany. 44 When Chancellor Merkel joined the State of Israel’s sixtieth anniversary celebrations in 2008, she was given special permission to address the Knesset in German, a decision that was certainly not unanimously approved by all members of the Israeli legislature as many still consider German to be the language of the murderers of Jews. In her unprecedented speech, Merkel stressed the uniqueness of German-Israeli ties and the moral responsibility that Germany bears for the ‘Massenmord an sechs Millionen Juden.’ 45 Israel and Germany are bonded by a shared past, present and future, and it is the past that ‘erfüllt uns Deutsche mit Scham,’ she avowed. The present, Merkel stated, is characterized by the ‘besondere[] historische[] Verantwortung Deutschlands für die Sicherheit Israels,’ a responsibility that is part of Germany’s ‘Staatsräson.’ And the priority for the future must be ‘zusammen mit der jungen Generation das Bewusstsein für eine Erinnerungskultur zu wecken, eine Erinnerungskultur, die auch dann trägt, wenn die Überlebenden der Shoah nicht mehr unter uns sein werden,’ the chancellor declared. The relationship between the two states reached yet another level of amicability when Israeli President Peres attended a special parliamentary session in Berlin at the beginning of 2010 to commemorate the sixty-fifth anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration\n\n12\n\nChristine Anton\n\ncamp. In his speech to the German parliament, Peres expressed his country’s gratitude for Germany’s help and support, and, like Merkel, emphasized the unique friendship between the two countries. 46 German-Israeli political cooperation has never been closer – since 2008, the German and Israeli cabinets have met twice for consultations –, Jewish communities are being re-established in Germany, and Jewish life and traditions are becoming part of the German cultural landscape once again. But building a niche for their cultural identity among Germans, many of whom still feel uneasy when encountering the Jewish ‘other,’ is for many Jews a harrowing undertaking. Parallel to the German people, German Jews have had to go through their own ‘Vergangenheitsbewältigung.’ Like their counterpart, the non-Jewish German second generation, it is the Jewish second and third generations who are responsible for exploring the past and coming to terms with their ancestors’ painful and tragic fate. They ‘have come to realize that the catastrophe undergone by their elders has left traces in their minds and bodies, traces that call for elaboration and interpretation.’ 47 From blaming their parents and grandparents for silently enduring the Nazi torture and failing to stand up to Hitler’s henchmen, to calling for a truce in German/Jewish relations, the emotions attached to this trauma are disparate and complex. As successors to the Holocaust generation they are ‘concerned with the fragile balancing act of living in Germany as Jews, the difficult struggle of self-definition, and the search for a Jewish identity in the country of the murderers,’ Ernestine Schlant writes. 48 Among Jewish-German authors who write about the legacy of the past, Rafael Seligmann is one who advocates a new direction in the German/Jewish dialogue. In his books and essays he examines the mechanisms of searching for a hybrid German-Jewish identity in postShoah daily life. Adamant that learning from and of the past is imperative, Seligmann, however, argues that the time has come for a new vision for the Jewish community in Germany, a vision that requires that ‘the fixation on the genocide of the Jewish people […] yield to a view that takes the full spectrum of German-Jewish history into account.’ 49 Seligmann is part of a group of contemporary German-Jewish writers who aim to transcend the psychological walls between themselves and their parents’ generation, and to break the taboos that have affected the interaction between Jews and Germans. The narrative structures these writers employ range from expressing\n\nRepositioning German Identity\n\n13\n\nanger and sadness, as in Ruth Klüger’s, Barbara Honigmann’s and Esther Dischereit’s works, to using humor, sarcasm and caricature as in the case of Seligmann and Maxim Biller. 50 Writers such as Seligmann and Biller seek to alter the mindsets and attitudes in their own community as well as the feelings of Germans towards religious and ethnic minorities. Fundamentally, with a falling birth rate and an aging population, Germany needs its minorities to remain competitive in a globalized economy. With notions of ‘nationstate’ and ‘homogenous culture’ vanishing from daily discourse, it is vital for Germans to realize that their country is becoming a pluralistic nation in which minorities contribute significantly to the image of Germany in the twenty-first century. And while Seligmann mocks what he labels ‘philo-Semitism’ in today’s German society, a fascination for all things Jewish that Jack Zipes interprets as ‘alibis to the rest of the world’ and testament ‘that Germans are no longer antiSemitic,’ 51 many others fear a resurgence of anti-Semitism in the midst of widely perceived xenophobia. Right-wing violence against foreigners in Germany had increased dramatically in the late 90s, and recent years do not show a slowing trend in extremist activity. In August 2007, the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights published a ‘Report on Racism and Xenophobia in the Member States of the EU,’ in which Germany was cited as one of the European countries with an upward trend in racist violence and crime. 52 According to the report, violent racism had increased by 5.3% between 2001 and 2006, whereas crimes with an extremist right-wing motive showed a staggering 12.2% increase during the same time period. In addition, anti-Semitic incidents rose by 1.7%. Though the report cautioned against drawing premature conclusions as apparent increases in violence could simply reflect better data collection rather than real increases, figures show that contemporary xenophobia and bias crimes are on the rise. Moreover, the ‘observation of this apparent upward trend in extremist activity in Germany is supported by reports of increased right-wing attacks noted by victim support organizations,’ the report states. 53 Indeed, the figures given in the agency’s updated 2009 ‘RAXEN Report’ show a sharp increase in the number of extreme right-wing (+37%) and xenophobic (+43%) crimes in Germany compared to the previous year. 54 Equally alarming are the successes of right-wing extremists in elections in the former GDR. Evoking such notions as ‘Volksgemeinschaft’ and ‘German Reich,’\n\n14\n\nChristine Anton\n\nthe New Right movement aims to reinstate a traditional concept of German identity on the basis of an ethnocentric nationalism. The danger for Germany in its quest for a valid identity lies in the fact that it is a small step from nationalism to fanaticism. As has been the case with the German-Jewish community, Afro-Germans, too, have had to endure racism and discrimination in their adopted ‘Heimat,’ and like German Jews they too are struggling to have their voices heard. Similarly, while the German-Jewish community, mindful of its specific relationship with Germany, is trying to determine its cultural identity without having any other comparable ethnic group on which to model its identity, so do Afro-Germans live and work in a vacuum. But what makes it even more problematic for Afro-Germans is their lack of a common history. The first Africans came to Germany during the German colonial period; others are descendants of black soldiers who fought in Germany during the two world wars. The recent majority of Africans entered the country as asylum seekers. Thus, for them, ‘reclaiming their […] history in Germany is important because of the role history plays in shaping culture and identity.’ 55 Undoubtedly, because of their visible difference, these immigrants, like Turks and Muslims, are an easy target for mob violence. Though one might wonder if ‘the growth of rightwing radicalism and neo-Nazism [has] realigned the relationship between Jews and foreigners,’ 56 there is no proof that some form of solidarity among the various minority groups has emerged. It would certainly be ‘a mistake to designate all non-Germans with the allpurpose term Ausländer and to ignore the significant differences among the various groups by race, class, ethnicity, religion, and color,’ 57 yet the question needs to be addressed whether a spirit of commonality would affect immigration and cultural policies. Since the end of World War II, Germany, the country and its people, has come a long way. Yet, even though Germans today have ‘guten Grund, stolz auf [ihr] Land zu sein,’ as President Köhler remarked in his speech commemorating the sixtieth anniversary of the end of World War II, 58 and even naysayers have to admit that headlines regarding recent political developments, from electing a woman chancellor to changing laws for obtaining German citizenship, have generally been rather positive, Germany cannot and should not forget about the responsibility it inherited when its elected government committed crimes against humanity several decades ago. ‘Wenn deut-\n\nRepositioning German Identity\n\n15\n\nsche Verantwortung für Israel und für Juden Fundament und Dauer haben soll, dann muss sie in Deutschland von den beteiligten Generationen entwickelt und weitergegeben werden. Niemand sonst kann diese Arbeit übernehmen,’ Bodo Morshäuser writes. 59 The road ahead might be a bumpy one, unless Germany applies the lessons it learned over the last sixty-five years. This entails the acknowledgment that the country is rapidly becoming a hybrid, pluralistic nation, home to several minority groups who bring their own customs and traditions and thereby reshape the societal and cultural landscape. The very concept of nation, especially after the collapse of the Soviet Union and the wave of independence proclamations of former Warsaw Pact nations, nowadays is defined as a changeable construct impacted by political policies and cultural impulses. And just as many other European countries, Germany too has undergone a period of national self-reflection and search for identity. It is unquestionable that the ‘Nazi regime is the greatest historical burden on German identity,’60 however, the direction in which the country is heading will be determined by present and, even more importantly, future developments. It is, in Grass’s words, the ‘Vergegenkunft’ of history that has to form the framework in which the emerging new collective consciousness of Germany will occur. 61 It is unlikely that an end to the discussions and arguments about what characterizes a practical as well as practicable German identity is in sight. It is from those verbal battles that the country benefits most on its path to redefining itself. This ‘never-to-be-resolved debate’ is what James Young calls ‘the best German memorial to the fascist era and its victims.’ 62 Adorno and Enzenberger’s critique that Germans will forever refuse to seriously work through their past, thus can no longer be accepted as the final verdict. 63 Since unification, Germany’s soul-searching has taken on new dimensions and perspectives as a result of ‘an unprecedented amount of commemoration and remembrance’ 64 after 1989. Analogous to the reassessment of the GDR history after unification, National Socialism and the German questions of guilt and shame too have undergone reanalyses from new angles. New generations of writers and filmmakers are pushing at the boundaries of cultural taboos and political correctness and probe the complex collective consciousness with a view to ascertaining what constitutes the German nation today. They are challenging the status quo of the German ‘Vergangenheitsbewälti-\n\n16\n\nChristine Anton\n\ngung’ and seek to find new ways to make certain that Auschwitz will remain a ‘deeply felt obligation,’ but also no longer perceive ‘Auschwitz as a hindrance to achieving normalcy.’ 65 The younger generations in particular, whose parents and grandparents still were children during the Nazi years, differ in their historical outlook. They have enough distance to make room for the articulation of German wartime suffering and to recognize it as an integral part of Germany’s national identity. The decades-long resistance in post-war Germany to move beyond accepted views on memory, history and trauma, and on the victim/perpetrator binary has given way to experimenting with unorthodox criteria. History is after all a constantly changing construct. Certainly, ‘all of us who live in the shadow of the Holocaust are heirs to the memory of the past,’ yet at the same time we cannot refuse to accept the fact that ‘at each moment in time, this memory evolves and is newly interpreted.’ 66 This volume is a compilation of essays about Germany’s quest for a more stable and less contradictory sense of self. Outlining the increasingly open and uncensored debate about the German past, present and future, the contributions in this book discuss the possibilities and difficulties of achieving an objective and open discourse about the meaning and memory of the nation’s past – a past that many wish shall no longer solely be defined by its crimes and horrors. As such they strive to discuss important questions about German society and the very notion of what being German means in the age of globalization and the vanishing of nation-states in a continuously strengthening European Union; the question about what is German culture in a postmodern era; and how the past affects and shapes the present and future of hybrid German generations. These issues are analyzed through the perspectives of German, Jewish-German, and minority German writers and filmmakers.

It’s not a country that’s usually associated with warmth, hospitality, beauty, culture or fun, but the 2006 FIFA World Cup™ has definitely helped not only soften and boost Germany’s image, but also show its potential as a destination for fun and friendliness’ (http://www.nationbrandindex.com/nbi_q306-uk-press-release.phtml [accessed 23 March 2008]). A more recent survey from April 2010 by GlobeScan in collaboration with the Program on International Policy Attitudes at the University of Maryland reports that 59% of more than 29,000 people in twenty-eight countries thought that Germany was the country with the most positive influence in the world; see: http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/shared/bsp/hi/pdfs/160410bbcwspoll.pdf (accessed 31 May 2010).\n\n4\n\nFor many decades, Germany’s immigration laws were based upon the principle of jus sanguinis, the right by which citizenship could be obtained only if one was related to a German national by blood. When the country experienced an immense influx of immigrants in the 1990s, it became paramount to overhaul the old immigration policy and facilitate the integration of foreigners by adding the principle of jus soli, which accords a person the right to citizenship on the grounds of being born on German soil, thus granting citizenship to a large portion of German immigrants and migrant workers.\n\n5\n\nRoger de Weck, ‘Der deutsche Frühling’, Der Spiegel, 14 May 2007, 72.\n\n6\n\nIbid., p. 77.\n\n7 See for instance Konrad H.

One of the most famous ‘ratlines,’ the ODESSA escape route, allowed an estimated 10,000 former SSmembers to escape prosecution. The network of escape lines was assisted and supported by South American governments, chief among them Argentina and its President Juan Domingo Perón, as well as the Catholic Church. The most notorious war criminal who was aided by ODESSA was Adolf Eichmann, who eventually was captured in Argentina by Israeli intelligence agents in 1961. For information on ODESSA consult the Jewish Virtual Library at: http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org (accessed 3 January 2010). ‘Operation Paperclip’ was the code name for the transfer of German scientists and their families to the U.S. as early as summer 1945.

Though both Kohl and Reagan primarily viewed the visit as a symbolic gesture of friendship and reconciliation of former war enemies, the visit backfired when it became known to the public that among the German soldiers buried at the Kolmeshöhe cemetery were approximately fifty members of the Waffen-SS. Despite public outrage voiced by noted leaders within the Jewish community as well\n\n20\n\nChristine Anton\n\nas American veterans and their families, and even though both houses of the U.S. Congress opposed the visit and asked the president to revise his itinerary, Reagan refused to alter his plans, yet at the last minute added a stop at the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in an effort to placate his opponents. 20 Cf.

Mai war ein Tag der Befreiung. Er hat uns alle befreit von dem menschenverachtenden System der nationalsozialistischen Gewaltherrschaft.’ Though at the time Weizsäcker, for the most part, won high acclaim for his speech both at home and abroad, later criticism questioned Weizsäcker’s phrasing of events: ‘Es war keine Befreiung, denn der Krieg ist von den Alliierten nicht geführt worden, um Deutschland von Hitler zu befreien. […] Dieser Tag ist auch kein Tag der Niederlage, denn da ist nicht einfach eine Armee besiegt worden. Da hat eine Volksgemeinschaft bis zum bitteren Ende gekämpft und mußte bedingungslos kapitulieren.’ See: Spiegel-Interview with Jan Philipp Reemtsma titled ‘Eine gewisse Gemütlichkeit’, Der Spiegel, 1 May 1995, at: http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-9182786.html (accessed 31 December 2009). 21 A detailed account of the foundation’s purpose and its statutes can be found at: http://www.stiftung-evz.de/ueber-uns (accessed 11 August 2010). 22\n\nSee: http://www.stiftung-evz.de/eng/press/downloads/facts-and-figures (accessed 3 January 2010).\n\n23\n\nMarianne Hirsch, the first to use the term ‘postmemory,’ defines it as ‘distinguished from memory by generational distance and from history by deep personal connection. Postmemory is a powerful and very particular form of memory precisely because its connection to its object or source is mediated not through recollection but through an imaginative investment and creation. [...] Postmemory characterizes the experience of those who grow up dominated by narratives that preceded their birth, whose own belated stories are evacuated by the stories of the previous generation shaped by traumatic events that can be neither understood nor recreated.’ Marianne Hirsch, Family Frames. Photography, Narrative, and Postmemory, Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1997, p. 22. Dominick LaCapra distinguishes between primary memory as ‘that of a person who has lived through events and remembers them in a certain manner,’ and secondary memory as ‘the result of critical work on primary memory, whether by the person who initially had the relevant experiences or, more typically, by an analyst, observer, or secondary witness such as the historian.’ Dominick LaCapra, History and Memory after Auschwitz, Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1998, pp. 20-1. 24\n\nAs LaCapra remarks, ‘the preoccupation with memory may indicate a failure of constructive will and divert attention from the needs of the present and the necessity of attempting to shape the future’ (History and Memory, p. 8).\n\nRepositioning German Identity\n\n21\n\n25\n\nThe memorial was partially destroyed less than three months after the dedication ceremony on 27 May 2008.

The law was drafted because Spain’s civil war and the Franco regime have been a troublesome topic with which the nation never dealt publicly. Now the time has come to seriously debate this important part of Spanish history, ‘but with concern for the sensitivities on both sides on the political fence’ (Danny Wood, ‘Civil War legacy divides Spain’, BBC News, 18 July 2006, at: http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/pr/fr//2/hi/europe/5192228.stm [accessed 31 December 2009]). Thus, the wording of the law reflects just that: the desire to be all-inclusive in every respect. Article 2, ‘General Recognition,’ states: ‘Como expresión del derecho de todos los ciudadanos a la reparación moral y a la recuperación de su memoria personal y familiar, se reconoce y declara el carácter radicalmente injusto de todas las condenas, sanciones y cualesquiera formas de violencia personal producidas por razones políticas, ideológicas o de creencia religiosa, durante la Guerra Civil, así como las sufridas por las mismas causas durante la Dictadura.’ See: http://www.mpr.es/NR/rdonlyres/ D03898BE-21B8-4CB8-BBD1-D1450E6FD7AD/85567/boememoria.pdf (accessed 31 December 2009). 29\n\nVictor Klemperer, Ich will Zeugnis ablegen bis zum letzten.

Sebald and Jörg Friedrich The recent return of images of German suffering in the Second World War has been described as a renewed chance to finally mourn the German war dead. The following study critically examines the concept of trauma underlying this claim, and discusses the issue of trauma and mourning with respect to W.G. Sebald’s Luftkrieg und Literatur and Jörg Friedrich’s Der Brand and Brandstätten.\n\nPreliminary Remarks Disciplines that participate in what we call ‘memory studies’ – i.e., historiography, psychoanalysis, social anthropology, literary studies – operate, it seems, with two distinct and largely incompatible concepts of mourning in relation to the issue of German wartime memory. The first, and most widely used, is the Freudian model of remembering, repeating and working through, originating in individual psychology; the second is an implicit model of mourning as a public and performative ritual for the containment of excessive pain and loss, rituals that through symbolic actions inscribe this loss into a meaningful collective, national (or family) narrative. Robert G. Moeller, for example, asserts that the ‘silence’ regarding German suffering is a myth, stating that both East and West Germany ‘devoted considerable energy to assessing the losses and incorporating victim status into public memory, […] in the political arena and forms of commemoration, stories of German loss and suffering were ubiquitous.’ 1 Psychoanalysis, cultural studies and public discourse, however, frequently operate on the assumption that German losses have never been ‘properly’ mourned, due to either the severe trauma of the war or the instrumentalized and increasingly binary postwar guilt discourse, or both. 2 Propagators of a theory of silence about German suffering by reason of the belated nature of trauma generally follow both Sebald’s and the Mitscherlichs’ assertion of a nexus between guilt, shame, denial and trauma, re-accentuating the Mitscherlichs’ theses about the German ‘inability to mourn’ the Nazi victims and transferring it onto the Germans themselves. 3 The Mitscherlichs were first to hint at the problem of a nexus between denial of guilt and forms of remembrance\n\n28\n\nHelmut Schmitz\n\nof Germany’s own war dead: ‘Und obgleich sie ein ehrendes Gedenken finden, bleiben auch die Toten der Schlachtfelder und unserer gegen Ende des Krieges in Schutt und Asche versinkenden Städte hinter diesem Schleier des Unwirklichen.’ 4 However, they point out, the ‘settling of accounts’ mentality that was part and parcel of 1960s memory discourse is part of the narcissistic injury of losing the war and the loss of the narcissistic object Hitler: ‘Für Kriegstote, so hat man den Eindruck, wird die Erinnerung bei uns oft weit weniger aus Pietät denn aus der Absicht, Schuld aufzurechnen wachgehalten.’ 5 The feverish return of images of destroyed German cities subsequent to Sebald’s Luftkrieg und Literatur in 1999 has been described in terms both of the return of the repressed and traumatic images and the chance for a ‘proper’ (i.e., non-instrumentalized) form of mourning. 6 Aleida Assmann perceives the return of images and memories into the mainstream of public discourse as a ‘Rückgewinnung deutscher Opfererinnerungen aus ihrer Erstarrung und Verkapselung,’ arguing that these memories ‘had no chance to be communicated in their humane dimension and shared with empathy in the public sphere,’ as their inclusion in public memory had been blocked both by right-wing political instrumentalization of these memories and by the left’s resistance to acknowledging them. 7 Cora Stephan’s review of Jörg Friedrich’s Der Brand refers to the book in terms of classic rituals of mourning, as ‘ein Totengesang auf die verlorene Vergangenheit’ which ‘hinterlässt das Gefühl einer Trauer, die man teilen kann.’ 8 Mourning, however, is precisely the term Moeller uses for the public commemorative rituals of the 1950s, contending that the Germans ‘demonstrated a striking ability to mourn’ for their own losses. 9 Christian Groh testifies to an uninterrupted annual commemoration of the destruction in the city of Pforzheim, and Daniel Fulda points to the decennial commemoration of the firestorm in the city of Hamburg until 1973 when interest began to wane because of a generational shift and the aftermath of the student movement. 10 The tension or contradiction between these assessments appears to run along the fault line between a concept of mourning based on collective rites and rituals and one that operates within a framework of mass individual trauma that has not been adequately addressed due to the political instrumentalization of commemorative discourse. The argument that the commemorative rituals of the past do not constitute a ‘proper’ way of mourning as they are predominantly in the interest of nation-\n\nHistory, Trauma and Mourning in Sebald and Friedrich\n\n29\n\nbuilding, thereby side-stepping the issue of trauma, does seem somewhat disingenuous. Public commemorative rituals are by their very nature community-constitutive and involve political representation. In his book on funeral rhetoric, Donovan J. Ochs describes funeral rituals with their symbolic behavior and their rhetoric of consolation as ‘[a] culture’s single most potent “containment” practice.’ 11 Following David Kertzer’s definition of a ritual as ‘an action wrapped in a web of symbolism,’ Ochs comments that ‘comforting and alleviating the range of individuals’ distress, most certainly demands a “ritual wrapped in symbolism.”’ 12 Furthermore, according to Ochs, public commemorative rituals ‘also contain symbolic behaviours that redirect the participants’ future.’ 13 The frequent inscriptions of the destruction of Germany into either a Christian narrative of guilt and retribution, of apocalypse and hellfire, or a triumphant narrative of overcoming, survival and reconstruction, commonly found in both West and East Germany in the immediate post-war period, bear, one could argue, structural resemblance to symbolic and ritualized forms of mourning, with their future-oriented, tripartite structure of praise, lament and consolation that are in support of the coherence of collective and state. 14 There is, however, one central problem of inscribing post-war commemorative rituals into this tripartite structure. Due to the guilt of the war, praising the German dead as ‘Opfer’ in the sense of sacrifice was impossible. This not only left one part of the traditional tripartite mourning ritual unaddressed, it almost inevitably diverted the commemoration onto the concept of ‘Opfer’ in the sense of a passive and guiltless victim 15 of fate or violence, which brings the German dead into competition with victims of the Holocaust. W.G. Sebald and the Catastrophic Destruction of Experience With this in mind, let us turn to the issue of catastrophic history, trauma and mourning in W.G. Sebald’s Luftkrieg und Literatur and Jörg Friedrich’s Der Brand and his subsequent book of photographs, Brandstätten. Even though Sebald’s Zurich lectures of 1997, collected and extended in the volume Luftkrieg und Literatur, 16 have been extensively written on, a brief summary of his key arguments as they apply to this study shall follow. Sebald’s main thesis is that the Allied bombings have left little or no trace in both public and literary consciousness due to the orientation of the public towards reconstruction on the one hand, and the avoidance of the writers, both those of the\n\n30\n\nHelmut Schmitz\n\n‘inner emigration’ and those that constituted the ‘Gruppe 47’ on the other. Though Sebald does not deny the traumatic nature of the bombing experience and its devastating impact on the individual psyche, he does not ascribe the perceived lack of the ‘tieferen Verstörungen im Seelenleben der deutschen Nation’ (LL 19) to the legacy of trauma but to the legacy of denial and the nexus between suffering, guilt and collective shame which, he argues ‘richtete die Bevölkerung ausnahmslos auf die Zukunft aus und verpflichtete sie zum Schweigen über das, was ihr widerfahren war’ (LL 16). Sebald’s assessment of the silence about the true nature of the bombings thus broadly follows the Mitscherlichs’ theses of the ‘inability to mourn.’ Sebald’s lectures have been criticized for a number of reasons. Volker Hage has taken issue with the thesis of a lack of literary representation of the bombings. 17 Susanne Vees-Gulani and William Rasch have accused Sebald of ‘underestimating the level of complexity of the postwar situation for authors in respect to both the issue of guilt and the consequences of bombing trauma,’ 18 and Anette Seidel Arpacı has linked Sebald to revisionists due to his description of the ‘Luftkrieg’ as ‘in der Geschichte bis dahin einzigartige Vernichtungsaktion’ (LL 11), a term otherwise belonging to the context of the Holocaust. 19 By taking Seidel Arpacı’s argument a step further and into a slightly different direction, one arrives at asking the question in what way, or on what axis, the ‘Luftkrieg’ might be comparable to the Holocaust for Sebald himself, and what concept of history underscores Sebald’s considerations. Sebald’s lectures certainly conflate a sociopsychological analysis with a judgment of literary history. However, the socio-psychological and historical accuracy of Sebald’s assertion is of less interest than the inquiry into the conceptual framework with which Sebald is operating. Arguably, for Sebald, the ‘Luftkrieg,’ like Auschwitz, is part of a history of modernity as traumatic catastrophe in not primarily clinical terms. The concept of trauma currently in use in cultural and literary studies on the whole originates in clinical psychology with its aim to psychically restore the traumatized subject to a future-oriented existence through a form of therapy in which the trauma can come to be ‘owned.’ 20 Cathy Caruth describes clinical trauma as a ‘breach in the mind’s experience of time, self, and the world’ and as ‘experienced too soon, too unexpectedly, to be fully known and […] therefore not available to consciousness.’ 21 Sebald’s description of the bombings\n\nHistory, Trauma and Mourning in Sebald and Friedrich\n\n31\n\nappears to fit this clinical concept of trauma. The excessive and abrupt nature of the violent exertions on the body and the senses destroys the experience of the event itself: ‘Offenbar hatte unter dem Schock des Erlebten die Erinnerungsfähigkeit teilweise ausgesetzt’ (LL 31). As a result, the content of the experience does not enter the sensoria of the survivors (LL 13). However, Sebald’s assessment of the experience of bombing victims only appears to be in keeping with a clinical concept of trauma. A clinical concept of trauma operates not only with a symptomatology that locates the authenticity of the experience in a repeated and compulsive acting out of displaced symptoms, but also operates with an ethics of listening that, at least potentially, allows for a therapeutic overcoming of the trauma in narrative. 22 None of this is of interest to Sebald since he considers the survivors to be ‘unzuverlässige, mit halber Blindheit geschlagene Zeugen’ (LL 31), attesting the survivors’ reports an ‘inhärente[s] Ungenügen’ and ‘notorische[] Unzuverlässigkeit’ (LL 86). Even though Sebald admits in the afterword that survivors’ reports might articulate ‘traumatic experience,’ he considers them useless for ascertaining the dimensions of the ‘catastrophe’ as they are full of ‘stereotypical turns of phrases’ as a result of the overlapping of coping mechanisms and the ‘inability to mourn’ (LL 86). 23 This means that in contrast to contemporary trauma theory, for Sebald the destruction of experience in the traumatic shock of the bombings is absolute. The loss of experience is irrecoverable due to the alleged lack of precise and painful memory work in the post-war period. The shock-like aspect of the experience of aerial bombings incapacitates the witnesses and thus invalidates their testimony, unlike with survivors of the Holocaust. Despite the wording of ‘einzigartige Vernichtungsaktion,’ Luftkrieg und Literatur operates with a rather clear and categorical distinction between Holocaust survivors and air war survivors with respect to testimonial authenticity. In contrast to Holocaust testimony, survivor reports of the bombings render it obvious ‘dass es unmöglich ist, die Tiefen der Traumatisierung in den Seelen derer auszuloten, die aus den Epizentren der Katastrophe entkamen’ (LL 95). Sebald’s repeatet use of the term ‘Katastrophe’ (it occurs six times in the text [LL 51; 22; 31; 70; 75; 95]) and of ‘Erfahrungsblindheit’ (LL 27) – ‘es geschieht alles zu geschwind’ (LL 29) –, as well as his focus on the body in Lufkrieg und Literatur suggest a Benjaminian\n\n32\n\nHelmut Schmitz\n\nframework of both modern warfare as destructive of experience, because of its impact on the body, and of history as catastrophe: Konnte man damals nicht die Feststellung machen: die Leute kamen verstummt aus dem Felde? Nicht reicher, ärmer an mitteilbarer Erfahrung. […] Eine Generation, die noch mit der Pferdebahn zur Schule gefahren war, stand unter freiem Himmel in einer Landschaft, in der nichts unverändert geblieben war als die Wolken, und in der Mitte, in einem Kraftfeld zerstörender Ströme und Explosionen, der winzige gebrechliche Menschenkörper. 24\n\nFor Benjamin, the endless recurrence of shocks in a modernity shaped by technology destroys communicable experience because of the collapse of the mental apparatus’ protection from stimuli. 25 This destruction is final and cannot be recuperated, except through highly artificial means of concentration and memory work. Adorno has explicitly connected Benjamin’s theory of experience to World War II which begins ‘in jeder Phase von vorn’: Überall, mit jeder Explosion hat er den Reizschutz durchbrochen, unter dem Erfahrung, die Dauer zwischen heilsamem Vergessen und heilsamem Erinnern sich bildet. Das Leben hat sich in eine zeitlose Folge von Schocks verwandelt. 26\n\nHence, if the Holocaust contains the ‘truth of modernity’ regarding the rationalistic and bureaucratic administering of mass extermination, 27 the ‘Lufkrieg’ contains the truth about modernity as technological catastrophe: the destruction of experience. In his 1982 essay ‘Zwischen Geschichte und Naturgeschichte,’ the origin of Luftkrieg und Literatur, Sebald argues ‘dass Erfahrung im realen Sinn aufgrund der überwältigenden Rapidität und Totalität der Zerstörung schlechterdings nicht möglich war.’ 28 Sebald thus allocates the ‘Luftkrieg’ a form of traumatic excess that is analogous, though not identical, to the Holocaust as a signature of modernity’s barbarous rule by technology. In this he follows Benjamin’s and Adorno’s reading of the destructive potential of a modernity ruled by technological as inherent in its structural logic: ‘die Konsequenz der übergeordneten Produktionszwänge [...] ist die ruinierte Stadt’ (LL 72). 29 If for Sebald, technological warfare, ‘Krieg in seiner unverhohlenen Form’ (LL 27), is just as much a signature of modernity as the Holocaust, his disappointment with the available literary, historiographical and local historical material attains another dimension if placed next to his unequivocal approval of writings by Auschwitz survivors such as Primo Levi and Jean Améry and of Peter Weiss, all\n\nHistory, Trauma and Mourning in Sebald and Friedrich\n\n33\n\nof whom feature centrally in Sebald’s literary universe. 30 In his essay on Améry, Sebald affirms the central topos of Holocaust testimony and its reception, the crediting of the survivor with the complete moral authority of witness with regard to the ‘experience’ of the camp, despite the repeated problems of ‘translating’ the traumatizing experience into language. 31 Sebald refers to Jean Améry’s ‘irreparable Verfassung […] aus der allein die wahre Natur des Terrors mit einiger Präzision sich ablesen lässt.’ 32 He points out that Holocaust survivors are plagued by ‘Hyperamnesie’ and as a result have no access to the mechanisms of denial that so characterized the post-war German mentality: ‘Im Gegensatz zu den Agenten des Terrors verfügen sie offensichtlich nicht mehr über zuverlässige Mechanismen der Verdrängung’ (N 153). What Sebald appears to miss is a narrative or representation of the ‘Luftkrieg’ that communicates the essentially disruptive and catastrophic nature on a linguistic, stylistic and intellectual level analogous to Holocaust literature. Just like Benjamin who contended that it is only the poet who can either artificially restitute the ‘narrator’ in modernity (i.e., Proust) or capture the signature of the destruction of experience (i.e., Baudelaire), it is the writers who in Sebald’s view inherit the task of communicating the dimensions of the destruction since the witnesses are all unreliable: ‘die Überladung der Denk- und Gefühlskapazität […] bedürfen der Ergänzung durch das, was sich erschließt unter einem synoptischen, künstlichen Blick’ (LL 33); or, as Sebald puts it in the 1982 essay: ‘eine Beschreibung der Katastrophe [ist] eher von ihrem Rand her als aus ihrem Zentrum heraus möglich.’ 33 The transmission of the true scope of the horrors thus needs a mediator; the ‘real’ witness to the extent of the destruction is not the survivor but the ‘Zeugenschaft der Schriftsteller’ (LL 75). 34 However, due to their concern with the retouching of their self-image in a postNazi society, the German writers fail to adequately describe ‘das, was sie gesehen hatten.’ Sebald asserts that ‘sie kaum ein Auge zu haben schienen für die allerorten sichtbaren Schrecken der Zeit’ (LL 17). Consequently, ‘was das in Wahrheit bedeutet, wissen wir nicht’ (N 5). 35 Sebald’s categorical dismissal of the writers has to be read in conjunction with his judgment of German writers’ attempts at a literary appropriation of the Holocaust. These are dismissed on the same terms as the literature on the bombings: ‘literarische Kommentare zur Endlösung (sic!), in denen pauschale und lyrische Gesten\n\n34\n\nHelmut Schmitz\n\nein genaueres Verständnis der entsetzlichen Vorgänge oft unterbinden’ (N 150). 36 Sebald’s critique of German culture’s inability to capture the dimensions of the horrors of the destruction more precisely is based on his dismissal of its attempts to inscribe these horrors into a meaningful narrative of reconstruction: ‘Nicht als das grauenvolle Ende einer kollektiven Aberration erscheint also diese totale Zerstörung, sondern, sozusagen, als die erste Stufe des Wiederaufbaus’ (LL 14). In contrast to German culture’s inscription of the ‘Luftkrieg’ into a historical narrative of reconstruction, Jean Améry’s account as an Auschwitz survivor is praised for its determined refusal to strike up a compromise with history and time, something Sebald describes as ‘ein unabdingbares Element einer wahrhaft kritischen Perspektive auf die Vergangenheit’ (N 160), and as ‘Notwendigkeit eines anhaltenden Protests, eine Dimension, die der deutschen Nachkriegsliteratur so auffallenderweise mangelte’ (N 159). The impression that Sebald equates the ethical dimensions of literature about the ‘Luftkrieg’ with those of Holocaust literature is underscored by the stylistic judgments Sebald makes on both. According to Sebald, both non-Jewish German attempts to write about the Holocaust as well as literary accounts of the bombings lack the ‘sprachliche Präzision’ (N 165), ‘Sachlichkeit’ (N 156) and ‘die dem Gegenstand angemessene Ernsthaftigkeit der Sprache’ (N 150) of Améry’s or Peter Weiss’s work from which alone, Sebald claims, a clearer image of the catastrophe can be gleaned. A brief glance at Sebald’s assessment of virtually the only form of narrative of which he unequivocally approves, a form of documentary writing, that is, confirms this point. In the 1982 essay, Hans-Erich Nossack and Hermann Kasack are praised for those parts of their texts that remain free from attempts of transfiguring the ‘alle künstlerische Imagination übersteigende Erfahrung’ into something meaningful, instead opting for a ‘“leidenschaftslose Art der Rede”’ that can give witness or ‘Rechenschaft.’ 37 Singled out in both the 1982 essay and Luftkrieg und Literatur is Alexander Kluge’s Der Luftangriff auf Halberstadt that in its distanced precision reproduces the ‘entsetzensstarre [Blick] des Engels der Geschichte’ from Benjamin’s ‘Über den Begriff der Geschichte.’ Simultaneously, while Kluge maintains the ‘für jede Erkenntnis unabdingbare Distanz’ (LL 73), his own self-doubts testify to the breaking down of epistemological concepts in the face of absolute and unimaginable horrors, the ‘auf keinen Begriff mehr zu\n\nHistory, Trauma and Mourning in Sebald and Friedrich\n\n35\n\nbringende[] Welt’ (LL 17). Kluge’s text eschews both the ‘Versuch einer Sinngebung des Sinnlosen’ by mythification (LL 55), something Sebald criticizes in Kasack, Peter de Mendelssohn and others, as well as the unmediated and graphic representation of horrors which he describes as ‘voyeuristic’ and near pornographic (LL 104). This is reminiscent of Sebald’s affirmation of Améry’s account that stresses ‘eher den monumentalen Irrsinn der an ihm vorgenommenen Prozedur als das Pathos des Leidens’ (N 155) and of Peter Weiss’s distanced gaze on Auschwitz, to which Sebald explicitly refers to as ‘angemessene Darstellung’ (N l), while he refers to Kluge’s enterprise as ‘Ermittlung,’ the title of Peter Weiss’s play about the 1963 Auschwitz trial in Frankfurt. 38 The Zurich lectures end with the poignant reference to thesis IX of Benjamin’s ‘Über den Begriff der Geschichte’ which describes the ‘storm’ of technological progress as ‘eine einzige Katastrophe, die unablässig Trümmer auf Trümmer häuft.’ 39 What Sebald misses among non-Jewish German war narratives is, firstly, the decisive creation of a form of writing that emerges in confrontation with the ethical question of rendering intelligible the catastrophe in analogy to (specifically German) Holocaust texts, such as Améry’s essayistic style or Weiss’s austere documentary aesthetics. 40 Secondly, Sebald implies that the only adequate response to the dimensions of catastrophe, both literary and philosophically, would have been a form of melancholia that denies and rejects the continuity of time after the catastrophe, a form of resentment and ‘Traurigkeit,’ he encountered in, for example, Wolfgang Hildesheimer but also in Jean Améry and Peter Weiss. Sebald’s positive assessment of Heinrich Böll’s posthumously published novel Der Engel schwieg is, again, couched in terms analogous to his writing on Hildesheimer, Améry and Weiss. Sebald speaks of Böll’s ‘von unheilbarer Schwermut geprägte Erzählung,’ its imagery typifying the ‘gegen jeden Überlebenswillen gerichteten acedia cordis, jener fahlen, nicht mehr zu behebenden Depression in die die Deutschen hätten verfallen müssen’ (LL 18). 41 Sebald, together with Kluge, laments the absence of a representation of the ‘Luftkrieg’ as ‘lesbare Chiffre’ (LL 12), as a legible sign of absence. Equally, Sebald seems to miss the absence of a foundational narrative of destruction based on never fully recuperable and translatable experiences. According to Gabriel Motzkin and\n\n36\n\nHelmut Schmitz\n\nAvishai Margalit, this is the analogy between the ‘Luftkrieg’ and the Holocaust as ‘negative myth of origin,’ 42 a narrative that avoids inscription into a self-pacifying narrative of reconstruction from the ruins. Friedrich and the Recapturing of the Air War If for Sebald the true history and dimensions of the bombings are irretrievably lost, Jörg Friedrich’s Der Brand is an attempt to recapture it in all its breadth and thereby provide the foundational narrative Sebald asserts is absent. 43 Historians have severely criticized Friedrich’s book for his implicit rhetorical equation of the bombings with the Holocaust, his lack of historicization and for his leveling of moral positions in suggesting that the air war was a war crime. 44 Brad Prager, for example, contrasts Friedrich’s account with Sebald’s Luftkrieg und Literatur, arguing that Friedrich’s works ‘encourage readers to identify only with ordinary Germans’ and ‘retreat from moral selfexamination.’ Sebald’s argument in Luftkrieg und Literatur, on the other hand, is ‘well taken’ due to his insertion of the aerial bombardment into a history of catastrophic modernity that has close ties with the Frankfurt School’s reading of history. 45 While this is certainly correct, Prager underplays Friedrich’s own reliance on a reading of the air war as a culmination of the inhuman rationalist logic of modern warfare. Der Brand operates with frequent residual Frankfurt School vocabulary that inscribes the air war into a catastrophic history of modernity: the bombings are addressed as ‘Zivilisationsbruch’ (B 169) and as ‘Neo-Barbarei der Moderne’ (B 277). Friedrich focuses in detail on the scientific aspects of the development of the firestorm. The fire-bomb is the first ‘ganz und gar von Wissenschaftlern gelenkte Waffe’ which requires an ‘erdachtes Konzept der Vernichtung’ (B 25; emph. added). Apart from the suggestion that the Allies work with a concept of extreme annihilation, what is important for Friedrich’s account of the ‘Luftkrieg’ is that it is the first war that is operated and conceptualized entirely by technocrats. Friedrich’s image of the military background of the air war is that of an all-out war dominated by technological possibilities, where personal misgivings in Bomber Command or among scientists researching the firestorm have no ethical consequences (B 58). The air war is thus a ‘Verhängnis’ of modernity (B 67), a ‘Konsequenz des Industriezeitalters’ (B 76). Friedrich reads the air war as a logical\n\nHistory, Trauma and Mourning in Sebald and Friedrich\n\n37\n\nresult of the rationality of modern warfare that follows ‘Zweckmäßigkeiten’ (B 124) to the point that the Allied strategy is even applied to cities of allied France, like Le Havre, Rouen and Caen. If the air war is a logical consequence of increasing sophistication of warfare technology, the analogy with the Holocaust as an industrial form of mass extermination is almost a matter of rhetorical logic. Friedrich’s assertion that a bombing victim ‘stirbt nicht seinen Tod, denn es hat keinen’ (B 84), and his insistence on the principle of absolute equalization of bombing attacks that do not distinguish between guilty and guiltless, is a restatement of Adorno’s observation that the industrial and technological mass murder of the Holocaust represents the ‘absolute transformation’ of the individual into a nonentity destined to be exterminated. 46 Friedrich’s account is thus closer to Sebald’s than one might think at first. The crucial difference between both writers, however, apart from Friedrich’s implicit and explicit likening of the Bomber Command to war criminals, is with respect to the concept of trauma and its expressibility. While Friedrich essentially follows Sebald in his attestation of a continuing ‘Emotionslähmung’ (B 505) and the rebuilding of German cities as a form of repression (an ‘Abkehr vor der Szenerie’ [B 505]), he refers to the history of the bombings as ‘nichtangeeignete Geschichte’ (B 218) in terms of a task that the book itself sets out to master by recounting the horrors of the ‘Luftkrieg’ in the ‘Leideform’ (B 543). Moreover, in contrast to Sebald, Friedrich refers to the memories of the ‘experiential generation’ as a kind of receptacle in which the experiences lie ‘aufbewahrt,’ untouched, due to their preservation as a result of traumatic shock (B 542). This goes hand in hand with a concept of trauma that can be worked through in a therapeutic act of narration, thereby retrieving the experience in its authentic form: ‘Die erinnerten Szenen überliefern eine Folter, die nicht auf immer unaussprechlich sein wird’ (B 505). Indeed, the graphic imaginative and empathetic retelling of the plight of bombing victims aspires to be this ‘aussprechen’ itself. In a crucial shift from preterite to present and to first person singular, Friedrich’s attempt to retell the horrific excess of traumatic experience obliterates the distinction between author, narrator and victim: ‘Nur in Realzeit kann ich reagieren. […] Das Erforderliche verbringe ich wie außerhalb meiner selbst’ (B 500; 502).\n\n38\n\nHelmut Schmitz\n\nThe very opening of Friedrich’s book is indicative of his endeavor to reproduce an account of the air war ‘as it really was.’ Friedrich begins in medias res – there is no foreword, no discussion of method, no narrative distance. The lines between historiography and fictional narrative are continuously blurred by the use of an experiential present tense. The reader is plunged right into the events: ‘In dem Bombenvisier einer viermotorigen “Lancaster” ist eine Stadt wie Wuppertal aus sechstausend Meter Höhe nicht sichtbar. Die Bewohner haben sie abgedunkelt, ein Dunstschleier hüllt die Talmulde ein’ (B 13). Throughout, Friedrich’s account is interspersed with unreferenced witness statements. Der Brand is characterized by a narrative voice that seamlessly blends a variety of styles from documentation and reporting to omniscient narration and free indirect style. His use of present tense and jump cuts approximates the narrative to the type of contemporary documentary television drama that switches between witness statements and re-enacted events. The center of Der Brand is the section titled ‘Land’ which makes up more than a third of the book (B 177-370). ‘Land’ recounts in detail, and in exhaustingly repetitive fashion, the destruction of over thirty German cities from Aachen to Xanten. The lamenting tone of this section recalls the beauties and cultural treasures of the destroyed cities, the churches, libraries and public buildings, and has afforded the book the epithet of a ‘Totengesang auf die verlorene Vergangenheit,’ a ‘pilgrimage’ in Robert G. Moeller’s words. 47 The description of the destruction of cities like Bremen, Lübeck and Paderborn is combined with references to a long historical memory regarding the history that produced the cities’ cultural treasures: Paderborn lies ‘an den Quellen abendländischen Gedenkens’ (B 200), Hildesheim is ‘das Kleinod der deutschen Städtefamilie’ (B 207). Throughout the text, the bombings are likened to both the destruction visited upon Germany by the Thirty Years’ War and the Huns’ sacking of the Rhine and Mosel region in the fifth century. Friedrich’s appeal to Germany’s medieval and seventeenth-century history has two functions. First and foremost, it creates a historical analogy whereby the British bombers, throwing fire from the air, appear as the real Huns. 48 Secondly, the grief over the disappearance of the medieval, renaissance and baroque beauty of Germany’s cities insinuates an unbroken, homogeneous historical continuity that turns the air war into an unparalleled loss of history. Friedrich refers to the\n\nHistory, Trauma and Mourning in Sebald and Friedrich\n\n39\n\n‘Einheit von Raum und Geschichte’ (B 519) present before the air war, suggesting that the purpose of the bombings was the final destruction of Germany’s historical identity (B 177): ‘Deutschland wird verwüstet wie noch keine Zivilisation zuvor’ (B 120). The repeated descriptions of the lost German treasures can be read as a form of lamentation, an attempt to re-cathect the lost historical substance, similar to a litany. In this, Der Brand can be partially configured along the lines of ‘funeral rhetoric’ with its tripartite structure of praise, lament and consolation. And, like funeral rhetoric, Der Brand operates with a concept of a rather homogeneous cultural collective, the ‘Wir.’ Not only is ‘Wir’ the title of one of the book’s sections, it also intimates a collective that excludes everything and everyone that was not the target of the bombs and that erases the heterogeneity of the dead, Friedrich otherwise asserts. 49 However, whereas in the 1950s it was the aspect of praise that was missing from rituals of public mourning, Friedrich’s focus on traumatic excess refuses the consolation that is part of funeral rhetoric. Friedrich’s book of photographs Brandstätten repeats this rhetorical structure. 50 The book opens with a section titled ‘Früher’ that features the ‘whole’ German cities with their scenic old centers. This is contrasted with a section titled ‘Heute’ at the end of the book which juxtaposes old city centers with their contemporary counterparts. The juxtaposition of medieval, renaissance or baroque splendor with postmodern non-spaces that make up contemporary city centers willfully obscures the history of city planning between 1950 and 1990, and stages the air war as the sole origin of the contemporary lack of spatial identity. The rhetorical function of Friedrich’s positioning of the photographs is, again, to eschew the consolation of the ‘Wiederaufbau’ that characterizes so many earlier accounts. Rather than being triumphant documents of post-war reconstruction, the photographs of contemporary German cities, set against their pre-war ‘wholeness,’ testify to the continuity of trauma. It also becomes evident that the ugly inner cities of contemporary Germany are the symbolic expression of the state of the collective German spirit become concrete: ‘Das Narbengewebe, das die Brache des Luftkriegs bedeckt, ist auch der Überzug der deutschen Seelenlandschaft’ (BS 225).
