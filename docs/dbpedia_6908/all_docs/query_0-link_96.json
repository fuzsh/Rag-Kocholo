        "text": "From New German Cinema to the Postwall Cinema of Consensus\n\nby Eric Rentschler\n\nI.A New Cinema for a New Germany?\n\nGermany has enjoyed a privileged status in discussions about national cinema. No other cinema, in fact, has lent itself so consistently and productively to investigations into the relations between film and nationhood. New German Cinema, most critics would agree, constitutes the most recent chapter in this national cinema's compelling and controversial saga. Dozens of books and hundreds of articles in many languages celebrate New German Cinema's achievements. In the early 1990s, lavish exhibitions in Frankfurt and Berlin commemorated its hallmarks and, in so doing, certified its status as a thing of the past. I would like to consider the continuation of this story, to account for what has come in the wake of New German Cinema. German films, between sixty and seventy features a year in fact, are still being made, watched, and talked about. How does one speak of national cinema in Germany today and how does this discourse relate to the ways in which people once spoke of a previous epoch's national cinema?\n\nThis is no easy matter for we have at present no convincing paradigms or even useful catch phrases. Is post-New German Cinema simply to be situated within an unchartable (\"unübersichtlich\") landscape, a site without signposts, a post-histoire locus where all is familiar, foregone, and forgettable? The cultural landscape in Germany, claims Jürgen Habermas, is \"a desert of banality and bewilderment.\"i The scene he describes is moribund and amorphous, divested of the topical impetus and utopian resolve which once energized the New German Cinema. The German film industry's present self-estimation, however, bears no trace of Habermas's cultural discontent. \"German film is on the move,\" rejoices a perky pamphlet that appeared after a dramatic (albeit ephemeral) box-office breakthrough in 1997. During the first quarter of that year the success of four movies (Jenseits der Stille/Beyond Silence, Knockin' on Heaven's Door, Rossini, and Kleines Arschloch/Little Asshole) yielded an unheard-of thirty-seven percent German share of the domestic film market.ii Above all the comedies of the mid-1990s have, in the upbeat phrases of lobbyists, \"reawakened spectator interest for German films and also created a demand for other kinds of genre films. Young actors and actresses provide strong points of identification and new directorial talents bring fresh air to movie screens and television monitors.\"iii Such high spirits about a national film revival have nothing in common with Habermas's grim prospects; at best they confirm his ironic assertion that \"The German 'sense of being special' is regenerating itself hour by hour.\"iv\n\nHow are we to describe, much less comprehend, German national cinema in the 1990s? Beyond Habermas's less than precise cultural topography, another perspective poses itself, although its approach is not altogether unrelated. Its impetus is as tempting as it is predictable and obvious, especially for a former American friend of the New German Cinema like myself. In this scenario I look back at the alternative cinema of Fassbinder, Herzog, Kluge, Wenders, von Trotta, Sanders-Brahms, and others with an ardent nostalgia, regarding the popular cinema that has replaced it with a marked disdain and a bitter sense of loss. To do this is to remain the captive of former enthusiasms which even in the past prompted serious critical objections (e.g., about these films' negotiations of history, gender, and otherness). We know that \"New German Cinema\" above all constituted a potent mythical construction, replete with a heroic historical narrative driven by hero-directors, an international coproduction of domestic supporters and foreign enthusiasts which played an essential role in the legitimation and continuing existence of an otherwise unpopular minor cinema. More tempered responses to the dynamics of this myth-making process (much less to the workings of New German films) were common already in the early 1980s. To embrace this myth uncritically today means potentially to ignore past insights as well as perspectives that have subsequently surfaced--a decided drawback for any film historian. Let my point of departure, therefore, be one that avoids dismissiveness and nostalgia without denying my own critical bias. I want to begin with a simple question in the hope that it might lead to less obvious conclusions: What factors and determinations have produced present-day German conceptions of a national cinema?\n\nTo answer this question I will need to rehearse the strong tension between New German Cinema and the cinema that now stands for Germany in media representations, to analyze how New German Cinema came apart and how recent German cinema came into being. In the process I want to consider shifting constructions of a national cinema and the ways they have assumed shape in relation to a host of determinants. Finally, I would like to discuss these quite divergent conceptions of national cinema in terms that take us beyond previous impasses and that perhaps might afford us more analytical forms of historical understanding.\n\nII. Frontlines\n\n\"Something or other was simply not right about German filmmakers and their actors. A collective plague had left them incapable of representing conflict.\"v The litany is familiar; the critique related in Dieter Schwanitz's novel, Der Campus, is alternately sharp (\"simply not right\") and fuzzy (\"something or other\"). Journalists, cineastes, and intellectuals at large have frequently rebuked German filmmakers for ignoring the nation's social problems and political debates. Contemporary productions, they tell us, studiously and systematically skirt the 'large' topics and hot issues: the messy complications of post-wall reality, thematics like right-wing radicalism, chronic unemployment, or the uneasy integration of the former GDR into the Federal Republic. And, to be sure, prominent directors like Sönke Wortmann insist that their priorities as filmmakers lie elsewhere. Questioned about the lack of German reality in German films, Wortmann becomes snappish: \"Germany, as it really is. . . If I want to see that, I'll switch on the evening news.\"vi .\n\nContemporary German cinema, writers like Georg Seeßlen, Andreas Kilb, and Kraft Wetzel have been saying for more than a decade, is vapid and anemic, devoid of substance, conviction, and deeper meaning. Projects nowadays, maintains insider Reinhard Hauff, have no dialectical volition, no driving passion, no compelling justification: \"In the case of most films it works like this: someone finds subsidy money and a well-disposed tv editor, he then finds a producer who sorts out the rest of the financing, and before you know it you have yet another German film. Another German film without any real dramatic or emotional conflicts.\"vii Domestic fare is dominated by a formula-bound profusion of romantic comedies, crude farces, road movies, action films, and literary adaptations. This cinema is above all star-driven, peopled with the familiar faces of Katja Riemann, Til Schweiger, Joachim Król, Maria Schrader, Martina Gedeck, and Meret Becker.viii\n\nIn the 1980s only a handful of German films, almost without exception comedies featuring television stars (Otto Waalkes, Didi Hallervorden, Gerhard Polt, and Loriot), various installments of Die Supernasen/The Super Noses and Zärtliche Chaoten/Three Crazy Jerks, and features starring Mantas and Trabis, would become box-office hits. During the next decade comedies would constitute the most prominent factor in German cinema's public profile. In representative features like Abgeschminkt/Makin' Up, Stadtgespräch/Local Call, and Das Superweib/Superwoman, we find young upscale urbanites working in a sector of the culture industry. The protagonists--attractive, successful and around thirty--run up against the reality principle and confront the responsibilities of the adult world. The narratives occupy the liminal space between a bohemian everyday and a bourgeois existence; in this regard they represent post-1968 panoramas. As Karl Prümm puts it, New German comedies \"move between the makeshift student life style that one is loathe to give up and the fixed professional security that one aspires to, but dislikes, between rundown communes and well-appointed penthouses.\"ix These films focus on identity crises which are in fact pseudo-crises for they have no depth of despair, no true suffering, no real joy. With their triangulated desires and mismatched partners, their schematic constellations and formulaic trajectories, these yuppie comedies of errors follow strictly codified patterns.\n\nDomestic diversions that stay close to home, they play it by the (German) book. Recent German films, claim critics, are out of touch with the world at large and the larger world. And perhaps for that reason they do not travel well no matter how strong their domestic appeal. (Maybe, Maybe Not, the signal German success of the 1990s, had a painstakingly prepared American release whose returns were decidedly meager. Run, Lola, Run fared very well in the United States, but even this great exception was a resounding flop in France.)x Over the last decade new titles from the Federal Republic have all but vanished from the New York Film Festival, the catalogues of U.S. distributors, and North American arthouse programs.xi Despite its resonance at home, the New German Genre Cinema, in the mind of its detractors, is bland and provincial, infantile and harmless.xii Ideological opponents castigate this cinema for its lack of oppositional energies and critical voices, seeing it as an emanation of an overdetermined German desire for normalcy as well as of a marked disinclination towards any serious political reflection or sustained historical retrospection.\n\nWhile deploring the present state of affairs, commentators (especially those of an older generation) frequently hold up New German Cinema as an object of comparison and a positive alternative, fondly recalling its stylistic idiosyncrasy, narrative subversion, and political rebellion. German films of the sixties and seventies (e.g., Nicht versöhnt, Unreconciled, Der junge Törless/Young Törless, Abschied von gestern/Yesterday Girl, and Die Ehe der Maria Braun/The Marriage of Maria Braun) seen from this nostalgic vantage point, militated against collective forgetting, taking leave of a problematic national past by constantly problematizing that past's presence, turning against mindless escapism and crude commercialism, insisting that films need not only serve as pliers of distraction but rather might operate as time machines and critical vehicles.\n\nA body of films conscious of its own status as a part of German film history, New German Cinema coalesced as a collective and, in crucial regards, a programmatic endeavor. Films, in the understanding of the generation born shortly after 1945, the cohort that instigated the student movement, did not just tell stories and orchestrate effects; they interrogated images of the past in the hope of refining memories and catalyzing changes. At some point, Fassbinder was fond of saying, films must cease just being films and stories and come alive, so that spectators take pause to ponder their own persons and question their own lives. New German Cinema was challenging and unsettling, which in part explains why it found such a modest domestic following. It was taken seriously abroad because it was spurned at home; it was a curious cultural ambassador which at its best spoke for the nation by speaking (indeed: acting out) against it. Critics who fondly look back at the New German film generally have a far dimmer view of recent productions from the Federal Republic.\n\nThe New German Cinema, on the other hand, gets little respect from people who champion the films of Rainer Kaufmann, Dominik Graf, Doris Dörrie, Sönke Wortmann, Katja von Garnier, Joseph Vilsmaier, Helmut Dietl, and Detlev Buck. These industry partisans reject the Autorenkino's arrogance and introspection, its artistic indulgence, intellectual pompousness, and economic incapacity. For most German taxpayers, New German Cinema generated strained seriousness and sensory deprivation, films that appealed to minds rather than to emotions, that sought to enlighten rather than to entertain. For the average viewer New German features were slapdash and soporific, irritating and downright hard to look at, prone to protracted long takes and confusing plot lines, to undernarrated stories, unappealing characters, and unsatisfying conclusions. New German Cinema's richness, its adherents were fond of saying, lay in its diversity. In the minds of its assailants, however, this diversity remained an empty assertion. How rich could a cinema be if it had no gripping stories or sympathetic figures, if it denied its viewers pleasant evenings in the dark?xiii\n\nThe supporters of today's mainstream filmmakers applaud a German cinema that has a much lighter touch and is far more user-friendly. This new cinema cultivates familiar genres and caters to popular tastes. At no price do its purveyors wish to come off as rarified or esoteric, to challenge or disconcert their public in the manner of the New German militia. Rather than intervening or speaking out, self-avowed professionals like Dörrie, Graf, and Wortmann engross and accommodate. They want the cinema to be a site of mass diversion, not a moral institution or a political forum. Quite emphathically, the most prominent directors of the postwall era aim to please, which is to say that they consciously solicit a new German consensus. In this sense the cinema they champion is one with a decidedly affirmative calling.\n\nIII. From Autorenfilm to the Designer World\n\nIn current discussions, then, there is a marked divide between the New German Cinema and its successor, what I am calling the German Cinema of Consensus. Let us consider more carefully some of the key factors that have made for their quite different assumptions and operations.\n\n1. The waning of the cinema of authors: Since its institutionalization in the wake of the Oberhausen Manifesto, the German Autorenkino proved to be a precarious entity, invariably in crisis and frequently under attack. The death of Fassbinder in June 1982 vanquished the all too rarely realized hope that New German auteurs might mediate between the personal and the popular, the radical and the accessible, the alternative and the mainstream. In the words of critic Manfred Etten: \"Fassbinder's life and work was a model which seemed to embody and 'realize' the founding myths of New German Film. The loss of this model makes it poignantly clear that these myths no longer are in effect. By dint of his mere presence he constantly reminded people what New German Film as a whole (perhaps) might have become. In this sense Fassbinder was not only the calling card of New German Film, but also its guilty conscience.\"xiv Fassbinder, claimed Wolfram Schütte, was the heart of New German Film, \"the pulsating, vibrating core.\" With his death this heart had \"now stopped beating.\"xv\n\nThe demise of New German Cinema was in any case overdetermined and, in most observers' minds, long overdue. Fassbinder's passing coincided with the arrival of Friedrich Zimmermann and a shift in government film politics. By the early 1980s, New German Cinema had by and large lost its small audience and its counter public sphere. Outside of limited festival exposure and obscure television screenings, its presence was limited to an ever dwindling number of exhibition sites. With a CDU/CSU/FDP coalition firmly in power by March 1983, the new Minister of the Interior (whose charge included administering federal film subsidies and the annual state film prizes), Zimmermann (CSU), declared war on the Autorenfilm, insisting on popular movies that would appeal to the average German taxpayer.xvi Outraged by an irreverent portrayal of Christ's return to the modern world, Zimmermann and his followers denounced Herbert Achternbusch's Das Gespenst/The Ghost, denying the director a final installment from a 1982 state film prize. This intervention (the object of a decade-long court battle) was perceived as an outrageous act of censorship, as the first of many radical changes in government policies regarding public film subsidy.\n\nZimmermann's program catalyzed widespread endeavors among producers to make German films commercially competitive and to recapture the confidence of domestic audiences. Upcoming directors, particularly graduates from the Munich Academy for Film und Television, openly eschewed the counter-cultural strategies of their elders. \"Much more than by New German Film,\" opined Doris Dörrie, \"I've been influenced by the films of the 'New American Cinema'--Scorsese, Cassavetes und Rafelson.\"xvii Dominik Graf, another successful Munich graduate, railed against the limited appeal of a rarified \"art gallery cinema\" and advocated a higher level of professionalism: \"I think we often tend to forget audiences when we make films and let our own preferences and egomania guide us rather than worrying about technical expertise.\"xviii Attempting to make accessible and commercially viable movies, young German filmmakers thoroughly acquainted themselves with genre cinema's patterns of recognition. Reinhard Münster's resolve of 1984 was widely followed: \"When I watch a classical film, I can only learn something. It would be inappropriate to say that I'm going to make something altogether new when there are models out there which I can use as a point of departure.\"xix Characterizing this new generation of filmmakers in 1988, Alexander Kluge remarked: \"They believe in Spielberg and so on, and not at all in politics. They believe completely in a professional fantasy: some day having a huge budget with three assistants. It's a strange idea, but very common. They think a real director must be recognized with a telephone call from Hollywood or somewhere, and he mustn't do anything political. They find politics boring. They believe that one shouldn't fight.\"xx Epigonal endeavors of various hues--e.g., Peter F. Bringmann's Der Schneemann/The Snow Man, 1985), Roland Emmerich's Joey (1985), Hajo Gies's Schimanski - On the Killer's Track, 1985, and Peter Timm's Fifty Fifty (1988)--painstakingly duplicated Hollywood formulas in a studied attempt to craft popular German films.\n\nEven prominent practitioners of the Autorenkino resigned and bid the model adieu. What hope was there in a culture of short attention spans and disposable images, Wim Wenders reflected, for a cinema of emotional investment and social concern, for penetrating films, \"which have a soul and a discernible inner core, which emanate a distinct identity?\"xxi \"In a society addicted to amusement,\" lamented producer Günter Rohrbach, \"one that is less and less able to take time for sensitive stories, does there remain any hope of survival at all for a type of film which relies precisely on this sort of sensitivity?\"xxii The continued existence of the Autorenfilm, its detractors claimed, had been mainly a function of narcissistic artists, credulous subsidy boards, indulgent television editors, and leftist film reviewers. Angry and disinclined observers insisted that this cinema had been kept alive artificially by a state welfare system. Early in 1991 Wenders said that the historical existence of the authorial design had reached its end.xxiii The respected media expert Klaus Kreimeier went further; he wondered in fact whether this model might have been a fundamental mistake, inappropriate to the workings and cooperative imperatives of the film medium itself. German film authors, in their quest for self-expression, had assumed an untenable and unrealistic stance. Their emphasis on control was egocentric and autistic; so often people presumed competence in areas where they possessed little or no expertise. The Autorenkino's mélange of arrogance and amateurism, in Kreimeier's harsh condemnation, might well be the reason for cinema's decline in Germany over the last decades.xxiv\n\n2. New formations in film subsidy arrangements: Without question, the dramatic shifts in the nature of German film subsidy since the early 1980s have influenced the content and shape of productions, diminishing the possibility for political interventions and the presence of alternative perspectives and formal experiments. Four major developments are crucial in this regard:\n\n--The transformation of cultural subsidy into an almost exclusively economic one (the primacy of commerce over art);\n\n--The greater power of television officials on film boards and the decisive influence of tv programming priorities on subsidy decisions;\n\n--The increasing centralization and consolidation of film finance as television and film subsidy sources collaborate with regional media initiatives (e.g., the cooperations between the Filmstiftung Nordrhein-Westfalen with both public and commercial tv stations [ZDF, WDR, Pro7, Sat.1, and RTL], or the interactions between the Bavarian State Film and Television Fund, Bavaria studio, and Pro7);\n\n--Arrangements between film academies, television stations, and commercial producers. Diploma films are less likely to be sites of experimentation and risk; rather, young directors are encouraged to work under the sway of commercial imperatives and industry priorities already in their inaugural features.\n\nThe model that ensured the continuing existence of auteur filmmakers and a public sphere for alternative perspectives is on the wane. Questions of Wirtschaftlichkeit (commercial potential) generally outweigh all other concerns. Or, put differently, \"those parties who prefer to speak of film as a disposable property are the ones who by and large determine the drift of contemporary discussions.\"xxv Given these dynamics, it is easily apparent why difficult films that explore the darker sides of German reality rarely are produced.\n\n3. The transformation of cinema within the public sphere:\n\nBestandsaufnahme. Utopie Film, (Taking Stock: The Utopia Film), an extensive pamphlet edited by Alexander Kluge, appeared shortly after Zimmermann came into power.xxvi Kluge and his collaborators fully recognized the endangered status of alternative filmmakers. With the proliferation of cable networks and media consortia, of electronic software and satellite television, this status had become even more precarious. The so-called \"new media\" have fostered technological change and economic opportunity. In the process these heavily capitalized industrial forces remould perceptions of space and time, reprogramming human senses in a round-the-clock barrage of prefabricated meaning and patterned experience. New German Cinema, which over the years had encouraged experimentation and militated against the powers of exclusion, amnesia, and repression, was reduced to an anachronistic outpost in a radically transformed public sphere.\n\nThe crisis situation addressed in Bestandsaufnahme and experienced throughout the eighties and nineties was of course hardly singular to Germany. It was felt throughout the world by a host of national film industries, which, overwhelmed by American blockbusters, transnational distributors, and decreasing market shares, took desperate recourse to popular domestic counterventures or regional self-help initiatives (e.g., the GATT-Manifesto or European coproductions). The crisis was more one of cinema than of film, a function of dramatic changes in the institutional spaces, social callings, and material forms assumed by mass-produced sights and sounds. No longer items necessarily encountered in a public forum at a fixed time, films increasingly circulate in a variety of formats (video cassettes, laser discs, DVDs, digital texts), readily available commodities at the consumer's constant disposal. In a world where audio-visual software proliferates in constantly new and advanced packages, individual films transmute into \"temporary constellations of particles from our galaxy of images which assume a fleeting shape before our eyes on the screen and then flit back into the galaxy of images, reappearing later perhaps as television images, raw material for commercials, as magazine photos or music videos.\"xxvii And as single films cease to be main attractions, the institution of cinema must constantly consider how it might maintain a viable profile against competing forms of leisure-time diversions.\n\n4. Changes in exhibition and distribution: Cinema has become one outlet in an exponentially expanding field of audio-visual providers.xxviii In 1980, Wolf-Eckart Bühler had characterized the three major sites of German film exhibition: \"The McDonald-cinema of the urban movie center chains\"; \"the Peter Stuyvesant-Kino of the new progressive film freaks\"; \"the Suhrkamp-cinema of the communal celluloid catacombs.\"xxix During the next decade, the big city cine-centers would increasingly come under attack for their small screens, substandard technical facilities, and exorbitant prices. Few German films would find their way into such houses; they--along with art films and alternative productions--unreeled instead in Programmkinos. By the mid-eighties many Programmkinos had cut back their initially ambitious programs, showing a more limited array of films and taking fewer risks. Communal cinemas, an important locus for independent and alternative endeavors, struggle to keep alive despite smaller turnouts and government budget cuts. Old cinemas are being torn down today in numerous urban locations. In their place arise technically advanced multiplexes with large screens, luxurious seating, state-of-the-art projection and sophisticated sound systems, as well as a host of other enticements including restaurants, bars, and entertainment centers.\n\nFive major American distributors now play a leading role in Germany: Warner, UIP, Columbia, Buena Vista, and Fox. (In the last several years Polygram has likewise become a strong player.) These companies have come to recognize that German films, professionally packaged and appropriately marketed, can play well in German cinemas. Buena Vista released Abgeschminkt/Dressing Down, Keiner liebt mich/Nobody Loves Me, Stadtgespräch/Talk of the Town, and Maybe, Maybe Not (which sold 6.5 million tickets in 1995). During the illustrious first quarter of 1997, Knockin' on Heaven's Door, another Buena Vista release, screened in one of every four big city cinemas. Backed by the majors, modest scale German productions (albeit a very small number of them) were able to gain a substantial public profile. The recent breakthrough of German comedies is unthinkable without the investments of the major companies. Popular film genres and visible stars coupled with the marketing ploys of American distributors: this gathering of forces above all generated the German film boom of the 1990s.\n\n5. Different experential priorities for the trend- and tonesetters of a younger generation: Altogether different priorities define the spectatorship of the German \"New Age,\" an era of program changes and identity shifts. No longer does one flee to the cinema in search of heightened experiences and alternative perspectives as one had in the 1970s. \"Cinema - that could be a drug. Peter Handke noted in his diary, Das Gewicht der Welt (The Weight of the World): 'My moviegoing has become an addiction: after almost every film lethargy and hopelessness . . . and nonetheless a day later I once again feel anxious when 'my movie time' nears.' That was 1977. Eight years later, Rainhald Goetz, at work on texts like Krieg (War) and Herz (Heart) notes: 'Friday, October 26. Work on War. Walk. News from Malta. Home, work on Heart. Later at the Mathäser Cinema, Conan the Destroyer, cracks me up, go out afterwards to a disco with the crowd, get really smashed.'\" Here, claims Helmut Schödel, \"ends the dream of cinema. Disco, cinema, writing--it's all one big simulation game, part of a culture of gigantic spectacles in which the single event loses its importance.\"\n\nA new tone and a new mobility came into play during the eighties, claimed cultural critic Bernd Guggenberger, in his psychogram of a younger generation's sensibility.xxx \"The 'New Wave' of this newest youth has no representative Zeitgeist, but instead attitudes and gestures, postures and poses whose common denominator often seems to be the lack of one--or rather the most common one of all: 'anything goes!' A pluralism of styles and a blend of moods, mixed media and passing erotic encounters--these elements characterized the signature of an epoch\" (82). According to Guggenberger, the cardinal sins for this \"Joy-Stick Generation\" were \"reflection\" and \"commitment\": \"Anything except too much identity!\" (83). Culture yielded to the cool tour, a space wont to a free-floating narcissism and a hypertrendy mise-en-scène: \"Nowhere do gazes cross and eyes meet,\" Guggenberger elaborates, \"one doesn't talk or laugh, is neither happy or excited; one has nothing to communicate--except perhaps that uncertain 'message' which body language and (preferably black) clothing suggest. . . . The new heroes are beautiful and inert, sullen and introverted. Their preferred expression is a well-calculated gesture with just the right blend of 'come on' and turn off\" (78).\n\nThis new sensibility, in keeping with the proclivities of the New Cinema of Consensus, favors velocity over repose; one is mobile and unfixed, ever in transport, responding to the rhythms of the Zeitgeist. It is a world of show and simulation, everything a bit unreal, flashy and bright with no dark shadows. In this signal culture Sein is Sign. And here Dasein means Design, which is art out of the icebox, beauty without the good--high quality, low affect (17). The best personality is none whatsoever; rough edges only spoil a smooth appearance (22). One is not really there at all, one just pretends to be present. The post-political motto of Guggenberger's designer world is either: \"We've seen through the world, why should we bother changing it?\" or \"We've seen through the world, how could we ever manage to change it?\" (26).\n\nThe world that Guggenberger depicts is, to be sure, one of comforts and privileges common to a decided minority of young Germans. This small world and its circumscribed view, however, is the commanding perspective of recent German comedies. This new age of precise superficiality and precious tristesse characterizes innumerable recent German films set in the current scene's trendy hangouts and peopled by its flashy movers and shakers. Elegant sitting rooms, glitzy restaurants, well-heeled characters decked out in ensembles by Cerutti or Versace or dessous from La Perla grace balanced frames, tasteful compositions redolent of advertising spreads in pages of the German Vogue or Schöner wohnen. Denizens of these post-1968 fantasies have stopped making sense and searching for sensuality. Their motto is nonstop nonsense (28), to be abgeklärt and mobile, to remain cool without freezing (29).\n\nIV. Martyrs and Men in Motion\n\n\"The discourses in circulation about film, as well as wider cultural discourses in the nation-state,\" Stephen Crofts has pointed out, \"clearly affect industry and audiences, and also inform--and are articulated within--film texts.\"xxxi We have talked about the factors that have produced quite different conceptions of German cinema. It is now time to consider the fantasy scenarios and master narratives of these two cinemas.\n\nCritical discussions about New German Cinema in the main privileged three central preoccupations: (1) America and Hollywood as objects of postwar German love/hatred; (2) National Socialism and its legacy of shame; and (3) the political malaise of the Federal Republic as experienced by the postwar generation. Angry young men (and to a degree, women), revolted against a collective past, esp. the Nazi experience as well as the Adenauer era. To a large extent, the focus was on a critical cinema fueled by an overdetermined Oedipal rage which reacted to the abuse of film under Hitler and the medium's affirmative status during the 1950s. This cinema challenged the nation's willingness to forget the past and get on with business as usual, to follow the dictates of Allied occupiers and to become a Cold War bastion. The work of Fassbinder and his cohorts surveyed a traumatic past and the wreckage (both physical and psychic) that remained in the present, seeking as well to spell out the precarious terms of postwar German reconstruction. It also generated a positive project, a desire to construct a better Germany and to reconceive cinema, to rewrite German history and to renew German film history. It was a cinema of disenchantment, in equal measure a function of critical fury and utopian resolve, of negative will and reformist design.\n\nNew German Cinema was renowned abroad for its demonstrations of stunted identities and reduced personalities, of outsiders, underdogs, and over-reachers. Its narratives typically featured vulnerable protagonists, captives of situations that they do not comprehend or control. Kluge's Anita G. (Yesterday Girl/Abschied von gestern) and Herzog's Kaspar Hauser(Jeder für sich und Gott gegen alle/Everyone for Oneself and God against All) provide paradigms for this cinema of German martyrs. Their life stories serve as didactic parables in the form of station dramas. These films constituted allegories of a postwar generation's collective destiny, forging a master narrative in which immature subjects were cast onto dangerous ground and into a realm of fear and loathing. These figures (orphans or products of disfunctional families) desperately wished for a secure living space and an authentic identity. Misunderstood, abused, and tormented, they confronted anachronistic institutional structures whose functionaries were indifferent and brutal. Typically these tales had a lethal conclusion or an open ending: their negativity nonetheless intimated that a less tragic outcome would be thinkable in a different world.\n\nThe haunted and homeless protagonists of New German Cinema often sought refuge in America and its mass culture. The United States became an insistent site of self-reflection and identity formation, if indeed an unreliable and unstable source of sanctuary (as films like Der amerikanische Soldat/The American Soldier, Der amerikanische Freund/The American Friend, and Stroszek bear out). The world of fitness centers, shopping malls, rock-and-roll records, and mass-produced images evoked by Wim Wenders, however, was no longer experienced as foreign in the Cinema of Consensus. This accorded to a Federal Republic for which these commodities and experiences are facts of everyday life. In those few instances where these films made overt forays into political settings, the malaise of the present was less the function of a German authoritarian legacy that refused to go away. Repeatedly the Cinema of Consensus presented characters whose primary sense of person and place was rarely an overt function of their national identity or directly impacted by Germany's difficult past. Instead of German tales of martyrdom and suffering, the New Cinema of Consensus offered tableaux of mobile young professionals, who play with possibility and flirt with difference, living in the present and worrying about their future, juggling careers, relationships, and life styles.\n\nDoris Dörrie's Männer/Men (1985), more than any German film of the 1980s, articulated a generation's deep disdain for the dreams of '68 about a better life and an alternative existence. It also took dramatic leave from the New German Cinema. This double reckoning came in the form of a modest television movie made with a budget of 800,000 DM. It quickly was the talk of the nation, a runaway success that combined a snappy dialogue and a nimble dramaturgy in a German comedy of remarriage. Indeed, the film satisfied critics and Zimmermann, winning every imaginable award. It was the most successful German film of the year: 4.2 million tickets were sold within its first six months and five million people saw it during 1986. Dörrie herself maintained that she had inadvertently hit a resonant chord of the Zeitgeist. Observers, both domestic and foreign, lauded the film's refreshing departure from the angst-ridden agendas of Fassbinder, Herzog, and Wenders.\n\nA manager, Julius, struggles to regain his errant wife who has left him for the somewhat younger Stephan. Julius goes underground and takes a spare room in the artist's commune, redirecting the alternative spirit's energies, and in the end making him over altogether. The film aligns itself with Julius's perspective, presenting his fear of instability and his fantasy of restoration. The narrative might even be interpreted as an extended psychodrama. Early in the film Julius lies in bed with Paula and, to her dismay, snores loudly. Near the film's end the scene is repeated, suggesting that the entire sequence of events between the two moments has been one long dream. In this fantasy scenario, Julius becomes a voyeur, both threatened and fascinated, watching his younger self (in the form of Stephan) carry on with his wife. Fearless and virtually omnipotent, Julius transforms the artist into a mirror reflection, dissolving his competitor's allure for the wife and in that way winning back his old existence. One might call the film Educating Stephan: its crucial passages focus on the formation of identity as an exercise in the manipulation of images. Julius remakes Stephan, attiring him in a new wardrobe, restyling his hair, giving him lessons in managerial comportment, showing him how to gaze, how to negotiate, how to make commercial illustrations more appealing by throwing in a slight touch of the unconventional.\n\nThe encounter of dialectical opposites gives rise to a higher synthesis. The bohemian learns from the businessman the art of the deal and the power of the bluff. With only a minimum of resistance, Stephan surrenders to the seductions of consumer society, enacting a scenario that would have us believe that social climbers and social dropouts are at heart kindred spirits--and German Kleinbürger.xxxii Men offers a psychological history of the generation of 1968 from the perspective of the generation that followed it. We hear Eric Burton's \"When I Was Young\" throughout the film; it becomes the refrain for the student movement's failed hopes. \"I've been through all the communal forms, I'm dulled by them. . .I've lost my utopia,\" Stephan will admit at a key moment. The aim of the commune was ultimate openness, of all sorts: self-disclosure, self-analysis, self-criticism. So much self-awareness, as we know from Guggenberger, means too much identity. Foregrounding an adaptive and mobile subjectivity, Men provided a New Age version of Mann ist Mann.xxxiii\n\nThe German Cinema of Consensus took Dörrie's impetus and raised it to the higher power. There is in fact a direct line from Männer to Der bewegte Mann. Wortmann's smash hit of 1995, released in America as Maybe, Maybe Not, is a Peter Pan narrative. Axel is a creature of irrepressible desire; he refuses to live up to his partner Doro's expectations that he be a faithful partner and a dutiful future father. Thrown out by Doro, Axel becomes friends with the homosexual Norbert, and even flirts with the prospect of a gay encounter. Here again, though, a character's role-playing involves no risk-taking or threat of radical change. Many recent German films have invoked male homosexuality (but, curiously, rarely lesbianism), but invariably within the context of well-known clichés and homophobic jokes.xxxiv Next to never does one encounter a strong or decisive woman. The essential female centerpiece of German comedies, played by Katja Riemann as a refurbished Doris Day, longs above all for romantic bliss and bourgeois security. Wortmann's work as a whole, and particularly Der Campus, is emphatic in its systemic ridicule of feminism and identity politics. In Der Campus, 68ers appear as characters without belief, self-promoting careerists who employ political correctness as a vehicle of self-interest, who assume the moral highground to protect their turf and expand sphere of influence. They are, to a person, figures without depth of being or strength of conviction.\n\nThe more recent hit, Helmut Dietl's Rossini, shows us an array of luminaries, extensions of Julius and Stephan, gathering in a fashionable Munich restaurant. Dietl's new men are filmmakers; the world of their projects, like the nouvelle German world of Rossini, is one of sex, money, and ambition. In a procession of movies about people who are mainly graphic artists in the advertising industry or individuals employed in the cultural industry (as disc jockeys, as filmmakers, as actors, as musicians, as models), the Cinema of Consensus reflected--and demonstrated--the workings of a German culture industry that probed every way possible to gain an edge and an advantage. Unlike the generation that produced the New German Cinema, it published no programmatic statements or collective declarations. That is not to say, however, that it lacked a program or a larger purpose.\n\n5. The Difficulty of Saying We\n\nThe disparity between New German Cinema and the Cinema of Consensus bears out competing desires to create images for a nation and to speak as a prominent and privileged voice of that nation. In Edgar Reitz's film essay, Die Nacht der Regisseure (The Night of the Directors, 1995), New German directors have become elder statesmen. The film imagines a grand museum of German film history in which Leni Riefenstahl sits comfortably sits between Werner Herzog and Volker Schlöndorff, in which fantasies of the German forest are entertained as if the Nazis had never worshipped blood and soil, where Schlöndorff can speak of Fritz Lang as a great German director, \"even though he was Viennese and part Jewish.\" A central emphasis in this film historical excursion are evocations of a former popular cinema, of alluring stars like Zarah Leander, Kristina Söderbaum, and Marika Rökk. Even filmmakers whose look back in anger spawned a New German Cinema appear now as a part of a larger legacy that includes Riefenstahl and the Ufa productions of the thirties and forties.xxxv Despite the presence of former DEFA filmmakers (Frank Beyer and Wolfgang Kohlhaase) and younger directors like Wolfgang Becker, Detlev Buck and Peter Sehr, there is no conflict, controversy, or disagreement. Reitz staged this fictional meeting to create a sense of common interests in a national cinema's imagined historical community.xxxvi In this regard at least, New German Cinema now speaks as part of a greater Germany and a German legacy that it once assailed.\n\nThe issue of national cultural identity, as Paul Willemen points out, arises only in response to a challenge posed by the other, so that any discourse of national-cultural identity is from the outset oppositional--although not necessarily progressive.xxxvii The other that helped solidify the self-understanding of German film culture after the New German Cinema was surely not Hollywood, but rather a cinema of unruly authors, oppositional politics, and alternative images. Popular cinema--and in this regard Hollywood, Ufa, and German films of the 1950s--in fact returned as a good object, as a film culture's points of orientation and role models. The dream of many aspiring German filmmakers today was to become a Wolfgang Petersen or a Roland Emmerich. If anything, this new mainstream cinema longed for a German film industry as powerful and resonant as a former age's Ufa studio. The Cinema of Consensus consciously sought ways of saying \"we\" in its address to German audiences. Its fantasies of a German Film Empire and a national German tradition were, without question, both problematic and difficult, problematic given postwall Germany's increasingly heterogeneous and multicultural realities, difficult given German cinema's diverse constituencies and audiences.\n\nThe Cinema of Consensus provided an interesting, if ephemeral, chapter in German film history. It did not sell abroad because it was perceived as both too German and yet not German enough. It had stars familiar only to German audiences and generic designs that were not readily exportable because they were done better and more effectively elsewhere. Although it was resolutely stylish, the cinema lacked a distinctive style: however professionally crafted, it was unabashedly conventional in its appearance and structure. The Cinema of Consensus, of course, is a construction, a critical term that I have used to describe a gathering of films and filmmakers which have dominated media accounts and industry campaigns devoted to German film's public profile mainly between 1985 and the late 1990s. At the same time, there were many other forces at work in this nation's film culture, indeed offbeat voices and less reconciled visions, less visible films with a historical ground, a post-national sensibility, and a critical edge. There were numerous noteworthy exceptions to the rule, ragamuffins like Christoph Schlingensief, Heinz Emigholz, and Monika Treut, uncompromised auteurs like Ulrike Ottinger, Rosa von Praunheim, and Harun Farocki, explorers of bleaker provinces such as Michael Klier, Jan Schütte, Wolfgang Becker, Heike Misselwitz, and Fred Kelemen, the recalcitrant remnants of DEFA with their reflections on a lost world and an uncommodious new situation, pliers of a liminal cinema like Thomas Arslan, Kutlug Ataman, Lars Becker, and Eoin Moore who survey the multicultural realities of a postwall community, ambitious new arrivals like Tom Tykwer (Winterschläfer/Winter Sleepers), Hans-Christian Schmid (23), and Fatih Akin (Kurz und schmerzlos/Short Sharp Shock) with a desire to fathom the psychic and social makeup of today's young Germans--among others. Some contemporary German films had not lost the incendiary potential of New German Cinema, the ability to illuminate a darker world and to bring to light less obvious and for that reason more provocative perspectives. For reasons that I have tried to make apparent, this cinema remained, until quite recently (a development that has yet to receive more sustained consideration) for the most a minority opinion and a marginal perspective, existing in the shadows of the more prominent Cinema of Consensus.\n\niJürgen Habermas, Die neue Unübersichtlichkeit (Frankfurt am Main: Suhrkamp, 198x).\n\niiFor all of 1997, despite the legendary first quarter, the domestic market share of German films was 17%. The most successful German film of 1997 was Knockin' on Heaven's Door (3.5 million tickets). In 1998 the market share fell to 9%. Titanic alone constituted 15% of all admissions; it sold 18 million tickets. The leading German films of 1998 were Comedian Harmonists (2.3 million) and Lola rennt/Run, Lola, Run (2.0).\n\niiiDer bewegte Film: Aufbruch zu neuen deutschen Erfolgen, eds.
