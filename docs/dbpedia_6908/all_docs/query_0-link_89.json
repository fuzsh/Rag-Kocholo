The association of ﬁlm and comics dates back to the early years of both as forms of mass-distributed media. As early as 1906, Edwin S. Porter created a live-action adaptation of Winsor McCay’s comic strip Dreams of the Rarebit Fiend and later McCay himself became a key innovator in ﬁlm animation. In 1914 Charles H. France directed a short live-action ﬁlm entitled Buster Brown on the Care and Treatment of Goats based on the comic strip character. Comic book characters such as Superman and Batman appeared in B movies and ﬁlm serials long before the blockbuster adaptations of the 1970s and 1980s. Likewise Superman, Batman, Spider-Man, and the Hulk featured in low production value television series from the 1950s to the 1970s. The relationship between ﬁlm and comics may also work in the other direction. Films have served as content fodder for comics since the silent-ﬁlm era, including the creation of comic-strip or comic book versions of such movie icons as Charlie Chaplin, Fatty Arbuckle, Hopalong Cassidy, and Bob Hope. In recent years ﬁlmmakers have adapted a plethora of comic books for the screen including Marvel’s the X-Men, Spider-Man, Blade, and the Hulk, and from DC new ﬁlm versions of Batman and Superman. Many of these have been wildly successful at the box ofﬁce and are held up as the ideal model for the Hollywood blockbuster. In June 2006, the magazine Entertainment Weekly choose X-Men’s Wolverine as “Hollywood’s most dominant franchise character,” over others such as James Bond and Harry Potter; Spider-Man was third (Stack, 2006). Producers have also tapped alternative comics such as From Hell, American Splendor, and Ghost World [ vii ]\n\nfor cinemagraphic treatments. Production deals for comic book character– based movies have multiplied rapidly. It seems that more is at stake than a shift from low budget/status productions to blockbusters. Critical acclaim has ﬂowed for many of the recent efforts, and respected directors such as Sam Mendes and Ang Lee have lent their talents to ﬁlms based on comic books. At the same time, particularly since the success of Maus, comic books have gained increased critical respectability even attaining the dizzy heights of favorable reviews in the New York Times and the New York Review of Books, albeit accompanied by discussions of what constitutes a comic book and ﬁnely delineated distinctions between genuine artistic merit and dross. In the modern blockbuster ﬁlm era, which roughly dates from Superman (1978), and which forms a prime focus of this work, motion picture creative personnel use comic book texts and comic book authorial intention in an attempt to add authenticity to comic book ﬁlms. Christian Bale, the actor who played Batman in the darker, more adult 2005 ﬁlm Batman Begins, argued that his interpretation of Batman: “is what Bob Kane intended when he ﬁrst created the character . . . I spoke with his wife, and she said that he was appalled when the (1960s) TV series spoofed what he had intended. But then you had the great revivals in the comic books” (Strauss U6). Movie studios may even court the approval of comic book superstars for endorsements, which, depending on the superstar, could be a tricky proposition. Rather than the Hollywood actors or best-selling novelists copping an attitude, it may be the comics’ creators who become offended. Both Entertainment Weekly and the New York Times covered the feud between Alan Moore, the creator of the graphic novel V for Vendetta, and Warner Brother’s, the studio behind the 2005 ﬁlm version of the story. Moore apparently wanted to distance himself from the ﬁlm version of V and was angry when a press conference about the ﬁlm mentioned—or, from Moore’s perspective, misrepresented—his excitement for the project (Itzkoff B1; Russo 26). And in perhaps the strongest signal of the symbiosis between ﬁlm and comics to date, Sin City (2005) was co-directed by the creator of the comic book, Frank Miller, and the ﬁlmmakers designed the ﬁlm to duplicate the speciﬁc look of the stylized comic, “as close to a frame-by-frame, panel-by-panel visual recreation of the comics as you could imagine . . . [t]he composition of the frames is the same; [ viii ]\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nthe camera angles the same; and every line of dialogue, to the word, comes from the comics.” (Leith ART4). Comic book fans are often courted by the studios. Short rough-cut previews of ﬁlms debut at comics conventions in an attempt to generate early buzz, such as an eighteen-minute version of Constantine at the 2004 San Diego Comic-Con International (in fact, seventeen other comics-related ﬁlms were teased there) (Holson C2). The ﬂap over the casting of Michael Keaton as Bruce Wayne/Batman for the 1989 Tim Burton-directed Batman underscored the importance of comic book fans to the success of ﬁlms based on comics. In November 1988 the Wall Street Journal reported that fans were less than pleased about the casting, and fan publications such as the Comics Buyer’s Guide had receiving hundreds of protest letters. Fans booed Warner representatives who attended comic conventions to promote the project (Hughes 1). In an interview with Newsweek in 1989 Jon Peters, Batman’s producer, recalled that the Wall Street Journal article had worried the ﬁnancial community and a response became necessary. Months ahead of schedule, the ﬁlmmakers cut a trailer and persuaded Warners to screen it in Los Angeles. It was a hit, even among 300 Bat-fans who showed up for the late show. That, the ﬁlmmakers agree now, is what turned things around. When the trailer went into general release at Christmas, word of mouth spread among the fans and beyond. Retailers began to sense a bump in interest. Licensing Corp. of America, Warner’s in-house merchandising arm, began to sprinkle just enough new movielicensed goods into the marketplace—apparel, hats and pens— to freshen buyers’ interest. “By the start of the year,” says Rob Friedman, Warners president of worldwide advertising and publicity, “there was a feeding frenzy that we took advantage of, and to a certain extent fueled” (Barol 70) The following year Walt Disney Pictures made sure to preview its ﬁlm Dick Tracy to comic fans at the San Diego comic conference (“ ‘Dick Tracy’ Is Arresting Interest,” 1989). As the Newsweek article attests the key to fans’ involvement in comics-based ﬁlms is the word of mouth they can generate and the resulting merchandising deals such word of mouth can generINTRODUCTION\n\n[ ix ]\n\nate, although in Dick Tracy’s case even positive fan reaction did not result in hefty proﬁts from merchandising (Fabrikant D23). Marvel and DC, the two major American comic book companies, have both spun off ﬁlm adaptations of their characters, but each took a different approach. As part of Time Warner, DC’s characters appeared in Warner Bros. ﬁlms although not always under in-house production deals. Because of its corporate position outside a major media conglomerate, Marvel originally licensed its characters to a variety of studios. Gordon Hodge, a media analyst at Thomas Weisel Partners noted that this strategy involved not much risk, but also not “much opportunity for signiﬁcant rewards.” He added: “If you own the movie and handle the distribution all the way, soup to nuts, to home video and cable television, there’s a lot better money to be made” (Gustines 8). But in April 2005 Marvel announced that it would start producing its own ﬁlms. Harry Berkowitz noted in Newsday that “the venture opens up more opportunities not just for initial ﬁlms, but also for the sequels, toys, video games, cartoons, clothing, and other merchandise that inevitably follow.” Marvel and Paramount Pictures cut a deal in which Paramount will distribute the movies on a distribution fee basis resulting in Marvel not having to share merchandising revenue with the studio. According to Paramount chairman Brad Grey, the attraction of Marvel was that it had “become a marquee entertainment brand” and as Berkowitz implied would help Paramount attract a more youthful audience (Berkowitz A57). Before the release of Batman Begins in 2005 DC’s major comic book characters had been noticeable absent from the big screen since 1997’s disastrous Batman and Robin. In 2003 the movie industry paper Variety reported that Thomas Weisel Partners had carried out an analysis of Warners and highlighted DC as a “hidden asset” whose value was waiting to be unlocked (Brodesser 7). Dennis O’Neill, a long time DC editor, in a clear expression of that value, called comics the “R & D division of the entertainment industry.” Noting this comment the media scholar Henry Jenkins suggested, “Comic publishers are doing everything right—expanding creative rights for artists, tapping new global markets, reworking old genres to keep franchises alive and vital” (Jenkins “Will the Web Save Comics?”). Marvel’s Bill Jemas took an opposing view stating that Marvel produced comic books for readers not in the hope of a director turning them into [ x ]\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\na ﬁlm (Hanson 1E). Clearly though media corporations have increasingly created synergies between comics and ﬁlms based on the concept of superhero characters as product to be sold across different media and merchandising forms. Comics and ﬁlms though are more than just product to be sold. As visual media both have aesthetic qualities and formal properties, such as frames and panels, which have important visual resemblance. Even in mainstream blockbuster movies, these visual parallels may lead to interesting aesthetic experiments, such as the “comics-look” attempted by such ﬁlms as Dick Tracy and Hulk. In addition, both comics and ﬁlms also ﬁt within a certain type of narrative tradition, a point made by John Fell over thirty years ago. But these similarities are also accompanied by some distinct differences. Comics and ﬁlms both have audiences, but comics have core audiences of fans that engage with characters over longer periods of time, and as noted above, these fans have distinct opinions on how characters should be adapted for ﬁlm. Moreover different fans of the same comic character will have different views, and with a character such as Superman, who has been through numerous incarnations, competing expectations of different fans will further complicate the problems of adaptation. Fans then can be an asset to a ﬁlm adapted from a comic, but also a liability particularly when taken for granted. When comics are thought of as a product to be sold, generally comics are being deﬁned as American superhero type comics. But the range of the form is greater than superheroes and always has been. Charles Hatﬁeld’s book Alternative Comics traces the development of a different sort of comic form in the United States from the undergrounds of the 1960s to the graphic novel. It is fair to say that many of these alternative comics deal with similar themes as superhero comics albeit with different storylines. Alienation and angst are particular favorites and of course the same could be said of novels, which lends support to Hatﬁeld’s argument for treating comics as literature. American alternative comics are but part of the range of the art form which in the United States alone also includes comic strips, and a range of comic books such as Archie, the Golden Key, Dell, and Harvey lines. The sustained presence of alternative comics and graphic novels have often combined with the “indie” ﬁlm movement or modestly budgeted studio ﬁlms to serve as an innovative counterbalance to INTRODUCTION\n\n[ xi ]\n\nthe blockbuster superhero movie, offering aesthetically sophisticated critical reﬂections on such issues as youth alienation (Ghost World), violence (A History of Violence), or the nature of representation itself (American Splendor). In addition, comic art both as its own medium and as an inﬂuence on other media has a long history in other countries, and in this volume we offer some analysis of the relationship between comics and ﬁlms in countries such as France, Germany, and Mexico and in the Malayspeaking areas and nations of Southeast Asia. The ﬁrst section of this volume examines problems of adaptation. Pascal Lefèvre argues that although ﬁlms and comics are essentially visual media, both media differ signiﬁcantly, not only in their material shape, but also in the way they are experienced and received by the public. For instance the visual ontology of a drawing creates problems for an adaptation from a comic book to a live-action movie. Every drawing is in its style a visual interpretation of the world. A photographic image has a completely different visual ontology. The more stylized or caricatured the drawing, the more likely the director of a movie will experience problems in ﬁnding a way to capture such a representation on ﬁlm. The presence of sound in ﬁlms also disturbs the mental world created by comic readers who ﬁll in the silence with imagined aspects such as the sound of a character’s voice. Michael Cohen pursues this line of enquiry through an analysis of Warren Beatty’s Dick Tracy. Cohen explains that Beatty and his crew created an aesthetic of artiﬁce that visually approached a replication of the comic form on ﬁlm. Cohen argues that four aspects helped give Dick Tracy its distinct visual feel: production design, framing choices, the use of prosthetic makeup, and the combination of choices that placed Tracy as the heroic epicenter of the ﬁlm, just as he is in the comic strip. The problems of adaptation of a comic into a ﬁlm also hold true in reverse, an adaptation of a ﬁlm into a comic. Kerry Gough reviews the processes through which Dark Horse Comics adapted the Alien(s) series of ﬁlms to a successful comic book series. Just as with ﬁlm adaptations the comic book producers had to make aesthetic choices and develop framing techniques to convey a sense of the original cultural artifact. Likewise they needed to be attuned to fan sensibilities. Gough also shows that movie studios are as anxious as major comic book companies to ﬁnd ways to reap all ﬁnancial dividends available to them through licensing their characters as a prod[ xii ]\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nuct. Treating characters as products, or as brands and subbrands, creates problems of keeping brand identity through a unity of form and content across different incarnations. Derek Johnson explores these issues through a study of Marvel’s management of its X-Men franchise with a particular focus on the role and position of Wolverine. Johnson offers an account of Marvel’s varying success in establishing a coherence for Wolverine while at the same time allowing for differentiation to attract different market segments, or audiences, such as adult and child readers. The second section examines audience expectations, reception, and reaction to comic book ﬁlms. If fans are important in shaping the production choices of moviemakers then the question arises about the manner in which comics fans view comic-based ﬁlms, particularly in comparison with non-fans. Neil Rae and Jonathan Gray set out to answer this question through an ethnographical study of readers and non-readers and their responses to ﬁlms. Mel Gibson traces the British press’s response to the two X-Men ﬁlms. She notes that the ﬁrst ﬁlm resulted in a wave of comments reminiscent of British cultural anxieties about Americanization in the 1950s and the essentially crass, low-class nature of comics, and by extension things American, in the eyes of the British middle class. The second ﬁlm though saw a shift in tone that Gibson ties to a refusal of ﬁlm critics to engage with comics at all and rather a preference to deal with the ﬁlm as a summer blockbuster. The critics then refused to engage with the ﬁlm outside their self-imposed genre constraints. Such a response echoed some comic book fans’, and indeed even comics scholars’, response to the M. Night Shyamalan ﬁlm Unbreakable, which created some genre anxiety. Aldo J. Regalado unpacks the ﬁlm and situates it ﬁrmly within the superhero genre and the fan culture that grew alongside such comic books. He suggests that Unbreakable is best understood by viewing it in conjunction with a reading of the 1933 science ﬁction short story “Reign of the SuperMan” by Superman creators Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster. The third and fourth sections of the volume look at speciﬁc themes and locales of ﬁlm adaptations of comics. Martin Flanagan traces the teenage rite of passage to adulthood, a common comic book narrative theme, in Spider-Man and Ghost World. Despite their vastly different genres (superhero and alternative comics) and economics of production (blockbuster and art-house ﬁlms), the ﬁlms offered markedly similar coming-of-age INTRODUCTION\n\n[ xiii ]\n\nnarrative arcs marked by high-school graduations. Both ﬁlms appealed to nostalgic memories: in Spider-Man’s case through a design aesthetic that evoked the 1960s or at least the original Spider-Man comic book artist Steve Ditko’s representation of the 1960s, and in Ghost World through a satire of condescending adult attitudes to teenagers, which as Flanagan suggests has inﬁnite appeal to aging baby boomers still living, or reliving, their own rebellion against their parents as some sort of halcyon age. Of all characters from comics Superman has surely appeared in more incarnations across different media forms and as licensed product. Rayna Denison takes two major instances of the Superman intertext, Superman: The Movie and the Smallville television series, as the subject for her study of genre in the comic book movie. She points to the reuniﬁcation of action and melodrama as a single genre and the growing importance of production discourses, particularly through their increasing availability on DVD, to the construction of comic characters as cultural artifacts and product. If Spider-Man and Superman are the quintessential superheroes then Harvey Pekar is surely the comic book hero of everyday life. Pekar’s self-referential comic book series American Splendor has documented the life of a character named Harvey Pekar, an ordinary Joe from Cleveland, for over twenty-ﬁve years. Craig Hight argues that in transforming this comic into a ﬁlm, through a drama-documentary style, the ﬁlmmakers have produced a rich commentary on both forms of media and a statement of sorts on representations of reality in popular media. Too often comics are associated with American comics, and comicsbased ﬁlms with Hollywood blockbusters. Filmmakers in many countries have drawn on comics for inspiration. For instance, the Australian director Bruce Beresford’s ﬁrst ﬁlm was the 1972 production of The Adventures of Barry McKenzie based on the comic strip of the same name, which satirized beer-swilling Australians in London, and appeared in the British magazine Private Eye. David Wilt offers an account of one such character, El Santo, a superhero-wrestler whose career spanned forty-eight years in the ring, ﬁfty ﬁlms, and twenty-nine years as a comic book character. He was a unique example of synergy between professional sports, comic book publishing, and the motion picture industry. The combination of these three ﬁelds of endeavor made El Santo a national idol in his native Mexico, and an immensely popular and immediately recognizable [ xiv ]\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nﬁgure around the world; for example in 2005 one of his ﬁlms was included at a retrospective of comics ﬁlms in Melbourne at the Australian Centre for the Moving Image. Paul Malone explores the complications of attempting to reach a popular German audience when translating, and by necessity transforming, a cartoony comic-book stylized frank depiction of both gay and straight sexuality for ﬁlm. He studies the varying success of two movies based on Ralf König’s popular graphic novels, Der bewegte Mann (Maybe . . . Maybe Not) and Kondom des Grauens (Killer Condom). Malone also reviews König’s position on this transformation, as he himself, while making few concessions to self-censorship in the production of his comics, seems to have accepted constraints in ﬁlm. Jan van der Putten and Timothy P. Barnard trace the transformation of Hang Tuah, a legendary ﬁgure from the ﬁfteenth-century Melaka trading empire in Southeast Asia, in twentiethcentury comics and ﬁlms. The original tales, which focus on a brave warrior who served the sultan of Melaka without question, were presented to the community in an attempt to infuse loyalty towards the ruling dynasty. In the process these tales became the most famous pieces of oral (and written) literature in the region, thus making Hang Tuah the prototypical Malay hero. Interpretations and consciousness about these tales began to shift, however, following the rise of colonial rule and in particular when the prospects of independence swept through Malaya in the 1950s. This shift occurred as the story was reproduced and transmitted through newly developing media such as radio, ﬁlm and comics, since these new idioms were in juxtaposition to the original narrative. Van der Putten and Barnard’s analysis reveals the role of comics and ﬁlm in shaping Malay identity in the process of decolonization. Finally, Sophie Geoffroy-Menoux offers a semiotic take on Enki Bilal’s ﬁlm Immortel. She argues that the ﬁlm deconstructs the comics on which it is based. Bilal’s view that globalization, eugenics, a cynical approach to money, a morbid fear of aging, the quest for eternal youth and sex have fueled progressive manipulations of all kinds, including the manipulation of visual images and their viewers; this argument ﬁnds form in the movie through Bilal’s own manipulation of images. Reality is the key narrative theme in the ﬁlm, which is ironically revealed by the very unreal, surreal, virtual aspect of the ﬁlm. Looking forward, with changes in industry structures, new digital production technologies and audience interactive venues (such as continued INTRODUCTION\n\n[ xv ]\n\ngrowth of the blogosphere), the relationship of ﬁlm to comics is a dynamic and promising area for future research. As noted earlier, Marvel, following in the footsteps of comics companies such as Dark Horse, will take a much more active role in the ﬁlm productions involving its characters. Much of this activity would involve blockbuster-level theatrical production, but also include exploiting other media. Marvel’s 2006 DVD animated release Ultimate Avengers, designed to keep the company’s name in front of the public between blockbuster releases, is one such example. Such trends indicate a potentially fundamental change in industry identity and priorities. As comic-book companies see themselves more as ﬁlm companies, to what extent does the cart drive the horse, with perhaps the development of comic-book readership, new characters and new talent being neglected. The role of comics in the blockbuster ﬁlm may also continue to affect the ﬁlm industry, by placing more emphasis on digital special effects and costly production. Spider-Man 3 (2007) is purported to have a production bill approaching $300 million (Kelly & Marr, 2006). Such ﬁgures reﬂect the economics of modern Hollywood given the spectacle element needed by superhero comics and the pressure to up the visual ante, siphoning resources to fewer and fewer ﬁlms, and making the trend worthy of continued study. Also worth tracking is other comics-related inﬂuences on ﬁlm, especially with the long-term viability of more adult-oriented graphic novels that lend themselves to quieter, more thoughtful (and less-expensive) productions. Although Art School Conﬁdential (2006), based upon a graphic novel story by Daniel Clowes, generated a modest U.S. box ofﬁce, its relatively inexpensive production costs and potential “after-market” life on cable and DVD may offer its own economic beneﬁts. The publicity generated by smaller-budgeted efforts may have beneﬁcial effects on the sales and fandom of graphic novels, given the smaller numbers needed for a print title to be an economic success. With digital graphics software and the distribution capabilities of the internet, the blurring of production and consumption will likely continue with all media, including comics. Graphics software make creation of graphic novels more viable, and websites make distribution more widespread for new talent. Fan communities via chat rooms and blogs make au[ xvi ]\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\ndience identity, feedback, and “buzz” a part of both the mainstream industry and labor-of-love efforts, and such trends may continue to inﬂuence production, marketing, and audience experiences. It is hoped that the following chapters in this book will contribute to a foundation of future studies that chart the changing nature and social, cultural, and ideological implications of these two institutions.

Adaptations from comics seldom gain canonical recognition and they rarely ﬁgure in lists of best ﬁlms of all times.2 Not only do these adaptations seldom please the critics,3 they seem to have little automatic appeal for comics readers.4 Cinema critics and comics fans seem to agree that it is hard to make a good movie of a comic. The movie-going audience is less severe. Moreover, some adaptations from comics were real blockbusters including Richard Donner’s Superman (1978), Tim Burton’s Batman (1989), Barry Sonnenfeld’s Men in Black (1997) and Sam Raimi’s Spider-Man (2002).5 That the comics the movies were based on were already a success does not explain completely the success of the ﬁlmic adaptations; the movies must have attracted viewers that rarely read comics. Moreover all these adaptations generated an offspring of sequels. Adaptations of comics seem to be popular as well as controversial. While some analysts (Peeters6) recognize creative aspects of some adaptations, other critics (Fremion 166) state bluntly that adaptation is preferred by mediocre talents. Some comic artists are even opposed to the idea of a ﬁlmic adaptation. For instance, Art Spiegelman does not want to see his [ 1 ]\n\nMaus adapted as a live action movie, because he considers the metaphoric style of his storytelling essential and impossible to adapt outside the comics medium.7 Nevertheless it has been pointed out various times that there is a closer link between cinema and comics than between cinema and other visual arts (Christiansen 107, Costa 24). Films and comics are both media which tell stories by series of images: the spectator sees people act—while in a novel the actions must be verbally told. Showing is already narrating in cinema and comics, but while classical cinematic narratives situate the spectator at the centre of the diegetic space, comics on the other hand are rooted in a parodic tradition (Christiansen 118). Since the nineteenth century a majority of comics have used deformation, often caricatured, to various degrees as a major characteristic. Also the confrontation of texts and pictures and the fact that pictures are drawn reminds the reader of their artiﬁcial status. Moreover ﬁlm and comics differ signiﬁcantly not only in the way they are experienced and received by the public, but also in their material shape. This poses many problems for an adaptation from a comic to a liveaction movie. In particular the visual ontology of a drawing seems to be a central issue, as will be developed in this essay. But in addition there is the problem of primacy: usually people prefer the ﬁrst version of a story they encounter. When you read ﬁrst a novel, you form a personal mental image of the ﬁctive world and when you ﬁrst read a comic, you have a kinetic visual idea as well. Any ﬁlmic adaptation has to deal with these ﬁrst personal interpretations and images: it is extremely hard to exorcise those ﬁrst impressions.8 In this article the term “adaptation” is used in a broad sense, including also ﬁlms directly inspired by a certain comic or comic series.9 Adaptations in animation format are not discussed. Animated adaptations deserve a proper analysis of their own, but most problems of live action adaptations will haunt animated version as well. In contrast to the single and original artworks of painting and sculpture, only copies of ﬁlms and comics are distributed and consumed.10 Art philosopher Walter Benjamin argued that the aura of the work of art withered in the age of mechanical reproduction, because the reproduced object is detached from the domain of tradition.11 Though they share a funda[ 2 ]\n\nPA S C A L L E F È V R E\n\nmental similarity (mass consumption) movies and comics still have some differences regarding their reception or consuming mode. The two main differences are the material shape of the images and the social aspects of reception. The difference in reception or consuming mode is individual activity (comic) versus group experience (cinema). While reading a comic is a solitary action, viewing a ﬁlm in a theatre is largely a group experience: people gather in ﬁlm theaters at precise moments to watch a ﬁlm together.12 A lot of moviegoers share emotions at the same time: they laugh and cry together. Reactions of other viewers may facilitate such emotional responses during a showing. Reading a comic, on the contrary, involves no direct emotional sharing with others. Only when the reading is completed, a comic reader can exchange his emotions with others. A ﬁlm showing demands attention from the viewer, since the place is dark with only the screen light and often music plays loudly to lend aural atmosphere and to keep viewers attuned to the screen action. Reading a comic book, on the other hand, does not necessarily take place in such an undisturbed environment. Nevertheless a reader can seclude himself physically and mentally. Not only does the reception of a comic and a ﬁlm differ, but also their production. By necessity the production of a ﬁlm implies a bigger organization and budget than the production of a comic. The creative part in ﬁlm is done by a group of people (writer, photographer, director, actor, editor and the like), whereas drawing and writing a comic can be done by a small team or just one person. This essay, though, focuses on the visual differences of the two media. Despite their seeming concordance—at least when comparing ﬁlms to novels—juxtapositioning their inherent visual ontologies highlights reasons why comics fans may literally “see” ﬁlm adaptations as often unfaithful and even disrespectful. There are four main problems in the adaptation of comics into ﬁlm and three of them are related to the characteristics of the comics medium itself: panels are arranged on a page, panels are static drawings and a comic does not make noise or sound. Film is quite different. First, there is a screen frame, second, the ﬁlm images are moving and photographic, third, ﬁlm has a soundtrack. These characteristic differences of the two media become enacted as the four adaptation problems of (1) the deletion/addition T H E P R O B L E M AT I C A D A P TAT I O N O F D R AW N I M A G E S\n\n[ 3 ]\n\nprocess that occurs with rewriting primary comics texts for ﬁlm; (2) the unique characteristics of page layout and ﬁlm screen; and (3) the dilemmas of translating drawings to photography; and (4) the importance of sound in ﬁlm compared to the “silence” of comics. Given these problems, perhaps the central question about ﬁlmic adaptation of comics is not, “how faithful/respectful to the comic the ﬁlm will be,” but rather, “how least dissimilar to the comic can the ﬁlm be?” The starting point for most adaptations is whether or not the scriptwriters will follow the storyline as presented in the comic itself, or will they take the existing material just as an interesting starting point to write a new story with a lot of new additions. Few adaptations respect meticulously the storyline of a particular comic. Every real artisan of cinema knows that this medium has its own laws and rules. A direct adaptation is seldom a good choice: some elements may work wonderfully in a comic, but cannot function in the context of a ﬁlm. Usually a script writer for a movie has to leave out scenes, has to add others, and has to write out some principal characters or introduce new ones. For instance, the two police ofﬁcers in the comic From Hell (Moore and Campbell) are combined in the ﬁlm into one character. The necessity of such changes in large part is simply due to the different narrative-length norms of the two media. Since the comic book version of From Hell consists of hundreds of pages, not all the drawn sequences were shot. Thus, the original text is inevitably altered. From Hell’s creator Alan Moore (Mouchart 30) explains that he does not care too much about adaptations: “I force myself not to have an opinion [on the adaptations]. Those feature ﬁlms do not resemble my books. If they are good ﬁlms, it’s the merit of the directors. It has nothing to do with me. Likewise if the ﬁlms are mediocre. It interests me to see them, but since I don’t like to work for Hollywood and cinema isn’t one of my preferred media, I do not feel very implicated in those projects.”13 Most comic creators (like Daniel Clowes, Stan Lee, Enki Bilal) understand that a ﬁlm usually needs changes to the original material. Enki Bilal stresses that Immortel is not an adaptation of his Nikopol trilogy, but a rewriting (“réécriture”). He explains in an interview that it was important— amongst other things—to include some of the burning issues of today and forget about some other aspects (Bernière 12). [ 4 ]\n\nPA S C A L L E F È V R E\n\nBy contrast to the artists themselves, diehard fans of the original work rarely applaud such rewritings. For instance, the changes in costumes and the character motivations in the X-Men ﬁlms dissatisﬁed some fans (Lee 2000). The organic webshooters of Spider-Man in the Sam Raimi ﬁlm seem to pose a problem for some fans, because in the original comic book version the webshooters were a technological invention of the young scientist Peter Parker. When Kenneth Plume asked Stan Lee, the creator of Spider-Man, about this matter, he said that it worked out: “Maybe some purists who know the comics might feel, ‘Oh, they didn’t do it the way it was in the comics,’ but the average person watching it would have no problem with the webs coming out of his hands that way” (Lee 2000). Some comics fans tend to consecrate the original work and scrutinize a ﬁlmic adaptation for so called errors or misinterpretations. Almost every attempt of adaptation becomes in their eyes some kind of betrayal. Moreover such ﬁlmic adaptations give superheroes fans a unique opportunity to show off their almost autistic-savant knowledge of a particular superhero comic book series. In the eyes of the large public and in particular of the cultural elite those superheroes fans do not have a high status: reading superheroes comic books is generally associated with childish behavior. The dilemma is, then, that a ﬁlm that too “faithfully” follows a comic will seldom be a good ﬁlm. Since it is another medium with other characteristics and rules, the director has to modify the original work. Just as in a historical movie, there is no way to render the situations exactly as they were; it is therefore much more important to try to be truthful to the spirit of the original work. Of course, every decision is open to discussion, and not all the decisions of a director are necessarily good decisions. The second problem relates to the transition from page layout to the image on a single screen. Whilst the images of a comic are mostly printed on paper, the images of a ﬁlm are projected on a screen, typically wide screen in a ﬁlm theatre or a television screen at home. The difference is important because the pages of a comic are in a closer range than the projected images of a ﬁlm. It is the readers who have to leaf through a comic and they can choose their own reading speed. They can linger on a panel, scan the complete plate, and return to panels or whole sequences at free will. A ﬁlm, though, obliges the viewer to follow the rhythm of the sequences. 14 In ﬁlm T H E P R O B L E M AT I C A D A P TAT I O N O F D R AW N I M A G E S\n\n[ 5 ]\n\nthe shots are put on a linear-time sequence; in comics the panels are not only placed in a linear sequence but also on a larger space, namely the page. In this sense comics are a more spatial medium than ﬁlm. In cinema, ﬁlming and montage are two quite separate phases. In comics, the drawing of the panels and the combination of the panels on a page cannot be that easily separated: choices in one domain have consequences in the other domain (Groensteen, “Du 7e au 9e art” 28).15 In addition, the interplay of the various panels (their relative dimensions and their location) is a constitutive aspect of the comics medium. Cinema with its moving images and standardized screen formats is not well equipped to imitate the page layouts of comics, although attempts are made. Sometimes ﬁlm directors use multiple-frame imagery or splitscreens imagery; two or more different images, each with its own frame dimensions and shape, appear within the larger frame (Bordwell & Thompson 125). This device is used in various comics adaptations. The Hulk DVD contains a bonus feature in which editor Tim Squyres and ILM compositor Mark Casey explain they did not want to imitate a comic book page layout because it would not work in ﬁlm, but they wanted to come up with some cinematic devices inspired by those dynamic pages. Since using multipleframe imagery is still quite unusual16—especially when the split-screens themselves are moving on the screen as in Hulk—it tends to surprise the viewer and to make him or her more aware of the ﬁlmic code of framing. It then functions as a self-referential technique. Though multiple-frame imagery is closer to comics, it breaks the usual cinematographic illusion. A third issue is the difference between drawn forms and photographic forms. Although both ﬁlm and comics make use of ﬂat images and similar shots (long, medium, and close-up),17 it is evident that the differences between the two media are more striking. A crucial and striking difference is that ﬁlm functions with moving images,18 while comics use static images.19 This difference between moving and still images is of paramount importance. By and large normal moving images will give a greater impression of realism. A viewer of a still image will always be reminded of the fragmented and frozen time. Nevertheless such an unmoving picture can also look realistic and credible, especially when it is of photographical nature. Cinema is foremost a photographic medium: a camera registers what is in [ 6 ]\n\nPA S C A L L E F È V R E\n\nfront of the lense.20 The photographic material ﬁxates the bundles of light rays. As in daily life the brain of a spectator in a movie theater has to interpret the pattern of light intensities provided by a photographic picture in order to extract features such as edges. Therefore the British psychologist John Willats (128) calls it an optical denotation system: the picture elements denote features of the array of light reaching the eye or the camera, rather than physical features of the scene such as edges and contours. By contrast to a photographic image a drawn panel from a comic usually offers clear edges. Generally the artist uses clear contour lines to denote the various objects in his pictures. Although such outlines in drawn pictures may be less analogous to the external world, they are not necessarily inferior in their capacity for grasping the essential aspects of a scene. Moreover, as art historian Philip Rawson (1979, 8–10) states, a welldeveloped language of marks can convey far more about what it represents than any mere copy of appearances. Good drawing always goes beyond appearances. A good portrait does not necessarily need a perfect imitation of all the individual traits, but rather the depiction of the essential aspects. Gestalt psychologist Rudolf Arnheim (149) claims that the better picture is one that leaves out unnecessary detail and chooses telling characteristics, but also that the relevant facts must be unambiguously conveyed to the eye. This outcome can be obtained by picture elements such as simplicity of shape, orderly grouping, distinction ﬁgure and ground, use of lighting and perspective and distortions.21 In addition a drawing offers many possibilities. A drawn image can more easily show impossible views (e.g. Escher) or combine various views (as in cubist art), and an artist will not be limited by budgets. Comic artists can choose their cast at will, imagine complete new worlds or civilizations; only their imagination and artistic skills pose restrictions on the creative act. The most fantastic scenes can simply be drawn in comics: people can ﬂy in the air; whole cities can be destroyed and so on. In the past it was quite complicated and difﬁcult to ﬁlm such scenes, but with the coming of digital techniques special effects entered a new age. Thanks to the combination of computer animation with live-action ﬁlming the most fantastic and credible scenes can be created: ordinary looking people transform ﬂuently into horrible monsters (e.g. Hulk), characters and objects ﬂy in the sky (e.g. The Matrix), deformations and exaggerations are possible T H E P R O B L E M AT I C A D A P TAT I O N O F D R AW N I M A G E S\n\n[ 7 ]\n\n(e.g. The Mask). Such imaginings, though, while now possible in cinema, can still be a point of criticism in comics ﬁlms when such effects do not live up to viewer/critic expectations of realism (such as, for example, criticism of the effects in early Hulk teaser trailers as cheesy). Also, of course, such effects remain quite expensive to do in that medium, especially when compared to the cost of a pencil as the necessary “special effects tool” for comic art. Arnheim suggests that every successful work of art, no matter how stylized and remote from mechanical correctness it may be, conveys the full natural ﬂavor of the object it represents. Rawson (1987, 78) tries to explain the richness of drawings: “Without precision in formulating the elements there can be no true variety; for it is only possible to recognize variety and variation if distinctions between the forms are made quite clear. And there can only be variety within an ordered structure, or else differences are simply chaos and not variation. Variation implies a substratum of norm-units which are varied.” The “language” of the form creates its own reality and has a personal touch. In contrast to an average photographic image, a drawing is literally and ﬁguratively “signed” (Groensteen, “Du 7e au 9e art” 23). “The structure of the artist’s visual thought is what matters; and somehow or other it must be ‘true,’ i.e. have a functional relationship to what artist and spectator accept as truth.” (Rawson, 1987, 23). A successful artistic solution is so compelling that it looks like the only possible realization of the subject (Arnheim 144). Hochberg and Brooks (382) even claim that comics approximate the ways in which people think of the visual world, which would be an explanation for their popularity. An artist not only depicts something, but s/he expresses at the same time a philosophy, a vision—but one rather difﬁcult to verbalize. Every drawing is by its style a visual interpretation of the world, in that it foregrounds the presence of an enunciator (Christiansen 115). The form of the drawing inﬂuences the manner the viewer will experience and interpret the drawing. A drawn image offers a speciﬁc view on reality and the creator’s subjectivity of this reality is built into the work, and a fairly obvious part of this work. The viewer is obliged to share this ﬁguratively view of the maker, and can not look at the object-in-picture from another visual point of view than the one the picture offers. The viewer, says ﬁlm scholar Jan-Marie Peters (14), is invited to share the maker’s mode of seeing, not [ 8 ]\n\nPA S C A L L E F È V R E\n\nonly in the literal, but also in the ﬁgurative sense. Nevertheless the reader is not just a passive agent: he or she looks at images with prior knowledge and activates the images. The perspective and style of the particular artist also may foreground—as a medium—the human-constructedness of images in comics, even for realistic drawing styles. This may perhaps encourage speculation from readers and polysemic meanings. And, of course, the individual context is thus also of considerable importance in introducing variability in reader interpretation. So every drawing style implies a certain interpretation of the reality in visual terms, a particular visual ontology (Rawson, 1987:19). A photographic image has, by its optic nature alone, a quite different visual ontology. Viewers do not react in the same way to a drawing as to a photographic image. Although photos can also be manipulated by using special software such as Photoshop, generally the viewer still accords more realism to a photo than to a stylized drawing. For instance, stylized drawings do not deliver a successful trompe l’oeuil, whereas an optic image can easily fool the eye and the mind of the viewer. That explains why a viewer more likely accepts violence in a drawn medium than in a photographic medium. If the violence of the Tom and Jerry animation series was not cartoonesque, but ﬁlmed with real-life cats and mice, the violence would probably seem much more difﬁcult to digest. Viewers tend to accept more from a stylized medium than from a photographic medium. The different visual ontology may also be the reason why it is extremely difﬁcult to adapt a strongly stylized or caricatured drawing in a photographic image. The failure of the various ﬁlmic adaptations of Hergé’s Tintin is exemplary, according to French writer and comics theorist Benoît Peeters: “Ambiguity is probably constitutive, because the work of Hergé balances between realism and caricature. The style of the artist—the famous ‘clear line’—is the unifying element of the work that guarantees its coherence; when this is lost, confusion and incredulousness surface. On the whole, the Tintin-adaptations are an indirect demonstration of how strongly the qualities of Hergé’s work are linked with the formal language of the comics medium.”22 Also the Italian ﬁlm scholar Antonio Costa (25) stresses the importance of the comics’ ﬁgurative fascination: “Cinema can try to substitute this by complex operations of selection and stylization of its own T H E P R O B L E M AT I C A D A P TAT I O N O F D R AW N I M A G E S\n\n[ 9 ]\n\nexpressive means.”23 As successful examples Costa mentions the art direction and photography of Tim Burton’s Batman (1989) and Warren Beatty’s Dick Tracy (1992). Elsewhere in this book Michael Cohen analyses in more detail what he calls Dick Tracy’s “aesthetic of artiﬁce” in production design, framing, prosthetic makeup and other techniques. Sin City (2005, Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller) and Immortel24 (2004, Enki Bilal) are rare examples of comic artists as crafty (co)directors of ﬁlms (see further in this book the analysis of Immortels). The mise-en-scene and the art direction are thus of paramount importance, because not only the characters, but also the decors are being deﬁned by the visual style of the drawing. Real locations often look too ordinary and are not adjusted to the ﬁctive and graphic world of a comic book. Most ﬁlmic adaptations however do not succeed in grasping the stylization or mood of the original work as was achieved in Sin City or Immortel. If a ﬁlm director does not ﬁnd a way to transpose the visual style into photographic images, s/he can also develop an alternative, such as in Annie and From Hell. The deliberate choice for a clearly artiﬁcial, but credible world seems to work well. When a comic is rendered in a more “realistic” style or in various styles, cinematographic adaptations seem to be less insuperable (e.g. Superman, Spider-Men, X-Men). Usually long-running comic book series do not have a unique deﬁning style: such series can be drawn and told in very different ways, costumes and looks can change in time. Series like Batman or Superman were not only written by different scriptwriters, but also drawn by scores of artists. One cannot confuse the angular Dick Sprang Batman (from the 1940s and 50s) with the stylish Neal Adams Batman (of the early 1970s) or, the minimalistic and chunky Frank Miller Batman (of 1986) or, the photorealist painted Dave McKean Batman (of 1989)—these are only some of the scores of artists who worked on Batman since 1939. Because Batman is multifaced a reader of a certain period can have a particular idea about Batman that is not necessarily shared by readers from others periods, or even another contemporary reader. Moreover, as Bennett and Woollacott (1987:59) have demonstrated in their study of James Bond, there is no stable meaning of such a popular ﬁgure. Bond or Batman can not be abstracted from the shifting orders of intertextuality through which their actual functioning has been organized and reorganized. This is also the case [ 10 ]\n\nPA S C A L L E F È V R E\n\nfor so called graphic novels. The various graphic treatments of the Harvey Pekar stories of American Splendor (since 1976) make a movie just another interpretation that ﬁt in well with that series’ visual eclecticism. Finally the use of sound in ﬁlms adds another layer of difference to the issue of adaptation. There was a time that the movies were more like comics. During the ﬁrst decades of cinema the actors and the narrator only received a “voice” through written texts on intertitles. But the introduction of sound in the late 1920s changed the nature of cinema drastically. All ﬁlms became “talkies”—except for some experimental ﬁlms. Sound is a powerful ﬁlm technique, because sound engages a distinct sense mode and sound can actively shape how the spectator perceives and interprets the image (Bordwell & Thompson 291–92). Comics do not have a sound track: music, voices and noises can only be suggested by stilled and visible signs (text, ideograms, balloons . . . ) printed on paper. It is possible to use similar techniques in ﬁlm, but they do not function as well. Except for tongue-in-cheek approaches as in the Batman television series (1966–68), onomatopoeia in a cinematographic context looks rather strange. The change from “silent” to “talkie” is fundamental. As in novels in comics a reader can never hear the sound of the characters’ voices.25 Of course, the written text can inform the reader about that aspect. Moreover in comics the visible appearance of the character and other ideograms can suggest the sound of a voice, but it remains largely an interpretation by the reader. It seems that at least some readers who imagine a particular sound of the characters voices are shocked by the way an actor speaks when playing that character. Not only the sound of a voice is different but also the way the characters speak. The texts in speech balloons are generally not suited for ﬁlm dialogue and they need some rewriting. Superhero comics, for example, often use very stylistic and bombastic dialogue; a literal screen translation may emphasize such dialogue’s artiﬁcial nature to the point of unintentional camp. Stan Lee (2000) explains how Ken Johnson changed the texts in The Incredible Hulk television series (1978–1982): “He changed it quite a bit from the comic book, but every change he made, made sense. In the comics, when the Hulk talked—he’d go, ‘Me Hulk! Me smash! Hulk kill!’ T H E P R O B L E M AT I C A D A P TAT I O N O F D R AW N I M A G E S\n\n[ 11 ]\n\nThat type of thing. Well, that would have been corny as hell on the screen. He left that out . . . He didn’t have the Hulk talk at all.” So the change from a “silent medium” to a “sound medium” poses also a lot of problems for the adaptation. The starting point of this article was the debate on the value of ﬁlmic adaptations of comics. Such ﬁlms may be popular, but they remain controversial, especially in the eyes of the cultural elite and the diehard comics fans. Although there are many similarities, the differences are still considerable. After a short look at the different reception and the production modes, four main problems were described at the creative level: ﬁrst, to what extent has a scriptwriter for ﬁlm to rewrite the story, second, how to go from page layout to a single, unchangeable screen frame, third, how to translate static drawings into moving and photographic images, and fourth, how to give the “silent world” an audible sound? These seem to be the crucial problems of ﬁlmic adaptations of comics. Although new computer technology facilitates the recreation of the comics’ fantastic allures, cinematographic adaptations remain problematic; not the least because the reader of a comic constructs a mental image of the ﬁctive world. Moreover, the reader adds elements that are not necessarily explicit in the comic, for instance the sound of the voices of the various characters. When an actor interprets a character from a comic, his/her voice does not always match the imagined voice by the reader. Given these differences, perhaps we should not be too purist concerning adaptations and accept that a work may inspire a creator in another medium. If we look at an adaptation, we should forget—for a moment—about the original work and evaluate the newly created work on its own merits. Films such as Annie, Dick Tracy, Batman, Ghost World, Hulk, American Splendor, Immortel or Sin City should be judged as movies and not as successful or unsuccessful adaptations of comics. After all, Western spectators who watched and enjoyed the Korean ﬁlm Old Boy (ChanWuk, 2004) usually did so without having read or even knowing about the original manga.\n\n[ 12 ]\n\nPA S C A L L E F È V R E\n\nDICK TRACY IN PURSUIT OF A COMIC BOOK AESTHETIC —MICHAEL COHEN\n\n“Reality was not our goal on this picture.” — Wa r r e n B e a t t y ( B o n i f e r, D i c k Tr a c y : T h e M a k i n g o f t h e M o v i e 1 2 )\n\nWhen Warren Beatty’s Dick Tracy arrived in 1990, it was the most meticulous effort to capture the aesthetic of a comic in a live-action ﬁlm, and paved the way for the exploration of the visual correlations lying dormant between cinema and comics. Although there are ontological differences between cinema and comics, and it is not possible for a live-action ﬁlm to replicate the formal properties of comics, Dick Tracy demonstrates how the cinema can adapt the conventions and characteristics of a comic. Dick Tracy is a fascinating ﬁlm for boldly tackling the differences between these two media, and in doing so deploys a combination of an “aesthetic of artiﬁce,” “cartooning,” framing of the hero, and “paneling,” to create a cinematic comic aesthetic. The result is a ﬁlm with eye-popping colors, a blatantly artiﬁcial diegesis, a bizarre mélange of villains, and a stalwart hero wearing a yellow hat and trench coat. Comics do not possess a singular style, or a ﬁnite set of visual attributes, which are either inherent to the medium or historically stable. In his article, “Shaping The Maxx,” Greg Smith explains that adapting material from different media “is necessarily a process of translation, since one cannot merely import forms from one medium to another” (32). Smith makes\n\n[ 13 ]\n\nthe point that characters, story, and iconography are easily transferred between media “because they appear to be the properties of a diegetic world and not characteristics distinct to a medium” (33). Chester Gould’s “Dick Tracy” originated as a comic strip in 1931, and in the late thirties ﬁlmed serials were produced, as well as a number of ﬁlms in the forties, either starring Ralph Byrd or Morgan Conway as the titular crime ﬁghter. All it took to transfer these actors into the famed detective was a suit and a hat, and the basic iconography of the profession: a gun and badge. The “comic aesthetic,” which distinguishes this latest version of Dick Tracy from many previous ﬁlms based on comics, is the “transference” of the characters and their iconography from comics into cinema together with the “adaptation” of the conventions and characteristics of the comic medium. There are four different aspects of Dick Tracy that combine to form a cohesive aesthetic: the fabrication of “Tracy Town” (Bonifer 42); the “cartooning” of props, characters, and behavior so they are excessive and implausible; the framing of Tracy (Warren Beatty); and ﬁnally, cinematic “panels.” It is the incorporation of multiple elements that generates this “comic aesthetic,” as Jon Landau, the production manager of Dick Tracy, explains: “It’s not a building with green windows that makes a comic book. It’s that same building with a Flattop character walking out of it, getting into the biggest, bluest limousine you’ve ever seen, and driving off on a red street into a matte painting. That’s a comic book!” (Bonifer 12). A number of exaggerated formal properties are associated with American crime ﬁghter and superhero comics, and these are the visual tropes engaged by Beatty to depict “Tracy Town” as the world of a comic. As Scott McCloud explains in Understanding Comics, the garish coloring is the result of the four-color printing process that became the standard in comic book production (187), and “to stand out from the competition, costumed heroes were clad in bright, primary colors and fought in a bright primary world” (188). Crime ﬁghting comic heroes belong on colored streets, chasing villains in a blur of motion lines. Such is Dick Tracy, with his chiseled features, wearing his yellow coat and hat, battling against Big Boy (Al Pacino), Flattop (William Forsythe), and the Brow (Chuck Hicks). Warren Beatty and his ﬁlm crew used the production design of Dick Tracy to turn a recognizable twentieth-century city into “Tracy Town.” The [ 14 ]\n\nMICHAEL COHEN\n\nspectator’s attention is drawn to the overt artiﬁce of Tracy’s milieu through the use of studio sets, backlots, painted backdrops, and matte paintings in the production design. These are all old techniques, found in all genres of ﬁlm, and are still prevalent in this age of digital technology. Used in combination with colored lighting reﬂecting off rain-soaked streets and primary colors painted directly onto Dick Tracy’s sets, “Tracy Town” is an implausible city proudly displaying the artiﬁce of its fabrication. The artiﬁce of a comic’s creation, consisting of hand-drawn images printed on paper, is an integral feature of its aesthetic, and affects the way the comic is received by the reader. Details such as backgrounds and facial features are difﬁcult in comics as it is a very time-consuming process. Alan McKenzie notes, in How to Draw and Sell Comic Strips for Newspapers and Comic Books!, that too much detail often detracts from the story as many readers do not absorb dense visual material (80). Rather than challenge these facts, the trend in superhero comics has been towards exaggeration and not verisimilitude: artiﬁce describes both the ontology of the media and the style of the genre. Cinema on the other hand is, potentially, an extremely realistic medium because the photographic process produces an accurate analogue of what is placed before it, and this grants the cinematographic image a level of plausibility not found in comics. Improvements in the quality and volume of special effects, particularly digital effects, contained in Hollywood features cast more doubt upon the validity of photographic reproductions. However, it remains that live-action Hollywood ﬁlms contain recordings of real people in real spaces, and this ontology informs how photography is perceived and accepted. As André Bazin states: “The objective nature of photography confers on it a quality of credibility absent from all other picture-making” (What Is Cinema, Vol. 1, 13). In their book, Sets in Motion: Art Direction and Film Narrative, Charles and Mirella Affron describe ﬁve different levels of production design, the fourth of which is relevant here: “artiﬁcial” sets. According to the Affrons, these sets “privilege their own artiﬁciality. Prominently featured, consciously foregrounded, the set as artiﬁce calls attention to itself as a consistently opaque object in pursuit of “the ﬁction effect.” Design is rendered speciﬁc and legible through the invention of the patently unreal” (39). The Affrons refer to a distinction between the “reality effect” and the “ﬁction effect” (113), which is important for distinguishing between cinematic worlds D I C K T R A C Y: I N P U R S U I T O F A C O M I C B O O K A E S T H E T I C\n\n[ 15 ]\n\nthat are plausible and Dick Tracy’s “Tracy Town” which is implausible. The “reality effect” keeps a ﬁlm grounded in a world that is plausible beyond the ﬁction, whereas the “ﬁction effect” of the artiﬁcial production design does not. By increasing the level of fabrication in a ﬁlm’s diegesis, reality is left behind and the ﬁction of the artiﬁce becomes “a primary focus of the narrative, challenging the force of plot and character” (Affron 39). However, the “comic aesthetic” does not challenge the plot and characters in Dick Tracy: because of their origin in a comic strip they are supported and enhanced by the “aesthetic of artiﬁce.” The methods of fabricating a ﬁlm’s diegesis are often incorporated inconspicuously during ﬁlm production so there is verisimilitude between the image and its referent. Verisimilitude and plausibility go hand in hand, and when these techniques are deployed in ﬁlms, whether in genres such as westerns, ﬁlm noir, and war ﬁlms, or in comedies and melodrama, the effect is usually transparent so the fabrication of the diegesis is not deliberately brought to the spectator’s attention. When deployed in fantastic or futuristic ﬁlms, the methods of diegetic fabrication are still usually transparent even though the spectator’s attention is drawn to the unfamiliarity of the diegesis. The fully artiﬁcial production design in Dick Tracy, which eschews the plausibility of the “reality effect,” enables this deﬁnition of a “comic aesthetic.” “Tracy Town” is implausible because the “ﬁction effect” created by the “opaque” deployment of the production design is stylistically linked to the narrative focus on a comic character. The gritty urban settings of the claustrophobic city, bustling streets, and darkened alleys in Dick Tracy engages the milieu of the ﬁlm noir and crime thriller genres as its narrative foundation, and it is the level of artiﬁce subsequently applied to this generic trope that creates the implausible comic-style world policed by the crime ﬁghter. To effectively fabricate a city such as “Tracy Town” ﬁlmmakers need to control the environment, and this requires studio sets and backlots. The diegetic foundation of the city is never fully obscured; on the contrary, it is integral to creating a “comic aesthetic.” Richard Sylbert, the production designer for Dick Tracy, explains: “If you’re going to do Dick Tracy there’s only one way to do it, and that’s with icons, where a car is just a car and a building is just a building. A backlot is nothing but a series of icons—of a [ 16 ]\n\nMICHAEL COHEN\n\nFig. 1. The production design is sparse and clean, devoid of realistic minutiae, to mimic the limitations of the comic strip, which cannot reproduce realistic details in a single panel.\n\ncity or a village or a town” (Bonifer 80). Dick Tracy illustrates how removing details in the set decoration and leaving only the necessary ﬁxtures of a particular referent creates an uncluttered look to each environment (Bonifer 86). As Sylbert explains: “If it [the set design] became too realistic, too atmospheric, it wouldn’t work. We started out with atmosphere, but we took it out. You couldn’t have clouds and fog” (Bonifer 86). Because a “realistic” level of detail is not possible in a comic, particularly a small panel in a daily strip of “Dick Tracy,” it creates a form of artiﬁce in the medium, which the ﬁlmmakers of Dick Tracy have “translated” into the production design. The exteriors are noticeably clean and do not display the deterioration expected in a real environment, and the mise-en-scène of the interiors is also devoid of surplus details and decoration beyond the denotation of the basic set dressing. D I C K T R A C Y: I N P U R S U I T O F A C O M I C B O O K A E S T H E T I C\n\n[ 17 ]\n\nDick Tracy was shot on a studio backlot, and many exterior shots use matte paintings to extend the image or to replace conventional sets. The opening sequence of the ﬁlm introduces this approach as the style for the rest of the ﬁlm. As Harrison Ellenshaw, the visual effects supervisor on Dick Tracy, states: “The reason it was decided to make the ﬁrst scene in the movie a matte shot was to get us immediately into Tracy’s environment . . . We’re in a comic book. Boom. You’re into the characters and the story, and it all meshes perfectly with that ﬁrst thirty-second shot” (Bonifer 43). Traditionally, most shots involving matte paintings are unsophisticated and do not use camera movement. The matte painting used during the opening of Dick Tracy is more sophisticated in its integration of celanimation, as well as its incorporation of complicated camera movements. This matte painting connects the opening shot of Tracy getting ready for work to another scene in an alley on the other side of town, which introduces the Kid (Charlie Korsmo), the young orphan who will become Tracy’s sidekick.1 A camera movement tracking up the outside of Tracy’s apartment to the top of the building reveals the expanse of the city depicted in the matte painting. The camera then tracks left revealing more of the city in the distance as well as in foreground elements. The artiﬁce of this shot is unmistakable: the setting sun casts a yellow-orange hue over the city of purple buildings, and the cel-animated elements, such as smoke stacks and trains, resemble cartoons. At the end of the ﬁlm, Tracy drives off into the sunset heading into another matte painting as “The End” appears. As Ellenshaw claims: “In this movie the matte paintings are the reality” (Bonifer 43). The combination of set design and matte paintings is elaborately enhanced by the use of colored lighting, as well as the application of colors directly on the sets. In some instances it is the choice of coloring that changes the set or a prop from being plausible to being completely unrealistic. In cinema and photography, objects and characters are made visible by the light shone on them. This lighting also shapes and deﬁnes their presence, and varieties of common lighting patterns are often used. Characters and objects in comics are not enabled and shaped by the reﬂection of light; therefore, parts of an image can be as dark or light as required, without affecting other areas. Black outlines deﬁne most graphic material on a page and within the panel, and the effect of lighting is actually determined by [ 18 ]\n\nMICHAEL COHEN\n\nFig. 2. The ﬁlm is book-ended by matte paintings, creating an unmistakable cartoon-style opening and closing.\n\nthe lightness or darkness between demarcated ﬁelds of solid color, or black and white. This is enhanced with shape lines to give deﬁnition and volume to characters and objects. Solid color ﬁelds are a common stylistic feature of comics and are often used instead of drawing backgrounds in detail, which saves time, and heightens the dramatic context of the foreground. In Dick Tracy colored lighting reﬂected off wet streets, particularly during night sequences, emulates the solid color ﬁelds of a comic. Single primary colors are used for costumes, sets, cars, and props. In some scenes the background coloring is strongly demarcated from the silhouette of a character in the foreground. To create the impression of solid color ﬁelds in the windows of buildings colored gels were used. However, the effect of creating colored ﬁelds similar to a comic is complicated by the variations that occur between the color, the material, and the lighting. A limited number D I C K T R A C Y: I N P U R S U I T O F A C O M I C B O O K A E S T H E T I C\n\n[ 19 ]\n\nof colors were used in the production design and costuming for Dick Tracy in an attempt to capture the limitation of the four-color printing process found in traditional comics. When discussing the limited number of colors used, the ﬁlm’s costume designer, Milena Canonero, explains, “with the way materials react to color and light, it may seem that there are nuances, but in fact there are just those ten [colors]. No browns, no midtones, no grays” (Bonifer 63). The loss of color on one object is usually made up for with the saturation of color on another object. For example, the colored lighting on the set causes Tracy’s raincoat to lose the brightness of its yellow. Sets, backlots, mattes, and models are actually unsophisticated staples of cinema, and improvements in technology are usually aimed at making them more transparent. However, Dick Tracy eschews the “reality effect” which comes so easily to cinema, and pursues a “ﬁction effect” through the “opaque” deployment of the common cinematic techniques outlined. The artiﬁce of its diegetic fabrication does not make “Tracy Town” any less recognizable as a twentieth-century city; instead, it challenges its plausibility. The Affrons state: “All constructed movie sets are artiﬁcial, of course. . . . We reserve ‘artiﬁce’ and ‘artiﬁcial’ for those that refuse to let us forget it” (114), and in Dick Tracy the artiﬁcial set refuses to let the spectator forget this ﬁlm is based on a comic. A strategy of “cartooning” in Dick Tracy makes the choreography of character actions and behavior implausible, and complements the “aesthetic of artiﬁce” in the production design. Whether it is exaggerated ﬁlming effects, such as sped up footage, or the outrageous behavior of the characters themselves, “cartooning” transcends the communication of the story: the narrative referent becomes abstracted into a stylistic representation. “Cartooning” also includes the design of the villains using prosthetic makeup, and the design of their props and weapons, so that they all resemble the caricatures found in the pages of comics. Deployed in combination with an artiﬁcial production design, the result is a comic-style diegesis populated by outrageous characters, wielding farfetched weapons, whom look and behave as “cartoons.” Comics are the product of the relationship between hand and page and are inherently artiﬁcial. However, superhero comics are not only dis[ 20 ]\n\nMICHAEL COHEN\n\ntinguished by the artiﬁce of the graphic process. Typically, comics are excessive and ﬂamboyant in their use of color, character proportion, and the choreography and depiction of action. To translate this artiﬁce and excess into a cinematic form Warren Beatty and his creative team used a number of stylistic strategies that can be described as “cartooning,” which is another way of elevating the “aesthetic of artiﬁce” in Dick Tracy. At ﬁrst glance, any relationship between “cartooning” and live-action cinema is problematic, since cartoons are hand-drawn caricatures. In his article, “Delirious Inventions,” Mike Atkinson states, “the relationship of both cartoons and comics to actuality has always been antagonistic” (12). “Cartoon” is also a common term for cel-animation of hand-drawn caricatures. As John Geipel explains in The Cartoon: A Short History of Graphic Comedy and Satire, “the popular use of the term ‘cartoon’ as a synonym of ‘animated ﬁlm’ is long-established and probably indelible . . . later reinforced by the universal popularity of Mickey Mouse, Bugs Bunny, Popeye and other celluloid heroes” (150). This simpliﬁed explication of “cartooning” as being less than serious fails to take into account that many comics and animated cartoons can be humorous, dramatic, or horriﬁc. However, the deﬁnition of “cartooning” applied to Dick Tracy mirrors both the continuing perception that comics and superheroes are childish or juvenile, and the stylistic approach of Beatty. Will Eisner explains that the “cartoon is the result of exaggeration and simpliﬁcation. Realism is adherence to most of the detail. The elimination of some of the detail in an image makes it easier to digest and adds to humor. Retention of detail begets believability because it is closest to what the reader actually sees” (Comics and Sequential Art 151). In Dick Tracy “cartooning” is used to preclude the plausibility of characters and their actions by either removing or countering the “realistic” detail recorded by the camera. Such strategies include speeding up footage and other techniques to draw attention to the fabrication of cinematic production. As Scott McCloud states: “By stripping down an image to its essential ‘meaning,’ an artist can amplify that meaning in a way that realistic art can’t” (Understanding Comics 30). In this sense, “cartooning” is not necessarily a move closer to the ontology of comics; it is a move away from the potential “realism” of cinema, and towards abstraction and excess. “By de-emphasizing the appearance of the physical world in favor of the idea D I C K T R A C Y: I N P U R S U I T O F A C O M I C B O O K A E S T H E T I C\n\n[ 21 ]\n\nof form, the cartoon places itself in the world of concepts” (McCloud, Understanding Comics 41). The more abstracted the image becomes the more it represents concepts and ideas, and the less it represents its referent in the real world. McCloud claims, “when we abstract an image through cartooning, we’re not so much eliminating details as we are focusing on speciﬁc details” (Understanding Comics 30). In Dick Tracy, the use of bright and unrealistic coloring on sets and props emphasizes the concept or “idea” of the referent by exaggerating and simplifying it. The design of props in Dick Tracy operates similarly to the way the production design uses excessive artiﬁce to add to the “ﬁction effect.” Whether it is the exaggeration of proportions, or the application of coloring, the characters in Dick Tracy wield and handle an array of weapons and props that are farfetched and implausible. The villains themselves are covered in prosthetic makeup: a literal and metaphorical layer of artiﬁce upon the actors. This deﬁnition of “cartooning” extends beyond Eisner and McCloud, to include the choreography of actions and behavior of characters, which is self-consciously “goofy” and incongruous with plausibility; it is embellished and enhanced beyond narrative justiﬁcation. “Cartooning” is established from the start of Dick Tracy when Flattop uses his Tommy gun to write the words EAT LEAD TRACY on the back wall of the garage, clearly linking the ﬁlm with the animated television series, The Dick Tracy Show (1961), where characters would do the same. However, writing on a wall with a machine gun is not something in the original comic strip, and this is therefore an example of explicit “cartooning,” rather than a reference to the comic strip. When Tracy ﬁghts and arrests Steve the Tramp, he swings his arms around wide amplifying the motion of his punches. The ﬁlm is sped up to further exaggerate the effect of the ﬁght. This “cartooning” is carried over into a shot outside of the shack rocking back and forth, emphasizing the force of Tracy’s attack on the thug. When Tracy utters the line, “maybe we should step outside,” he punches the Tramp right through the side of the shack and onto the ground. This sequence is a demonstration of “cartooning” because Tracy does not have superpowers that would narratively explain the exaggerated depiction of the action.\n\n[ 22 ]\n\nMICHAEL COHEN\n\nFig. 3. EAT LEAD TRACY on the back wall of the garage links the ﬁlm with the animated television series from the 1960s, and Tracy’s exaggerated punches turn the action into a live action cartoon.\n\nDick Tracy has two montage sequences that demonstrate the artiﬁce of “cartooning” in the depiction of action. In both sequences Breathless Mahoney, played by Madonna, sings songs describing narrative developments: “Sooner or Later (I always get my man)” and “Back in Business.” In the ﬁrst sequence, Tracy is able to foil Big Boy’s crime operations by being on the scene in time to nab the criminals in the act. In the second sequence, Big Boy and his men launch a crime spree after Tracy has been framed and imprisoned. In both sequences, the action is abstracted from literal to “cartoon” representations. In one shot, Tracy punches out seven gangsters advancing on him with one punch, and in another shot he sends a gangster ﬂying backwards through the air. During the crime spree the gangsters\n\nD I C K T R A C Y: I N P U R S U I T O F A C O M I C B O O K A E S T H E T I C\n\n[ 23 ]\n\nFig. 4. Two montage sequences demonstrate the artiﬁce of “cartooning” in the exaggerated depiction of action, such as Tracy’s knockout punches and the gangsters’ looting and shakedowns.\n\nthrow their victims out of windows, and two gangsters literally shake a victim upside down causing coins fall out of his pockets onto the ground. The functionality and plausibility of props in Dick Tracy is deemphasized using design and coloring, so they are abstracted into the denotation of their referents. Although ﬁlm sets and props are often nonfunctioning they are usually designed to be perceived as functional. The spectator’s suspension of disbelief is contingent upon the perception of a prop’s functionality that is easily achieved using recognizable “real-world” designs. In Dick Tracy, the functionality and believability of the props is strictly limited to the denotation of the referent, and their implausible appearance is contingent and justiﬁed by the ﬁlm’s relationship with the comics. The design of these props has a cumulative effect with the fabrication of the artiﬁcial diegesis, as well as with the narrative context, which forms the “aes[ 24 ]\n\nMICHAEL COHEN\n\nthetic of artiﬁce.” In “Tracy Town,” the outrageous props are only believable when in the hands of its crime ﬁghter and its villains. A sequence involving a boiler room in Dick Tracy demonstrates how the use of color lends implausibility to the props. The boiler is painted bright yellow with red pipes and handles to emphasize its artiﬁce. Itchy (Ed O’Ross), one of Big Boy’s henchmen, also wields a wrench in this scene which is painted bright red. As the boiler gets closer and closer to explosion, it begins to rock furiously and shake on its foundations, steam bursts from various pipe seams, and whistles blare. The “cartooning” of these props complements the outrageousness of Big Boy’s plan to kill Tracy with the exploding boiler. The abstraction of props extends to the use of generic labels so that the products, such as a can of chili Dick Tracy eats from, do not have the D I C K T R A C Y: I N P U R S U I T O F A C O M I C B O O K A E S T H E T I C\n\n[ 25 ]\n\nFig. 5. The abstraction of props extends to the use of generic labels, such “EXTRA” and “Daily Paper” to identify newspapers.\n\ncomplicated design patterns that are usually found on commercial products, and they are colored in single primary colors. In addition, generic labels, such as “EXTRA” and “Daily Paper,” identify newspapers. In Dick Tracy, the transference of the villains and gangsters from the panels of the comic strip required complicated makeup and prosthetics, which abstracts and exaggerates a particular feature of each character. In this way literal names describe the character’s facial features: Flattop has a ﬂat head; The Brow has a strangely bulbous forehead; and so on with Little Face (Lawrence Steven Meyers), The Rodent (Neil Summers), and others. There is no exploration of the psychology or background of each villain because the prosthetic design creates the phrenology of a criminal. By abstracting the design of the villains the ﬁlmmakers “amplify” the evil nature of these caricatures, which places them “in the world of concepts” (McCloud, Understanding Comics 41). Warren Beatty uses the design of props and characters, and the choreography of their actions and their behavior, to bridge the ontological gap between live action cinema and comics, albeit at a superﬁcial level. As Atkinson explains, “[w]hen using actors and real settings . . . what results is perilously entangled in formal incongruities” (12). These “incongruities,” these tropes of exaggeration are “cartooning,” which is how Beatty has translated the aesthetic of cartoons into a live-action ﬁlm. Taken in isolation these elements of “cartooning” might be considered aberrant. The suspension of disbelief required to accept the embellished behavior and\n\n[ 26 ]\n\nMICHAEL COHEN\n\nFig. 6. Complicated makeup and prosthetics abstract and exaggerate a particular feature of each character, such as Flattop and The Brow.\n\nactions and the bizarre collection of villains is contingent upon accepting their implausibility as a cinematic “translation” of a comic aesthetic. Dick Tracy goes beyond simply transferring the character from the comic pages to the screen using elaborate costuming; the ﬁlm illustrates the hero’s iconic speciﬁcity through conspicuous framing and lighting. Tracy is introduced in shots that allow the spectator to fully contemplate the visual design of the character. The hero does not just pose for the camera, he pauses for a length of time which transcends the narrative moment, fulﬁlling the role of “the graphic center of narrative focus” (“The Aesthetics of the Comic Strip” 650) in comic panels, described by Robert Harvey. The most popular comic book crime ﬁghters and superheroes have\n\nD I C K T R A C Y: I N P U R S U I T O F A C O M I C B O O K A E S T H E T I C\n\n[ 27 ]\n\nentered into popular culture with an enormous impact. Their origins and their eternal battles with a gallery of arch nemeses are endlessly replayed across decades of comics, as well as cinema and television. The plot of Dick Tracy is inevitably a distillation of story elements from the character’s comic history across different eras, to create a contemporary version. In “The Superhero with a Thousand Faces: Visual Narratives on Film and Paper,” Luca Somigli claims, “[t]he development of comic book narratives over time can be characterized as sameness with difference, as a reshufﬂing of a number of narrative elements into new patterns” (289). This is how the most popular of characters remain fresh over their lifespan, even though some comic characters are more than half a century old. As Somigli states, “a comic book character is always already a remake” (286). This is true, yet wherever they go, wherever they are remade, they carry with them essential deﬁning attributes and iconic designs for which they are famous, and this allows them to be instantly recognizable across various media. Born of a visual medium, the most prominent feature of comic heroes is their appearance, and it is not surprising that ﬁlms based on comics trade so heavily on the visual appearance of their characters. In Dick Tracy the iconic features of the hero’s costume are a yellow hat and coat he wore in the colored Sunday comic strips. Despite slight alterations in the depiction of his facial features, Tracy has always had the same general visage, which conveniently suits the casting of Warren Beatty. Beatty’s features are not quite as “chiseled” as Chester Gould’s depiction; however, the costume is the primary icon deﬁning the character. The opening shot of Dick Tracy is of Tracy’s famous two-way watch-radio, his badge, and his gun all arranged neatly on the dresser. Tracy picks up these three icons of his profession, before the camera pans upwards to reveal the bright yellow hat hanging on a hook on the wall, which completes the character. Comic characters do not move on the page: they are locked into the postures and poses selected for each panel. The frozen posture is the event of the panel, and often depicts an entire continuity of action. The depiction of motion by conventions in the artwork is complemented by the static nature of the image, which imbues it with a contemplative potential: even though the image might suggest or be part of a continuous motion, it can be scrutinized and savored in a way cinematic images cannot. When Tracy is leaving his apartment he pauses in the doorway, framed and lit in [ 28 ]\n\nMICHAEL COHEN\n\nsilhouette, to check his watch-radio. This is not the narrative act of a character establishing the time, but a posture to establish the hero based on the icons of his representation, his watch-radio, hat, and coat, which are very speciﬁc to the historical character of Dick Tracy. When Tracy does stop and pose the spectator can focus on the character’s visual attributes and contemplate his presence within the frame. During the “Sooner or Later (I always get my man)” montage, Tracy walks toward the camera ﬁring his Tommy gun. The strong backlighting from a single source forms a halo of light around the character. The effect is the reverse of a comic image, where the background would be a light color or white and the character bordered by an outline of black. The outline of light in the ﬁlm performs a similar function to a drawn border: it separates Tracy from his background. An important distinction between this shot and a comic is that the light simultaneously casts a shadow over Tracy’s features, diminishing the detail of his face.\n\nFig. 7. Strong backlighting forms a halo of light around the character, which is the reverse of a comic image, where the background would be a light color or white and the character bordered by an outline of black\n\nThe stylistic deployment of Dick Tracy is an integral element of this deﬁnition of a “comic aesthetic” because it “translates” the privileged posturing and appearance of the hero upon the comic page. The very nature of a comic in the hands of a reader grants it the potential for contemplation at the reader’s discretion. The page does not need to be turned and the next panel can wait while the reader appreciates the visual design of the character. Drawn in postures to accentuate the explosive potential and implications of an action, the comic character is a dynamic ﬁgure caught frozen D I C K T R A C Y: I N P U R S U I T O F A C O M I C B O O K A E S T H E T I C\n\n[ 29 ]\n\nupon the page. Freezing a character upon the screen for a lengthy period would be a dubious strategy: certainly possible, but narratively awkward as it has the potential to disrupt spectator engagement. Without freezing the image, the Tracy poses and the camera unobtrusively records him, whilst the spectator contemplates the heroic poise of the crime ﬁghter during this narrative pause. Describing a relationship between the mechanisms of cinema and comics is a more complicated proposition than attaining an ornate and colorful mise-en-scène, or costume design, or similarly developing a “cartooning” effect. Although cinema and comics use images in sequence, both utilize different mechanisms of narrative communication. “Paneling” is the use of framing and editing to adapt the paradigmatic arrangement of panels in a strip into a cinematic form and is the most complex of the strategies deployed in the creation of a “comic aesthetic” in Dick Tracy. It is possible to compare the functional and aesthetic equivalencies between Dick Tracy and the original comics, to determine the extent to which the “paneling” transcends the ontological differences between the media. Francis Lacassin contends in his article, “The Comic Strip and Film Language,” that the “language” of comics was developed before its equivalent in cinema, despite the intellectual and critical preference consistently granted to the cinema. As he develops his argument, Lacassin makes two bold claims: “The comic-strip page demonstrably corresponds to the ﬁlm sequence,” and “[t]he daily comic strip of three or four images is comparable to the cinematic scene” (11). These claims do not stand up to rigorous scrutiny because Lacassin simpliﬁes the mechanism of both cinema and comics, and he does not provide a deﬁnition of either a ﬁlm sequence or a cinematic scene. As with all narrative media, the boundaries determining the “sequence” or the “scene” are often arbitrary, whereas a page in a comic book or a tier in a comic strip are ﬁnite spaces. However, the goal in this article is not to reconcile the mechanistic differences between the two media, but rather to explain how the deployment of cinematographic frames and shots, in isolation and juxtaposition, can be compared with the aesthetic of panels in comics. Both cinema and comics use images in sequence, yet the nature of the sequence is different: “each successive frame of a movie is projected [ 30 ]\n\nMICHAEL COHEN\n\non exactly the same space—the screen—while each frame of comics must occupy a different space” (McCloud, Understanding Comics 7). As Robert Harvey states, panels are always present with each other upon the page, and layout is a function in a comic for which there is no equivalent in cinema: “Only in the comics does layout assist in storytelling” (Art of the Comic Book 162). For this reason, Will Eisner explains there is a necessary level of cooperation on the part of the reader, that they will follow the narrative sequence instead of skipping ahead (Comics and Sequential Art 40). Control is taken out of the hands of the spectator in cinema, but is literally held in the hands of the comic book reader. As Greg Smith describes the process, the “comics readers ﬁrst see the page as a whole before they then parse through the individual frames in narrative succession. The comics page is ﬁrst understood as a unit, and then the reader ﬁts the component frames into that overall structure” (44). Even with the control afforded by video and DVD, cinema spectators cannot control and experience the juxtaposition of images in the same way they can with a comic. Although readers are guided by the traditional reading sequence and the artwork in a comic, they are able to read and reread the sequence in and out of order, and experience the spatial proximity of the panels as they read. As Harvey explains: “Simply by being chosen, [the piece of action] is captured and thus destined for longer contemplation than is possible for an equivalent action in a ﬁlm” (The Art of the Comic Book 178). Striking and dramatic poses in comics are designed with this contemplation in mind. However, in “Comic Art: Characteristics and Potentialities of a Narrative Medium,” Lawrence Abbott explains, “[s]everal minutes of picture contemplation would be out of the question because the story continuity would be broken. Each drawing on the comic strip/ book page has its allotted reading time, without which narrative continuity would be severely hindered” (162). The ﬁrst place to begin a comparison of cinematic frames with comic panels is with the aspect ratios. In the original “Dick Tracy” comic strips there is consistency in the shapes and sizes of the panels due to the traditional comic strip layout established in newspaper publishing. In a daily strip, there are usually four panels with an aspect ratio of approximately 0.8:1, and in the Sunday color pages there are typically three tiers divided into four panels each with aspect ratios varying from 1.1:1 to 1.3:1,2 which D I C K T R A C Y: I N P U R S U I T O F A C O M I C B O O K A E S T H E T I C\n\n[ 31 ]\n\nis very close to the original Academy ratio of 1.37:1.3 These aspect ratios are all close to being square. In Dick Tracy the choice to use the narrower aspect ratio of 1.85:1 was made with direct reference to the panels of the original comic strip: “It was ﬁnally determined that a tighter frame, a standard aspect ratio of 1.85:1 . . . would come closer to duplicating the presentation of the original comic strip” (Bonifer 54–55). However, the choice of one frame ratio over the other in a ﬁlm does not equate to the ontology of a comic. The 1.85:1 ratio does not resemble the size and shape of panels, and a cinematographic frame does not resemble the hand-drawn art, so a proﬁtable comparison between cinema and comics requires more than a side-by-side inspection. Individual panels are often called upon to be more than a single link in a sequence, and are used to depict the continuity of an action. Eisner refers to this as “encapsulation” (Comics and Sequential Art 39), where a single panel represents the “before” and “after” of an action. The panel does not freeze a moment in time; instead it has what Lacassin calls “dynamic time,” which “represents the time span necessary for the unfolding of an action” (17). The panel’s pictorial content embodies the preceding action and suggests the subsequent action through a number of conventional devices, such as character posture, motion lines, multiple images, as well as dialogue and narration. It is therefore a part of a temporal sequence of narrative: “In a panel selected from a series, the frozen posture tells its story— giving information about the before and after of the event” (Eisner, Comics and Sequential Art 105). Unlike cinema, the comic artist has to distill hundreds of movements comprising a simple gesture into one tableau: “The comic strip abbreviates movement, or rather relieves it of certain phases and contracts the time necessary for its execution” (Lacassin 18). This tableau has to support dialogue, story, emotion, and action. In Dick Tracy, Warren Beatty chose to keep the action within stationary frames to “encapsulate” each narrative unit without moving the camera or relying on editing. According to cinematographer Vittorio Storaro, “we were trying to use elements from the original Chester Gould drawings. One of the elements is that the story is usually told in vignette. So what we tried to do is never move the camera at all. Never. Try to make everything work in the frame . . . Camera movement is normally your grammar\n\n[ 32 ]\n\nMICHAEL COHEN\n\nFig. 8.

In this case we were trying to use a camera that was steady all the time” (Bonifer 54). This is certainly not the case throughout the whole ﬁlm, as the camera does move frequently, with particularly elaborate shots incorporating matte paintings. However, there is a strategy to keep the camera motionless at very conspicuous moments where a moving, panning, or tracking shot would have been the norm.
