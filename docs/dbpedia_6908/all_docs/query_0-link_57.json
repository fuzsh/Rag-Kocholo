        "text": "Sharing is caring!\n\nLooking for German movies to watch?\n\nImproving your foreign language skills through the arts of German movies and tv shows is not only very fun – it is also very effective and useful.\n\nWhy learn a language through German movies?\n\nThe themes that are featured in movies are often very telling of the things that are big issues in a country.\n\nIn Brazil, there are many movies involving favelas and police squads.\n\nNow, this doesn’t mean everyone in Brazil lives in a favela, but these movies could not be made in for example Sweden.\n\nThey tell you something about the different realities and world views that can exist within a country, even if they are fictional.\n\nA lot of Western movies revolve around Christmas, and that is because Christmas is a very important celebration in Western culture, and it is no longer strictly related to religion.\n\nAdditionally, yes, lots of German movies feature themes surrounding the second world war.\n\nFor obvious reasons, this is an important part of German culture, and watching German movies can help you better understand how the country deals with it.\n\nAnother great thing about watching German movies is that it is the easiest way to be exposed to real speech.\n\nIn comparison to most language courses, these conversations aren’t meant to perfectly match the words you just had to learn with spaces in between the sentences to have you process it.\n\nMuch of what you will hear you won’t be able to understand and that is exactly why you should watch it.\n\nThe best thing is that you are exposed to the way native people speak without having to respond to it.\n\nYou also have the ability to add subtitles, be it in your own language or the language you are trying to learn, or pause it and write things down.\n\nAll of these reasons make German movies and tv shows the perfect aid for your language learning journey.\n\nSo, without any further ado let’s get into the list. Here are 20 German movies you must watch when you are learning German.\n\n20 German Movies\n\n1. Das Leben der Anderen\n\n“The Lives of Others (German: Das Leben der Anderen) is a 2006 German drama film, marking the feature film debut of filmmaker Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck, about the monitoring of East Berlin residents by agents of the Stasi, the GDR‘s secret police. It stars Ulrich Mühe as Stasi Captain Gerd Wiesler, Ulrich Tukuras his superior Anton Grubitz, Sebastian Koch as the playwright Georg Dreyman, and Martina Gedeck as Dreyman’s lover, a prominent actress named Christa-Maria Sieland.”\n\n2.

The film received critical acclaim upon release and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film.”\n\n3. Gegen die Wand\n\n“Cahit Tomruk is a Turkish German in his 40s. He has given up on life after the death of his wife and seeks solace in cocaine and alcohol. One night, he intentionally drives his car head-on into a wall and barely survives. At the psychiatric clinic he is taken to, Sibel Güner, another Turkish German who has tried to commit suicide, approaches him. She asks Cahit to carry out a formal marriage with her so that she can break out of the strict rules of her conservative family. Cahit is initially turned off by the idea, but then he agrees to take part in the plan.”\n\n4. Auf der andere Seite\n\n“Retired widower Ali Aksu (Tuncel Kurtiz), a Turkish immigrant living in the German city of Bremen, believes he has found a solution to his loneliness when he meets Yeter Öztürk (Nursel Köse). He offers her a monthly payment to stop working as a prostitute and move in with him. After receiving threats from two Turkish Muslims for the work she does, she decides to accept his offer. Ali’s son, Nejat Aksu (Baki Davrak), a professor of German literature, does not have time to respond to the prospect of living with a woman of “easy virtue” before Ali is stricken with a heart attack. He softens to her: he learns that she has told her 27-year-old daughter she is a shoe saleswoman, sending shoes to her in Turkey to support that story, and wishes her daughter could receive an education like his.”\n\n5.
