Time and again, it offers new programme concepts, and this year the BJO – which brings together German musical talents aged 14 to 19 – is blazing new trails as ever. “Fairy-Tales […]",

        "text": "When it comes to new programming ideas and intriguing concert projects, the Bundesjugendorchester (National Youth Orchestra of Germany, or BJO) is always ahead of the game. Last year it won an Echo Classic Award in the category “Classical for Children” together with Campino of “Die Toten Hosen”. At Young Euro Classic, where the BJO has been among the regulars from the first festival year onwards, its palette of unusual concerts already includes an orchestral accompaniment for the silent movie Nathan der Weise in 2010 s well as the premiere of a Concerto for Electric Cello and Orchestra at the 2016 festival. Following its motto “Playing. Supporting. Raising Enthusiasm”, the young musicians aged 14 to 19, most of them first prize winners of the Federal music competition “Jugend musiziert”, meet for several intense rehearsal periods per year. The BJO has long become one of Germany’s most important cultural ambassadors, as its concert tours to Tunisia (2014) and the three Baltic States, to Rumania and China (2015) and Mexico (2016) demonstrate. Since 2013 the Berlin Philharmonic has been the patron orchestra of the Bundesjugendorchester, holding joint rehearsals, master courses and concerts.\n\nwww.bundesjugendorchester.de\n\nSomething to be proud of: Dietmar Bär, who plays the character of Freddy Schenk in the Cologne Tatort crime series, was voted the most popular TV investigator in Germany in 2014. He has played the Detective Inspector in over 60 cases since 1997 and won the German Television Award in 2000. Together with Klaus J. Behrendt, he received the Order of Merit of North Rhine-Westphalia in 2015 from Prime Minister Hannelore Kraft. Dietmar Bär, a native of Dortmund, considers it of extreme importance to remain close to his people. As often as he can, the ardent fan of Borussia Dortmund mixes with the fans in the stadium in his black and yellow jersey. His daily life, however, is rather different from the rough big guy with an insatiable appetite for “currywurst” he plays in the Tatort series. Dietmar Bär loves to read, listens to all kinds of music and has developed into a gourmet with vegetarian preferences: “I am too old for cheap wine and bad food.” However, he is not too old for the various social causes he supports: Bär is a founding member of “Tatort – Straßen der Welt e.V.” which supports children’s rights in the Philippines, in Swaziland and Germany. And he supports Young Euro Classic not only as an evening patron, but also as a member of the German Association of Friends of European Youth Orchestras e.V.\n\nThe conductor Patrick Lange launched his international career from Berlin. Here, he was First Conductor at the Komische Oper starting in 2008 before filling the vacant position of General Music Director from 2010 to 2012, with the title of chief conductor. During this time, he conducted important premieres, such as Wagner’s Meistersinger, Dvořák’s Rusalka and Mozart’s Idomeneo. At the same time, Lange made his debut at the Vienna State Opera in 2010, where he has returned regularly ever since, most recently in 2016, when he led Puccini’s Tosca and Tchaikovsky’s Eugene Onegin. He has appeared in Dresden and Hamburg and at the opera houses in Zurich, London, Paris, Seoul and Toronto. Most recently, the 36-year-old conducted a new production of Lulu at the Weimar Opera. In the autumn of 2017 he will become General Music Director in Wiesbaden. A former assistant to Claudio Abbado at the Gustav Mahler Jugendorchester, Lange is also in high demand as a concert conductor and has already worked with the National Youth Orchestra of Germany several times.\n\nRalf König became known to a broader audience when his comic book Der bewegte Mann was released as a movie featuring Katja Riemann and Til Schweiger in 1994. Previously, the comic-strip artist from Soest, Westphalia had already found enthusiastic fans for his chronicles of gay life, for example Silvestertuntenball and Sahneschnittchen. These were followed by volumes such as Superparadise (about Aids) and Sie dürfen sich jetzt küssen (about gay marriage). With an overall circulation of almost seven million books, Ralf König became the world’s most popular author of explicitly homosexual stories. His works have been translated into more than a dozen languages, most recently into Catalan, Gaelic and Polish. The artist, who is 56 today, found another focus for his work in Dschinn Dschinn (2006), which deals with radical Islamism. The same year, he also became noted for his comments on the controversy about the Danish Mohammed caricatures.\n\nwww.ralf-koenig.de"
