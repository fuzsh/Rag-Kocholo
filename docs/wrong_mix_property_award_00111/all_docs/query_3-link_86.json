        "text": "He embarked on no adventures, he was in no war. He was never in prison, he never killed anyone. He neither won nor lost a fortune. All he ever did was live in this century. But that alone was enough to give his life dimension, both of feeling and of thought. Here, in his own words, is one of the twentieth century's foremost critics - the dizzyingly inventive, formally unplaceable, unstoppably peripatetic Elias Canetti, who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1981. This collection reintroduces us to an individual who saw the world precisely for what it was, while never losing his sense of wonder or his abiding skepticism about the knowability of the self."
