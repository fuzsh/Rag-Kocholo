Any material, including images and/or video footage, are property of their respective companies, unless stated otherwise. The authors’ claim no ownership of this material. The opinions expressed therein reflect those of the authors and are not to be viewed as factual documentation\n\n(Special Note from Melissa: Apologies for this wildly lengthy delay. I finished my Masters Dissertation recently, which as you can imagine took up a LOT of the summer! It’s lovely to be back writing for pleasure again)\n\nOur first bonus review! Mary Poppins, directed by Robert Stevenson, featuring a screenplay by Bill Walsh and Don DaGradi, and songs and musical score by Richard and Robert Sherman, is often perceived as Walt Disney’s masterpiece – his magnum opus. The film is adapted from P.L. Travers’s series of novels, and Walt Disney was determined to obtain the rights, fighting for more than twenty years as Travers continued to refuse on account of her dislike of animated films and cartoons. Disney’s daughters had loved the books and he had promised them that he would adapt the books one day. When he did finally achieve the rights, the creators and Travers were in a gruelling battle for creative control, so gruelling that it is amazing that the film was made, let alone becoming one of Disney’s greatest films and such a classic in the esteem of many viewers. Strangely enough it may even be why the film is such a beloved masterpiece, because in the conflict there was precise attention to detail in creative discussion, and many of Travers’s suggestions did make it in to the final film (but some thankfully did not!)\n\n(Special Note from Melissa: I was privileged to read and analyse P.L. Travers’s notes and suggestions to Don DaGradi at a film museum at my university. Don DaGradi circled fifty-eight out of one-hundred-and-thirty-four of her suggestions as ones that he agreed with. They are a fascinating and often humorous read. Several favourites of mine include her dislike of the name Cynthia, the original name for Mrs Banks in the script, calling it ‘cold and sexless’)\n\nBy 1964, Disney had produced numerous live-action films, many of which are perceived as classics today, but Mary Poppins certainly broke the mould. There were many, many hard-working people working on this film and that is completely clear in the final result. As we said in our last review, this process was the most excited that Walt had got about a film since The Three Caballeros …\n\nYes … The Three Caballeros. We don’t understand it either.\n\nRather than dividing it up into Protagonist, Antagonist and Supporting Cast, we have put the Cast into one section, because we feel that Mary Poppins does not follow the conventional format of Protagonist and Antagonist.\n\nBut first … Original Trailer Time! We have missed you dearly.\n\nFirst off it appears that they have got rid of the Voiceover Man, but they have NOT got rid of his cumbersome clunky manner of speaking. It is instead written down for you, and it takes FOREVER\n\nThis trailer is … quite a mess. It lacks coherence, showing snippets of scenes in no particular order, as if the editor closed their eyes and randomly pointed at clips\n\nAnd it gives away the ending. How clever of you Original Trailer Editor. But it is not quite as ‘clever’ as the Lady and the Tramp ‘spoiler in the trailer’ gaff\n\nAcclaimed by EVERYONE as Walt Disney’s GREATEST ACHIEVEMENT\n\n(Special Note from Melissa: Including ME! See I can splash out spoilers too Original Trailer Editor!)\n\nCast\n\nJulie Andrews as Mary Poppins is a lady no doubt about it; she is a quintessential elegant woman with a no-nonsense attitude and a twinkle in her eye. In Hollywood we have seen horrible or strict nannies and child-carers, or sugary sweet nannies and child-carers; Andrews plays none of these nannies. We suspect that many viewers’ memories of Mary Poppins are clouded by a false perception that Mary Poppins is a sugary sweet nanny, as she is persistently perceived as in popular culture. We saw no such nanny. Andrews’s Poppins offers a combination of what both Mr Banks and the children asked for in their respective advertisements. She is a ‘general’, and a ‘nanny who can give commands’, and yet she ‘sings songs’, has ‘a cheery disposition’, takes them on outings, and ‘plays games all sorts’. There’s a reason why she’s ‘practically perfect in every way’ rather than ‘perfect in every way’. She may be charming but she is also vain, she may be the disciplinarian that the children need but she can be aloof, she creates such cheeky fun and wonderful magic but she does have her killjoy moments, and of course she is very quick to deny magical happenings or be continuously mysterious, as she of course ‘never explains anything’. While her character has a clear stiff upper lip, Andrews really shows Mary Poppins’ vulnerability, particularly in the film’s final moments, but with such subtlety that it has a greater impact (as opposed to films made in more recent years that would insist on characters like Poppins having an emotional outburst and/or explaining her back-story, likely with a trite flashback).\n\nThis was Andrews’s first film and yet she is such a natural on-screen, manifesting dignity, grace and excellent comic timing. She has fantastic chemistry with both Dick Van Dyke and David Tomlinson, and her rapport with the children is very engaging, never bordering on schmaltz. The film would be very different without her. Bette Davis, Angela Lansbury and Mary Martin were considered for the role, but Andrews completely hits the nail on the head with the character. Andrews was ‘discovered’ for Mary Poppins after several of the creators, including Walt Disney saw her appear in Camelot. They were so enchanted by her that when Walt discovered that she was pregnant, he said that they would wait for her, willing to postpone production until she was ready. But even so, Andrews could have been close to not playing the role, as she had performed in the original stage production of My Fair Lady, and the film adaptation was due to be made around the same time as Mary Poppins. However to Andrews’s dismay, Jack Warner did not consider her enough of a star to lead the picture, meaning that she was available to do Mary Poppins. But when she won an Academy Award for Best Actress for her role in Mary Poppins, she got her ‘revenge’ in her speech by cheekily thanking Jack Warner for making all of this possible in the first place, which he received in good humour. Andrews being turned down for My Fair Lady really is a fine example of the notion that ‘things happen for a reason’ because her role in Mary Poppins is so iconic and her performance is so memorable.\n\nJulie Andrews is a master of the unimpressed clap:\n\nAppearing ticked off:\n\nThe wide-eyed the ‘Whatever are you implying’ face\n\nAnd just being quite blunt:\n\nLet’s get this over with: Dick Van Dyke’s accent is something that just about every film critic (ever) has made fun of, and it is not hard to see why, as it is an accent that sounds nothing like cockney. However, Van Dyke’s performance more than compensates for it, as it is a performance loaded with energy, charm, likeability and warmth; his whole face lights up when he smiles. To be honest, a really accurate, broad cockney accent may have been a touch too aggressive-sounding, and perhaps even counteracted the character’s sweetness. Quite often jack-of-all-trade Bert’s role is to be the fun adult presence in the lives of the children, someone with a love of the ridiculous who is never afraid of looking silly …\n\nBefore they ever was a Jim Carrey or a Rowan Atkinson, Dick Van Dyke was the Lanky King of Rubber-faced Acting\n\n… and yet he has several tender moments that are very movingly delivered. One such moment is his contemplative musings about the view from the rooftops and another is his ‘Winds in the East’ speech. Another impactful scene is when he reminds the children that their father loves them, and that they seem to be forgetting that Mr. Banks works very hard at his job, and of course the most poignant of all is the scene between Bert and Mr. Banks towards the end of the film. None of these moments ever seem forced, or unnatural coming from Bert. He really makes such natural and seamless transitions from clowning into sincerity and back again.\n\n(Special Note from Melissa: Everyone needs a Bert in their life)\n\nWe are glad that they kept the relationship between Mary and Bert platonic (one of Travers’s huge insistences in the writing process), but their chemistry is joyous and we appreciated subtle teasing moments (such as Mary’s smiling yet blunt insistence that Bert would ‘never think of pressing [his] advantage’), their sweet exchanges and the way in which they exhibit familiar ‘couple-like’ tendencies:\n\nMelissa: How many times have I made this face?\n\nDavid: A lot!\n\nDavid Tomlinson does a fantastic job as Mr. Banks, a man whose life is governed by efficiency and precision. He acts as an oppressor of imagination and silliness, and yet he is shown under pressure from his own oppressors at the Bank. Such a character could be rigid and dull, but Tomlinson is always engaging and entertaining, his facial expressions speak volumes and his sharp nuanced delivery of many of his lines (‘splendid, splendid’, ‘when I sit down to an instrument I like to have it in tune’). In many ways he is the unsung hero of the film. Despite being the initial oppressor, the film is his journey, as his world, initially suiting his desire for order and precision, is turned upside down, and he finally discovers that his family’s happiness and consequently his own, is more important. Tomlinson’s off-hand quips, his understated delivery of quality material and his comic moments of glassy eyed vagueness also make for an entertaining performance. An underrated performer, Tomlinson plays this role with humour, wit and emotional gravitas. When Bert reminds him that ‘childhood slips like sand through a sieve’ and that it’ll be too late by the time his children have grown up, and when his children give him the Tuppence, his facial reactions are moving. For us, his long walk to the bank is one of the film’s most powerful moments.\n\nThe children, the ‘rather inclined to giggle’ Jane and ‘extremely stubborn and suspicious’ Michael, played by Karen Dotrice and Matthew Garber, are sweetly performed, which is a relief, as many child actors in family films can be not only acted but written as, irritating, obnoxious or saccharine. Their wide-eyed, open-mouthed reactions and curious responses to the magical events are endearing, seeming like genuine and authentic responses as opposed to acted and rehearsed responses. They were believable performances, and seeing them develop from sad, lonely children desperate for affection, into happy children with imagination in their lives and the love of their parents made for a wonderful ending.\n\nWe recently watched Frank Capra’s (who like Walt was often accused of over-doing the sentiment, with his work being dubbed ‘Capra-corn’) You Can’t Take It With You (1938), and we were instantly reminded of the eccentric performances in Mary Poppins (with fireworks in the basement rather than a canon next door! With the ensemble always ready to stop anything from falling or breaking, etc…). One of the best qualities in many of Capra’s films is his attention to detail when it comes to supporting cast. Mary Poppins, not directed by Capra but Robert Stevenson, offers such detail in the ensemble cast, with delightful quirks and scene-stealing moments. Mrs Banks, played by Glynis Johns, is such a reactive presence, often oblivious to how eccentric her surroundings are and so well-meaning, trying to keep her husband happy, and yet she is a staunch, enthusiastic fighter for Votes for Women.\n\n(Special Note from David: Mrs Banks reminds me of Frank Lapidus from Lost, someone who finds themselves caught up in increasingly bizarre circumstances and just goes along with it)\n\nHer scenes with Mr Banks are exquisitely funny. Absent-minded and sweet, watch her more closely and see her expressions towards Mr Banks, on the surface she appears submissive, scratch it and you often hear irony in her tone and see sharp side-ways glace facial expressions; she plays ‘the game’ quite well.\n\nCharacters actresses, Hermione Baddeley and Reta Shaw are excellent as the bickering domestics, Ellen and Mrs Brill. The bankers are suitably intimidating and stuffy, and yet bizarrely entertaining all at once, particularly Dick Van Dyke as the decrepit Dickensean-like Mr Dawes Sr, the miser who had never been happier in his life until he heard a silly joke, and then died that same night – how tragic!\n\n(Special Note from Melissa: Dick Van Dyke told an excellent anecdote: when he was in costume and make-up for Mr Dawes, he thought it would be hilarious to take his time crossing the road whenever a tour bus passed by, and then when the bus would drive away, he would go into a sprint and race past them)\n\nArthur Treacher and Reginald Owen offer charming performances as straight-laced Constable Jones and eccentric Admiral Boom respectively. Ed Wynn, who voiced the Mad Hatter in Alice in Wonderland, makes a delightful cameo appearance as the Uncle Albert in the ‘I Love to Laugh’ tea party scene, which plays out like Vaudeville / Music Hall shtick, full of amusingly bad jokes and puns and one-liners, which makes you laugh in spite of myself, concluding with two spectacular gurning faces:\n\n(Special Note from David: I’m particularly fond of the final exchange, ‘I always say there’s nothing like a good joke’ / ‘And that was nothing like a good joke’)\n\n(Special Note from Melissa: Agreed! I’m also tickled by the man who works in a watch factory – the one that stands around all day and makes faces)\n\nOn a final note, we took great delight in recognising familiar Disney voices, in particular J. Pat O’Malley who would pop up constantly throughout the animated sequence.\n\nImagery\n\nMary Poppins is such a pretty-looking film. The matte paintings (created primarily by Peter Ellenshaw) that make up many of the backgrounds in the film are glorious to behold.\n\n(Special Note from Melissa: I would gladly hang many of these on my wall!)\n\nThe sodium vapour screen process made the blend of live action and animation possible. There is such an improvement in the blend between live action and animation since the 1940s (yes take that Three Caballeros!) and it is brilliantly done. Only some moments appear dated and/or clunky (we’re not quite at the Who Framed Roger Rabbit level yet), and the background animation scenes are not ‘top quality’ drawings (from Disney at least, we’ve seen what they are capable of) as we are of course in the ‘sketchy’ style phase.\n\nThe practical effects are ingenious, from Mary Poppins’ carpet bag to the smoke staircase to the objects in the nursery to flying or floating scenes; even fifty years later there are many marvellous illusions that continue to astonish us:\n\nHOW???\n\n(Please don’t actually answer this. We secretly like not knowing)\n\nMary Poppins you dark horse! She clearly enjoyed that rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrum punch …\n\nThe costumes and sets are excellent, with such fine attention to detail, showcasing the artistic prowess of the studio. There are colours that ‘pop’, in particular red, in costume pieces such as the red inner lining of Mary Poppins’s coat (which Julie Andrews describes as Mary Poppins’s ‘secret life’), her red scarf, the bowtie she wears, her later red outfit, post boxes, Mr Banks’s red carnation, Mr Dawes Sr’s red shawl and the red room featuring all of the bankers. The costumes really suit each character, and clearly a lot of thought had been put into them, courtesy of costume designer, Tony Walton (Julie Andrews’s husband at the time. He was also the film’s visual consultant).\n\nMusic\n\nThe soundtrack to Mary Poppins is not just one of the most iconic soundtracks of the entire Disney canon, it is one of the most famous soundtracks in cinema history. We couldn’t help feeling that the Sherman Brothers were not at their best on The Sword in the Stone, but that is probably because their efforts were a lot more focussed on Mary Poppins. One of the best elements of the score is that the Sherman Brothers give all of the main characters a musical theme or leit motif, which they regretted they had not done in The Sword in the Stone. As we said in The Sword in the Stone review, it is astounding that two young American songwriters could encapsulate such a delightful English-ness in their songs. Every song throughout the film is memorable, and securely engrained within popular culture. The songs are so distinctive and iconic that it is near impossible to pick a favourite!\n\n(Special Note from David: I didn’t even watch this film as a child, yet I knew the songs – it’s just one of those soundtracks that everyone recognises)\n\nThe Overture does a wonderful job of leading us into this magical world, beginning with gorgeous instrumental renditions of ‘Feed the Birds’, ‘A Spoonful of Sugar’, ‘Chim Chim Cher-ee’ and ‘Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious’, accompanied by the beautiful matte paintings of London.\n\n‘Sister Suffragette’ was written to encourage Glynis Johns to accept the role of Mrs Banks and it is a really entertaining number in which we see Mrs Banks rouse the domestics into joining her in the cause of ‘Votes for Women’ while ineffective nanny, Katie Nanna tries to interrupt throughout. It is a terrific introduction to Mrs Banks’ passion and verve, and a clear indication as to why she is so occupied throughout the film.\n\nPatter song a little reminiscent of My Fair Lady, ‘The Life I Lead’ introduces the character of Mr. Banks, describing how he likes everything to be precise and efficient. It is set to a militant marching rhythm, and is sung with many clipped syllables and yet it is so comically pompous and full of self-importance. The tune is used throughout the movie as Mr. Banks’ theme, and the tune is reprised in several different forms: ‘A British Bank’ and ‘A Man Has Dreams’; the former is a hilarious exchange between Mr Banks and Mary Poppins, in which she essentially uses his theme song against him as a form of reverse psychology, while the latter is a striking melancholic musing from Mr Banks when he realises that he is about to lose his job. It gracefully transitions into ‘A Spoonful of Sugar’, sung by Bert as a spokesperson for Mary Poppins as he uses her theme to get the message to Mr Banks rather than his own theme, ‘Chim Chim Cher-ee’.\n\n‘The Perfect Nanny’ is a narrative driven motif as the children present an advertisement for finding the ‘Perfect Nanny’. Jane’s sweet little nervous voice strikes a genuine note. It frequently cuts back to Mr Banks rolling his eyes and trying to interrupt, twitching impatiently for it to be over, which even if you’re enjoying the sentimentality of the number, you can’t help but by tickled by his irritation.\n\nMichael has the easiest job with the odd comic quip and having to nod in time with Jane and the final musical note.\n\n(Special Note from David: And yet he couldn’t even do that right! Call that a nod Michael?)\n\n‘A Spoonful of Sugar’ is a reminder that adding a touch of ‘sweetness’ or ‘sugar’ as it is metaphorically stated, to mundane tasks, is worthwhile, which Poppins sings as they magically tidy up the nursery. It also insinuates that adding a ‘Spoonful of Sugar’ to life itself, can make life much more enjoyable. The musical themes of both the parents and Mary Poppins all have a militaristic sound – brass-heavy with militant marching rhythms and pace.\n\n‘Jolly Holiday’ is a jolly ditty about how bloody marvellous everyone thinks Mary Poppins is. It is a charming number, and it features an amusingly suggestive moment when Mary Poppins pointedly reminds Bert of their platonic relationship, and Bert appears somewhat ruffled.\n\nMore than any other Sherman Brothers song, ‘Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious’ perfectly encapsulates the pair’s penchant for made-up words. There was an excellent visual joke about this in Saving Mr. Banks wherein Robert Sherman hid the sheet music from P.L. Travers after she insisted that they “Un-make up” the word “Responstible”. The song is pure silliness of the highest degree, and is a real delight, accompanied by an animated pearly band.\n\n‘Stay Awake’ is a simple-yet-effective lullaby, making use of reverse-psychology to deal with stubborn children who insist that they are not tired. Allegedly it was one of Julie Andrews’s favourite songs from the film, and when she heard that it may be cut, she wrote a letter to P.L. Travers who insisted that it remain in the final film. It took her nearly 50 takes to get it just right in terms of softness in the vocal quality. It is an enchantingly beautiful and hypnotic lullaby – we are grateful it was not cut.\n\n‘I Love To Laugh’ is more of a character showcase than a song for Ed Wynn’s Uncle Albert – as a song it is infectious, like the characters laughing their heads off, you cannot help but giggle during the song because of how giddy they are, coupled with the unimpressed looks from Mary Poppins. Laughter demonstrations, what’s unattractive in a laugh , chant-like, pub-like, not beyond belief to imagine it being sung at a pub or a football match with each short line (trying bellowing it like you’re at a football match, it’s fun!)\n\n‘Feed The Birds’, as most fans know, was Walt Disney’s favourite song and there is a lovely story in which Walt would frequently call up the Sherman Brothers to play the song for him. It is a song about charity – a haunting, beautiful song that really highlights the talent of the Sherman Brothers when it comes to emotionally impacting the listener.\n\nThe rather Gilbert-and-Sullivan-esque ‘Fidelity Fiduciary Bank’ is hilarious and much underrated; it is likely the closest that the film gets to having a villain song. The sesquipedalian language, the slow pace and militaristic rhythms all succeed in highlighting the repressed environment of the Bank. The sight of these elderly gentlemen trying so hard to obtain a Tuppence from a child is bizarre in every possible way. Plus look at them trying to show how ‘fun’ they are when Mr Dawes Sr starts ‘dancing’ as the Bankers pretend to be … well bankers doing banking-like things. We think it calls for another ‘It’s Fun’ moment:\n\nBanking’s fun. Look at the fun we’re having.\n\n‘Chim Chim Cher-ee’ is the song that won ‘Best Song’ at the Academy Awards, beating ‘A Spoonful of Sugar’ and ‘Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious’. It encapsulates Bert’s character perfectly, as it is easy-going and playful, akin to ‘Jolly Holiday’ and ‘I Love to Laugh’. As his leit-motif, it is such a far cry from the militaristic themes of Poppins and the parents, and rather it is a charming cheerful waltz.\n\n‘Step In Time’, inspired by pub classic, ‘Knees Up Mother Brown’, is an exciting, energetic number in which we see chimney sweeps doing excellent stunts and dance moves on the rooftops of London, culminating in a chaotic sequence inside the Banks’s home. It perfectly encapsulates joyful anarchy at its best.\n\n(Special Note from Melissa and David: We are both in disagreement over the length of Step in Time.\n\nDavid: While I enjoy ‘Step in Time’, especially the madcap moments inside the Banks’s home, I did become aware of how long the sequence is …\n\nMelissa: I’m a big fan of lengthy dance sequences in musical films (Gene Kelly films are full of them!), whereas David after a while normally quips in asking how long the sequence is and when will it ever end. I love how long ‘Step in Time’ is; those dancers are mesmerising to watch, and I adore the build up into the delightful chaos in the house! And the way in which the sequence progressively transitions at the end to such an evocatively quiet finish …\n\nDavid: But I can appreciate the energy and the effort that goes into the choreography)\n\n‘Let’s Go Fly A Kite’ is such a special number. No longer the rigid militaristic rhythms of ‘The Life I Lead’, Mr Banks is now singing a delightful waltz in ¾ time. It is near impossible not to smile when listening to this song – it really encapsulates freedom, play, liberty, family togetherness and absolute joy. Just wonderful.\n\nThank you, you marvellous musical scamps!\n\nStory\n\nThe story in Mary Poppins is deserving of praise on several levels; first of all it manages to link together all of the episodic scenes into a cohesive and well-structured whole (something that The Sword in the Stone failed to do) where every sequence has a purpose, even though it is not always clear on a first viewing. When you consider the ‘tea party on the ceiling’ scene, which initially you consider could have been ‘lifted out’ (despite being an entertaining scene), as it can at first seem to be a vehicle episode for Ed Wynn who never appears again. However, you realise in the finale that this scene is much more integral to the plot than it seems – the idea of laughter, and in this case laughing at nonsense, which partly leads to Mr Banks’s hysteria at the bank, and Mr Dawes Sr’s own laughter at a ‘Wooden leg named Smith’ joke (‘never seen him happier in his life’) and consequently Mr Banks being reinstated. It is a similar situation with ‘Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious’. Essentially they are not episodes for the sake of episodes – they are purposeful and simultaneously entertaining.\n\nAlthough long, the film is excellently paced, and the story is able to deliver clear character arcs for the majority of the cast, and not only the chief characters. Perhaps most importantly the film is able to deliver its moments of emotional impact really effectively. The film has a respect for its audience and its characters, it does not shy away from difficult or challenging themes, and it has a definitive gravitas that many other films lack. The cinematic trope of ‘distracted parent discovering the error of their ways’ has been used in countless films, but Mary Poppins delivers one of the best examples. Can you imagine an alternative 1990s version of the same story? The distracted or workaholic or absent Dad who learns the error of his way was ALL over the place in the 1990s (and likely in the 2000s as well), with the Casper’s Spirited Beginning, the Santa Clause, Hook, Jack Frost, Jingle All the Way, Liar Liar, etc … Now we admit we do like a few of these films (We imagine it is obvious which are the blah ones!), but Mary Poppins handles the distracted father trope with much more dignity, grace, emotion and humour than many contemporary family films. Perhaps the main reason for this is the fact that Mr. Banks is not an antagonist, and the film never tries to make him into one. We never dislike Mr. Banks, and consequently we are delighted to see him happy at the end. To a certain extent, the film is his journey. He is a father and husband who blissfully believes that life is satisfactory until the east wind brings in the force that is Mary Poppins. He is convinced that the ‘nonsense’ she has brought into the house is ruining his satisfactory situation, until finally discovering that that’s all his life was – satisfactory and consistent, but not wonderful. By the film’s end, that wonder is discovered and embraced, and Mr Banks is set free, liberated from his previous way of thinking, and of course the ‘cage’ that was the oppressive environment of the bank. That’s why ‘Let’s Go Fly a Kite’ is a perfect ending – the entire family has been liberated from their own chains. It is fascinating how at the end, the children are devastated that Mary Poppins is leaving, and they even ask half-way through the film, ‘Whatever would we do without you?’ and ‘You won’t ever leave us?’ truly as if they cannot imagine life without her, and we are constantly reminded by other characters how marvellous she is (‘Jolly Holiday’ being the biggest culprit). At times, Mary, Bert, Jane and Michael look like a conventional family, as Mary and Bert are acting like ‘surrogate’ parents to an extent :\n\nAnd yet at the end, when Mr Banks has mended the kite, Mrs Banks uses her ‘Votes for Women’ sash to give the kite a tail and they all skip together to the park, the glorious Mary Poppins is suddenly forgotten, and the family has been restored, with a wonderful ending for the family, but a somewhat bittersweet ending for Mary who, despite being adored by many, cannot truly form long-term relationships with anybody, as she is forever called away by the West Wind when her work is done.\n\nOverall, it is a simple story, but with detailed characters that we can get behind, and a sharp, witty script that is not afraid to explore sentimentality and cynicism. Bravo Disney!\n\nDavid’s Verdict\n\nI’ve already mentioned that I never saw this film during my childhood, and I can’t know for sure what I would have thought of it back then. I didn’t always have the best attention span, so maybe it’s for the best that I didn’t see this film until I could appreciate it properly. I really enjoyed the film the first time that I watched it, then this time around I enjoyed it even more.\n\nI felt that some of the lengthier sequences went on a bit too long during my first viewing (such as the ‘Jolly Holiday’ sequence and also ‘Step In Time’) but upon re-viewing the film it is hard to find much fault with them. The blending of live action and animation has noticeably improved since the 1940s, and the sheer amount of effort and energy on display during these sequences is hard not to appreciate. Speaking about the film in general, some of the practical effects in the film look a bit jerky and out-dated, but I prefer them to the excessive amounts of CGI that would be used now. I also appreciate the fact that the studio chose to add all of these extra details in, no shortcuts are taken – some of the wizardry with props and set pieces is still very impressive, such as Mary’s handbag, and the medicine bottle.\n\nThe performances are really strong throughout, particularly from Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke, but I think that it’s David Tomlinson’s performance that really elevates the film. I really enjoy his precise entrance into the film during “The Life I Lead”, his increasing befuddlement during his scenes with Mary Poppins, and the emotion he expresses throughout the final sequences, from the devastation to the exuberant joy.\n\nThis feature showcased the studio at their best. The characters are all memorable and skilfully portrayed; the soundtrack is one of the most iconic in the history of cinema; the story is able to blend moments of silliness with moments of poignancy, and the film’s ending is a genuine feel-good moment.\n\nI could say more, but there’s not really much I could say that would add anything. Basically, it’s a really good film, where the amount of effort that went into its creation is evident, it’s funny when it wants to be, and touching where it needs to be. It’s just a shame that Walt didn’t live longer, as it would be interesting to see an attempt to out-do this one.\n\nMelissa’s Verdict\n\nI love this film, I love, love, LOVE it! I’m not even going to hide it or try to sound ‘wittily’ objective. Mary Poppins is not only my favourite Disney film ever; it is one of my favourite films, highly likely in my Top Five. It is one of the earliest films that I remember watching from a young age and it immediately brings me back to my childhood, satisfying any nostalgic craving that I have. But it is not only a childhood remembrance; as I grew up, I began to recognise more and more how engaging and extraordinary it is as a piece of cinema. I even wrote my English undergraduate dissertation several years ago on ‘Imagination and Repression in Children’s Fantasy Cinema’, and Mary Poppins alongside A Little Princess were my primary case studies. When you have seen a film so many times, and especially when it is one that you focused on in academia (which can also potentially kill your love for a film), you would assume that you would be more critical or find more fault. That is simply not the case here. The more I watch, the better it gets somehow! One of the many reasons why this review was difficult to write is because for me, words don’t really encapsulate how I truly feel about this film; all I can say is that is such a wonderful piece of cinema that I can switch on to remind myself of the joys of life, love and fantasy. It has one of the finest ensemble casts in cinematic history, it looks visually gorgeous, it has a sharp script, the story is simple but engaging, the illusions are impressive and the music is absolutely unforgettable. Not only do the songs have wonderful melodies, the lyrics are witty and the songs have the ability to make me smile and/or make me tear up. Julie Andrews is without a doubt a childhood icon, and performers like David Tomlinson and Dick Van Dyke have likewise had such a delightful impact (with many quotable lines from George Banks!).\n\nYes, it is a long film, and it is easy to see how some people may find it too long, but for me, it is not an issue at all, because, especially in the case of lengthy sequences, there is so much to look at and be entertained by. This film is a labour of love; I can see the work that went into creating the film, from the tiniest details to the grand set pieces, and it is a joy to behold. Walt Disney himself stated, ‘I do not make films primarily for children. I make them for the child in all of us, whether we be six or sixty. Call the child innocence. The worst of us is not without innocence’. Mary Poppins is a stunning achievement and in my opinion it is certainly Walt’s Magnum Opus, taking everything he has learned from his years in the business and combining them into a feast for the eyes and ears. Watching Mary Poppins is like having a wonderful afternoon tea; it is so beautiful and elegant to look at, yet so fun, fulfilling and lovely to indulge in.\n\nMary Poppins if it were a spread of food!\n\nLegacy\n\nMary Poppins was the first premiere that Walt Disney had attended since the Golden Age, and it was a major Hollywood event, featuring countless film stars and actors dressed as Disney’s famed characters. It received universal acclaim by film critics, with old faithful of the New York Times Bosley Crowther called the film ‘irresistible’:\n\n‘In case you are a Mary Poppins zealot who dotes on her just as she is, don’t let the intrusion of Mr. Disney and his myrmidons worry you one bit. Be thankful for it and praise heaven there are such as they still making films. For the visual and aural felicities they have added to this sparkling color film—the enchantments of a beautiful production, some deliciously animated sequences, some exciting and nimble dancing, and a spinning musical score—make it the nicest entertainment that has opened at the Music Hall this year’\n\nIt was the most profitable film of 1965, and the profits would finance the construction of Walt Disney World in Florida, but Walt Disney would not live to see it fully built. It is the only film produced by Walt Disney himself to be nominated for ‘Best Picture’ at the Academy Awards. It was nominated for thirteen Academy Awards, and won five, including ‘Best Actress’, ‘Best Film Editing’, ‘Best Original Music Score’, ‘Best Visual Effects’, and ‘Best Original Song’ for ‘Chim Chim Cher-ee’. Bill Walsh and Don DaGradi won ‘Best Written American Musical’ at the Writer’s Guild of America, Julie Andrews won ‘Most Promising Newcomer’ at the BAFTAs, Best Actress at the Golden Globes and the Utah Film Critics Association Awards, the Sherman Brothers won two Grammys, and the film won several Laurel Awards, including Best Supporting Performance for Glynis Johns, General Performance for the film itself, Best Female Musical Performance for Julie Andrews, and Best Song for ‘Chim Chim Cher-ee’. It is currently No. 6 on the American Film Institute’s ‘100 Years of Musicals’ list, and ‘Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious’ is No. 36 on their ‘100 Songs’ List. The film has been spoofed and referenced to many times:\n\nMary Poppins was adapted into a musical in the UK in late 2004 by Cameron Mackintosh, which ran until early 2008 in the West End. Downton Abbey creator, Julian Fellowes wrote the musical’s book, and George Stiles and Anthony Drewe wrote extra songs and additional lyrics and music, primarily because P.L. Travers would not allow the Sherman Brothers to have any involvement. That leads to Saving Mr Banks, directed by John Lee Hancock, released in 2013, which is centred on the creative conflict between P.L. Travers and Walt Disney during the development of Mary Poppins.\n\nInterestingly enough, at the premiere, two very insightful comments were made by both Dick Van Dyke and Walt Disney. Van Dyke said, ‘It’s my third motion picture, but it’s the best one I’ve ever been in and that I ever will be if I live to be 150 years old. To me this is the greatest family classic of all time. I’m so proud to be in this picture’. In a way, how true that turned out to be! On the other hand, an interviewer asked Walt, ‘This could be one of your biggest pictures Mr Disney?’ and Walt responded, ‘Well … we haven’t retired yet!’ Always wanting to push the envelope! It is such a shame that Walt would pass away only two years later, and that we never got a chance to see how he could have topped Mary Poppins. We’re soon moving into a very new era for Disney …\n\nThank you so much for reading! We hope that you enjoyed it – comment below and let us know what you think"
