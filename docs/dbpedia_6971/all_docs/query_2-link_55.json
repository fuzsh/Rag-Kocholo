        "text": "An actor who grew up in Coquitlam and now calls Ontario home is cast as the Dick Van Dyke character of Bert in an upcoming stage production of Mary Poppins.\n\nDarren Burkett portrays the famous English character for the 32nd season of the Royal City Musical Theatre (RCMT), which opens its Broadway musical tonight, April 27, at the Massey Theatre (735 8th Ave., New Westminster).\n\nTickets are now on sale for the run until May 12.\n\nDirected and choreographed by former Port Coquitlam resident Valerie Easton — RCMT’s artistic director — with musical direction by Peter Abando, Mary Poppins stars Vancouver actor Meghan Gardiner in the titular role made famous by Julie Andrews in the 1964 musical/fantasy flick.\n\n“The version you will see on stage is much closer to the original spirit of the P.L. Travers books than the famous Disney film, but still emphasizes the value and strength of family,” Easton said in a news release.\n\nThe show also includes such singalong hits as \"A Spoonful of Sugar,\" \"Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious\" and \"Chim Chim Cher-ee.”\n\nTickets start at $27 to see Mary Poppins at Massey Theatre in New Westminster. Call the RCMT box office at 604-521-5050 or visit online.\n\nCast and crew\n\nSimon Abraham - Robertson Ay/Teddy/Ensemble\n\nAlice Battista - Katie Nanna/Ensemble\n\n*Darren Burkett - Bert\n\nRiley Calderwood - Michael\n\nKatie-Rose Connors - Miss Andrew, Londoner\n\nDanica Domay - Fannie/Ensemble\n\nCharlie Emma Lynn - Jane\n\nColton Fyfe - Policeman/Von Hussler/Ensemble\n\n*Meghan Gardiner - Mary Poppins\n\n*Janet Gigliotti - Winifred Banks\n\nMegan Greenwood - Miss Smythe/Ensemble\n\nAddyson Handregan - Jane\n\nJulianna Kato - Bird Woman/Londoner\n\nSarah Lane - Mrs. Brill\n\nDavid Longas Orozco – Ensemble\n\nAva Maddison - Ensemble\n\nNoah McKimm - Neleus/Dance Captain/Ensemble\n\nSarah McKinnon- Miss Lark\n\nJenny Nguyen - Ensemble\n\nRoan Osenton-Boutin - Michael\n\nElliette Rae - Annie/Londoner\n\nJesse Redmond - Admiral Boom/Chairman\n\nBlake Sartin - Ensemble\n\nThomas Schultes - Ensemble\n\nDane Smit - Park Keeper/Ensemble\n\n*Kirk Smith - George Banks\n\nJennifer Suratos - Mrs. Corry/Londoner\n\nMadison Stocker - Doll/Ensemble\n\nSpencer Swift - Valentine/Ensemble\n\nChantelle Ward - Dance Captain / Ensemble\n\nCreative Team\n\nDirector & Choreographer - Valerie Easton*\n\nMusical Director - Peter Abando\n\nStage Manager - Inga McLaughlin*\n\nSet Designer - Brian Ball\n\nProps Designer - Stephanie Barclay\n\nCostume Designer / Coordinator - Alex Campagnaro\n\nSound Designer - Cormac Dowdall\n\nLighting Designer - Darren W.
