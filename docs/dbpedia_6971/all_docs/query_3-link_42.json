(As it's a fan wiki, I doubt it's subject to quite the stringent fact-checking that Wikipedia and IMDB are). They've also got the date wrong, it's 2012 not 2016.\n\nfrom comments it would seem that \"fanon\" means it's some kind of made up wish-list, who-cares-whether-it's-true non-canon structureâ€¦ Avoid.\n\nBoth Wikipedia & IMDB consider it it entirely Universal - Illumination is a part of Universal.\n\nIMDB mentions Disney as a distributor in 2019/20 but in no other capacity.\n\nFrom WIkipedia -\n\nThe Lorax (also known as Dr. Seuss' The Lorax) is a 2012 American 3D computer-animated musical fantasy comedy film produced by Illumination Entertainment and based on Dr. Seuss' children's book of the same name. The film was released by Universal Pictures on March 2, 2012, on what would have been Seuss's 108th birthday."
