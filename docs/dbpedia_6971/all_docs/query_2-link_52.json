        "text": "Starring: Dame Julie Andrews, Dick Van Dyke, David Tomlinson, Glynis Johns, Hermione Baddeley, Elsa Lanchester, Arthur Treacher, Reginald Owen, Ed Wynn, Karen Dotrice and Matthew Garber\n\nDirector: Robert Stevenson\n\nDuration Running Time: 2 Hours 19 Minutes (139 Mins)\n\nCertification Rating Certificate: - 'U' - (Original Certification - 1964) - 'PG'- (2024) - PLEASE NOTE - THIS HAS BEEN RECLASSIFIED ONLY SHOWN IN MOVIE THEATERS BECAUSE OF DISCRIMINATORY LANGUAGE INVOLVING RACIAL SLURS - HOWEVER HOME ENTERTAINMENT VERSIONS SHOWN AND DISPLAYED IN YOUR ESTABLISHMENTS ARE UNAFFECTED\n\nDistribution : Walt Disney Pictures, Walt Disney Productions, Buena Vista Distribution Company, Inc.\n\nPamela Lyndon Travers, O.B.E. (Order Of The British Empire), aka Helen Lyndon Goff - her 'real name' (August 9, 1899, - April 23, 1996), was an Australian-British writer who had spent most of her career in England, however she is best known for the 'MARY POPPINS' series of books, consisting of eight stories and featuring the eponymous nanny.\n\nJust for the record, these books were in fact published over the period from 1934-1988 - fifty-four years to be exact, and also that Mary Shepard was in fact 'the original illustrator' throughout the series, and that Shepard in question was the daughter of the original illustrator of 'WINNIE -THE-POOH' - despite their difficult relationship between the illustrator and the author - in question.\n\nGoff was born in Maryborough, Queensland, and grew up in the Australian bush before being sent to boarding school in Sydney.\n\nFor the record, 'THE BUSH' in question, is simply a term that's mostly used in the English vernacular of Australia and also New Zealand to where it is largely synonymous with 'hinterland' and even 'backwoods' respectively that's often referring to a natural undeveloped area.\n\nThe 'fauna' and also 'flora' that's originally contained within this area may be mostly indigenous to the region, although many exotic species will in fact be often and also be present.\n\nNow, the Australian and also the New Zealand usage of the word ''bush'' for ''forest'' or even scrubland, will probably come from the Dutch word - ''bos/bosch'' (forest) used by Dutch settlers in South Africa, and where it originally came to signify uncultivated country among Afrikaners.\n\nHowever, many English-speaking early European settlers to South Africa who later migrated to Australia or even New Zealand and also brought the term with them, but today, in South Africa, ''Fynbos'', tends to refer to the health vegetation of the Western Cape and also the Eastern Cape.\n\nAlso that the term of this is also widely used in Canada, basically to refer to the large forested portion of the country in question - but also that the same usage also applies in the US state of Alaska.\n\nHer mother, Margaret Agnes Morehead, was the sister of the premier of Queensland, while her father, Travers Goff, was an unsuccessful bank manager and also a heavy drinker who sadly passed away when she was seven years of age.\n\nAfter her father's 'passing' the family moved to New South Wales, and where they were supported by Ellie, a great aunt (this became the inspiration for her book 'GREAT SASS') and that she lived there for at least ten years although boarded at Normanhurst Girls School during the First World War.\n\nNow, Travers, in question, had led a rich fantasy life and also loved fairy tales and animals, often calling herself as a hen, but that her precocious reading had led her to undertake 'THE DECLINE AND FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE'.\n\nAnd so that it was that when she was a teenager that her original works as a writer was first published - this also included writing many poems and also stories - but also after a brief stint in the theatre, as a Shakespearian actress, and also a dancer that she emigrated to London, England in 1933, at the age of twenty-four years, much to the disapproval of her wealthy relatives, who, however, did not approve; feeling that many Australians lacked humour and also lyricism, and it is also where she took the name of Pamela Lyndon Travers, and had adopted the 'pen name' of P.L.Travers whilst writing the first of the series of eight books, and that she also began 'hobnobbing' with the cream of the society of literary including William Butler Yeats, an Irish poet, and also which she became friends with, through George William Russell, editor of 'THE IRISH STATESMAN' but also that having begun her unique career in journalism in her original homeland of Australia, it was that Travers was able to parlay her 'epic voyage' into travel stories for homeland papers.\n\nBut when Travers arrived in England, she began publishing articles in various papers, including many poems that she had submitted to 'THE IRISH STATESMAN', but also that Russell, 'the editor' and also pseudonymously known as 'AE', had become a lifelong supporter of Travers.\n\nTravers also had a love of Irish mythology, perhaps stemming from her many stories when she was a child, and so the friendship between Russell and Travers had a special significance between them, but also that Travers had explored her further mythological interests by studying with G.I. Gurdjieff, a mystic.\n\nJust before Travers wrote the series of 'MARY POPPINS' books, her first published novel was 'MOSCOW EXCURSION' (1934), which in fact had utilized her 'travel writing experience', but also that the book, in question, that would 'make her famous' followed close on its heel.\n\nHowever, while Travers was recovering from a lung ailment in the country, the original story of 'MARY POPPINS' that she wrote about Michael and Jane Banks, (Garber and Dotrice - who, by the way, is in fact the younger sister of Michelle - who starred as Betty Spencer, the long-suffering wife of Frank Spencer (Michael Crawford) in 'SOME MOTHER'S DO 'AVE 'EM' - a 'sitcom' shown on BBC TV from 1973-1978 - lasting 'five years' - and also returned for a special in 2016 - plus Crawford 'did in fact -do his own stunts'), these were two visiting children with tales of a magical nanny (Andrews), complete with a parrot-head umbrella as a form of transportation and also the ability to have tea parties situated on the ceiling.\n\nThe end product was that the book that she originally wrote became an instant success in 1934, this was thirty years before the movie came out in 1964, but in 1942, 'twenty-three years earlier', during the Second World War, that Travers had originally worked for the UK's 'Ministry Of Information', and that also towards the end of the Second World War, is that she lived on a Navajo reservation situated in Arizona, and also acquiring - 'an Indian name' - that she had always 'kept secret'.\n\nHowever, despite the unique success of the 'MARY POPPINS' books, Travers had continued to write other sources of different material such as 'young adult novels', 'a play', 'essays' and also lectures on mythology and symbols - this was partly because that she had feared not being taken seriously as a writer and that she had also served as a 'writer-in residence' at colleges such as Radcliffe and Smith, although she was not popular.\n\nTravers in question was also notoriously 'private' and 'prickly' as she was never married but she did have a secret - 'involving' Madge Burnand - her 'long-time' room-mate - and who many had speculated - was 'a romantic partner'.\n\nIn 1939, five years after she wrote and published the first novel of the eight-part 'MARY POPPINS' series of books in 1934, Travers, in question, had in fact 'adopted' a son called Camillus, who in fact was one of twin Irish boys - it later turns out that Camillus, in question, had ran into his twin in a pub - of all places - this in fact, was - 'a complete shock' - as he knew nothing of his real background.\n\nWhen the film premiered in the US - first on August 27, 1964, in Los Angeles, and then on September 24, 1964, in New York City, - the film came out in the UK on December 23, 1964, one day before Christmas Eve and also the beginning of the festive season - and four months after its release in the US.\n\nHowever, in 2004, when the 40th Anniversary Edition of the DVD version came out in the UK the story goes like this - that the daughters of Walt Disney fell in love with the books of the many adventures of 'MARY POPPINS' in question - and also made Disney a promise to make a movie - based on them - now in 1938, four years after the first book was published Disney had first approached Travers for the original rights to make the movie - but Travers in question had repeatedly refused; as she did not believe that a film version based on her novels would do justice.\n\nHowever, Disney, in question, was also then known primarily as a 'producer' of animated films, and also had yet to produce a 'major live-action' work of a movie, but also that Disney in question had worked tirelessly for more than twenty years, that he made periodic efforts to make and also convince Travers in question to release the original rights of the novel into a movie, and also made to visit Travers at her original home situated in Chelsea, London.\n\nBut then in 1961, three years before the film came out in 1964, Disney had succeeded in his unique dream to make the film - but also that Travers in question - had her own terms and conditions in making sure that her original novel she created becomes a blockbuster - that she had demanded - and also obtained 'script-approval' rights to the film in question - plus that The Sherman Brothers had composed the original music score and were also involved in the film's development, by suggesting that the setting be changed from the 1930's to the Edwardian era, also the pre-production and also the music creation took about two years to complete.\n\nTravers was also an advisor to the production and was even billed as 'the film's Consultant, but also that she had disapproved of the harsher aspects of the original character involving Mary Poppins in question, had also felt ambivalent about the music score, and also hated about the use of animation so much that she had originally 'ruled out' any further adaptations of the later Mary Poppins original novels of the eight-part series, but that also rather than the original songs, is that she wanted the original soundtrack to the forthcoming film to feature the known standards relating to the Edwardian era - and also in which that the original story is set, but also that due to contract stipulations citing that he had in fact had the Final Cut privilege on the finished product that Disney in question had in fact overruled her.\n\nNow much of the correspondence between Travers-Disney is part of the Travers collection of original papers that is originally situated in the State Library of New South Wales, Australia, and that the relationship between Travers and Disney in question is in fact detailed in 'MARY POPPINS SHE WROTE', for this is in fact a biography about Travers by Valerie Lawson, and that the biography in question - is the basis - for at least - 'TWO DOCUMENTARIES' - on 'TRAVERS' : THE REAL MARY POPPINS' and also Lisa Matthews' - 'THE SHADOW OF MARY POPPINS' - plus their unique relationship during the development of the film in question was also dramatized in 'SAVING MR. BANKS' (2013), - this was classed as a biographical drama and produced by Walt Disney Pictures,and BBC Films, and also directed by John Lee Hancock, plus a powerful music score by Thomas Montgomery Newman, the son of Alfred, and also the cousin of Randy - of which both are film composers - in their own right - and also featuring Dame Emma Thompson (father of Eric - who narrated 'THE MAGIC ROUNDABOUT' -a children's tv series in which he voiced all the characters such as Dougal, Zebeddie, Brian, Ermintrude and Dylan - this ran from 1965-1977 lasting twelve years - and is based on 'Le Manege Enchante' by Serge Danot) as Travers with Tom Hanks as Walt Disney plus Jason Schwartzman and B.J. Novak as the Sherman Brothers and also featuring Bradley Whitford and Paul Giamatti in supporting roles, but that if you are interested in how the film in question came into fruition - then I would highly recommend it - for this is worth watching - and the film is fabulous to watch at your establishments.\n\nHowever, a sequel to the original had been gestating in development since 1964, but Disney had attempted to produce a sequel in 1965, 'one year later' but was rejected by Travers, who also dismissed Disney's original adaptation.\n\nThen in the late 1980's, Jeffrey Katzenberg, the chairman of Walt Disney Productions, and Martin Kaplan, the Vice-President of live-action production approached Travers with the idea of a 'sequel' - and which is set after the original - with the original Banks Children, now as adults and also Andrews 'reprising her original role' as an older version of Mary Poppins, but also that Travers had again rejected the concept for the return of Andrews in question - however, that original idea did not come to fruition, because Travers would not go ahead because the company would not concede, including barring Poppins' original clothing from being red.\n\nTravers' attempt to get a 'sequel' from the first film with her involvement was not deterred, but in the 1980's she and Brian Sibley, an English writer and also a good friend whom she first met in the 1970's had wrote a screenplay for a sequel entitled as 'MARY POPPINS COMES BACK' based on the parts from Travers' second 'MARY POPPINS' book unused in the 1964 original, but Sibley, in question had wrote to Roy E. Disney about making the film, and also to which Disney had contracted them to write to supply a film treatment.\n\nNow, according to Sibley, Travers wrote notes on his script ideas and though she had rejected some of them, she had in fact also liked some of them, including replacing Bert with his brother, an ice-cream man in a park situated in Edwardian London who had similary served as Mary's friend and also a potential admirer.\n\nThen four months later, however, casting issues had emerged as Andrews in question had in fact temporarily retired from making films and therefore was not at all even interested into reprising her original role as 'MARY POPPINS', but it was also tricky to find an actor to play Bert's brother, though an executive had suggested that singer Michael Jackson was right for the part, however the 'planned' sequel to the original was eventually cancelled because of a combination of issues: the casting problems and also the fact that new executives had in fact taken over the company.\n\nIncidentally, in 1978, Jackson, in question made his 'feature film debut' in 'THE WIZ' as the 'scarecrow' - the film was directed by Sidney Lumet and is described as an American musical fantasy adventure - it is also adapted from the 1974 Broadway musical of the same name - and that the film in question - reimagines the classic children's novel 'THE WONDERFUL WIZARD OF OZ' by Lyman Frank Baum - albeit with an 'African-American' all-star cast including Diana Ross, Jackson, Nipsey Russell, Ted Ross, Mabel King, Theresa Merritt, Thelma Carpenter, Lena Horne and also Richard Pryor.\n\nThis story features Dorothy, (Diana Ross), who's a twenty-four year old teacher from Harlem, New York, who finds herself magically transported to the urban fantasy land of Oz, on her travels seeking help from the mysterious Wiz, 'aka' Oscar Zoroaster Phadrig Isaac Norman Henkel Emmanuel Ambroise Diggs (Pryor), Dorothy, in question, befriends a scarecrow, (Jackson), a Tin Man, 'aka' Nick Chopper - 'The Woodman', and also a cowardly lion (Ted Ross).\n\nNow the film, produced by Universal Pictures and also Motown Productions during October -December 1977, - lasting about two to three months - when filming took place in Queens, a borough of New York City, also the story in question was 'reworked' from William F. Brown's Broadway 'libretto' by Joel Schumacher, and Quincy Jones also supervised the adaptation of songs by Charlie Smalls, an American composer and songwriter, and also Luther Ronzoni Vandross Jr, an American soul, R&B singer, songwriter and record producer, - but also that a handful of 'new' songs written by Jones and also the songwriting team of Nikolas Ashford and Valerie Simpson, were also added to the project.\n\nOn October 24, 1978, the film was theatrically released to a critical and also a commercially failure at the box office, it generally received negative reviews from many film critics, with many comparing the film to its source material, and also many critics had criticised the original casting of Diana Ross as Dorothy, but that despite its initial failure - the film in question - had become a cult classic amongst audiences, Ross's 'fanbase', Jackson's 'fanbase', and also Oz enthusiasts.\n\nThen in 2018, 'MARY POPPINS RETURNS' - a sequel to the 1964 original directed by Rob Marshall was released in movie theaters, the film featured Emily Blunt in the title role as Mary Poppins, with Lin-Manuel Miranda, as Jack, a Cockney lamplighter and also Bert's apprentice, Ben Wishaw (Q -in the James Bond Movies - the 'Daniel Craig' -era), as Michael, brother of Jane, who's now a widower, with three children, John,(Nathaniel Salah), Annabel,(Pixie Davies) and also Georgie,(Joel Dawson), and works as a bank teller in the actual bank, Emily Mortimer (daughter of John Mortimer, creator of 'RUMPOLE OF THE BAILEY' - featuring Leo McKern as Horace Rumpole), as Jane, who now works as a union organiser (also Dotrice who appeared as Jane in the 1964 original appears in a cameo appearance as an elegant woman who asks Jane for directions) Dame Julie Walters, as Ellen, the housekeeper to Jane and Michael,( the original part of the housekeeper in question was portrayed by Baddeley in the original), Dame Angela Lansbury ( star of 'MURDER SHE WROTE' as Jessica Fletcher - plus in 1971, she starred in Disney's 'BEDKNOBS AND BROOMSTICKS' alongside David Tomlinson star of 'MARY POPPINS' and also Sir Bruce Forsyth ) as the balloon lady,( plus just for the record, the original part of the balloon lady was a cameo for Andrews in question - but she turned it down as she felt that her presence in this would in fact take the immediate attention away from Blunt), Colin Firth, as William 'Weatherall' Wilkins - the corrupt new chairman of Fidelity Fiduciary Bank, David Warner as Admiral Bloom, a naval officer ( this was his final film appearance - he sadly passed away in 2022 - from a cancer-related illness) with Oscar -Winning actress Meryl Streep as Topsy, Mary Poppins's East European cousin, who happens to run a 'fix-it' shop situated in London and also Van Dyke, who appeared in the 1964 original as Bert appears in the sequel as Mr Dawes Jr, the retired chairman of the Fidelity Fiduciary Bank and also the uncle of Wilkins.\n\nThe film in question is set in London during 'THE GREAT DEPRESSION' sees Mary Poppins (Blunt), the former nanny of Jane and Michael Banks ( Mortimer and Wishaw), return to them in the wake of Michael's wife's passing.\n\nAlso 'MARY POPPINS RETURNS' the sequel to 'MARY POPPINS' makes this as the 'longest intermission' in film sequels ever made between the original and the sequel in cinematic history in over fifty-four years.\n\nIn 1977, 'thirteen years later' after the movie came out in 1964, Travers was made as an Officer of the Order of the British Empire - 'O.B.E.' - for short - and sadly on April 23, 1996, 'nineteen years later' on St George's Day, Travers 'passed away' in London, at the age of 'ninety-six' years - the result of which - was in fact - the effects of an epileptic seizure.\n\nBut it was at the end that Travers in question had planned to write 'GOODBYE MARY POPPINS' - this story is to terminate not only the beloved governess, but instead had in fact heeded the outcry from both children and also the publishers.\n\nIn 2004, the stage version of 'MARY POPPINS' - the 1964 film classic - and which was also closer to Travers's original creation of the character in question -debuted on the stage in London, plus 'SUPERCALIFRAGILISTICEXPIALIDOCIOUS' (you try saying that after a couple of spring wines that even Granny Ridgeway enjoys at this time of the year because after a few scoops 'she's as high as a kite' - in her own unique corner of life - courtesy of Aldi - other shops selling alcoholic beverages to herald the beginning of the Spring/Summer season of 2024 - after a wet winter - are also available) through a song - that's one of many - written by the Sherman Brothers - Richard M. and Robert B. - (and originally performed by Andrews and Van Dyke) in the film - that forever lives on in the English lexicon .\n\nBut now, the film in question, which by the way, in 2024 is celebrating its 60th anniversary, by reissuing it once again only in movie theaters - and just in time for the forthcoming Easter Break - for this is classed as an American musical fantasy comedy film and directed by Robert Edward Stevenson, a British American film director and also a screenwriter.\n\nNow, the story of this, which combines live-action and also animation, if you need reminding is as follows, for it stars Dame Julie Andrews,( for this was in fact her film debut) as Mary Poppins, and who visits a dysfunctional family in Cherry Tree Lane, a suburb of London including David Tomlinson as George Banks, the man who employs Mary Poppins and is also a strict father to Jane and Michael plus Glynis Johns as Winifred Banks, the distracted wife of George Banks, and also the mother of Jane and Michael, plus her character in question is depicted as a member of Emmeline Pankhurst's 'VOTES FOR WOMEN' suffrage movement and then there's Dick Van Dyke as Bert, that's described as a 'jack-of-all-trades' and also Poppins's closet friend, and who is also completely accustomed to her magic, however their playful magic of a chemistry between them which also includes their interactions would imply that they have known each other for a long time - and also that this kind of a unique story has in fact been repeated so many times - and also Van Dyke's original character of Bert involves so many jobs throughout the movie - involving 'a one-man band', 'a sidewalk chalk artist', a chimney sweep and also a kite-seller - to his name.\n\nHowever, after winning the role of Bert in the movie Van Dyke had encountered a unique problem - as he had some trouble with his Cockney accent - although he had some coaching by J. Pat O'Malley into improving his Cockney accent - this is considered by many as 'one of the most poorer accents in film history - and that in 2003, 'EMPIRE' - a film magazine - described it as the NUMBER 2 WORST ACCENT OF ALL-TIME, - but also that Van Dyke in question had claimed that O'Malley 'didn't do an accent any better than I did'.\n\nNow, as you would expect, this is a musical-epic of a movie lasting nearly two hours and twenty minutes - ok so it's actually 139 mins in total but this movie in question has plenty of songs including 'FEED THE BIRDS', 'CHIM-CHIM-CHEREE', 'A SPOONFUL OF SUGAR HELPS THE MEDICINE GO DOWN' ( this is classed as an NHS anthem - just about the time that you would go down to the theatre for your long-awaited procedure so 'PREPARE YOURSELF' for the experience of your life ) 'JOLLY HOLIDAY' and also 'LET'S GO AND FLY A KITE' - that are among the many that's featured in this movie which is suitable for all the family to enjoy and maybe sing along to enjoy at your heart's content that once you have seen this that you'll be singing them all the way home back to your establishments.\n\nNow the musical version of the 1964 classic produced by Walt Disney himself has had many reviews from various aspects involving many organisations of the press in question and it has been described as a magical film for all ages - for this is classed as a magical movie with the Banks family's Cherry Tree Lane residence that's transformed into a doll's house (Sorry Barbie, but if your name's not down - then you're not coming in ! ) full of wonders, - also the story of this 'timeless classic' is not only a masterful mix of a movie with the additional spice of Travers's original novels and also a few ideas of Julian Fellows who created 'DOWNTON ABBEY' - but however, some memorable scenes from the movie in question - are replaced with much weirder interludes - this is a musical of a movie that pulls out all the theatrical stops - complete with a dash of physical comedy, puppetry, clever lighting and also the occasional breaking of the fourth wall - but in those days long before the fruition of Computer-Generated-Imagery - the sheer imagination of creating a blockbuster movie with special effects was simply 'old-school-techinques'.\n\nBut the real reason why 'MARY POPPINS' has been reissued back into movie theaters for Easter 2024 - is simply this - back in 1964 - the British Board Of Film Classification -'BBFC' - was originally rated as an 'U' Certification - which means that the film in question was seen by everyone - but in February 2024, the BBFC - in question had reclassified it from a 'U' Certification rating to a 'PG' Certification rating - and the reason for this is because when the film was originally shown in its entirety it featured two uses of racial slurs that was spoken in the movie by Reginald Owen, a British actor who played the part of Admiral Bloom in the movie - his character in the film sees distant chimney sweeps and whose faces have been blackened by soot and shouts at the top of his voice 'We're being attacked by hottentots', this is classed as 'an adopted name' for the 'Khoikhoi' that's used by the Dutch settlers, though its was originally thought that it was to originally imitate their original language - and which is also considered as offensive - the word in question would later be used to refer to all 'black' people.\n\nHowever, a spokesman for the BBFC, told 'THE MAIL' - the following statement:\n\n''We understand from our racism and discrimination research... that a key concern for... parents is the potential to expose children to discriminatory language or behaviour which they may find distressing or repeat without realising the potential offence''.\n\n''The content involved with immediate and also the clear condemnation is more likely to receive a lower rating''\n\nHowever, the reclassification of this timeless classic only affects the version shown in movie theaters - the certification of this that's advertised on home entertainment located in. your establishments is 'not affected' - and is unchanged because classic movies such as this 'what its original content' should be viewed by everyone.\n\nCinema is in fact an experience that should be seen by everyone of all ages - whether they like it or not - for it is their choice of whatever genre of movies they enjoy - because at the end of the day - is that the average person pays their hard earned cash each to see a blockbuster movie located in a movie theater.\n\nThis is a unique masterpiece to see a Walt Disney classic with all the family.\n\nDon't Miss It !\n\nHappy Easter"
