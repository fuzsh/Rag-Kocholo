        "text": "LOS ANGELES — When Rob Marshall, the director of the film “Mary Poppins Returns,” realized that Dick Van Dyke was the same age as the grizzled London banker he played in his second role in the original 1964 “Mary Poppins,” Marshall had a eureka! moment: Why not ask Van Dyke, now 93, to play Mr. Dawes Jr., the banker’s son, for the sequel? At the time, Marshall had not met the tripping-over-the-ottoman star of “The Dick Van Dyke Show,” but the filmmaker wasn’t worried that Van Dyke wasn’t up to the physical challenge. Marshall recalled that he once saw the actor at a Malibu grocery store, “and he was literally dancing up and down the aisles while he was shopping.”\n\nSet in Depression-era England, “Mary Poppins Returns,” which opened on Dec. 19, follows that tinkly-voiced child-minder (Emily Blunt, stepping into the Julie Andrews part) as she descends from the sky again to brighten the lives of the Banks family: the rumpled widower Michael (Ben Whishaw), his three young children and his activist sister, Jane (Emily Mortimer). Lin-Manuel Miranda shows up as Poppins’s sidekick, Jack, a lamplighter. It isn’t until late in the film that Van Dyke makes his bushy-haired, bewhiskered appearance, but Marshall said that the veteran hoofer (who also played the chimney sweep Bert in the original) aced his cameo — a two-minute monologue with a bit of ad-libbing, a jump onto a desk, followed by dancing — in “two takes, maybe three. He just nailed it.”\n\n[Read our interview with Lin-Manuel Miranda on “Mary Poppins Returns.”]\n\nVan Dyke has been practicing since his high school days in Danville, Ill., where he jettisoned plans to join the ministry soon after he discovered drama class. He went on to do it all: He was one-half of a touring mime team, a television announcer, a radio disc jockey. It was the theater director and choreographer Gower Champion who saw potential in Van Dyke’s rubbery-legged agility and cast him as the lead in a Broadway production of “Bye Bye Birdie.”\n\n“But Mr. Champion, I don’t dance,” Van Dyke told him.\n\n“We’ll teach you,” Champion promised. Since then, Van Dyke hasn’t stopped moving.\n\nLast month, he attended the “Mary Poppins Returns” world premiere at the Dolby Theater. It followed a couple of chaotic weeks. The Woolsey wildfire crept so close to his Malibu home that he and his wife, Arlene Silver, 47, had to be evacuated. (The couple met through her work as a makeup artist.) At the premiere, Van Dyke, spry but holding a cane, had to navigate a press-filled red carpet nearly a city block long. When a wall of paparazzi roared, “Dance for us, Dick!,” the blue-eyed star smiled and obliged with a jaunty soft shoe.\n\nBefore Van Dyke was swallowed up by the hoopla, he sat on a folding chair and spoke of what it was like to revisit “Mary Poppins” after a 54-year recess; how the “Poppins” author, P. L. Travers, would have regarded “Returns”; and how he stays in shape. A week later, by phone, with his wife gently keeping him on course, he answered a few more questions. Here are excerpts from the two conversations.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
