        "text": "\"List of Disney films\" redirects here. For a broader list of Disney films, see Lists of Walt Disney Studios films.\n\nThis is a list of films produced by and released under the Walt Disney Pictures banner (known as that since 1983, with Never Cry Wolf as its first release) and films released before that under the former name of the parent company, Walt Disney Productions (1929–1983). Most films listed here were distributed theatrically in the United States by the company's distribution division, Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, formerly known as Buena Vista Film Distribution Company (1953–1960), Buena Vista Distribution Company (1960–1987) and Buena Vista Pictures Distribution (1987–2007). The Disney features produced before The Living Desert (1953) were originally distributed by United Artists and RKO Radio Pictures, and are now distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures. Some films produced by Walt Disney Pictures are also released through the parent company's streaming service, Disney+.[1][2]\n\nThis list is organized by release date and includes live-action feature films (including theatrical, direct-to-video and streaming releases), animated feature films (including films developed and produced by Walt Disney Animation Studios and Pixar Animation Studios) and documentary films (including titles from the True-Life Adventures series and films produced by the Disneynature label). For an exclusive list of animated films released by Walt Disney Pictures and its previous entities see List of Disney theatrical animated feature films and List of Disney feature-length home entertainment releases § Animated films.\n\nThis list is only for films released under the main Disney banner. It does not include films produced or released by other existing, defunct or divested labels or subsidiaries owned by Walt Disney Studios (i.e. Marvel Studios, Lucasfilm, 20th Century Studios, Searchlight Pictures, Fox 2000 Pictures, Touchstone Pictures, Hollywood Pictures, National Geographic Documentary Films, Miramax Films, Dimension Films, ESPN Films, etc.) unless they are credited as co-production partners, nor any direct-to-video releases unless they were produced under the main Disney banner, TV films, theatrical re-releases or films originally released by other non-Disney studios.\n\nAll films listed are theatrical releases and/or American-based films unless specified.\n\nA ‡ symbol signifies a direct-to-video or streaming release exclusively through Disney+.\n\nA † symbol signifies a premium video on demand release through Disney+.\n\nA § symbol signifies a simultaneous release to theatres and on premium video on demand.\n\nA * symbol signifies a film not produced in the United States, but rather in another country.\n\nReleased\n\n1930s–1940s\n\nRelease date Title Notes December 21, 1937 Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs first film to be distributed by RKO Radio Pictures\n\nInducted into the National Film Registry in 1989 February 7, 1940 Pinocchio Inducted into the National Film Registry in 1994 November 13, 1940 Fantasia anthology film\n\nInducted into the National Film Registry in 1990 June 20, 1941 The Reluctant Dragon fictionalized tour around the Disney studio October 23, 1941 Dumbo Inducted into the National Film Registry in 2017 August 21, 1942 Bambi Inducted into the National Film Registry in 2011 February 6, 1943 Saludos Amigos anthology film July 17, 1943 Victory Through Air Power documentary film with wide use of animation; distributed by United Artists February 3, 1945 The Three Caballeros anthology film April 20, 1946 Make Mine Music anthology film November 12, 1946 Song of the South September 27, 1947 Fun and Fancy Free anthology film May 27, 1948 Melody Time anthology film November 29, 1948 So Dear to My Heart October 5, 1949 The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad anthology film\n\n1950s\n\nRelease date Title Notes February 15, 1950 Cinderella Inducted into the National Film Registry in 2018 July 29, 1950 Treasure Island produced by RKO-Walt Disney British Productions July 28, 1951 Alice in Wonderland June 26, 1952 The Story of Robin Hood produced by RKO-Walt Disney British Productions February 5, 1953 Peter Pan July 23, 1953 The Sword and the Rose produced by RKO-Walt Disney British Productions November 10, 1953 The Living Desert first film to be distributed by Buena Vista Pictures Distribution February 27, 1954 Rob Roy: The Highland Rogue produced by RKO-Walt Disney British Productions; last film to be distributed by RKO Radio Pictures August 16, 1954 The Vanishing Prairie December 23, 1954 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea May 25, 1955 Davy Crockett: King of the Wild Frontier compilation film mostly made up from pre-existing footage from the Disney anthology television series June 22, 1955 Lady and the Tramp Inducted into the National Film Registry in 2023.
