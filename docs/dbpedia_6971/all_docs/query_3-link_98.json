        "text": "2023 was not the sort of box office year that Disney had been used to having. However, 2024 has so far been a very different story. Thanks to multiple success stories including Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes, Inside Out 2 becoming the highest-grossing animated movie ever, and the killer opening weekend for Deadpool & Wolverine, Disney is back in familiar territory, as the biggest movie studio in the world.\n\nWith a new Alien movie and the surprise sequel to Moana announced for theaters, the rest of 2024, and beyond, are looking bright for the House that Walt built. Here's the full list of all of Disney's theatrical projects including every upcoming Marvel movie, every Disney and Pixar animation project, and every upcoming Star Wars movie.\n\nAlien: Romulus\n\nRelease Date: August 16, 2024\n\nThe first movie in the Alien franchise since Disney took over 20th Century Fox, the movie will be set following the first Alien movie, thus avoiding any issues with future sequels. Directed by Don't Breathe's Fede Álvarez, the movie is looking to be a true horror sequel rather than the action focused entry of James Cameron's Aliens.\n\nA Real Pain\n\nRelease Date: October 18, 2024\n\nWritten and directed by Jesse Eisenberg, A Real Pain stars him alongside Kieran Culkin as cousins who reunite to our Poland as a way to honor their grandmother.\n\nMoana 2\n\nRelease Date: November 27, 2024\n\nIn a surprising announcement, Disney revealed that a planned Moana series for Disney+ will instead be a theatrical movie. According to the plot synopsis, after receiving an unexpected call for her wayfinding ancestors, Moana must journey into unknown waters. Dwayne Johnson will also return as Maui.\n\nNightbitch\n\nRelease Date: December 6, 2024 (limited)\n\nThis new Searchlight project, based on the book of the same name, stars Amy Adams as a woman who recently became a stay-at-home mom and finds herself transforming into a dog.\n\nMufasa: The Lion King\n\nRelease Date: December 20, 2024\n\nThe Lion King was a massive hit as both a traditionally animated film and as a technically impressive CGI remake. While that success meant several direct-to-video sequels for the original, it means a CGI prequel for the remake. Mufasa: The Lion King will follow the life of Simba’s father, and it’s set to be directed by the great Barry Jenkins, so this one is going to be worth checking out.\n\nCaptain America: Brave New World\n\nRelease Date: February 14, 2025\n\nThe fourth Captain America movie will be the first one not to star Chris Evans in the title role. Anthony Mackie’s Sam Wilson took on the mantle in The Falcon and the Winter Soldier on Disney+, and he’ll take Cap back to the big screen in Captain America: Brave New World, previously subtitled New World Order. Not a lot is known about the film at this time, but it will see the long-awaited return of Tim Blake Nelson to the MCU as The Leader, as well as Harrison Ford, taking over the role of \"Thunderbolt\" Ross from the late William Hurt. Most recently we learned that Liv Tyler will also return to the MCU as Betty Ross, so the new Captain America film is turning into a minor Incredible Hulk reunion.\n\nUntitled Disney\n\nRelease Date: March 7, 2025\n\nDisney's Snow White\n\nRelease Date: March 21, 2025\n\nBefore most people saw her in West Side Story, Rachel Zegler was cast in the live-action adaptation of Snow White. After the world saw that dance-filled remake, though, we could not wait to see this updated story. This one goes back to the original hit for Walt Disney Studios, and while we know this Snow White adaptation will make some key changes to the original story regarding the dwarfs, it will also include some new original songs from Benj Pasek and Justin Paul of The Greatest Showman.\n\nThe Amateur\n\nRelease Date: April 11, 2025\n\nThis 20th Century Studios project will star Rami Malek as a CIA cryptographer who goes after the terrorists who killed his wife when his agency refuses to help.\n\nThunderbolts\n\nRelease Date: May, 2, 2025\n\nIt’s going to be a long time in between Avengers movies for the MCU, but in 2024 we’ll get a different sort of team-up with Marvel’s version of the Suicide Squad, Thunderbolts. At D23 2022 we learned who the Thunderbolts team will consist of: Sebastian Stan’s Winter Soldier. Florence Pugh’s Yelena, David Harbour’s Red Guardian, and Olga Kurylenko’s Taskmaster, all from Black Widow. The team will also include Wyatt Russell’s US Agent from The Falcon and the Winter Soldier and Hannah John Kamen’s Ghost from Ant-Man and the Wasp.\n\nUntitled Disney\n\nRelease Date: May 23, 2025\n\nElio\n\nRelease Date: June 13, 2025\n\nElio is the story of an 11-year-old boy who gets transported across the galaxy and finds himself mistaken for an ambassador for the planet Earth. Newcomer Yonas Kibreab voices Elio, while America Ferrera will voice the boy's mother. Adrian Molina, the co-director of Coco, will be helming this one as his first solo directorial effort for Pixar. Originally set for a summer 2024 release, the movie was delayed more than a full year\n\nFantastic Four\n\nRelease Date: July 25, 2025\n\nThe first family of comics will finally make its Marvel Cinematic Universe debut following years of speculation. On Valentine's Day 2024, the long-rumored main cast of Fantastic Four was finally confirmed. Pedro Pascal is Reed Richard, Vanessa Kirby is Sue Storm, Ebon Moss-Bachrach is Ben Grimm and Joseph Quinn will be Johnny Storm. Indications are that the movie will be at least partially set in the 1960s, the era when the Fantastic Four first made their mark in superhero comics.\n\nTron: Ares\n\nRelease Date: October 10, 2025\n\nThe Tron franchise has had a rough time at the movies, and yet, the program refuses to end. The long anticipated, and long believed-dead third Tron movie, Ares starring Jared Leto, recently completed filming, so fans won't have too long to wait for their return to The Grid.\n\nBlade\n\nRelease Date: November 7, 2025\n\nFirst revealed at San Diego Comic-Con in 2019, we knew that Mahershala Ali would play Blade in the same instant we learned a Blade movie was even happening in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. At this point, that’s still basically all we know. Director Bassam Tariq recently left the film, causing a delay in production and release date, but the movie is still reportedly moving forward.\n\nZootopia 2\n\nRelease Date: November 26, 2025\n\nWhile Disney CEO Bob Iger had previously confirmed that Zootopia 2 was coming, exactly when we'd see it was unknown. Finally, on the Q1 2024 earnings call, Bob Iger gave Zootopia 2 a 2025 release date. Plot and characters are still unknown, but hopefully, all our familiar friends will be back.\n\nAvatar 3\n\nRelease Date: December 19, 2025\n\nAvatar 3 was filmed concurrently with Avatar: The Way of Water, so we know the movie is on the way, but with the release so far in the future, we likely won’t hear much about it any time soon. We do know it will include a tribe of Na'vi who live around volcanoes, known as the Ash People, who, unlike the Reef people of Avatar 2, will be antagonists to Jake Sully and his family.\n\nUntitled Disney\n\nRelease Date: January 16, 2026\n\nUntitled Marvel\n\nRelease Date: February 13, 2026\n\nUntitled Pixar\n\nRelease Date: March 6, 2026\n\nUntitled Disney\n\nRelease Date: March 27, 2026\n\nUntitled Disney\n\nRelease Date: April 17, 2026\n\nAvengers: Doomsday\n\nRelease Date: May 1, 2026\n\nThe MCU multiverse was born in the first season of Loki with the introduction of Jonathan Majors as Kang. With Marvel's decision to split from Jonathan Majors, this movie appeared to cease to exist, and it was only a matter of time before something new would be announced. That finally happened at SDCC in 2024 when Avengers: Doomsday was announced in place of the previous film, starring a returning Robert Downey Jr. as Doctor Doom.\n\nThe Mandalorian & Grogu\n\nRelease Date: May 22, 2026\n\nWe haven't seen a new Star Wars project on the big screen since The Rise of Skywalker, and it seems the plan is that the first one we see in years will have started on Disney+. The Mandalorian & Grogu movie has been officially confirmed as the first new Star Wars movie we get, when it arrives in the summer of 2026.\n\nToy Story 5\n\nRelease Date: June 19, 2026\n\nWhile we don't yet know anything about what Toy Story 5 will be about, we do know when we will see it. The film has been given an official release date of June 2026.\n\nMoana (Live-Action)\n\nRelease Date: July 10, 2026\n\nKnowing how successful live-action remakes of Disney movies are, we probably could have guessed that a live-action Moana would happen someday, but few probably expected to happen so fast. Less than a decade after the animated hit was released, the live action version is set to debut. Dwayne Johnson will reprise his role in the flesh as Maui. Auli'i Cravalho will not be back on screen, opening the door for another newcomer to make a splash, but the original Moana is involved as a producer.\n\nUntitled Marvel\n\nRelease Date: July 24, 2026\n\nUntitled Disney\n\nRelease Date: August 14, 2026\n\nUntitled Disney\n\nRelease Date: September 18, 2026\n\nUntitled Marvel\n\nRelease Date: November 6, 2026\n\nUntitled Disney Animation (Frozen 3?)\n\nRelease Date: November 25, 2026\n\nFrozen 3 has not been specifically dated, but we know Frozen 3 is happening and during the Disney Q1 2024 earnings call Bob Iger said it would arrive in 2026. No other Walt Disney Animation Studios films are scheduled to be released in 2026, so this appears to be the date for the next Frozen movie, though things could still change.\n\nUntitled Star Wars\n\nRelease Date: December 18, 2026\n\nAfter many years of confusion regarding the future of the Star Wars universe on the big screen, we finally received some details. At the recent Star Wars Celebration in London, three new movies were confirmed. One of them will see Daisy Ridley return as Rey in a film directed by Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy. A second film will be directed by Dave Filoni and will act as a culmination of the current Disney+ series that he has produced. A third project, directed by James Mangold will tell the story of the first Jedi. An older project, written and directed by Taika Waititi is also still in development. Which of these projects this one will be is unknown.\n\nAvengers: Secret Wars\n\nRelease Date: May 7, 2027\n\nSecret Wars is one of the most popular comic crossover stories that Marvel has ever created, and so there’s already a lot of excitement surrounding a movie of the same name. Avengers: Secret Wars is set to be the official end of Phase Six of the MCU and The Multiverse Saga, but that’s really all we know at this point.\n\nUntitled Star Wars\n\nRelease Date: December 17, 2027\n\nAfter many years of confusion regarding the future of the Star Wars universe on the big screen, we finally received some details. At the recent Star Wars Celebration in London, three new movies were confirmed. One of them will see Daisy Ridley return as Rey in a film directed by Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy. A second film will be directed by Dave Filoni and will act as a culmination of the current Disney+ series that he has produced. A third project, directed by James Mangold will tell the story of the first Jedi. An older project, written and directed by Taika Waititi is also still in development. Which of these projects this one will be is unknown.\n\nAvatar 4\n\nRelease Date: December 21, 2029\n\nJames Cameron has said that parts of Avatar 4 were filmed alongside Avatar: The Way of Water and Avatar 3, but another massive production will need to get underway to finish out the five-movie cycle. One certainly hopes that it won’t take as long to happen as it did to make the first sequel.\n\nAvatar 5\n\nRelease Date: December 19, 2031\n\nThe final Avatar movie will finally arrive in 2028, assuming there are not more delays, and Cameron doesn’t get it in his head to write more sequels.\n\nWhile all of this is, of course, subject to change, and there are a lot of “Untitled” movies we know literally nothing about, there’s plenty here that is likely to keep Disney on top of the box office for several more years to come. Continue below for a look back at recently released Disney films.\n\nPreviously Released\n\nIndiana Jones And The Dial Of Destiny\n\nRelease Date: June 30, 2023\n\nAfter 15 years, Indiana Jones returned one more time. The first trailer revealed the official title, Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, and showed off both an older Indy, as well as de-aged Harrison Ford, indicating that the new adventure has elements tied to Indy's past. James Mangold took over the directing duties on Indiana Jones 5 from Steven Spielberg. Mads Mikkelsen plays the film’s villain, while Phoebe Waller-Bridge is Indy’s goddaughter. If you haven't checked it out yet, read CinemaBlend's Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny review to see what we thought.\n\nHaunted Mansion\n\nRelease Date: July 28, 2023\n\nThis studio has been somewhat hit or miss when it comes to movies based on Disney theme park rides. One of the previous failures was a movie based on the popular Haunted Mansion. But, never let it be said they won’t try again after a failure. The new movie stared Rosario Dawson as a woman who moves into the titular New Orleans mansion but then needs to find help when she discovers it’s already inhabited, but 999 happy haunts. The new Haunted Mansion was received better by critics than the previous iteration, but it struggled at the box office just as much.\n\nA Haunting In Venice\n\nRelease Date: September 15, 2023\n\nA Haunting in Venice saw the return of Kenneth Branagh's Hercule Poirot for a third big-screen outing. This time things took a turn for the supernatural when Poirot attended a séance, where another guest turns up dead. As with previous entries, this one will be a star-studded affair with Jamie Dornan, Tina Fey, and Michelle Yeoh. The film saw some of the best responses from critics the franchise has seen so far, so this may not be the last we see of Poirot.\n\nThe Creator\n\nRelease Date: September 29, 2023\n\nOriginally called True Love, The Creator was directed by Rogue One's Gareth Edwards and starred John David Washington, Gemma Chan, Allison Janney, and Ken Watanabe. The science fiction film that saw humanity in an ongoing war with artificial intelligence. Washington plays a soldier who finds a child of AI, of unexplained origin, that humanity wants to destroy, but he feels he must protect.\n\nThe Marvels\n\nRelease Date: November 10, 2023\n\nWhat was once called Captain Marvel 2 eventually became The Marvels. WandaVision gave superpowers to Monica Rambeau, and Iman Vellani, who debuted as Ms. Marvel in her own Disney+ series prior to this film joined forces with Brie Larson's Carol Danvers. Together they fought a new intergalactic foe while dealing with their peers becoming entangled with each other. While The Marvels was not a box office smash, it seems likely the events of the film will be key to the MCU's future.\n\nNext Goal Wins\n\nRelease Date: November 17, 2023\n\nFollowing his success with Thor: Love and Thunder, Taika Waititi shifted focus from superhero action to sports action. Next Goal Wins told the true story of Thomas Rongen (Michael Fassbender), who was hired to coach the national soccer team of American Samoa, seen as one of the worst teams in the world.\n\nWish\n\nRelease Date: November 22, 2023\n\nFor Disney's 100th anniversary, Walt Disney animation went back to its roots with Wish. It was an animated film that saw a strong female protagonist in a magical animated musical, exactly the sort of story that put Walt Disney Studios on the map. The first trailer for Wish revealed an absolutely beautiful art style and Chris Pine as the movie's villain. Unfortunately, the movie wasn't a massive hit at the box office. Time will tell if audiences discover it on Disney+.\n\nPoor Things\n\nRelease Date: December 8, 2023\n\nFrom Emma Stone and director Yorgos Lanthimos, who previously brought us the absolutely wonderful, The Favorite, Poor Things was a take on the story of Frankenstein that saw Stone's character as a woman brought to life by a doctor played by Willem Dafoe. The film has been widely praised by critics, especially Stone's performance as Bella. Expect this one to be a major awards contender.\n\nAll Of Us Strangers\n\nRelease Date: December 22, 2022\n\nA chance encounter between two men in a nearly empty apartment building leads one of them, played by Andrew Scott to face memories of his past, revisiting his childhood home, where he sees his parents again, despite the fact that they've been dead for 30 years. It looks to be a haunting character drama from director Andrew Haigh.\n\nThe First Omen\n\nRelease Date: April 5, 2024\n\nA prequel to 1976's horror classic The Omen, the new film focused on an American woman working at a church in Rome who discovers a plot to bring about the Antichrist.\n\nKingdom of the Planet of the Apes\n\nRelease Date: May 10, 2024\n\nThe last Planet of the Apes trilogy was a major hit for Fox, and now that Fox is under the Disney umbrella it's time to start again. Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes followed on the events of the previous trilogy, but was set many years later, and focused on a new generation of apes that have now taken control of the planet, and do battle with each other.\n\nThe Young Woman And The Sea\n\nRelease Date: May 31, 2024\n\nOriginally planned as a Disney+ movie, The Young Woman and the Sea was instead released in theaters. The film starred Daisy Ridley as Gertrude Ederle, the Olympic gold medalist who became the first woman to swim the English Channel.\n\nInside Out 2\n\nRelease Date: June 14, 2024\n\nPixar has released a string of generally well-received original films in the last few years, but we’ll see our first direct sequel since Toy Story 4 with Inside Out 2 in 2024.
