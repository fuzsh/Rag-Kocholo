        "text": "FOR most of us the name Walt Disney is synonymous with the childhood joy of watching one of his famous animated films.\n\nBut who exactly was the American entrepreneur and cultural icon? We’ve got all the details for you here…\n\nWho was Walt Disney?\n\nBorn in 1901, Walt Disney had a passion for drawing and took a job aged 18 as a commercial illustrator.\n\nIn the early 20s he felt the bright lights of Hollywood calling his name and moved from his home town of Chicago to Los Angeles where he set up Disney Brothers Studio with his brother Roy.\n\nWalt Disney was married in 1925 to ink artist Lillian Bounds, who he had hired earlier that year, the pair had two daughters Diane and Sharon.\n\nIn 1928 Walt created Mickey Mouse, which he gave his voice to until 1947, this would become his first big success.\n\nAs the studio grew, Walt became increasingly adventurous and introduced synchronised sound and feature-length cartoons to his repertoire.\n\nIn 1937 he produced his first big feature film Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs which was closely followed by Fantasia and Pinocchio in 1940.\n\nDuring the war he produced instruction films for the military.\n\nAfter the war he created hugely successful films such as Cinderella and Mary Poppins, which won five Oscars.\n\nWalt is the most decorated film producer to date.\n\nHe earned 22 Academy Awards from 59 nominations as well as two Golden Globe Special Achievement Awards and an Emmy.\n\nBut he wasn’t content with just cinematic success and in the 50s he expanded into the theme park industry opening Disneyland in 1955.\n\nHe started construction of Disney World, a second theme park, in 1965.\n\nIt was supposed to be in the heart of a new type of city, the “experimental prototype community of tomorrow” but unfortunately he died before its completion.\n\nWhen did Walt Disney die?\n\nWalt was a big smoker, taking up the habit in World War I.\n\nAfter the conflict he continued to smoke heavily up until his death.\n\nBut in 1966, he was diagnosed with lung cancer and despite having a lung removed, it wasn't enough to save him and he died of lung cancer in December 1966\n\nDisney died aged 65 and sadly passed away before the park or city of his “experimental prototype community of tomorrow” was finished.\n\nWas he really cryogenically frozen?\n\nFor decades there have been rumours that Walt Disney was cryogenically frozen, after his death.\n\nThe myth is believed to have been started in 1972 when Bob Nelson told the Los Angeles Times that \"Walt Disney wanted to be frozen.\"\n\nHowever, according to MentalFloss, the tale is not true and Walt Disney was apparently cremated on December 17, 1966.\n\nAnd to help dispel the myth, Disney's daughter Diane Disney Miller opened the Walt Disney Family Museum in 2009.\n\nHow many films did Walt Disney make?\n\nDuring his years as a filmmaker, Walt Disney acted, produced, and directed hundreds of films and shorts, in total he finished almost 1,000 projects.\n\nHowever, most people will remember him for the major Disney classics he created, such as:\n\nSnow White and the Seven Dwarfs 1937\n\nPinocchio 1940\n\nFantasia 1940\n\nDumbo 1941\n\nBambi 1942\n\nSaludos Amigos 1942\n\nThe Three Cabelaros 1944\n\nMelody Time 1948\n\nThe Adventures of Icahbod and Mr Toad 1949\n\nCinderella 1950\n\nAlice In Wonderland 1951\n\nPeter Pan 1953\n\nLady and the Tramp 1955\n\nSleeping Beauty 1959\n\n101 Dalamations 1961\n\nThe Sword in the Stone 1963"
