        "text": "Get the extra big bag of candles because Walt Disney Studios is turning 100! And we’re celebrating the occasion with our selection 100 essential Disney movies that illuminate the company’s century-long commitment to wonder, whimsy, imagination, and family-grade entertainment.\n\nPresented by latest releases first, we’ve covered every corner of the house mouse. Of course, it all starts with 1937’s Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, which kicked out decades of an animation golden age that includes Pinocchio, Dumbo, Bambi, Cinderella, Alice in Wonderland, Sleeping Beauty, and One Hundred and One Dalmatians. Disney also established their style of live-action films in this era, including Mary Poppins, The Love Bug, 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, and Swiss Family Robinson.\n\nThe 1980s led the way to the Disney Renaissance, a period which produced The Lion King, Aladdin, Beauty and Beast, The Little Mermaid and more. And starting in 2010 with Tangled, we saw another Disney resurgence the featured Wreck-It Ralph, Moana, Zootopia, and Frozen.\n\nTo tighten our selections, we picked only movies that presented the Disney logo on release, so nothing from the 20th Century Fox acquisition or from labels like Touchstone Pictures. But, yes, that means all of Pixar is fair game, since Disney has presented their movies ever since Toy Story revolutionized animation in 1995.\n\nAnd just like during the early 20th century golden age, plenty of live-action favorites have been produced in recent decades, including National Treasure, Remember the Titans, Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl, and The Muppets.\n\nFor a studio so rooted in childhood and nostalgia, it makes sense they’d be adept at navigating their own past for remakes, with The Lion King, Aladdin, The Jungle Book, Cinderella, and The Little Mermaid.\n\nCome celebrate a century of movies, music, and memories with Disney’s 100 years, 100 essential movies!\n\n#1\n\nThe Little Mermaid (2023) 67%\n\n#1\n\nAdjusted Score: 86885%\n\nCritics Consensus: With Halle Bailey making a major splash in the title role, Disney's live-action Little Mermaid ranks among the studio's most enjoyable reimaginings.\n\nSynopsis: The youngest of King Triton's daughters, and the most defiant, Ariel longs to find out more about the world beyond...
