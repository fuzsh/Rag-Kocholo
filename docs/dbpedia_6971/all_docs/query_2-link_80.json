        "text": "ASF's 'Mary Poppins' brings a classic to life\n\nIt has been 50 years since a magical nanny descended via umbrella into the lives of a Victorian British family — and onto cinema screens worldwide. In that time, \"Mary Poppins\" as told by Disney continues to touch viewers of all ages. It even spurred a stage musical that ultimately became a Broadway hit.\n\nStarting Wednesday, \"Mary Poppins\" will descend onto the Alabama Shakespeare Festival's stage in a \"million dollar production\" that has generated so much excitement that its run, originally set to end July 27, was extended to Aug. 10.\n\nThough the stage version differs in some ways from the movie, this production's biggest fans will likely be both children recently introduced to the film and adults who have treasured it for decades, said ASF Producing Artistic Director Geoffrey Sherman, who directs the show.\n\n\"I think the reason that this particular show works so well is that the movie is so good,\" said Sherman. \"Those songs. ... are just extraordinary. They stay with you, and they are are hummable and singable and everybody knows all the words. That, I think, makes for a more entertaining evening in the theater than if you don't know the show.\"\n\nThose songs include \"Chim-Chim-Cheree,\" \"Supercalifragilisticexpeilidocious,\" \"A Spoonful of Sugar\" and \"Jolly Holiday,\" with additional music written for the play by George Stiles and Anthony Drewe.\n\nIn the story, rambunctious siblings Jane and Michael have sent many a nanny packing before Mary Poppins arrives on their doorstep. Using a combination of magic and common sense, she teaches the family to value each other again.\n\nA storied spectacle\n\nASF is pulling out all the stops for this one, Sherman said. In the tradition of its past musicals such as \"Beauty and the Beast,\" \"Peter Pan\" and \"A Christmas Carol,\" \"Mary Poppins\" features a large cast, a lavish, elaborate set, costumes created on-site and a pit orchestra. Characters will also fly throughout the theater, as they have in every production of this adaptation of \"Mary Poppins.\"\n\n\"It really does utilize every resource we have in the building,\" She said. \"Big sets, lots of costumes. Every actor has at least five changes of costume, and that means that we started building this some months ago as the rep season was finishing. We were already into building 'Mary Poppins.'\"\n\nAfter all, the show began as a huge enterprise. Theater impresario Cameron Mackintosh, perhaps best known for producing megahits \"The Phantom of the Opera,\" \"Cats\" and \"Les Miserables,\" collaborated with Disney Theatrical to bring \"Mary Poppins\" to life onstage with a 2004 premiere in London's West End. After the production opened on Broadway in 2006, it had more than 2,500 performances and garnered seven Tony Award nominations and one win — for best scenic design — before closing in 2013.\n\nIt was only after Mackintosh met with \"Mary Poppins\" author P.L. Travers, who wrote eight books based on the character, that the musical was given the green light, with Travers' ultimatum that no Americans be involved in its development. She had not been a fan of the work of the songwriters, Robert and Richard Sherman.\n\n\"So this version is very similar to the movie and retains many, many of the songs, but a couple of new ones have crept in from English composers,\" Sherman said. \"I think the people who know the movie well will really enjoy coming to see something that is just slightly different.\"\n\nThe play features an ensemble of actors who have performed in numerous Broadway productions, as well as four young actors from the River Region area — Katie Cobb, Lucy Wilson, Caleb Campbell and Will Chieves — who rotate in playing the Banks children. Front and center is actress Alice Sherman as the famous nanny.\n\nThe role of a lifetime\n\nAlice Sherman won the title role after a slew of auditions and callbacks, vying to play \"Mary Poppins\" along with 34 professional actresses who were invited to audition in New York City.\n\n\"It's a role that I've always dreamed about playing,\" said Alice Sherman, who has performed this in several ASF productions — she was Belle in \"A Christmas Carol,\" Jordan Baker in \"The Great Gatsby,\" Widow in \"The Taming of the Shrew\" and the Painter in the world premiere of William Shakespeare's \"Timon of Athens.\" A graduate of Columbia University who received vocal training in opera studies at the Manhattan School of Music, she has also been seen in plays from Texas to New York to the United Kingdom.\n\nAs a child, she watched the movie again and again, but she wanted to start from scratch when it came to her portrayal.\n\n\"I love things that Julie Andrews had to offer, but I've also read the books, and I've seen the musical a couple of times — in London and on Broadway,\" she said. \"It's really just coming from my own perspective. I was raised with a British father and a mother who lived in England for 10 years, so I have an understanding of British sarcasm and wit — just that sense of humor that they have — it's a little condescending, but always comes from a place of love. They're always kidding. So that's what I'm bringing to it, the love and humor. That's just mine.\"\n\nEnlightening views\n\nTwo other characters who get a new spin are the children's parents, George and Winifred Banks, played by David Schmittou and Jean McCormick. Schmittou said there are some real eye-openers.\n\n\"It delves into a lot of the stories that aren't in the film,\" he said, adding that there are elements of the \"Mary Poppins\" books that the filmmakers left out. What's brought out, he said, is the change British society was seeing during the transition from Victorian to Edwardian eras. McCormick said a lot of the movie's creations were omitted from the play.\n\n\"In the movie, Mrs. Banks is a suffragette. That was not in the original books and that is not in the musical,\" she said. \"In the play, they do a lot more exploring of, why do they have a nanny? Does Mrs. Banks want to mother her children more, does she want to be more a part of their lives, and is she just not permitted to because of the constraints of the time period?\"\n\nMr. Banks is also seen through a new lens, Schmittou said. Like his wife, Mr. Banks also tries to balance his family's happiness with what society requires of \"a proper life.\"\n\nActor Bret Shuford portrays Bert, the Cockney chimney sweep made famous in the movie by Dick Van Dyke. Again, we get to know characters that only flitted in and out of the movie.\n\n\"His connection to the story is a little more fleshed out,\" Shuford said of Bert. \"He's actually more of a narrator to the audience, he helps connect the audience to the family and the story. Geoffrey has weaved me in and out of the audience to help keep the audience connected to the story.\"\n\nHe said the purpose of both Bert and Mary is to bring the Banks family back together.\n\n\"The real key to the story is the family,\" Shuford said. \"That's what people will walk away reminding themselves, especially in this day and age when it's all iPhones and Internet, that really what we're missing out on is each other and family.\"\n\nWANT TO GO?\n\nWhat: The Alabama Shakespeare Festival presents Disney and Cameron Mackintosh's \"Mary Poppins\"\n\nWhen: Wednesday through Aug. 10.\n\nWhere: The Alabama Shakespeare Festival, 1 Festival Drive in Montgomery's Blount Cultural Park."
