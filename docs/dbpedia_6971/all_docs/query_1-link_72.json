        "text": "Disney and Cameron Mackintosh’s Mary Poppins transports audiences to London at the turn of the last century.\n\nThings are not going well for the Banks family of Cherry Tree Lane. Jane and Michael are the two naughty children, and their stern father is determined to hire a no-nonsense nanny to teach his children precision and order. That’s when the practically-perfect Mary Poppins enters their lives, bringing a spoonful of magic with her. Taking the children on some jolly holidays, Mary introduces them to Bert – a jack-of-all-trades, a crew of friendly chimney sweeps and the little old Bird Woman. Pulling an invisible string here and there, Mary Poppins helps the Banks family learn to appreciate and understand each other.\n\nThis Tony Award-winning stage adaptation is not a replica of the film, but an original musical that honors some of its greatest achievements and most beloved moments. It features the favorite characters of the 1964 Disney film and favorite songs such as “Chim Chim Cher-ee,” “Step in Time,” “A Spoonful of Sugar” and “Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.” There’s plenty of spectacle, laughs and songs the whole family will keep singing after the show ends.\n\nLanguage\n\nNone.\n\nSexual Innuendo\n\nNone.\n\nDrugs and Alcohol\n\nOne line of dialogue mentions rum punch, and another refers to smoking.\n\nViolence\n\nNone.\n\nMature Content\n\nThe beginning of the show reveals difficult family dynamics within the Banks household."
