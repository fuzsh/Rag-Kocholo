        "text": "Interesting Mary Poppins Facts\n\nMary Poppins received 13 Academy Award nominations and won 5: Best Actress Julie Andrews, Best Film Editing,\n\nOriginal Music Score, Best Visual Effects, and Best Original Song for “Chim Chim Cher-ee.” Julie Andrews also won a Best Actress Golden Globe for Mary Poppins.\n\nMary Poppins underscoring was completed by Irwin Kostal who also scored other film musicals such as West Side Story, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang! and The Sound of Music.\n\nIn 2013, Mary Poppins was preserved by the U.S. National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being, “culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.”\n\nMary Poppins was the most profitable film of 1965 followed by The Sound of Music, Goldfinger and My Fair Lady. The revenue from Mary Poppins was used by Walt Disney to purchase 27, 500 acres in central Florida and finance\n\nthe construction of Walt Disney World.\n\nThe park where we first see Mary Poppins in the sequel is the same location where Sally Ann Howes sang, “Lovely\n\nLonely Man,” in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, filmed at the Pinewood Studios in London.\n\nFor the tub scene in the sequel’s, “Can You Imagine That?” a hole was cut in the floor of the tub for the actors to\n\ndisappear, leading to a slide below the bathroom set.\n\nEmily Blunt worked with director Rob Marshall before the sequel on the film musical Into the Woods.\n\nEmily Blunt read the Mary Poppins books to prepare for the sequel instead of watching the original film with Julie Andrews."
