        "text": "2023 marks the centenary for both Disney Studios and Warner Bros., two iconic studios that have shaped film industries, culture and history – expanding our imaginations and the way we see the world.\n\nThe films created by these studios have encouraged us to dream, aspire, mirror, empathise, see clearly ­– or even just to spend time in imaginary worlds – transcending our everyday lives.\n\nIn their own ways, Disney and Warner Bros. studios have acted as dominant forces in film history, contributing to the development of that magical cinematic formula, and all of its wild, experimental variations, that offer us illusionistic spaces to see, hear, feel, explore and lose ourselves within.\n\nThe Disney brothers came to California from Kansas in 1923 with a cartoon based on Alice In Wonderland to sell at a time when films were bought and sold outright.\n\nIn that same year, they established Disney Brothers Cartoon Studio. Changing the name to Walt Disney Studios and collaborating with major animators like Ub Iwerks, they expanded their animation production to include 75 musical short films, Silly Symphony (1929-1939) and, of course, the Mickey Mouse cartoons.\n\nArts & Culture\n\nThe Oscars shift from big screen to TV stream\n\nLarger scale, film-length animations followed and in 1934 they began production on Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, a film that took three years to draw and animate. But it was 1940’s Fantasia that really showed the potential for deep exploration of the relationship between music and animation.\n\nMeanwhile, in 1923, the four Warner brothers incorporated their film company, giving the studio its own identity and officially naming it Warner Bros.\n\nWarner Bros. became defined by their exploration of the potential of filmic technologies, particularly sound, and they released the ‘first talkie’ or film that synchronised sound with image in Al Jolson’s The Jazz Singer in 1927.\n\nAnd Warner Bros. pushed boundaries.\n\nAfter testing the limitations of censorship with their violent and popular pre-Code gangster films, they followed up with a series of ‘fallen women’ films like Baby Face (Alfred E. Green, 1933) which they were asked to pull out of distribution due to its licentiousness and refusal to punish the ambitious and highly sexual heroine, played by Barbara Stanwyck.\n\nOne hundred years after it was created Warner Bros. is now part of a vast media industry conglomerate that includes New Line Cinemas, DC Studios and Warner Bros. Discovery Home Entertainment, Games and Television Groups.\n\nTheir media library contains 125,000 feature films and 2,400 television programs, with more than 150,000 episodes.\n\nArts & Culture\n\nA doll is just a doll is just a doll\n\nIn essence, films created by both Warner Bros. and Disney Studios rely on innovative technologies, particularly machinic technologies in the celluloid era, to project soft, kinetic illusions that really do ask us to imagine what it is to be human, in all of its forms.\n\nSo, are you ready to test your knowledge?\n\nRound 1 - easy: 1 point each\n\nQ1: What is the name of the snowman in Disney’s animated film Frozen?\n\nOlaf\n\nQ2: Who am I?
