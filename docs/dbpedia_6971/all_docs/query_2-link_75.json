        "text": "COTUIT – The temptation has proven just too strong: the urge to use a famous, all-too-obvious “Mary Poppins” song title to describe Cotuit Center for the Arts’ stage production itself. But the show is, without exaggeration, supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.\n\nIt doesn’t work quite as well to borrow a song title to describe Sara Sneed’s performance as Mary Poppins. But that’s because it isn’t “Practically Perfect,” as Mary describes herself – it’s deliciously spot-on. Never mind that Julie Andrews won the best-actress Oscar for her role in the beloved 1964 Disney movie. Sneed gives her own indelible interpretation as the no-nonsense nanny with magical powers who instigates life-giving changes in the home of the Banks family at 17 Cherry Tree Lane in Edwardian London. She often conveys her thoughts subtly, perhaps through a sideways look or the merest hint of a smile, while lighting up the stage with her glowing presence and beautiful coloratura voice.\n\nThe stage version of “Mary Poppins” came 40 years after the movie, so – although it’s quite faithful to the film – there are certain differences: one being that Mary is a rather more mysterious presence. (Perhaps representing the spirit of imagination?) She’s unassailably assertive (in the most delightful way, of course) with the Banks parents, George, the remote, uptight banker father, and Winifred, the insecure wife and mother. She’s firm, though kindly, but not particularly affectionate with the two young Banks children. Mary Poppins’ mission is to help families build their own connections, not to make them dependent on herself.\n\nA virtual army of talented people are involved in this exceptional production, with producer Cindy Parker, director/choreographer Michele Colley and music director/pit conductor Kris Hill clearly deserving immense credit for pulling together all the moving parts.\n\nCertainly the 40-plus actors put heart and soul into their performances.\n\nThe role of George Banks is more prominent than in the movie, with the traumatic nanny experience of his youth serving to explain his sternness as an adult. Chris Schultz is excellent in the part, as is Rebecca Riley as Mrs. Banks. Miss Andrews, the wicked nanny herself, shows up in the form of Katie Lynch Koglin, humorously nasty as she forces a mixture of “Brimstone and Treacle” on the children.\n\nThe youngsters, Jane and Michael, are naughtier than their film counterparts. The two roles have been dual cast here, with Julia Ernst and Kaitlyn Markowski as Jane and Nathanael Schultz and Max Wesp as Michael. Julia and Nathanael charmed and impressed us in Tuesday’s opening-night performance. It’s amazing how much material these four youngsters have had to learn and how much time they spend on stage..\n\nElliott Sicard is wonderful as Bert, the classy cockney jack-of-all-trades, sometimes chimney sweep, who somehow – it’s never really spelled out – has known Mary Poppins in the past. He is, perhaps, a little in love with her. He certainly loves the magic she brings whenever she pops back into his life. Sicard brings a certain poignancy to his role, tying the story together with Bert’s signature “Chim Chim Cher-ee.”\n\nAlso meriting special mention are Holly Hansen as Mrs. Correy, an exuberant, magical woman who concocts words in her Talking Shop, and Anne Fosnot Spillane, as a beggar known as the Bird Woman.\n\nCris Reverdy has designed a beautiful set, with various segments given over to the Banks’ front door, their living room and the children’s bedroom. Walls turn to reveal George’s study and his office at the bank. Each element is just so. And above it all are the rooftops of London, with the city’s skyline against a luminous sky. There’s something quite haunting about that upper level.\n\nDesigned by Tami Trask, the array of authentic-looking period costumes also contributes greatly to the general dazzle and sense of place. Mary’s dresses are especially lovely, with such accessories as her cherry-trimmed hat and umbrella with a parrot head handle.\n\nThe entire cast wears headset microphones, which are unobtrusive and do help ensure clear, crisp lyrics. The small orchestra remains out of sight but gives dazzling support throughout the whole lavish production. The big ensemble numbers like “Jolly Holiday,” “Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious” and “Step in Time” (where chimney sweeps take over the rooftops as well as the “street-level” stage) all pack tremendous wow power.\n\nBut this is especially true for “Jolly Holiday,” where a sedate afternoon in the park turns into a joyful extravaganza in which even the “statues” come to life. (Actually, part of the wonder is how granite-y and sculptural the actors look before they start dancing!) When it was all over, the enthusiastic applause went on and on Tuesday night.\n\nThe same was true when the show was over, Mary Poppins proving once again that a combination of discipline and imagination produce absolutely magical results.\n\nParagraph body\n\nWhat: Disney and Cameron Mackintosh’s “Mary Poppins”\n\nBased on: the stories of P.
