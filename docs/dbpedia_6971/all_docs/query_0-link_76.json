        "text": "I’ve chosen to write this column specifically for my big brother. Apparently he feels I “butcher” some of the movies he enjoys (“Chicken Run” is still scary Kevin and I will die on that hill) so I’ve decided to pick a movie I know he loves. Not to butcher it though… I’m not THAT cruel.\n\n“Mary Poppins” is an absolute classic and features one of my favorite actresses — Julie Andrews. I’ve written about her before in my review of “The Princess Diaries” and I’m about to gush over how fantastic she is once again.\n\n“Mary Poppins” was released in 1964 by Walt Disney Pictures, directed by Robert Stevenson and composed by the Sherman Brothers.\n\nThe musical film takes place in Edwardian London where Mary Poppins (Andrews) takes a job as a nanny for Jane (Karen Dotrice) and Michael Banks (Matthew Garber) whose father believes they need an attitude adjustment.\n\nHonestly if you haven’t watched this movie I’ll be sorely disappointed in you. “Mary Poppins” is a gem and one of the first live action films Walt Disney Pictures would produce. And boy did Walt himself jump through hoops to get there.\n\nThe movie is based on the first book in a series by Australian-English writer P.L. Travers. Travers wasn’t very keen on selling the rights to her book with Disney attempting multiple times beginning in 1938. “Why would he try so hard?” you might be wondering. Because his daughter read the books and fell in love, making him promise he’d create a movie about it.\n\nI won’t get into the origins beyond that, there’s actually an entire movie about it called “Saving Mr. Banks” if you want to learn more.\n\nObviously I have to start out by praising Andrews for her performance.\n\nBeginning at the first moment you see her sitting on a cloud up high in the sky she is obviously the star of the show, and not just because she’s the headliner. Obviously her singing voice is the most memorable part about her performance.\n\nFrom “A Spoon Full of Sugar” to the fast paced “Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious” she doesn’t miss a beat. I also want to say that “Feed the Birds” is one of my absolute favorites from the soundtrack. It’s so soothing with a little bit of melancholy to it and Andrews smooth and comforting tone delivers it beautifully.\n\nAnd of course the way she balances a no-nonsense attitude with the children while also ensuring they have fun and learn a thing or two along the way is peak childcare I think. My friends who work in childcare can correct me if I’m wrong on that.\n\nI don’t think there is anyone else who could have taken on the role of the posh English nanny (no offense Emily Blunt) as successfully as her. Walt must have thought the same thing too.\n\nWhile digging through facts about the film, I discovered that Andrews was actually three months pregnant when she was first cast in the role. She initially considered turning it down because of this but Disney just said they’d wait. Imagine being so talented that an entire production will wait months for you. I sure can’t.\n\nIt was a smart move on his part too because she’d be behind three of the awards the movie would get, including Best Actress from the Academy and a Golden Globe.\n\nAndrews isn’t the only star that shines bright in this film. Dick Van Dyke also brings his own talent and charisma (and a slightly rough Cockney accent) in his role as the jack-of-all-trades Bert.\n\nNot only does he bring life to the fun loving fellow, he also took on the role of Mr. Dawes Sr., the old bank director. At first casting didn’t want to give him the role, citing his age.\n\nVan Dyke of course didn’t let that sway him, he eventually would win everyone over to earn the role. You wouldn’t even know it was him thanks to the costume and make up department and his top notch acting skills.\n\n“Mary Poppins” is definitely one of my all-time favorite films. The story line is easy to follow and you can learn some lessons while you’re at it. The combination of animation and live action was also unique for the time and quite frankly still is. Not to mention that the effects hold up pretty well for something made in the 1960s.\n\nAnd of course the soundtrack is wonderful. I’m actually listening to it right now as I write this!\n\nIf you haven’t watched it, and even if you have, you should give yourself a break from this crazy world and hop into a place full of imagination that’s “practically perfect in every way.” Even if it’s just for an hour or two.\n\n“Mary Poppins” is rated G and can be viewed on Disney+ with a subscription or rented from iTunes, YouTube, Google Play, Vudu or Amazon Prime.\n\n— — —\n\nLaura Jameson is a staff writer for The Express."
