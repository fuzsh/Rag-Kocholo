        "text": "Ronald Martinez/Getty Images\n\nLos Angeles Lakers' point guard Derek Fisher will never be confused for Magic Johnson despite the fact they both play the same position and hold the same number of NBA championships.\n\nMagic is considered to be not only one of the greatest Lakers of all time, but also arguably one of the best talents to ever grace the NBA hardwood.\n\nFisher's abilities pale in comparison to Magic's, and he will never be able to capture the public's imagination in the manner that Magic did, but Fisher has managed to carve out his own place in Lakers' lore.\n\nFisher's 9.0 points per game and 40 percent shooting from the field through the course of his career will never hold anyone in awe, but within those numbers are moments that have made Fisher a legend.\n\nWhat Lakers' fan will ever forget Fisher's return from a foot injury just before the 2001 playoffs, and the 51 percent shooting percentage from three-point range on the way to his second championship?\n\nHow about Fisher's dramatic heave with 0.4 seconds left on the clock against San Antonio in 2004? That shot didn't lead to a championship for the Lakers, but it did help them reach the Finals that year.\n\nKobe Bryant may have won the Finals MVP award in 2009, but it was a three-point shot from Fisher that sent the critical Game Four against Orlando into overtime, and it was another one in the extra period that put the game out of reach.\n\nLast season with the Lakers facing the prospect of going down 2-1 to the Boston Celtics on the road in the NBA Finals, Fisher once again emerged to save the day in what may have been the Lakers' most important game of the Finals.\n\nMost people will never forget the tense Game Seven contest that clinched the championship for the Lakers, but if it were not for Fisher's heroics in the fourth quarter of Game Three, then Game Seven may not have taken place.\n\nIt's easy to point to those instances as highlights of Fisher's career, but the intangibles and leadership Fisher brings to the Lakers are just as important.\n\nFisher is the elder statesman for Los Angeles and the only player who will stand toe-to-toe with Bryant when it comes to matters concerning the team.\n\nThe fact that Bryant listens to Fisher regardless of whether he agrees or not shows the type of respect Fisher commands, and although the relationship between the two has been tense at times, it is built on the solid foundation of numerous seasons together.\n\nIt's hard to gauge where Fisher stands in the annals of Lakers' history because most of the credit for the team's success has been given to either Bryant or Shaquille O'Neal.\n\nBryant and O'Neal will be remembered as two of the greatest players to ever compete in the NBA, and although Fisher's presence on the Lakers' championship teams was vital, it will be impossible to escape those large shadows.\n\nHowever, Fisher does own those five championships, and the integrity he has displayed throughout his career should hold some weight when comparing him to other Lakers' greats.\n\nFisher no longer possesses the quickness that made him a pesky defender, and his jumper no longer has the lift it once did, but Fisher has managed to remain a valuable member of the roster.\n\nThe arrival of Steve Blake may signal a decrease in Fisher's minutes, but it's unlikely Blake can replace the leadership, confidence, and ability to perform in clutch situations that Fisher brings.\n\nFisher may not be on the court as much for the Lakers this season, but if Los Angeles hopes to win its sixth championship in 10 years, his presence and steady hand will be as valuable as ever.\n\nI'm not sure where I would place Fisher in a discussion about the greatest players in L.A. Lakers' history, but I have no doubt that once his career has finally ended Fisher will reside among the legends of the franchise."
