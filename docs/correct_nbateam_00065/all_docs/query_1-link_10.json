        "text": "Warriors trade Derek Fisher to Jazz for Devin Brown, Keith McLeod, and Andre Owens\n\nThe long-rumored and long-awaited Derek Fisher trade has finally been completed (also see Warriors.com). For the Warriors, it's pretty much a salary dump and a way to open up some playing time for Monta Ellis. Let's hope this sets up another meaningful trade, because the newly acquired trio of Devin Brown, Keith McLeod, and Andre Owens probably won't see any playing time in a Warriors' jersey.\n\nHere's a little bit of a reality check on the trade from Ira Winderman of The Sporting News:\n\nYes, Golden State will save the $26.5 million due over the next four seasons to PG Derek Fisher, who was moved to the Jazz in a salary dump. But the Warriors gave up their top 3-point and free throw shooter after ranking 22nd and 26th in those categories last season. The Warriors' primary backup to enigmatic and injury-prone PG Baron Davis is Monta Ellis, who hurt his knee in a summer-league practice last week. . . .\n\nI've never been a fan of Derek Fisher's game (see Report Card) and the 5 year free agent contract that Chris and Rod (see Report Card) inked him to was just painfully dumb. However, Fisher is a class act and will be missed for his professionalism and dedication to the game. He always kept himself in great shape and showed up to play every night. DFish is a valuable backup point guard and isn't the reason the Warriors missed the playoffs for the 12th consecutive year. This trade isn't a basketball move. You wish guys like Adonal Foyle and Mike Dunleavy, who didn't show up to play last season would get banished to Utah, not Fish. Make no mistake, hoops-wise this trade is a step back, not a step forward.\n\nWe wish Derek Fisher all the best in Utah!\n\nPost your thoughts on the trade in the comments section and cast your vote on the right. Thumbs up or thumbs down on the Derek Fisher trade?\n\n99% of rumors never happen, but this one actually did!"
