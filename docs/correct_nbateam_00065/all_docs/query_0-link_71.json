        "text": "SALT LAKE CITY — In one good performance, the Lakers summed up exactly who they are at the moment: Not yet great.\n\nThey put forth a sometimes inspirational road effort that pushed a Utah Jazz team with the NBA’s best record to the brink Friday night, but the Lakers nevertheless wound up with a 114-108 loss.\n\n“When we win these games, that’ll be the statement,” Lakers coach Phil Jackson said. “That’s what we have to do.”\n\nJackson told his players afterward they didn’t have anything “to be ashamed of — except when they look at the rebound total.” In a battle between the NBA’s Nos. 1 (Utah) and 10 (Lakers) rebounding teams, Utah got 45 rebounds to the Lakers’ 27.\n\nIt was hardly the hardy effort the Lakers coaches asked for in what they referred to as the “trench game.”\n\nUtah outrebounded the Lakers, 16-4, in the fourth quarter. Utah also shot 55 percent in the quarter to outscore the Lakers in the fourth, 32-20, turning around the Lakers’ six-point lead after three periods.\n\nKobe Bryant (27 points) scored just two points in the fourth, and Jackson said Bryant “got tired.” Bryant said he was hoping to ride the scoring rolls Lamar Odom (26 points) and Kwame Brown (15) got on down the stretch.\n\nBut Odom pointed to his miss at the rim with 45.9 seconds left as the key play in the game, saying: “I put the blame on myself.”\n\nBryant maintained that even in defeat, his decision to subordinate himself to Odom serves a greater purpose.\n\n“It does a lot for his confidence and a lot for his experience,” Bryant said.\n\n“That’ll pay off for us in the playoffs.”\n\nBut this loss clearly stung the Lakers, with Odom firing his sweatbands away as he came off the court and Luke Walton chewing ruefully on his jersey.\n\nIt also should be noted that something simple that cost the Lakers in the playoffs last season was still a problem: pick-and-roll defense with Smush Parker at the top of the floor.\n\nParker, who also was tentative down the stretch with his shot, watched his counterpart, second-year point guard Deron Williams, take over for Utah with 11 fourth-quarter points.\n\nThat overshadowed the growth in this game for Brown (eight points in a fourth-quarter stretch of 1:35), Sasha Vujacic (eight points in 10 minutes) and Odom (19 second- half points).\n\n“We were right there,” Odom said. “They played better than us for three minutes.”\n\nVOLUNTEER GUARD\n\nThe Lakers had been 4-0 since Bryant suggested to Jackson the Lakers might be better served with Bryant moving back from wing to his old guard position in the triangle offense.\n\n“I was happy to have him do that,” Jackson said. “I thought it was important.”\n\nBryant used to ache for chances to move up to the wing spot in the offense during Jackson’s first Lakers tenure, and when Bryant played there all of last season, he posted the eighth-highest scoring average (35.4 points) in NBA history.\n\nSo offering to move back to guard was no small surrender for him.\n\n“It’s not my preference, but I just felt like it could help orchestrate things a little bit and help everybody get a better understanding of how Phil wants things to operating,” Bryant said.\n\nJackson said he didn’t foresee Bryant playing guard this season, and Bryant said: “Me neither.” But given the state of the team, they agreed on the change — and Bryant is still moving up to wing at times, depending on matchups.\n\n“We have such a great relationship that we can just talk about things like that, about the game,” Bryant said. “I can throw out suggestions. If he likes them, he likes them; if he doesn’t, he doesn’t. But we have that dialogue so we can talk about things like that. It’s pretty cool.”\n\nNOTES\n\nJackson acknowledged his vision for the team included Walton anchoring the bench unit rather than starting. Despite Walton’s fine play, Jackson left open the possibility of Vladimir Radmanovic or Ronny Turiaf eventually starting in that forward spot, depending on triangle learning and health. …\n\nJackson held out rookie Jordan Farmar (ankle) in part because of how tough an environment Utah is for young players. …\n\nThe Lakers sprung a zone on the Jazz with three minutes to play and got two three-point misses and a near turnover before the Jazz scored on a long Mehmet Okur jumper for a 105-104 lead.\n\nsans Text: lakers.1125\n\nNext\n\nNew Jersey at Lakers\n\nSunday at 6:30 p.m., FSN\n\nµ\n\ncredit Text: lakers.1125\n\nDOUGLAS C.
