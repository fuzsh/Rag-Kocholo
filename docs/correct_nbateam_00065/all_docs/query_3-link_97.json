        "text": "Derek Fisher wants to become one of the oldest players ever in the NBA.\n\nFisher indicated on Instagram that he’s interested in returning to the league as a player six months after being fired as the Knicks head coach. He added the phrase #ImNotDoneYet to a video of him doing drills on a basketball court.\n\nFisher, who started 68 games with the Warriors from 2004-06 and won five NBA titles with the Lakers, turns 42 on Sunday.\n\nBesides a coach who activated himself as a player for one game — Nat Hickey of the defunct Providence Steamrollers in 1948 — only Dikembe Mutombo, Robert Parish and Kevin Willis were more ancient when they last laced up.\n\n“On-court workouts have been part of my regimen since I played my last game,” Fisher wrote on Twitter. “If an NBA team expresses interest, I’m open to dialogue, but at the moment I have no steadfast plan to play again.”\n\nConsidering Fisher’s former coach Phil Jackson recently lamented current players “lack the skills to play the triangle” in an interview with NBA scribe Charley Rosen, the guard could have a shot somewhere."
