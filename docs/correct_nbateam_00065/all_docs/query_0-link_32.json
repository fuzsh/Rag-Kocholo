        "text": "The greatest Utah Jazz moment of the 21st century was Derek Fisher’s inspiring return in Game 2 of the 2007 Western Conference Semifinals.\n\nSteve Kerr could’ve chosen to coach the Knicks in 2014. However, Kerr spurned the Knicks for the Warriors, and that was the best career move for him.\n\nAfter years of sorrow and pain under Phil Jackson, it’s clear that he’s not what the Knicks were looking for, and it’s officially time to cut ties with him."
