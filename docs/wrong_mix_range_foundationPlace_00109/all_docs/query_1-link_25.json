What does this evolution mean for its business model, its internal organisation and its corporate culture? And in reality, how sustainable is the digital technology that is used to create a more sustainable world? These are just two of the many questions that Vlerick helps to answer.\n\nIn this case study, Michael Verveckken, Managing Director of Fujitsu Belgium, and Vlerick professor Stijn Viaene discuss the partnership.\n\nYou will learn what micro-enterprises are and what role they play in Fujitsu Belgium's digital transformation, why they opted for a research partnership, what insights this partnership has already delivered and what has been the biggest challenge so far. Additionally, you will read what recommendations Michael and Stijn have for organisations which, just like Fujitsu Belgium, are looking for a new business model to respond to the challenges of the digital era in a flexible and sustainable manner."
