As the happy medium between central air and window units, mini-split AC systems provide zoned cooling without the headache of installing ductwork. Let’s take a look at the cost of a mini split AC and how it keeps your home cool and comfy all summer long.\n\nFeatured Partners\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTHIS IS AN ADVERTISEMENT AND NOT EDITORIAL CONTENT.

The cost of a mini-split, therefore, really comes down to the cost of the AC compressor and the number and type of heads throughout your home.\n\nWall-Mounted\n\nWall-mounted mini-split heads are the most common and budget-friendly varieties. They typically sit at the top of the wall and link to an outdoor compressor. Wall mounts cost between $1,200 and $4,300 for a single-zoned system.\n\nFloor-Mounted\n\nFor between $1,300 and $3,700, homeowners can install a floor-mounted mini-split AC. These heads sit closer to the floor but still on the lower part of the wall. They are often designed to supplement other heating and cooling methods and to accommodate tall windows in older homes.\n\nCeiling Cassette\n\nMimicking the look of built-in air ducts, recessed mini splits set within a ceiling cassette is a stylish option for cooling or heating a home. Ceiling cassette mini-splits cost between $2,000 and $6,000 for a standard single system.\n\nCeiling-Mounted\n\nCeiling-mounted mini-split heads combine the perks of a ceiling cassette and a standard wall mount. Attached to the ceiling, these designs cost an average of $2,400 to $5,500 each. Not only are ceiling-mounted systems out of sight, but they also typically have the best rating for airflow throughout a space.\n\nSingle-Zone\n\nA single mini-split zone costs between $2,000 and $7,800 to install, including the outside compressor. Once you have the initial system in place, though, it costs less to add new heads and zones to the existing system.\n\nMulti-Zone\n\nBeyond the initial single-zone setup, add between $700 and $2,300 for additional zones in your house. While most compressors can handle multiple heads, very large systems leap in price when you add an outdoor compressor unit. Overall, a multi-zone system can cost upwards of $16,400 but ranges from $2,700 to $14,000 on average.\n\nTYPE COST\n\nWall-mounted\n\n$1,200 – $4,300\n\nFloor-mounted\n\n$1,300 – $3,700\n\nCeiling cassette\n\n$2,000 – $6,000\n\nCeiling-mounted\n\n$2,400 – $5,500\n\nSingle-zone\n\n$2,000 – $7,800\n\nMulti-zone\n\n$2,700 – $14,000\n\nMini Split AC Unit Installation Cost by Size\n\nThe first step to choosing the right mini-split setup for you is to figure out the best size AC for your home. Air conditioners measure their capacity in BTUs or British thermal units. This number measures how much an AC can cool the air in one hour. On average, you’ll need between 20 and 60 BTUs per square foot of your home.\n\nManufacturers also measure capacity in tons, which refers to BTUs as well. A standard 1,200-square-foot home will require about a two-ton mini-split system—or about 24,000 BTUs—which costs between $1,100 and $5,200.\n\nUNIT SIZE (BTUS) COST\n\n6,000\n\n$450 – $1,600\n\n12,000\n\n$600 – $2,700\n\n18,000\n\n$1,000 – $4,200\n\n24,000\n\n$1,100 – $5,200\n\n30,000\n\n$1,600 – $5,700\n\n36,000\n\n$1,800 – $7,300\n\n42,000\n\n$3,000 – $8,000\n\nMini Split AC Unit Installation Cost by Number of HVAC Zones\n\nA mini-split AC can separate your home into separate cooling zones. Not only does this cut down on your carbon footprint—and your utility bill—but it allows everyone in your house to set the thermostat to their comfort level. As mentioned earlier, the initial setup for a single-zone mini-split is $2,400 to $5,500. Add another $700 to $2,300 for each additional head depending on its design.\n\nNUMBER OF ZONES COST\n\n1\n\n$2,400 – $5,500\n\n2\n\n$3,100 – $7,800\n\n3\n\n$3,800 – $10,100\n\n4\n\n$4,500 – $12,400\n\n5\n\n$5,200 – $14,700\n\n6\n\n$5,900 – $17,000\n\nBrand\n\nMini-split AC brands offer a range of price ranges. You’ll also find seasonal deals and special pricing through your contractor. Always check with a range of retailers and check both unit and related installation prices.\n\nBRAND PRICE RANGE\n\nRheem\n\n$1,150 – $8,300\n\nDaikin\n\n$1,200 – $6,000\n\nPanasonic\n\n$1,500 – $3,800\n\nMitsubishi\n\n$1,700 – $7,700\n\nFujitsu\n\n$1,900 – $6,400\n\nEfficiency Rating\n\nMini-split AC costs rise with its efficiency rating, but you’ll save in the long run by increasing your home energy efficiency overall. An air conditioner has a SEER rating, or seasonal energy efficiency ratio, to note its energy usage. Homeowners who live in particularly hot climates can save energy with high SEER ratings since their unit runs more frequently. Keep in mind that the minimum SEER rating for ACs in the US is 14 as of 2023, according to the Energy Information Administration.\n\nLocation in the Home\n\nThe placement of the mini split slightly affects your bottom line as well. Units that cool large open floor plans will need more power than those cooling a small bedroom. Higher floors also typically require more energy to cool than lower ones. Chat with your AC contractor to determine the most cost-effective way to place the mini-split heads.\n\nAdditional Costs Associated With Mini Split AC Unit Installation\n\nThere are a host of ways to customize your mini-split AC setup and some costs that can sneak up in the process. Here are a few additional things to consider.\n\nUpgrades\n\nEnhance both the efficiency and appearance of your mini-split with a few upgrades. Installing a new thermostat costs between $80 and $425, though keep in mind that each mini-split head often comes with a thermostat. Add a wireless controller to change your mini-split from across the room for $50 to $300 as well.\n\nSimilar upgrades include electrical and structural updates. The price to replace an electrical panel ranges from $400 to $800. Also, a specialized bracket for your unit adds between $40 and $100.\n\nPermits\n\nInstalling a mini-split AC will occasionally require a building permit, particularly if you’re making structural changes to your home. Add between $250 and $400 for the permit depending on local laws.\n\nRemoval of Existing AC Unit\n\nIf your contractor doesn’t include removal in their price, add between $50 and $200 for the price of removing your old unit. Window units are the easiest to remove and properly dispose of while removing old compressors can cost far more.\n\nOperating Costs\n\nDetermining the exact operating cost of your AC can be tricky, but mini-split systems tend to cost less than many other designs overall. The perk of zoned cooling means that you aren’t wasting power and money on areas not in use.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTHIS IS AN ADVERTISEMENT AND NOT EDITORIAL CONTENT.

Your contractor should be trained, certified and insured. They should be able to provide customer testimonials and examples of similar projects they’ve worked on in the past. Additionally, be sure to request:\n\nA guaranteed estimate for the job\n\nThe payment terms throughout the project\n\nA predicted timeline for the work\n\nReferences from past clients or coworkers\n\nIf there are changes to the estimate, determine how this will be communicated\n\nTo arrive at the average costs in this article, we surveyed eight local and national cost databases. All averaged figures were correct at the time of publication and may be subject to change.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\n\nWhat are the disadvantages of a mini-split system?\n\nThe downsides to a mini-split AC unit are the upfront costs and relatively complicated installation. Mini-split ACs cool individual rooms, which is great for efficiency but not as ideal if you’re trying to cool an entire home regularly. Each mini-split head also requires complex maintenance throughout the year, so it’s best to have an HVAC pro on hand to ensure it’s running smoothly.\n\nHow many hours does it take to install a mini-split?\n\nInstalling a mini-split AC unit will cost between four and six hours depending on the size of the system. Contractors will need to connect an outdoor compressor to one or more evaporator heads throughout your home. The time frame lengthens up to eight hours when contractors need to make changes to your electrical panels or install recessed ceiling cassettes.\n\nHow many rooms can a mini-split cool?\n\nAn individual mini-split head cools one room, but a system with multiple zones can easily cool a whole house. The number of rooms depends on the capacity of the city, the placement of the heads and your local climate. In most cases, a single mini-split compressor can handle up to eight heads."
