We are a member of a voluntary organization called the Industrial Federation for Human Rights, Tokyo. We work together with the many member companies to promote mutual learning so that respect for human rights becomes an integral part of our corporate culture and engage in activities conducive to awareness-building from a corporate perspective.\n\nOutlineHuman Rights Day 2023Panel discussion with customers and partners to explore risks and business opportunities surrounding “Business and Human Rights in the Supply Chain.”Establishing and sustaining a culture of human rights into the futureHosted a webinar with presentations from external experts. The talk centered on the need for various approaches, including education, advocacy, and policy development at all levels of society to strengthen and sustain a culture of human rights into the future.\n\nCustomers and End Users\n\nBecause the Fujitsu Group shoulders considerable responsibility as an IT developer and supplier, we devote a great deal of effort to deepening our understanding of the potential negative impacts of the many and diverse human rights issues entailed by advanced IT such as AI, and to minimizing those impacts. This applies to areas such as data security, privacy protection, and the ethical use of data.\n\nRiskOngoing initiativesPrivacy and data security\n\nThe risk that Fujitsu customers and end users of Fujitsu products and services will not obtain appropriate informed consent when collecting, using, sharing, or otherwise processing data, resulting in a negative impact on personal privacy and on the right to data protection\n\nThe risk of personal information and data being passed to law enforcement, resulting in or being linked to human rights violations\n\nThe risk that the management and protection of the data and information of Fujitsu customers and end users of Fujitsu products and services may be exposed to external cyberattacks\n\nA Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) was appointed in FY2023 to ensure information security for the entire Group under a new information security framework\n\nWe implemented initiatives to safeguard and improve the security of customer information through our products and services\n\nInformation security\n\nInitiatives on Ethical AI\n\nThe rapid progress of AI is resulting in dramatic changes to people’s lives and the communities in which they live. While this innovative technology offers new solutions to social and environmental problems, it remains a “black box” process where people do not understand how its outcomes are achieved. Another issue is that the large volumes of data involved in that process can include inherent biases, which the technology encourages. Even when used with care, AI can lead to unforeseen consequences for people. There have been reports of cases of wrongful judgment due to misidentification by AI as well as ethical issues such as inequality of access, which can erode people’s trust in AI. This is why the Fujitsu Group considers it an essential part of its responsibility as an AI researcher, developer, provider and operator to make AI solutions that are not only powerful to improve our society, but that are also safe and secure.\n\nThe Fujitsu Group has long advocated a ‘human centric’ approach and argued that information technology should fundamentally be used to focus on, and to benefit, people. In March 2019, as a reflection of the rapid recent development of AI technologies, the Fujitsu Group formulated and announced the \"Fujitsu Group AI Commitment\". As one of the companies which carries out AI-related businesses including research, development, provision and operation activities, we aim to emphasize the importance of communication with a wide range of stakeholders in the community, including users and consumers, as we distribute the enormous value of AI to society. For that purpose, the commitment outlines our promises with customers and the community.\n\nFujitsu Group AI Commitment\n\nThe Fujitsu Group has identified the ethical risks listed below arising from the use of AI, and is formulating mitigation measures to address emerging risks that could significantly impact our future business.\n\nEmerging Risks\n\nThe Ethical Risks of Utilizing AIDescriptionAs a company that has been researching, developing, providing, and operating AI technologies since before the 1980s, Fujitsu has long asserted that information technology must be used in a human-centered manner. In recent years, there have been reports of troubling instances whereby ethical problems have arisen from the use of AI in the handling of privacy information. Examples include discrimination and unfairness due to negative outputs caused by biased training data. Such cases can undermine people’s trust in AI. Fujitsu therefore considers it an essential part of its responsibility as an AI researcher, developer, provider and operator to offer AI that is convenient, safe and secure to use.ImpactAs we see the widespread use of AI increasing with unprecedented speed, particularly in the case of generative AI, there is also a risk that users and consumers who have experienced issues with AI provided by Fujitsu may file claims for damages and thereby harm the Fujitsu Group’s reputation. In addition, the European Union's Artificial Intelligence Act (AI Act) requires developers, users, and other stakeholders to take strict action based on the level of risk that their AI systems could pose to the enjoyment of human rights. Violations could result in penalties, including fines of up to 7% of total global sales. This makes implementing appropriate risk management in the development and operation of AI systems essential. (in June 2024)Mitigating actionsThe Company established the “Fujitsu Group External Advisory Committee on AI Ethics” as a body that meets regularly and engages in ongoing dialogue with stakeholders from society. Part of this dialogue involves feedback on the “Fujitsu Group AI Commitment”, which serves as the Group’s AI ethical guidelines.\n\nThe Company also participates in international discussions on AI Ethics through its membership in AI4People and other forums. By virtue of these risk mitigating actions, Fujitsu Group management and staff can become aware of the ethical risks of AI and understand the precautions needed when researching, developing, providing, and operating AI. By minimizing the likelihood of situations that might cause inconvenience to users and customers, we can foster people’s trust in AI.\n\nAs a company that researches, develops, provides, and operates AI technologies, we aim to communicate knowledge about the rich value that AI brings, while emphasizing dialogue with a wide range of social stakeholders, including users and consumers.\n\nPromotion and Practical Application of AI Ethics\n\nAs stipulated by the policies laid down in the “Fujitsu Group AI Commitment”, the Fujitsu Group conducts education and training activities across the entire company and includes content that considers the latest as well as specific AI-related issues.\n\nBecause we believe it is crucial that C-level management recognizes the importance of AI Ethics in order to establish a corporate culture which promotes AI Ethics, the Fujitsu Group has set up the “Fujitsu Group External Advisory Committee on AI Ethics”, which comprises external experts in the field, to objectively evaluate AI Ethics initiatives in the Group. A summary of the committee’s discussions is shared with the Board of Directors Meeting, incorporating the group's efforts for AI Ethics into its corporate governance framework and allowing for ongoing review and improvement.\n\nFujitsu Establishes the Fujitsu Group External Advisory Committee on AI Ethics to Ensure the Safe and Secure Deployment of AI in Society\n\nTrustworthy AI and a Prosperous Society Created Together with the “Fujitsu Group External Advisory Committee on AI Ethics”\n\nFujitsu AI Ethics Governance\n\nFujitsu Establishes AI Ethics and Governance Office to Ensure the Safe and Secure Deployment of AI and Leading-edge Technologies in Society\n\nAI Ethics: AI Ethics from Principles to Practical Implementation - Trustworthy AI Design & Auditing\n\nFujitsu Delivers New Resource Toolkit to Offer Guidance on Ethical Impact of AI Systems\n\nAchievements in FY2023\n\nCorporate initiatives focused on AI Ethics, with management’s involvement\n\nWe held two meetings of the “Fujitsu Group External Advisory Committee on AI Ethics” to receive objective feedback on Fujitsu's ethical AI initiatives, including human rights initiatives, from external experts.\n\nGiven that AI Ethics is integral to corporate governance, we report on the above at board meetings.\n\nIntegration of AI Ethics within the Group through AI Ethics training and practice\n\nWe conducted an e-learning course on “AI Ethics” for Fujitsu Group employees in Japan; 93% of all domestic employees took part.\n\nTo prevent discrimination or injustice that may be caused by AI, specialized departments within Fujitsu conduct ethical screening on all AI business project opportunities presented to customers and implement risk mitigation measures according to the type of AI and its application.\n\nFostering Ethical AI in Society by Sharing Fujitsu's Advanced AI Ethics Initiatives\n\nAiming to raise awareness of AI Ethics among AI developers, AI users and a large number of stakeholders, and so reduce the risk of violating human rights that may be caused by AI, the “Fujitsu Group External Advisory Committee on AI Ethics” made its recommendations and Fujitsu's practices available to the public.\n\nWe published guidelines externally on the use of generative AI to help society as a whole make appropriate use of generative AI. We wanted to share information about the risks related to impartiality in generative AI and to disseminate messages of caution about the use of generative AI, including how to respond to the risk of impartiality. In particular, we also wanted to share information to users about human rights violations such as discrimination that may be caused by generative AI.\n\nWe conducted joint research with universities and gave lectures to high school students as part of our activities to raise awareness of AI Ethics and work on developing human resources through industry-academia collaboration.\n\nTracking the effectiveness of measures\n\nISO26000-based Written Surveys\n\nWe undertake written surveys of group companies in Japan and other countries based on the ISO 26000 standard to check on the status of initiatives promoting respect for human rights. In FY2022, we conducted surveys at 6 facilities and 79 global group companies to assess the progress of human rights and work practices programs with the aim of identifying problems and helping to expand such programs company-wide. We also conducted a survey of 21 overseas group companies in FY2020 investigating working hours, wages, privacy and reporting systems.\n\nResults of Fujitsu Group Internal Survey (Human Rights/ DE&I, Labor Practices)\n\nRBA Auditing\n\nThe RBA (Responsible Business Alliance) is a CSR alliance composed mainly of global electronics companies. Its purpose is to eliminate human rights abuses and environmental degradation in the global supply chain. Its Code of Conduct is a set of standards for responsible behavior that companies must observe, including respect for human rights.\n\nSince joining the RBA in 2017, the Fujitsu Group has been working both internally and with suppliers to promote responsible business practices and build responsible supply chains, including incorporating the RBA Code of Conduct into the Fujitsu Group Sustainable Procurement Policy.\n\nThe RBA Validated Audit Process (VAP) audit is an assessment by third-party auditors to ensure that an employment site is properly operated in accordance with the RBA Code of Conduct. The Fujitsu Group's server and storage facilities at Kasashima (Ishikawa) and Hobara (Fukushima) underwent a VAP audit in FY2023 and received Gold Status and Silver Status respectively, certifying them as having a safe and secure working environment with a high level of respect for workers' human rights.\n\nThe audit did identify a few non-compliances such as “Failure to inspect first aid kits at certain non-manufacturing sites” (Kasashima factory), “Failure to conduct evacuation drills at sunset” and “Some faulty Emergency lights” (Hobara factory), but remedial action has since been taken and all sites now comply with the RBA Code of Conduct.\n\nKasashima facility\n\nHobara facility (Currently: Fsas Technologies Inc.; facility located in Hobara-machi, Fukushima Prefecture)\n\nFramework for Reporting and Consulting on Human Rights Issues\n\nThe Fujitsu Group conducts its business activities worldwide in close collaboration with local communities. Working with these communities, we have established systems to engage in human rights-related consultations and information gathering both inside and outside the company, in order to listen to and understand the opinions of various parties and reduce and prevent negative human rights impacts.\n\nConsultation Service for Fujitsu Group employees in Japan ”Human Rights Consultation Service”\n\nThe Fujitsu Group has created an intranet-based system to consult with and accept input from all Fujitsu Group employees on human rights-related issues including harassment. Within Japan, Fujitsu has set up a Human Rights Consultation Service. The matters discussed are reported to the Human Rights Promotion Committee and regularly communicated to auditors, with careful consideration given to ensuring that personal information and privacy are respected. The objectives are to understand the utilization status of this consultation service and to put in place initiatives designed to prevent recurrences of any breaches.\n\nWhistle blowing platform for a wide range of stakeholders ”JaCER Engagement and Remedy Platform Contact Desk”\n\nSince November 2023, the Fujitsu Group has been participating in the Engagement and Remedy Platform, operated and provided by Japan Center for Engagement and Remedy on Business and Human Rights (JaCER), to receive complaints and reports on human rights from a wide range of stakeholders (*2). JaCER aims to provide a non-judicial platform for grievance redress and to act in a professional capacity to support and promote redress of grievances by member companies based on the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. By accepting complaints through third-party contact points, we aim to promote fairness and transparency in the handling of complaints and promote dialogue and redress more than ever before.\n\n(*2)\n\nReports by Fujitsu Group employees regarding illegal activities, illegal transactions, and other non-compliance activities, as well as reports and consultations from Fujitsu Group employees, are accepted through Fujitsu Alert, not this Platform. Consultations on human rights are available at the Human Rights Consultation Service.\n\nJaCER \"Engagement and Remedy Platform Contact Desk\"\n\nHuman Rights Initiatives in Communities\n\nQUEREMOS GRADUARNOS! (We want to graduate!) Educational support for young people living in one of the largest slums in South America (in Venezuela)\n\nFor many young people living in Petare, Venezuela, one of the largest slums in South America, studying is close to impossible, as is prioritizing education. School dropout rates are high, opportunities to turn to drugs and crime are rife, and very few young people go on to higher education.\n\nFujitsu has been supporting In Aid of the Children of Venezuela (Chamos)’s partnership with a local non-profit, Queremos Graduarnos (QG), to motivate children and young people to attend school. Chamos, in cooperation with Espacio Educa, offers weekly extracurricular classes in computer programming languages, software, and digital literacy. Fe y Alegria Maria Inmaculada College started offering the course in October 2023 and has accepted 43 young people so far.\n\n“Fujitsu’s generosity to date has given young people the chance to improve their digital literacy skills, explore computer programming and most importantly gives them a sense of agency and self-belief. We work with vulnerable communities where over 80 percent of the population live below the poverty line and the majority have no access to technology or internet connection at home. So with Fujitsu, we have been able to provide foundational skills to close the stark inequality gap in Venezuelan society, as well as introducing computer programming for students with aspirations to work in a STEM-related field.”\n\n-Mariana Siblesz de Alvarez, Chair at Chamos In Aid of the Children of Venezuela\n\nYoung people from vulnerable environments taking classes\n\nDigital literacy curriculum for Yemeni women and girls implemented by the International Rescue Committee (IRC) (in Yemen)\n\nWomen participating in the digital literacy curriculum\n\nFujitsu supports the IRC in its efforts to improve the digital literacy of women and adolescent girls. The pilot program in Khanfar, Yemen, funded through Fujitsu’s community investment fund concluded in 2023. The program provided digital literacy training to 50 women between the ages of 18 and 35, gaining valuable skills in navigating the digital space, from smartphone basics to online safety and information seeking. This opens new avenues for education, employment, and communication. The program overall helped improve access to information and opportunities as well as increase confidence and empowerment.\n\nCreating equal opportunities and work opportunities for people with disability (in India)\n\nMegumi Shimazu (then a corporate executive officer, now COO) and program participats\n\nFujitsu Consulting India (FCI), partnered with NFP organization Poona Blind Men's Association (PBMA) to assist 21 visually impaired students in their skills development journey within the field of IT, with a special focus on database management systems. The year-long program is implemented by PBMA and provides technical knowledge on database management systems and basic corporate skills such as effective communication, time management, stress management, and EQ."
