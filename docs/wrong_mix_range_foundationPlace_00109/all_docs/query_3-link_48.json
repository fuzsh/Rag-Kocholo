Students need to check the standard A Level requirements for their chosen course.\n\nThe units of broader study, enrichment activities and the Extended Project are considered to be valuable elements of the AQA Baccalaureate and we would therefore strongly encourage students to draw upon these experiences within their personal statement.\n\nFoundation year\n\nThe University recognises a number of foundation programmes as suitable for entry to this undergraduate programme - please visit the international foundation year pages of our website for details of recognised programmes, including INTO Manchester and NCUK.\n\nPearson BTEC qualifications\n\nWe consider the following BTEC Nationals for entry provided you have studied a subject relevant to the chosen course. Please contact us atÂ ugadmissions.ambs@manchester.ac.uk Â if you wish to check your eligibility.\n\nPearson BTEC Level 3 National Extended Diploma Â at grades D*D*D*\n\nPearson BTEC Level 3 National Diploma Â at grades D*D* plus grade A at A-Level\n\nPearson BTEC Level 3 National Extended Certificate Â at grade D* plus grades AA at A-Level\n\nPlease note, we do not accept General Studies as an A-Level option and we do not accept A-Level subjects which are the same as your BTEC qualification.\n\nPlease note, the National Diploma and the National Extended Certificate must be studied alongside A-Levels. We are unable to accept combinations of the BTEC qualification.\n\nLegacy BTEC qualifications (pre-2016)\n\nThe University of Manchester welcomes applications from students who have achieved legacy BTEC qualifications (pre-2016) such as the BTEC Extended Diploma, BTEC Diploma, BTEC Subsidiary Diploma, and BTEC Certificate.Â The grades required are likely to be the same or vary similar to the new BTEC qualifications (first teaching 2016, awarded 2018). Please contact us atÂ ugadmissions.ambs@manchester.ac.uk Â if you wish to check your eligibility.\n\nOCR Cambridge Technical qualifications\n\nWe consider the following Cambridge Technical qualifications from the 2016 suite for entry provided it is in a subject relevant to the chosen course and studied alongside A-Levels.

Although the Extended Project will not be included in the conditions of your offer, we strongly encourage you to provide information about the EPQ in your personal statement and at interview. A number of our academic Schools may also choose to take your performance in the EPQ into account should places be available in August for applicants who narrowly miss the entry grades for their chosen course.\n\nCore Maths\n\nThe University recognises the value of Level 3 Core Mathematics qualifications. Core Mathematics is not a compulsory element of post-16 study and as a result we will not normally include it in the conditions of any offer we make. However, if a student chooses to undertake a core mathematics qualification this may be taken into account when we consider a student's application, particularly for courses with a distinct mathematical or statistical element that does not require A Level Mathematics. Academic Schools may also choose to take a student's performance in Core Mathematics into account should places be available in August for applicants who narrowly miss the entry grades for their chosen course.\n\nWhere a course requires applicants to have at least grade 6/B or higher in GCSE Mathematics we would be likely to consider a pass in Core Mathematics at a minimum grade C or B as an alternative way to fulfil this requirement. Where an A Level in Mathematics is required then Core Mathematics will not be accepted in lieu of an A Level.\n\nA Level and GCSE Mathematics requirements for our courses vary according to subject so we advise students to contact the academic School, who will clarify whether a student's portfolio of qualifications is acceptable for entry onto the chosen course.\n\nHome-schooled applicants\n\nIf you are a student who has followed a non-standard educational route, e.g. you have been educated at home; your application will be considered against the standard entry criteria of the course for which you are applying. You will be required to demonstrate that you meet the specified academic entry requirements of the course. We will also require a reference from somebody who knows you well enough, in an official capacity, to write about you and your suitability for higher education. If you are a home schooled student and would like further information or advice please contact the academic School for your chosen course who will be able to help you.Â\n\nNon-standard educational routes\n\nMature students are some of our most well-equipped learners, bringing skills and attributes gained from work, family and other life experiences. Â Students come from a whole array of backgrounds, study every kind of course, undertake full-time and part-time learning and are motivated by career intentions as well as personal interest. Â There is no such thing as a typical mature student at Manchester.\n\nThe application process is the same as for other prospective undergraduates.Â If you require further clarification about the acceptability of the qualifications you hold please contact the academic School(s) you plan to apply to. Â Further information for mature students can be found here ( http://www.manchester.ac.uk/study/undergraduate/mature-students/ )\n\nEnglish language\n\nAll applicants to the University (from the UK and Overseas) are required to show evidence of English Language proficiency.Â The minimum English Language requirement for this course is either:\n\nGCSE/iGCSE English Language grade B/6, Â or;\n\nIELTS 6.5 overall, with no less thanÂ 6 in any individual component, or;\n\nAn acceptable equivalent qualification.\n\nFor details on acceptable equivalent qualifications to this course please see Alliance Manchester Business School'sÂ English Language information page .\n\nIf you hold English as a second language iGCSE qualification, we require you to achieve a higher grade in your iGCSE than the one stated above or to offer one of our acceptable equivalent qualifications.\n\nThe UK Visas and Immigration (UKVI) requires that every student from outside the UK and the EU must show evidence of a minimum level of English Language in order to be granted a UK visa (Tier 4 visa) to study at undergraduate or postgraduate level. This level is often referred to as the 'B2 level'. At Alliance Manchester Business School we require a higher English Language proficiency than the B2 level. Further information about the English Language policy at the University can be foundÂ here . Details on acceptable English Language tests to this course can be found on Alliance Manchester Business School'sÂ English Language information page .\n\nEnglish language test validity\n\nSome English Language test results are only valid for two years. Your English Language test report must be valid on the start date of the course.\n\nApplication and selection\n\nHow to apply\n\nApply throughÂ UCAS .\n\nAdvice to applicants\n\nMitigating circumstances may be personal or family illness, other family circumstances, change of teachers during a course, problems with school facilities or an unusual curriculum followed by your school or college. We recommend that information on mitigating circumstances that have affected or are likely to affect your academic performance will be included in the referee's report. We cannot usually take into account information that is supplied after an adverse decision has been made on an application by the admitting School. If you encounter mitigating circumstances after you have submitted your application, please inform the admissions staff in the School to which you applied as soon as possible.\n\nWhere mitigating circumstances have already been taken into account, for example by the relevant exam board, we will not be able to make further allowances.\n\nUnit grade\n\nThe University of Manchester welcomes the provision of unit grade information which, like all other available information, will form the consideration of application.\n\nA*\n\nAlliance Manchester Business School does not issue offers on the Grade A* as standard practice. It may however be taken into account at the point of confirmation to inform decisions on candidates who have narrowly missed the terms of their offer.\n\nA-levels in a native or heritage language\n\nWe consider applications holistically taking into consideration the overall educational environment. Where native langue A levels are offered we will consider them in line with other subjects that the student has undertaken.\n\nHow your application is considered\n\nPredicted Grades\n\nStrong examination results are the main factor in admitting students to our courses. We consider other information to ensure we admit students with the most outstanding potential. This is assessed within a structured framework and includes prior and predicted grades. Your referee should give realistic grade predications for all qualifications that you are currently studying at the top of their reference. If you attend a non-UK school or college that does not provide predicted grades your referee should explain this policy within their reference. Further guidance for referees is provided by UCAS (www.ucas.com).\n\nSkills, knowledge, abilities, interests\n\nWe are looking for evidence of your interest in this subject, and your commitment to studying it.\n\nInterview requirements\n\nWe do not as a rule interview applicants. However, we reserve the right to interview candidates with non-standard backgrounds, eg. Mature students and students aged under 17.\n\nReturning to education\n\nThe University encourages applications from applicants returning to education after employment or other experience. Your application will be considered against the standard entry criteria of the course to which you applied. However, we recognise that standard selection measures and procedures may not enable you to demonstrate fully your suitability for your chosen course. Where appropriate, admissions staff will seek and consider alternative evidence in order to give you equivalent consideration. Where they deem this alternative evidence to meet entry criteria fully, you will not be required to meet the standard academic entry requirements.\n\nOverseas (non-UK) applicants\n\nInternational applicants will be assessed against the standard entry criteria of the course to which they are applying.\n\nDeferrals\n\nApplications for deferred entry are considered equally to other applications up to the point of confirmation. Deferred entry is granted on the discretion of admissions staff, and is normally granted for one year only and 2 years at the maximum. Some English Language test results, such as IELTS or TOEFL, are only valid for two years from the test date.\n\nPolicy for applicants who resit their qualifications\n\nWe consider applicants who are resitting their qualifications. Whilst we do not increase our entry requirements for the first resit this would be considered for subsequent resits.\n\nPolicy for applicants who take their examinations in more than one sitting\n\nIn most circumstances, we will expect candidates to have completed three A-levels in one sitting to demonstrate that they have the ability to successfully manage a high level and volume of study that will be expected of them once at university.\n\nRe-applications\n\nIf you applied in the previous year and your application was not successful you may apply again. Your application will be considered against the standard course entry criteria for that year of entry.Â In your new application you should demonstrate how your application has improved.Â We may draw upon all information from your previous applications or any previous registrations at the University as a student when assessing your suitability for your chosen course. If you are applying for a place for the same year of entry through UCAS Extra, you should provide additional evidence of your suitability for the course. If you are applying through clearing you are required to meet the clearing requirements. In both UCAS Extra and clearing the places will be subject to availability.\n\nTransfers\n\nWe are unable to accept any transfers directly into the second or third year due to the assessment and study options followed by our first year students at Alliance Manchester Business School. All undergraduate degree programmes at Alliance Manchester Business School are full degree programmes with a September start and students must commence the programme from year one and meet our entry criteria.\n\nIf you are currently studying at The University of Manchester on an alternative course, and wish to transfer to first year study at Alliance Manchester Business School, please contactÂ ugadmissions.ambs@manchester.ac.uk Â to check your eligibility.\n\nCourse details\n\nCourse description\n\nDeveloped in collaboration with leading global blue-chip employers, this course aims to
