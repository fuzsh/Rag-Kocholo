        "text": "Our Approach to Community Activities\n\nThe Fujitsu Group contributes to local communities—who is one of the important stakeholders for us—around the world through donations, investment in organizations that address social issues, volunteer activities that leverage the skillsets of its employees, etc. in hopes of “solving global environmental issues”, “developing a digital society”, and “improving people's well-being” as well as creating a sustainable society. Furthermore, through the continued cycle of generating both financial and non-financial outputs and outcomes through such community activities and applying those to our business activities, we strive to address social challenges and create value for local communities.\n\nKey Focus Area\n\nAmong community activities, those related to the essential contributions of Materiality, namely, “solving global environmental issues”, “developing a digital society”, and “improving people's well-being”, are positioned as top priority areas. The Fujitsu Group will contribute to expanding positive impacts through reduction of GHG emissions, improving digital accessibility, conducting ICT skills training, etc.\n\nPromotion Framework\n\nCommunity Activities Promotion Office and Global Sustainability Engagement team (GSE team) are set up as the contact point in each region under the Sustainability Management Committee. The community activity promotion leader is appointed in each region in charge of planning and promoting activities according to the situations of each country. The Community Activities Promotion Office works with Japan region, and the GSE team works with other overseas regions bilaterally. Initiatives on a global scale are planned through collaboration between the Community Activities Promotion Office and GSE team to be implemented in each region. The Community Activities Promotion Office compiles the activities results in each region on a quarterly basis based on key performance indicators (KPIs), and regularly collaborates with the GSE team and each region in holding discussions aimed at improving the activities on both sides based on their actual situations. In addition to quantitatively assessing the impacts generated through these activities, the office also submits reports to the Sustainability Management Committee twice a year for discussions on how to improve these activities.\n\nInitiatives of Fujitsu Group\n\nThe Fujitsu Group promotes community activities globally as follows.\n\nEmployee-led activities\n\nEmployees take the initiatives in conducting community activities, including programs that are planned and implemented by employees on selected SDGs through idea brainstorming and communication using internal social media, support activities (pro bono) for companies, NPOs, and various organizations aimed at addressing social issues, as well as events such as lectures by diverse companies and NGO/NPO representatives and panel discussions/workshops with employees.\n\nFurthermore, we also provide educational support programs, where employees act as lecturers in discussing design thinking that Fujitsu practices in promoting its business, and problem-based learning using technology as the theme.\n\nFujitsu’s educational support programs (Japanese only)\n\nGrants to NGOs/NPOs\n\nThe Fujitsu Group implements financial aid programs for specific initiatives of NGOs and NPOs that its employees want to support, in order to realize Fujitsu’s Purpose. The co-creation among employees and NGO/NPO contributes to the realization of a sustainable society. In FY2023, financial aid was provided to seven organizations chosen from five countries through an internal recruitment process.\n\nActivity impact assessment and disclosure\n\nThe Fujitsu Group has joined the membership of Business for Societal Impact (B4SI)* since 2023, and will strive to accurately measure and disclose the results of its activities and their impacts.\n\n*\n\nAn international standard for measuring the impact of social contribution by companies\n\nSocial contribution activity through sports\n\nOver the years, the Fujitsu Group has conducted social contribution activities through sports with the mission of supporting challenges and living in harmony with local communities. We host events involving athletes of Fujitsu’s sports teams, create and distribute barrier free maps, and provide opportunities for persons with disabilities or Ukrainian refugees to attend sports events.\n\nFujitsu Sports: Initiatives aimed at achieving SDGs\n\nExamples of Activities\n\nExamples of main activities in each contribution area of Materiality in FY2023 are as follows.\n\nPlanet: Solving global environmental issues\n\nContribute to creating a future earth where both people and nature can thrive\n\n- Behavioral change towards an environmentally conscious lifestyle through using the environmental app “Green Carb0n Club” (Japan)\n\nLogo of the environmental app\n\nExhibition at the Colors, Future! Summit 2023\n\nFujitsu has developed an app called “Green Carb0n Club,” with an aim to reduce carbon emissions from communities and businesses based on a comprehensive agreement to strengthen collaboration with Kawasaki City in 2021. This app promotes behavioral change towards an environmentally conscious lifestyle.\n\nIn fiscal 2023, we examined the impact on increased and sustained environmental actions through the synchronized effects of leveraging fan communities of Kawasaki-related organizations and gamification (“Green Carb0n Farm”, a simulation game linked with the actual environmental actions*). In addition, we provided a dashboard on environmental action analysis and conducted value verification for businesses.\n\n*\n\nEnvironmental actions: voluntary environmentally conscious actions from communities and businesses, such as proactively purchasing and using ethically sourced products and services.\n\nGoing forward, we will support businesses in verifying the results on their environmental contributions and formulating environmental policies, by analyzing data collected on environmental actions with safe and secure data distribution technology. Through these initiatives, we will promote the practical implementation of Social Digital Twins* which digitally represents various information on the city and will contribute to the realization of decarbonized society.\n\n*\n\nSocial Digital Twin: A group of technologies that digitally reproduce the relationships and connections between people, goods, the economy and society to offer a simulation, prediction and decision-making environment in which to solve diverse and complex social issues.\n\nNumber of participating companies: 10\n\nNumber of participation in community events：8\n\nNumber of participants in activities：4,021 (total number of app users as of March 31, 2024)\n\nTotal number of environmental actions：3,774\n\nCO2 reduction: 106.4 t in approximately six months (equivalent to the emissions of a single private vehicle going around the Earth 20 times*)\n\n*\n\nCalculated based on data from the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism assuming the distance around the earth is approximately 40,000 km.\n\nPress release\n\nFujitsu and Kawasaki City encourage environmental engagement with app and gamification features to incentivize sustainable behavior\n\nRelevant SDGs\n\nProsperity: Developing a digital society\n\nContribute to creating a trusted digital society where global prosperity and stability are compatible\n\n- Increasing digital safety awareness and preventing fraud among the elderly (China)\n\nCommemorative photo after the workshop\n\nDonated gifts and daily goods\n\nOn the occasion of the over 2,000-year-old, time honored tradition of the Chongyang Festival, also known as Respect for the Aged Day in China, Fujitsu employees visited and hosted a workshop themed “Happy Aging” at a nursing home in Xian. The employees created learning contents and presented a skit and song to promote digital safety awareness on social media and prevent the elderly from falling victim to fraud. In addition, donations of gifts and daily goods were also made.\n\nThe event was a huge success filled with smiles from participants. The representative of the nursing home we visited commented that as more elderly are using smartphones and social media, it is very important for them to understand digital safety, and that this digital safety workshop is greatly beneficial for the participants. We will keep contributing to digital accessibility and “digital democratization” whereby anyone can independently and freely use digital technology, through events like this.\n\nNumber of employees who participated in the activity: 1,718 (includes those who donated)\n\nNumber of beneficiaries: 119\n\nRelevant SDGs\n\nPeople: Improving people's well-being\n\nContribute to improving quality of life and opportunities across society to support the well-being of people\n\n- Promoting career education through provision of virtual work experience site “WorkX”\n\nLearning site of WorkX\n\nFujitsu has developed the “WorkX Program” that allows students to experience the virtual work for free, in order to stimulate their interests in IT services, digital fields and a career in technology industry, regardless of their career or geographic location.\n\nOn the website of Springpod, the major supplier of the e-learning site, we provide pre-assignments and webinars created and recorded by Fujitsu experts of various fields. Students can practically understand how technology such as quantum computing and automation impacts society. Fujitsu employees also provide contents (including job skills and experience) that enable students to experience the company’s diverse career paths.\n\nIn 2024, we also added digital skill learning contents for all ages, explaining the value of digital skills and how to become a responsible digital citizen. We provide learning opportunities not only for students, but also for those who are unemployed, those who are considering a career change, and those who want to improve their digital skills. Through these initiatives, we will inspire people around the world and contribute to diversity in IT human resources.\n\nNumber of employees who participated in the activity: 15\n\nNumber of beneficiaries (FY2023 alone): 6,190 enrollments, 2,762 engagements, 1,126 completions (over 70% completion)\n\nNumber of beneficiaries (cumulative): 11,281 enrollments, 6,510 engagements, 2,694 completions\n\nClick here for the WorkX site\n\nRelevant SDGs\n\nFY2023 Performance\n\nThe following chart describes the expenditures for community activities at Fujitsu Group in FY2023.\n\nCommunity Activities Expenditure\n\nRatio of Employees who Participated in Community Activities\n\nFY2023: 19.8% of employees (FY2025 target: 20%)\n\nDisaster and Humanitarian Assistance\n\nThe Fujitsu Group provides support through donations to people in need of emergency assistance due to disasters and conflicts.\n\nIn FY2023, we made a donation of 16 million yen to related local governments to support reconstruction efforts in the areas affected by the 2024 Noto Peninsula Earthquake. (About support for damage caused by the 2024 Noto Peninsula Earthquake)\n\nWe also collected donations from employees, and made a matching donation of the same amount to Japan Platform, a specified nonprofit organization."
