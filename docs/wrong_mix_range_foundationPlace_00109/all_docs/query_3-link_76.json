Fujitsu fi-5950 – Quick Highlights Quick landscape 135 ppm / 270 ipm at 200 or 300 dpi (Color, Grayscale or B&W) Fast portrait 105 ppm / 210 ipm scanning speeds at 200 or 300 dpi ( details ) Outstanding mixed document handling of different sizes, shapes and colors Highly reliable for up to 100,000 sheets per day daily scanning Real-time image processing at full rated scanning speed Improved start-up times Enhanced MultiFeed recovery ( details ) Large 500 page automatic document feeder Active Stacking to keep documents neat and orderly in the output tray Inexpensive and easy to replace consumables for lower total cost of ownership ScandAll PRO 1.8 batch scanning with Scan to Microsoft SharePoint Server Kofax VRS 4.5 Professional with Enhanced Bar Code recognition ( details )\n\n4. Throughput and Productivity Quick landscape scanning speeds of 135 ppm / 270 ipm @ 200/300 dpi Improve automatic data recognition accuracy with higher resolution scanning Rated speed at 300 dots per inch (dpi) Optical Character Recognition (OCR) Bar code recognition Applications and use scenarios: Invoice processing Medical records Mortgage applications Advanced document recognition Forms processing Decrease human intervention Student records Military documents Survey responses 11” 8.5” 8.5” 11” Utilize your scanner speed to it’s fullest No longer do you have to sacrifice speed with the ability to use Automatic page rotation at rated speeds Original documents are landscape orientation Fast portrait scanning speeds of 105 ppm / 210 ipm @ 200/300 dpi Maximize document processing efficiency Most competitive scanners slow to 2/3 rd ’s rated speed when scanning 300 dpi The fi-5950 performs at rated speed in color, grayscale or black & white modes True double-sided scanning speeds\n\n5. VRS (VirtualReScan) Professional Advanced Image Processing features in hardware VRS dynamically adjusts image quality to produce perfect images Drastically reduce document preparation times and labor costs Simply place a stack of document into the document feeder and let advanced scanning intelligence improve overall efficiency Create perfect images regardless of paper size, color or document contents Automatic color detection Background smoothing Content-based rotation Intelligent blank page deletion Advanced clarity\n\n6. Intelligent MultiFeed Function Intelligent MultiFeed Function (iMFF) is the most versatile way to utilize Ultrasonic Double Feed Detection to ensure potential multifeeds are reliably detected, yet enables scanner operators the ability to efficiently capture legitimate detections such as sticky notes, taped on receipts and/or other overlapping materials. Applications and use scenarios: Medical records with bar code patient information Expense reports with taped on receipts Invoices with attached checks Random sticky notes Insurance claims with associated photos Save time * Improve efficiency * Ensure accuracy * Increase automation Simply click OK to retain image or Rescan to replace!\n\n7. In-Box Software Adobe Acrobat 9.0 Standard Hardware VRS 4.5 Professional with Enhanced Bar Code recognition Real-time hardware image enhancement ScandAll PRO 1.8 with Connect to SharePoint Batch processing scan application with Scan to SharePoint Automatic Image Quality Checker (aIQC) QuickScan Pro (Trial) Document capture scanning application TWAIN and ISIS drivers Scanner drivers and Error Recovery Guide (ERG) S-IPC Image enhancement Auto Page Rotation Auto Color Detection File Size Reduction Auto Blank Page Deletion A full suite of valuable software tools for maximum efficiency\n\n8. Paper Protection Scan width Feeding direction Overhead view Sensors detect when a fed document exceeds scan width Sensors Document Encoder Sensor Feeding direction Paper bending at the front end of the document Abnormal skew is detected to halt scanning to avoid damage to documents Paper Protection technology will automatically detect potential document jams BEFORE they happen When physical damage to original documents such as signed legal contracts, original birth/death certificates or patient information documents the Paper Protection functionality automatic monitors scanning to avoid damage to these critical original documents.\n\n9. ScandAll PRO 1.8 with Scan to SharePoint ScandAll PRO 1.8 is a batch scanning software application included on the fi-5950 setup DVD Profile Editor for simple operation Document Separation via bar code or patch code and flexible File Naming conventions Add/Insert/Replace/Delete/Check images in batch BEFORE committing to destination Can be used with TWAIN, ISIS or VRS scanner drivers 1. Scan image into ScandAll PRO as normal 2. Choose ‘Send…Microsoft SharePoint…’ from the toolbar 3. ScandAll PRO connects to your SharePoint Server 4. Choose the correct destination within SharePoint 5. Enter searchable index values for the corresponding image 6. Press the ‘Accept’ button to send the image to the server Easy Microsoft SharePoint integration Microsoft SharePoint Server\n\n10. Dental Records with Labels & Photos (Random patterns) Labels and Random Photos example Ideally these example Dental Insurance forms would have been printed with the Dentist’s office address but assume this area was not printed or they had moved addresses. Printing these forms is expensive and not wise to waste these documents Before & after photos Dr. Scott Steiner License #A287312 1255 E. Arques Ave 408-555-1212 Sunnyvale, CA 94085 The Ultrasonic Multifeed Detection has been configured to not detect multifeeds in the area where the address sticker is located, while still detecting multifeeds in the rest of the left Ultrasonic Sensor area. For the photographs, they could cover critical data underneath where attached to the page so we want the operator to verify this at scan time\n\n11. Electrocardiogram (ECG, EKG) Auto mode 1 (Bypass by combination) The electrocardiogram (ECG, EKG) is used extensively in the diagnosis of heart disease, from congenital heart disease in infants to myocardial infarction and myocarditis in adults. Several different types of electrocardiogram exist . Meanwhile on the top, some middle portions and the bottom of this page Ultrasonic Detection would still reliably catch an unintentional multifeed (sticky note, etc.) Fixed format of three EKG strips always taped to pages to be set to ignore intentional overlapping items\n\n12.
