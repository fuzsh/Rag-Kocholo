        "text": "FUJITSU Career Ownership Program（FCOP）\n\nFCOP is a support program to help each Fujitsu employee to realize a fulfilling career while exercising ownership over their own careers.\n\nAs one example of FCOP in action, about 25% of our employees in Japan participate in the Career Cafe, a place for peers of the same generation to share ideas and receive new career inspiration. We also introduced a Career Ownership Assessment in FY2022 to determine the current level of an employee’s career ownership. One out of every five employees now utilizes this assessment.\n\nFrom April 2023, we also introduced LinkedIn Learning (*1) as a global learning platform. More than 80% of employees use this platform, which has fostered a culture of self-directed learning.\n\nAdditionally, some one in 10 employees in Japan have been transferred through our in-house posting system as part of their own efforts in working toward desired positions. The introduction of in-house internships and internal side jobs also provides support for employees taking on new challenges, providing opportunities to gain various experiences that extend beyond our organization.\n\nOver 1,000 employees annually use our counselling system with in-house career counsellors. To further encourage career dialogue, we also provide mentoring opportunities with senior employees from other departments and have expanded training programs for supervisors to facilitate their skills for one-on-one career dialogues with employees.\n\nIn these ways, the various FCOP programs have steadily increased employees’ awareness, understanding, and practice of career ownership.\n\n(*1)\n\nLinkedIn is a trademark or registered trademark of LinkedIn Corporation.\n\nFujitsu Innovation Circuit\n\nThe Fujitsu Innovation Circuit is a program that seeks to make Fujitsu a place where anyone can rise to a challenge, where learning from challenges is a practical attitude, and where supporting those who are taking on challenges is a natural thing, all with the goal of creating “intrapreneurs” (in-house entrepreneurs) who will lead Fujitsu into the future and create the world we envision with Uvance.\n\nThe Academy and Challenge programs, begun in November 2021, are designed to foster intrapreneurs through the learning and practice of entrepreneurship. These programs are under the full supervision of Yasuhiro Yamakawa, Associate Professor of Entrepreneurship at Babson College in the United States. Through five terms of the Academy program, 967 participants have learned an entrepreneurial mindset, while the Challenge program has generated 35 ideas through three terms. In July 2022, Fujitsu Launchpad was established to incubate the business ideas coming out of the Challenge program, further enhancing our system for new business creation, and four projects are moving toward commercialization as of the start of FY2024.\n\nGlobal FDE\n\nGlobal Fujitsu Distinguished Engineers (below, \"Global FDEs\") are the technological face of Fujitsu, spearheading solutions to our customers' business challenges by leveraging their superior technological capabilities. Recognized as the pinnacle of Fujitsu Group engineers by common global standards, they participate in the formulation of our business and technology strategies.\n\nWe have established the seven certification areas of networks, cybersecurity, AI, data, computing, hybrid IT and project management, which are the future key technology areas of our new business. As of FY2023, a total of 33 Global FDEs were certified.\n\nFurthermore, we will position it as a benefit and career path for engineers who contribute to business strategy and customer value creation in conjunction with a job-based personnel system.\n\nReskilling\n\nFujitsu has implemented reskilling programs for targeted roles in order to ensure the necessary personnel to expand our Business Application business, one of the core technology platforms that support cross-industry efforts to realize Fujitsu Uvance.\n\nIn particular, we have augmented our domestic resources in Japan for SAP, ServiceNow, and Salesforce by reskilling target personnel over a period of about six months through education and on-the-job training. To date, several hundred people have participated, contributing to the deployment of immediate assets in worksite divisions. In fiscal 2023, the program was conducted 4 times with a total of 132 employees."
