        "text": "TOKYO, JAPAN and PALO ALTO, CA--(Marketwired - August 28, 2017) - Fujitsu Limited and VMware, Inc. (NYSE: VMW) today announced that they have expanded their global partnership in cloud to empower the digital transformations of enterprises.\n\nFujitsu plans to partner with VMware to deliver VMware cloud solutions as a service on the Fujitsu Cloud Service, K5 (*1). Fujitsu is scheduled to commence worldwide rollout in the fourth quarter of its fiscal 2017 (January - March 2018). Fujitsu and VMware plan to expand solutions coverage to VMware Cloud Foundation™ as well.\n\nVMware Cloud Foundation™ is the next-generation VMware cloud infrastructure platform that provides a complete set of software-defined compute (VMware vSphere®), storage (VMware vSAN™), network and security services (VMware NSX®) in a single, integrated stack that is easy to operate thanks to the built-in lifecycle management automation (VMware SDDC Manager) and is ready for traditional and cloud native applications.\n\nIn recent years, there has been an increasing demand for the extension of on-premises resources to the public cloud using VMware's virtualization technology, in addition to the creation of hybrid environments that combine on-premises with the public cloud. To meet such demand, Fujitsu is expanding its collaboration with VMware.\n\nThese services will be able to empower mutual customers operating VMware software on-premises to create an optimal hybrid environment centered on K5 cloud services, while limiting the risks associated with changes in system environments. These cloud services will be offered as part of K5's service offering enabling customers to make use of the wider K5 portfolio, such as OpenStack based IaaS, Cloud Foundry based PaaS, IoT platform and an AI service platform. On top of this, Fujitsu will offer services that comprehensively support customers using VMware virtualization technology in everything from validating a system environment to migrating systems to K5.\n\nIn addition, with Fujitsu Integrated System PRIMEFLEX (*2), a vertically integrated virtualized cloud platform for private cloud systems, mutual customers will be able to rapidly create a seamless hybrid environment combining the private cloud using VMware virtualization technology with the public cloud.\n\nMasahiro Ota, Head of the Digital Business Platform Unit, Fujitsu Limited\n\n\"Customers will be able to migrate their on-premises VMware environment to cloud services quickly with minimal risk, while reducing costs. I believe that customers can add value to their business by converting cloud applications into native cloud services as necessary, or making them more sophisticated by combining them with other cloud services. This partnership expansion is extremely meaningful, as it was essential to incorporate VMware technology into K5 in order to help mutual customers achieve digital transformation.\"\n\nAjay Patel, Senior Vice President, Cloud Provider Software Business Unit, VMware\n\n\"Fujitsu and VMware share a common vision for accelerating digital transformations for our mutual customers. This collaboration with Fujitsu has been very successful, and we're pleased to expand our relationship so organizations will be able to quickly deploy VMware software-defined solutions to Fujitsu K5 Cloud, or to a hybrid cloud environment, with all the sophisticated workload automation they have within their own data centers.\"\n\nGlossary and Notes\n\n1. K5: Cloud Service K5 is Fujitsu's global cloud platform, currently deployed 9 regions, that combines IaaS and PaaS offerings for customers. Provides customers with a range of service options and deployment modes including Public Cloud, Virtual Private Cloud, Dedicated Cloud Hosted at Fujitsu and Dedicated Cloud Hosted at the Customer Site.\n\n2. PRIMEFLEX: PRIMEFLEX is a pre-defined, pre-integrated and pre-tested combination of servers, storage, network connectivity and software. PRIMEFLEX solutions are delivered ready-to-run, or as customizable reference architectures, which can be easily adjusted to customer-specific requirements.\n\nRelated Links\n\nFujitsu and VMware Expand Global Collaboration in the Cloud\n\n(Press release, November 10, 2015):\n\nhttp://www.fujitsu.com/global/about/resources/news/press-releases/2015/1110-01.html\n\nAbout Fujitsu\n\nFujitsu is the leading Japanese information and communication technology (ICT) company, offering a full range of technology products, solutions, and services.
