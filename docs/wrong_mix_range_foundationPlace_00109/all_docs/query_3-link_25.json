        "text": "Accelerate Your Transformation While Maintaining a Consistent Customer Experience\n\nJust as every company is unique, so are its outsourcing needs and services strategy. But one similarity remains the same across organizations seeking to outsource: You want to ensure the customer experience is seamless and that your customers receive the same level of service quality — or even better — that they’ve come to expect from your organization.\n\nDiscover how companies of different sizes and industries around the globe are outsourcing services to reinforce their operations, refocus on business transformation and regain the freedom to drive better outcomes — for themselves and their customers.\n\nWhat Can Outsourcing Services Mean for Your Business?\n\nMaintain Your Commitments While Simplifying Operations\n\nWhen you outsource service operations, you’re trusting both your reputation and your customers’ outcomes to someone else, which means it’s essential that they can maintain service delivery quality, represent your company adequately and provide a seamless experience for your customers.\n\nWith the right outsourcing partner — who deservedly earns your trust — you can more efficiently uphold your commitment to your customers at a lower cost while also taking advantage of a renewed focus on your key business drivers and initiatives.\n\nThe Top 10 Benefits of Outsourcing Services\n\nBy extending or outsourcing your technology service capabilities to a single trusted partner, you regain resources, time and funds to dedicate to your core initiatives and innovation, ultimately boosting your competitive advantage. Depending which capabilities you entrust to a services partner, you can expect these 10 outsourcing benefits — and more:\n\nExtended global reach and scalability\n\nIncreased supply chain flexibility\n\nDeeper network and relationships\n\nExpanded integration capacity\n\nA consistent customer experience\n\nMulti-vendor field service coverage\n\nMore opportunities for revenue\n\nCircular economy support\n\nEnhanced brand experience and loyalty\n\nFreedom to focus on what matters most\n\nOutsourcing technology services empowers you to reimagine where your business can go and how much sharper your focus on key digital transformation initiatives could be.\n\nPart 1: Fujitsu America, Inc.\n\nFinding a New Home for Legacy Solutions and Workforce\n\nFujitsu America, Inc. decided to shift its business objectives and transition to focus exclusively on core digital offerings. In doing so, the company was moving away from selling platform products and retail solutions and therefore needed a new strategy for its Technical Maintenance Services (TMS) business, including multi-vendor Retail Managed Services and Product Related Services. They elicited a competitive request for proposal process to find a partner who could manage the TMS business while also ensuring continuity and a seamless experience for those customers.\n\nThe Seamless Transitioning of Resources and Services\n\nUltimately, Fujitsu America, Inc. selected Shyft as its sole outsource service provider for the TMS business, and thus began the transition of key integration services, multi-vendor field services and approximately 300 TMS service and support professionals to Shyft.\n\nAdditionally, as part of this agreement, Shyft acquired certain repair capabilities that Fujitsu had previously outsourced to a different company.\n\nConsistent Experience and Increased Field Service Footprint\n\nBy transitioning the TMS business and leveraging Shyft as its single outsourcing partner, Fujitsu America, Inc. was able to:\n\nIncrease its focus on business transformation\n\nReduce certain costs and complexities\n\nContinue providing a consistent, high-quality customer experience\n\nAdditionally, adding hundreds of TMS team members to the Shyft organization expanded Shyft’s field coverage to 99% of the US and Canada population, significantly increasing field coverage for customers in those regions. Having more technicians in more locations means Shyft customers benefit from faster response times to service requests, with same-day response in many areas.\n\nPart 2: Fujitsu Denmark\n\nThe Obvious Choice for Outsourcing Services\n\nSoon after the Shyft–Fujitsu America, Inc. relationship took off, the partnership expanded into Europe. Fujitsu Denmark wanted to increase its focus on growth in its primary business areas, including cloud, IT security and software-as-a-service (SaaS) solutions. But key capital and management resources were already dedicated to other endeavors.\n\nNaturally, seeing the success of the US and Canada agreement, the Fujitsu leaders in Denmark followed suit of their North American counterparts by outsourcing the Fujitsu Denmark TMS business to Shyft. Along with these field services, more than a dozen Denmark TMS professionals also transitioned to join the Shyft team.\n\nOffering field services through an outsourced partner enabled Fujitsu Denmark to regain resources, time and energy to focus on its core business initiatives and strategic growth areas.\n\nShift in Go-to-Market Strategy\n\nFrom the first mass-produced mechanical pencil to cutting-edge devices for the home and office, Sharp Electronics has a strong history of engineering solutions that push the envelope of technological innovation. When the company needed to transform its go-to-market strategy, the leaders at Sharp knew they needed a partner with the right experience and expertise to help ease the transformation and continue putting the customer first — both end-users and Sharp’s dealer community.\n\nA Partnership That Evolves With the Times\n\nIn addition to transforming its go-to-market strategy, Sharp’s initiative to find a partner was driven by other factors as well, including issues with lead time reliability and length​, limited ETA visibility and order status tracking​, damaged goods upon arrival and a lack of access to third-party IT products.\n\nIn 2014, Sharp started outsourcing its supply chain to Shyft Global Services utilizing Shyft’s 3PL supply chain model. The Shyft team was able to:\n\nReduce fulfillment management from three entities to one​\n\nIncrease warehouses from two to five\n\nImprove geographic coverage​\n\nSimplify order status tracking\n\nToday, as both companies continue to evolve Shyft provides a much broader portfolio of services to Sharp beyond 3PL supply chain operations, including Vendor Managed Inventory (VMI) and fulfillment services to Sharp’s network of over 400 dealers around the US.\n\nDelivering a Simplified, Integrated Solution\n\nBy partnering with Shyft, Sharp was able to dedicate more resources to its core initiatives and drivers while also bringing together technologies and services across all platforms as a simplified, integrated solution for customers. On top of these benefits, Sharp has received awards from the Business Technology Association related to its distribution performance, product line performance and corporate support.\n\nLimits in Bandwidth and Budget Mean Limited Insights\n\nFrom global enterprises and sports leagues to small towns and college campuses, Extreme Networks has a variety of customers whose networking needs can vary, but largely remain the same in the necessity of agility. Extreme knew customers were buying its software solutions, but due to bandwidth and budget limits, they didn’t know exactly how — or how much — customers were using the solutions. Additionally, Extreme wanted to increase its focus on cloud subscription renewals, particularly across smaller accounts.\n\nDedicated, White-Label Customer Management Services\n\nBuilding on an existing distribution relationship with TD SYNNEX, Extreme engaged the customer management services team of TD SYNNEX’s service organization, Shyft Global Services. Working as a white-label extension of Extreme, a dedicated Shyft team contacted Extreme customers to gather vital information about their onboarding and product experiences and also to educate them regarding key product features they were unfamiliar with.\n\nAdditionally, Shyft contacted smaller accounts and end users regarding cloud subscription renewals. The team helped Extreme uncover a gap in the renewal process that led to the launch of a new renewal automation portal, driving revenue retention efforts and preventing renewal quote issues.\n\nDriving Customer Success Beyond the Sale\n\nThe rich information Shyft gathered from these customer conversations led to valuable insights that Extreme was able to feed back to its product marketing and product lifecycle management teams. This led to product adjustments based on customer feedback as well as improvements in customer onboarding and renewal processes. Extreme also created a dedicated customer success organization to provide additional support to customer experience initiatives and continue driving success beyond the sale.\n\nStaying Focused on Core Business Initiatives\n\nThousands of customers around the world rely on the next-gen data management capabilities Cohesity offers to protect and simplify the management of their data. To stay focused on its core business of software development and innovation, Cohesity works with a robust partner ecosystem. And to offer a complete solution — including hardware and professional services — but to avoid investing in a large services infrastructure, the company needed a partner who could provide installation and implementation services globally.\n\nInstallation, Implementation, Maintenance and More\n\nCohesity leveraged Shyft Global Services to grow its footprint and scale services up or down. Cohesity partners with Shyft to deliver installation and implementation services globally and manage Cohesity’s advanced services and delivery capabilities to configure data protection services for customer workloads more quickly.\n\nShyft also provides onsite hardware maintenance services, including next-business-day and four-hour support options. Shyft’s 24x7x365 Global Technical Assistance Center manages cases and field resource deployment on a global scale as a white-label service.\n\nIn addition to professional services, Cohesity expanded its partnership with Shyft to offer a training and certification program to amplify the technology support offered throughout their ecosystem. The program enables the larger Cohesity partner community to install and configure Cohesity solutions and then put them into operation.\n\nIncreased Service Delivery Reach and Enhanced Partner Opportunities\n\nLeveraging an outsourced service provider allows Cohesity to deliver on the support their customers expect while prioritizing internal resources toward product development and business growth. The partnership further enables Cohesity’s partners to establish or build their Cohesity practice and expand their global services reach.\n\nGoing Software-Centric in a Changing World\n\nSilk (formerly known as Kaminario) was one of the first companies in the enterprise segment to add and deploy a software-defined model in addition to its hardware and other services. But selling hardware as a small company had its challenges, and Silk decided that to best meet evolving customer demands, it needed to move away from the hardware business and fully transform to a software-centric business model.\n\nHowever, while their main focus was going to be software, they still wanted to provide a fully integrated solution — and to do so on a global scale — so they knew they’d need a strong partner they could trust like their own team to handle the hardware component of their business.\n\nA Scalable Services Solution That Spans Regions\n\nSilk needed a partner who had market presence, the right relationships with vendors, financial support and, of course, service capabilities — all of which they found in Shyft Global Services.\n\nThe partnership started as a hardware support model and blossomed into a full suite of global services, including supply chain management, integration, hardware installation and more, ultimately enabling Silk to provide an integrated solution to its customers across multiple platforms, capacities and global regions.\n\nOperation Get Out of Hardware: A Liberating Experience\n\nPartnering with Shyft enabled Silk to offer a simplified solution through a single provider and narrow its focus on software without disrupting the overall customer experience. Additionally, outsourcing led to expansion in Europe and the Asia-Pacific region for Silk and freed up capital expenditures (CapEx) to reinvest into pre-sales and marketing.\n\nSilk’s CTO has called the company’s transition away from the hardware business a “liberating experience.” It enabled them to take a step back and realign with the needs and goals of their customers to then better serve them with the software data services they need.\n\nThe Domino Effect of Long Lead Times\n\nData is invaluable in nearly every facet of business, a notion that Quantum is quite familiar with. The data storage and management company provides its customers with software, services and solutions that help them store, protect, manage and enrich their data so they can easily extract insights from it for decades to come.\n\nSome of Quantum’s solutions are created using products from a specific original equipment manufacturer (OEM), but in buying directly from that OEM supplier, Quantum faced long lead times because of international shipping, which greatly impacted the customer experience. Additionally, Quantum faced challenges around revenue cycles, inventory management and forecasting product needs.\n\nDelivering Solutions to Customers Faster\n\nQuantum needed the product availability and integration capacity to configure and ship data management systems in a timely manner. Building upon a distribution partnership with TD SYNNEX, Quantum began partnering with the services side of the business: Shyft Global Services. Shyft had the agile processes, service capabilities and centralized and localized integration and logistics centers that Quantum needed to optimize its supply chain and get its systems to customers faster.\n\nThe Domino Effect of a Powerful Services Partnership\n\nShyft’s physical space and robust management systems helped Quantum attain faster build and ship times. Assembly lead times were slashed from three-plus months to only a matter of days. Quantum also benefited from better forecasting and inventory management, increased integration flexibility, more configuration capabilities, reverse logistics expansion and overall simplified operations — all while maintaining a great customer experience.\n\nSimplifying the Delivery of Next-Generation Solutions\n\nFor assistance with data center modernization, hybrid cloud implementation and cybersecurity, including zero-trust and next-generation, advanced enterprise networking, many US government agencies often turn to CTG Federal for each of these critical areas.\n\nAs an SBA-certified small business, CTG Federal specializes in designing and implementing next-generation solutions that work within customers’ existing data centers and help save time and money. But building and delivering fully integrated solutions to the end customer can be a lengthy and complex process, including managing multiple technology components from distinct vendors who each have unique supply chain and logistics processes. To simplify and streamline the solution integration process, CTG Federal opted to find an experienced partner.\n\nPlug-In Ready Solutions With Multiple Components from Multiple Vendors\n\nThere are two ways to approach solution delivery: Either complete it prior to the installation or do everything entirely on site. Completing integration prior to onsite arrival means there’s less disruption at the installation site and that end customers can be up and running more quickly. To handle these integration needs — including multi-vendor solution assembly, pre-installation testing, pre-configuration and custom packaging — CTG Federal found a partner in Shyft Global Services. Shyft’s integration team helps CTG Federal scale the delivery of complete multi-vendor solutions that can be precisely tailored to customer needs.\n\nStreamlined Integration, Increased Savings and Enhanced Focus on Solutions\n\nBy partnering with Shyft, CTG Federal streamlined solution integration, lowered overall operating costs and was able to stay focused on designing and fine-tuning solutions that solve complex challenges for its customers.\n\nThis approach to integration has been a successful one, as exemplified by CTG Federal’s well-deserved awards, including Cohesity’s Federal Partner of the Year award in 2021 and the NetApp Civilian Region Partner of the Year and Civilian Region Innovation awards in 2020. CTG Federal also earned a top-10 spot on Cisco’s Data Center Solutions Providers for US Federal. CTG Federal is listed on CRN’s Tech Elite 250 and has been a Great Place to Work–Certified™ employer for three years in a row.\n\nGrowth Uncovers Gaps in Resources and Infrastructure\n\nAHEAD weaves together cloud infrastructure, intelligent operations and modern applications with the goal of helping enterprises navigate their digital transformation journeys. To get to where they are today, AHEAD’s business grew precipitously over the span of 15 years to offer more solutions and services to meet evolving customer demands. But that growth unveiled certain gaps in resources and infrastructure, which meant some solutions couldn’t scale as large and as quickly as AHEAD would have wanted.\n\nStrategic Partnership Expansion to Include Services\n\nAHEAD took on services in several areas and found partners to fulfill other areas where they didn’t have the depth. AHEAD’s relationship with TD SYNNEX began in 2010 as a distribution partnership, and then the management team decided to leverage TD SYNNEX's services side of the business — Shyft Global Services — for integration and deployment services. The expansion came naturally, as Shyft already had the capabilities, footprint and experience in building the integrated solutions AHEAD wanted to offer its customers.\n\nMore Opportunity, Flexibility, Growth and Innovation\n\nToday, AHEAD partners with Shyft for a variety of services for different customers, including plug-in ready pod stack integration, firmware updates, stocking based on forecasted needs, low-level configurations, custom packaging and much more.\n\nPartnering with Shyft to offer integration and deployment services at scale has enabled AHEAD to continue growing, focus more on innovation and take advantage of increased flexibility, efficiency and expertise to serve its customers with excellence.\n\nAdaptability is Essential in an Industry Defined by Change\n\nLenovo’s story has always been about shaping computing intelligence to create a better world. Today, its vision is to develop smarter technology for all by delivering a portfolio of products, solutions, software and services that people, communities and businesses need to fulfill their potential. To accelerate sales, Lenovo wanted to team up with a service provider who had technology and channel partner expertise as well as truly global capabilities to ensure scalability and multilingual support in over 180 markets.\n\n“Initially, we needed telesales professionals to reach out to prospective partners, but we also wanted to engage with a company that could help us achieve much grander goals over time,” said Fabio Vieira, Sales Leader, NA Channel Sales at Lenovo.\n\nDeveloping a Services Partnership for Longevity and Success\n\nBuilding upon its existing global product distribution relationship with TD SYNNEX, Lenovo engaged the company to help them further expand their sales capabilities in 2010 via the services division of TD SYNNEX — Shyft Global Services. After a successful run with outsourced telesales services from Shyft, the partnership expanded even further to include additional customer management services, such as a fully dedicated inside sales organization and a channel partner concierge program, giving Lenovo a powerful marketing and acquisition engine to complement its own.\n\nCustomer Management Services for Evolving Go-to-Market Strategies\n\nWhat initially started as a 12-person telesales unit transformed into “Lenovo Partner Sales (LPS),” a 190+ person powerhouse that is fully engaged in Lenovo’s success across its entire product portfolio and continually pilots new programs to accelerate Lenovo’s growth. With product distribution and global customer management services in good hands, Lenovo is empowered to make better-informed business decisions and more easily focus on strategy, core portfolio development and its aspiration to “deliver smarter technology for all.”\n\nHigh-Quality Product Design Calls for High-Quality Product Repair\n\nData holds infinite promise in any industry, but it can be challenging to manage and secure across systems and silos. Cohesity helps companies solve these challenges with AI-powered data security and management solutions delivered via a comprehensive platform that brings an array of data services together in one place. As a company that prides itself on well-designed, high-quality products, Cohesity found itself needing an equally high-quality and sustainable solution for products approaching end of life. Timely depot repair services are essential to customer satisfaction and minimizing downtime, but rather than building this costly infrastructure in house, Cohesity sought out an expert outsourcing partner.\n\nMutual Commitment to Growth and Sustainability\n\nThe Cohesity-Shyft repair program and outsourcing partnership began in 2019 in a state-of-the-art service facility in Roseville, California, which houses 200+ engineers, technicians and repair service experts — all of which joined Shyft as part of its 2024 acquisition of Cokeva, Inc. With a foundation that rests on trust, quality, expertise and sustainability, the Cohesity-Shyft repair partnership includes several core repair capabilities: inventory management, global logistics, component-level diagnosis and repair, failure detection and root cause analysis, parts harvesting, recycling and additional repair/testing processes and circular economy practices.\n\nDeep Trust and Cohesiveness Lead to Partnership Evolution\n\nPartnering with Shyft to deliver depot repair services at scale gives Cohesity confidence that its customers are in good hands, enabling the team to focus more deeply on innovation, product development and business growth. With Shyft providing engineering and technical skills, global inventory management expertise and sustainability practices, Cohesity maintains its competitive edge while meeting its customers’ high standards. The overall result: improved quality, lower costs, better visibility and reliability, faster turnaround times and more growth opportunities — including a European expansion. The combination of trust, high-quality repairs and sustainability embedded into the fabric of this partnership makes it one that will stand the test of time."
