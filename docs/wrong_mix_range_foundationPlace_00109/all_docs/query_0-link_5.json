Daisy Systems puts 80386 work latest engineering workstations MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. Promoting standard architecture key selling point, Daisy Systems Corp. last week an- nounced two computer-aided engineering workstations based Intel Corp.’s 80386 microprocessor. The workstations both based IBM Personal Computer AT-compatible systems that Daisy purchases from Intel come with Dnix, Daisy’s proprietary version Microsoft Corp.’s Xenix oper- ating system. The lower end workstation runs Microsoft Corp. MS-DOS op- tion, but the high-end system does not. According the company, the work- stations support the full range Daisy computer-aided engineering and design applications running under Dnix, such analog and digital simulation, physical MARCH 1987 modeling and schematic capture. When configured with Daisy’s Ethernet-based local-area network (LAN), the worksta- tions can share single distributed data base. Prices begin $20,000 for the Per- sonal Logician 386 and $50,000 for the Logician 386. The lower priced worksta- tion includes 2.5M bytes random-ac- cess memory (RAM), 1.2M-byte floppy disk drive, hard disk drive, Intel 80287 math coprocessor and IBM Enhanced Graphics Adapter.
