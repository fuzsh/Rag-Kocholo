I'm looking for fujitsu COBOL 3 or 4. According to the website of NetCobol, it was delivered with some old books.

If you know some titles of those books, I can search for them and buy them.

(I already found COBOL for Dummies, but that book is unavailble for sending to my country (Belgium))

Many thanks,

Yvan
