Abstract

This history of church-state relations in the Commonwealth of Virginia date back to Thomas Jefferson and James Madison. Efforts by Jefferson and others to disestablish the state church may be likened to an army conquering a foreign enemy. The state established church was viewed as a remnant of the British government. Disestablishment was considered to be part of the ongoing Revolution. As this article will show, the methods of disestablishment included prohibiting the incorporation of churches, confiscating property, and limiting the amount of real and personal property that churches may own.
