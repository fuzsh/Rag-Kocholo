        "text": "The intersection of technology and journalism has been a turbulent journey, marked by a series of challenges that have significantly impacted the media landscape. From the disruption caused by Facebook to the decimation of classified ad revenue on Craigslist, the industry has weathered numerous storms. But can it survive this one? Charlie Munger's funding of the Daily Journal further reshaped publisher profits, diverting legal notice revenue away from traditional sources. Facebook and Google, siphoned off Main Street ad dollars, leaving traditional publishers grappling with the aftermath. Even Apple and Netflix ventured into the fray, attempting to redefine news distribution and luring investigative reporters into the realm of screenwriting. What ensued was a chaotic aftermath, with Silicon Valley governments and hedge fund-owned newspapers strategically repurposing the last bastions of journalism, transforming reporters into Public Information Officers (PIOs) or government spokespersons. This shift has undeniably eroded the foundations of a free press. Now, comes Free Press Alamo 2.0, the battleground shifts to the issue of AI and journalism, a confrontation set to play out in the courts. While skepticism towards the treatment of journalists and publishers in state courts prevails, the federal courts have historically upheld the pillars of democracy and the free press. However, the emergence of AI presents a new challenge that demands attention. In 2024, a pivotal case will unfold in a federal court in New York, pitting titans from The New York Times against Microsoft. This case transcends mere legal intricacies; it is a linchpin for democracy and the free press that sustains it. As this legal saga unfolds, my hope is that news outlets, regardless of size or ownership structure, remain vigilant observers. The stakes are higher than ever, eclipsing even the cases involving former President Trump. This case has far-reaching implications, touching every facet of politics, race, gender, religion, association, and humanity. In a landscape where technology threatens to wrest control of the creative journalism process, draining the financial resources essential for its survival, we stand to lose more than just an industry. Our humanity, democracy, and dignity are at risk of succumbing to the influence of programmers and coders who, with AI, seek to claim the mantle of newsgathering—mirroring the past claims of Google, Facebook, and Netflix as publishers, sans the responsibilities. The battle for the soul of journalism is underway, and its outcome will shape the future of our collective information landscape, and our Democracy. Man do I miss print! Time to unplug Silicon Valley before HAL comes back as a publisher.\n\nThe lobbying effort against Buffy Wicks’ California Journalism Preservation Act (#CJPA) ironically proves why we need to preserve the news media. Here’s what I know: Local journalism is struggling due to changing consumer habits and the media industry's own decisions, such as the shift to free classifieds on platforms like Craigslist, which undercut traditional revenue models. These outlets have faced challenges in adapting and monetizing content in the digital age. However, journalism remains essential for democracy, providing vital news stories, investigative reporting, and accountability. The content produced by the news media remains valuable—so much so that social and digital platforms use it to attract users. Right now, tech industry platforms like Facebook and Google share news content and sell ads alongside it, without compensating the creators of that content. The tech industry argues that the CJPA is an attempt to subsidize the traditional newspaper industry at the expense of digital businesses that drive traffic to publications, especially smaller newsrooms and local publishers. But this is simply not true. The real issue is that these platforms are profiting from content they didn’t create. Imagine if ABC aired episodes of CBS's CSI or NBC's Law & Order, sold ads during the broadcasts, and pocketed all the profits without paying CBS or NBC. That's essentially what happens when platforms share news content—they generate revenue from content without compensating the news organizations that produced it. The claim that CJPA is a subsidy for traditional newspapers ignores the fact that these platforms rely on journalism to engage users and keep them on their sites. Far from being a subsidy, this bill is about ensuring fair compensation for the work that goes into producing the news. In fact, this type of misinformation—claiming that CJPA is a handout—is exactly why we need strong, independent journalism that can challenge misleading narratives and hold powerful interests accountable. (And for the record, I love journalism in much the same way I love the Raiders. I’m “ride or die,” but I’m disappointed from time to time.) The CJPA seeks to balance the scales, making it clear that the value generated from news content should benefit those who create it, not just the platforms that distribute it.\n\nMy Career in a Declining Field: Journalism When I joined WKRG in Mobile, Alabama in 1990, I was witnessing the end of an era. The station was owned by its founder, Kenneth R. Giddens - his only TV station, reflecting the FCC's limit of seven stations per group. The newsroom buzzed with energy, deeply rooted in local issues. As I moved to Burnham Broadcasting, I noticed changes. The FCC had raised the ownership limit to 12, with talks of further deregulation. By the time I reached WDAF in Kansas City, owned by News Corp, everything had changed. Deregulation had swept through, leaving only a vague \"39 percent rule.\" I watched as media giants consolidated power, transforming the diverse ecosystem of local stations into a corporate monoculture. The internet was eroding our regional monopolies. Print news rushed online, hoping for easy advertising dollars. When that failed, newsrooms were decimated. I saw passionate journalists laid off as profit margins shrank. News itself changed. The pursuit of facts gave way to chasing clicks. Fear-mongering and partisan spin became the norm, measured by engagement rather than accuracy. I struggled between journalistic ideals and a business model valuing sensationalism over substance. Local news coverage, once a public service, became entangled in \"pay to play\" schemes and \"enhanced underwriting.\" The vital work of covering every city council and school board meeting was abandoned for viral content and controversy. I thought of early radio days when entrepreneurs set up towers anywhere, leading to chaos and eventual federal intervention. Now, as journalists navigate citizen journalism and social media, I wonder if we need a new intervention - a business model without advertising - to ensure fact-based journalism survives. In many ways we've come full circle to a new wild west of information. The challenge for future journalists will be serving the public interest through credible fact-based reporting in a digital frontier where financial models prioritize eyeballs over content value. The 1st Amendment gives news many protections and privileges. While not explicitly stated, I believe those come with a duty as well. And duty doesn't work well in business, except the duty to deliver shareholder value. At least for now, our news has devolved into cheap entertainment with the goal of triggering an emotional reaction so that we consume more news -- for the benefit of advertisers.

This shift towards prioritizing clicks and engagement metrics over substance has endangered the fundamental mission of journalism: keeping the masses informed. The chase for clickbait headlines has become the norm because they show better results in analytics. We’ve all seen it – the most trivial mistakes of B-list celebrities get blown out of proportion because they generate the highest engagement. This obsession with clicks has led to the rise of individuals who are famous for all the wrong reasons. And it gets worse: these individuals then have a platform to spread toxic messages, often unchecked, because journalism is too busy churning out content to meet the next click quota. It sucks to see that fact-checking and in-depth reporting are becoming rarities. The focus has shifted from thorough investigative work to producing quick, eye-catching pieces that drive traffic. As a result, we’re not just failing to inform the public; we’re actively misinforming them. So, what can we do to fix this? My four thoughts on how to get started: 1. We need dedicated teams within media organizations to monitor and critique content quality. These watchdogs should ensure that articles are fact-checked, sources are reliable, and sensationalism is avoided. Their role would be to hold the publication accountable to its journalistic standards, pushing back against the pressure to prioritize clicks over content. 2. Editorial decisions should not be driven by analytics alone. While data can provide valuable insights, it shouldn’t dictate the entire content strategy. Newsrooms need to balance data with editorial judgment, prioritizing stories that have genuine news value over those that simply promise high engagement. 3. We must re-commit to in-depth reporting with quotas, if needed. This means allocating resources and time to investigative journalism that can uncover the truth and provide comprehensive coverage of important issues. Long-form articles, detailed analyses, and thoroughly researched reports should become staples once again. 4. Journalists need ongoing education about the importance of maintaining journalistic integrity in the digital age. Simultaneously, the public should be educated about media literacy – how to discern credible news sources from sensationalist clickbait. An informed public can better demand quality journalism. Let’s push for a media landscape where integrity comes first, where the focus is on enlightening rather than entertaining. The health of our democracy depends on it. #Journalism #MediaIntegrity #Clickbait #InvestigativeReporting #MediaLiteracy Ps. Dr. Syksy Räsänen and myself live on national television many years back\n\nThere is currently big debate in Poland regarding relation between so called news media and global platforms. I rarely comment on such topics, but this one is close to my heart. Feel free to grill me. I believe most people in this debate are using different definitions to describe what is happening. There are three concepts: media, publishers, journalists. Via Wikipedia: 1. Media (communication) - tools used to convey information or data. 2. Publisher - an organization or person that disseminates content to the public. 3. Journalist - a person who gathers information in the form of text, sound, or images, processes it into a form worth conveying, and disseminates it publicly. This is called journalism. Traditionally, media mainly referred to the press, meaning print. A technical tool. In this press (newspapers, magazines, yellow press), publishers disseminated many things, including journalism, but also other content like sports results, advertisements, stock market data, and even pornography or celebrity photos. These things were often more important to the audience than journalism. This did not make the press something noble (or better) than other media, like TV or radio. Media are just tools. Also, publishers themselves did not necessarily have noble motives related to journalism. It was believed that to be a good commercial publisher, it was worth having good journalism - in my opinion, mainly because it allowed for higher advertising rates in media used by the publisher (thus increasing the value of the distribution tool). In the opinion of others, it was about attracting attention. Some believe it was done for the public good. This belief, as the new medium - the internet - showed up, turned out to be false. Advertisements can be sold just as expensively without quality journalism (you just need good data). Publishers can, but do not have to, sponsor so-called good content or journalism. Publishers can make big bucks without even producing so called content. It also turned out that journalists do not need the help of commercial media to create valuable information and disseminate it (e.g., Oko Press). What we see today is, in my opinion, a mix-up. Commercial publishers (mostly profit-oriented companies) are trying to defend their outdated tools (media) using the argument of defending journalism (public mission). Nowadays, however, these three things are not connected. I believe that journalism in the free commercial model (i.e., open online) has no future. Future lies with paid media (e.g., Oko Press) or media sustained by public funds and taxation of global media corporations (Google and similar). What I am not addressing here is the issue of the fourth estate, i.e., the control function traditionally understood as the press (implicitly - hard journalism, including investigative journalism) towards democratic power and its role in the fight against autocratic regimes. This is a political problem, not a business one.\n\nNew Job at NABJcareers.org Editor: Boston, Massachusetts CommonWealth Beacon Editor CommonWealth Beacon is an award-winning and highly influential source of rigorous reporting and in-depth journalism, as well as thought-provoking analysis and opinion that illuminates the key issues and players shaping politics, public policy, and government across the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

Thankfully, it is dying. Each year there are fewer newspapers and news websites out there, as the market speaks and people flee these left-wing propaganda machines and wither on the vine. Don’t get me wrong, if these outlets did what they’re supposed to do – actually report the news honestly and without bias – I wouldn’t celebrate their demise. But they don’t, so to hell with them. I find it difficult to not respond to various reporters announcing layoffs in their newsrooms with a resounding “learn to code” swipe, but I mostly succeed. It’s not about individual, awful reporters, most of the time (and they’re usually the last the be let go – looking at you, Taylor Lorenz), it about an industry so far removed from what it used to be that it’s unrecognizable. Media is now an appendage of the Democratic National Committee. I’ll let you decide which appendage it is, but watching this clip from MSNBC’s Morning Joe clearly places it somewhere just below the equator on the human body. The shame is journalism is needed and wildly important, as a concept anyway. We need to know what the hell our government and elected officials are doing. We need to know what corporations are up to. We need to know what’s happening in our world so we can avoid disasters. But disasters are power now – never wanting a good crisis to go to waste is a marketing strategy, not the shame-worthy act it once was and still should be. So, screw them. As journalism exhales its last few breaths, rejoice. There’s still a chance they could recover, but no one in any position of power in the editorial process seems interested in saving it. Hell, The New York Times opinion editor was fired for running an opinion contrary to what the “news” department agreed with. Let that sink in: someone with the job of seeking out and running a variety of opinions was fired for doing just that – from an elected Republican United States Senator, no less – because people working in the department of the paper that expressly is not supposed to have opinions disagreed with it. Ownership at the Times should have fired every reporter who publicly expressed their outrage, instead they caved. This was their last chance to reimpose journalistic standards and the Sulzberger family retracted their testicles back into their stomach and went in the other direction. Why not root for the collapse of outlets like that and everyone involved? Sure, there will be collateral damage – good reporters losing their jobs along with the worthless – but so be it. It’s necessary because the underlying message is so important.\n\nTHE STATE OF JOURNALISM (AND THE STATUS OF JOURNALISTS) IS A RED-HOT TOPIC IN OUR INCREDIBLY FRACTURED AND FACTIONALIZED WORLD... ...and recently, one of this platform's most sagacious commentators, Doug Sheridan of EnergyPoint Research, kicked off an intriguing debate with some very astute observations about the profession's state with a post detailing that fate of James Bennet, a The New York Times opinion page editor who was shoved aside after publishing an \"op-ed\" crafted by a conservative United States senator. Sheridan's assertion is fundamentally this: key media institutions like The Times, via their own deliberate polarization, no longer play the critical and constructive discursive and dialectic roles they once played in society, because (my words, not his) they're too preoccupied with their own vanity missions. Much of this, of course, is the result of co-optation of key media platform by major corporations, which doth protest too much to the contrary when accused of advancing corporate and political agendas through newsrooms, columns and pixels. Bottom line: if you want to get smarter, follow Doug Sheridan. But before we abandon all hope, let's take a look at an intriguing anomaly in this world of curated content despair: Defector Media LLC. This is a platform, gasp, focused on actual readers. It is serious, and it is irreverent. It helps you learn, and it makes you laugh. It is beholden not to a corporate balance sheet, but to the fact is it readers that hold it hostage to a viable business model. That reality comes from the fact the journalists who produce the content are also owners of the business that owns the platform. Unique indeed and a harkening back to the craft's quixotic mission in more golden times. Craigslist may have killed off newspaper classifieds, but only readers can kill their own interests. Defector Media LLC is a big believer in transparency. It annually publishes a \"state-the-business\" report which is not only a look at how things are going, but a unique set of insights into what motivates the model. Readers. Readers. And more readers. See the graph below. You can look at the report here: https://lnkd.in/gRHmFY5m And for folks really serious and concerned about the state of journalism, you can show your support by accessing the Columbia Journalism Review, still one of the best independent voices out there. Indeed, writer Danny Funt earlier this year reflected on Defector Media LLC's success in a CJR piece the utility of which goes beyond deep insights in the company itself, but is also an object lesson in understanding how to navigate one of the most bewildering and complex set of social changes we'll ever experience.

I've always been fascinated by journalism. I fell into advertising by accident while waiting a call up from BBC News which never arrived - their loss obvs 😉. The nearest I got was working on the development of the Newshub brand with Mark Weldon when he was running MediaWorks NZ. The aim was to aggregate all of MediaWorks' news resources which were spread across several brands, most notably 3 News, to create a multiplatform news brand. I had the daunting task of telling first Mark Jennings, the head of 3 News, and then the entire 3 News newsroom that the much cherished 3 News brand would be disestablished. I don't think I have ever been so nervous about a meeting. It was a tough but necessary move to try to get the scale needed to compete effectively. At the time it was established in 2016, Newshub was NZ's largest news brand. With yesterday's news, it's a move that has ultimately failed, due to a number of factors largely outside the control of Newshub: - Loss of advertising revenue due to the shift in on-line media consumption. - Competing with, and having to supply content for channels that pay nothing for news. - A powerful narrative undermining the independence and legitimacy of so-called 'legacy' media created by the terrible handling of communication about the Public Interest Journalism Fund. To me, the latter is the most concerning aspect. Those who seek to undermine the legitimacy of genuine news sources are either: - people in power who want to be free to do what they want without the need to be accountable to anyone - people who have no interest in reporting or finding actual news, but produce clickbait purporting to be news, with no regard to its veracity, designed purely to attract and keep eyeballs. People who criticise the 'corporate' media forget that the 'alternative' media they rely on are also funded by eyeballs and advertising. This issue isn't just about journalists and others who work for Newshub and TVNZ losing their jobs, it is about how power is held to account. The fact that we have a Broadcasting Minister who seems to be utterly out of her depth and clueless about the responsibility inherent in her portfolio says a lot about how important our current government feel about having a strong independent media sector in NZ. Like Patrick Gower I've got no patience with the 'go woke, go broke' narrative. If we want quality, NZ based journalism that holds power to account, and tells our stories, then we need to pay for it. So please, don't just wring your hands, if you haven't already, put your money where your mouth is and buy a subscription. Buy several. Stuff, Newsroom NZ, The Spinoff, The Kākā"
