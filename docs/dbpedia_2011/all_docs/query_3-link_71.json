        "text": "This article is about the discontinued Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine. For the re-branded PSM, see PlayStation: The Official Magazine.\n\nFile:Official playstation magazine logo.JPGFile:Opm-0701.jpg\n\nThe final issue of the OPM U.S.\n\nCategoriesVideo gamePublisherZiff Davis MediaFirst issueOctober 1997; 26 years ago ( )Final issueJanuary 2007 (2007-01)Based inSan Francisco, California, U.S.LanguageEnglishWebsiteopm.1up.com\n\nOfficial U.S. PlayStation Magazine (often abbreviated to OPM) was a monthly video game magazine, published by Ziff Davis Media. It was a sister publication of Electronic Gaming Monthly. The magazine focused exclusively on PlayStation hardware, software, and culture, covering the original PlayStation, PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Portable. Each issue included a disc that contained playable demos and videos of PlayStation games. The magazine had a nearly ten-year run. The first issue, cover dated October 1997, was published September 23, 1997,[1] while the final issue was cover dated January 2007.\n\nAfter OPM was discontinued in January 2007, the independent PlayStation magazine PSM became PlayStation: The Official Magazine in December 2007, replacing OPM as the official magazine focusing on Sony game consoles.\n\nStaff[]\n\nThe final incarnation of the OPM staff included:\n\nEditor-in-chief – Tom Byron\n\nManaging editor – Dana Jongewaard\n\nSenior editor – Joe Rybicki\n\nPreviews editor – Thierry \"Scooter\" Nguyen\n\nNews editor – Giancarlo Varanini\n\nArt director – Ryan Vulk\n\nAssociate art director – Alejandro Chavetta\n\nDisc editor – Logan Parr\n\nEditorial director – John Davison\n\nPast members included:\n\nSenior Art Director - Bob Conlon\n\nManaging editor – Gary Steinman\n\nManaging editor – Din Perez\n\nManaging editor – Dan Peluso\n\nReviews editor – Chris Baker\n\nAssociate editor – Mark MacDonald\n\nEditor-in-chief – Wataru Maruyama\n\nEditor-in-chief – Kraig Kujawa\n\nEditor-in-chief – John Davison\n\nDemo discs[]\n\nOPM was the first gaming magazine to include a disc that featured playable demos of PlayStation games. Beginning with issue one, each magazine came with a disc containing playable PlayStation game demos and non-playable video footage. Later, interviews, industry event coverage, and video walkthroughs of games would also be included on the discs. Beginning with issue 49 (October 2001), the magazine came with a PlayStation 2 demo disc, though for a time it would still be alternated with original PlayStation demo discs. Issues 50, 52, and 54 were the last issues to include demo discs for the original PlayStation. All of the demo discs were developed by LifeLike Productions, Inc.\n\nOPM had released one PlayStation Portable demo, Killzone Liberation. It was available only with the purchase of retail copies rather than subscription issues. The magazine was discontinued before making the assumed transition to PlayStation 3 demo discs.\n\nInternational editions[]\n\nSimilar international editions of the magazine exist in Sweden, Finland, the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland, Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Belgium, Portugal, Brazil and Australia. The Belgian edition is also published in the Netherlands.\n\nThe Australian edition was originally published by Next Media bi-monthly, but eventually became a monthly magazine. APC published the magazine after issue 18. It is currently published by Derwent Howard and is edited by Narayan Pattison.\n\nReferences[]\n\n[]\n\nOfficial Website (Archived)\n\nOPM at 1UP.com\n\nPlayStation® Network\n\nPlayStation®\n\nRadiOPM at 1UP.com (official podcast)\n\nStaff blogs[]\n\nEditor in Chief, Tom Byron\n\nManaging Editor, Dana Jongewaard\n\nSenior Editor, Joe Rybicki\n\nPreviews Editor, Thierry \"Scooter\" Nguyen\n\nNews Editor, Giancarlo Varanini\n\nPage Template:Hlist/styles.css must have content model \"Sanitized CSS\" for TemplateStyles (current model is \"wikitext\").\n\nPlayStation Companies Sony Interactive Entertainment • SIE Worldwide Studios Consoles Home consoles PlayStation (Models • Main hardware) • PlayStation 2 (Models • Main hardware) • PlayStation 3 (Models • Main hardware • System software) • PlayStation 4 (Models • Main hardware • System software) Handhelds PlayStation Portable (System software) • PlayStation Vita (System software) Miscellaneous PocketStation • PSX • PlayStation TV • PlayStation Classic Games PS1 games A–L • M–Z • Best-selling • PS one Classics (JP • NA • PAL) PS2 games Best-selling • Online games • PS2 Classics for PS3 • PS2 games for PS4 PS3 games Best-selling • Physical • Digital only • 3D games • PS Move games PS4 games Best-selling • PSVR PSP games Physical and digital • System software compatibilities • PS Minis Other PS Now games • PS Vita games (A–L • M–O • P–R • S • T–V • W–Z) • PS Mobile games • TurboGrafx-16 Classics • NEOGEO Station • Classics HD • Instant Game Collection (NA • PAL • Asia • Japan • China) Reprints Greatest Hits • Essentials • The Best • BigHit Series Network PlayStation Network • 2011 outage • Central Station • FirstPlay • PlayStation App • PlayStation Home • PlayStation Mobile • PlayStation Music • PlayStation Now • PlayStation Store • PlayStation Video • PlayStation Vue • PS2 online • Room for PSP • VidZone Accessories Controllers PlayStation Controller • PlayStation Mouse • Analog Joystick • Dual Analog • DualShock • Sixaxis\n\nPlayStation Move\n\nCameras EyeToy • Go!Cam • PlayStation Eye • PlayStation Camera Miscellaneous Multitap • Link Cable • PS2 accessories • PS2 Headset • PS3 accessories • PlayTV • Wonderbook • PlayStation VR Kits Net Yaroze • PS2 Linux • GScube • OtherOS • Zego Media Magazines Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine • PlayStation: The Official Magazine • PlayStation Official Magazine – UK • PlayStation Official Magazine – Australia • PlayStation Underground Advertisements Double Life • Mountain • PlayStation marketing Characters Toro • Polygon Man • Kevin Butler • Marcus Rivers Arcade boards Namco System 11 • System 12 • System 10 • System 246 • System 357 Related Super NES CD-ROM • Sony Ericsson Xperia Play\n\nTemplate:Video game critics"
