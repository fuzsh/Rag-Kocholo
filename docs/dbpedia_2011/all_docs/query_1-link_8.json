        "text": "\"The evolving Sino-American rivalry has opened the door for a New Cold War. This thought-provoking collection of essays provides a glimpse into the future through the history of Soviet-American confrontations. It is a rare and invaluable contribution by experts on the former Communist Bloc. Remarkable achievement.\" Patrick Mendis, distinguished visiting professor of global affairs, National Chengchi University, and former US commissioner to UNESCO \"This is an important, long-time overdue volume. It presents the state of Chinese studies during the Cold War era in the Socialist Bloc. Situating research on China within the specific geopolitical complexities, this collection sheds light on the contributions and limitations as well as the achievements and blind spots of the Eastern Bloc academia. This is a required reading not only for specialists in Chinese studies, but also for scholars interested in academic history at large.\" Axel Schneider, vice director, Centre for Modern East Asian Studies, University of Göttingen\n\nRussian Sinologists are involved in the \"China Studies – Epistemology of the Oral History\" international project since 2008. There were 45 interviews recorded with prominent Sinologists from the four cities (Moscow, St. Petersburg, Vladivostok, Taipei) in Russia in 2008–2015. 43 interviews are published in the Internet and in several printed volumes in Russian and Chinese. 26 interviews have been translated into Chinese, 9 more translations are passing through the editing and proof-reading stage. In addition to the full texts of the interviews, more than 15 academic papers, based on these interviews, are published in Russia, Hong Kong, China, Mongolia and Taiwan. The Prospects for the development of the Project include the recording more interviews with Sinologists of the elder group of middle generation (from 60 to 70 years old), shifting the focus of attention to the regions of Ural, Siberia and the Far East, bridging the gender imbalance (more interviews with female sinologists), intensifying the research work, including comparative historical research, as well as the expansion of international cooperation. In 2016-2017 it is scheduled to publish the 2nd and 3rd volumes of the \"Russian Sinology – Oral History\" series. Overall, seven years of the successful project work in Russia showed that this positive academic initiative, which is effectively integrating all the global community of the professional sinologists, would help to write a new, in many ways quite a unique chapter in the history of Russian and world Sinology. Keywords: China, China studies, Russia, Sinology, epistemology, oral history, interviews\n\nThis highly individual study is the first-ever attempt to describe Polish Sinology, Polish Sinologists and their individual choices, both vocational and social or political. The author, as an insider, uses interviews with some of the most important representatives of Polish Sinology (mainly of the older generation). He proposes individual systematization, fragmenting the history of the “real socialism” era (1950-1989) and after the democratic breakthrough of 1989 in many chapters, consisting of both collective and individual. Among the major findings is that the initial small circle of highly specialized individuals has recently been quickly growing, and so has the diversification within it. While until 1989 the career choices in this field were limited, basically an official (diplomatic or state bureaucratic) career was the only option, but after this threshold many new windows of opportunities were opened, which included for example personal choices like studying in Mainland China...\n\nThis article presents personal accounts by Russian sinologists about their professional work abroad and exchanges with foreign colleagues during the Soviet period (1917‒1991). Divided, isolated, oppressed, discriminated, limited, and confined to their country for many decades, Russian sinologists still managed to maintain contacts with their colleagues in China, the “socialist camp,” and the global sinology community. Sinologists in the USSR had to implement various methods to penetrate the political and ideological “Iron Veil,” to promote their studies abroad, and to participate in international cooperation on China studies. This study utilizes data obtained from nearly 40 interviews conducted in Russia as part of “The Epistemology of China Studies: Oral History Project” from 2009 to 2014. Its purpose is to demonstrate the uniqueness of professional interviews as a potentially rich source and foundation for further academic explorations of oral history on China studies."
