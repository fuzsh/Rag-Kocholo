        "text": "“Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.” – The First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution\n\nThis First Amendment timeline includes significant historical events, court cases, and ideas that have shaped our constitutional First Amendment jurisprudence.\n\nEarly concepts of personal freedoms\n\n313 - The Edict of Milan declares that the Roman Empire, under the rule of Constantine, will permanently extend religious toleration to Christians. It gave Christianity legal status in the Roman Empire and a reprieve from persecution.\n\n1215 - King John of England finds himself fighting back a revolt which ultimately compels the king to recognize rights of both noblemen and ordinary Englishmen. This document, known as the Magna Carta, establishes the principle that no one, including the king or a lawmaker, is above the law, and establishes a framework for future documents such as the Declaration of Independence and the Bill of Rights.\n\n1517 - Martin Luther, a German monk, posts his ninety-five theses, ushering in the Protestant Reformation, a religious movement that brought an end to the ecclesiastical unity of medieval Christianity throughout western Europe and profoundly reshaped the course of modern history. The Reformation appealed to the founders of the United States, and some of its concepts of individualism and free expression of religion are incorporated into the First Amendment.\n\n1527 - The Anabaptist Schleitheim Confession, in Switzerland, argues for greater separation of church and state, saying “A separation shall be made from the evil and from the wickedness which the devil planted in the world.” Anabaptists see the church as pure, and any form of non-secular government as innately flawed.\n\n1534 - The Act of Supremacy declares the Church of England independent from Rome and makes the British monarch supreme governor of the church, thus, furthering the divide between Protestants and Catholics.\n\nPre-First Amendment in England's American colonies\n\n1607 - Colonization begins in Virginia, which will firmly establish the Anglican Church, or the Church of England, as the colony’s compulsory religion.\n\n1619 - The first African American slaves arrive in Jamestown, Virginia. Years later, slavery divides the country, leading to the Civil War and restrictions on speech promoting the abolition to try to stem the anti-slavery sentiment.\n\n1620 - The Pilgrims land at Massachusetts and write the Mayflower Compact, the first known constitution to be written in the New World. The signatories to the Mayflower Compact pledged to “covenant and combine ourselves together into a civil Body Politick, for our better Ordering and Preservation.”\n\n1628 - The Petition of Right is a statement of the objectives of the 1628 English legal-reform movement. It leads to civil war and the deposing of King Charles I in 1649. This important document sets out the rights and liberties of the common man as opposed to the prerogatives of the crown and expresses many of the ideals that later lead to the American Revolution.\n\n1641 - The Massachusetts General Court formally adopts the first broad statement of American liberties, the Massachusetts Body of Liberties. The document includes a right to petition and a statement about due process. England abolishes the notorious Star Chamber, which had prosecuted individuals for libeling the king.\n\n1643 - The English Parliament establishes a restrictive printing ordinance. The ordinance required authors to get prior approval from an official licenser before publication of printed materials.\n\n1644 - Defying the printing ordinance,John Milton anonymously publishes the Areopagitica, a pamphlet to persuade English Parliament to oppose the restrictive printing ordinance. Many scholars say this is the first expression of the concept of a free press in the English-speaking world. Milton argued that the benefits of a vigorous public debate far outweigh the dangers to society of unregulated public discourse — a theory that still has currency today.\n\n1649 - The province of Maryland adopts the Maryland Toleration Act, in an attempt to ensure religious freedom for Roman Catholics settling in America. Written by Lord Baltimore of Maryland, it included the first known use of the phrase “free exercise, ” a term later used to protect religious freedom in the First Amendment. The law also made it a crime to blaspheme God, the Holy Trinity, the Virgin Mary, or the early apostles and evangelists. It also forbade one resident from referring to another’s religion in a disparaging way and provided for honoring the Sabbath.\n\n1660 - John Bunyan, who later would write Pilgrim’s Progress, begins 12 years of intermittent imprisonment in England for his preaching and for holding illegal religious meetings.\n\n1663 - The Charter of Rhode Island, a decree from King Charles II of England, grants the colony freedom to govern itself and guarantees religious freedom.\n\n1670 - William Penn publishes “The Great Case of Liberty of Conscience Once More Debated & Defended,” a masterful and thorough explanation that conscience is a profoundly sacred right, even more critical than religious beliefs. William Penn and William Mead are tried in England for street preaching.\n\n1672 - The British Test Act restricts public offices to Anglicans, out of a fear of subversion by Protestants, whose numbers and influence continue to grow.\n\n1687 - A Declaration of Indulgence, protecting the rights of Catholics and Protestant dissenters to worship, is issued by James II of England.\n\n1688 - The Glorious Revolution deposes James II in favor of William and Mary. The Toleration Act ends British persecution of Protestant dissenters but does not disestablish the Anglican Church.\n\n1689 - The English Bill of Rights recognizes the rights of Protestants to worship. John Locke’s Letter Concerning Toleration is published. It provides the philosophical basis for George Mason’s proposed Article Sixteen of the Virginia Declaration of Rights of 1776, which deals with religion. Mason’s proposal provides that “all Men should enjoy the fullest toleration in the exercise of religion.”\n\n1692 - The Salem Witch Trials take place in the Massachusetts colony. The trials led to the hanging of 19 individuals who refused to admit that they practiced witchcraft and one person who was pressed to death. During the trials, the accused were slandered with little recourse and denied rights that should have been granted under English common law.\n\n1695 - John Locke publishes The Reasonableness of Christianity.\n\n1708 - Connecticut allows “full liberty of worship” to Anglicans and Baptists under the first known dissenter statute.\n\n1735 - John Peter Zenger, a New York publisher, is tried for libel after publishing criticism of the Royal Governor of New York. Zenger is defended by Andrew Hamilton and acquitted by a jury His trial establishes the principle that truth is a defense to libel and that a jury may determine whether a publication is defamatory or seditious.\n\n1744 - Elisha Williams, a Yale professor, pastor and member of the Connecticut General Assembly, writes a pamphlet that pleads for liberty of conscience in religious affairs, and states that everyone has the right to free thought, conscience and religion. The pamphlet was in response to a Connecticut law that prohibited ministers from delivering sermons outside their own parishes without invitations from established clergy, among other regulations of ecclesiastical regulations.\n\n1751 - James Madison, who will eventually propose what will become the First Amendment, is born.\n\n1758 - Jonathan Edwards, an important clergyman during the Great Awakening, dies. The Great Awakening was a series of religious revivals in early America led by evangelical Protestant ministers.\n\n1762 - John Wilkes begins publishing the North Briton, which will lead to his expulsion from the British Parliament for the insinuations his journal promotes in regard to the monarchy.\n\n1765 - The Stamp Act, a tax on all papers and official documents, is imposed on the American colonies by the English in an effort to offset expenses incurred in recent struggles against France and Spain.\n\n1771 - The State of Virginia jails 50 Baptist worshipers for preaching the Gospel contrary to the Anglican Book of Common Prayer.\n\n1774 - Eighteen Baptists are jailed in Massachusetts for refusing to pay taxes that support the Congregational church. After defeating Spain and France in a slew of armed conflicts, Parliament pass the Quebec Act, which grants religious freedom to French-speaking Catholics in Canada, to the offense of Protestants in the American colonies.\n\n1776 - Virginia’s House of Burgesses passes the Virginia Declaration of Rights. The Virginia Declaration is the first bill of rights to be included in a state constitution in America. The Continental Congress adopt the final draft of the Declaration of Independence on July 4, 1776.\n\n1777 - Thomas Jefferson completes his first draft of a Virginia statute for religious freedom, which states: “No man shall be compelled to frequent or support any religious worship, place, or ministry whatsoever.” The statute (adopted in 1786) is considered one of the most important documents in early U.S. religious history. It marked the end of a 10-year struggle for the separation of church and state in Virginia, and it was the driving force behind the religious clauses of the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.\n\n1781 - The Articles of Confederation, which vests primary power in the states, is ratified.\n\n1785 - James Madison writes the \"Memorial and Remonstrance Against Religious Assessments\", a document arguing for complete religious liberty and against any government support of a religion.\n\n1786 - Virginia adopts its Statute for Religious Freedom, disestablishing the Anglican Church as the official church and prohibits harassment based on religious differences.\n\n1787-1788 - Originally published in New York newspapers as The Federalist and widely reprinted in newspapers throughout the U.S., The Federalist Papers are a unique collection of 85 essays written by Alexander Hamilton, James Madison and John Jay urging ratification of the Constitution. In Federalist No. 84, Hamilton writes on the subject of the liberty of the press, declaring that “the liberty of the press shall be inviolably preserved.”\n\n1787 - The Constitutional Convention meets in Philadelphia and, on Sept. 17, adopts a U.S. Constitution, which is then submitted to the states for ratification. The constitution includes a provision against test oaths for federal officeholders and allows individuals to affirm rather than to swear oaths, but makes no specific mention of God. Congress also passes the Northwest Ordinance. Though primarily a law establishing government guidelines for colonization of new territory, it also provides that “religion, morality and knowledge being necessary also to good government and the happiness of mankind, schools and the means of education shall forever be encouraged.”\n\n1788 - Most of the 13 states hold conventions to ratify the Constitution. Anti-Federalists object to the absence of a bill of rights, while Federalists argue for the creation of a stronger national government. The Constitution is officially ratified by the states on June 21, 1788.\n\n1789 - George Washington becomes the first president of the United States. James Madison proposes a bill of rights in the first Congress. John Jay is confirmed as the first chief justice of the United States.\n\n1790 Congress adopts the Copyright Act, which creates a set of limited, but exclusive, rights for authors to copy, print, and sell certain of their expressive works.\n\n1791 - On Dec. 15, 1791, the Bill of Rights comprising 10 constitutional amendments is ratified after Virginia becomes the 11th state to approve it.\n\nLate 1700s\n\n1794 - Thomas Paine, author of Common Sense, publishes The Age of Reason, a two-part critique of Christianity and religion that scandalized many Christian believers. Freedom of religion is a major concern in early America.\n\n1796 - During Tennessee’s constitutional convention, Andrew Jackson opposes, and plays a prominent role in defeating, a proposal requiring a profession of faith by all officeholders.\n\n1798 - President John Adams oversees the passage of the Alien and Sedition Acts, which punishes speech against the government. In response, Thomas Jefferson introduces the “Kentucky Resolution” and James Madison issues the “Virginia Resolution” to give states the power to determine the constitutionality of the Alien and Sedition Acts. On Sept. 12, 1798, newspaper editor Benjamin Franklin Bache, the grandson of Benjamin Franklin, is arrested under the Sedition Act for libeling President John Adams.\n\n1800 - James Madison writes the Virginia Report challenging the Sedition Act.\n\n1800s before the Civil War\n\n1801 - The Sedition Act of 1798 expires, and President Thomas Jefferson pardons all persons convicted under the act. The act had punished those who uttered or published “false, scandalous, and malicious” writings against the government. John Adams appoints John Marshall as chief justice of the United States. Tunis Wortman publishes A Treatise Concerning Political Enquiry and the Liberty of the Press which one scholar, Robert W. T. Martin, describes the text as “the most articulate exposition of the modern concept of press liberty to emerge in the aftermath of the Sedition Act.”\n\n1802 - Thomas Jefferson refers to \"the wall of separation\" between church and state in a letter to the Danbury Baptists.\n\n1803 - Chief Justice John Marshall's opinion in Marbury v.

Taylor, the Supreme Court rules that a state’s incorporation of religious bodies is permissible and that such incorporation subsequently serves as protection for land that they own.\n\n1819 - State v. Gruber, a case heard in a county court in Maryland, stands as an early and rare example of the protection of antislavery speech in a slaveholding state.\n\n1821 - In Anderson v.

Peck, a judge on the U.S. district court in Missouri, is thought to have abused the power by imprisoning an individual who criticized one of his opinions. John Bannister Gibson, a Pennsylvania Supreme Court justice decides in Phillips et al. (Simon’s Executors) v. Gratz, that a court did not have to postpone its proceedings for a Jewish defendant who refused to appear on his Sabbath.\n\n1833 - In Barron v.

The amendment, in part, requires that no state shall “deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.”\n\n1872 - In Board of Education of the City of Cincinnati v. Minor, the Ohio Supreme Court rules that a school board can repeal a regulation requiring that public schools hold opening exercises consisting of Bible reading and singing. In Watson v. Jones, the Supreme Court establishes principles that continue to dominate resolution of internal religious disputes.\n\n1873 - Anti-obscenity reformer Anthony Comstock successfully lobbies Congress to pass the Comstock Law. This is the first comprehensive anti-obscenity statute enacted at the federal level. The law targets the “Trade in and Circulation of, obscene literature and Articles for immoral use” and makes it illegal to send any “obscene, lewd or lascivious” materials or any information or “any article or thing” related to contraception or abortion through the mail. The Supreme Court gives a limited reading to the 14th Amendment in the Slaughterhouse Cases and ultimately rejects a claim that butchers in New Orleans filed against state regulations directing that all butchering take place in selected abattoirs.\n\n1875 - President Ulysses S.

Nebraska upholds a conviction for printing an American flag on a “Stars and Stripes” brand beer bottle. In Patterson v. Colorado — its first free-press case — the U.S. Supreme Court determines it does not have jurisdiction to review the “contempt” conviction of U.S. senator and Denver newspaper publisher Thomas Patterson for articles and a cartoon that criticized the state supreme court. The Court writes that “what constitutes contempt, as well as the time during which it may be committed, is a matter of local law.” Leaving undecided the question of whether First Amendment guarantees are applicable to the states via the 14th Amendment, the Court holds that the free speech and press guarantees only guard against prior restraint and do not prevent “subsequent punishment.” The Tillman Act, which was signed into law by President Theodore Roosevelt, forbids some campaign contributions and is the first federal effort to regulate campaign finance.\n\n1910 - The Wireless Ship Act addresses the emerging technology of radio, especially in international shipping and recreational cruise industries.\n\n1911 - In United States v.

The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics emerges as a direct result, along with increasing concerns in America about the spread of socialism and communism.\n\n1900s World War I to World II\n\n1917 - Congress passes the Espionage Act, making it a crime “to willfully cause or attempt to cause insubordination, disloyalty, mutiny, or refusal of duty, in the military or naval forces of the United States,” or to “willfully obstruct the recruiting or enlistment service of the United States.” The Civil Liberties Bureau, a forerunner of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), forms in response to the Espionage Act. The United States enters World War I aligning with France, Russia, Great Britain, Italy and Japan.\n\n1918 - Congress passes the Sedition Act of 1918, forbidding spoken or printed criticism of the U.S. government, the Constitution or the flag.\n\n1919 - In Schenck v. U.S., Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. sets forth his clear and present danger test: “whether the words used are used in such circumstances and are of such a nature as to create a clear and present danger that they will bring about the substantive evils that Congress has the right to prevent.” Schenck and others had been accused of urging draftees to oppose the draft and “not submit to intimidation.” Justice Holmes also writes that not all speech is protected by the First Amendment, citing the now-famous example of falsely crying “fire” in a crowded theater. In Debs v. U.S., the U.S. Supreme Court upholds the conviction of socialist and presidential candidate Eugene Debs under the Espionage Act for making speeches opposing World War I. Justice Holmes claims to apply the “clear and present danger” test; however, he phrases it as requiring that Debs’ words have a “natural tendency and reasonably probable effect” of obstructing recruitment. The first anticommunist \"red scare\" begins as a result of the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia. The U.S. Supreme Court upholds the convictions of five individuals charged with violating the 1917 Espionage Act in Abrams v. United States. The individuals had circulated pamphlets critical of the U.S. government and its involvement in World War I. In a dissenting opinion, Justice Holmes writes that “the ultimate good desired is better reached by free trade in ideas — that the best test of truth is the power of the thought to get itself accepted in the competition of the market.” This passage forms the foundation of the “marketplace of ideas” theory of the First Amendment.\n\n1920 - Roger Baldwin and others start up a new organization dedicated to preserving civil liberties called the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). Zechariah Chafee Jr. publishes Freedom of Speech. In the first defense of the First Amendment by a Supreme Court justice, Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. incorporates Chafee’s free speech theory in his dissent in Abrams v. United States (1919), articulating the need for free speech.\n\n1921 - Congress repeals the Sedition Act.\n\n1923 - In Meyer v. Nebraska, The Supreme Court voids a state law prohibiting the teaching of modern languages to children in public schools.\n\n1925 - In the landmark decision in Gitlow v. New York, the U.S. Supreme Court upholds under the New York criminal anarchy statute Benjamin Gitlow’s conviction for writing and distributing “The Left Wing Manifesto.” Although Gitlow's conviction was upheld, the Court in analyzing the case concluded for the first time that the free speech clause of the First Amendment applies to the states through the due-process clause of the 14th Amendment. This reverses the course set in 1833 when the Court had decided the First Amendment did not guarantee protection of speech from state laws. The “Scopes monkey trial” takes place in Dayton, Tennessee, when school teacher John Thomas Scopes is found guilty of violating a Tennessee law which prohibits teaching the theory of evolution in public schools. The case pits famed orator William Jennings Bryan against defense attorney Clarence Darrow. In Pierce v. Society of Sisters, the Supreme Court upholds the right of parents to send children to parochial schools. Congress passes the Corrupt Practices Act in an attempt to regulate campaign contributions.\n\n1926 - H.L. Mencken is arrested for distributing copies of American Mercury, a political and satirical magazine. Censorship groups in Boston contend the periodical is obscene.\n\n1927 - In Whitney v. California, the U.S. Supreme Court upholds California’s criminal syndicalism law. The case involves Charlotte Anita Whitney, a member of the Socialist Party and former member of the Communist Labor Party. Justice Louis D. Brandeis writes in his concurring opinion a passage that becomes a fundamental First Amendment principle: “If there be time to expose through discussion the falsehood and fallacies, to avert the evil by the processes of education, the remedy to be applied is more speech, not enforced silence.” This idea is considered the counterspeech doctrine.\n\n1928 - In People of State of New York ex rel. Bryant v. Zimmerman, the U.S. Supreme Court upholds a New York law which mandates that organizations requiring their members to take oaths must file certain organizational documents with the secretary of state. The Court writes: “There can be no doubt that under that power the state may prescribe and apply to associations having an oath-bound membership any reasonable regulation calculated to confine their purposes and activities within limits which are consistent with the rights of others and the public welfare.”\n\n1930 - The Supreme Court in Cochran v. Board of Education upholds the right of Louisiana state officials to provide secular textbooks to children in parochial schools.\n\n1931 - In Stromberg v. California, the U.S. Supreme Court reverses the state court conviction of Yetta Stromberg, 19-year-old female member of the Young Communist League who violated a state law prohibiting the display of a red flag as “an emblem of opposition to the United States government.” Legal commentators cite this case as the first in which the Court recognizes that protected speech may be nonverbal, or a form of symbolic expression. In Near v. Minnesota, the U.S. Supreme Court invalidates a permanent injunction against the publisher of The Saturday Press. The Court rule that the Minnesota statute granting state judges the power to enjoin as a nuisance any “malicious, scandalous and defamatory newspaper, magazine or other periodical” is “the essence of censorship.” The Court concluded that the primary aim of the First Amendment was to prevent prior restraints of the press. The town of Green River, Wyoming, adopts laws limiting door-to-door solicitations; such laws come to be known as Green River Ordinances.\n\n1933 - President Franklin D. Roosevelt pardons those convicted under the Espionage and Sedition Acts. California repeals its Red Flag Law.\n\n1936 - In Grosjean v. American Press Co., the U.S. Supreme Court invalidates a state tax on newspaper advertising applied to papers with a circulation exceeding 20,000 copies per week as a violation of the First Amendment. The Court finds the tax unconstitutional because “it is seen to be a deliberate and calculated device in the guise of a tax to limit the circulation of information to which the public is entitled in virtue of the constitutional guarantees.”\n\n1937 - In DeJonge v. Oregon, the U.S. Supreme Court reverse the conviction of an individual under a state criminal syndicalism law for participation in a Communist party political meeting. The Court writes that “peaceable assembly for lawful discussion cannot be made a crime. The holding of meetings for peaceable political action cannot be proscribed.” In Palko v. Connecticut, Justice Benjamin N. Cardozo affirms the doctrine of selective incorporation, which empowers the U.S. Supreme Court to take a case-by-case approach in applying the Bill of Rights to states.\n\n1938 - Justice Harlan Fiske Stone, in his Carolene Products footnote four, advances a \"double standard\" that gives increased protection for provisions of the Bill of Rights. This will coerce the court to emphasize protecting individual rights rather than property rights. Life magazine is banned in the U.S. for publishing pictures from the public health film “The Birth of a Baby.”\n\n1939 - The Supreme Court in Schneider v. State overturns a city law limiting the distribution of handbills. The Hatch Act limits the political activities of federal employees. Georgia, Massachusetts and Connecticut finally ratify the Bill of Rights.\n\n1940 - Congress passes the Smith Act, Title I of the Alien Registration Act of 1940, which makes it a crime to advocate the violent overthrow of the government. In Cantwell v. Connecticut, the Supreme Court relies on the free exercise clause to allow door-to-door solicitation by Jehovah's Witnesses. In Minersville School District v. Gobitis, the Supreme Court rules that children may be expelled for refusing to say the Pledge of Allegiance in public schools. In Thornhill v. Alabama, the U.S. Supreme Court strikes down an Alabama law prohibiting loitering and picketing “without a just cause or legal excuse” near businesses. The Court writes: “The freedom of speech and of the press guaranteed by the Constitution embraces at the least the liberty to discuss publicly and truthfully all matters of public concern without previous restraint or fear of subsequent punishment.” In Cantwell v. Connecticut, the U.S. Supreme Court holds for the first time that the due-process clause of the 14th Amendment makes the free-exercise clause of the First Amendment applicable to states. The Court upholds a Pennsylvania flag salute law in Minersville School District v.

The U.S. Supreme Court upholds a zoning law regulating the location of adult businesses. The Court determines in City of Renton v.

The Court rules in Witters v. Washington Dept. of Services for the Blind that a vocational rehabilitation-assistance program which awards grants and scholarships to students does not violate the establishment clause, even if some recipients use the funds to attend religious schools.

Bethel School District in Spanaway, Wash., suspended 17-year-old Matthew Fraser, an honors student, for two days after what was considered a lewd spring election campaign speech at a school assembly with 600 students present.

McPherson, the Supreme Court rules that a clerical employee in a constable’s office has a First Amendment right to speak harshly about the attempted assassination of President Ronald Reagan.

Vopper that a federal law prohibiting the publication of illegally intercepted wire communications violates the First Amendment rights of those who published the communications, though they were not the ones who intercepted them. The Court reasoned that application of the law to the defendants in this case “implicates the core provision of the First Amendment because it imposes sanctions on the publication of truthful information of public concern.” The USA Patriot Act of 2001 was passed just 45 days after the terrorist attacks in New York and Washington, D.C. on September 11, 2001.
