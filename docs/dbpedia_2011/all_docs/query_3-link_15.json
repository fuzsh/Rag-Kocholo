        "text": "Unless specifically noted otherwise, all forms on this page were created by the Alaska Court System. Most forms are fill-in-the-blank, and can be completed either electronically (by downloading the blank PDF and typing in the blank fields) or by printing out a paper copy and filling in by hand. Printed copies are also available in person at all court locations. Contact forms@akcourts.gov to ask for a paper copy of a form to be mailed to you. Some forms have the option to use a web-based tool to walk you through and help you complete them. At the end of the walk-through, you will be emailed an attachment of the completed form that you can review for accuracy before filing.\n\nThe Alaska Court System produces instructional forms and publications, covering a variety of topics. Instructions are available online within their specific topics (see the list at the top of this webpage) and at all court locations statewide. Publications are available online and at all court locations statewide.\n\nCourt forms are not available for every situation. The courtâs law library has non-court-produced form books for some case types. These form books include sample language that you could adapt to create your own documents to file with the court. In other situations, you may have to create your own documents without the help of examples. You may want to speak with a lawyer to help you make sure you are including all required information and following all legal requirements in your document, especially if you are not using a form produced by the Alaska Court System.\n\nFor more information and access to legal research materials and other resources (including sample form books), contact one of the court's law libraries. Most court locations have a public computer with access to online library materials.\n\nEach person's legal situation is unique. Court staff cannot give you legal advice about what kind of case to file, what words to use in filling out forms, or how the judge might decide your case. Court staff can help you find and access a particular form. Court staff may be able to help you with routine procedures (for example, making sure you have filled out all of the required forms to file for dissolution of a marriage)."
