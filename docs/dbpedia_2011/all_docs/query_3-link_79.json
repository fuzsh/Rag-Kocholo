        "text": "History and role\n\nIn December 2020 the COVID-19 Group was established as a business unit of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (DPMC), continuing the work of the National Crisis Management Centre following the centre's deactivation on 30 June 2020.\n\nThe Group acted as a central COVID-19 response function responsible for oversight, integration and coordination across the response system as a whole. The Group was responsible for assurance to Ministers and the identification of opportunities for continuous improvement in New Zealand’s response.\n\nIt delivered the following functions:\n\nPolicy and strategy – leadership and coordination of the overarching strategy for response and recovery, and coordination and integration of advice on readiness and response activities across agencies.\n\nSystem response, readiness, and planning – coordination and convening delivery agencies to ensure alignment of planning activities (including resurgence planning).\n\nInsights and reporting – drawing on research and evaluation (domestic and international) to ensure continuous improvement of the system.\n\nRisk and assurance – assurance that the right work is happening across government, in the right sequence and the appropriate place.\n\nCommunications and engagement – leadership and coordination of public communications (including the Unite Against COVID-19 campaign), and coordination of stakeholder engagement (including business and community sectors).\n\nIn accordance with the decision made by Cabinet in December 2020, the Group’s strategic priorities were to:\n\nProvide assurance to ministers that the COVID-19 system is saving lives, protecting the economy and supporting social cohesion.\n\nProvide assurance that the COVID-19 system is sustainable, agile and improving.\n\nEnsure the public understands the response.\n\nTransition of COVID-19 functions from DPMC to the Health system\n\nThe DPMC COVID-19 Group played an important role in ensuring a centralised, coordinated all of Government approach to our response and throughout 2022/23 worked to ensure the system continued to deliver and meet Ministerial expectations as it was reconfigured to support the new settings.\n\nAs our response to COVID-19 evolved in 2022 we moved to a greater emphasis on responsibility lying with sectors and individuals to manage COVID-19. In addition, the health system reforms meant that many of the COVID-19 functions that had resided in the Ministry of Health had moved to new entities by 1 July 2022.\n\nIn June 2022 the Chief Executive COVID-19 All-of-Government Response led an analysis of existing systems functions and governance structures with a view to transitioning the then centralised all-of-government response led by DPMC to a more orthodox governance and operating model over the course of 2022/23.\n\nOver the course of 2022/23 the Group's functions transferred to Te Whatu Ora (Health New Zealand) and Manatū Hauora (the Ministry of Health), who are responsible for the ongoing coordination of the COVID-19 response.\n\nThe functions of System Response, Readiness and Planning along with Insights and Reporting (including modelling, and geospatial analysis) transitioned to the Public Health Agency of Manatū Hauora on 31 October 2022.\n\nOn 16 November 2022, the COVID-19 Communications and Public Engagement work transitioned to Manatū Hauora – Ministry of Health and Te Whatu Ora – Health New Zealand, including responsibility for the Unite Against COVID-19 website and social media channels, which are now run by Te Whatu Ora.\n\nThe COVID-19 Group's Policy and Strategy coordination function transitioned to Manatū Hauora, on 29 March 2023, thereby concluding DPMCs formal role in the COVID-19 response.\n\nTimeline of Aotearoa New Zealand’s significant events and key All-of-Government activities\n\nA timeline covering the period from January 2020 to October 2022 that captures significant events and key All-of-Government (AoG) and public sector activities that contributed to Aotearoa New Zealand’s response to the pandemic.\n\nFurther information"
