        "text": "Public Health England (PHE) recognises the benefits of using data for the public good but also takes its responsibility for protecting confidentiality very seriously. We have a range of policies, protocols and processes in place to ensure the confidentiality of data is maintained at all times.\n\nThe Office for Data Release (ODR) is responsible for managing the release of explicitly identifiable or potentially identifiable data from PHE on behalf of the information asset owner to an agreed process and within a formal structure.\n\nNotice of a temporary pause to the ODR approval service\n\nPHE has provided data release functions since 2013 for a number of data resources. From 1 October, PHE will no longer exist and its data resources will transfer to other ‘receiver’ organisations. Data release functions will in future be the responsibility of those receiver organisations.\n\nWe are pausing the usual Office for Data Release (ODR) approval process from 1 September 2021 to focus on the handover of data applications to the new system.\n\nWe are already working closely with the successor organisations – NHS Digital, NHS England and NHS Improvement (NHSEI), Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) and UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) – towards a smooth transition, and have put in place a triage process to ensure that priority applications, particularly those related to the COVID-19 response, are managed swiftly. Any new applications received from 1 September will be logged, and all ‘in progress’ pre-applications and ‘applications paused’ will be addressed as soon as the transition process is complete.\n\nThe dissemination of data will continue where ODR approval has already been granted, with every effort made to fulfil these obligations before applications are transferred to receiver bodies on 1 October 2021:\n\napplications to access cancer registration data from the National Cancer Registration and Analysis Service will be passed to NHS Digital\n\napplications to access National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service data will be passed to NHS Digital\n\napplications to access Population Screening data will be passed to NHS England\n\napplications to access syndromic surveillance and other health protection data (including COVID-19) will be passed to UKHSA\n\napplications to access National Drug Treatment Monitoring System data will be passed to DHSC\n\nWe want to reassure all applicants (awaiting a decision or seeking advice) that over the coming weeks our focus will be on making sure that each receiver body has the information they need to support their current and future data applications, so that all ODR applicants can continue to build on the translational impact PHE data has had over the last 7 years.\n\nWe are working hard to ensure that future arrangements are robust and responsive and will be catching up with any paused applications as soon as possible.\n\nThank you for all your support and continuous cooperation."
