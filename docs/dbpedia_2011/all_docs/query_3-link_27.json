        "text": "Martin Luther was a German professor of theology, composer, priest, monk and seminal figure in the Protestant Reformation. On October 31, 1517, Luther wrote to his bishop, Albrecht von Brandenburg, protesting the sale of indulgences. He enclosed in his letter a copy of his \"Disputation of Martin Luther on the Power and Efficacy of Indulgences,” which came to be known as the 95 Theses.\n\nHans Hillerbrand writes that Luther had no intention of confronting the church, but saw his disputation as a scholarly objection to church practices, and that the tone of the writing is accordingly \"searching, rather than doctrinaire.” Deliberately or not, Luther overturned many of the bedrock assumptions of Western culture, instigating a revolution in human freedom that continues to shape the modern world.\n\nThomas Jefferson was an American Founding Father who was the principal author of the Declaration of Independence and later served as the third president of the United States, from 1801 to 1809. He drafted the law for religious freedom as a Virginia legislator. For nearly three years, he assisted with the constitution and was especially proud of his Bill for Establishing Religious Freedom, which forbade state support of religious institutions or enforcement of religious doctrine. The bill failed to pass, as did his legislation to disestablish the Anglican church, but both were later revived by James Madison.\n\nNational Religious Freedom Day commemorates the Virginia General Assembly's adoption of the landmark Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom on January 16, 1786.\n\nThe statute is a statement about both freedom of conscience and the principle of separation of church and state. It was written by Thomas Jefferson.\n\nThe Treaty of Tripoli was signed by President John Adams on June 10, 1797. The treaty included the statement: \"As the Government of the United States of America is not, in any sense, founded on the Christian religion; as it has in itself no character of enmity against the laws, religion, or tranquility, of Mussulmen [Muslims]; and as the said States never entered into any war or act of hostility against any Mahometan [Mohammedan] nation, it is declared by the parties that no pretext arising from religious opinions shall ever produce an interruption of the harmony existing between the countries.\"\n\nThe phrase \"separation between church and state\" is generally traced to a January 1, 1802, letter by Thomas Jefferson. The letter was addressed to the Danbury Baptist Association in Connecticut and published in a Massachusetts newspaper.\n\nJefferson wrote: “Believing with you that religion is a matter which lies solely between Man & his God, that he owes account to none other for his faith or his worship, that the legitimate powers of government reach actions only, & not opinions, I contemplate with sovereign reverence that act of the whole American people which declared that their legislature should \"make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof,\" thus building a wall of separation between Church & State. Adhering to this expression of the supreme will of the nation in behalf of the rights of conscience, I shall see with sincere satisfaction the progress of those sentiments which tend to restore to man all his natural rights, convinced he has no natural right in opposition to his social duties.”"
