        "text": "Chapter 1 Introduction#\n\nIntroduction#\n\nThis Guide provides an overview of the requirements of the Public Finance Act 1989 as most recently substantively amended in 2013 (the Act). Its primary audience is likely to be staff in Government departments, Offices of Parliament and others who need a working understanding of the Act. In addition it should be a useful reference for Crown entities, Schedule 4 organisations, Schedule 4A companies, Members of Parliament and their staff, and interested members of the public, including students and readers from other jurisdictions with an interest in public financial management in New Zealand.\n\nThe Guide focuses on the legislative requirements of the Act in relation to departments, Offices of Parliament and the Government as a whole. The more detailed requirements and expectations associated with the Act’s implementation are set out in more specific documents such as Treasury Instructions, Budget guidance or Cabinet and Treasury circulars, many of which can be found on the Treasury website.\n\nThe information in this Guide is provided for general information only and should not be treated or relied on as a substitute for proper legal or professional advice on the interpretation of particular legislative provisions or their application to particular circumstances or entities.\n\nUsing this guide#\n\nThis introductory chapter explains some general points or ideas that are central to interpreting and understanding the Act, starting with the principle of parliamentary control over public finances, and including the roles played by accrual accounting and independent audits. It also includes a list of websites containing information on aspects of public financial management in New Zealand.\n\nThe remaining chapters of this Guide follow the structure of the Act.\n\nChapter 2 discusses the purpose of appropriations (parliamentary authorisation for the incurrence of expenses and capital expenditure), the nature of the appropriation system, and reporting on what is achieved with appropriations. It focuses on the requirements of Part 1 of the Act.\n\nChapter 3 outlines the principles of responsible fiscal management and describes the fiscal reports and statements prepared in accordance with Part 2 of the Act.\n\nChapter 4 outlines the requirements for consolidated financial statements of the Government reporting entity set out in Part 3 of the Act.\n\nChapter 5 describes a departmental chief executive's financial management responsibilities and explains the role of external departmental reports in giving an account of a department's projected and actual financial and non-financial performance. The requirements of the Act in relation to departmental reports are set out in Part 4 of the Act while Subpart 1 of Part 5 deals with special reporting requirements for newly established and disestablished departments.\n\nChapter 6 outlines the requirements of Parts 6 and 7 of the Act. These parts deal with the borrowing of money, issuing of securities, use of derivative transactions, investment of funds, operation of bank accounts, giving of guarantees and indemnities, and the management of trust money.\n\nCharts are also provided to show how the key phases in the preparation of the budget by the Government relate to the parliamentary process, and to provide an indication of the timing of the budget.\n\nThe nature of parliamentary control of public finances#\n\nIn New Zealand's system of government, Parliament is the supreme law-making authority and ultimately provides authority for all governmental activity.\n\nOne of the prime means by which it is able to scrutinise and control the Government is through the regular process of granting financial authority to the Government. Section 22 of the Constitution Act 1986 makes this point explicitly, stating that it is not lawful for the Crown (the legal person in whose name the Government acts) to levy a tax, borrow money, or spend public money except by or under an Act of Parliament.\n\nThe Public Finance Act provides the core legislative framework within which the Government can borrow money or spend public money. This framework provides for both the rights of Parliament to give informed authority for, and scrutiny of, government borrowing and activity, and the need for the Executive to have sufficient ability to effectively and responsively manage the affairs of the Government.\n\nLegislation governing the use of public financial resources#\n\nThe Public Finance Act exists to govern the use of public financial resources, notably to:\n\nprovide a framework for parliamentary authorisation and scrutiny of the Government's expenditure proposals and the Government's management of its assets and liabilities\n\nestablish lines of responsibility for effective and efficient management and use of public financial resources\n\nspecify the principles for responsible fiscal management in the conduct of fiscal policy and require regular reporting on the extent to which the Government's fiscal policy is consistent with those principles\n\nspecify the minimum financial and non-financial reporting obligations of Ministers, departments, Offices of Parliament and certain other agencies\n\nprovide for the application of financial management incentives and for the accountability of specified central government organisations\n\nsafeguard public assets by providing statutory authority and control for the borrowing of money, issuing of securities, use of derivative transactions, investment of funds, operation of bank accounts and giving of guarantees and indemnities\n\nplace limits on the ownership of mixed ownership model companies, and\n\nname Schedule 4 organisations, Schedule 4A companies and identify the sections of the Crown Entities Act 2004 that apply to them.\n\nThere is no further information in this guide about mixed ownership model companies or Schedule 4 organisations and Schedule 4A companies. More information about Schedule 4A companies (and Machinery of Government more generally) can be found on the SSC website[1]. Further information about mixed ownership model companies (and the Crown's commercial portfolio) can be found on the Treasury website[2].\n\nThe Public Finance Act is not the only Act that establishes requirements for the use of public resources.\n\nThe State Sector Act 1988 sets out the foundations for the state sector system, including the appointment, responsibilities, duties and powers of chief executives. In addition, it establishes the role, functions and powers of the State Services Commissioner, including their responsibility for developing senior leadership and management capability in the public service. The Act also provides for various workforce and personnel matters, including how the Employment Relations Act 2000 applies in relation to the Public Service and the education service.\n\nThe Public Audit Act 2001 provides for the Controller and Auditor-General (the Auditor-General) to be an Officer of Parliament and sets out the law relating to the audit of public sector organisations. The Auditor-General provides independent assurance to Parliament and the public that public sector organisations are operating and accounting for their performance in accordance with Parliament’s intentions.\n\nThe Crown Entities Act 2004 provides a consistent framework for the establishment, governance, and operation of Crown entities and to clarify accountability relationships between Crown entities, their board members, their responsible Ministers on behalf of the Crown, and the House of Representatives. The Act provides for different categories of Crown entities with each category having its own framework for governance, clarifies the powers and duties of board members in respect of the governance and operation of Crown entities and sets out reporting and accountability requirements for Crown entities.\n\nThe State-Owned Enterprises Act 1986 (SOE Act) outlines the principles governing the operation of state enterprises and establishes requirements for the accountability of state enterprises and the responsibility of Ministers.\n\nBroad principles#\n\nSince the late 1980s, New Zealand's public sector management system has focussed on promoting public sector performance. Details of New Zealand's reforms are well documented elsewhere[3]. This performance management approach emphasises, among other things, clear objectives and clear lines of responsibility, greater freedom to manage, and a corresponding expectation of greater accountability for results. Such a system requires good measures of performance that interested external parties can trust. In the areas of financial reporting, budgeting and budget controls, the Public Finance Act attempts to meet these objectives by requiring the Government and all public sector entities to prepare financial information that:\n\nuses accrual accounting concepts and statements\n\nis in accordance with financial reporting standards approved by an independent standard setter, and\n\nin the case of annual financial statements, complies with generally accepted accounting practice (GAAP) and is audited by an independent auditor.\n\nThese key principles, which are applied throughout the Public Finance Act, are explained in more detail below.\n\nAccrual accounting concepts and statements#\n\nEach individual reporting entity (for example, a department) and the Government as a whole prepare financial forecasts and statements using the accrual basis of accounting.\n\nThe following table summarises the features of these reports.\n\nDepartments and Offices of Parliament\n\n(Refer Chapter 5) Whole of Government\n\n(Refer Chapter 4) Financial Statements Annual financial statements\n\nAccrual basis\n\nComply with GAAP\n\nAudited Monthly and annual consolidated financial statements\n\nAccrual basis\n\nComply with GAAP\n\nAnnual statements are audited Financial Forecasts Prepared on the same basis as the financial statements Prepared on the same basis as the financial statements\n\nThe accrual basis of accounting was adopted by the New Zealand Government because it provides a more comprehensive set of information than cash accounting. It supports the Government's commitment to provide comprehensive and transparent financial reports.\n\nFor example, accrual financial statements provide information on:\n\nassets, including physical and intangible assets\n\nliabilities including amounts owed to suppliers, and long term obligations such as accumulated employee leave entitlement, outstanding insurance claims and unfunded pension liabilities\n\nthe overall financial position of the individual entity or the Government\n\nthe impact of exchange-rate, interest rate and other movements as a result of market conditions on the value of financial assets and liabilities\n\nthe full cost of goods and services used or consumed within a given period, regardless of when ordered, received or paid for, and\n\ncash flows during the period are reported in a separate statement.\n\nAccrual information is less subject to manipulation than cash information. Because the accrual basis recognises expenses when they are incurred rather than when they are paid, there are limited incentives to shift payments between periods inappropriately.\n\nAn accrual budgeting system focuses on costs to be incurred rather than funds to be obligated or spent. Accrual budgets provide a more comprehensive financial picture of proposed activities and the impact of those proposals on the operating costs of individual entities.\n\nParliamentary authority for budget (appropriations) is also expressed in accrual terms. Accrual appropriations mean that Parliament’s control is effectively exerted at the point at which an obligation is incurred, which is usually prior to when the flow of cash occurs. Authorisation of total expenses ensures that the total level of Government activity is transparent to Parliament. Any incentive to favour activities with non-cash costs or delayed cash costs is avoided.\n\nSome key dates associated with the adoption of accrual accounting are shown below.\n\nKey dates\n\n1989: The Public Finance Act 1989 specified requirements for accrual budgeting and financial reporting by departments. Government departments began to report in accordance with accrual accounting. Whole-of-government flows (for example, taxes and transfer payments) were still budgeted and forecast on a cash basis.\n\nDecember 1991: New Zealand became one of the first governments in the world to prepare consolidated financial statements on an accrual basis.\n\n1994: The Fiscal Responsibility Act 1994 required accrual-based budgeted and actual information at the whole-of-government level. The government's first accrual-based fiscal forecasts based on GAAP were published in June 2004.\n\nIndependent accounting standards#\n\nThe Act requires that the financial statements (and financial forecasts) of the Government and each individual department be prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting practice (GAAP) in New Zealand. GAAP is an objective and independent set of rules that governs the recognition and measurement of financial elements such as assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. For example, GAAP requires that expenses and revenue be shown separately except in the limited circumstances where GAAP permits offsets.\n\nThe financial reporting standards that are the core of GAAP in New Zealand are approved by the External Reporting Board (XRB) - an independent body established by the Government. The XRB approves financial reporting standards for application by both the public and private sectors.\n\nThe Government uses independently established rules for financial reporting in order to give users of reports a high level of confidence in the relevance and reliability of the information. The alternative, the Government setting its own standards, was rejected because of the credibility issues that this would raise.\n\nNotwithstanding the special characteristics of Government, the Government applies similar financial reporting standards as applied by other reporting entities in New Zealand. This means that public sector financial statements can be more readily understood by a wide range of people. It has also allowed the Government to recruit accountants from the private sector and enhanced the ability of accountants to move from one sector to the other.\n\nThe approval of New Zealand equivalents to International Financial Reporting Standards by the Accounting Standards Review Board (the predecessor body of the XRB) in 2004 has led to even greater harmonisation of New Zealand’s financial reporting standards with international standards.\n\nWhat is GAAP?\n\nSection 8 of the Financial Reporting Act 2013 states that financial statements, group financial statements, a report, or other information complies with generally accepted accounting practice (GAAP) only if the report, statements, or information comply with:\n\napplicable financial reporting standards (within the meaning of section 2 of the Act); and\n\nin relation to matters for which no provision is made in applicable financial reporting standards, an authoritative notice (within the meaning of section 2 of the Act).\n\nApproved financial reporting standards are those financial reporting standards and interpretations approved by the External Reporting Board (XRB). The XRB has approved separate standards for profit, Public sector and not-for-profit entities. Where transactions and events are not covered by an approved standard, the Board may designate other standards and guidance as having authoritative support for the accounting profession in New Zealand.\n\nSome key dates associated with the development of GAAP are shown below\n\nKey dates\n\n1993: The Financial Reporting Act established an independent body, the Accounting Standards Review Board (ASRB), to approve accounting standards in New Zealand, independently of the accounting profession, Ministers, the Treasury or the Audit office. A sector neutral approach was adopted.\n\n2003: The new accounting standard for consolidated financial reporting (FRS 37) was adopted, requiring line-by-line consolidation of all controlled government entities.\n\n2007: The basis of accounting standards in New Zealand moved to International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). The Government adopted New Zealand IFRS reporting.\n\n2011: A new independent Crown entity, the External Reporting Board (XRB) was created with full authority to develop accounting standards independently of the accounting profession. At its first meeting it confirmed the proposals of its predecessor body, the ASRB, to adopt a multi sector standard setting approach.\n\n2014: The basis of accounting standards in New Zealand moved to International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS). This was a move from a sector neutral approach to a multi-sector approach. The Government adopted Public Benefit Entity (PBE) IPSAS.\n\nComparability\n\nAs discussed above, the accrual basis of accounting and the associated GAAP rules on recognition and measurement guide the preparation of financial statements, budgets and forecast financial statements, and the associated parliamentary authorisation of budgets. The consistent application of the same accounting rules and policies between these sets of financial information permit direct comparisons between forecast and actual results and information over time.\n\nGAAP requires that entities disclose the accounting policies applied and details of any changes in policies from the previous reporting period. This enhances the comparability of information between entities.\n\nIndependent audit#\n\nPublic sector organisations are accountable to Parliament for their use of public resources and the exercise of powers conferred by Parliament. As part of its accountability requirements, Parliament seeks independent assurance that public sector organisations are operating, and accounting for their performance, in accordance with Parliament's intentions.\n\nThe Auditor-General provides this independent assurance to both Parliament and the public.\n\nOffices of Parliament#\n\nThere are currently three Offices of Parliament as defined in the Public Finance Act (section 2(1)): the Office of the Controller and Auditor-General, the Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment and the Office of the Ombudsmen.\n\nThe requirements of the Act in relation to departments are modified slightly to acknowledge that Offices of Parliament act on behalf of Parliament. For example, the Speaker of the House of Representatives is the responsible Minister in respect of an Office of Parliament[4].\n\nThe appropriations for Offices of Parliament are determined not by the Government, but by Parliament on the recommendation of the Officers of Parliament Committee. They are commended by way of an address by the House of Representatives to the Governor General (section 26E).\n\nIntelligence and security departments#\n\nThe requirements of the Act in relation to these departments are modified to address needs of national security. For example, intelligence and security departments each administer one aggregated appropriation for both expenses and capital expenditure.\n\nThere are currently two intelligence and security departments:\n\nthe New Zealand Security Intelligence Service, and\n\nthe Government Communications Security Bureau.\n\nNotes\n\n[1] http://www.ssc.govt.nz/reviewing-mog [Treasury adjusted URL at July 2024 https://www.publicservice.govt.nz/system/system-architecture-and-design/how-the-public-sector-is-organised/]\n\n[2] https://treasury.govt.nz/information-and-services/commercial-portfolio-and-advice/commercial-portfolio/types-commercial-crown-entities\n\n[3] See for example NZ Treasury (1987), Scott et al (1997), Scott (2001), Boston et al (1996), Hughes (2012), Pollitt & Bouckaert (2011).\n\n[4] The Speaker is also the responsible Minister for the Office of the Clerk of the House of Representatives and the Parliamentary Service.\n\nChapter 2 Appropriations#\n\nKey Points#\n\nNo expenses or capital expenditure may be incurred unless in accordance with an appropriation or other statutory authority.\n\nAppropriations are limitations of amount, scope and period. These limits are legally binding. All expenses and capital expenditure may be incurred only in accordance with these specifications, except in the limited circumstances where the Act permits some variation to appropriations.\n\nAppropriations are also specified by type of expense or capital expenditure. The types of appropriations are output expenses, benefits or related expenses, borrowing expenses, other expenses, capital expenditure, multi-category appropriations, and expenses and capital expenditure of an intelligence and security department.\n\nThe Auditor-General audits appropriations used and administered by departments and Offices of Parliament to ensure that expenses and capital expenditure have been incurred in accordance with appropriations.\n\nIntroduction#\n\nThis Chapter:\n\nexplains what an appropriation is and the purpose of appropriations\n\ndescribes the legislative process for appropriations and the link between appropriations and the budget process\n\noutlines the responsibilities of Ministers, departments and the Treasury in relation to appropriations\n\ndescribes the various types of appropriations, the requirements in relation to specifying and using these appropriations and the consequences of breaching the limits of an appropriation\n\nexplains how the usual appropriation requirements are varied in respect of Offices of Parliament and intelligence and security departments, and\n\nexplains how the controller function operates.\n\nConstitutional role#\n\nTraditionally, in Westminster-based parliamentary systems, the Crown may tax, borrow or spend only as authorised by Parliament. Parliament's initial focus was on controlling the right to tax but it subsequently exerted control over spending as well. These constitutional principles developed over a number of centuries and were the subject of much conflict between Parliament and the Crown[5].\n\nNew Zealand has adopted these constitutional principles. Under section 22 of the Constitution Act 1986 it is unlawful for the Crown to spend any public money unless it has been authorised by an Act of Parliament. Annual Appropriation Acts which specify the nature and amount of appropriations are the main way in which Parliament authorises the use of resources by the Crown and Offices of Parliament.\n\nSince 1989, appropriations have been accrual-based. This means that parliamentary control is exerted at the point at which a financial obligation is entered into, rather than at the point when that obligation is discharged or paid. This makes parliamentary control more effective. The appropriation constraint is applied at the point when the decision to incur a liability is actioned; the constraint doesn’t act as a possible barrier to settling properly incurred liabilities.\n\nSection 4 states that expenses or capital expenditure must not be incurred unless authorised by an appropriation or other statutory authority.\n\nSection 5 states that public money must not be spent unless in accordance with statutory authority.\n\nSection 6 authorises the spending of public money to meet expenses or capital expenditure incurred in accordance with appropriations - that is, section 6 links the spending of public money to appropriations.\n\nWhat is an appropriation?#\n\nAn appropriation is the means by which Parliament gives legal authority to the Crown and Offices of Parliament to use resources. Appropriation Acts are the primary mechanism by which Parliament authorises Ministers to incur (on the Crown’s behalf) expenses and capital expenditure in the day-to-day administration of government.[6]\n\nAppropriations are a constraining authority only - there is no obligation on the Crown to incur any expense as a result of being granted an appropriation. On the other hand, overspending and transfers between appropriations are strictly governed by the requirements of the Public Finance Act.\n\nAn appropriation is a constraint not a promise of funding\n\nAppropriations represent an authority to incur expenses or capital expenditures. They are a constraint rather than a promise to deliver funding for expenditure.\n\nThe amount of an appropriation is not necessarily the same as the cash disbursed to a department, nor is it necessarily the same as the revenue the department may earn. For example:\n\nMinisters may decide not to incur expenses or capital expenditure for which appropriations exist. In such cases revenue and funding may be withheld.\n\nAn appropriation may be for an amount which includes a non-cash expense such as depreciation or the cost of goods and services purchased by a department but not yet paid for.\n\nDespite having cash available, a department may not incur an expense unless it has an appropriation or other statutory authority (for example, a department that has generated third party revenue in excess of forecasts is generally unable to use the additional revenue without further approval).\n\nThe legislative process#\n\nThe Public Finance Act specifies the appropriation-related documents that are required to be presented to the House of Representatives at the time the Government’s budget is presented to the House on Budget day.[7] These documents include:\n\nan Appropriation Bill (section 7), and\n\nthe Estimates and any other supporting information (sections 13-15F).\n\nAppropriation Bills\n\nAn Appropriation Bill sets out the details of each annual and multi-year appropriation in accordance with the Public Finance Act. In addition to the main Appropriation Bill introduced in conjunction with the Budget, there may be additional Appropriation Bills during the financial year (a financial year runs from 1 July to 30 June).\n\nAuthorisations for changes to appropriations are outlined in an Appropriation (Supplementary Estimates) Bill that is introduced and generally passed towards the end of the financial year. There may be more than one Supplementary Estimates Bill but this is very rare.\n\nSubsequent authorisation for spending that has occurred without proper authority is sought by way of the Appropriation (Confirmation and Validation) Bill. This Bill is introduced to the House in the following financial year.\n\nThe Minister of Finance must present a report alongside the Appropriation (Confirmation and Validation) Bill that sets out, for each item where confirmation and validation is sought, the amount of each category of expenses or capital expenditure incurred and/or capital injections made, and an explanation from the relevant Minister for the expenses, capital expenditure or capital injection.\n\nA diagram outlining the possible timing of various Appropriation Bills and Imprest Supply Bills in a typical year is shown at the end of this guide.\n\nEstimates\n\nThe Estimates is a document that provides information on each appropriation in an Appropriation Bill. For each appropriation the Estimates include details of the Vote, appropriation Minister, appropriation administrator and appropriation type, amount, scope and period. In the case of a multi-category appropriation, the Estimates states the single over-arching purpose of the appropriation. The Estimates also identifies the responsible Minister for each department and the amount of capital injections authorised to be made to the department for the financial year (section 14). The Crown must not make a capital injection to a department (other than an intelligence and security department) unless authorised under an Appropriation Act”?\n\nSupporting information must also be provided to the House. This supporting information includes:\n\nexplanations of what is intended to be achieved with each appropriation\n\nexplanations of how performance against each appropriation will be assessed\n\nwhere and by whom performance will be reported\n\ncomparative budgeted and estimated actual expenses or capital expenditure for the previous financial year, and\n\ninformation on appropriations authorised by a permanent legislative authority in an Act other than an Appropriation Act (section 15A).\n\nFor multi-category appropriations, in addition to providing this information about the appropriation as a whole, this other supporting information includes explanations of what each category is intended to achieve, projected expenses or non-departmental capital-expenditure for each category, and comparative projected and estimated actual expenses or non-departmental capital expenditure for each category for the previous financial year (section 15A(3).\n\nFor capital injections, the supporting information must identify the department to which the capital injection is to be made, what the capital injection is intended to be used for, and the amount of the capital injection (section15E).\n\nThis supporting information is intended to provide both a clear description of what the appropriation Minister intends to achieve with appropriated expenditure for the year, and a measure against which Parliament and the wider public can assess performance at the end of the year.\n\nAlthough previously this supporting information could be presented in a separate document, the 2013 amendments to the Act require that it must now be included in the same document as the Estimates.\n\nA Supplementary Estimates document is also presented with each Appropriation (Supplementary Estimates) Bill (section 16). Information on all changes to the information provided in the main Estimates as a consequence of the Appropriation (Supplementary Estimates) Bill must be provided. That is, full information on appropriations that were not in the main Estimates, and additional or changed information on appropriations that were in the main Estimates (section 17).\n\nSupporting information relating to child poverty\n\nFrom Budget 2019 onwards, a report on Child Poverty must accompany the main appropriation bill (section 15EA). This report must:\n\ndiscuss any progress made, in the most recent completed financial year, in reducing child poverty consistent with the targets under the Child Poverty Reduction Act 2018, and\n\nindicate whether and, if so, to what extent, measures in or related to the main appropriation bill will affect child poverty.\n\nImprest supply legislation\n\nImprest supply is a statutory mechanism that allows Parliament to provide the Government with the authority to incur expenses or capital expenditure, or make capital injections, in advance of appropriation or authorisation by way of an Appropriation Act.[8] Imprest supply is required for two reasons:\n\nthe main Appropriation Bill for the year is not normally passed until September, the third month of the new financial year, and\n\nthe changing nature of Government activities and unexpected demands means it is impossible to adequately foresee all future expenses and capital expenditure by the time the main Appropriation Bill is finalised for introduction.\n\nThe first Imprest Supply Bill is introduced and passed prior to the beginning of the financial year. It provides the sole financial authority from the start of the financial year until the Appropriation (Estimates) Bill for that year is passed (normally within four months of the Budget being presented).\n\nThe second Imprest Supply Bill seeks financial authority additional to that provided in the Appropriation (Estimates) Act. It is introduced on the day of the third reading of the Appropriation (Estimates) Bill and is debated simultaneously with that third reading debate. The second Imprest Supply Bill ensures that the Government has sufficient supply to implement decisions taken after the Main Estimates were finalised and to meet any increases in demand-driven expenses or other risks or contingencies in excess of the amounts appropriated in the Appropriation (Estimates) Act. Appropriations for expenses and capital expenditure incurred, and authorisations for any capital injections made, under the authority of the second Imprest Supply Bill are sought in the Appropriation (Supplementary Estimates) Bill.\n\nBudget process#\n\nAs well as being an instrument of parliamentary control, appropriations are also one of the most important levers of control Ministers have to implement their policies. Appropriation limits cannot be exceeded without appropriate approval and subsequent ratification, and appropriations may be used only in accordance with their specified scope. By agreeing the appropriations to be submitted to Parliament, Ministers are determining both the extent and nature of government activity in the year ahead.\n\nThe requirements of the Act influence many aspects of the Budget process. For example:\n\nthe expenditure baselines that project government expenditure forward into future years are framed by current appropriation specifications, and\n\nwhen considering proposals for changes to expenditure baselines for items such as new budget initiatives, departments will make financial recommendations and Ministers will record decisions on those recommendations.\n\nRole and responsibility of Ministers#\n\nMinisters are responsible to Parliament for the use of appropriations as designated in the Estimates. They retain this responsibility, although they may delegate the authority given by those appropriations to departmental chief executives. This is illustrated by the requirement for Ministers to provide an explanation for any unauthorised spending.\n\nAppropriations are grouped together in Votes. Parliament authorises the Minister or Ministers responsible for appropriations (the appropriation Minister/s) within a Vote to incur the expenses or capital expenditure outlined in the appropriations. Although different Ministers may be responsible for different appropriations within a Vote, each Vote is administered by one department (the appropriation administrator).\n\nDistinct from the appropriation Minister, the Act states that the “responsible Minister” is:\n\nin relation to an Office of Parliament, to the Office of the Clerk of the House of Representatives, or to the Parliamentary Service, the Speaker\n\nin relation to any other department, the Minister responsible for the financial performance of the department\n\nin relation to a Schedule 4 organisation, the Minister responsible for the financial performance of the organisation, or\n\nin relation to a Schedule 4A company, the Minister of Finance and the other shareholding Minister(s) (section 2).\n\nDepartments' role in managing appropriations#\n\nPrior to the start of the financial year, departments are responsible for providing to the Treasury information necessary to prepare the Estimates and Supplementary Estimates (section 19).\n\nDuring the financial year, they are responsible for carrying out their activities in accordance with appropriations. As well as appropriations covering the expenses and capital expenditure of the department, they may also be responsible for administering appropriations for expenses or capital expenditure to be incurred directly by the Crown, for example, appropriations for outputs provided by entities other than departments or Offices of Parliament, or for benefits or related expenses.\n\nDepartments must ensure that all expenses and capital expenditure (both departmental and non-departmental) are in accordance with the authority provided. They therefore need to be vigilant to ensure that:\n\nappropriations are not exceeded unless the overspending is explicitly approved under another provision, and\n\nspending against an appropriation is within the scope (legal boundary) of the appropriation.\n\nRegular exception reporting is required to highlight potential breaches of appropriations and to allow either corrective action to be taken or appropriate authority to be sought prior to any overspending occurring. Departments must report monthly (from September) to Treasury on the use of appropriations.\n\nAfter the end of the financial year, departments' annual reports must contain a statement of budgeted and actual expenses and capital expenditure incurred against each appropriation they administer, and against each category of expenses or non-departmental capital expenditure included in any multi-category appropriations they administer. Departments’ annual reports must also contain a statement of any unappropriated expenses and capital expenditure, together with an explanation of the reasons for the unappropriated expenditure (section 45A).\n\nThe appropriation process represents an external control exerted on the executive by the legislature. In addition to this statutory authority process, there is an internal authorisation process whereby Cabinet delegates financial reporting standards to appropriation Ministers and departmental chief executives. Chief executives have authority to spend within the limits defined by Cabinet. There are specific limits for defined areas of financial commitment, expense or expenditure that Cabinet considers present a high level of risk for the Government (details of these authorities and limits are determined and promulgated by Cabinet).\n\nRole and responsibility of Treasury#\n\nThe Treasury is responsible for:\n\npreparing budget documents, including the Appropriation Bills, Estimates and Imprest Supply Bills\n\nmonitoring the need for and the use of imprest supply\n\npreparing the monthly monitoring report on appropriations for the Auditor-General, and\n\nobtaining assurance that there is an adequate system of internal control designed to provide reasonable assurance that transactions are within statutory authority and reporting on that to Parliament.\n\nThe Treasury may request information\n\nIn order for the Treasury to prepare budget documents the Act provides for the Treasury to request, from departments and specified entities, information that is necessary for the preparation of the Appropriation Bills, Estimates and supporting information.\n\nEnd-of-year performance information on appropriations#\n\nDepartments are primarily responsible for reporting on what was achieved with expenditure. Departments also report progress on achieving their strategic intentions in an annual report.\n\nThe information supporting the Estimates must include descriptions of “what is intended to be achieved” and “how performance will be assessed” for each appropriation. These descriptions provide the basis for end-of-year performance reporting on what was achieved with appropriations.\n\nEnd-of-year performance information must include:\n\nan assessment of what has been achieved with each appropriation in the financial year, and\n\na comparison of the actual expenses or capital expenditure incurred with the expenses or capital expenditure that were forecast to be incurred (section 19C).\n\nFor multi-category appropriations, the above information must also be provided for each category of expenses or capital expenditure within that appropriation (section 19C(2)).\n\nThe information supporting the Estimates must also identify who will report on the performance of appropriations and in which document end-of-year performance information for each appropriation will be provided. The performance reporter could be an appropriation Minister, department, departmental agency, Office of Parliament, Crown entity, Schedule 4 organisation (but not including a Reserves Board) or a Schedule 4A company. Performance information may be provided in an annual report, a sector report, a report to the House covering the performance of a particular initiative, or any other appropriate report which provides clear and meaningful performance information.\n\nWhere the appropriation Minister has been identified as the performance reporter, end-of-year performance information must be prepared and presented to the House within 4 months of the end of the financial year (section 19B(2)). The Act does not require a Minister’s performance report to be audited.\n\nWhere a department, departmental agency, Office of Parliament, Crown entity, Schedule 4 organisation (but not including a Reserves Board) or a Schedule 4A company has been identified as the performance reporter, performance information must be prepared as soon as practicable after the end of the financial year (section 19A(2)).\n\nEnd-of-year performance information must be prepared in accordance with GAAP, to the extent that the information is of a form or nature for which provision is made in financial reporting standards that form part of GAAP (section 19C(3)). The XRB has issued the financial reporting standard PBE FRS 48 “Service Performance Reporting” for this purpose.\n\nParliamentary scrutiny and reporting#\n\nParliament scrutinises the Executive's spending proposals by way of debate and select committee examination in accordance with the procedures set out in the Standing Orders of the House of Representatives.\n\nFollowing the delivery of the Budget Speech, there is an immediate debate on the Budget. The Estimates are allocated by the Finance and Expenditure Select Committee among the various subject select committees for examination. Select committees can examine documents and require the attendance of individuals, including Ministers and officials.\n\nEach select committee to which a Vote or part of a Vote is referred requires the appropriation Minister concerned to answer a detailed questionnaire about plans for the coming financial year. The select committee hears evidence from senior officers of the department and, often, from the appropriation Minister before reporting back to the House. Standing Orders require select committees to report back on the Estimates within ten weeks of the delivery of the Budget. The reports of select committees on Estimates are then considered by the House in a series of debates known as the Estimates debate.\n\nAlthough Parliament authorises appropriations, it is the Government's role to initiate the appropriations process. Also, under the financial veto rule (contained in Standing Orders) the Government can veto proposed amendments to the Estimates that, in its view, would have more than a minor impact on the composition of a Vote.\n\nAfter the end of the financial year select committees also conduct annual reviews of public entities, such as departments, departmental agencies, Crown entities, and state-owned enterprises. Select committees examine entities’ annual reports and assess what has been achieved with expenditure from appropriations. Annual reports are discussed in full in Chapter 5.\n\nSupplementary Estimates are also examined by select committee, usually the Finance and Expenditure Select Committee. Standing Orders provide that only the second reading of the Appropriation (Supplementary Estimates) Bill is debated unless the Minister of Finance proposes an amendment or a select committee which examined the Supplementary Estimates recommended a change to a Vote. The Appropriation (Confirmation and Validation) Bill, which seeks retrospective approval for overspending, is also debated only once, in committee of the whole House. This is known as the annual review debate.\n\nSelect Committee review of departmental documents is discussed in Chapter 5.\n\nDimensions of appropriations#\n\nAppropriations are specified using the following four dimensions:\n\namount\n\nscope\n\ntype, and\n\nperiod.\n\nAmount#\n\nAppropriations are limited by amount (section 8). Appropriations are generally for a fixed amount (one exception being revenue dependent appropriations described later in this chapter in the section on Flexibilities in appropriations) and specified in New Zealand dollars.\n\nAppropriation amounts generally exclude goods and services tax (GST) - this reflects the fact that GST is not generally an expense to the Crown and is consistent with the basis on which fiscal forecasts and financial statements are presented. Section 6 provides authority for the actual payment of GST.\n\nBecause the Crown has no control over movements in the market price of assets it would be inappropriate to require losses caused by changes in the market value of assets or liabilities (termed remeasurements in the Act) to require appropriation by Parliament before being incurred. Such expenses are therefore exempted from the requirement for appropriation.\n\nHowever, appropriations are required where:\n\nministerial decisions or actions cause unfavourable changes in the carrying amounts of assets or liabilities. Such changes require an appropriation (the section 2(1) definition of a remeasurement excludes such changes), and\n\nthe Government, or a department acting on the Government's wishes, disposes of an asset at less than fair value. The difference between fair value and the consideration received is essentially a grant or a gift and, as such, requires authorisation.\n\nScope#\n\nAppropriation limited by scope\n\nThe authority to incur expenses or capital expenditure provided by an appropriation-\n\nis limited to the scope of the appropriation; and\n\nmay not be used for any other purpose.\n\nFor the purposes of subsection (1),-\n\nthe scope of a multi-category appropriation is the scope of each of the individual categories\n\nof expenses or non-departmental capital expenditure included in that appropriation; and\n\nany variation made by the Minister of the terms and conditions of a capital injection to any entity referred to in section 27(3)(a) to (f) does not change the scope or purpose of that capital injection.\n\nAll appropriations are limited by scope (section 9). The scope of an appropriation determines the permitted uses to which that appropriation can be put, and any conditions on that use.\n\nAlthough not specified in the legislation there are a number of expectations about scope in practice. The scope sets the legal boundary for what an appropriation can be spent on. Accordingly, any statement of scope for an appropriation needs to be sufficiently specific about the range of activities, actions or functions covered to allow an external judgement to be made about whether the Crown has complied with its terms. It also needs to reflect the type of appropriation to which it is allocated. It should be sufficiently specific to act as an effective constraint against non-authorised activity, but not to inappropriately constrain activity that is intended to be authorised by the appropriation.\n\nType#\n\nDifferent types of expenditure have different features when being scrutinised for effectiveness and efficiency. Therefore, each appropriation must be allocated to specified types of expense or capital expenditure. The types of appropriation are:\n\noutput expenses\n\nbenefits or related expenses\n\nborrowing expenses\n\nother expenses\n\ncapital expenditure\n\nmulti-category appropriations (MCAs), and\n\nexpenses and capital expenditure of an intelligence and security department.\n\nEach type of appropriation is discussed below.\n\nOutput expenses\n\nOutput expense appropriations authorise expenses to be incurred by departments or other entities in supplying outputs to parties external to the entity. The expenses authorised include both direct expenses and indirect expenses allocated to those outputs.\n\nOutput expense appropriations encourage the Government and Parliament to focus on the goods and services to be delivered by an entity in respect of the appropriations. They permit attention to be directed to the value obtained from government expenditure as much as how that expenditure was made. They also provide departments with autonomy in determining the appropriate input mix, and where necessary, to alter that input mix during the period.\n\nWhat are outputs?\n\nOutputs, as defined by the Act:\n\nmeans goods or services that are supplied by a department, Crown entity, Office of Parliament, or other person or body; and\n\nincludes goods or services that a department, Crown entity, Office of Parliament, or other person or body has agreed or contracted to supply on a contingent basis, but that have not been supplied.\n\nExamples of outputs include delivery of services (such as health and disability services), administration of benefits, and policy advice.\n\nAn output class can either be supplied by a department (ie, a departmental output expense) or to, or on behalf of, the Crown (ie, a non-departmental output expense).\n\nA department's chief executive is responsible for what is achieved with departmental output expense appropriations and can decide whether to make the required outputs in-house or buy them in.\n\nNon-departmental output expense appropriations are where a Minister has decided to use a supplier other than a department to provide an output. Most commonly these appropriations fund Crown entities and non-governmental organisations (NGOs).\n\nOutput scope statements are required for each output expense. The Treasury provides guidance to assist in determining the scope of output expenses. In general terms the scope of an output expense should:\n\nhave an external focus\n\ncover goods or services that are similar in nature\n\nnot cover goods or services covered by other output expense scopes\n\nbe comprehensive\n\nbe verifiable\n\nbe controllable by the agency, and\n\nbe informative.\n\nOutput expense appropriations are for the expenses to be incurred by the Crown and Offices of Parliament. In the case of departments, which are not separate legal entities from the Crown, the expense to be incurred by the Crown is the same as the expense to be incurred by the department.\n\nIn the case of external entities, the expense to be incurred by the Crown is the amount the Crown has agreed to pay the entity for the outputs or to reimburse the expenses to be incurred by the entity in supplying the outputs. The scope of an output expense appropriation should specify whether the appropriation is authorising the reimbursement of expenses or whether it is authorising the price to be paid for goods and services. The distinction is important as the cost may not equal the price and this affects the accountabilities between the two cases.\n\nBenefits or related expenses\n\nBenefits or related expenses are transfers incurred by a Minister on behalf of the Crown generally to other parties for their benefit. The Crown receives nothing directly in return for making this type of payment. Examples include social security benefits and student allowances.\n\nBorrowing expenses\n\nBorrowing expenses include interest and other financing expenses for loans or public securities. Borrowing expenses are managed by the Treasury on behalf of the Minister of Finance.\n\nThe scope statement for a borrowing expense appropriation should identify the borrowing to which the expenses relate.\n\nOther expenses\n\n“Other expenses” is a residual type of appropriation intended to provide authority for expenses that are not covered by one of the previous expense appropriation types.\n\nWhat are other expenses?\n\nOther expenses, as defined by the Act, means any expenses incurred by the Crown, a department, or an Office of Parliament that are other than:\n\noutput expenses; or\n\nbenefits or related expenses; or\n\nborrowing expenses (section 2(1)).\n\nMost “other expenses” appropriations are non-departmental, such as subscriptions for memberships of international organisations. However, a department may incur non-output related expenses such as costs associated with a restructuring that would be authorised by way of an “other expenses” appropriation.\n\nThe scope statement for “other expenses” will vary depending upon the nature of the expense. As with other types of appropriations, the scope for other expenses should be specific enough to act as an effective constraint against non-authorised activity, but not to inappropriately constrain activity that is intended to be authorised by the appropriation.\n\nCapital expenditure\n\nCapital expenditure is defined by the Act as the cost of assets acquired or developed.\n\nDepartments are authorised to incur capital expenditure by using the proceeds of the sale or disposal of any of its assets, together with any working capital held (section 24). Essentially this allows a department to maintain its capability and “manage its own balance sheet”.\n\nThe effective constraint on capital expenditure without further appropriation by departments (other than intelligence and security departments) is therefore the total amount of its net worth or net assets and its working capital. Any capital injection intended to increase a department’s working capital must, except in emergencies (see pg. 28), be authorised by Parliament in an Appropriation Act (section 12A).\n\nCapital expenditure that requires approval by way of annual appropriation includes:\n\nthe cost of the acquisition of any ownership interest in other entities (for example, the purchase of shares in a State-owned enterprise or other entity)\n\nthe cost of the purchase or construction of a tangible asset, such as land for a national park, by the Government\n\nthe cost of the purchase of an intangible asset, such as fishing quotas, by the Government, and\n\nthe cost of the purchase or creation of a financial asset (for example, by making an advance to a Crown entity) but not including the investment of public money by the Treasury on deposit in a bank or in public securities[9].\n\nThe scope for non-departmental capital expenditure appropriations must be explicit about the capital item being purchased or developed.\n\nMulti-category appropriations\n\nThe 2013 amendments to the Act included a new provision for multi-category appropriations (MCAs). MCAs allow greater flexibility to the Crown to allocate resources to where they can best contribute to a purpose, while retaining transparency of both what has been delivered and the level of expenditure at the category level. MCAs support a focus on a common purpose, and in doing so, reduce compliance and transaction costs of related fiscally neutral transfers.\n\nMCAs consist of two or more categories of:\n\ndepartmental or non-departmental output expenses\n\ndepartmental or non-departmental other expenses\n\nnon-departmental capital expenditure (section 7A(1)(g)).\n\nMCAs must only include categories of expenses or non-departmental capital expenditure that contribute to a single overarching purpose (section 7B). The establishment of an MCA must be approved by the Minister of Finance, who, in conjunction with the appropriation Minister, can impose conditions on the transfer of resources between categories of an MCA.\n\nThe scope of an MCA is the scope of each of the individual categories of expenses or non-departmental capital expenditure included within it (section 9(2)(a)). These individual scope statements should feature the same information as described in the relevant sections above.\n\nIntelligence and security departments\n\nAs discussed in Chapter 1, the requirements of the Act in relation to intelligence and security departments have been modified to take into account issues of national security.\n\nThese departments receive a single appropriation for all their expenses and capital expenditure (section 7A (1)(f)). The scope of these appropriations is determined by the legislation establishing the functions of the intelligence and security department and should be referenced to this legislation.\n\nOffices of Parliament\n\nAs discussed in Chapter 1, the requirements of the Act in relation to Offices of Parliament have been modified to reflect their direct accountability to Parliament. Offices of Parliament seek authorisation for their activities using the same appropriation types as departments. Their appropriations are determined by the House on the recommendation of the Officers of Parliament Committee (not by the Government) and are presented to the Governor-General for inclusion in an Appropriation Bill (section 26E).\n\nPeriod#\n\nAppropriations are also limited by period (section 10). They may be annual, multi-year or permanent.\n\nAnnual\n\nMost appropriations are annual appropriations - that is, they are authorised for one financial year. Annual appropriations are approved by Parliament through Appropriation Acts. If an annual appropriation is not used in the financial year, it lapses.\n\nGovernments may determine administrative rules for “transferring expenses or capital expenditure” into the next year but such decisions will need to be reflected in amendments to appropriations in the following year.\n\nMulti-year\n\nMulti-year appropriations give authority to Ministers to incur expenses or liabilities for a maximum period of five years (section 10(3)). Multi-year appropriations must be specified as such in an Appropriation Act.\n\nMulti-year appropriations may be appropriate in situations that are well-defined and self-contained, where the total cost is clear, costs fall across two or more financial years, but there is considerable uncertainty about the distribution of costs across financial years. Examples of appropriate uses of multi-year appropriations include the Vote Statistics appropriation for the 5-yearly census, and the former Vote Prime Minister and Cabinet 3-year appropriation for the refurbishment of Government House.\n\nPermanent\n\nThe statutory authority for some expenses and capital expenditure is provided in Acts other than an Appropriation Act. Such authorisations are termed permanent appropriations, or permanent legislative authorities (PLAs) (section 2).\n\nIn many cases the other authorising legislation simply provides that public money may be spent without further appropriation than that section and does not authorise the initiating expense or capital expenditure. To cover such cases, the Public Finance Act provides that any expense or capital expenditure incurred that gives rise to the need for those payments may be incurred without further appropriation (section 11(1)).\n\nPLAs are generally provided when:\n\nthe Government needs to give an assurance about its ability to make payments (for example, debt repayment), and/or\n\nParliament wishes to signal a commitment not to interfere in certain transactions (for example, the salaries of the judiciary).\n\nExpenses or capital expenditure authorised by way of permanent appropriation are required to be managed and accounted for by departments in the same manner as annual and multi-year appropriations (section 11(2)). Information on PLAs, including explanations of what the appropriation is intended to achieve, comparisons of budgeted and estimated actual expenses and capital expenditure for the previous financial year, and end-of-year performance information, is provided to Parliament each year in the supporting information for the first Appropriation Bill (section 15A).\n\nFlexibilities in appropriations#\n\nThe New Zealand system puts in place a large number of detailed individual appropriations. Therefore the Public Finance Act and some other legislation provide for some flexibility for Governments operating within appropriations. For example, Ministers need to have some ability to respond to changing circumstances by reallocating resources during the financial year. The rules governing appropriations have to be flexible enough to respond to those changing circumstances, while still providing Parliament with control of the public finances. The legislative flexibilities available within the appropriation system are described below.\n\nImprest supply authority\n\nAs noted previously, imprest supply is a statutory mechanism that allows Parliament to provide the Government with the authority to incur expenses or capital expenditure in advance of appropriation by way of an Appropriation Act.\n\nImprest supply is required as the main Appropriation Bill for the year is not normally passed before the beginning of the financial year; and because the changing nature of Government activities and unexpected demands means it is impossible to adequately foresee all future expenses and capital expenditures by the time the main Appropriation Bill is finalised for introduction.\n\nImprest supply is subject to certain internal controls. Cabinet approval is required to authorise the use of imprest supply and to agree its inclusion in a subsequent Appropriation (Supplementary Estimates) Bill before it can be used. The use of imprest supply is also monitored by the Controller and Auditor-General.\n\nAdministration and use of Appropriation\n\nPrior to the 2013 amendments to the Public Finance Act, the administrator of an appropriation was the only department able to use that appropriation. The 2013 amendments included a provision allowing for more flexible funding by permitting any department to incur expenses against a departmental or multi-category appropriation administered by another department.\n\nA department may “use” (that is, incur expenses against) a departmental appropriation or departmental category of a MCA administered by another department, or incur expenses or capital expenditure on behalf of the Crown against a non-departmental category of a MCA, either at the direction of the appropriation Minister, or with the agreement of the department that is the appropriation administrator (section 7C(2)(c)).\n\nThe appropriation administrator is responsible for:\n\nensuring expenditure remains within the amount, scope, and period of the appropriation\n\nmonitoring compliance with the agreement between the user and the appropriation Minister/administrator\n\nreporting actual expenditure, and\n\nensuring that all start- and end-of-year financial and non-financial reporting on the appropriation is completed.\n\nThe appropriation user:\n\nmust comply with the terms of the agreement between the user and the appropriation Minister/administrator\n\nis directly accountable to the appropriation Minister for what is achieved with the appropriation (if use is at the direction of the appropriation Minister)\n\nis directly responsible to the appropriation administrator for what is achieved with the appropriation (if use is by agreement with the appropriation administrator).\n\nExamples of situations where this may apply include a temporary transfer of functions from one department to another, or a joint work programme requiring collaboration between two departments.\n\nRevenue dependent appropriations\n\nSubject to the prior authorisation of the Minister of Finance, departments may, without further appropriation, incur output expenses up to the amount of expected revenue to be received from parties other than the Crown in consideration for the outputs being delivered (section 21). Effectively the constraint is variable, depending on the amount of revenue earned, rather than being a fixed amount. As such, revenue dependent appropriations are the main exception to the general rule that the amount of an appropriation is fixed.\n\nThe Minister of Finance approves each output expense to which the provision is to apply. This approval is likely to be limited to circumstances where there is external pressure which limits price increases for the outputs.\n\nTransfers between output expense appropriations\n\nThe scope limitation on output expenses means that unused output expense appropriations cannot be diverted for another purpose.\n\nIn addition to the flexibility provided by imprest supply, the Governor-General can authorise transfers between output expense appropriations and multi-category appropriations that includes only categories of output expenses (section 26A). This provision can only be used when:\n\nthe amount transferred does not increase any appropriation for output expenses by more than 5%\n\nno other transfer under this mechanism to that appropriation has occurred during that financial year, and\n\nthe total amount appropriated for output expenses in that Vote is unaltered.\n\nThis mechanism is usually used only late in June.\n\nEmergencies\n\nWhen there is a national disaster or civil emergency the Government may need to act quickly. Sometimes the Government may want to use resources in a declared emergency for which there is no appropriation or other authority. In these cases the Government is able to incur expenses or capital expenditure, or approve capital injections, without a prior appropriation (sections 25 and 25A).\n\nNo limit applies to such transactions, but the amounts must be included in the Government's annual financial statements and a subsequent Appropriation Bill so that Parliament can debate and confirm them. This mechanism was used during the Government’s response to the Canterbury earthquakes. In the case of a smaller-scale disaster, the associated expenses, capital expenditures and capital injections can be accommodated through imprest supply and subsequent inclusion in in the Supplementary Estimates.\n\nExpenses or capital expenditure in excess of existing appropriations\n\nThe Minister of Finance also has a limited authority to approve expenses or capital expenditure outside existing appropriation limits that have been incurred within the last three months of the financial year (section 26B). Such items must be within the scope of an existing appropriation. For each appropriation the Minister of Finance can approve an amount up to the greater of $10,000 or 2 percent of the total amount appropriated for that appropriation. Such amounts must be included in a subsequent Appropriation Bill, usually the Appropriation (Confirmation and Validation) Bill for confirmation by Parliament.\n\nUnauthorised amounts\n\nUnauthorised expenses or capital expenditure, and unauthorised capital injections require subsequent validation by Parliament in an Appropriation Act (sections 26C and 26CA). The Minister of Finance must present a report on expenses or capital expenditure incurred, or capital injections made, without appropriation which sets out the amount of each category of expense or capital expenditure and an explanation by the relevant Minister.\n\nUnauthorised spending must also be reported in the annual financial statements of the Government and the annual report of the relevant department.\n\nEnsuring compliance with appropriation terms#\n\nThe Public Audit Act 2001 (section 15(2)) requires that the Auditor-General audit the appropriations administered by departments or Offices of Parliament. Appointed auditors check compliance with appropriations in conjunction with their annual audits of government departments. The audit of appropriations involves:\n\ndetermining whether transactions and events are appropriately authorised and within relevant appropriations\n\ntesting whether an expense and or capital expenditure charged against an appropriation has been incurred for the purpose for which it was appropriated, and\n\nensuring that expenses incurred are for lawful purposes.\n\nThis audit is an ex-post or “after the fact” audit and the assurance on this audit is provided to the House after the end of the financial year.\n\nThe Public Finance Act also contains measures to provide assurance that the Crown and Offices of Parliament are complying with appropriation terms on a timely basis during the year. These measures are known as the Controller function. The Controller function supports the constitutional principle that the Government cannot spend without the consent of Parliament. Under this function, the Auditor-General exercises the Controller function under sections 65Y to 65ZA of the Public Finance Act. The Controller and Auditor-General monitors the incurrence of expenses and capital expenditure against appropriations on a regular basis throughout the year and has powers to act if a breach has occurred or if there is reason to believe a breach will occur. The Act ensures that the Auditor-General has access to information and the power to exercise this responsibility.\n\nThe Act requires that the Treasury supply monthly statements from September of each year to the Auditor-General, to enable the Auditor-General to examine whether expenses and capital expenditure have been incurred in accordance with an appropriation or other authority such as imprest supply. The Auditor-General can also request information under the Public Audit Act 2001.\n\nIf the Auditor-General has reason to believe that expenses or capital expenditure have been incurred for a purpose that is not lawful or is not properly authorised, the Auditor-General can require that the relevant Minister report to the House of Representatives on the alleged breach (section 65Z).\n\nThe Auditor-General also has the power to stop payments from a Crown Bank Account or a Departmental Bank Account (section 65ZA).\n\nThe requirement for the Treasury to provide monthly reports on appropriations, and the Auditor-General’s power to require a Minister to report on appropriation breaches were introduced in 2005. They replaced the previous Controller arrangements which involved a daily check on disbursements from a Crown bank account and a periodic Governor-General’s warrant. The changes retain the constitutional principle of an independent check on spending on Parliament’s behalf and the right to prevent payments from bank accounts, but now focuses more attention on obligations as they are incurred rather than as they are being settled.\n\nDepartments, in their role of administering appropriations, are responsible for ensuring and monitoring that sufficient authority exists before incurring expenses or capital expenditure.\n\nDepartmental chief executives are responsible for establishing and maintaining a system of internal control, designed to provide reasonable assurance that transactions entered into are within the department's legal capacity or statutory authority and are recorded to properly reflect the use of all public resources by the Crown.\n\nAppendix 1 Examples#\n\nThis appendix provides some examples of transactions and events and indicates the type of appropriation required, if any.\n\nExamples of transactions and events and type of appropriation required Transaction or event Appropriation required?\n\nYes/No Explanation Payment of GST on purchases No GST is not an expense and therefore does not require appropriation. Authority to pay GST is provided by section 6(b). Purchase of a departmental asset Yes - but refer s24(1) The purchase of a departmental asset is capital expenditure. Capital expenditure must not be incurred unless it is in accordance with appropriation or statutory authority. The purchase or development of assets does not require annual appropriation, if the expenditure is funded by the proceeds of sale or disposal of the department’s assets or from working capital (section 24(1)). Cash settlement of an existing liability No Cash settlement of a liability does not involve the creation of an expense - this occurs when a liability is created or increased. Hence, an appropriation is required when a liability is established or increased but no appropriation is required when a liability is settled. Authority to settle existing liabilities is provided by sections 6(d) and 24(2). Capital injection to a department (other than an intelligence and security department) No, but an authorisation in an Appropriation Act is required A capital injection to a department does not result in the incurrence of an expense or a capital expenditure. However, capital injections to departments (other than intelligence and security department) are required to be authorised by Parliament in an Appropriation Bill (section 12A). Departmental provision for restructuring Yes\n\nDepartmental other expenses where the expense relates to a decision to cease production of certain outputs.\n\nDepartmental output expenses where no such decision.\n\nSOE or Crown entity makes loss for year No Excluded from the definition of an expense (section 4(2)). Depreciation of departmental asset Yes Departmental output expenses. Depreciation of non-departmental asset Yes Generally non-departmental other expenses. Loss on revaluation of asset (departmental and non-departmental) No As long as the loss met the criteria for being a remeasurement (that is, it was not the result of a government decision), no appropriation would be required. Foreign exchange loss - departmental No Remeasurement. Foreign exchange loss - non-departmental No Remeasurement. Crown land with a market value of $10m and a carrying value of $5m sold for $7m Yes Crown assets are to be revalued to fair value prior to sale. Therefore an appropriation for $3m would be required (other expense). Crown land with a market value of $10m and a carrying value of $5m sold for $2m Yes Crown assets are to be revalued to fair value prior to sale. Therefore an appropriation for $8m would be required (other expense). Crown land with a market value of $4m and a carrying value of $5m sold for $2m Yes Crown assets are to be revalued to fair value prior to sale. The change to $4m would not require appropriation because it is a remeasurement. The $2m loss on sale would require an appropriation (other expense). Forgive a Crown debt Yes Non-departmental other expense. Reduce a Crown debt to its recoverable amount No Remeasurement.\n\nNotes\n\n[5] Readers interested in the development of the Westminster parliamentary system are referred to Parliamentary Practice in New Zealand (4th Ed.) found at https://www.parliament.nz/en/visit-and-learn/how-parliament-works/parliamentary-practice-in-new-zealand/\n\n[6] There are other statutory authorities in existence. These are discussed later in the chapter. For example, imprest supply pg. 14 and pg. 26.\n\n[7] It has become customary for Budget day to be in May and unless the House of Representatives agrees otherwise, the Appropriation Bill must be introduced before the end of July each year (i.e. no later than one month after the start of the financial year).\n\n[8] The authority given by Parliament to Ministers by way of appropriations is sometimes called supply. One of the ways Parliament expresses its confidence in the Government is through granting supply\n\n[9] Section 65I provides the Treasury with authority to make such investments without further appropriation.\n\nChapter 3 Fiscal Responsibility#\n\nKey Points#\n\nEach Government is required to act in accordance with the principles of responsible fiscal management specified in the Act. These principles promote sound fiscal policy.\n\nThe Act requires regular fiscal reporting including fiscal strategy reports, budget policy statements and economic and fiscal updates. The reporting requirements promote fiscal transparency.\n\nIntroduction#\n\nThis Chapter:\n\noutlines the principles of responsible fiscal management in Part 2 of the Act and the intention of those requirements\n\nnotes international developments in fiscal management\n\ndescribes the reports and statements prepared in accordance with the fiscal reporting requirements of Part 2 of the Act\n\ndescribes the responsibilities of the Treasury and Ministers in relation to fiscal reporting, and\n\nsummarises, in an Appendix, the background to the Fiscal Responsibility Act 1994, the subsequent incorporation of that Act into the Public Finance Act 1989 and the Public Finance (Fiscal Responsibility) Amendment Act 2013.\n\nPart 2 of the Public Finance Act 1989 is founded on two key planks: transparency and accountability. It seeks to achieve this by requiring:\n\nregular public reporting by each Government on their long-term fiscal objectives and short-term fiscal intentions and the extent to which these objectives and intentions are consistent with the principles of responsible fiscal management, and\n\nreporting on a wide range of economic and fiscal information.\n\nMore specifically Part 2 promotes sound fiscal policy and fiscal transparency by:\n\nrequiring that each Government pursue its policy objectives in accordance with the principles of responsible fiscal management set out in the Act\n\nimposing regular fiscal reporting obligations on the Treasury and the Minister of Finance. The reports and statements required to be presented to the House of Representatives include:\n\nan annual fiscal strategy report\n\nan annual budget policy statement\n\na periodic statement on the long-term fiscal position\n\na periodic investment statement on the Crown’s assets and liabilities\n\nregular economic and fiscal updates at least twice each year, and\n\nan annual statement of tax policy changes in the Budget economic and fiscal update.\n\nWhat is fiscal policy?\n\nFiscal policy comprises decisions about government spending and taxation. Resilient government finances are a precondition to improving long-term living standards. They reduce the risks and effects associated with economic, social, and/or environmental shocks, and provide current and future generations with the opportunities to participate in society.\n\nWhat is fiscal transparency?\n\nFiscal transparency is the full disclosure of all relevant fiscal information in a timely and systematic manner.\n\nIt has been described as “… openness toward the public at large about government structure and functions, fiscal policy intentions, public sector accounts, and projections. It involves ready access to reliable, comprehensive, timely, understandable, and internationally comparable information on government activities … so that the electorate and financial markets can accurately assess the government’s financial position and the true costs and benefits of government activities, including their present and future economic and social implications.” (Kopits and Symansky, 1998)\n\nPrinciples of responsible fiscal management#\n\nAt the core of the Act's fiscal responsibility provisions are a set of principles of responsible fiscal management. These principles aim to capture dimensions of good fiscal policy:\n\nPrinciples of responsible fiscal management\n\nThe Government must pursue its policy objectives in accordance with the following principles of responsible fiscal management:\n\nreducing total debt to prudent levels, so as to provide a buffer against factors that may impact adversely on the level of total debt in the future by ensuring that, until prudent levels of debt have been achieved, total operating expenses in each financial year are less than total operating revenues in the same financial year; and\n\nonce prudent levels of total debt have been achieved, maintaining those levels by ensuring that, on average, over a reasonable period of time, total operating expenses do not exceed total operating revenues; and\n\nachieving and maintaining levels of total net worth that provide a buffer against factors that may impact adversely on total net worth in the future;\n\nmanaging prudently the fiscal risks facing the Government; and\n\nwhen formulating revenue strategy, having regard to efficiency and fairness, including the predictability and stability of tax rates; and\n\nwhen formulating fiscal strategy, having regard to the interaction between fiscal policy and monetary policy; and\n\nwhen formulating fiscal strategy, having regards to its likely impact on present and future generations; and\n\nensuring that the Crown's resources are managed effectively and efficiently.\n\nEach principle is discussed in turn.\n\nDebt and fiscal balance\n\nFor many years prior to the introduction of the Fiscal Responsibility Act 1994 New Zealand had a high level of public debt which made the economy vulnerable to the impact of adverse events. The first principle is intended to reduce this vulnerability and sustain the resulting improved position. It requires that debt must be reduced and that this reduction must be achieved by running operating surpluses. The focus on operating surpluses is, in part, intended to prevent governments from achieving prudent debt levels simply by selling assets.\n\nFigure 1: Net Public Debt\n\nNote: the measure of core Crown net debt changed in 1992.\n\nThe second principle requires that each Government maintain debt at prudent levels. In order to achieve this objective a government will need to ensure that operating revenues are greater than operating expenses, on average, over a reasonable period of time. That is, a government cannot borrow to finance operating expenses over time.\n\nWhat is a “prudent” level of debt?\n\nThe Public Finance Act does not define the term “prudent”. Each Government is therefore required to interpret this term and to justify its interpretation to Parliament and the public.\n\nThere is no one level of debt, for example, that could be considered prudent at all times. What may be considered prudent at any given time is influenced by the prevailing structure of the economy and its vulnerability to shocks, demographic changes, the cost of debt servicing in relation to total government spending and the structure of the Crown's balance sheet. These and other relevant factors are likely to change over time.\n\nNet worth\n\nThe third principle requires that each Government maintains a level of net worth that provides a buffer against adverse future events such as economic shocks and demographic changes. Each Government needs to consider what level and composition of net worth will allow it to take action to meet these events.\n\nFiscal risks\n\nThe fourth principle requires that each Government identifies and manages prudently the fiscal risks facing the Government. Fiscal risks can arise in relation to:\n\nfinancial position, for example, changes in the value of assets and liabilities and the potential for off-balance sheet items such as guarantees to give rise to liabilities, or\n\noperating flows, for example, changes in the tax base and the risk of certain expenditures exceeding budget.\n\nBy ensuring that fiscal risks are monitored and managed, this principle helps to reduce the level of uncertainty associated with the Government's future financial performance and position.\n\nRevenue\n\nThe fifth principle reflects the importance of stability in tax rates for private sector planning and decision making. This principle also requires Government to have regard to efficiency and fairness, which acknowledges that there are important and desirable features of tax systems such as minimising behavioural distortions and administrative and compliance costs, and sharing the tax burden in a way that is perceived to be fair.\n\nInteraction between fiscal and monetary policy\n\nThe sixth principle requires each Government to have regard to the interaction between monetary and fiscal policy. When setting the Official Cash Rate, the Reserve Bank takes into account a number of factors including fiscal policy. This principle requires each Government to be explicit about the interactions between monetary and fiscal policy at different stages of the economic cycle, facilitating greater transparency in policy making and encouraging greater focus on, and discussion of, the cyclical factors impacting the economy’s performance at any given time.\n\nPresent and future generations\n\nThe seventh principle requires each Government to formulate fiscal strategy with regard to the impact on present and future generations. The other fiscal responsibility provisions have a focus on the next 10-15 years, but many decisions have longer-term effects. This principle requires governments to be transparent about any intergenerational trade-offs their policies imply.\n\nManaging resources\n\nThe eighth principle requires the Crown's resources to be managed effectively and efficiently. This recognises that it is not just aggregate amounts that matter-total spending, total assets, total debt, or total tax revenue-but also the allocation of resources within those aggregate amounts. This principle also aims to facilitate a greater level of public scrutiny of the Crown's management of its balance sheet.\n\nDepartures from principles\n\nGovernments are allowed to depart temporarily from the principles of responsible fiscal management. The Act requires, however, that a government specify its reasons for departure from the principles, how it expects to return to the principles and when. The Act recognises the need for some short-term policy flexibility, but it also requires that departures are transparent and temporary.\n\nTargets\n\nAlthough the Act does not specify targets, it provides a framework within which each Government is required to set long-term fiscal objectives. In order to demonstrate that it has acted in accordance with the principles of responsible fiscal management a government will need to explain these fiscal objectives and review them on a regular basis.\n\nFactors influencing the development of the principles\n\nThe requirements of Part 2 of the Public Finance Act are based on the requirements of the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1994 and the 2013 amendments to the Public Finance Act 1989. The 1994 Act was intended to require transparent reporting of a Government's fiscal intentions and to encourage Governments to consider the long-term consequences of policy decisions (see Appendix 2). The principles established in 1994 can also be seen as a response to concerns about New Zealand's fiscal performance at that time (refer Figure 1).\n\nThe 2013 amendments introduced three new principles of responsible fiscal management and amended the fifth principle. These additions broadened the definition of good fiscal policy from a predominant focus on sustainability to include economic stability and fiscal structure.\n\nAlthough New Zealand's fiscal performance has improved since the principles were first established, the principles continue to provide a useful framework for Ministers to consider the long-term consequences of policy decisions.\n\nInternational developments\n\nNew Zealand was one of the first countries to legislate principles of responsible fiscal management and require a comprehensive suite of fiscal reports on a government’s short- and long-term fiscal outlook.\n\nSince the passage of the 1994 Act, two international agencies, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) have developed guidelines for jurisdictions attempting to improve fiscal transparency.\n\nAlongside these developments many countries have adopted legislated fiscal rules. A legislated rule specifies in the law a numerical limit or goal in respect of one or more budget aggregates. Fiscal rules are often expressed as limits on spending, revenue, budget balances, or debt.\n\nFiscal rules have become more popular over the last decade or so. In 2015, of the 189 member countries of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), 92 had some sort of fiscal rule, up from only 7 in 1990. In general, fiscal rules tend to be associated with improved fiscal performance relative to how well a particular country was performing prior to adopting a fiscal rule.\n\nFrom time to time, the question arises as to whether New Zealand should adopt a legislated fiscal rule. Successive governments have rejected any change to the status quo. This position reflects the judgement that:\n\nPolitical commitment to a particular fiscal path is a key factor that influences whether a government actually sticks to it. By requiring governments to come up with their own assessment of what constitutes good fiscal policy, New Zealand's fiscal responsibility provisions increase the likelihood that governments will stick to the path they have set themselves.\n\nA legislated fiscal rule will not necessarily reflect the government of the day's assessment of what constitutes good fiscal policy and, accordingly, is more likely to be breached when it does not align with the government of the day's fiscal priorities.\n\nA transparency-based framework will usually be more flexible than a legislated fiscal rule. For example, a limit of Crown borrowing could require a government to cut spending even if the evidence suggests that doing so would have negative consequences for economic growth or living standards more generally.\n\nThere is a concern that allowing governments to set their own targets could lead to the adoption of weak fiscal targets. The current framework addresses this by imposing a high degree of reporting and transparency requirements. This allows both fiscal targets and measures to achieve those targets to be scrutinised by Parliament and the public.\n\nInternational agencies\n\nThe IMF Code of Good Practices on Fiscal Transparency (adopted 1998, revised 2007) contains the following general principles:\n\nclarity of roles and responsibilities\n\npublic availability of information\n\nopen budget preparation, execution and reporting, and\n\nindependent assurances of integrity.\n\nThe IMF measures country performance against the Code and publishes this information.\n\nThe OECD Best Practices for Budget Transparency are designed as a reference tool for member and non-member countries to use in order to increase the degree of budget transparency in their respective countries.\n\nTwo other jurisdictions, Australia and the United Kingdom, have also used similar approaches to New Zealand in developing legislation that establishes principles and requires Governments to operate in accordance with those principles.\n\nAustralia\n\nThe Charter of Budget Honesty Act 1998 (the Charter) aims to improve the Commonwealth Government's accountability for fiscal policy formulation. The Charter requires that governments release annual fiscal strategy statements (usually with each budget) based on principles of sound fiscal management. Australia's fiscal framework is consistent with the key features of the IMF Code.\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nThe framework within which the United Kingdom Government formulates and implements fiscal policy is set out in the Budget Responsibility and National Audit Act 2011. Under the Act the Government must prepare a Charter for Budget Responsibility presenting their approach to operating fiscal policy, which the Treasury must lay before Parliament. The Charter sets out the Government’s fiscal targets. The Charter has been updated a number of times in recent years to reflect changes in targets.\n\nThe Act also sets out the duty of the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) to independently examine and report on the sustainability of the public finances. The Charter sets out further detail on the OBR's remit, how it should perform its duties, the required content of its key publications and the arrangements for determining the timing of its forecasts and other key publications.\n\nPublishing fiscal policy intentions#\n\nPart 2 of the Public Finance Act requires each Government to set out its fiscal policy and to describe the relationship between this policy and the principles of responsible fiscal management. The Government presents this information in two key documents:\n\nthe fiscal strategy report, on Budget day, and\n\nthe budget policy statement, well in advance of Budget day and no later than 31 March.\n\nFiscal strategy report\n\nThe fiscal strategy report sets out each Government’s high-level fiscal strategy.\n\nKey requirements - fiscal strategy report\n\nWhen\n\nTabled in the House of Representatives by the Minister of Finance at the time of the Budget (customarily in May for a 1 July fiscal year).\n\nLong-term objectives (10 or more years)\n\nState long-term objectives for fiscal policy and for the following key variables:\n\ntotal operating expenses;\n\ntotal operating revenues;\n\nthe balance between total operating expenses and total operating revenues;\n\nthe level of total debt; and\n\nthe level of total net worth.\n\nExplain how the long-term objectives accord with the principles of responsible fiscal management.\n\nDisclose the timeframe to which the long-term objectives contained in the fiscal strategy report relate.\n\nAssess consistency of long-term objectives with most recently published long-term objectives and explain any departures.\n\nShort-term intentions (3 or more years)\n\nIndicate short-term intentions for key variables.\n\nAssess consistency of short-term intentions with the principles of responsible fiscal management and long-term objectives. Explain, if any, the reasons for departure from the principles or long-term objectives, how the Government expects to return to the principles or objectives, and when.\n\nAssess consistency with most recently published short-term intentions and explain any departures.\n\nManaging the Crown's resources\n\nDetail the Government's strategy for managing expenditure, assets and liabilities over the next three financial years.\n\nOther\n\nAssess consistency of economic and fiscal update with short-term intentions.\n\nAn assessment of the extent to which the fiscal performance of the Government, since it came into power, is consistent with the Government's fiscal strategy report for that period.\n\nProvide projections of likely progress against long-term fiscal objectives under stated significant assumptions.\n\nThe fiscal strategy report:\n\nencourages consistency in fiscal policy over time\n\nrequires that each Government focus on the long-term implications of fiscal policy, and\n\nallows users to assess the sustainability of the fiscal position and its sensitivity to changes in policy.\n\nBudget policy statement\n\nThe budget policy statement focuses on the detailed priorities for the upcoming Budget.\n\nKey requirements - budget policy statement\n\nWhen\n\nCustomarily published by the Minister of Finance in December (in conjunction with the Half Year Economic and Fiscal Update). It must be provided by 31 March.\n\nBroad strategic priorities\n\nState the broad strategic priorities for the forthcoming\n\nBudget including overarching policy goals, policy areas and consistency with the most recent short-term fiscal intentions.\n\nExplain any changes in the long-term fiscal objectives and their relationship to the principles of responsible fiscal management.\n\nExplain any changes in short-term fiscal intentions and their relationship to the principles of responsible fiscal management and long-term fiscal objectives.\n\nExplain any changes in the Government's strategy for managing expenditure, assets and liabilities.\n\nThe budget policy statement:\n\ncontributes to fiscal transparency. It requires government to explain any changes in short-term intentions and long-term objectives\n\nencourages consistency in fiscal policy over time, and\n\nprovides a key opportunity for debate on the content of the forthcoming budget.\n\nLong-term fiscal reporting\n\nThe Act requires the Treasury to prepare, at least once every four years, a statement on the long-term fiscal position, covering a period of at least 40 years. The requirement for this statement was introduced in 2004.\n\nThis statement is intended to lead to more comprehensive reporting of the issues that could adversely impact on fiscal sustainability and in this way to assist the Government in making decisions that are consistent with the principles of responsible fiscal management. For example, this statement can provide information on the fiscal consequences of projected demographic changes such as population ageing.\n\nThe Act does not specify the contents of the statement. It simply requires:\n\na statement of responsibility asserting that the Treasury has used its best professional judgements about the risks and the outlook, and\n\ndisclosure of significant assumptions.\n\nThe flexibility in the requirements is intentional. The Act does not require a specific analytical tool (for example, intergenerational accounts) to be used because best practice in this area is still developing and there is no single analytical indicator in widespread use. The Act permits tools and projections spanning a range of issues (for example, retirement income, health, education and the aggregate fiscal position) to be considered.\n\nInvestment statement\n\nThe Act requires the Treasury to prepare an investment statement once every four years. The requirement for this statement was introduced in 2013.\n\nThis statement is intended to lead to more comprehensive reporting of the Crown's balance sheet. Like the Long-term Fiscal Statement, the Act allows for flexibility in the requirements.\n\nThe investment statement must:\n\ndescribe the state and value of the Crown's significant assets and liabilities\n\nstate how those assets and liabilities have changed in value over time\n\nforecast how those assets and liabilities are expected to change in value in each of at least the next two financial years, and\n\nidentify any significant differences between the current state of assets and liabilities and their forecast values, and the equivalent information reported in the most recent previous investment statement.\n\nEconomic and fiscal updates\n\nIn addition to requiring each Government to report on its policy intentions (by way of the fiscal strategy report and budget policy statement), the Act requires the Treasury to publish economic and fiscal updates. Each economic and fiscal update must contain economic and fiscal forecasts for the year to which the update relates and the subsequent two years. The Treasury publishes economic and fiscal forecasts for the subsequent three years. The following economic and fiscal updates are required:\n\nan economic and fiscal update, including a statement of tax policy changes, to be tabled with the Budget\n\na half-year economic and fiscal update to be published between 1 November and 31 December[10], and\n\na pre-election economic and fiscal update, between 20 and 30 working days before the date of any general election.\n\nThe economic outlook has a significant influence on the fiscal outlook. For example, if strong economic growth is forecasted, forecast tax receipts will normally be higher and the cost of Jobseeker Support and Emergency benefit payments lower.\n\nTo enhance the transparency and credibility of the fiscal forecasts the Act requires, at a minimum, disclosure of underlying economic forecasts of New Zealand’s GDP, consumer prices, employment and the current account of the balance of payments. The legislation also requires a statement of the significant assumptions underlying the economic forecasts, which allows users to form their own views on the reasonableness and reliability of the forecasts.\n\nTo ensure governments publish a comprehensive set of fiscal information, the fiscal forecasts are to include:\n\nforecast financial statements (including a forecast statement of financial performance, a forecast statement of financial position, a forecast statement of cash flows and any other forecast financial statement required by GAAP) for each of the three years\n\na statement of forecast borrowings for each of the three years\n\nanything else that is necessary to fairly reflect the financial operations for each of those financial years or the financial position at the end of each of those financial years (a financial year runs from 1 July to 30 June)\n\na statement of commitments\n\na statement of the specific fiscal risks of the Government in relation to government decisions and any other contingent liabilities, including a description of the rules used to identify fiscal risks\n\na statement of all significant accounting policies\n\ncomparative budgeted and actual figures\n\na statement of all significant assumptions underlying the fiscal forecasts, and\n\na statement that shows the sensitivity of the fiscal aggregates to changes in economic conditions.\n\nReporting on tax policy changes\n\nThe Act requires that the economic and fiscal update presented with the Budget include a statement of tax policy changes. This statement sets out new government tax policy decisions that have resulted in a material change to the tax revenue forecasts for the financial year to which the update relates and for at least the next two financial years. The statement must also disclose the basis for determining whether a tax policy change is included in the statement.\n\nThe requirement for this statement was introduced in 2004. The intention was to make proposed tax changes more transparent by providing information on both expected increases and reductions in tax revenue.\n\nThe statement requires a summary of new tax decisions - it does not require a comprehensive statement of tax expenditures as produced by some jurisdictions. The reasons for this are:\n\nthe difficulties with the preparation of a tax expenditure statement (for example, defining the boundaries of tax expenditure, and in obtaining reliable data on the cost and extent of a tax expenditure), and\n\nthe cost of current tax expenditures in New Zealand is relatively low. There would therefore be limited benefit from focu"
