        "text": "A decaf espresso that I personally think its more balanced and tasty than the regular version. That can happen as the decaf process can slightly concentrate the sugars and take out a bit of the bitterness. I think the regular Major Dickason tastes a bit burned/bitter. The Decaf has a bit more natural sweetness to go with a wide variety of flavor here, spice, smoke, blackberry. Smells awesome.\n\nA very smooth crema with big-time persistence. This is a very good dark roast decaf espresso.\n\nCupping Method:Doppio at the Peet's in Lexington, MA. Barista confirmed it was Major Dickason Decaf.\n\nThe latest in a series of editorial reviews I'm doing on some of the bigger specialty coffee franchises.\n\n------\n\nPeet's House Cold Brew has carved out a commendable space in the cold brew coffee market, confidently giving other industry stalwarts a run. Going head-to-head with the highly regarded Starbucks cold brew, Peet's version impresses and surpasses, demonstrating a thoughtfully curated balance of flavors that stands out.\n\nThe House Cold Brew delivers a bold tapestry of flavors that delight the palate. Chocolate and caramel weave through the brew with a nuttiness that subtly accentuates the overall profile. Peet's offers a pleasing natural sweetness without an overload of acidity, creating an impressive balance. The cold brew drinks smoothly and leaves a pleasant aftertaste, tilting towards the medium roast - a deviation from Peet's usual preference for darker brews but a welcome change.\n\nThe backbone of this delicious brew is Peet's Baridi Blend. This blend features East African beans, chosen explicitly for their suitability for cold brewing. The freshly ground beans are steeped overnight in the cold, filtered water, resulting in a drink that eschews bitterness and acidity in favor of sweetness and smoothness.\n\nComparing Peet's House Cold Brew to Starbucks Nitro Cold Brew, the competition is fierce, and choosing a winner comes down to personal preference. Starbucks' Nitro variant has a distinctive creaminess and texture brought about by the infusion of nitrogen, giving it a slight edge over the non-nitro offerings. However, in terms of a traditional cold brew, Peet's House Cold Brew steals the show with its delicate balance and complexity of flavors.\n\nFrom me, Peet's House Cold Brew earns a well-deserved 4.5 out of 5 stars. It's an exquisite option for cold brew lovers seeking something outside the box. Its refreshing taste profile, coupled with the meticulously crafted brewing process, make it a standout choice. Whether you're a cold brew fan or a casual iced coffee sipper, Peet's House Cold Brew is a brew you must not miss.\n\nCupping Method:In store at Peet's! How lovely to have cold brew in a glass at a cafe rather than in a plastic cup in the car!"
