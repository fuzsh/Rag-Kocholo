        "text": "Fixturelite and Peet’s Coffee have a new partnership brewing, as Fixturelite continues to innovate and expand our product offerings. Working with product brand managers to offer creative micro market graphics that promote the operator's supplier partners, was a logical next step.\n\n“There wasn’t any question that Peet’s and Fixturelite were on the same page when we looked at the workplace café in conjunction with Office Coffee Service,” said Joanna Kim of Peet’s. Doing so helps to support one of the key value propositions, of employee retention in the workplace, that micro markets bring to the table. “When the operator goes the extra step to brand a destination within the market, around products that encourage the customer to make a purchase on-site, sales and participation typically increase. We are always exploring new ways to bring added value to our customers” said Fixturelite Co-founder, Steve Orlando.\n\nOperators that exclusively use Peet’s in their bean to cup systems that choose to designate their micro market + OCS or independent OCS offering will receive an initial complimentary product fill from Peet’s (Whole Bean coffee, solubles, branded cups). Contact Joanna Kim at [email protected] for further details on how to take advantage of this offer only from Fixturelite and Peet’s.\n\nAbout Peet’s Coffee:\n\nPeet's Coffee® is a U.S. specialty coffee company founded by Alfred Peet in 1966 in Berkeley, California. Mr. Peet grew up in the coffee trade and moved to America from Holland after World War II. His coffee style was unlike anything Americans had ever tasted before—small batches, fresh beans and a superior quality roast that is rich and complex. Mr. Peet's influence on the artisan coffee movement inspired a new generation of coffee entrepreneurs, including the founders of Starbucks. Today, Peet’s upholds its commitment to delivering a premium product by continuing to source the world’s best beans, hand-roast in small batches, and craft every beverage by hand. Peet’s asserts a strict standard of freshness to ensure optimum flavor, including a unique direct store delivery network serving over 14,000 grocery stores to personally vet the freshness date on every bag. Peet's is dedicated to growing its business through its retail, grocery and e-commerce channels while maintaining the superior quality of its coffee. Peet’s is also proud of its status as the first LEED® Gold certified roastery in the United States. For more information, visit www.peets.com.
