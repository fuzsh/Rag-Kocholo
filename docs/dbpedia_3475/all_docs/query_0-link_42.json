        "text": "Consumer-focused private equity company JH Partners invests in well-managed companies to help them expand their reach into world markets. In that capacity, JH Partners has funded investments in a variety of popular furniture, fashion, and lifestyle-driven companies, such as Peet’s Coffee & Tea.\n\nPeet’s Coffee & Tea originated in the Bay Area in the mid-1960s when Alfred Peet established a small shop in Berkeley. Born in the Netherlands, he was an experienced coffee retailer who grew up learning the trade. After immigrating to the United States, Peet realized he wanted to provide American consumers with the rich type of coffee found in his birthplace. Now a nationwide presence, particularly in upscale communities, Peet’s Coffee & Tea provides customers with dark-roasted, small-batch coffees made from fresh beans and a wide range of flavorful teas.\n\nPeet’s structures the business around putting quality first using a store-direct selling and marketing system. The company remains committed to expanding its reach using multiple channels while continuing to source and distribute some of the world’s finest and most in-demand products."
