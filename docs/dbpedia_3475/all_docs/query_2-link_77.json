        "text": "Peet’s Coffee and Tea, founded in 1966 in Berkeley, California by Alfred Peet, is rumored to be the “grandfather of specialty coffee.” According to SeattlePi, “With his emphasis on specialty coffees and unique brewing techniques, Peet, the son of a Dutch roaster, put specialty coffee on the map — and in the process influenced the founders of Starbucks.”\n\nAlfred Peet was born in the Netherlands on March 10th, 1922. Peet was the son of a small coffee roaster, so from a very early age, coffee was immersed into his life, fueling his passion. Following the end of World War II, Peet left London, where he had apprenticed with a coffee and tea company, and worked as a tea taster in the Dutch East Indies and New Zealand, before deciding to move to San Francisco in 1955 where he worked in the coffee importing industry.\n\nRumored to be disgusted by what Americans considered suitable coffee, Peet opened the first Peet’s Coffee and Tea on April 1st, 1966, Berkeley California, on the Corner of Vine and Walnut Street.\n\nWhat set Peet’s apart and sparked a revolution was the manner in which he roasted his beans, using cheaper-end robusta and arabica, and mixing the blends together. The taste was phenomenal, and by 1969, Peet’s was a gathering for coffee devotees, called “Peetniks.”\n\nToday, Peet’s Coffee and Tea are located in California, Colorado, Illonois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Oregon, Virginia, Washington, Wisconsin and the District of Colombia. Peet’s products can also be purchased in grocery stores and other retailers.\n\nAccording to the Peet’s website, their top selling blend is Major Dickason’s Blend. “A loyal customer of our original Berkeley store, retired army officer Key Dickason brought the idea for our most beloved blend to Mr. Peet in 1969. Intrigued, our founder worked with the local gourmand and coffee aficionado to refine it. They sampled countless combinations before arriving at what is now our all-time bestseller. The result was so good, Alfred Peet decided naming it after his friend wasn’t enough — Dickason’s rich, complex blend also deserved a promotion from sergeant to major.”\n\nThis blend is a personal favorite of mine. I brew a cup in using my Keurig, and add a touch of Almond syrup with whip cream, an almond melange. The bold rich body of the coffee pairs well with the sweetness of the almond syrup, creating a smooth, rich taste that is full of liveliness.\n\nAlfred Peet passed away on August 29th, 2007. His legacy will still live on in his great tasting coffee, however.\n\nFolgers and Maxwell House. Two of America’s leading coffee brands. These two companies, which have their origins in the late 19th century, are as diverse in their histories as they are in their taste. As always, I advocate that coffee is a completely personal choice, almost intimate, so this article will focus more on the histories of these two brands. You decide which one you prefer.\n\nThe beginning of Folgers Coffee Company began in 1850 in San Francisco with a company called The Pioneer Steam Coffee and Spice Mills. William H. Bovee, the owner of the Pioneer Steam Coffee and Spice Mills, saw an opportunity to produce roasted and ground coffee ready for brewing. Before that, Californians had to purchase green coffee beans and roast and grind them on their own. To help build his mill, Bovee hired James A. Folger] as a carpenter.\n\nAfter working at Bovee’s mill for nearly a year, Folger had saved enough money to stake a claim in the company and headed out to mine for gold. He agreed to carry along samples of coffee and spices, taking orders from grocery stores along the way. Returning to San Francisco in 1865, James became a full partner of The Pioneer Steam Coffee and Spice Mills. In 1872, he bought out the other partners and renamed the company to J.A. Folger & Co.\n\nCurrently there are eleven different blends of Folgers coffee available in America. Folgers promoted their instant coffee in 1970s and early 1980s ads which took the viewer inside various gourmet restaurants while a voice-over (played by Bryan Clark) whispered, “We are here at (insert name of four-star restaurant), where we’ve secretly replaced the fine coffee they usually serve with Folgers Crystals. Let’s see if anyone can tell the difference!” Clark ended the commercials with the line, “Folgers Crystals…coffee rich enough to be served in America’s finest restaurants.”\n\nMaxwell, unlike its friendly competitor, has origins of a completely different nature. Introduced in 1892, Joel Cheek named his new coffee blend “Maxwell House” after the Maxwell House Hotel in Nashville, Tennesee.\n\nIn 1884, Joel Cheek moved to Nashville and met Roger Nolley Smith, a British coffee broker. Over the next few years, the two worked together on finding the “blend” that both deemed the best, and in 1892 Cheek approached the food buyer for the Maxwell House Hotel and gave him 20 pounds of his special blend for free. After the coffee was finished the hotel returned to its usual brand. After hearing of complaints from patrons, and others who liked Cheek’s coffee better, the hotel bought Cheek’s blend exclusively.\n\nCheek resigned from his job as a coffee broker and formed a wholesale grocery distributor John Neal, The Nashville Coffee and Manufacturing Company, specializing in coffee with Maxwell House Coffee, as it came to be known, as the central brand. Later, The Nashville Coffee and Manufacturing Company was renamed the Cheek-Neal Coffee Company. Over the next several years, the Maxwell House Coffee brand became a well-respected name that set it apart from the competition.\n\nDuring the 1920s, the Maxwell House brand began to be extensively advertised across the US. Total advertising expenditures rose from $19,955 in 1921 to $276,894 in 1924, and consequently the brand was cited as the most well-known coffee brand according to a 1925 consumer survey.\n\nMaxwell House was the sponsor of Maxwell House Coffee Time (1937–1949), featuring Baby Snooks, Charles Ruggles, Frank Morgan, Topper, and George Burns and Gracie Allen over the years in a predominately radio comedy and variety format.\n\nToday both brands are still thriving, Folgers now owned by the Smuckers Company and Maxwell House by Kraft Foods. According to a 2013 article from Times Magazine, Folgers remains America’s best-selling coffee, attributed to its target of a younger demographic. But don’t count out #2 Maxwell House. With it’s complete use of 100% Arabica beans, Maxwell House has outperformed Folgers in many nation-wide taste tests. Again, coffee is a personal intimate choice, and you are free to decide for yourself whatever coffee is your top choice."
