        "text": "Starbucks coffee is one of the best-known brands in the world. But who founded it and when?\n\nWe explore some of the most frequently asked questions about Starbucks, and also some of its key moments in history.\n\nRELATED: STARBUCKS PARTNERS WITH MICROSOFT TO TRACK COFFEE USING BLOCKCHAIN\n\nWho originally founded Starbucks?\n\nThe very first Starbucks shop opened in 1971 in Seattle’s historic Pike Place Market. It was founded by three university friends — English teacher Jerry Baldwin, history teacher Zev Siegl, and writer Gordon Bowker.\n\nThe trio met as students at the University of San Francisco. They were inspired to try their hand at selling high-quality coffee beans and equipment by coffee roasting entrepreneur Alfred Peet.\n\nAlfred Peet opened his first coffee bar, Peet’s Coffee & Tea, in 1966 and is seen as one of the biggest influences in the modern popularity of coffee-drinking in the United States.\n\n“When Alfred Peet opened the doors to his first coffee bar in 1966, he quietly ignited a revolution that forever changed the expectations of American coffee drinkers. From his commitment to quality to his meticulous attention to detail, we abide by his principles today.” – Peets.com.\n\nPeet was born in the Netherlands in 1920 and grew up in the coffee trade, before traveling the world. When he arrived in the States, he was appalled by the lackluster quality of coffee they had to offer.\n\nHe set out to change all that and would help inspire companies like Starbucks to bring high-quality coffee to the world.\n\nTo this end, Starbucks started out selling whole roasted coffee beans only. For their first year of trading, they sourced their beans from Peet’s but later directly sourced them from growers.\n\nFor a full historical timeline of Starbucks, we recommend you check out their official page.\n\nWho is Jerry Baldwin?\n\nJerry Baldwin is an American businessman and entrepreneur and one of the three co-founders of Starbucks. He, with a group of investors including Gordon Bowker, bought out Peet’s Coffee & Tea in 1984.\n\nIn 1987, he sold his shares in Starbucks and served as the Chairman of Peet’s until it went public in 2001. He now serves as the company’s Director.\n\nHe has since served as the director and founding chairman of the Technical Standards Committee of the Specialty Coffee Association of America. He also serves as the president of Association Scientifique International du Cafe (ASIC), and chairman of Coffee Quality Institute.\n\nBaldwin is also the director of TechnoServe. This is a non-profit NGO working in Latin America and Africa.\n\nWho is Zev Siegl?\n\nZev Siegl is an American businessman and entrepreneur who co-founded Starbucks. He was born in December of 1942 in Detroit, Michigan.\n\nHis father was a concert violinist and his mother, an educator, and founder of The Little School.\n\nPrior to founding Starbucks, Siegl worked as a public school teacher and became Starbuck’s first paid employee. After a decade of working there and rising to the position of Vice President and Director, he left to found some other businesses.\n\nAfter leaving Starbucks, Siegl founded several businesses, including Quartermaine Coffee Roasters, located in Rockville, Maryland, near Washington, DC.\n\nSince 2013, he has dedicated his time to helping other would-be entrepreneurs as a keynote speaker around the world. He also helps mentor MBA candidates for a select few universities.\n\nThese include the Foster School of Business at the University of Washington and the Albers School of Business and Economics at Seattle University.\n\nWho is Gordon Bowker?\n\nGordon Bowker is also an America businessman who worked as a writer before helping found Starbucks. He later co-owned Peet’s Coffee & Tea as well as the Redhook Ale Brewery.\n\nHis father was killed during the Second World War, leaving his mother to raise him with her family. He would later attend O-Dea School in Seattle and enrolled at the University of San Francisco.\n\nIt was here that he met Jerry Baldwin, and together, they would later start Starbucks. For much of the 1960s, he would regularly travel to Europe, where he gained an appreciation of British Beer and Italian espresso.\n\nHe would later build a brewery, Redhook Ale Brewery, and a real-estate company in Poulsbo, Washington. He also helped buy Peet’s Coffee & Tea with Jerry Baldwin in 1984.\n\nBoth Baldwin and Bowker would sell Starbucks’ majority shares in Coffee & Tea in 1987, and Bowker decided to leave the coffee business. He would later rejoin Coffee & Tea’s board in 1994 and would remain there until 2008.\n\nWhy is Starbucks famous?\n\nStarbucks originally became popular through its mission to show America that their current quality of coffee beverages was sub-par at best. They worked hard to ensure that customers received only the very best quality and showed them how coffee should actually taste.\n\nBut, like many other businesses, visiting Starbucks is not just about coffee. It is an experience, and they’ve become a well-loved brand the world over.\n\nThey have worked very hard to make coffee-drinking an experience and make it feel like a reward to yourself. Each store has a good atmosphere, great service (usually) with comfortable lighting, and ambiance.\n\nThey make customers feel like it is a home away from home and a comfortable and happy place to meet friends and work.\n\nLike many other multi-national food and beverage companies, it has also chiseled out a reputation. No matter where you are in the world when you see a Starbucks, you know, more or less, what to expect — it is familiar to you.\n\nFor these reasons and many more, Starbucks has managed to conquer the world. To date, according to statista.com, there are somewhere in the order of 29,000 stores worldwide.\n\nAmazingly, and contrary to what you might believe, none of these are actually franchises. However, prospective entrepreneurs can acquire a license to open a Starbucks store anywhere in the world.\n\nTechnological innovation at Starbucks\n\nInterestingly enough, behind the well-orchestrated scene, customers are used to, Starbucks integrates some of the latest technology money can buy. Their IT systems, for example, integrate both Cloud computing and Blockchain.\n\nStarbucks is also embracing the Internet of Things (IoT) for much of its store’s equipment. From coffee machines to grinders and blenders, IoT tech is beginning to help Starbucks reduce downtime and repair costs.\n\nIoT tech is also helping them roll out new recipes at the click of a button to machines rather than relying on thumb drives.\n\nThey have also recently been experimenting with Machine Learning (ML) —especially on their official Starbucks app. The tech learns from customers’ habits and offers them highly personalized offers.\n\n“We have a world-class team of technologists engaging in groundbreaking innovation each day. Their inventiveness and intellectual curiosity are matched by their dedication to enabling the Starbucks experience, and this is increasingly critical to how technology has to show up for us,” said Gerri Martin-Flickinger, Starbucks executive vice president and chief technology officer to Microsoft.\n\n“Everything we do in technology is centered around the customer connection in the store, the human connection, one person, one cup, one neighborhood at a time,” he added.\n\nThis app also integrates some Blockchain tech to show customers their coffee’s journey from soil to cup.\n\nStarbucks hopes to add ML tech to its drive-thrus in the future.\n\n“Starbucks is currently testing this technology in its Tryer Center innovation hub in Seattle, with plans to roll it out soon. And according to Francis, reinforcement learning will continue to have an important role at Starbucks in many other applications going forward.” – Microsoft.\n\nWho is the woman on the Starbucks logo?\n\nThe current Starbucks logo is one of the best-known anywhere in the world. But it wasn’t always this way.\n\nOne of their earliest logo’s was a “twin-tailed mermaid” or siren. In Greek mythology, sirens were feared by sailors in the belief that they lured sailors and shipwrecked their vessels.\n\nThe motive for choosing this logo was to “lure” coffee lovers into their stores.\n\nThroughout the 1980s and 1990s, the original topless siren logo underwent a major facelift. The color scheme changed from white and brown to green, black, and white and a more stylized upper body image of the siren (or mermaid) that everyone is familiar with today.\n\nThe rationale for choosing green was to symbolized the growth, freshness, and uniqueness of the Starbucks brand.\n\nIn the 1990s, the logo changed again to simply show the iconic mermaid, though there is some debate as to whether she is actually something completely different.\n\nWe’ll let you decide.\n\nHow did Starbucks get its name?\n\nGordon Bowker recalls in the Seattle Times, how the founders came up with the company name. Bowker prior to co-founding Starbucks ran an advertising agency and strongly believed that words with “st” in them were particularly “strong” for branding purposes."
