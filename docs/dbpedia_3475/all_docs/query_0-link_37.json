        "text": "Like many farmers here, Uwamariya carefully maintains her coffee trees to produce the distinctive beans that have fueled the demand for specialty coffee in the United States, a movement sparked a half-century ago by Alfred Peet, the founder of Peet's Coffee.\n\nThe son of a Dutch roaster, Peet was born into the trade in the Netherlands. He traveled the world learning about coffee and tea before settling in Northern California in the 1950s and making his mark in the 1960s food revolution. In 1966, he opened his first cafe on Vine Street in Berkeley.\n\nPeet and his cafes popularized the concept of hand roasting and brewing high-quality beans for modern American palates, becoming the archetype for myriad coffee businesses in the decades that followed. Today, his eponymous brand is giving back to the farmers behind its coffee.\n\n“I can remember my first cup of coffee at Peet’s,” says Doug Welsh, who frequented the company’s original cafe in the 1980s when he was a student at the University of California, Berkeley. “It was a cup of Sulawesi Kalossi that I drank black. Before Peet’s, I reflexively put milk and sugar in coffee. But by the time I got to the middle of that cup, I knew coffee could taste so sweet and amazing and complex, it didn't need any of that adulteration.”\n\nThe revelation was one that would shape Welsh’s career. Soon after those seminal sips, he began working behind the counter at the cafe. Today, he is Peet’s roastmaster.\n\n“Back then, it was rare to taste a beautifully sourced, perfectly roasted, expertly brewed, properly strong cup of coffee. That just wasn't a thing,” Welsh says. “Now, some 30 years later, it's amazing how much good coffee there is.”\n\nToday, Peet’s continues to inspire not only in the pursuit of sourcing and roasting exceptional coffees, but also in its commitment to social responsibility in coffee-producing communities through initiatives like Drink a Great Cup, Do a Good Thing. This year’s effort will provide better access to clean water for Rwandan coffee farmers like Uwamariya.\n\nSpecialty coffee was a relative unknown in Rwanda just over a decade ago. But in the nearly 25 years since the country’s genocide, nonprofit and government-supported programs have helped elevate coffee from a low-priced commodity to a high-caliber crop, aiding the economy’s regrowth. For the more than 400,000 farmers who cultivate coffee here — where the average farm size is less than a quarter of an acre — training and stewardship from roasters like Peet’s have had a direct improvement on their crop yield and quality.\n\nIn fact, it was the interest and guidance from buyers like Peet’s that contributed to the development of centralized washing stations within local coffee cooperatives.\n\n“I used to process [my coffee] at home before we got a washing station in this area,” says Leonard Munyakaragwe, who has seen a sevenfold growth since he began farming the crop a decade ago. He now produces upwards of six tons of coffee in Rwanda’s Muhura District and is earning enough to have joined a savings cooperative.\n\nDespite these improvements, obtaining clean water is still challenging for many farmers, and the process can take hours.\n\nAfter the farming community identified water access as an urgent need, Peet’s chose to dedicate a portion of the proceeds from its annual Anniversary Blend to build water tanks with four access points. Pumping from the source to the highest point in the village, the tanks provide water for 2,000 coffee-growing families in the Gatsibo District of Rwanda’s Eastern Province.\n\nIt’s a virtuous cycle, Welsh says. “We become inspired by a coffee flavor and work to create this brilliant cup,” he says. “Then we work with the farmers to figure out the best thing we can do with the proceeds.”\n\nPeet’s commitments to support coffee-producing communities can also be seen in its Farmer Assistance program. “We need to do our part to ensure the future of coffee for coffee farmers,” says Matt Broscio, Peet’s social responsibility manager. The program helps mitigate challenges such as erratic weather, increased risk of tree pests and diseases, higher production costs and land development pressures by offering training in quality-coffee processing, farming best practices and critical business skills.\n\nEthiopia, where coffee is said to have been discovered and where it still grows wild, is, according to Welsh, “unchallenged as the origin of the finer-tasting class of coffees.” But along with Ethiopia’s rich coffee history came a raft of aging trees and antiquated farming practices that inhibited production and quality. In the country’s Jimma region, Peet’s collaborates with nonprofit economic development groups like TechnoServe, an organization that specializes in assisting coffee growers in developing countries.\n\nPaul Stewart, TechnoServe’s global coffee director, remembers a time when farmers would dry beans outdoors. “You could see some mold on them,” Stewart recalls. Today, practices like these are a thing of the past, and smallholder farms have access to cooperative mills where they can deliver coffee to processing facilities that ensure top quality.\n\nCombined with the rising demand and prices for specialty coffee, Broscio says the training and access to quality-focused cooperatives has had “a multiplier effect” on the participants’ crop yields and incomes, allowing for investments in their farms, homes and even new businesses.\n\n“There were times when I was frustrated and even thinking of abandoning coffee farming, due to the price and the middlemen in the market,” says Nasir Eba, a coffee farmer in Jimma. “Now I am expanding my coffee farm. Thanks to my cooperative, my life and that of my family has changed.”"
