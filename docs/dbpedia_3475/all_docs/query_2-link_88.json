I have lived there all the time with the exception of being away in the Armyâ¦ even then, I was not away from the Green for a longer interval than eight monthsâ.\n\nThe 1911 Census\n\nIn considering home and family, it is obvious throughout his memoir that both elements of life are very important to Francis. The memoir opens with the strong theme of family being present from the start. He begins by stating that his current home, at the age of 72, is the one in which he has resided in since he was born, as well as where he and his wife Amelia brought up two of their own children. Having never lived other than the one house all his life and always being in the same town, it shows how comfortable he felt in the town, and how much of a homebody Peet was throughout his whole life.\n\nPeet grew up in a household with both his parents, Fredrick Thomas Peet and Rosa Peet, as well as three other siblings, with himself being the eldest. Similarly, to his own immediate family, Peet also describes how his fatherâs side of the family has always been rather large, with he himself being the middle child of a family of eight siblings; Peet also makes it clear that it was his father who first lived in the family home, having done so since he was a baby. It is obvious that Peet thinks highly of the home as he spends his whole life living there where he eventually brings up his own family later in life. Francis recalls at the start of his memoir of spending a great amount of personal time with his grandmother Martha Cull, following the birth of one of his younger sisters who he also speaks softly and fondly of.\n\nPainting of Hertingfordbury, Hertfordshire â by Spencer Gore.\n\nWhen thinking about domestic work in relation to his family, Peet only ever discusses his fatherâs occupation in terms of his immediate family, who was a carpenter, who was employed on the estate working for Mr. C. Godfrey, as a carpenter. Peet also discusses his grandfatherâs occupation and work, who had been an apprentice to a painter and plumber. He only writes of his mother in terms of her general life throughout his childhood, and never about her own career, which we then never learn about, and nor of her domestic work around the home. Francis regularly considers his father and the way he lived his life in terms of his career and occupation, and how he looked up to him, as well as actually following in his footsteps, stating that his father âtook pride in being as good as town workmenâ (4). It was common during the early 1900s for young men to head into a similar job occupation to their fathers, and this is nonetheless the case for Peet too. Following her husbandâs death and becoming a widow, the 1901 Census notes down three men who worked on a railway were lodging within the household. This raises question as to whether Rosa did this as a source of income for the household, as Francis was 19 years old at the time his father died. This surprisingly is not mentioned within the memoir.\n\nThe 1901 Census\n\nWorks Cited:\n\n551 PEET, Francis Alfred, âRecollectionsâ, TS, pp.19 (c.10,000 words).
