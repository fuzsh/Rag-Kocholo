        "text": "Pegasus founder David Dessinger discovered how flavorful coffee can be as a 1960s regular at Peet’s Coffee in Berkeley, CA.\n\nUpon relocating to Bainbridge Island, WA in the 1970s, David was frustrated to find ‘no good local coffee’ options. He eventually resolved to buy and roast his own beans with the help and advice of the maestro himself – Alfred Peet – who soon became his mentor.\n\nMonths of trial and error on his boat in Eagle Harbor led to a breakthrough, and David imported a pre-WWII Danish roaster, rented a waterfront garage at Winslow Wharf, and began roasting commercially as Pegasus Coffee. In December 1979, David threw open the roll-up door of the garage for the first time. The delicious aroma of his hand-roasted coffees was effective advertising, and long lines for samples stretched out the door.\n\nAs Pegasus’ reputation for high-quality coffee spread around Seattle, it’s founder ordered himself a bigger roasting machine and nurtured a bigger vision:\n\nto bring a classic European-style coffee house to the Pacific Northwest.\n\nIn the spring of 1980, Dessinger expanded into the front of the ivy-covered building where he had been roasting, and Pegasus Coffee House was born.\n\nFrom the start, Pegasus offered espresso, cappuccino, cafe au lait, brewed coffee, tea and freshly baked pastries. Like the coffee houses of Europe, it was a home for lively discussions, live performances and local art, and quickly became a thriving community hub.\n\nThen, with Bainbridge buzzing, Pegasus looked across the Sound at Seattle's high-rise office buildings and imagined another way to expand. If Island commuters loved Pegasus' coffee at home, wouldn’t they also enjoy it at work?\n\nIn late 1983, in the heart of the financial district at the historic Dexter Horton Building, Pegasus again made history as the very first specialty coffee bar to open in downtown Seattle.\n\nFor the first time, Seattle's on-the-go working professionals could grab a high-quality cup of coffee on their way to the office or as a break during the busy workday. Our quick-serve Coffee Bar was a hit, and helped inspire like-minded coffee companies both near and far.\n\nWith home and on-the-go offerings for coffee-lovers created, Pegasus then looked overseas to better connect with the farms and farmers that grow, harvest and process the coffees we buy, roast and serve.\n\nPerhaps the most striking example is Pegasus’ long-term partnership with the coffee growers of Ometepe – an island formed by two volcanoes rising out of Lake Nicaragua. A single visit by Bainbridge resident Kim Esterberg in 1986 generated a suitcase of samples to be approved by Pegasus, followed by the first of thousands of pounds of direct trade coffee beans heading to the US to be roasted in the newly-expanded Pegasus facility on Day Road.\n\nIn the 30+ years since, Ometepe has become Bainbridge’s Sister Island, and those beans have brought Ometepe’s unique coffee to Pegasus, running water, schools, and college scholarships to Nicaragua, and a free flow of exchange students, adult travelers, and love between two islands that were once worlds apart.\n\nPegasus is proud to continue partnering with the Bainbridge-Ometepe Sister Islands Association to this day, along with other Direct Trade relationships with farms and cooperatives in Nicaragua and Guatemala. Details of these relationships are available on our Partners page."
