        "text": "My friend/blogger invited me to an event where Entrepreneur Patricia Acheson the CEO of T’HO Commodities Coffee (Pronounced TEA-HO) held an event to help kick-off the coffee brand here in Chicago.\n\nMy first experience sipping the coffee was “whoa” this coffee is amazing. A rich taste was left in my mouth and I was drawn in. The aroma in the atmosphere had a cocoa like hint to it from the coffee being brewed. I also love how T’HO gives back. The coffee comes in a brown biodegradable bag and reusable cans. T’HO is also looking into a program where the cans are able to be reused/refilled. The coffee brand also accommodates to their customers, as stated on their website under Coffee Inquiries, “T’HO Coffee will cater to all your coffee needs and and even customize a blend that fits your restaurant’s unique brand. T’HO will help take your Brunch Menu to a whole new level…” Once you fill out the form a specialist contacts you in 24 hours! How neat is that?!\n\nThe idea of T’HO Coffee was proposed by the Founder, Diego Rodriguez when het met Patricia Acheson in 2017. Ms. Acheson was working a full-time job all while picking up extra shifts at “Crown and Acre, a high-end bar in the Financial District, where Diego supplied his specialty coffee.” A friendship was then developed as the two discussed over coffee, life lessons and business. Mr. Rodriguez has hosted his own cuppings, opened coffee shops in the Bay Area and is now a master roaster.\n\nThe name T’HO comes from the city in which Diego Rodriguez was born in T’HO, Mexico; The Crossroads of Maya history and today it is now known as the city of Merida, Mexico. From his childhood memories of working on cocoa farms while his mom and grandmother roasted beans all day to growing up and meeting “legendary coffee connoisseur’s” he was already on the path for great things.\n\n“When he was 22 he moved to San Francisco in hopes of opening chocolate shop, but his plan took a pleasant turn when he met the specialty-coffee living legend, Erna Knutsen who introduced him to the magnificent wonders of the coffee industry. Soon after his experience with Erna he was introduced to Alfred Peet, owner of Peet’s Coffee. Peet adored Diego and took him under his wing. Diego mentions many times how they were very close friends until the day he passed. Peet even left Diego a gift with a note and at the end it said: “Diego, you really are a great coffee man”. “\n\nThere mission is simple yet positive as stated below T’HO is all about giving, encouraging and motivating.\n\nWHAT’S OUR MISSION AND VISION?\n\nYes, we have a passion for high quality coffee, but that’s not all that defines T’HO. Every day that you wake up and put your feet on the floor, we believe an opportunity for positive change awaits us all. T’HO wants to be a part of helping people make that change, and we decided to start our movement with coffee. We chose coffee as our first product, not only becauseDiego is a professional coffee connoisseur, but also because 83% of the adults in this world start their day with a cup of coffee. And when you open a bag of T’HO Coffee every morning, you will find “T’HO ENCOURAGEMENTS”; a motivational card that promotes a positive change in all aspects of life. We plan to encourage this change within offices, cafes, homes, stadiums, restaurants, and all other venues. Any place you can get a cup of coffee- T’HO will be there.\n\nMission: With coffee, we will strive to create the reality of aesthetic living.\n\nVision: To start a movement that promotes positive change by creating products that make life more enjoyable while keeping the environment clean.\n\nHOW DO WE GIVE BACK?\n\nT’HO is keen on paying it forward. We promote a clean environment by using 100% biodegradable bags and reusable coffee tins. We promote a clean mind by donating time and funds to Mental Health Awareness throughout the world.
