        "text": "“Born March 10th, 1920 in the Netherlands, Alfred Peet grew up in the coffee trade before traveling the world. Upon landing in the United States, he was shocked at the poor-quality coffee Americans were drinking. When Mr. Peet opened the doors to his first Peet's coffeebar in 1966, coffee enthusiasts gathered to appreciate his signature rich, dark roast. In the decades since Mr. Peet opened his first coffeebar, Peet's has grown dramatically. But with each cup we brew, we still look toward our founder for inspiration and dedication to an uncompromised cup.”\n\n- Peet’s Coffee & Tea"
