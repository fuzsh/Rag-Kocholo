        "text": "While Starbucks, Nescafe, and McCafe are a few of the biggest coffee brands in the world, it appears there’s a new kid on the block. Surprisingly, this kid isn’t new and has been around since 1966, even before Starbucks. That year, Alfred Peet decided to start a beverage company- Peet Coffe, whose products would later travel outside America, delighting consumers globally. Today, that small venture has grown into a Unicorn that grossed $983 million in 2019 alone. Alternatively, with more than 200 stores in the U.S alone, the company currently has at least 5,000 employees on its payroll. Unfortunately, like many global brands, it took a lot of sacrifices for Peets Coffee to get here today. In this piece, we will look at\n\nhow the company became one of the biggest coffee franchises in the world.\n\nWho is Alfred Peet?\n\nNicknamed “the Dutchman who taught America how to drink coffee”, Alfred Peet was born in the Netherlands in 1920. His father owned a small coffee company called B.Koorn & Company, which developed his passion for beverages. He continued to work in his father’s company until he moved to London and became an apprentice at Twinings. Alfred also moved within countries in the same capacity, harnessing his skills, and at a point became a tea taster. However, the turning point for him was when he moved to San Francisco in 1955 and saw that Americans drank substandard coffee. This was the inspiration Alfred needed to introduce a product and subsequently promote the most prominent coffee culture in America today.\n\nWhere It All Began — Peet’s Coffee\n\nIt took Alfred eleven years after he moved to the U.S to work for a coffee importer to begin what we know today as Peet’s Coffee. However, in April 1966, Alfred opened Peet’s Coffee as a small coffee shop in Berkley. Alfred’s aim at the time was to give Americans a taste of freshly made coffee. To achieve this, Alfred used high-quality roasted beans under special conditions to bring a delightful taste. Alfred began to try combinations with his military friend Key Dickson, alongside many others, to improve the new discovery. However, the try-out with Dickson birthed the now popular- Peet’s Major Dickason’s Blend.\n\nThe Subsequent Expansion — How Starbucks Came in\n\n1971 was pivotal for the company, as Alfred opened another store in Menlo Park to further serve morecustomers. Alternatively, more coffee blends and combinations were available to delight the growingcustomers. However, it was the same year Jerry Baldwin, Gordon Bowker, and Zev Siegl approachedAlfred for a partnership. This partnership involved Alfred supplying roasted coffee beans for their newbusiness- Starbucks, while also training them. After two years, Alfred halted the supply of roasted beans to Starbucks, forcing the new company to produce theirs. Alternatively, In the same year, Alfred also trained Jim Reynolds, who became Starbucks’s roastmaster.\n\nThe Sale Of Peets Coffee\n\nAfter assisting Starbucks to stand on its feet, Alfred sold his company in 1979 to Sal Bonavita. However, he continued to work for the company in a consultancy role for another four years. After a while, Sal\n\nBonavita sold fragments of the company to Jerry Baldwin of Starbucks, who later completed the entirepurchase in 1987. After completing the purchase, Jerry and his co-investors sold Starbucks to focus on Peets Coffee. However, to keep the standard as Alfred’s, Jerry also sought the services of Jim Reynolds from Starbucks. With the impact of Jerry and co, the company made it into NASDAQ after an IPO(Initial Public Offering) in 2001. It sold about 3 million shares at $8 per share, amassing $26 million in revenue. Acquisition By JAB Holding Joh A. Benckiser (JAB) Holding bought the company in 2012 for $977.6 million, an acquisition that saw the company become what it is today. As part of its new expansion, Peet acquired Bay Area-based tea brand- Mighty Leaf Tea in 2014. The following year, the company also acquired competitors- Stumptown Coffee Roasters and Intelligentsia Coffee & Tea. The company also started to build new roasters and alternatively develop more products and coffee blends. Subsequently, Alfred’s small company opened its first shop in China in 2017 and started to spread outside the U.S. The company also shook Europe in2020 by raising $2.5 billion via an IPO on the Euronext Amsterdam stock exchange. That raise saw Peets Coffee’s valuation hit $17.3 billion. Today, as a subsidiary of JAB holding, Peets is one of the biggest coffee brands in the world.\n\nLegacy"
