        "text": "After a lifetime importing and roasting coffee in the East Bay, earning a huge reputation as a dark roast aficionado, Michael “Mike” McLaughlin died on April 20 after a long illness in El Sobrante, California. He was 84.\n\nBorn September 2, 1939, in Oakland, McLaughlin wasn’t immediately involved in coffee. The scene was not yet anything like it is today, instead evolving thanks in part to his efforts. Like Alfred Peet, McLaughlin came of age in the Bay Area’s coffee game as it transitioned from the first wave — tubs of vacuum-sealed beans — to its second, as interest grew in origin details and roasts, and cafes that we’d recognize today dotted the region for the first time.\n\nMcLaughlin and his family became well-respected in the coffee world; Mike founded McLaughlin Coffee Roasting Company in 1983, basing the company in Emeryville. His brother Pete McLaughlin co-founded Royal Coffee, with Starbucks as an early customer, and is now one of the largest coffee importers in the United States. Coffees yet to be sampled in the Bay Area were brought to the region, roasted by local savants including McLaughlin, and exposed it to a wider audience thanks to the efforts of these companies. The Hills Brothers, legends in their own right, approached Pete McLaughlin for the family’s specialty coffee expertise — the field was far less respected in the ’80s and ’90s with few specialists — and he said his brother could handle the work. The quality that emerged in those decades in the Bay Area came from much of McLaughlin’s tinkering, finding the right roast levels for Chiapas coffees and the right temperatures for Javanese beans.\n\nMcLaughlin graduated El Cerrito High School and earned a degree in physical education and a master of arts from San Francisco State University before working as a teacher for two decades. His son, Shaun McLaughlin, is now co-owner of McLaughlin Coffee and says his dad taught in the Richmond Unified School District before he thought to give coffee roasting a try, thanks to that Hills Brother invitation. He told Pete McLaughlin and fellow Royal Coffee co-founder (and cousin) Bob Fulmer he’d take a year to learn the ropes; if it stuck, great, and if not, he’d go back to teaching in the fall.\n\nBut the return to teaching didn’t happen. McLaughlin Coffee took off after that conversation with Hills Bros., opening with his wife Barbara McLaughlin. She’s now in her 70s and works three days a week at the business. She and McLaughlin just reached their 48th wedding anniversary before his death, and the company itself celebrated its 40th anniversary on July 1, 2023. Shaun McLaughlin says his father’s successes in life came from a slow-growth model with no interest in compromising quality. He built loyal customers who saw that while other businesses prioritized expansion, McLaughlin guarded his relationships and accounts. “We sold to people for 30 to 40 years,” Shaun McLaughlin says. “We’re a family-oriented company, and that’s from him.”\n\nFulmer says coffee as a leisurely, popular beverage in the area can be traced to the work of the McLaughlin family amongst others. McLaughlin was the face of the company to restaurant and shop owners, or anyone interested in purchasing their coffees, from the early days through to the end. Fulmer says he was an incredible salesman, his warmth and personable nature a perfect complement to the samples. “He was really motivated,” Fulmer says. “But he also liked coffee. We loved dark roast coffee, which was the thing at the time. You were roasting dark or you weren’t hip in the Bay.”\n\nWinning people over to this new face of coffee was a trial, but as everyone well knows the Bay Area’s coffee revival was successful: Specialty coffee is an ever-growing sector in the market, and Americans drink more coffee than ever before according to data company Statista. His son says he was indeed honest, welcoming, and could make friends with anyone. “He never wanted to be Starbucks,” Fulmer says. “He just wanted to do his thing and do it well.”"
