        "text": "Alfred H. Peet, the son of a Dutch coffee merchant who pioneered a revolution in roasting exotic dark beans that led to America’s love affair with high-end coffee, died Wednesday at his home in Ashland, Ore. He was 87.\n\nThe cause was cancer, several friends said. His death was announced Friday by a representative of the company he founded, Peet’s Coffee and Tea Inc.\n\nMr. Peet, often called the “grandfather of specialty coffee,” started his business in Berkeley, Calif., in 1966, with a single retail coffee bean outlet that blossomed into a public company with 150 stores in 10 states.\n\nHe is credited with mentoring and inspiring a generation of coffee entrepreneurs, including the founders of Starbucks.\n\n“He was the guru of everyone in the gourmet coffee revolution,” said Corby Kummer, author of “The Joy of Coffee” and a senior editor at The Atlantic Monthly. “He was the big bang. It all started with him.”\n\nThe first Peet’s retail shop served as an anchor for a culinary corridor that would later be called the Gourmet Ghetto, a quaint commercial area in North Berkeley that gained fame with the opening of Chez Panisse, the restaurant owned by the chef Alice Waters, and specialty food boutiques like the Cheeseboard and Cocolat.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
