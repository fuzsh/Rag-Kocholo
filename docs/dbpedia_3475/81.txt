Mr. Peet, born in Holland, opened the first Peet's at Walnut and Vine in Berkeley in 1966, and watched it spread nationwide (there's Peet's in New England now?). And the rumors you've heard about the Peet's/Starbucks connections are true: the Starbucks folks knew Alfred Peet personally, started up the 'Bucks in tribute in the Pacific Northwest, and used Peet's coffee beans for their first year of business.

Mr. Peet retired from the business in 1983, and whenever asked to talk about himself, would say "the coffee tells my story." Lift a cup of Major Dickason blend today in honor of Mr. Peet.
