Welcome to Brooks School Elementary!

Brooks School Elementary serves more than 700 students from preschool to fourth grade. Our staff is dedicated and committed to teaching, growing, and reaching the diverse educational needs of all our students.

Students at BSE are immersed in a warm and welcoming community where high expectations are the norm. Our targeted focus on academic growth, achievement, and social/emotional growth provides all students a variety of opportunities to engage in their learning and development. Our students begin to learn to collaborate at the kindergarten level and are expected to apply their thinking in cooperation with their fellow students throughout their years at BSE. At BSE we believe in a partnership between home and school. It is through the partnership of families and school staff that fosters student success. Our motto is “Be Kind, Be Safe, and Be Engaged.” This is reinforced within and beyond the school walls. Our staff is committed to educating the whole child.

In addition, our PTO supports quality events that provide our students and families opportunities to immerse themselves in community building and fellowship. Events are held throughout the year bringing the BSE community together to support our students.
