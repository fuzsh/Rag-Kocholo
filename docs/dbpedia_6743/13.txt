Brooks School, North Andover, Massachusetts. Our engagement began as a collaboration with Head of School John Packard to produce a vision paper for the Campaign for Brooks. Brooks had just approved a new school mission statement: "At Brooks School, we seek to provide the most meaningful educational experience our students will have in their lives." Our particular charge was to help Brooks apply this pithy mission statement to the wider context of a comprehensive fundraising campaign. We were subsequently asked to create a new visual identity for the Brooks Fund and to produce a year of appeals that would fold the fund into their pre-campaign strategy.
