Colleen Barry, the inaugural dean of the Brooks School, described Cornell’s newest undergraduate school this way: “The Jeb E. Brooks School of Public Policy brings together scholars across disciplines to tackle the biggest public policy challenges we face as a society, both in the U.S. and globally. Our mission is to make positive change in the world.”

The Brooks School offers undergraduate majors in public policy and health care policy. Engaged learning experiences available to Brooks students include the Capital Semester program in Albany, New York, and the Cornell in Washington program in our nation’s capital. Please see the Brooks School website for more information and guidance on how to apply.
