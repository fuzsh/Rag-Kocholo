You can watch the full livestream for more info.\n\nWhat’s Covered:\n\nThe Cornell Brooks School of Public Policy’s Essay Prompt\n\nIs the Brooks School Right for Me?\n\nQuestions to Consider When Brainstorming\n\nUnderstanding the differences between the colleges at Cornell is essential when applying. Certain schools may have additional essay prompts, and you should tailor your essay to what the college has to offer. Read our post about how to write the Cornell essays for more information.\n\nThe Cornell Brooks School of Public Policy’s Essay Prompt\n\nThe supplemental essay prompt for the Cornell Brooks School of Public Policy asks:,\n\nWhy are you drawn to studying public policy? Drawing on your experiences, tell us about why you are interested in your chosen major and how attending the Brooks School will help you achieve your life goals. (650 words)\n\nAlthough this prompt is practically a “why major” prompt, this essay still requires a fair amount of research into the school and reflection about whether or not the Brooks school is the right fit for you.\n\nIs the Brooks School Right for Me?\n\nFor a policy-specific education, the Brooks School is a great option. However, if your interests are broader, you may want to consider other departments that have a wider focus.\n\nPolitical Science, for example, offers a social science perspective on policy issues. Alternatively, Cornell’s School of Industrial Relations offers similar coursework, with a community of students that are actively involved in government-based organizations. Cornell also offers a Policy and Management major in the School of Human Ecology.\n\nIf you are still having trouble finding the right school for your interests, check out CollegeVine’s list of 7 Things to Consider When Choosing a College Major.\n\nQuestions to Consider When Brainstorming\n\nIn this essay, applicants should focus on their genuine reasons for deciding on this major and how they will positively use an education in public policy to better themselves and their communities. Here are some questions to consider as you write your essay:.\n\nWhy are you interested in public policy?\n\nWhat issues energize you and how do they relate to studies at the Brooks school?\n\nHow does the Brooks school align with your career goals?\n\nHow will you give back to your community?\n\nIt’s always best to illustrate your answer for the reader through your background and anecdotes, rather than just explaining that you have an interest. Use your experiences to your benefit while writing this essay to “show, not tell” the admissions officer why your values align with those of the Brooks school."
