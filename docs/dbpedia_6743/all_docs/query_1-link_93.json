        "text": "NORTH ANDOVER, Mass. (AP) â€” Officials at a prestigious New England prep school have disclosed that a former headmaster had an inappropriate relationship with a student.\n\nA letter sent to alumni and parents Thursday by the current Brooks School headmaster and trustees president disclosed that former headmaster Lawrence Becker engaged in a relationship that was \"objectionable, manipulative and an abuse of his position.\"\n\nBecker was head of the North Andover school from 1986 until 2008. Neither the letter nor a spokeswoman hired by the school disclosed when the relationship occurred, its exact nature, or the gender of the student.\n\nThe letter said the matter was handled by the trustees' president at the time, businessman and former Republican presidential candidate Steve Forbes.\n\nBecker did not respond to messages. His lawyer said he knew nothing about the case.\n\nCopyright 2013 The Associated Press."
