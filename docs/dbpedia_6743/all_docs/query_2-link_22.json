        "text": "Our ability to be the most meaningful educational experience in our students' lives depends largely on the students who walk through our doors. We believe this means enrolling a student body from all walks of life, with a wide range of talents and interests, who seek deep engagement with each other, and who are passionate about sharing our core values. Admissions officers need flexibility to round out our student body on an annual basis, to accept the athlete or the artist or the musician or the brilliant learner, even if he or she needs financial aid. Financial aid is also essential to maintaining diversity of all kinds on campus and preparing our students for a global world. Current financial aid resources cannot keep pace with the need for financial aid that is growing year by year, especially among middle-class students. Financial aid is the key to sustaining enrollment and delivering a better Brooks."
