        "text": "Hi there, just curious if anyone has some feedback for me. It’s sort of a long post so please bear with me if you are familiar with any of the schools.\n\nWe are from the Rocky Mountain region and D3 is very outdoorsy. She is interested/open to considering BS as a potential option down the road because she would love to experience the kind of community so many BSs offer. She is strong academically, and would be particularly interested in pursuing dance, skiing (especially Nordic), lacrosse, and lots of theater.\n\nI know these three schools aren’t mentioned much on this forum but I would love some input if anyone is willing to comment. For each school: Is the student body generally more inclusive or more cliquish? Is the campus vibe particularly laid back or particularly competitive? Do students value a diversity of talents- is there balanced support for sports as well as fine arts programs?\n\nI am interested in these three schools for a few reasons. First, I am an MX grad so am quite familiar with the school although I haven’t set foot on campus in years. From the updates I get, Middlesex seems to have a more inclusive student body and stronger general community spirit than it had when I was there. True or wishful thinking? Also Middlesex has a huge commitment to the arts which I know D3 would love as well as the skiing and available sports etc.\n\nProctor caught my attention because of the strong experiential learning component and the travel abroad. I love how outdoorsy it is and how involved the students seem to be in their community. Seems like a very laid back school. The academics don’t seem as intense there, but that could be a bonus in my opinion. How are their performing arts programs?\n\nFinally, Brooks caught my attention as well simply because I absolutely don’t know a thing about it. I’m pretty familiar with the other St. Grotelsex type schools but am wondering if Brooks is similar or if it is an outlier. If it is different how/why is it unique?\n\nThanks for any input you would be willing to give. It’s too early for D3 to look at schools this year but your insight might help me guide her research if she wants to pursue BS in the future.\n\nFor what it’s worth, in the Greater Boston area, Middlesex is considered very athletically oriented (and its neighbor in the same town, Concord Academy, is considered artsy). Both of those schools are working hard to overcome those reputations, with Middlesex making much of its commitment to the arts and Concord fairly recently adding new sports fields. But many people would still say that M’sex is for the jocks and CA is for the artsy kids. As for Brooks, we looked at it, and I wanted to like it, but couldn’t quite get there. My daughter is also into dance and drama, and was turned off by the very limited offerings in each of those areas. She also felt that it was too stereotypically preppy for her tastes.\n\nI would very much second the suggestions of Berkshire and Millbrook, I think both of those schools have a really great sense of community, and both are very outdoorsy (esp. given their locations).\n\nIf you and your daughter are willing to consider a larger school, I would suggest NMH. It has an extensive dance program and lots of theater. It also offers nordic skiing, which neither Brooks nor Middlesex offers as a sport. You can be as outdoorsy as you want at NMH and the school is very laid-back. Every fall they have “Mountain Day” when each class hikes a different local mountain. The student population is extremely diverse, and I would never describe it as preppy, a description I would apply to both Middlesex and Brooks. A friend with a child at Middlesex once described it as “buttoned up”. From spending time on the MX and Brooks campuses over the years, I would say they both look and feel like traditional NE boarding schools, but I’m sure they have significant differences when you dig a little deeper.\n\nWhen you start looking at schools, I would suggest you ask questions about the ability to pursue your daughters interests, not just whether the school offers the activities. I remember that when we looked at Middlesex, they pointed out that it was possible to participate in sports and theater, because they met at different times. This was not true at other schools - theater is an alternative to sports. This was also true of dance at many schools; dance is considered a sports alternative.\n\nI’m a Proctor parent - my D will be graduating this year. She has been very involved in theater since her freshman year and they’ve put on some amazing productions for such a small school. She’s also off to France this year with 7 other students and 2 of her art teachers for a semester (all the off campus programs are included in boarding tuition which is huge). A good friend of hers is very involved in the Nordic program and from what I understand it’s a very tight group with excellent coaches. Several of the kids traveled to Norway and participated in the Birkenbeiner (sp?) this year. Academically there are lots of opportunities and a lot of smart kids but the Proctor ethos is definitely more about a balanced life.\n\nI think you have a good selection of schools that you are looking at and when you visit you’ll get a better sense of what fits for her."
