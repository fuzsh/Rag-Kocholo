        "text": "Brooks has one of the oldest high school rowing programs in the United States. We continue to believe and invest in our tradition of developing rowers within a residential academic community. Whether an athlete is brand new to the sport or arrives to campus with their own single scull, Brooks offers the facilities, equipment, coaching experience and engagement to support their growth, realize their potential, and propel them forward into opportunities well beyond Lake Cochichewick.\n\nCompleted in the summer of 2023, the 7,500-square-foot Demoulas Family boathouse replaces the longstanding Lyman Boathouse and Holcombe Boathouse. In addition to state-of-the-art storage for the racing fleet and nearly 100 years of photographs and artifacts, the boathouse offers Brooksâ€™ and visiting spectators a 900-square-foot viewing area overlooking the four-lane Lake Cochichewick race course. It is our goal to provide athletes and spectators one of the best racing venues in the country.\n\nHoused in the centrally-located Danforth Gym, the Armstrong Rowing Center features two sets of eight-oared rowing tanks, sixteen ergometers and specialized equipment enabling rowers to measure and improve their fitness and technique. Athletes have access to the facility throughout the academic year.\n\nBrooks races coxed fours in the spring. A member of the 60+ school New England Interscholastic Rowing Association (NEIRA), Brooks hosts competitors each week from throughout New England on its 1500-meter, multi-lane course on campus. Following the NEIRA Championships held in late May, Brooks frequently extends its season into the summer.\n\nBrooks raced in the Youth National Championships in 2021, 2022 and 2023, and competed at the Henley Royal Regatta in 2022."
