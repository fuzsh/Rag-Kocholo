        "text": "Ways to help\n\nThe PTA raises funds throughout the year to pay for events, items, and activities that make Brooks a better school for our kids. There are many ways you can help!\n\nJoin/Renew Your Membership\n\nWhen you join or renew your membership, you can choose what amount of membership dues to pay. Learn more here.\n\nMake a Donation\n\nMake a donation to the Brooks PTA anytime by simply clicking on this Paypal Link. Credit cards are also accepted. Or you may leave a check made out to “Brooks Elementary PTA” in the mail room at Brooks, in the mailbox marked “PTA.” Additionally, does your employer match charitable donations? Check with your employer’s HR department, or click on this link to a list of corporate-match donors, or try this online searchable database. Your donations are tax-deductible, and Brooks’s Tax ID is 541991273. Donate now!\n\nSchool Supply List\n\nOne of the most asked questions is some variation of “What items are needed at the school?” We have posted this spreadsheet (updated October 2021) that contains classroom wish lists for many teachers and staff. Some teachers also have their own Amazon Wish Lists. Thank you for any and all donations.\n\nDine Outs\n\nThe PTA organizes regular dine outs at various area restaurants about once a month. When you mention you’re there to support Brooks, a portion of your dinner check goes to the PTA. When you go, you support the school you love, enjoy an evening out with friends, and NO COOKING! Win-win-win! Know when dine outs take place from subscribing to the Listserv, following on Facebook, or reading the weekly Bee Mails.\n\nScan Box Tops!\n\nWith the new Box Tops mobile app, you just scan your store receipt, find participating products and instantly add Box Tops to Brooks’s school’s earnings. Each Box Top label is worth 10 cents for Brooks.\n\nGET THE APP: Download on the Apple App Store or Get on Google Play Once you have the app you’ll need to create a profile and link to Brooks (school ID: 204921), and then you’re ready to start! Note: receipts must be scanned within 14 days or purchase.\n\nIf you still have traditional Box Tops clips at home, make sure to send them to school – you can leave them in the bin marked “Box Tops” right behind the front desk at Brooks’s main entrance at your convenience. We will still earn cash for all clipped Box Tops until they expire. To see a full listing of products carrying the Box Top labels, click here.\n\nAmazonSmile Program\n\nAmazon will donate 0.5% of the price of all eligible Amazon purchases to the Brooks Elementary PTA! It’s easy to set up: just click here and it should take you to your existing Amazon account and you’ll be prompted to designate Brooks as your charity. Say yes, and that’s it! Shop using smile.amazon.com for all your Amazon purchases. Spread the word to friends and family — anyone can choose Brooks as their AmazonSmile charity!\n\nGrocery Points Programs\n\nJust 2 minutes to sign up and the results last the school year! You must register again each new school year! Click on the links to get signed up:\n\nGiant — “A+ Bonus Bucks”\n\nBrooks’s Giant ID#: 02230"
