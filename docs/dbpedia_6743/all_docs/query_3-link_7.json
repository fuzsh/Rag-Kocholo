        "text": "Think like a scientist. In chemistry class, students are asked to examine a problem from every angle, conduct experiments and arrive at a solution. They don't passively learn the material; they live it.\n\n\"It is impossible to get distracted because everything is so hands-on.\"\n\nThis is the goal of every class at Brooks â€” to inspire students to immerse themselves in the lessons. As they devour Beloved for the first time, they're asked to read and interpret at a deep level. As they grapple with the birth of the U.S. Constitution, they're preparing to become engaged citizens. As they dive into statistical data, they must uncover the real story behind the numbers. This is what it means to have a meaningful educational experience.\n\nBrooks students become determined problem solvers, creative thinkers, language lovers, art appreciators, life-long learners, and, ultimately, meaningful contributors in their communities, and in the world.\n\nThe course catalog provides a sense of the depth and breadth of our curriculum. Requirements are considered the minimum needed to graduate from Brooks. Students should look beyond what they must take to what they ought to take to make themselves the most attractive candidates for college admission. For example, all students should complete courses in the three basic sciences (physics, chemistry and biology), even though they are not necessary for graduation. Most students graduate with transcripts that far exceed the school's requirements."
