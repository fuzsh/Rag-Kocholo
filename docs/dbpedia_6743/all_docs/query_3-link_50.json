The school is named after Gwendolyn Brooks, a native Chicagoan and the first African American poet to win the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry.\n\nThis is the PBC’s second project at Brooks College Prep; in 2011 the PBC managed the construction of the school’s two additions.\n\nFollow this project on Twitter @PBCChi #BrooksAthletics"
