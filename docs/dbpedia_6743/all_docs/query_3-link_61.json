The college does this through its innovative curriculum and by providing students with high-impact learning experiences like service-learning projects, study abroad opportunities, internships, living and learning communities, and intensive writing and research opportunities. The mission of the Brooks College is cultivating engaged global citizens through innovative interdisciplinary programs and diverse community partnerships.\n\nProgram Information\n\nThe Brooks College of Interdisciplinary Studies challenges students to tackle the important issues of the day by integrating the perspectives, knowledge, and methodologies of multiple fields of study. The college offers majors in environmental and sustainability studies; global studies and social impact; integrative studies; and women, gender, and sexuality studies. Minors are available in African/African American studies; digital studies; East Asian studies; environmental and sustainability studies; human rights; Latin American and Latino/a studies; LGTBQ studies; Middle East studies; religious studies; and women, gender, and sexuality studies. The college also offers a graduate degree in social innovation and certificate programs in sustainable food systems, Latino/a studies, leadership, and intercultural communications. Most of these academic programs have social justice components to them.\n\nThe centers, initiatives, service units, and university-wide programs in Brooks College provide the expertise of highly qualified faculty and staff to Grand Valley and the West Michigan communities, helping people to become more skilled and experienced with internationalism, intercultural communication, sustainability, local history, social justice, creative problem-solving, and the goals of a liberal education.\n\nWhat is interdisciplinarity? Interdisciplinarity is the integration of knowledge and methodologies from across the university to better understand the world around us. The most complex issues of the world - environmental stewardship, human rights, poverty, and the migration of people, to name a few - can only be addressed effectively if we pose questions, test hypotheses, and apply knowledge from different perspectives. In an interdisciplinary program, the focus is on improving critical-thinking skills by prompting students to integrate knowledge from among the humanities, social sciences, natural sciences, performing arts, and the professional programs. The interdisciplinary courses and programs in Brooks College are taught by faculty whose own research is interdisciplinary as well as by teams of faculty from across the disciplines who are skilled at helping students see different fields of study as parts of a whole. The goals of our classes and programs are to help students integrate perspectives from a variety of disciplines in order to problem-solve in a global context, take-action in their communities, and connect learning to their future professions.\n\nAcademic Units\n\nArea and Global Studies\n\nThe Area and Global Studies Department includes interdisciplinary programs that focus on the history, politics, geography, and culture of various world regions as well as on current global issues such as human migration, climate change, and changing economies. The department offers the following programs:\n\nAfrican/African American studies (minor)\n\nEast Asian studies (minor)\n\nGlobal studies and social impact (major)\n\nLatin American and Latino/a studies (minor) and a Latino/a studies certificate\n\nMiddle East studies (minor)\n\nDigital Studies\n\nThe digital studies minor provides students with skills to understand and use digital technologies.

Through theory and practice, the minor provides opportunities to gain experience in using digital tools and develop a complex understanding of the cultural, social, and ethical dimensions of a digitized world.

While all aspects of humans' interaction with their environments may be relevant to environmental and sustainability studies, areas of particular interest include sustainable food systems, energy and climate change, water quality, and the cultural and built environment.\n\nThe major combines academic foundations in various disciplines with practical experience in interdisciplinary research and problem-solving, to prepare graduates to work effectively in business, nonprofit, civic, or governmental roles that support sustainability and environmental responsibility. Students pursue either a B.A. or B.S. degree. The minor is structured for students in any major who have a strong interest in environmental and sustainability issues. The sustainable food systems certificate provides skills and experience necessary to address the role of food in community life.
