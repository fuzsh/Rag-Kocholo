        "text": "Digital Marketing Efforts & Success\n\nPay-Per-Click Advertising\n\nWhen Gatorworks took over the pay-per-click (PPC) account, one of the primary objectives was to optimize the ads to provide healthy conversion values month-to-month. Because Bob Brooks School sells courses online, we were able to directly tie our efforts to a measurable return on investment (ROI). This clear correlation allowed us to optimize for further success on a monthly basis, make adjustments to the ads, and evaluate new opportunities.\n\nWe generated more revenue by creating landing pages offering relevant courses. This organization allowed users to easily find and purchase their desired courses. Our efforts resulted in outstanding monthly key performance indicators—the all-time conversion rates for the account are over 36%, average cost-per-click (CPC) is just a hair over $2, and the ROI over the last 14 months is over 390%.\n\nTargeted Display Campaigns\n\nBecause everything was performing so well after just four months, we added on targeted display to the client’s digital marketing arsenal. It helped build on already-impressive growth. We utilized a number of tactics, including site retargeting, CRM matching, and addressable geo-fencing.\n\nWith a readily available list of agents and brokers, CRM matching and addressable geofencing tactics were essential. Using them, we targeted agents and brokers who needed continuing education credits. We were also able to go after expiring licensees and individuals seeking a license for the first time. On a monthly basis, we removed licensees whose expirations had passed and targeted new licensees whose expirations were approaching. Through laser-focused targeting and engaging ads, we were able to help agents and brokers fulfill their continuing education requirements and propel Bob Brooks School’s success. From October 2019 through August 2020, we served these ads 3,641,968 times, garnering 4,027 unique clicks to the website. When comparing the time period running targeted display to the same months the year before (as it’s a highly seasonal business), we see a 23% increase in traffic and a 36.34% increase in overall revenue."
