        "text": "HSE nurses are skilled to take care of all student needs, especially those who have specific health concerns. Below, you will find information on some of the more common health concerns seen in schools. If your student has a health concern not seen below, please reach out to your building nurse to discuss your student's needs. Here are a few things to know:\n\nForms for health concerns need to be updated each year. In most cases, your student sees their doctor yearly, so please have the physician complete the form at that time.\n\nWe do accept forms in the Spring for the following school year.\n\nForms can be sent in with your student or scanned and emailed to your building nurse.\n\nSevere Allergy\n\nIf you student has a severe allergy requiring the use of an Epi Pen, please complete the Severe Allergy Form. Please note one side is for your physician to complete and the second side is for the parent.\n\nGrades 7-12, students are allowed to carry their Epi Pen while at school, but a physician's permission is needed for this. Your doctor can check the box on the form.\n\nGrades K-6, students will need to have the Epi Pen at school and kept in the clinic.\n\nYour student may transport the Epi Pen to school, but please notify the nurse prior.\n\nCheck the Epi Pen is not expired. An expired Epi Pen will not be accepted, and the nurse will ask you to provide another Epi Pen.\n\nFood Intolerance\n\nIf your student has a food intolerance, we will make every effort to notify food services in your building in a timely manner. However, if you have any questions or concerns, you may reach out to the Cafe Manager to discuss your student's intolerance.\n\nAsthma\n\nPlease have your doctor complete the Asthma Form for your student. Please note the doctor can check the box that allows your student, Grades 7-12, to carry the inhaler at school, otherwise, the inhaler will need to be kept with the nurse in the clinic.\n\nDue to Covid, nebulizer treatments are not given at school at this time. If your student would need a nebulizer treatment, a parent would have to take the student home to administer it.\n\nDiabetes\n\nIf your student has diabetes, please download and complete the Diabetes School Form each school year. Orders from your student's doctor are also required for the school year. Below is a list of supplies your student should have while at school and can be kept in the clinic. However, if your student has orders to self-manage, they may carry their supplies with them.\n\nSeizures\n\nAsk your doctor to work with you to complete the Seizure Action Plan for your student. This provides important information about your student's seizures and how to respond if your student were to have a seizure during the school day. If your student has emergency medication (Diastat or intranasal diazepam), please contact your building nurse.\n\nOther Health Concerns\n\nIf your student has other concerns not listed above, please contact your nurse to discuss them.\n\nWhat is head lice?\n\nHead Lice are small parasitic insects that feed on human blood several times a day and live close to the human scalp. Head lice and nits are found on the scalp, around and behind the ears and near the neckline at the back of the head. Here are other facts to be aware of:\n\nHead lice cannot fly or jump; they can only crawl\n\nHead lice are spread by direct head‐to‐head contact\n\nHead lice are rarely spread by contact with clothing or personal items (such as combs, brushes, hats or coats)\n\nHead lice are not a sign of uncleanliness\n\nHead lice are not known to spread disease.\n\nWhat are signs and symptoms of head lice infestation?\n\nTickling feeling of something moving in the hair\n\nItching, caused by an allergic reaction to the bites of the head louse\n\nIrritability and difficulty sleeping; head lice are most active in the dark\n\nSores on the head caused by scratching\n\nIf your student is brought to the clinic with suspected head lice, the nurse will assess the student to verify the presence of an infestation, notify, the student’s parent/guardian, and assist staff and parents with guidelines and education materials for handling the situation.\n\nMy child has lice. What do I do?\n\nA shampoo treatment with an insecticide shampoo will kill most head lice. A second treatment is necessary ten (10) days later with some brands of insecticide shampoo. Manual nit removal and environmental cleanup of the home by the parent is the key to successful head lice treatment. It is important to remember to follow the directions for treatment as research has shown over- or incorrectly treating head lice may contribute to lice resistance.\n\nWe encourage parents to communicate that his/her child has head lice to any close contacts that may have been exposed after being in your home (i.e.-sleepover or slumber party).\n\nWhat does the school do if my child has lice?\n\nWhile head lice are a nuisance, they do not spread disease and are not a health issue. If you report your child has lice, the nurse will maintain confidentiality of the student’s identity and will not disclose the name of the student, name of the teacher, nor the grade level to families. Students are not excluded from school for having head lice, as the management of this condition should not disrupt the child’s education process. This is supported by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), and the National Association of School Nurses (NASN).\n\nFor more information on head lice and treatment go to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website\n\nWe ask that you complete the Health Card and Consent to Treat; then, depending on your child’s specific health concerns, you may be asked to complete additional forms.\n\nYou may find the Health Card and Consent to Treat by logging into your Skyward account and clicking on ‘Back to School Forms’. Please complete all forms in this tab and click on the ‘Complete’ button at the end. By completing all forms and clicking complete, the forms will be submitted. If you only complete the forms and do not click ‘Complete’, forms will not be submitted.\n\nAdditional health forms can also be found on the HSE website. Click on the ‘Services’ tab on the top right, then ‘Health Services’. Once on the Health Services page, scroll down and click on ‘Health Concerns’. There you will find information on specific health concerns, and the applicable forms. You may also contact your building nurse to get these forms before the end of the school year."
