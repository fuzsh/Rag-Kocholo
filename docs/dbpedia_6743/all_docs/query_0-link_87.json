        "text": "Willie Waters has spent more than half of his life as a member of the Brooks School boys soccer program.\n\nThe 39-year-old, who is originally from Andover, Mass., played at Brooks for four years, before graduating in 2002. For the last 17 years, he served as the program’s head coach.\n\nBut Waters’ run at the Independent League School power in North Andover, Mass., is coming to an end. He is leaving his post, because he and his family will be moving to Southborough, Mass., where his wife, Susanna, will take over the role as Head of School at the Fay School, beginning in July."
