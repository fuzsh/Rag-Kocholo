        "text": "In a recent email to the Brooks School community, Head of School John Packard announced that Nina Hanlon had accepted the position of assistant head of school.\n\nHanlon is currently the director of enrollment and financial aid at Greenwich Academy, a position she has held since 2016.\n\n\"I am thrilled that Nina Hanlon has accepted our offer to join the faculty as assistant head of school,\" said Packard. \"She will begin on July 1, 2022, and move to campus at some point over the summer once she finishes her master's degree at Teachers College in New York. From my initial conversation with Nina straight through offering her the position, it has been abundantly clear that she will add tremendously to our school.\"\n\nHanlon got her start in education as a faculty member at Noble and Greenough School in 2002. Since 2011, she has been at Greenwich Academy, where she has held a number of different roles, including history and English teacher, rowing coach and assistant head of the middle school.\n\nAs director of enrollment, she oversees a team of six admission associates and an $8.2 million financial aid budget. Hanlon is a graduate of Nobles and holds a B.A. from Brown University, where she was a two-time NCAA Division I champion, and an M.F.A. in Acting from American Conservatory Theater.\n\n\"I am so excited to be joining such a warm and welcoming community at Brooks,\" said Hanlon. \"I've known Brooks for what seems like forever, going back to my days as a student at Nobles. When I read the assistant head of school job description, I was struck by how organically it ties together the work I've done in enrollment, hiring, delegating, teaching and professional development. Over the years, I have become a mentor to many faculty members both seasoned and brand new to the profession. Along with my administrative duties, I've stayed connected to what is most important to me: my students. However, working in admissions can often pull me away from the day-to-day experiences of students and teachers, and I am thrilled to reengage in that aspect of school life.\"\n\nHanlon with her husband, Ron, and their children, Simone and Dylan, age 8.\n\nBrooks cast a broad net in its search to fill this position. There was considerable interest from a national applicant pool. However, after Hanlon visited campus in December to meet with students and faculty, the search concluded quickly.\n\n\"Through a series of conversations and meetings with Nina Hanlon, it became overwhelmingly clear that she is already an exceptionally accomplished school administrator who has long appreciated the opportunities we have in independent schools to make a profound difference in the lives of our students,\" said Packard. \"Her colleagues at Greenwich Academy were unanimous in their view that Nina is both ready and especially well suited to be assistant head of school as her independent school career ascends and talent for building close and productive relationships within and beyond school communities continues to grow. Her demonstrated ability to reach students, colleagues, and families in meaningful ways bodes well for the relationships she will surely forge as assistant head of school at Brooks.\"\n\nThis position fills a void that will be left when Associate Head for Faculty Affairs John McVeigh leaves to become head of school at Holderness School.\n\n\"While Nina's initial focus will be appropriately centered on building relationships with the school's faculty and coming to know our school community, we are excited about how the position and its day-to-day responsibilities will evolve and grow as both the school's needs and Nina's many strengths intersect over time,\" said Packard. \"The room we have made for growth with this position is exciting to think about.\"\n\nFollow Brooks School on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter to see all the activities, projects and happenings in our community each day during the school year.\n\nOTHER RECENT STORIES\n\nWinter Term Triumphs\n\nAll of the Brooks School campus community celebrated Winter Term during our annual Symposium on Friday. Watch video highlights to enjoy the event from wherever you are, too!\n\nInteractive Art in the Lehman\n\nStudents in the \"Environmental Artivism\" Winter Term learned about the intersection of art and environmentalism, as well as printmaking, through visiting artist Pippin Frisbie-Calder.\n\nWinter Terms Get Out of Town\n\nTeachers take students off-campus, visiting museums, labs and landmarks, to bring them even deeper into their in-depth classes during this special term."
