I will definitely use for continuing education!\n\nI just wanted to thank you and your staff for all your help and the ease of your course for my pre-licensing education. Mr. Brent, your explanations help a lot. Thanks!\n\nI'm a single mom of two boys and I work full time so, the online course was my only option. I passed on my first try! I also scored pretty high. I will recommend your course to others! Lots of hard work paid off for me!\n\nI really appreciated the review! The LIVE Q&A helped so much, I was able to narrow things down and really focus on the important stuff!\n\nIt was well worth my time! I had taken the test once before and didn't do well, but READY. SET. PASS! helped me get passing results!\n\nWhat an outstanding course!! I felt that I should get my license after 25 years in Real Estate Development and General Contracting. I have known Bob Brooks for nearly 50 Years and knew he was an excellent teacher when it came to passing the Real Estate licensing course. However; Mr. Lancaster brings a completely new and very informative side to the learning process. I have enjoyed every minute of this course and know I am well prepared to pass the Real Estate Licensing Exam!! Thank you!!\n\nThank you so much for helping me pass. I tired another program before yours and had to read everything! I knew pretty quick that was not the program for me, and I soon switched to your course. Watching all the videos and taking the tests as I went helped me so much. I was able to retain the information much better. Thank you for helping me pass on my first try!\n\nBob Brooks School rocks! They break down the course into easy-to-manage sections. You read, listen, then take a test. It's like 1-2-3. Brent does a fantastic job of explaining terms you may not even be able to pronounce! Great system, I passed my state and national exams the first time! If you are thinking of getting into Real Estate, I would say go to Bob Brooks School. You will be glad you did!"
