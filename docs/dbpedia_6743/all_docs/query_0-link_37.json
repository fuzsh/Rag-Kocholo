        "text": "Reflections and Advice:\n\n1.) What do you think makes your school unique relative to other boarding schools?\n\nThe community at Brooks, including teachers, staff and students, all share an extremely tight-knit bond that I've never experienced at any other institution. Teachers care about the students, and get to know them extremely well. The sit down meals that we had once a week (in the fall and spring) allowed students to interact with other students you wouldn't normally know, and meet new faculty. Overall, sit down meals were one of my favorite part of Brooks. Additionally, Brook's winter term, the three week program in January, allows you to take one class with one small group of students and a few teachers. This class can be anything, from about cars to personal organization to cuban culture. These are just two of the ways that Brooks feels more like a home and community than a school.\n\n2.) What was the best thing that happened to you in boarding school?\n\nThe best thing to happen to me was studying abroad. I was able to study abroad in Scotland for a month, paid for by Brooks. It was an amazing experience that changed me. Additionally, participating in athletics, like the wrestling club, and living in a dorm made my experience unforgettable. I was chosen as captain of the wrestling team senior year. These three experiences could've only happened at Brooks, and made my experience at the school unforgettable. Even today, I still miss the tight knit dorm life and sports events that I had at the school.I feel that Brooks prepared me just as there motto said. It was the most meaningful educational experience of my life. It prepared me not just as a student, but also socially and physically for my life beyond. I made friends, learned how to work hard, and to be a better person. There is no doubt in my mind that if i didn't attend Brooks, I'd be a totally different person.\n\n3.) What might you have done differently during your boarding school experience?\n\nI would say to get involved as much as you can. Often, as students get older, they join less sports and attend less school events. I wish that I participated in athletics all three seasons, for every year of high school. Athletic programs in high school are so much fun, and you learn so many lessons from them. Additionally, I would spend more time getting to know students in other grades. High school is the last time you will know every person you go to school with, so take advantage of it! Don't limit yourself to a group of friends, but get to know everyone you can.\n\n4.) What did you like most about your school?\n\nThe community feel at Brooks is what I'll never forget. The small community at Brooks, and the individual faculty there, make it a one of a kind place. From the small dorm life, to the athletic teams, to the social events like dances, living in such a community was an amazing experience. Having everyone know you and care about you makes living away from home not scary, but so much fun. I'll never forget the amazing 4 years I had at Brooks School due to the amazing people there.\n\n5.) Do you have any final words of wisdom for visiting or incoming students to your school?\n\nFor incoming students, check out the snack bar in the lounge on the floor below the dining hall. Bob makes amazing burgers! Take Mrs. H's science classes, they're a blast and she is a fantastic teacher. Everyone should take oratory, it's an amazing class that really hones your public speaking ability.For dorm living, live in Thorne. It's the largest dorm, but kids love it and everyone there lives in it for four years. Also, I would recommend living in a double, rather than a single. Having a roommate is a great way to make a tight friend. I still talk to my high school roommate and visit him regularly during the summer. For day students, hang out with borders. Many day students loved hanging out in the dorms and they became a home away from home"
