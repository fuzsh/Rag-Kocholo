Through a multi-age, interdisciplinary, hands-on curriculum, the Nashoba Brooks Preschool experience focuses on creativity and multiculturalism. In our close-knit community, boys and girls begin to master the skills that form the foundation for a life of learning as independent thinkers and problem solvers. Our Preschool is a half-day program with and extended day option up to 5:30 pm. We follow a school-year calendar. We also offer both a 3-day and a 5-day option for 3 year-olds."
