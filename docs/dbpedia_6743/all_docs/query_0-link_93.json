        "text": "Bringing together inspiring colleagues and an amazing parent community\n\nBeing a part of the PBS team means learning something new every day from your colleagues. It means putting our students first in all our decision-making. It means partnering with parents who care deeply about the school – not just their child, but the whole community. It means having the room to try new things, having support when you falter, and having colleagues who’ll cheer when you succeed. If these are the qualities you’re looking for in your next work environment, we want to hear from you.\n\nInvesting in professional growth and development for every employee\n\nThe faculty and staff at PBS are our most valuable asset, so PBS offers a top-notch compensation package: salaries that are regularly benchmarked against other Bay Area schools and generous insurance and other benefits. Key among these investments in our people power is our ongoing support for professional development. PBS supports its employees by bringing in outside experts and by helping them seek advanced degrees, attend conferences, and pursue leadership opportunities in their disciplines.\n\nBuilding a diverse and inclusive community\n\nThere’s no single PBS story. Our teachers and staff are from all over: some grew up down the road here in Menlo Park; others are transplants from the Midwest or East Coast; still others came to PBS from jobs in Saudi Arabia or South America. We represent a wide variety of cultures, ethnicities, religions, and socioeconomic backgrounds, just as our students and families do. We value and celebrate this diversity and see it as one of the many aspects of PBS that make it an amazing place to work."
