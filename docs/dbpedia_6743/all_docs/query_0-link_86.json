The 387-seat proscenium theater has sliding barn doors which, when open, allow students and faculty to see into the theater from the arts street. This space also features state-of-the-art lighting systems, motorized rigging, and an adjustable forestage. The center also includes a black box theater, costume shop, scene shop, changing rooms, and a green room.\n\nPress\n\nBrooks School"
