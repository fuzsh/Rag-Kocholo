        "text": "For the past month, new students have been happily settling into life at Brooks, getting to know their classmates, campus and teachers — 15 of whom are new to the school this fall themselves. Let's get to know a bit about them, shall we?\n\nShamsud \"Shami\" Bery\n\nSelf in Community Teacher\n\nAfter spending the first four years of his life between New Delhi and Trinidad and Tobago, Bery was raised in Roxbury, Mass. He went on to graduate from Brandeis University and has professionally pursued a variety of fields, including working as creative director for a multimedia startup, founding a clothing line, serving as Entrepreneurship Education Coordinator at a vocational school and being a chef. At Brooks, Bery lives in Blake House, where he is often found listening to Dominican Bachata, oldies soul and hip-hop, trying out a new recipe or watching NBA and WNBA games.\n\nWhat have you most enjoyed about Brooks this past month?\n\n\"The students. Not only teaching them in class but connecting with them in the dorm and around campus. The energy and vibrancy the students bring to my day reminds me why I love working with young people, and fuels me to be my best every day.\"\n\nAny surprising talents?\n\n\"I spent a lot of my child and young adulthood [on drums] playing the trap set. It's been a while since I played regularly, but I am sure I can stay 'in the pocket' if necessary.\"\n\nWhat's a talent you wish you had?\n\n\"I wish I knew the various ballroom dance styles. While my two-step is strong, I daydream about dancing salsa professionally or even a more robust bachata!\"\n\nDo you collect anything?\n\n\"I collect all things that bring beauty to my surroundings. This usually leads to artwork, sneakers and random nick-nacks.\"\n\nBest advice you've ever received?\n\n\"At all costs, be your authentic self.\"\n\nMichael Bruschi\n\nDirector of Music\n\nA self-described \"lifelong East Coaster,\" the musician, who primarily plays piano and drums, graduated from Princeton University and earned an M.A., M.Phil. and Ph.D. in music theory from Yale University. He has taught courses in music theory and keyboard skills and composed works for solo piano, jazz ensemble, string quartet and church choir. Bruschi lives on campus in Thorne House.\n\nWhat have you most enjoyed about Brooks this past month?\n\n\"I've often been told that the people you meet at Brooks are the best part of the Brooks experience. I've found this to be eminently true thus far. The students here are all so mature and motivated, and my colleagues are amazing people across the board.\"\n\nAny surprising talents?\n\n\"Whenever I am in an unfamiliar place, I always instinctively know where the bathrooms are located. Also, I'm really good at picking out high-quality berries at the supermarket. I'm not good for much else outside of those two things.\"\n\nWhat's a talent you wish you had?\n\n\"I wish I could fall asleep on command because I've been struggling with insomnia for the past decade.\"\n\nDo you collect anything?\n\n\"I have a modest collection of maps because I enjoy traveling and exploring unique or remote or abandoned places in my spare time. I've also been on a mission over the past five-to-six years to collect, sample and rank every brand of seltzer that exists.\"\n\nBest advice you've ever received?\n\n\"Focus on what you can control.\"\n\nKimberly Cratty\n\nSchool Counselor\n\nThe North Andover native and Villanova University graduate has spent the past 12 years in private practice as a social worker counseling children, adolescents and adults in Andover, Mass., where she lives with her husband and three children.

In her free time, she coaches two youth soccer teams and plays soccer in local adult leagues.\n\nWhat have you most enjoyed about Brooks this past month?\n\n\"I've enjoyed meeting the students, faculty and touring the beautiful campus. The students are enjoyable to connect with since they are self-aware, introspective and honest.\"\n\nAny surprising talents?\n\n\"With three kids, our household is busy and extremely active. I'd say my talent is the ability to multitask.\"\n\nWhat's a talent you wish you had?\n\n\"Interior design. Creativity is a struggle and I'd love for it to come easily when decorating/designing my home.\"\n\nDo you collect anything?\n\n\"No, I do not collect anything. My husband Jeff would claim I collect shoes, purses and soccer balls, but I will officially deny that.\"\n\nBest advice you've ever received?\n\n\"Find a job you love and you will never 'work' a day in your life. ... Once you commit to something, follow it through. There is no quitting in life, push through, persevere. ... Pay attention to the words you use to communicate to yourself. Be kind. ... Be here now. ... Wherever you go, there you are.\"\n\nSarah D'Annolfo\n\nEnglish Teacher\n\nA former Teach for America corps member in St. Louis, the Andover, Mass., mother of three came to Brooks from Belmont Hill School, where she taught English and co-led the diversity, equity and inclusion student program.

Their fun personalities and competitive spirits make it a joy to come to practice.\"\n\nAny surprising talents?\n\n\"I like to bake and decorate baked goods in my free time. I've even made things for a few weddings/showers!\"\n\nWhat's a talent you wish you had?\n\n\"I would love to be more musical. Being able to play guitar or piano would be awesome.\"\n\nDo you collect anything?\n\n\"I collect spoons from places I have traveled. I used to buy them for my grandmother who collected spoons when she was in the service. When she passed, I inherited her collection and have continued to add to it.\"\n\nBest advice you've ever received?\n\n\"Don't sweat the small stuff — and it's all small.\"\n\nSarah Downey\n\nMathematics Teacher\n\nA recent Hamilton College graduate, Downey has served as a teaching assistant for college-level math courses and tutored high school and college students for six years.

At Brooks, she lives in Chace House with her partner, Matt.\n\nWhat have you most enjoyed about Brooks this past month?\n\n\"I've enjoyed being able to work with students in different capacities at Brooks from living in the dorm to teaching Self and Community. It allows me to build a foundation with students even before they come into the College Counseling Office.\"\n\nAny surprising talents?\n\n\"I speak elementary Thai. I studied abroad there in college and it's something I've been able to use in my boarding school work experience with international Thai students who are studying here in America.\"\n\nWhat's a talent you wish you had?\n\n\"I wish I could sing. Well, I can, but not well...\"\n\nDo you collect anything?\n\n\"I don't necessarily collect anything but I love a good thrift store jewelry find, from some fun earrings to different kinds of necklaces and rings.\"\n\nBest advice you've ever received?\n\n\"I always love some good advice that comes my way. I think some of the best has always been around the same storyline of 'showing up' and the importance of positivity.\"\n\nPascale Musto\n\nSelf in Community Teacher\n\nThe Salve Regina University graduate has been immersed in the life of independent schools since 2000 as a diversity, equity and inclusion practitioner and educator.

Today, I truly understand how Chapel serves as a mindful pause for the community during a busy week and the role it plays in drawing the community together.\"\n\nAny surprising talents?\n\n\"I love to cook.

One is learning about all of the opportunities the students have to try different things. It is something I wish I had been exposed to when I was younger. I have also really enjoyed the Chapel services. I've found the messaging in those services to be informative and inspiring.\"\n\nAny surprising talents?\n\n\"I am a fairly accurate axe thrower. When I was working with Orangetheory Fitness, I took my team on a team-building outing to an axe-throwing venue in Somerville. I fell in love with it on my first throw. I then joined leagues and became fairly competent at throwing.\"\n\nWhat's a talent you wish you had?\n\n\"I wish I knew how to surf. It was something I always wanted to learn how to do and never got around to. I love the beach and enjoy watching surfers on Cape Cod.

Currently, my favorite scally is my next one!\"\n\nBest advice you've ever received?\n\n\"I have been given so much advice in my life it is hard to pick just one, but one of my favorite pieces of advice, and one I plan to bring to my time at Brooks, is this: 'Live, learn, pass on.' I received this advice from a powerlifter turned businessman named Dave Tate. It's something he has built his life and business on, and something I've added to my life. I have lived a lot.
