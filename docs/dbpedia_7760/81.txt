William Petty, Richard Cantillon, David Hume, and James Steuart were early contributors to classical political economy in the 17th-18th centuries. Petty developed concepts like surplus, fiscal pressure, and distinguishing actual and natural prices. Cantillon developed a circular flow model and theories on money, demand/supply, profit, and population growth. Hume emphasized empiricism and free trade. Steuart published the first book with "political economy" in the title, representing a more systematic view of moderate mercantilism.
