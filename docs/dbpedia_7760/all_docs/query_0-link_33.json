        "text": "Exchange is one of the crucial aspects of any human society. Transactions between people may concern immaterial things such as labor or social relationships, but very often they include a material component. Things, both common and rare, banal and prestigious, familiar and exotic, are exchanged on a daily basis, today as in the past. These exchanges imply and require that a value is attached to a thing each time it changes hands throughout its life history. These values are, of course, usually defined by basic economic factors, such as production, supply, and demand, but also by the social conditions within which the exchange occurs. From the perspective of the thing itself, value may also change for other reasons: because the item is somehow physically transformed in between transactions or because it gains associations beyond its own material characteristics. In this chapter, we explore how these values are studied in the archaeology of the Western European Middle Ages. We investigate what roles things can play in these different forms of economic organization, how things acquired their value, and how this value found its expression in different contexts. Medieval economic objects are vehicles that carry different layers of information related to production, social values, consumption, and the development of consumerism; they are an integral part of larger assemblages (Roesdahl and Verhaeghe 2011; Jervis 2017b). We discuss how things acquired economic value\n\nFor a long time alchemy has been considered a sort of intellectual and historiographical enigma, a locus classicus of the debates and controversies on the origin of modern chemistry. The present historiography of science has produced new approaches to the history of alchemy, and the alchemists’ roles have been clarified as regards the vicissitudes of Western and Eastern cultures. The paper aims at presenting a synthetic profile of the Western alchemy. The focus is on the question of the transmutation of metals, and the relationships among alchemists, chymists and artisans (goldsmiths, silversmiths) are stressed. One wants to emphasise the specificity of the history of alchemy, without any priority concern about the origins of chemistry.\n\nThis article argues for an alternative response to the 'consumer society' hypothesis for 18th-century England, which is seen to focus on large-scale development and obscure the relations between people and objects. Returning to Marx's theories regarding 'consumer fetishism' and utilising Bruno Latour's work on hybrids and the human and the non-human, the paper considers the manner in which people used objects and objects used people. Utilizing the courtesy books and 'it-narratives' of the 18th century and the later works of Jane Austen, the paper argues that goods should not be seen only as commodities.\n\nThis essay considers the implications of a shift in focus from ideas to practices in the history of alchemy. On the one hand, it is argued, this new attention to practice highlights the diversity of ways that early modern Europeans engaged alchemy, ranging from the literary to the entrepreneurial and artisanal, as well as the broad range of social and cultural spaces that alchemists inhabited. At the same time, however, recent work has demonstrated what most alchemists shared-namely, a penchant for reading, writing, making, and doing, all at the same time. Any history of early modern alchemy, therefore, must attend to all of these practices, as well as the interplay among them. In this sense, alchemy offers a model for thinking and writing about early modern science more generally, particularly in light of recent work that has explored the intersection of scholarly, artisanal, and entrepreneurial forms of knowledge in the early modem period.\n\nGoldsmith-engravers active in Nuremberg in the sixteenth century confronted scarcity as a material reality, a philosophical concept, and a justification for legislation on their behalf. Focusing on two booklets of printed design proposals, one attributed to Matthias Zündt from 1551, the other published by Christoph Jamnitzer in 1610, this article treats the ways in which conservation was practiced in the goldsmith’s studio alongside classical and early modern discourses on the limitedness or limitlessness of natural resources—fire, water, air, and land. When fashioning metalwork objects for patrons, goldsmiths used precious materials to indulge through formal innovations the fantasy that the earth’s supply is inexhaustible. Yet the prints in places undercut this fiction. Moreover, while they gesture openly to other craftsmen to partake of their contents, the booklets relied on the privilege, a form of contrived scarcity, to restrict first rewards to the inventor."
