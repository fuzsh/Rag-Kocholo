        "text": "24 November 2020\n\nRead time: 5 minutes\n\nHello readers! Today, we are going to talk about the great French mathematician of the seventeenth century, RenÃ© Descartes'. Did you know that he liked to lie in bed and think?!\n\nBorn in 1596, Descartes was a creative mathematician of the first order, a critical scientific thinker, and an original metaphysician.\n\nIntroduction\n\nRene Descartes was a great French Mathematician and philosopher during the 17th century. He is considered as a precursor to the rationalist school of thought, and due to his vast contributions to the fields of mathematics and philosophy, he is often known as the â€˜Father of Modern Philosophy.â€™\n\nRenÃ© Descartes - Father of Modern Philosophy-PDF\n\nRene Descartes was a great French Mathematician and philosopher during the 17th century. He is often known as the â€˜Father of Modern Philosophy.â€™ Here is a downloadable PDF to explore more.\n\nðŸ“¥ RenÃ© Descartes - Father of Modern Philosophy-PDF\n\nDownload\n\nFamily Life of RenÃ© Descartes\n\nRenÃ© Descartes was born in 1596 in La Haye en Touraine, France, to Joachim and Jeanne Descartes. His mother died when he turned one, and he also remained fairly ill throughout his childhood.\n\nHe and his siblings were raised by their grandmother, as their father used to be busy elsewhere with work and as a council member in the provincial parliament. Descartes never married, but he fathered a child in 1635 with Helena Jans van der Strom. The child was named Francine. Unfortunately, he died at the age of five due to scarlet fever.\n\nEducation and Career of Descartes\n\nIn 1606 Rene Descartes was sent to the Jesuit college at La FlÃ¨che, which was established in 1604 by Henry IV (reigned 1589â€“1610). At La FlÃ¨che, 1,200 young men were trained for military engineering careers, the judiciary, government administration, etc.\n\nIn addition to classical studies, science, mathematics, and metaphysics, they were taught acting, music, poetry, dancing, riding, and fencing.\n\nIn 1614 Descartes went to Poitiers, where he took a law degree in 1616.\n\nIn 1618 he went to Breda in the Netherlands, spending 15 months there as an informal student of mathematics and military architecture in the Protestant stadholderâ€™s peacetime army, Prince Maurice. There, he was encouraged in his studies of science and mathematics by the physicist Isaac Beeckman, for whom he wrote the Compendium of Music, his first surviving work.\n\nIn 1619, under Beekmanâ€™s guidance, Descartes began serious work on mathematical and mechanical problems and, finally, leaving the service of Maurice of Nassau, planned to travel through Germany and join the army of Maximilian of Bavaria.\n\nIt is during this year (1619) that Descartes was stationed at Ulm. He had three dreams that inspired him to seek a new scientific inquirmethod y and envisage a unified science.\n\nSoon afterward, in 1620, he began looking for this new method, started but never completed several works on the method, including drafts of the first eleven rules of Rules for the Direction of the Mind. He worked on and off it for years until he finally abandoned it for good in 1628. During this time, he also worked on other, more scientifically oriented projects such as optics.\n\nFrom 1634-1636, Descartes finished his scientific essays D'optique and Meteors, which applied his geometrical method to these fields.\n\nDescartes began work on Meditations on First Philosophy in 1639. The first edition of the Meditations was published in Latin in 1641, in which he listed six sets of objections and his replies. He published a second edition in 1642, which also included a seventh set of objections and replies and a letter to Father Dinet. Descartes defended his system against charges of unorthodoxy."
