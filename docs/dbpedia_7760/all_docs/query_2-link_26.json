Motivated to make a positive impact, this program equipped me with the skills necessary to perform research, think critically, and identify solutions to these issues.\n\nIn your opinion, what is the value of a Social Sciences degree?\n\nThroughout high school, I was encouraged to pursue a career in STEM and so when I started my post-secondary education in Environmental Science I was confused as to what was missing – for me it was a focus on people. The human element that was centred in all conversations within my specialization in human geography compelled me to relate and connect better with content. What I like about Social Science is the balance of industry-specific technical know-how with career-critical soft skills: written and verbal communications, research and dissemination, time and conflict management, etc.\n\nWhat advice would you give to a current Social Sciences student who is exploring?career options?\n\nResearch labour demand, specialize, and gain practical experience. University allowed me to explore at a high-level the theories, worldviews, and concepts across several disciplines. In this sense, being in university can easily make you a generalist so I would encourage you to find your specialization or niche within your interests. I strongly recommend enrolling in your program’s co-op to gain the experience that employers are looking for while helping inform your career path in a low-risk environment.\n\nHow did completing a Social Sciences internship help shape your career planning or your post-graduation journey?\n\nThrough the connections I made at McMaster and within the Hamilton community, I became involved with municipal civil engagement working at the City of Hamilton in Planning and Economic Development. It was that experience that awoken a passion for urban planning, leading me to pursue a Masters in Planning from Toronto Metropolitan University, and eventually working as a Planner in transportation and housing. The faculty and career resource staff empowered me to get involved in the community and started me on my career path.\n\nA Social Sciences degree provides students with excellent transferable skills including critical thinking and analysis, research and evaluation, oral and written communication, problem solving, teamwo\n\nWhat have you found most beneficial about the specific degree program you completed at McMaster?\n\nThe Social Psychology program allowed me to delve into both psychology and sociology to learn more about human behaviour, group dynamics, and complex issues in our society. With its multidisciplinary nature, I gained a strong understanding of working with diverse populations which was a great foundation for my current work supporting post-secondary students with their career development journeys.\n\nIn your opinion, what is the value of a Social Sciences degree?\n\nA Social Sciences degree provides students with excellent transferable skills including critical thinking and analysis, research and evaluation, oral and written communication, problem solving, teamwork, and leadership. Employers value students in the Social Sciences who have a strong ability to examine and analyze complex problems and find creative solutions, while considering a multitude of societal factors and focusing on equity, diversity, and inclusion.\n\nWhat advice would you give to a current Social Sciences student who is exploring?career options?\n\nBe open-minded and fully present in the career exploration process. Pursue a multitude of diverse opportunities so you can learn more about your interests, skills, and values and gain further insight into what’s right for you and what you want your future career to look like.\n\nPartnerships with post secondary institutions are tremendously important in the development of evidence based research and best practice guidelines...\n\nPartnerships with post secondary institutions are tremendously important in the development of evidence based research and best practice guidelines. However some partnerships go beyond that and develop a synergy and a network of ideas that become incredibly fruitful projects. Creativity is the ability to take an idea and make it tangible. The collaboration between McMaster University and YWCA Hamilton has turned several ideas into fully formed and comprehensive research grant proposals and applications. This process has helped bridge connections between passionate experts and researchers in the field with the on the ground project managers and nonprofit organizations doing the work. This has been tremendously beneficial to both stakeholders, and eventually we hope that we can then use the products and outcomes of the research projects to inform our practice so that we can benefit the most important stakeholders; the participants of our programs"
