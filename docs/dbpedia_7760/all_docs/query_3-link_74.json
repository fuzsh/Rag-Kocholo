        "text": "Introduction\n\nThe following are short definitions and interpretations of philosophical schools of thought, movements and branches that have been posited and built upon by many philosophers. Some have adopted a “one size fits all” approach, while others have chosen a more encompassing approach to try and explain human nature and its interaction with the outside world. By choosing multiple paradigms and theories and hence gaining a more balanced and varied view into our surroundings, we are practising Eclecticism which I see as a good approach in expanding one’s horizons.\n\nAbsolutism\n\nThere exists an absolute truth that is always true regardless of conditions. Humans are able to discover universal facts that hold true under any circumstance. As far as ethics are concerned, it holds many similarities with objectivism deeming certain acts as objectively right or wrong.\n\nPlato and Aristotle both believed in a kind of absolutism. Immanuel Kant was another prominent promoter of this.\n\nMany religions have morally absolutist positions; they regard their system as having been set by a deity, perfect and unchanging.\n\nRelativism\n\nThe polar opposite of absolutism, relativism posits that points of views are relative (shocking). Ideas and views have no absolute validity and are subjective to the differences in perception of those proclaiming them.\n\nMichel Foucault and Ludwig Wittgenstein are among the most famous thinkers who have been associated with this branch.\n\nAbsurdism\n\nMan’s attempts to find meaning in the universe will ultimately fail because no such meaning exists.\n\nComedian Tim Minchin mentions the lack of meaning in his address for a graduation ceremony at the University of Western Australia: “[…]Arts degrees are awesome. And they help you find meaning where there is none. And let me assure you, there is none. Don’t go looking for it. Searching for meaning is like searching for a rhyme scheme in a cookbook: you won’t find it and you’ll bugger up your soufflé”\n\nAlbert Camus is one of the most famous absurdist philosophers\n\nExistentialism\n\nThe responsibility for giving one’s life meaning lies solely with the individual. This can be done by living passionately and sincerely while dealing with one’s emotions, actions and thoughts. This movement has often been associated with thinkers who refused to belong to any one particular school of thought claiming them to be remote from real life.\n\nExistentialism has its roots with 19th century philosophers Søren Kierkegaard and Friedrich Nietzsche even though the term was not used by either. Other existentialists include Simone de Beauvoir and Jean Paul Sartre, both great contributors to the popularity of this movement.\n\nNihilism\n\nThe origin comes from the Latin word ‘nihil’ meaning ‘nothing’. While existentialism focuses on the individual’s responsibility for giving meaning to their life, nihilism proclaims that life has no purpose, morality has no innate existence, and knowledge is not possible. Nothing we do has any value whatsoever (happy right ?).\n\nFew philosophers were proponent of this ideology (I wonder why…), and even Nietzsche, who studied it extensively, was critical of nihilism and its potential consequences.\n\nShakespeare eloquently summarised existential nihilism in Macbeth when saying: “Out, out, brief candle! Life’s but a walking shadow, a poor player that struts and frets his hour upon the stage and then is heard no more; it is a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, Signifying nothing.”\n\nAestheticism\n\nOn a happier note, other branches have preferred to focus on the good things life has to offer. Aestheticism claims life should be based on creating and enjoying beauty. It comes as no surprise that it has often been described as the philosophy of art and beauty.\n\nEven though few philosophers exclusively chose aesthetics as their branch, a lot of them included it in their broader philosophy. Friedrich Hegel held that art is an objective revelation of beauty while Arthur Schopenhauer, the first openly atheist major philosopher, posited that it effectively goes beyond the realm of sufficient reason making it more objective than the scientific viewpoint.\n\nAnthropocentrism\n\nOne of the more (perhaps the most) human-centred philosophical thoughts aimed to prove that the universe’s reason for being was the existence of humans. They hence have a value superior to all other organisms (must be hard to find an anthropocentric vegan).\n\nCynicism\n\nEven though the term revolves around the absence of belief in the goodness of other humans, where selflessness, altruism and honesty are discarded as only covering an always present self-interest; philosophical cynicism is completely different. Cynics believed the purpose of life to be virtue in accordance with nature. Rejecting conventional desires such as wealth, power, fame and sex (yes sex) would allow them to live a possession-less happy simple life.\n\nDiogenes of Sinope, a Greek philosopher who adhered to this school of thought, is believed to have begged for a living and slept in a large ceramic jar in Athens’s marketplace.\n\nStoicism\n\nBased on the moral ideas of cynicism, stoicism is a school of thought that claims that a way to a happier life is through emotional and physical self-control, in turn leading to inner peace and strength.\n\nOften seen in contrast to hedonism, stoicism doesn’t necessarily require its adherers to ignore pleasures, though it does preach freedom from passion to avoid becoming a slave of one’s pleasures.\n\nOne of the most famous stoics was the Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius.\n\nHedonism\n\nHedonists believe pleasure to be the only intrinsic good, the ultimate goal, holy grail of self fulfilment. Behaviours and actions are evaluated based on the amount of pleasure they can procure.\n\nHedonism has often been condemned by religious institutions who saw it as inconsistent with the emphasis of sin avoidance. Epicureanism, inspired by the teachings of Epicurus, a 3rd century BC Greek philosopher, preached a more moderate approach emphasising happiness more as a state of tranquillity than pleasure.\n\nDeism\n\nWe can infer that a supreme being created the universe through observation and reasoning. This bypasses the need for organised religion since this deity, this non-interventionist creator, does not meddle in human affairs. God, in this scenario, is merely the entity that flicked the switch at the beginning of time. A similar view is shared by Pantheism claiming nature and God to be one and the same.\n\nThough the roots of deism lie with Heraclitus and Plato in ancient Greece, it flourished in 17th century England and France with Lord Herbert of Cherbury, Voltaire, Montaigne and Rousseau being major proponents of this philosophical branch.\n\nEmotivism\n\nAll moral statements and judgements are nothing but expressions of one’s own attitude with the intention of changing the actions and attitudes of others. Moral statements being therefore meaningless and only expressing the speaker’s feeling, the first half of a statement such as “it was wrong to kill John” adds nothing to the (non-moral) information contained within it. Often referred to as the “hurray/boo” theory, emotivism involves an effect that the speaker is trying to have on the person they are addressing. Telling someone they shouldn’t steal is less an attempt to indicate that people disapprove of stealing than it is to try and get them to disapprove of it. A. J. Ayer is among the most famous emotivists.\n\nEmpiricism\n\nKnowledge can only be gathered through sense experience. Experience, evidence and sensory perception all play a major role in the formation of ideas.\n\nThree major English philosophers: John Locke, George Berkeley and David Hume greatly contributed to the expansion of the empiricist movement. They rigorously defended it against…\n\nRationalism\n\nOn the other side of the spectrum lies rationalism in its belief that the mind can apprehend some truths without the need for senses, serving as a potential source of all knowledge.\n\nAnother three famous philosophers, a French, a Dutch and a German (walk into a bar…) served as exponents of this school of thought; they were: René Descartes, Baruch Spinoza and Gottfried Leibniz.\n\nImmanuel Kant, started as a rationalist and ended up developing an influential rationalism of his own trying to somewhat bridge rationalist and empiricist traditions after being strongly influenced by David Hume’s work.\n\nEpiphenomenalism\n\nThis one assumes that physical events can have an effect on mental processes while the opposite is impossible, i.e mental processes have no physical effects whatsoever (Rhonda Byrne, author of “The Secret” would strongly disagree.)\n\n“If a tree falls in the forest, and no animal is near by to hear it, does it make a sound ?”\n\nIdealism\n\nIf your answer to the previous question is ‘no’, then you may belong to the idealist school of thought (in that context). One’s experience has its basis in mental activity. The only thing we can know is consciousness.\n\nOne of the many positions of this movement is Subjective Idealism, also termed Solipsism. A personal favourite, solipsism argues that objects only exist by virtue of our perception of them. For example, when you are talking on the phone with someone, and you hang up, that person ceases to exist until you can perceive them (hear, see, smell, touch… taste?) again. Everything around you is a construction of your mind. If you were to completely block all your senses, then the entire world would disappear, only to reappear once your senses were back.\n\nRealism\n\nIf your answer to the previous question is ‘yes’, the tree does make a sound because sound is simply a wave that does not require a listener to exist, then realists are the clan you might want to join. Reality exists independently of observers and has an objective value.\n\nConclusion"
