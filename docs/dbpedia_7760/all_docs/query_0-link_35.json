ULLMERWestern Carolina UniversityAbstract: An understanding <strong>of</strong> the precise nature <strong>of</strong> the <strong>scientific</strong><strong>method</strong> <strong>of</strong> <strong>Sir</strong> <strong>William</strong> <strong>Petty</strong> has proved elusive to historians <strong>of</strong>economic thought, in no small part because <strong>of</strong> a lack <strong>of</strong> <strong>Petty</strong>’sown characterization <strong>of</strong> his <strong>scientific</strong> approach. This research clarifiesthe nature <strong>of</strong> <strong>Petty</strong>’s <strong>method</strong>, as to whether it was primarily inductiveor deductive, and to what extent it relied on empirical foundations.<strong>The</strong> paper employs a two-pronged analysis. First, it examines the mainsources <strong>of</strong> <strong>Petty</strong>’s <strong>method</strong>: the works <strong>of</strong> <strong>Sir</strong> Francis Bacon and ThomasHobbes, and the synergistic influences <strong>of</strong> the Hartlib Circle, the RoyalSociety, the Dublin Philosophical Society, and the Mersenne group.Second, four <strong>of</strong> <strong>Petty</strong>’s most noted contributions to political economyare deconstructed in order to identify his <strong>scientific</strong> <strong>method</strong>. Thisresearch concludes that <strong>Petty</strong> relied almost exclusively on deductionin his <strong>scientific</strong> approach and that his analysis does not reveal anyinductive reasoning. When data was available, <strong>Petty</strong> constructed hiseconomic theories on empirical foundations.Keywords: deduction, empiricism, natural law, rationalismJEL Classification: A11, B11, B31, B41<strong>Sir</strong> Francis Bacon’s (1561-1626) innovative <strong>scientific</strong> <strong>method</strong> wascharacterized by two distinct but related components: empiricism andinductive reasoning. With respect to the first element, he insisted uponempirical foundations <strong>for</strong> establishing new knowledge. Accordingly,Bacon writes in Book I, Aphorism LXXXII <strong>of</strong> Novum organum that“a <strong>method</strong> rightly ordered leads by an unbroken route through thewoods <strong>of</strong> experience to the open ground <strong>of</strong> axioms” (Bacon [1620] 1963,vol. 4, 81). With respect to the inductive element <strong>of</strong> his <strong>scientific</strong><strong>method</strong>, in a letter to King James I <strong>of</strong> England, dated October 12, 1620,Bacon writes: “<strong>The</strong> work […] is no more than a new logic, teaching toAUTHOR’S NOTE: I am grateful to my sister, Jean Bailly, <strong>for</strong> her valuable suggestions andeditorial comments. I would also like to thank the anonymous referees and an editor <strong>of</strong>this journal, François Claveau, <strong>for</strong> their helpful comments. Finally, I appreciate thegenerosity <strong>of</strong> the Thompson Library at Ohio State University in lending me anelectronic copy <strong>of</strong> the Hartlib papers (Hartlib 2002)."
