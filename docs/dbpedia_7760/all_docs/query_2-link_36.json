Through the programs at McMaster, I was able to work directly with professors and their labs to learn the ins and outs of research, while getting my own hands-on experience. This took my learning outside of the classroom and encouraged me to consider the different types of careers I could pursue following my degree.\n\nWhat do you find beneficial about your program?\n\nAnthropology allowed me to explore a wide variety of topics and research interests. As someone who felt drawn towards biological anthropology and archaeology, I felt like I could combine these interests to really get the most out of my degree in terms of information and experience.\n\nIn your opinion, what is the value of a Social Science degree?\n\nSocial Science allows students to receive a more holistic form of education which centres the wide variety of human perspectives and experiences within our communities. Throughout my degree, I felt like I was gaining valuable information which could benefit me in any career I chose to pursue. Social Science focused so closely on the human experience that it taught me the value of community, allyship, and the pursuit of making a world more safe and accessible for all.\n\nWhat advice would you give to a current student interested in career options?\n\nI would say, try as many opportunities?as possible! There is no telling what career in Social Sciences may interest you. And don’t feel limited by what program you are in – the career you’re interested in could be within your field or could be connected to it in a cool way.?I personally used my degree in Anthropology and Indigenous Studies to pursue a work focused on cultural retention within Afrocentric communities. If there is not a career, lab, or research that you feel properly suits your passion, don’t worry – there is always the potential for you to be the one to bring your passion to life!\n\nWhat advice would you give a future student interested in the department or programs?\n\nIf you are interested in topics like science, history, health, community, and culture (especially your own), you will feel at home in the Anthropology program! It truly allows you to flex your own interests while gaining valuable information that will benefit you in any career. Anthropology is so much more than the limited scope we often see portrayed in the media (ex. Indiana Jones) – it is an opportunity for you to experiment with a wide range of ideas?and to work alongside students who are all passionate about widely different topics."
