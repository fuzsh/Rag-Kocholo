        "text": "John Graunt (born April 24, 1620, Londonâ€”died April 18, 1674, London) was an English statistician, generally considered to be the founder of the science of demography, the statistical study of human populations. His analysis of the vital statistics of the London populace influenced the pioneer demographic work of his friend Sir William Petty and, even more importantly, that of Edmond Halley, the astronomer royal.\n\nA prosperous haberdasher until his business was destroyed in the London fire of 1666, Graunt held municipal offices and a militia command. While still active as a merchant, he began to study the death records that had been kept by the London parishes since 1532. Noticing that certain phenomena of death statistics appeared regularly, he was inspired to write Natural and Political Observations . . . Made upon the Bills of Mortality (1662). He produced four editions of this work; the third (1665) was published by the Royal Society, of which Graunt was a charter member."
