        "text": "On February 17, 1827 an assemblage of distinguished minds from Baltimore’s medical community gathered at the home of Dr. Richard Sprigg Steuart for the inaugural meeting of a new scientific and medical organization. Among those present were Dr. William Donaldson, Sprigg’s medical partner; Dr. H.H. Hayden, dentist and future founder of Baltimore College of Dental Surgery; Dr. Joshua I. Cohen, of the prominent Baltimore family; Doctors G.S. Gibson, Patrick Macaulay, and G.S. Sproston; chemist and geologist Julius Ducatel, and Mr. Edward Denison. The Baltimore Phrenological Society was born.(1)\n\nPhrenology (from the Greek phren for mind and logos for discourse or knowledge) is a pseudoscience that purports to measure a person’s psychological, intellectual, and personality capacities through the study of the size and shape of the skull. The man largely responsible for ushering in the modern era of phrenology at the end of the eighteenth century was Austrian physician Franz Joseph Gall (1758-1828).\n\nThe basic premise of phrenology, laid out by Gall in The Anatomy and Physiology of the Nervous System in General, and of the Brain in Particular, with Observations upon the possibility of ascertaining the several Intellectual and Moral Dispositions of Man and Animal, by the configuration of their Heads, published in 1819, is that the human mind consists of 27 faculties—character, personality, and intellectual traits—each with its own “organ” or region in the brain. These range from: reproductive instincts, aptitude for being educated, satire and wit, kindness, and the love of one’s offspring to poetic talent, mathematical abilities, pride, guile, and murderous instincts. Later phrenological practitioners expanded the number of faculties to 40 or more.\n\nAccording to Gall, the brain is shaped by these organs, which vary in size according to the individual—the larger the organ the more pronounced the specific trait would be exhibited in the subject. The skull, in turn, is shaped by the development of the organs, producing the various bumps, protuberances and crevices that make each human skull unique. Thus, to the practiced phrenologist the “surface of the skull can be read as an accurate index of psychological aptitudes and tendencies.”(2)\n\nAlthough today phrenology is dismissed as a pseudoscience, some of its tenets—that certain functions are localized in the brain, and that specific areas of the brain can grow with use—are scientifically accepted fact. But for a time in the nineteenth century and into the twentieth century it was accepted by large numbers of people that a person’s character, intelligence, and personality could be gleaned by precise measurements of the the bumps on the skull.\n\nPhrenology emerged in England in the 1790s, promoted principally by Gall and his student Johann Gaspar Spurzheim; by the late 1820s it had crossed the Atlantic and began to attract followers in the United States precipitating a boom in popularity that lasted until the 1840s. Societies and organizations promoting phrenology and providing head readings emerged, with the first established in Edinburgh, England in 1820.\n\nBy the end of the 1820s phrenological enthusiasts were meeting in cities in the United States. Following its founding in February of 1827, the Baltimore Phrenological Society grew from nine to 22 members, attracting prominent Marylanders such as lawyer John H.B. Latrobe, William Ellicott, grandson of the founder of Ellicott Mills, author and statesman John Pendleton Kennedy, and State Senator and Judge William Frick. The group gathered on a weekly basis at member’s homes to discuss the merits of phrenology, host lectures, and measure skulls.\n\nThe main tools of the practicing phrenologist were calipers, used for “ascertaining the general size of the head,” and the craniometer, which measured “the length from the medulla oblongata, or top of the spinal marrow, where each organ originates, to the point where it reaches the surface of the brain.”(3) Both devices involved inserting metal rods into the subjects ears. The Baltimore organization examined the heads of Baltimoreans, both young and old, male and female, prominent and obscure. Among those who sat for readings were Prince Charles Bonaparte, Solomon Etting, and William Wirt. The group also recorded measurements of their own skulls. John H.B. Latrobe “organs” were larger than his fellow members in 12 of 25 categories measured, including firmness, benevolence, and wit but smallest in philoprogenitiveness (love of one’s offspring). John Pendleton Kennedy scored highest in self-esteem and love of approbation.\n\nJohn Pendleton Kennedy was connected with one of the more famous advocates of phrenology, Edgar Allen Poe. While in Baltimore in the early 1830s, Poe became acquainted with Kennedy, who seems to have helped him get hired as an editor and critic with the Southern Literary Messenger, a literary journal published out of Richmond, Virginia. Poe became fascinated with phrenology around the time he was in Baltimore in the mid-1830s. In a book review of Phrenology and the Moral Influence of Phrenology by Mrs. L. Miles published in the journal in 1836, Poe boldly asserted that,\n\n“Phrenology is no longer to be laughed at. It is no longer laughed at by men of common understanding. It has assumed the majesty of a science; and, as a science, ranks among the most important which can engage the attention of thinking beings…with proper caution, and well-directed inquiry, individuals may obtain, through the science, a perfectly accurate estimate of their own moral capabilities – and thus instructed, will be the better fitted for decision in regard to a choice of offices and duties in life.”(4)\n\nThe novelist, editor, and poet would go on to include references to phrenology in some of his stories, such as “The Imp of the Perverse,” published in 1845.\n\nBy the 1840s, the “science” of phrenology had been essentially discredited. The Baltimore Phrenological Society appears to have been a short-lived enterprise, lasting less than two years. However, following a visit and lecture from phrenologist Lorenzo Niles Fowler in 1847, another society was established in the city. Lorenzo, along with his brother Orson Squire Fowler, was largely responsible for a revival of popular interest in phrenology beginning in the 1860s and continuing into the early twentieth century. This brand of phrenology, was less scientific and more entrepreneurial than its predecessor, with practitioners charging fees to read heads. It also was used, along with the close related physiognomy, in support of theories of racial superiority. While the British Phrenological Society founded by Lorenzo Fowler in 1887 carried on until 1967, there is no evidence that the second incarnation of the Baltimore Phrenological Society survived the nineteenth century.

It occurred fifty years ago and was of an entirely different sort. On September 13, 1964, The Beatles invaded Baltimore for a one-day stop during their first American tour. John, Paul, George, and Ringo played two concerts at the Civic Center (today know as the Baltimore Arena) and then quickly moved on to the remaining stops on their 32-performance tour schedule from August 19 to September 20.\n\nBaltimore photographer Morton Tadder was there to document the performances. Born in 1929, Tadder began working as a photographer’s assistant while still in high school and over the next six decades established himself as one of Maryland’s premiere commercial photographers. His clients included McCormick, Baltimore magazine, U.S. Steel Corporation, and Playboy. He was also the official photographer for both the Orioles and the Colts.(1) Tadder was hired by the London Express to photograph the Fab Four for what would be their only Baltimore appearance. The newspaper asked him to only shoot only one roll of film, but Tadder ended up filling up more than ten rolls, capturing the Beatles in concert (only the afternoon performance), the between show press conference, and the masses of teenage girls.\n\nThe Beatles visit to Baltimore was typical of any of the group’s appearances at the height of Beatlemania: screaming girls, press conferences, high security, car chases, and hiding in hotels. The music itself was almost incidental. Crowds gathered all day outside the Civic Center and the Holiday Inn across the street, where the Beatles were staying, in an attempt to catch a glimpse of the group. Two girls unsuccessfully tried to deliver themselves to the concert in a box marked “Beatles Fan Mail.” Another girl, intent on fulfilling her plan to marry Ringo, persuaded a Civic Center employee to show her the Beatles dressing room. She left a note with her telephone number and “I love you Ringo” affixed to some coat hangers.\n\nAn estimated 26,000 screaming fans packed into the Civic Center for the two concerts. Seventy-one police officers were lined up three deep in the orchestra pit in front of the stage. After sitting in patient anticipation through the opening acts—Bill Black’s Combo, The Exciters, Clarence ‘Frogman’ Henry, and Jackie DeShannon—the crowd exploded in shrieks and applause when the Beatles hit the stage. Although little could be heard of their performance above the din of the audience, the group ran through a set list of 12 songs: “Twist and Shout,” “You Can’t Do That,” “All My Loving,” “She Loves You,” “Things we Said Today,” “Roll Over Beethoven,” “Can’t Buy Me Love,” “If I Fell, I Want to Hold Your Hand,” “Boys,” “A Hard Day’s Night,” and “Long Tall Sally.”\n\nAfter an all night private party held at La Ronde, the revolving restaurant perched atop the Holiday Inn, the Beatles left the hotel by limousine destined for more of the same hysteria in Pittsburgh, the next stop on the tour. Despite the party, the frenzied pace of touring, and general condition of being a Beatle, The Sun reported that the group departed Baltimore looking “fresh and restive.” George and Paul “were neatly dressed in suits and blue shirts, Ringo was tie-less, and John, in sunglasses, long-hair and white shirt with bold black spots, looked like a blind Dalmatian.”(2) (Damon Talbot)\n\nUnderbelly would like to thank Morton Tadder for granting permission to use his photographs. Captions for the photographs below were taken from various contemporary articles from the Baltimore Sun and the Washington Post.\n\nBeginning on September 14, an exhibit of Tadder’s Beatles photographs will be on display at the Unicorn Gallery, 626 South Broadway.

The city’s public school system had already grappled with these changes, gradually integrating some teacher activities, adult education classes, and even its premier college preparatory high school: Baltimore Polytechnic Institute.(1)\n\nWhen the Supreme Court’s decision came down on May 17, 1954, many local officials had at least begun thinking about the practical implications. Education officials were confident that civility would win out. The school board had decided to continue with its free choice enrollment system, only changing any stipulation related to race. Effectively, Baltimore parents could select any school for their children to attend, unless there was an issue of overcrowding. Superintendent John Fischer was intent on avoiding any accusation of “social engineering” that might result from forced integration by redistricting or busing. No white students would be forcibly enrolled in the “colored schools,” or vice versa for black students.\n\nThe nation’s attention was also focused on Baltimore, one of the first school systems below the Mason-Dixon line to voluntarily desegregate following the ruling. The city schools, with an enrollment of about 141,000 students, officially opened on an integrated basis on September 7, 1954. Only six white students chose to attend formerly all-black schools, none in the secondary grades. Nearly 1,600 African-American students would enter 49 formerly all-white schools, accounting for less 3 percent of total black enrollment.(2)(3) Many, such as Emily Price who transferred to Eastern High School, wanted to take advantage of unique programs that they had no access to before integration. An Afro article from September 11 reported that “Emily plans to take a commercial course in preparation for a stenographic job which she hopes to obtain here after she finishes her education.”(4) However, there was no direct mention of her or any other black student’s experience as they entered these environments.\n\nNot every school could count on as smooth a transition as might have been experienced at specialized institutions with largely middle-class populations, as Eastern and Poly were. White parents from Charles Carroll Barrister Elementary School in working class southwest Baltimore employed several tactics to protest the integration of twelve African-American students into the formerly segregated school.(5) After demands for a meeting with system superintendent John Fischer were declined, thirty white women picketed the school and attempted to dissuade students from attending. Their homemade signs included messages such as “Segregation Is Our Heritage” and “Are We Satisfied? No. We Want Our Rights.” The protesters were actually successful in the short run, as only 169 of 587 reported for school that day. However, these efforts fizzled out as the school board showed no signs of yielding to anti-integration sentiment. None of the affected students spoke to reporters, one African-American parent asserted, “My child is going to stay in there,” as others praised the treatment by teachers.(6)\n\nThe most highly publicized, and potentially violent, protest occurred at Southern High School. The institution, then located at the corner of William Street and Warren Avenue in Federal Hill, was set to enroll thirty-six African-American students in an overall population of almost 1,800. Baltimore Sun reporters described a chaotic scene taking place outside of the school, on October 1, 1954:\n\n“Hundreds of students participated in picketing, while others circled the building in automobiles, trucks and jeeps, shouting their objections to desegregation.”(7) While most of the protesters were students at the school, women, young children and other whites from the community were also represented. Several small skirmishes in the area led to at least six arrests. Twenty-four-year-old Jack Zimmerman was detained after he struck 14-year old Leon Thompson, a black student who was being escorted from the school by police. Law enforcement and other officials feared that the situation would develop into a full-scale riot, as nearly one thousand anti-integrationists surrounded Southern. Luckily, the nearly fifty police officers in the vicinity were able to keep things largely under control. Walter Sondheim, then president of the city school board, also gave credit to the school’s leadership and student body. In a 1971 interview he said:\n\n“The kids at Southern High School were great! The captain of the football team and the president of the class walked out of Southern High School, I remember seeing them—actually acting as a kind of a body guard escort for colored kids. You know, a magnificent example. The thing brought almost an air of good feeling in Baltimore.”(8)\n\nSondheim may have employed a bit of revisionist history, especially considering that about half of Southern’s student body had left school to participate in the protests themselves. In both situations, news reporters and local officials were quick to cite the purported influence of the National Association for Advancement of White People. This organization led by Bryant Bowles had gained support through its highly publicized protests against integration in Milford, Delaware. He had since attempted to capitalize on the attention by setting up operations in Baltimore, though the actual impact on local incidents is unclear.(9)\n\nPerhaps the most glaring omission from the varied media accounts of events in Baltimore is the perspective of the students and teachers who were on the front lines of desegregation. Even articles which specifically mention, or have pictures of those participants, hardly give any voice to them. A piece from The New York Times addressed the issues at Southern, featuring the story of Becky Kekenes, a white teacher who had driven two black students away from the mob. The author noted that, “within a few days, she was reduced to tears by a series of goads and insults.” Her perspective was apparently ignored in the local press, while those of the few African-American students at the school were similarly omitted.\n\nThe week after the incidents in South Baltimore, tempers around the city were still simmering. Hundreds of white students, primarily from Merganthaler Vocational-Tech High School, left school to march against integration though only three black students were enrolled there. Newspaper reports claimed that these boys were rebuffed by students at City College and Polytechnic, when they attempted to rally support for the “strike.” Heading towards City Hall, the mob of young men carried signs saying “They Go or We Go, Mervo.”(10) They were ultimately dispersed by Police Commissioner Beverly Ober, who had been quite active during the previous week.\n\nAfter meeting with leaders from the school system and city over the weekend, Ober broadcasted a stern warning over radio and television. The disturbances would no longer be tolerated, and any further action would lead to mass arrests. This announcement, along with similar threats of suspension from several principals, caused the public outcry to settle down. A commission of the state government later praised the black community as “a model of controlled emotions and disciplined calmness” in the face of these various protests.(11) Certainly any organized resistance against white anger could have blown up the proverbial powder keg. Still, many individuals did seek to actively exercise their rights despite the significant risk involved.\n\nKieffer Mitchell Sr., whose father Clarence Mitchell was the NAACP Washington Bureau director, was one of seven African-American students to transfer into Gwynns Falls Park Junior High in West Baltimore. Clarence later recounted that his son was “struck in the face” by a white man who was there to protest. His account appeared in the NAACP magazine, The Crisis, but not in the local press. Mitchell went on to organize a counter-protest against anti-integrationist whites, who had begun targeting his son’s school. Kieffer recalled that he had a lonely experience at the school, where white students were either actively hostile or ignored him altogether.(12) The mixture of fear, anger, and unfamiliarity must have led to many more confrontations, left unreported by those invested in painting a positive picture of the situation.\n\nDescribing her experiences at Garrison Junior High School as an African-American in the 1950s, Ruth Stewart remembered:\n\n“That was terrible. You would be walking with your little food, and they would stick their foot out and trip you. And you wouldn’t say anything because you was scared … And they would take my money… take my coat… stuff like that. Not that we weren’t doing stuff to them too, but they had us outnumbered.”\n\nDespite her mother’s warning, Stewart was not prepared to passively absorb the disrespect. She recalled being in several fights during her time at Garrison, largely in response to white students who “would call me all kind’s of black this and the other.” Ultimately, she was expelled from the school.(13) Neither the Sun nor the Afro seemed to address such incidences of interracial violence, though Ruth Stewart’s experience was likely not uncommon in the city schools.\n\nG. James Fleming, a Morgan State professor writing in The Journal of Negro Education soon after the 1956 school year, provided a largely statistical analysis of the effectiveness of desegregation in all of Maryland’s county systems. The number of integrated schools in the system increased to 85 during the second full year, and the number of black students in formerly white schools more than doubled to around 4,000. Fleming also cited 300 white students who chose to attend summer school at Douglass High School with about 900 black students, noting, “Again, there was no incident.” The author also quotes Dr. Houston R. Jackson, an African-American assistant superintendent, as saying, “The reception of Negro pupils and teachers has been phenomenal.”(14)\n\nWhile Baltimore did not experience the type of wide-scale violence and intimidation tactics that plagued integrating districts around the country, it would be naive to conclude that this was a success story for desegregation. White Baltimoreans were much more likely to express their opinions privately, through their school choices and residential mobility. The school population of both races had been increasing steadily through the 1940’s and early 1950’s but that trend would quickly shift. White enrollment began to decrease after 1956, and continued to do so at a rate of nearly 2,000 students per, for the next twenty years.(15)\n\nThe city school system would become majority African-American in 1960, just six years after it had desegregated. Certainly more students were in class with those of the other race, but this improvement was minimal as well. In 1961, nearly three quarters of the city’s schools were over 90 percent black or white, a figure that remained steady through the 1970’s.(16) Some, like Garrison Junior High and Lake Clifton High School, effectively shifted from completely white to predominantly black student bodies over a ten year period after integration. During the same time frame, the city itself lost about 100,000 white residents to the suburban counties.\n\nBaltimore, once touted as the model for effective school desegregation, ultimately found that the laissez-faire approach could not ensure that children of different races would be educated together. By 1973, the U.S. Office of Civil Rights was threatening to withhold federal funds, charging that the city was not doing enough to integrate its schools. The city was one of eighty-four districts to be targeted by the OCR, hardly an outlier in the difficulties faced by the nation’s public schools. Regardless, Walter Sondheim’s “air of good feeling” did not last long as Baltimore would eventually be seen as a black city, with several pockets of white neighborhoods. Its schools still struggle with segregation today, hampered by many of the same fears and misunderstandings that characterized the nation 60 years ago.

The once proud building is one of our favorite neighbors and we were all concerned. Most of us instinctually reached for our iPhones. James Singewald, Imaging Services technician and staff photographer, grabbed his camera.\n\nWord spread quickly around the MdHS campus that the Mayfair was on fire. A coworker could see it from the window in his office. Then phones started ringing. Upon arriving it seemed most of the fire was in the building next door. Only the south corner of the theater was burning, though it appeared very charred. There have been conflicting reports on where the blaze started and we’re still not sure how it began. According to City Paper, the fire started in the Mayfair, but The Baltimore Sun reported that it started in the rear of the building next door, formerly known as the Golden Horse. The fire spread from 500 to 508 North Howard, with 504 N. Howard receiving the brunt of the damage. All of these buildings have been vacant, neglected, and deteriorating for years now.\n\nFrom about 1824 to the mid- or late-1960s, the two buildings at the northwest corner of Howard and Franklin Streets [500-504], served as a hotel. From 1824-1840 William Frame operated the Golden Horse Tavern on the site. From 1840-1858, the hotel was operated by Daniel McCoy (1807-1872). The name was changed to the Franklin House in 1859 when it was sold to George Leisenring. Since then the hotel has been known as the Delphey House, Academy Hotel, New Academy Hotel, Stanley Hotel, and the New Stanley Hotel. In the 1940s there was a Read’s Drug Store in the corner building [500-502], and in 1948, the New Stanley Hotel was operating in the smaller building next door [504]. The last known business that operated there was a clothing store called Bottoms that had a sister shop called Tops on the 400 block of North Howard which is now the home of Current Gallery.\n\nThe site of the former Mayfair Theater has undergone many changes over more than a century. Originally, this was the location of the livery stables for the adjoining Franklin House hotel, mentioned above. In 1876 Silas Conn dubbed them the Academy Stables in honor of the neighboring Academy of Music. The stables last appeared in a City Directory in 1878 and were probably demolished soon after. By 1880 they had been replaced by the Natatorium, Baltimore’s first indoor swimming club. It was built by the Natatorium and Physical Culture Association of Baltimore City, which was formed by Dr. James A. Steuart. In 1885 the building was acquired by the Oratorio Society, and by 1890, James Lawrence Kernan bought the building with intention of converting it into a theater. He changed the name of the building to the Howard Auditorium and reopened it on April 6, 1891. Soon after, the name was shortened to Auditorium, which it was called for the next 49 years.\n\nKernan had long planned to build a brand new theater on this site, but wasn’t able to until 1903. In the meantime, he converted the Auditorium into a skate rink known as the Ice Palace for year round skating. His palace was plagued with operational problems, as one can imagine a year-round ice ink located in Baltimore in the 1890s would be, and by 1895, Kernan decided again to remodel the building into a vaudeville theater. Within less than a year from its re-opening, Kernan converted the Auditorium into a concert hall.\n\nIn 1902, Kernan announced plans for the “greatest entertainment complex ever built in Baltimore, the Million Dollar Triple Enterprise.” The Auditorium and the site adjacent to it were selected for a complex comprising of two theaters and a luxury hotel. The Maryland Theater was built around the corner at Franklin and Eutaw and opened on March 19, 1903. The original Auditorium was demolished in 1903 and the new Auditorium was built on the same site and opened on September 12, 1904. Kernan called it “without question the coziest and prettiest theater of its size in America.” On December 24, 1904, Kernan opened the Turkish baths in the basement of the Auditorium. The grand opening of the Million Dollar Triple Enterprise took place on September 4, 1905. It was described as “the greatest combination of buildings in the world.” (1)\n\nDuring most of the 1920s and ’30s the Auditorium presented stock shows and by 1929, the theater was redecorated and wired for sound featuring two-a-day movies and a large orchestra. After a few shows, the theater went dark. The theater did not open again until November 1929 and by 1932 it was once again struggling. Financial hardships forced the Kernan Company to sell the properties. In July 1932, the Penn Mutual Life Insurance Company of Philadelphia bought all three properties at auction for $225,000. Even with new ownership and mix of shows, movies, conventions, and even lectures, by the late 1930s the Auditorium was not able to stay open. In the summer of 1940, C.W. Hicks acquired the theater. After more re-modeling, the theater re-opened in 1941 entirely as a movie house, and was re-named the Mayfair. In 1957 it was acquired by JF Theatres, a Maryland chain ran by Jack Fruchtman that also controlled the Parkway and the Times (now The Charles) among others.(2) Its final re-modeling came in 1963, for the Baltimore premier of Lawrence of Arabia.\n\nThe Mayfair remained an operating movie theater until 1986 when it was put up for auction. The bid minimum was not met and it has remained vacant since. The city acquired the building the following year. In 1993 there was a glimmer of hope when the mayor announced a plan to make Howard Street the “Avenue of the Arts.” The plan never came to fruition. The roof collapsed in 1998 and the Mayfair has continued to deteriorate. Before the fire last week, workers had begun dismantling the theater’s marquee, recently deemed a safety hazard.\n\nThe future remains uncertain for the Mayfair, or rather its shell. The roof collapse and the fire do not bode well for it. On the other hand, the old structure is a survivor and with the revitalization of the Hippodrome, and renovation plans underway for old theaters like the Parkway and the Centre, one can hold out hope that the Mayfair, or at least its facade, will be added to the list of Baltimore’s historic theaters and buildings to be preserved.

The Orioles entered the game with a slim first place lead over the Montreal Royals, while the Chiefs were fighting to stay out of last place. Nonetheless, the Chiefs jumped out to a 4-1 lead. The Orioles scored two in the sixth and one in the seventh to push the game into extra innings. However, the Chiefs would then erupt for seven runs in the tenth inning, sparked by a grand slam from 17-year-old shortstop Bob “Orb” Carson.[1] The Orioles still maintained their hold on first place, but the game became known for another reason. Unknown to any of the participants at the time, the game would be the last one played at Oriole Park.\n\nThe park’s wooden structure left it vulnerable to fire. After every game the grounds crew, consisting of Mike Schofield and Howard “Doc” Seiss, watered down the stands in order to extinguish all cigar and cigarette butts. They followed the same procedure after the Chiefs’ victory on July 3. However, in the early morning hours of July 4, a fire started by the third base grandstand. The flames quickly engulfed the stadium, a result of the creosote used to protect the wooden structure from decay. Schofield described the scene as a “sheet of fire.” The heat became so intense that it cracked windows in nearby houses, damaged cars and businesses, and melted the asphalt on 29th Street. In all, the fire forced fifteen hundred people to evacuate the neighborhood and caused $150,000 in damage. Along with the park, the Orioles lost the physical evidence of their history, as the fire destroyed photographs, trophies, and documents.[2]\n\nThe “sheet of fire” that burned Oriole Park provided a symbolic dividing line in Baltimore’s sporting history. The destruction of Oriole Park marked the beginning of the end to Baltimore’s minor league heritage. Yet, the fire’s aftermath showed Baltimore’s potential as a major league town. The city rallied around the Orioles as they pushed for the International League title. Facing off against the American Association’s Louisville Colonels in the Junior World Series, the Orioles and Baltimore gained national attention when one home game outdrew the Major League World Series taking place in St. Louis. Baltimore no longer represented a minor league city, but a city with major league potential that would not be fulfilled until the St. Louis Browns arrived ten years later.\n\nKnown initially as Terrapin Park, the stadium had ironically been built in 1914 to mark Baltimore’s return to the major leagues. The city had a brief major league history. The Baltimore Orioles joined the American League in 1901. However, after the 1902 season, the team left for New York, becoming the Highlanders and then the Yankees. For twelve years, Baltimore lacked a major league team, though the International League Orioles filled the void admirably. In 1914, major league baseball returned to the city with the creation of the Federal League’s Baltimore Terrapins.[3] The Federal League stood as an “outlaw” league that competed against the established American and National leagues. For two seasons, the Terrapins played in the new stadium, but interference by the American and National leagues led to the dissolution of the Federal League after the 1915 season.[4]\n\nThe Terrapins cut into the gate receipts of the minor league Orioles who played across the street.[5] Their arrival forced the Orioles to make several financial decisions. In the summer of 1914, as the Terrapins played their first season in Baltimore, Orioles owner Jack Dunn sold the contract of Babe Ruth to the Boston Red Sox. Ruth, who had won 22-games with the Orioles and the Providence Grays that year, would go on to have a storied major league career with the Red Sox and the Yankees.[6] Dunn also sold the contracts of eleven other players to major league teams, and then moved the team itself to Richmond in order to make payroll. When the Federal League folded after the 1915 season, Dunn sold the team to Richmond-area investors. He then purchased the Jersey City Skeeters and moved them to Baltimore, playing games in the new stadium – now renamed Oriole Park.[7]\n\nFor the next twenty-eight-and-a-half seasons, the Orioles made Oriole Park their home, and played some of Baltimore’s best baseball. The Orioles won 100 games in 1919, and went on to win seven-straight International League titles. In the process, they made six-straight Little World Series appearances against the American Association champion, and won three of them. Oriole Park provided the venue for such players like Frederick “Fritz” Maisel and Robert Moses “Lefty” Grove. A speedster known as the “Catonsville Flash,” Maisel hit .336 in 1919 and stole sixty-three bases. Grove, a left-handed pitcher, won 108-games with the Orioles in five seasons before advancing to the majors, where he won 300-games in a Hall of Fame career with the Red Sox and Philadelphia A’s. The period from 1919 to 1925 represented one of the most impressive periods of baseball in Baltimore. While subsequent Oriole teams did not enjoy the same success, they did come close to winning the International League in 1936, 1937, and 1940.[8] The Orioles appeared headed for the post-season in 1944 when the fire destroyed Oriole Park.\n\nThe fire had a significant logistical impact on the team. When the fire struck, the Orioles were in the midst of a home stand, and held a slight first-place lead over the Royals. They had been slated to play an Independence Day double-header against the Chiefs. The fire cancelled the double-header, and, by night fall, the Royals gained first place. In the fire’s aftermath, the city agreed to give the Orioles use of its football field, the 65,000-seat Municipal Stadium. The grounds crew, though, needed time to adjust the field for baseball use. Consequently, the Orioles went on the road to complete their home stand against the Bears and the Jersey City Giants. On July 16, the Orioles returned to their new home to play a double-header against the Giants. The Orioles resoundingly won both games in front of 13,000 people.[9]\n\nAt the same time, the fire had a significant impact on the community and its relationship with the Orioles. Writer Jacques Kelly noted that “Oriole Park was one of those classic urban ball fields. The property seemed to be scissored out around rowhouses, a florist’s greenhouse, streetcar tracks and the village’s Episcopal church, St. John’s Huntingdon.”[10] The park defined a significant part of Greenmount Avenue, and the Orioles defined an important part of Baltimore as a whole. As a result, the city rallied around the team after the fire, turning out in large numbers at Municipal Stadium. Orioles General Manager Herb Armstrong estimated that 118,500 fans came out to the team’s first twelve home games in the new stadium. As the Orioles heated up for the stretch run, winning eighteen of nineteen games at one point, attendance rose. Columnist John Steadman noted that the Orioles played in front of 20,000 to 40,000 people. Those crowds would not have been possible in old Oriole Park, which seated approximately 11,000.[11]\n\nThe Orioles ultimately won their division on the last day of the 1944 season, and they went on to face the Newark Bears for the International League’s Governor’s Cup. In a series that went a full seven games, the Orioles won their first International League title since 1925, defeating the Bears in front of 14,747 drenched fans at Municipal Stadium.[12] The victory set the stage for the Junior World Series against the American Association champion Louisville Colonels. Beginning the series in Louisville, the Orioles took two of three on the road, including a then-record 14-inning contest in game three. The series shifted to Baltimore, where the Orioles and Colonels played before a crowd of 52,833 fans in game four. The Colonels won the game 5-4, but the Orioles rebounded by winning games five and six to win the Junior World Series.[13]\n\nThe fire to Oriole Park and its aftermath showed the nation Baltimore’s potential as a major league city. In Municipal Stadium, Baltimore had a facility where teams could play in front of large crowds. Game four of the Junior World Series highlighted Baltimore’s potential. Playing in front of 52,833 fans, the Orioles and Colonels actually outdrew a major league World Series game between the St. Louis Browns and St. Louis Cardinals, which drew fewer than 35,000 fans. In doing so, Baltimore received nationwide attention. Shirley Povich of The Washington Post noted how game four left the baseball world “gasping,” but, more importantly, the game helped mark “the resurgence of Baltimore as baseball town.”[14] That resurgence could not have happened but for the fire that destroyed Oriole Park in July 1944.\n\nThe “sheet of fire” that destroyed Oriole Park provided a major turning point in Baltimore’s quest for major league status. In the fire’s immediate aftermath, Rodger H. Pippen of the Baltimore News-Post predicted that “… what appears to be a baseball tragedy, may turn out to be a blessing in disguise. Baltimore rose from the ashes of its great fire in 1904 to be a bigger and better city. Our Orioles will come through just as soon as war conditions permit, with a bigger and better place for their games.”[15] Municipal Stadium showed off Baltimore’s potential as a location for major league teams seeking a new city. Using this potential, city officials even looked into measures to make Baltimore even more attractive, including plans to build the first-ever domed stadium in the United States. The domed stadium never materialized, but that did not prevent the Browns from moving to Baltimore in 1954 to become the Orioles.[16] Symbolically, the “sheet of fire” burned down Baltimore’s minor league image, allowing the city to rise from the ashes as a major league town.

The reserve clause allowed teams to control the contract rights of a player in perpetuity, even though players signed one-year contracts. By controlling the contract rights of a player, management could dictate the amount of money they paid out, which meant they usually paid the player below market value. Players could not change teams unless they were traded or outright released. In short, the teams owned the players. The Federal League did not adhere to the reserve clause, and thus created fierce competition between the three leagues. As a result, player salaries increased significantly and demonstrated the market potential of baseball players for the first time. In 1914-1915, the Federal League owners brought a lawsuit against the American and National leagues for violating antitrust laws. The judge hearing the case, Judge (and later first commissioner) Kenesaw Mountain Landis, let the case sit, urging both sides to negotiate. By 1915, several Federal League owners faced financial distress. The American and National leagues bought out several of these franchises. The Baltimore franchise rejected their buyout and unsuccessfully sought to bring a major league team to the city. When the Federal League lawsuit went to trial, the U.S. District Court sided with the Federal League. However, the Court of Appeals reversed the lower court’s decision, and the Supreme Court upheld the decision.

It was a relatively minor event during the American Revolution. But, it was one that demonstrated the incendiary climate of Maryland and divided loyalties of the colonists in the years leading up to the war, when a few chests of tea could rouse the passion of patriots across the colony.\n\nThe Peggy Stewart, a brigantine, loaded with goods consigned to the Thomas Charles Williams & Co., arrived in the port of Annapolis, Maryland from London, England on October 14, 1774. Hidden in the ship’s hull, unbeknownst to the ship’s captain, Richard Jackson, were seventeen and a half chests, over 2,000 pounds, of tea. The chests had been wrapped in blankets and surreptitiously loaded onto the brig, perhaps by Thomas Charles Williams, himself.\n\nIn order for the goods and the 53 indentured servants aboard the ship to come ashore, taxes had to be collected. This included paying the much-hated “tea tax,” which was passed by the British government in 1773, on the tea that had been smuggled on the Peggy Stewart. The tax expanded upon taxes on tea levied in the 1767 Townshend Acts and incited further protests and boycotts of English tea. In December, 1773, rebellious Bostonians, the Sons of Liberty, tossed tea from ships into the harbor during the infamous Boston Tea Party. Patriot leaders across the colonies passed resolutions to ban payment of these taxes. The colonists were growing more openly hostile to British rule. Despite this, the ship’s co-owner and local merchant, Anthony Stewart paid the customs on the imports, concerned over the ship’s leaky condition and the crew and passengers who had been aboard the ship for almost three months.\n\nWord spread of Stewart’s deed, which in truth was in line with the law, incensing the local patriots. He most likely understood the potential backlash to his act of paying the tax. Stewart had induced their ire before by defying bans on the importation of taxed goods and for his ardent support of the British. A committee of local merchants, lawyers, and other influential men had agreed to boycott certain British imports taxed under the Townshend Acts.* In 1769, Stewart and his father-in-law James Dick were first caught attempting to bring restricted goods into Maryland. It was decided that the illegal items would be stored indefinitely. Stewart and his father-in-law once again tried to bring unauthorized cargo into the colony aboard the Good Intent. This time, they faced stricter punishment, and the ship was returned to England without unloading any of its wares, not just the banned items. This previous punishment may have also impacted Stewart’s decision to pay the customs on the tea, because he worried that the Peggy Stewart would not withstand the autumn storms it would encounter on the return journey to London. To make matters worse for Stewart as he had recently openly revealed his Loyalist leanings. At a committee meeting, he opposed measures to prevent payment of debts to the British by Maryland citizens, becasue he had felt this would damage trade relations on both sides of the Atlantic.\n\nThe cards were stacked against Stewart when a meeting was convened to decide the fate of Stewart and the much maligned tea. Thomas Charles Williams’ brothers, Joseph and James, also faced reprimand as they were in their brother’s employ and guilty by association. Some accounts of the Annapolis Tea Party suggest the Williams brothers were the ones who discovered the tea and reported in to both Stewart and the Annapolis committee, but this did not exempt them from punishment. The men in attendance decided that burning the tea at the gallows in the town square would both demonstrate support for the actions in Boston and the patriot cause, as well as demonstrate the consequences of illegal importation. However, the group was persuaded by committee member Matthias Hammond to withhold judgment until more of the local leaders could weigh-in.\n\nStewart must have been terrified at the events unfolding in the square before him. He stood to lose his brand new ship, payment for the goods aboard the ship, as well as potentially his house and life. To add to his anxiety, his wife, Jean, was confined to bed at home after the recent birth of their daughter, Wilhelmina. He decided he could not “expose himself any longer to the Fury of a lawless mob,” and he and his father-in-law consented to burn the brig.(1) Stewart, Dick, and the Williams brothers were then conveyed to the ship to set fire to it.\n\nWhile aboard the ship, about to light it on fire, they received word that not everyone agreed that they should destroy the ship. They naturally hesitated, but they were once again threatened. Richard Jackson, the captain, testified that “Mr. Rezin Hammond and Mr. Charles Ridgley, who were then on Board, told Mr. Stewart…that if he did not Immediately set fire to the Brigantine that his House and Family would be in danger that night. (2).” The Peggy Stewart burned “with all her sails and Riggin standing and Colours flying…. (3).” The brig sank into the Annapolis harbor, and her ruins now lay beneath reclaimed land under Luce Hall at the United States Naval Academy.\n\nMatters in Annapolis did not improve for Stewart after his ship was destroyed, and the events of October 19th only cemented his loyalist position. He “continued on all occasions strenuously to oppose the Measures of the Enemies of Government he at Length became so obnoxious to Them that they sought every Opportunity to harass and distress Him….(4).” His unpopular politics even aroused so much anger “that he was hanged and burnt in Effigy in different Parts of the Province….(5).” Stewart was forced to flee Annapolis and his property seized. He eventually made his home in Halifax, Nova Scotia, and spent many years petitioning the British government for compensation for his losses as a loyal British citizen.\n\nHis business partner, Thomas Charles Williams, did not escape unscathed either. His brothers bore the brunt of the punishment in Annapolis, but the news of his treachery spread quickly across the colonies. Williams inconveniently arrived in New York the same day the account of the Annapolis Tea Party was published in the local newspapers. He was met with anger and threats, so he “fled out of the Town in Disguise and concealing himself in the Woods, for that Time escaped their Fury (6).” A bounty was placed upon his head, and search parties were sent after him. For three months, he eluded them until he finally gave himself up in Philadelphia. He was able to atone for his dastardly deeds by signing a letter dictated for him, but when it came time for him to take up arms against the British, he once again disappeared. He too spent years fighting to receive recompense for his lost property. (Lara Westwood)\n\n*The widespread protests across the colonies forced the British government to repeal most of the taxes put in place by the Townshend Acts in 1770, but the tax on tea remained and was expanded with the 1773 Tea Act.\n\nSources and Further Reading:\n\n(1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) Fischer Transcripts, ca. 1764-1851, MS 360, MdHS.\n\nBarker, Charles A.

The second part will be posted in January, 2015.)\n\nBaltimore has been lucky enough to host two storied professional football teams: the-team-that-must-not-be-named, ahem, the Colts and the two-time Super Bowl Champions Baltimore Ravens. Not to mention the fantastic local college and high school teams. Marylanders are a little spoiled when it comes to great football. When the Colts organization fled in the night to Indianapolis in 1984, Marylanders mourned the loss of their beloved football team. The team left behind almost forty years of faithful fandom and an historic stadium which welcomed some of the greatest athletes in football and baseball.\n\nThe famous Memorial Stadium began its varied career as the Venable Stadium, located on 33rd Street in Baltimore. The land surrounding 33rd Street was intended to become a grand park, similar to Druid Hill and Clifton Parks. To build this park, the city purchased the “Holyrood” estate from Kate French Taylor for $40,000 in 1907. The mansion was torn down to make way for park construction, but the project was halted and the area remained vacant for years. An abandoned clay brick quarry was also on the property. It had filled with water, and city dwellers swam there in summers and ice-skated in the winter. Sadly, during the winter following the city’s purchase of the park, a boy drowned in the quarry after skating over a patch of too-thin ice. The Department of Sanitation turned the former quarry into a landfill during World War I, which further diminished the desire to build a public park on the property.\n\nVenable Park never quite came to be, but Venable Stadium was built in 1921. The Army 3rd Corps and the Quantico Marines played an annual football game at the Johns Hopkins University stadium. The game was always a huge success, but the Hopkins stadium was too small to accommodate the ever-growing crowd. Mayor William F. Broening wanted to keep the game in the city, so he decreed that the city needed an official stadium. Parks and other lots across the city were surveyed to find a place to construct a bigger, better arena. Planners initially hoped to convert the Mount Royal Reservoir, but the residents of neighborhood vehemently opposed the plan. An unused reservoir in Clifton Park was then chosen as the site for the stadium by City Engineer Henry G. Perring, but Secretary of the Park Board J.V. Kelly had a better idea.\n\nKelly suggested that Venable Park should house the new stadium. He felt the landfill could be excavated and re-purposed more cheaply than one of the old reservoirs. He told The Baltimore Sun that the inspiration had struck him as he drove down 33rd Street to his office in Druid Hill Park. When he proposed the plan, some members of the Park Board were skeptical; others didn’t even know the location of the park. Kelly “found a map…and pointed out the park location, and enthusiastically explained that a stadium located there could be more conveniently reached from all sections of the city….”(1) His suggestion beat out the other contenders.\n\nThe stadium was built in an impressive seven months. The trash was cleared away and a horseshoe shape was dug into the ground. The stadium had earthen walls, the seats were wooden planks, and it cost a mere $458,000 to build. The entrance was the grandest feature of the area, comprised of 24 Greek-looking arches and columns. The end result was rather primitive by today’s standards, but it could hold the anticipated crowd. The administration and clubhouse building remained incomplete on game day, but it was (mostly) ready to host the Army-Marine game on December 2, 1922.\n\nVenable Stadium opened with enormous fanfare and attracted a high-profile audience. The Baltimore Municipal Journal reported, “It was really very much more than a football game that took place on December 2, 1922. It was a tremendous step forward for the city of Baltimore. At no other football game could so many cabinet officers and so many high United States officials be found. Twelve hundred distinguished visitors from official Washington and the Army-Marine and Navy fliers were guests of the city.”(2) A special phone was even installed to keep President Warren Harding and the first lady, Florence, abreast of the game’s events. The game was also broadcast to Army and Marine bases across the country, which was unheard of in its day.\n\nA huge parade kicked off opening day. The procession weaved through the city to the new stadium. Soldiers from all over the Mid-Atlantic marched alongside the Baltimore Police and city officials. Airplanes flown by the Maryland National Guard and the 50th Squadron from Langley Field whizzed overhead to announce the arrival of the cavalcade. Almost 70,000 people flocked to town to watch the game: 44,000 spectators crammed into the stands, 10,000 stood around the playing field, and about 15,000 watched from outside of the stadium, some climbing trees and sitting atop roofs to catch a glimpse of the action.\n\nThe contest lived up to expectations. The Marines eked out a win over the Army squad by score of 13 to 12. Sun correspondent, Raymond Tompkins, proclaimed that after the game, the stadium could no longer be considered new, because “It has lived and suffered, if a giant of concrete and earth can do that. It knows the blackest depths of despair and the most golden heights of triumph, ending with a struggle that could have rocked a mountain.”(3) The grand opening went off without a hitch. The Journal even praised the city for its efficiency in traffic control after the game—the stadium “was emptied of this vast throng in twenty minutes and the United Railways had carried the crowd away in thirty minutes. Still more remarkable was the success of the special traffic arrangements for the automobiles. For there was not a single accident.” (4)\n\nThe second game played at Venable Stadium was not nearly as successful, but perhaps more historically important. The week after the Marine-Army game on December 9th, the Oorang Indians played the Baltimore Professionals. The Oorang Indians, hailing from LaRue, Ohio, only lasted one season in the National Football League, but legendary multi-sport athlete and Olympian Jim Thorpe played for and coached the team. While the team was formed by Walter Lingo as a publicity stunt to sell Airedale terriers, it was the only professional football team comprised of all Native American players. The players also performed traditional Native American dances and sports alongside plucky terriers at half-time rather than returning to the locker room. The Indians’ big star Thorpe would not take the field in Baltimore. He was still recovering from injuries sustained in a previous match and not even the thrill of the newly invented half-time show could muster Baltimoreans. The Baltimore Professionals won the match. The game drew a crowd of less than 5,000.\n\nThe stadium primarily hosted military football games in its first few years. The Naval Academy football team frequently played rivals, such as Notre Dame and Army, at the stadium, which always drew large crowds, thus requiring more seats. At one point, Venable Stadium was expanded to hold 80,000 spectators on its wooden benches. In 1924, Baltimore hosted the Army-Navy game for the first time. The game was as hotly anticipated as the Army-Marine game two years prior. Notables once again flocked to Baltimore, including President Calvin Coolidge and the First Lady. The Midshipmen were shut out, but the Academy agreed to play one game a season in the city’s stadium. Navy brought their biggest opponents to Baltimore. Most notably, they played the Notre Dame Fighting Irish at the stadium every two years. Before every game, the Midshipmen paraded through the city to the stadium. It became such an event that a special platform was built at Clifton Park to accommodate the crowds of cadets.\n\nDespite the Midshipmen’s residency at Venable Stadium, it hemorrhaged money. The Park Board could not consistently fill the stadium without a permanent professional team. Local high schools played in the giant arena, and various professional football teams only used the stadium on occasion. Renovations and repair costs outstripped revenue. This deficit also stalled the installation of concrete seats, which would replace the wooden benches which rotted and splintered from weather exposure. The Great Depression also led to a drop-off in attendance and therefore revenue.\n\nThe stadium languished for years until 1944 when tragedy struck Baltimore’s other major sports arena, Oriole Park. During the summer of that year, the baseball stadium burned to the ground during the night after an Oriole-Syracuse Chiefs game. Because the Orioles needed a place to play out their season, they moved into Venable, or as it was now called, Municipal Stadium. This heralded a new era prosperity for the stadium, and also a new professional football team, the Baltimore Colts.

In fact it isn’t even a singular story. Simply preparing this piece about the collection unearthed a tale that highlights shaky provenance, the concept of authenticity in an archive, and the importance of institutional knowledge.\n\nIn 1839, a scientist and “student of Maryland history” named John Henry Alexander noticed two large trunks labeled “CALVERT PAPERS” while visiting the British Museum in London. Intrigued, he tucked the information away in the back of his mind. Thirteen years later Alexander returned to the museum in the hopes of examining the contents of the trunks, but was dismayed to find that the no one on the current staff had any recollection of the trunks or the documents. It would be another three decades before the mystery was solved.\n\nIn 1887, five years after the Maryland General Assembly passed “An act to provide for the preservation, arrangement, publication, and sale of Ancient Documents pertaining to Maryland,” MdHS finally traced the location of the long disappeared Calvert Papers to the estate of Colonel Frederick Henry Harford, a distant descendant of Henry Harford, the “illegitimate heir of the last Lord Baltimore.”\n\nAn initial investigation determined that the papers had been stored for an indeterminate time in a chest in Harford’s greenhouse, in no apparent order, mixed with other family papers. They were also in very poor condition, with “some signs of damp . . . on a few of the papers, so that, if the chest should remain for some years longer in it’s present place, the papers may be seriously injured.” Even more distressing, Colonel Harford, obviously not a scholar, had directed his gardeners to use a large portion of the papers to fill a divot on the grounds of his property.\n\nActing swiftly under the leadership of Mendes Cohen, the society raised money from prominent Baltimoreans including Enoch Pratt, Charles Bonaparte, and Albert Ritchie, and sent a representative to England for the purposes of acquiring the papers. In April of 1888, MdHS Librarian John Wesley Murray Lee arrived in England and negotiated the purchase of the 1,300 plus documents for approximately $1,100 (about $27,000 in 2014). After carefully packing the papers in iron trunks, Lee escorted the historic acquisition to Baltimore aboard the steamship Servia, and the manuscripts were soon safely stored in the society’s fireproof vault.\n\nThe Calvert Papers contain many of the Maryland’s oldest and most historically important documents. The manuscripts, “on paper and parchment . . . ranging from the reigns of Henry VIII and Elizabeth,” down to the second half of the eighteenth century, are a varied assortment of materials including Council books, journals of the Colonial Houses of Assembly, rent rolls, grants of land, heraldic and genealogical parchments and scrolls, and hundreds of pieces of correspondence of the Lords Baltimore, governors, and private citizens.\n\nOne of the most important documents in the collection related specifically to Maryland is Cecilius Calvert’s instructions to the colonists setting off for the Americas aboard the Ark and the Dove. Dated November 13, 1633, the letter from the Second Lord Baltimore to his brother Leonard, the first governor of the colony, lays the foundation for Maryland’s laws. Perhaps it’s most important feature is the statement on religious toleration in the opening clause:\n\n“His Lo requires his said Governor & Commissioners th in their voyage to Mary Land they be very careful to preserve unity & peace amongst all the passengers on Shipp-board, and that they suffer no scandall nor offence to be given to any of the Protestants, whereby any just complaint may hereafter be made, by them, in Virginea or in England, and that for that end, they cause all Acts of Romane Catholique Religion to be done as privately as may be, and that they instruct all the Romane Catholiques to be silent upon all occasions of discourse concerning matters of Religion; and that the said Governor & Commissioners treate the Protestants wth as much mildness and favor as Justice will permitt. And this to be observed at Land as well as at Sea.”\n\nThe papers also contain “a great mass of documents illustrating every phase of the Maryland-Pennsylvania boundary dispute between the Calvert and the Penn families.” Among these are two copies of surveyors Charles Mason and Jeremiah Dixon’s map of the famous boundary line that today bears their names. In 1763, the Calvert and Penn families commissioned the two Englishmen to determine the border between the two colonies, and settle the argument over 4,000 square miles of contested land. After five years of slow, painstaking work through rigorous frontier, the survey was completed, the dispute settled, and Dixon drew an exquisite map of the line. The surveyors printed two hundred copies of the large 76” x 27” map in early 1768. The pair of copies discovered in Colonel Harford’s greenhouse more than a century later are two of only nine extant copies known today.\n\nOne of the most notable items in the Calvert papers didn’t come from a greenhouse trunk in England, but the equally unlikely location of Lincoln, Nebraska. In 1894, Mendes Cohen, Chair of the Library Committee, received a letter from a man named John Roland Phillips, who upon his father’s death inherited an accumulation of documents collected by his father relating to the Calvert Family. In this batch of documents, added to the original Calvert Papers and given manuscript number MS 174.1, was a copy of an amazing manuscript entitled “A Briefe[sic] Relation of the Voyage Unto Maryland” written by Father Andrew White, one of the Jesuit priests who accompanied the Maryland colonists aboard the Ark and the Dove. Written in English this narrative describes the entire voyage of the first settlers.\n\nWhite produced two versions of this manuscript, one in English and another in Latin entitled Relatio Itineris in Marilandium. The two versions were composed with different audiences in mind, and vary in certain aspects. The Latin version was intended for his superiors in Rome, whereas the English, with descriptions of the Maryland climate, soil, and “products of the earth,” was written in the hopes of drawing investors to the new colony.\n\nIt is entirely possible that the copy in the papers acquired from Phillips was written in Father White’s actual hand. Evidence of this possibility exists in another manuscript bundled in this batch of documents; a dictated and signed letter from Leonard Calvert, that refers to this English copy as having been written by “a most honest and discreet gentleman, wherefore you may be confident of the truth of it.” The body of the letter contains very similar handwriting to that in the Brief Relation. They appear to have been written by the same scribe, so there is a good chance Father White penned both.\n\nFather White’s original Latin text returned with the Ark to London in the summer of 1634. Once it arrived a copy was made which was then sent to the Jesuit archives in Rome. Shortly thereafter the original manuscript went missing and remained unaccounted for until 1998. The MdHS purchased what is presumed to be this missing copy in auction from Sotheby’s, bringing the English and Latin version together again 364 years after they were created.\n\nAlthough there is a good chance that MdHS has three original documents written by Father Andrew White (the two Relatios and the dictated Leonard Calvert letter) it should be acknowledged that there is a chance that we have none at all. Evidently there were at least two other possible scribes aboard the ship. We make no claims to be handwriting experts, but these documents do seem to share remarkably similar penmanship. It is likely that the scribe is the same in all of the manuscripts.\n\nAfter doing a little research we found that GeorgetownUniversity has a document entitled “Prayers written in English, Latin, and Piscatawayas which has been authenticated as being in Father White’s hand.” We welcome handwriting experts out there to do your own research and let us know what you think.\n\nIn a final postscript to the story behind the acquisition of the Calvert Papers, the society sponsored another excursion to England in July of 1889 in a last ditch attempt to recover the missing portion of the Calvert papers buried in Colonel Harford’s yard. Meeting with the Colonel Harford, MdHS member Julian LeRoy White discovered that Harford had originally directed his butler to burn the documents, but he had buried them instead. With the aid of two of Harford’s workmen and the butler, White began the excavation:\n\n“We dug all that day through all that part of the heap which might possibly, according to the butler, contain the Papers . . . We went down to water almost, and found nothing except some enormous worms . . . almost the size of small eels . . . If there were papers there the damp could not have failed to destroy them.”\n\nMarylanders may lament the loss of a portion of the Calvert papers to the worms, but it should be noted that much care has been put into the stewardship of the extant collection in the 127 years since their arrival. The papers have been arranged, described, conserved, and then microfilmed in 1972. Though much work has been done with this collection our query into the provenance of the Father White letter reminded us how much work can still be done. Take some comfort in the fact that the continued metaphoric excavation of the remaining documents will prove to be fruitful.

The first part was posted on December 11, 2014.)\n\nOriole Park’s fiery end in 1944 provided a much needed revenue source for Baltimore’s Venable Stadium. The project had become an expensive city-wide joke. The stadium had become known as the city’s “White Elephant.” Venable failed to ever generate a profit, despite the efforts of many Park Board members over the years. Sensing an opportunity to solve two problems, Mayor Theodore McKeldin offered the stadium to the homeless Baltimore Orioles, then part of the International League of Professional Baseball Teams.\n\nThe minor league baseball team made Venable, or as it had come to be known, Municipal or Baltimore Stadium, its home, and the stands were regularly filled once again. The Venable name had fallen out of favor as Baltimoreans forgot its namesake, Richard M. Venable. Venable had helped establish the city’s park system and was a former president of the Park Board, but city residents and newspapers more often called the 33rd Street stadium Baltimore or Municipal Stadium. To prepare for the incoming Orioles who had lost their park midseason, the stadium underwent a hurried transformation from a football to a baseball stadium, so the team could finish league play. The diamond was awkwardly configured on the existing field. The results were far from ideal, but it could hold far more spectators than Oriole Park ever could. Huge crowds flocked to watch the Orioles play at Municipal Stadium, and this success extended the Orioles’ residence at the stadium.\n\nThe following year, the team played all of its home games there. The city seized the opportunity to keep the team in the stadium in 1947 and decided it was time to upgrade Municipal. The newly returned crowds highlighted the failing condition of the arena. Necessary repairs and improvements had been delayed because of the lack of funding. The stadium had no official box office or ticket booths. Bathrooms were little more than wooden outhouses outside of the stadium. The backless wooden bench seating also garnered Municipal another unflattering nickname: “Splinter Heaven.” A long-term deal with the Orioles baseball team meant that a bigger, better stadium could be built on 33rd Street.\n\nThis however drew protest from the surrounding neighborhood. The residents had put up with the annoyances of living near the stadium when they thought the arrangement was temporary. They were fed up with the rowdy sports fans, overwhelming traffic that kicked up dust from the unpaved parking lots, and the bright lights and loud noise that radiated from the stadium during night games. The Stadium Neighborhood Protection Committee filed suit against the city. The association wanted concessions from the city and the team for the inconveniences the stadium caused.\n\nBoth sides hired Baltimore’s premiere legal eagles. Wilmer H. Driver represented the Stadium Neighborhood Protection Committee, and the City Solicitor, Thomas Biddison, worked the case for Baltimore. The Baltimore Orioles also hired as slew of lawyers to fight the neighborhood association. The case made it up to Maryland’s highest court, the Court of Appeals. In the end, the city and the Orioles won the case. The only concessions made to the residents were that innings could not be started after 11:30 p.m., the parking lots must be paved, and the PA system couldn’t be too loud. The court case also affirmed that the stadium could legally be used for professional sports, which opened the door to bigger opportunities.\n\nThe planning for the new stadium coincided with the return of professional football to the city. Bob Rodenberg acquired and moved the defunct Miami Seahawks from the All-America Football Conference to Baltimore in 1947. This hardly seemed like a gamble. He knew that the city loved football. The Washington Redskins had periodically played in Municipal and had always drawn good crowds. The Seahawks were renamed the Colts as result of a naming contest won by Charles Evans of Middle River, Maryland. Rodenberg initially wanted to call his team the Whirlaways after the Triple Crown winning racehorse, Whirlaway. The Colts moniker honored the city’s connection to horseracing. This team only lasted until 1951. The AAFC and the National Football merged in 1950, and the Colts were included, but poor play combined with financial instability led the league to dissolve the team. Baltimore was once again without a professional football team, until 1952, when the league commissioner challenged the team to sell 15,000 tickets in six weeks to reenter the league. The challenge was met in less than five weeks. The Baltimore Colts were reinstated in 1953. Carroll Rosenbloom moved the floundering Dallas Texans to the city with the trademark blue and white uniforms, thus creating the team that the city rooted for until 1984.\n\nThe new stadium also helped cement a deal to get a major league baseball team back in Baltimore. The St. Louis Browns from the American League moved to the city in 1954. The International League team was bought out and moved to Havana, Cuba, and the Browns took over the Orioles name.\n\nMemorial Stadium was a far cry from Municipal. Construction on the new stadium was completed in 1950 and cost $6.5 million to build. It was built from reinforced concrete, had actual seats, and an imposing entrance. The firms of J. L. Faisant and L. P. Kooken were responsible for the design. The name Memorial Stadium was chosen to honor Marylanders who had served in the military, and was even more fitting with the recent end of World War II and the start of the Korean War during the construction period. Some had advocated naming the stadium after Baltimore’s native son, Babe Ruth, but this was met with criticism and ultimately rejected. A second deck of seating was added in 1954, just in time for major league Orioles’ Opening Day.\n\nBoth the Orioles and Colts met great success in their new stadium. Over one million fans attended the O’s games during their inaugural season despite the team’s 54-100 record. The baseball team won six American League pennants and three World Series championships during its tenure in Memorial. Many baseball greats graced the diamond for the O’s, including Brooks Robinson, Cal Ripken, Jr., Frank Robinson, and Boog Powell.\n\nThe Baltimore Colts also regularly sold out games. The raucous passion of the fans garnered Memorial the nickname of “The World’s Largest Outdoor Insane Asylum” by the Chicago Tribune writer, Cooper Rollow. Baltimore Sun columnist Jacques Kelly concurred with Rollow’s characterization of Colts fans, writing that “tickets were scarcer than Inner Harbor parking places, the old stadium reverberated with great touchdown huzzas. You didn’t need to turn on a radio back then; a going-crazy, packed-to-the goalpost crowd broadcast enthusiasm over a 12-block radius.”(1) Baltimoreans loved to cheer on the Colts greats, “the Golden Arm” Johnny Unitas, Art Donovan, and Lenny Moore, just to name a few. The Colts won back-to-back National Football Championships in 1958 and 1959, and made it to the Super Bowl twice, losing to the New York Jets in 1968, and winning in 1970 versus the Dallas Cowboys.\n\nThe 33rd Street stadium had returned to greatness. The city continued to update the structure, adding more seats and luxury amenities for the next two decades. Trouble began to brew again when the Colts were purchased by Robert Irsay of Chicago. The Colts owner, Rosenbloom, got the Los Angeles Rams in the deal. Irsay did not plan to keep the Colts in Baltimore and drew the ire of the loyal fans by openly shopping the team to other cities. He brokered a deal with the city of Indianapolis, and the team shipped out during the night on March 29, 1984. Baltimore would remain without a football team until 1996.\n\nBy that point, the stadium needed to be overhauled once again. The city was divided on whether to upgrade Memorial or build a whole new facility for the Orioles. In the end, the plan for a new stadium won out and Camden Yards at Oriole Park was built specifically to accommodate baseball. The O’s played their last game at Memorial Stadium in 1991. The city attempted to lease out the arena for other events, such as rock concerts, but the neighborhood vigorously protested this measure. A Canadian Football League team, the Baltimore Stallions, temporarily called Memorial home, but support for the team fizzled when Art Modell announced that he wanted to bring the Cleveland Browns to the city. The Ravens played two seasons at Memorial, but eventually the team built its own stadium, PSI Net, or as it is now known, M & T Bank Stadium.\n\nMemorial Stadium was demolished in 2001, despite protests from Baltimoreans who remembered the glory days. The landscape of 33rd Street is vastly different. Apartments surround the where the stadium once stood. But, the property’s sport history legacy has not been totally forgotten, a YMCA was built on the stadium grounds, and in 2010, the Cal Ripken Sr. Foundation in conjunction with the YMCA of Central Maryland built baseball field on the location of the old stadium. Home plate sits on its old, familiar spot on 33rd Street once again.

The Lord Baltimore Fellowship promotes scholarship in Maryland history and culture through research in the MdHS library collections.

Much of the time has been spent reading diaries filled with faded handwriting, correspondence both illegible and legible, meticulously-organized scrapbooks, and notes of previous historians. I scrolled through months of newspaper articles on microfilm – reading each ad, article and page – hoping to find little details that other historians may not have used or found significant. Some days came and went with no clues or leads, and on other days I found many sources that would help me tell a new story…\n\nI am researching the “Christiana Riot of 1851″ which occurred in the small town of the same name in Pennsylvania. Edward Gorsuch, a Baltimore County citizen, was killed by fugitive slaves refusing to return to a life in bondage.(1) This topic has been explored before. For the past forty years, historians have studied the event in terms of race relations and racial violence in Pennsylvania. Prior to that, historians wrote about the effects of the riot in terms of its national significance or as a general study of the local history of Pennsylvania. But no one has focused on how Marylanders reacted to the Christiana Resistance, the lack of enforcement of the Fugitive Slave Law or to the murder of a Baltimore County citizen. This is what I found interesting. What did Marylanders think about it? My research focuses on the aftermath of the incident in Maryland – a slave state inhabited with the largest number of free African-Americans in the country – a very interesting dynamic.\n\nThe story began on an idyllic farm in northern Baltimore County in 1849. Four slaves – Noah Buley, Nelson Ford, and Joshua and George Hammond – escaped from Edward Gorsuch’s farm and found refuge, freedom, and work in Christiana, Pennsylvania. For two years, Gorsuch used every possible legal method to find and bring home his “property,” including petitioning Maryland Governor Philip Francis Thomas, but he was unsuccessful. When the controversial Fugitive Slave Law passed in 1850, Gorsuch had suddenly another means to recapture the fugitive slaves. He was now legally allowed by the federal government to enter a free state to recapture the men. In August 1851, William Padgett, Gorsuch’s informant, told him where the fugitives were living.\n\nOn September 11, 1851, a posse quietly approached a small stone house in Christiana. They were armed with weapons, warrants, and a U.S. Marshall. William Parker, another Maryland fugitive who rented the home, refused to let the fugitive slaves surrender. The commotion in the early morning hours attracted neighbors – some came to offer assistance; others to prevent a possible illegal slave kidnapping. The short and brutal fight left Edward Gorsuch dead, his son Dickinson severely wounded, and all other slaveholders running for their lives. William Parker and the fugitives from Baltimore County escaped. This incident eventually led to the largest treason trial in U.S. history (Thirty-eight people were charged with treason which ended in an acquittal or charges were dropped). No one was ever convicted of the murder of Edward Gorsuch.\n\nOn September 15, 6,000 people gathered in Monument Square in Baltimore to express outrage at the events in Christiana. Town meetings were also held in Baltimore County, both in Monkton and in Towsontown. The men who attended these meetings were some of the most powerful men in the state and included present and future politicians. What did they have to say? Did they differentiate their opinions between the issue of the murder and the concern over enforcement of the new federal law? My research will include the thoughts and opinions of men, women, former slaves, free African-Americans, slaveholders, and abolitionists.\n\nGovernor E. Louis Lowe, the presiding governor of Maryland from 1851 to 1854, spoke about Christiana in his Annual Message to the Maryland General Assembly on January 7, 1852. He called the trial a “farce” and a “mockery.”\n\nFrederick Douglass met William Parker (the leader of the resistance) while both men were enslaved in Maryland. Parker, along with two other resisters, left Pennsylvania and stopped at Frederick Douglass’ Rochester, New York home on the way to Canada. One of the many times he wrote about this event in depth was in his last autobiography:\n\n“I could not look upon them as murderers. To me they were heroic defenders of the just rights of man against manstealers and murderers. So I fed them, and sheltered them in my house…I shook hands with my friends, received from Parker the revolver that fell from the hand of Gorsuch when he died, presented now as a token of gratitude and a memento of the battle for Liberty at Christiana…”\n\nIn 1849, John Wilkes Booth (yes, the man who assassinated Abraham Lincoln) was friends and classmates with Tom, Edward Gorsuch’s youngest son, at the Milton Academy in Baltimore County.(2) Although most of Booth’s correspondence was destroyed after Lincoln’s assassination, some surviving papers were published for the first time in 1997. Among them was a rough draft of a speech written in December 1860. He wrote,\n\n“…Gentlemen, when I was a schoolboy, my bossom friend was a boy 3 years my senior named Gorruge [Thomas Gorsuch], he was as noble a youth as any living. He had two brothers grown to be men. And and an old father who loved and was beloved by them. He was all that a man of honour should be. Two of his negros committed a robbery, they were informed upon. They nearly beat the informer to death. they ran away from Maryland, came to this state [Pennsylvania]. The father, the two sons, and the boy my playmate, came to this state under the protection of the fugitive slave law (not only to recover their property, but to arrest the thieves who belonged to them).“\n\nIn 1911, the citizens of Lancaster County wanted to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the event in the spirit of reconciliation. Family and friends of those who participated on both sides of the event were invited, as well as political and community leaders. W. U. Hensel, a local attorney and historian, coordinated the event and kept a scrapbook of correspondence and newspaper articles. I found some very interesting letters including many from Dickinson Gorsuch’s daughter, Rebecca (Edward’s granddaughter). In many of her letters she expressed gratitude and pleasure for the commemoration of the event.\n\n“…I cannot express to you all this visit meant to me, the hospitality + goodwill extended by from (cross out from) all whom we met…Mr. Hensel, you gave such pleasure as will never be forgotten. (plus sign) then to crown all that beautiful medal that will be one of my cherished possessions…”\n\nI found it difficult to understand her gratitude at the commemoration of an event that killed her grandfather and almost killed her father. I thought perhaps it was a sign of southern hospitality, but it appears to be genuine as Rebecca Gorsuch Mitchell had a lot of correspondence with Hensel in the same glowing terms – offering family diaries and letters for his research and invitations to visit her.\n\nJohn Crowther, who knew the Gorsuch family, expressed disgust at the thought of commemoration festivities.\n\n“…I know if they were living it would be very distasteful to them to have the memory of that disgraceful occurrence perpetuated. They were all staunch Union men, and law-abiding citizens, none in the county stood higher…”\n\nThese are just a few comments made by Marylanders regarding the Christiana Resistance and/or the murder of Edward Gorsuch. My research continues, not only at MdHS, but also the Maryland State Archives, the National Archives, the Historical Society of Pennsylvania, the Library of Congress and other institutions.\n\nHistory’s Mysteries\n\nAs with any research project, some questions are answered, some questions lead to more questions, and some questions lead to dead ends. My present ‘dead end’ are a series of missing pages from an 1851 diary of Dickinson Gorsuch. MdHS has many of Dickinson Gorsuch’s diaries in the Gorsuch-Mitchell Collection of Papers, MS 2733, but pages are torn out of this particular diary.\n\nThe diary entries end on August 17, 1851, the day before the posse left Baltimore County for Pennnsylvania. After that a number of pages are ripped out and the rest of the book is blank. The diary, Dickinson Gorsuch’s travel diary, is written in a very different style compared to the other ones in the Gorsuch-Mitchell Collection of Papers at MdHS (MS 2733). MdHS has many of his diaries, but not from the critical years of 1851 and 1852.\n\nMoores Memorial Library in Christiana holds photocopies of Dickinson Gorsuch’s 1851 diary which is in a different format, but same handwriting and style. The Library does not know the provenance of these photocopies. I do not doubt that these are his – MdHS has fifteen diaries of his in the Gorsuch Mitchell Collection – it’s the same handwriting and style. The MML copies are very much like the MdHS ones – farm account books with daily entries noting the day-to-day business of running a farm with added personal notes. Where is the original? Rebecca Gorsuch Mitchell, Dickinson’s daughter and Edward’s granddaughter, mentions the diaries to W. U. Hensel in their correspondence about the 60th anniversary. She gave them to him fo research, but did he return them? They are not in his collection.\n\nFinally, I am extremely grateful to the Library staff – Damon, Lara, Eben, and Dr. Pat Anderson for their support as well as the opportunity to research as a Lord Baltimore Fellow.
