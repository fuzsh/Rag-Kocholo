        "text": "In 1861, four years before the Emancipation Proclamation St. James A.U.M.P. Church was born. A group of devoted Christian men and women of Towson, Maryland who believed in fulfilling the need for kingdom building began to meet from house to house to lift up the name of Jesus Christ. The meetings were held in the home of the late James Garrett, later the home of Frank and Ida Scovens and Marie Pratt supplied oil for the lamps. God continued to bless these men with knowledge, wisdom and understanding.\n\nOn October 17, 1881, the late Benjamin Johnson, Sam Preston, Alexander Frazier, Alexander Williams, and James Garrett purchased land from Henry L. Bowens. A one level structure was built on this land. The property was recorded in the Land Records of Baltimore County and the State of Maryland. The men, still being guided by God, were influenced to make the ultimate decision to form a legal and bona fide organization.\n\nThis group of faithful African American men joined the A.U.F.C.M.P.C. connection and became the first trustees of the St. James AU.F.C.M.P. Church. It was later referred to as St. James A.U.MP. Church of Towson. James 2:26 “For as the body without the spirit is dead Faith without Works is dead also” characterizes their obedience and faithfulness to the guiding of the Holy Spirit.\n\nThe first Pastor, the late Rev. J. A. Manly, was sent to St. James’ Church in Towson, Maryland. In 1906 under the Pastorate of the late Rev. J.H. Medley, an upper level was added to the church structure. It is the present-day structure; the cornerstone was also laid at that time. St. James is the oldest historic African American Church serving the Towson Community.\n\nNext to the church building sits a 173-year-old church bell—a gift from another church originally located in the Govans community in Baltimore City. For the members of St. James, the bell is an iconic symbol of the church’s long history of God’s light, love and Word being seen, felt, and heard from the steadfast sacred breath of this humble place. Every Sunday morning, when the church bell rings twelve times, it is a salute to the twelve tribes of Israel, the twelve Apostles and all those who serve in the name of Jesus Christ.\n\nApproximately, Twenty-four Pastors have preached, reached, and obeyed the great commission of the Lord Jesus Christ. However, it is believed Rev. Joseph McManus presided over the church the longest from 1961 to 1983. Presently, Pastor Osborne Robinson, Jr. guides the flock with the mission to Love, Lead, and Feed God’s People to the Glory of God. Its doors have always remained opened as a testimony to God’s uncompromising faithfulness towards his people. Since its beginning, St. James has been a steadfast beacon to The Towson Community, living out its Christian commitment to Jesus Christ, community, and family."
