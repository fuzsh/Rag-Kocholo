JAMES EPISCOPAL CHURCH, BALTIMORE, MARYLAND Dear family in Christ, I was deeply moved to receive word of your 200th Jubilee Anniversary celebration this year. Please be assured of my prayers for you as you continue to spread God’s message of hope and love in the world. I thank God for you all! In the first century, Jesus of Nazareth began a movement. It was a movement whose goal was to change the world into something closer to God’s dream and desire for it, what the Bible often calls the “Reign” or the “Kingdom of God.” It was a movement of people who committed their very lives to following the teachings, the way, and the Spirit of Jesus, living and loving the way Jesus did and does, giving and forgiving, serving and sacrificing for the good of others and the wellbeing of the world, just like Jesus. I remember with great fondness our years in service to our Lord together. And I remember well the way we worshipped God together, the ways we sought to follow Jesus in service to children of our community, the work to rebuild after the fire, the building of a parish community center, Bible studies, and on and on and on. As I move toward retirement later this year I look back in wonder, as Mahalia Jackson use to sing, on the witness of the people of St. James’. For 200 years, St. James has truly worked to serve the community - through your commitments to proclaiming the Good News of God in Christ through worship, through your wonderful outreach programs, music ministry, and commitment to loving your neighbors. In these and so much more, St. James has continued the movement that Jesus began long ago, creating a fitting legacy to build upon for the next 200 years. For all of this, I thank Almighty God and pray God’s most abundant blessings on St. James for your growth and your joy! May God bless you all as you continue to bless the world. I remain Your brother in Christ, The Most Reverend Michael B. Curry Presiding Bishop and Primate The Episcopal Church\n\nT H E H I S T O R I C S T.

The St. James Episcopal Church has stood as a beacon of light for the Harlem Park community since it moved to its current home in 1932 at the corner of Lafayette and Arlington. From your humble beginnings in 1824, when a young man crossed into Maryland, a slave state, to establish a church for free and enslaved Black people, you have provided a house of worship for those seeking God’s presence. Your work in the community is evidenced by your long-time food pantry and support of the Angel Tree Project, now in partnership with the Druid Hill Y. For over 35 years you have provided programs that provide a haven and nurturing environment for children from your neighborhood schools: William Pinderhughes Elementary School and now Harlem Park Elementary/Middle School’s after school program via your nonprofit, The James Academy.

J A M E S ’ E P I S C O P A L C H U R C H 200 T H ANNIVERSARY 11 Jubilee THE HISTORIC ST. JAMES EPISCOPAL CHURCH – OUR STORY IN A NUTSHELL In March 1824, The Reverend William Levington, ordained Episcopal Deacon and a 31-yearold free black, moved to Baltimore from Philadelphia, where he served as Deacon under Absalom Jones. In 1824 Baltimore, blacks were required to pay taxes and were banned from attending public schools. By law, any free black who journeyed to Maryland and stayed more than 10 days without permission, was classified a nonresident, fined $50.00 a week and encouraged to return to Africa. It was within this historical context that Deacon Levington moved to Baltimore to establish an Episcopal church, Sunday school and day school for enslaved and free blacks. By June 1824, Levington had established a church and school for free and enslaved blacks in a small upper room in Baltimore City on Marion Street and Park Avenue. James Bosley, Esq., a white parishioner at “Old” St. Paul’s Episcopal Church (one of two Episcopal churches in Baltimore at the time) donated land and money to enable Levington’s vision. In 1827, a newly constructed St. James First African Protestant Episcopal Church, was consecrated. It was the first Episcopal Church for people of color below the “Mason-Dixon Line” and the 3rd in the U.S. Reverend Levington, by then an ordained Priest, died twelve years after moving to Baltimore. The school, established by Levington, continued to operate until 1867. Levington’s history was researched and documented by St. James’ member Phyllis L. Chandler (deceased) in her book Heritage of Hope & Sacrifice – The Remarkable Journeys of Rev. William Levington, 2002. The 3rd priest, succeeding Levington, was Reverend J. N. McJilton, a white man. In 1866, McJilton became the 1st Superintendent of Schools in Baltimore City. As Baltimore City’s School Superintendent, McJilton established two public schools for children of color. As a result of his decision to establish those two public schools, in 1868, McJilton was fired as Superintendent. Other outstanding priests at St. James, included The Reverend George Freeman Bragg, an ex-slave, who was Rector for 49 years, from 1891 – 1940. Dr. Lawrence Jackson, a current St. James member, is an author, a Professor of English at Johns Hopkins University, and the director of the Billie Holiday Center for Liberation Arts at Johns Hopkins. In a recently published book, Jackson observed that Bragg belonged to the “heroic generation” of George Washington Carver and Booker T. Washington…, who basically believed that having survived life as chattel, anything was possible. Shelter-A Black Tale of Homeland Baltimore, Lawrence Jackson, Graywolf Press, 2022. In 1899, Bragg established an orphanage facility “Maryland Home for Friendless Colored Children”. Today, “Great Kids Farm”, formerly known as “Bragg School”, is a Baltimore City Public Schools learning center, and it a direct outgrowth of Bragg’s initiative. Among Bragg’s local disciples and church members were: Clarence Mitchell, Jr., Carl Murphy, E. Franklin Frazier and Justice Thurgood Marshall. During his ministry in Baltimore, Bragg was a political activist, community activist and author of several remarkable books. It was Bragg’s weekly news publication The Ledger, that merged with John Murphy, Senior’s, publication to create the Afro-American Newspapers.\n\nT H E H I S T O R I C S T. J A M E S ’ E P I S C O P A L C H U R C H 200 T H ANNIVERSARY 12 Jubilee The Right Reverend Cedric E. Mills, followed Bragg and was St. James’ Rector from 1940 to 1963. Mills’ ministry included initiatives emphasizing education, recreation and housing. Under his leadership, the Lafayette Square Community Center was established and offered daily educational and recreational activities. Mills served on the Boards of the Urban League, NAACP and Provident Hospital. Mills’ initiated the acquisition of property that resulted in the construction of the St. James Terrace Apartments, an apartment residence with 151 units for seniors that continues. Mills was the second Bishop of color in the Episcopal Church USA, and in 1963 Mills became the Episcopal Bishop of the U.S. Virgin Islands. A second U.S. Episcopal Bishop, and a “son” of St. James was the Right Reverend Orris George “Jay” Walker, who was Bishop of Long Island, NY from 1991 to 2009. Walker was a Baltimore native. Ordained a priest in 1969, Walker taught in seminaries and served many parishes before his consecration as Bishop. The Right Reverend Carl Wright, also a “son” of St. James was ordained a Bishop in 2017, retiring in 2022.Wright was Episcopal Bishop of the Armed Forces and Federal Ministries. The Right Reverend Vashti Murphy McKenzie, who attended St. James where she was baptized, confirmed and wed, was in 2000 consecrated as the 1st female African Methodist Episcopal Bishop. Today, the Most Reverend Michael Bruce Curry, a St. James Rector for twelve years, is the Presiding Bishop and Primate of the Episcopal Church, USA. More than 44 “sons” and “daughters” of St. James have become Deacons, Priests, Canons and ministers in the Episcopal Church, USA, and other protestant denominations. When racial segregation was legal, some left Maryland to form Episcopal congregations for people of color in Connecticut, Rhode Island, Missouri, and Illinois. Other “sons” and “daughters” have become professors in divinity schools, prolific biblical scholars, and authors, as well as school and college chaplains. One such person, Rev. Dr. Anna Pauline “Pauli” Murray, was baptized in St. James and moved to NYC as an adolescent. Reverend Murray, also a lawyer, was ahead of her time with respect to issues on racism and sexism. While a law student at Howard University School of Law, her legal research and writings became the basis for some of the legal arguments in the case of Brown vs Board of Education. In 1977, Reverend Murray became the first “female-bodied” person to be ordained an Episcopal priest. She is recognized as a permanent saint of the Episcopal Church. Today, the St. James congregation, like many other urban churches of all faiths, face many challenges. In response, the congregation is engaging in the process of internal examination, long-range planning and in March held a parish-wide Leadership Summit. St. James despite the challenges the congregation continues to minister to the community through our Outreach Ministry which operates a bi-monthly food pantry and partners with the Druid Hill Y for the Angel Tree Project.

J A M E S ’ E P I S C O P A L C H U R C H 200 T H ANNIVERSARY 34 Jubilee The parish embraced the “Academy” and generously provided the funding for it to operate. Circa 1995, a bequest came to us from the estate of Eleanor Gross. Who was Eleanor Gross? She resided in the same building as Bruce and Ella Edemy, long-time members of St. James knew of the Academy and its work in Sandtown/Winchester. Ms. Gross made an awesome decision to assist in ensuring the long-term viability of the Academy with her $450,000 gift… an unexpected gift that is still at work for children. www.sjabaltimore.org St. James’ Academy seeks to assist children in reaching their potential by supporting academic and cultural enrichment through a variety of experiences that spark their intellectual curiosity and meet their social, moral and emotional needs. 34 years ago here at St. James’, our then-rector Michael Curry had a vision for a school. With the support of the vestry, he and a group of dedicated parishioners went to work, laying the groundwork for what would become St. James’ Academy. Although the vision was for a school, it began as an afterschool program. The mission was simple but vital to the well-being of our community children… to provide a haven for children after school ends with meals, homework assistance, and fun. The Academy expanded beyond the school year to operate a five-week summer enrichment program for 45 participants. During COVID, we provided funding for the Druid Hill YMCA to assist children during the day with virtual learning. As we move into the future, we will focus on expanding our impact within the 21217 community. We will support five schools (Harlem Park Elementary Middle School, New Song Academy, Furman-Templeton Preparatory Academy, SandtownWinchester Achievement Academy and Booker T Washington Middle School, in the 21217 area by raising funds to support programming at the schools. St. James’ Academy was an organization made by volunteers: from those that envisioned it, to those who organized the new group as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit, to those educators that devised how it would operate, to those that worked directly with the children.
