        "text": "Saint James School is a boarding school located near both Washington, DC and Baltimore for students in grades 8-12.\n\nFounded in 1842, Saint James is a coeducational, Episcopal school that welcomes students of all backgrounds and faiths. Located in central Maryland on a 100-acre campus surrounded by 700 acres of school-owned farm land, Saint James is five miles south of Hagerstown and 70 miles from both Washington, DC and Baltimore.\n\nSaint James is primarily a boarding school with a smaller day student program, and the school prides itself on offering a personalized approach to learning in a diverse and inclusive environment. As a result of the strong tradition of academic excellence, with competitive athletics and a full program in the arts, Saint James School challenges its students to grow academically, athletically, artistically, socially, and morally.\n\nSaint James School At-a-Glance\n\nTeaching the Virtues\n\nSaint James School takes special care to name the traits of moral and spiritual excellence and to infuse these ancient virtues into the full round of student activities. Recognizing that these good habits build lives that are noble and resilient, we teach the virtues not only in chapel but also through the residential life, athletics, the arts, and the academic curriculum. We stress, in particular, the theological virtues of faith, hope, and love; the cardinal virtues of prudence, justice, courage, and temperance; and such other crucial traits as honesty, kindness, humility, patience, generosity, loyalty, and gratitude.\n\nLifelong Success\n\nPortrait of a graduate:Miles Ahead\n\nSpread across the globe, our alumni are anchors in their communities and leaders of their professions. We recognize them by the qualities they share.\n\n'Leader for good' is embedded in my soul. I always remember that simple phrase and try to live up to that powerful mission.\n\nDave Rath '85\n\nSaint James School Diversity Statement\n\nSaint James School is an Episcopal boarding school which is committed to the academic, moral, and spiritual education of our students and to the Church’s vision of a just society. As such, we believe in fostering a diverse, inclusive, and safe community wherein all students, faculty, and staff are supported and encouraged to learn and grow in respectful relationship with each other. We are therefore also committed to having difficult conversations in which we explore our differences of experience and perspective in good faith and in the firm belief in God’s love for all of us.\n\nNon-Discriminatory Statement\n\nSaint James School does not discriminate on the basis of gender, race, color, religion, sexual orientation, physical disability, ethnic origin, or any other protected category in the administration of its educational policies, admission policies, financial aid program, athletic and other School-administrated programs, or employment practices in accordance with applicable Federal, State, and local laws."
