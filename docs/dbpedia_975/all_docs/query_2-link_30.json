        "text": "South Wraxall is a very social village and the church provides regular events and groups in support.\n\nThe full English Breakfast : Held in the winter months High Tea in Church: A popular event held through the summer.\n\nHistory\n\nThe church is on the foundation of an earlier building; the west tower is from the early 14th century. The chancel, nave, north aisle and south chapel were rebuilt in 1823 and the vestry and arcade in 1882. For further information please download our information sheet here.\n\nWould you like to donate to St James’ Church? Please do so by following this link.\n\nSt James' Church, South Wraxall\n\nSouth Wraxall, BA15 2SB\n\nSt James Church is a simple, peaceful, rural church cherished by its loyal congregation but also supported by the whole of the village community. South Wraxall with a population of 320 people is a small but very social village. The church prides itself on meeting the needs of those who love traditional services.\n\nSouth Wraxall Village Hall: When the village school closed in the 1970s the building was acquired as a hall for the village. A group of volunteers manages the hiring and cleaning of the hall a month at a time. The church uses the hall regularly for coffee after services. Toilets and car parking are provided by the hall, disabled access is possible and a ramp is available.\n\nOn the 25th and 26th May 2021, the six bells of St James’ Church were lowered for the first time since they were cast and hung in 1769. The 1.5 ton of bell were removed from their rotting bell frame, lowered through a hole in the floor of the belfry and down to the font below. Everything from the tower was removed, the bells sent away and the rotten, wooden frame replaced with a steel bell frame and fittings. Grants and very generous donations from inside and outside the village have turned the dream into a reality.\n\nIn 2019 the Salisbury DAC Advisor on bells recommended that we restore the bells as a ringing peal. In 1769 the four original bells (mentioned in an inventory of 1553) were recast and augmented to a ring of six by Abraham Bilbie. Our bells are his first ring of six and the only one outside Somerset and are therefore considered worthy of listing as rare and important.\n\n24th May 2022 will be noted as a momentous day and even an historic date in the records of St James. That evening the full circle of six bells rang out across the village from the 14th century bell tower for the first time for about 140 years. Matthew Higby, whose company of bell founders and hangers in Somerset has restored the bells, organised a trial ring. A group of ringers were brought together by a local enthusiast to ring the bells before our Platinum Jubilee service at 4pm on Sunday 5th June 2022 and they have been rung ever since.\n\nSt James' is available for Weddings, Baptisms and Funerals. Please visit this page for further details."
