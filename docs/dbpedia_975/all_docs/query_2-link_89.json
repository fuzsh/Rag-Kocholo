        "text": "School Reviews\n\n5.00 out of 5 (7 reviews)\n\n5\n\nMy daughter started Pre K at St. James Academy (SJA) in Monkton, Maryland last year and it has been an amazing experience for her and our family. Everything, from the breath-taking scenery when you first arrive on campus, to the Head of School greeting every kid by name as they walk into school, to the limitless learning opportunities each student has at SJA is incredible. Even the drive to SJA through horse farms is calming in the morning and prepares my daughter for a day full of learning. Besides all the fundamental classes you would expect at any school, I also was introduced my daughter also to Spanish and French. In Pre K She went on 4 different field trips. I was lucky enough to go to a farm and the Baltimore Science Center with her. The learning and opportunities continue to grow this year in Kindergarten. The teachers are some most dedicated and loving people I have ever met. I gladdened imagine trusting my child's wellbeing and growth to anyone else. If you asked my daughter what the best part about SJA is, she would say the playgrounds of course, but also her SJA buddy. Younger students are paired up with older students throughout the year. The older buddies help the younger students with projects and tasks, and the older students get an opportunity to work on their mentoring and leadership skills. This program has made my daughter feels like a rock star at school because older kids know her name and say hi to her in the halls and on the playground. Don't forget about what goes on after school like girls, scouts, clubs, and sports. As much as my daughter has gotten out of this school, I think I may have gotten out just as much. The support, sense of community, and friends I have already made with other parents is something that I have never experienced. If you ever have any opportunity to check out SJA, I highly recommend it. There are always events open to the public that people can attend like Halloween parties and Family events throughout the year. They always put the information on their Facebook page. I can't wait until my youngest daughter gets to start there next year.\n\n- Posted by Parent - Zach\n\n5\n\nSJA has struck the right balance of challenge, nurturing and culture for our children after transferring here 3 years ago. The balance of classwork and homework is appropriate for their grades. They work hard during the day, follow up with appropriate homework during the week and have their weekends reasonably free of additional tasks for school. At SJA, our children are taught to work together in groups learning respect and developing collaborative skills.\n\n- Posted by Parent - SJA Parent\n\n5\n\nThe most wonderful school! My 2 children attend and we couldn't be happier. Come visit and you will see all this school has to offer.\n\n- Posted by Parent - SJAparent\n\n5\n\nI am a current parent of 3 children at SJA. We have been a part of the St. James community for over 7 years. When I reflect about SJA over the years, I am overcome with emotion. We are a small school that feels like home. Warm, friendly and nurturing to start in the lower school. Is what you will find first. Once your child gets acclimated, the school will offer sports, a magnificent theater program., multi-languages. Opportunities to challenge and cultivate your child. If you want to build your child's confidence, this is where you need to be! It is safe for all types of learning. St James offers a tip if the line computer lab and technology that will spark the interest of any child. My children are better at St. James than anywhere else.\n\n- Posted by Parent - Happy parent\n\n5\n\nSt. James Academy is an excellent PK-8 school on 89 beautiful acres in Monkton, MD. SJA has provided both of my children with an exceptional education. The small class sizes, the great teachers, the quality of academics, the extremely clean facilities, and the great sports programs has exceeded our expectations. Both the lower and middle school administrations work together to promote a smooth transition from lower to middle school. I especially love how passionate the teachers are about their students. We couldn't ask for a better education for our children. Also, the parent involvement and community feel is outstanding. Such a great community! A lot of parents I'm friends with whom have moved on to high school, tell me \"you don't realize what you have until it's gone\". They don't have the wonderful community feel outside of SJA and they don't have the compassion from the teachers like they do here. It really is a wonderful place to educate your children.\n\n- Posted by Parent - Lynn\n\n5\n\nWe are so fortunate to be at a school that is so wonderful. My children are thriving, and it's because of the faculty and staff at SJA! They come home and share all the opportunities they experience, and it's incredible to see their excitement and passion.\n\n- Posted by Parent - D\n\n5\n\nWith 10 years (so far) of being a SJA parent and with three children currently attending, I believe that this school is unique and utterly special and we have been blessed to be a part of it! With an incredible faculty, low student-teacher ratio, and rigorous academic program, St. James Academy offers a peerless K-8 educational foundation to its students. Plus, SJA's middle school is the only private middle school in the area to integrate the IB program into the curriculum, preparing children for greater intellectual demands and critical thinking in high school and beyond. The other big bonuses about SJA: 1) tuition nearly half of equivalent private schools and 2) extracurriculars are right on campus. Karate, tennis, chess, robotics, drama, scoutings, voice and instrumental lessons just to name a few--this school will meet your child's interests and needs. SJA even has its own Rec Council. As a mom of three, I can't tell you how much I appreciate having all these things in one spot. Plus, the campus is beautiful and hosts many sports and social activities for SJA families throughout the year. The hard-to-define but utterly special thing about SJA is its sense of community. The whole family is welcomed immediately and made to feel at home always. Parents linger and talk after carpool. Older students high-five younger kids arriving at school. Alumni drop in to hug teachers and pop backstage during play rehearsals to say hi to their younger friends. Teachers become lifetime mentors. The school becomes a second home. Everyone smiles going in and coming out. It is a special place.\n\n- Posted by Parent - Bethd\n\nEndorse St. James Academy. Endorsements should be a few sentences in length. Please include any comments on:\n\nQuality of academic programs, teachers, and facilities\n\nAvailability of music, art, sports and other extracurricular activities\n\nAcademic or athletic awards"
