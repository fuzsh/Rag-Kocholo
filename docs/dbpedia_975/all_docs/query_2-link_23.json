        "text": "Aisles were first added in the 12th century. On each side of the nave two low arched openings pierced through the existing walls gave access to the aisles. These openings were swept away when the present arcade was put in in 1812, but the Norman angle-shafts to the responds can be seen in the wall at each end of the arcade. In the 15th century wider aisles were built, the Norman south doorway moved out to its present position and a porch was built. At the east end of each aisle is a squint giving a view of the altar. One of these is a very rare squint passage which, prior to the installation of choir pews, would have allowed access to the altar. In the North aisle the west wall contains a 13th century lancet window. The south wall of this aisle was at first the outside wall of the church and the rough area of plaster above the Anglo-Saxon window is the original exterior plaster of the Anglo-Saxon church. The wooden box chest is dated 1634. There are some medieval tiles (13th-14th century) on the floor near it and also a few in the south aisle.\n\nThe wooden balcony in the nave is the 15th century rood loft, one of the very few which have survived. When removed, probably early in the reign of Elizabeth I, it was carefully hidden behind a lath and plaster covering against the east wall of the nave, discovered there in 1812 and since repainted. The wooden screen below the loft is Victorian.\n\nThe tower is 15th century. On its floor stands the Norman font (early 12th century). The Font Figure has long been the subject of speculation and debate. However, recent research identifies the carving as being that of St Michael, on an original Saxon font, over-cut by Norman carvings and 16th century desecration. St Michael is also depicted on the font at Winterbourne Monkton, but the Avebury font carving is far earlier than that of Winterbourne Monkton and the saint is depicted as holding a crozier- not a symbol of Episcopal power but rather cosmic, supernatural power. The carvings show two serpents with twisted tails, their heads turned towards the figure of a bishop or Archangel Michael holding a crozier; popular pictures in the middle-ages showed Christ trampling on the dragons of evil and sin. It is also worth noting that the tree, carved in one piece, 12 pillars of wood/ tree trunks circling the font contains a wonderful array of birds.\n\nOn the south wall is the funeral hatchment of Lt. General Sir Adam Williamson, KB, of Avebury Manor, appointed Governor of Jamaica 1790 (who died in 1798). On the north wall are the royal arms of George III, 1760-1820. The stone coffin is 13th-14th century and is one of three found by the south wall of the chancel, probably those of Priors of the adjacent Benedictine Priory.\n\nThe bells are in regular use, restored in 1981. The oldest bell is the tenor, cast in 1719 by Avebury-born Richard Phelps, master of the famous Whitechapel Bell Foundry 1701-1738.\n\nThe chancel and chancel arch are late 13th century. The choir stalls contain some 17th century woodwork. The altar rails are early 18th century. The Bishop’s chair is mid-17th century. The tablet on the south wall is to John Truslow of Truslow Manor (who died in 1593) – Truslow Manor lies at the west end of the bridle path. The tablet on the north wall is to Dame Susanna Holford (who died in 1722). She was the widow of Sir Richard Holford of Avebury Manor and left money for the foundation and endowment of a school in Avebury for children ‘whose parents are not able to teach them to read’.\n\nSet in the east wall of the porch is a fragment of Norman 12th century carved stone. On the outside of the church tower some large stones can be seen in the wall. This is an example of Anglo-Saxon side-alternative quoining, being the cornerstones of what was then the north-west corner of the Anglo-Saxon nave. Here too, built into the wall, is a fragment of Anglo-Saxon cross-shaft of an earlier date.\n\nIn 2014 Martin Palmer of the ARC Foundation assisted us in understanding more about the hidden history of St James Avebury and the other 7 churches in the Upper Kennet Benefice\n\nIn particular, he drew our attention to the West Door of the St James’ where we find the remains of two pilgrim’s cockle shells, the symbol of Santiago (St James). These were, in the past, mistaken for a coat of arms. Full carved cockleshells in very good condition are found on either side of the South facing Main door (internal) – a door protected by a later porch\n\nBetween the 10th and 16th century Pilgrims staying overnight at Fyfield, Winterbourne Basset and Berwick Basset came to St James Avebury for an early morning service. After Mass and Blessing they left on Pilgrimage to Santiago Di Compostela, Rome and Jerusalem through the West door of the church, with the Saint’s blessing protecting them\n\nAn Anglo-Saxon carving external to the church, long held as being something related to land ownership, is a rare and stylised version of the cockle shell. This early depiction of badge of the Palmers, located on the external North wall of the church, is either 10th or 11th century – marking a time when at last one could go on pilgrimage i.e. towards the end of the Anglo Saxon and beginning of the Norman period. This emblem would once have featured as part of the original door to the church.\n\nThe Church was refaced by the Victorians so there is little more to be seen externally. However, the cusp is Norman, not a grave stone as originally thought and is a deliberate emblem and sign of the Pilgrim’s way. The external surfaces of the Tower have some crosses of pilgrimages to both Jerusalem and Santiago Di Compostela but very few in comparison to other churches in the Benefice. Most of the pilgrimage graffiti and other evidence were removed during the Victorian period. Recently, however, we have discovered some rare 15th century footprints embedded in the lead roof which are being investigated\n\nInterior Walls: Crosses, and ‘circle and cross’ depiction of Spiritual Cosmology which Martin also found at Winterbourne Basset. These paint a vivid and moving medieval view of the universe. Consisting of 5 individual rings, the central circle depicts Jerusalem, the site of the Crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus (and thus the birth place of Christianity). The second circle depicts the human world, followed by a 3rd circle of angels, a 4th circle of Archangels, then the 5th circle of the Universe, cut through by a single line – representing the hand of God pointing downwards towards the Earth, sending the Holy Spirit onto Christ. Here in Avebury the Cosmic Circle was rather crudely made, perhaps begun by a priest, and never finished.\n\nMedieval letters carved into the wall circa 1500 are almost certainly a Latin inscription. Surrounded by a large number of pilgrim’s crosses is another inscription and the wall is riddled with pilgrim graffiti.\n\nThere are remains of a large Celtic Cross on floor of Nave –broken into pieces and distributed for incorporation into the floor of the church. A major part of it is missing giving rise to much speculation."
