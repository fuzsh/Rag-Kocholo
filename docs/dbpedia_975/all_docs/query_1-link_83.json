        "text": "In the heart of Baltimore City’s Waverly neighborhood, an historic collaboration is set to breathe new life into our St. John’s Episcopal Church property. At a press conference held November 21 in the sanctuary, community leaders, including Councilwoman Odette Ramos, unveiled a landmark partnership between the Sutton Scholars program, the BIT Center, and the Episcopal Diocese of Maryland.\n\nDuring the announcement, Bishop Carrie expressed her excitement, noting that while it can be somber when a church reaches the end of its lifespan, this partnership marks a continuation of St. John’s original purpose – a space to gather, be nourished, and bless the community. Bishop Sutton offered a video message to the community supporting this exciting new collaboration.\n\nJames Woody, Executive Director of the Sutton Scholars program, eloquently captured the historical significance of the property. He emphasized the sacred journey they were about to embark upon, envisioning a space where young people feel not only welcome but equipped with the skills and tools for a bright future, as well as a community to support them.\n\nReflecting on the swift progression of the partnership, speakers highlighted the deep connection between the Sutton Scholars program, the BIT Center, and the Waverly community. In just four and a half days, leaders from the involved organizations came together, recognizing the unique symbiosis of their missions. Monica Lapenta (Be a Chef for a Day Founder, Executive Director and CEO, The BIT Center), who played a pivotal role in the collaboration, shared her excitement about the future contributions to the community. Monica’s vision extends beyond Sutton Scholars and BIT, envisioning a broader impact on the entire community. St. John’s will become a hub for positive change in the community, fulfilling its mission even beyond its original purpose.\n\nJames emphasized the impact on the youth workforce development program, expressing awe at the rapid collaboration and the potential to create lasting change. With BIT’s expertise and the community’s support, St. John’s is positioned to offer a safe space for young people, addressing the complexities of their lives and providing them opportunities for growth and fulfillment, one of the core values and goals of the Sutton Scholars program. The Sutton Scholars® High School Enrichment Program helps Baltimore City high school students become confident, competent and capable contributors to their communities by equipping them with the life skills that are essential for academic, workplace, and personal success.\n\nMonica’s impassioned vision for the project embraced the multifaceted issues facing Baltimore – from food insecurity and the wealth divide to opportunity gaps and issues faced by immigrants. Monica sees food not just as sustenance but as a powerful tool for change. She described how immigrants in the area once used food to build a new cuisine, bringing people together and creating memories of home. In collaboration with this project, Monica aims to flip the script, making the site an epicenter for dreams, jobs, careers, and community empowerment. The project will focus on art, tech, business, and food, blending them into a force that fuels the dreams of future generations.\n\nAs the event neared its conclusion, the spotlight turned to Rev. Neva Brown, the Director of Community Development and Mentoring. Recognized for her tireless efforts in recruiting young scholars from Baltimore City elementary schools, Rev. Neva has been an essential figure in establishing connections throughout the city. Her work has laid the foundation for providing opportunities for high school students, making her a crucial asset to the Sutton Scholars Program. In addition, Zinha Byrd, Sutton Scholars program coordinator, was recognized. Raising up leaders in the Church, like Zinha, through new channels like the Sutton Scholars program, brings new life to the work of the Church.\n\nAs the press conference drew to a close, the Rev. Canon Christine L. McCloud, canon for administration in the Diocese of Maryland and Chief Program Officer of Sutton Scholars, emphasized the significance of the gathering and thanked everyone for their presence. Bishop Carrie, who has placed her trust in this endeavor, was acknowledged for her vision and commitment to making a positive impact in the community. Canon Chris highlighted Monica’s inspiring vision for the Parish Hall as shared space, the corporate kitchen for entrepreneurial endeavors with food services, and dedicated classroom and activity space for the Sutton Scholars. The collaboration stands as a testament to the power of shared visions and unified actions in transforming sacred spaces into beacons of hope for the entire community. The revitalization of St. John’s, Waverly, is poised to be a symbol of resurrection, collaboration, and positive change in Baltimore City."
