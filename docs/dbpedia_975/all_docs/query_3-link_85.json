I believe in the Holy Spirit; the Holy Christian Church, the communion of saints; the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and life everlasting. Amen.\"\n\n\"Glo-ry be to the Fa-ther, and to the Son, and to the Ho-ly Ghost; As it was in the be-ginning, is now, and ever shall be, world without end. A-men, A - men.\n\nDoctrinal Statement:\n\nThe Scriptures. The Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments were given by inspiration of God, and are the only sufficient, certain and authoritative rule of all saving knowledge, faith and obedience. (II Timothy 3:15-17); II Peter 1:21; John 10:35; Luke 16:29-31; Romans 3:1-2; Acts 16: Hebrew 4:12)\n\nGod. There is but only one true living God, the Maker, Preserver and Ruler of all things, having in and of Himself all perfections and being infinite in all of them; and to Him all creatures owe the highest love, reverence and obedience. (Genesis 1:1-3,16; Psalm 83:18; Exodus 15:11; Isaiah 6:3; John 1:1, 14, 10:30; Matthew 28:19; I Peter 1:15-16)\n\nJesus Christ: Jesus Christ the second person of the Trinity, the only begotten Son of God, is the divinely appointed mediator between God and man. Having taken upon Himself human nature, yet without sin, He perfectly fulfilled the law, suffered and died upon the cross for the salvation of sinners. He was buried, and rose again the third day, and ascended to His Father, at whose right hand He forever liveth to make intercession for His people. He is the only Mediator, Prophet, Priest, and King of the Church and Sovereign of the universe who will come again in glory for all true believers among the living and the dead. (Luke 1:26-33, 22:20, 24:46; John 3:16; Hebrews 4:14; Hebrews 12:24; II Corinthians 5:21; Romans 10:9-10; Philippians 2:6-7; Hebrews 2:9; Matthews 18:11; Matthews 20:28; Colossians 3:1-4).\n\nHoly Spirit: The third person of the Trinity, God and co-existent with the Father and Son. The Holy Spirit is the Chief Agent in the regeneration of the Soul, the Chief convictor of the Sin, and the Chief comforter of the believer. Simultaneous with regeneration the Holy Spirit Baptizes the believer into the body of Christ, permanently indwells Him and seals him in Salvation for eternity. The Holy Spirit is the giver of spiritual gifts to believers. (I Corinthians 12:1-1; Ephesians 1:13-14; John 16:1-13; Titus 3:5; Matthew 3:11; Acts 5:3-4)\n\nThe Trinity. God is revealed to us as Father, Son and Holy Spirit, each with distinct personal attributes, but without division of nature, essence or being. (Romans 1:20; Matthew 28:19; Deuteronomy 4:35; John 17:5).\n\nSalvation: All who believe in faith, receive the Lord Jesus Christ as savior are born again by the Holy Spirit and thus become the Children of God. (Romans 10:9-10, 5:7-11; Colossians 1:13-14, 21-22; John 17:16-22; II Corinthians 5:7; I Corinthians 6:19; Ephesians 1:7. 2:8-9; Acts 2;38; Galatian 3:26)\n\nThe Fall Of Man. God originally created man in His own image and free from sin; but, through the temptation of Satan, he transgressed the command of God and fell from his original holiness and righteousness; whereby his posterity inherit nature corrupt and wholly opposed to God and His law are under condemnation, and as soon as they are capable of moral action, become actual transgressors. (Genesis 1:26-31; 3:1-7; Acts 16:26; John 3:6; Romans 5:12-21; Psalm 51:5; Romans 1:18).\n\nRegeneration. Regeneration is a change of heart, wrought by the Holy Spirit, who quickened the dead in trespasses and sins, enlightening their minds spiritually and savingly to understand the Word of God, and renewing their whole nature, so that they love and practice holiness. It is a work of God's free and special grace alone. (John 3:3, 6:7; James 1:16-18; Romans 2:28-29, 5:5; Philippians 2:13; Colossians 3:9-11; Ephesians 4:20-24; Deuteronomy 30:6; Matthew 3:8-10, 7:20).\n\nRepentance. Repentance is an evangelical grace, wherein a person being, by the Holy Spirit, made sensible of the manifold evil of sin, humbled himself for it, with godly sorrow, detestation of it, and self-abhorrence, with a purpose and endeavor to walk with God so as to please Him in all things. (Romans 10:9-11; Psalm 51; Ephesians 2:8; I John 5:1; Acts 2:37-39, 16:30-31; Hebrews 4:14; James 4:7-10; II Corinthians 7:11, Hebrews 1:8, 8:25).\n\nFaith. Saving Faith is the belief, on God's authority, of whatsoever is revealed in His Word concerning Christ; accepting and resting upon Him alone for justification, sanctification and eternal life. It is wrought in the heart by the Holy Spirit, and is accompanied by all other saving graces and leads to a life of holiness. (Hebrews 11:1-3, 6; Genesis 15:6: Luke 1:35-38; Romans 5:1; Ephesians 2:8-9; James 2:19)\n\nJustification. Justification is God's gracious and full acquittal of sinners, who believe in Christ, from all sin, through the satisfaction that Christ has made, not for anything wrought in them or done by them; but on account of the obedience and satisfaction of Christ, they receiving and resting on Him and His righteousness by faith. (John 1:16; Ephesians 3:8; Romans 5:9, 21; Romans 8:1; Romans 4:4-5; Philippians 3:7-9; Acts 10:43; Zechariah 13:1; I Peter 3:7; Isaiah 3:11-12; 1 John 2:12).\n\nSanctification. Those who have been regenerated are also sanctified by God's word and have the Spirit dwelling in them. This Sanctification is progressive through the supply of Divine strength which all saints seek to obtain, pressing after a heavenly life in cordial obedience to all Christ's commands. (Romans 8:5; II Corinthians 3:18; John 3:6; Philippians 1:4, 1:9-11, 3:12-16; Ephesians 1:13-14, 4:11-12; I Thessalonians 4:3, 5:23; Luke 11:35).\n\nThe founding of the First Baptist Church can be traced back to the 1630s in the US in the then uncolonized state of Rhode Island. A former member of the church of England, Roger Williams is credited with creating the first Baptist church when he split from the Massachusetts Bay Colony over beliefs of church functions. By the late 1700s, there were over 750 Baptist churches all across the US. The fast growth of the Baptist Church movement was attributed to religious freedom and was credited as having a large impact on the First Amendment of the US constitution. The Baptist church is split into many sub-dominations, the largest of which was the Southern Baptists who have over 15 million members.\n\nWhere are you located and when is your Sunday Service?\n\nOur Christian Community Church is located at 2900 W.
