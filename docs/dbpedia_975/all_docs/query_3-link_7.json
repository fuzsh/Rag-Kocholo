How will this reshape our world moving forward?\n\nAs God’s people, the one thing we know we can do is PRAY!\n\nIf there’s one practice that can transform your relationship with God dramatically it is listening to him speaking in his word and praying in response. What might God be waiting to say to you this coming year?\n\nFor those of you who have needs that are not being met, City Church would love to be able to help meet some of those needs through our care connection team.\n\nThis morning, I woke up to at least ten emails on the subject of the coronavirus. Almost every organization is thinking through plans in case of a larger scale outbreak. At City Church, we’ve been thinking through the implications of all this as well.\n\nThis past Sunday, we reflected on Philippians 2:3-4, “Do nothing from selfish ambition or conceit, but in humility count others more significant than yourselves. Let each of you look not only to his own interests, but also to the interests of others.”\n\nWe referenced Dietrich Bonhoeffer’s work, Life Together, and wanted to post the fuller quote."
