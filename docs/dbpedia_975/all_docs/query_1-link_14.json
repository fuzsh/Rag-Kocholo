        "text": "Listen to a short summary\n\nIn the early 19th century, an Episcopal deacon named William Levington took a courageous leap of faith, relocating from Philadelphia to Baltimore City to establish a church for free and enslaved Black people.\n\nThrough adversity, challenges and obstacles, the religious establishment founded by Levington is still standing and has emerged to become a historical fixture in the city and beyond.\n\nSt. James Episcopal Church, nestled in the heart of West Baltimore at the intersection of North Arlington and West Lafayette Avenues, is celebrating its 200th year.\n\n“It speaks to longevity. There aren’t many institutions of any kind that can say they’re 200 years old,” said Helen Griffin Anderson, who serves as the senior warden at St. James.\n\n“It was the members, and it was the leadership. Because of their commitment to God, to their faith, that’s why we’re still here. We’re still relevant.”\n\nAs senior warden, Anderson is a layperson with a leadership role within the parish. The St. Paul, Minnesota, native moved to Baltimore more than five decades ago.\n\nShe has been a member of St. James since 1970. From the moment Anderson stepped foot in the church, she knew it was a special place.\n\n“When I came to St. James, it was clear to me this was a special place. I wasn’t exactly sure why, but I knew it was special,” said Anderson, who spent her career as an educator in the Baltimore City School system.\n\n“As I continued to worship there, then it became revealed to me what made it special. When I began to hear about the history of the church, how it was established, when it was established and how important it was in the city of Baltimore, it just kind of all came together for me, and I said ‘This is it. This is why this is such a special place.’”\n\nFounded in 1824 – nearly 40 years prior to the signing of the Emancipation Proclamation – St. James was the first Black Episcopal congregation established south of the Mason-Dixon line.\n\nThe church is a vital institution and staple in the Greater Baltimore region. With sights set on a promising future, St. James’ parishioners and supporters strive to maintain its Episcopal roots alongside its African American heritage.\n\nSt. James has stood the test of time, and in some of the city’s most challenging periods, it was a place for people of all ages to gather, socialize, receive mentorship and build a sense of community. The religious structure was particularly special to thousands of West Baltimore residents.\n\nThrough its food distribution program, outreach efforts, summer enrichment program, Angel Tree project in collaboration with the Druid Hill YMCA, and St. James Academy in collaboration with Harlem Park Elementary, the church is doing its due diligence to empower local residents.\n\n“We like to say that we are serving our community,” Anderson said.\n\n“Could we do more? Absolutely, there’s always more work to be done. But we think we are doing God’s work, and that’s why we’re still here. We’re still standing 200 years later because we are serving God’s people through worship and through our community involvement.”\n\nA number of legendary figures have either worshiped at St. James or have been honorary guests, including former Afro American Newspapers publisher Carl Murphy and Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall, among many others.\n\nThis year marks the church’s Jubilee, which is a year-long celebration. Some events hosted so far by the church this year included a book discussion, concerts and special choir performances, and a festival.\n\nDuring Jubilee weekend, there was a uniquely designed piece of artwork on display at the church – known as a sampler – that closely resembles what many would consider tapestry. The artwork was created by Levington in the early 1830s and holds sentimental value among St. James parishioners and supporters.\n\nA banquet held June 7, 2024, followed by a Jubilee Mass gathering on June 9, were the highlighted events of St. James’ 200th anniversary.\n\nThe Reverend Michael Curry, who now serves as the presiding bishop of the Episcopal Church, was the rector of St. James from 1988 to 2000. He returned “home” and helped celebrate the Jubilee bicentennial as the guest preacher during Mass on June 9.\n\nCurry was joined by The Reverend Raphael Warnock, who recently made history as the first Black American to represent Georgia in the Senate. The Right Reverend Carrie Schofield-Broadbent, bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Maryland, served as a co-presiding celebrant.\n\nJubilee Mass was also a homecoming of sorts. Numerous individuals who once attended St. James returned to the church to support the bicentennial celebration.\n\nMore than 44 “sons” and “daughters” of St. James have become deacons, priests, canons and ministers in the Episcopal church and other protestant denominations. Others have become professors in divinity schools, prolific biblical scholars and authors, and school chaplains.\n\nCharles Cephas, a lifetime member of St. James, serves as the co-chair of the church’s Jubilee committee.\n\n“It speaks to our longevity,” Cephas said of the church’s 200th anniversary.\n\nOn the evening of June 7, St. James hosted its 200th Anniversary Jubilee Gala at Martin’s West. The evening included dinner, live music and a program facilitated by WJZ -TV anchor Vic Carter, who was the master of ceremonies.\n\n“It was just overwhelming, and just to have the presiding bishop [there] in attendance was just a wonderful, wonderful experience,” Cephas said of the recent Jubilee events."
