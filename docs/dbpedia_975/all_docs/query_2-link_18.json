Be with us now and bless us as we set apart this welcome sign to your praise and glory and in memory of Helen Kathy Waugh; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.\n\nAntiphon\n\nI was a stranger and you welcomed me.\n\nOh, the majesty and magnificence of God’s presence!\n\nOh, the power and the splendor of his sanctuary!\n\nLet us pray. (Silence)\n\nO God, whose blessed Son has sanctified and transfigured the use of material things: Receive this welcome sign which we offer, and grant that it may proclaim your love, benefit your Church, and minister grace and joy to those who see it; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen."
