In addition to learning in an atmosphere that is challenging and fun, perhaps the greatest benefit for children is the opportunity to enjoy the company of intellectual peers.\n\nScholarships: No\n\nComments:\n\nDesigned for children ages 6-13, the camp curriculum has been created to offer a wide variety of programs to meet the interests, abilities, and needs of our campers.
