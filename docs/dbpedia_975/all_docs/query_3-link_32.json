For guidance on researching specific collections, see: Additional Search Strategies below.\n\nIf you have any questions, please contact msa.helpdesk@maryland.gov.\n\nGeneral Search Tips\n\nFor browsing or simple searches, use Keyword search under Quick Search.\n\nFor more specific searches, use the Advanced Search.\n\nTo navigate directly to a specific collection, series, or item with its collection number, use Collection Number search under Quick Search.\n\nBe as general as possible with search terms. For example, the Baltimore Sun is cataloged as “Sun” and a search for “Baltimore Sun” will not return the right result.\n\nIf a search returns too many results, try refining your terms. If that is not possible you can use CTRL + F to find a desired term on the page.\n\n\"+\" Search Modifier\n\nWhen searching by Keyword, or using the Advanced Search’s Description field, the \"+\" operator can be used to focus search results. Use \"+\" to add additional terms to search by.\n\nExample: \"Baltimore + Photographs\" searches for \"Baltimore\" AND \"Photographs\".\n\nExample: \"Baltimore American + 1915\" searches for \"Baltimore American\" AND \"1915\".\n\nQuick Search\n\nProvides easy access by keyword or by collection\n\nKeyword Search searches multiple fields for the given keywords. It allows the use of the '+' search modifier.\n\nKeyword searches the following fields:\n\nCollection Name\n\nAuthor\n\nDescription\n\nMedium\n\nCollection Number search navigates the user to the information page of the collection, series, or item of the given collection number.\n\nCollection Number search uses only the numerical portion of the collection number, and does not require the \"MSA SC\" prefix.\n\nExamples:\n\nCollection Level: \"1399\"\n\nSeries Level: \"1399-1\"\n\nItem Level: \"1399-1-597\"\n\nSub-Item Level: \"1399-1-597-1\"\n\nAdvanced Search\n\nSearch based upon selected criteria.\n\nCollection Name searches name of collection, which often is named after a newspaper title, family, or the collection donor.\n\nCollection Number searches collection number assigned to each collection. It is a unique number, like a Library call number. It does not require the \"MSA SC\" prefix.\n\nAuthor searches author of collection. Different collections use multiple formats for the author field. If searching by name, use last name. Only use last name, first name syntax if necessary.\n\nDescription searches description field of collection. It allows use of the \"+\" search modifier\n\nDate searches date field of collection for the text entered. For example, if \"1896\" is entered, \"1896\", \"1896/12/30\", and \"1640-1896\" would be returned but not \"1890-1900\". When searching for a specific date, use the format year then month then day including leading zeros, example \"1663/09/09\".\n\nAdditional Search Strategies\n\nAccess specific types of records.\n\nFor General historical photograph inquiries and thumbnail images of our most-requested collections of photographs circa 1860 to 1939, see: Historical Photographs of Maryland (mdhistpics). For descriptions of photographs in other collections, keyword search our Guide to Special Collections.\n\nFor Church record inquiries, see: Guide to Religious Institutions in Maryland.\n\nFor Map inquiries: The Maryland State Archives Atlas of Historical Maps of Maryland 1608-1908, by Edward C. Papenfuse and Joseph M. Coale III (Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2003), provides an excellent overview. See: Map Collections Guide for historic maps by cartographer or by title.\n\nFor Newspaper inquiries, see: Guide to Maryland Newspapers.\n\nFor In-depth historical or genealogical research, see: list of private researchers and genealogists.\n\nThis web site is presented for reference purposes under the doctrine of fair use.
