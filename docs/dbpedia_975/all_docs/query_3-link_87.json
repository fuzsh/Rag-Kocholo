        "text": "Welcome to our Church\n\nWe believe that you are never a stranger in God’s house and only a visitor once. Come and enjoy our loving family atmosphere where people from all walks of life, and diverse ethnic and national origins worship and grow together, strengthening one another as children of One Father.\n\n1 Cor 12:13 “For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free; and have been all made to drink into one Spirit.”\n\nYou are welcome to follow us on facebook, and join us for our live streaming services on Sunday, Tuesday and Thursday.\n\nWe honor and serve our military\n\nHere at NTCC we understand the challenges faced by our military and by their families.\n\nBeing separated from home, your relatives and friends, coupled with the demands of military life can really take its toll. We want you to know that here we welcome you, and we're here for you. You will be treated with respect and appreciated. We count it a great honor to serve the military community, and appreciate our active duty, retirees and veterans. Come on and join us, where everyone here is treated like family.\n\nPastor’s Corner\n\nAs a full-gospel church, NTCC believes the entire Bible to be the living and inspired Word of God. We believe that salvation is by grace through faith (“For the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men, Teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world;” (Titus 2:11-12)), with the subsequent evidence of a changed life. We preach the gospel of Jesus Christ; that Christ is the incarnate God, virgin born and sent from Heaven by God the Father. “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.” (John 3:16)."
