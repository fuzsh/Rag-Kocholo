        "text": "October 1st, 2018\n\nMeatless Monday, White Onion Soup Chablis, Recipe, Easy, Comfort Food, Soup, Delaware Beaches, The Beach Eats, Southern Delaware, Recipes Begged, Borrowed and Stolen\n\nMeatless Monday is a trend. In reality you can do this any day of the week. One day or more than one. But it is catchy to say “Meatless Monday”. Leaving the meat behind and for one day enjoy the many dishes that usually revolve around meats.\n\nI have roots in Baltimore. My husband was from Baltimore. My sister in law lives there. I worked in Baltimore for years before moving to the Delaware Beaches. Way before I started this blog too. Baltimore is a city of many firsts. Museums, churches, hospitals, neighborhoods. Many times it gets bad reviews but I really enjoyed my time there.\n\nPrivate Collections: A Culinary Treasure is a cookbook that contains timeless recipes put out by the Women’s Committee of the Walters Art Gallery, a one of a kind museum located in Baltimore. Beautiful art treasures are displayed in its pages, along with amazing recipes from soups to nuts.\n\nI have posted this recipe before, but just in case you missed it, here it is again. It is a different type of onion soup but the combination of ingredients makes it a winner.\n\nONION SOUP CHABLIS\n\n1 lb. white onions, sliced very thin\n\n1/4 lb. butter\n\n2 cups chicken broth (your choice of unsalted or salted, or even a mixture of both)\n\n1 cup Chablis\n\n1 tsp. salt\n\npepper\n\n2 cups medium cream (half and half will do too)\n\nSwiss cheese, freshly grated\n\nIn a large soup pot saute the onions in butter until soft and transparent but not brown. Add chicken broth and simmer until the mixture is reduced somewhat. To tell you the truth, I skipped that step.\n\nAdd the Chablis, salt, and pepper. Bring to a boil.\n\nReduce heat and simmer for about 2 minutes.\n\nStir in cream, heat, not boil, and serve.\n\nGarnish with plenty of cheese. The marriage of flavors is awesome!! You’ll see. Enjoy!\n\nServes 6.\n\nRemember that with any recipe you can always make it your own.\n\nMarch 29th, 2015\n\nHistoric Churches, Chapels, Architectural Wonders, It’s Sunday, A Day for Worship, 13 Churches on My Travels\n\nAlways look forward to visiting churches on my travels. Not necessarily on a time when religious services are taking place. I like them when they are totally quiet. For me is a time for reflection; to pray for my family and friends. I usually stop at churches of all denominations, even though I am Catholic. I thank for our religious freedom. Historic churches and chapels…I am in awe of their beauty and of their strength.\n\nHere are some of my favorite churches and the list is getting longer.\n\nNEW YORK\n\nSt. Patrick’s Cathedral is a New York Landmark. In 1785 there were only 200 Catholics and one priest in New York City. The doors opened in 1879. The newspapers hailed the New Cathedral as “the noblest temple ever raised in any land to the memory of Saint Patrick, and as the glory to Catholic America”. When I have visited New York with my friend, Shelley, who is Jewish…she always makes a point to stop at St. Patrick’s. So beautiful.\n\nSt. Paul’s Chapel was built in 1766. It is the oldest public building in continuous use in Manhattan. It survived the Great Fire of 1776 and the attacks on 9/11. George Washington prayed here after his inauguration in 1789. It is located at 209 Broadway, between Fulton St. and Vesey St. Still standing against all odds, this church has been a place not only for spiritual healing but for physical refuge, as well.\n\nPUERTO RICO\n\nI grew up in the Island of Puerto Rico. When you see my posts from there is because that’s where my formative years took place. Old San Juan is the Capital and it is over 500 years old. La Catedral de San Juan is formally known as the San Juan Bautista Cathedral, named after the Puerto Rican Patron Saint, San Juan Bautista or Saint John the Baptist. It is located on Cristo St. between Luna St. and San Francisco St. It was built in 1540 and it is the second oldest cathedral in the Western Hemisphere. The Cathedral contains the tomb of Spanish explorer, Ponce de Leon. And, the mummified remains of Roman Christian Martyr, Saint Pio.\n\nCapilla del Cristo or Christ’s Chapel is located at the end of Calle del Cristo, which is also where the Cathedral is located. The Chapel was built to commemorate a miracle. Local lore has it that as a young man lost control of his horse and galloped down Calle del Cristo over the cliff at the end of the road, he prayed to a Catholic saint and his prayers were answered.\n\nParroquia San Francisco de Asis is located at San Francisco Street #301 in Old San Juan. The Crypt – As in old colonial churches, the remains of Christians were buried in catacombs. This can also be seen at the entrance of the Parish. They are called catacombs similar to the Roman catacombs but they are crypts. In the crypt are the remains of personalities of Puerto Rico. They are considered of important historical heritage.\n\nIglesia Dulce Nombre de Jesus is located in the town plaza of Humacao. This is where I grew up. It is on the eastern side of the island. I went to primary school at Academia San Jose which was across the street. My family went to church here, my parents were married in this church, and I also made my First Communion there. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Originally, it was a single structure built in 1769. A second church was built from 1825-1826. The present church was built in 1868-1877. It was designed by Don Evaristo de Churruca in the Gothic Revival style. Further renovations have taken place since then.\n\nParroquia Nuestra Senora del Carmen is located at 33 Marina, in Punta Santiago near my hometown, Humacao. Punta Santiago is a fishing village. Nuestra Senora del Carmen is the patron saint of Fishermen. The official Feast Day is July 16th. I have fond memories of this church. It is always kept in pristine condition. My late husband, John, and I got married here. We chose this church because it was on the beach and it really is pretty, small and cozy. It was the second wedding….first one in Orlean, Virginia and then this one in 2 complete different years. One was not enough!!\n\nSHOWELL, MARYLAND, EASTERN SHORE\n\nSaint Martin’s Historic Church and the importance of historic preservation. For so many years it stood neglected, just waiting for those who would take over the mission of its restoration. It is considered by many historians “to be the finest preserved, most significant piece of American history on the Lower Eastern Shore”. It is an Architectural gem, built in 1756, and a museum located at 11413 Worcester Highway in Showell, Maryland. For more info., please visit http://www.historicstmartinschurg.org.\n\nLEWES, DELAWARE\n\nSt. Peter’s Church is located at 2nd & Market Streets in Historic Lewes, Delaware. Lewes is the First Town in the First State. Since 1680 this church has served this community. The early settlers who were members of the Church of England formed its first congregation. The graveyard which surrounds the Church has stones dating back to 1707. Stop by while strolling Lewes.\n\nBALTIMORE, MARYLAND\n\nThe Baltimore Basilica’s is America’s First Cathedral. I have a deep connection to Baltimore. My late husband was from Baltimore and many years ago, I lived and worked in Baltimore. Love the City. The Basilica’s construction started in 1806. George Weigel, the biographer for Pope John Paul II said “No other Catholic edifice in America can claim to have seen so much history inside its walls”. At least 15 saints or potential saints have prayed in this Basilica. The Crypt inside the Basilica holds the tombs of Archbishop John Carroll, the first Bishop of the United States of America, Archbishop Martin John Spalding, and James Cardinal Gibbons.\n\nPHILADELPHIA, PENNSYLVANIA\n\nPhiladelphia has 4 Catholic shrines: St John Neumann, St. Katherine Drexel, Miraculous Medal and St. Rita of Cascia. Philadelphia is considered a city where the foundations for our right to freedom and religion were laid. The National Shrine of St. Rita of Cascia is located at 1166 S. Broad St. and it was built in 1907. I came to know it during my stay in Philadelphia the summer of 2013.\n\nCHARLESTON, SOUTH CAROLINA\n\nSt. Michael’s Catholic Church is located at 71 Broad St. in Historic Charleston. A National Historic Landmark. Pewes are made of native cedar and remain the same as they have always been. The altar is Victorian. The chancel rail is made of wrought iron. It dates to 1772. George Washington worshipped at Governor’s Pew #43. This church is gorgeous and the docent was so amazingly inspiring.\n\nSt. Philip’s Protestan Episcopal Church is located at 142 Church St. in Historic Charleston. The original building was completed in 1724, destroyed by fire in 1835 and finished the rebuilding in 1838. Porticos and columns remind visitors of Roman porticos. This church is also a National Historic Landmark and has the tallest steeple in Historic Charleston. The docent was so nice and proud of her church.\n\nI am looking forward to this list getting longer. These churches welcome us all. Many of them are so simple. Some are architectural wonders. You don’t really have to look for them, some times they find you.\n\nAnother magical Sunday….but waiting for summer is what I am doing.\n\nFebruary 6th, 2015\n\nDelmarva Connections, “Brewmore Baltimore”, Documentary, Friday, March 6, 2015, Rehoboth Beach Film Society, Lewes Historical Society, Delaware Beaches, Southern Delaware\n\nWhat temperature to serve beer? It has to do with one’s preference….mine? I love it ice cold….with a side of steamed crabs!!\n\nThe Rehoboth Beach Film Society and the Lewes Historical Society are co-presenting Delmarva Connections. This is a 3-part film series that explore connections to the region around us. The final event of the 2015 series takes place on Friday, March 6th at 7:00 p.m. with a screening of the film, “Brewmore Baltimore” at The INN at Canal Square, 122 West Market Street in Lewes, Delaware.\n\nFor those comming to the Delaware Beaches for a week-end of fun and relaxation, March is a wonderful month at the beach. So, I am giving you plenty of time to make plans because this documentary is worth seeing if you are a beer aficionado.\n\nThis informative domentary chronicles the story of one of the most vibrant and popular industries in the U.S…..BEER!! With nealy one billion in annual sales, the U.S. beer market is growing rapidly. At its peak, in the early 1900s, the brewing industry in Baltimore distributed products by over 40 distinct breweries, and National Brewing Company was a producing over 1 million barrels per year. Although the industry declined, it made a resurgence in the mid-1980s and microbreweries started opening in neighborhoods throughout the city. “Brewing Baltimore” takes us on a journey through Baltimore’s past and present as historian Maureen O’Prey guides us through the city’s rich brewing history. We learn about the old stalwarts of the trade and are introduced to Baltimore’s newes set of modern day brewers. A review on http://www.baltimorepostexaminer.com says “When the film ends, it feels much like the introduction to something much larger. It’s like it’s setting up some grand adventure that is just beginning.” When you open the website above mentioned, put Brewmore Baltimore on the Search.\n\nA post film discussion will be led by filmmaker Nicholas Kovacic and Baltimore historian Maureen O’Prey. Admission for this event is $5 for adults and $3 for children 12 and under. Tickets can be purchased online at http://www.rehobothfilm.com, or by calling the Rehoboth Beach Film Society at 302-645-9095, ext. 1.\n\nRBFS’ mission: To promote cinematic arts and to provide educational and cultural enrichment for our community. The Rehoboth Beach Independent Film Festival will be November 11-15, 2015….mark your calendars!!\n\nHave a good one!!\n\nNote: My photos are from The Boulder Beer Company in Boulder, Colorado, and Dogfish Head in Milton, Delaware….both tours are excellent!!!\n\nNovember 23rd, 2014\n\nHorseshoe Casino, Baltimore, Maryland, Table Games, Slots, Entertainment….Dining!! Guy Fieri’s Baltimore Kitchen & Bar, Casual Dining, Burgers, Wings, Small Bites, Shareables, Downtown Charm City, Maryland\n\nI’ll bet you…..Who hasn’t said this at one point or another? We all have. You are gambling on the outcome of something. Growing up in the Island of Puerto Rico, a destination for gambling, it was no big deal. Let’s face it. You “wanna” gamble, you’ll do it anywhere, even from the comforts of your own home.\n\nIn Puerto Rico the islanders do visit the casinos which are in every hotel. Years back the dress code was: men would wear coats and the women were very smartly dressed. Casinos would have racks filled with coats of every size for those that did not have any. After dinner it was fun to go to the casinos and try your luck and hopefully nobody would have to stroll the walk of shame.\n\nOne of my favorite casinos in Puerto Rico was the one at the El San Juan Hotel in Isla Verde. Elegant and classic, just like casinos should be. It still looks that way.\n\nCasinos bring out a lot of emotions on people. The gambling factor, the drinking, the undesirables….but, some will always live La Vida Loca. Pennsylvania, and Delaware have casinos. So, when Marylanders were up in arms about the casinos coming to Maryland……I was like, what’s the big deal? The State needs money, and jobs. Otherwise, they will come to Delaware and Pennsylavania, so if you can’t fight them, you might as well join them.\n\nHorseshoe Casino opened in Baltimore, in August of this year. Arriving in Baltimore, I passed it and did not even notice it. That’s how understated it is. Located at 1525 Russell St., Baltimore, MD 21230. Tel. 844-777-SHOE. Website? http://www.caesars.com/baltimore. Right next to the Ravens’ Stadium, Orioles Stadium, and the Inner Harbor….walking distance!!\n\nHorseshoe Casino offers free parking, which by the way is bright, and with plenty of security around the perimeter of the casino. We are in Downtown Baltimore and just like any downtown, security is a must.\n\nHorseshoe has partnered with the local hotels. You can make reservations right from their website. The casino has 122,000 sq.ft. of gaming space. For those that love table games…Blackjack, Craps, Bacarat, Roulette and plenty more. Check the website above mentioned. Slots? Many, many. It is also a multi-level casino.\n\nWe arrived early afternoon, just in time for lunch. Entertainment in this cool bar at Horseshoe was already on-going.\n\nFor those that love to sit at a bar and enjoy a food court for there is a level just for that.\n\nCelebrity chefs have taken notice of Baltimore and the charm this city has to offer. We decided to visit Guy Fieri’s Baltimore Kitchen & Bar. This restaurant has seating for 350 customers, but it does not feel that big.\n\nGuy Fieri has about 7 other restaurants throughout the U.S. So, this latest one is part of the branding of a chef’s cuisine.\n\nImmediately, we noticed that the servers were attentive and friendly.\n\nAre you hungry? Be prepared for large portions. Shareables, they call it. Eat them tapas style. I am not kidding, the portions were huge and the food was great. You will have to “up” your exercise routine, after dining here.\n\nI started to notice other customers getting their food brought to the table….wow, we were in for some trouble.\n\nThe B-More Fries passed by….waffle cut with a creamy blue crab dip, Old Bay and green onions. You see what I mean?\n\nA Caesar Salad!!\n\nA Burger followed those gigantic dishes for 2 people.\n\nWe had already ordered and suddenly our table was covered with food…decadence!!\n\nFollowing is what we had.\n\nShashimi Won-Tacos – Love these, really, they were delicious. Sashimi grade ahi tuna and mango jicama salsa on crispy wonton taco shells, drizzled with sweet soy and wasabi cream.\n\nVegas Fries – A Guy Fiori’s signature dish. The crispy cut fries, the spicy buffalo sauce, topped with blue cheese crumbles, served with a blue-sabi dipping sauce. Crispy, well seasoned and the sauces were just right. Yikes!\n\nLollipop wings served with veggies and Guy’s blue sabi sauce, added to an already exciting afternoon lunch. These particular wings a little sweet and a little tangy! Easy to handle!\n\nHow could we not have a salad? Always complementing a lunch or dinner….this was a meal in itself. The Guy-Talian Deli Salad it was called. It was in a crown of prosciutto-wrapped smoked provolone. It was also filled with crisp romaine lettuce, imported Italian meats and cheeses, pickled veggis and tossed in a red wine vinaigrette. Totally, awesome! Presentation and taste did not disappoint.\n\nNeedless to say….no dessert was needed or necessary, but they do offer desserts comparable in size to our lunch.\n\nI think Horseshoe is a good addition to Downtown Baltimore. Check the websites for the upcoming events at Horseshoe.\n\nSomething that caught my attention was that on Thursday nights, except Thanksgiving and Christmas…Chips & Salsa is a happening thing at Johnny Sanchez. This restaurant offers extended Happy Hour on Thursdays and free Salsa Lessons by dance instructors Mike Fok and Kaya Barraza. This Mexican and Southwestern restaurant was opened by celebrity chefs John Besh and Aaron Sanchez.\n\nHave a good one!!\n\nAugust 24th, 2014\n\nDestination? The Manor Tavern, Full Service Tavern, Restaurant, Monkton, Maryland, Maryland’s Horse Country, Bringing Back the Era of Sustainability\n\nI have a strong connection with Baltimore, Maryland. First of all, my husband, John, was from Baltimore. For years I worked in Downtown Baltimore, watching the Inner Harbor take place. Baltimore has fantastic neighborhoods and awesome food.\n\nThe Maryland’s countryside is so pretty. Rolling hills….it is also horse country. Back in June I visited The Manor Tavern located at 15819 Old York Rd., Monkton, MD 21111. This is northern Baltimore County. Tel. 410-791-8155. Website? http://www.themanortavern.com.\n\nThis is a full fledge tavern, with a property that has been in existence since 1750 when stables were located in what it is now The Manor Tavern. If you are from Baltimore, probably, at some time or another you have attended events or have gone to lunch, dinner, or Sunday Brunch. There are the regulars that make The Manor Tavern their watering hole.\n\nThe Manor Tavern opens 7 days a week. Monday through Thursday from 11:30 a.m. until 12:00 a.m. Friday from 11:30 a.m. until 2:00 a.m. Saturday from 11:00 a.m. until 2:00 a.m. And, Sunday, from 10:00 a.m. until 12:00 a.m.\n\nThey told us that we needed to have the Truffle Fries….a must. At first I said “no way”, but, they twisted my arm and I had to order them. First things first, though\n\nWe sat outside….afterall, it was June.\n\nOn the menu we saw the Crispy Brussels Sprouts….Also a must!! Best I have had, and I do have them anywhere they will serve them. Tender inside, crispy outside with red salt and a tangy dipping sauce.\n\nWe ordered hamburgers.\n\nMine was The Manor Burger. A classic burger for sure. Crabstone Farms Black Angus, topped with sharp cheddar, Swiss and apple wood smoked bacon. Medium rare for me. Delish!! See those fries? They are the truffle fries..hand cut, with truffle oil, garlic, and dusted with parmessan cheese. To die for!\n\nThe Gunpowder Bison Burger made an appearance on our table, as well. It had roasted garlic cream cheese, arugula, apple wood smoked bacon and truffle oil. Again, the truffle fries were ordered.\n\nThe Manor Tavern is bringing back the era of sustainability. On their property the organic gardens were taking shape. The gardens work year-round. The Manor Tavern also uses local vendors and growers.\n\nAfter lunch we took a walk through the gardens and this is what was growing in June.\n\nPlease note that The Manor Tavern is able to accommodate parties, graduations, weddings….you name it. Just give them a call.\n\nHave a great day!!\n\nOctober 24th, 2013\n\nJohn Merryman, III…10/24/46-8/31/13, Husband, Father, Friend…Always…The Way We Were\n\nToday I celebrate John’s life. My husband, John, passed away peacefully on August 31st. All the emotions are there; sadness, anger, and even relief for him.\n\nJohn’s birthday was October 24th. This date is also our anniversay. I did not want him to forget it. He also would be mortified to be featured on my blog. This post is for me. He was private, conservative in his dressing and views, and had a very dry sense of humor.\n\nJohn and I met in Puerto Rico in 1973 and nobody thought we would last. They would say “Gloria is dating a gringo”. No kidding, they never thought it would. The funny part is that we did and only a few that married at the time stayed together.\n\nLife was, definitely, simpler then. John and I were so young; no worries, no responsibilities, and practically, no bills. This photo says it all. It was taken in 1975 in St. Thomas.\n\nJohn lived in El Yunque, way inside the rainforest in Puerto Rico. The house was designed by a student of Frank Lloyd Wright; all open with the jungle staring at you all the time.\n\nWe used to spend time with Louie who also lived even deeper into the rainforest, in a thatch roof hut that was out of a novel, collecting rare orchids and anthuriums.\n\nWhen we moved from Puerto Rico, we chose the Delaware Beaches to live. We never lived away from the ocean. We really enjoyed it. Plus, we were just a few hours drive from Baltimore, Maryland, where John was from.\n\nWe, actually, have 2 anniversaries; In Virginia and in Puerto Rico, married in different years.\n\nFamily, business, and responsibilities, then followed. And, plenty of friends along the way. He loved to hunt, golf, fish, ski, and the beach. John was the original “foodie”, when that word was not even part of the vocabulary. We showed Michael and John how to work the blue crabs early.\n\nHis passion was real estate and the company he founded in 1988, in Bethany Beach, was his baby. Tidewater Realty, Ltd. was a boutique style real estate firm catering to customers who appreciated personal and individual attention. He sold a lifestyle that was also his own.\n\nJohn loved good craftmanship and one of the last things he wanted was a box to be made for his Mariner’s Compass, circa 1885. Scott Angelucci of Angelucci’s Fine Woodworking in Milford, Delaware, was commissioned by John to make the box.\n\nThe main wood is Tiger Maple. The dark trim and the dark wood on the compass rose is called wenge and grows in the Congo River. The lighter wood on the compass rose is yellow heart and grows in South America. The repeated inlad design is cherry, maple and walnut. Inside, the box is lined with velvet on the bottom and the rim is zebra wood, which grows in Africa. The box is gorgeous and John would have loved it.\n\nI opened one of my Kind Notes and it said: “Gone from our sight, never from our hearts.”\n\nI can close my eyes and turn the pages of my personal album. Forty years together is a lifetime. And John always said he had a good life. He had his family’s back and I had his back.\n\nAnd, until we meet again…for now, it is one foot in front of the other.\n\nApril 21st, 2013\n\nWho Signs It? Joe Flacco, Ravens, Quaterback, Super Bowl 47 MVP, 2013, University of Delaware Alum, Public Signing, Baltimore, Maryland\n\nWho signs it? It is my post as I took off for Baltimore, Maryland in search of Joe Flacco’s signature on Saturday, 4/20.\n\nThere are variables in the value of collectibles….supply and demand being one of them; another might be a sentimental reason. What’s it worth to you or anyone else? If you want some info. on this topic, please visit http://www.sportsgalleryweb.com/whats_it_worth.htm.\n\nJoe Flacco played for University of Delaware. My son was part of that graduating class. On that graduation day, Carl Ripkin, Baltimore Orioles, gave his first commencement speech, as well. We follow both teams; the Baltimore Orioles and the Baltimore Ravens. So it is understandable that when opportunities arise for a signature….we take them. Right now, my son’s University of Delaware’s diploma is signed by both of them. And every time….it has been said that, it is one of the most unique signing requests.\n\nAt this particular public signing, some of the fans present were surprised that Joe Flacco was signing so quickly after the Ravens’ win. There were probably around 400 plus fans waiting for him to sign for only 2 hours. It can get a little pricey….the cost is driven by how many pieces you want signed, and how you want them signed. There were people there with small items of memorabilia, helmets, posters…and some big photos, as well.\n\nYou also have to have patience. When Joe came in, you could not help but notice him. Very tall, clean cut..and he smiled. Immediately flashes of light were hitting him. I think he is used to it…did not even flinch.\n\nAs I was waiting for my turn, I met Bill. We chatted and it made the time pass a little faster. He was a true fan with plenty of signatures already in his possession. He also told me that he was getting his “man cave” ready for his retirement in Lewes, Delaware, with plenty of Ravens in that “cave”.\n\nThe magic of attending Super Bowl week is a total experience; more so, if your team is playing. My son, also, attended the Super Bowl in New Orleans. The entry ticket was what I was having Joe Flacco sign. Finally my turn came. Joe was very gracious to all of us.\n\nThe waiting was long, the signing took a few seconds. You better be fast with the camera. I was standing right in front of him. My ticket was an easy one to sign. I said to him…wait a minute, the picture….he said…”action shot, action shot”, while moving his hands with a smile. Here it is.\n\nI stopped at the next table to get Joe Flacco’s signature officially authenticated….you might as well. No questions asked…it was his signature.\n\nHave a good one!!\n\nApril 1st, 2013\n\nTraveling, Airports, Airlines….US Airways, Patience….Venting!!\n\nDuring the 1940’s and 1950’s , it was when the U.S. interstate system came about. People took to the roads….much easier now to see the states; more direct routes. States wanted to capitalize on tourism. They made packable souvenirs. Tablecloths were one of such souvenirs. They showed the tourist areas of that particular state traveled. These vintage tablecloths are now sought after.\n\nTaking to the roads, that’s what I should have done on Easter Sunday when I found myself traveling south. US Airways is the reason for my venting.\n\nThe international airports closest to the Delaware and Maryland Beaches are BWI, and Philly. But, there is one regional airport that when it does go smoothly, then, it is very convenient. It is in the town of Salisbury, Maryland. US Airways flies from this airport with stops in Philly or Charlotte. You will then have to connect to your final destination.\n\nGetting up at 5 a.m. with plenty of time to get to Salisbury. About one hour’s drive. Flight was at 8:30 a.m. Lots of people were there already; the plane holds about 50 people or even more.\n\nFirst delay….I already missed my connection. They put me on a later flight from Charlotte. People started panicking. Some were even getting on cruises.\n\nWhat’s the problem?…I asked. “The plane is broken. They are trying to fix it.” Hmmm, that was comforting.\n\nAnother hour goes by. Next delay. Now instead of PBI (West Palm), I am now being sent to Ft. Lauderdale.\n\nAnother hour goes by. A later plane to Ft. Lauderdale.\n\nFinally, they said….an indefinite delay, but it could take off. Well, they told me that there was a flight leaving from Baltimore at 3:30 p.m.\n\nSo, there I was driving to Baltimore, another 2 plus hours, which is where I should have gone in the first place.\n\nThe people that were going on the cruise went home practically in tears.\n\nThe lady that had paid $150 extra to go through Salisbury instead of Philly….oh yes…she was rerouted through Philly.\n\nBWI was not as crowded. Of course, I am now in Baltimore and my return flight is to Salisbury. No, they could not change that there. That was a Salisbury thing. I needed to call their Customer Service pronto and tell them my dilema. They gave me the number and they graciously changed it to Baltimore with no added charges. Surprise, surprise!!\n\nCharlotte airport was crazy. It was packed and you better be in good shape otherwise you will miss your connection. People were running to get to their gate. I took my time. I had one hour.\n\nBy this time I was thinking that if I had driven to Florida, I would have been almost to Jacksonville.\n\nOf course, there was a slight delay as we sat on the runway. Imagine that.\n\nWe got to Ft. Lauderdale at 8:20 p.m. My 4th airport, and not a soul in sight. Easy drive to my final destination…about 25 minutes.\n\nThen, I opened my email and there is a survey from US Airways….asking me to let them know how my last experience flying with them was. I am still laughing. I cannot wait to really vent to them.\n\nTalk to you later..Have a good one!"
