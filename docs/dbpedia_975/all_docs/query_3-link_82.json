        "text": "Jesus said, “Follow Me.”\n\nWhile these words were uttered to a select number of individuals over 2000 years ago, the invitation has echoed to men, women, and children ever since. Many have done just that! They have followed Him.\n\nHere at Upper Cross Roads, we too are followers of Jesus. We do not consider ourselves a religion or denominational offshoot. We are simply followers of Jesus. We are people who delight to be called by His Name. As such, we seek to know and obey His teachings, emulate His character, walk His path, fulfill His mission.\n\nWe live to exalt His Name among all peoples both here and around the world. Once they have come to know the salvation He offers, it is our passion to help them walk the path of a follower of Jesus from spiritual infancy to spiritual maturity. Each week we will seek to strengthen each other through Scripture study, passionate worship, practical and spiritual fellowship, and relevant ministry.\n\nWe warmly invite you to follow Him with us.\n\nABOUT UPPER CROSS ROADS\n\nWe are a family friendly, biblically conservative, evangelism oriented church incorporating a balanced emphasis of worship, fellowship, discipleship, Bible learning and outreach. Our goal is to impact Harford and Baltimore counties in Maryland with the grace of Jesus our Savior.\n\nWe currently run between 80 – 100 people for our Morning Worship Service. Our congregation uses a wide variety of Bible translations with the ESV being used currently in our Morning Worship Service. We love getting immersed into the Word with expositional preaching that is relevant & applicable to our lives today. Our worship music includes a blend of older & newer hymns as well as Biblically sound praise & worship songs.\n\nWe are an independent Baptist church and not affiliated with any denominational group. We are committed to a vibrant missions outreach. We presently help support 27 active missionaries and 8 retired/semi-retired missionaries. We also serve locally at a senior living community, Restoration Farm, and Baltimore Rescue Mission.\n\nThe Lord has blessed us with 14 acres of land and three buildings: a newly remodeled Sanctuary with classrooms in the lower level; a Parsonage; and a Family Life Center which contains our offices, gymnasium, kitchen, and classrooms.\n\nSUNDAY SERVICE TIMES\n\n• 9:45 AM Sunday School (locations vary by class)\n\n• 11:00 AM Morning Worship Service (in the Sanctuary)\n\n• 6:30 PM Evening Bible Study (in the Sanctuary)\n\nNEW PASTOR\n\nOn Sunday, June 4, 2023 the congregation voted on calling Brock Mawdesley to be the senior pastor. Brock Mawdesley formerly served as associate pastor at UCRBC from 2008-2019 and was most recently serving as pastor at Village Chapel Baptist Church in Weare, New Hampshire. Brock Mawdesley accepted the call to serve as senior pastor of Upper Cross Roads Baptist Church; we welcome the Mawdesley family back and look forward to Pastor Brock’s ministry!"
