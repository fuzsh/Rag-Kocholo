The center is named after the long-time Baltimore City Councilperson from the 3rd District until her retirement in 1999. She served as a member of the Coldstream-Homestead-Montebello Community Board and was often called the “Mayor of Coldstream-Homestead Montebello.”\n\nIn the first of two major construction phases, the sparkling new center converted an existing pavilion sitting atop a historic 1920s pool bathhouse. At a $3.1 million cost, the first phase built a gorgeous main center with a community room, computer lab, fitness and locker rooms, game room, kitchen, and arts & crafts room. The center can host a workout group such as yoga, a cooking class or reception, special events like birthday parties or classes, and computer training.\n\nThe back of the center overlooks the Clifton Park pool. It will be adjoined by an 11,500-square-foot new gymnasium with restrooms, concession stands, and capacity for special events, recreational activities such as basketball, volleyball, indoor soccer leagues, etc., and larger community meetings. This second phase will cost around $3 million and is currently in the design stage.\n\n“Our goal is to transition the city's aging recreation centers into a new network of high-quality community centers in order to better serve Baltimore's communities,\" Mayor Rawlings-Blake said at the dedication. \"The Councilwoman Rita R. Church Community Center is an example of Baltimore's new recreation center model-and a direct result of the city's investment in expanded staff and programming, such as camps and afterschool programs.”\n\nArtist’s rendering of the complete Rita Church Community Center with a new gym to the right."
