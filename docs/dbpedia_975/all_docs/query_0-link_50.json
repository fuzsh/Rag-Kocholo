Jay would always berate me with \"MORE BASS Cook\".\n\n\"I spent my summers in Cape May and joined up with great guys from South Philly, The Chip Bond Band, and played from Ocean City NJ, Wildwood and we had our own teen grotto in Cape May. After that went to UVA and got a chance to play with the traveling R&B bands (black) who played all over the South...what A KICK! and learned most of what I know... which now isn't much but I still play. My son Tommy in CA went on to become an excellent R&R drummer and still plays.\"\n\n\"One of my memories of the early Admirals was getting pennies thrown at us which bounced off my cymbals... a real thrill :( \"\n\nThe Admirals performing a 1964 dance at Poly.\n\nWith help from my Facebook friends, pictured are Tom Berry (bass), Wilbur McLamb (vocals), Eddie Bladis (drums), Jay Stermer (organ)...

Donna had worked previously for Music Men Entertainment prior to starting her own agency.\n\nDonna relates that \"Allegro was a licensed and bonded entertainment agency started in 1988. I was sole proprietor with no employees, except for some help at one time from none other then Marylou Magee (Marylou & the Untouchables).\n\nBeing a small business, I was able to charge (an inexpensive) flat commission rate... The bands liked it, we all made out. I booked lots of weddings and hall parties, Millersville Inn, Brass Rail Pub, Purple Moose Saloon, Poncabird Pub, Feathers at the Red Rooster, Midway Cafe, to name a few. Among my personal favorite groups were Rumors (of course), Hanzoff, Archer, Signals, Laughing Colors, Layers, Detour. I closed the agency in 1994.\"\n\nConcurrently in 1992 Donna started a DJ and karaoke service called Nitelife Productions. She relates \"I was the DJ/KJ. I did this because I still wanted to sing, but stay in the 'neighborhood' so my friends and family could be in the audience frequently. I had to retire when my voice failed due to health issues.\" She sold the business in 2001.\n\nAdded 1/2013 courtesy of Donna Harris\n\n***************************\n\nAppaloosa\n\nSee bio in BS-2\n\nAppaloosa circa 1978.

They opened shows for many artists including Black Ivory at the Ambassador Ballroom on Liberty Heights Avenue, The Chi-lites, Curtis Mayfield, Frankie and the Spindles at the Embassy Room on Park Heights, Julius Brockington, and a host of other stars. At that time they were on their way, releasing a single \"Remember The Rain\" that was played locally on Baltimore radio stations. The group stayed together until 1974, and according to Ricky, like many other bands at that time, bad management was responsible for their breakup.\n\nCream Soda photo courtesy of Michael McDaniel\n\nRicky Ratliff, the only original member still in Baltimore, tells us that he \"now heads a band called Colur Blynd, who is a band you'll never forget.

They each shared a mutual passion for making music and melding a wide variety of musical sounds, cultures and genres. The band began writing original music that often featured elaborate harmonies, introspective lyrics and cleverly crafted musical arrangements. During the 1990's, drumfish performed throughout the Baltimore area and released two well received albums, \"drumfish\" (1997) and \"Rah's Zoo\" (1998). Many of their early songs were written during their college days living in a leaky mobile home they shared (affectionately called, \"The Chicken Shack\"). The band developed a significant following and began to attract the attention of various record labels as they began performing throughout the United States and Canada (occasionally with bassist, Ken Kauffman).\n\nFollowing the recording of a third album, \"Under Underhill\" in 2000, the band parted ways due to uncontrollable circumstances and the album was shelved. However, interest in the band continued through the years. In 2009, the band reunited to finally release \"Underhill\" and prepare for a reunion concert at Jammin' Java (in Virginia). During this time, they also began writing new music. The material the band wrote during this period was fresh and invigorating. The band realized that after their long hiatus, they were now writing at a new level and doing their best work yet. More than that, there was an underlying message emerging from this new music, a message carrying a call to action for needed change in the world. The new work was filled with images of light and life.\n\ndrumfish circa 2012\n\nIn early 2010, the band recorded this exciting new music at Assembly Line Studios near Washington, DC with double-platinum award winning and Grammy winning engineer, Kevin \"131\" Gutierrez. During this time, founding member Neil Richardson left the band and was replaced by James Hanford (bass). The resulting album was entitled, \"Memoirs\" which earned the band several song-writing awards and industry recognition. During 2011-2012, the band expanded their sound with the addition of violin player, Margie Lang-Garnhart, and welcomed a new bass player, Graham Drew. In May 2012, the band filmed and recorded their first ever live album, \"FIVE LIVE\" at the State Theatre in Falls Church, Virginia. The band continues to record and perform in the area with recent notable appearances at the 2012 Baltimore Sail-a-bration event and Artscape festival.

I built a theremin, which I played on various parts of my body during the solo section of an Emerson, Lake & Palmer medley. I had installed a magician's \"fingertip flashpot\" inside the theremin, with a trigger so that I could shoot a ball of fire into the air at the end of my \"solo.\" One night I took to the dance floor among the teenagers, did my solo, and then watched in horror as the ball of flame shot out at a downward angle (due to over-packing the flash paper) and went straight for a dancer's head. Fortunately, he ducked in the nick of time and I was spared embarrassment and a possible lawsuit.\n\nThe end of my theremin story is that Vivian Rudow, a noted Baltimore composer, placed an advertisement in the newspaper seeking a theremin. In responding to her ad, I found that she was composing a piece for bassoon and theremin, wherein the bassoonist played the theremin with his feet at the same time he played the bassoon. I built her a theremin, after which she told me that I should get out of music and into electronics, where I could make more money and be a lot less miserable. I can't help thinking that I've done the right thing in ignoring her advice. I may not be rich, but I sure ain't miserable.\"\n\n-Rick\n\nP.S. I still haven't been able to persuade our producer to let me do a flame-throwing theremin solo on the Tab Choir broadcast.\n\nRichard Elliott\n\nOrganist, Mormon Tabernacle, Salt Lake City\n\nThanks to University of Iowa blog\n\nAdded 3/2016\n\n***************************\n\nElusion 1974-80\n\nR&B cover band.

The Epics and The Eppics in the book were completely different groups than this Belair-Edison area Epics whose origin predated both groups. As related by Chuck, \"Inspired by the Beatles like so many at that time, we were three cousins (Jimmy Michael, Chuck Stenley, and Ray Maxwell) that started in the summer of 1964 as a trio vocal group calling ourselves the Bel-Aires because we grew up around Belair Road and Erdman Ave. Our first performance was at the old \"Skateland\" roller rink in Highlandtown. We were very nervous and probably not so good, but one of our relatives owned the place, so no worries.\"\n\n\"By late summer we added a 4th member, friend (Tony Zubrowski), and started playing instruments. Ironically one guitar player (Ray) was left-handed like Paul McCartney. We thought that was a sign. At that time we called ourselves \"The Countdowns\". That name is in (the) book. We played various small parties, once in Rock State Park and once on the \"Lady Baltimore\" out of the Inner Harbor. As well as about a million auditions.\"\n\n\"By early 1965 we added a part time lead singer (Ed Lauer) and changed the name again to \"The Epics\". Ed's Son (Ed Lauer, Jr.) is playing music today in Fells Point. As the Epics we played various Frat parties and a stint on the infamous \"Block\" at Harry's Corral. We actually opened for Tommy Vann and the Echoes at one of their gigs in the Steel Workers Hall. We were actually one of the first bands to play at the new teenage night club \"The Zoo\" which is mentioned in (the) book. What a thrill that was to hear our name mentioned on the radio as one of the featured bands! We spent some time at the Holabird Inn across from Fort Holabird. Another highlight was while playing at the Green Door on Greenmount Avenue we had the pleasure of having Ronnie Dove sing a song with us.\"\n\nThe Epics in the 1960's\n\n\"We went on a hiatus for a period between 1967 until 1971 while Tony and Ray were in the service during the Vietnam War. We picked back up when they returned.\"\n\n\"We finally landed a house band gig at Nick's Musical Bar on Eastern Ave in Highlandtown. Great guy to work for. We were one of the bands on a float (actually a flatbed tractor trailer truck) that played during the dedication of the new \"Utz Twardowicz\" field in Patterson Park.\"\n\n\"From Nick's, we moved on to be the house band at another local bar at Eastern and Mace Avenue in Essex. At that time it was called \"The Lighthouse\". Later known as \"Troys\" and the last I saw it was called \"Legends.\"\n\nThe Epics in the 1970's\n\n\"We stuck around for a time in the '70s adding some additional family members. Eventually we all kind of moved on. A couple of the original members have passed and some are now living out of state. A couple of years ago the last three remaining original members got together and played some of our old songs. We were at it for over 10 hours straight. Best time ever!\"\n\nAn Epic reunion!\n\n\"As far as members and their participation here is the list I came up with. Like many of the local bands of that era, we brought in a few people from time to time from other bands to fill in or try out to see if they were a good fit. Way too many to list, but here are the most notable members:\n\nThe Epics original members:\n\nJimmy Michael - Drums / Vocals\n\nChuck Stenley - Lead Guitar / Vocals\n\nRay Maxwell - Rhythm / Bass / Vocals\n\nTony Zubrowski - Bass / Rhythm / Vocals\n\nLater Additions:\n\nEd Lauer, Sr. - Rhythm / Vocals\n\nGary Zubrowski - Bass\n\nJohn Stenley - Bass\n\nDiane Stenley - Vocals\n\nMarylyn Petro - Keyboard / Vocals\n\nEd Berry - Keyboard / Vocals\n\n\"Our musical adventure was a great inspiration to all of our families. Ray is still playing his guitar, Tony is a big part of his church's band. My late brother was also a member of our band and we are working on piecing together some of his original music that we found after he passed. My children spent countless hours listening to 45's and then scribing the words so we did not have to buy the song sheets and still listen to music all the time. My son had his own High School band using some of our old band equipment and is still playing today. His two girls can play guitar. My grandson is an accomplished pianist and music teacher in one of our local High Schools. Various nieces and nephews also caught the music bug. I could go on, but there is not enough time. I like to think \"The Epics\" had a small part of all of this. Thank you for putting the book together. It brought back a lot of memories and revived the musician in me.\"\n\nArticle courtesy of Chuck Stenley - June 10, 2022.\n\n***************************\n\nEpics '60s / '00s\n\nSee bio in BS2.

Fate won a Rafael Alvarez sponsored battle of the bands at Oddfellow's Hall on April 2, 1982. Their song \"Days of Olde\" (written by Libkey) was featured on the WKTK Maryland Music '81 album. The group released a single in 1983 through LGM Enterprises on their ETAF label: \"Face the Flash\" (Libkey/Schirmer) b/w \"Cry Out\" (Hubbard/Libkey).\n\nBill Libkey recalls the group as \"myself on guitar, Jim Arbutus on bass, Dave Hubbard on keyboard, Steve Brown on drums, and Mark Wolf on rhythm guitar. We had several lead singers but the one on the 45 was Jeff Schirmer.\" Guitarist RJ Everett joined the group much later in 1985.\n\n\"I believe Jeff is playing with a metal band now.\" [ed. notes - after Fate Jeff went on to join rock band Kuta, and is currently lead singer for metal band Race The Rat.]\n\n\"It was tough getting gigs in 1982 playing all originals and not really having any connections around the bar circuit. We would sometimes do an opening set for friends bands around town. We did get a show at the City Fair. I think that was '82-83. By 1984 the band started to fall apart. Jimmy Arbutus and I sold all the P.A. equipment and bought a 8 track tape machine. We had a room upstairs at the Polish National Alliance club on Fleet and Eastern Avenue. It was an old catholic school and we built a studio inside the room.\"\n\nFate at a Patterson Park concert\n\n\"RJ came into the group in 1985. He did a lot of recording with us but we never got a chance to play out.\"\n\n\"I guess one of the biggest accomplishments was winning the Sun Papers first unknown band contest. We continued to write and record for another couple years and then life got in the way. In 2011 I retired and moved to Lewes, DE.

They sang as group for over 60 years. Even though some of the group members changed there were three members that stayed throughout their performing years, going back into the 1940s. Those members were my father, George Collins, Mr. Irvin Church and Mr. Donald Jones. They are all deceased now, but for many years they had a regular gospel hour on WBOC Radio in Salisbury, Maryland that aired at 10:00 a.m. every Sunday morning. They recorded several songs in a recording studio in Baltimore.\"\n\n\"At one point in the early and mid 1940s my father sang with the Harmonizing Four from Richmond, Virginia. When he was with them the group members were Gospel Joe, Tommy Johnson, Lonnie Smith and Jimmy Jones. When Jimmy Jones (bass singer) embarked on a solo career he was replaced by Tommy Johnson's son Ellis Johnson. When confronted with the rigors of being on the road with the group and being away from his family or being home, he opted for family, but continued singing locally.\"\n\nSee BS2 for photo of their Ru-Jac 45\n\n- Added 8-21-13\n\n***************************\n\nFrustrations 65-66\n\nThe Frustrations were formed by guitarist Mike Janos \"and fellow Calvert Hall classmate Pat Gill who managed the band and booked all our gigs.

Bert Schwartz on keyboards, Dennis Kravitz on bass, the absolute extraordinary David Greenberg on drums, Kenny Caplan on that stunning Fender strat, Teddy Okum on saxophones, alto as I remember, and me, Carl Lazerow on a '66 A-21 Bach Strad brass trumpet. Our manager was Neil Kravitz. Teddy's father owned the Trading Post on Baltimore Street across the street from the Civic Center, now Baltimore Arena or something like that. He connected us with a group of African American singers (at first Leroy, Jerry, and Cubby? maybe) and dancers.\n\nThe lights, the costume, and tuxedo changes, smoke, white gloves, and black lights. Punk teenagers all of us. Our friendly competitors were The Startones, Fred Smith, Mark Seigmeister, that crowd. Both bands were big in the Bar and Bat Mitzvah scene, sweet 16's, battles of the bands, these in Northwest Baltimore. And we were exposed as teenagers, oh our poor parents, to, among other similar venues in the City, starting with Petacvh Tikvah in Upper Northwest and wedding on Gay Street that included weed, big deal right, and needles, Ya, what did this nebish kid just witness?????\n\nSam and Dave, the Four Tops, Martha Reeves and the Vandellas, the Chambers Brothers and SleepWalk. Jimi Hendrix and acid rock, the Beatles and Stones surfaced with the British Invasion and we were headed to high school graduation and college, and disperse we did. But the love of music never left.\n\nThe Fugitives also made an appearance on The Kerby Scott Show.\n\nFast Forward to 2022. The Baltimore residents, Caplan, Greenberg, and Lazerow, with an assist from Fred Smith, meet regularly around a round table, hence it's a meeting of the King and his Roundtable. Greenberg (on dobro), Caplan (on rhythm guitar}, Lazerow, (on mandolin, dobro, ukulele, banjolele, and a Bazouki (google it). The others are welcome to join. We will be known as \"Strings For Her\", and the goal is to play for Jewish Day School students, for free.\n\n- Thanks Carl Lazarow - June 2022.\n\n***************************\n\nFurniture Falling Down the Stairs 91-95\n\nFurniture Falling Down the Stairs was Rupert Wondolowski on vocals and rhythm guitar, Aaron Roth on bass, Angus on lead guitar, Pope Croke on keyboards and saxophone, John Dierker on saxophone and clarinet, Scott Larson on accordion and guitar, and Batworth on drums.

Thank you Jay!\n\nLiner notes:\n\n\"It was a time\" - P. Daly German\n\nDuring the (Keith) Moonian finale of a 1972 concert by Grok on Korvette's parking lot in Towson, MD., this audient witnessed the band's locomotive drummer hurl his Roger's drums into the 4' of standing water of an above-ground display pool. Equally surprising was their immediate retrieval by loyal roadies Jim Fallows and Ginny Kaufman. Now THIS was roack and roll.\n\nNo one could then have predicted that the following February, this this same audient would ride a freight elevator as Grok's singer and 2nd guitarist with his bandmates"
