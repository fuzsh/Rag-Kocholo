        "text": "Our Beginnings\n\nIn 1970 the Baltimore Orioles had just beaten the Cincinnati Reds in the World Series. The Orioles team Chaplain, the great Msgr. Marty Schwalenberg, was thrilled… but he had a problem. He needed advertisers for his parish bulletin at St. Charles in Pikesville. He called on one of his favorite parishioners, “super salesman” Phil Maher, Sr. During one very enjoyable dinner discussion Msgr. Schwalenberg’s problem was solved and FATA was effectively born.\n\nPhil Sr. decided to name his new company by describing exactly what it provided...Financial Assistance Through Advertising. Officially incorporated as FATA, Inc. the company quickly grew and began to specialize in providing weekly church bulletins. Since it’s founding FATA has provided personalized, quality publishing and advertising services to churches throughout the mid-Atlantic area. In addition, FATA works with many other types of organizations to assist them with their publishing needs...from schools, universities, hospitals, community groups, business associations and more. The one constant has been FATA’s dedication to serving the needs of their publishing partners in anyway possible. The single most important guiding principle passed down to current President Phil Jr. from Phil Sr. continues to be as simple as it is successful…SERVICE…SERVICE…SERVICE. We’d be pleased to hear from you if you would like to discuss how we may help you with any of your printing and publishing needs.\n\nFATA….Experts in:\n\nChurch Bulletins\n\nCommunity Newsletters and Directories\n\nParish Welcome folders\n\nSenior Center Newsletters\n\nSchool Directories/Handbooks\n\nAnniversary and Commemorative event programs\n\nSports programs"
