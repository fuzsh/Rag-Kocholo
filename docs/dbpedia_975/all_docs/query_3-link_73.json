        "text": "Jubilees are referenced in the Old Testament as a Year of Great Anniversary Celebration.\n\n“For it is a Jubilee; it shall be holy to you.”\n\nfrom the book of Leviticus\n\nIt is indeed a rarity to reach a 200th birthday. In fact, it is almost unheard of. That is why we, Clergy, and members of THE HISTORIC ST. JAMES EPISCOPAL CHURCH, cannot contain our excitement. Our 200th Anniversary Jubilee Year officially begins January 1, 2024, and will last throughout the year.\n\nThanks to parishioner Phyllis L. Chandler’s research, and her publication of Heritage of Hope & Sacrifice, St. James’ earliest history has been preserved. Thus, her research documents that the 200th Anniversary milestone would not be possible but for the vision, wisdom, sacrifice, perseverance, and unerring Christian faith of 31-year-old Reverend William Levington, a free black man.\n\nAt age 31, Levington arrived in Baltimore City penniless, but with a vision to establish and build an Episcopal congregation and a school for free and bonded, or enslaved, blacks. It would become the 1st such Episcopal congregation below the “Mason-Dixon Line”. In 1824, without any personal income, he began daily religious services and a day school in a store front located on Saratoga Street. During periods of extreme personal sacrifice and poverty, Levington raised the needed funds to construct a new church building.\n\nLevington’s legacy of toil and sacrifice has become the cornerstone of the success of the St. James’ congregation. While the church has occupied three sites since that first building, the school established by Levington continued for 40 years. His legacy has produced more than 50 sons and daughters of St. James as Deacons, Priests, Bishops, and now the Presiding Bishop.\n\nOur yearlong celebration began on Sunday January 7 with the powerful and inspiring preaching of The Rev. Canon Stephanie Spellers, Presiding Bishop Curry’s Canon for Evangelism and Reconciliation. During Black History Month, The Best of Duke Ellington’s Sacred Music Concerts was held led by well-known musician, Dr. John Lamkin with guest artists and The Baltimore City College Choir directed by Marcus Smith. Fabulous! St. James hosted a Worshiping as One: The Four Historically Black Parishes of Baltimore. We came together to acknowledge and honor the history of each church. Palm Sunday was sheer joy with The Community Concert Choir of Baltimore led by founder and director Marco Merrick presenting “Hosanna in the Highest”. Next Up is Jubilee Weekend! Let the celebration continue!!\n\nEnter, Engage, Embrace in this Remarkable Journey of 200 years!\n\nAnniversary Chairs: Elise Jude Mason and Charles W. Cephas, Jr."
