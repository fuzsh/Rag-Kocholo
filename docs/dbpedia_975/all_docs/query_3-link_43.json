        "text": "St. Joseph's Catholic Church Cemetery is located in Cockeysville, Baltimore County, Maryland, The area is actually called Texas, Maryland and is just to the east, on the access road to a large quarry that is now owned by Genstar. The cemetery is located just to the rear of a shopping center and just to the side and rear of the church. The oldest section of the cemetery is located just to the rear of the church. The cemetery is still in use today, although it appears to be about 85% full.\n\nThe cemetery was read and imaged in May 2005. The database and associated images are the copyrighted work of William E. Wilson, Jr. who generously supplied them to the Allen County Public Library for distribution to individual genealogical researchers."
