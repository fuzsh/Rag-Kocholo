The mission of the Feeding Fellowship ministry is to host events that: provide physical and spiritual nourishment; gather people together to form and build bonds of friendship; strengthen our faith; and continue a legacy of service to the wider community.\n\nWe continue to review how we are able to host receptions and events."
