Our creed is ancient and our theology is progressive. We are seekers, believers, doubters, questioners, learners who believe that faith is a journey, not an event. We proclaim a Gospel of love that includes all people and we seek to serve the world in the name of the one who dined with sinners, called tax collectors into leadership, and showed a preference for the poor and oppressed."
