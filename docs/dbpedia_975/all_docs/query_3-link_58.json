        "text": "At Empowered Church Ministries, we are committed to sharing the good news of the Gospel of Jesus Christ and making disciples. Through loving and serving, we endeavor to live our lives as examples of God's grace and love. When you join us for worship, you can expect to engage with a church family that will encourage and equip you to grow in your faith. From the youngest to the oldest, there is a place for you here!\n\n\"Then Jesus came to them and said, “All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age.” -Matthew 28:18-20\n\nAbsolutely! Our church would love to pray for you. If you are in need of prayer, click on the \"Request Prayer\" button in the bottom right corner of the website. Here, you have the choice to keep your request private, only for our pastors, or to be made public to the church- so that more may pray for your need. If you are looking for a church to call home, we hope you will join us at Empowered Church Ministries!\n\n\"Do not be anxious about anything, but in every situation, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God. And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.\" -Philippians 4:6-7\n\nIf you would like to give in support of the church, you can do so quickly and securely from right here on our website! When you click on the Giving page, you will be directed to our convenient donation through CashApp and/or Zelle.\n\nIf you would rather give with a physical check, stop by the church at 433B East Patapsco Avenue Baltimore, MD 21225 or send us a message today for more information.\n\n\"Bring the whole tithe into the storehouse, that there may be food in my house. Test me in this,” says the Lord Almighty, “and see if I will not throw open the floodgates of heaven and pour out so much blessing that there will not be room enough to store it.\" -Malachi 3:10\n\nWe are here to answer your questions! If you would like to send us a direct message, feel free to use the convenient contact form found under the \"Contact Us\" tab. This message will go directly to our pastor, and we will get back in touch with you as soon as possible! If you would prefer to give us a call, our church is available by phone at (443) 312-8455. We look forward to hearing from you!"
