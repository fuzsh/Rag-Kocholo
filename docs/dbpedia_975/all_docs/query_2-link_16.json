        "meta_description": "The church of St James is located in the coastal village of Manorbier in South Pembrokeshire. It sits within its ancient circular churchyard on a steep slope overlooking the sea to the west and Manorbier castle to the north. The castle was the birthplace of Gerald of Wales (Giraldus Cambrensis) and the church still houses an effigy of a de Barri (Gerald’s family name). It had an early connection with the nearby Benedictine Monkton Priory (now the Church of Saints Nicholas & John) who supplied its first rector, Prior Richard, in 1251. \n\nThe church consists of a south porch, nave, aisles, transepts, chancel and north tower. It is remarkable for having barrel vaulting throughout most of the interior. The oldest part is the 12C nave, which was barrel-vaulted and lengthened in the 13C. The mis-aligned chancel was rebuilt and the transepts added in the 14C. The narrow north transept was lengthened and given a barrel vault with a wide squint to the south in the 14C. The aisles were both added in the 15C. The north aisle is unusual in that it is almost the same size as the nave and now houses the 15C rood loft, moved there in the 19C. The porch with its painted ceiling was added in the late 15C. The chancel was given an arch-braced roof in the 19C and the north transept converted to a chapel in the 20C.\n\nSt James is mostly built from local limestone rubble masonry with some local sandstone in the tower and slate roofs with parapets. Several blocked doorways on the exterior of the building indicate the ground level has risen considerably since the medieval period, possibly by 1 or 2 metres. Further up the hill to the south of the church on the site of Church Hill Cottage is structural evidence of perhaps 5 buildings. It is thought these buildings are (or incorporate remains of) a grange established after Sir John de Barri granted the church to the Priory of Monkton in 1301. Internally, Church Hill Cottage has a barrel-vaulted ceiling, possibly contemporary with the church and was used as a school in the 19C. The Ordnance Survey map of 1860 clearly shows a school and vicarage on the site. \n\nMain references: Pevsner Buildings of Wales - Pembrokeshire and the list descriptions at the bottom of this page.",

        "text": "The wider area has been settled since prehistoric times as evidenced by the Neolithic chambered tomb (known as the King’s Quoit) on the nearby coast path, although the present day landscape is one almost wholly shaped by medieval territorial organisation, settlements and land use.\n\nThe Church of St James at Manorbier dates from the C12. Gerald of Wales (Giraldus Cambrensis), of the de Barri family of nearby Manorbier Castle, recounts how he took refuge there in 1153. The earliest surviving part of the building is the nave from this period. The Church had an early connection with the Benedictines of Monkton, and a Prior of Monkton, Master Richard, was its first recorded Rector in 1251. The original building was greatly enlarged during the next hundred years with a rebuilt chancel and transepts and a new tower, aisles and porch. The north aisle is almost equal in height and width to the nave and is virtually a second nave and may have functioned as the Parish Church while the main nave and the chancel were still in exclusive conventual use. Mediaeval ceiling paintings survive in the porch.\n\nIn 1301 Sir John de Barri granted the church to Monkton Priory. However, as an alien house, Monkton lost the advowson and the Rectorial land and tithes during the Hundred Years War with France. With the Dissolution the whole church became the Parish Church in Manorbier. It is not clear at what date the north wall of the nave was pierced to form an arcade of low arches similar to, but not aligned with, those formed in the south wall when the south aisle was added. The Rood figures were removed in 1707 and replaced by the Royal Arms of King William, painted on boards. These are now repositioned on the north wall, to which they were moved during the major restoration by Frederick Wehnert in 1865-8. The restoration also saw the Rood Loft moved to the north aisle and a large chancel arch formed in place of the low, narrow Norman one. Perpendicular tracery was removed from the east window in favour of the trefoil-headed lancets, more in keeping with Victorian preference. The church interior was replastered throughout and the vaults in the tower were pierced in 1920 for the re-installation of a bell.\n\nMain reference: Cadw list description.\n\nThe Church of St James consists of a nave with adjacent north and south aisles, north & south transcepts, misaligned chancel and south porch. The tower and vestry are attached to the north wall of the chancel. The whole presents an irregular grouping dominated by the two masses of the tower and the north aisle linked by the stepping-down projection of the north transept and the chapel. Generally, built from local limestone rubble masonry with some local sandstone, as in the tower. Slate roofs with gable parapets and finial crosses with a bellcote at the east end of the north aisle. Slender tower of local type, with four storeys and crenellated parapet on corbels, but without the usual stair turret. Three large belfry lights with stone louvres to north (towards village), single lights to the east and west and none towards the south Lancet at ground storey facing north. A blocked west door in the nave nave with equilateral arch formed to two large curved stones. The blocked door of the north aisle also an equilateral arch but formed of voussoirs. The very low height of these archways shows the outside ground level has risen considerably (1-2 m).\n\nReference: Cadw list description.\n\nNave approximately 12.5 m by 5.5 m wide with a high pointed vault. Although pointed its Norman character is indicated by a surviving high-level round-headed window in the S side, partly blocked by an arch of the subsequently formed S arcade. The original chancel arch was low and narrow and the present arch, though larger, imitates the squat, low-springing form of the nave arcades. Above it, seen from the nave, are several Rood-Loft corbels and a high level ladder hook.\n\nChancel 5.5 m by 5 m, built c.1250 on older foundations. Its axis is markedly inclined to the right relative to the nave (compare Castlemartin Church). A C14 de Barri effigy repositioned on the N side. Door to adjacent vestry. Arch to tower. A blocked Priest?s door in the S wall. C19 sedilia. E window of 3 lancets. The N and S transepts added c.1250. The S Transept now contains the organ. The N transept has a high level window in the gable, now converted to 2 lights. The Tower was added in the angel between the N transept and the chancel. It is small in area, 4.6 m square internally, and may not originally have been intended to be so high. Its entrance is by a loft-level doorway in the N transept.\n\nThe N aisle is 18.5 m by 4.5 m. The external doorway in the N wall is blocked. A door seen internally in the N wall leads to stairs in the wall thickness leading to the resited Rood-Loft and indirectly to the tower. A carved label mould terminal of this doorway is of a style dated to the C13. There are traces of red and blue paint on the Rood-Loft timbers.The chantry chapel, which is an extension of the N transept, originally housed the de Barri effigy which is taken to be John de Barri, d.1324. This chapel is unusually roofed with vaulting on close set thick transverse ribs. In 1960 this part was formed into a Memorial Chapel with a new timber screen.\n\nS aisle 16 m by 2 m, also vaulted but beneath a lean-to roof. A wide squint between the S transept and the nave enables the altar to be seen from the S entrance door. Water-stoup recess beside porch door. Porch at S with a high vault, with surviving mediaeval paintings in floral patterns within panels. The church has 2 fonts, one small and octagonal, on a modern base. The other a font of Norman type, presently in use. This has been re-tooled overall in modern times. At rear of nave are 2 blocks of pews probably predating the re-pewing of c.1865. In the N aisle is a Celtic-cross war memorial.\n\nReference: Cadw list description."
