        "text": "\"Community\" is in Our Name\n\nOpen Hearts, Open Minds, Open Doors\n\nâCommunityâ is in our name\n\nFaith Community United Methodist Church has served the Hamilton and neighboring communities for quite some time. Many use our building for meetings, events, and support. Although we know âchurchâ is more than a building, we also recognize that our walls are just as important to our work. Our walls provide multiple opportunities for our multiple ministries. Other than Sunday service, we are blessed to house Boy and Girl Scout troops, a food pantry, Back-to-School block parties, Trunk-or-Treat, and more. We also reach out beyond 5315 Harford to participate in festivals (like having a childrenâs craft corner at the Hamilton Festival,) and partner with a school (Garrett Heights Elementary and Middle). Serving the community is what we do. âCommunityâ is in our name. Being able to provide for our community is who we are. Our members wouldnât have it any other way.\n\nOur Values & Mission\n\nOur Vision: We are ever growing in Christ, inviting each one to make a difference.\n\nChurch Calendar\n\nFaith Community UMC - History"
