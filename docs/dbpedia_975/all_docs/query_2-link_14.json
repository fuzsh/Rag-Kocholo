        "text": "Many families hear of St. James due to our reputation for academic excellence grounded by Episcopal traditions and values. Specifically, we believe a strong education is as much about expanding a student’s mind as it is about enriching one’s heart and nourishing one’s spirit.\n\nAt St. James, we champion curiosity, emphasize kindness, and encourage self-expression. Through this, we’ve created a nurturing environment where families form lasting bonds and students develop lifelong values alongside real-world skills.\n\nI am privileged to be Head of School and honored to be part of an Episcopal tradition that emphasizes the balance of knowledge, spiritual reflection, and an inclusive community. Drawing from my time in the classroom, on the sidelines, and as an administrator, I am committed to ensuring that we remain a school where everyone is welcome and where children from preschool through middle school can gain a love of learning while preparing for success in their lives ahead.\n\nAt St. James, we are a community that’s passionate about teaching and caring for our students. From our faculty to our board, administrators, parish Rector, alumni, parents, and students, we believe in the power of our mission. I look forward to sharing the St. James experience with you, as I believe our school can be a deeply meaningful experience for your child in the years ahead."
