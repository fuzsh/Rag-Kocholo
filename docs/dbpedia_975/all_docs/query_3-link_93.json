        "text": "We believe in the one God, and within the one essence of the Godhead, co-exists three persons, The Father, The Son and The Holy Spirit, Who are co-equal and co-eternal (Gen. 1:1; Matt. 28:19-20; Acts 5:3-4; Col. 1:13-16; 2:9; Heb. 1:1-3).\n\nWe believe in the accurate account of the entire narrative of Genesis, including Godâ€™s creation of the material universe in six literal days, a literal Adam and Eve as the parents of all mankind, a literal fall into sin and a universal flood (Exodus 20:9-11; Romans 5:12; II Peter 2:5).\n\nWe believe in the virgin birth of Jesus Christ, His bodily resurrection and ascension into Heaven and His present life there for us as High Priest and Advocate (Matt. 1:20-23; II Cor. 5:21; I Cor. 15:3-4; Acts 1:9; Romans 8:34).\n\nWe believe that God created sinless, spiritual beings to worship and serve Him (Colossians 1:16; Isaiah 6:3; Hebrews 1:14).\n\nWe believe that Satan and some of the angels became proud and were judged by God, and that Satan now rules those fallen angels called demons (I Timothy 3:6; Matt. 25:41; Eph. 6:11-12; II Cor. 4:4; II Peter 2:4)\n\nWe believe that The Lord Jesus Christ died for our sins as a vicarious, substituted sacrifice, and that all who believe in Him are justified on the basis of His shed blood, and are born of The Holy Spirit and thereby become the children of God (Romans 5:8-9; I Cor. 15:3; II Cor. 5:21; Romans 3:24-26; John 1:12; John 3:3-6).\n\nWe believe those born again by The Spirit of God have eternal life and can never lose their salvation (John 10:27-30; Romans 5:1-11; Romans 8:28-39; I John 5:11-13).\n\nWe believe the church is an elect company of believers baptized by The Holy Spirit into one body; its mission is to build and oversee a righteous kingdom of God, bear witness to Jesus Christ, and preach the Gospel among all nations (Acts 1:8; I Corinthians 12:13; Ephesians 1:3-4).\n\nWe believe the Christian is not under the Law but that the grace of God is sufficient for the maintenance of a life of obedience to the Word of God (John 14:15; Romans 6:14; II Peter 3:18).\n\nWe believe that The Holy Spirit indwells, seals, and gives spiritual gifts to every believer; and that He guides, fills, teaches and enables every believer to do the will of God as the believer trusts and obeys The Spirit (Romans 8:9; I Corinthians 112:7-11; Galatians 5:16-18; Ephesians 4:30; 5:18; I John 2:27).\n\nWe believe the sign gifts of The Holy Spirit, such as speaking in tongues and the gift of healing, were temporary and that speaking in tongues was never the common or necessary sign of the baptism or the filling of The Holy Spirit (I Corinthians 14: 1-40; Ephesians 2:20; Hebrews 2:3-4).\n\nWe believe that the ultimate deliverance of the body from sickness or death awaits the consummation of our salvation in the resurrection (I Cor. 15:50-54; II Corinthians 12:7-10).I believe that God frequently chooses to answer the prayer of believers for physical healing (James 5:14-18).\n\nWe believe the order of the end time events will be as follows: a) the personal, physical return of Jesus Christ to rapture the Church; b) the seven-year tribulation period; c) the personal, visible return of Jesus Christ to the earth to establish His earthly kingdom which will last for 1,000 years; d) the final judgment and the eternal state (I Thess. 4:13-18; Dan. 9:24-27; I Thess. 5:9; Rev. 3:10; Matt. 24:5-21; Rev. 6:1-19, 21; Isa. 11:1-20; Rev. 29:11-21, 20:1-3, 11-15, 21:1-22:5).\n\nWe believe in the bodily resurrection of the just and the unjust, the everlasting blessedness of the saved, and the everlasting punishment of the lost (Dan. 12:1-2; Rev. 21:1-22:5; I Thess. 4:17; I Cor. 15:20-58; Matt: 25:41-46; John 5:28-29; Rev. 20:11-15)."
