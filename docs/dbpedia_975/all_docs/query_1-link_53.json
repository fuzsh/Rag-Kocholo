        "text": "Working From the Inside Out\n\nDear Friends in Christ,\n\nAs we approach Labor Day, which is considered the unofficial end to summer, I hope you have had some time these past few months to rest from your labors. How blessed we are to live in the United States of America. From our healthcare, to education, and access to employment, the opportunities provided to become successful- at least in the eyes of the world- are so much greater than most any other country has to offer. But we shouldn’t take what we enjoy for granted. The political philosopher, Edmund Burke, writing in 1791 to a fellow member of the English parliament, observed that the success or failure of a free society hinges on a moral order. Having witnessed the ravages of the anti-Catholic driven French Revolution, and the fledgling American experiment, he wrote, “Society cannot exist unless a controlling power upon will and appetite be placed somewhere; and the less of it there is within, the more there must be without. It is ordained in the eternal constitution of things, that men of intemperate minds cannot be free. Their passions forge their fetters.”\n\nEdmund Burke was essentially re-stating Jesus’ admonition to the crowd in today’s Gospel from Mark Chapter 7 in which we read, “’Hear me, all of you, and understand. Nothing that enters one from the outside can defile that person; but the things that come from within are what defile. From within people, from their hearts, come evil thoughts, unchastity, theft, murder, adultery, greed, malice, deceit, licentiousness, envy, blasphemy, arrogance, folly. All these evils come from within and they defile.’” While the removal of prayer from our public schools and the Ten Commandments from public places might seem trivial, nature abhors a vacuum. If as a nation we have rejected our Judeo-Christians roots in exchange for total license to do whatever we want, then we shouldn’t be surprised that we find ourselves living under a tyranny of moral relativism.\n\nWhat is the way forward? I would like to suggest that we work from the inside out. By that I mean, that we strive to work harder at the interior life than we do at the exterior life. Let us open our hearts and minds to the truths of the faith and the light of the Holy Spirit. Where do I need healing, where do I need growth? Through striving to live the virtuous life, may we see the moral law of God not as a fetter to our freedom but the path to liberation. I encourage you take advantage of the Sacrament of Reconciliation and Eucharistic Adoration this coming Friday, the First Friday of September. If we work from the inside out, I am quite certain that we will not only see better fruit in our daily work, but we will also contribute to the right ordering of society, both as citizens of the State of Maryland, and one day, please God, of heaven.\n\nIn Christ,"
