        "text": "St. John’s Welcomes You\n\nWelcome to St John’s!\n\nWe seek to be a caring, Christ-centered community committed to growing together in discipleship and to reaching out in service, both locally and globally.\n\nWherever you are on your faith journey, we’re excited to welcome you to this open and inclusive community. At St. John’s, you will find opportunities to care and be cared for, to teach and learn, to become part of a community committed to sharing God’s love. Join us for fellowship, study, prayer, or worship, or simply visit our beautiful campus.\n\nOffering Support in Challenging Times\n\nAt St. John’s, we’re committed to being a parish that both supports its members and reaches beyond our walls to care for the world around us. Our clergy and Pastoral Care Commission provide support and spiritual guidance within our community. Meanwhile, our Mission Commission takes the lead in helping those most in need, whether in Maryland or far beyond.\n\nStewards of Local History\n\nSt. John’s has been one of the principal institutions in the Western Run Valley since the parish was founded in 1816. More than simply a place for Episcopalians, it has always been a spiritual and cultural center for the local community more broadly. That vitality is still seen here today at the Blessing of the Hounds, at weddings and funerals, in the people who seek out tranquility on our beautiful campus, at our Music in the Valley concerts, and in the various community groups that use our buildings. We’re grateful to those members of the broader community who show their support for this historic and living institution by giving to St. John’s, helping to ensure that we remain a center of valley life for years to come.\n\nThis Week’s Services\n\nAugust 11, 2024\n\nThe Twelfth Sunday after Pentecost\n\n8 a.m. at the Fountain and 10 a.m. in the Church\n\nSave the Date – Homecoming Sunday\n\nMark your calendars for our annual Homecoming Sunday on September ...\n\nRead More →\n\nPlayground Refresh\n\n2nd Annual Playground Clean-Up Day – August 25, 11:15 a.m. ...\n\nRead More →\n\nDinner and a Movie!\n\nThis Summer, St John’s invites everyone to three fun-filled ...\n\nRead More →\n\nSunday Services\n\n8:00 A.M.\n\nHoly Eucharist (Rite I)\n\n10:00 A.M.\n\nChoral Eucharist (Rite II)\n\nwith Children‘s Chapel and\n\nNursery Care\n\nLocation/Contact\n\n3738 Butler Rd.\n\nReisterstown, MD 21136\n\n410-429-4690\n\nSign Up for Updates\n\nFind Us on Social Media\n\n© 2024 St. John's Church, Western Run.
