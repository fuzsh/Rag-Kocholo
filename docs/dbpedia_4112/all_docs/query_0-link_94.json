        "text": "Obituary\n\nSusan Marie Paniak, 78, of Algonquin, passed away July 21, 2024, at Journey Care in Barrington after a long and patient battle with cancer.\n\nShe was born on March 13, 1946, to Marie and Charles Blaul in Chicago.\n\nOn July 22, 1972, Susan married her “darling” husband Bernie Paniak at St. William Church in Chicago. Their life together was faith-filled; one of caring and generosity. While living in Arlington Heights, Susan and Bernie, over a period, temporarily and lovingly cared for eleven newborn babies through Catholic Charities in Chicago.\n\nIn 1978, they made the decision to move to Algonquin with the prospect of St. Margaret Mary building a new church, this evacuating the current location in the basement of the school. They anticipated their son attending the school. This later resulted in Susan working with Fr. William McDonnell for fifteen years as a new church building secretary along with other positions.\n\nSusan also worked for twenty years as a front desk receptionist for Dr. James Massaro at Cary Grove Foot and Ankle Center.\n\nSusan was a loving, devoted and active member of St. Margaret Mary Parish in Algonquin from August of 1978 until this current year when her illness prevented her participation. She served as a President of the parish Altar and Rosary Society. With a seven-woman team, she presented the first “Christ Renews His Parish” retreat for parish women. She was a member of Lend-A-Heart, a Sunday Mass greeter, a Eucharistic Minister, and a liturgical reader. Susan also volunteered at the parish Resale Shop, helped with Meals on Wheels delivery and the Algonquin-LITH food pantry. She volunteered at PADS in Cary, and with a SMM team cooked and served for those in need at Vineyard Church in Elgin. She served for eight years as a Eucharistic visitation minister to the care facilities of Eastgate and Clarendale in Algonquin.\n\nOf primary importance to Susan was daily Mass attendance and Eucharistic Adoration with Bernie. She had a deep devotion to the Real Presence of Jesus in the Blessed Sacrament. It was sustenance in her family life, her work, ministries, and her final days.\n\nSusan was always deeply grateful for the support of her devoted husband, family, many friends, and the Franciscan Friars at St. Margaret Mary. Most recently that gratitude is extended to the staff and volunteers at Journey Care in Barrington.\n\nSusan is survived by her loving husband, Bernie, her beloved son, Ronald, treasured granddaughter, Maya Paniak; bonus grandsons, Lucas and Shane Wysocki; loved daughter-in-law Kelly; cherished sister, Cecelia (Dale Kostreva) of Crivitz, Wisconsin; many nieces, nephews and great little ones.\n\nShe was predeceased by brothers and sisters-in-law, Tom (Marianne Pick) and Jerry (Dixie William).\n\nVisitation will be at St. Margaret Mary Church on Thursday, July 25, 2024, for the hour prior to the Holy Mass at 11:00 am.\n\nBurial will be at St. John Nepomucene Catholic Cemetery in Fox River Grove.\n\nMemorials may be made to the St. Margaret Mary Parish reduction debt or the St. Vincent de Paul Society. Holy Mass offerings are also appreciated.\n\nThe Funeral Mass will be lived streamed https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_iPQKGd_GrYnNEpFKw_L6g\n\nCondolences (8)\n\nPlease take at least 25 seconds before clicking Submit to confirm the validity of the condolence.\n\nWritten Condolence\n\nVideo Condolence\n\n* Name\n\n* Condolence\n\nPlease leave a video condolence by entering your name and click the \"Record\" button below.
