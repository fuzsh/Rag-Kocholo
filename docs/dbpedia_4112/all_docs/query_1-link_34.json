        "text": "Actress Born Susan Jane Miller on Aug. 14, 1946 in Los Angeles, CA\n\nSusan Saint James is an actress and an activist. Having grown up in Rockford, Ill., Saint James became a household name at the age of 22 after starring as Peggy Maxwell on the series \"The Name of the Game.\" Saint James won a 1969 Emmy for the part.\n\nIn 1971, Saint James took the memorable role of Sally McMillan, Rock Hudson's wife, on \"McMillan & Wife.\" She was nominated for four Emmys for the performance, but left the show in 1976 to work in films. During her time on \"McMillan,\" Saint James married her makeup artist Thomas Lucas. They had two children — a daughter, Sunshine, and a son, Harmony, before their divorce in 1977.\n\nIn 1981, Saint James was invited to host \"Saturday Night Live,\" where she met executive producer Dick Ebersol. They married within a year of meeting.\n\nAfter doing many TV movies and a handful of features, including \"Outlaw Blues\" and \"Love at First Bite,\" Saint James returned to serial television in 1984 as Kate McArdle on \"Kate & Allie,\" a comedy costarring Jane Curtin about two best friends who divorce their husbands and decide to blend their families.\n\nWhen \"Kate & Allie\" was canceled, Saint James — who was in her mid-40s — decided to retire from acting. She had five children — her two kids with Lucas, and three sons with Ebersol named Charles, William and Teddy. Saint James also wanted to turn her focus toward the Special Olympics, which she has supported publicly since 1972.\n\nIn November 2004, Ebersol, Charles and Teddy were in a private plane that crashed in Colorado. Teddy, the pilot, and the flight attendant died in the crash. Today, Teddy Ebersol's Red Sox Fields at Lederman Park is dedicated to his memory."
