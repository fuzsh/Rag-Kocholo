        "text": "Susan Saint James (b. 1946) is an actress known for playing Kate McArdle on the 1980s sitcom Kate & Allie (with Jane Curtin, Ari Meyers, and Allison Smith) and as half the title characters on the detective series McMillan and Wife (with Rock Hudson).\n\nShe appeared on Sesame Street in season 20 at a Grouchketeer meeting. Oscar says she can't be one of them because she's too big, and compares her to one of the regular Grouchketeers. When Snuffy shows up late and lets Susan borrow his lid, Oscar doesn't approve, so he ends the meeting. (First: Episode 2601)\n\nSaint James hosted Saturday Night Live twice in the 1980s and appeared in episodes of M*A*S*H, The Drew Carey Show, Law & Order: Special Victims Unit, Ironside (with Raymond Burr), and recurring on the Amazon Prime series Upload. Film credits include What's So Bad About Feeling Good? (with Mary Tyler Moore and Dom DeLuise), Where Angels Go... Trouble Follows (with Mary Wickes), and Love at First Bite (with George Hamilton as Dracula).\n\nReferences[]\n\nSusan Saint James is among the many wrong guesses that Count von Count makes (and counts) in a game of \"Guess Who?\" in Episode 0899 of Sesame Street.\n\n[]\n\nIMDb"
