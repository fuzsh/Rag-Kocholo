        "text": "How much do you know about the history of women in Rockford?\n\nIn celebration and recognition of Women's History Month, the Rockford Register Star has partnered with Midway Village Museum to bring readers a local women's history fact of the day.\n\nVisit rrstar.com or the Rockford Register Star newspaper each day throughout the month of March to read about the women who played significant roles in Rockford history.\n\nThe former Susan Jane Miller was born in 1946 in Los Angeles, and moved to Rockford at age 9 when her father became president of Testor Corporation. She began modeling as a teenager, and by age 20 she was determined to become an actress and headed to Hollywood. Her breakout role was appearing opposite Rock Hudson in “McMillan & Wife” from 1971 to 1976.\n\nSt. James has returned often to Rockford to visit family and premiere new movies, and maintains a close affection for the community, stating, \"I’ll always consider Rockford my hometown.\" She has starred as a divorced mother in \"Kate & Allie\", and also appeared in \"Columbo,\" \"McCloud,\" \"M*A*S*H*\", and \"Law & Order: Special Victim’s Unit.\" The Emmy Award-winning actress received her star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2008."
