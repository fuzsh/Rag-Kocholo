        "text": "Leo Emile Robillard\n\nOn Saturday, July 27, 2024, Leo Emile Robillard died of Parkinson’s at the Genesis Rest Home in Saint Johnsbury, at the age of 77. He was born in Newport on May 7, 1947, to Joseph and Marie Angle Brasseur Robillard of Derby.\n\nHe graduated from Derby Academy in 1965. He also took a post-graduate course there. Then he went to Boston City Hospital to be an x-ray technician. From there he went to Vermont Technical College (VTC), where he graduated with an agriculture degree.\n\nAfter graduation, Leo worked at the family farm for many years. Later on, he worked at Columbia Forest Products for a short time. Throughout his life he suffered from schizophrenia and because of his health, it led to his early retirement.\n\nWhile in school, he was active in basketball and soccer. At VTC, he was on the varsity basketball team. He always loved any competitive game.\n\nLeo is survived by his brothers: Guy and his wife, Helen Couture Robillard, of Irasburg, and Denis and Helen Thayer Robillard of Derby Line. He is survived by his sisters: Raymonde Roy of Stanstead, Canada, Armande Boright of White River Junction, and Louise and Ernest Choquette of Newport Center. He is survived by his sister-in-law Yvone Robillard, and many nieces and nephews.\n\nHe was predeceased by his maternal grandparents, Emile and Elida Demers Brasseur; by his paternal grandparents, Hilare and Dorilda Gravel Robillard; by his parents, Joseph and Marie Robillard of Derby; by his brothers: Hilare, and Real and his wife, Dorothy McFarlane Robillard, and his second wife, Marie Price Robillard. He is also predeceased by his sister Mercedes and her husband, Leo Patenaude, of Newport Center; and by brothers-in-law Malcolm Boright of White River Junction, Vincent Amyot of Glover, and Roger Roy of Stanstead.\n\nThe funeral was held on Saturday, August 3, at Saint Mary’s Star of the Sea Catholic Church in Newport.\n\nAlice Eugenia Orthey MacKellar\n\nAlice Eugenia Orthey MacKellar, 96, died at Belaire Center, Newport, on June 19, 2024, with her daughter Peggy and son Bruce in attendance.\n\nShe was born on May 20, 1928, in Jamaica, Long Island, New York, the daughter of George and Alice (Downer) Orthey. Her childhood was in Rutherford, New Jersey, with summers in Vermont on the Lake Road, Newport. While her father was commander of the New York City Harbor Entrance Control Post on Staten Island, New York, she graduated from Tottenville (S.I.) High School as valedictorian. She received a bachelor’s of science, pre-med, summa cum laude, from Bethany College, West Virginia, and did graduate work at Rutgers University and New York University. After teaching at Bronx High School of Science (New York), she went to Cornell University to carry out research at the college of veterinary medicine.\n\nWhile in Ithaca, New York, Genie first felt her calling to help young people investigate what it means to be a servant of Jesus Christ. She spent 26 years as a Sunday school teacher, youth leader, and “Mother Hen” to high school students in every community and the church where she and her husband served.\n\nGenie met her husband, James MacKellar, at the Presbyterian student group at Cornell. They were married in the Methodist (now United) Church in Newport in August 1955. The wedding reception was on the lawn of “Baybrook,” the Orthey family homestead on the shores of Lake Memphremagog. They served Presbyterian churches in Dryden, New York, Waverly, New York, Stirling, New Jersey, and Lyons Falls, New York. In retirement they were faithfully active in the East Craftsbury Presbyterian Church. Jim predeceased her in 2017.\n\nGenie made flower gardens in each place she lived and continued at “BayBrook,” where her extensive plantations were enjoyed by many. From her flower gardens she often supplied floral arrangements for the church. Genie had many pursuits. She painted landscapes, two of which were voted “Best Vermont Landscape” at the state show at Northfield. She did the drawing for the picture on her grave marker in the Lake Road Cemetery. She enthusiastically aided and abetted many family get-togethers by the lake and happily welcomed guests. She restored antiques, spun, and knit. Above all, she had a consuming passion for her commitment to raising and training 19 guide dog puppies for the Seeing Eye over 36 years.\n\nGenie is survived by her children: Dr. Ian J. MacKellar, a veterinarian in Canton, New York, and his wife, Rebecca, Margaret A. “Peggy” MacKellar a dental hygienist in Lake Placid, New York, and her partner, Richard Preis, and Dr. Bruce W. MacKellar, a family practitioner in Hornell, New York, and his partner, Kris Dineen. She is also survived by five grandchildren: Shane and Gavin MacKellar, Katie M. Hart, Avery MacKellar, and Kelsey R. MacKellar. Her brother George predeceased her.\n\nFuneral services will be held at 2 p.m. on Sunday, September 1, at the East Craftsbury Presbyterian Church.

He was also the sole survivor of his immediate family, following the passing of his brother Maurice Lafleur in February 2024.\n\nRichard grew up on the Irasburg family farm and attended graded school, but unfortunately was unable to complete eighth grade, as his father suffered a stroke, and thus, being the eldest son, at 14 years of age, was tasked with a majority of the responsibilities of maintaining the family farm, along with his mother and other siblings.\n\nAt the age of 17-18, Richard began what would be his lifelong career at Ethan Allen, Inc. in Orleans (in between military assignments), before finally retiring in 1992, as the yard supervisor. Richard had an amazing work ethic, for which he expected from his employees as well, thus, sometimes perceived as being a strict boss, also one who in the end, was respected and appreciated by many.\n\nIn 1944, Richard enlisted as a Merchant Seaman in the U.S. Navy for approximately one and a half years. His responsibilities on the ship, as a fireman and primarily a ship’s gunner’s mate, (with a .50 caliber machine gun), was to protect the oil tankers while transporting fuel from England to all U.S. ports, supplying fuel for air bases and naval shipyards.\n\nHis next military stint was in 1946, in the regular Army where he was sent to Japan for the post WWII occupation for one and a half years, as a heavy truck driver. Medals earned for this service included: the WWII Victory Medal, the Army of Occupation Medal-Japan, and the National Defense Service Medal. Once home, he joined the Army National Guard, and in 1950, was called to report for the Korean War, where he spent 12 months in South Korea as a combat soldier. For this, he received numerous accolades: the Korean Service Medal with three Bronze Stars, the United Nations Service Medal, and the Republic of Korea Presidential Citizens Badge.\n\nOnce permanently back in the States, Richard eventually met the love of his life, Genevieve Pollander, at a Street Dance in the village of Orleans. After four and a half years of courtship, they were married on May 24, 1958, at St. Theresa’s Catholic Church in Orleans. Richard and Genevieve went on to have five children, and in 1972, moved to their final family dwelling in the village of Irasburg. It was here where Richard would be known for his extremely bountiful vegetable gardens and maintaining the very delicious and lucrative raspberry patch. As a beloved, devoted community member, Richard served on the Irasburg Village Water Board until 2007, when he and Genevieve sold their home to enjoy retirement and the rest of their days, residing in Orleans.\n\nRichard also held numerous handyman side jobs to support and raise his loving family of seven. He was the Irasburg Village Catholic Cemetery maintenance person (along with his children) for many years, and also helped with summertime haying for relatives and friends.\n\nOther community associations were being a member of the Knights of Columbus, the VFW, and the American Legion.\n\nIn his free time, Richard enjoyed hunting and fishing, for which such passion and skills trickled down to his children. No greater joy was had when he was enjoying these hobbies with his brothers and sons. Many stories and pictures document these wonderful adventures.\n\nRichard was predeceased by his wife, Genevieve; by his parents, Donalda and Albert Lafleur; by his in-laws, Irene and Stanislas Pollander; by his siblings: Clarice and her husband Lucien Messier, Rose and her husband, Eddy Vachon, Jean Paul and his wife, Anita Lafleur, Michael and his wife Yvette Lafleur, Dolores and her husband, Andrew Harbec, Maurice Lafleur, Gertrude and her husband, Ernest Beauregard, little brother Andrew Lafleur; and by and his grandson Christopher Lafleur. Richard was also predeceased by brothers-in-law: Aldie Pollander, Philip Pollander, Francis Pollander, Greg Cresswell, Joe Souliere, and Richard Ryan; and by sister-in-law Joan Souliere.\n\nRichard is survived by his children: David Lafleur and his partner Tani Breitenbach, Wayne and his wife, Cheryl Lafleur, Paul Lafleur, Bryan and his wife, Laura Lafleur, and Colleen Lafleur Doty.\n\nHe is also survived by his grandchildren: Jennifer and her husband, Daniel Pirillo, Shane and his wife, Katelyn Lafleur, Amelia Lafleur, Mitchel Pion, Colby Lafleur, Joel Lafleur and his partner, Whitney Wright, Nathan and his wife, Aubrey Lafleur, Andrew Lafleur, David Lafleur, Isaac Lafleur and his fiancée, Natalie Roberts, Emily Doty, and Brianna Doty (aka “Chipmunk” per her grandpa); as well as many nieces, nephews, and in-laws. Also, a dear friend, who began his acquaintance with the Lafleur family as a childhood friend of the twins, which grew to a lifetime bond and was also special to Richard, as close as a stepson could be, David Montague.\n\nA special thanks goes out to his dear neighbor and amazing friend Brigitte Moulton. Her watchful eye and loving care were greatly appreciated by his children, and she will forever hold a special place in their hearts.\n\nOther special friends in Richard’s later years, once retired, include Nelly Curtis, Maurice “Moe” Ingalls, Ray Decelles, and Lisa Gaboriault. Also, thank you to the employees of the Orleans Family Dollar and Thibault’s Market who always kept a watchful eye on Richard, even when he was still driving and doing errands in his 90s.\n\nRichard, Dick, Dickie, Dad, Pops, Grandpa, Super Pepe, Uncle Richard, will be dearly missed by all who knew him, but his legacy will live on through his family, friends, and colleagues.\n\nA funeral service will be held at St. Theresa’s Catholic Church in Orleans, where a Mass of Christian burial will be celebrated, on Saturday, September 28, at 10:30 a.m. with interment to follow at Irasburg Village Cemetery. A luncheon will follow at the St. Theresa’s Hall in Orleans.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, donations can be made to the local VFW 798 Auxiliary, who always accommodated Dad’s requests for holiday meals. Thank you, Annette and Gordon Brown. Address: VFW 798 Auxiliary, 141 Central Street, Newport, Vermont 05855.\n\nSusan Ginnett\n\nSusan Ginnett, 82, of Daytona Beach, Florida, formerly of Newport, died on July 19, 2024, in Daytona Beach.
