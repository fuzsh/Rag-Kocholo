        "text": "TORRINGTON, Conn. -- Actress Susan Saint James, who last week gave birth to her third child, has left Torrington's Charlotte Hungerford Hospital feeling wonderful and predicting her 23-inch son is basketball material.\n\nThe baby, Charles Duncan Ebersol, was born Thursday, weighing in at 9 pounds 2 ounces.\n\nHe 'is definitely basketball material,' Miss Saint James said Monday, 'and right now he looks like a basketball.'\n\n'He is really a giant, a monster,' said Miss Saint James, who lives in Litchfield with her husband, Dick Ebersol, executive producer of 'Saturday Night Live.'\n\nHer husband was born in the same hospital 35 years ago.\n\nMiss Saint James, co-star of the old 'McMillan & Wife' television series, and her husband, moved to Litchfield last fall where Ebersol's family lives.\n\nThe actress, an advocate of natural childbirth and breast feeding, said she received great cooperation from the hospital staff.\n\n'There was no interference from anybody.' Since the delivery 'many women have been coming into my room who have had natural childbirth, too, to talk about it,' she said.\n\nHer other children by a previous marriage, Harmony, 8, and Sunshine, 10, live with the couple in Litchfield."
