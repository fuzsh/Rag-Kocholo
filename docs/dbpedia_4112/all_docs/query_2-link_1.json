        "text": "Susan Saint James was a lovely and slightly loony TV successor to Shirley MacLaine. Her mildly kooky and clumsy free spirits came into vogue during the \"free love\" era of the late '60s.\n\nOf German, Irish and English ancestry, Saint James was born Susan Jane Miller in Los Angeles on August 14, 1946, to Charles Daniel Miller, a businessman, and Constance Geiger Miller. Both her mother and grandmother were schoolteachers. Raised in Rockford, Illinois, Susan was a model briefly during her teens in both the U.S. and France. She later attended the Connecticut College for Women.\n\nLuck in Hollywood came almost immediately to her when she landed a seven-year contract with Universal Studios. As if that wasn't enough, her very first TV job would be a plum \"girl Friday\" role on a TV movie pilot starring ultra-cool Anthony Franciosa and sexy femme fatale Jill St. John.\n\nAs an eager but awkward amateur sleuth in the whodunnit crime mystery Fame Is the Name of the Game (1966), audiences immediately took to Susan as the editorial assistant to investigative reporter Franciosa who snooped way too much and often found herself in life-threatening circumstances. Saint James would continue her role as Peggy Maxwell when the series was picked up. The Name of the Game (1968), with its revolving trio of stars Anthony Franciosa, Robert Stack and Gene Barry, became a hit and Susan earned three Emmy nominations, copping the trophy on her first try during the 1968-69 season.\n\nCleverly downplaying her sexy allure and model good looks for a more down-to-earth appeal, Susan also had a fun recurring role as an equally klutzy thief who complicates things for Robert Wagner's suave cat burglar in Ihr Auftritt, Al Mundy (1968). She hit her TV peak, however, as Police Commissioner Rock Hudson's plucky wife in McMillan & Wife (1971) from 1971 to 1976, her character still managing to get into her usual share of danger and trouble. She earned three more Emmy nominations.\n\nHaving gotten her feet wet on the big screen with a few featured/co-star roles in the private eye drama P.J. - Der Gnadenlose (1967), the convent comedy Wenn Engel reisen (1968), and the crime thriller Die nackte Tote (1968), Susan earned particular notice in the '70s with the action comedy Outlaw Blues (1977) opposite Peter Fonda, the cult Dracula spoof Liebe auf den ersten Biss (1979) opposite George Hamilton, and the female buddy crime caper Zahltag im Supermarkt (1980) with Jane Curtin and Jessica Lange. Surprisingly, none of these were the foundation for a lasting movie career.\n\nWisely, Susan returned to her comfy TV series format co-starring (again) with Jane Curtin in the liberal-minded sitcom Kate & Allie (1984), which lasted five seasons. She earned two additional Emmy nominations playing an adventurous libber versus Curtin's more conservative character. Saint James also thrived on TV movie comedies and dramas with several vehicles, including Magic Carpet (1972), Die kalte Hand des Schicksals (1978), Night Cries (1978), Die Mädels im Büro (1979), Mehr als ein Olympiasieg (1982) and I Take These Men (1983) coming her way.\n\nSaint James chose to back away from the limelight following the cancellation of Kate & Allie (1984). Moving to Connecticut, she devoted her time to raising a family and dedicating herself to charity work, notably the Special Olympics, for which she served on the board of directors. Since then, she has received several honors as a spokesperson for volunteerism.\n\nIn later years, Susan appeared infrequently on talk shows (David Letterman, Oprah Winfrey) and in rare guest star parts on such shows as \"M*A*S*H.\" She went on to grace the first episode of Die Drew Carey Show (1995), in which niece Christa Miller was a co-star. More recently, she has been seen on episodes of the TV series \"Law & Order: Special Victims Unit\" and \"Suits\" and had a recurring role on several 2020 episodes of \"Upland.\" In 2008, Susan received a star on the Walk of Fame for her TV work.\n\nFormerly married to writer/producer Richard Neubert and makeup artist Tom Lucas, Saint James is married to NBC executive Dick Ebersol, best known for his work on Saturday Night Live (1975). She is the mother of five children, two by Lucas and three by Ebersol."
