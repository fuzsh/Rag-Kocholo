        "text": "This lovable, large-eyed brunette was a surefire audience pleaser playing somewhat kooky, mildly klutzy and generally free-spirited types on TV, and in the occasional film, since the mid-1960s. The typical Saint James character was a beautiful innocent who would boldly stumble in where more sober types feared to tread. She remains best known for two long stints as a series co-star on the mystery-cum-romantic comedy \"McMillan and Wife\" (NBC, 1971-76) and the quietly feminist sitcom \"Kate & Allie\" (CBS, 1984-89). The former cast her as the adventurous wife of the slightly stuffy but decidedly studly San Francisco Police Commissioner. Her Sally McMillan had a penchant for trouble which required the heroic intervention of her atypical bureaucrat hubby Stewart a.k.a. \"Mac\" (Rock Hudson)."
