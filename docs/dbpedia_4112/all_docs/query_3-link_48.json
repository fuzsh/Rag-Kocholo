        "text": "Gone\n\nThree teens -- Jason King (guest star Harry Zittel), Doug Waverly (guest star Teddy Eck) and Nick Pratt (guest star Paul David Story) -- are suspected of foul play when high school student Jennifer Durning (guest star Barbara King) disappears after a night of partying. Nick and Doug's wealthy parents and their attorneys argue the plan was for Jason to lose his virginity to Jennifer before the other two had consensual sex with her -- but Jason got greedy. Jason agrees to testify, but when he disappears, Judge Donnelly has no choice but to dismiss the case. A.D.A. Casey Novak (Diane Neal) becomes suspicious because without Jason's testimony there's no case against the other boys. Attorneys Dave Seaver (guest star Michael Boatman), Oliver Gates (guest star Barry Bostwick) and Monica Bradshaw (guest star Susan Saint James) represent the teens. Mariska Hargitay, Chris Meloni, Tamara Tunie, Dann Florek, Richard Belzer and Ice T also star.\n\nBail Out\n\nMike's life becomes complicated when an old friend reappears and needs his help. Harvey must decide between closing a multi-million dollar deal and helping his trusted driver defend himself against a law suit."
