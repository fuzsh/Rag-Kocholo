        "text": "My aunt worked in reception at a phen-fen clinic in Manhattan in the '90s. She said Susan and her daughter came in a few times and they were absolute sweethearts. They chatted with her and apparently Susan was pretty funny. It's probably one of the few positive stories she's ever told me about the place. The other ones involve her having to testify at the murder of the doctor there whose ex-girlfriend killed him because he was going to report their Medicaid fraud. Oh, and right after she had the good sense to get the fuck out of there, the place was set up with hidden cameras by the local news to prove that they were falsifying documents so that the gym they had could be paid for by insurance as 'physical therapy'. No wonder she decided to stick to her crappy retail job at a Queens Macy's since then.\n\nShe's married to Dick Ebersole (sp) and essentially quit the bus to raise her kids (post-Kate and Allie). Her husband and two sons were in a plane crash at Christmas time a few years ago, the youngest son died. She was on the Today Show a year or so ago discussing the event. She's very hippie-like holistic, earth mother these days. Nice lady, but in a bit of a bubble since the son died.\n\n\"I heard she re-embraced her Catholic faith and is quite devout these days.\"\n\nShe went to a catholic girls high school in Rockford Illinois. Losing your youngest in a place crash might have something to do with that.\n\nI read that Rock Hudson loathed working with her on MacMillan & Wife. (Yeah, yeah, I know. This is some musty, moldy gossip. But I love 70s cop shows.) Anyway, the story I read was that she made outrageous demands when the show became a hit. She assumed that because \"& Wife\" was in the title of the show that she had some leverage. Apparently she didn't and they killed her character off.\n\nI think she first surfaced playing Peggy Maxwell in a TV show called \"The Name of the Game\". The show provided episodes focused on 3 men involved in a magazine empire. Robert Stack and Anthony Franciosa were reporters (for Crime and People Magazines) and Gene Barry played Glenn Howard, owner of the magazines.\n\nThe stories rotated among the 3 stars. SSJ appeared occasionally early on and then eventually became the only cast member who appeared in episodes for all of the 3 stars.\n\nYou can find the old episodes late at night (on COZI-TV I think). I really liked SSJ when the show first aired, but watching the old episodes, the 3 main actors are still fine to watch but SSJ is really annoying now.\n\nThe same is true with MacMillan & Wife. Rock Hudson's performances still hold up, while SSJ is annoying.\n\n[quote]I think she first surfaced playing Peggy Maxwell in a TV show called \"The Name of the Game\"\n\nThis is correct. She was one of the last of the Universal contract players.\n\n[quote]Her daughter got fired from Drew Carey.\n\nAre you referring to Christa Miller (from \"Cougar Town\"?) She's her niece, not her daughter.\n\nI thought it was so weird how they dealt with Sally/Susan St. James on \"McMillan and Wife.\" Susan kept getting pregnant, so Sally spent at least 1/3 of the series heavily pregnant. Rather than hiding it, they presented Sally as being pregnant and it was even a plot point of at least one episode in which Sally is being rushed to the hospital due to some sort of pregnancy-related complication. She and Mac discussed the baby and how their lives would change. Bickered over possible names, etc.\n\nThen Sally suddenly wasn't pregnant anymore and the baby was never discussed again, as far as I could tell. Shortly thereafter, Sally herself disappeared and the show was suddenly \"McMillan.\" It was like the producers thought their viewers had the attention/memory span of goldfish.\n\nAre there any lesbian rumours about her?\n\nI just finished watching the entire Kate & Allie series, I'd never watched it before and didn't even know who Susan Saint James was, and I just thought she pinged big time. I know she's married and has/had 5 kids but that doesn't mean anything. Her husband is a powerful unattractive, conservative man so she could have married him to further her career. Meredith Baxter had 5 kids but struggled with her sexuality the whole time she was married. Susan just seems like that kind of woman, who married and had a bunch of kids because that was the thing to do. Everything about her screams closeted lez or bi. Even on Kate & Allie she seems like she loves Allie more than Allie loves her. She refers to her often as \"my girlfriend\". The whole sitcom is so gay it's funny they tried to hide it."
