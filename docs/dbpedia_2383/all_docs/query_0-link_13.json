        "text": "The following sketch is based upon investigations made in the Etruscan Tombs at Corneto and Chiusi, and on comparison of the original wall-paintings with the facsimiles and drawings made from them and preserved in the Helbig Museum in the Ny Carlsberg Glÿpt οtek. It was originally published in Danish, in 1919, as a guide to students in that Department. I am greatly indebted to Mr. G. F. Hill, of the British Museum, for his revision of the translation. Meanwhile the first volume of the promised work of Fritz Weege (Etruskische Malerei, Halle, 1921) has appeared, copiously and splendidly illustrated. The text contains general views concerning Etruscan religion and society rather than descriptions of the paintings themselves, and I cannot refrain from saying that I find Weege's statements and opinions, and the parallels which he adduces, too often more fanciful than convincing, in spite of the vast erudition displayed therein. I do not find anything in my own text which I feel inclined to alter after reading his book.\n\nThe Tomba dell'Orco is one of the most beautiful and richly decorated tombs in the Etruscan necropolis of Tarquinia (Lazio, Italy). The necropolis extends over a wide hill territory of 750 ha; in particular, this tomb is situated on a hill close to the modern cemetery of Tarquinia. The tomb was discovered in 1868 and it is composed of two distinct sepulchral rooms, dating back to the beginning and the end of 4th century B.C., respectively. The biggest and more recent room is the object of our investigation. Although this tomb has been intensively studied in the past for purposes of restoration and conservation, a scientific report has never been published. During the last restoration (2001), several scientific investigations were performed in order to characterise the materials and technique of execution of the mural paintings. In this study, we report the Raman and EDXRF measurements carried out to identify the colour palette. In some cases, to confirm and clarify some results, it was necessary to work on cross-sections, to analyse the composition of the different layers. Mixtures of ochre and cinnabar were found on the body of the painted figures, while only red ochre was used for decorative elements. Orpiment and yellow ochre were used as yellow pigments. It was also possible to recognise calcite- and copper-based pigments for white and green-blue decorations, respectively. Evidences of Egyptian Blue were also found.

There is no general consensus in scholarship about whether these scenes refer to banquets held in the realm of the living, such as those which might have occurred at funeral feasts, or whether they were intended to represent the afterlife existence of the deceased. This article first introduces the categories of Etruscan funerary art that will be considered, providing a descriptive overview. Then, the current scholarly arguments that banqueting imagery informs us about the realm of the living will be summarized, before providing the author's own interpretation, with the aim of concluding that funerary art primarily informs us about the realm of the dead."
