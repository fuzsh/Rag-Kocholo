        "text": "Golden Temple Hand painted Harmandir Sahib oil painting. This was my first ever large Canvas project. When I first visited the Golden Temple in 2021 I had Vision of making this on canvas as attractive as in reality. So I only used gold foil to give justice to the Art. I did not want to ruin the authenticity of gold. Thus, you see the pure gold effect shining brightly. I can create this in different variations, with sunrise or sunset. I choose this one with blue color to represent calmness as I wanted it for my Living room. Where should I Hang this Painting? Since the North-East direction is dedicated to water elements, paintings carrying this feature should be placed in this direction. E.g. waterfalls, flowing water, streams, fountains, riverscapes, as this Painting has water-element It will give you best benefit in this side, but you can keep any direction as it is still best for positivity and power\n\nTitle- Chromatic Dance Medium- Acrylic on canvas Size : 15 x 15â€˜â€˜. The painting is dominated by abstract shapes and a strong sense of movement. There are no recognizable objects or figures depicted, but rather a focus on the interplay of color, form, and line.The color palette is bold and vibrant. The colors are not applied flatly, but rather with visible brushstrokes and layering, creating a sense of depth and texture. In the center of the canvas, there is a large, amorphous blue form that appears to be the focal point of the composition. It seems to be dynamic and energetic, with gestural brushstrokes suggesting movement or wind. While the blue form creates a center of gravity, the painting is not perfectly symmetrical.The overall impression of the painting is energetic, dynamic, and uplifting. The bright colors and gestural brushstrokes evoke a sense of movement and exuberance. As with most abstract art, interpretations can vary depending on the viewerâ€™s perspective. The painting represent the energy and chaos of city life. The swirling shapes and bright colors could evoke feelings of joy and celebration. The blue form in the center could symbolize a source of power or calm amidst the movement.#artstrick #artwork #canvaspaintingðŸŽ¨ #livingroominspiration #affordableart #buyart #buyartonline #artcollection #indianhomedecor #artforsale #artforhome #decostyle #abstractart#abstractexpressionism #abstractpainting #layeringtechniques #paintingofthedayðŸŽ¨\n\nThe year end painting hiatus is still on but this doesn't count as a painting - it's an experiment. I'm probably going to try lots more simple three layer portraits in the new year like the one from earlier this month (in the comments). I might even try painting from the same source photo using multiple colour schemes, Andy Warholish. But to do this, I need to identify suitable colour schemes. So I picked out 15 possible triads, all made up of transparent colours and with the first two layers being staining colours so that they wouldnâ€™t be disturbed by later layers. No then I did the same painting with all 15 sets. In the first row I don't like top left: with the other two it depends on whether I want neutral coloured shadows or something greenish to clash with the orange. In the second row, the blue and purple works. Of the reds, the one on the right is good but the one on the left is a reject. Then two green ones - both look fine. Then I'm on to the supergranulator sets. First a blue/purple one with the tundra set. That looks good. Two green ones with the Shire set. I prefer the one on the left as the crushed up stones in the dark green in the shadow on the right are a bit offputting. And finally four sets with the desert colours. Two choices of light colour and both look good. I prefer desert green to desert grey as the dark colour, though, as it seems to form a more natural sequence with the lighter colours, so I'm preferring bottom left and bottom right of these four. So I have ten colour schemes to play with: - two orange, one blue, one red and two green from my regular palette - one tundra, one Shire and two desert from my super granulating palette\n\nEternal Embrace Affection of Love: Handcrafted Acrylic Canvas Painting - Wall Art Decor by Colouredgeindia Material - canvas board, acrylic paint Size - 36 inch by 36 inch Colour-red, brown, green pink, blue Step into a world where emotions come to life through vibrant strokes and intricate details with our mesmerizing masterpiece, 'Eternal Embrace.'

Even from a distance, each painting is a beautiful image, with subtle colors of blue, green, and purple. But if youâ€™re lucky enough to take a close look at the masterpieces, youâ€™ll understand that itâ€™s all the tiny details that come together to display Monetâ€™s brilliance. Itâ€™s each tiny brush stroke, each subtle use of color, and the texture of the oil-based paints. I like to paraphrase Disney and say â€˜the magic is in the details.â€™ Paying attention to the details of any design makes it better. Itâ€™s not just seeing the perfect place setting at the table, but noticing that all the silverware lines up neatly with the edge of the plate, listening to the ambience of the room. Itâ€™s the same with brand design: the details make the difference between mediocre and magnificent. If youâ€™re not focused on the details, you wonâ€™t be able to reach that magical place."
