        "text": "The most iconic, widely known, widely used, and most referenced virus in the entire Resident Evil series was the Tyrant Virus, or t-Virus (sometimes capitalized as \"T-Virus\"; also referred to as the \"Cannibal Disease\" by the media of Raccoon City). The t-Virus revolutionized modern warfare in the same fashion gunpowder did. While viruses such as T-JCCC203, \"t-Wesker\", and t-Veronica were technically t-Viruses, this analysis focuses on the Umbrella Corporation's primary t-Virus first developed at the Umbrella Executive Training School, and later refined at the Arklay research facility.\n\nEach aspect of the t-Virus and its mutated hosts are covered below in the following parts, in this order:\n\nPart One:\n\nOverview (History and Effects)\n\nZombies (Humans)\n\nZombie Animals (Mammalian and Aves)\n\nEvolved Zombies (Crimson Heads, Lickers, etc.)\n\nTyrants\n\nPart Two:\n\nArthropods (Spiders and Insects)\n\nAnnelids (Worms)\n\nChordates (Reptiles, Fish, Amphibians, and Tunicate)\n\n​Plants\n\nPart Three:\n\nHybrids (Hunters, Chimeras, etc.)\n\nSuper Humans (Sergei and Mary Grey)\n\nMiscellaneous (Undertakers, Nyx, etc.)\n\nt-Virus Countermeasures\n\n​This is part one of Virus Analysis: Tyrant.\n\nt-Virus Project\n\nThe secret main goal of the pharmaceutical corporation Umbrella was the production of living bioweapons called Bio Organic Weapons (B.O.W.s) using the capacity of the Progenitor Virus to rewrite genes. But Progenitor was far too lethal to establish itself in host bodies. The need for an artificial variant strain thousands of times weaker was apparent, both to produce B.O.W.s and to achieve the corporation's founders' ultimate goals of immortality and forced evolution. This was the aim of the t-Virus Project.\n\nThe t-Virus Project was the central focus of Umbrella, and had three stages conceptualized:\n\nCreation of a new, ideal virus.\n\nStabilization of this virus.\n\nB.O.W. production.\n\nAny virus created from Progenitor as a part of this Project was given the moniker \"t\" or referred to as a \"Clay Virus\". While many t-Viruses were created under this project, the virus that accomplished all three stages would be officially called \"the t-Virus\". The completed t-Virus needed to be able to infect any host and give animals traits ideal in a weapon (ferocity, vitality, and controllability). The ideal B.O.W. would be called the Tyrant, named after the Virus (a trend reused with the G-Virus). A tyrant (Latin: Tyrannus; Greek: Tyrannos) is someone who is an absolute ruler (like tyrannosaurus rex) which was chosen as the name for the virus due to the aspirations of Umbrella's leadership.\n\nIn 1977, Umbrella Co-founder Dr. James Marcus created what would become the successful base for the finished t-Virus. This strain, unofficially dubbed t-Marcus, was created by injecting Progenitor into leeches. When a virus successfully establishes itself in a host, it mutates due to recombination with the host's cells. It not only changes the host but is changed itself. The key to weakening Progenitor was to find hosts it could infect without killing, then extracting the recombinant strain from the host.\n\nLeeches, like the Stairway to the Sun flower, were highly resistant to the damaging effects of the virus, allowing them to adapt and mutate. It is implied that t-Marcus was actually based on the Type B strain of Progenitor used on Lisa Trevor, as it was the only virus Umbrella had managed to create up to that point that didn't kill every human it infected.\n\nStabilization\n\nThe Ebola virus\n\nTasked with finishing the t-Virus, Wesker and Birkin became fascinated with the Ebola Virus. What makes Ebola so dangerous is its incubation period: a host will not display symptoms immediately and will inadvertently spread the virus to others. This inspired the duo, as the t-Virus was originally envisioned as merely a tool to create B.O.W.s, not a deadly weapon on its own.\n\nWhile the Zombie mutation of t-Marcus was not suitable for the Project's goals, it could outdo Ebola: instead of creating carriers who accidentally and indirectly spread the virus, t-Virus hosts would actively seek out others and infect them. The t-Virus was essentially envisioned as a cheaper alternative to bombs, which would also have the added bonus of leaving infrastructure intact. As a precaution, the virus was modified to grow less infectious over time, to prevent a pandemic.\n\nA sample of Ebola was brought to the Arklay laboratory, and Birkin incorporated its genes into the t-Virus in order to strengthen its properties. As noted by the Biology of Evil, the only Ebola genes that would benefit the t-Virus would be VP24 and VP25. These genes would allow the t-Virus to infect hosts with a smaller likelihood of triggering an immune response. This would ensure not only that less people would be immune to the virus, but that more hosts could survive infection as Zombies without suffering a fatal immune reaction.\n\nt-Marcus was weakened and modified over the years by infecting a wide variety of hosts. By injecting t-Marcus into spiders (tarantulas), they created t/Clay Alpha (α). α had greater results in arthropod hosts, and created the Web Spinner B.O.W.\n\nα was also used with Great White Sharks to enhance its abilities with marine life and to test the viability of the virus in such animals. While results were minimal, they were not totally in vain, and the Neptune B.O.W. was created.\n\nAfter injecting α into dogs (Dobermans), the Beta (β) strain was created, as was the Cerberus B.O.W. β had enhanced abilities in mammalian hosts, but infected humans still left much to be desired.\n\nWhile at this stage in development (1981), the t-Virus only affected nine out of ten people. Spencer ordered the Arklay staff to focus on creating a strain that was 100% effective. This was because at some point, Spencer planned to use the t-Virus to wipe out most of the human race. While the staff had difficulty overcoming the 10% immunity problem, Birkin developed a work-around - the development of B.O.W.s that could hunt down and kill anyone who resisted the virus. This idea resulted in the Hunter Project.\n\nThe β strain was further modified to create Beta II, which allowed for greater powers of genetic manipulation. βII created genetic hybrids such as the Hunter B.O.W.\n\nWhile βII could produce favorable results in many organisms, the ideal B.O.W. Tyrant needed to be based on a human host for it to possess enough intelligence to effectively follow complex orders. However, the virus was too damaging in human brains, and could not create Tyrants in that state. Birkin refined the virus further and managed to create a new strain of βII that would have a minimal influence on a human's brain, so long as the host \"completely adapted\" to the virus. Only humans born with a certain genome could adapt, and such hosts would be exceedingly rare - only one in ten million people were compatible (according to simulations run by the \"Gene Analysis Section\"). Umbrella was unsuccessful in finding such a host, and as a result the Project reached a standstill.\n\nIn April of 1996, Umbrella took base cells from at least 13 people, including Yoko Suzuki, in order to further refine the t-Virus. The exact nature of this experiment is unknown, but it was apparently \"essential to completing T\". These individuals may have been closer to Tyrant adaption than an average person, although likely not to the extent Sergei was, and used to make it possible for the t-Virus to turn even more people into Tyrants. There is also another possibility, proposed by News Bot: each of the 13 test subjects appeared to come from a very different ethnic background. It may have been that they were used to make the t-Virus more effective against a wide range of different ethnicities, as part of Spencer's goal for the virus to be capable of affecting everyone on the planet.\n\nIn 1998, the t-Virus reached a certain level of perfection. The latest strain was designated Epsilon (ε). It is unknown if there were Gamma or Delta strains of the virus in-between βII and ε - it is possible that any intermediary strains between them were not impressive enough for Umbrella to name, and so they skipped two letters.\n\n​\n\nTwo test subjects were used to create the first two Tyrants (the T-001 and T-002), and with the first Tyrants created, ε was officially made the Umbrella t-Virus. While Tyrants were costly and difficult to create from scratch, not to mention infertile, they could easily be mass produced via cloning.\n\nMansion Incident\n\nDuring the administration of ε into the host who became the T-002 on May 11, 1998, the Arklay Laboratory was attacked by the Queen Leech (a mutant with the memories of the deceased Dr. Marcus), resulting in ε leaking as an airborne strain. While the researchers attempted to prevent a biohazard with protective suits, the virus reached the water supply. This led to the outbreak incident known as the \"Mansion Incident\".\n\nUmbrella quarantined the Mansion and forced the staff within to study the effects of the virus as it spread. Any results were then recovered using the underground railway and used for B.O.W. development in other facilities. Birkin also used the railway to recover cloned B.O.W. embryos and virus samples, including a cloned embryo of the T-002, which became the base for the mass production model of Tyrant.\n\nThe outbreak went on until the dawn of the 25th of July, when the facility was eradicated by Rebecca Chambers from S.T.A.R.S. (Special Tactics And Rescue Service; a unit belonging to the Raccoon City Police Department, which had been lured to the Mansion by Wesker to collect combat data on the B.O.W.s and irregular mutants there) using the self-destruct system.\n\nBioterror\n\nFive years after its creation, t-Birkin was refined further to create \"Perfected T\", a strain which harnessed the full potential of the t-Virus. As such, it is likely it could infect corpses (like t-Alfred) create super humans from adapters (like t-Wesker) and create Tyrants without the use of body-strengthening surgeries (like t+G). Perfected T was the final strain of the t-Virus created by Umbrella. It was stolen from the Umbrella Caucasus Facility (a massive facility built to mass produce B.O.W.s) in 2003 and leaked to the black market by Wesker, who defected from Umbrella some time prior. This, combined with other former Umbrella employees stealing Umbrella viruses and research, resulted in the global age of bioterror. The t-Virus is now widely available to terrorist groups, corporations, and governments all over the planet. Umbrella itself was rendered defunct the same year due to its involvement in B.O.W. production becoming public knowledge, although it was reestablished four years later under special conditions as a PMC called Blue Umbrella.\n\nThe t-Virus was used during the Harvardville Outbreak in 2005, and in its aftermath a vaccine developed by the WillPharma Corporation was recovered. However, new viruses based on Umbrella's t-Virus strains have been developed by many different groups and new mutant strains are common. Rather than eliminate the problem, the vaccine potentially complicated it by motivating bioterror groups to bypass the vaccine by continuing Umbrella's dark legacy. These groups include TRICELL, A-GUA Industries, Neo-Umbrella, Shén Yā Pharmaceutical, and even first-world governments.\n\nMost post-Perfected T strains have only minor differences between them, but evolved strains have begun to eliminate necrosis and toxicity, resulting in smarter Zombie breeds and Tyrants created from simple injection. While many t-Viruses in the age of bioterror are not named, some are different enough to be given new titles. These include:\n\nt-Abyss\n\nt-Phobos\n\nt-Howard\n\nKodoku\n\nA-Virus\n\nAs the t-Virus is thousands of times weaker than the Progenitor Virus, and because its mutations are tailored towards creating living weapons, it serves as the perfect base for new viruses and is \"the raw material most suitable for creating Bio Organic Weapons\".\n\n​Summary\n\nIn short, the development of the t-Virus involved a direct line of succession with mutated strains of the Progenitor Virus, with each strain more and more effective for Umbrella's purposes. The main strains known in this line of succession are:\n\nProgenitor\n\nProgenitor Type B\n\nt-Marcus\n\nt-Ebola\n\nClay α\n\nClay β\n\nClay βII\n\nClay ε\n\nε (V-ACT)\n\nt-Birkin\n\nPerfected T\n\nSymptoms and Effects\n\nThe vast majority of t-Virus effects actually originate in the Progenitor Virus: certain traits are simply made more prominent in the t-Virus. The primary effect, intended effect of the t-Virus is the promotion of \"abnormal evolution, enabling higher forms of life and making divine achievements possible\". This is opposed to the Progenitor Virus, which originally promoted natural evolution. The speed of this \"evolution\" was accelerated by the virus, so that it could occur in a single generation. The \"abnormal evolution\" promoted by the t-Virus is geared towards turning living organisms into weapons, culminating in the development of \"new capabilities that are impossible for evolution in the natural world\". In general, the t-Virus makes hosts tougher and puts them into a berserk state. While it is excellent at turning animals into super predators, the t-Virus also generally causes a decline in intelligence. Tissue necrosis and infertility are also common symptoms. These issues are what caused Umbrella research to drag on for decades before adequate t-Virus B.O.W.s could be created.\n\nThe specific trait that makes the t-Virus different from any other weakened Progenitor strain is the Tyrant mutation, which is essentially the result of Umbrella forcing evolution in a direction that makes organisms ideal soldiers. As a result, all instances of the Tyrant mutation come from the t-Virus (for example, Ultimate Abyss, Morpheus, Diego, and Ustanak all get their traits from the t-Virus percentage within their variant strains). The details of Tyrant creation and each type of Tyrant are covered below in the \"Tyrant\" section.\n\nThe t-Virus has vastly different effects on different types of organisms, and this is demonstrated as each mutant animal is covered in this analysis. But certain effects are universal, such as:\n\nIncrease in size\n\nHeightened aggression\n\nAugmented instincts\n\nIncreased strength and vitality\n\nLack of fear\n\nt-Virus hosts lacking fear and having heightened aggression could partially be contributed to potential changes in the amygdala, a part of the brain which takes a primary role in decision-making and emotional responses. The absence of fear, pain, and fatigue were invaluable traits in a weapon.\n\nThe virus will also commonly cause inflammation, leading to enlarged and discolored veins. This is due to the body having a severe immune response to the t-Virus. The increase in size displayed in almost all hosts combined with excessive regeneration also leads to irregular tissue development, which in turn leads to the development of tumor-like growths across the skin. These tumors may very well be cancerous, possibly harming the long-term viability of t-creatures.\n\nAlmost all hosts to the t-Virus gain an incredible increase in vitality, so that most are able to endure physical shock to a degree greater than almost all natural animals. The t-Virus will actually improve the immune system of hosts following transformation, allowing creatures with open wounds to survive for long periods of time, and to resist the damaging effects of other Progenitor-based viruses. These attributes also make the t-Virus valuable from a medicinal standpoint, and it is implied that Umbrella used the virus to become the leading manufacturer of the best pharmaceuticals. The t-Virus even has the potential to cure terminal illnesses.\n\nMany t-Virus mutants will twitch on the ground after being killed. As the t-Virus keeps various bodily system alive in impossible circumstances, it may be that it also keeps parts of the brain alive even after the host is severely damaged. This could cause parts of the motor cortex and motor nerves to fire off in an uncontrolled fashion (credit: Doktor Wunderbar). Monsters left in this state could possibly regenerate and resume activity at a later time, as the virus makes recovery possible so long as enough of the host is still kept alive.\n\nThe t-Virus makes \"gene synthesis between different species comparatively easy\" (see the Hybrids section in part 3 of this analysis). It may also be capable of increasing the potential of cells to generate and transport electricity (see \"Albinoid\", under the Amphibia section in part 2 of this analysis).\n\nZombie specification stats taken from Biohazard Directors Cut: Inside of Biohazard Guide\n\nThe t-Virus can be transmitted as an airborne strain, but will not stay this way for long, due to it having \"a property to evolve with the passage of time and external environment\". It will quickly mutate and stabilize into forms better suited to dispersal through water, saliva, blood, and even touch. After a sufficient amount of time has passed, it will become less and less virulent, until even Zombie bites will no longer spread it. The virus still posed the potential to mutate in the wild, however, which could circumvent this limitation.\n\nThe virus could also contaminate the environment by getting into bodies of water and soil. The only solution to environmental contamination with the t-Virus would be the incineration of the area. Destroying an area with missile strikes could create the possibility of virus-filled soil being blown upward and contaminating rainwater.\n\n​\n\nAs late as 1981, 10% of t-Virus hosts would not experience the onset of symptoms. This is because of the delicate differences in genes from individual to individual, some of which were not compatible with the t-Virus. It is unknown if an incompatible host would function as a \"healthy carrier\" - someone who is asymptomatic but is still capable of accidentally spreading the virus to others. It is also unknown if Umbrella managed to change this percentage over time.\n\nThe incubation period for the t-Virus varies wildly and is affected by a number of factors. Namely:\n\nEnvironment\n\nHost resistance (being severely wounded affects this)\n\nDosage\n\nThe strain of the t-Virus used is also a factor. Epsilon could take many days before the onset of transformation, while Perfected T only took seconds.\n\n​It is important to note that \"B.O.W.\" only refers to creatures created through primary infection (injection of the virus in a laboratory setting), and which were created for the express purpose of being used as weapons. B.O.W.s created by the t-Virus specifically have been called \"t-Series B.O.W.s\". Monsters created through secondary infection (tainted water, bites from other virus hosts, eating infected flesh, or even inhaling an aerosol form) are called \"Irregular Mutants\", and are typically formed as the result of an accidental leak. While Irregular Mutants are much more violent than normal animals, they are less likely to actively attack humans than B.O.W.s, at least in the case of infected animals. They will however always resort to violence if their territory is invaded. \"t-Virus Series Creature\" refers to both B.O.W.s and Irregular Mutants created by the t-Virus.\n\n​\n\nTo tell you the truth, last month there was an accident in the lab and a virus being studied began to leak. All my colleagues who were infected with the virus are now dead.\n\n...Well, maybe not dead exactly.\n\nThey can still walk around, and in fact, some are beating on the door of my room right now. But there's no light of intellect in their eyes anymore.\n\nThat cursed virus forever erase from the human brain everything that makes us human, love, joy, fear and humor.\n\n​Most humans exposed to the t-Virus will undergo a process called \"Zombification\", which ends in the development of a Zombie organism - a mutant with the appearance of a reanimated corpse (\"Living Dead\"), that lacks an ego and is hostile towards humans. While commonly associated with the t-Virus, this effect actually originated in Progenitor, and is a fairly universal symptom in all ​Progenitor-based viruses. The first \"t-Zombies\" (tentative name for Zombies created by the t-Virus) were created by James Marcus, after he decided that only mammalian hosts to the virus could retain enough intelligence to follow orders. Due to the majority of t-Virus outbreaks happening in areas populated primarily by humans, Zombies are the most common byproduct of the virus. Depending on why and how a Zombie was created, it could be considered either a B.O.W. or an irregular mutant.\n\nThese creatures were named Zombies due to their resemblance in appearance and behavior to the fictional creatures popularized by the movie \"Night of the Living Dead\" by George A. Romero, and by the many works of Zombie fiction that followed it. This is why many Resident Evil characters call them \"Zombies\" despite not being aware of their official designation. \"Romero Zombies\" were likewise retroactively named after the \"Zombi\", a kind of creature from the Vodou religion. According to mythology, Zombis were buried corpses that were revived and forced into slavery, for the purpose of forced labor and even criminal activity. Some modern scholars believe that real Zombis were actually living humans under the influence of powerful drugs. As the Progenitor Virus has had a hidden influence on human history, it may be that Zombis were actually the result of viral infection as well, and that Zombies created by the t-Virus were indirectly named after creatures they were actually related to.\n\nProgenitor-family viruses kill hosts that are unable to withstand the rapid, dramatic physical changes they cause. They can also cause a fatal immune response in hosts, leading to death by cytokine storm. While the t-Virus managed to lessen the toxicity of Progenitor by several thousand degrees, it was still highly damaging to the host body.\n\nZombies are the result of virus hosts being simultaneously weakened and strengthened, putting them in the middle ground between hosts who survive and die from infection. Zombie bodies resemble walking corpses due to necrosis (the death of cells in multiple tissues). t-Virus necrosis is caused by both intense mutations breaking down cells and by the host’s high, constantly-active metabolism causing the body to “eat itself”, a phenomenon similar to the final stages of starvation. Despite their sickly appearance the virus has also granted them vitality far exceeding natural animals. A later source also claims Zombies are capable of regeneration, which could simply be an allusion to Crimson Heads or Lickers (see the \"Evolved Zombies\" section).\n\nBefore/during Zombification, infected hosts undergo a number of visible symptoms:\n\nFatigue\n\nIntense Itching\n\nFever\n\nRash, which progresses to skin necrosis​\n\nIncreased sense of hunger\n\nPsychosis\n\n​Clouding of consciousness and loss of reasoning\n\nAggression\n\nComa\n\nThe fatigue and fever symptoms are also synonymous with many other diseases, and the host at this stage will often mistake t-Virus infection with the common cold. The itching symptom is due to the virus' promotion of the host's metabolism. This itching sensation is later exacerbated when the t-Virus erodes the outer layers of the epidermis (skin), leading to rashes and shedding.\n\nHosts will slowly lose their minds, and will be driven by hunger to attack and consume others (such as the infamous Keeper). This symptom immediately precedes coma, and is short. Newer, faster strains of the t-Virus skip this stage entirely, due to the Zombie transformation happening much sooner.\n\nDuring coma, the host will enter a state of suspended animation. Damage from the virus reaches a critical point, and vital signs drop so low they become undetectable. This gives the illusion that Zombies rise from the dead, which is technically not true, as the brain never fully shuts down. In a certain sense of the word, Zombies are still \"alive\", and are plagued by a certain kind of decomposition without ever actually dying. It would be more accurate to call them feral humans that are rotting while alive than to call them undead.\n\nIn addition to the t-Virus degrading brain cells directly, brain damage and coma may be exasperated further by the host experiencing autoimmune encephalitis. This is when the immune system targets the brain (in this case due to the t-Virus reaching the brain and the body attempting to fight it off), resulting in inflammation that can cause brain damage and even a coma state. This would explain why hosts to advanced strains of the t-Virus seem to \"die\" and transform faster, as the virus activity is increased to the point that it reaches and begins to affect the brain sooner.\n\n​\n\nAfter a period, the virus strengthening reaches a critical point, and hosts regain consciousness as Zombies.\n\nZombies created from the t-Virus are not as weak as Progenitor Zombies due to the t-Virus being less lethal than Progenitor. A t-Zombie's outward necrosis appears more severe, but it actually doesn't affect muscle strength. An increase in growth hormone causes Zombies to grow taller - the average Zombie height is 6 feet, 5 inches. This is 8 inches taller than an average adult male. They do not seem to weigh any more than a normal human being despite this.\n\nZombie skin is most heavily damaged, turning pale and cracking. Rashes will sometimes remain on the skin from the stages prior to Zombification. Exposed muscle (and even bone) is commonly seen as the skin rots and peels. A common area to peel away is the skin surrounding the mouth, causing Zombies (and sometimes Tyrants) to lose their lips. The extensive skin damage caused by the t-Virus caused many Raccoon City medical professionals to mistake it for a mere skin disease.\n\n​\n\nZombie eyes become glazed over and turn a milky white, with the pupil sometimes completely covered by cataracts or a pale-blue haze. The extent of this clouding varies greatly, sometimes affecting the entire eye and sometimes only the pupil. When the process of decomposition begins in a human body, one of the first visible changes (beginning within 10 minutes of death) is to the eye, which clouds over as a result of the corneas becoming deprived of fluid or oxygen as circulation is cut off. If a diseased person's eyes are open at the time of death, film/clouding can begin to cover them in mere minutes as they dry up faster. Despite this, the cells that make up the eye are actually able to survive and remain functional longer than most of the tissues in a corpse, and as such Zombies usually retain their sight to some extent. In a script for the first Resident Evil game, Zombie eyes were described as \"dried and barely functioning\" (credit: Nóra). Any hindrance to their vision is compensated with extra-sensitive hearing and an enhanced sense of smell. Zombies likely retain their sense of taste as well.\n\n​\n\n​Internal organs are heavily affected by necrosis as well. The circulatory and respiratory systems (heart and lungs) are completely shut down, making Zombies clinically dead. They no long breathe, allowing them to survive being buried (seen in Resident Evil 3), submerged in water (Resident Evil), and exposed to smoke or many dangerous gases like nerve gas (The Bewitching Beast of the North Sea). How they survive without oxygen is a mystery, although it could be related to glycolysis, as theorized in the Biology of Evil. Glycolysis is a metabolic pathway that allows cells to obtain ATP (high-energy molecules that drive processes in living cells) from nutrients without using oxygen. Umbrella’s recombination experiments with the t-Virus could have given the virus extra copies of the genes relative to glycolysis from multiple different animals (leeches, spiders, dogs, and even humans), essentially multiplying the effect. It may be that Zombies essentially cannibalize themselves, with the living cells feeding off of the dead ones. This would both contribute to the necrosis symptom and make feeding all the more important to stave off the host from literally eating itself.\n\nThe lack of blood circulation (hemostasis) is also what leads to the eyes of Zombies almost immediately becoming hazed over and losing visible color. It also likely contributes to the discoloration of their skin. Zombie blood is usually coagulated, with open wounds bleeding very little.\n\n​\n\nThe reproductive system of a Zombie is also destroyed, making all Zombies infertile. Any reproductive instincts are removed, although their desire to bite humans does serve as an equivalent.\n\nAs a result of their subcutaneous fat rotting, Zombies carry a permanent, repulsive smell, which could in itself serve to debilitate and distract prey. Despite not needing to breathe, they were also capable of exhaling a lukewarm miasma characterized by the smell of rot and gastric juices. The ghastly appearance of Zombies also serves to intimidate and stun targets, and makes them attractive for bioterrorists whose aim is to instill terror.\n\n​​Due to widespread cell death, Zombies generally lack essential molecules like ATP. Because of this, Zombies ordinarily do not mutate beyond their general human form, as they lack the energy to do so, unless they can gain enough nutrition from feeding.\n\nUnlike other bodily systems, the digestive system is heavily strengthened to accommodate the intense hunger of Zombies. They begin to produce large amounts of highly corrosive stomach acid able to quickly break down flesh. They produce so much, in fact, that Zombies periodically vomit excess amounts from the body. They will attempt to direct this acid at prey, giving Zombies a valuable weapon against out of reach targets. Zombies may even use this acid in order to soften prey to make consumption easier, similar to fly behavior. In Operation Raccoon City, this bile instead obscures the vision of those vomited on, allowing Zombies to stun and confuse their faster prey.\n\nZombie brain scan from Inside of Biohazard by BSAArklay\n\nZombie brains are devastated by necrosis, leaving much of the brain completely inactive/paralyzed. In particular, the cerebral neocortex is most heavily damaged, which is the part of the mammalian brain most responsible for higher brain functions like cognition, language, and fine motor control (this is perhaps why non-mammalian hosts are not as heavily damaged by the virus). This necrotizing is a gradual process, with the host losing their humanity and intelligence gradually following infection. The parts of the brain still active will develop abnormally (sections of the thalamus, midbrain, limbic system, and hypothalamus) in order to compensate for the lost sections, and metabolism is promoted to an unnecessary level. The autonomic nervous system is largely left intact in general. All former personality, emotions, and higher reasoning are wiped away entirely, as are most memories. Zombies are a \"kind of brain dead, their actions limited merely to simple survival activity along with instinct. As a result, they move to the feeling of starvation and are a sad existence wandering in a quest for food\" (Biohazard Director's Cut Inside of Biohazard). Zombie intelligence is overall comparable to that of an insect, with their behavior being completely bereft of thought.\n\nDue to damage to the neocortex and potentially other areas of the cerebellum or even the frontal lobe, a Zombie's fine motor control is heavily affected. This results in Zombie movements being slow, clumsy, and erratic. The exact level of mobility from Zombie-to-Zombie alternates greatly. On rare occasions some will even experience irregular bouts of speed, possibly as a result of stimuli like the smell of prey or loud noises, before regressing back to slow movements. Others on even rarer occasions still possess enough agility to climb a chain-link fence.\n\nZombies are ordinarily not intelligent or coordinated enough to use tools or weapons, although they have used the latter in Gaiden, a cutscene in The Darkside Chronicles, and in The Experience (although a variant strain may well have been at work in The Experience). Zombies sometimes retain enough memory to keep some habits, and will commonly mill about places familiar to them as humans. Some Zombies retain enough muscle memory to operate a door handle and open doors. When not in pursuit of prey or attacking, Zombies will usually wander aimlessly. They lack any sense of fear, and have almost no self-preservation instincts beyond feeding and conserving energy.\n\nMost Zombies are incapable of articulating speech, and will instead moan and growl. Advanced Zombies in modern times sometimes mutter simple phrases, and even t-Virus Zombies have been known to speak words relevant to the situation, implying not only some memory retention, but perhaps some degree of remaining self-awareness. This was seen with Zombie Brad Vickers in the reimagining of Resident Evil 3, who actually apologized to Marvin Branagh. In Pachislot, Zombie Forest Speyer begged Chris Redfield to kill him.\n\n​Zombie pain receptors are also inactive due to the damage to their nervous systems. Losing limbs, being shot, or being set on fire will not deter them. Instead, all they feel is hunger.\n\nZombies are in a constant state of starvation due to their metabolism being critically high and constantly active. In order to support their oxygen-deprived bodies, they must eat constantly. As infected flesh is stripped bare of nutrients, Zombies prefer to devour the flesh of uninfected hosts. As they grow more desperate, they will however resort to cannibalism. Zombies (beyond Crimson Heads) are very rarely ever seen attacking each other, and they instead feed on dead or prone Zombies (the latter of which don't even seem to notice). Zombies appear to be able to distinguish humans from other Zombies using their sense of smell, as they are drawn to the rich scent of oxygenated blood (it is implied Zombies will also drink blood). Zombies may even go into a frenzy when a target bleeds profusely, similar to shark behavior.\n\nOddly, Zombies not only prefer uninfected humans over other Zombies, but they generally prefer humans over other animals in general. It is unknown if there is a distinct biological reason for this, or if it is due to \"an inherent hidden dark side of humans themselves\" (Inside of Biohazard). The latter would imply that in their brain damaged state, Zombies revert to some subconscious behavior dormant inside all human minds...\n\nSome Zombies will lie on the ground and play dead, biting the ankles of unsuspecting victims. This is not an indication of intelligence, but of primal instincts located in the reptilian part of the brain. These are called \"Playing Dead Zombies\". Zombies on the verge of starvation will also lie on the ground in order to conserve energy, and these individuals are distinguished by the title \"Lying Zombies\". \"Crawling Zombie\" are Zombies whose legs have decayed to the point that they are incapable of walking and will instead crawl towards prey using their arms.\n\nDue to their outstanding vitality, Zombies are impossible to kill unless the brain itself is destroyed/removed, or the body is totally incinerated. Zombies can also starve to death. They will not bleed to death due to their inactive circulatory system. Even a bullet to the brain of a Zombie is not a guaranteed kill, as much of the brain is dead anyway. Destroying the brain stem is the safest and most reliable way to cease activity in a Zombie, as this may destroy the autonomic nervous system. Total decapitation is also a reliable way to ensure death in a Zombie. Breaking through the neck of a Zombie is sometimes enough to cease activity, but only if the connection to the brain is totally severed. Hanging prior to transformation into a Zombie is not a reliable preventative measure. Raccoon City Hospital doctors were also unable to kill t-Virus hosts using chemical euthanasia. Zombies can also resist fire to a certain extent, and will even continue to attack prey while engulfed in flames, making their attacks especially deadly. Soaking a Zombie in kerosene or other forms of fuel can ensure that Zombie bodies will be burned to the point of death.\n\nDespite their decayed appearance, Zombies are actually stronger than normal humans. While this is largely due to the t-Virus altering their genetic structure and strengthening their muscle tissue, their lacking a sensation of pain also leads to them expending more effort than a normal animal would. They will often strike at prey with their arms in order to prevent them from resisting being fed on, with their scratches sometimes being capable of transmitting the t-Virus. Zombies mistaken for dead by humans and buried underground are even capable of digging out of their graves, so long as they are close enough to the surface. Despite this, excessive rotting can also make Zombie bodies relatively fragile and more susceptible to being torn apart with ease. There is very little consistency in regards to how strong a Zombie's body will be, and the biology of the host, time spent infected, and strain of the virus used are all relevant factors.\n\nZombies are incapable of understanding commands or being trained, making their purpose as soldiers practically naught. Instead, Zombies are used in the same fashion as one might use a bomb - to start a chain reaction of infection that will devastate a population of people: a single Zombie will bite a single human and create a second Zombie. Then the two Zombies will each bite another person, resulting in four Zombies. The four Zombies will then become eight, then sixteen, and so on. The end result is Zombie numbers multiplying exponentially. This is especially likely in areas with a high population of people, and even more so when among civilians who lack the knowledge or skills to properly kill Zombies. If an organization wanted to destroy an enemy base, they could infect a POW (prisoner of war), release them, and let them transform into a Zombie while inside enemy territory. Then once the base would be wiped out, the Zombies would eventually starve to death and the base could be captured with minimal effort. As stated earlier, Zombies are also useful as a tool for terrorists to promote fear.\n\n​While Zombies are not as clever or as unpredictable as humans, their lack of pain, emotion, and fear makes them impossible to defeat using traditional warfare, which usually relies on demoralizing an enemy force and weakening them until they surrender. Zombies can only be stopped through containment or complete eradication.\n\nIt should be noted that early on in the Resident Evil series, the t-Virus (then called the \"T-Virus\") actually caused hosts to experience a drop in metabolism, not an increase in it. Zombies rotted and were constantly starving at this point because the chemical processes that maintain the human body were largely inactive or slowed. This plot point was eventually retconned by later releases but was reused for the Afflicted created by the t-Phobos Virus.\n\nZombie Variants\n\nThere is usually a great deal of consistency regarding how each individual Zombie will operate, but some alternate types have existed due to differences in how they were created:\n\n​Most t-Zombies are slow and lack the coordination to pursue human prey over large distances, and the phenomenon of Zombies running is very rare. However, some extremely rare Zombies were capable of making faster, more complicated movements on a regular basis. Two examples of these Zombies would be Zombie Forest Speyer and the Doctor/Anatomist Zombie on Rockfort Island. Both of these Zombies also had an even greater level of vitality when compared to normal Zombies, with their bodies being more resistant to ballistic trauma. The reason for this may be the hosts being more compatible with the t-Virus than ordinary Zombies, but not enough to become Tyrants or superhumans. One Zombie, which was formerly the captain of the Spencer Rain (\"Captain Zombie\") also possessed greater vitality than normal, but its movement speed was no greater than that of an ordinary Zombie.\n\nEarly strains of t could not revive corpses, but more advanced strains unlocked this ability. Undead Zombies were indistinguishable from living ones. These were, according to one source, encountered by Claire Redfield on Rockfort Island, when a unique strain was carried by rainwater into shallow graves, causing the corpses there to reanimate.\n\nIn Resistance, multiple Zombie variants created by the Umbrella Corporation were depicted. While the canonicity of Resistance is negligible, and while certain Zombie aspects are purely the result of gameplay buffs and upgrades, some special enemy types are still interesting to take note of. Special thanks to kingsaigon for help in finding this information.\n\nJesters were Resistance Zombies that were named for their being dressed like clowns. They could let out a loud screech that stunned humans, much like the Shrieker Zombies created by the C-Virus.\n\nDealers were Resistance Zombies dressed as the kind of card-dealers seen in casinos. They ran especially fast.\n\nDuring the Raccoon City destruction incident, Umbrella provided the Raccoon Police Department survivors with a special gas called P-Z, which was supposed to harm Zombies. Instead, this gas caused mutations in Zombies that heightened their combat abilities. Poisonous Zombies created by P-Z constantly exhaled a purple gas that could poison prey. It seems the otherwise inactive lungs were repurposed to produce this gas. Some would expel a large poison cloud when the body was ruptured. Besides damaging the human body when inhaled, this poison also caused coughing fits that would progressively get worse until it was treated. Poisonous Zombies were distinguishable by their purple skin and glowing eyes.\n\nThis reaction is likely related to the Poison Ivy, which was created by a t-Virus B.O.W. being exposed to the P-ε - gas (see \"t-Virus Countermeasures\" section for information on P-ε, and the \"Plantae\" section more information on Poison Ivy). \"Z\" may have stood for \"Zombie\", while the \"P\" likely denoted that it was a derivative of P-ε. The Poisonous Zombies' purple coloration and ability to produce poison gas were shared by Poison Ivy. Umbrella's intention in the creation of P-Z may have been:\n\nTo harm Zombies in particular, with the creation of Poisonous Zombies being a completely unintended side-effect.\n\nTo increase Zombie deadliness. In this case, it is highly likely that Umbrella created P-Z using data obtained on Poison Ivys and used said data to replicate the poison effect in non-plant hosts. Umbrella would have given this gas to the survivors in order to both further compromise their safety and to gather data on the results of P-Z exposure in a live test.\n\nPoisonous Zombies originally only appeared in Ghost Survivors mode in Resident Evil 2 Reimagined. While Ghost Survivors is not canon, it shares the same setup and world as the canonical depiction of the Raccoon depiction, and so Poison Zombies could have actually existed within the city. This is supported by Pale Heads, which were also originally Ghost Survivor-exclusive enemies that later appeared in the main game for Resident Evil 3 Reimagined. Poisonous Zombies appear in Resistance as well. It is shown in this depiction that the P-Z gas works on Zombie subspecies too, such as Detonators and even the NE-α Zombies.\n\nGun Survivor 2 featured Zombie variants that also produced poison gas. Umbrella Researcher Zombies would scatter this gas upon being killed. It is unknown if these Zombies created the gas like Poisonous Zombies did, or if the researchers they once were carried containers of the gas.\n\n​Advanced Zombies have also been created by other strains of the Progenitor Virus, such as G, ​C, A, and Kodoku. The only Progenitor-based virus that hasn't been shown to create Zombie-like mutants is t-Veronica, although its effects on corpses (if any) have yet to been seen.\n\n​The Zombie mutation is not limited to humans and is actually common in mammalian hosts. Infected mammals are generally considered Zombies due to severe necrosis giving them the appearance of undead creatures and due to their ravenous appetite for uninfected flesh created by metabolic changes. Most if not all Zombie animals experience a smaller amount of brain damage than human hosts, allowing them to retain some intelligence, fine motor control, and the sensation of pain. Many Zombie animals that are smaller than humans (like dogs, monkeys, bats and rats) also experience less muscle degeneration in general. This is because their bodies require less energy to operate, giving them a better grip on their heightened metabolisms.\n\nCanine - While canines become Zombies following infection with the t-Virus, the effects of the virus are far less damaging on their bodies. Canine brains and muscles are left intact, allowing infected dogs and wolves to hunt, run, and jump as they did prior to Zombification. Outward signs of decay are just as dramatic as in human hosts, but internal damage is limited. In the Resident Evil remake, mutated dogs can even be seen breathing, indicating that at least the respiratory system is still functioning. While their eyes are usually glazed over or bloodshot, any damage to their eyesight would be offset by the fact canines rely more on their senses of hearing and smell. Like human Zombies, their overall size is somewhat greater than normal following infection.\n\nZombie canine muscle mass is strengthened along with general vitality, although their bodies are not quite as resistant to damage as the larger Zombie humans. They compensate for this with their speed, agility, and natural weapons (claws and sharp teeth). As canines attack prey by jumping from a low stance, they are also harder to hit than humanoid targets. Their extreme aggression and incredible hunger brought about by metabolic changes makes them very dangerous to humans and Zombies alike. Their muscular strength and combative instincts are also strengthened dramatically by the virus. They lack any sense of fear, and their pain tolerance is higher, if not outright numbed like human Zombies. This makes them relentless pursuers and merciless attackers.\n\n​\n\nInfected canines retain their hunting and pack instincts after infection, like group tactics and ambush techniques, as well as virtually all of their intelligence. Their combative instincts are even said to be increased significantly following infection, indicating either sensory or even neurological enhancements. Canines also retain their memories following infection, including training. Despite their intelligence, their actions are still primarily governed by their hunger for flesh.\n\n​\n\nDogs have been bred and trained for use in warfare by humans for thousands of years. As they are already \"living weapons\" in this sense, they were an obvious choice for Umbrella in the creation of B.O.W.s.\n\n​Dogs intentionally modified by Umbrella using the t-Virus for use as B.O.W.s are called Cerberus (MA-39), named after the guardian of the gates to Hades in Greek mythology. They have also been given called \"Hellhounds\", which means demons in the form of dogs. The term Cerberus can refer to any dog breed infected via primary injection. Dogs infected through secondary infection (drinking tainted water, consuming infected flesh, or even being directly bitten by a virus carrier) are instead referred to as Zombie Dogs.\n\nDue to infected dogs retaining all of their training, Cerberuses are controllable as B.O.W.s when based on military dogs. Many Cerberuses were also created by cloning other Cerberuses, which means that they can be trained after already becoming monsters as well. A trained Cerberus can be made to act on several commands at once. Their enhanced abilities and ferociousness make them more effective weapons than ordinary attack dogs, while their natural social skills allowed them to make coordinated attacks with their companions to a degree greater than most B.O.W.s outside of the Hunter. This, combined with how cheap they are to produce, has made them desirable weapons even now, as they were used during the attack on TRICELL HQ and in other modern bioterror attacks. But the intense hunger in Cerberuses must be maintained if control is to be asserted.\n\nUmbrella based their Cerberus line on Doberman pinchers, and although a Saint Bernard variant was planned as well, it was scrapped due to the incident at the Arklay Mansion disrupting research. A group of Cerberuses were supposed to be tested for their practicality in combat in the mansion courtyard, but due to the psychosis of their infected keeper, their feeding was neglected, and the dogs managed to escape their cages in desperation. While some of these Cerberuses hung around the courtyard due to their memories of the area, others escaped into the surrounding forest and began attacking hikers and campers in the Arklay Mountains. This is what largely attracted the attention of the media in Raccoon City, forcing the RPD to send S.T.A.R.S. to investigate the area. Strange howls could be heard in the area due to roaming, wild Cerberus packs.\n\nDoberman Cerberus embryos were taken from the Mansion by Birkin, cloned, and later sold on the black market. Because of this, all known instances of Cerberus B.O.W.s in bioterror included the use of Dobermans.\n\nDoberman pinchers were also used for the Raccoon Police department's K-9 unit, due to the suggestion of RPD Chief Brian Irons. During the Raccoon City Destruction Incident, many if not all of these dogs became infected with the virus and transformed into Zombie Dogs. Despite being the same breed as the base used for Umbrella's Cerberuses, they lacked the same advanced military training, making them slightly less lethal. They still were based on excellent police dogs, and so their physical abilities and agility were greater than they would be if they were based on normal dog.\n\nDuring the t-Virus outbreak caused by Vincent Goldman on Sheena Island, dogs that appeared to be Dobermans became Zombies as well. These dogs were comprised of both police or military dogs and stray dogs from the area.\n\nDobermans were also kept as guard dogs at Rockfort Island and were also infected when HCF caused the t-Virus to leak in that area. These dogs had military training, and so despite them being irregular mutants their abilities were on par with Cerberuses.\n\nDoberman pinchers have a variety of sizes: they can be anywhere from 22-26 inches long and are most commonly 24-28 inches tall. Following infection with the t-Virus, Dobermans could grow so large as to be 29 inches long (75cm) and 39 inches tall (100cm).\n\nNormal Doberman pinchers weight 55-100 pounds, while infected ones can weigh as much as 172 pounds. This increase in weight is likely due to Zombie Dog muscle tissue being transformed and replaced with superior, ultra-dense alternatives, giving them greater strength. Zombie Dogs will use their weight against their foes in combat - a Zombie Dog will pounce onto prey and impose its entire body weight onto them, pinning them down as it eats away at its prey's throat. When multiple Cerberuses attacked a single target, they would circle their prey and attack in waves without providing their prey any opportunity to rest, wearing them down. Other times they would bite down on a person's hand, restricting their movement and giving other Cerberuses an opportunity to attack. They would actively attempt to lunge at prey from the blind spots in the prey's vision. They were excellent at killing even the most skilled human combatants, like S.T.A.R.S. officers Edward Dewey and Joseph Frost.\n\nWhile the maximum running speed of Zombie Dogs is not affected too much by their weight gain due to their improved muscles, they do run approximately 3 miles-per-hour slower. Zombie Dog jumping abilities are still impressive, and they can easily clear tall fences by leaping over them or even by climbing. Humans in outbreak zones who learn to survive encounters with slow, clumsy Zombies by using their mobility are still at risk of being overtaken by Zombie Dogs. The relatively thin legs of Zombie Dogs do provide a weakness to them, however, and it is easy for armed humans to cause them to trip when running by shooting them in the legs.\n\nAdded by BSAARKLAY; Image on the left. According to the Biohazard Remake website Cerberus would attack as a team, one demanding the preys attention while the other circles and attacks from the side much like Velociraptor's from Jurassic Park. Image on the right shows concept art that the Cerberus breed was originally going to be Saint Bernard. Finally in Biohazard Remake the Cerberus at one stage were going to be replaced by infected Bears.\n\nZombie Wolves were encountered in the Caucasus region in 2003, due to the t-Virus leaking from an Umbrella facility nearby. Zombie Wolves displayed abilities seemingly identical to Zombie Dogs, but of course had no combat training outside of their natural instincts.\n\nFeline - Hyenas, Lions, and many other animals held at the Raccoon Zoo in Raccoon City became Zombies once their water supply became contaminated with the t-Virus. Many mutated animals escaped their cages and exhibits, and roamed the zoo grounds preying on humans, Zombies, and each other. Due to a streetcar stop in front of the zoo being a designated evacuation point for survivors of the ongoing outbreak, infected animals did not need to venture far from this area, as they had a steady supply of food come to them.\n\nZombie Hyenas wandered several locations in the Raccoon Zoo. They were extremely similar to Zombie Dogs, due to hyenas being closely related to canines. Zombie Hyena intelligence, instincts, and fine motor were not diminished. Their outward symptoms of necrosis were minimal, and no tearing of the skin was visible. The only thing setting their behavior apart from Zombie Dogs is that their already-impressive agility increased to the point that they could dodge bullets to some extent, although they were slightly less aggressive and erred more on the side of caution. They also lacked any kind of combat training.\n\nThe appearance of the Zombie Hyenas suggested they were based on spotted hyenas, a species that is especially ferocious and social. Spotted hyenas rely on pack hunting over scavenging like other hyenas: Zombie Hyenas retained these habits and social instincts following Zombification and attacked their prey in packs. Like spotted hyenas, Zombie hyenas were apt to prey on humans, especially once their aggression and appetite was amplified by the virus.\n\nIt should be noted that hyenas are not felines in the most technical sense, but are rather \"feliform\", or \"cat-like\". They have much in common with canines (like their relying on their teeth in combat over their claws like cats) but are more closely related biologically to felines. They are essentially a midway point between the two Families.\n\nOne male Lion was a permanent fixture at the Raccoon Zoo, while several female lions had been brought to the location at the time of the outbreak as part of a breeding program that would have lasted until the end of October. All said lions became infected.\n\n​​Zombie Lions were much more powerful than other Zombie quadrupeds due to the natural size and strength of the host species. Lions have extremely dense, powerful muscles wrapped around immense bodies. The bodies of Zombie Lions grew even larger, and their natural abilities were improved. Their bodies experienced more signs of outward necrosis than those of Zombie Hyenas, although like Zombie dogs this did not impede their mobility or intelligence. In addition to some torn flesh, what appeared to be tumor-like growths also formed on their bodies (these could also have been expanded muscles, like those on Eliminators).\n\nStarved Lions are very prone to man-eating, and so Zombie Lions were extraordinarily aggressive towards humans. Unlike Zombie Dogs and Hyenas but like true felines, Zombie Lions used their paws more than their teeth. Their strong muscles made their strikes deadly and capable of knocking humans onto the ground. Zombie Lions largely relied on hit-and-run attacks and used their weight against their prey. They were so agile that they were capable of jumping over tall fences to pursue and hunt human prey. Their thick bodies made them extremely resilient to gunfire.\n\nThree of the Zombie Lionesses (called \"Ferals\" by localization) at the zoo were named \"Silfy\", \"Jennifer\", and \"Angela\". While female lions usually hunt in groups, the Zombie Lionesses were slightly more solitary following infection. They still retained some of their social instincts, however. They were extremely territorial and did not wander much from their preferred hunting grounds, opting instead for prey to come to them. They may have done this to avoid crossing paths with the true apex predator of the Zoo, Oscar.\n\nThe sole male Lion, originally named Max by the Zoo (called \"Stalker\" by localization), was even stronger and more ferocious than the Zombie Lionesses. This is likely because of the sexual dimorphism seen in lions: males tend to be stockier and stronger than females. In the Wild Things/Roar scenario of Outbreak file #2, on hard mode, a single Lioness follows Max. On very hard mode, two Lionesses follow him around, denoting his status as leader of the pride.\n\nA feline monster called \"Mountain Cat\" was originally going to be featured in Resident Evil 3. It was either based on a wildcat (possibly an Andean mountain cat), or on a cougar. It would have to have been an escaped test subject, a released B.O.W., or an animal that escaped the Raccoon Zoo, as both cougars and Andean mountain cats are not native to the midwestern United States. The Mountain Cat was going to appear in the Raccoon Park, where it would hide in the area's bushes in order to ambush prey. It was capable of moving without making any noise but would otherwise make an \"eerie cry\". The fangs of the mountain cat were greatly enlarged, similar to the teeth of a saber-toothed tiger. It appeared to have a human-like body, which could be due to it:\n\nBeing an engineered chimera created by Umbrella.\n\nInheriting human-DNA from the t-Virus.\n\nGaining human traits through recombination after devouring infected human flesh, like the Drain Deimos.\n\nSpecial thanks to Nóra, The Somniloquist, for her translations of the Mountain Cat and other scrapped monster art.\n\nMonkey - James Marcus, in his efforts to create a B.O.W. with enough intelligence to follow orders and excel in combat, performed experiments on large monkeys, due to their naturally high level of intelligence. Marcus attempted to avoid intelligence decline by injecting the virus into a host early in development, so that it could bond with the t-Virus \"on a cellular level\". After injecting a pregnant monkey with t-Marcus, her fertilized egg was infected with the virus. The zygote/embryo adapted to the virus as it developed in the womb. The creature eventually birthed by the mother monkey became a B.O.W. with a moderate level of perfection upon maturing fully. It was named an Eliminator and was replicated through cloning. Eliminators were effective, but mass production was stalled until further development could be made due to them only being capable of following simple commands. Eliminators proved to Marcus that mammalian hosts were his best chance at creating intelligent B.O.W.s, and instead of further developing the Eliminators he moved on to human research. However, the Queen Leech created a small army of them many years later (or the Investigation Team sent to the Executive Training Facility created or transported new Eliminators), and Umbrella approved them for mass production by 2003 due to its desperate state at the time.\n\nEliminators avoided most necrosis symptoms despite being one of the earliest B.O.W.s ever created due to them both circumventing rapid mutation and having a more stable metabolism. This is owing to the first Eliminator being able to bond with the virus as it developed in its mother's womb. The Cerberus B.O.W. later reached a similar level of perfection due to improvements made to the virus itself, allowing more mammals to have a positive reaction to the virus even when injected as fully-formed adults. Eliminators experienced almost no brain damage and retained both their intelligence and fine motor control. Amazingly, they even experienced an increase in intelligence. They were the first B.O.W.s that could be trained to follow orders, albeit only simple ones. They also seemed to cooperate with each other to some extent. Despite their metabolism otherwise being stable, Eliminators still experienced a constant sensation of starvation, which made them extremely aggressive and dangerous to handle.\n\nBased on their appearance and lack of tails, it is likely that Eliminators were based on Barbary Macaques. They were 69cm tall, 60.8cm wide, and 53cm long. While Eliminators did not experience any necrosis of the skin, their muscles increased in size to a point where rips appeared in the skin, with some enlarged muscle tissue becoming exposed. While they avoided brain, skin, and internal damage, they still experienced some degree of necrosis in their eyeballs, harming their eyesight. Their hearing became more advanced to compensate for this. Eliminators always bared their fangs, which could be a result either of their aggression or their lips rotting off (which happens with many Zombies). They all had white fur; Reen Hearst theorized that this could have been due to the stress of their mutation, something supported by the Vârcolac creatures having white hair for the same reason. They had very long, sharp canine teeth, like Barbary Macaques, and developed sharp claws following infection.\n\nEliminator muscle tissue was not only over-developed but augmented to an almost impossible level. This is due to the virus' effects on metabolism \"acting effectively\". These muscles made Eliminators extremely strong, agile, and resistant to damage. They could run and leap at breakneck speeds as they attempted to bite and scratch at potential prey. Their vitality was so great that they could sometimes even withstand being hit by a shotgun blast. The Eliminators' ability to seek out and kill targets with intelligence and skill earned them their name, and they functioned well when hunting down outbreak survivors (although they were later surpassed in this area by the Hunter B.O.W.).\n\n​Resident Evil 1.5 originally had Monkey enemies as well. These creatures were enlarged by the virus, so that had the appearance of oversized gorillas (gorillas are not monkeys). These primates may have escaped from the Raccoon Zoo, although due to their presence in the backs of trucks and in Raccoon City's underground lab, they were more likely escaped test subjects or B.O.W.s. They used their incredible strength to smash prey, and their agility to corner and confuse them. They were missing patches of fur due to necrosis, and lacked tails, (either due to them being based on a tailless monkey species like Eliminators, or due to them losing their tails as their flesh rotted).\n\nIn early concept art for the Resident Evil 1.5 Monkey, they had a \"bright red howl sack\", which grew in size when the Monkeys growled. This was likely meant to be the same throat sack utilized by some apes. If this was meant to imply that 1.5 Monkeys were actually based on apes, then the \"Monkey\" was not a monkey at all. Some of this art does show Monkeys possessing tails, which could mean that they simply developed a howl sack as a result of mutation brought about by the virus.\n\nThis same art depicted Monkeys as having enlarged teeth and blood vessels, a horn, and as having the entire surface of their backs enclosed in a chrysalid-like shell (which could imply that Monkeys were actually G-Virus mutants, as chrysalids were an early theme for that virus). Thanks to Nora for Monkey art translations.\n\nRat - Zombie Rats were created in the sewers of Raccoon City when vials of the t-Virus were crushed under the weight of G-Birkin's feet. They seemed to retain a somewhat social nature, traveling and attacking prey in lethal swarms (including an injured member of the Umbrella Security Service). Due to them losing a turf war with infected roaches, the Zombie Rat population of Raccoon fled to the surface, indicating they retained some sense of fear and self-preservation. A swarm of infected rats made it into the city's water supply, which resulted in Racoon's drinking water being tainted by the t-Virus.\n\nBat - Bats living at the Arklay Mountains, Rockfort Island, and the tunnels of the Caucasus Facility became infected with the t-Virus after feeding on infected insects and plants. Bats sometimes grew slightly in size following infection, with smaller ones likely being a different species. They typically did not experience any outward signs of necrosis (because of their small size and low energy consumption), making them difficult to distinguish from normal bats. Their vitality was not enhanced much, and they could typically be killed by a single bullet from a small-caliber handgun.​\n\nThe diet of Bats consisted primarily of the blood of humans and other animals. Vampire bats are the only natural species of bat that are not insectivores or herbivores, yet they are only native to Central and South America. The t-Virus was capable of completely changing the diets and dietary requirements of the Arklay and Rockfort bats, transforming them into a new, much more dangerous species of vampire bat. Bats had a tendency to lunge at prey as soon as they noticed them, using their sharp fangs to tear off their prey's skin and to suck their blood. Due to their large appetites, they would not stop feeding on prey until they were completely dried of blood.\n\nBats relied on sound over sight, like ordinary bats. Their hearing was actually enhanced by the virus, and they would seek out human prey by listening for the sound of footsteps. Because of this, moving targets were at a greater risk of being attacked by Bats. Besides their increase in aggression and dietary changes, Bat behavior was mostly the same following transformation. They had a preference for dark, damp, environments, and were not active at daytime or in bright areas.​ They sometimes possessed a fear of open flames (a peculiarity, considering most t-Virus hosts lose their sense of fear). Bats retained their social instincts, and often fought in massive colonies, \"circling the skies as one organism\". Their ability to fly made them dangerous transmission vectors for the virus. In The Umbrella Chronicles, infected Bats were slower than infected crows.\n\nSouth American Bats encountered during Operation: Javier also became infected with the t-Virus after sucking on the nectar of infected flowers. Their behavior, abilities, and diet were the same as other Bat species infected with the t-Virus, although they were active during the daytime. Their appearance was altered significantly by the virus, which could have been due to their species having a unique reaction to the virus. They developed large, swollen growths on their heads, possibly tumors formed from faulty regeneration. They also had drooped ears and blueish wings with enlarged blood vessels running through them.\n\nAt least two bats underwent a unique mutation and grew monstrous in size. They were simply referred to as “Infected Bats” (whereas normal bats infected with the virus were referred to as “Bats”). One of these creatures made its nest at the church behind Umbrella's Executive Training Facility, while the other lived in the tunnels connected to the Caucasus Facility. The first was killed by Rebecca Chambers and/or Billy Coen, while the second was killed by Albert Wesker.\n\nThe Infected Bats were 220cm (over 7ft) tall and had an incredible wingspan of 760cm (almost 25ft long), with each of their wings being approximately 3 meters/10ft long. Their skeletal systems (particularly their sternums) and muscles were further developed and enhanced to the point that they fully retained their flying abilities. They could not only fly with as much speed and agility as a normal bat, but they were strong enough to grab human prey with their legs and lift them into the air. Their enhanced bodies also made Infected Bats extremely durable and resistant to gunfire, and their speed when flying was so great that it was difficult for armed humans to hit them with guns in the first place. Like most creatures, their heads were a weak point.\n\nThey had red eyes and enlarged teeth. Their outward flesh was noticeably decayed, as a result of their bigger bodies consuming more energy than the smaller Bats.\n\nInfected Bats were just as social and intelligent as their smaller brethren and assumed a sort of leadership role in Bat swarms, with the smaller Bats following around the giant ones. Infected Bats could call for additional swarms of Bats using soundwaves outside the perceivable range of humans. Infected Bats used the small Bats to distract and weaken their prey. Instead of drinking blood, Infected Bats would devour meat, likely in order to fuel their larger bodies.\n\nThe size and strength of Infected Bats is attributed to them being individuals that were highly combatable with the virus, similar to how specific genes were required for humans to become Tyrants with earlier strains of the t-Virus. In this sense, Infected Bats were to Bats what Tyrants were to Zombies. This is particularly interesting in relation to the role of Infected Bats as \"leaders\" in Bat swarms, as the T-002 was originally envisioned as having the ability to control Zombies. They have also been described as being Bats that \"evolved further\".\n\nHorse – Zombie Horses were a planned enemy for Resident Evil 3, which were ultimately scrapped. These horses would grow considerably larger than most Zombie animals, standing at around four meters tall (nearly twice as tall as the largest documented horse in history). They were large and heavy enough to crush human prey with a single leg. As horses lack sharp teeth, they may have trampled their prey into an easy-to-digest mush before using their gigantic mouths to feed on them.\n\nElephant - Oscar was a performing elephant and the highlight of the Raccoon City Zoo. He became infected with the t-Virus before the outbreak fully broke out across the city, likely due to his water supply being tainted by the leaked virus. Oscar's keeper noted that during feeding time, the elephant became so excited that he broke part of his cage. Oscar did not appear to be sick to the keeper at this time, and so he would still have to have been in the earlier stages of infection. Eventually, Oscar transformed into a Zombie Elephant (called \"Titan\" by localization) and escaped confinement. Oscar was originally good natured but following Zombification he became vicious. His diet switched from herbivorous to carnivorous, and he roamed the zoo in search of food due his metabolism being affected by the virus.\n\nOscar's flesh was highly decayed, and his skeleton and tusks grew abnormally (his back was curved and uneven, suggesting his spine was deformed). His body, already gigantic, grew in size further, making him larger than any modern land animal. This gave him outstanding vitality and strength but further contributed to his high metabolism, making him attack Zombies and humans alike. His level of aggression seemed to alternate, perhaps due to how much hunger he experienced at any one period of time.\n\nDespite his huge size he retained his mobility following Zombification. He shrieked wildly as he ran, destroying obstacles and upturning cars with his incredible strength. He was agile enough to leap and climb over tall fences. ​Oscar retained enough memory to be lured by the theme music used during an old zoo parade, which Oscar was the star of for years. He also seemed to recognize the zoo and remained within its boundaries, like how Zombie humans and dogs would sometimes remain in areas familiar to them when they weren't infected.\n\nOscar primarily attacked by trampling and stomping his prey underfoot. Oscar could use his trunk to pick up human-sized prey and either throw them or put them towards his mouth for consumption. Oscar would also swing his trunk at targets, using it as a weapon. He would break holes in the walls of buildings and smash through windows in order to reach potential human prey inside. Some smashed cages for zoo exhibits could imply that Oscar attempted to grab at other animals, and that this is how creatures such as Zombie Hyenas managed to escape confinement. These cages were ripped open at an angle too high for the animals inside to have done it.\n\nWhile Oscar could absorb an extreme amount of damage, he still retained his sense of pain, and could be stunned. The inside of his mouth was more vulnerable to gunfire than his thick hide.\n\nAves - Besides mammals, birds also become Zombie-like after infection. Birds usually become infected with the t-Virus after eating the flesh of infected corpses. Skin necrosis is indeed present but is undetectable due to feathers covering the body. The only discernible changes to appearance in infected birds are in a small increase in overall size and beak length (due to growth hormone), and the development of red, bloodshot eyes.\n\nLike any other Zombie-like host, birds become mainly carnivorous following infection with the t-Virus, although some also retain the ability to eat plants as a secondary food source. Infected bird behavior is unpredictable. Some flocks rely solely on their natural habits and instincts: they remain in their territory and only attack when provoked or disturbed by rapid movements or loud noises. Some birds will hide in dark environments, and attack prey as soon as they encroach on their territory. Others will not only actively seek out humans to attack but are so desperate as to attack through closed windows. Bird aggression may be dependent on how well fed they are.\n\nWhen attacking, infected birds use their thick, elongated beaks and sharp talons to rapidly stab and slice at prey while hovering above them or make hit-and-run dive-bomb attacks. Their vitality is not much greater than ordinary birds, but they retain enough intelligence to cooperate and attack in groups (crows in particular are naturally one of the smartest animals on Earth). Their ability to fly makes birds extremely dangerous carriers for the virus to infect a wide variety of different organisms. In addition, infected birds \"have a habit of regurgitating prey in isolated areas, accelerating proliferation of the t-Virus.\" This regurgitation may be a result of them overeating or consuming non-digestible materials while they obsessively consume both corpses and live prey. The proliferation in question may be a result of other animals feeding on their contaminated vomit.\n\n​\n\nCrows are the most commonly encountered birds infected with the t-Virus in the Resident Evil series; in particular, the jungle crows located in the Arklay Mountains region, and the crows present in the forests surrounding the city on Sheena Island. Normal crows will only attack humans during breeding season to protect their chicks, but Crows mutated by the t-Virus were made much more aggressive.\n\nInfected Crows will sometimes (in the original Resident Evil) grow to a height of 1.8ft, which is approximately 1.6 inches taller than a normal crow. Other Crows (in Resident Evil 0) are 30cm tall, with a wingspan of 140cm and a length of 75cm. While normal crows only weigh around 1.4 pounds at most, infected crows will sometimes weigh a whopping 15 pounds. This increase in weight would have to be due to a crow's natural bone and muscle tissue being replaced with highly-dense, powerful alternatives. This would also explain how infected crows can continue to fly despite weighing so much. This added weight would also make crow attacks more devastating (and accounting for their ability to break through windows) and would make their bodies harder to damage than a normal crow. Infected Crows can fly at a maximum speed of 21 mph; while this is around 4 mph slower than a normal crow, it is still impressive considering their weight. The dark feathers of Crows made them especially dangerous at night, where they could approach prey while blending into the dark.\n\nTropical Hornbill birds kept at the Racoon City Zoo were also infected with the t-Virus. These birds displayed the same symptoms as infected crows but were somewhat larger due to the size of the host species. They were easily identified by their massive, curved beaks, which are synonymous with the hornbill (Bucerotidae) family. They would circle in place before attacking human prey with their beaks. ​The infected Hornbills were outright referred to as Zombies.\n\n​A giant version of an infected bird was originally going to appear in The Darkside Chronicles, in the Operation: Javier scenario. These massive birds were called Kid Nappers. They were larger than humans, and their talons were disproportionately large. They were capable of wrapping their talons around humans and presumably lifting them into the air (hence their name), either to feed on them elsewhere or to drop them from the sky. Kid Nappers were either B.O.W.s engineered by Umbrella or the Rival Org. and sold to the Sacred Snakes crime syndicate, or irregular mutants that experienced a unique reaction to the t-Virus, similar to how some bats grew much larger when exposed to the virus. They could have also been based on a larger species of bird which naturally reacted differently to the t-Virus than crows or hornbills. If they were B.O.W.s, then they may have been based on the data recovered on the crow mutants from the Arklay Mansion.\n\nWhile Zombies mainly represent hosts that fail to \"bond\" with the virus, they are not truly an evolutionary dead-end. If the t-Virus remains active in a Zombie for an extended period of time, and if the Zombie obtains enough nutrition from human flesh, a Zombie may undergo further mutations and become a more advanced predator. Continuous viral activity leads to cellular repairs, and the living cells will eventually reproduce and replace the dead ones. In this sense, a Zombie can potentially come \"back to life\" over time. The proliferation of rewritten cells leads to Zombies losing their humanoid form, as the virus is finally capable of acting to the full extent of its abilities in the body. In this way, the Zombie state is actually a temporary one, and only a midway point in the development of superior creatures (\"the Zombie period, when appetites are ramped up, is the time when metabolism is at its highest, and body tissues are being rebuilt in accordance with the action of the T-Virus that produces biological weapons\"; RESEARCH ON BIOHAZRD 2).\n\nHowever, all known strains prior to ε cease activity in the Zombie host after the initial transformation, making further regeneration and mutation impossible until V-ACT was discovered.\n\nV-ACT (Virus Activation) is a process inherent to all viruses derived from Progenitor, including the t-Virus. While commonly associated with Crimson Heads, V-ACT is responsible for most monster transformations after sustaining damage. When a mutant is severely wounded or even killed, the V-ACT process causes the virus to resume activity, and enables \"cellular activation\", reconstructing and reforming tissue while boosting the overall abilities of the creature. Creatures created by the G-Virus may practice V-ACT continually, while creatures created by the t-Virus can only undergo V-ACT once. In this way, V-ACT serves as a trigger for the virus to resume the transformation of its hosts. The resulting mutations are usually directly in response to the environment or the way the Zombie is injured, as a form of spontaneous evolution.\n\nDuring the Mansion Incident, ε mutated and the V-ACT process was \"unlocked\". William Birkin recovered this strain of the virus and used it to upgrade the virus. The new strain (\"t-Birkin\") eliminated the need for a V-ACT trigger: the t-Virus would remain active in a Zombie until every cell was rewritten and restored, with the only prerequisite being time and gaining enough energy from feeding.\n\n​Below are all known examples of Zombies evolving due to the virus completely transforming the host and repairing dead cells:\n\nCrimson Heads\n\nDuring the Mansion Incident, multiple Zombies were shot in the head and left in a near-death state. Due to the virus mutating, these hosts experienced V-ACT while unconscious and transformed into new creatures. The surviving mansion researchers kept these creatures in confinement for further study, and while attempting to feed them their unexpected abilities and ferocity allowed them to kill four researchers. Due to the spot becoming \"a blood bath in an instant\", the creatures were named Crimson Heads (a name which was also in reference to their coloration). All but one of the Crimson Head Prototypes were disposed of due to their risk and the ongoing outbreak. One of the creatures, the Crimson Head Prototype 1 (or \"Proto 1\"), was frozen with cryogenic gas and placed in a suspended coffin by the surviving researchers. The researchers were unwilling to destroy the Proto 1 due to its excellent combat abilities, with it showing promise as a B.O.W.\n\nWhen S.T.A.R.S. officers took refuge in the mansion, they encountered multiple Crimson Heads. An officer belonging to Alpha Team eventually released the Proto 1, and afterwards killed it.\n\nWhen this strain was recovered by Birkin, Crimson Heads were studied and kept at the Caucasus Facility to be sold as products. During the 2003 outbreak at the Caucasus facility, many Crimson Heads dressed as Umbrella researchers roamed the complex, which would imply that the Crimson Head strain of the virus was responsible for the outbreak.\n\nThe time it takes for an incapacitated Zombie to transform into a Crimson Head varies dramatically. The longest known time it can take is approximately 2 hours and a half, while the shortest time is only 5 minutes. Certain variables such as the extent of the damage taken and how old the Zombie was could impact this time frame.\n\nAs V-ACT occurs in Zombie bodies, they enter suspended animation once again. Due to virus activity causing \"cell activation\", their tissue is repaired and their metabolism is improved. Many internal organs are restored as a result, including the circulatory and respiratory systems. Because of this Crimson Heads very noticeably breathe, and their hearts pump blood. This blood becomes reoxygenated and turns a bright red. The skin remains damaged, and the now-running blood seeps through the damaged skin cells, turning their skin blood-red.\n\nExtensive neurological repairs undo prior brain damage, giving Crimson Heads more intelligence, and their motor control is restored, allowing them to run quickly.\n\nAside from repairs, Crimson Heads also mutate further and change form, gaining several Tyrant traits due to the latent effects of the Tyrant Virus. Their muscle mass increases somewhat, giving them enhanced strength and durability. When a Crimson Head rises from the ground, their enhanced leg muscles allow them to hoist themselves up in an unnatural-looking motion, without needing to use their arms. Bone growth is promoted at the tips of their fingers, creating claws. Crimson Heads are extremely deadly, even more-so than most t-Series B.O.W.s, especially so because of their aggression increasing even further. They will kill other Zombies in their way and instantly shatter wooden doors with their claws as they pursue prey. They have been said to attack \"everything that moves\". Their voices are more animalistic and monstrous than ordinary Zombies, indicating changes to the vocal cords.\n\nWhen Crimson Heads breathe, their breath is actually visible, similar to when human breath experiences condensation in cold weather. Not only that, but Crimson Head breath is a unique yellowish color. As noted by USSCMD, this color could be related to the excessive stomach acid of Zombies, which seems to be even more prominent in Crimson Heads (they will vomit acid more often than regular Zombies). It is also possible the lungs of Crimson Heads have mutated to produce some kind of gas, for poisoning prey or spreading the virus. There is a precedence for this with the Poisonous Zombie subspecies.\n\nThe Crimson Head Prototype 1 had much more vitality than a normal Crimson Head, at least by the point that it was encountered by S.T.A.R.S. This is most likely a result of age (or rather, time active following its initial V-ACT transformation). It may be that other, more recent Crimson Heads encountered at the Mansion were comparatively weaker due to their transformation being more recent, with their muscles not fully strengthened by the virus yet. It is also possible that the Proto 1 had a unique reaction to the cryogenic gas used to keep it in suspended animation.\n\nOne source claims the Prototype 1 was actually administered the t-Virus, although judging by other sources and its attire, it is more likely that it was a researcher who was infected when the t-Virus leaked in the mansion water supply.\n\nForest Speyer, as a Zombie, displayed the ferocity and speed of a Crimson Head, but without the claws and red skin. It has been speculated he was attacked by both Zombies and infected Crows, based on bloody handprints leading to his location. This excessive damage during his initial transformation could have triggered premature V-ACT. It is also possible that Forest was simply an ordinary Zombie that was one of the rarer, faster varieties.\n\nIn Operation Raccoon City, Crimson Heads were dropped into Raccoon City by Umbrella during the outbreak, in order to wipe out any survivors and to gather combat data. In this depiction, Crimson Heads had a number of differences, which could imply that they were the result of a new variant strain modified by Umbrella. They are here called \"ORC Crimson Heads\" for the sake of distinguishing them from \"normal\" Crimson Heads.\n\nORC Crimson Heads skipped the suspended animation stage of development - a Zombie that experienced enough damage to trigger V-ACT would transform into an ORC Crimson Head in a matter of mere seconds, without so much as dropping to the ground. This is comparable to the Bloodshots created by the C-Virus, and possibly to Mutant Zombies. ORC Crimson Heads were visually distinguishable from \"standard\" Crimson Heads due to a red \"light\" or gas that constantly emanated from their bodies. This light may have been a way to represent the intense heat generated by their instantaneous transformations. It could also be related to the \"gas\" created when Crimson Heads exhaled.\n\nWhile normal Zombies could transform into ORC Crimson Heads, USS member FOUR EYES could turn humans into Crimson Heads by injecting them with a virus using her hypo gun. These humans would completely skip the Zombie stage when transforming. It may be that the virus she carried was modified to specifically induce the Crimson Head mutation immediately - this is supported by the fact that this strain could also transform normal Zombies into Crimson Heads, even those which were based on a virus different than the V-ACT strain.\n\nZombies and humans transforming into ORC Crimson Heads would jerk and twitch, and their mutation was often accompanied by a whining sound. This sound plays even when music is turned off in Operation Raccoon City, implying it is more than just a musical cue (credit: USSCommand).\n\nCredit to Lunar Indie Studios for the scan\n\nJavier Hidalgo, leader of the Sacred Snakes crime syndicate, injected a strain of the t-Virus he purchased from Umbrella into people who opposed him. These people were transformed into Zombies. Javier performed primitive experiments on these Zombies, and artificially put them into an inactive state/suspended animation, which triggered V-ACT in their bodies. They developed some Crimson Head traits, like reddish skin, small claws, the ability to run, and increased brutality. They were known simply as \"Javier Zombies\".\n\nJavier Zombies had stitching across their skin - leftovers from the rudimentary experiments Javier performed on them - and were covered in restraints which were used with chains to bind them. They were used by Javier as weapons of terror, and as \"watchdogs\" for his private mansion. When intruders approached, he would release them from their shackles to kill anything in the vicinity of the mansion grounds. They were eventually discovered in their underground holding pens by Leon S. Kennedy and Jack Krauser in 2002, during the events of \"Operation: Javier\".\n\nLicker\n\nAfter using the V-ACT strain of Epsilon to create t-Birkin, William Birkin created a more dramatic form of Evolved Zombie. These creatures are Lickers, named by the surviving Raccoon City Police officers during the Raccoon City Destruction Incident for their elongated tongues.\n\nUnlike with Crimson Heads, Zombies do not need to experience V-ACT in order to become Lickers. All that is required is that the Zombies manage to keep up with their hyperactive metabolisms by feeding on large amounts of flesh. As Zombies are in a constant state of starvation and have to compete with other mutated creatures in an outbreak zone, this is rare. When a Zombie does manage to eat enough it is rewarded by becoming a Licker, a far better predator. In this way, Lickers are born as a result of a \"gruesome/fierce competition for survival\".\n\nDue to the virus acting to the full extent of its abilities in the host​, a well-fed t-Birkin Zombie will have every one of its cells reformed on the inside, giving it an appearance so far removed from human that it is difficult to consider it the same species. In a sense, Lickers are the final point in Zombie development, and do not continue to change form after this stage. They appear to be carnivorous animals due to them evolving/adapting to survive (and even thrive) in their harsh environments, in addition to the ability of the t-Virus to transform hosts into \"living weapons\" (although they fall short of Tyrants due to them failing to bond with the virus in the earlier stages of infection).\n\nThe Licker mutation can also be seen as the same process as the Crimson Head mutation, only exaggerated and initiated by a different trigger (feeding in the former, V-ACT in the latter). It would appear that Crimson Heads did not need to gain enough nutrition to fuel their transformation, which could simply be because the Licker transformation was much more severe, and therefore involved the consumption of more energy.\n\nThe transformation of a Zombie into a Licker has been described as being achieved in \"a short period of time\". Resident Evil 2 Reimagined​ was at one point going to feature unique creatures that functioned as an intermediary between Zombies and Lickers. One could choose to still regard this design (seen above) as a true, albeit never seen stage in Licker development. These creatures would have suddenly transformed into Lickers in an instant, similar to how C-Zombies with red eyes will suddenly and instantly transform into Bloodshots (which are the C-Virus version of Lickers).\n\nLickers are generally around 2 meters in length. Like Crimson Heads, Licker skin is left feeble and damaged, while new muscle develops which is larger in size and mass. The very cells of this muscle are said to be enhanced. The skin will eventually peel away, causing their muscular system to become exposed, which effectively replaces the integumentary system (skin). The brain, while it is repaired, swells in size. This gives them greater intelligence than Crimson Heads, but they still fall short of human intelligence due to their minds being \"devastated by distorted transformation\". To make room for the brain the entire upper half of the skull is destroyed, causing it to become exposed. Along with the skull, the already damaged eyes are completely destroyed, making Lickers blind. To compensate, the already considerably high hearing of Zombies is strengthened even further (something perhaps facilitated by the expansion of the brain: particularly, development of the auditory cortex). The nose and outer parts of the ears seem to be destroyed along with the eyes; however, the inner part of the ears likely remain intact.\n\nThe skeletal system of Lickers is completely mutated, turning them into quadrupeds (four-legged animals). Their heightened agility, elongated limbs, and sticky muscle tissue give them incredible climbing abilities. Lickers stick to and move on vertical and suspended surfaces with the ease and grace of a spider. They will often travel through ventilation shafts and ambush prey from surprising locations. Their muscles make a distinctive-but-soft scraping sound when they move along a surface, but aside from this and their breathing, Lickers are silent predators. Lickers can jump from surface-to-surface with great skill and will pounce on their prey like tigers.\n\nThe tongue is the most heavily affected muscle in a Licker's body. Its shape alternates in different appearances, from being flat like a human tongue to being circular and worm-like. It grows to an incredible length, to the point that it can extend farther than the length of its entire body. This could be possible due to the tongue wrapping around internal organs while retracted. The extremely long tongue of a woodpecker wraps around its skull, for example. The end of the tongue takes on a shape resembling a lance. They are both strong enough and sharp enough that Lickers are capable of using their tongues to perform deadly, long-ranged attacks on their prey. They can ensnare or even decapitate humans with a flick of their tongues or use them to reel in corpses while roosting from high points.\n\nLickers develop large bone claws far larger than those seen on Crimson Heads, which resemble talons. Licker claws not only aid in climbing, but are strong enough to tear through metal, stone, and human bone with ease. The rest of a Licker's bones will also grow to the point that some of them will emerge outside of the muscle tissue. This includes the shoulder blades, parts of the ribs, and the tail bone.\n\nA Licker's teeth commonly become jagged and sharp, alternating from just barely sharper than human teeth to enormous blades larger than the teeth of most predatory animals. Licker voices also alternate from high-pitched to deep and guttural. While Lickers do not seem to have noses, they actually have an improved sense of smell. It may be that this is accomplished through developments in the tongue: taste cells actually do contain olfactory receptacles. Lickers also retain their anuses, and Licker-occupied areas will sometimes have piles of feces present. The absence of visible genitalia may imply that Licker reproductive organs atrophy or fall off, although the ability of Licker β to breed could imply this is merely an issue of censorship. It is also possible Licker genitalia retracts in males, similar to many animals.\n\nThanks to their overdeveloped muscles, Lickers are very resilient to damage - far more so than Zombies. Their exposed brains do not make them more susceptible to head damage, which would imply much of the extra mass of the brain serves as redundant tissue that cushions and protects the parts that are actually vital. While small-caliber gunfire does little to Licker bodies, they are especially susceptible to high temperatures and acidic chemicals due to their lack of skin.\n\nThe overall condition of a Licker is much more stable than that of a Zombie, in that their organs are functioning, they breathe, their sense of pain has \"recovered somewhat\", and they do not seem to be in a state of starvation. They are generally more comparable to wild animals than to brain-dead-humans. Despite this, their \"internal brain functions have probably suffered a devastating change from the violent transformation promoted by the T-Virus\" (RESEARCH ON BIOHAZARD 2). While they are less intelligent than humans, they are still much more competent than Zombies and even Crimson Heads and are even social. Lickers will at times stay together in a \"nest\", like the Apple Inn, and will venture out by themselves to hunt. Lickers often make a distinctive hissing noise, which could be a method to intimidate prey, to communicate with other Lickers, or even to achieve some form of echolocation. When a Licker is killed, it may let out a high-pitched scream to alert other Lickers to its location, as well as any nearby Zombies, most likely. Lickers are also intelligent enough to be trained to follow specific commands, issued with specific noises. This combined with their terrifying appearance and combat abilities makes Lickers a popular weapon among bioterrorists.\n\nOn one occasion, a Licker appeared to deliberately destroy a surveillance camera being used by humans. This could have been the result of the Licker retaining enough memory to not only recognize a camera, but to recognize it as a tool used by its prey. However, as Lickers are blind, it is more likely that the Licker was attracted to the sounds or movements made by the camera, and simply destroyed it out of curiosity or annoyance.\n\nIn the Biohazard 2 Official Guide Book, in the Image Story section by Benny Matsuyama, Licker tongues are described as hardening before they strike their prey, instantly becoming a spear in a single stroke. Their flesh is also described as being covered in mucus.\n\nDue to their claws and enhanced musculature, some Umbrella researchers have mistaken Lickers for \"wild\" Tyrants. The similarities between Lickers and Super Tyrants created from the T-103 type are more than coincidental: both creatures are the result of the virus acting to the fullest extent of its ability in the host, and both had their metabolism enhanced by t-Birkin. In this sense, Lickers could be seen as the Zombie equivalent of Super Tyrants - the \"default\" or fully developed form of human hosts exposed to the t-Virus.\n\nOutbreak Licker\n\n​In Outbreak, Lickers were given a redesigned appearance, which was also later reused in The Umbrella Chronicles. These Lickers were shown to retain a weakened, thin layer of skin. They were much smaller in appearance, with spindly limbs instead of overdeveloped ones. They also lacked claws or a sharpened tongue. Their fingers were elongated, and they seemed to only possess four digits on each foot/hand. They used their tongues a whips instead of piercing weapons. They attacked in larger numbers, and protected the unique Suspended mutant.\n\nWhile this design of Licker may only represent a different style from a design standpoint, the larger, normal appearance for Lickers is also found in models extracted from the Outbreak disk. This could imply that these small Lickers are actually meant to be a different type, that at one point was going to be depicted alongside the normal ones. The reason for this Licker type could be:\n\nAge: Either the Lickers were young adults or children prior to infection, or the Lickers themselves begin their lives as a smaller creature before eventually growing into their normal appearance and fully shedding their skin.\n\nUmbrella experiments, as noted by News Bot. In The Umbrella Chronicles, Jill Valentine noted that the Lickers encountered were possibly escaped test subjects. It may be that their appearance is a side effect of Umbrella cloning normal Lickers.\n\nLickers also retain a thin, translucent layer of skin in Operation Raccoon City.\n\nWhile most Lickers are irregular mutants born from secondary infection, they do have a B.O.W. counte"
