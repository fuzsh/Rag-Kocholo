With her right hand the goddess supported the body of a snake, which stretched itself in front of her body to take an egg from Hygieia's left hand. A support for the missing body of the snake can be seen on her belly. The infant Hypnos, who has wings like Cupid, takes a nap, resting his head on his knee. The goddess, draped in an ungirdled chiton and long himation, looks down slightly to her left. Right forearm and both hands missing. Breaks across the body (repaired) at neck and near knees. Polished surface chipped and encrusted.\n\nSnakes were associated with the healing powers of the earth in ancient medical thought, and they were frequently shown as companions of gods of healing. Sleep in the sanctuary of a god noted for curative powers was a popular form of treatment in antiquity."
