        "text": "Bronzes in the ancient world - from over-lifesize sculptures to small-scale utilitarian objects - were an omnipresent and integral part of everyday public and private life. Bronze was also a valuable resource. From a scientific point of view, recent decades have seen new methods of analysis to reconstruct the production processes of ancient bronzes. At the same time, research on ancient bronze sculpture continues to rely on art historical theories and methodologies in discussions of style and chronology. Irrespective of the nature of the object - be it sculpture, tool, or weapon - role and function must be studied in conjunction with the archaeological context with which the objects were once associated. The proceedings of the XXth International Congress on Ancient Bronzes address these key topics, bringing together experts from different backgrounds to investigate further the developing studies in the field of ancient bronzes.\n\nXX International Congress on Ancient Bronzes – Eberhard Karls Universität Tübingen, 17-21 aprile 2018 Abstract: In the study of Greek and Roman bronze artworks literary sources have had a very important role beside to the analysis of the archaeological evidence. In fact, they can provide a lot of information about the destination and display of an artwork; the artist and the way of production; the function and use, also in different periods and places; the meaning and how it changed through time; finally, the fortune and later reception. They can reveal precious information even on lost bronzes. The correct use of these pieces of news in archaeology is possible just if the texts which transmit them are, first of all, analysed in a philological perspective. It means that the information has to be examined in its literary, philological, historical, philosophical and cultural context of transmission. In so doing, the filters of the author who relates the piece of news can be considered, as well as the philological problems related to the history of the text and its transmission through the centuries. In this paper I want to analyse passages, mainly taken from Pliny the Elder’s Natural History, Plutarch’s writings and Pausanias’ Description of Greece, on some bronze offerings in the sanctuary of Apollo at Delphi. In these passages the text transmitted by manuscripts shows some problems of interpretation. A different reading of the text can offer a better meaning but also modify the archaeological reconstruction of the artworks and / or their display in the sanctuary, as well as our knowledge on their reception in the Imperial Age."
