        "text": "Summary: \"A half-blood child of the eldest gods, shall reach sixteen against all odds.\" Who decided the sons of Kronos met the criteria? There are older gods. Elder Gods. Percy is the Child of Prophecy, but his very existence is a flaw. An anomaly. A bend in Fate. And if Fate can bend, then it can break.\n\nHello. First story here. We are going to be a bit behind thanks to my perfectionism still looking for things to edit better. It will be one chapter a day until we catch up. There are only seven chapters right now. I have the same username on Spacebattles and SV. It's Shujin1 on Ao3 and FF. Please let me know if you have any questions.\n\nAn Undertow of Sand\n\nA PJO Fanfiction\n\n​\n\nMy first clue that everything was about to go to hell was when the hairs on the back of my neck stood up. I was now in mortal danger.\n\nIn a shopping mall.\n\nSpidey Sense? Super cool. What's not cool is needing it because of literal monsters out to kill me. But that's life. Lemons, lemonade, Molotov cocktails. You know.\n\nI slowed down my walk, angling for the overly complicated monstrosity of a fountain in the middle of the concourse. I think it's supposed to be some kind of octopus, but it might have been Cthulhu. Stones of all shapes and sizes, but differing shades of blue littered the bottom along with a bunch of quarters and nickels people had thrown in. I scanned the Mall of America's three upper levels in the water's reflection, but all I saw were people enjoying their Saturday afternoon. They could definitely use the sunshine after the week we've had. I turned my body even more, fishing in the pocket of my jeans for a dime as I glanced behind us.\n\nOh hell.\n\n\"So don't look,\" I said as they caught up to me, cutting through whatever they were arguing about now. I threw my dime into the water. \"But there's an evil dog on our six.\"\n\nOf course, they both looked.\n\nHere's what they saw: a creature the size of a healthy horse that looked anything but healthy. Matted orange-brown fur that did nothing to hide the contours of its ribs, weeping sores and bloated stomach, wiry limbs ending in paws that were more claw than flesh and a long snout decorated with a fanged grin. Its tail was literally a string of bones. Blue eyes cloudy like it had cataracts lazily roamed the concourse. It looked like it would drop dead any second. No one was calling for animal control, so I assumed the Mist was hiding it, but people still knew it was there. Some instinct screaming in their hind brains made them avoid it.\n\nIt was generally accepted that mortals lived in a different world than we did. The Mist did a thorough job of keeping us separate by hiding away what was truly there. Where we saw a rampaging monster, they might see gang members on PCP or like, escaped animals from a zoo. Greek vampires (don't ask) were actually serial killers using barbeque forks. A dude ate another dude's face? He's from Florida. See an older teenage boy escorting two twelve year olds through a mall?\n\nLook again.\n\nUnless you could see through the illusion, you were a NPC. At best you were traumatized by whatever you thought you saw. At worst? Collateral damage.\n\nAnd there was nothing you could do about it.\n\nSorry.\n\nSometimes it worked against us. Put down a demon snake from Grecian hell and it was a coin toss if mortals saw you stop a mugging, or commit one. Let's just say I had many reasons to try to stay out of the cameras, and my father seeing my face in the news was one of them. Still, I'd take it if it meant most people could live normal lives.\n\nIn another life, that would have been me. Or maybe I would have wished it was me.\n\nLook, I didn't ask to be a half-blood.\n\nBut if I had the choice, I don't think I would have given it up for anything.\n\nLuke turned right back around, right hand drifting to his pocket for his dad's lighter. He's a half-blood too and you can be half of anything, but we're the type commonly known as demigods. One parent was normal, the other? A god.\n\nGods are real.\n\nSo are monsters.\n\nSo why are we in a shopping mall?\n\nIt's a long story, but the gist of it is: Zeus lost his favorite sparkler, so we have to get it back.\n\nAnd we were running out of time.\n\nLuke's left hand gently cuffed a still staring Artemis upside the head. \"Keep moving.\"\n\nI expected her to snap at him for touching her. I think Luke expected her to break a few of his fingers. What we got was her wordlessly draining the last of her soda and dumping the cup into a trashcan. When she turned back to us to catch up she looked, well, kind of spooked.\n\nLuke and I exchanged glances.\n\nAs a rule, if something spooks a god, it's probably bad.\n\n\"What is it?\" Luke hissed under his breath. The demigod son of Hermes, the Greek god of Thieves and Travelers was already looking for an out, peering into every kiosk we passed.\n\n\"Something that should not be free,\" Artemis answered quietly. \"A cruel creature, an eater of children.\"\n\nSo evil dog was very evil.\n\nFor some reason, Luke's eyes flickered over me. \"How do we kill it?\"\n\nOur girl scout just swallowed. Hard.\n\n\"It was killed before, right?\" Luke pressed. \"Or trapped? Or…\"\n\nNow it was her turn to look over me, prompting me to look down at myself wondering what the problem was, before she deliberately looked away. \"It has never been killed by anyone.\"\n\nI didn't want to hear that.\n\n\"No one? \" It didn't come out as strongly as I would like, but it wasn't a squeak. \"But - okay, but it can be trapped with something. You said it shouldn't be free.\"\n\n\"There were special circumstances,\" she began carefully. \"My father was allowed to turn it to stone and cast it among the stars.\"\n\nAnd Artemis, Greek Goddess of the Hunt (no, I didn't stutter) was already fulfilling our quota of godly interference. This was fine. Obviously. My first Quest as a demigod pulls out Uber Monster 2000, but I was the one who argued for a literal god(ess, whatever) in my adventuring party so I was kind of asking for it. Come on, Luke was, like, a level 10 adventurer at least and I was, maybe 2. I'll be nice to myself and say I was level 3, but made up for it in magic items. I've played enough sessions with my father as Dungeon Master to know that he would take one look at my party, laugh, then make me suffer for it.\n\n\"Shit,\" Luke muttered. His left hand palmed his face, stretching the scar that ran down from his left eye to his chin into a pale, thin line. \"Perce,\" he said in a low tone. \"I'm eighteen. \" I blanked on why that was important. He rocked his head back. \"Child eater.\"\n\nI spun towards the other twelve year old kid in our group. As soon as I met Artemis' moonlit eyes, I recognized the flaw in my thinking.\n\n\"Oh right,\" I muttered. Gods can look however they like, so this twelve year old girl was more like twelve thousand year old. \"And you're actually ancient.\"\n\nSo I'm fucked, is what Luke was saying. Good. To. Know. I knew this was going too well. Well, I didn't know that, I lied, but considering we're after a WMD Master Bolt god weapon not even the gods could find, it had been going well in hindsight. And everyone knows hindsight sucks.\n\nMy Mythomagic card deck was burning a hole in my jacket. I pulled out the aluminum tin embossed with a stylized etching of Mt. Olympus. One of my inherited abilities from my god parent included divination. It's a Fate and Prophecy thing. I used trading game cards to help me get a glimpse of what was waiting for me. Regular cards, like the ones you use for poker or Solitaire were too vague. So was Pokémon. I still have no idea what drawing a shiny Charizard means. No one had time for a full tarot reading but maaayyybeee…?\n\nI flipped the first card.\n\nThanatos, the God of Death.\n\nOkay, maybe not.\n\n\"What's the trick?\" I asked as I stuffed my cards back into my jacket. I even remembered to pull up the zipper.\n\n\"It is destined to never be caught,\" Artemis said.\n\nWhat?\n\nOh for -\n\nMom, I prayed to my divine parent. So, like, one of your toys? Is stalking me. Can you maybe do something about it?\n\nHer response was a series of electronic beeps.\n\nLuke had caught on the same time I did, nudging my shoulder. \"Maybe your mother can - \"\n\n\"Tried.\" I cut him off, annoyed. \"Busy signal.\"\n\nHis face pinched.\n\n\"You can just feel the love,\" he drawled with that bitter undertone in his voice. I can totally see where he's coming from now. My mom is the best mom in the world and she still pisses me off sometimes. Imagine if I didn't know her at all. \"Can't you?\"\n\n\"Dying builds character.\"\n\n\"I bet.\"\n\n\"She has ignored you?\" Artemis asked carefully, always wary of accidentally insulting my godparent. Apparently being turned into a small woodland creature is only funny when Artemis does it to someone else.\n\n\"No,\" I said curtly. \"Mom will never ignore me.\" I ignored the sad, indulgent look Luke gave me. \"This is just her way of telling me to stop being a whiny bit - \"\n\nLike a sign from providence, the crowd thinned off to our left, revealing an eye wear kiosk where some brown haired boy was trying on sunglasses in front of a mirror. They were wrap-around shades like mine. A slim futuristic solid piece of opalescent material in a black matte frame. His just darkened the world a little bit.\n\nMine?\n\n\" - perhaps if I were to unveil my divinity…\" Artemis trailed off.\n\nLuke picked up the slack. \"It would vaporize everyone here. That's not a solution, that's mass murder.\"\n\n\"If it can rid us of the fox - \"\n\n\"Evil dog,\" I muttered as I took off my shades. She ignored me.\n\n\" - then it would be well worth it. You know what is at stake should we fail. Perseus - \"\n\n\" Percy.\" I was ignored again.\n\n\" - is necessary.\"\n\nLuke gritted his teeth and cast his blue eyes around again. Without my glasses, I could now see his ghost. It overlapped his living form and had pale, nearly gray hair and worn, haggard features that were out of place on someone so young. It was begging, pleading for something. It would take the dagger and stab itself in the black, pulsating dot.\n\nI see dead people.\n\nOr rather, I see how people are going to die in 20/20 vision.\n\nPeople. Plants. Animals. Inanimate objects too, like machinery or weapons. Even buildings aren't immune to the concept of Death. I got my eyes from my mother. It's a Fate thing.\n\n\"We can lure it,\" Luke whispered. \"Underground parking garage, next left, through Macy's.\"\n\nI nodded, feeling sick to my stomach. There were hundreds, maybe thousands of people in the Mall of America, going about their lives. I bet most of them took tomorrow for granted, even with everything that has been happening. I stuffed my glasses into the side pocket of my jacket and tried to ignore the ghosts of the world falling apart, rotting, dying around me.\n\n\"Less people will see her magical girl transformation if we can get it down there,\" I quipped.\n\nI made the mistake of looking at said magical girl. Her ghost was physically older, maybe late twenties and looked like an actual ghost, fading away from the bottom up. She stared at the red, pulpy blood on her hands with an absolutely shattered expression. It was the look of someone who didn't want to live anymore.\n\n\"If that doesn't work, maybe we can collapse the place on it?\" Luke thought out loud. \"Don't look at me like that.\"\n\n\"Dude. \" I waved at his everything. \"What do you have against buildings?\"\n\n\"That was not my fault - \"\n\n\"It cannot be trapped,\" the Goddess of the Hunt said sullenly. \"Only evaded. Its protection is absolute. Perseus cannot run forever.\"\n\nLuke hissed. A long drawn out sound of frustration. He fiddled with his lighter. \"Why hasn't it attacked us yet?\"\n\n\"Is it not obvious?\" Artemis raised an auburn eyebrow. \"It is playing with its food.\"\n\nThat must have been the cue it was waiting for. A loud, high pitched cackle bark sounded from behind us. Against my better judgment, I turned my head.\n\nI met the eyes of Stephen King's Cujo trailing us. It was still keeping its leisurely pace, Cheshire grin widening. Now that my glasses were off I could see some kind of heat wave, or aura around it. Like it was just slightly out of sync with the rest of reality. Like it distorted the world around it. It was almost tangible. It didn't have a ghost. That meant it didn't have a destined death.\n\nYou can't die without one.\n\nThe world glitched . It rotated a few degrees to the right, slid to the left and moved down.\n\nNot now - !\n\nThe sudden vision speared through my temples. A little girl skipped past me at her mother's side with a teddy bear completely unaware of the danger. Her ghost had changed.\n\n\"Artemis!\"\n\nHer silver bow was suddenly in her hand, drawing back a bright moonlit arrow. The shining celestial bronze sword Reclaim sprung from Luke's vintage lighter as everyone around us let out cries of shock and alarm. There was a flash as the Goddess of the Hunt let loose her arrow. She had thousands of years of experience and practice. She was known as one of the Twin Archers of Greek mythology. I'd personally seen her shoot through a crowd to hit a target the size of a dove at 500 feet. Her very existence was tied to Hunting as a concept.\n\nShe missed.\n\nI could see it, the way reality twisted around the Hound of Dracula, Zoltan to turn a bullseye into a few inches off. Artemis had already notched another arrow, but I already knew it wasn't going to do any good.\n\nA cruel creature, she had said. It was here for me. It had my attention. For the record, I thought in my mother's general direction. I fucking hate your tests.\n\nI shut my eyes and yanked at my necklace. The tiny silver sword pendant came off in my hand, unsheathing Damocles.\n\nI still heard the crunch. Everyone screamed.\n\nCruel creature, Artemis had said. Child eater. Just because it looked like a dog doesn't mean it isn't a monster.\n\n\"Luke, fire alarm. Clear the mall.\" I threw my bag to the side. Blood was rushing through my ears, a low roaring in time with my pulse. The world snapped into crystal clear focus. Some ADHD part of my brain just shut off the unimportant stuff. I was vaguely aware that civvies were headless chickens making a lot of noise running anywhere that was away , but I could hear the click of claws on the marble floor. I could hear it breathe. A drop of blood dripped from a fang and I could hear it hit the ground. \"Blow something up if you have to.\"\n\nHe probably wouldn't have to. Children of the God of Thieves just get locks.\n\nHe'll probably blow something up anyway.\n\n\"'Temis, we're killing it.\"\n\n\"Perseus,\" she protested, voice tight with grief and rage. Artemis hated failing. Luke did that thing he did where he turned on his heel and faded into the background. \"It cannot be killed.\"\n\n\"We are killing it.\"\n\nThat was how Fate and Destiny worked. If there is a beginning? There is an end.\n\nI had to believe that.\n\nGatekeeper Zuul let loose another harsh, laughing bark. I didn't think it spoke, but I was pretty sure it understood English. Call it a gut feeling. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw Artemis' silver bow dissolve into motes of moonlight, replaced by twin hunting knives. Teeth idly snapped in her direction, as if it was taunting her. The bone tail lazily swung back and forth as it stepped towards me. I tensed, shifting my grip on Damocles' long hilt, but it seemed content to let me make the first move. I wasn't a huge fan of that. I had no idea how strong or how fast it was. Then there was the whole special snowflake destiny thing it had going on. If I didn't know better, I would say it had more of mom's support than I did. And I'm...a twelve year old boy. A demigod, but still not the most impressive thing on the planet.\n\n\"Are you going to make me wait all day?\" I asked, gesturing with my sword.\n\nJust so we're clear, I was asking Cujo.\n\nNot Luke.\n\nThere was a 'whump' sound followed by a bang as a giant gout of flame flared into existence in the food court we just left. The fire alarms started screaming with gusto, strobing emergency lights snapped on, fans in the walls roared to life, the whole nine yards. That wasn't enough for the resident pyro. Thick, billowing smoke poured out of what I think was the Taco Bell. There was another explosion followed by an electronic screeching sound like R2D2 was being tortured.\n\nCabin 11, Hermes. Not even once.\n\nI shouldn't have taken my eyes off it.\n\nMy Spidey Sense screeched.\n\nI blindly threw myself to the left and took what felt like a shotgun blast to the right shoulder. I felt my body spin out of control, landing in a heap on the floor with enough momentum to slide into the legs of a bench.\n\nI still had my right arm. Good jacket. Nice jacket.\n\nOw.\n\nI felt Damocles' subtle pull and went with it, swinging the blade with my left arm in the general direction of danger. If I was up against a nice, normal Hellhound from the depths of Tartarus, Damocles ' edge would have cut right through its jaw as it leapt at me, splitting its skull in half. But I wasn't. I could hear some kind of discordant clang as the evil dog's head seemed to bend around the sword. The monster flickered and it was suddenly a foot to the right and three feet higher.\n\nIt got do overs?\n\nMy sword hit nothing but air as it alighted on the wall and I knew I didn't have enough time to bring it back around. I tried anyway.\n\nA giant brown paw batted me out of the way. I could feel a wet crunch that was probably my hip dislocating. My gasp of pain was completely drowned out by a roar as the giant Grizzly that came out of nowhere took the hit for me. The two massive animals crashed into Cthulhu's fountain, scattering blue stones like marbles. Zuul flowed like sand, evading each and every attempt to pin it down as it tore into the bear.\n\n\"Get up!\" I heard Luke yell. I swallowed the pain down and used my sword as a crutch, forcing myself to my feet. We have to lure it, I thought. And then - and then what? Can't hit it, can't kill it. Can't trap it. I heard the squeak of Luke's sneakers zooming past somewhere above me. Second floor?\n\nThe bear avoided a vicious bite to the jugular by suddenly shrinking, twisting shape. Sleeker, more agile. Hooves and sharp, vicious horns. What should have been a disemboweling headbutt hit nothing. The goat became a majestic eagle, swooping out from under raking claws. Jed from The Thing laughed, leaping back and fixing its cloudy blue eyes on me. A growing sense of dread sunk into my spine. Can't hit it, can't kill it. Can't trap it.\n\nMom, I pleaded. I can't -\n\nI can't run like this.\n\nI have to.\n\nLuke let out a piercing whistle. Jed lunged for me. I was already moving.\n\n\"Perce! Come on!\"\n\nI don't know where I found the strength to put one foot in front of the other. The sprinkler system was on, coating the floor in puddles of water that didn't help anything at all. Everything was a blur. All that mattered was the back of Luke's red vest fluttering a floor above me. I could almost convince myself we were back at camp, racing for a bag of Butterfingers. Almost. If not for that feeling prickling at the back of my neck telling me I was about to die.\n\nI threw myself over the miniature garden decorating the center of the concourse like the divider in a highway. I could feel the displacement of air as the monster just barely missed me. To my bewilderment, it actually skidded across the wet floors like it took an unwanted water park slide. It bowled over clothes stands left in front of a kiosk, a trash can and was on a collision course with a fossil stand.\n\nSo.\n\nWe can't hit it, but it can hit things by itself?\n\nSo physics was still a thing!\n\nLuke doubled back, somehow running down along the column (maybe physics wasn't a thing) and hauling me to my feet by the collar of my jacket. I stumbled, feeling my hip grind before I hit my stride. My right arm was a noodle of pain. The knuckles of my left hand cracked as I loosened my grip on my sword.\n\nI was vaguely surprised I haven't dropped it yet.\n\n\"We're close to the elevators.\" Luke spoke quickly. \"I've got a plan.\"\n\n\"Elevators work during a fire alarm?\" I panted.\n\n\"Alarms are my best friends!\" Luke shot me the same sly grin he shared with his father Hermes. It pulled at his scar. \"With a little persuasion.\"\n\nOn the other side of the concourse, a twelve year old girl in a silver parka ran past us. \"Don't look back!\"\n\nI don't care who you are, or who you're leaving behind. When a god says that?\n\nDon't.\n\nIt was like a bomb went off behind us. I could hear everything just shatter. Heat pulsed against my back as a tangible thing. Blinding light. That gut twisting shockwave of the rejected physical world shifting around the presence of divinity. I let myself hope for a second, hooking Damocles back onto my necklace.\n\nThe light blinked out with a cry. Zowie the Zombie Dog let out a cackling bark.\n\n\"Wait, Art - \"\n\n\"Leave her!\" Luke snapped at me. \"She'll live!\"\n\nRight. Literal god.\n\nBut -\n\nNever mind.\n\nLuke leapt. One foot pushed off the column, the other kicked off the neon green lights of a kiosk front as he reached for the rails. I watched him vault onto the second floor. Okay. Like the Climbing Wall back at Camp, with less lava. I focused on the burn in my legs as I made the jump. I almost made it, my fingertips brushing the ledge. Luke grabbed my wrist.\n\n\"I got you.\"\n\nWe sprinted through Macy's, knocking over every rack and display and mannequin that didn't get out of our way fast enough. At the top of the escalator, the lone open elevator surrounded by red alarm lights was like seeing an oasis in a desert.\n\nLuke reached them before I did. He dove through the doors and pulled me in behind him. There was a red light on in the car, a fireman's helmet. His keyring was already in his hand, keys dangling right next to the lockpicks. It took him two seconds to unlock the car. Maybe three. Tops.\n\nThe hairs on the back of my neck told me that was all the time we had.\n\nAs soon as I saw Man's Best Friend Max's ugly grinning mug, I yanked Luke behind me and slammed my fist into the Close Door button. I had enough time to realize that I was stupid - I just killed us - that button doesn't do anything! Reclaim flashed from Luke's lighter as he let out a wordless yell. I think I screamed too as I saw Death take a flying leap towards us -\n\nThe elevator doors closed.\n\nThere was a loud bang as the doors buckled inwards as an imprint of Cujo's face.\n\nI couldn't stop my grin. \"Bad dog!\"\n\nAnd as if we hadn't just narrowly escaped dying horribly, Artemis had the gall to yell back from somewhere. \"It's a fox!\"\n\nI turned to Luke. \"You're right. She's fine.\"\n\nLuke just snorted. With a flick of his wrist, his blade was just a lighter as he kneeled. \"Emergency hatch, quick.\"\n\nI climbed onto his shoulders. I could see the outline on the top of the car, but no obvious way to open it. There was another loud noise, and a groan of metal but it came from just to the left of our door. Our girl scout was buying us precious seconds. Damocles' silver-gold rippled edge bit into the metal. Like opening a tin can. With a sword. I flinched as I hit some active wires, spitting sparks into my eyes.\n\nCome on. Come on.\n\nAnother loud bang and a screech as the doors parted. Luke grunted and shook. I completed the square and slammed my right fist into the hatch. With a thunking sound, it came free. I scrambled out on top of the car. Luke came after me with a slight wheeze and just in time. The second he cleared the top, the doors burst open. The entire elevator dipped with the sudden weight. Razor teeth snapped at the hatch opening, before I heard that barking laugh I was starting to really hate. It shifted, pressing a cloudy blue eye close to the hatch, just grinning at us.\n\nLike it was having fun.\n\n\"Cocky bastard,\" Luke muttered. The elevator shaft was a wide concrete space lined with cables and hydraulic pipes. It stunk of grease and I don't mean the good stuff on quality pizza. He grabbed my right arm, ignoring my hiss as he pulled it around his shoulders. Pressed close like this, Luke smelled like fresh blood. I don't know if the other cars were up or down, but it was a long drop either way.\n\nI trusted Luke.\n\nAs he pulled us over the edge, I smiled back at Miles \"Tails\" Prower. \"Bye!\"\n\nThe floors flashed by. Luke twisted, pointing his feet down. \"Maia!\"\n\nHonest to god wings sprouted by his ankles.\n\nI laughed out loud. \"Dude! Featherfall!\"\n\nI could hear him huff. \"Nerrrrd. \"\n\nThe landing in front of closed elevator doors shook my battered skeleton. I groaned. Luke practically collapsed to his knees.\n\n\"You okay?\"\n\nHe straightened and that let me see what I missed. His grey T-shirt was soaked red all along his side. The fabric was sticking to a long cut running from his back to his stomach.\n\n\"It nicked me, it's fine.\" He winced as he stood up. It's fine. Right. He glanced around and unsheathed his sword. \"Get the doors, yeah?\"\n\nNormally telling a twelve year old to pry elevator doors open by himself was a good way to have closed elevator doors.\n\nBut.\n\nDemigod.\n\nIt's not just a word.\n\nI had just gotten a good grip when Star Fox made an unwanted appearance, breaking through the doors floors above us.\n\n\"Doors!\" Luke roared. There was a staccato of ringing snaps and celestial bronze cutting through steel.\n\nI pulled.\n\nThen it was just a lot of sound. Screeching, tearing, grinding, cracking. Echoing up the shaft. Echoing through the garage. A discordant clang echoing in my head. The world tilted on an axis as Luke tackled me from behind, both of us spilling out onto cold concrete and cigarette butts moments before the final crash. It didn't stop the spinning. There was a train. Collapsing bridge. Empty town. A beach filled with police. A lion? Images flashed by in first person - in bird's eye view - in a kaleidoscope.\n\n\"You alright?\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" I lied, turning to Luke. His eyes were gold. Blue. Gold. His ghost was different. This time it was screaming as light broke through cracks in its skin. I squeezed my eyes shut. I thought of an endless ocean. Sapphire waves stretching to a far horizon. \"Sudden migraine.\"\n\nI haven't had one this bad in a while.\n\n\"Ah.\" Luke sighed. \"Well, I think you can take a breather. I'll get a car.\"\n\n\"Sure. Sure.\" When I opened my eyes again, I was staring at a dirty nickel squashed into pink bubblegum by a sneaker footprint. Back in the present. Take stock. Right arm, usable. At some point, I must have either popped my hip back into place, or my nerves gave up. I rolled over onto my back and sat up.\n\nOh.\n\nHuh.\n\nThe elevator doors looked like the Hulk opened them. The gun metal gray doors were crumpled with clear hand prints as if they were made out of aluminum. Some of the concrete bricks on either side were either broken or shoved out of place covered in mortar dust.\n\nCool.\n\nI picked myself up.\n\nMaybe I'm actually a Level 4 Adventurer.\n\nI took two steps before I realized what was wrong with the whole picture. Disney's Robin Hood followed us into the elevator shaft.\n\nIt can't be hit. It can't be trapped.\n\nSo where is it?\n\nA loud, growling engine purr kicked in, making me jump. Someone's vomit green 2005 Ford Mustang pulled out of the rows, Luke behind the wheel. I glanced at the wreckage of the elevator behind me. Just. Making sure it didn't move. Or anything.\n\nWhen Luke pulled up next to me, it took two tries to open the door. Shout out to everyone that can consistently remember to unlock the passenger side. You are literally god tier, okay?\n\nMy mother is an actual god. Her batting average is trash.\n\nThe All American muscle car smelled like cheap cologne, cigarette smoke and potato chips. I buckled in because Safety First, then blindly reached behind me in the back seat for my backpack.\n\nBut wait. You're probably thinking, when did he get his bag in the car?\n\nI didn't.\n\nAnd at the same time, I did.\n\nYou know how that Scrödinger guy had a cat?\n\nMom doesn't skimp on birthday presents.\n\n\"I can dig out the ambrosia?\" I offered as I hauled the canvas backpack forward, settling it between my feet. I probably should break out the medical supplies. Food of the gods, like Greek ambrosia and nectar, were great for demigod injuries, but to be completely honest, I could really go for a Snickers right now.\n\n\"Save it.\" Luke turned the corners of the parking garage a little too fast. His thumbs drummed the steering wheel. \"Artemis will find us. She can dress it later.\"\n\nI bit my lip.\n\nLater. When we're safe.\n\nA strange shiver ran down my back. That felt too much like jinxing it.\n\nWe cleared the last turn and Luke floored it. The red and white cross striped bar of the ticketing station splintered across our grill as the machine protested. The speed bump hit hard and then we were out under the sunlight. I heard Luke let out a sigh of relief.\n\nThe hairs on the back of my neck stood up.\n\n\"Fuck!\"\n\nI heard him slam on the brakes. I felt the bone-breaking impact shudder through my side of the car. I hit the cup holder hard, knocking the wind out of me. The world tilted but it wasn't a vision. Just the car turning over onto its side, wheels still spinning. My ears rang with the screeching of metal on the pavement. Glass was breaking. The front window. Luke's window. My door crunched as the monster fox jumped onto the car, cackling. Its bone tail lashed out in a whip strike - I raised my right arm and that saved my life. The bones were sharp. Not being able to be cut or torn didn't stop my forearm from exploding in bright, grinding pain as shards of glass flew everywhere from the shattered window.\n\nIn a flash of movement, the fox bit down on the door. With a crunch, a large chunk was torn away and then there were just teeth.\n\nThe only reason I didn't immediately die was the flash of celestial bronze from the driver's seat. Reclaim carved a radiant upwards arc. I heard that discordant clang as the fox's head seemed to split around the blade's path before it flickered.\n\nBut I was ready for it this time.\n\nReclaim crunched into the roof of the car as gleaming, ivory fangs closed on Damocles.\n\nClang.\n\nLuke swept his sword down.\n\nClang.\n\nHe seemed to expect it, stopping the blade a centimeter from my head, and flicking his wrist.\n\nClang.\n\nI stabbed in the shadow of Luke's swing.\n\nClang.\n\nHave you ever seen a dog snapping at water from a hose? I don't know if we were the dog, or the water. It was all a game to the fox though. It had never been killed, not even by the gods themselves. Just put among the stars. I had never seen it bother to dodge. Why should it? Can't hit it, can't kill it. It cannot be trapped. From the moment it caught my scent, it had been playing with me. Eventually, the game would have to end.\n\nBut I don't want to die.\n\nI twisted my body to lunge for its exposed neck and instantly knew it was a mistake. I overextended. I just got in Luke's way and for absolutely nothing.\n\nClang. Clang.\n\nA silver hunting knife flashed through its eye.\n\nArtemis.\n\nShe only wanted to help. If I was faster. Smarter. More experienced, I could have used that split second she bought me to correct my mistake. But all I saw was the fox flicker when it shouldn't have. My swing went wide in the wrong direction. Jaws crunched into my chest. My lungs ignited. My ribs felt like they were melting. Bile rushed up my throat as my sword fell from nerveless fingers. I thought I would see my life flash before my eyes. That's what mortals always says happens. Instead, my world narrowed in focus.\n\nThe clouds in its blue eyes were moving. This close, the shifting, twisting aura of the monster danced before my eyes. It was almost tangible.\n\nOh, was the dim thought. I'm stupid.\n\nI can't put into words exactly what I realized. I would never be able to.\n\nI raised my free hand, feeling my forearm bones grind as the fox dragged me out of the car. Luke's blade flashed.\n\nClang!\n\nA burning tug pulled at my gut.\n\nThe fox yelped.\n\nThe vise grip around me disappeared. I hit the ground. I might have blacked out. I didn't even have the strength to scream when someone - Luke - pulled me up and it felt like every bone in my chest cavity shattered. All that came out was coppery liquid and broken air. It didn't matter.\n\nA beautiful wound had ripped its way up the fox's face, taking out its left eye. It was no longer grinning.\n\nI was smiling though.\n\nIt had a ghost.\n\n\"Maia!\" Luke screamed.\n\nI knew we didn't have the time to get out of its range. That was okay.\n\nIt was well within hers.\n\nTime seemed to slow as she knocked the gleaming arrow and drew it back. She took a moment to savor her aim, and then a flash of light. Back to the car wreckage, half in the air, I was a sitting duck. Thing is, mid-leap like it was, it was one too. It's seeming invincibility had taught it bad habits. My heart skipped a beat when I saw her silver eyes light up, nearly glowing with excitement, wonder and pure joy. The only thing ruining the Hallelujah chorus I could almost hear was the feral, bloodthirsty grin that pulled at her lips as every line of her body relaxed. At this range, Artemis couldn't miss.\n\nIt was a perfect shot.\n\nOne moment, the stink of monster breath was slapping me in the face, teeth snapping an inch from my nose.\n\nThe next, it was just golden dust blowing away.\n\nBye, Fiona.\n\n\"Percy!\" I definitely felt the landing. \"Styx!\"\n\nMy legs buckled. My right arm was a dull throb of pain, but I could feel my ribs screaming as I slid down to the ground. Wet coughs tore its way through my lungs and up my throat like magma welling in a volcano. It seared the whole way. I clumsily dug into my jacket with my left hand and pulled out my sunglasses. It wasn't for the sake of fashion. My head was killing me.\n\nI can't tell you if I meant that literally.\n\n\"Not dead yet,\" I whispered. I shoved my shades back onto my face. The ghosts of the world disappeared and that tight knot of pain between my eyes loosened. So, take stock, just like Mom taught me. I felt like shit. Glass shards to the face meant I probably looked like shit. I'm probably going to pass out in a bit if the darkness at the edges of my vision mean anything. And my jacket was definitely best present. I blinked slowly, staring up at the sky. Luke's head filled my vision. His blond hair was matted with blood on one side. He must have hit his head on the window when the car tipped. He didn't seem to notice it.\n\n\"I've got - we've got ambrosia in - in - where's our fucking bags? \"\n\n\"Here.\" I cast out my left hand, thinking about my backpack. My fingers fell on the canvas that definitely wasn't there a second ago. And that was all I was good for. The urge to sleep became almost overpowering. Artemis, flushed and trembling, knelt at my side. She gently pressed a hand trailing silver moonlight to the side of my face. The pain didn't lessen, but it stopped mattering as much.\n\n\"The Teumessian Fox, killed for the first time in our very long existence.\" Artemis nearly whispered as Luke tore through my canvas backpack.\n\nYou would think literal food of the gods would be stored in something other than a Ziploc bag but, uh, no. A small cube was shoved into my mouth. It tasted like my dad's special hot chocolate blend. A little pepper, a little vanilla and lots of marshmallows. He always made me a mug every time we pulled out the character sheets and twenty sided dice. As soon as I swallowed, I was given a second square. A warm feeling slowly spread from my stomach, like I actually had that hot chocolate. I let my eyes drift closed.\n\n\"Oh?\" I heard Artemis murmur. \"He has a high tolerance.\"\n\n\"For - for ambrosia?\" Luke asked just as quietly. \"How is that possible?\"\n\nShe was quiet for a moment. \"Sleep, Perseus.\"\n\nSleep sounded good. Unfortunately when I go to sleep, my brain shuts down first. Then my mouth.\n\nAnd my mouth decided on a haiku.\n\n\"Lying here dying, refuses to use nickname, why are you so cruel?\"\n\nThere was a pause. I was nearly completely gone when I heard Luke snort.\n\n\"Okay. Your brother's not allowed around him anymore.\"\n\n\"Agreed,\" I vaguely heard Artemis reply.\n\nI might have said more before Hypnos pulledme under. It might have even made sense. I don't know. I don't want to know.\n\nYou're probably wondering what the hell is going on. To be honest, I am too. And I grew up around this stuff. Demigods. Monsters. Greek gods? They aren't the only ones still hanging in there. Thor's an actual thing. The Jotunn are too. Ra? Definitely. Susano'o, yup. Lakshmi, Quetzalcoatl, Anansi...sorry. I'm going too fast. You kind of came in the middle of everything here. Let's rewind. Everything will make sense then. I promise. And who knows? Maybe revisiting the beginning will help me figure out where this is even going.\n\nMy mother would tell you it's a story millions of years in the making. If we cut out the history lesson, it began when I was born. Cut out the baby pictures, it started when I turned five and there was a sun god on our balcony. But what really set everything in motion was a Royal New York Cheesecake Blizzard from the local Dairy Queen Grill and Chill. I get one every Friday after school, no matter what school I'm going to. It's been my habit for years.\n\nIt's how a satyr named Grover Underwood found me.\n\nAn Undertow of Sand\n\nA PJO Fanfiction​\n\n'The Wheel of Time turns, and Ages come and pass, leaving memories that become legend. Legend fades to myth, and even myth is long forgotten when the Age that gave it birth comes again.' That's how the audiobook of Robert Jordan's The Eye of the World starts. I must have listened to it at least ten times by now, but I still remember the first time.\n\nI was a cute six year old standing on a stool, being walked through using a kitchen knife on strawberries without murdering myself. Dad had turned down the sound there and said something like 'Is that how it goes?'\n\nMy mother, hands gently guiding mine, had pressed a kiss into my hair and said 'There is a certain safety in repetition.'\n\n'There are neither beginnings nor endings to the Wheel of Time,' the old man narrated and I remember her laughing softly. It hadn't been a happy sound.\n\n'But it was a beginning.'\n\nThis beginning took place in Trinity's boy's bathroom.\n\nThat's the school I go to. Trinity School. It's a K-12 private school in Upper West Side Manhattan and pretty nice as far as schools go. Nice building, nice facilities. A lot of extracurriculars, a modern library, the cafeteria didn't suck and unlike my last school they did not have a fully armed and operational cannon in the front yard.\n\nIt was stupid. I don't want to talk about it.\n\nMost of my teachers were cool. My geography teacher, Mr. Panotti was from Sicily and had ears he could use as a blanket, they were nearly as long as he was! I was pretty sure they don't practice ear-stretching in Italy, but I've never been there, so what do I know? For science, I had Mr. Pretty who wasn't, but he did have a great sense of humor. Everyone swore up and down that our English professor Ellen was an escaped Hollywood star hiding under a fake name, even if no one knew which one. And Mr. Brunner was replacing Mr. Carlyle for the end of the year in Latin. I didn't know him well, but he seemed alright for a centaur. He could be a merman of some kind, but I was pretty confident in my guess. My Pre-Algebra teacher was a blood sucking witch, but we had an understanding. If she behaves, I won't bring my mother into it.\n\nTrinity started almost two weeks earlier than other schools, but that just meant summer vacation came sooner too. I had one last final exam, Latin with Brunner, before I was home free. Nothing had burned down. Whatever exploded wasn't my fault and best yet? It was not only Friday, but the third Friday of the month.\n\nIt was a study hall. My tutor had come to sign me out of the classroom so we could use a private room in the library. ADHD things. On the way there, nature called. Loudly. I had to go. Let's just say the tabasco sauce on my breakfast eggs had not been my best idea.\n\nSo there I was, in the boy's bathroom of Trinity, taking a massive dump when the vision hit.\n\nAs far as everyone and my medical history knows, I'm one of those unfortunates cursed with chronic migraines. It lets me keep my sunglasses indoors without questions and if I get the rare bad vision, I can sleep it off in the nurse's office.\n\nThis one was Bad.\n\nI don't mean one of the 'sleep it off' bad. I mean, cosmic imagery, mind opening and blood boiling Bad.\n\nAs in, seizing, shaking, clawing my face, shrieking and screaming fit Bad.\n\nThe whole apocalyptic nine yards.\n\nWhile on the toilet.\n\nTaking that massive dump.\n\nI don't remember how I got to the Nurse's Office. I'm hoping that's because I managed to knock myself out, because if not, that means I was paraded through the hallways as the victim of an epileptic fit. Someone had bitten the bullet and pulled my underwear up, but the jury was still out on if my pants were part of a package deal or if I had flashed the entire school with Surfer Dude boxer shorts.\n\nWhen I woke up (was released) in the Nurse's Office, I clapped a hand to my sore face and hoarsely screamed. \"Oh my fucking God!\"\n\nI would honestly take dumping my entire class into a shark pit over this. Because I didn't need to come back next year. We had a good run. There were other Ivy League Prep schools in New York. Dad would understand.\n\n\"It gets better,\" the voice of my tutor and best friend Cliff(ord) Randall drawled from somewhere to the left of me. He sounded like he was the bearer of bad news and loving it. \"Your boxers were a complete write off so…\"\n\nI shifted in bed and realized exactly what had happened. I had to be changed.\n\n\"I'm wearing diapers.\"\n\n\"You're wearing diapers.\"\n\nThere was only one thing I could say to that.\n\n\"Kill me.\"\n\nHe made that amused sound he did. It wasn't quite a laugh. I think he was allergic to those. It was more a short exhale of air and a grumble. \"Ah, no. Sorry.\"\n\nHe did not sound very sorry.\n\nI groaned and pulled the blanket over my face. I briefly considered smothering myself with my pillow. I had some bad summer send offs before. There was that time the gym burned down because, well, vampires. The school picnic that had been ruined by an actual rampaging bear berserker thing. Accidentally swallowing glass (don't ask). The, uh, cannon. But I can safely say this one was the worst ever. Of all time. I don't know how I was supposed to even think about showing my face in the hallways ever again.\n\nForget life support, my dignity was already applying for reincarnation in Elysium.\n\n\"Hey,\" Cliff ventured. \"You are okay, right?\"\n\nI sighed into the soft, fuzzy blanket and reluctantly pulled it back down. I looked over and met Cliff's Labrador brown eyes. I ignored his ghost with practiced ease. Mostly practiced ease. \"How bad was it?\"\n\nHe let out a soft whine and I winced.\n\n\"It was like you were dying,\" Cliff's hands squeezed his knees as he reflexively licked his chops. His right leg started jumping before he caught himself. He was a cool kind of guy. He wasn't the type to get worked up about anything. That he was showing this much? It meant he was rattled. \"Like something was killing you and I - and I couldn't do anything. I just - I ran for the nearest adult.\"\n\n\"There's nothing you can do, it's - \"\n\n\"All in your head, yeah, I know.\" He finished miserably and raised a hand to scratch behind his floppy ear. \"I gave you a bit of ambrosia for the cuts on your face. Cleaned you up a bit.\"\n\nIf you've caught on that Cliff is not quite a standard human, you'd be right.\n\nMy best friend is one of the Cynocephali, which means 'dog-headed.' He's not a lycanthrope or anything. It's not a curse. No transformation magic was used and no animals were harmed in the making. He was born like that, from equally dog-headed parents. Human from the shoulders down and Golden Lab neck up. He's people though, like you and me. Some are peaceful law-abiding citizens and some aren't. Cliff's one of the good guys. Keeps his nose clean.\n\nThe Mist made him look like just another fifteen year old kid with blond hair and brown eyes. I mean, he's a little under three years old, but that's basically fifteen in dog years.\n\nAnd he tutors me in English and Latin.\n\nMe and reading? We don't get along.\n\nI sighed again. \"Thanks. They called my Dad?\"\n\n\"They wanted to call the ambulance,\" Cliff sneered. \"Like human medicine can do anything. Your father talked them out of it, though. It's, um,\" he checked his celestial bronze watch. It had been his second birthday present from our family. It had his initials etched into the watch face glass and turned into a khopesh. \"Half past two, they excused you from the rest of your classes.\"\n\nIt was the Friday before school let out for the summer next Wednesday. Class at this point was basically playing jeopardy, hangman and charades for candy. Don't get me wrong, I would like to look my fellow students in the eye somewhen this side of never, so it was still appreciated. I missed lunch, which was annoying, but it was the third Friday anyway.\n\n\"Anything else?\"\n\n\"No,\" Cliff said, a bit too quickly. I frowned. \"Yes?\" He changed his answer. He brought his hands up and softly clapped them together as if praying. \"Don't - don't take this the wrong way. I wasn't sure and I had to get help and then I couldn't get too close and it was noisy and - \"\n\n\"Cliff.\"\n\nHe huffed. \"It's just - I thought - aren't you Greek?\"\n\n\"Grecian born, Celt raised,\" I confirmed. \"Why?\"\n\nCliff eyed me.\n\n\"Just spill,\" I said, feeling tired.\n\n\"So,\" He licked his nose. \"They pulled you out of the bathroom, right? And you're still yelling, but not just 'aah' yell, but talking yell. Speaking yell.\" So I didn't manage to knock myself out. That's great. \"Chanting, almost.\"\n\nShit.\n\n\"Are you telling me,\" I began slowly. \"That I might have given a Prophecy in front of everyone?\"\n\nIt was theoretically possible.\n\nPractically impossible.\n\nMom would never allow me to hold an Oracle, no matter how much Apollo begs.\n\n\"If you did, it was in no language I know of.\" That ruled out Greek, Latin and Egyptian. I mean, I highly doubt it was Egyptian and I'm working on my Irish Gaelic, but it was good to be thorough. \"It sounded creepy, whatever it was. I think there was a word you were repeating.\" Cliff's upright left ear folded back on his head in shame. \"Not helpful, I know.\"\n\n\"Don't sweat it, man,\" I told him. \"That's, like, Mom's thing. She'll know.\"\n\nSpeaking of?\n\nI could have done without the literal pants shitting! I thought in her general direction. Some kind of hint, clue or warning would have been real nice.\n\nI got a faint brush of a feeling back. An apology, before it shifted to feel more like a plea for patience.\n\nI breathed a harsh breath through my nose.\n\nFine.\n\nI swung my legs off the bed, grimacing as my...diaper...made crunching noises with the movement. My jeans had been replaced with cheap grey sweatpants that clashed something horrible with my purple and teal button up shirt. The look practically broadcast 'I had a whoopsie.'\n\nI held out a hand and Cliff deposited my sunglasses into it. \"Tell me I didn't shit my shoes.\"\n\n\"You didn't shit your shoes,\" Cliff said obediently with a hint of a doggie grin pulling at his chops.\n\nI did shit my shoes.\n\nJeeeeezuus Aaaaayyych.\n\nI could have screamed.\n\nGeneric sneakers and socks were waiting for me under the bed. I shoved my feet into them, ignoring the pinching as I stood up. I felt a little sore all over, the kind you get after pushing your body the day before. I expected that. My blood was still simmering underneath my skin. It was an uncomfortable shifting feeling. Cliff pulled back the curtain for me and I stiffened my spine as I walked past him to the front section of the Office.\n\nNurse Kim was at her desk doing paperwork with silent, mechanical patience and glazed eyes. Cliff held out his hand and snapped his fingers.\n\nThe Mist wasn't just some kind of mass hallucination or illusion. Or, it was, but those of our world could learn to manipulate the magic of it. Change a mass hallucination to a more subtle, personal illusion. It could be used as a form of hypnosis that way. The Young gods had it the easiest, using it essentially by instinct when they weren't outright changing reality to suit their whims.\n\nCliff took a three-month course on it as part of getting his Watcher license.\n\nEgyptians were as bad as the Romans in a lot of ways.\n\nAs for me? I had both no talent and too much in Mist manipulation. Cliff notes (pun?): It was really hard using something you couldn't feel or see. If Cliff wanted to, he could use an active illusion to look like a normal boy to other demigods too.\n\nHe has never managed to fool my eyes.\n\n\"Look who's finally up, Nurse Kim!\" Cliff's hand came down heavy and supportive on my shoulder.\n\nThe woman animated as she blinked away the cobwebs. She set aside her pen as she gave me a genuinely relieved smile. She was an older, Korean woman who had just started getting gray hairs. She probably had a few more because of me today. Lord knows, the responsibilities of the average school nurse start with lice management and vaccinations, and end with calling 911.\n\nThere was no medical certification for 'demigod bullshit.'\n\n\"Look who's finally up!\" She said warmly. \"How are you feeling, Mr. Stele?\"\n\nMortified.\n\n\"I've been better,\" I said instead. I adopted a hangdog expression \"I'm sorry for worrying everyone.\"\n\n\"We're all just glad you're okay.\" She searched through the papers on her desk and pulled out a sheet clearly designed to be filled out. The only splash of color on the white, gray and black worksheet was the logo of Trinity School.\n\nParent homework.\n\n\"Your father told us the last time you had a seizure was about seven years ago,\" she said delicately as I took the paper. \"There is a possibility you'll have another before you graduate, so we would really appreciate it if your parents took the time to fill out a Seizure Action Plan for us. It will help us make sure you get the care you need, okay?\"\n\n\"Sure thing.\" I folded the paper into a square and stuffed it into my sweatpant pockets. \"Can I go home?\"\n\n\"Of course, hun,\" she said with a grimace of sympathy. She slowly reached for the phone. \"Your classes were canceled for the day. Your mother can pick you and your clothes up at the Front Desk. I'll let the secretary know to expect you.\"\n\nFingers softly snapped.\n\n\"I'll make sure he gets there okay,\" Cliff volunteered as the sudden confusion in the school nurse's eyes faded.\n\n\"Can you make sure he gets there okay, Mr. Randall?\"\n\nCliff grinned, tongue lolling out. \"No problem.\"\n\nAs we left the Nurse's Office, I asked under my breath, \"What are you using me to skip?\"\n\nJust as quietly, Cliff hissed. \"Statistics!\"\n\nI mean.\n\nThat's fair.\n\nThankfully for the sake of my sanity, class was still in session. We made it to the Front Desk with minimal human contact roughly eight minutes to the bell where Cliff and I parted ways.\n\nPersonally, I thought 'Front Desk' was a bit of a misnomer. It looked like someone had shoved an office building into a school. The entire wall was made out of glass allowing visitors to look into a tastefully decorated waiting room. A cheerful banner that said 'Welcome to Trinity!' was strung up underneath the glass shelf attached to the wall. The shelf was covered in brochure holders, application papers, and chained up pens for parents writing checks for fees. The actual Front Desk was behind the greeters, a large U shaped throne for Ms. Jensen, the true ruler of the school.\n\nThe Principal existed, but the only time I've seen the guy was at our interview two years ago for my application. A real schmoozer that needed a third hand to find his ass. Everyone knew Jensen called the shots.\n\n\"Hey, sweety.\" Alice, the personable greeter, started as she got up from her chair. That twitch might have been the other greeter acknowledging my existence. Or despising it. Alice opened the glass door for me. \"You can wait in here for your - \"\n\n\"Stele,\" Jensen said in an iron tone. She didn't even look away from her computer screen, expecting the world to obey. \"Charles Brunner is giving you the option of taking your Latin exam early. You can take it this afternoon and be released for the summer, or study over the weekend and be here Monday.\" Steel grey eyes met mine. \"Your choice.\"\n\nThe way she said that made it clear she knew what I was going to choose.\n\nAs if I would give up not having to see anyone in my home room for at least three more months.\n\nI smiled brightly at her. \"I'll take my exam now.\"\n\n\"His office.\" I was dismissed.\n\nFive minutes to the bell.\n\nAs a late year substitute, Mr. Brunner's office wasn't in the '6th Grade teacher cluster' of offices at the end of the East Hall. He wasn't far from it though, because we 6th Graders still had to be able to find him. His nameplate was clearly temporary as a rectangle of paper with C. Brunner written on it instead of a brass plate.\n\nHe responded quickly to my desperate knocking. He opened the door looking alarmed with a fancy pen in hand, then confused, then relieved. \"Mr. Ste- \"\n\n\"Pleaseletmeinclassisgoingtoletpeopleinthehallways!\"\n\nWordlessly, Mr. Brunner backed his wheelchair from the door so I could scoot in. The door closed behind me just as the bell rang.\n\nSafe.\n\nI sighed in relief, almost collapsing against the door. The centaur's lips were twitching. I gave him a warning look and he ducked his head.\n\nMy Latin teacher looked like he could have been a famous quarterback competing in the Super Bowl before breaking his back. It was in the scruffy beard, thinning dark hair and the fact the guy looked like he could break me over his knee, wheelchair or no wheelchair.\n\n\"I've already set up your workstation in the back. Let me know if you need to use any other accommodations.\" He handed me his pen. As I reached for it, the world stuttered. As I stiffened, I saw another hand, smaller, feminine and darker skinned gently push the gleaming hairpin the pen had turned into towards me. As my fingers closed around it, the vision faded. The pen was a pen.\n\nMr. Brunner didn't question my reaction. \"Good luck.\"\n\nHe rolled his celestial bronze and silver wheelchair back to his desk. Greek lettering was etched into the silver, anchoring what was no doubt a complicated feat of folded space to the outside reality.\n\nI want a Tardis.\n\nNot until I'm old enough to legally drink, though. That was the rule.\n\n\"Is it multiple choice?\" I asked him.\n\nHe looked up from where he had been digging another pen out of a drawer. \"No.\"\n\nI grinned cheekily. \"Then what does luck have to do with it?\"\n\nThe centaur grumbled under his breath. I slipped into the small back room. It held nothing more than a cheap four legs and a slab desk, a chair, a cotton candy pink alarm clock, the reader, a box of Kleenex and a tiny trash can. The walls were blank of all decoration and color. A single uncovered light bulb dangled from the ceiling.\n\nSchool was prison, but this was a little too on the nose.\n\nI sat down. The first thing I checked was how many pages the test had.\n\nUgh.\n\nI turned the pink alarm clock around, so I couldn't see the moving hands.\n\nMy name was pre-filled on the page in stenciled lettering, highlighted with neon yellow: 'Perseus D. Stele.' Yes, I have a middle name. No, I'm not telling you what it is. It's awful. My grandparents are still under the impression my Dad had been on a huge rediscovery of the family's Greek culture trip when I was born.\n\nDad had still been interned when I was born. No, my name was Mom's fault, 100%. I don't know what she was thinking.\n\nI drew a solid ink line through 'Perseus' and wrote a shaky 'Percy' above it. Then I looked at the first question.\n\nThe letters were playing musical chairs.\n\nI...I have dyslexia. Me and reading don't get along. I'm okay writing, maybe a little slow. Numbers are more or less fine, but letters? I glanced at the clock, remembered I turned it around, turned it back forward, then went back to my test. I bit my lip. No matter how hard I stared, the letters refused to stop moving. I slowly reached for the start button on the reader, and... I felt like I had already failed.\n\nI'm not stupid. I know I'm not. I'm not.\n\nI don't need a Speech-to-Text, or colored post-its and highlights. I'm fine. I can do this.\n\nI can do this.\n\n\"Question 1. Name the members of the Dodekatheon,\" Mr. Brunner's voice said evenly from the reader. I felt the relief and then the shame for feeling relieved. \"And their Roman counterparts.\"\n\nRight.\n\nEasy enough.\n\nNext to the bold 1) I wrote the Greek Name of my favorite of the Greco-Roman pantheon: Hestia. Her Roman Name followed. Vesta.\n\nMight as well do it in Awesome order. I had to really think about putting Apollo next over his twin.\n\nI will admit to being a tiny bit biased there. A little. How could a sun god that crashed on our couch every weekend, was my Paladin's Disaster Bard of a son, taught me how to handle my visions and play poker just barely eke out his twin sister whom I've only met twice?\n\nIf your answer is A Humongous Crush, Just The Biggest Ever you are…\n\nGoddamn right and I hate it.\n\nI sped through the rest of the list with Minerva/Athena and then Jupiter/Zeus down in the trash where he belonged.\n\nEasy.\n\nI looked at the clock. Holy - that took longer than I thought. I turned the clock back around. That was not helping. I hit the play button on the reader.\n\n\"Question 2. According to mythology, how was Rome founded?\"\n\nWith a loud sigh, I got to writing.\n\n\"Question 3…\"\n\nI don't know how long that test took. I knew I heard the end of the day bell, which was a relief even if it meant I was cutting it close. How close? I don't know. I kind of took apart the pink alarm clock. I would put it back together, but I lost two screws, a spring, and a little lever thing somewhere. I marched out of the room. I calmly placed my completed test on Mr. Brunner's desk, handed him his pen and said,\n\n\"The clock was a mistake.\"\n\nThe centaur's lips twitched. \"I'll keep that in mind. Do you want to attempt the bonus question?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I said immediately. I learned early never to turn down extra credit.\n\n\"The fall of Kronos - Saturn - was part of your syllabus for the year. He overthrew his father to become king and it was prophesied that he would be overthrown by his children in turn. So he swallowed them whole as they were born, sowing the seeds for his own downfall.\" Mr. Brunner steepled his hands, peering at me over them. \"How does that myth relate to real life?\"\n\n\"It teaches us that all prophecies are self-fulfilling,\" I said without missing a beat. \"It teaches us that if we let our fear control us, we create things to fear. It is our choices that decide our destiny.\"\n\nHe studied me for a long moment. I don't know what he was looking for.\n\n\"A good answer that deserves full credit,\" he finally said softly.\n\nI smiled as I watched him write a + 10 to the top of my test. \"Thank you for letting me take it early, Mr. Brunner. I appreciate it.\"\n\n\"We might not have had long, but it was a pleasure teaching you, Mr. Stele.\" He placed his pen in his shirt pocket and adjusted the blanket over his forelegs before scooping up a dark green backpack from beside his desk. \"Now I don't know about you, but I'm ready to head home.\"\n\nDude. Today has been a special kind of hell.\n\nHe let me out the door first, but as he closed it he spoke up, as if he didn't want me to just take off without him. \"I take it you're a believer in destiny?\"\n\nAnd with the perfect sense of dramatic timing like the wizard she is, a goddess rounded the corner with my backpack slung over one shoulder, a plastic bag of shitty clothes in the other hand and the subtle smirk of a crownless queen on her lips.\n\nI am absolutely a Momma's Boy.\n\nFight me.\n\n\"Mom!\" I called out with a giant grin on my face.\n\nAt first glance, the only thing I shared with my mother was our straight crow wing black hair. We both wore it feathered, mine parted in the middle brushing my shoulders and hers brushing the small of her back. At second glance...uh. Nope, that was it. I was olive-skinned, she was pale. She had freckles and I didn't. Everything from our ears to our chin was different. I knew I looked a lot more like Dad's classical Greek, save for my eyes. She had eyes of black diamond, a fractal gaze that reflected bloody death.\n\nBehind my sunglasses and beneath the Mist, my eyes were the color of an aurora borealis. I had my mother's eyes.\n\nIt's just this was not the Name of my mother that gave birth to me. It was the Name of my mother that raised me.\n\n\"Percy,\" Mom greeted me gently. She kept a soft, but noticeable Irish accent. If anyone asks, she's from Ulster. She inclined her head towards my Latin teacher. \"Mórrigan Stele, Mister…?\"\n\n\"Brunner,\" the centaur said evenly. \"Charles Brunner, filling in for Mr. Carlyle.\"\n\nIt happens sometimes. Take the Greeks and their Roman Names. Pallas Athena, Goddess of Strategic War, Wisdom and Crafts, the Patron of Athens and Heroes was shoved off the Fucking Useless tree by the Romans.\n\nAnd she hit every branch on the way down.\n\nHer Name Minerva was so limiting and weak she was basically a minor goddess of basket weaving. The power of Athena didn't go anywhere, she would just be unable to access it. Her presence and awareness would be diminished. If you cursed out 'Minerva,' only the part of the deity allowed by the Name would answer. Exactly how limiting a Name was depended on a bunch of stuff. As a rule of thumb, the older the Name, the stronger it was. The older the god, the more a Name was more like an avatar, than a state of being. Young gods were called Young for a reason.\n\nI was born to Ananke, a Name of the Primordial Deity of Fate, Compulsion, Necessity, Inevitability and Circumstance. A Protogenoi. It is an old and powerful Greek Name. It is not a safe Name for mortals to witness. She learned that the hard way with my father. This way, she could be there for me, for both of us. After all, how does that saying go? What's in a Name?\n\nShe has older ones.\n\nMuch older.\n\nKnowing them was too much of a risk.\n\nEven for me.\n\nMy Mom shifted my backpack up higher on her shoulder, freeing her hand so she could offer it to my Latin teacher. \"A pleasure.\"\n\n\"You should be proud of your son,\" Mr. Brunner said and I'm not entirely sure I was imagining the emphasis on 'son.' \"He's attentive, hard-working and really gives the material thought.\"\n\nThe corner of Mom's mouth curled up. \"I am very proud of him.\"\n\nI knew she was. It was still nice to hear it. I grinned at her and pulled away from my teacher. \"Have a good summer, Mr. Brunner!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" the centaur replied faintly. \"You too.\"\n\nI made it past two classrooms before I began to feel super self-conscious about the bag of shitty clothes.\n\nAnd the diapers.\n\n\"Uh, Mom,\" I began awkwardly. \"Can you do something about - uh, the whole situation that I am...unfortunately...dealing with here?\" I know - mentally - that my Mom was the one who dealt with the poop factory that was baby me, but this was...not the same thing? That was over a decade ago and I had a thimble of pride left that was chafing as hard as the diaper was. I could see the corner of Mom's lip slightly curl up again as she opened the side exit and held the door for me. \"At like - some point?\"\n\n\"In broad daylight?\" She asked as if it was ridiculous, but I could hear the laugh in her voice. I heard it. \"You can't wait until we get home?\"\n\n\"Mom. Mom, please.\"\n\nAs I passed the door frame, the uncomfortable sweaty, lumpy diaper became nice, roomy boxer shorts. The sweatpants were now black slacks and the pinching of my feet abruptly stopped in black dress shoes.\n\n\"Oh my God, thank you.\" I sighed and stretched in the sunlight. I opened my mouth.\n\n\"No, I'm not mind wiping your classmates.\"\n\nDamn.\n\n\"Yes, you are coming back next year.\" Mom gently hip-checked me - plastic bag of shitty clothes conspicuously missing - on her way to the silver Mercedes parked directly in front of us in a reserved parking space.\n\n\"I'll convince Dad,\" I threatened over the hood of the car.\n\nThe amused look she gave me was also very smug and I didn't appreciate it.\n\nShe got in the car, preoccupied with putting my school bag in the backseat while I tried to get in the car. You would think a goddess would remember to unlock the passenger side. It takes a single extra second!\n\nBut no.\n\nShe already had a finger up as I sat down. \"Not one word.\"\n\nSo I said four words instead as I buckled in. Safety First. \"I didn't say anything.\"\n\nBut Mom, I thought. Really?\n\n\"I heard that,\" she said as she put the car in reverse. \"You know I heard that.\"\n\n\"But I didn't say anything.\" I said smugly as I elbowed the door for the window.\n\n\"I don't know why the passenger just doesn't unlock with driver.\"\n\n\"Yes, you do.\"\n\n\"Percy - \" she glanced over and let out a resigned sigh. \"Percy, no.\"\n\n\"Percy, yes.\"\n\nAs we left the school parking lot, I stuck my head out of the window and bellowed at the top of my lungs. I made sure the entire block heard my best impression of Mel Gibson's William Wallace.\n\n\"Freedoooooooommmm!\"\n\nSomeone's dog howled back like it was being murdered.\n\nEveryone's a critic.\n\n\"You are definitely your father's son today,\" she groaned in mock disappointment.\n\n\"You know you love me.\" She just hummed like she was considering it. \"You know you love me,\" I repeated. I held up my fist for a bump. As always, she left me hanging. I don't know why. It boggles the mind. A fist bump would not kill her. \"You are perfectly capable of just - \" My fist danced around. \"Come on.\"\n\nShe raised her hand, and my hopes at the same time, but, no. She grabbed at my fist, somehow uncurling my fingers so we were holding hands. She gently squeezed mine before letting go.\n\n\"What's the Friday Plan?\"\n\n\"DQ,\" I said immediately. Because Royal New York Cheesecake Blizzard, obviously? Do you even need to ask - It's pretty clear how that works. \"Then Manhattan Pizza. Barnes & Noble. Water Park.\"\n\n\"City?\"\n\nI scoffed. Water was my go to. The pool, the beach, the water slide, you name it. \"As if you need to ask, the pool bag is already in the trunk, isn't it?\"\n\nHer lip curled again, not bothering to deny it. The third Friday of the month was our day to hang out. Just my Mom and I. It was my day to be as much of a kid as I wanted. I wouldn't have to do homework or chores. I choose what we have for dinner. No bedtime!\n\n\"I'll think of something after that.\"\n\nShe made an amused 'hn' sound. \"Do you want a hint?\"\n\n\"Let me at least think of it first!\" I threw myself back in my seat, throwing an arm over my eyes. A second later I asked, \"What's the hint?\"\n\n\"I'll let you think of it first.\"\n\nI knew it.\n\n\"Manhattan Pizza for dinner,\" I said and heard her sigh fondly. Look, it's not my fault they're awesome. Everyone agreed with me. 5 star reviews. Mom was just a heretic.\n\nWe spent a few minutes in comfortable silence, but I had to break it at the next intersection.\n\n\"Hey,\" I said softly. \"What happened today, was it - ?\"\n\n\"Just a vision,\" she said just as softly. The knot of unease I didn't even know was there loosened.\n\n\"Thank God.\"\n\nShe cleared her throat.\n\nI rolled my eyes. \"And you, I guess.\"\n\nShe was never going to forgive my paternal grandparents for being devout Greek Orthodox.\n\nHer fingers briefly squeezed the steering wheel. A small shudder went through her before she looked at me. She had one of her unreadable expressions on. A little less humanity, a little more god. Her eyes reflected a hundred different gruesome deaths and I reflexively straightened my back.\n\nFor Elder Gods, Names are avatars. They are always there though. The only difference is by how much.\n\n\"It was a milestone,\" she said distantly. \"You're getting stronger.\"\n\n\"Sweet.\" I smiled, tentatively hopeful. The rest of the drive I spent telling her about my day. She already knew, but she liked listening to me.\n\nIt kept her grounded.\n\nThe local Dairy Queen Grill and Chill was one of those stores that was a lot bigger than it looked on the outside. You had to build long, not wide to find the space which meant the store fronts looked claustrophobic, but once you were in the door, it opened up. It was pretty empty for the time of day, just one person ahead of us in line.\n\n\"Hey, G-Man!\"\n\nThe youth behind the counter shot me a bright, goofy grin. Then his brown eyes darted behind me and widened as his smile wilted. He hurriedly turned back to his customer, tugging his cap down firmly over his curly hair. Probably embarrassed. My Mom did that to pretty much everyone sixteen and over. Goddess thing.\n\nHe's new and stays at the counter since he has some kind of muscular disease in his legs that makes a lot of movement difficult. Standing all day like he was couldn't be comfortable either, but he was a trooper. My last two appearances were with my Dad, so he hasn't met her yet.\n\nAs soon as the young mother with two small children moved to the side to wait for their order, I stepped up to the counter. \"Getting the hang of taking orders yet?\"\n\nHe gave me a weak smile. \"Hey, pressing buttons is harder than it looks.\"\n\nHis name was Grover Underwood, G-Man for short. He was a young looking sixteen, with a wispy start of facial hair and acne.\n\n\"Wh - what are you getting?\" He swallowed nervously, eyes flickering to my mother and back. He was one of those apparently. Some people just find it difficult to think around my mother.\n\n\"Guess.\"\n\nHe bit his lip. \"The cheesecake?\"\n\n\"Damn straight. Large.\"\n\nMy mother leaned in and Grover straightened as if he was about to snap out a salute. She let her hand tap a rapid rhythm on the counter as she made a show of looking over the menu. \"Medium Oreo, if you would.\"\n\n\"Yes, My Lady,\" he said immediately.\n\n\"My Lady?\" I laughed as his face fell, turning red. \"It's the twenty-first century, dude.\"\n\n\"I meant - ma'am.\" He looked down at the computer, tapping in our orders with burning cheeks and ears. He looked like he was wishing the floor would open up and swallow him whole. \"I meant ma'am. Ma'am. I just - \" He whispered a quiet, \"Styx.\"\n\nOh he's Greek.\n\n\"I'm sure it just slipped out,\" Mom graciously allowed.\n\n\"Yes!\" Grover latched on to the excuse. \"I do - uh, over the summer, I have...drama club.\" He was cringing, but kept going. \"You know, re-enactments?\"\n\n\"Like a Renaissance fair?\" I asked.\n\nHe nodded miserably, like he was expecting me to rip into him for it.\n\n\"G-Man. I play Dungeons and Dragons. Table top.\" I smiled at him. \"I don't have room to say shit.\"\n\nHe tentatively smiled back. \"Okay, that'll be 13.47.\"\n\nAs we moved to the side, the store's door opened to admit three old women. And I mean old, real senior citizen material. I'm talking brightly colored cardigans (because old = cold), sandals with socks, large sunglasses and granny pants. They each had sequined purses with electric blue yarn dripping out two of them and large shears out of the third. Don't quote me on this, but I think they were siblings rather than just friends. Something about their faces.\n\nYou ever get the feeling that you are missing something important?\n\n\"Uh, welcome to Dairy Queen?\" Grover's voice warbled.\n\nAnd as they walked up to the counter, they threw my Mom absolutely poisonous looks. Sometimes that happened too. Random asshats, like this one guy who refused to believe the ring on my mother's finger meant anything. That got my hackles up. I didn't care that I was about to make a scene, Mom would back me up. We could humiliate them.\n\n\"Wow, okay, excuse you,\" I said loudly. I made a show of turning to my mother and asking, \"What did you do?\"\n\nThe corner of Mom's lips curled up. \"Your father.\"\n\nI stared at her in complete disbelief.\n\n\"Blah-ha-ha!\" Grover bleated out a surprised laugh while the mother with two kids snorted so loudly into her bite of ice cream she started choking.\n\nI could have died.\n\n\"Wha- oh my God, Mom! Filter! Filter!\" And she started laughing. It didn't happen often, but when it did she wasn't afraid to laugh, which just made everything worse. \"Stop! It's not - you're not funny!\"\n\n\"Uh, a Royal New Yor - \"\n\n\"Here!\" I grabbed our orders from the man and escaped.\n\nI can't.\n\nAs the car pulled away from the DQ, I mumbled around a spoonful of cheesecake ice cream. \"You're not funny.\"\n\n\"I am funny.\"\n\n\"You're really not.\"\n\nThankfully, the rest of the day was a lot of fun and free of any more embarrassments. Our last stop turned out to be the game store for more packs of Mythomagic cards, hoping to complete my roster. That fact that it would help refine readings was a nice bonus.\n\nWe got back to the apartment building a little before dinner time. We lived in the top floor penthouse, courtesy of the grandparents. It was...a penthouse. We had a nice balcony with a pool and view of the Manhattan skyline. We had a lot of plants. I don't know what else to say about it? It's home.\n\n\"Pizza!\" I called as I walked in through the door, carrying the two boxes of large cheesy, pepperoni goodness. I had just put them on the coffee table when my Dad emerged from his office.\n\n\"Did someone say pizza?\"\n\nMy father is Dorian Stele. He's a lawyer, which I think is why he's such a pain in the ass Dungeon Master. He's Greek-American with curly brown hair, strong stubbled chin and a proud Greek schnozz. He had one of his many, many ties draped around his neck and a broad smile.\n\n\"He was your son today,\" Mom announced as she tossed the car key fob onto the table by the door.\n\n\"Is that how it is?\" Dad asked her as I grabbed him in a massive hug, the biggest I could manage. Dad returned it as best he could with one arm. He had a small glass of - I took a small sniff - whiskey, I think, in the other hand. I could kind of already tell from the bags under his eyes that it hadn't been a good day. \"Look at that, fifty percent of the credit, one hundred percent of the blame.\"\n\nIn retaliation, Mom stole his tie.\n\n\"Am I getting that back?\" Dad called after her as she went towards the kitchen.\n\nMom glanced back at me for some reason, the corner of her lip curling up as she met Dad's eyes. \"Later.\"\n\n\"I like the sound of that.\"\n\n\"Are you guys being weird?\" I asked my Dad's chest cavity. \"I feel like you're being weird.\"\n\nDad sighed. \"Pizza?\"\n\n\"One large pepperoni and a half and half mushroom pepperoni and ham pineapple,\" I reported like a good son.\n\nHe ruffled my hair.\n\n\"That's a good mini-me.\" I refused to let go of him, so chuckling, he marched us both over to the couch. \"Can I sit?\"\n\n\"No.\" I couldn't hug the shadows out of his eyes, but I was never going to let that stop me from trying.\n\nI never looked at him without my sunglasses.\n\n\"Huh.\" He said. And then, \"You know, I got the most fascinating call from your school earlier today - \"\n\nI let go of him. \"I hate you.\"\n\nHe laughed softly as he sunk onto the couch. I sat next to him and separated the small stack, opening them both to check which one was which. Mom came in with the paper plates, napkins and -\n\n\"Um.\" She placed the canvas backpack at my feet with a grimace. Dad stiffened. \"Why'd you bring the Bag of Holding?\"\n\nShe then made this strange pained expression.\n\n\"Uh oh,\" Dad said.\n\nMom had a special look for what Dad called Quantum Stupidity. It's Stupid she could see coming, but got Stupider every time she looked. A little disturbed, I slowly grabbed a regular pepperoni and a ham and pineapple slice.\n\nThere was a knock at the door.\n\nMom got up to answer it.\n\nStanding on the other side of the door were two men in classical Greek chitons, cloaks and sandals like it was the normal thing to do. The tall one had curly black hair, zephyr blue eyes and elfin features. He carried a sleek phone in one hand with an extended antenna that had two small snakes twinned around it. I think...that's literally an iPhone with a caduceus attached to it. The shorter, blond haired man had a clipboard and ball point pen.\n\n\"Hermes,\" the black haired man introduced himself shortly. He jerked his head towards his companion. \"Milos.\" He grimaced. \"By the authority of Zeus Olympios, King of the Gods of Olympus, Zeus Agoraeus of the Dodekatheon and Zeus Astrapios of the Sky, we've come to investigate a reported cross-pantheon violation regarding the rearing of the Greek demigod, Perseus Stele.\"\n\n\"What?\" I said, bewildered.\n\nCross-pantheon violation?\n\nThat's a thing?\n\n\"We would appreciate your cooperation. It will help us resolve this in a just and timely manner,\" Milos said like he was reading off an index card. \"Please state your name for the record.\"\n\n\"The Mórrigan,\" Mom replied easily.\n\nHermes' eyebrows rose.\n\n\"Uh. What... is that?\" Milos asked as he flipped pages on his clipboard. \"That's - that's Norse, right?\"\n\n\"Celtic.\" Her voice was frozen.\n\n\"You guys are still around?\" Milos blurted out. He grunted as Hermes sharply elbowed him.\n\n\"I apologize for him. Sensitivity training isn't what it used to be.\"\n\n\"What the actual fuck?\" Dad whispered. He was staring at his drink as if it had betrayed him.\n\n\"I am afraid the rules and regulations of Olympus are clear and absolute in this matter,\" Hermes said. \"As a Greek demigod, we are required by law to remove the boy from foreign influence until such a time that he is claimed by his godly parent.\"\n\nMilos was speed writing something on the clipboard, finishing with a flourish and a proud smile as he presented my mother with a yellow slip of paper.\n\n\"You have been summoned to appear before the Dodekatheon.\" Milos said proudly. \"As a member of a Class Four pantheon, you have seven days to respond. Failure to do so will result in penalties.\"\n\nMom took the slip. \"I understand.\"\n\nI did not!\n\nHermes nodded. \"Thank you for your understanding. Come along, kid.\"\n\n\"Wait,\" I grunted, beyond confused. \"What?\" I slowly stood up, reflexively grabbing my canvas backpack and keeping a firm hand on my paper plate. \"What is - Mom?\"\n\n\"Go with them, Perseus,\" she said softly. She turned her back to the door and slowly, one corner of her lips curled upwards. Her black eyes glittered with vicious amusement. \"I am certain your Greek parent will not wait long to claim you.\"\n\nHermes made a sympathetic noise, but said nothing.\n\nI swallowed the lump in my throat and slowly walked to the front door. I swung my bag up onto my shoulder. My mother pressed a kiss into my hair when I reached her. I got a brush of a feeling.\n\nPatience.\n\nHonestly, that was what kept me from absolutely losing my shit by a thread.\n\nWhat even -\n\n\"Okay, so.\" I glanced at the two Olympus stooges as the door closed, leaving me alone in the small hallway to the elevator with them. I've been in this hallway over a hundred times, but all of the sudden it was too small. I felt like the walls were closing in. I opened my mouth as if just speaking would push back against the black feeling in my stomach. \"I guess I'm being confiscated now?\"\n\nHermes dragged a hand down his face.\n\n\"Yeah,\" he said eventually. \"Yeah. Let's call it that. It sucks, but the law's the law.\"\n\n\"No appeals, huh?\" I muttered.\n\nHermes snorted. \"Appealing the Fates...good luck with that.\"\n\nIt is not all bad, young one, one of the snakes said. Because god, apparently? Whatever. Talking snakes. Not the first talking critter I've seen. You belong with your own.\n\n\"Camp Half-Blood?\" I asked, just to make sure I wasn't going to be stuffed into a cell.\n\n\"You know it, that makes things easier.\" Hermes turned to Milos. \"You know the drill, file the paperwork. In triplicate.\"\n\n\"But - \"\n\n\"You're still around?\" Hermes mocked him as the blond flushed.\n\n\"Got it, Boss.\" Milos disappeared in a breeze of wind.\n\n\"Idiot.\" Hermes turned back to me. \"You might want to close your eyes. I'm told the first time is the hardest.\"\n\nI squeezed my eyes shut. The lurch was not great. The sudden noise of dozens of people talking was almost worse. I opened my eyes and found myself standing in an old style Greek pavilion on a hill overlooking the sea. A large brazier burned in the center and there were nymphs and satyrs moving between the long tables. There were kids everywhere, staring at me over their plates of barbeque. The noise slowly dropped as more and more people realized I was there.\n\nI was still holding my pizza.\n\n\"Nice entrance,\" A chubby black haired man with a red nose and a tiger print shirt grunted from one of the tables. \"Who the hell are you?\"\n\n\"Uh, Perseus Stele.\" I said. \"Hermes...sent me.\"\n\nHermes fucking literally just dumped me here.\n\nThe man rolled bloodshot blue eyes and pointed to a table already full. Some of them were even sitting on the ground. A few looked like they could be related, something about their noses and mouths. Some shared eye color, but a lot of them didn't look anything like each other at all. What they did share was this expression. The whole table as one looked resigned.\n\n\"Cabin 11.\"\n\n\"That's nice?\" I said slowly. \"But - \"\n\nA thousand tiny, sparkling stars appeared around me and trailed upwards to a point above my head. I watched as they formed a gleaming holographic image: A blood red spindle of golden thread.\n\nA blond haired, grey eyed girl from a table filled with other grey eyed kids spoke up in the sudden hush.\n\n\"Who...is that?\"\n\n\"Well,\" the hungover man said.\n\nHe took a long pull from his Diet Coke.\n\n\"Fuck.\"\n\nAn Undertow of Sand\n\nA PJO Fanfiction​\n\nI'm going to take a second here to recap.\n\nMy day at school literally went to shit. My mother thinks she's funny (she's not). And Olympus, the government of the Greek pantheon, has stupid rules. Oh, you're Greek. So we Greeks rule over your Greek, and we don't want you raised by a non-Greek god because they have cooties. Stay at the Greek camp and let your Greek parent claim you because you're Greek. It reminded me of one of my grandparents' crazy neighbors. Old guy was still butthurt Germany lost.\n\nGreeeeeek.\n\nAnd then she does and the reaction she gets is 'Who is that?' - what do they even teach demigods these days - and 'Well, fuck.'\n\nToday needs to stop.\n\nSeriously.\n\n\"Okay,\" I said harshly into the silence. \"I'm not familiar with how you people do things? But - \"\n\nThe hung-over man stood, hands up in surrender, grumbling something. I think I heard the name 'Chiron.' As in that one centaur trainer dude? Back in the day, if you wanted your demigod to amount to anything, you'd have Chiron train them.\n\nDiet Coke Man rounded the table, making motions for the rest of the kids to stand and pinning anyone a bit too slow with a harsh look. He stopped a couple of feet from me and cleared his throat. Then he knelt.\n\n\"All hail Perseus Stele, son of Ananke.\" It got really quiet when her Name was spoken out loud, like someone had turned the volume down on the universe. Tiger print shirt guy paled as my back straightened. I felt a smile slip onto my face.\n\nMom had always been more as Ananke. It was the older, more powerful Name and having her attention like this was rare. If I had to make a comparison, it was the difference between your Mom giving you a hug in private and your Mom giving you a hug while wearing her crown in front of the cameras. It was just different somehow. Mom was Mom, but there was something about knowing this Name had me, made it special.\n\nThe campers didn't seem very happy though. Everyone looked alarmed. Their mouths were moving, but her attention crushed all of the sound.\n\nDiet Coke mumbled into the still air. \"Protogenoi of Fate, Inevitability and Compulsion. First of Chaos. Mother of the Moirae, of Darkness, of the Celestial Sky. The Great Serpent, Eater of the Bloody Tongues, The Ruiner, The Beautiful One, The Thousand Mirrors -.\"\n\nI had a feeling he could have kept going with those Names, but the fire in the center brazier suddenly snapped at full volume, making everyone jump. The chubby man I was beginning to suspect was a god bent over completely, forehead to the ground.\n\n\"Whoa, no!\" My smile fell off my face. Some people might like having others bow before them, but I didn't. Mom deserved that, but not me. I was just her kid. \"No, no, no, no.\" There was a shift in the air. My ears popped. \"Mom! No.\"\n\nNoise flooded back into the pavilion as Mom lost interest.\n\nThat...stung a little.\n\nOkay, it stung a lot.\n\nShe was...wasn't she going to...fix...this?\n\nShe saw nothing wrong with me being here? I thought - in a year or two maybe, and planned. I imagined both my parents dropping me off at camp, maybe with Cliff tagging along just to see what it was all about. The Greeks knew about the dog-headed, as long as he kept the Egyptian to himself, they wouldn't have a clue. Dad would have loved a tour. It would be a fun couple of months and then I'd go home.\n\nThis was a test, right?\n\nIt had to be a test.\n\n\"You can all get up,\" I said uncomfortably. The camper kids didn't look like they were ready to believe me. The lone adult did though and I smiled weakly. \"So...Cabin 11 you said?\"\n\n\"Ah,\" Diet Coke guy said. I followed his gaze up. The red spindle of golden thread was still hanging over my head. Just slowly spinning around.\n\nMenacingly.\n\n\"I'll...clear out a room at the Big House?\" The spindle bobbed. He gestured towards the table he had been sitting at with a few nymphs and two boys. \"And...there's room at the table for Cabin 12.\"\n\nThe spindle faded.\n\nThe man closed his eyes, pinched the bridge of his nose and took several deep breaths. I'll say this right now, I was pretty good at identifying gods. Mom's drilled me on it often enough and there's always something giving them away. Usually, it was the eyes. 'Eyes are windows to the soul' isn't just a saying. Pretending to be a normal human or an animal was a classic god trick, but usually the Mist had to give them a hand in looking like a mortal. Even Mom needed to rely on it to help her blend in.\n\nThe Walmart greeter being able to see their own deaths whenever they looked at her would have given the game away. But it's hard to pretend to be mortal when you don't know what mortality even is.\n\nThis guy was kind of weirding me out though. I could maybe-sorta-kinda feel divinity? But he looked like a cherub that reached middle aged in a trailer park. His red nose was probably a coke habit and the bloodshot blue eyes were the booze.\n\nI tried not to let all the quiet stares of the campers bother me when Maybe God motioned for me to follow him out the pavilion.\n\nThe rest of Camp Half-Blood was sprawled out at the base of the hill. To the left there was a massive structure like an artificial cliff overseeing an amphitheater. A large lake fed by an ocean-bound river sat next to an open rectangle of twelve gleaming cabins and a more mundane elongated building that was probably...the bathrooms? Other large buildings and clear spaces, including what looked like an arena, almost looked unreal in the setting sun. Half-modern and half transplanted out of ancient Greek history. Large gardens ran right up to the borders of a foreboding forest and a large sky-blue farm house-mansion thing marked the camp's entrance.\n\nThere were stragglers coming up the hill towards the dining pavilion. A few older campers. Some nymphs and satyrs including one oddly...familiar...looking one in an orange Camp Half-Blood T-shirt…\n\nI know that satyr?\n\nI stopped walking. The satyr saw me and at first he smiled a bright, goofy grin, before flinching and suddenly looking very, very guilty. He had wispy facial hair and acne, putting his age anywhere from fourteen to a young looking sixteen.\n\nI know that satyr.\n\nI dropped my bag on the ground. I turned and handed the chubby god guy my paper plate of pizza - \"Can you hold that for a sec? Thanks.\" - and marched over, a big smile on my face. \"Hey, G-Man!\"\n\nGrover Underwood looked relieved. \"You made it! I - \"\n\nI punched him in the mouth.\n\nSatyrs roamed the world looking for Greek half-bloods to guide to Camp Half-Blood. Safety in numbers, although I heard there was some kind of barrier around the place now too. Demigods with only mortal guardians had to defend themselves.\n\nI didn't need protection. I had my mother.\n\nI knew he knew that. That had to be the reason for his slip earlier, when he called her My Lady. It was the traditional address for female deities. I bet he's the one that made the report bringing Hermes to our door so Olympus could take me away.\n\n\"Thanks,\" I spat at his crumpled form. \"Protector.\"\n\nChubby God (I had no idea which one this dude was, but pretty sure it was a god) had a constipated look of almost-amusement on his face when I took my pizza back. I bit back a snarl and just stuffed my pepperoni pizza slice into my mouth.\n\nWe continued walking down the hill into the camp in an uncomfortable silence. I had nothing to say. I was still angry. I was pretty sure this guy wasn't Zeus, so complaining to him was not going to do much. My Mom apparently had different priorities than I did. I could run, but that would mean living on the street dodging monsters while Dad slowly lost his mind worrying about me. It would be just like Mom's tests, except it wouldn't end.\n\nI couldn't do that to Dad.\n\nI let out a long breath. My gut churned. It was almost painful.\n\n\"I guess I just stay...for the summer?\" I bit my lip. \"Like a normal camper.\"\n\n\"Normal camper,\" he snorted. He gave me a look out of the corner of his eyes. \"I'm not gonna lie, kid,\" he grumbled. \"You existing? It's shitty.\" He tensed then, glancing around like he was expecting to be jumped from the bushes. When nothing happened, he relaxed and motioned with his hands. \"The timing? Very shit. The parent? Double shit. And you're a little shit, don't try to deny it.\"\n\nOkay. He had me until the second half.\n\n\"I aim to please.\" I said sarcastically.\n\nHe rolled his eyes.\n\n\"One of those,\" he mumbled. \"Look, Peter - \"\n\n\"Percy,\" I cut in.\n\n\"Whatever. It's nothing personal.\" He said in an almost conciliatory tone. \"You just mean the end of the world.\"\n\nI almost stopped walking again, before remembering.\n\n\"Oh right, that Prophecy thing?\"\n\nChubby God did stop walking. He pinned me with this narrow eyed look. It might have been scary if he wasn't wearing a Hawaiian tiger print shirt over a gray wife beater, if his nose wasn't pulling a Rudolph and if he didn't look completely hungover. I'm sure there is a story behind a literal god that can look however they want looking like a deadbeat, but for the life of me I had no idea what it was.\n\nWas he cursed?\n\n\"You know about that.\" He said slowly. It was hard to get a read on the emotion in his voice.\n\nMostly because I was still wondering if he was cursed.\n\nHe's probably cursed.\n\n\"I got told when I was nine,\" I answered him. Dad had taken me and child-sized Apollo out for a game of laser tag. Apollo had cheated (outrageously) and then dropped the bomb on both of us while we were eating chili dogs that I was the center piece to a Great Prophecy. Signed, sealed and delivered by the Oracle of Delphi, Apollo's most famous prophetess.\n\nHe flubbed the delivery.\n\nLet me tell you, there is nothing like a chili dog after being told you'll probably die on your sixteenth birthday.\n\nAll three of us came back from our boys' day out bawling.\n\nMom was unimpressed.\n\nThe thing about Prophecies is that they all have one thing in common: Shit happens. If you are lucky, your Prophecy starts and stops with a broad strokes 'how to fix shit happening.' If you are unlucky, it goes into detail and if your luck is abysmal, it will tell you that shit can't be fixed at all.\n\nMine went into detail.\n\nMom told me not to worry about it. I figured she would know. Fate is her thing. I know you're probably thinking 'You were nine? Maybe it was a white lie.'\n\nNo.\n\nMom doesn't lie. Not to me.\n\n\"I don't see the problem,\" I said. \"I just have to not.\"\n\nChubster shook his head and started walking again. \"And we're supposed to take your word for it?\"\n\n\"Yes?\" I said, confused. \"I like the world the way it is.\"\n\n\"Everyone says that,\" he replied, sounding tired. \"Until they're offered something they want more, or they have nothing to lose.\" I frowned. There was nothing I wanted that badly. I had everything to lose. \"You've got years to change your mind,\" he continued, like he could hear what I was thinking. His voice picked up. \"Best case scenario, you're disqualified for the crime of dying while heroic! Win-win.\"\n\nI gave him a flat look.\n\nIf this jerk was an Olympian, we were two for two on assholes.\n\n\"Sure,\" I drawled. \"I'll get right on that. Mom will love it.\"\n\n\"She's Fate, or something. Apparently.\" He gave me a sick looking smile. \"Ball's in her court.\"\n\nI relaxed a little.\n\nI didn't often think about it, because it was a bit too big to wrap my head around. The personification of Fate was my mother.\n\nThe ball was always in her court, wasn't it?\n\nBut it's our choices that make our destiny, I remembered.\n\nAnd Mom doesn't lie.\n\nI adjusted my backpack and started munching on my ham and pineapple before my pizza got too cold. It looked like we were headed right for the big blue farm house. I guess that was the 'Big House' I would be bunking in. It had four floors and some kind of deck running around the outside. We swung past the bathrooms, allowing me to dump my empty plate in a trashcan. The shortly cut grass gave way to packed dirt. The twelve cabins were arranged in a large open rectangle, one for each throne on Olympus. It was half-funny and half-annoying that the cabins looked exactly how Apollo described.\n\nHis was solid gold, shining with the light of the setting sun. Artemis totally did steal his idea with an all silver cabin that would do the same with moonlight. Ares had no taste at all with badly painted red walls on a squat military style barracks and barbed wire on the roof for no reason. Aphrodite's was a 1950s doll house. Demeter's cabin needed a hobbit door. Dionysus just threw grapevines on his cabin. Athena's was boring. Hephaestus gave his kids a factory, Hermes' was a dump. Zeus and Hera didn't have summer camp cabins so much as miniature banks complete with Hellenic columns and Poseidon's was the best made out of seastone with seashells and coral on the walls.\n\nCamp Half-Blood was a summer camp for Greek demigods, but more than just the Twelve had half-mortal kids. Or adopted kids, in Artemis' case. I'm proof of that.\n\n\"Where do the others go?\" I asked my guide. \"The other gods' kids. The Big House too?\"\n\n\"Cabin 11.\" Chubster grunted.\n\nMy eyes swung back towards the run down building and its peeling brown paint. A caduceus was etched into the door and painted in with flaking gold. Cabin 11, Hermes. The God of Travelers.\n\n\"That's it?\"\n\nHe grunted an affirmative and I swallowed.\n\nOh.\n\nThat was why their table at the mess pavilion was so full.\n\nThat didn't make a lot of sense to me. It wouldn't kill anyone to have a neutral cabin or two, right? Or a neutral table? Just enough to fit everyone comfortably. Hestia used to have a throne on Olympus. She was not only the eldest but neutral. Even if she would never have a demigod, she was still the goddess of Family and Home. Trusting her with kids should be a no brainer?\n\nDid Hades have kids? Did they just get stuffed into Cabin 11 too? He's one of the 'Big Three.' Even if he didn't have a throne on Olympus, he was still Lord of the Underworld. They wouldn't…\n\nI looked over the cabins again.\n\nExactly twelve.\n\nMaybe Hera?\n\nGoddess of Familial Love, right?\n\nOr am I stupid?\n\n...I'm stupid.\n\nMaybe not Hera.\n\nTrusting Hera with any number of demigods was...probably a bad idea, now that I thought about it. Like classical Greek tragedy bad. She was the reason Heracles nearly Total Party Killed his entire family and killed his best friend. She put him through some shit, is all I'm saying. For the crime of being her husband's bastard. And he wasn't the only one.\n\nShe had a cabin just slightly smaller than the eternal playboy Zeus'. A pretty, useless, empty building.\n\n\"Can't we just build more cabins?\" I asked.\n\n\"You can sign that petition Larry Castillo whoever sends to Olympus every summer,\" Chub said uncaringly.\n\nMy eyes caught on the large campfire in the middle. There was a small girl about seven or eight years old in brown robes kneeling next to it, poking at the coals with a stick that refused to burn. Was she - had she been there a second ago?\n\nShe felt me staring, I think. Her head turned to look at me and her eyes were literally on fire.\n\nWhich was, uh, new.\n\nI blinked.\n\nOh.\n\nOh!\n\nI know who that is!\n\nGrinning, I waved at my favorite goddess with both arms. She gave me a small, dimpled smile and raised a hand.\n\nHestia Prytaneia and Hestia Potheinotáti, I prayed with the only Names she allowed herself to keep. They meant 'of the Hearth' and 'the Beloved' respectively. I wanted to make sure she heard me. You are awesome and adorable. Your dad was an ass. Keep up the good work.\n\nHer eyes widened as I gave her a double thumbs up for good measure before turning back forward.\n\nI was led across a small, narrow vine bridge across a slim river. Up close, the Big House was huge. It loomed, making me wonder what all the rooms were used for. The deck around the house was littered with lawn chairs and tables. On the top of the house, there was a bronze eagle weathervane with still wind chimes that was definitely not what it seemed. When we rounded the house to the front, someone was waiting for us.\n\nIt was a tall woman in business casual. A white blouse with gray stripes on her shoulders and matching gray pants. I was pretty sure it was a goddess, but I could be wrong. Chubster was making me doubt myself.\n\n\"Dionysus,\" the maybe-goddess said tightly, surprising me.\n\nSo deadbeat god was an Olympian. I am…\n\nI am actually not surprised at all.\n\n\"And you must be the son of the Serpent,\" she continued as we drew closer. She had a voice made for karaoke, but I think she would murder anyone who tried.\n\nShe looked like that kind of person.\n\n\"I guess?\" I said. I guess it was like calling a Poseidon kid 'son of the Earthshaker.' \"Percy Stele.\"\n\nShe had black hair that curled at the ends and eyes that reminded me of the coral skeletons I saw in a marine museum as a kid. Black Coral, I think? At first, it was just dark gray, but it was made up of millions of spots of other colors, blue, red, yellow, green and more like a color collage. It made her eyes shine like an oil spill. Like some kind of weird optical illusion.\n\nShe inclined her head. \"Athena.\"\n\nOkay.\n\nSo that was another Olympian.\n\nI -\n\nHuh.\n\nMeeting the hungover God of Parties kind of hit different from a Goddess of Strategic War.\n\nI smiled and tried to look harmless. \"Not as Athena Promachus, I hope?\"\n\nIf she was here as a war and battle Name, I might be in trouble.\n\nHer eyes widened a little before her face blanked again.\n\n\"No, I did not think it was necessary,\" she said smoothly. \"I speak to you as Athena Areia, Polias, Hygieia and Glaukopis in one.\" Her eyes searched my face. Something told me she couldn't see through my sunglasses, but that didn't stop her from trying. \"And you know what that means, don't you?\"\n\n\"Judge, Protector, Physician and Observer,\" I recited respectively.\n\nThose weren't the literal translations. 'Glaukopis' meant something like 'bright eyed' or 'owl eyed,' but you get the idea. It was like equipping a perk in a video game, or a title in a Role Playing Game. If my Paladin earned the epithet 'Vampire Slayer,' and all it meant was 'I killed 2 vampires yesterday and almost died?' Then that would be pretty lame. Instead, it meant I killed a lot of vampires. I got good at killing vampires. I was known for killing vampires and gimme that +2 to damage rolls against vampires!\n\nIf my Paladin was then ambushed by werewolves, I would be back to square one. However, there was nothing stopping me from earning a 'Werewolf Slayer' title. If I worked hard enough, my divine warrior could gain a title for underwater whistling. A Paladin wasn't built for that, but I could.\n\nThe Young gods worked the same way.\n\nAthena was still a Goddess of Wisdom, Handicrafts and Strategic War just like my Paladin didn't just randomly lose Lay on Hands, but her Names shaped her focus.\n\nApollo was Apollo, but it was the Prophet I"
