        "text": "Letters to Pandas From Schoolchildren\n\nEuropean Vacation\n\nParis, France\n\nLe Pompidou\n\nGrand Louvre\n\nFrom Terminal to Galleria\n\nLondon, United Kingdom\n\nThe World Museum\n\nBack to Canada\n\nTO BE CONTINUED IN PART 7\n\nWelcome back everyone to my blog posts. It’s been a long couple of odd months, but I’m back and ready to do another WordPress article about all the famous works of art I’ve seen in my lifetime. I’ve been busy for a while as I took a five day long online coding class in February 2021 and I managed to gain back access to my old Flickr which means I can still upload pictures to the website and I don’t have to use the WordPress image uploader anymore (unless I decide to use pairs) which saves me some space on this website. While I don’t use this website as much as I used to, I still have plenty of projects planned for this website and without further adieu, let’s get right into it:\n\nLetters to Pandas From Schoolchildren\n\nEuropean Vacation\n\nFor the first half of the 2015 summer season, me and my family went on a two week vacation to Europe where we regrouped with our Dad who had nearly completed the final months of his year-long posting in Lebanon. We went to several art museums while we were in the area along with several public art sculptures I’ve seen in both the City of Light and The Big Smoke (historical monuments and statues of public figures will be saved for another topic):\n\nParis, France\n\nWhile I can’t remember what the name of this place was called, these works of art were on display in an art gallery space set up near the Luxembourg Gardens. Some of the pieces they had, while I can’t remember their names or the artists who made them, were jade sculptures of naked women, oil on canvas landscape paintings, red balloons taped onto a plexiglass panel wall, and a bronze piece of a boy in the mouth of a Chinese dragon (L’enfant et dragon).\n\nLe Pompidou\n\nOne of the first real art museums that we stopped by during “European Vacation II” was the Centre Pompidou: a massive multicomplex building in Paris that was named after French president Georges Pompidou. Opened in 1977, it features a unique architecture featuring pipe-like stairways that lead all the way up to the building’s top floors that contain institutions like the Bibliothèque publique d’information, IRCAM; a centre for music and acoustic research, and the Musée National d’Art Moderne: the largest modern art museum in all of Europe. Along with several branches across the world being featured in several French language films, Electric Light Orchestra used this building for the music video of their song “Calling America” and is featured in the cover art for JJ Burnel’s 1979 album Euroman Cometh. A fifth floor room of the Centre Pompidou featured as the office of Holly Goodhead (played by Lois Chiles), in the 1979 James Bond film Moonraker, which in the film was scripted as being part of the space complex of the villainous Hugo Drax (Michael Lonsdale). Located outside the building and pictured on the above photo’s left side is Horizontal, a monumental artwork of 4.5 tons and 7 meters done in 1974 as the last sculpture by Alexander Calder. It was last shown at an exhibition in La Defense in 1992, but was never shown again to the public after that until 2011 when it was welcomed back to the Pompidou where it has remained outside since then. Even though it was renovated for a re-opening on January 1st 2000, the Pompidou is currently closed for an extensive renovation that is expected to be completed in four years. Many of the artworks displayed in the Musée National d’Art Moderne (opened in 1947 and originally housed in the Palais de Tokyo) that we saw during our visit include:\n\nOften known by his nickname Balthus, Balthasar Klossowski de Rola was born to Polish parents in Paris on February 29th 1908. His father, Erich Klossowski, was an art historian who wrote a noted monograph on Honoré Daumier and his mother, Elisabeth Dorothée Spiro Klossowska (known as Baladine Klossowska), was descended from Russian Jewish emigrants. Balthus’s older brother Pierre Klossowski (born 1905) later became a noted writer and philosopher. Balthus visited Florence in 1926 where he copied many frescos by Renaissance master Piero della Francesca which were highly influential to his artwork. From 1930 to 1932 Balthus lived in Morocco. He was drafted into the Moroccan infantry in Kenitra and Fes, worked as a secretary, and sketched his painting La Caserne (1933). In 1933 he moved to Paris, taking a studio in the Rue de Furstemberg. Later he would move to another studio at the nearby Cour de Rohan. Balthus showed no interest in modernist styles such as Cubism. His paintings were realistic but introverted, in the manner of the second generation of Surrealist painters such as Salvador Dalí, who often used realistic techniques to depict psychological motifs or dream images. Balthus often depicted pubescent girls in erotic and voyeuristic poses. One of the most notorious works from his first exhibition in Paris was The Guitar Lesson (1934), which caused controversy due to its sadistic and sexually explicit imagery. It depicts a young girl arched on her back over the lap of her female teacher, whose hands are positioned on the girl as if to play her like a guitar: one hand near her exposed vulva, and the other hand grasping her hair. Throughout his career, Balthus rejected the usual conventions of the art world. He insisted that his paintings should be seen and not read about, and he resisted any attempts made to build a biographical profile. Though a 1996 documentary named Balthus Through the Looking Glass was made by Damian Pettigrew which followed the artist’s work in his studio; filmed four years before his death in 2000. This painting right here, titled Grande composition au corbeau (1983-84) was acquired from Donald Newhouse. While not very widely known by most casual art enthusiasts, Balthus was popular enough to have his Switzerland funeral accompanied U2 lead singer Bono and in Thomas Harris’ book Hannibal, its mentioned that Hannibal Lecter is Balthus’ cousin. Balthazar is one of the few “modern” artists to be represented in the Louvre as his painting The Children (1937) was acquired by them from the collection of Pablo Picasso.\n\nOn display here are several oil on canvas paintings by Barnett Newman (1905-1970) who is considered by many to be one of the major figures in abject expressionism and one of the foremost color field painters. The left picture features Not-Here There which was done in 1962 as his 81st painting and is mainly a gold stripe against a cream white background. The one in the middle is Jericho which was done in 1969 and is a giant black triangle with a single red line dashing down. The artwork on the right is Shining Forth (To George) which he painted in 1961. A large white canvas with three black vertical lines in both the left, middle and right, this painting was done as a tribute to Barret’s brother who passed away in February 1960.\n\nHenri Emile Benoit Matisse (1869-1954) was a French artist, best known for his use of colour and his fluid, and original draughtsmanship. Along with Pablo Picasso, Matisse is commonly regarded as one of the artists that helped define the revolutionary developments in the visual arts during the beginning of the 20th century as the intense colorism of his paintings from the 1900’s brought him notoriety as one of the Fauves (wild beast). The Pompidou’s art museum boasts several works of art made by Henri Matisse with the one in the first photo being one of five busts he made of a model girl named Jeanne Verdin [Jeanette IV, 1911) where in each series, Matisse would dramatically reconfigure traditional representations of the human face. Other versions are owned by the Museum of Modern Art in New York and the Fondation Beyeler in Basel, Switzerland. The Post-Impressionist style painting in the second photo is a portrait Henri made of a private art collector in 1916 named Auguste Pellerin II (1853-1929). A very important figure in the 20th century industry, much of his collection consisted of artwork from Edouard Manet and Paul Cezanne. The painting in the third photo is Interieur, bocal de poissons rouges from 1914 which features a night-lit shot of an urban apartment bedroom with the point of interest being a bowl full of goldfish next to the window. The subject of the fourth photo is Luxe, Calme et Volupte which was painted in 1904 during a very critical part of Matisse’s career as he mixed the Neo-Impressionist style with a new conceptual meaning based in fantasy and leisure never experienced up until that point. This is actually a copy of a painting over at Musee d’Orsay which we’ll be getting to much later. The last photo features a series of bronze sculptures done by Matisse with the one on the right titled Deux negresses (1908) which was inspired by African art he saw during his trip to Algeria in 1906.\n\nConstantin Brâncuși (1876-1957) was a Romanian sculptor, painter and photographer who made his career in France. Considered one of the most influential sculptors of the 20th-century and a pioneer of modernism, Brâncuși is called the patriarch of modern sculpture as he displayed an aptitude for carving wooden farm tools when he was a child and studied in several institutions (Bucharest, Munich, Ecole des Beaux Arts). Pictured here is Endless Column which is a structural pillar consisting of several repetitive pyramids on top of one another. This piece served as the basis (or is at least similar) to a giant war memorial named The Table of Silence and The Gate of the Kiss in Targu-Jiu which pays respect to all the Romanian soldiers that died protecting their lands from the Central Powers forces during WWI. An oak version of this sculpture is at the MoMA in Manhattan. Located right outside the southwest corner of the Pompidou is Atelier Brancusi which is a replica of the artist’s original studio as it looked when he worked in Paris.\n\nVicente do Rego Monteiro (1899-1970), born to a rich Pernambuco family in Recife, was a Brazillian painter, sculptor and poet who was part of the Semana de Arte Moderna exhibition and was essential to the Brazillian art industry as he perfected their avant-garde movement and helped form Brazillian Modernism. His artwork from Paris appropriated Cubist effects and portrayed legends & talismans of the Amazon River Indians, challenging the way Parisian artists portrayed them as “noble savages.” On display in the Pompidou’s art museum is O Menino e os Bichos (Tiny Beasts) from 1925 which features a naked, distraught man standing in front of an empty food bowl as several animals surround him. Vicente’s art-style was developed in a “relief” motif where it is completely two-dimensional, yet the subjects look like statues that carved into the surface.\n\nGonçalo Mabunda (1975-) is an artist and anti-war activist who started his work in the context of a project implemented since 1995, by the Christian Council of Mozambique (CCM) that has been scouring the country and collecting weapons from individuals and communities after a civil war that lasted twenty years. Most of the weapons (ie. Kalashnikovs, rockets, pistols, shell casings) that weren’t destroyed were sent to artists like Mabunda that made contemporary sculptures out of them. Much of the stuff he has made in his lifetime with these deadly ingredients include Sub-Saharan African inspired masks and anthropomorphic figures that represent the 1 million people killed in the Mozambique Civil War: some of them include the artist’s relatives. Many of the guns he collects are turned into thrones such as this exhibit in the Musee d’Moderne Arte titled O Trono de um Mondo Sem Revoltas (“The Throne of the World Without Revolt”). His main piece from the series known as Throne of Weapons is on display in the British Museum of London. In 2015, Mabunda’s works were the main subject of CNN show Inside Africa, a TV series highlighting different economic, social and cultural personalities in Africa. Former US President Bill Clinton, a fan of Mabunda’s work, commissioned the artist to create trophies for his philanthropic organization the Clinton Global Initiative. The artist’s name is inspired from a Bible verse form the book of Micah: “They will hammer their swords into ploughshares and their spears into pruning hooks.”\n\nInstalled in 2002, Cafe Little Boy by Jean-Luc Vilmouth (1952-2015) is an elaborate recreation of an all-green classroom like the one from Fukuromachi Elementary School (first established in 1873) that was destroyed during the dropping of the atomic bomb (“Little Boy” as the installation was named after) which ended World War II and led the Japanese to surrender to Allied Forces, but at the cost of damaging several buildings beyond repair and claiming countless lives; many of whom were innocent and had nothing to do with Imperial Japan’s atrocities. While Hiroshima may no longer be as radioactive as it once was during fallout, the explosion heavily destroyed all of Fukuromachi and 160 students lost their lives upon impact. Only one wall remained standing on which the survivors; who remained in the spot as it was converted into a first aid station, left messages for family and friends. This installation gradually evolves over time as visitors (up until the Pompidou’s current extensive renovation) are invited to write in-chalk messages on the walls in response to what may have been a necessary, but ultimately tragic course of history; further elaborating the collective memory. The ground in Hiroshima that was once the school is now a Peace Museum that first opened in April 2002.\n\nThomas Hirschhorn (1957) is a contemporary Swiss installation artist. Working in a wide-ranging interdisciplinary practice, his oeuvre confronts issues of political discontentment in a manner similar to David Hammons. He uses familiar, universal materials—cardboard, duct tape, plastic—to create dense, site-specific environments. Shown here at the Pompidou with a creation date of 2005 is Outgrowth: a series of over 100 Earth globes stacked on a row of shelves with tape scotches and print matter that each represent different issues present in the world (hatred, wars, bloodshed, oppression, desire for revenge) that have become far too uncontrollable. Thomas has created four other versions of this piece and one of them (Camo-Outgrowth [Winter]) was on display at the Philadelphia Museum of Art in Pennsylvania.\n\nChen Zhen (1955-2000) was a Chinese-French conceptual artist born to a family of doctors in Shanghai and his brother, Chen Zhu, was vice chairman of the National People’s Congress of China. Chen grew up in the former Shanghai French Concession during the tumultuous decade of the Cultural Revolution, and studied at the Shanghai Fine Arts & Crafts School and Shanghai Drama Institute where he became a professor in 1982. Even though he was diagnosed with autoimmune hemolytic anemia which doctors predicted would kill him in five years, Chen managed to move to Paris in 1986 where he studied at the École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts and the Institut des Hautes Études en Arts Plastiques (IHEAP), supporting himself by drawing portraits on the street. Although his career was cut short by disease, Chen had achieved international fame by the time he died of cancer as his large-scale works, exploring the topics of health and homeland, were well received globally. He was also known for using furniture and antique Chinese materials in his constructions. His mature work, created in the last decade of his life, explored “synergy” between different cultural and political environments. On display here at the Pompidou is Paris Round Table; originally commissioned in 1995 for the United Nations office in Geneva. Using a round table from a Chinese restaurant and twenty-nine chairs from five different continents around the world, the chairs merged onto the table’s rims with the front legs welded underneath represent “idealism” as everyone is seated on par with one another, to the satisfaction of all. The table is the “guanxi” (relationship) between the table and the chairs. The crux of the problem lies in how to arrange all the chairs and the table in a “normal manner,” but to create a kind of “abnormal relationships.”\n\nWassily Wassilyevich Kandinsky was a Russian painter and art theorist generally credited as the pioneer of abstract art. Born in Moscow on December 16th 1866, Kandinsky spent his childhood in Odessa (today Ukraine), where he graduated at Grekov Odessa Art school. He enrolled at the University of Moscow, studying law and economics. Successful in his profession—he was offered a professorship (chair of Roman Law) at the University of Dorpat (today Tartu, Estonia)—Kandinsky began painting studies (life-drawing, sketching and anatomy) at the age of 30. In 1896, Kandinsky settled in Munich, studying first at Anton Ažbe’s private school and then at the Academy of Fine Arts. He returned to Moscow in 1914, after the outbreak of World War I. Following the Russian Revolution, Kandinsky “became an insider in the cultural administration of Anatoly Lunacharsky” and helped establish the Museum of the Culture of Painting.” However, by then “his spiritual outlook… was foreign to the argumentative materialism of Soviet society”,[4] and opportunities beckoned in Germany, to which he returned in 1920. There he taught at the Bauhaus school of art and architecture from 1922 until the Nazis closed it in 1933. He then moved to France, where he lived for the rest of his life, becoming a French citizen in 1939 and producing some of his most prominent art. He died in Neuilly-sur-Seine on December 13th 1944. Several of his geometric abstract artworks are on display in the Pompidou’s modern art museum. Pictured on the right side of the first photo amidst the fancy furniture is Yellow-Red-Blue which was done in 1925 and features an assortment of squares, circles and triangles that almost form a human face. Czech Republic Prime Minister Andrej Babis stopped by the painting during his visit in Centre Pompidou as part of his France tour on November 12th 2018. Pictured on the left side of the second photo, though obscured by a couple of tourists is Auf Weiss II (“On White II”) which is an oil tapestry completed in 1923. The main focus of the third photo is On the Points from 1928 which features an abstract series of triangles and circles that almost resemble a courthouse.\n\nJean-Pierre Raynaud is a French visual artist born in Courbevoie on April 20th 1939 who first served the military until 1961, and later became an artist who primarily works with road signs and flowerpots filled with cement and used white ceramic tiles with black joints. His first exhibition being at the Salon de la jeune sculpture in 1964, he has since done several commissions for places like the Abbey of Noirlac, the Canadian province Quebec, a nuclear vault on the Louvre’s ceiling that was added in 1994, the Palace of the Revolution in Havana; in the presence of Fidel Castro, and more. Installed at the Centre Pompidou in 1988 was Container Zero which is a large ceramic tile cube looking somewhat like a contamination storage facility, hence the radioactive warning tape. Usually, a picture of something like a human skull or target bullseye is displayed in the center, but neither were present when I went there.\n\nHans Haacke (1936-) is a German-born artist from Cologne who lives and works in New York City, and is considered to be a leading exponent of Institutional Critique. During his formative years in Germany, he was a member of Zero (an international group of artists, active ca. 1957-1966). This group longed to re-harmonize man and nature along with restoring art’s metaphysical dimension, without using traditional devices. Some of the themes in these works from the 1960s (ie. Condensation Cube) include the interactions of physical and biological systems, living animals, plants, and the states of water and the wind. He also made forays into land art, but by the end of the 1960s his art had found a more specific focus. Most of Hacke’s work after the late 1960’s and into the 1970’s focused on the art world and the system of exchange between museums and corporations and corporate leaders; which he often underlines its effects in site-specific ways. This piece from 1985 titled MetroMobilitan, for example, is a scathing criticism of Mobil’s endorsement of the “Treasures of Ancient Nigeria” exhibit that was held at the New York MetMuseum in 1984 as Mobil was culpable in supporting the Apartheid-era government of South Africa. Juxtaposed behind the side banners promoting the exhibit along with Mobil’s disclosure is a photomural featuring a funeral for black victims while a faux stone slab rests on the floor in front of the banners as either an altar or grave marker. The artist described this three-dimensional collage as a “Surrealist’s exquisite corpse.”\n\nBorn in Krefeld, Germany on May 12th 1921, Joseph Beuys was the son of merchant Josef Kaob and Johanna Maria Margarete. Joseph attended primary school (Katholische Volksschule) and secondary school (Staatliches Gymnasium Cleve, now the Freiherr-vom-Stein-Gymnasium) at the industrial town Kleve where he spent most of his childhood. Beuys’ extensive body of work principally comprises four domains: works of art in a traditional sense (painting, drawing, sculpture and installations), performance, contributions to the theory of art and academic teaching, and social and political activities. His extensive work is grounded in concepts of humanism, social philosophy and anthroposophy; it culminates in his “extended definition of art” and the idea of social sculpture as a gesamtkunstwerk, for which he claimed a creative, participatory role in shaping society and politics. His career was characterized by open public debates on a very wide range of subjects including political, environmental, social and long term cultural trends. He is widely regarded as one of the most influential artists of the second half of the 20th century. Joseph died of heart failure in Dusseldorf, West Germany on January 23rd 1986. One of the final works he made before his death was Plight: a massive art installation of lined open space; floor to ceiling, featuring a grand piano with the lid closed and surrounded by thick vertical rolls of grey felt. It was first installed at the Anthony d’Offay Gallery in London where Joseph would play like he used to when he took piano lessons as a kid. Having lived through the Hitler Youth and Luftwaffe regiment during World War II, Plight serves as a disavow of the Nazi regime he once stood for, later forming the Green Party in Germany. The choice of grey felt stems from his self-authored origin myth in which he claimed that after a plane crash in the snowy mountains of Crimea, a nomadic tribe swathed him in felt and fat, thus saving his life and leading him to practice shamanism. Clicking the link will take you to some of Joseph’s contemporary albums they had lined up on the walls near the exhibit along with other experimental music and pieces of art inside the museum (when I feel like I am ready to upload them in the future).\n\nWhile I may not have any memories of seeing this sculpture in person, located northwest of the Centre Pompidou is the Stravinsky Fountain which was named after famed Russian composer Igor Stravinsky, and features an assortment of black mechanical sculptures by Jean Tinguely and brightly coloured works by Niki de Saint Phalle. The sculptures in the fountain; the first public one in Paris since the Palais de Chaillot fountains built for the 1937 Exposition, each represent a composition by Igor: The Firebird, the Musical Key of G, the Spiral, the Elephant, the Fox, the Serpent, the Frog, the Diagonal, Death, the Mermaid, the Nightingale, Love, Life, the Heart, the Clown’s Hat, and Ragtime. Stravinsky Fountain was part of a sculptural program launched by the City of Paris in 1978, with the Stravinsky theme suggested by IRCAM founder Pierre Boulez, and dedicated on March 16th 1983 by Mayor Chirac and Minister of Culture Jack Lang; two political enemies that avoided looking or speaking to each other, and presidential widow Madame Pompidou. (Source)\n\nGrand Louvre\n\nFor our next stop on our French vacation, we come to nowhere more recognizable than the Louvre: an art museum situated inside a historic palace, located between the Tuileries Gardens and the church of Saint-Germain l’Auxerrois. Originally a fortress built in the medieval period, it became a royal palace in the 14th century under Charles V and was used from time to time by the kings of France as their main Paris residence. Its present structure has evolved in stages since the 16th century, though much of the fortress still remains underneath the establishment. Up until Corona hysteria in 2020, the Musee de Louvre received more than 9 million visitors on a regular basis. The Louvre has been holding pieces of public art on display since 1862 as Louis XIV used it to display his royal collection while he moved into the Palace des Versailles. The Louvre Museum officially opened on August 10th 1793 with with an exhibition of 537 paintings, the majority of the works being royal and confiscated church property. For a short while, it was named Musee Napoleon and owned by the infamous ruler Bonaparte, but his reign on the Louvre came to an end in 1801 after his abdication. The collection was further increased during the reigns of Louis XVIII and Charles X, and during the Second French Empire the museum gained 20,000 pieces. Holdings have grown steadily through donations and bequests since the Third Republic. The iconic glass pyramid in front of the museum was completed in 1989 by Chinese-American architect I. M. Pei and has become a must-photo op for the museum with a skylight extending all the way down to the museum’s underground shopping mall. A breathtaking mural optical illusion was installed around the pyramid in March 2019, but only lasted for a few hours before it vanished forever. There has been an urban legend that the pyramid was constructed in 666 panes (the number of the beast) and was further popularized by the best-selling novel The Da Vinci Code. I.M. Pei would later replicate his pyramid designs for the IBM Somers Office Complex in Wochester County and Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland. Because this is the world’s largest art museum, it would take at least an entire day or more just to see every single painting in the Louvre that are divided into eight galleries. I won’t be showing you all of them, but these are just a few of the highlights:\n\nThis statue is a depiction of the falcon god Horus, one of the most significant deities in Egyptian culture as he served as God of kingship and the sky, and was worshipped from at least the late prehistoric Egypt until the Ptolemaic Kingdom and Roman Egypt. What’s noticeable about this statue that was found in the sanctuary of Isis on the field of Mars is that the legs were taken from a statue of Ramses II statue and the upper half is said to be a statue of Antinous.\n\nSerapis, also spelled Sarapis, was a Greco-Egyptian deity of the Sun first encountered at Memphis, where his cult was celebrated in association with that of the sacred Egyptian bull Apis (who was called Osorapis when deceased). He was originally a god of the underworld, but was reintroduced as a new deity with many Hellenic aspects by Ptolemy I Stoer (305-284 BCE) who centered the worship of the deity at Alexandria. Pictured here is a bronze bust of the God.\n\nThe Borghese Gladiator is a Hellinistic life-size marble sculpture portraying a swordsman, created at Ephesus about 100 BC. The sculpture is signed on the pedestal by Agasisas, son of Dositheus, who is otherwise unknown. The statue was found before 1611 in the present territory of Anzio south of Rome, among the ruins of a seaside palace of Nero on the site of the Ancient Atrium. Despite the name, Borghese Gladiator seems to resemble more of a warrior contending with a mounted combatant. Many speculate it was intended to represent Achilles fighting with the mounted Amazon, Penthesilea. At the Villa Borghese, it stood on a ground floor named for it, redecorated in the early 1780s by Antonio Asprucci. Camilo Borghese was pressured to sell it to his brother-in-law Napoeleon Bonaparte in 1807, where it was taken to Paris and acquired for the Borghesse collection in Louvre where it has since remained. Borghese Gladiator is also the subject of several paintings by Joseph Wright of Derby, Menageot, and Thomas Cole. It also served as the inspiration for the figure in the water from John Singleton Copley’s book Watson and the Shark. Copies of this statue were also made for the residences of historical figures like Isaac de Caus’ Wilton House, Charles I of England, Lord Burlington’s Cheswick House, and Thomas Jefferson’s Monticello.\n\nIn Greek mythology, the Minotaur is a mythical creature portrayed in Classical times with the head and tail of a bull and the body of a man or, as described by Roman poet Ovid, a being “part man and part bull.” He dwelt at the center of the Labyrinth, which was an elaborate maze-like construction designed by the architect Daedalus and his son Icarus, on the command of King Minos of Crete. The Minotaur was eventually killed by the Athenian hero Theseus. The Minotaur has held its tight grip on several pop cultural depictions of it and several statues of this creature can be found in places like the National Archaeological Museum of Athens. Shown here is the headless torso of a statue that belonged to the Minotaur, dating around 600 BC. While not quite related, located on 4 Rue de Sevres in Paris is a giant metal centaur sculpture by French artist Cesar Baldacinni, a member of the Nouveaux Realistes movement who created the bronze trophy for the French Film Cesar Awards ceremony.\n\nThe Winged Victory of Samothrace is a marble Hellenistic sculpture of Nike, the Greek goddess of Victory, that was created in about the 2nd century BC. It measures 244 centimetres (8.01) feet high and was possibly created to commemorate a naval action as the arch it stands looks similar to that of a ship’s prow. Other historians believe it once occupied a niche above a theater or an altar within view of the ship monument to Demetrius I Poliorcetes (337-283 BC). Rendered in gray and white Thasian and Parian marble, the figure originally formed part of the Samothrace temple complex dedicated to the Great gods, Megaloi Theoi. For many years, people though it was made as far back as the Battle of Salamis in 306 BC to the Battle of Actium in 31 BC. Some suggest it was a Rhodian monument dedicated to the victories at Side and Myonessos in 190 BC by sculptor Pythocritus. However, modern studies have debunked either of these claims as the statue’s true origins are still a mystery. First discovered in April 1863 by amateur archaeologist Charles Champoiseau, the statue is missing its head along with both of its arms, but is still in pristine condition as it sits on display at the Daru staircase in the Louvre along with a separate glass case highlighting its detached right hand that was found as recently as 1950. The only time Samothrace had to be moved was in 1939, in anticipation of World War II. There are several copies of The Winged Samothrace that can be found around the world including the former Studio Tram Tour in Walt Disney Studios Park which I had the pleasure of going on. The statue can also be seen in the music video for “APES**T” by Beyonce and Jay-Z which was prominently filmed at the Louvre.\n\nVenus de Milo is an ancient Greek statue and one of the most famous works of Greek sculptures. Created sometime between 130 and 100 BC, the statue is believed to depict Aphrodite, the Greek goddess of love and beauty, although some scholars debate that it is actually the sea-goddess Amphitrite. It is generally assumed that Miss Venus was discovered on April 8th 1920 by a peasant named Yorgos Kentrotas, inside a buried niche within the ancient city ruins of Milos: currently known as the village of Trypiti, on the island of Milos in the Aegean which was once part of the Ottoman Empire. Other discoverers have identified the archaeologist as Yorgos Bottonis and his son Antonio who found it in the ruins of an ancient theater in Castro. Australian historian Edward Duyker believs it was Theodoros Kendrotas who discovered it and was confused for his younger son Giorgios, asserting that the statue was discovered in a ruined chapel that once formed part of a Roman gymnasium. While it’s unknown who exactly found it, Venus captured local fame in France, thanks to the propaganda enforced by French authorities, and has held a prime spot in the Louvre since 1821, in exchange for the Venus de’ Mecidi sculpture that they returned to Italy years after Napoleon looted it. For reasons unknown, the Venus de Milo’s arms are missing and a filled hole below her right breast originally contained a metal tenon that would have supported the separately carved right arm. Many believe that her left arm was designed to hold an apple in her hand. Many modern artists have been inspired by this piece since she first arrived at the Louvre. (ancient eu) One of the more notable pieces was created by French Post-Impressionist painter Paul Cézanne who drew a pencil study in 1881. Another inspired work was by René Magritte, who painted a reduced-scale version of plaster, with bright pink and dark blue, entitled Les Menottes de Cuivre or The Copper Handcuffs in 1931. Even more recently are the works of Neo-Dada Pop artist Jim Dine, who often utilizes the Venus de Milo in his sculptures and paintings since the 1970s. Possibly the most widely-known adaptation is that of Salvador Dalí, with his 1936 creation Venus de Milo aux tiroirs (Venus of Milos with Drawers). The Spanish Surrealist created a half-size plaster cast, painted it, and covered the slightly open drawers with metal knobs and fur pom-poms. This inspired recreation of the famous sculpture was meant to display the “goddess of love as a fetishistic anthropomorphic cabinet with secret drawers filled with a maelstrom of mysteries of sexual desires that only a modern psychoanalyst can interpret” (Oppen & Meijer, 2019). The image of the Venus de Milo is seen constantly in modern culture, whether it be in movies, magazines, advertisements, or home decor. On October 3rd 2012, French Femen activists held an anti-rape protest by standing topless in front of the Venus de Milo, symbolizing it as the sign of a woman’s helplessness and vulnerability due to having no arms. Along with another replica I saw on the Disneyland Paris studio tour, Ripley’s Believe It or Not! had a replica of the Venus de Milo statue that they displayed in their Odditoriums at Buena Park, Times Square, and Piccadilly Circus. I even saw Venus de Milo a second time in my Paris vacation as a chocolate sculpture over at Le Petit Musee de Chocolat.\n\nLa Grande Odalisque is an oil painting by Jean Auguste Dominique from 1814 depicting an odalisque/concubine which was done as a commission by Napoleon’s sister, Queen Caroline Murat of Naples. Ingres drew upon works such as Dresden Venus by Giorgione, and Titian’s Venus of Urbino as inspiration for his reclining nude figure, though the actual pose of a reclining figure looking back over her shoulder is directly drawn from the 1800 Portrait of Madame Récamier by Jacques-Louis David. The painting with its electric mix of styles, combining classical form with Romantic themes, prompted harsh criticism when it was first shown and continued to be criticized up until the mid-1820’s where it is now regarded as an artistic classic. Grande Odalisque was purchased by the Louvre Museum in 1899 and has been on display in the Denon wing since then. The artwork was appropriated by feminist art group Guerrilla Girls for their first color poster and most iconic image being a 1989 Metropolitan Museum poster that gave the odalisque a gorilla mask with the question: “Do women have to be naked to get into the Met. Museum?” The poster was rejected by the Public Art Fund in New York and was run in advertising space on New York City buses until the bus company cancelled the lease arguing that the image was “too suggestive and that the figure appeared to have more than a fan in her hand.”\n\nTwo Hunting Dogs Tied to a Tree Stump is a painting by Italian artist Jacopo Bassano “dal Ponte” who often painted religious paintings including landscape and genre scenes, under the teaching of Bonifazio Veronese in Venice. He often treated biblical themes in the manner of rural genre scenes, portraying people who look like local peasants and depicting animals with real interest. Bassano’s pictures were very popular in Venice because of their depiction of animals and nocturnal scenes. His four sons: Francesco Bassano the Younger, Giovanni Battista da Ponte, Leandro Bassano, and Girolamo da Ponte, also became artists and followed him closely in style and subject matter. This painting was done in 1548 as a commission by Antonio Zentani, a wealthy Venetian art collector and the realism in the hunter’s dogs is quite extraordinary, setting a precedent for other artistic depictions of canine hounds in the art industry.\n\nThe Wedding Feast at Cana (“Nozze di Cana“) is a large scale oil painting done by Italian Renaissance master Paolo Caliari/Veronese in Mannerist style as a commission in 1562 by the Black Monks of the Order of Saint Benedict (OSB) to decorate the back wall of the monastery’s then-new refectory, designed by Andrea Palladio, at the Basilica of San Giorgio Maggiore in Venice. Finished in September 1563, just in time for the the Festa della Madonna della Salute that preceded in November, Paolo was paid 324 ducats and a barrel of wine for his work. On September 11th 1797, Napoleon’s soldiers plundered the picture as war booty, during the Italian campaigns of the French Revolutionary Wars (1792-1802), and was taken to the Louvre where it remains to this day, even after Bonaparte’s name and influence was scrubbed from the insitution. While earlier attempts to bring the painting back to Italy weren’t successful, the 210th anniversary of the Napoleonic looting was commemorated on September 11th 2007 where a computer generated, digital facsimile was projected on the Palladian refectory in Venice. As for the painting itself, The Wedding at Cana is a visual representation of the classic Biblical story (John 2:1–11) where during the Marriage at Cana, Jesus Christ converts water into wine as his first Christian miracle with Mary and the Apostles witnessing. This event is depicted in the grand style of the sumptuous feasts of food and music that were characteristic of 16th-century Venetian society; the sacred in and among the profane world where “banquet dishes not only signify wealth, power, and sophistication, but transfer those properties directly into the individual diner. An exquisite dish makes the eater exquisite.” Several faces and objects in the crowd each represent several themes found in the painting including red wine, human vanity, social protocol, and the co-existence of mortality and vanitas.\n\nLamassu is a Sumrian protective deity from Persian culture. Initially depicted as a female deity when it was called Lamma, it was later depicted from Assyrian times as a hybrid of a human bird, and either a bull or lion – specifically having a human head, the body of a bull or lion and bird wings, under the name Lamassu. A less frequently used name is shedu which refers to the male counterpart. Lamassu represent the zodiacs, parent-stars or constellations. Sculptures like these are typically placed at entrances in palaces, facing the street and internal courtyards. From the front, they appear to stand and from the side, they appear to have five legs. The colossal entranceway figures were often followed by a hero grasping a wriggling lion, also colossal in scale and in high relief. Many of the Lamassus in northern Iraq were destroyed by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant in the 2010’s, but several examples can still be found in other museums today. These sets were acquired from Sargon II’s palace in Dur-Sharrukin; modern Khorsabad, and can be found near a terrace of the Richelieu wing that displays several French Cour Puget/Marley marble sculptures. Lamassus have their place in pop culture as they appear in several strategy games (Magic the Gathering, Dungeons & Dragons), movies (Aladdin [1992], The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe), and were adopted as an insignia by the British 10th Army that operated in Iraq and Iran from 1942-43. In the film True Lies, two giant Lamassu statues are used by the villainous terrorists to store nuclear warheads they attempted to smuggle to the Florida Keys and the versions made for that film are stored in the headquarters of Planet Hollywood.\n\nThis 3,750-square foot painting on the ceiling of the Salles des Bronzes (erected between 1551-53), inside the Sully Wing, which is one of the largest and oldest wings inside the Louvre, simply known as The Ceiling, was painted in 2010 by Cy Twombly and is unique in that it is one of the few modern, contemporary artworks that can be found inside the nearly-thousand year old museum. The Salles des Bronzes contains more than 1,000 pieces of art created from bronze and other precious materials including helmets, Hellenic rings, the crown of laurel in gold, though the above mural stands out with its elegant blue backdrop (similar to that of the Aegean Sea) and floating 4th-century Greek discs, accompanied by the names of Hellenic sculptors. On February 16th 2021, the Cy Twombly Foundation claimed that The Ceiling was damaged during the Louvre’s extensive renovation, thanks to a new paint job on the surrounding walls and a change in lighting.\n\nA sphinx (or sphynx) is a creature with the body of a lion and the head of a human, with some variations. It is a prominent figure in many mythologies (Asian, Greek), though is most famous for its Egyptian myths where they are depicted as a spiritual guardian – often depicted as a male with a pharaoh headdress – and were often situated outside or within tomb and temple complexes. This one, titled the Great Sphinx of Tanis, dates back to the 26th century BC and was discovered in the Temple of Amun-Ra ruins in Tanis, Egypt’s capital during the 21st Dynasty and the 23rd Dynasty. All that is left of its original inscription are the parts alluding to pharaohs Amenemhat II (12th Dynasty), Merneptah (19th Dynasty) and Shoshenq I (22nd Dynasty). The Louvre acquired this piece in 1826.\n\nEven though this violates the order of paintings that I saw chronologically, I figured we’d end our tour at the Louvre with the most famous artwork they have on display there: the one and only Mona Lisa painted by Renaissance legend Leonardo da Vinci from 1503-06 to 1517; taking him plenty of years to continue.\n\nThere is a lot of mystery surrounding this oil on poplar panel painting as it bears a strong resemblance to many Resistance depictions of the Virgin Mary, and the model for this painting was Lisa del Giocondo who was a member of the Gherardini family of Florence and Tuscany, and the wife of wealthy Florentine silk merchant Francesco del Giocondo. Before that discovery, scholars had developed several alternative views as to the subject of the painting. Isabella of Aragon, Cecilia Gallerani, Costanza d’Avalos, Duchess of Francavilla, Isabella d’Este, Pacifica Brandano or Brandino, Isabela Gualanda, Caterina Sforza, Bianca Giovanna Sforza—even Salaì and Leonardo himself—are all among the list of posited models portrayed in the painting. Mona Lisa was innovative in that it was the first portrait to depict the sitter in front of an imaginary landscape (some historians believe the background was inspired by Chinese paintings), and Leonardo was one of the first painters to use aerial perspective. When looking at the photo, you’ll notice that Ms. Lisa has no eyebrows as back then, it was common for genteel women to pluck these hairs as they were considered unsightly. Of Leonardo da Vinci’s works, the Mona Lisa is the only portrait whose authenticity has never been seriously questioned and whose attribution avoided controversy. The record of an October 1517 visit by Louis d’Aragon states that the Mona Lisa was executed for the deceased Giuliano de’ Medici, Leonardo’s steward at the Belvedere Palace between 1513 and 1516 – though this was likely an error. It was kept at the Palace of Fontainebleau until Louis XIV moved it to the Palace of Versailles, where it remained until the French Revolution. The painting was later moved to the Louvre where it went on permanent display since 1797, but not before spending a brief period in the bedroom of Napoleon in the Tuileries Palace. During the Franco-Prussian War (1870–1871), the painting was moved from the Louvre to the Brest Arsenal and would return until to the Louvre until August 21st 1911 when it was stolen and went missing for two years. Several people like Guillaume Apollinaire and Pablo Picasso were brought in for questioning, though the real culprit was Louvre employee who helped construct the painting’s glass case, yet was an Italian patriot he believed that Da Vinci’s work should be seen at the Uffizi Gallery of Florence. He was caught and arrested when trying to sell it to Giovanni Poggi, and the Mona Lisa returned to the Louvre on January 4th 1914. On December 30th 1956, Bolivian Ugo Ungaza Villegas threw a rock at the Mona Lisa while it was on display at the Louvre. He did so with such force that it shattered the glass case and dislodged a speck of pigment near the left elbow. The painting was protected by glass because a few years earlier, a man who claimed to be in love with the painting had cut it with a razor blade and tried to steal it. There are countless other mishaps the painting has seen over the years, though a new queuing system was introduced in 2019 which now only allows visitors or groups 30 seconds to see the painting. In recent decades, the painting has been temporarily moved to accommodate renovations to the Louvre on three occasions: between 1992 and 1995, from 2001 to 2005, and again in 2019. On the 500th anniversary of the master’s death, the Louvre held the largest ever single exhibit of Da Vinci works, from October 24th 2019 to February 24th 2020. The Mona Lisa was not included because it is in such great demand among visitors to the museum; the painting remained on display in its gallery.\n\nToday the Mona Lisa is considered the most famous painting in the world, a destination painting, but until the 20th century it was simply one among many highly regarded artworks. Once part of King Francis I of France’s collection, the Mona Lisa was among the first artworks to be exhibited in the Louvre. President John F. Kennedy, along with his wife Jackie, and Lyndon B. Johnson were there to unveil the painting when it visited the National Gallery of Art in January 1963. One of the most valuable paintings in the world, it holds the Guinness World Record for the highest known insurance valuation in history at US$100 million in 1962. A version of Mona Lisa known as Mujer de mano de Leonardo Abince (“Woman by Leonardo da Vinci’s hand”) held in Madrid’s Museo del Prado was for centuries considered to be a work by Leonardo until it was revealed in 2012 that it was done by one of his pupils. A version known as the Isleworth Mona Lisa was first bought by an English nobleman in 1778 and was rediscovered in 1913 by Hugh Blaker, an art connoisseur. The painting was presented to the media in 2012 by the Mona Lisa Foundation. Several artists like Raphael and Salvador Dali have made other artworks inspired by this painting and Mona Lisa had made its mark in several works of pop culture including The Da Vinci Code. The Mona Lisa replica that was used for the film was on display at the temporary Movietopia exhibit in Houston, Texas around 2019. I’ve also seen a few other replicas of Mona Lisa including merchandised socks at a Hudson’s Bay store, a topless version by Erix Art at the P!Q Store as part of 30 Rockefeller Centre, a giant version part of the “Da Vinci: A Genius” exhibit held at the Ottawa Museum of Science & Technology, and even a painting made entirely out of nail polish at Ripley’s Believe It or Not! in Niagara Falls, Ontario. There are also two replicas I’ve seen in some of the Disney parks: a sunglasses version outside the Mama Melrose’s Ristorante Italiano at Disney’s MGM/Hollywood Studios and a moustached version [somewhat similar to Marcel Duchamp’s L.H.O.O.Q.) in the donkey shipping scene of Pinocchio’s Daring Journey at Disneyland Anaheim (actually a duplicate of the ride that first opened in Tokyo Disneyland and can also be found in Disneyland Paris)\n\n_____________________________________\n\nThe Petit Palais (“Small Palace”) is an art museum in the 8th arrondissement of Paris that was built for the 1900 Exposition Universelle (“universal exhibition”) and was built on a patch of land that once housed the Palais de l’Industrie (the other half is occupied by the Grand Palais). Executed in the Beaux-Arts style by Charles Girault (as praised by King Leopold II of Belgium), the tympanum depicts the city of Paris surrounded by muses as sculpted by Jean Antoine Injalbert. Several of the sculptures embellishing the exterior were done by famous sculptors like Convers, Desvegens, Fagel, Ferrary, Hughes, and Peynot. One of 14 museums in Paris that has been incorporated since January 1st 2013, the exhibits housed in the palace’s art museum display the History of Art from the beginning to the present era, feautring many works by Rembrandt, Rubens, Nicolas Poussin, Monet, Auguste Rodin, Auguste Clesinger, Jacob Jordaens, Delacroix, and more. While similar to Les Invalides, the Petit Palais has severed as the model for other public buidlings like the Royal Museum for Central Africa in Teruven and Chile’s national art museum in Santiago\n\nJoan of Arc was a heroine of France during the Lancastrian phase of the Hundred Years’ War and was canonized as a saint as helped support Charles VII and defended her country from English domination, but was tragically captured by French allies to the Englishmen and burned her at the stake. Having since become a martyr, several tributes have been made to her all around the world. Such is the case with this gilded bronze statue by Emmanuel Fremiet that was made in 1874 and erected in the Place des Pyramides in Paris, where Joan was wounded during her failed attempt to take Paris. The sculptor based this model off a young woman from Domremy, Joan’s home village, named Aimee Girod (1856-1937) and its pedestal was designed by the architect Paul Abadie. Commissioned during the Golden Age of statuary, this is only public commission by the French government from that era as all the other statues were funded by private subscriptions. Reviving a tradition from the far-right leagues, the National Front holds an annual ceremony in her honour at the statue every May Day. A bronze version of Jeanne d’Arc can be found outside the Victoria State Library in Melbourne, Australia while exact replicas of the gold version can be found across the United States (the Philadelphia Museum of Art, a World War I memorial in Portland, Oregon, and New Orleans, Louisiana as a gift from the people of France).\n\nThis piece of graffiti near a dual sided streetway staircase in Paris sports the phrase “Je Suis Charlie” which was coined by French art director Joachim Roncin and adopted by supporters of freedom of speech & freedom of the press, in response to the January 7 2015 shooting in which twelve people were killed at the offices of the French satirical weekly newspaper Charlie Hebdo by two Islamist gunmen over 2012 depictions of the prophet Muhammad, which is strictly forbidden in interpretations of Islam. In the span of just two weeks, “Je Suis Charlie” took the world by storm as everyone used it in a hashtag, wrote it in graffiti within cities beyond Paris, and was even mentioned in shows like The Simpsons. On January 12th, the publication company revealed the cover of the January 14th issue, set to be published a week after the attacks began, with the cover featuring a cartoon of Mohammed shedding a tear while holding a Je suis Charlie sign with the above caption “Tout est pardonne” (“All is forgiven”). Charlie Hebdo already had another incident in 2011 when their newspaper office was firebombed and their website was hacked, which may have been linked to an issue that month featuring Mohammed which was renamed “Sharia Hebdo.”\n\nThe Beaux-Arts de Paris is a French grande ecole whose primary mission is to provide high-level arts education and training. There are two campuses across France: the Saint-Ouen commune in the Ile-de-France region and the Saint-Germain-des-Pres quarter in Paris; pictured here. Its history is very rocky as the school was originally founded in 1648 by Charles Le Brun as the famed Academie de peinture et de sculpture. In 1793, at the height of the French Revolution, the institutes were suppressed. In 1817, following the Bourbon Restoration, it was revived under a changed name after merging with the Academie d’architecture. Held under the King’s tutelage until 1863, an imperial decree on November 13th 1863 named the school’s director, who serves for a five-year term. Long supervised by the Ministry of Public Instruction, Ecole des Beaux-Arts is now a public establishment under the Ministry of Culture. The school owns 450,000 items divided between artworks and historical books, making it one of the largest public art collections in France. The collection encompasses many types of artistic productions (paintings, sculpture, etching, furniture, decorated books) from all period of history. Many of the artists represented in their collection include Anthony van Dyck, Hyacinthe Rigaud, Jean-Honore Fragonard, Hubert Robert, Durer, and more. Many artists who were notable alumni in this institution include Albert Marquet, Alphonse Osbert, Eugene Chigot, Lydia Veneri, Yves Hernot, and Henri Matisse along with his wife Sophie.\n\nThe most defining features of the Paris Metro systems are the Art Nouveau entrances designed by Hector Guimard which he made plenty of between 1900 and1913. His cast iron designs and associated lettering came to be known as the Metro style and are preserved as historical monuments with several replicas outside France in places like Square-Victoria OACI in Montreal, the National Gallery of Art’s Sculpture Garden, the Dali Theater Museum in Figueres, stations in Moscow and Mexico City. They all take on many shapes and sizes as the one on the left resembles an average lamppost sign while the one on the right is a huge archway in a holder that extends between two risers in the form of sinuous stalks; traditionally compared to lily-of-the-valley, each bearing a light in the form of a red-orange globe reminiscent of an eye or flower. Some of the more intricate, rarer stations took the form of free-standing pavilions in a style influenced by Japanese pagodas.\n\n___________________________________________\n\nFrom Terminal to Galleria\n\nFor the last art museum we have on our Paris trip, we have the Musee d’Orsay which originally used to be the Gare d’Orsay: a Paris railway station and hotel that was built in 1900 for the Universal Exhibition by Victor Lulox, Lucien Magne, and Emile Bernard for the Chemin de Fer de Paris a Orleans; the first electrified urban terminal station in the world as well. It also used to be the Palais d’Orsay from 1810 to 1898, originally intended for the Ministry of External Relations and later assigned to the Council of State. By 1939, the station’s short platforms became unsuitable for longer trains that had come to be used for mainline services, and the Gare d’Orsay was closed to long distance traffic, though some suburban trains of the SNCF continue to use its lower levels to this day. The Hotel Palais d’Orsay went defunct at the beginning of 1973. After 1939, the station became a mailing centre during World War II, a haven for auctioneers and the Reuauld-Barrault Theatre company while the Hotel Drouot was being rebuilt, and was used to film Orson Welle’s adaptation of Kafka’s The Trial. In 1974, the Directorate of the Museum of France proposed to build an art museum in the station that would bridge the gap between the Louvre and Centre Pompidou. And so in December 1986, the Musee d’Orsay was opened by then-president Francois Mitterand with a reworked interior by Gae Aulenti. The other half of the Palais d’Orsay that wasn’t converted into the art museum was turned into Le musee de la Legion d’honneur et des ordes de chevalerie (Museum of the Legion of Honour and the Orders of Chivalry) In the main lobby, the clock designed by Victor Alexandre Frederic Laloux is still on display and one of two big clocks on the museum’s main façade can be seen from the inside, giving visitors a view of the river Seine. As you can see in the photo, there is a lot to see in the Musee d’Orsay with over 3,000 artworks on display at a time and I cannot go through all of them due to time and space issues, so here are just a few of the highlights:\n\nYoung Elephant Caught in a Trap is one of several sculptures that can be seen outside the Musee d’Orsay which first acquired it in 1985. It was sculpted by Emmanuel Fremiet and was designed for the 1878 Exposition Universelle at the Trocadero Palace along with other statues found outside the museum like Horse with Harrow by Pierre-Lois Rouillard, Rhinoceros by Henri Alfred Jacquemart, and The Six Continents by several artists. Along with the other sculptures, Young Elephant remained at the Trocadero until 1935 when the palace was remodelled into the Palais de Chaillot for the 1937 Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne. The statue was relocated to a site near the Porte de Saint-Cloud. Another Emmanuel Fremiet piece located inside the museum is a marble sculpture from 1867 named Pan and the Bear Cubs.\n\nBescanon sculptor Auguste Clesinger was commissioned by industrialist Alfred Mosselman in 1847 to make a marble sculpture of a naked female figure named Woman Bitten by a Serpent for the Paris Salon that year where it, along with Thomas Couture’s The Romans in their Decadence were the most commented-upon works. Clesinger modelled his work on a life-cast of Moseellman’s mistress, the demi-mondaine Apollonie Sabatier, later Charles Baudelaire’s muse. The direct use of a life cast as the basis for a sculpture was highly controversial during the 19th century, particularly in its realism, such as the reproduction of the model’s cellulite. Clésinger’s friend Théophile Gautier orchestrated a response to the art critics’ scandalised reviews, ensuring the sculpture’s great success. At the end of 1847, Clésinger also produced a Reclining Bacchante, slightly larger than Woman so as to confute criticisms of his technical skills with marble. Woman Bitten by a Serpent was also the inspiration for a 2008 painting by American painter Kehinde Wiley.\n\nEdouard Manet (1832-1883) was a French modernist painter who among the first of the 19th-century artists to paint modern life, and a pivotal figure in the transition from Realism to Impressionism. Born into an upper-class household with strong political connections, Manet rejected the future originally envisioned for him, and became engrossed in the world of painting. This is one of his earlier paintings named Olympia which was first exhibited at the 1865 Paris Salon and shows a nude woman lying on a bed being brought flowers by a servant; their respective models being Victorine Meurent and Laure who worked as a nursemaid in Tuileries Garden. Olympia‘s confrontational gaze caused shock and astonishment when the painting was first exhibited because a number of details in the picture identified her as a prostitute. It still continues to grow some controversy as many consider the background maid to be “racist” since she is a “stereotype with little to no critical attention of her presence” and in 2016, Luxembourg performance artist, Deborah De Robertis was arrested for laying on the floor in front of the painting nude while mimicking the pose of her subject. Even though it was modelled after Titian’s Venus of Urbino (1534), Olympia has been praised as “the pinnacle of defiance toward patriarchy” and has inspired several other nude white female paintings that also feature black female servants. One of Eduard Manet’s first paintings, Le Déjeuner sur l’herbe (The Luncheon on the Grass) from 1863, is also in the Musee d’Orsay.\n\nAlfred Émile Léopold Stevens was a Belgian painter (1823-1906) best known for his paintings of elegant modern women and had an entire family who was involved with visual art. His father in particular, who had fought in the Napoleonic wars alongside the Netherlands army of William I, was an art collector who owned several watercolors by Eugene Delacroix. On the left is The Bath which Alfred did around 1873 and depicts an apathetic Parisian demi mondaine having a bath. Above the tub there are, fixed to the wall, a swan-shaped tap; probably a refrence to the classical myth of Leda and the swan, and a white fixture in the shape of a shell. Instead of holding a bath brush, the model holds two white roses in her right hand, a symbolism of love and beauty, which crosses her body and leans against the tub’s side. A second version of this painting was said to be Vienna, though was reportedly destroyed in one of the city’s fires. On the right is What is Called Vagrancy which Alfred did around 1854 and depicts a gloomy scene of Parisian soldiers leading a mother and her ragged children away to prison for the crime of being homeless, while several posters on the background wall can be seen advertising events like an auction and ball that only the highest of society can afford to attend, adding a dose of irony to this already bleak painting. The painting struck a chord with those that saw it during its exhibition at the 1855 Universal Exhibition and Napoleon III, upon seeing it, supposedly remarked: “That will never happen again.”\n\nJean Désiré Gustave Courbet (1819-1877) from Orans, Doubs was a painter who led the Realism movement in 19th-century French painting, rejecting academic convention and the Romanticism of the previous generation of visual artists. His works laid the cornerstones for art styles like Cubism and Impressionism, and his paintings challenged the conventions society viewed on unidealized workers and peasants. Before he joined the Paris Commune “Socialist movement” which led him to imprisonment for six months and exile in Switzerland where he died, Gustave did paintings of several subjects (nudes, still lifes, land/seascapes, hunting scenes) and a few paintings from those topics can be seen at the Musee d’Orsay. Representing the nude category on the left is Nude Woman with a Dog from 1961-62 which features a female, modelled after the painter’s mistress Léontine Renaude, showing affectionate love to her pet canine. Representing the hunting scene in the middle is Killing a Deer (also known as A Deer Hunt – The Kill) from 1867 which shows a pack of hunting dogs attacking a deer collapsed on the snow ground with two characters on the right: Cusenier Jules, a resident of Ornans who is the drill while the man on horseback is Felix Gaudy of Vuillafans. The painting was influenced by The Massacre at Chios (1824) by Eugene Delacroix over at the Louvre. The painting on the right, one of the major turning points of 19th-century French art is A Burial at Ornans from 1849-50 which records the funeral in September 1848 of Courbet’s great uncle in the painter’s birthplace. Treating an ordinary provincial funeral with unflattering realism and on the giant scale traditionally reserved for the heroic or religious scenes of history painting, the painting drew both praise and fierce denunciations from critics and the public during its exhibition at the 1850-51 Paris Salon. Courbet himself remarked this painting as “the burial of Romanticism” along with some saying it represented the end of the gene hierarchy that dominated French art since the 17th century.\n\nJoaquin Sorolla y Bastida was a Spanish painter from Valencia who excelled in the painting of portraits, landscapes and monumental works of social and historical themes. His most typical works are characterizied by a dexterous representation of the people and landscape under the bright sunlight of Spain and sunlit water. Such is the case with Return from Fishing from 1894 which depicts an Impressionist-style scene of an oxen and two fisherman towing their sailboat back to shore. Joaquin made two other versions of these paintings and one of them can be seen at the Museo National de Prado.\n\nFrançois Pompon (1855-1933) was a French sculptor and animalier best known for his stylized sculptures of different types of animals with smoothed out features and emphasis on the immobility of its pose. Between 1918 and 1923, Pompon worked on the subject of owls named Chouette and each exist in several materials: wood, plaster, and bronze. The latter is on display here at the Musee Orsay. Pompon would return to the theme of owls in 1926, but were now cast as reliefs and posed in flight formation.\n\nJean-Édouard Vuillard (1868-1940) was a French painter, decorative artist and printmaker who was a prominent member of the Nabis: a group of young artists that played a large part in the transition from impressionism and academic art to abstract art, symbolism and the other early movements of modernism. Many of Vuillard’s works were influenced by Japanese prints where the subjects were blended into colors and patterns. Such defining traits can be found in his painting The Haystack (1907-08) which is based on the artist’s memories of his summer holidays in Amfreville (Calvados) where he retreated with his friends Jos and Lucy Hessel. Based on a Kodak photograph taken in 1907, which Vuillard would use several of for reference, sitting next to him in front of the haystack are his cousin Marcelle Aron and writer Tristan Bernard who would later marry each other. Now when I first wrote this part of the post, I initially thought that this painting was part of the Haystacks series by Claude Monet and while the Musee d’Orsay does have one of the largest collections of paintings from that series, the version photographed here was not part of it. Although I did see of Monet’s Stack of Wheat paintings they had at the Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nBorn on March 30th 1853, Vincent Van Gogh is a Dutch Impressionist artist who needs no introduction as he grew up in an upper-middle class family and worked as an art dealer, though gradually became depressed during his travels and suffered from psychotic episodes that lead to his suicide on July 29th 1890, along with cutting off his left ear. While he was considered a madman and a failure during his lifetime, Vincent became famous after his death and is regarded as one of the most influential figures in the history of Western art, exemplifying the romantic ideal of the tortured artist. Many of his paintings have been sold at ludicrously high prices and many of them can be found in museums like one named after him in Amsterdam and the Musee d’Orsay in which this gallery is about. In the first photo is La Meridienne (“The Siesta”); a depiction of two farmers relaxing on a hay field that van Gogh painted during his internment at an insane asylum in Saint-Remy-de-Provence. In the second image is the Portrait of Dr. Gachet: a painting Van Gogh did in 1890 of Mr. Paul, a homeopathic doctor that looked after the artist during the final months of his life (there are two versions and one of them was subsequently confiscated by Hermann Goring). The third painting is Doctor Gachet’s Garden in Auvers which Van Gogh did during a three-day stay at his physician’s house (another painting also in this museum depicts Paul’s wife, Marguerite, working in the gardens). The fourth painting is Two Young Girls (1890) which was part of a series of portraits that van Gogh did of young models he could find. The fifth photo is a still-life painting named Japanese Vase with Roses, also from 1890. In photo number six is The Italian Woman which van Gogh did in 1887 and modelled her after Agostina Segatori (1843-1910); a former model of Corot, Gerome and Manet. She and Van Gogh had a brief love affair before this painting was conceived. Photo number seven highlights Thatched Cottages at Cordeville which Van Gogh painted in May 1890 when he moved to Auvers-sur-Oise after he left the mental asylum. The final photo features none other than one of the many 35 Self-Portraits Van Gogh made of himself in 1899. While many self-portraits are often regarded as signs of vanity, Vincent only made his because he wanted to nail the practice of painting other people. Believe it or not, there was only one live photo ever taken of Mr. Gogh in 1886. Many of his self-restrained and serious portraits can be found in other museums, though I also saw another one at the Art Institute of Chicago. Clicking the link will take to one of his Bedroom in Arles paintings I also saw at the museum. One Vincent Van Gogh painting in Musee d’Orsay that I did not get a photo of was Starry Night Over the Rhone which he painted on the Rhone bank in 1888 and is a precursor to the much more iconic painting that Gogh made a year later, looking out from the window of his asylum room before sunrise; currently on display in the Museum of Modern Art in New York City. I also saw a replica version of Starry Night as a merchandised sock at Cataraqui Centre’s Hudson Bay store.\n\nWhile I may not remember seeing this piece in person or memory, one of the most famous paintings they have in the Musee d’Orsay (not before residing in the Louvre) is The Gleaners from 1857 by Normandy artist and Barbizon school founder, Jean-Francois Millet. It depicts three peasant women gleaning a field of stray stalks of wheat after the harvest, portrayed in a sympathetic fashion back in a time where the lowest ranks of rural society were received poorly by the French upper classes. One of Milet’s best known works, its imagery was paraphrased frequently in works by other works and was the subject of a 2000 French documentary by Agnes Varda, along with an inspiring an album by American jazz bassist Larry Grenadier and the name of the Gleaner Manufacturing Company which manufacture combine harvesters. It also appears in the Nintendo Switch game Animal Crossing: New Horizons.\n\nLondon, United Kingdom\n\nAnd so that brings us to the end of our Paris vacation. While we did go to Disneyland Paris for the final few days of our European vacation, we did not see any forms of public art that weren’t sculptures of famous or fictional characters (those are for another topic). Instead, we’ll be wrapping this post up with a few works of art I saw during my very short stay in the Home of the Big Ben:\n\nPictured here is Millbank House: a Grade II listed office block for the UK Parliamentary Estate in Westminster Abbey. Though what I wanna draw your attention to is Knife Edge Two Piece 1962-65, one of the earliest sculptures made by English abstract sculptor Henry Spencer Moore (1898-1986). Its form inspired in the shape of a bone fragment, Moore created the sculpture from an edition of 10 working models in 1962; many of them each in public collections. In the photo is the second cast which was donated by Moore through the Contemporary Art Society to what he believed was the City of London, but its actual ownership was undetermined for many years. It was installed at the College Green public park. formerly known as Abingdon Street Gardens, which has a two-story underground car park constructed from 1963 to 1964, and was originally a tidally flooded bank of the River Thames separated from the College Garden of Westminster Abbey by a medieval wall with a watergate. Located adjacent from the Palace of Westminster, this area is commonly used by television reporters to interview Members of Parliament. Other versions of Knife Edge Two Piece are owned by the Rockefeller family, University of Rochester, the Didrichsen Art Museum in Helsinki, Queen Elizabeth Park in Vancouver, and more.\n\nThe World Museum\n\nWe sadly didn’t have much time to spend in the British Museum which is full of many artistic treasures, but here are just some of the highlights I gazed upon with my own eyes:\n\nWhile I’ve normally tried to avoid uploading pictures of Egyptian mummy sarcophaguses as I am saving them for another subject, I wanted to make an exception for this extraordinary unique tomb from 150-140 BC known as the Sarcophagus of Seianti Hanunia Tlesnasa which dates to the Ancient Greek period and depicts the statue of an Etruscan noblewoman in reclining position with a reconstruction of her face. Dressed very elegantly with an ornate gown and jewelry while leaning on a pillow, the deceased occupant must have belonged to one of the richest families of Chiusi. The coffin (along with its skeleton still inside) was excavated at Poggio Cantarello in 1886 and has been in possession of the British Museum since 1888, though another version is in the National Archaeological Museum of Florence.\n\nIn the museum’s Enlightenment Gallery, full of several objects that aren’t ordered by a specific time period, are two marble statues on a black pedestal. The one on the left is Apollo, one of the Olympian deities in classic Greek and Roman mythology who is the son of Zeus and Leto, recognized as a god of archery along with his twin sister Artemis, goddess of the hunt. The one on the right is Discophoros, a marble copy of a bronze sculpture by classical Greek sculptor Polyclitus. This is not to be confused with Discobolus of Myron, a Greek sculpture completed at the start of the Classical period (about 460-450 BC) which depicts a youthful athlete throwing a discus. The version on display in the British Museum’s main lobby since 1805 is a marble copy of the now lost original bronze version and this one was excavated at Hadrian’s Villa in 1790 by Thomas Jenkins. The statue was also used as the logo for the 1948 London Summer Olympics.\n\nLion of Knidos is the name for a colossal ancient Greek statue depicting a lion that was quarried from Mount Pentelikon near Athens, the same marble used to build the Parthenon. Nearly complete, the statue is only missing the lower jaw and front legs, along with the fact its eyes were likely once inlaid with glass. It was first seen by British archaeologists in 1858 near the ancient port of Knidos, south-west Asia Minor (now near Datça in Turkey). Soon after it was seen by British archaeologists, the statue was removed to London where it became part of the British Museum’s collection. Although there is some debate about the age of the sculpture, in general, scholarly opinion dates it to the 2nd century BC. Since 2000, it has been prominently displayed on a plinth under the roof of the Queen Elizabeth II Great Court. Behind the lion is an advertisement for Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb which was prominently featured in the British Museum. Another piece of Ancient Greek artwork they had at the British Museum was a tiled mural of a dog sparring against a boar.\n\n_______________________________________________\n\nTraditionally known to locals as The Griffin, this dragon sculpture was created in 1880 by sculptor Charles Bell Birch as a commission by the Royal family and government to surmount a pedestal marking what were once the historic gates to the City of London known as Temple Bar. In the middle ages, London expanded city jurisdiction beyond its walls to gates, called ‘bars’, which were erected across thoroughfares. The pedestal of this column is decorated with statues by Joseph Boehm of Queen Victoria and her son the Prince of Wales, the last royals to have entered the City through Wren’s gate, which event is depicted in one of the reliefs which also decorate the structure. Charles Dickens mentioned Temple Bar in his book A Tale of Two Cities where the fictional Tellson’s Bank is near as Child & Co. used the upper rooms of the Bar as storage space. Herman Melville likened the Temple Bar to a “Dantean Gateway” in his novel The Paradise of Bachelors and the Tartarus of Maids. The dragon is also featured in Charlie Fletcher’s Stoneheart and Virginia Woolf’s The Years. As for the original Temple Bar, the entire gateway was relocated over to Paternoster Square, north of St. Paul’s Cathedral, in 2004 as a painstaking process that cost £3 million overall.\n\nFrom June to September 6th 2015, an art trail was set around the city of London with 21 double helix DNA sculptures made to support Cancer Research UK. This green white-black striped strand titled “After the race” was set up in a city park, adjacent from St. Paul’s Cathedral, which features a few chrome steel ball sculptures of their own.\n\nIn naval warfare during WWI, dazzle camouflage involved the covering of a ship’s hull with unique, bespoke geometric patterns in contrasting colours with the aim of confusing or “dazzling” an enemies range-finding efforts and rendering the ship less liable to be hit by a torpedo or shell. More than 400 warships and 4,000 merchant vessels were painted by the end of the conflict. To celebrate the centenary of the outbreak of World War I in August 2014, three vessels (along with a fourth added later) were chosen for the 14-18 NOW project commissioned by the Imperial War Museum. Many of the ships that were effected include theMersey ferryboat Snowdrop on the River Mersey (“Everybody Razzle Dazzle” by Peter Blake), the Edmund Gardner of Liverpool (“Induction Chromatique à Double Fréquence”by Carlos Cruz-Diez), and theMV Fingal of Leith (“Every Woman” by Ciara Phillips; done later in 2016). Pictured here is “Dazzle Ship London” by German sculptor Tobias Rehberger on the HMS President, a retired Flower-class Q-shop that was first launched in 1918 and moored permanently on the River Thames as a Royal Navy Reserve drill ship. One of the last three surviving Royal Navy warships of World War One, she is also the sole representative of the first type of purpose built anti-submarine vessels and paved the way for World War Two convoy escort sloops, that would later evolve into modern anti-submarine frigates. In 2016, President was moved to the Chatham so London could begin construction on the new Thames Tideway Tunnel. The ship was once docked with a sister ship named HMS Chrysanthemum, an Anchusa-class sloop launched on November 10th 1917 and was scrapped in 1995, not before she was used or the boat chase scenes in Tilbury Docks for Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, where Chrysanthemum was named Tiber.\n\nPark Lane is a major road in the City of Westminster, part of the London Inner Ring Road and runs from Hude Park Corner in the south. It was originally a simple country lane on the boundary of Hyde Park, separated by a brick wall and its current prestigious status has been commemorated by being the second-most expensive property square on the London Monopoly board. Alongside the 19th-century triumphal Marble Arch that was relocated from Buckingham Palace and a marker that commemorates 18th century executions on this spot when it was known as Tyburn, this part of London has a large public park that’s regularly used to display works of public art. On the left is She Guardian, a landscape sculpture by Russian sculptor Dashi Namdakov that was installed next to Cumberland Gate on May 11th 2015, but is normally on display at the Halycon Gallery. Depicting a mythical winged creature standing guard over her young, the idea for the work came to Dashi after a pair of Siberian hunters have him a lynx skull. While its a little hard to see, pictured on the right side is Still Water, an outdoor bronze sculpture of a horse’s head by Nic-Fiddian Green that was commissioned to replace an earlier and similar, but slightly smaller, work, Horse at Water XV. Measuring 33 feet and 10 meters tall, this piece was installed at the Marble Arch Park in 2011, though was said to have moved to Daylesford, Gloucestershire, the home of Sir Anthony and Lady Carole Bamford, who had commissioned it. In 2012, Fiddian-Green cleaned the sculpture using a cherry picker and Syria installed a similar sculpture in Rawda Square, Damascus in 2020. In the center of At-Bashy in Kyrgyzstan the small copy is located by local community as the name of the village is literally translated as “horse’s head” in one of the versions.\n\nThe Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) is a professional body for architects primarily in the United Kingdom, but also internationally, founded for the advancement of architecture under its charter granted in 1837 by King William IV and Supplemental Charter granted in 1971. It was originally named the Institute of British Architects in London and was formed in 1834 by several prominent architects, including Decimus Burton, Philip Hardwick, Thomas Allom, William Donthorne, Thomas Leverton Donaldson, William Adams Nicholson, John Buonarotti Papworth, and Thomas de Grey; 2nd Earl de Grey. The design of the institute’s Mycenaean lions medal and the Latin motto Usui civium, decori urbium has been attributed to Thomas Leverton Donaldson, who had been honorary secretary until 1839. The description in the 1837 by-laws was: “gules, two lions rampant guardant or, supporting a column marked with lines chevron, proper, all standing on a base of the same; a garter surrounding the whole with the inscription Institute of British Architects, anno salutis MDCCCXXXIV; above a mural crown proper, and beneath the motto Usui civium decori urbium “. The motto is translated “for the use of the people, for the glory of the city”. The RIBA’s mission statement is being a global professional membership body driving excellence in architecture, though has been criticized by architects outside of southeast England as a London-centric organization which does not reach out to all members in the UK. Hosted in the building during the time we passed by there was a Brutalist inspired playground designed by Assemble and artist Simon Terrill.\n\n_______________________________________________\n\nBack to Canada\n\nThat is going to be it for all the artworks I saw in Paris and London (at least for this page), but I promise that these artworks taken at the Toronto Pearson International Airport will be the last feature of this already long page:\n\nBorn in 1932, Ingo Maurer experimented with exceptional lighting systems in 1966 and started a company that mass produces and distributes them worldwide, even after his death in 2019. Commissioned by Toronto Pearson in 2003, this piece named Earthbound… Unbound consisted of a large water basin with constantly moving and floating elements including glass cubes and jet streams of bubbles. Originally located in the Domestic Departures area of Terminal 1 until 2017, the installation’s sense of lightness and motion emanated a soothing and captivating effect to the viewer.\n\nSpanish artist Jaume Plensa, who you might remember from Chicago’s Crown Fountain in my Part 4 retrospective, did this neon tubing, bi-colour glass, metal plate and stainless steel rod piece in 2003 named As One… Located in the International Baggage Hull of Terminal 1, the names of the five continents are superimposed until they are blended into one word. Spontaneously, the names appear, only to eventually reintegrate themselves As a recipient of numerous national and international awards, his work is highly praised for the elegant use of a wide variety of media. In Plensa’s sculptures, text can be both literal references and poetic clues. A symbol of multiculturalism, the glass below it is coloured in red and letters in white to represent the Canadian flag. Another piece of art at the Pearson Airport that I skipped in 2011 was Skyward by Ingeborg Jürgensen Hiscox (pictured on the right side of the photo I linked) and several more artworks in their terminals can be found through the link here."
