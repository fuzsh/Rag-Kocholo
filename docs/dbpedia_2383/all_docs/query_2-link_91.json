        "text": "A statuette of a female nude based on an original from the Cycladic islands.\n\nThis replica portrays a cross-armed nude woman standing on the tips of her toes. It is a reproduction of an original marble statue from Naxos, one of the ancient Cycladic Islands, and is typical of the artistic style of the islands during the early Bronze Age.\n\nThe Cycladic culture existed from around 3300 BC to 1600 BC on a group of islands called the Cyclades, which are located in the Aegean Sea. Cycladic art mostly consisted of stylised marble figurines and faces, frequently female in form.\n\nReminiscent of contemporary modern art, this sculpture will make a stylish home ornament."
