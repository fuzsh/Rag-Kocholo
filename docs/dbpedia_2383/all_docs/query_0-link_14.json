And we’re terrified of it. Although, I once heard that it’s not that we’re afraid of being alone in the dark. Not exactly. What we are actually afraid of is that we are NOT alone in the dark. That’s an interesting idea to sit with, isn’t it? Momentarily ruling out the monsters, what is it that we fear? Sitting in the gloom, our thoughts tend to crowd in on us. Fears and anxieties, loneliness and despair, regret for our pasts, concern for our future, anger that we’re alone in the dark with nothing better to do but think about any of this in the first place. No wonder we don’t want to be alone with it. So we avoid it. We don’t think about the unpleasantness potentially lurking in the shadows and we stay positive. It’s fine, I’m fine, we’re all fine here! But here’s something else to think about. If we’re eternally living in the light where it’s always bright and happy, where we ignore or evade our distressing, uncomfortable feelings, then we are starved of shadows, of nuance, and risk an existence robbed of the richness of contrast. When we only validate our positive feelings, we vastly restrict our tools for looking at the world. We are neither dealing with reality as it is nor adequately readying ourselves for the random pains and struggles that life has in store for us. We deny our inner darkness at our own peril. Because tragedies and calamities are inevitable and darkness will descend at some point in your life, no matter what sort of mindset you have. Despite what you may have heard, good things don’t only happen to good people, and bad things don’t only happen to bad people, and whatever it is, your positive or negative thoughts did not make it happen. Shit happens. Pain is pain, feelings are feelings. And as\n\nhumans, for our emotional health, it is important that we experience and embody the full spectrum of emotions.\n\n‘Leave the door open for the unknown, the door into the dark. That’s where the most important things come from . . .’ – REBECCA SOLNIT, 'A FIELD GUIDE TO GETTING LOST'\n\nEverywhere eyeballs are aflame, plate 9 from The Temptation of Saint Anthony (1st series), Odilon Redon, 1888, lithograph in black on ivory China paper, laid down on ivory wove paper.\n\nUmschlag der Kunst und Literaturzeitschrift 'Jugend’ (Cover of the art and literary magazine 'Youth'), Ausgabe Nr. 15/1896, Paul Wilhelm KellerReutlingen, 1896, oil on canvas.\n\nWe should think of this human darkness as a spectrum as well, with many elements along its continuum worth exploring. James Thurber wrote that there are two types of light: the glow that illuminates, and the glare that obscures, and I can’t help but think\n\nof the obscuring glare here in terms of the phony light of that ‘good vibes only’ doctrine. Perhaps we can instead confront our darkness straight on and head into it with the illuminating glow of courageous curiosity to guide us through our explorations. And who better to lift the lantern along our pathway than the artists who have engaged with these impulses and have painted canvases awash in unpalatable feelings across the centuries? While the themes and imagery presented in many of these works can be difficult to confront, their beauty and truth lies in laying bare the universality of our struggles and allowing us a bit of distance to sit with something outside ourselves that we also recognize internally. Who hasn’t gazed upon the infernal phantasmagoric chaos in the third panel of Hieronymus Bosch’s The Garden of Earthly Delights triptych and seen their inner pandemonium mirrored right back at them? Surely, it’s not just me! Within the following chapters is a gallery of artworks reflecting these anxieties and aversions, tensions and terrors that transcend time and which have long plagued our psyches – a Stygian kaleidoscope through which tumble our inner demons and our deepest, darkest feelings. Among the push and pull of these seductive and repellent images, we’ll traverse the realm of dreams and nightmares, observe the visual culture of struggle and violence, and examine our ingrained and inherent fear of death and decay. And in indulging our fears for a time, in reconciling with our dark halves, our human experience will become closer to whole. It’s important to note that while many of these works are visually stunning and quite beautiful, they also have themes that are considered disturbing or shocking. It is never my intent to share horror for horror’s sake but consider this a content warning: these works run the gamut of subject matter and motifs that might provoke distress and discomfort. Please be forewarned and treat yourself gently when perusing these pages.\n\nOnce more for the people in the back! Denial of our darkness leads us to fear it. Let’s create a connection with our shadows instead, and revel in all the inspiration and wonder we may find there.\n\nPART ONE\n\n—\n\nIt’s All in Your Mind\n\n‘I used to think I was the strangest person in the world but then I thought there are so many people in the world, there must be someone just like me who feels bizarre and flawed in the same ways I do . . .’ – FRIDA KAHLO\n\n‘A\n\nrt enables us to find ourselves and lose ourselves at the same time,’ wrote modern monk and man of contradictions Thomas Merton, a prolific poet, essayist and artist. It’s no joke that creative people spend a lot of time in their heads. And it’s easy to get lost in there. If you have spent any time with a highly creative person, you have probably experienced moments when it seems like they live in a totally different world from yours, a completely different plane of reality. These dreamers are life’s observers and explorers, asking the big questions, discovering the patterns, connecting all the dots. They focus intensely, feel deeply, their minds and hearts on fire, seemingly on the edge of mania and melancholy, exhilaration and existential despair, all at once. A feverish, fraught, frenetic existence. History is full of long-suffering creative geniuses who have a burning need to express themselves through the medium of their art. The list is so extensive that great art has almost become synonymous with pain. If popular culture is to be believed, in order to be truly creative, one must be touched by mental affliction.\n\nThe Scream, Edvard Munch, 1893, oil, tempera and pastel on cardboard.\n\nVan Gogh painted The Starry Night (1889) while battling anxiety and addiction. Frida Kahlo obsessively painted her physical and emotional pain. Edvard Munch wrote that ‘sickness, madness and death were the black angels that guarded my crib’, and he even came to be diagnosed with neurasthenia, a clinical condition associated with hysteria and hypochondria. Aristotle expressed this phenomenon when he claimed that ‘no great genius has ever existed without a strain of madness’. The theory that achieving greatness requires some degree of suffering on the part of the creator dates at least as far back as the\n\nGreek myth of Philoctetes. In this story a man is exiled on an island as a result of a wound. While there, he invents the bow and arrow from scraps of material he finds in a cave – an invention which becomes an important weapon for the Greeks in their battles. Much like many artists, Philoctetes exists in the margins, and his wound, a symbol of his emotional suffering, is the reason he is rejected from society, but it has also given him a kind of insight and is seen as the facilitator for his invention. We still don’t have the full picture of how the imaginative mind works. Research has suggested that creativity involves the coming together of a multitude of traits, behaviours and social influences in a single person, and neuroscience paints a complicated picture of creativity, which is thought to involve a number of cognitive processes, neural pathways and emotions. Psychologically speaking, creative personality types are difficult to understand, largely because they’re complex, paradoxical and tend to avoid habit or routine. So perhaps the ‘tortured artist’ isn’t just a stereotype – perhaps the brain of an artist is hardwired in a unique way. But the concept of turning one’s pain into art is a tired old chestnut and the ‘tortured artist’, with a scorpion-filled mind that succumbs to its nightmares, is a harmful myth. It suggests that these two states are mutually exclusive – an intensely disturbing notion for anyone who practises a creative craft. Let us then instead gaze upon these beautiful, bold and sometimes baffling works of art with appreciation. Let us celebrate these masters of their craft – tormented by maladies of the body, mind and spirit – and their capability to create great art despite their suffering, not because of it.\n\nMad Kate, Henry Fuseli, 1806–07, oil on canvas.\n\nI\n\n—\n\nDreams & Nightmares ‘When we fall asleep, where do we go?’ – BILLIE EILISH\n\nT\n\nhink back on your last nightmare. Remember the harrowing noctur visions that wrench you awake in the 2 a.m. gloom with a shudder and a sob, the visions of vivid and mordant splendour that render you terror-stricken, make your heart pound and you pray desperately that the scenario you’ve just encountered while slumbering is, in fact, not real. Powerless and sleepless, you lie under the blankets, paralysed, the darkness teeming with awful possibility, your nerves jangled and at the edge of your skin, until the sky lightens with morning, the room’s dim shadows scatter, and you finally see that you are alone. Or, at least, you are alone now. . . . or are you? In the following pages we will explore the imagery of some of the dark, dangerous fantasies and mind-bending scenarios of these dreams and nightmares, as well as the artists who coax forth those phantom filaments from the darker recesses of our disturbed slumbers and conjure them to the canvas in the form of horror- and macabre-fantasy-inspired artwork. Dreams and nightmares are an indispensable part of the artistic imagination and have long proved a lush, fruitful and inexhaustible wellspring for human creativity and expression. Whenever we drift into sleep, we slip into a world saturated in fabulous and frightening fancies of surreal creativity far beyond what our waking minds can conceive of. The shifting ciphers of these midnight riddles, possibly caused by random neural firings alongside emotion and memory, are perhaps the perfect vehicle for those artists looking to uncover the ineffable fears and desires that lie submerged, and to bring to light these elusive truths the waking mind has buried deep. Although early human beings and ancient cultures had varying ideas concerning what dreams are, we can certainly say that they all invested dreams with great significance. The ancient Greeks and Romans believed that dreams were messages from the gods or from the deceased, while Renaissance scholars believed that dreams could be both instructional and amusing – that the same dream had different meanings depending on a person’s dominant humour and the time of\n\nyear. Dreams and nightmares were especially important to artists of the late eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century Romantic movement; one of the most notable examples is seen in the theatrical gothic drama of Henry Fuseli’s painting The Nightmare (1781). On this canvas swoons a woman awash in glowing light. A disagreeable imp-like figure crouches on her chest while a horse with malevolently glowing eyes and flared nostrils lurks in the shadows. When The Nightmare was first displayed at the annual Royal Academy Exhibition in London in 1782, the original visitors found the subject matter awfully shocking, as these late eighteenth-century exhibits were typically the domain of portraits, landscapes or scenes illustrating literature and history. Viewers, however, were also intrigued. The Nightmare did not fit into any of these usual categories. What did it mean? Was the painting meant to be an allegory of some sort, or simply a bizarre fantasy? The art critics were mystified, and the work proved so popular that Fuseli created another three versions, making it the popular painting of the day. Interpretations vary. An icon of horror, it has inspired mystery and speculation for generations. On the topic of analysis, one wonders what Sigmund Freud would have to say about all of this? He was, after all, rumoured to have kept a reproduction of The Nightmare on the wall of his apartment in Vienna. Freud emphasized the importance of dreams in understanding the mind, and his work inspired the work of the Surrealists and later artists. Surrealists were also deeply interested in interpreting dreams as conduits for unspoken feelings and desires, and many artists of the movement would use the motifs they found in their dreams to construct intense and provocative pieces. While Freud thought that dreams expressed forbidden wishes in disguise, Swiss psychologist and psychiatrist Carl Jung saw dreams as expressing things openly, telling us things we already know, albeit through the use of symbols. Seekers have looked to these theories and archetypes – before and beyond – to find meaning and purpose in their dreams, translating these illogical musings into the visual language of\n\nbrushstrokes on canvas. Perhaps this is why so many artists, from the Symbolists to the Surrealists to contemporary creators today, turn to their dreams and nightmares, exploring the warped shadows of that disruptive eeriness and unreality with the hopes of returning to wakefulness with greater truths and creative flashes of genius. It is not surprising then, that born from the throb and thrumming and contradictory electrical chaos of deep sleep brain waves, these nocturnal cerebral meditations have entered the works of artists and creators throughout the ages.\n\nThe Nightmare, Henry Fuseli, 1781, oil on canvas. This famous painting by Swiss–English painter Henry Fuseli (born Johann Heinrich Füssli, 1741–1825) showed dark, irrational forces at play in its dreamlike and haunting erotic evocation of infatuation and obsession. How could this combination of titillating themes not be a massively popular success? After its first showing, at London’s 1782 Royal Academy Exhibition, critics and patrons reacted with horrified fascination and the work became widely popular, to the extent that it was parodied in political satire and an engraved version was widely distributed. In response, Fuseli produced at least three other versions.\n\nBronze head of Hypnos, copy of a Hellenistic original found at Civitella d’Arno (near Perugia, Italy), 1st–2nd century CE, bronze. Hypnos first appears in mythology in the works of one of the earliest Greek poets, Hesiod. In them, Hypnos (Sleep) and Thanatos (Death) were the terrible sons of Nyx (Night). Hypnos’s wings allowed him to move swiftly over land and sea, and to fan the foreheads of the weary until they fell asleep. His son Morpheus served as the dream messenger, and Morpheus’s brother Phobetor was the bringer of nightmares. His name translates from Greek as ‘to be feared’ and befear he does, as he emerges from the land of eternal darkness every night as a winged demon to infest the dreams of the living. Phobetor’s children are the shapes of nightmares themselves, allowing him to extend his reach to all the sleeping people of the world.\n\nVision de Rêve (Dream Vision), Odilon Redon, 1878–82, engraving. Odilon Redon (1840–1916) was one of the most recognized and original of Symbolist artists, and a master of interior worlds. His visionary works occupy the spaces of dreams, fantasy and the imagination. His Noirs Series, monochromatic compositions that comprise the first half of his career, are some of his most famous works, and typify Symbolism in their mysterious subjects and bizarre, dreamlike inventions. Redon’s expressive and suggestive images led French writer Joris Karl Huysmans to christen him as ‘the prince of mysterious dreams’.\n\nThe Sleep of Reason Produces Monsters, No. 43, from Los Caprichos (The Caprices), Francisco Goya, 1796–98, engraving. In this lively scene, a chaotic throng of malefic creatures bedevils the sleeper in The Sleep of Reason Produces Monsters, numbered 43 in a series of 80 aquatint etchings published in 1799 by Francisco Goya (1746–1828). Known as Los Caprichos, this series is generally understood as the artist’s criticism of the society in which he lived. Various creatures, including bats and owls, animals symbolizing evil and mystery in Spanish folklore, swarm around the slumbering artist, and a vigilant lynx standing sentinel at the lower right alerts us to the monstrous forces that we are unable to control when sleep takes us. The epigraph for the work contains a warning, a proclamation of Goya’s adherence to the values of the Enlightenment: ‘Imagination\n\nabandoned by reason produces impossible monsters; united with her, she is the mother of the arts and source of their wonders.’\n\nThe Dream of St Joseph, Georges de La Tour, c. 1640, oil on canvas. Unlike those who have been contacted by burning bushes, earthquakes or the roar of thunder, St Joseph only heard God in the quietest of ways. He dreamed of angels and received God’s missives through these celestial messengers while he slept. In this candlelit scene, French Baroque painter Georges de La Tour (1593–1652) painted St Joseph, the father of Jesus, being visited in a dream by an angel with a message. According to the New Testament he was visited four times with various messages and it is not clear which visit is portrayed in this scene, but whatever game of holy telephone this messenger was playing, Joseph is a man who appears to be missing out on a solid night’s sleep.\n\nThe Garden of Earthly Delights (right panel), Hieronymus Bosch, 1490–1500, oil on oak panels. Do works of art get any more nightmarish than the paintings of Jheronimus van Aken, better known as Hieronymus Bosch (c. 1450– 1516)? I’d wager not. The paintings of this fanatical late-medieval artist, about whom surprisingly little is known, are infamous for their chaotic dreamscapes brimming with strange and surreal details. Though his works may not be depicting literal nightmares, who can say that on occasion their dream terrors do not in some way resemble the grotesqueries that cavort and caper within the carnival atmosphere of this artist’s lurid canvases? In this panel from Bosch’s most complex and enigmatic creation, The Garden of Earthly Delights, we are treated to the wild ecstasy of a hellishly remarkable menagerie\n\nwhere, among other scenes of eyeball-scarring strangeness, maneating bird-monsters placidly devour their wriggling meals and a pink froggy monster blob croaks out a song from a score inscribed on a human backside. A drop of dreamfuel, indeed!\n\nEmperor Go-Daigo, Dreaming of Ghosts at his Palace in Kasagiyama, Ogata Gekkō, 1890, wood block triptych. Ogata Gekkō (1859–1920) was a Japanese artist best known as a painter and a designer of ukiyo-e woodblock prints. He was considered to be one of the important ukiyo-e artists of the Meiji era and was among the earliest Japanese artists to win an international audience. He had developed his own artistic style, influenced by traditional Japanese painting, and his works are typically genre scenes from the everyday lives of people, and reveal interesting insights into daily life in Japan at the turn of the century. In this intimate scene, we get a peek at Emperor Go-Daigo whose efforts to overthrow the shogunate and restore the monarchy led to civil war and divided the imperial family into two rival factions. In this phantasmal image, the ghosts of two small children appear in a dream to advise the emperor. One assumes, from the calm and resolute atmosphere, that this is with regard to military strategy, but one hopes it’s to suggest a peaceful resolution with less innocent bloodshed.\n\nThe Sandman, Stephen Mackey, 2020, oil on panel. British artist Stephen Mackey comments wryly about his cryptic creative persona, ‘No information = mystique . . . You can have any facts you want, but you’re sworn to secrecy.’ Keep your secrets, then, Mr Mackey! Self-taught and inspired by the great French, Dutch and Italian masters of the Renaissance, Mackey’s works portray fantasy settings and the magic of imaginary worlds. They are full of Symbolism, both exciting and ambiguous, and feature gossamer beings in scenarios that feel as ethereal and elusive as a dream. In this scene of velvety textures, one senses that the sleeper may awaken at any moment, and this mysterious figure may never have been there at all.\n\nNight Terrors, David Whitlam, 2017, pencil and digital. Contemporary British artist David Whitlam (b. 1977) showed an interest in and talent for drawing at a young age. While studying graphic art at Leeds Metropolitan University, he developed a curiosity for Surrealism and the workings of the unconscious. Working in a variety of media, often combining traditional drawings and paintings with digital art, his goal is to ‘tap into the desires and anxieties within the subconscious’, allowing his images to evolve into their own identities rather than attempting to capture reality.\n\nMy Dream, My Bad Dream, Fritz Schwimbeck, 1915, pen and ink, wash and gouache on paper. This imagery of a terrifying nocturnal visitation is no doubt a feeling that all cat-owners are familiar with, although fuzzy paws are certainly preferable to the iron grip of the succubus. Fritz Schwimbeck (1889– 1972) was a German artist best known for his atmospheric psychological pen-and-ink illustrations, engrossing narrative prints and graphic drawings. Schwimbeck’s many notable accomplishments include illustrations for art books and editions of works by Arnold Strindberg, William Shakespeare, Edgar Allen Poe and E.T.A. Hoffmann.\n\nThe Somnambulist, John Everett Millais, 1871, oil on canvas. In John Everett Millais’ (1829–96) nerve-wracking painting, The Somnambulist, we observe a barefoot young woman sleepwalking perilously close to the shadowy edge of a cliff. Her candle has been snuffed out by the wind, which renders this nail-biting scene even more tense as she walks ahead in the moonlit darkness, unaware of the danger close at hand. Where is she going? What is she dreaming? Sleepwalking, also known as somnambulism or noctambulism, is a phenomenon of combined sleep and wakefulness and is classified as a sleep disorder belonging to the parasomnia family. Millais, an English painter and illustrator who was one of the founders of the PreRaphaelite Brotherhood, was 41 years old and at the height of his powers at the time he painted this strange, sleepy drama.\n\nII\n\n—\n\nPsychological Distress ‘I put my heart and my soul into my work and lost my mind in the process.’ – VINCENT VAN GOGH\n\nW\n\nhen it comes to articulating our inner emotional landscapes, it’s possible that painter Georgia O’Keeffe, who endured a nervous breakdown in 1933, put it best: ‘I found I could say things with color and shapes that I couldn’t say any other way–things I had no words for.’ For much of human history, creative expression has been a powerful means of communicating our dreams, visions, stories and ideas, and torments of the mind – depression, anxiety, angst, grief and loneliness – are no different. Mental illness has for centuries been linked in the popular imagination with extraordinary creativity and great works of art, and while much in the history and treatment of ‘madness’ has changed over time, one of the most consistent features has been the presence of the visual arts, and our speculation and cultural fascination with madness as a creative force. This celebration of emotion through art is not always of the champagne and roses, ‘good vibes only’ variety. In this chapter, we will visit works depicting psychological distress, desperate inner turmoil, and deeply scarring trauma. But is there a danger in glorifying art created under the pressures of a suffering artist, or should we celebrate these works as salvation? Art challenges our awareness and understanding of mental illness and it casts a light on a part of what it means to be human. According to the NIMH (National Institute of Mental Health) nearly one in five adults lives with a mental illness. Historically, this can be seen in some of our most revered artworks depicting internal trauma, and many renowned artists have struggled with mental health issues, even if they were not diagnosed with such at the time. Early Renaissance artists, such as Vittore Carpaccio, translate mental illness through the lens of religious and spiritual imagery. Later Renaissance artists, such as Albrecht Dürer wirh his intellect, introspection and ruthless perfectionism, may have elicited a state of melancholia – what is now known as depression. Romantic artist Francisco Goya’s work captured the turbulence of his times, but also documented his personal struggles with a tormented mind. Fantastical\n\nvisual artist Leonora Carrington was deemed ‘incurably insane’, sent to an asylum in Spain and subjected to a pharmaceutical that produced effects akin to those of electroshock treatment. Describing the harsh realities of her time in the Spanish asylum and her horrifying treatment there in terms of a forced incarceration, Carrington once remarked that ‘I suddenly became aware that I was both mortal and touchable and that I could be destroyed.’ In 1970, whilst entrapped by dissociative states and debilitating depression, and after over a decade of intermittent hospitalization for mental illness, outsider artist Unica Zürn, known for her anagrammatic poetry as well as her intricate and entrancing visual art, died by suicide by jumping out of the window of the apartment of her long-time companion, Surrealist artist Hans Bellmer. Zürn’s artistic practice was entangled with her bouts of mental illness and she produced much of her art during the time she spent in mental institutions. What is the relationship between psychological state, the artistic impulse and the creative process? What can artworks produced by people struggling with mental illness illuminate for us about ‘artistic genius’? Can art therapy help in the treatment of the mentally ill? Data confirms that the creation of art can aid in calming and relieving stress. Through the studies from which this data comes we have learned that many patients had lower levels of the stress hormone cortisol and increased levels of dopamine, regardless of artistic ability. Even if it doesn’t help that person with their particular mental health issues, art creation is shown to be a great tool to access our innermost thoughts and provides time for introspection. Consumed by their illness, many people living with mental health issues aren’t able to create at all, despite desperately wanting to. And yet, there are some incredible individuals who persevere and create magnificent works of art despite their challenges. Although it is a common occurrence in people’s lives, and despite the many current attempts to destigmatize mental health, discussion of psychological distress and suffering remains a difficult undertaking.\n\nYet for centuries, these disturbed and disturbing aspects of our psyches have served as inspiration to artists who have portrayed these profoundly human experiences with sensitivity, nuance and empathy. The pain experienced by these artists rendered as paint on canvas, carved in clay or seen through a photographic lens can make for fraught and difficult viewing, and we may want to close our eyes, or look away – but these challenging works of art can help us better understand the darkness experienced by our fellow humans and hold a mirror up to our own darkness as well.\n\nBlack Place II, Georgia O’Keeffe, 1944, oil on canvas. Influential Modernist artist and celebrated painter Georgia O’Keeffe, (1887–1986) was best known for the wild beauty and abstractions of her large-format paintings of flowers, plant life and southwestern American landscapes. An ambitious, complex and singular individual, she endured an intense nervous breakdown in the 1930s which led to hospitalization and caused her to set aside her art for more than a year. In the jagged shadows and sky torn asunder of Black Place II, we can imagine the sorrows of the mental health challenges that had swept through her life.\n\nA cat standing on its hind legs, Louis Wain, 1925/1939, gouache. Louis Wain (1860–1939) was an English artist whose wildly fanciful, kaleidoscopic drawings of anthropomorphized large-eyed cats grinning and winking, wining and dining, captured the Edwardian imagination. Later in life, he was confined to mental institutions and was alleged to have suffered from schizophrenia. While never officially diagnosed, many believe that he suffered from this condition and some have argued that his later drawings demonstrate his psychotic deterioration; the expressions of his cats seem to reflect the emotions felt by the artist, ranging from a sort of personified dismay to a fullblown, florid freak-out. Wain’s intense personality, adroit observations and lifelong battle with mental illness coalesced in an iconic body of\n\nwork that reflects the comedies, tragedies and absurdities of society – and continues to generate interest to this day.\n\nSelf-portrait in Front of a Mirror, Léon Spilliaert, 1908, Indian ink wash, brush, watercolour and coloured pencil on paper. Filled with melancholy solitude, the mysterious atmospheric paintings of self-taught Belgian artist of nocturnes Léon Spilliaert (1881–1946) captured the diffused glow of streetlamps, the dampness of pavements, or moonlight over the dark, brooding sea. Due to his health problems, Spilliaert suffered from insomnia, and as a means of distraction from his sleeplessness, existential worries and physical ailments, he strolled through the empty streets and along the deserted promenade of his hometown late at night. Upon returning from these walks, he would create works from memory, in the dead of night, bringing to life the moody stillness of the town in the wee hours. Still living with his parents and continuing to suffer from ill health, these unnerving reflections suggest an unsteady and unsettled young man struggling with both his physical and mental well-being.\n\nTrying to Find You 1, Tracey Emin, 2007, acrylic on canvas. Tracey Emin (b. 1963) is a British artist known for her intimate, confessional and boundary-pushing works that mine autobiographical details through a variety of media including painting, drawing, photography, video, sculpture and neon text. Emotional distress is a long-running theme in Emin’s art; she cites Edvard Munch as an early inspiration for her expressive style of self-representation, a link that lies in a shared commitment to revealing unfiltered mental suffering – in Emin’s case often linked to deeply traumatic experiences of depression and grief.\n\nAnxiety, Edvard Munch, 1894, oil on canvas. Edvard Munch’s youth was scored by tragedy: both his mother and favourite sister died of tuberculosis, another sister was diagnosed with mental illness, and the artist himself was often sick, subject to bouts of fever and bronchitis. ‘I inherited two of mankind’s most frightful enemies,’ Munch later wrote, ‘the heritage of consumption and insanity’. These anxieties suffused Munch’s work throughout his early years, and he repeatedly returned to particular themes, reworking and repainting favourite motifs until old age. Less well known than his more famous iterations of The Scream, Anxiety presents viewers with a despairing sense of abstract horror, an eerie parade of not-quitehuman faces whose expressions exude a feeling of subtle paranoia, discomfort and distrust, a collective desperation more sustained than\n\nthe piercing angst experienced by the isolated individual in The Scream. The lasting influence of these works continues to powerfully resonate with viewers today – who among us can’t relate to these distressing feelings at some point in our lives?\n\nThe Wounded Deer, Frida Kahlo, 1946, oil on Masonite. Feminist icon and one of Mexico’s most well-known artists, Frida Kahlo (1907–54) was no stranger to suffering. She began painting in 1925, while recovering from a near-fatal bus accident that shattered her body and marked the beginning of lifelong physical agonies. Her entire life and her creativity were vastly influenced by chronic, severe illness, and her vivid, powerful body of work reflects this burden of pain, trauma and loss. She created haunting and stunningly original paintings that mingled elements of fantasy and folklore, using vibrant colours in a style that was influenced by indigenous cultures of Mexico as well as by European influences that include Realism, Symbolism and Surrealism. Many of her works are self-portraits that symbolically express her own pain. In these creations, Kahlo portrays herself time and again exploring and questioning herself and identity. Today Frida Kahlo ranks among the world’s most renowned twentieth-century\n\nwoman artists and her deeply and painfully personal paintings continue to fascinate and inspire art lovers around the world.\n\nUntitled, Unica Zürn, 1965, ink and gouache on paper. Unica Zürn (1916–70) grew up surrounded by marvellous and unusual objects collected by her absent father, a cavalry officer whom she adored. Inspired perhaps in part by her father’s gifts from afar and a longing to spend more time with him, Zürn developed a rich fantasy life and a vivid imagination. This is evidenced in her captivating, otherworldly drawings and shadowy mirages of fantastical creatures meticulously constructed out of finely rendered, obsessively repetitive shapes and lines. Also an accomplished author who wrote with cool detachment and even humour from the depths of her mental illness, which some believe to be schizophrenia, though others suggest she may have suffered from bipolar disorder with psychotic features, Zürn produced most of her oeuvre while involved with the German\n\nSurrealist, Hans Bellmer. During her time with him, Zürn began to experiment with ‘automatic’ drawings and anagrams as part of her long-held interest in hidden meanings and coincidences. On 19 October 1970, after a decade of mental crises, Zürn leapt to her death from the balcony of the Paris apartment she had shared with Bellmer.\n\nMaterdolorsa, Aloïse Corbaz, 1922, pencil, ink and coloured pencils on postcard. Aloïse Corbaz (1886–1964), after working as a governess in the entourage of Kaiser Wilhelm II, for whom she developed an intense – and imaginary – attachment, returned to Lausanne at the start of the First World War and soon exhibited signs of mental collapse. She was diagnosed in 1918 as schizophrenic and placed for the remainder of her life in the asylum La Rosière in Gimel, Switzerland. There, she began making art and eventually became known simply as Aloïse. Women of power and romance are the centre of Aloïse Corbaz’s visual universe, and though she drew primarily with crayon and pencil, she would at times infuse works with stains from crushed floral petals and occasionally mix in toothpaste.\n\nThe Maze, William Kurelek, 1953, gouache on board. The art of William Kurelek (1927–77) navigated the harsh realities of Depression-era farm life while exploring the sources of the artist’s debilitating mental suffering, and these nostalgic and apocalyptic works represent an unsettling and controversial record of global anxiety in the twentieth century. By the time of his death, he was one of the most commercially successful artists in Canada, whose paintings remain coveted by collectors many years after Kurelek’s premature death. The Maze is a painting that Kurelek produced while a patient at the Maudsley Hospital in London. Professionals at Maudsley quickly recognized the gravity of Kurelek’s suffering – although the precise nature of his illness remains unknown – and while there receiving treatment, he was also given a room to paint in. The Maze, described by the artist as ‘a painting of the inside of my skull’, can be interpreted as Kurelek’s attempt to justify this privilege; as he wrote, ‘I had to impress the hospital staff as being a worthwhile specimen to keep on’.\n\nWoman Leaving the Psychoanalyst, Remedios Varo, 1960, oil on canvas. The canvases of Catalan Surrealist artist Remedios Varo (1908–63) are boldly enigmatic ciphers, notoriously elusive of solution, despite the abundance of magical keys and clues. Painted towards the end of her life, Woman Leaving the Psychoanalyst plays upon the pseudoscience of psychoanalysis, the initials of its three fathers inscribed on the portal behind the central figure, ‘FJA’ standing for Freud, Jung and Adler. In a dreary medieval courtyard above which heavy clouds linger, a green, cloaked figure drops a ghostly, disembodied head down a well without a trace of hesitation or compunction, and nary a backward glance. Painted towards the end of Varo’s life, this, according to the artist, was ‘the proper thing to do when leaving the psychoanalyst’.\n\nIII\n\n—\n\nWhispers from the Void ‘I feel stupid and contagious. Here we are now, entertain us.’ – NIRVANA, ‘SMELLS LIKE TEEN SPIRIT’\n\nW\n\nhat’s the point? In today’s modern world, with its excesses of information and images of violence, trauma and injustices, you may catch yourself discontented and despairing. Things feel meaningless and shallow, you’re alienated from nature, from others, and your own, authentic self. Nothing seems . . . worth it. These pervasive feelings of existential angst creep into your consciousness and create a gloomy, cynical inner monologue dripping in disdain for the human condition and leave you questioning the meaning of life. Humans have long pondered on the nature of existence, and what it means to be a thinking, feeling, acting individual being in the face of a world that can often seem senseless and devoid of meaning. In these moments of schism and psychic numbing, understanding stalls, language fails and powerful, formless, unsettling questions arise. It’s the disquietude and distress of experiencing this emptiness that manifests as existential anxiety – an ever-present, anxious dread that is always lurking, even beneath our happiness. In the void of this uncertainty, how do we find our purpose, how can we make our own meaning? Creativity, as you might have guessed, is essential in this pursuit. Creativity is a persistent theme in Existentialist thought and may be required, as German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche suggests, to become who we are, and who we may want to be. Artists are well acquainted with this demand for meaning and desire to express identity, and their work and practice is often a response to this human hunger for understanding. Using the creative process as an act of self-assertion, and an expression of freedom and authenticity, artists have for centuries generated works expressing this poignant anxiety about the fate of humanity. In the visual arts, Existentialism refers to the mood, thought and impulses perceived in the works rather than a distinctive and consistent style, but the analogues of Existentialism can be found in Surrealism and Expressionism. Existentialism provided abstract painters with a\n\nterminology that enabled them to assert the importance of their very personal expressions. Existentialism was a powerful influence on post-war art in Europe, as artists, writers and thinkers struggled to reconcile with not only the physical devastation wrought by war, but with the trauma of its psychological repercussions as well. This philosophical response was popularized amid these horrors by Jean-Paul Sartre whose treatise Being and Nothingness described the anxiety and meaningless of existence and the pursuit of authenticity in life, and found its themes of alienation and individual autonomy explored by artists such as Francis Bacon, Alberto Giacometti and Jean Dubuffet. Existentialism naturally influenced numerous midcentury artists’ understanding of existence as an isolated solitary phenomenon in an absurd world and yet still afforded one the freedom for one to define oneself. Simone de Beauvoir said in 1965 that for these artists Existentialism seemed to ‘authorize them to accept their transitory condition without renouncing a certain absolute, to face horror and absurdity while still retaining their human dignity’.\n\nStudy After Velázquez's Portrait of Pope Innocent X, Francis Bacon, 1953, oil on canvas. Many art historians and theorists consider Francis Bacon (1909–92) the quintessential Existentialist artist, and in viewing his 1953 Study, we can get a glimpse as to why. In this bizarre, garish scene, we see the tortured expression of a blood-spattered pope imprisoned upon a rather uncomfortable-looking throne. Though the paint strokes obfuscate the screams of the figure, we can certainly imagine them. Known for his theatricality, violence and claustrophobic environments, Bacon seems the most unforgiving and anguished of the Existential artists. He identified as a Nietzschean and atheist, and some contemporary critics saw the series as symbolic execution scenes, as if\n\nBacon sought to enact Nietzsche’s declaration that ‘God is dead’ by killing his mouthpiece on Earth.\n\nEdvard Munch painted the delirium and the dread of existence, the feverish chaos of sickness, and the fearful way in which we may sense death although we properly cannot imagine it for ourselves. The wild and aggressive painting of the Paris-based German artist Wols is characteristic of the European abstract movement Art Informel and was claimed by Jean-Paul Sartre for Existentialism, writing that his work was a visualization of our ‘universal horror of being-in-theworld’, our fascination with the ‘otherness’ of worldly phenomena. While Existentialists express diverging views about many topics, most can agree it is a philosophy that invites individuals to live life with creativity, and that Existentialist thinking encourages living life as a work of art. In the context of the twenty-first century, the legacies of these boundary-challenging artists continue to resonate with contemporary creators striving to make art that challenges our beliefs and our sense of reality and creates spaces for incongruencies to coexist – such as Karen Cronje, a South African artist who explores the intersection of human interaction and the environment and how our individual associations influence how we experience the same place. ‘Embrace the pandemonium,’ offers the ever-pragmatic Eleanor Shellstrop in the television series The Good Place , a piece of Existentialist theatre if ever there was one, and which through its narrative explores these philosophical themes of absurdity, alienation, the lack of meaning and purpose in life. And in embracing our creativity, we, hopeless, helpless humans with our disunited existences in this absurd universe, imbue our search for meaning with meaning, and we manage to live on in this weird, beautiful and dreadful world. To come full circle and paraphrase Friedrich Nietzsche, we have art in order not to die of life.\n\nWalking Man I, Alberto Giacometti, 1960, bronze sculpture. Alberto Giacometti (1901–66) created fragile figures lost and exposed in wide open spaces, and is best known for his elongated, withered representations of the human form, including his 1960 sculpture Walking Man I, which in 2010 broke the record for a work of art sold at auction when it fetched 104.3 million US dollars. Giacometti’s severe figures explored the psyche and the charged space occupied by a single person. Linked to Jean-Paul Sartre and Existentialism, they are seen as metaphors for the post-war experience of doubt and alienation.\n\nBieg Chlosta, Aleksandra Waliszewska, 2010, gouache on paper. Polish painter Aleksandra Waliszewska (b. 1976) creates some of your most brutal nightmares: morbid compositions exploring oppressive themes and dark, tortuous subject matter. Unfortunate events abound, and a trail of carnage, both physical and psychological, streaks gore-soaked and deep through Waliszewska’s works. Whether random or ritualistic, the violence runs rampant, with characters who are either coming to brutal ends or are depicted engaging in the brutality themselves. Sometimes it is unclear as to who is the victim and who is the villain, and yet we can’t look away. Waliszewska is flaying the face of the mundane and peeling back the layers to give us a peek at what lies beneath – attraction and repulsion.\n\nThe Anxious Journey, Giorgio de Chirico, 1913, oil on canvas. The works of artist and writer Giorgio de Chirico (1888–1978) embody the contemplations of an artist profoundly concerned with dreams and questions of being, and include elements of Surrealism, Italian Futurism and mid-twentieth-century existential emptiness. In 2020, our world became the vague, eerie disorientation of a Chirico painting – empty streets and spaces where life in the foreground seemed to have stalled and the trappings of modern existence continued uninterrupted in the background. This sense of our lives in limbo while the world continued on without us was, to many of us, the ‘new normal’.\n\nHistories of She, Darla Teagarden, 2017, digital. Profoundly resonant for those among us who view the world through a splinter of enchantment, Darla Teagarden’s surreal photographic narratives walk a tremulous line between fable and reality. These feverish visions are deeply imbued with fragile secrets, intense emotion, and an eerie sense of urgency – an otherworldly plucking at the senses. Teagarden builds these vividly expressive vignettes from wood, paper, and plaster for images that also include handpicked vintage props, clothing and hand-drawn backgrounds. It is this tender, liminal space, rebuilt and reimagined many times over, in which most of her darkly cinematic images are created.\n\nSkull of a Skeleton with Burning Cigarette, Vincent van Gogh, 1885–86, oil on canvas. This painting, rendered in sombre tones by Vincent van Gogh (1853– 90), of a grinning skull with a lit cigarette clenched between its teeth, is a bit of a juvenile joke. The work is purported to have been a humorous analogy to artistry of the human form during the artist’s studies and a satirical comment on conservative academic practices. Like Kierkegaard, Van Gogh believed that it was absurd for others to teach artistry to the artist and that one must develop art through one’s own creativity and emotion. Quoted as denouncing his studies in Antwerp as boring and non-educational, Van Gogh grappled with existential questions during his twenties while working aimlessly as a picture dealer, schoolteacher, bookshop clerk and missionary. In the early 1880s, he committed himself to a life of art.\n\nExistential Emptiness No. 18, Cui Xiuwen, 2009, C-Print. The series Existential Emptiness by Cui Xiuwen (b. 1970) is a reflection of the woman as individual in modern China. This body of work from one China’s foremost female photographers shifts her focus from physical to spiritual in an exploration of the woman’s psyche. Mostly monochromatic digital photographs, with a palette and format inspired by traditional Chinese ink painting, the scenes take place in the still landscape of the ice- and snow-covered mountains of Northern China – an ideal setting for exploring the mind and questions of beingness. The physical appearance of the doll – obvious joints, revealed ribcage bones and scarred womb – alludes to the violence of a woman’s experiences and how they impress upon her spirit.\n\nExistential Crisis, Karen Cronje, 2016, oil on primed paper. Karen Cronje (b. 1975) is a South African painter who lives and works in Cape Town. Cronje’s work explores a range of ideas centring around the notion of a dystopian view of the contemporary world, and reflects ideas around landscape, memory and the intersection of human interaction and the environment. She explores her interest in the ‘stuff’ of landscape – patterns, textures – and how our individual memories, associations and viewpoint influence how we experience the same place.\n\nSelf-Portrait, Stanisław Ignacy Witkiewicz, c. 1912, photograph. Stanisław Ignacy Witkiewicz (1885–1939) or ‘Witkacy’, as he became known, is remembered in his homeland of Poland as an accomplished artist, aesthetician, novelist, pioneering dramatist and philosopher; his photographs are only one aspect of his art. An intense and troubled man who believed that Western culture was decadent, degenerate and undermined by the collapse of ethical and philosophical certainties, he used photography, perhaps more than other art forms, as a way to explore his existential anxiety. In Witkiewicz’s haunting self-portrait, the artist’s stoic face emerges from the depths of formless darkness, yet remains trapped behind a cracked pane of shattered glass.\n\nThe Pit, Aron Wiesenfeld, 2019, oil on panel. The moody spaces of the contemporary works by American artist Aron Wiesenfeld (b. 1972) thrum quietly with moments of melancholy and a deep sense of loneliness. His scenes are of dim-lit liminality: sparse, shadowy landscapes outside of borders where the wilderness and urban converge and paths or portals often appear. We don’t know whether the characters in them will take that road or make the leap beyond; they exist perpetually at the threshold of their own personal fable in the solitude of self-reflection as they s tare off into an enigmatic abyss.\n\nPART TWO\n\n—\n\nThe Human Condition\n\n‘What would your good do if evil didn’t exist, and what would the earth look like if all the shadows disappeared?’ – MIKHAIL BULGAKOV\n\nHuman Frailty, Salvator Rosa, c.1656, oil on canvas.\n\nH\n\numans are fallible and tremendously flawed – from the literal flesh of our hearts, decaying slowly over the course of our lifetimes, to the metaphorical battles of good and evil waged within those hearts. Anger, jealousy, vengeance. Sickness and disease. Violence and conflict. Grief, loss and, perhaps most powerful of all, death. Delving into these depths of the darker side of the human condition is an often painful and inevitably messy undertaking, and in peeking at humanity’s fragile underbelly, we’re unfortunately not going to like what we’ll see. But if we want to understand and fully appreciate who we are and the world around us, we must confront and come to terms with all aspects of our wildly beautiful and terrible human hearts. Just as all of life’s excitement and joy is found in art, so too can we glimpse all of life’s potential darkness. Within the sordid treasure chest of art history’s greatest masterpieces, we can unearth all the horror and sadness pertaining to existence and life’s most difficult – and darkest – questions. Why is there so much suffering in the world? Why are we such a violent and destructive species? Is it natural – rational even – to fear death? How do we live in this troubled world and make meaningful lives in the face of darkness, doom and despair? We can look to the canvas to see each and every one of these questions writ large. And if our internal battles with morality and philosophy weren’t enough to contend with, there’s the reality of our physical bodies breaking down, bit by bit, day by day. Artworks inspired by or reflecting upon sickness and disease can provide both a refuge from the intense emotions associated with illness, as well as insight into our understanding of the human body and related themes of health, care and connection. Perhaps in witnessing these visions of corporeal distress we can begin to access new pathways of compassion and empathy, and in transformative or emancipatory ways, we can challenge and redefine what society expects from our bodies.\n\nAh, but those wily, yet utterly predictable human bodies. No matter how well we take care of them, they’ve all got an expiry date. Artists have forever found terror, beauty and awe in the concept of death, and painting scenes depicting or reflecting upon the dead and dying, or scenes of grief and loss, is a powerful way for them to examine and reckon with their mortality. And gazing upon this art is one way for us to acknowledge our own mortality as well. It’s no surprise that something so imminent, and yet so profoundly unknown, has been represented in such a variety of creative ways throughout history – and continues to unnerve and intrigue us today. We’re good people, right? We do the right thing, don’t we? We probably don’t consider ourselves evil, and in a similar vein, it’s likely that, just as we believed when we were children, many of us are still quite confident that we’re going to live forever. But the truth is we’re all capable of hurtful behaviour and destructive acts, every one of our bodies is destined to fail us at some point – and there’s no other way to say it friends – we’re born to die. So what do we do? Stay open and receptive. Though the following works of art reflect the less popular, more unpleasant and problematic aspects of the human experience, let them into that human heart of yours, if for nothing else, the potent emotional response it will evoke. File it away, let your subconscious deconstruct and decode it over time. Just look. That’s it. We can’t turn away from the ugliness, violence, suffering and death. It’s all part of who we are – and we’re all human, aren’t we?\n\nVanitas, Matthias Withoos, c. seventeenth-century, oil on canvas.\n\nIV\n\n—\n\nAilments & Afflictions ‘Art is a wound turned into light.’ – GEORGES BRAQUE\n\nW\n\nhat does it mean to be human? To inhabit a mortal body with all of corporeal limitations, susceptible to what at times feels like our flesh betraying or failing us? To suffer pain, to face illness, to fight and sometimes succumb, to disease? As living, feeling beings, these ailments and afflictions affect us both psychologically and emotionally, and so it is only natural that the torments of illness and suffering have been the subject of artists for centuries. Vincent van Gogh, who feverishly painted hundreds of masterpieces alive with rich colours and exhilarating brushstrokes, suffered from seizures which doctors believed to be caused by temporal lobe epilepsy. Frida Kahlo lived with chronic pain caused by a severe bus accident in her youth, and navigated this agony through her lush, expressive selfportraiture. Illness and physical debilitation have been the subject of countless works of art throughout history. Sometimes artists actually portray particular illnesses and at other times they are influenced or inspired by their respective conditions. How have artists given the concept of disease, and the more personal experience of illness, concrete form through art? In gazing at representations of the sick or those with disabilities do we become more empathetic to the pain of others? How can these works speak to inequities in accessing care, and alternatively, how can they give a voice to the sick? And what happens when artists take something scientifically objective and turn it into a work that could be viewed subjectively or be used as propaganda? Some of the most terrifying and prolific images of illness were created by artists in the Middle Ages and Renaissance. In Pieter Bruegel the Elder's The Triumph of Death (c. 1562), we witness an army of scythe-wielding skeletons sweeping through a coastal farming village, wreaking havoc on the peasants and illustrating the breadth of suffering caused by the plague. From the Renaissance onwards, we start to see artists reliably depicting signs of disease or illness, as characteristics of their sitters, creating records of the different pathologies of the body and aiding in the development of studies in anatomy. Some of these representations of illness and the unwell body stand at the intersection of\n\nart and medicine. Renowned for the naturalism of his works, Giovanni Battista Moroni carefully depicts a prominent goitre in his 1557 portrait of Abbess Lucrezia Agliardi Vertova. Researchers uncovered two of the earliest known depictions of breast cancer in paintings dating back to the 1500s: The Night, painted by Michele di Ridolfo del Ghirlandaio, and The Allegory of Fortitude, depicted by Maso da San Friano.\n\nA Surgical Operation, Jan Josef Horemans, 1720–29, oil on canvas. The works of Jan Josef Horemans (1682–1759) frequently depict vivid moments in private houses, inns and courtyards – in this instance a surgeon’s house where a patient has come for treatment. While the surgeon heads up the case, his apprentice has begun the manual treatment of an aggrieved-looking patient with an incision just below the armpit. Could they be lancing the bubo (the infected, enlarged lymph nodes) of bubonic plague? Nearby awaits a fretful woman, who may be either a distressed relative of the injured man or the next patient agonizing over her own condition, now that she’s observed the sort of medical care she is about to receive.\n\nIn the nineteenth century we find more sympathetic and touching depictions intended to affect our emotions and raise awareness. Artists like Edvard Munch had personal connections to people who had tuberculosis and created very emotional pieces reflecting these\n\nrelationships. With a series of paintings, lithographs and etchings, Edvard Munch depicted his older sister Sophie on her deathbed, suffering from the late stages of tuberculosis. In Alice Neel’s 1940 painting TB Harlem, she paints a man named Carlos Negrón, who is suffering from advanced tuberculosis, and who had been ‘treated’ with the procedures of the time. These works depict personal connections, creating emotional pieces reflecting relationships. Later in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries HIV/AIDS awareness campaigns were and continue to be vital in educating people about the disease, preventing the disease and fighting against stigma. Artists and activists such as Keith Haring, Jean-Michel Basquiat and others delivered socio-political messages through their artworks as well as profound expressions of longing and loss. Illness, pain and suffering can be isolating feelings to live with, and from the outside, we can struggle to make sense of that suffering when it is happening to someone else. Art can be a refuge from those intense emotions associated with illness as well as an insightful method with which to explore understandings of illness. ‘To make the private into something public is an action that has terrific ramifications,’ wrote artist David Wojnarowicz, who was thirty-seven when he died from AIDSrelated complications. And is there anything that feels more intensely private than our aches, our agonies, our afflictions? Taken as a whole, the representation of disease in art shows how people have sought explanation through religion, through study and treatments, through personal experiences and raising awareness. Providing an environment for people to think about the embodied human experience is one of the extraordinary roles that this often gloomy art plays throughout the course of history as we continue exploring how artists engage with pain, medicine, biological science and disease.\n\nCholera in Paris, François-Nicolas Chifflart, 1865, etching with drypoint on laid paper. The free-spirited, independent-thinking French painter, engraver and illustrator François-Nicolas Chifflart (1825–1901) was an artist who in the initial years of his vocation was torn between his rigorous academic training and a desire to embrace more romantic subject matter. Encouraged by poet and novelist Victor Hugo, Chifflart launched his new career as an illustrator with works for Hugo's Toilers of the Sea (1866), and a new edition of The Hunchback of Notre Dame. In this horrific romance of this allegorical scene, Chifflart presents a dramatic contrast between the placid city of Paris and the whirling, spectral cloud of death which hovers over it during a cholera epidemic in 1865.\n\nA sickly young woman sits covered up on a balcony; death (a ghostly skeleton clutching a scythe and an hourglass) is standing next to her; representing tuberculosis, Richard Tenant Cooper, c. 1912, watercolour. The works of Paris-trained artist Richard Tenant Cooper (1885–1957) are as beautiful as they are dramatic and disturbing and owe much to the Decadent movement, both aesthetically with its excess and delight in perversion (we might call it ‘a bit extra’ today) and thematically with their depiction of fear of disease, in particular sexually transmitted disease and the trend of depicting women as temptresses encouraging sins of uncleanliness and sexual indulgence. An official war artist, Cooper created symbolic paintings depicting death and disease – tuberculosis, syphilis, breast cancer and diphtheria to name a few – after returning from the First World War before moving to commercial work.\n\nSkiagram, Barbara Hepworth, 1949, pencil and oil on gessoprepared board. Primarily a sculptor, Barbara Hepworth (1903–75) called her drawings ‘surrogate sculptures’. Some of her most prominent and stimulating drawings were depictions of surgery created during a pivotal time for her career. Hepworth came to the subject matter when one of her children was diagnosed with osteomyelitis and she was invited, by the orthopaedic surgeon, to sketch his operations. For two years, Hepworth watched various surgeries, describing in letters, how some days she would spend up to ten hours observing in the operating theatre – resulting in a series of almost a hundred hospital drawings. Thanks to this experience, the artist revealed that she believed there to be ‘a close affinity between the work and approach both of physicians and surgeons, and painters and sculptors’, both of whom seek ‘to restore and to maintain the beauty and grace of the human mind and body’.\n\nSickness, Rodney Dickson, 1988, oil on canvas. Rodney Dickson (b. 1956) grew up in Northern Ireland during the troubled years of civil disorder that engulfed that country. Having drawn and painted since childhood, he reacted to his early experience by considering the futility and hypocrisy of war through art. The artist is best known for his large, thickly executed oil paintings, which have a physical presence so visceral that they confuse, question and blur the line between what is abstract and what is real. Some of these paintings appear as though they were executed very quickly, but most were painted, scraped over and painted again. In Sickness, we see a grim, dimly lit narrow room, almost subterranean in nature, that perfectly captures the misery of being alone and unwell.\n\nOpisthotonus in a patient suffering from tetanus, Sir Charles Bell, 1809, oil on canvas. Sir Charles Bell (1774–1842) was a Scottish surgeon and anatomist (also a physiologist, neurologist, artist and philosophical theologian – he had quite the career), who also possessed, according to one friend ‘. . . a little too much ambition . . . and . . . a small degree of misanthropy, particularly towards persons of your own profession’. In other words, apparently the good doctor’s behaviour and character sometimes got in the way of his career. Bell published a series of anatomical works based on his own drawings; in Opisthotonus in a patient suffering from tetanus, we observe a state of severe hyperextension in which an individual’s head, neck and spinal column enter into a ‘bridging’ or ‘arching’ position. This extreme arched pose is an extrapyramidal effect and is caused by spasm of the axial muscles along the spinal column.\n\nHead I, 2000, William Utermohlen, 2000, pencil on paper. UK-based artist William Utermohlen (1933–2007) was diagnosed as suffering from Alzheimer’s disease in 1995 and died in 2007. His last works, the Late Pictures 1990–2000, documenting the gradual decay of his mind, serve as a rare glimpse of the inner life of a patient suffering from Alzheimer’s disease. With a technique increasingly affected by the symptoms of dementia as they unfold, the images show the gradual modification of his perception of the world, both of his external environment and of his psychic universe. Through them we share his terrible feeling of dereliction, progressive isolation and loss of selfcontrol.\n\nToshima Tomiyo Who Stayed with Her Leper Husband, Tomozō, Tsukioka Yoshitoshi, 1875, woodblock print. Tsukioka Yoshitoshi (1839–92) is widely recognized as the last great master of the ukiyo-e genre of woodblock printing and painting. He is also regarded as one of the form’s greatest innovators. His career spanned two eras – the last years of the Edo period in Japan, and the first years of modern Japan following the Meiji Restoration. Although the artist was interested in new things from the rest of the world, over time he became increasingly concerned with the loss of many aspects of traditional Japanese culture, among them traditional woodblock printing. Created for Yoshitoshi’s Postal News series, Toshima Tomiyo Who Stayed with Her Leper Husband, Tomozō illustrates an ‘honourable' wife compassionately tending to her leprosy-stricken husband. There was considerable stigma and shame attached to leprosy in Japanese culture,\n\nwhere, according to Buddhist lore, the disease was believed to result from wrongdoings committed in past lives.\n\nThe Night, Michele di Rodolfo del Ghirlandaio (Michele Tosini), 1555–65, oil on canvas. Recent studies show that cancer is not a modern disease as once thought. Signs of the disease were found in the oil panel transposition of Michelangelo’s statue The Night, painted by Michele di Rodolfo del Ghirlandaio (1503–77, also known as Michele Tosini), in the sixteenth century. A nude woman reclines uncomfortably, ideal in neither pose nor body, at least by classical Greek standards. We blame the beauty industry for unreasonable standards, but it sure goes back much further than that! Her breasts are unsymmetrical, the left appearing smaller than the right and showing signs of nipple retraction. According to the authors of these studies, this is suggestive that she had the disease. The nightmarish ambience of the painting suggests an encroaching darkness and the model’s countenance seems to agree.\n\nThe Funeral, George Grosz, c. 1917–18, oil on canvas. German Expressionist artist George Grosz (1893–1959) became famous for his satirical drawings and paintings of Berlin in the 1920s. The Funeral melds together aspects of both Futurism and Cubism in order to illustrate an urban city funeral procession as a hellish landscape populated by obscure and grotesque attendants, and displays the bleakness, cynicism and disquiet that pervaded the times. The recurrent theme of disease and an ever-mounting death toll finds expression in this apocalyptic and deeply pessimistic painting.\n\nHuman Laundry, Belsen April 1945, Doris Zinkeisen, 1945, oil on canvas. Doris Zinkeisen (1898–1991) was a painter, commercial artist and theatre designer. Her artistic career started out in a much more fashionable and ‘posh’ place than where it would eventually take her. Well known for her society and equestrian portraiture, and for scenes reflecting the lifestyle of the upper class at the time, she was commissioned by the British Red Cross and St John Joint War Organisation to record their work in northwest Europe and was one of the few women war artists to be sent overseas. Her work as a war artist included three days at the BergenBelsen concentration camp in April 1945, immediately after its liberation. One of a group of works produced by Zinkeisen during this time, this one shows the ‘human laundry’ which consisted of about twenty beds in a stable where German nurses and captured soldiers cut the hair of the inmates, bathed them and applied anti-louse powder before they were transferred to an improvised hospital run by the Red Cross.\n\nUntitled (Face in Dirt), David Wojnarowicz, 1990, gelatin silver print. David Wojnarowicz (1954–92) created a body of work that spanned photography, painting, music, film, sculpture, writing and activism. Wojnarowicz saw the outsider as his true subject. Queer and later diagnosed as HIV-positive, he became an impassioned advocate for people with AIDS when an ever-increasing number of friends, lovers and strangers were dying due to what he perceived as government inaction. This photograph was taken in late May 1991 at Chaco Canyon in New Mexico while Wojnarowicz and his friend Marion Scemama took a road trip around the American Southwest. Cynthia Carr, Wojnarowicz’s biographer, describes how the photograph came to be: ‘He had been there before and knew exactly where he wanted to stage this. \"We’re going to dig a hole,\" he told her, \"and I’m going to lie down.\"’\n\nPortrait of Antonietta Gonzalez, Lavinia Fontana, 1583, oil on canvas. Lavinia Fontana (1552–1614) was a Bolognese Mannerist painter best known for her successful portraiture, but who also worked in the genres of mythology and religious painting. She is regarded as the first woman career artist in Western Europe as she relied on commissions for her income, and is also thought to be the first woman artist to paint female nudes – but this is a hotly contested topic among art historians. Antonietta Gonzalez, as well as her father, two sisters and other family members, had hypertrichosis, a rare genetic condition characterized by excessive hair growth on a person’s body. It is suggested that Lavinia Fontana met young Antonietta and her family in Parma, and in this tender portrait Antonietta seems to be less than ten years old. She’s dressed in a court dress and showing a handwritten note where she explains a little of her personal history.\n\nCancer of the Uterus, Wangechi Mutu, 2006, glitter, fur, collage on digital print. Contemporary Kenyan artist Wangechi Mutu (b. 1972) trained as both a sculptor and anthropologist and is noted for work encompassing gender, race, art history and personal identity. Creating complex collages that appear both ancient and from a science fiction future, Mutu’s work features recurring mysterious motifs such as masked women and snakelike tendrils. Her pastiche-like practice combines a variety of source material and textures to explore consumerism and excess. In Cancer of the Uterus, her subject is both glamorous and ominous, a goddess born from a medical pathology diagram, facial features cut from a magazine, fur and a heavy application of black glitter to create an eerily distorted face – the dazzling material alludes to the illegal diamond trade in Africa.\n\nErasure, Susan Gofstein, 2003, oil and collage on MRI scan. In Susan Gofstein’s Resonance series, she illustrates the sentiment that, while pain is universal, it is also a solitary truth that is frustratingly subjective and resistant to language. To live in pain is to live in isolation. About the work, she notes, ‘In the fall of 2000, I developed severe chronic facial pain. This domination of pain obliterated all sense of an inner self. “Resonance” began as an effort to structure and distance myself from an overwhelming existence.’ In the works in the series, the MRI grids of the brain document both the origin of pain and the concept of a self, their altered surfaces – painted over, scratched, collaged – is wrought with struggle.\n\nThe Family, Egon Schiele, 1918, oil on canvas. During his tragically brief career, Egon Schiele (1890–1918) defined a distinct place for himself in twentieth-century art with his beguiling, Expressionistic figurative portraiture. In 1918, Egon Schiele began working on a painting that was to become his last painting: The Family (initially titled ‘Squatting Couple’). This was meant to be a portrait of himself, his wife and their future child. Perhaps the sombre tone and quiet sadness permeating the canvas reflects a presentiment of doom: before he could finish the piece, his pregnant wife died of the Spanish Flu. Tragically, the child did not survive, and Schiele himself died of the same disease only a mere three days later.\n\nV\n\n—\n\nDepravity & Destruction ‘I represent to you all the sins you never had the courage to commit.’ – OSCAR WILDE, THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY\n\nT\n\nhis is a chapter about bad behaviour depicted in the visual arts. The misconduct shown runs the gamut from, say, a mild bout of petty professional jealousy through biblical sins to the atrocities of war – and as there is seemingly no end to the human capacity for depravity, destruction and devastation, there is sadly no shortage of art reflecting that back to us. Filippo Tommaso Emilio Marinetti, Italian poet, editor, art theorist and founder of the Futurist movement, as well as the Fascist Manifesto, declared that ‘Art, in fact, can be nothing but violence, cruelty, and injustice.’ This is an edict which also glorified war and encouraged us to burn down all of our museums and libraries. No, thank you! Of course, violence and cruelty is not all that art is or should be . . . but there is a lot of it to be found in the art we consume. Rather than decry the perpetually bloodthirsty state of the world and vilify the artists who might be inspired by violence, vengeance and general human deviance, let us instead examine these works more closely – along with the world as it was when they were created, the motivations of the artists who coaxed them to bloody life, and focus on what can be learned from these creations. Lust, gluttony, greed, sloth, wrath, envy and pride is quite the rollcall to separate the saints from the sinners. Sin is a concept as universal as it is personal, with a laser-focus on human frailty. Most people will do something they regret at some point, but the gravity of their ‘sin’ and the way it is dealt with very much depends on country, time and sociocultural context. This ethical struggle between vice and virtue has always been fertile territory for the artistic imagination. Religious teachings were often used as a way to depict the tragic consequences of succumbing to the sin of wrath and anger. Peter Paul Rubens’s emotionally charged canvases often referenced these aspects of Christian history, such as Cain Slaying Abel (1608). Greed for money and excessive love of food and drink seem to have been particularly attractive to artists. Both feature regularly in depictions of the sins by Hieronymus Bosch and others. For a time, artists were rather preoccupied with portraying human fallibility in their work, but as society became more secular, these allegorical representations became less fashionable.\n\n‘It is harder to imagine heaven than hell,’ writes Darren Oldridge in The Devil: A Very Short Introduction. It is little wonder, then, that the imagery of hell has inspired countless artists. Drawn from ancient myth, scripture and literature, the concept of hell and the corrupt souls occupying that infernal space has evolved and endured as a powerful metaphor in the Western collective cultural imagination, even as belief in hell as a physical place has declined. Corruption exists the world over: in politics, in law, in business, in the environment, and even in education. Displayed through art, and protest art in particular, it presents an interesting form of communication. Sometimes it is easier to see what is wrong in the world – in that artwork makes the viewer question the society they live in – rather than read about it or have it reported to us. Morality and art are sometimes connected in ways that transcend the canvas. Art that provokes and disturbs and that stirs up beliefs, values and morals, may cause controversies over artistic freedom or how society evaluates art. The artist’s purpose is to express, regardless of how the subject matter may be interpreted. Does this freedom in interpretation mean that neither the artist nor society is responsible for their actions? This author, for one, feels very different things when gazing between Goya’s canvas depicting googly-eyed Saturn gulping down his son and Sirani's portrayal of Timoclea Killing Her Rapist. And what of us? The viewer? Without a doubt, there is a voyeuristic impulse towards gazing upon these horrors, and artists throughout history have exploited our gruesome interest in misdeeds. We, the observers, have a part to play in this push- and-pull creation and consumption. Could it be that artists are merely fulfilling a demand? The underpinnings of human cruelty and wickedness hinge on motivations that the greatest works of art – whether created in response to combat, mass killings and sexual assault, or quieter offences – can aid our understanding in ways that logic and reason, ideology and analysis cannot. It can be a boon and a balm to seek meaning and clarity in art when the burden of that which is unfathomable and unspeakable becomes too great to find it anywhere else.\n\nLucretia, or the Nude Murderess, Otto Müller, c. 1903, oil on canvas. Otto Müller (1874–1930) was a German painter and printmaker of the Die Brücke expressionist movement. Known for his landscape painting, populated by the elongated figures of female nudes, Müller is typically noted as one of the most lyrical of German expressionist painters, and his work is thought to be less anguished and more balanced than other Die Brücke painters. The life-sized nude dominating this portrait is most likely his wife at the time, Maschka. She looks pretty anguished to me; I’m not sure I agree with those guys.\n\nProfessional Jealousy, Joanne Pemberton-Longman, 1947, oil on canvas. Joanne Pemberton-Longman (1918–73) studied at the Byam Shaw School of Art and went on to exhibit widely with various academies, institutes and societies of the day, winning a silver medal at the Salon Paris in 1961. In this curious scene, a mannequin gazes at her reflection in a mirror with a live nude seated in the background; from the painting’s title, I wonder who is jealous of whom. The plaster model longing for life? The warmblooded model yearning for the perfect posture, untiring limbs and flawless visage of the dummy? Or perhaps it is the one we don’t see at all, creating the picture that unfolds on the canvas in a series of muted brushstrokes, admiring the two beauties in front of her, painting with glum envy that which she does not see mirrored in herself?\n\nThe Murder, Paul Cézanne, 1868, oil on canvas. Before Paul Cézanne (1839–1906) painted the hazy brilliance of his PostImpressionist landscapes and peaceful fruit bowls using a refined palette, his works were imbued with the dark drama of the classical masters. In this nightmarish scene of The Murder, one of his earlier paintings, we witness with horror as the murderer lifts his hand to give the final strike while his collaborator is using all the force in her body to keep the victim down. While the expressions on the assailants, faces remain hidden from us, the victim’s face is distorted in extreme pain and fear. Much like many are today, Cézanne was apparently fascinated by crime stories, or ‘putrid literature’ as the critics of the day called it. It is suggested that The Murder was inspired by the grisly 1867 novel Thérèse Raquin written by his childhood friend Emile Zola.\n\nOedipus Cursing His Son Polynices, Henry Fuseli, 1786, oil on canvas. Swiss painter Henry Fuseli (1741–1825) began his career in England as a history painter whose Expressionistic style was composed of a unique blend of influences – German Romanticism, the monumental vision of Michelangelo, and the physical and psychological exaggerations of the sixteenth-century Italian Mannerists. Fuseli’s own pessimism and fascination with the extremes of human passion are evident in this emotionally charged scene of a mythical family feud from Sophocles’ Oedipus at Colonus. The tragedy of the father’s curse is played out through the extreme gestures and contortions of the four figures. Polynices, head twisted away from his body, has come to ask his father’s support in overthrowing his brother Eteocles. Enraged at his son’s request, Oedipus points in reproach and imposes his dreadful curse, that each son would die at the hands of the other. Ismene, in despair, kneels at her father’s knee. Antigone is highlighted above the terrible drama as\n\nshe reaches out to protect her brother with one hand and restrain Oedipus with the other. Her heroic gesture, as with much else in this particular family’s history, is futile.\n\nUntitled, Joseba Eskubi, 2012, mixed media. The abstract paintings of artist Joseba Eskubi (b. 1967), contrasting intense colours and darkness, are teeming with biomorphic forms and convulsive, contradictory shapes, and melting blobs that seem to ooze with sentient life at the same time as they are rotting in a grotesque and beautiful state of suspended decay. These amorphous creatures contain entire universes fraught with the murkier aspects of the human condition: secrets, movements and metamorphoses, a bubbling sludge overflowing with tensions from an entirely human-imagined abyss.\n\nTimoclea Killing Her Rapist, Elisabetta Sirani, 1659, oil on canvas. Italian Baroque artist Elisabetta Sirani (1638–65), a significant and influential artist of the Bolognese School of painting, was thought of as one of the most learned, innovative and successful artists of the period. An independent painter by the age of nineteen, Sirani ran her family’s workshop. When her father became incapacitated by gout, she supported her parents, three siblings and herself entirely through her art. Sirani advocated for both women painters and women subjects during her short life and opened a painting school where she trained many women, including her younger sisters. Her righteous championing of women and their stories is powerfully demonstrated in Timoclea Killing Her Rapist, wherein Sirani quite literally gives us the patriarchy turned on its head – Thebes resident Timoclea, after being raped by the captain of the Thracian forces, tossed the assailant into a well in her garden (where he had followed her after having the gall to ask her for money after he\n\nhad assaulting her) and resolutely rained heavy rocks down on his head until her rapist was dead.\n\nWar, Paula Rego, 2003, pastel on paper on aluminium. This portrayal of war and suffering with bloodied rabbit marionettes centre stage by Portuguese-born British artist Paula Rego (b. 1935) was a response to a press photograph published in the early stages of the Iraq War. The photograph featured a screaming girl in a white dress running from an explosion, while a woman and a baby remain stationary behind her. Compositions combining animal heads and masks, young girls and children’s toys, all of which appear in War, recur throughout Rego’s work, which often invokes the imagery of fairy tales with sinister or gothic overtones and plays on viewers’ notions of innocence.\n\nThis Will Hurt Me More Than It Hurts You, Darla Jackson, 2021, polyurethane resin. The work of contemporary sculptor Darla Jackson (b. 1981) is an exploration of human emotions, feelings translated through recognizable visual objects and combined with other elements to create symbolic dualities. The end result is a familiarity revealing some compelling and insightful peculiarities. This four-bird knuckleduster, an implement of fairy-tale violence both cute and intimidating, offers ideas of protection and self-defence that are so often needed yet usually suspiciously absent in portrayals of women in popular culture. According to the artist, the title, This Will Hurt Me More Than It Hurts You, is a reference to the fact that women are often criticized for standing up for themselves.\n\nPerversité (Perversity), Odilon Redon, 1891, etching and drypoint print. Highly influential among the late nineteenth-century French avant-garde circle and noted for his singular and intriguing artistic style evoking a mysterious world of melancholic fantasy, Odilon Redon (1840–1916) created imaginative scenes which were frequently explorations in light and darkness. In Perversity, a face emerges from murky shadows and twists languidly over one shoulder with a indefinable yet decidedly decadent expression that nonetheless evokes profound unease. You don’t really want to know what’s on this figure’s mind. Or . . . do you?\n\nSaturn Devouring His Son, Francisco Goya, c. 1819–23, mixed method on mural transferred to canvas. The mural paintings that decorated the house known as La Quinta del Sordo, where master-of-horror Spanish painter Francisco Goya (1746– 1828) lived, have come to be known as the Black Paintings, because he used so many sombre pigments and blacks in them, and also because of their morbid subject matter. One of the images he placed in the interior of the living room, dealing with his haunting fears of death, was the unspeakably cruel and horrifying image of the Titan Saturn devouring one of his sons. This mythological god could be the personification of such a human feeling as the fear of losing one's power, but also many of the interpretations of Saturn Devouring His Son are focused on the artist’s inner conflicts between old and young age, as well as the disturbing relationship with his own son and the metaphor of the revolution eating its children.\n\nThe Face of War, Salvador Dalí, 1940, oil on canvas. The Face of War, by world-renowned Surrealist artist Salvador Dalí (1904– 89), is a surreal vision of the trauma and horror of war and is frequently interpreted as premonition of the Second World War, as it was painted in the period after the Spanish Civil War and just before war breaks out in Spain again. The focus of this Surrealist painting is a disembodied face hovering against a barren desert landscape, with identical faces filling mouth and eye holes. Within the optical illusion, skulls are multiplying in the face holes to infinity thus illustrating feelings of the eternal continuity of death and horror. Surrounding the face are serpents creeping around the empty and abandoned landscape. The emptiness and pessimism of this painting reveals the real sentiments of people exhausted by the never-ending destruction of war in Europe.\n\nVictim, Gustave Moreau, unknown date, oil on canvas. The works of French Symbolist artist Gustave Moreau (1826–98) often focused on biblical and mythological figures, narratives overwhelmed with beauty and the sublime, wrought with the artist’s distinct sense of phantasmagorical theatricality. In Victim, we behold an accusing figure whose dark fury and wrath is nearly vibrating off the canvas. One knows not what mystery lies within this wordless recrimination, what sins or slights were visited upon the injured party – one can only hope that they are not the culprit at the end of that resolute finger.\n\nFollowing spread: Romans during the Decadence, Thomas Couture, 1847, oil on canvas. Academic painter Thomas Couture (1815–79) was best known for his portraits and historical genre pictures, such as Romans during the Decadence (1847), which created a sensation at the Salon of 1847. Combining soft, eighteenthth-century colouring and the rigid pomposity of nineteenth-century classicism in this work concerning a debauched ruling class abandoning themselves to vice, Couture appeared to his contemporaries to have succeeded in combining Antiquity and the present (along with creating an allegorical criticism of the government in nineteenth-century France.)\n\nVI\n\n—\n\nMatters of Mortality ‘Dying / Is an art, like everything else.’ – SYLVIA PLATH, ‘LADY LAZARUS’\n\nI\n\nn your grim fancies and imaginings, I’m fairly sure that notions of darkthemed art don’t get more morbid and miserable than envisioning the macabre-minded artist who appears to be alarmingly obsessed with death: artists whose lightless canvases are strewn with skulls both screaming and silent, the rot and decay of the flayed corpse, ornate coffins, lonely gravestones and grim reapers gone wild. But please do not be alarmed! This fascination with death and mortality is a common theme woven in and out of many artists’ work, and it’s not always as obvious as the imagery above suggests. There may even be a painting or two among your favourites wrought with such subtlety that you might not even have realized the artist’s intent was to grapple with mortality. There is but one certainty in life, and that is that none of us will be here forever . . . and furthermore, unless you are a time traveller or a psychic or playing a character in that subgenre of horror film where you learn your death date, we don’t know when our time is up. No mortal knows with certainty when the thread of life will be snipped short; when, thus untethered, we will shuffle forever from this plane of existence. And in the mystery of this uncertainty lies one of the most pervasive themes in art history. This fascination is so prevalent, universal and relatable I sometimes wonder why we consider it to be a ‘dark preoccupation’. We’ve all been there. We’re all headed there. Almost every culture formulates its own ideas, however formless and hazy, as to what happens to the individual after death, from the Christian geographies of heaven and hell in Michelangelo’s The Last Judgment (1536–41) and Botticelli’s The Abyss of Hell (c. 1485) to the Buddhist beliefs in reincarnation and the cycles of life, death and rebirth as seen in the Tibetan Wheel of Rebirth, to the famous Egyptian Book of the Dead, a perfect example of the work of art created for the sole purpose of helping the soul pass to the other side. Likewise, every culture has rituals and traditions surrounding death, concerning the treatment of the body, the preparation of the grave and mourning. Down through the ages, particularly in times of strife, people were encouraged to ponder death and its meaning. Artworks created during times of plague, for example, reminded even the most powerful that their\n\nlife was fragile, temporary and provisional. These memento mori, a phrase that translates to ‘remember that you will die’, may seem ghoulish to some, but were designed to remind the viewer of the shortness and fragility of human life. For centuries, artists have explored the concepts of memento mori in a number of unique ways, developing a common language of expressive visual symbolism over time. Vanitas was a popular theme in the art of still lifes of sixteenth- and seventeenth-century Flanders and Netherlands, utilizing the still-life form to evoke the fleeting quality of life and the vanity of living. Modern artists continue to explore these themes, communicating that the things of this world – pleasures, money, beauty, power – are not everlasting. The early twentieth century saw swift changes on industrial, economic, social and cultural levels which provided a basis for new artistic movements, and with the tremendous scale of death and destruction resulting from the greatest war the world had ever seen, art increasingly became abstracted. Avant-garde ideas challenged traditional art history and these Expressionistic approaches to art-making changed the representation of death in art. Death no longer required such obvious symbolism. A field of crows? Death. A canvas painted completely black? Death. We know it when we see it, don’t we? The manner in which contemporary artists negotiate death moves beyond the actual spectacle of death. In work by artists such as Damien Hirst and Shirin Neshat we observe how mortality brings us face to face with profound ethical and even political issues, to include powerful memorial work for communities experiencing vast devastation. Death is an inherent and imminent part of life and, despite humanity’s prodigious advancements, we still don’t boast the science for immortality – though I maintain that the creation and appreciation of art is certainly the next best thing. For the present: the next time you find yourself confronted with the shocking imagery of a skull with hollow eyes and a grinning visage, take a moment to accept your fear, recognize the universal human experience being shared in the moment, mentally pat that skull on the head and acknowledge your kinship, and say, It’s OK, friend. I’m right behind you.\n\nThe Mourners, Evelyn De Morgan, c. 1915, oil on canvas. The Mourners by Evelyn De Morgan (1855–1919) is one in a series of symbolic pictures of war subjects inspired by the artist’s distress over the First World War. The horrors of the war and its enormous death toll this brought had a profound effect on de Morgan and her artwork, typically reflective of the artist’s penchant for allegorical or symbolic subjects. In this work wrought in sombre shades amid a barren landscape, lamenting figures in ragged robes, with arms raised in despair and grief, gaze towards a vision in a striking vortex of golden light. An original label on the reverse reads: ‘The unhappy people, in their misery, are haunted by a vision of past happiness.’\n\nDanse Macabre, Johann Elias Ridinger, mid-eighteenth century, mezzotint. In Danse Macabre by German painter and engraver Johann Elias Ridinger (1698–1767), nine women from a variety of social backgrounds gather in order to dance with the dead around two skeletons in a coffin. The entire economy of salvation is depicted, from the Fall, through the crucifixion, to Heaven and Hell. This artistic genre of allegory of the Late Middle Ages is a comment on the universality of death: no matter one’s station in life, the Danse Macabre unites all. This is a theme which has proved remarkably adaptable over the centuries; some artists have taken the whole Dance of Death and set it in their own time, while others have taken a traditional episode from the Dance of Death and have treated it in their idiosyncratic style.\n\nŚmierć każdego ułagodzi (Death Appeases Everyone), Marian Wawrzeniecki, 1898, oil on canvas. Warsaw-born Polish painter, art historian and archaeologist Marian Wawrzeniecki (1863–1943) was influenced by Slavic culture and French and German Symbolism. He painted fairy-tale motifs in the context of the archetypes of the human psyche and much of his output was governed by the prospect of death, which threatens every person with ruthless cruelty.\n\nLandscape with a Graveyard by Night, Matthias Withoos, c. seventeenth century, oil on canvas. Matthias Withoos (1627–1703) was a Dutch painter of city scenes and gloomy wildlife tableaux, many of which incorporate vanitas motifs and which are notable for their close-ups of the mysterious flora and fauna enlivening dark forest undergrowth. In this melancholic graveside scene bathed in dusk’s dramatic lighting, we sense in the tangled ivy and weathered stone that time is indeed marching on, as unseen below, the dead slumber on.\n\nCold Soil Kettle, Caitlin McCormack, 2020, crocheted cotton string, glue, foraged pigments, steel pins, velvet. Caitlin MacCormack creates work of sombre delicacy, ghostly skeletal remains tenderly chained with fragile lace, via cotton, glue and a quickly flashing crochet hook. By utilizing media and practices inherited from departed relatives, the artist aims to generate emblems of a diminishing bloodline, representative of both the persistence of memory and the significance of cloth and thread in the realm of human experience.\n\nFor the Love of God, Damien Hirst, 2007, platinum, diamond and human teeth. In 2007, Damien Hirst (b. 1965) made headlines with a work consisting of 8,601 of the world’s finest diamonds encrusting the platinum cast of a human skull from the mid–1800s, complete with the skull’s original real human teeth – titled For the Love of God, apparently in response to a question posed by the artist’s mother (‘For the love of God, what are you going to do next?’). Hirst’s fascination with skulls began at a young age. At sixteen, the artist began visiting the anatomy department of Leeds Medical School to draw the cadavers. ‘[Death is] just something that inspires me, not something that pulls me down,’ Hirst once explained. ‘And every day your relationship with death changes.’ Since it was first exhibited in 2007, For the Love of God has become one of the most\n\nwidely recognized works of contemporary art. It represents the artist’s continued interest in mortality and notions of value.\n\nVanitas Still Life, Jan van Kessel the Elder, c. 1665–70, oil on copper. A versatile artist who practised in many genres, Jan van Kessel (1626–79) specialized in small-scale pictures of subjects culled from the natural world, including studies of animals and insects both living and dead, still lifes of fruit, bouquets and garlands, marine and paradise landscapes, allegorical compositions and genre scenes. His brightly coloured, minutely detailed paintings on panel or copper were highly prized by connoisseurs and collectors. Vanitas, the loose category of artwork that illustrates the transience of life, the futility of pleasure and the certainty of death – often featuring conspicuous allegory in the form of dusty skulls, decaying flowers and the dwindling sands of hourglasses – offered an artful pretext to paint still-lifes of opulent objects behind a veneer of morality.\n\nMemento Mori, Walter Kuhlman, 1973–74, oil on canvas. US painter, printmaker and teacher, Walter Kuhlman (1918–2009) was a noted figure in the post-war Bay Area Abstract Expressionist movement based in San Francisco. He practised an abstract style of ragged forms and discordant colours that evolved into a softer but equally enigmatic figurative manner with symbolist undertones. The image of the human skull has appeared in several of Kuhlman’s paintings. Here, a hunched skull-headed figure stares at a floating flower garland: death yearning for life.\n\nRahim (Our House Is on Fire), Shirin Neshat, 2013, ink on digital chromogenic print. Shirin Neshat (b. 1957) is a contemporary Iranian visual artist best known for her work in photography, video and film. Neshat’s series Our House Is on Fire stems from the death and destruction she saw in Cairo, including the corpses of ‘young men and women and little children with tags on their feet’, when she travelled there to work in 2012. Like many of Neshat’s works, this series consists of portraits and details of hands and feet, capturing emotions that are at once individual and universal and exploring how people deal with pain on both a personal and national level.\n\nOak Fractured by Lightning, Maxim Vorobiev, 1842, oil on canvas. Russian Romantic landscape painter Maxim Vorobiev (1787–1855) specialized in picturesque seascapes and peaceful countryside views, as well as architectural monuments and war scenes. The staggering loss depicted in Oak Fractured by Lightning is markedly different. An allegory on his wife’s death, this emotionally charged vision captures the shock and anguish of losing a loved one. A bright bolt of opalescent lightning streaks down from the gloom of stormy skies, shattering an old oak tree in two – it is perhaps the perfect metaphor to express the howling desolation and heart-wrenching pain of the sudden death of someone you love.\n\nGrief, Oskar Zwintscher, 1898, oil on canvas. Those who have suffered a terrible loss know well the crushing feelings of despair that suffuse all of the colourless days that follow. In this work of the German artist Oskar Zwintscher (1870–1916), he eerily captu"
