        "text": "Made Exclusively for Land of Beds\n\nFor a mattress that leaves you feeling refreshed and recharged each morning, look no further than the Ortho Bronze from Hypnos. With a 6 Turn Reactive Pocket Spring System at it’s core, the Ortho Bronze will provide you with the exact level of support you and your partner need for a blissful night’s sleep, without rolling into one another. Providing you with superior comfort are generous layers of cotton, eOlus™ fibres and Solotex, each working together to offer sumptuous cushioning and enhanced breathability to help maintain the perfect body temperature all year round.\n\nAvailable in Firm or Extra Firm Tension\n\nReActive™ 6-Turn Pocket Spring System – Hypnos’s expertly engineered pocket springs, ReActive™ with 6 active turns, provide total body comfort. The more active turns in a single continuous pocket spring the greater it's ability to sense the exact comfort and support requirement of you and your partner. A single continuous pocket spring also creates a bellow-like effect that drives cool air around the mattress and facilitates greater hygiene. This extra breathability ensures better ventilation, helping to reduce moisture and maintain a comfortable body temperature for a healthy, relaxing, and energising night’s sleep.\n\nCotton Layer – A sustainably sourced cotton layer with responsive properties to complement the spring unit to help provide a comfortable feel and enhance breathability.\n\nSolotex™ - Provides a lofty comfort layer with rebound properties that promote airflow adding to the softness and will help with shape retention.\n\neOlus™ Sustainable Fibre – A sustainable comfort layer made from repurposed discarded polymer-based bottles, conserving natural resources, reducing landfill usage, and lowering pollution. Its unique vertically crimped design facilitates air circulation, actively regulating body temperature. This breathable layer cools the body and wicks away moisture more efficiently than foam while maintaining a similar soft and spongy texture.\n\nTriple Edge Protection™ - Higher tension edge springs provide true edge-to-edge support for total comfort and support. Designed with a non roll-off reinforced edge support to ensure total comfort and extends the sleeping area right up to the very edge.\n\nM-Pure Treated Cover - A pure and natural fire retardant is used on the cover, which is 100% sustainable, biodegradable and environmentally friendly. Instead of using the traditional chemical-based retardant, M-Pure uses natural Bio-based ingredients instead, giving you a fresh and hygienic sleeping surface.\n\nHand Tufted - The traditional method of mattress upholstery where the fillings are secured by hand with tufts from the top of the mattress to the bottom to ensure all loose fillings are secured to provide the perfect finish.\n\n2 Rows of Hand Side Stitching - Traditional hand-side stitching secures the outer springs to the border at the top and bottom preventing roll-out and is the most highly skilled and labour intensive of all the operations. Side-stitching is carried out by senior upholsterers using traditional long needles and twine to make borders and edges stronger. The effects on the mattress are quite dramatic preventing the springs from distorting and extending the sleeping area right up to the edge of the bed to make the borders and edges stronger.\n\nFlag-stitched Handles - Handles on all sides for ease of positioning.\n\nChrome Air Vents - Chrome finished vents to allow good air circulation, regulate temperature and keep the mattress fresh.\n\nEasy Care - No need to turn, but regular rotation from head to toe will extend the mattress's life span.\n\nEco-Friendly Packaging – Hypnos has developed an industry first by creating a recyclable, eco-friendly packaging solution. All Hypnos products are packaged in renewable sugar cane packaging that is 100% recyclable.\n\n100% Recyclable - With a clear focus on safe, low-carbon sustainable designs, all Hypnos mattresses are 100% foam-free and also 100% recyclable ensuring they never need to go to landfill.\n\nDivan Base Options\n\nGenuine Hypnos Base with Full 10 year guarantee.\n\nPlatform Top - The base features a wooden top that is upholstered in fabric. This type of base will provide a supportive feel to the mattress.\n\nFirm Edge Sprung Base - This type of base contains springs at the top to help create a supportive feel that works in conjunction with the mattress. A sprung base can increase the life span of your mattress. It would be recommended that this mattress be matched with a sprung divan base to provide a supremely luxurious feel.\n\nStorage Drawer Options - Quality drawers made from hard-wearing laminate, featuring runners for ultra-smooth operation. (Storage weight limit 20kg per standard drawer, or 10kg per continental drawer)\n\nHideaway™ - Hypnos has developed this platform top base that offers a unique hidden storage cavity which is elegantly concealed by an upholstered valance.\n\nSuperStorage™ - SuperStorage™ divan bases provide the ultimate storage solution. Simply lift the top of the divan, which is hinged to the base using hydraulic pistons to make it easy to lift, allowing you to use the entire divan base for storage. (Maximum load weight of 44kg per side, 88kg if two are linked together)\n\nSilver Castors - Castors are secured onto a hardwood corner block for maximum strength and easy positioning.\n\nAvailable in a range of fabrics and colours.\n\nMeasurements, Dimensions and Weights\n\nW – Width x L – Length x D – Depth - including Castors + Mattress\n\nSmall Single - W 75cm (2ft6) x L 190cm (6ft3) x D 63.5cm (25\") - Mattress Weight - 15kgs (33lbs)\n\nSingle - W 90cm (3ft) x L 190cm (6ft3) x D 63.5cm (25\") - Mattress Weight - 18kgs (40lbs)\n\nSmall Double - W 120cm (4ft) x L 190cm (6ft3) x D 63.5cm (25\") - Mattress Weight - 24kgs (53lbs)\n\nDouble - W 135cm (4ft6) x L 190cm (6ft3) x D 63.5cm (25\") - Mattress Weight - 27kgs (59lbs)\n\nKing Size - W 150cm (5ft) x L 200cm (6ft6) x D 63.5cm (25\") - Mattress Weight - 31kgs (68lbs)\n\nKing Size Zip & Link - 2 x W 75cm (2ft6) x L 200cm (6ft6) x D 63.5cm (25\") - Mattress Weight - 32kgs (70lbs)\n\nEuropean King Size - W 160cm (5ft3) x L 200cm (6ft6) x D 63.5cm (25\") - Mattress Weight - 33kgs (73lbs)\n\nSuper King Size - W 180cm (6ft) x L 200cm (6ft6) x D 63.5cm (25\") - Mattress Weight - 37kgs (82lbs)\n\nSuper King Size Zip & Link - 2 x W 90cm (3ft) x L 200cm (6ft6) x D 63.5cm (25\") - Mattress Weight - 38kgs (84lbs)\n\nFirm Edge Sprung Base Depth including castors - 40cm (15.7'')\n\nHideaway Base Depth including castors – 46.5cm (18.3’’)\n\nSuper Storage Ottoman Base Depth including castors – 41cm (16.1’’)\n\nHypnos: quality sleep shouldn’t cost the earth.\n\nHypnos is a fourth- and fifth-generation, UK-based luxury bed and mattress manufacturer known for its high-quality craftsmanship and durability.
