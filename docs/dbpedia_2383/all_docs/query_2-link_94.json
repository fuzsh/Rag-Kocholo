        "text": "Born in Florence in the 1380s, Donato di Niccolò di Betto Bardi, “Donatello” (1386-1466), was an Italian sculptor who became one of the greatest of all Italian Renaissance artists.\n\nIn his formative years, he initially trained as a goldsmith, being apprenticed to sculptor and goldsmith Lorenzo Ghiberti during the time of Ghiberti’s creation of the great bronze doors of the Baptistery of Florence Cathedral. Donatello went on to become renowned for his revolutionary work in sculptured relief and sculpture in the round and for creating several notable works that exuded realism for their time; masterpieces known for their intricate details, including the bronze David and the bronze equestrian statue of the Condottiero Gattamelata (1453) outside the Basilica of Saint Anthony in Padua …\n\nDonatello’s artistry and technical skill contributed significantly to the development of Renaissance art, with his work exemplifying a shift toward naturalism and a revival of Classical forms and techniques.\n\nThe Donatello Room in the Bargello Museum in Florence, showcases works by Donatello and some of his important contemporaries, but is, itself, part of an historic building that has served various purposes throughout its existence …\n\nOriginally constructed in 1255 as a fortress, the Bargello later became the seat of the city’s Chief Magistrate (Podestà) – the first public palazzo in Florence. Originally named the Palazzo del Popolo (Palace of the People), subsequently becoming the Palazzo del Podestà, by 1574 the Medici rulers of Florence replaced the offices of the Podestà with those of the city’s Police Chief (Bargello) – from when it took the name, Palazzo del Bargello.\n\nOver the centuries, the Bargello has functioned as a prison (up to 1786) and a barracks and, while a prison, saw many executions in its inner courtyard …\n\nBy 1865, it became a national museum, the Museo Nazionale del Bargello, which houses some of the most world-renowned artistic masterpieces. Today, the Bargello stands as a significant cultural landmark, showcasing a rich history that reflects not only the architectural but also the artistic evolution of Florence. It is well known for its exceptional collection of Renaissance sculptures, including works by artists such as Donatello, Michelangelo, Verrocchio and Cellini.\n\nThis particular ‘Italian Reflections’ post enters the museum into the courtyard and by-passes the Michelangelo Room (post in preparation) on the right to ascend the stairs to the first floor loggia …\n\nAt the top of the steps, a right turn takes the visitor into what was once a jail, but nowadays is the Donatello Room …\n\n… where one’s eyes are immediately drawn to …\n\nThis is Donatello’s most famous work, the bronze David, created around 1440, depicting the biblical hero David, who, as described in 1 Samuel 17, defeated the giant Goliath with a slingshot. It models David standing in a contrapposto pose, weight on his right leg with his left foot placed on Goliath’s head, which has been decapitated by Goliath’s own sword – now in David’s right hand.\n\nHere, the humble but courageous David stands victorious over the arrogance and the might of Goliath. At the time, David’s victory over Goliath was adopted by the Florentine Republic as a symbol of its battles – and victories – with its neighbouring city states.\n\nThis David, commissioned as a secular (non-religious) work by Florentine ruler Cosimo de’Medici, was intended for the courtyard of Palazzo Medici. With the Medici later expelled from Florence (between 1478 and 1535), the sculpture was moved to the Piazza della Signoria in 1495 where, in 1511, it was hit by lightning, sustaining minor damage. At this time, several major bronze statues were moved to accompany the David onto the Piazza della Signoria‘s ‘open-air art gallery’ to emphasise Florence’s wealth and power. This collection also included Donatello’s Judith and Holofernes (c. 1457), now housed inside the Palazzo Vecchio …\n\nDonatello’s David is a landmark, being the first freestanding nude sculpture to be sculpted ‘in the round’ since Greco-Roman times. The 15th-century bronze figure, created using the lost wax process from his original sculpture, marked a significant shift to a more naturalistic portrayal of the human form away from the prevailing Medieval Gothic sculptures of the previous 300 years, such as exhibited here at the west portal of Chartres Cathedral (1145-1155) …\n\nThe David is a notable masterpiece of the early Renaissance, not least for being the first unsupported standing work of bronze to be cast during the Renaissance period. Donatello’s bronze sculpture differs from both the Classical and Medieval depictions of David, realistically showcasing a youthful, androgynous figure, standing over the decapitated head of Goliath. Its artistic significance lies in its revival of Classical forms and its emphasis on naturalism.\n\nDonatello’s innovative David reflects his exceptional skill in capturing human emotion and movement, making it a pivotal, ground-breaking work in the history of art.\n\nThe Donatello Room also contains works that are only “Attributed to Donatello”, casting some doubt on their provenance. However, there are also original works by contemporary artists and, as if to say, “Anything you can do …”, nearby is another, a later, representation of David’s victory over Goliath. This time a bronze statue by Verrocchio – tutor to Leonardo da Vinci, amongst others – commissioned by Piero de’Medici …\n\nWhile both Donatello’s and Verrocchio’s bronze and gilded Davids are iconic representations of the biblical figure, they differ significantly in their artistic styles and interpretations.\n\nDonatello’s David, created between 1440 and 1460, embodies a classical sensibility with its slender, almost effeminate nude figure (apart from boots and the hat – reminiscent of Mercury’s winged hat). In contrast, Verrocchio’s David, crafted some 30 years later between 1473 and 1475, showcases a more muscular, athletic form, reflecting the developing Renaissance fascination with Humanism and here, in particular, with an idealised human body. Verrocchio’s David is also distinct for its poised, confident stance, wielding the sword with a sense of triumph, while Donatello’s version exudes a more subtle, introspective quality. Both sculptures signify the evolution of artistic techniques during the Italian Renaissance, each capturing a unique interpretation of the timeless biblical hero.\n\nThese two Davids are not alone. Nearby is a third David, an earlier religious marble sculpture by a young Donatello in his twenties, dating from about 1409 …\n\nThis religious work was originally intended to stand on one of the buttresses of Florence Cathedral but was deemed too small to be seen from ground level – especially the ‘small’ stone from David’s slingshot firmly embedded within Goliath’s forehead and the sling primed with the next stone resting on his hair!\n\nHere, in the Donatello Room, it is possible to make the 30-year comparison between Donatello’s two Davids (despite one being a semi-religious sculpture and the other being totally secular)…\n\nThe marble David of 1409 is clearly a product of the previous Gothic, Pre-Renaissance era (it compares with the 12th-century Chartres Cathedral examples above) with young Donatello accepting and working to the given norms of the closing Gothic era; the face is devoid of character (an expressionless face that could have been plucked straight out of antiquity) and the body is upright and ‘correct’. By 1440, with the coming of the Renaissance, the reawakening of Classical artwork and the rise in Humanism, the bronze David is full of life and character, the body is standing in a more realistic, casual manner – essentially Donatello is providing a rebirth of the styles of Greco-Roman statuary after a 1500 year hiatus.\n\nOf course, not too far away from the Bargello is probably the most famous and recognised sculpture of David in the world. This is Michelangelo’s High-Renaissance David from around 1504, housed in Florence’s Galleria dell’Accademia …\n\nImmediately behind and overlooking the bronze David, gazing out from a niche, is Donatello’s St George, dating from about 1417 …\n\nThe sculpture showcases a youthful – much more so than portrayed traditionally – Saint George who slayed the dragon. St George was the Christian martyr and patron saint of soldiers, here dressed in armour and leaning on his shield. His right hand is clenched around the handle of a sword (no longer there). Here, in this relatively early sculpture, we have a naturalistic representation, with the saint’s left foot slightly forward – creating a sense of movement – rather than in the rather static contrapposto pose.\n\nWhile the statue here in the Bargello is Donatello’s own work, the niche in which it here stands is a reproduction of the original.\n\nCompleted around 1417, St George showcases Donatello’s early mastery of sculpting techniques, his innovative portrayal of depth and movement, the dynamic, lifelike posture, the dramatic twist of the body and the intricate detailing of Saint George’s carefully crafted armour and tunic – all highlighting Donatello’s emerging departure from the rigid conventions of the preceding Gothic era.\n\nAs if the statue isn’t enough, Donatello provides us with a relief sculpture below …\n\n… which depicts Saint George slaying the dragon. It has a remarkable sense of movement in the way it captures the dramatic moment of the victory of good over evil …\n\nCentred, in relatively mid-relief, is St George slaying the dragon; to the left there is a cave and to the right a princess standing contrapposto with hands clasped together in gratitude for being saved from the dragon. Behind the maiden, Donatello’s masterful use of one of the first examples of central-point perspective is displayed where a portico recedes into the distance through a combination of perspective and an increasingly lighter touch of the sculptor’s chisels – both cave and portico are in bas-relief. The intricate details, the illusion of three-dimensional depth, the dynamic composition and the skilful rendering of emotions makes this work an exemplary piece of early Renaissance rilievo stiacciato, shallow-relief sculpture, pioneered by Donatello.\n\nThis time the work was not commissioned by the Medici, but by the Florentine Guild of Armourers and Swordsmiths whose patron saint was St George.\n\nFrom the 12th- to the 16th-century, the powerful Guilds of Florence were associations of craftsmen and tradespeople organised to regulate and protect the interests of their respective professions while at the same time contributing to the flourishing arts and crafts for which Florence was renowned.\n\nThe Orsanmichele Church was originally built in 1336 as a market, but by 1380 it was converted into a church around which fourteen of the various Guilds of Florence agreed to commission and finance statues of their patron saints in niches. These were sculpted by artists such as Donatello, Brunelleschi, Verrocchio, Ghiberti, Giambologna and others. Nowadays they have all been replaced with copies – with several of the originals now in the church itself.\n\nDonatello’s copy of St George can be seen in the fourth niche from the left …\n\nSt George was just one of three statues sculpted by Donatello for the Orsanmichele niches. There was also the marble St Mark (1411), for the Arte dei Linaiuoli e Rigattieri (Guild of Linen Weavers and Peddlers), the original of which is now housed within Orsanmichele. Again a copy is now in its place, but the third, a bronze and gilt sculpture of St Louis of Toulouse (c. 1423), commissioned by the Parte Guelfa and Donatello’s earliest surviving bronze, was not replaced but the original can be found not far away, in the refectory of the Museo di Santa Croce …\n\nBut back to the Donatello Room …\n\nFront and centre between the two bronze Davids is Donatello’s extremely lifelike Marzocco, a heraldic lion that serves as a symbol of Florence, representing the strength and independence of the Florentine Republic, as well as its defiance against external threats. Even today it continues to be an enduring emblem of Florence’s rich history and cultural heritage with many versions dotted around the city …\n\nCarved out of Tuscan grey sandstone, it depicts a male lion seated with its right paw upon a shield, on which is portrayed a red fleur-de-lys, the Florentine coat-of-arms.\n\nCommissioned around 1418 by the Republic of Florence for Pope Martin V’s apartment at Santa Maria Novella, by 1812 Donatello’s Marzocco had moved to the open space of the Piazza Signoria in front of the Palazzo Vecchio. There it stayed until 1885 when it moved to the Bargello …\n\n… with a copy replacing the original in the Piazza Signoria …\n\nTo David’s left stands his gilded bronze representation from Greek mythology of Attis-Amorino (Love-Attys), son of Aphrodite (Venus), another secular work also from around 1440 …\n\nThis impish, playful, childlike character seems to be dancing while stepping on a snake, which is writhing around under his winged feet. With the snake representing evil in Christian societies, this places Attis-Amorino in the realms of the good.\n\nThis work was only recognised as that of Donatello after being purchased by the Uffizzi Gallery in 1778. Until then it was thought by some to have been an antique Roman bronze, despite having been clearly described by Giorgio Vasari in his book on The Lives of the Artists (pub. 1550).\n\nFrom its apparently mutually exclusive attributes it has been considered, amongst other things, to be a cupid, a putto (cherub) or, because of the wings on its back, Mercury. In his book, Pagan Mysteries of the Renaissance (p. 246 ed. Adelphi 1985), Edgard Wind says, “He has the face and wings of classical Eros, he has the tail of Pan, the trousers of Attis, the belt of Hypnos and the sandals of Mercury” adding to the many interpretations that have been placed on this intriguing work – with none absolutely conclusive.\n\nNow take a look at the wall-hanging behind the bronze David …\n\nProduced for his then Florentine patrons, the Martelli family, this relief is a late work of the Crucifixion by Donatello (c. 1453) in which his innovative (for him) use of bronze and inlaid silver and gold has produced something more akin to a painting …\n\nBy chiselling out part of the bronze relief and lavishly applying thereon, thin laminates of gilded copper and silver, Donatello has essentially produced a painting in metal …\n\nOn the same wall, across the other side of St George, appear these two easily overlooked panels …\n\nThe production of these panels in 1401 was an absolutely pivotal event, a crucial event in the early Renaissance, marking a significant moment in the transition from Gothic to Renaissance art.\n\nThey are not works by Donatello (although one was by Lorenzo Ghiberti, to whom Donatello was apprenticed in his early career). The two panels were entries to a competition that was to decide who would produce the bronze panels for the second Baptistery doors of Florence Cathedral.\n\nHere, both partially gilded bronze relief panels depict the biblical story, The Sacrifice of Isaac, and are the only surviving entries to the competition which had been organised by the Arte di Calimala guild – the Guild of Cloth Finishers.\n\nLorenzo Ghiberti and Filippo Brunelleschi were the two finalists who sculpted these panels, with Ghiberti ultimately given the commission – earning himself what was probably the most prestigious commission at that time.\n\nGhiberti’s design showcased a harmonious blend of Gothic elegance and emerging Renaissance ideals …\n\nHis submission highlights his mastery of perspective and narrative composition. The scene is harmonious (despite its gruesome depiction from Genesis 22:1-19 of Abraham about to cut the throat of his son, Isaac) and demonstrates a keen understanding of classical aesthetics.\n\nGhiberti’s success played a pivotal role in his career and, amongst other things, he later went on to create a second set of doors for the Baptistery, known as the Gates of Paradise …\n\nThe figures (over)fill the frame in Brunelleschi’s entry, contravening the official brief, …\n\n… nevertheless, according to his biographer, Antonio Manetti (1423-1497), Brunelleschi was declared joint winner, but subsequently decided not to take part in the commission. However, the competition fuelled his artistic development with him eventually becoming a prominent Renaissance architect, renowned for his engineering feats, including the design and construction of the dome of Florence Cathedral …\n\nAfter spending part of his working life in Siena and a long-term residency in Padua, Donatello returned to Florence where he remained until his death in 1466 (aged 79-80). In his dotage, the ageing Donatello was to find working in stone too arduous and spent his final years working on bronze reliefs, including reliefs on two pulpits in the burial place of many of the Medici family, the church of San Lorenzo, Florence.\n\nThere is no doubt that Donatello was one of the most influential artists of the early Renaissance. His pioneering techniques in naturalism and perspective, his emphasis on lifelike anatomy, expressive poses and attention to detail, together with his innovations in bronze casting, all contributed to the transformation of art during the evolving Renaissance.\n\nHe left an enduring legacy, influencing generations of sculptors to come."
