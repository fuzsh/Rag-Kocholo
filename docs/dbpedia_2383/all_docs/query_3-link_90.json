Because of this, and because her distinct appearance makes her significantly recognisable, she must approach any need to visit the city with exceptional care.\n\nAlso if anyone's interested I've taken Cure Wounds as one of my Ranger spells, so that might mitigate our lack of healers somewhat!\n\nCandi\n\nOffline\n\nTenth Level\n\nPosts: 69\n\nMeet - Roht Morningstar!\n\nAge - ??\n\nClass - Warlock\n\nRace - Aasimir\n\nApperance - Golden Blonde hair that defies gravity with an anime style, He has a slight aura you wouldnt notice unless light hits him a certain way.
