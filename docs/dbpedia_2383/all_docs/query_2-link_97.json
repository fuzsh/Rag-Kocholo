        "text": "Nah.\n\nChronotectors of First Class Pallasites are alone > three Gold Cloths.\n\nThanatos busted 5 gold cloths, and I have a much higher opinion of Hypnos given:\n\nA) He was aware and cautious of how powerful God cloths were, but still thought he could match one\n\nB) Took down Shun, and needed a combo of Shiryu and Hyoga to beat him\n\nC) God Cloth Seiya hit him dead on with a Ryu sei ken and all it did was fracture his surplice a bit.\n\nAegaeon didn't do much but stalemate Ikki/surpass his sword's power and Galia got shredded by partial omegas. I'd rank God Cloths alongside the true Omega cloths.\n\nIkki was just taking advantage of his Phoenix Cloth's revival power-ups and surpassed his limits\n\nAegaeon also went beyond his limits too after his sword got destroyed\n\nYep.\n\nThanatos busted 5 gold cloths\n\nAgain, so what? Those were Gold Cloths worn by the Bronze Saints. The Chronotectors are specifically designed as Saturn's counterparts having the equivalent to God Cloths. They'd be superior to the Suprlices of the Twin Gods as well.\n\nand I have a much higher opinion of Hypnos given:\n\nWe are aware you do.\n\nAegaeon didn't do much but stalemate Ikki/surpass his sword's power and Galia got shredded by partial omegas. I'd rank God Cloths alongside the true Omega cloths.\n\nThis doesn't even follow. Ikki even comments after Aegaeon loses his sword that he got even stronger.\n\nOmega + God Cloths > God Cloths. That's what got Gallia.\n\nSome of those Bronzes were already on the level of Judges, particularly Ikki and Hyoga.\n\nThe Bronze Saints at the start of the Hades Chapter are maybe shuffled somewhere between being below normally the Mid level Gold Saints and above the Low level Golds. We saw Seiya get wafflestomped by Shaka's finger at the Wailing Wall and Mu forcibly BFRing Seiya, Deathmask, and Aphrodite with ease.\n\nWasn't aware of this, but then Galia and Aegaeon don't really show that? Unless Ikki and partial Omega saints were also god-saint level. In which case, Twin Gods get wrecked.\n\nThey are, numerous times the Gold Cloths are called \"intimidation\" or \"fake\" God Cloths by the Pallasites in season 2 Omega. It stands to reason the Chronotectors are meant to be God Cloths for the Heavenly Kings.\n\nLet's recap:\n\n- First-class Pallasites Chronotectors > 3 Gold Cloths collectively.\n\n- According to Fudo, collectively the Four Heavenly Kings are >= the Gold Saints collectively (Seiya, Fudo, Harbringer, Shiryuu, Kiki, Integra, etc...all the current Gold Saints) which isn't surprising given Hyperion's sword alone was stated to be equal or greater than Abzu\n\n- Hyouga whose at least on par with the high tier Gold Saints like Fudo and Amor and defeated a much stronger Deathwatch Tokisada who was an upper mid-tier Gold Saint was overwhelmed by the power Aegaeon showed in his Cosmo and he has experience fighting the Twin Gods and Mars\n\n- Rhea whose called the \"strongest of the Class-Two Pallasites was a match for Hyouga and his Gae Bolg was equal to Shiryuu/Shura's Excalibur and could easily smash Orcichalium, the material used to make Gold Cloths and other divine armors\n\n- Gallia showing up \"casually\" sliced through the Gemini Gold Cloth\n\n- She easily dodged Seiya's Pegasus Meteor Fist attack repeatedly\n\n- Harbringer's strongest attack was nullified by Gallia, same repeated itself when Kiki tried his Stardust Revolution attack against her\n\n- Even a combined Another Dimension attack performed by both Integra and Pandora did nothing to Gallia\n\n- Once they reach that special dimension or zone that Gallia's Cosmos was stated to \"envelope\" she admits she was holding back against the Gold Saints the entire time previously"
