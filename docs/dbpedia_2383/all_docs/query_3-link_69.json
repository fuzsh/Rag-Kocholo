        "text": "The mythical twin heroes, Kastor (ÎÎ¬ÏÏÏÏ, beaver; Latin, Castor) and Polydeukes (Î Î¿Î»Ï Î´ÎµÏÎºÎ·Ï, much sweet wine; Latin, Polydeuces or Pollux) were known as the Dioskouroi (Greek ÎÎ¹ÏÏÎºÎ¿Ï ÏÎ¿Î¹, sons of Zeus; Latin, Dioscuri). [1]\n\nThe various versions of the myths concerning the twins are inconsistent and often vague. One twin was said to be the immortal son of the Aetolian princess Leda (ÎÎ®Î´Î±, daughter of King Thestius) and Zeus, who disguised himself as a swan to have sex with her. The other, conceived the same night, was the mortal son of Leda and her husband King Tyndareos of Sparta (Î¤Ï Î½Î´Î¬ÏÎµÏÏ). However, which of the twins was immortal is not clear: it is generally thought that Polydeukes was the immortal son of Zeus, and Kastor the mortal son of Tyndareos.\n\nIn some versions of the myths, the coupling of Leda and Zeus as a swan (see below) produced one or two eggs, from which hatched one of the twins and Helen of Troy. [2] At the same time Leda also give birth to the other twin and Clytaemnestra (ÎÎ»Ï ÏÎ±Î¹Î¼Î½Î®ÏÏÏÎ±), conceived by more conventional means with Tyndareos. Helen (á¼Î»Î­Î½Î·) married Menelaos, king of Sparta, but her abduction by the Trojan prince Paris (see below) led to the Trojan War. Clytaemnestra married Menelaos' brother Agamemnon, king of Mycenae, but murdered him on his return from Troy (see below). In yet another mythological variant, it was Nemesis (ÎÎ­Î¼ÎµÏÎ¹Ï), the goddess of retribution, who was raped by Zeus as a swan and produced an egg from which Helen hatched. The egg was found by or given to Leda who became Helen's nurse (see image below right). [3]\n\nThe Dioskouroi were also half-brothers of Timandra, Phoebe, Herakles, and Philonoe.\n\nThe twins were closely associated with horses, often depicted as mounted warriors or hunters (such cult images of mythical horsemen were widespread among ancient cultures) and particularly revered by cavalry soldiers.\n\nThey also appeared as warriors and hunters in several mythical tales, including the hunting of the Kalydonian Boar (see photos below), the feud between Sparta and Athens following the abduction of Helen by Theseus, and the expedition of Jason and the Argonauts.\n\nThere were also tales of cattle theft (see photo below), abduction of women, rivalry, trickery and revenge involving the Dioskouroi and their cousins Lynkeus and Idas (the Apharidae, sons of Aphareus), twin brothers from Messenia [4]. The growing emnity between the two sets of twins ended with Idas ambushing and killing Kastor, and Polydeukes killing Lynkeus.\n\nOther versions of the myths related that both the Dioskouroi were killed in combat by Lynkeus and Idas during a siege of Sparta (Lacedaemon). In the Iliad by Homer, during the siege of Troy Helen asks why her brothers are not among the Greek besiegers (Achaeans) she can see from the walls of the city. Homer tells us that, unknown to her, both were already dead and buried:\n\n\"'I see, moreover, many other Achaeans whose names I could tell you, but there are two whom I can nowhere find, Castor, breaker of horses, and Pollux the mighty boxer; they are children of my mother, and own brothers to myself. Either they have not left Lacedaemon, or else, though they have brought their ships, they will not show themselves in battle for the shame and disgrace that I have brought upon them.'\n\nShe knew not that both these heroes were already lying under the earth in their own land of Lacedaemon.\"\n\nHomer, Iliad, Book 3. Translated by Samuel Butler.\n\nAfter Kastor's death, Polydeukes asked Zeus to allow his twin brother share his immortality so that they could remain together. Zeus transformed them both into the stars today known as the Gemini (Latin for twins) constellation, the heavenly twins. Some ancient authors wrote that they shared immortality in turns. Even Homer, who had consigned them to beneath the earth in The Iliad, explained in The Odyssey that each was alive and then dead on alternate days:\n\n\"And I saw Lede, the wife of Tyndareus, who bore to Tyndareus two sons, stout of heart, Castor the tamer of horses, and the boxer Polydeuces. These two the earth, the giver of life, covers, albeit alive, and even in the world below they have honor from Zeus. One day they live in turn, and one day they are dead; and they have won honour like unto that of the gods.\"\n\nHomer, Odyssey, Book 11, lines 298-304. At Perseus Digital Library.\n\nThey are sometimes called the Tyndaridae or Tyndarids (Î¤Ï Î½Î´Î±ÏÎ¯Î´Î±Î¹, Tyndaridai), a reference to their father / stepfather King Tyndareos of Sparta. The worship of the Dioskouroi appears to have had its origins and centre at Sparta, where they were associated with the Spartan tradition of dual kingship, and there were many sanctuaries dedicated to the twins around the Peloponnese. The cult spread throughout the ancient Greek world, and they were also worshipped by the Etruscans (as Kastur and Pultuce), Romans and Gauls.\n\nTwo \"Homeric Hymns\" [5] are dedicated to the Dioskouroi, in both of which the brothers are referred to as the Tyndaridae, born to Leda below Mount Taygetos (Î¤Î±Î°Î³ÎµÏÎ¿Ï), west of Sparta, after Zeus (\"Son of Cronos\") had slept with her.\n\n\"Sing, clear-voiced Muse, of Castor and Polydeuces, the Tyndaridae, who sprang from Olympian Zeus. Beneath the heights of Taygetus stately Leda bare them, when the dark-clouded Son of Cronos had privily bent her to his will.\n\nHail, children of Tyndareus, riders upon swift horses!\"\n\nHomeric Hymn 15, To the Dioscuri at Wikisource.\n\nHymn 33 also describes the role of the Dioskouroi as the protectors of seafarers, for which they were worshipped at places such as the Northern Aegean island of Thasos (see below).\n\n\"Bright-eyed Muses, tell of the Tyndaridae, the Sons of Zeus, glorious children of neat-ankled Leda, Castor the tamer of horses, and blameless Polydeuces. When Leda had lain with the dark-clouded Son of Cronos, she bare them beneath the peak of the great hill Taygetus, children who are deliverers of men on earth and of swift-going ships when stormy gales rage over the ruthless sea. Then the shipmen call upon the sons of great Zeus with vows of white lambs, going to the forepart of the prow; but the strong wind and the waves of the sea lay the ship under water, until suddenly these two are seen darting through the air on tawny wings. Forthwith they allay the blasts of the cruel winds and still the waves upon the surface of the white sea: fair signs are they and deliverance from toil. And when the shipmen see them they are glad and have rest from their pain and labour.\n\nHail, Tyndaridae, riders upon swift horses! Now I will remember you and another song also.\"\n\nHomeric Hymn 33, To the Dioscuri at Wikisource.\n\nThe city of Tyndaris (Î¤Ï Î½Î´Î±ÏÎ¯Ï; also Tyndarion, Î¤Ï Î½Î´Î¬ÏÎ¹Î¿Î½; today Tindari) in northeastern Sicily was named after the Tyndaridae (Dioskouri) by refugees from the Peloponnese, Zakynthos and Naupaktos, who had been driven from Greece by the Spartans at the end of the Peloponnesian War and were resettled at the location around 396 BC the tyrant Dionysius I of Syracuse (ruled 405-367 BC). [6] It was one of the last cities in Sicily to be founded solely by Greeks. They issued coins marked TYNÎÎPÎÎ¤ÎÎ (Tyndaritan) with depictions of the Dioskouri.\n\nThe twins were also known as Anakes (á¼Î½Î±ÎºÎµÏ, kings; also translated as \"protectors\", \"guardians\" and \"on high\"; Plutarch, Life of Theseus, 33.1), their annual religious festival the Anakeia (á¼Î½Î¬ÎºÎµÎ¹Î±), and their temple the Anakeion (á¼Î½Î¬ÎºÎµÎ¹Î¿Î½).\n\nThere was an Anakeion beneath the Sanctuary of Aglauros on the east slope of the Athens Acropolis. Pausanias described a sculpture group and paintings dedicated to them there:\n\n\"The sanctuary of the Dioscuri is ancient. They themselves are represented as standing, while their sons are seated on horses. Here Polygnotus has painted the marriage of the daughters of Leucippus, was a part of the gods' history, but Micon those who sailed with Jason to the Colchians, and he has concentrated his attention upon Acastus and his horses.\"\n\nDescription of Greece, Book 1, chapter 18, section 1.\n\nPausanias also mentions that \"at Kephale [in Attica] the chief cult is that of the Dioskouroi, for the inhabitants call them the Megaloi Theoi [Great Gods]\".\n\nDescription of Greece, Book 1, chapter 31, section 1.\n\nAccording to the poet and collector of epigrams Meleager of Gadara (ÎÎµÎ»Î­Î±Î³ÏÎ¿Ï á½ ÎÎ±Î´Î±ÏÎµÏÏ, 1st century BC), the cyclamen (ÎºÏ ÎºÎ»Î¬Î¼Î¹Î½Î¿Ï) was named after the Dioskouroi:\n\n\"... the Muses' cyclamen which takes its name from the twin sons of Zeus.\" [7]\n\nIn Greek and Roman art the Dioskouroi are usually depicted as naked apart from a pilos (Ïá¿Î»Î¿Ï) conical cap (see Medusa), chlamys (ÏÎ»Î±Î¼ÏÏ, short cloak) and sometimes boots, each holding a spear and often on or with a horse. They are sometimes shown with a star above each head, particularly on coins (see coins above right and below, and a votive relief below)."
