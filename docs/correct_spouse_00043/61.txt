Hong Kong singer-actor Leon Lai Ming and wife of four years Gaile Lok Kei-yi announced on Wednesday that they had officially split up, citing serious differences in their “life philosophies”.

The statement, released by the couple’s management agency Paciwood Music & Entertainment, said the two had “shared many happy memories together and still cared deeply for one another” but, after carefully consideration, decided to end the relationship.

“Hopefully, the public will allow the two their personal space during these difficult times so they can adapt to their new lives and stay focused on work,” the statement added.

“On behalf of Ms Gaile Lok and Mr Leon Lai, we would like to express their sincere gratitude to the media and friends, for their support and care.”

The pair began dating in 2005 and wed three years later at a secret wedding in Las Vegas.

Model Lok, who is 14 years younger than Lai, has been the subject of a string of rumours regarding an extra-marital affair.
