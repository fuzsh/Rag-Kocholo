        "text": "Yoyo Chen 2-Months Pregnant with Vincent Wong’s Baby, Sparking Rushed Wedding\n\nThursday October 20, 2011 Hong Kong\n\nCredits: to Jayne @ http://www.jaynestars.com/\n\nTVB actress, 30-year-old Yoyo Chen (陳自瑤) and 28-year-old Vincent Wong (王浩信) have been dating for 3 years. Despite a noisy break up earlier, Vincent successfully reconciled with Yoyo within two weeks. The pair appeared to have straightened out their problems, as Vincent suddenly announced the couple’s wedding plans! However, Vincent denied that the reason for the rushed wedding was due to Yoyo’s alleged pregnancy!\n\nEager to become “Mrs. Wong,” it was understood that Yoyo was almost two months pregnant and wished to get married before her belly bump surfaced. Yoyo and Vincent’s wedding will be held on November 13, 2011 at the Island Shangri-La Hotel in Hong Kong.\n\nIt was revealed that Yoyo and Vincent filed for marriage papers on October 7th. Although Vincent claimed that he had possessed marriage plans early in advance and planned to get his marriage certificate on a unique day (11/11/11) , it was understood that Yoyo’s pregnancy was the reason behind the couple’s rushed wedding.\n\nAn insider revealed, “Yoyo and Vincent admitted to their friends that they were expecting a baby. Otherwise, they will not get married so quickly. There is not a lot of time left and they could not secure a larger venue for their wedding. The date of the marriage registration and wedding reception are only two days apart! Due to space limitations, they can only accommodate over a dozen banquet tables.\n\n“OnceVincent completes his theatrical project with Leila Tong (唐寧), he will partner with his good friends on a project, allowing his wife to rest more. After the paparazzi secretly photographed Yoyo and Vincent lounging in their apartment earlier, Vincent originally intended to move to a new home. Now that Yoyo is pregnant, they will follow Chinese tradition and not move at this sensitive time, choosing to will wait until after the baby is born,” Vincent’s close friend revealed.\n\nExcerpt from Next Magazine # 1128\n\nA Star-Studded Wedding Party\n\nYoyo’s bridesmaids will be her friends outside the entertainment industry. Vincent’s groomsmen will be his colleagues in the industry, including Him Law (羅仲謙) and Stephen Huynh (黃長興). The couple will invite Fala Chen (陳法拉), Sharon Chan (陳敏之), Nancy Wu (胡定欣), Felix Wong (黃日華), Michael Miu (苗僑偉), and more friends from the industry to their wedding reception.\n\nExcerpt from Next Magazine # 1128\n\nRoy Chow fired by TVB; Virginia Lok denies a cover up\n\nFriday, October 21, 2011 Hong Kong\n\nSource: Mingpao and Oriental Daily\n\nTranslation: llwy12@ http://asianfanatics.net\n\nFormer singer Roy Chow had worked as a music production apprentice in TVB’s music department (TVB Music Limited) up until earlier this year – in May, his contract was suddenly terminated and he was ‘let go’ [fired] by TVB. Earlier, it was reported that Roy was fired for being too nosy – he had reported his boss, music producer Tang Chi Wai (鄧智偉), to Virginia Lok, claiming that producer Tang had opened up a recording studio under a friend’s name and was sourcing TVB’s projects to that studio, thereby possibly gaining a monetary advantage. However, because Tang Chi Wai is a ‘favorite’ of Virginia Lok’s, the issue was ‘swept under the rug’ and Roy ended up being fired.\n\n[Oriental Daily] contacted Roy for clarification on the issue. He admitted that TVB had terminated his contract: “I had done wrong in the past and paid dearly for it, so I was worried that being involved with such potentially ‘problem’ projects as a TVB employee could get me in trouble – therefore, I asked Ms Lok whether it was ok to do so. Ms Lok replied back asking me why there would be a problem and told me not to stir up so much trouble.” Roy expressed that a friend suggested that he report the matter to the ICAC, but because of his faith [TN: he’s a born-again Christian], he didn’t want to pursue the issue further, so he just let things be. Not long after that, he received a warning letter from the company saying that his performance was unsatisfactory and he was told to contact his immediate supervisor Tang Chi Wai. Roy stated: “I called him as requested, but he did not answer my phone call – later on, the Human Resources department contacted me and said that due to my inability to communicate with my supervisor, my contract was being terminated. Luckily, I was able to find another job; currently, I’m working for the government creating music teaching material – the pay is very good and we [my family] are not experiencing financial problems.”\n\nWhen Virginia Lok was contacted about Roy’s case, her ‘version’ of the story was completely different: “At the end of last year, the music department was ordered to dispatch themesongs to the radio station for airing, however the DJ from that station stated that no songs were received and so pressed us for them. Tang Chi Wai said that he had tasked Roy with the responsibility of dispatching the songs, but Roy didn’t follow his instructions. Therefore, I called Roy in to talk about the issue – he actually thought that I was going to sign a management contract with him, as he wanted to be a singer. He then complained that Tang Chi Wai had a private recording studio, but when I asked him if he had any proof of this, he said he didn’t. I asked Tang Chi Wai and he told me there was no such studio, so I asked the artists administrative department to investigate – they said that there were no problems with the receipts and transaction records. This proves Tang Chi Wai’s innocence – I did not cover up for him. Also, the entire matter was reported to Stephen Chan as well as the Human Resources department.”\n\nAs for Tang Chi Wai himself, he indicated that part of Roy’s responsibility as an apprentice was to dispatch songs to radio stations, but he did not fulfill his responsibilities, therefore the matter was turned over to the Human Resources department to handle. Tang Chi Wai insisted that he did not have his own personal studio and denounced the reports as being false. He also expressed that he will obtain legal advice regarding the matter.\n\n.---.\n\nRoy Chow responds to Virginia Lok’s accusations\n\nSource: Mingpao\n\nYesterday [last week], Roy accepted an interview with Metro Radio. When he was told of Virginia Lok’s response, he disdainfully stated: “My responsibility is only to write songs – I’ve never heard of ‘dispatching’ songs…what a new concept! Thank you for informing me that I actually have the ability to dispatch songs – I will definitely pay more attention to this area in the future! I actually don’t know what to say – if I had known when taking the job that my responsibility was to dispatch songs, I would have quit on the spot and not taken up the job in the first place.”\n\nRoy emphasized his firing wasn’t because he had problems – at the time, he had complained only because he had the best interests of the company in mind. Roy also expressed that he does not have financial problems, as in addition to his current job, he will also be participating in an evangelistic film and will be releasing a new album in the near future: “My purpose working at TVB was to gain experience and I only received a few thousand dollars base pay. Now that I left, I’ve actually been able to earn a lot more money, as I’m able to accept more work opportunities.”\n\nSteven Ma terminates contract, does not want to be TVB King\n\nOn November 1st, Steven Ma will be joining the crew for Mainland drama Legend of the Yuan Empire Founder, but before he takes off there are still many issues unsettled. Aside from shooting TVB new series Prosperous Father, he still has to talk to TVB about terminating his contract early. He hopes to settle the issue by next weekend.\n\nThe October 28th Deadline\n\nSteven's TVB contract initially expires in June next year, but because there are issues with the work under TVB management, he wants to terminate his contact early. The issue has been troubling for months now. Earlier TVB executive Virgina Lok questioned if Steven was whining before the TVB Anniversary Awards approaches, which makes people wonder if Steven is really 'fussing' for an award.\n\nYesterday Steven was shooting on the street for Prosperous Father with Linda Chung. Steven clarified he is not terminating his contact because he wants an award and further clarified his position that he doesn't want to be TVB King: \"This morning, I discussed my contract termination with TVB. (What do you want TVB to give you?) Whatever it is, I definitely don't want an award, I don't want any awards. (If TVB shows their sincerity and gives the 'TV King' award to you?) No that's ok!\" Although both sides are on a deadlock, Steven expressed he hopes TVB can give him new direction before October 28th. He laughed: \"This year I don't want TV King, but that does not mean I have no chance to get it!\"\n\nIs Cherrie Ying expecting her first child?\n\nJordan Chan's wife is said to be pregnant and it is believed that the couple has yet to confirm the news due to Chinese superstitions\n\nHong Kong singer Jordan Chan and Cherrie Ying tied the knot in Las Vegas during the Lunar New Year last year, and the pair revealed that they have been busy \"making babies\", after their marriage.\n\nIn May, when it was rumoured that Cherrie was pregnant, the actress wore a midriff-revealing blouse to an event, refuting the report.\n\nAt the press conference for Cherrie and Dong Dawei's new movie Zhui Ai in Beijing yesterday, the actress was absent due to work obligations in Nanning.\n\nDawei, who could not make it to the event, recorded a video message instead. The actor advised his co-star \"not to drink so much alcohol, when you're about to become a mother\".\n\nIt is believed that Cherrie and Dawei tend to frequently drink on set and the latter's advice accidentally revealed news of the actress' pregnancy.\n\nIt is understood that Jordan and Cherrie are both eager to have a child of their own -- due to Jordan's increasing age (he's 44 this year) -- even though they are both constantly apart because of work commitments. The singer eagerly hopes for his wife to get pregnant soon, so as to close the generation gap between him and his future child.\n\nDuring an interview with Jordan in July, the singer revealed that he quit smoking and drinking to further increase their chances of conceiving a baby. In August, a reporter also spotted Cherrie visiting a gynecologist at a hospital in Taiwan.\n\nWhen the actress uploaded her latest imaging for the movie Sacrifice and called herself \"the bloated lady\", netizens began to speculate that Cherrie is pregnant.\n\nAlthough the 28-year-old denied reports about her pregnancy, members of the media believe that the actress may be concealing it for the time being due to Chinese superstitions, which says that one can only announce her pregnancy after her first trimester.\n\nEkin Cheng buys Cecilia Cheung a thank-you meal\n\nThe actor frequently meets up with the actress to repay her for standing up for him many years ago\n\nAccording to the Hong Kong media, Hong Kong actors Ekin Cheng and Cecilia Cheung frequently meet up for meals in Beijing, sparking off dating rumours between the pair.\n\nIt was previously reported that during the press conference for their new movie Dangerous Liaisons, Cecilia and actress Zhang Ziyi shared an awkward moment on stage, when the media probed the pair on rumours of their on-set rivalry.\n\nHowever, it seems that the two actress' fallout stemmed from an incident, which occurred many years ago. Back then, when Ziyi, Cecilia and Ekin were filming The Legend of Zu together, it was rumoured that Ziyi admonished Ekin on set, and Cecilia, who was unable to put up with her attitude, stood by the actor and rebuked her in return.\n\nAfter Cecilia's divorce from her ex-husband Nicholas Tse, the incident was brought up again by the media.\n\nIt was said that a grateful Ekin wanted to reply Cecilia for her actions in 2001 by inviting her out of meals and drinks, since they were both working in Beijing.\n\nEkin was also revealed to have specially applied for leave from the set of his latest drama, to meet the actress.\n\nOn the other hand, Ekin's relationship with girlfriend Yoyo Mung seems to be on shaky ground. The actor let on during a charity event that while he likes children, he had no plans of having one of his own.\n\nHe added that there was no need to discuss such matters with his girlfriend, fuelling speculations of the couple's unstable relationship.\n\nKate Tsui loses voice, Ron Ng help with her lines\n\nThursday October 13, 2011 Hong Kong\n\nSource: Oriental Daily\n\nTranslated by: aZnangel @ http://asianuniverse.net/forums/\n\nWe are seeing less and less TVB FaDans and in reaction to this, TVB executives have already started promoting the second line of FaDans. Kate Tsui was fortunate to be one of the heavily promoted actresses this year. The year hasn't even ended yet and she has already had 5 series broadcast, her exposure rate is over the top. However, behind the success, Kate's health is getting worse by the day.\n\nKate has been a police officer 5 times already, this time in new series Forensic Heroes III, she is finally promoted to OCTB's Senior Inspector. Kate laughed and said the crew would shoot on the mountain top so often, there was a time she thought she was shooting a costume drama instead. However, at the time she was shooting two series simultaneously, so on camera she may look hot, but off cameras, she was suffering from illnesses. Kate said: \"From the start, I already had a waist injury, the doctor said my the disk on my lower backbone was shifting. I didn't even know I had an accident and along with my old injuries, I had to go get acupuncture. It was a very difficult period for me. The makeup room is far from the studio, there was a time I had to crawl my way and with heels on!\"\n\nWhen her condition on the waist was getting better, she falls ill again and gets a hoarse voice. Since she cannot drag on the filming progress, Kate took her hoarse voice with her and continued to shoot. Fortunately her good partner Ron Ng was willing to help her with her lines. She laughed: \"He really is a good buddy. He saw how I had a man voice and getting off tune when I talked, although he did laugh at me, but he still went to discuss with the director about accommodating me, so I don't have to talk as much. So, viewers out there if you happen to catch this part, please forgive me.\"\n\nGaile Lok rumoured to have harmed herself\n\nFresh wounds were spotted on the model's arms after rumours of a marriage meltdown with Leon Lai surfaced\n\nLast month, it was reported that singer Leon Lai's three-year marriage with model Gaile Lok is currently going through a rough patch, because of the couple's 13-year age gap.\n\nTwo weeks ago, when probed if she was moving out of their marital home, the model coyly replied, \"Maybe\", fuelling speculations that her marriage with Leon is on the rocks.\n\nAccording to the Hong Kong media, Leon turned down work obligations in Shanghai last week and immediately returned to Hong Kong to release a statement on the couple's marriage, so as to prevent Gaile from revealing more details on it.\n\nAn insider let on that Gaile did not want a divorce, but merely wanted to let off some steam, because she felt neglected by her busy husband. However, the model was unexpectedly admonished by her husband for her actions, and was hurt by his rebuke.\n\nOn Oct 7, at around 4pm, Gaile was spotted shopping, without any makeup on and looked listless. Reporters also spotted a pink, round-shaped burnt wound on the back of her left hand. Judging from the appearance and colour of the wound, many believed it to be a recent injury.\n\nAccording to Gaile's friend, the model is \"very extreme\" when it comes to dealing with her personal relationships. She suffered several emotional breakdowns and will turn to alcohol or other methods to numb her pain; even inflicting physical harm on her own body.\n\nIn 2006, five red cuts were spotted on Gaile's arms after the model was caught bringing another man home, when Leon was filming a movie in Shanghai. Back then, it was speculated that the model slashed her wrists in order to gain Leon's sympathy and save her relationship.\n\nThis time, Leon reportedly issued his wife a gag order, after news of the couple's marriage breakdown surfaced. The singer was also said to have prohibited his wife from visiting the nightclubs.\n\nGaile will have to be home by 9pm on days with zero work obligations. It is also reported that she is forbidden from spending the night at her friend's place anymore.\n\nLinda Chung sacrifices her looks, turns into a Mongkok Homeless\n\nSaturday October 8, 2011 Hong Kong\n\nSource: Mingpao\n\nTranslated by: aZnangel @ http://asianuniverse.net/forums/\n\nLast year, the stylish homeless Ningbo wanderer nicknamed 'Sai Lei Gor' (犀利哥) became a hot topic for a short period. Recently, there was suddenly a 'Sai Lei Jeh' (犀利姐) that appeared in Mong Kok, who attracted a large group of onlookers. Little did we know, this Sai Lei Jeh's true identity was in fact Linda Chung. She had layers upon layers of dirty and sloppy clothing on, was covered with plastic water bottles and had very messy hair. It turns out Linda was just shooting for TVB new series Prosperous Father. Netizens compared her with 'Sai Lei Gor' and praised they were a perfect couple.\n\nIn Prosperous Father, Linda plays a tough policewoman and has had several crazy and comical scenes, that made the shooting process really fun for her. Her costumes also changes all the time. Just when Netizens thought she wouldn't sacrifice her 'looks', Linda turned herself into a Sai Lei Jeh. The other day, she was shooting with Steven Ma in Mong Kok, where many onlookers and fans didn't recognize her at first. What a big surprise!\n\nLinda's 'Sai Lei Jeh' costume was comparable to 'Sai Lei Gor', very hot! Her fluffy hairstyle accompanied by a red hat, cheeks covered in dirt, black teeth, layers upon layers of rugged clothing, and 3 plastic water bottles hanging, made her look extremely ugly. The scene required her to kneel on the ground and write \"gossips are fearful\". She appeared respectful and won praises from fans. The photo was also uploaded to Weibo.\n\nA fan compared her photo with 'Sai Lei Gor', Linda saw it and made a funny response: \"The perfect couple, haha!\" Thousands of fans gave her a warm response, teasing that she's filthier than Sai Lei Gor, but very interesting and cute. The two are a perfect match. There were also fans that couldn't accept their Goddess turning into such mess and greatly sighed this was a huge sacrifice.\n\nPrince Charming Leo Ku gives his Princess Jessica C. a kiss live on stage\n\nSaturday October 8, 2011 Hong Kong\n\nSource: Mingpao\n\nTranslated by: aZnangel @ http://asianuniverse.net/forums/\n\nThe first of three shows to Leo Ku's AMAZING WORLD CONCERT 2011 kicked off last night at Hong Kong Coliseum. It was a very heated atmosphere. Leo appeared like a Prince Charming and was fortunate to have invited 'alarm chest' Jessica C. as his guest performer. Jessica C. was dressed in a low-cut white dress, looking very sexy. She was like Leo's girlfriend as she was by his side the entire night. The two often looked at each other with deep emotions and eventually kissed live on stage. Everyone in HK Coliseum screamed in excitement! Leo laughed: \"Let's all give a strong round of applause for my Princess tonight, Jessica C. (JC)! We just had our Prince and Princess kiss, just like a fairytale, no need to be that surprised!\"\n\nJessica C. bad Cantonese\n\nLeo blurted out that he has to teach JC Cantonese. He used the statement: \"Dancing so much that my legs are extremely swollen!\" to tease her. JC's limited Cantonese turned 'extreme swollen' to 'alarm bell' (TN: Same sound in Cantonese -- 'ging jung'). It was a very comical scene! Aside from JC, Leo also invited Dennie Wong to accompany his Love and Honest performance via the piano.\n\nImitates Leslie Cheung & Aaron Kwok's hot dancing\n\nThis time at the concert, Leo did not only publicly kiss JC, but he also appeared in a sleeveless shirt and showed off his muscles. He danced and sang on stage, performing Explode and his 9 minute Party King. For this performance, he imitated Aaron Kwok and Leslie Cheung's original songs and dance steps. After the dancing, Leo suddenly had something to express: \"If 2012 is really dooms day, we only have a year remaining and I haven't done anything. I have to hurry and have some accomplishments.\" At this time, Fans shouted that he should get married. Leo said: \"I am not talking about marriage, you all rarely see me dance, this time I am doing a 9 minute long dance. I fear I won't have the chance because it's almost 2012! During rehearsal, some fans said I should take it slowly and sing romantic songs because of my waist injury, they were OK and will accept it, but I am not just an OK person, if I have the ability, I will do as much as I can! There were also fans who said if I have to follow Aaron Kwok's dances, then why do it? I love Aaron's dance steps myself, but I hope when you all watch me dance, you can see my hard efforts!\"\n\nWhen speaking of this, Leo suddenly teared up, he said: \"I may not be those types that have natural talent, but I will put in all the effort that I can and hope every time I am on stage, I can let everyone see me at my best.\" Then Leo performed Honor Us All, but for a brief moment he couldn't get his voice out and had his manager, Mani Fok, hand him a tissue and give him a hug. At the end of the concert, Leo was thanking a list of people, and the audience shouted rumored girlfriend Lorraine's name. Leo pretended he couldn't hear and was only willing to thank his fans.\n\nOriental Daily Interview with Bowie Lam: Better than simply ‘digging gold’ up North (Part 4)\n\nAfter winning the Asia TV King award, Bowie Lam, who left TVB this past May, has been heavily sought after by Mainland production companies. Rumored to be making 18 million yuan, Bowie revealed that his target is not just the Mainland, but rather all of Asia. Recently, he was also invited to participate in a Japanese TV drama as male lead – looks like he has opportunities that are better than simply ‘digging gold’ up North (Mainland)!\n\n** The following are Bowie’s words as recorded by the reporter:\n\nWhen my contract with TVB expired in May, I actually did not have any target whatsoever with where I wanted to go – all I knew was that even in places as far off as Urumqi and Harbin [TN: both in China], people knew who I was. Therefore, I wanted to venture out and see what other options existed. Not long after my contract expired, a Mainland investor wanted to sign me right away, but I did not go for it. Even though I was anxious to get back to work, I had a clearer goal in mind. I thought to myself that I couldn’t just be worth 18 million yuan – doing a few commercials and live performances already surpasses that amount! Even if they were to give me lots of money, if I had to film bad series, how many years would that last? Three times 18 million yuan is barely 60 million yuan – definitely not enough to last an entire lifetime!\n\nMore than one opportunity\n\nTurns out that later on, I was given more and more opportunities. At the same time that I received a very very good script from a company in the Mainland, I also received an invitation from Fuji Television in Japan to film the series <> (六個陌生人). I felt that this series was a perfect opportunity, practically made for me -- even the Mainland production company agreed, so of course, which option was I going to choose? Later, the Mainland company told me that they would clean up their script a bit and wait for me.\n\nRight now, Bowie Lam isn’t just heading up North, but rather the sights are set on Asia as a whole. The series I will be filming for Fuji Television is a collaboration with Karasawa Toshiaki and other popular artists – it will be filmed using the method of a high definition movie and will air in both Japan as well as Korea. I will be playing the role of the group leader and it is first male lead – definitely makes more of a ‘splash’ than heading up North!\n\nNo intentions to become singer again\n\nThough there is an imminent battle between the TV stations in HK, which will allow for more artistic freedom, I actually feel it is necessary to look farther out and take things to a higher level. In the future, my goal is to film 3 series every 2 years, with 1 of the series being an HK production – but that series must have a good script.\n\nAs far as re-entering the music industry, to be honest, I never really thought about it. If you ask me to perform for a live show or sing at an event for 45 minutes, I’ll definitely throw myself into it – just treat it like a concert. But if you ask me to become a singer again, I would be hesitant, as I don’t like memorizing song lyrics for some reason – even I don’t understand why!\n\nKevin Cheng Makes More Than $160K Per Episode\n\nSource: Mingpao\n\nTranslated by: sparkles_n15 @ asianfanatics.net\n\nThe cast of Ghetto Justice 2 held an official ceremony yesterday to celebrate the start of filming for the new series. Actors Kevin Cheng, Myolie Wu and Stephen Huynh all attended the ceremony. Kevin had just returned to Hong Kong after making a stage appearance in Toronto. Earlier it was reported that he was making over $160,000 RMB per episode filming in China. Even Myolie Wu couldn't resist asking him to treat her for a meal. Kevin reveals that the amount is actually more than that.\n\nWith recent movements between different TV stations, many people are speculating that Kevin is a well sought-after artiste. Kevin says, \"You can't put it like that. I've always supported TVB, but I can't control whether or not my series will air on other TV channels.\" Kevin says he never received a call from Ricky Wong. He still has a long contract ahead. He also doesn't have any problems with his current management because TVB gives him opportunities to film in Mainland.\n\nA new producer will be taking charge of Ghetto Justice 2. Is Kevin worried it would affect the series? \"The producer directed the first series, so he's already familiar with the story.\" When asked whether he heard that Ricky Wong plans to film a movie version? \"If it's true, then it's definitely good news. However, if he really intends to film it, I hope he'll announce it soon.\" As Kevin has had to shave his head for his previous series, there was a rumour that he's been using hair growth stimulants. Kevin clarifies, \"I've never used any. I'm just a spokesperson for a hair products company.\"\n\nMyolie was asked whether she was jealous of Kevin's per-episode fees? Myolie says, \"I'm not cheap either, but I won't say the amount because it might scare people. It's really good for what you pay for!\" Myolie says that artistes under contract have a fixed salary. She says she was happy to learn that many behind the scenes personnel have received a pay raise. She's glad to continue working with the same people. Would it be okay if you got an award instead of a pay raise? Myolie laughs and says, \"I don't know. But I have confidence in myself this year.\"\n\nJackie Chan encounters danger to play revolutionary\n\nTo commemorate the 100th anniversary of the Xinhai Revolution, the film 1911 came to life. The film not only described key figure and Father of the Nation Dr. Sun Yat-Sen, Revolutionary martyrs Huang Xing and Xu Zonghan's romance gave the audience further understanding of love in a revolution. Jackie Chan and Li Bingbing played these historical figures for the first time and both admitted that they suffered. Bingbing had to shoot in the battle trenches that were made from coal pits and had her fill of sandstorm. Jackie Chan even said that the shoot made his urine turn black. He joked that if the shoot kept going he would have died from inhaling too much coal.\n\n1911's three leads Jackie Chan, Li Bingbing and Winston Chao (Chiu Man Suen) earlier came to promote the film in Hong Kong. Li Bingbing in the film played female revolutionary martyr Xu Zonghan, a heroine at the end of the Qing Dynasty. Bingbing honestly said that she did not have much understanding of this character but knew that Xu back then was married to someone else. Later she fell in love with Huang Xing and developed her revolutionary career, she could be considered ahead of her time. Bingbing said, \"Xu came from a wealthy family and was a lady. She spent her family's money on the women liberation movement, she was a new school heroine of the Xinhai Revolution!\"\n\nIn history, Xu Zonghan participated in the Revolution as a nurse. Bingbing in the film did not need to play pretty. Most of the time she had no make up. On the other hand her battle trench scene was bitter beyond words. She said, \"Although this time most were ensemble scenes, I had many scenes and suffered too!\" She revealed that because they shot in a Shenyang coal pit, she had to wear a nurse hat in a two meter wide battle trench during an explosion scene. With all the schrapel and the dust, the wind machine covered her entire body with coal. When she opened her mouth to breathe all she got was sand. However, her co-star Big Brother Jackie Chan in the film also had to be in the battle trench. Big Brother who has been through many fight scenes did not have an easy time either. He said, \"I worked until my urine was black too. At the time if I kept going I would've died very soon, because all the coal would have turned into stones in the lung. In addition the location had a lot of\n\ndust and explosion everywhere!\"\n\nBig Brother admitted that this was the first time that he played a historical figure. He joked that playing a general was a lot of fun. \"Under Huang Xing were all young men between the ages of 16 to 24, during the character I was in character too! Xu Zonghan was a widow and had to carry bullets to help out, these few were the people who brought an end to the Qing Dynasty!\" Bingbing also said that the Huang Xing and Xu Zonghan romance was very romantic. She said, \"Xu Zongha spent her life taking care of and supporting Huang Xing. She also took him to Hong Kong's Queen Mary Hospital to treat his finger, which told that this person aside from the Revolution also had humanity and real feelings.\" Jackie Chan revealed that to be even more in character, he thought about gaining weight to be closer to the real Huang Xing. He said, \"During the shoot I only gained three pounds. I once planned to add a belly, but because later I would\n\nhave to work on CHINESE ZODIAC I didn't dare to.\"\n\nIn addition, Li Bingbing stressed that this film absolutely had the strength to break 200 million RMB at the Mainland box office. She said, \"Now the times are changing. FOUNDING OF A REPUBLIC made several hundred million, so 1911 can make 200 million!\" Big Brother also felt that this year happened to be the Xinhai Revolution's 100th anniversary, breaking the 200 million RMB box office in the Mainland should not be a big problem.\n\nhttp://hktopten.blogspot.com"
