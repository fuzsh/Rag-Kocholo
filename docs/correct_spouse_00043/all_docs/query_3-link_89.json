When she made her debut, some Hong Kong entertainment information magazines had compared her likeness to that of Shu Qi, a Taiwanese actress.\n\nAs of 2006, Gaile was dating Leon Lai, a Hong Kong actor and singer. With this relationship, she became a target of paparazzi and the media. In 2006, a magazine published an article and intimate photographs of her with Leon Lai at the latter's residence, prompting the Hong Kong Actors Guild to protest \"irresponsibility\" on the part of the magazine.\n\nIn 2009, she and Lai were secretly married in Las Vegas at the Wynn Hotel, with his manager and assistant acting as witnesses.\n\nOn 3 October 2012 the couple had announced the end of their four-year marriage. The couple's joint statement stated that there were \"different philosophies in life\" which caused the divorce. Leon Lai's manager stated that there was not a third party that lead the couple to divorce."
