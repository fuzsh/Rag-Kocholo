        "text": "45 year old Leon Lai was dating 32 year old Gaile Lok, 15 years his junior, for five years before it was exposed in 2008 that they were secretly married in the US. Since October of last year, there were constant rumors that they were changes in their marriage. Recently the divorce rumors were getting more and more intense. The last straw was a few days ago, Gaile was photographed on a date in the Bali islands with her close friend from New Zealand (Cuz). There were also bed photos that leaked in which Gaile was seen in her underwear. Yesterday the reports dug up Leon's old rumors with Liu Yifei and Zhang Ziyi. It was also rumored Gaile was upset that Leon kept intervening with her personal life and her work. It was said their separation was mainly due to Leon's traditional beliefs. Gaile, on the other hand, grew up in the US and is used to having more freedom, therefore there were a lot of contradictions in their relationship.\n\nWhether the rumors are true or not, [Oriental Daily] discovered Leon and Gaile have officially filed for divorce. This relationship couldn't get pass 'The 7 Year Itch'. Lately, Gaile and Leon have been busy working separately, and after negotiations, they finally break the silence.\n\nYesterday Leon and Gaile released a written statement through their shared management \"Paciwood Music & Entertainment LTD\" announcing that they are officially getting a divorce. However, they used the words \"break up\" to replace \"divorce\".\n\nQUOTE\n\n\"Although they have experienced a lot of happy times together and still care for one another, both parties have very different life philosophies which resulted in serious disagreements, so after careful consideration, both parties have decided to part ways.\n\n\"Hopefully, the public can give them both some personal space in these tough times, so they can embrace their new lives as soon as possible, and continue to focus on their work,\" said Paciwood Music and Entertainment Ltd in its statement.\n\n\"On behalf of Ms Gaile Lok and Mr Leon Lai, we would like to express our sincere gratitude to the media for their support and concern.\" (Source: channelnewasia.com)\n\nGaile's manager (Mr. Chan) expressed he felt its such a pity that the two separated, he said: \"Rumors going on and on is meaningless now. Although this isn't a happy incident, it is their privacy. I don't want caring friends of Leon Lai and Ms. Lok to have too much speculation. We got their consent before releasing the statement. (When was the divorce decided?) Within the last two days.\" Mr. Chan expressed as their manager and friend, he doesn't hope to see them divorce, but will respect their decision. He said gratefully: \"I am very familiar with both of them, they are very civilized people and can face anything calmly without anger.\" When asked if he has contacted Leon or Gaile? He said: \"They have, after discussions, they contacted me separately. I hope they'll be happy in the future.\"\n\nWhen asked of Leon and Gaile's whereabouts? He said Leon isn't in Beijing: \"He's working at another place now. (When will he be back?) Very soon because we have a meeting.\" As for Gaile, earlier she told him she would be going to Bali and then to Australia to handle some personal matters.\n\nAs for the true reason for Leon and Gaile's separation? He repeated what was said on the statement: \"Differences in their philosophy of life.\" He also does not believe there was a third party in the relationship: \"What the eye sees may not be the truth. Also I didn't see or hear it. I don't think there is a third party.\"\n\nGaile responded to the news in English through Whatsapp: \"All I can say is..We already separated a long time ago.. It was very hard to have to lie to everyone and keep secret from friends and outside people. I'm apologize to media and public for that.. I wish Leon happiness and he will always be family to me.. I will remain with Paciwood and Joe as my manager..\""
