        "text": "The figures say it all. Faye Wong, despite her nonchalance about her popularity, is definitely the hottest singer in Hong Kong today.\n\nWith her contract with Cinepoly expiring this December, several record companies have been enticing her with attractive offers - up to the tune of about $14.4 million. But the Cantopop queen, who is sticking to her guns about not doing any promotional activities, has yet to accept any of them.\n\nAnita Mui, who ruled the Cantonese music scene in the ‘80s, pales by comparison. Her contract is worth only about $3.6 million now.\n\nEven Hong Kong Heavenly Kings Jacky Cheung, Andy Lau, Aaron Kwok, and Leon Lai have a lot of catching up to do. Cheung, the hottest of the four, commands only about $7.2 million.\n\nLooks like Wong has shaken up the previously male-dominated Chinese entertainment industry quite a bit.\n\n——————————————————————\n\nSOURCE: THE STRAITS TIMES\n\nFaye Wong off stage is generous and takes good care of those around her.\n\nby Miss Wei\n\nWhen Faye Wong was at the height of her popularity, only I and another entertainment reporter could directly ask her managers, Katie Chan and Chiu Li-Kwan (Sister Kwan), for information about her and she was never wary of us two reporters.\n\nI wrote a lot of articles and concert reports on Faye Wong back in the day.\n\nAnd I was most impressed by a post-80s [born] manager from the Mainland. Once, I sent a private message on Weibo to him to ask about an artist’s scandal. He replied in less than a minute and told me: “Miss Wei, do you know what? I am a fan who grew up watching you write about my idol, Faye Wong, and I couldn’t imagine that you would ask me for a response. In my mind, you are god-level.” I laughed and said “god-level reporter” is still a reporter, and getting news is the most important thing!\n\nThere was a period of time when Faye loved to play big two [deuces], and our staff members played with her. She is very smart, so she often won. Although she would return the money to us after winning the bet. Once she said to me in a very serious tone: “You’d better not play big two with other people, you’ll definitely lose your hand.”\n\nAnother time she heard that a newspaper in Hong Kong laid off an entertainment reporter, she asked me urgently: “Have you been affected? Is there anything I can do to help?” Actually, I had already left that newspaper a long time ago, but she didn’t know which newspaper I worked for. She only remembered that I was a reporter and came to me to show her concern.\n\nFaye Wong has a cool appearance, but she has a warm heart. Even after giving birth to Dou Jingtong, she did not live in a mansion. She lived in Sister Kwan’s home on Waterloo Road in Hong Kong because it was convenient. Her straightforward nature also allowed me to witness Dou Wei, Nicholas Tse, and Li Yapeng by her side. At this moment, I hope that she is truly happy!\n\n——————————————————————\n\nSOURCE: AM730 HONG KONG // TRANSLATED BY: FAYE WONG FUZAO\n\nFrom the moment Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor set eyes on each other on the set of Cleopatra in 1962, they were infatuated. The two fell in love quickly and furiously. But as difficult as it was to live apart, they couldn’t live together either. The couple were married and divorced twice.\n\nStill, for Taylor, Burton remained her true love: “I was a fool to marry so often (she had six other ex-husbands),” she told the Telegraph. “If I had my time over again, I would never do that. The truth is I now don’t give a damn about most of those men. Richard is the only one I truly loved and still care about.”\n\nLike Burton and Taylor, China’s Faye Wong, 45, and Nicholas Tse, 34, can’t seem to stay away from each other for long. Ten years after the two first broke up they are rumoured to have rekindled their relationship.\n\nAfter their first split, Tse went on to marry Hong Kong actress Cecilia Cheung in 2006 and have two sons, but they divorced in 2011. Wong, too, married the actor Li Yapeng in 2005. But they got divorced last year too (it was her second split with a husband).\n\nNews that Wong and Tse could be rekindling their romance became a red hot topic on China’s blogosphere, surpassing news about Alibaba’s mega-IPO, tennis star Li Na’s retirement, and Scotland’s referendum. As of this week, there were 450 million tweets and reposts about the rumoured relationship on Sina Weibo.\n\nNetizens were split in their views about the couple. Some were supportive of the relationship. Others blasted their chaotic love lives, claiming the two were showing little consideration for their children. Some voiced strong disapproval of Wong, saying that a mother of two romancing a man more than a decade younger is irresponsible and selfish.\n\n“It’s such a mess. Why didn’t they marry each other in the beginning?” asked one netizen.\n\nOther netizens expressed sympathy for their former spouses, saying that Tse shouldn’t abandon his ex-wife Cheung. “You rejected a perfectly good wife and two beautiful children to be with a woman who is not only 11 years older but has married twice previously and has two children of her own. This is nauseating. Two people who are so irresponsible certainly deserve each other,” she lambasted.\n\nAmid the growing criticism, some returned to the fray to defend the couple. “Both of them are single, so what’s wrong with them getting back together?” one fan wrote.\n\n“Instead of criticising Wong Faye I actually admire her more and more. More than 10 years ago, she didn’t care what people thought and held the hand of a man who was only 23. Today, she still doesn’t care what other people think… She’s always so honest and true to herself,” was another verdict.\n\nMore perceptive netizens said that the negative comments about Wong have a subtext – they are another example of China’s cultural stereotyping of women, in this case a belief that stretches back through the centuries that an older woman should not marry a younger spouse.\n\n“All the criticisms against Faye Wong mostly surround the fact that she was married and divorced twice, a mother of two yet dating a man who is 11 years younger. This suggests that women in China are still being typecast for two roles: wife and mother. But people are oblivious of women’s wish for self-improvement and their pursuit for love,” one netizen mused.\n\n——————————————————————\n\nSOURCE: WEEK IN CHINA\n\nDebate sparked over rising divorce rate as celebrity couple end marriage\n\nThe Singapore audience sat in stunned silence as the lights came up, signalling the concert had ended. After finishing a song, Faye Wong had simply left the stage, deciding she was done for the evening. “ ‘Thank you. Goodbye,’ is not difficult to say” commented a Singaporean blogger who attended the 2011 show. But the blogger recalls that Wong said nothing as she walked off. “We wrongly thought she’d gone for another costume change.” Instead, the audience realised that the gig was over.\n\nBlindsiding her fans is nothing new for the Chinese pop diva. In fact, it’s been something of a Wong speciality. Some singers feed off audience applause. Not Faye. She regularly refuses to indulge in encores or waste much effort talking to fans during concerts. Or say goodbye as she departs the stage.\n\nIn the mid-1990s Wong’s manager even admitted to TIME magazine: “Faye does whatever she wants. It’s really quite a miracle that she became a success.”\n\nBut Wong – who has released 19 albums and starred in six films – has become a modern Chinese icon, coming out of self-imposed retirement to stage a comeback tour in 2010 that earned Rmb200 million ($32.66 million) in China alone.\n\nWong was back in the news last weekend for reasons that had nothing to do with her singing. In a reflection of her enduring celebrity, the 44 year-old provoked a wave of media interest when she announced on her weibo that she was divorcing her second husband Li Yapeng, whom she married in 2005.\n\n“Our affinity and connection as a husband and wife in this life has come to an end,” Wong wrote enigmatically.\n\nHer husband – who will get custody of their daughter – responded on his own weibo: “What I want is a family, but you are destined to be a legend.”\n\nAfter the postings on Friday night, over 100 journalists staked out Beijing’s airport where Wong was due to arrive and then chased her car back to the city. Over the weekend, Wong’s break-up message was forwarded more than 760,000 times on weibo, making it easily the most popular topic.\n\nMedia explanation for the split were varied. Tencent Entertainment speculated that Wong had wanted her husband to become, like her, a Buddhist. Apple Daily thought the mood was a lot less spiritual and that tensions were high because Li’s failed investments had reduced Wong’s net worth (estimated at $85 million at the time of their marriage).\n\nBut as the speculation began to insinuate a lover might be involved, Wong took to her weibo yet again, this time less enigmatically. On Wednesday she denied either was having an affair, nor that money or Buddhism were factors. She said it was her decision and “we separated peacefully”.\n\nHowever, as the China Daily reported, the parting of the two celebrities also sparked a broader debate about China’s rising rates of divorce. Over three million couples divorced last year, according to the Ministry of Civil Affairs.\n\nIn a country where divorce was once almost unknown and carried a social stigma, the sudden surge in marital breakdowns has some sociologists nervous. “I am not joking that our society will disintegrate if the family dissolves. Problems within the family are the fundamental cause of many social problems. Divorce not only affects the lives, work and families of the people concerned, it also affects their children’s upbringing,” Shu Xin, head of the China Marriage and Family Counselling Centre, said on Sunday.\n\nLi Yinhe, another sociologist, said China’s divorce rate had rocketed from around 2% in the 1970s to more than 20% today and said the country’s dramatic transformation from a rural to urban society was one of the key reasons.\n\nAn editorial in the Global Times noted that attitudinal change partly explained the phenomenon too. “Fewer young Chinese would compromise their own happiness for an unsatisfactory marriage simply to avoid losing face or embarrassing their parents,” it noted.\n\nLi, who is a professor with the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said more infidelity was another important factor for the explosion in divorces. Financial difficulties and disagreements over parenting are cited as key factors too.\n\nAs for Wong’s fans, there were hopes that the soon-to-be single again singer might go back to the recording studio and cut her first new album since 2003.\n\nMore bizarrely, news about the break-up has piqued investor interest, as netizens wonder if the Wong divorce might pave the way for a new bull market in China’s A-shares. That’s because when Wong married her first husband in July 1996, the stock index began a steady climb from 753 to 2,245 points. When she married again in July 2005, it rose from 988 to 6,124. The thinking, reports Eastmoney, is that it might be time to get back into the market if Wong ever marries again…\n\n——————————————————————\n\nSOURCE: WEEK IN CHINA\n\nby Chris Luo\n\nCelebrity couple Faye Wong and Li Yapeng divorced last week after eight years of marriage.\n\nMany Chinese internet users are angry about the way the mainland media reacted following the announcement last Friday that singer Faye Wong divorced her second husband, Li Yapeng.\n\nThe divorce announcement generated enormous interest in China, but also sparked some tasteless headlines and comments in sections of the mainland media.\n\nSome papers treated the news frivolously. “Faye Wong divorces, Arsenal F.C. one step closer to take the crown,” a headline in the Oriental Sports Daily said - as if suggesting a link between the performance of England Premier League’s football club and Wong’s marital status.\n\n“Arsenal F.C. last crowned the Premier League in 2004, but came short a year later - around the same time when Faye Wong married Li Yapeng…Arsenal has not won the league’s champion ever since,” the article said. “It seems the club is finally on the right track after her divorce.”\n\nThe Chengdu Business Daily reported that Wong’s two marriages, in 1996 and 2005, had also coincided with rises, during those years, in Shanghai’s stock market.\n\n“Do you wonder when the next bull market is? Let’s look forward to Wong’s next marriage to find out,” the report said.\n\nSome netizens also said they disapproved of media reports exploiting the singer’s marital problems just to get attention. Some called the reports shallow and insensitive.\n\n“How can you relate a celebrity’s private life to serious matters such as the stock market,” said one comment on internet news portal Sina.com.cn.\n\nAnother, responding to rumours that Wong might become a nun, said: “So will there be no bull market ever again if she does not marry in future?”\n\nBut it was behaviour of journalists working for one of China’s top news portals, Tencent, which angered netizens the most. The news portal’s journalists admitted blocking Wong’s car when she was returning from the airport. They did not move their car until they had snapped photographs of Wong “with tears in her eyes”.\n\nThe Tencent journalists’ tactics were widely condemned as “abusive reporting”. Many noted that such aggressive tactics could be dangerous, recalling the ways photographers had pursued Diana, Princess of Wales, before her fatal car crash in Paris on August 31, 1997,\n\nTencent’s entertainment news division issued an apology on its official microblog account on Saturday. It admitted it had been wrong to “intercept and excessively photograph” Wong.\n\nChen Qifeng, a communications professor at Tsinghua University’s journalism school, told the Xinhua news service that stricter privacy laws were needed to protect celebrities.\n\n——————————————————————\n\nSOURCE: SOUTH CHINA MORNING POST\n\nAfter 15 years, this diva is still rising\n\nby Elisa Chia\n\nWhen a pop star’s “crossover ceremony” (jumping from one record label to another) happens aboard a luxurious ocean liner - with dramatic fireworks display as the backdrop, no less - it’s a telling sign that this is not just any other music idol.\n\nFaye Wong had just that when she inked her contract with Sony Music 16 months ago in Hong Kong. She is, for want of a better description, a super-diva.\n\nThe 34-year-old - known for her fashion eccentricities and icy cool persona - will zip into town on Sunday to promote her Chinese album, It’s My Style, as well as plug her movie, Leaving Me, Loving You.\n\nAnd fans are ecstatic.\n\n“Faye is my dream goddess,” a fan by the name of James gushed in his entry to Today. He hopes to be one of the five who’d be granted a personal audience with Faye. “An autograph and a picture will make my dream come true. Imagine how a mere mortal feels when he or she is allowed to stand beside a goddess.”\n\nIndeed, 15 years on in showbiz, the Faye fever still burns. But whether the Beijing-born Hong Kong-based star has reached a peak in her singing career is debatable.\n\n“She started out with mainstream music and then went on to experiment with various alternative styles,” said long-time fan Karan Seah. “In the latest album, it’s just a mix of both. I don’t see her surpassing that level of creativity that would wow audiences again.”\n\nBut Karan added that she doesn’t see Faye’s popularity waning in the near future.\n\nTan Li Yi, a DJ at MediaCorp Radio’s YES 93.3 FM, agreed.\n\n“It’s not over for Faye, as yet. Musically, she has just moved into another phase. Her songs used to cater to the masses, such as Sky and I’m Willing. But now she conveys her individualism through her songs.”\n\nThe experienced DJ must be speaking the mind of the award-winning diva.\n\nIn an interview with Hong Kong’s South China Morning Post, Faye, who draws influences from The Cocteau Twins, The Cranberries, Sinéad O'Connor, Bjork, and Teresa Teng, acknowledged: “My taste in music is too off-mainstream and only a few people appreciate that… I know what the masses like and I know they skip my compositions and listen to the commercial tracks.\n\n\"I have too many business partners and I must consider their interests as well. I’m more mature now and I strike a balance between my personal interests and commercial value.”\n\nStill, facts and figures say it best. As Paul Khor, a marketing director of Sony Music, pointed out: Two of her new songs, To Love and Carousel, have already hit No. 1 on the music chart of YES 93.3 FM. And the album is doing really well, all over Asia as well… Every magazine’s dying to put her on their cover.\n\nFaye also just competed eight sell-out concerts in Hong Kong, he added.\n\n‘Nuff said.\n\nCOME FACE TO FAYE\n\nFaye Wong will be signing her CD, It’s My Style, on Sunday at 5:30pm at Plaza Singapura. Fayenatic fans can catch another glimpse of her when she appears with actor Leon Lai at Bishan Junction 8 on Monday to promote their film, Leaving Me, Loving You.\n\nTHE FAYE CHART\n\n1987: Faye and parents moved to Hong Kong from Beijing\n\n1989: Launched her debut album, Shirley Wong, a stage name she used then. Won a female newcomer (bronze) award by Hong Kong’s Commercial Radio.\n\n1991: Took a one-year hiatus in New York to study music.\n\n1992: Released her album, Coming Home, which became her first platinum record\n\n1994: Used her real name Wong Fei (aka Faye Wong). Made her acting debut in Chungking Express.\n\n1996: Married Beijing rocker Dou Wei\n\n1997: Gave birth to daughter Dou Jing-tong\n\n1999: Divorced Dou Wei. Lost her temper when a local journalist asked her about it. Faye snapped at him: “None of your business!” and stormed off in a huff.\n\n2000: Walked out of a private function hand-in-hand with Cantopop bad boy Nicholas Tse, 11 years her junior\n\n2001: Took a two-year break from the music scene. Starred in her first Japanese television serial, Love From A Lie\n\n2002: Came back with a bang!\n\n2004: ?\n\n——————————————————————\n\nSOURCE: TODAY\n\n-excerpts -\n\n“I wrote a song in my new album called \"Child”. I wrote the music and lyrics. I wrote this song for Tong Tong. Inspiration comes from every part of life. The so-called pain, I think, comes from creating when there is a lack of inspiration. When there is inspiration to create, it is a very happy experience.“\n\n\"Actually, the look for this new album is relatively fresh and natural, and I didn’t do any deliberate styling. The shoulder-length hair and sheer makeup are my original appearance. I don’t set any preconceived limits about the styling in advance.”\n\n“I’ve never actually pre-determined what style I’m going for or how I’m going to sing. I just interpret each song in my own way.”\n\n“I didn’t say that I wouldn’t record Cantonese songs anymore. But now it is mainly Mandarin songs and the proportion of Cantonese songs recorded is relatively small. This Mandarin album \"Sing & Play” contains a complete set of ten Mandarin songs. The other three are Cantonese songs. The record company’s method is to make the new album into a papercase CD and a hardcover CD, and the hardcover version has these three Cantonese songs added, and Taiwanese listeners can also hear it.“\n\n\"Listening to music is a very common thing for me, just like sleeping. There are different styles of music, I actually quite like them all, and I don’t try to set limits on what music I must listen to.”\n\n“I never think about the market. I think as long as you do your own thing well, it’s not a bad thing to have more people from different countries and different people appreciate it. Opening up more markets is not my aim or goal.”\n\n“Whether I’m arrogant or not, these are the comments of the public on me. I don’t think I am a very arrogant person. Just looking at the reports and comments on me by the public and media, I think there are many things they don’t know. But regarding their treatment of me, I am not very concerned about the misconceptions that the public has about me, and I don’t think anyone can ask the whole world to understand them.”\n\n——————————————————————\n\nSOURCE: PLAY MAGAZINE // TRANSLATED BY: FAYE WONG FUZAO\n\nFaye Wong. Period.\n\nThat was Zing’s answer to who he likes doing make-up for.\n\nIt wasn’t ‘period’, really.\n\n“Faye Wong, Faye Wong, Faye Wong,” he gushed, again like one smitten.\n\nUnbelievable. The ice-cold singer who loves swatting away the press like flies?\n\n“Photographers and stylists here all think she is unsurpassable, for lack of a better word, that body, that grace…”\n\nZing “testifies” that Faye, unlike her hostile public image, is really “shy”.\n\n“Like she said, for every amount of confidence, there is an equal amount of inferiority complex. She is very sweet and easy to get along with,” he said.\n\nHuh, come again?\n\n“She is not difficult to work with, she sits very still and is willing to try anything. Instead it’s the people around her who will scurry about and say 'stop’ when I propose, say, red eye-shadow or something.\n\n\"Believe me, no one who has worked for her has had to bear any tantrums or temper from her. Did you know that, when she goes home to Beijing, she would take a bus and walk 20 minutes to a restaurant?”\n\nSo, there we have it.\n\nBelieve it or not, Faye Wong’s brighter side.\n\nFrom someone who brightens her face.\n\nWho would have thought?\n\nTHE TEARDROP\n\nZing on Faye Wong’s 'teardrop’ during her Hong Kong Concert: “I put silver glitter tears so they look like they are moving down. She can be happy or sad. I think tears look pretty on a girl.\n\n\"I was overwhelmed the first time I saw her. She is absolutely beautiful.”\n\n——————————————————————\n\nSOURCE: THE NEW PAPER\n\nFaye Wong gets connected to handphone advertising\n\nJacky Cheung’s done it. Chow Yun Fat’s done it. Leon Lai, Aaron Kwok, and anybody who is anybody in the Hong Kong entertainment scene must do it.\n\nNow, Faye Wong - who has always tried to go against anything commercial or mainstream - has jumped onto the speedboat that is taking Hong Kong celebrities to the fast-growing island of handphone-advertising.\n\nThe other reason why Faye is such a surprise is perhaps that, well, with how she has been communicating to her fans and the media, she is the last person you expect to be touting telecommunication equipment.\n\nBut the China-born singer, who became a mother less than a year ago, seems to know what she is doing.\n\nShe knows she is in trusty hands.\n\nThe man who is making the ad is - renowned alternative Hong Kong director Wong Kar Wai, who directed Faye’s one and only movie, Chungking Express (1995)\n\nIt is also the director’s first TV commercial.\n\nWong is not worried that doing something with mass appeal will clash with his reputation.\n\n“I think as long as the end product looks good, it’s okay,” he told Hong Kong magazine City Entertainment.\n\nIndeed, the 30-second ad is not unlike his movies.\n\nIt will probably be the darkest and most surreal phone ad the Hong Kong TV audience has ever seen - with Faye running around in snow, playing video arcade games, etc.\n\nOn working with the star again, Wong said, “There is no big difference. (She is) still as quirky. No different from the past. The main thing is she used to be quieter. Now, she is more talkative.”\n\nPin it down to motherhood or age, but Faye Wong, who came into showbiz with the name Shirley Wang Jing Wen, is now confident and content enough to call herself just Faye.\n\nEven her album producer and mentor, Alvin Leong, who has known her for eight years, agreed.\n\n“When we first met, she was 19 and didn’t know many people in Hong Kong. When it came to work, it was just me and her.\n\n\"Then, she was very serious and anxious about her work. Now, it is different. As long as it’s done at a comfortable pace, it’s fine,” Alvin told Disc Jockey Magazine.\n\n——————————————————————\n\nSOURCE: THE NEW PAPER\n\nFaye Wong may be back but do not expect her to change her icy elusive ways. “I will do a reasonable amount of promotions for my albums,” she said. “Not too much, not too little.”\n\nShe insisted that her private life - including her daughter and marriage - should be kept safe from public glare.\n\n“If you reporters appear at my house, don’t expect me to entertain you,” she warned.\n\nAh, but that seems to be her recipe for the perennial longing on the part of her fans and the media. You can never get enough of Wong.\n\nSome reporters in Hong Kong have even resorted to playing guessing games when all other attempts to dig out details of her life failed.\n\nIt was reported widely in Hong Kong that her daughter was called Dou Yingtong but Wong finally dispelled the “myth” at the press conference on Monday.\n\n“I don’t know where they got that name,” she barked. “But she has a name and her surname is Dou indeed.”\n\nAs for her daughter’s first name, forget it. She is not telling.\n\n——————————————————————\n\nSOURCE: THE STRAITS TIMES"
