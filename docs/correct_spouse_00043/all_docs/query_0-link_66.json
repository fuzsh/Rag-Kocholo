        "text": "So it's not just Adele and Taylor Swift who record music about failed relationships and rubbishing their former lovers. Joining the confessional pop song party is Leon Lai, who's finally broken his peace about his divorce from Gaile Lok and singing how he really feels about his ex-wife: \"I never loved you,\" says the Hong Kong superstar.\n\nLeon had since October remained silent over the demise of his four-year marriage due to \"irreconcilable differences\", keeping an usually low profile and almost hiding from any limelight, leading the media to speculate that he was deeply hurt over the break-up.\n\nGaile, on the other hand, has been having a grand old time—going on holiday with friends, posting vacation pictures on the Internet, and generally showing the world how much fun she's having being a single girl again.\n\nFive months later and Leon seems to have recovered from his heartbreak in song. This week his new Mandarin tune came out, written and composed by his friends Cheung Cho-kiu and Ronald Ng, and aptly titled to express what he thinks about his former missus—I Can Forget You. Ouch.\n\nThe words go: \"I never loved you/ I only loved myself/ I'm using the relationship to satisfy my curiosity/ And test the extend of my infatuation towards love/ I only dared to play games/ I'm sorry and please don't mind.\"\n\nHe also sings: \"Why we were always tired/ Why we were always in a mess/ I never loved you/ I only loved missing you/ I'll succeed if only when I'm not afraid to think about you.\"\n\nAnd although the track suggests he blames himself as well for the split, he's so gotten over it: \"No matter how difficult/ It has got nothing to do with you/ No matter where you are/ The memories stay in my heart/ I can forget you but wished to keep this a secret/ You be safe and well/ And I'll quietly survive.\"\n\nBut the biggest shocker is when he hints that he regrets breaking up with his last girlfriend before getting married. \"I've lost contact with those I wished to see or don't,\" he sings, which might be a reference to Shu Qi, who he dated for six years but left her after his dad couldn't get past her career as a one-time soft-porn star."
