It requires an analysis of published material on the topic on interest. Moreover, for a new researcher, it is challenging extract a great number of required objectives, including the problem identification, commonly known as ‘gap’ in research. Searching and locating most appropriate literature is no more great deal in this era of Information and Communication Technology (ICT), instead overloading of the literature is a major problem and the great change to be handle. Often postgraduate research students raise three questions to their peers and supervisors. First, how many articles are sufficed for a good literature review? Second, how many past years literature will be enough to meet the required level for a good literature review? And third, what if, literature referred is published in the language other than researchers’ language? In this research paper a novel hypothetical model is proposed to answer first two questions; the number of articles required for a good and reasonable literature review and number of years backward the analysis of articles required for the same. Our results indicate that analysis of data partially support our hypothetical model and its assumptions.\n\nAbstract This study was planned to examine the before and after micro credit effect provided by Khushhali bank limited on economic condition of the entrepreneurs in Peshawar city by employing paired t-test.
