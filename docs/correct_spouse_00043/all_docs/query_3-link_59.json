        "text": "Leon Lai,actor-singer.[Photo provided to China Daily]\n\nOn the sets of the upcoming movie Wine War, Leon Lai has many jobs: a translator, light adjustor, prop checker, a child actor's sitter and the most significant one, as director.\n\nAll this is visible in the footage of the movie, Lai's directorial debut.\n\nLai, who is one of the \"heavenly kings\" - the four biggest male stars in HongKong in the 1990s, including Andy Lau, Jacky Cheung and Aaron Kwok, is now working on a new chapter in his 32-year career.\n\nAt 51, the singer-actor is the first among the four to make a career switch.\n\nWhile Cheung focuses on a singing career and sometimes plays supporting roles, Lau and Kwok said they wanted to direct, but have yet to realize that dream.\n\nWine War will hit Chinese theaters on May 19, the same day as Hollywood sci-fi blockbuster Life.\n\nWith eight movies simultaneously premiering on Friday, it seems Lai has picked the most competitive opening weekend this month."
