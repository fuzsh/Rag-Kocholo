        "text": "Pop Stop\n\nBy Max Woodworth / STAFF REPORTER\n\nWhere to start with Hsu Chun-mei (許純美)? Less than a month ago, barely anyone knew who this woman was. Now, it's hard to turn on the TV or flip through a newspaper or magazine without coming across her extravagantly ugly face.\n\nLate last year, Hsu made her first appearance in the news when her five-year-old daughter was found abandoned at a shopping center and she said she'd left the child there because the kid was noisy and annoying. Hsu refused to take the child back into her care.\n\nInexplicably, she parlayed this moment of fame into appearances on TV talk shows and variety shows, where she noisily held court on topics she is entirely unqualified to talk about and generally made an ass of herself in her hilariously accented Mandarin.\n\nBecause no one knew where she'd come from and would ask her about her background, Hsu would fill in the blanks by saying she was from a very rich family in \"society's upper crust,\" earning her the sarcastic moniker \"upper-crust beauty\" (上流美).\n\nWithout much to distinguish herself, Hsu has become a TV sensation merely by her flagrant and obnoxious self-promoting style, her bawdy outfits and her penchant for shooting her mouth off, which has drawn fire from practically everyone she's encountered, except for Zhang Fei (張菲), who thinks she's interesting, at least when she's on his show boosting his ratings.\n\nJacky Wu (吳宗憲), for one, isn't amused by the out-of-left-field emergence of this loud-mouthed woman and earlier this week called her and the media tornado she's generated a symptom of \"Taiwan's mental sickness.\" True to her style, the words had barely left Wu's mouth and she was announcing her intention to sue for defamation seeking NT$200 million in damages.\n\nHoping to capitalize on all the hype, SuperTV has signed Hsu as co-anchor and news analyst on the channel's 6pm news show. But the Broadcasting Development Fund (廣電基金), which acts as a kind of media watchdog, came out in Tuesday's China Times (中國時報) to comment that hiring Hsu as a news analyst was \"trampling on news ethics.\" That hasn't deterred SuperTV, though, from keeping her on the air.\n\nLeon Lai (黎明) and Faye Wong's (王菲) new movie Leaving Me, Loving You (大城小事) opened in Hong Kong and in Southeast Asia last weekend, generating some gossip over Lai and Wong's tandem promotional appearances for the movie. The two were previously rumored to have been a couple, but Lai is reportedly now the boyfriend of actress Shu Qi (舒琪), who is reportedly jealous about some of the more intimate scenes in the film and the duo's promo tour."
