Their sparse public appearances together have often led to rumours that the two were not getting along and that a divorce was imminent.\n\nLast year, when rumours of the two's split were coupled with hearsay that the 31-year-old model was using self-mutilation to reconcile with her husband. These were quashed when Leon appeared at the New York Film Festival with Gaile by his side with their fingers tightly entwined. The 45-year-old actor also purchased a mansion in San Francisco for his wife.\n\nThis month, rumours resurfaced once again as Gaile appeared for an event in a revealing outfit. The model has kept her wardrobe choices conservative ever since her marriage, thus sparking gossip that the couple would split.\n\nYesterday, a source claimed that the two had already finalized their divorce last week and that Gaile has returned to the US, where her parents reside at.\n\nCalls to Gaile for confirmation on the matter have gone unanswered as her management announced that the model was in the US for a vacation, but refuted rumours of the split, requesting that the media \"Ask the persons involved\"."
