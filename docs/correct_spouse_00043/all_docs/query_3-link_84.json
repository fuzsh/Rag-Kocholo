Apple Daily reported that the girl was born prematurely and weighed only 2.3kg.\n\nLai had confirmed the pregnancy in March 2018, and posted on Facebook that they were “two people who have experienced divorce” but had gotten together. He did not share if they were married but said he would protect his family against media exposure."
