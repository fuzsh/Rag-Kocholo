She got on at the last minute (as typical for entertainment types).\n\nA couple of years ago, spotted Sammo Hung before, during and after a BR flight from HKG - TPE. He actually signed some autographs for fans in the baggage claim area at Taoyuan Airport.\n\nThe Hong Kong to Taipei flights are good for spotting entertainers - because of the pop stars in one locale are often popular in the other area, and they may do recording/filming in both places.\n\nAug 14, 2007, 8:46 am\n\nJoin Date: Jul 2003\n\nLocation: CGK\n\nPrograms: SQ TPP28, CX DM, DL P, GA CB, WOH LGLOB, HH D, MB G, Hertz P\n\nPosts: 2,884\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by janes addiction\n\nLeon Lai and gf (some HK model who I now forget) on HKG - JFK.
