        "text": "Aslam o Alaikum everyone\n\nI was looking at current affairs old papers and noted that compulsory first question of mcqs has become a standard since 2005. It accounts for 20 marks, i.e. one mark/mcq, and most definitely, score of the paper relies heavily on it. I tried to seek any post regarding MCQs on the forum, but in vain (or atleast it wasnt there in front lines). Maybe thats because most aspirants, or maybe even seniors , think that MCQs appear in random and therefore one need to rely heavily on luck for this question (if u are extremely lucky, u can score 20 in first question alone ). Maybe that is absolutely right, but the phrase \"God helps those who help themselves\" kept echoing in my mind, so I decided to start a new thread, wherein I request all visitors to post something they think is capable of being an MCQ. It maybe just one line factoid to countless lines of facts & figures, but contributing regularly will make it a worthwhile collection.\n\nTo give it a start, I have typed all MCQs that have appeared in past CSS papers (though they appeared in only few papers before 2005). I searched the correct answers and have highlighted and underlined them. I have placed comments wherever I wasnt sure of the correct answer.
